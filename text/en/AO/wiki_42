<text>She&#x27;s So Unusual is the debut studio album by American singer and songwriter Cyndi Lauper, released on October 14, 1983, by Portrait Records. It stands out for its commercial success, achieving four top-five singles—a pioneering achievement for a debut album by a female artist. The album was re-released in 2014 to commemorate its 30th anniversary, and was called &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual: A 30th Anniversary Celebration&quot;. The re-release contains demos and remixes of previously released material, as well as new artwork.

In 1978, Lauper formed the band Blue Angel. The band soon signed a recording contract with Polydor Records; however, their debut album, &quot;Blue Angel&quot;, was a commercial failure. The band parted ways after firing their manager, who sued Lauper for $80,000 and forced her into bankruptcy. Lauper went on to sing in many New York night clubs, and caught the eye of David Wolff, who became her manager and subsequently got her signed to Portrait Records.

Six singles were released from the album, with &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; becoming a worldwide hit and her first song to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Time After Time&quot; became her first number-one hit on the chart and experienced similar success worldwide. Lauper found success with the next two singles as well, with both &quot;She Bop&quot; and &quot;All Through the Night&quot; peaking in the top five. This makes Lauper the first female singer to have four top five singles on the Hot 100 from one album. &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot; was promoted by the Fun Tour throughout 1983 and 1984.

The album is primarily new wave-based, with many of the songs being influenced by synthpop and pop rock. Upon its release, the album received positive reviews from music critics, who noted Lauper&#x27;s unique vocals. Lauper earned several awards and accolades for the album, including two Grammy Awards at the 27th Grammy Awards, one of which was for Best New Artist. &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot; peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and stayed in the chart&#x27;s top forty for 65 weeks. It has sold over 7 million copies in the United States and 16 million copies worldwide. This makes it Lauper&#x27;s best-selling album to date and one of the best-selling albums of the 1980s. In 2003, &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot; was ranked at number 494 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and it subsequently placed at number 184 in a 2020 reboot of the list. In 2019, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Background ==
In 1978, Lauper met saxophone player John Turi and formed the band Blue Angel. They recorded a demo tape of original music. Steve Massarsky heard the tape and liked Lauper&#x27;s voice. He bought out Blue Angel&#x27;s contract for $5,000 and became their manager.

Lauper received many offers to go solo, but rebuffed any offer that didn&#x27;t include the rest of the band. Blue Angel was eventually signed by Polydor Records and released a self-titled album on the label in 1980. Despite some positive critical attention, the album was a commercial failure. The members of Blue Angel also had a falling-out with Massarsky and fired him as their manager. He later filed an $80,000 suit against them, which forced Lauper into bankruptcy.

After Blue Angel broke up, Lauper spent time working in retail stores and singing in local clubs. In 1981, while singing in a local New York bar, Lauper met David Wolff, who took over as her manager. With his help, Lauper signed with Portrait Records, a subsidiary of Epic Records, in the spring of 1983 and soon began recording her debut album.

== Artwork ==
The front cover of &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot; was photographed on Henderson Walk in Coney Island, New York in the summer of 1983 by Annie Leibovitz. Lauper is depicted wearing a vintage red prom-style dress that she purchased at the vintage clothing shop where she used to work, Screaming Mimi&#x27;s. She is also seen holding a bouquet of flowers which were purchased from a vendor on the boardwalk at the time of the shoot. Lauper has heavy costume jewelry on her ears, arms, neck and her right ankle. She is barefoot, with the exception of the fishnet stockings, and her red high-heels appear to have been taken off in front of her as they lay on their sides at the bottom of the photo. The cover shot was captured in front of the wax museum, The World In Wax Musee. It can be seen behind Lauper that the museum had been closed for some time and at the time of closure was featuring a wax statue of Puerto Rican baseball great Roberto Clemente. The wooden awning above the doorway with the two blue panels read the name of the museum. The first panel read &quot;The World&quot; and second panel read &quot;In Wax&quot;. This was airbrushed out of the photograph.

The cover won Janet Perr the Grammy Award for Best Recording Package in 1985.

== Singles ==
The lead single from the album was &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot;, released on September 6, 1983. This single achieved massive success in the United States with its music video playing in heavy rotation on several stations, and eventually peaking at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It received Platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of 2,000,000 copies. The single was a success internationally, reaching the top ten in 19 countries and number one in 10 countries, including; Australia, Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Brazil and Norway. &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; received nominations at the 1985 Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and won Best Female Video at the 1984 MTV Video Music Awards, among several nominations. In the year end Top 100 of 1984 in New Zealand, the single was included on the top spots.

&quot;Time After Time&quot; was the second single released from the album, and was released in April 1984. It repeated the success of the previous single and spent two consecutive weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming Lauper&#x27;s first number one hit on the Hot 100 and eventually spending a total of 20 weeks on the chart and receiving Gold certification from the RIAA for 1,000,000 copies sold. Like the previous single, &quot;Time After Time&quot; was an international success and reached the top ten in 15 countries. The song received a Grammy nomination for Song of the Year. In the year end Top 100 of 1984 in New Zealand, the single was included on the top spots.

The third single from the album was &quot;She Bop&quot;, released on July 2, 1984. This single reached number three on the Hot 100, becoming her third consecutive top five hit, and spent a total of 18 weeks on the chart. With sales of over 1,000,000 copies, the song was certified Gold by the RIAA. The single proved to be another international success for Lauper, reaching the top ten in 8 countries. &quot;She Bop&quot; was controversial upon release and placed at number 15 on the PMRC&#x27;s &quot;Filthy Fifteen&quot;.

&quot;All Through the Night&quot; was single number four, released in September 1984. Like Lauper&#x27;s previous three singles, &quot;All Through the Night&quot; reached the top five of the Hot 100 with a peak of number five. It was written by, and originally recorded by Jules Shear, who provided backup vocals as well. The song was a moderate international success, reaching the top ten in 6 countries, and received Gold certification in Canada. In the year end Top 100 of 1985 in New Zealand, the single was included on the list.

Single number five was &quot;Money Changes Everything&quot;, released in December 1984. It was a moderate success and reached number #27 on the Hot 100, Lauper&#x27;s first single to not reach the top ten. It also did moderately well in Australia, reaching #19 on its chart.

The sixth and final single from the album was a cover of the Prince song, &quot;When You Were Mine&quot;, released on January 31, 1985, in Canada and Japan only. It achieved little success, reaching number #62 on the &quot;Canadian Singles Chart&quot;.

== Reception ==
In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Kurt Loder highlighted Lauper&#x27;s &quot;wild and wonderful skyrocket of a voice&quot;, which he felt recalled the &quot;long-gone golden age&quot; of &quot;pre-Beatles girl-group pop&quot;, and lauded &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot; as a progression from her work in Blue Angel: &quot;Here, boosted by a powerful, synth-based band, Lauper turns away from nouveau trash and trains her talent on some really first-rate material.&quot; Robert Christgau gave qualified praise in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, complimenting Lauper for covering &quot;two of the sharpest pop songs of the past five years&quot; in &quot;Money Changes Everything&quot; and &quot;When You Were Mine&quot;, while finding her &quot;Betty Boop voice&quot; less effective over a full album; however, he would later pen a glowing reappraisal of the record, conceding that &quot;if a kook who&#x27;s loved, respected, and taken seriously by her sisters fools boys into believing she can be fooled with, more power to her.&quot; &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot; was voted the eleventh-best album of the year in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll for 1984.

Retrospectively, AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine deemed &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot; &quot;one of the great new wave/early MTV records&quot; and &quot;a giddy mix of self-confidence, effervescent popcraft, unabashed sentimentality, subversiveness, and clever humor&quot;, concluding that &quot;if Lauper couldn&#x27;t maintain this level of consistency, it&#x27;s because this captured her persona better than anyone could imagine&quot;. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Sal Cinquemani called it &quot;a pop classic&quot; with a &quot;rare balance of camp and candor that set Lauper apart from her contemporaries and continues to retain her place in the pop pantheon.&quot; In &quot;Classic Pop&quot;, John Earls praised the album as a testament to Lauper&#x27;s &quot;will, exuberance and vocal control&quot; and versatility &quot;across synth-pop, rock and power ballads&quot;, while Terry Staunton wrote in &quot;Record Collector&quot; that Lauper&#x27;s &quot;cartoon-like kooky personality was underpinned by a formidable songwriting talent.&quot; Arielle Gordon of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; said that with &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot;, &quot;Lauper shoehorned rebellion into the familiar, both musically and visually&quot;, helping to &quot;usher in an electronic era for popular rock&quot; and envisioning &quot;a world where women danced through New York in ruffle skirts and combat boots, partied with a sense of purpose, and were just as powerful at their most vulnerable as their most ferocious.&quot;

<text>A music video is a video that integrates a song or an album with imagery that is produced for promotional or musical artistic purposes. Modern music videos are primarily made and used as a music marketing device intended to promote the sale of music recordings. These videos are typically shown on music television and on streaming video sites like YouTube, or more rarely shown theatrically. They can be commercially issued on home video, either as video albums or video singles. The format has been described by various terms including &quot;illustrated song&quot;, &quot;filmed insert&quot;, &quot;promotional (promo) film&quot;, &quot;promotional clip&quot;, &quot;promotional video&quot;, &quot;song video&quot;, &quot;song clip&quot;, &quot;film clip&quot;, &quot;video clip&quot;, or simply &quot;video&quot;.

While musical short films were popular as soon as recorded sound was introduced to theatrical film screenings in the 1920s, the music video rose to prominence in the 1980s when American pay-TV channel MTV based its format around the medium.

Music videos use a wide range of styles and contemporary video-making techniques, including animation, live-action, documentary, and non-narrative approaches such as abstract film. Combining these styles and techniques has become more popular due to the variety for the audience. Many music videos interpret images and scenes from the song&#x27;s lyrics, while others take a more thematic approach. Other music videos may not have any concept, being only a filmed version of the song&#x27;s live concert performance.

==History and development==

In 1894, sheet music publishers Edward B. Marks and Joe Stern hired electrician George Thomas and various artists to promote sales of their song &quot;The Little Lost Child&quot;. Using a magic lantern, Thomas projected a series of still images on a screen simultaneous to live performances. This would become a popular form of entertainment known as the illustrated song, the first step toward music video.

===Talkies, soundies, and shorts===
With the arrival of &quot;talkies&quot; many musical short films were produced. Vitaphone shorts (produced by Warner Bros.) featured many bands, vocalists, and dancers. Animation artist Max Fleischer introduced a series of sing-along short cartoons called &quot;Screen Songs&quot;, which invited audiences to sing along to popular songs by &quot;following the bouncing ball&quot;, which is similar to a modern karaoke machine. Early cartoons featured popular musicians performing their hit songs on camera in live-action segments during the cartoons. John Logie Baird created Phonovision discs featuring Betty Bolton and other singers from the 1930s. The early animated films by Walt Disney, such as the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; shorts and especially &quot;Fantasia&quot;, which featured several interpretations of classical pieces, were built around music. The Warner Bros. cartoons, even today billed as &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;, were initially fashioned around specific songs from upcoming Warner Bros. musical films. Live-action musical shorts, featuring such popular artists as Cab Calloway, were also distributed to theaters.

Blues singer Bessie Smith appeared in a two-reel short film called &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; featuring a dramatized performance of the hit song. Numerous other musicians appeared in short musical subjects during this period.

&quot;Soundies&quot;, produced and released for the Panoram film jukebox, were musical films that often included short dance sequences, similar to later music videos.

Musician Louis Jordan made short films for his songs, some of which were spliced together into a feature film, &quot;Lookout Sister&quot;. These films were, according to music historian Donald Clarke, the &quot;ancestors&quot; of music video.
Musical films were another important precursor to a music video, and several well-known music videos have imitated the style of classic Hollywood musicals from the 1930s–50s. One of the best-known examples is Madonna&#x27;s 1985 video for &quot;Material Girl&quot; (directed by Mary Lambert) which was closely modelled on Jack Cole&#x27;s staging of &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; from the film &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;. Several of Michael Jackson&#x27;s videos show the unmistakable influence of the dance sequences in classic Hollywood musicals, including the landmark &quot;Thriller&quot; and the Martin Scorsese-directed &quot;Bad&quot;, which was influenced by the stylized dance &quot;fights&quot; in the film version of &quot;West Side Story&quot;. According to the Internet Accuracy Project, DJ/singer J. P. &quot;The Big Bopper&quot; Richardson was the first to coin the phrase &quot;music video&quot;, in 1959.

In his autobiography, Tony Bennett claims to have created &quot;...the first music video&quot; when he was filmed walking along the Serpentine in Hyde Park, London, with the resulting clip being set to his recording of the song &quot;Stranger in Paradise&quot;. The clip was sent to UK and US television stations and aired on shows including Dick Clark&#x27;s American Bandstand. 
The oldest example of a promotional music video with similarities to more abstract, modern videos seems to be the Czechoslovakian &quot;Dáme si do bytu&quot; (&quot;We´ll put in the apartment&quot;) created and directed by Ladislav Rychman.

=== Beginnings of popular music television and promotional clips: 1960–1973 ===
In the late 1950s the Scopitone, a visual jukebox, was introduced in France and short films were produced by many French artists, such as Serge Gainsbourg, Françoise Hardy, Jacques Dutronc, and the Belgian Jacques Brel to accompany their songs. Its use spread to other countries, and similar machines such as the Cinebox in Italy and Color-sonic in the U.S. were patented. In 1961, for the Canadian-produced show &quot;Singalong Jubilee&quot;, Manny Pittson began pre-recording the music audio, went on-location and taped various visuals with the musicians lip-synching, then edited the audio and video together. Most music numbers were taped in-studio on stage, and the location shoot &quot;videos&quot; were to add variety. In 1964, Kenneth Anger&#x27;s experimental short film, &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; used popular songs instead of dialogue.

On 1 January 1964, Johnnie Stewart and Stanley Dorfman created the British chart music television series &quot;Top of the Pops,&quot; which they produced in tandem and directed in weekly rotation until the 1970s&quot;.&quot; The show&#x27;s format created a demand for frequent studio appearances by renowned British and US artists at short notice, as the charts came out on Tuesday mornings and the show was taped live on Thursdays. Coupled with the artists busy touring schedules and subsequent requests from broadcasters in Europe and America to showcase popular British acts, ultimately prompted the production of pre-recorded or filmed inserts referred to as &quot;promotional videos.&quot; These videos served as substitutes for live performances by the artists and played a pivotal role in the development of the music video genre. During the early stages of the show&#x27;s introduction in 1964, when alternative footage was unavailable, Dorfman and Stewart resorted to capturing footage of the enthusiastic audience dancing. However, a significant change took place in October 1964 when a decision was made to occasionally introduce a dance troupe with choreographed routines for specific tracks. This addition brought a new dynamic to the show, enhancing its visual appeal and diversifying the entertainment value for viewers. One notable example was the video for Roy Orbison&#x27;s song &#x27;Oh Pretty Woman&#x27;, which Dorfman filmed and directed in the rooftop garden of London&#x27;s Kensington-based Derry and Toms department store on 19 October 1964 as a visual accompaniment to the song. It subsequently aired on Top of the Pops on 22 October, 29, as well as 12 November and 19.&quot; By the 1970s, Top of the Pops had an average weekly viewership of 12,500,000 people, had solidified its status as the premier international platform for artists launching new records at the time, had firmly established the significance of promotional film clips as a crucial tool for promoting the careers of emerging artists and generating buzz for new releases by established acts, and was significant in developing and popularizing what would later become the music video genre across the globe.

In 1964, The Moody Blues producer Alex Murray wanted to promote his version of &quot;Go Now&quot;. The short film clip he produced and directed to promote the single has a striking visual style that predates Queen&#x27;s similar &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; video by a full decade. It also predates what the Beatles did with promotional films of their single &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; and B-Side &quot;Rain&quot;, both released in 1966.

Also in 1964, the Beatles starred in their first feature film, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, directed by US filmmaker Richard Lester. Shot in black-and-white and presented as a mock documentary, it interspersed comedic and dialogue sequences with musical tones. The musical sequences furnished basic templates on which numerous subsequent music videos were modeled. It was the direct model for the successful US TV series &quot;The Monkees&quot; (1966–1968), which was similarly composed of film segments that were created to accompany various Monkees songs. The Beatles&#x27; second feature, &quot;Help!&quot; (1965), was a much more lavish affair, filmed in color in London and on international locations. The title track sequence, filmed in black-and-white, is arguably one of the prime archetypes of the modern performance-style music video, employing rhythmic cross-cutting, contrasting long shots and close-ups, and infrequent shots and camera angles, such as the shot 50 seconds into the song, in which George Harrison&#x27;s left hand and the neck of his guitar are seen in sharp focus in the foreground while the completely out-of-focus figure of John Lennon sings in the background.

In 1965, the Beatles started making promotional clips (then known as &quot;filmed inserts&quot;) for distribution and broadcast on Top of the Pops and in different countries—primarily the U.S.—so they could promote their record releases without having to make in-person appearances. Their first batch of promo films shot in late 1965 (including their then-current single, &quot;Day Tripper&quot;/&quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;), were fairly straightforward mimed-in-studio performance pieces (albeit sometimes in silly sets) and meant to blend in fairly seamlessly with television shows like &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;. By the time the Beatles stopped touring in late 1966, their promotional films, like their recordings, had become highly sophisticated. In May 1966 they filmed two sets of colour promotional clips for their current single &quot;Rain&quot;/&quot;Paperback Writer&quot; all directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who went on to direct &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot; and the Beatles&#x27; final film, &quot;Let It Be&quot;. It aired on Top of the Pops on 2 June. The colour promotional clips for &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, made in early 1967 and directed by Peter Goldman, took the promotional film format to a new level. They used techniques borrowed from underground and avant-garde film, including reversed film and slow motion, dramatic lighting, unusual camera angles, and colour filtering added in post-production. At the end of 1967 the group released their third film, the one hour, made-for-television project &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;; it was written and directed by the group and first broadcast on the BBC on Boxing Day 1967. Although poorly received at the time for lacking a narrative structure, it showed the group to be adventurous music filmmakers in their own right.
Concert films were being released in the mid-1960s, at least as early as 1964, with the &quot;T.A.M.I. Show&quot;.

The monochrome 1965 clip for Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; filmed by D. A. Pennebaker was featured in Pennebaker&#x27;s Dylan film documentary &quot;Dont Look Back&quot;. Eschewing any attempt to simulate performance or present a narrative, the clip shows Dylan standing in a city back alley, silently shuffling a series of large cue cards (bearing key words from the song&#x27;s lyrics).

Besides the Beatles, many other British artists made &quot;filmed inserts&quot; so they could be screened on TV when the bands were not available to appear live. The Who featured in several promotional clips, beginning with their 1965 clip for &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot;. Their plot clip for &quot;Happy Jack&quot; (1966) shows the band acting like a gang of thieves. The promo film to &quot;Call Me Lightning&quot; (1968) tells a story of how drummer Keith Moon came to join the group: The other three band members are having tea inside what looks like an abandoned hangar when suddenly a &quot;bleeding box&quot; arrives, out of which jumps a fast-running, time lapse, Moon that the other members subsequently try to get a hold of in a sped-up slapstick chasing sequence to wind him down. Pink Floyd produced promotional films for their songs, including &quot;San Francisco: Film&quot;, directed by Anthony Stern, &quot;Scarecrow&quot;, &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; and &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;, the latter directed by Peter Whitehead, who also made several pioneering clips for The Rolling Stones between 1966 and 1968. The Kinks made one of the first &quot;plot&quot; promotional clips for a song. For their single &quot;Dead End Street&quot; (1966) a miniature comic movie was made. The BBC reportedly refused to air the clip because it was considered to be in &quot;poor taste&quot;.

The Rolling Stones appeared in many promotional clips for their songs in the 1960s. In 1966, Peter Whitehead directed two promo clips for their single &quot;Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing In The Shadow?&quot; In 1967, Whitehead directed a plot clip colour promo clip for the Stones single &quot;We Love You&quot;, which first aired in August 1967. This clip featured sped-up footage of the group recording in the studio, intercut with a mock trial that clearly alludes to the drug prosecutions of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards underway at that time. Jagger&#x27;s girlfriend Marianne Faithfull appears in the trial scenes and presents the &quot;judge&quot; (Richards) with what may be the infamous fur rug that had featured so prominently in the press reports of the drug bust at Richards&#x27; house in early 1967. When it is pulled back, it reveals an apparently naked Jagger with chains around his ankles. The clip concludes with scenes of the Stones in the studio intercut with footage that had previously been used in the &quot;concert version&quot; promo clip for &quot;Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby&quot;. The group also filmed a color promo clip for the song &quot;2000 Light Years from Home&quot; (from their album &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;) directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg. In 1968, Michael Lindsay-Hogg directed three clips for their single &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; / &quot;Child Of The Moon&quot;—a color clip for &quot;Child Of The Moon&quot; and two different clips for &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot;. In 1968, they collaborated with Jean-Luc Godard on the film &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, which mixed Godard&#x27;s politics with documentary footage of the song&#x27;s evolution during recording sessions.

In 1966, Nancy Sinatra filmed a clip for her song &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;. Roy Orbison appeared in promotional clips, such as his 1968 hit, &quot;Walk On&quot;.

During late 1972–73, Alice Cooper featured in a series of promotional films: &quot;Elected&quot;, &quot;Hello Hooray&quot;, &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot; and &quot;Teenage Lament &#x27;74&quot;. Also during late 1972–73, David Bowie featured in a series of promotional films directed by pop photographer Mick Rock, who worked extensively with Bowie in this period. Rock directed and edited four clips to promote four consecutive David Bowie singles—&quot;John, I&#x27;m Only Dancing&quot; (May 1972), &quot;The Jean Genie&quot; (November 1972), the December 1972 US re-release of &quot;Space Oddity&quot; and the 1973 release of the single &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; (lifted from Bowie&#x27;s earlier album &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;). The clip for &quot;John, I&#x27;m Only Dancing&quot; was made with a budget of just US$200 and filmed at the afternoon rehearsal for Bowie&#x27;s Rainbow Theatre concert on August 19, 1972. It shows Bowie and band mimicking to the record intercut with footage of the Lindsay Kemp mime troupe, dancing on stage and behind a back-lit screen. The clip was turned down by the BBC, who reportedly found the homosexual overtones of the film distasteful; accordingly, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; replaced it with footage of bikers and a dancer. The &quot;Jean Genie&quot; clip, produced for just US$350, was shot in one day and edited in less than two days. It intercuts footage of Bowie and band in concert with contrasting footage of the group in a photographic studio, wearing black stage outfits, and standing against a white background. It also includes location footage with Bowie and Cyrinda Foxe (a MainMan employee and a friend of David and Angie Bowie) shot in San Francisco outside the famous Mars Hotel, with Fox posing provocatively in the street while Bowie lounges against the wall, smoking.

Country music also picked up on the trend of promotional film clips to publicize songs. Sam Lovullo, the producer of the television series &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, explained his show presented &quot;what were, in reality, the first musical videos&quot;, while JMI Records made the same claim with Don Williams&#x27; 1973 song &quot;The Shelter of Your Eyes&quot;. Country music historian Bob Millard wrote that JMI had pioneered the country music video concept by &quot;producing a 3-minute film&quot; to go along with Williams&#x27; song. Lovullo said his videos were conceptualized by having the show&#x27;s staff go to nearby rural areas and film animals and farmers, before editing the footage to fit the storyline of a particular song. &quot;The video material was a very workable production item for the show,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It provided picture stories for songs. However, some of our guests felt the videos took attention away from their live performances, which they hoped would promote record sales. If they had a hit song, they didn&#x27;t want to play it under comic barnyard footage.&quot; The concept&#x27;s mixed reaction eventually spelled an end to the &quot;video&quot; concept on &quot;Hee Haw&quot;. Promotional films of country music songs, however, continued to be produced.

In 1974, the band Sparks made a promotional video for their song &quot;This Town Ain&#x27;t Big Enough for Both of Us&quot;.

=== 1974–1980 ===
The Australian TV shows &quot;Countdown&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot;, both of which premiered in 1974, followed in the steps of the UK&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and were significant in developing and popularizing what would later become the music video genre in Australia and other countries, and in establishing the importance of promotional film clips as a means of promoting both emerging acts and new releases by established acts. In early 1974, former radio DJ Graham Webb launched a weekly teen-oriented TV music show which screened on Sydney&#x27;s ATN-7 on Saturday mornings; this was renamed &quot;Sounds Unlimited&quot; in 1975 and later shortened simply to &quot;Sounds&quot;. In need of material for the show, Webb approached Seven newsroom staffer Russell Mulcahy and asked him to shoot film footage to accompany popular songs for which there were no purpose-made clips (e.g. Harry Nilsson&#x27;s &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talkin&quot;). Using this method, Webb and Mulcahy assembled a collection of about 25 clips for the show. The success of his early efforts encouraged Mulcahy to quit his TV job and become a full-time director, and he made clips for several popular Australian acts including Stylus, Marcia Hines, Hush and AC/DC. As it gained popularity, &quot;Countdown&quot; talent coordinator Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum and producer Michael Shrimpton quickly realized that &quot;film clips&quot; were becoming an important new commodity in music marketing. Despite the show&#x27;s minuscule budget, &quot;Countdown&quot;″s original director Paul Drane was able to create several memorable music videos especially for the show, including the classic film-clips for the AC/DC hits &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll)&quot; and &quot;Jailbreak&quot;. After relocating to the UK in the mid-1970s, Mulcahy made successful promo films for several noted British pop acts—his early UK credits included XTC&#x27;s &quot;Making Plans for Nigel&quot; (1979) and his landmark video clip for The Buggles&#x27; &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; (1979), which became the first music video played on MTV in 1981.
In 1975, Queen employed Bruce Gowers to make a promotional video to show their new single &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; on the BBC music series &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. According to rock historian Paul Fowles, the song is &quot;widely credited as the first global hit single for which an accompanying video was central to the marketing strategy&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has said of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;: &quot;Its influence cannot be overstated, practically inventing the music video seven [sic] years before MTV went on the air.&quot;

At the end of the 1970s, the broadcasting of music videos on television became more and more regular, in several countries. The music videos were, for example, broadcast in weekly music programs or inserted into various programs. In the United States, for example, on terrestrial networks at the end of the 1970s, music videos were sometimes broadcast on music shows: &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;, &quot;Don Kirshner&#x27;s Rock Concert&quot;, and occasionally on certain talk shows.

A worldwide pioneer in programs that only transmitted rock and pop music video clips was the Peruvian program Disco Club, hosted by the Peruvian musician Gerardo Manuel, which began its transmission on the Peruvian state channel (Channel 7 of Lima, Peru in free-to-air TV) in June 1978, three years before the appearance of MTV. Initially, it was only broadcast on Saturdays at 7 p.m. , but due to acceptance, in November of that same year it began to be broadcast every day.

&quot;Video Concert Hall&quot;, created by Jerry Crowe and Charles Henderson and launched on November 1, 1979, was the first nationwide video music programming on American cable television, predating MTV by almost two years. The USA Cable Network program &quot;Night Flight&quot; was one of the first American programs to showcase these videos as an art form.

In 1980, the music video to David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; became the most expensive ever made, having a production cost of $582,000 (equivalent to $ million in ), the first music video to have a production cost of over $500,000. The video was made in solarized color with stark black-and-white scenes and was filmed in different locations, including a padded room and a rocky shore. The video became one of the most iconic ever made at the time, and its complex nature is seen as significant in the evolution of the music video.

The same year, New Zealander group Split Enz had major success with the single &quot;I Got You&quot; and the album &quot;True Colours&quot;, and later that year they produced a complete set of promo clips for each song on the album (directed by their percussionist, Noel Crombie) and to market these on videocassette. This was followed a year later by the video album, &quot;The Completion Backward Principle&quot; by The Tubes, directed by the group&#x27;s keyboard player, Michael Cotten, which included two videos directed by Russell Mulcahy (&quot;Talk to Ya Later&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Want to Wait Anymore&quot;). Among the first music videos were clips produced by ex-Monkee Michael Nesmith, who started making short musical films for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In 1981, he released &quot;Elephant Parts&quot;, the first winner of a Grammy for music video, directed by William Dear. &quot;Billboard&quot; credits the independently produced Video Concert Hall as being the first with nationwide video music programming on American television.

===1981–1991: Music videos go mainstream===
In 1981, the U.S. video channel MTV launched, airing &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; by The Buggles and beginning an era of 24-hour-a-day music on television. With this new outlet for material, the music video would, by the mid-1980s, grow to play a central role in popular music marketing. Many important acts of this period, most notably Michael Jackson, Adam and the Ants, Duran Duran and Madonna, owed a great deal of their success to the skillful construction and seductive appeal of their videos.

Two key innovations in the development of the modern music video were the development of relatively inexpensive and easy-to-use video recording and editing equipment, and the development of visual effects created with techniques such as image compositing. The advent of high-quality color videotape recorders and portable video cameras coincided with the DIY ethos of the new wave era, enabling many pop acts to produce promotional videos quickly and cheaply, in comparison to the relatively high costs of using film. However, as the genre developed, music video directors increasingly turned to 35mm film as the preferred medium, while others mixed film and video.
During the 1980s, music videos had become &quot;de rigueur&quot; for most recording artists. The phenomenon was famously parodied by BBC television comedy program &quot;Not The Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; who produced a spoof music video &quot;Nice Video, Shame About The Song&quot; (the title was a spoof of a recent pop hit &quot;Nice Legs, Shame About Her Face&quot;).

In this period, directors and the acts they worked with began to discover and expand the form and style of the genre, using more sophisticated effects in their videos, mixing film and video, and adding a storyline or plot to the music video. Occasionally videos were made in a &quot;&quot; form, in which the musical artist was not shown. Because music videos are mainly intended to promote the artist, such videos are comparatively rare; three early 1980s examples are Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Atlantic City&quot;, directed by Arnold Levine, David Mallet&#x27;s video for David Bowie and Queen&#x27;s &quot;Under Pressure&quot;, and Ian Emes&#x27; video for Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;The Chauffeur&quot;. One notable later example of the non-representational style is Bill Konersman&#x27;s innovative 1987 video for Prince&#x27;s &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot; – influenced by Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; clip, it featured only the text of the song&#x27;s lyrics.

In the early 1980s, music videos also began to discover political and social themes. Examples include the music videos for David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;China Girl&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1983) which both discussed race issues. In a 1983 interview, Bowie spoke about the importance of using music videos in addressing social issues, &quot;Let&#x27;s try to use the video format as a platform for some kind of social observation, and not just waste it on trotting out and trying to enhance the public image of the singer involved&quot;.
In 1983, one of the most successful, influential and iconic music videos of all time was released: the nearly 14-minute-long video for Michael Jackson&#x27;s song &quot;Thriller&quot;, directed by John Landis. The video set new standards for production, having cost US $800,000 to film. The video for &quot;Thriller&quot;, along with earlier videos by Jackson for his songs &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Beat It&quot;, were instrumental in getting music videos by African-American artists played on MTV. Prior to Jackson&#x27;s success, videos by African-American artists were rarely played on MTV: according to MTV, this was because it initially conceived itself as a rock-music-oriented channel, although musician Rick James was outspoken in his criticism of the cable channel, claiming in 1983 that MTV&#x27;s refusal to air the music video for his song &quot;Super Freak&quot; and clips by other African-American performers was &quot;blatant racism&quot;. British rock singer David Bowie had also recently lashed out against MTV during an interview that he did with them prior to the release of &quot;Thriller&quot;, stating that he was &quot;floored&quot; by how much MTV neglected black artists, bringing attention to how videos by the &quot;few black artists that one does see&quot; only appeared on MTV between 2:00 a.m. until 6:00 a.m. when nobody was watching.

MTV also influences music video shows aired on other American TV channels, such as: &quot;Friday Night Videos&quot;, launched in 1983 on the terrestrial network NBC and &quot;MV3&quot; launched in 1982.

On March 5, 1983, Country Music Television (CMT), was launched, created and founded by Glenn D. Daniels and uplinked from the Video World Productions facility in Hendersonville, Tennessee. The MuchMusic video channel was launched in Canada in 1984. In 1984, MTV also launched the MTV Video Music Awards (later to be known as the VMAs), an annual awards event that would come to underscore MTV&#x27;s importance in the music industry. The inaugural event rewarded the Beatles and David Bowie with the Video Vanguard Award for their work in pioneering the music video.

In 1985, MTV&#x27;s Viacom (currently Paramount) launched the channel VH1 (then known as &quot;VH-1: Video Hits One&quot;), featuring softer music, and meant to cater to the slightly older baby-boomer demographic who were out-growing MTV. Internationally, MTV Europe was launched in 1987, and MTV Asia in 1991. Another important development in music videos was the launch of &quot;The Chart Show&quot; on the UK&#x27;s Channel 4 in 1986. This was a program that composed entirely of music videos (the only outlet many videos had on British TV at the time), with no presenters. Instead, the videos were linked by then state of the art computer graphics. The show moved to ITV in 1989.

The video for the 1985 Dire Straits song &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; made pioneering use of computer animation, and helped make the song an international hit. The song itself was a wry comment on the music-video phenomenon, sung from the point of view of an appliance deliveryman both drawn to and repelled by the outlandish images and personalities that appeared on MTV. In 1986, Peter Gabriel&#x27;s song &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; used special effects and animation techniques developed by British studio Aardman Animations. The video for &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; would go on to be a phenomenal success and win nine MTV Video Music Awards. In the same year, Kraftwerk released the song &quot;Musique Non Stop&quot;. The video featured 3D animations of the group. It was a collaboration with Rebecca Allen of the New York Institute of Technology and ran continuously on MTV for a while.

In 1988, the show &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot; introduced; the show helped to bring hip hop music to a mass audience for the first time.

===1992–2004: Rise of the directors===
In November 1992, MTV began screening videos made by Chris Cunningham, Michel Gondry, Spike Jonze, Floria Sigismondi, Stéphane Sednaoui, Mark Romanek and Hype Williams who all got their start around this time; all brought a unique vision and style to the videos they directed. Some of these directors, including, Gondry, Jonze, Sigismondi, and F. Gary Gray, went on to direct feature films. This continued a trend that had begun earlier with directors such as Lasse Hallström and David Fincher.

Two of the videos directed by Romanek in 1995 are notable for being two of the three most expensive music videos of all time: Michael and Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Scream&quot;, which allegedly cost $7 million to produce, and Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;, which cost a reported $5 million. From this, &quot;Scream&quot; is the most expensive video to date. In the mid to late 1990s, Walter Stern directed &quot;Firestarter&quot; by The Prodigy, &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; by The Verve, and &quot;Teardrop&quot; by Massive Attack.

During this period, MTV launched channels around the world to show music videos produced in each local market: MTV Latin America in 1993, MTV India in 1996, and MTV Mandarin in 1997, among others. MTV2, originally called &quot;M2&quot; and meant to show more alternative and older music videos, debuted in 1996.

In 1999, Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; (featuring guest rapper Jay-Z) became one of the most expensive ever made, costing over $2.5 million.

From 1991 to 2001, &quot;Billboard&quot; had its own Music Video Awards.

=== 2005–present: Music video downloads and streaming ===

The website iFilm, which hosted short videos including music videos, launched in 1997. Napster, a peer-to-peer file sharing service which ran between 1999 and 2001, enabled users to share video files, including those for music videos. By the mid-2000s, MTV and many of its sister channels had largely abandoned showing music videos in favor of reality TV shows, which were more popular with its audiences, and which MTV had itself helped to pioneer with the show &quot;The Real World&quot;, which premiered in 1992.

2005 saw the launch of YouTube, which made the viewing of online video much faster and easier; Google Videos, Yahoo! Video, Facebook and Myspace&#x27;s video functionality use similar technology. Such websites had a profound effect on the viewing of music videos; some artists began to see success as a result of videos seen mostly or entirely online. The band OK Go capitalized on the growing trend, having achieved fame through the videos for two of their songs, &quot;A Million Ways&quot; in 2005 and &quot;Here It Goes Again&quot; in 2006, both of which first became well-known online (OK Go repeated the trick with another high-concept video in 2010, for their song &quot;This Too Shall Pass&quot;).

At its launch, Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store provided a section of free music videos in high quality compression to be watched via the iTunes application. More recently the iTunes Store has begun selling music videos for use on Apple&#x27;s iPod with video playback capability.

The 2008 video for Weezer&#x27;s &quot;Pork and Beans&quot; also captured this trend, by including at least 20 YouTube celebrities; the single became the most successful of Weezer&#x27;s career, in chart performance. In 2007, the RIAA issued cease-and-desist letters to YouTube users to prevent single users from sharing videos, which are the property of the music labels. After its merger with Google, YouTube assured the RIAA that they would find a way to pay royalties through a bulk agreement with the major record labels. This was complicated by the fact that not all labels share the same policy toward music videos: some welcome the development and upload music videos to various online outlets themselves, viewing music videos as free advertising for their artists, while other labels view music videos not as an advertisement, but as the product itself.

To further signify the change in direction towards Music Video airplay, MTV officially dropped the Music Television tagline on February 8, 2010 from their logo in response to their increased commitment to non-scripted reality programming and other youth-oriented entertainment rising in prominence on their live broadcast.

Vevo, a music video service launched by several major music publishers, debuted in December 2009. The videos on Vevo are syndicated to YouTube, with Google and Vevo sharing the advertising revenue.

As of 2017, the most-watched English-language video on YouTube was &quot;Shape of You&quot; by Ed Sheeran. As of 2018, the most-watched remix video on YouTube was &quot;Te Bote&quot; by Casper Mágico featuring Nio García, Darell, Nicky Jam, Bad Bunny, and Ozuna.

====Official lo-fi Internet music clips====
Following the shift toward internet broadcasting and the rising popularity of user-generated video sites such as YouTube around 2006, various independent filmmakers began films recording live sessions to present on the Web. All of these swiftly recorded clips are made with minimal budgets and share similar aesthetics with the lo-fi music movement of the early nineties. Offering freedom from the increasingly burdensome financial requirements of high-production movie-like clips, it began as the only method for little-known indie music artists to present themselves to a wider audience, but increasingly this approach has been taken up by such major mainstream artists as R.E.M. and Tom Jones.

====Vertical videos====
In the late 2010s, some artists began releasing alternative vertical videos tailored to mobile devices in addition to music videos; these vertical videos are generally platform-exclusive. These vertical videos are often shown on Snapchat&#x27;s &quot;Discover&quot; section or within Spotify playlists. Early adopters of vertical video releases include the number-one hit &quot;Girls Like You&quot; by Maroon 5 featuring Cardi B. &quot;Idontwannabeyouanymore&quot; by Billie Eilish is the most-watched vertical video on YouTube.

====Lyric videos====
A lyric video is a type of music video in which the lyrics to the song are the primary visual element of the video. As such, they can be created with relative ease and often serve as a supplemental video to a more traditional music video.

The music video for R.E.M.&#x27;s 1986 song &quot;Fall on Me&quot; interspersed the song&#x27;s lyrics with abstract film footage. In 1987, Prince released a video for his song &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot;. The video featured the song&#x27;s words pulsing to the music, presented alongside abstract geometric shapes, an effect created by Bill Konersman. The following year, the video for the Talking Heads single &quot;(Nothing But) Flowers&quot; composed of the song&#x27;s lyrics superimposed onto or next to members of the band, was released. In 1990, George Michael released &quot;Praying for Time&quot; as a lyric video. He had refused to make a traditional music video, so his label released a simple clip that displayed the song&#x27;s lyrics on a black screen.

Lyric videos rose to greater prominence in the 2010s, when it became relatively easy for artists to disperse videos through websites such as YouTube. Many do not feature any visual related to the musician in question, but merely a background with the lyrics appearing over it as they are sung in the song. In 2011, death metal band Krokmitën released the first lyric video for an entire album, &quot;Alpha-Beta&quot;. The concept album video featured imagery pulsing to the music and stylized typography created by bandleader Simlev. As of 2017, the 2016 song &quot;Closer&quot; by The Chainsmokers, featuring vocalist Halsey, is the most-watched lyric video on YouTube.

==Censorship==

As the concept and medium of a music video is a form of artistic expression, artists have been on many occasions censored if their content is deemed offensive. What may be considered offensive will differ in countries due to censorship laws and local customs and ethics. In most cases, the record label will provide and distribute videos edited or provide both censored and uncensored videos for an artist. In some cases, it has been known for music videos to be banned in their entirety as they have been deemed far too offensive to be broadcast.

===1980s===
The first video to be banned by MTV was Queen&#x27;s 1982 hit &quot;Body Language&quot;. Due to thinly veiled homoerotic undertones plus much skin and sweat (but apparently not enough clothing, save that worn by the fully clothed members of Queen themselves), it was deemed unsuitable for a television audience at the time. However, the channel did air Olivia Newton-John&#x27;s 1981 video for the hit song &quot;Physical&quot;, which lavished camera time on male models working out in string bikinis who spurn her advances, ultimately pairing off to walk to the men&#x27;s locker rooms holding hands, though the network ended the clip before the overt homosexual &quot;reveal&quot; ending in some airings. The video for &quot;Girls on Film&quot; by Duran Duran, which featured topless women mud wrestling and other depictions of sexual fetishes was banned by the BBC. MTV did air the video, albeit in a heavily edited form.

Laura Branigan initially protested an MTV request to edit her &quot;Self Control&quot; video in 1984, but relented when the network refused to air the William Friedkin-directed clip, featuring the singer lured through an increasingly debauched, if increasingly stylized, series of nightclubs by a masked man who ultimately takes her to bed. In 1989, Cher&#x27;s &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot; video (where the singer performs the song in an extremely revealing body suit surrounded by a ship full of cheering sailors) was restricted to late-night broadcasts on MTV. The Sex Pistols&#x27; video for &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; was banned by the BBC for being &quot;in gross bad taste&quot;. Mötley Crüe&#x27;s video for &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls&quot; was banned by MTV for having completely nude women dancing around the members of the band in a strip club, although they did produce another version that was accepted by MTV.

In 1983, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; ran a segment on censorship and &quot;Rock Video Violence&quot;. The episode explored the impact of MTV rock video violence on the youth of the early 1980s. Excerpts from the music videos of Michael Jackson, Duran Duran, Golden Earring, Kiss, Kansas, Billy Idol, Def Leppard, Pat Benatar and The Rolling Stones were shown. Dr. Thomas Radecki of the National Coalition on TV Violence was interviewed accusing the fledgling rock video business of excessive violence. &quot;Night Tracks&quot;&#x27; producer Tom Lynch weighed in on the effects of the video violence controversy. Recording artists John Cougar Mellencamp, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley of Kiss, along with directors Dominic Orlando and Julien Temple, provided a defense of their work. The episode&#x27;s conclusion was that the controversy will continue to grow. Some artists have used censorship as a publicity tool. In the 1980s, the show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; was censorious in its approach to video content, so some acts made videos that they knew would be censored, using the resulting public controversy to promote their release. Examples of this tactic were Duran Duran&#x27;s aforementioned &quot;Girls on Film&quot; and Frankie Goes to Hollywood with &quot;Relax&quot;, directed by Bernard Rose.

===1990s===
In 1991, the dance segment of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Black or White&quot; was edited out because it showed Jackson &quot;inappropriately&quot; touching himself in it. His most controversial video, for &quot;They Don&#x27;t Care About Us&quot;, was banned from MTV, VH1, and BBC due to the alleged anti-Semitic messages in the song and the visuals in the background of the &quot;Prison Version&quot; of the video.

Madonna is the artist most associated with music video censorship. The controversy surrounding Madonna&#x27;s marketing of her sexuality began with the video for &quot;Lucky Star&quot;, and amplified over time due to clips such as &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;. Outcry occurred over the subject matter (relating to teenage pregnancy) discussed in the video for the song &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot;. &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; courted heavy criticism due to its religious, sexual, and racially oriented imagery. In 1990, Madonna&#x27;s music video for the song &quot;Justify My Love&quot; was banned by MTV due to its depiction of sadomasochism, homosexuality, cross-dressing, and group sex which generated a media firestorm. In Canada, the debate over the banning of &quot;Justify My Love&quot; by the music video network MuchMusic led to the launching in 1991 of &quot;Too Much 4 Much&quot;, a series of occasional, late-night specials (still being aired in the early 2000s) in which videos officially banned by MuchMusic were broadcast, followed by a panel discussion regarding why they were removed.

In 1992, The Shamen&#x27;s video for the song &quot;Ebeneezer Goode&quot; was banned by the BBC due to its perceived subliminal endorsement of the recreational drug Ecstasy. The Prodigy&#x27;s 1997 video for &quot;Smack My Bitch Up&quot; was banned in some countries due to depictions of drug use and nudity. The Prodigy&#x27;s video for &quot;Firestarter&quot; was banned by the BBC due to its references to arson.

In 1993, the Australian rock band INXS&#x27; song &quot;The Gift&quot; was banned by MTV due to its use of Holocaust and Gulf War footage, among images of famine, pollution, war, and terrorism. As well as this, metal band Tool&#x27;s music video for &quot;Prison Sex&quot; was banned from MTV, as the video and lyrics touch on the sensitive matter of child abuse.

===2000s===
In 2000, the music video for &quot;Rock DJ&quot; by Robbie Williams caused controversy due to the graphic nature of the video which features Williams stripping naked then peeling off his skin to reveal bloody flesh, followed by ripping off his muscles and organs until he is nothing but a blood-soaked skeleton. The video was censored in the UK during daytime hours and was broadcast unedited after 10 pm. The video was banned in Dominican Republic due to allegations of satanism.

In 2001, Björk&#x27;s video for &quot;Pagan Poetry&quot; was banned from MTV for depictions of sexual intercourse, fellatio, and body piercings. Her next single, &quot;Cocoon&quot;, was also banned by MTV as it featured a nude Björk (though the nude body was usually a fitted bodysuit rigged with red string).

In 2002, t.A.T.u.&#x27;s video for &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; caused controversy as it featured the young Russian girls, Lena Katina and Yulia Volkova, embracing and eventually kissing. British TV presenters Richard and Judy campaigned to have the video banned claiming it pandered to &quot;pedophiles&quot; with the use of school uniforms and young girls kissing, although the campaign failed. Capitalizing on the controversy, the kiss was choreographed into their live performances. &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; aired the girls&#x27; performance with the kiss replaced by audience footage. NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; cut away from the girls&#x27; kiss to shots of the band. Throughout their promotional tour, t.A.T.u. protested by appearing in shirts reading &quot;censored&quot;.

In 2004, Maroon 5&#x27;s video for &quot;This Love&quot; generated controversy due to intimate scenes between the frontman Adam Levine and his then-girlfriend. Despite those particular scenes being shot at strategic angles, a censored version was released with a stream of computer-generated flowers added in to cover up more. The video for &quot;(s)AINT&quot; by Marilyn Manson was banned by their label due to its violence and sexual content. The following year, Eminem&#x27;s video for &quot;Just Lose It&quot; caused controversy over its parody of Michael Jackson&#x27;s 2005 child molestation trial, plastic surgery, and hair catching fire during the filming of a Pepsi commercial. The video was banned from BET, and Jackson spoke out against the video, calling it &quot;inappropriate and disrespectful to me, my children, my family, and the community at large&quot;. In 2004, many family groups and politicians lobbied for the banning of the Eric Prydz video &quot;Call on Me&quot; for containing women dancing in a sexually suggestive way; however, the video was not banned.

As of 2005, the Egyptian state censorship committee banned at least 20 music videos which featured sexual connotations due to Muslim moral viewpoints. The music video of &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot; which featured Jessica Simpson in character as Daisy Duke, was controversial for featuring Simpson in &quot;revealing&quot; outfits and washing the General Lee car in her bikini. The controversy resulted in the music video being banned in some countries.

In 2008, Justice&#x27;s video for their song &quot;Stress&quot; was boycotted by several major music television channels due to allegations of racism and violence; the video depicts several youths committing different crimes throughout the streets of Paris, with the youths mainly being of North African descent.

While country music has largely avoided controversy surrounding video content, it has never been immune. The music video for the 2003 Rascal Flatts song &quot;I Melt&quot; is a case in point, gaining notoriety for clips featuring guitarist Joe Don Rooney&#x27;s bare buttocks, and model Christina Auria taking a shower nude. The video was the first aired on CMT to show nudity, and eventually reached #1 on the network&#x27;s &quot;Top Twenty Countdown&quot; program. However, GAC banned the video when the group refused to release an edited version.

===2010s===
In 2010, Thirty Seconds to Mars&#x27; video &quot;Hurricane&quot; was censored due to its major elements of violence, nudity and sex. The short film was later released with a clean version that can air on television. The explicit version is available on the band&#x27;s official website with a viewing certificate of 18+.

In 2010, a rumor circulated that Lady Gaga&#x27;s video &quot;Telephone&quot; was banned by MTV, a rumour which reached some press outlets. The rumor claimed that MTV had banned the video because the content could not be shown within their programming. MTV denied the ban and showed the video frequently on European MTV programming. Lady Gaga&#x27;s previous videos have also attracted criticism for their sexually suggestive content; the video for &quot;LoveGame&quot; was not played on the Australian music video program &quot;Video Hits&quot;; however, other Australian programs aired the video uncensored. The video for &quot;Alejandro&quot; was criticized by the Catholic League, for showing the singer dressed in a red latex fetish version of a nun&#x27;s habit, simulating rape, and appearing to swallow a rosary.

Ciara&#x27;s video for &quot;Ride&quot; was banned by BET, with the network citing that the video was too sexually charged. The video was also subsequently banned by all UK television channels.

In 2011, the video for &quot;S&amp;M&quot;, which features the Barbadian singer Rihanna whipping a tied-up white man, taking hostages and indulging in a lesbian kiss, was banned in eleven countries and was flagged as inappropriate for viewers that are under 18 on YouTube.

=== 2020s ===
In 2019, Lil Nas X&#x27;s viral song &quot;Old Town Road&quot; became the longest-running number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. However, it was his follow-up song named &quot;Montero (Call Me By Your Name)&quot; which was released in 2021 that raised the controversy. In the music video for &quot;Montero&quot;, Lil Nas X included various provocative scenes, including one in which he gives a lap dance to Satan. The video was widely criticized by conservative and religious groups, who saw it as promoting Satanism and immorality. Lil Nas X responded to the backlash by defending that it was just a way of expressing his own sexuality and challenging societal norms. He made profit regarding to the controversy by promoting his own merchandise, including a pair of &quot;Satan Shoes&quot; that were made in collaboration with a company called MSCHF. A peculiar thing about these shoes are that they had real human blood in each pair. The controversy related to &quot;Montero&quot; eventually helped dragging the song to even greater success, debuting at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and earning applause from critics for its bold and innovative approach to music and visuals.

In 2023, the music video &quot;I&#x27;m Not Here to Make Friends&quot; by Sam Smith was criticised and debated about regarding whether it should be censored or not. Critics claimed that the music video was sexualised, irresponsible and improper, and not good for society, where as the discussion on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; inquired as to whether it was no different and similar to the Madonna music videos of the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s. Proponents claimed that it was not different to Rocky Horror Picture Show, or the Frankie Goes to Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;Relax&quot; music video that were successful decades ago.

In 2023, the music video &quot;Try That in a Small Town&quot; by Jason Aldean was banned by CMT due to controversy. Lyrics expressed behaviours that supposedly happen in the big cities that would be perceived to not be liked in a small town, such as, &quot;carjack an old lady&quot;; &quot;cuss out a cop&quot;; and &quot;stomp on the flag.&quot; United States State Representative Justin Jones of Tennessee, a US Democrat, condemned the song on Twitter, describing it as a &quot;heinous song calling for racist violence&quot; that promoted &quot;a shameful vision of gun extremism and vigilantism.&quot;

Aldean then defended himself on Twitter, asserting that he had been wrongly accused of releasing a pro-lynching song, and that he was &quot;not too pleased&quot; with the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests.

==Commercial release==

===Video album===

Music videos have been released commercially on physical formats such as videotape, LaserDisc, DVD and Blu-ray. Similar to an audio album, a video album is a long-form release containing multiple music videos on a disc. The market for video albums is considerably smaller than for audio albums and audio singles. Video albums are eligible for gold certifications from the Recording Industry Association of America (Recording Industry Association of America) after record labels shipped 50,000 units to retailers, while both audio albums and singles have to ship 500,000 units to achieve gold. One of the early video albums was &quot;Eat to the Beat&quot; (1979) by American rock band Blondie, a videocassette containing music videos of all tracks from their fourth studio album of the same name. It was produced by Paul Flattery for Jon Roseman Productions and directed by David Mallet. The music videos were recorded in New York and New Jersey, with some songs featuring the band playing in a concert fashion, and some others having scenarios based on the songs&#x27; lyrics. Another popular video album was &quot;Olivia Physical&quot; (1982) by Olivia Newton-John, which won the Video of the Year at the 25th Grammy Awards. The video collection features music videos of all songs from her ninth studio album, &quot;Physical&quot; (1981).

Due to the increase of video albums popularity, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine introduced the weekly best-selling music video sales ranking in the United States, titled the Top Music Videocassette chart on March 30, 1985 (now known as Music Video Sales chart). Its first chart-topper was &quot;Private Dancer&quot; (1984), a videocassette by Tina Turner containing four music videos. The Official Charts Company began the similar chart in the United Kingdom on January 30, 1994, with Bryan Adams&#x27;s &quot;So Far So Good&quot; reaching number one. According to the RIAA, the Eagles&#x27; &quot;Farewell 1 Tour-Live from Melbourne&quot; (2005) is the top-certified longform music video with 30-time platinum (three million units shipped), while the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Four Flicks&quot; (2005) is the top-certified music video boxset with 19-time platinum (1.9 million units shipped).

===Video single===
A video single contains no more than three music videos in the form of a videotape, LaserDisc or DVD. In 1983, British synthpop band The Human League released the first commercial video single titled &quot;The Human League Video Single&quot; on both VHS and Betamax. It was not a huge commercial success due to the high retail price of £10.99, compared to around £1.99 for a 7&quot; vinyl single. The VHS single gained higher levels of mainstream popularity when Madonna released &quot;Justify My Love&quot; as a video single in 1990 following the blacklisting of the video by MTV. &quot;Justify My Love&quot; remains the best-selling video single of all time.

The DVD single was introduced in the late 1990s as a replacement for the videotape single. Although many record companies in the United States refused to issue CD singles, they readily issued DVD singles, and some popular DVD singles include Kelly Clarkson&#x27;s &quot;A Moment Like This&quot;, Jessica Simpson&#x27;s &quot;With You&quot;, Beyoncé&#x27;s &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;, Christina Aguilera&#x27;s &quot;Fighter&quot;, Britney Spears&#x27;s &quot;Toxic&quot; and Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;Satellite 15... The Final Frontier&quot;. According to the RIAA, a music video single is defined as 1-2 songs per video OR under 15 minutes running time. In 2003, the first certified platinum and gold music DVD singles were certified by the RIAA. Noteworthy early DVD singles in the United States include Sly and Robbie&#x27;s &quot;Superthruster&quot; (1999), Björk&#x27;s &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot; (1999), and Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Music&quot; (2000).

In the United Kingdom where up to 3 physical formats are eligible for the chart, DVD singles are quite common (with the single available on DVD as well as CD and/or vinyl record). As with other single formats, DVD singles have a limited production run, often causing them to become collector&#x27;s items. The DVD single never experienced a high amount of popularity in the United Kingdom because when artists started releasing them in the early 2000s, the CD single had started declining. They were also seen as expensive. Some artists would not release DVD singles and instead put their music videos as enhanced content on a CD single/album.

Beginning in the early 2000s, artists in Japan may release singles in the CD+DVD format. Japanese singer Ayumi Hamasaki has been credited as the &quot;creator of the CD+DVD format&quot;; one of the examples is her 2005 single &quot;Fairyland&quot;. The CD+DVD format is more expensive and usually contains one or more music videos, and sometimes a &quot;making of&quot; section or other bonus material is included.

The Japanese music conglomerate Hello! Project released corresponding DVD singles for almost all of its CD single releases. The company calls them Single Vs. A Single V usually contains a music video for the title song plus several more of its versions and a making-of. Sometimes, an will be released at Hello! Project fan club events that will offer alternate shots of a promotional video, or bonus footage, like backstage footage or footage from a photoshoot not released anywhere else. As of 2017, Single Vs are no longer released; instead Hello! Project acts now put the music videos on DVDs included in a CD single&#x27;s limited edition. The DVD singles are popular and chart in the generic Oricon DVD sales chart, due to the non-existence of a separate DVD single ranking in Japan.

==Unofficial music videos==
Unofficial, fan-made music videos are typically made by synchronizing existing footage from other sources, such as television series or films, with the song. The first known fan video, or songvid, was created by Kandy Fong in 1975 using still images from &quot;Star Trek&quot; loaded into a slide carousel and played in conjunction with a song. Fan videos made using videocassette recorders soon followed. With the advent of easy distribution over the internet and cheap video-editing software, fan-created videos began to gain wider notice in the late 1990s.

A well-known example of an unofficial video is one made for Danger Mouse&#x27;s illegal mashup from his &quot;The Grey Album&quot;, of the Jay-Z track &quot;Encore&quot; with music sampled from the Beatles&#x27; &quot;White Album&quot;, in which concert footage of the Beatles is remixed with footage of Jay-Z and hip-hop dancers.

In 2004, a Placebo fan from South Africa made a claymation video for the band&#x27;s song &quot;English Summer Rain&quot; and sent it to the band. They liked the result so much that it was included on their greatest hits DVD.

In 2016, a Flash animation for song &quot;Come Together&quot; by the Beatles was included on The Beatles Blu-ray disc.

<doc id="90139" wikidata="Q432461" url="?curid=90139" title="Girls Just Want to Have Fun">
<text>&quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; is a single made famous in 1983–1984 by the American singer-songwriter Cyndi Lauper, written by Robert Hazard in 1979, with some of the lyrics changed by Lauper. It was released by Portrait Records as Lauper&#x27;s debut single from her first solo album, &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot; (1983). Lauper&#x27;s version gained recognition as a feminist anthem and was promoted by an MTV Video Music Award–winning music video. It has been covered by more than 30 other artists.

The single was Lauper&#x27;s breakthrough hit, reaching  2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and becoming a worldwide hit throughout late 1983 and early 1984. It is considered one of Lauper&#x27;s signature songs and was a popular song during the 1980s.

The lists &quot;&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and MTV: &#x27;100 Greatest Pop Songs&#x27;: 1–50&quot;, &quot;&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: The 100 Top Music Videos&quot; and &quot;VH1: 100 Greatest Videos&quot; ranked the song at No. 22, No. 39 and No. 45, respectively. The song received Grammy nominations for Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 27th Annual Grammy Awards.

Lauper released a new version, &quot;Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)&quot;, as the first single from her 1994 compilation album &quot;Twelve Deadly Cyns...and Then Some&quot;. It reached the top 10 in several countries. In 2013, &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; was remixed by Yolanda Be Cool for the 30th-anniversary reissue of &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot;.

==Background==
The song was written in 1979 by rock musician Robert Hazard, who performed it with various bands in the Philadelphia area, and enjoyed some local college radio airplay with a demo recording he made. Hazard wrote it as a rock song coming from the male perspective. Hazard&#x27;s friend, producer Rick Chertoff, brought it to Cyndi Lauper to record as a pop-electronic song. Lauper &quot;flipped the script&quot; and made it carry a feminist attitude by subtly changing some of the lyrics at the suggestion of Chertoff, and she had her own suggestions about how her version should sound. For the recording sessions, Chertoff brought in two longtime musician friends from the Hooters: keyboardist Rob Hyman and guitarist Eric Bazilian. Lauper later said that the Hooters were &quot;my band before I had a band.&quot; The song appeared on Lauper&#x27;s 1983 debut record &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot;.

The track is a synthesizer-backed anthem, from a feminist perspective, conveying the point that all women really want is to have the same experiences that men can have. Gillian G. Gaar, author of &quot;She&#x27;s a Rebel: The History of Women in Rock &amp; Roll&quot; (2002), described the single and corresponding video as a &quot;strong feminist statement&quot;, an &quot;anthem of female solidarity&quot; and a &quot;playful romp celebrating female camaraderie.&quot; The song is in the key of F# major.

The song&#x27;s success overshadowed Hazard&#x27;s own music career. His 1984 album &quot;Wing of Fire&quot; was a sales disappointment at the same time that Lauper&#x27;s version of &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; was going Gold, making him a millionaire. After Lauper claimed in interviews to have co-written the song, Hazard served her with a cease and desist letter. He was able to buy a New Jersey lake house and a horse farm from the song&#x27;s royalties, although he said that federal taxes took most of the money.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;Robert Hazard&#x27;s original male point of view is transformed into a cheerleader-like sing-along for party girls, and the Toni Basil–like beat is augmented by a hooky, ringing guitar.&quot;

==Chart performance==
The song was released in late 1983, but much of its success on the charts came during the first half of 1984. The single reached the Top 10 in more than 25 countries and reached No. 1 in ten of those countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway and on the Irish Singles Chart. It also reached No. 2 on both the UK Singles Chart and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In the United States, the song entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at No. 80 on December 17, 1983.

==Music video==

The release of the single was accompanied by a quirky music video. It cost less than US$35,000 (), largely due to a volunteer cast and the free loan of the most sophisticated video equipment available at the time. The cast included Lauper&#x27;s close friend, professional wrestler/manager &quot;Captain&quot; Lou Albano in the role of Lauper&#x27;s father while her real mother, Catrine, played herself. Lauper later appeared in World Wrestling Federation storylines opposite Albano and guest-starred on &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!&quot; episode &quot;Robo Koopa/Captain Lou is Missing&quot;, in which Albano portrayed Mario (Albano also played himself in the episode). This collaboration was the catalyst for the &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling&quot; connection that lasted for the following two years. Lauper&#x27;s attorney, Elliot Hoffman, appeared as her uptight dancing partner. Also in the cast were Lauper&#x27;s manager, David Wolf, her brother, Butch Lauper, fellow musician Steve Forbert, and a bevy of secretaries borrowed from Portrait/CBS, Lauper&#x27;s record label. A clip of the 1923 film &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; is featured as Lauper watches it on television.

&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; creator Lorne Michaels, another of Hoffman&#x27;s clients, agreed to give Lauper free run of his brand new million-dollar digital editing equipment, with which she and her producer created several first-time-ever computer-generated images of Lauper dancing with her buttoned-up lawyer Hoffman, leading the entire cast in a snake-dance through New York streets and ending up in Lauper&#x27;s bedroom in her home. The bedroom scene is an homage to the famous stateroom scene in the Marx Brothers&#x27; film &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; (1935).

&quot;The year 1983 makes a watershed in the history of female-address video. It is the year that certain issues and representations began to gain saliency and the textual strategies of female address began to coalesce.&quot; In the video, Lauper wanted to show in a more fun and light-hearted manner that girls want the same equality and recognition boys had in society.

Before the song starts, the beginning of her version of &quot;He&#x27;s So Unusual&quot; plays.

The music video was directed by Edd Griles. The producer was Ken Walz while the cinematographer was Francis Kenny. The treatment for the video was co-written by Griles, Walz, and Lauper. The video was shot in the Lower East Side of Manhattan in summer 1983 and premiered on television in December 1983. The choreography was by a New York dance and music troupe called XXY featuring Mary Ellen Strom, Cyndi Lee and Pierce Turner.

The music video crossed one billion views on YouTube in January 2022.

==&quot;Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)&quot;==
On September 5, 1994, Lauper released a new version, &quot;Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)&quot;, as the first single of her first compilation album, &quot;Twelve Deadly Cyns...and Then Some&quot; (1994). It incorporates a reggae feel and an interpolation of &quot;Come and Get Your Love&quot; by Redbone. The arrangement evolved as she experimented with the song&#x27;s style over the course of the 1993–1994 Hat Full of Stars Tour.

The single reached the top 10 in several countries. It reached number 4 in the UK, becoming Lauper&#x27;s first top-10 hit there since 1989 with &quot;I Drove All Night&quot;. It reached number 4 in New Zealand. In the US, it reached number 87 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Lauper directed a new music video for the song.

===Critical reception===
Steve Baltin from &quot;Cash Box&quot; noted that the &quot;reggae-flavored dance oriented remake&quot; is being given a big boost from the film &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything, Julie Newmar&quot;. He added, &quot;Lauper still sounds in fine form on the very easy going kick-back track. Particularly fun is the jammin&#x27; guitar solo bridge in the middle of the single.&quot; In his weekly UK chart commentary, James Masterton said, &quot;The new version slows the track down to turn it into a far slinkier dance groove to quite inspired effect&quot;. Alan Jones from &quot;Music Week&quot; wrote, &quot;Turning a familiar old favourite into a dance groove unusually required a drop in tempo here, reducing it to a slinky shuffle. The melody and Cyndi&#x27;s excellent vocals are still its selling points, and the success of Cyndi&#x27;s &quot;Twelve Deadly Cyns&quot; album suggests the timing could be right to make this a hit again.&quot; Tommy Udo of &quot;NME&quot; considered it a &quot;totally unnecessary reworking&quot; and commented, &quot;It just sounds like somebody&#x27;s hamfisted and amateurish remix that would normally be hidden away as track 18 – you know, the Will This Do? Mix by DJ Krap – although oddly enough, Cyndi herself had a hand in it all.&quot; He concluded, &quot;She could still be bigger than Madonna!&quot;

===Music video===
A music video was produced to promote the new version, directed by Cyndi Lauper herself and later made available on YouTube in 2010. It had generated more than 4.2 million views as of December 2022.

<doc id="90140" wikidata="Q2299957" url="?curid=90140" title="True Colors (Cyndi Lauper album)">
<text>True Colors is the second studio album by American singer Cyndi Lauper, released on September 15, 1986, by Portrait Records. The album spawned several commercially successful singles as &quot;True Colors&quot;, &quot;Change of Heart&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; reached the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with the first two charting within the top five. The album was produced by Lauper herself together with Lennie Petze.

Upon its release, the album received generally positive reviews from music critics. The album earned Lauper several awards and accolades, including two nominations at the 29th Annual Grammy Awards. &quot;True Colors&quot; peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The album is Lauper&#x27;s second best-selling release with around seven million copies worldwide.

== Background and production ==
By the end of 1985, Lauper was established as one of the best-selling artists in the world. Her first studio album &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot; (1983) was certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and received a diamond certification in Canada for sales in excess of one million copies, making her the first singer to achieve such a feat at that time. According to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, the music industry was eyeing the singer&#x27;s next steps anxious to know if she could maintain the success of her debut.

In her autobiography, the singer says that she initially planned for Rick Chertoff, who produced &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot;, to produce what would become her second album; however, the experience with him was problematic and she changed her mind, and she likewise refused to produce the album with Rob Hyman since he was affiliated with Chertoff. &quot;True Colors&quot; was then produced by her and Lennie Petze, with Lauper also composing most of the songs on the album.

&quot;The second album says, &#x27;Have the courage of your convictions and love yourself a little&#x27;,&quot; Lauper told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1986, adding that she wanted its songs &quot;to say, &#x27;Love yourself&#x27;, because we really are taught not to. When babies are born, they&#x27;re just nuts about everything about themselves. Then, as we get older, we&#x27;re taught that, oooh, that&#x27;s disgusting, and that if we like ourselves then that&#x27;s considered conceit. That&#x27;s part of the album, too—not to be so hard on yourself.&quot;

The title song, written by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly, has been covered by many other artists, and was used as the theme song for the 1988 Summer Olympics, the 2003 Rugby World Cup and for Kodak cameras and film.

In 2010, the song was also featured on the soundtrack of &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot;. &quot;True Colors&quot; was reissued in a Japanese exclusive limited edition box set 11-track digitally remastered CD album.

==Critical reception==
&quot;True Colors&quot; received favorable reviews from music critics. In the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Lynn Van Matre praised it as a &quot;winning effort&quot; with &quot;plenty of fun&quot;, while Ian Cranna singled out Lauper&#x27;s &quot;outstanding, marvellous voice&quot; for praise in &quot;Q&quot;, stating that &quot;she breathes life into the songs, and slowly but surely the strengths of this LP begin to reveal themselves through the unorthodox structures and treatments.&quot; Jimmy Guterman from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that Lauper &quot;sounds more comfortable at any given moment on &quot;True Colors&quot; than she did on all of &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot;&quot;, and that the album &quot;seems to indicate her extreme ease in her new surroundings&quot;. Noting that &quot;she&#x27;s found a new sense of peace—or at least she&#x27;s heading in that direction&quot;, Guterman also opined, however, that &quot;her uneasiness gave her early work much of its spark; what places &quot;True Colors&quot; a notch below her debut is that Cyndi Lauper just isn&#x27;t that unusual anymore.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau was less impressed, commenting that the first side of the LP consists of &quot;cheap sentiment&quot; and is &quot;disheartening&quot; and that &quot;the second isn&#x27;t much more than a relief&quot;, before concluding, &quot;girls just want to have money—and no fun changes everything.&quot;

In a retrospective assessment for AllMusic, Eugene Chadbourne wrote that while &quot;True Colors&quot; is &quot;ambitious&quot; and &quot;some of the stretches really pay off&quot;, some of its aspects &quot;date badly&quot;, like the &quot;highly reverberated and artificial sounding drums and keyboards&quot; which &quot;were really popular at the time&quot;. He concluded that despite those problems &quot;there really wasn&#x27;t that much music recorded by this artist during her most popular period, so fans will no doubt want to own it all.&quot; Writing for &quot;Classic Pop&quot;, John Earls said that although the album&#x27;s &quot;unusually subdued&quot; cover songs &quot;suggested severe writers&#x27; block&quot;, the remaining tracks &quot;had no such worries, whether in the peerless title track or the doo-wop delight in &#x27;Change of Heart&#x27;.&quot;

Le Guide du CD/FNAC of France gave the album between 4-5 Stars, &quot;“The second album by the craziest redhead of American Pop, True Colors follows the huge hit album, She’s So Unusual. Inhabiting the youthful energy that characterizes her, Cyndi Lauper reuses the recipe for success of her first album, with a touch of maturity, makes this opus an accomplished album. Her cover of “What’s Going On,” by Marvin Gaye, and the hits “True Colors” and “Change Of Heart,” propels the album and confirms the influence of the artist.”

The pan-European magazine &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; named &quot;True Colors&quot; one of its &quot;albums of the week&quot; in the issue dated October 4, 1986. The magazine felt the album &quot;boasted several hit singles&quot;, noting the album began &quot;confidently&quot; with &quot;Change of Heart&quot;, had a &quot;striking&quot; cover of Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, with &quot;good build up and atmosphere&quot;, and showcased &quot;terrific vocal form&quot; on the song &quot;Boy Blue&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
In the United States, &quot;True Colors&quot; has been certified double platinum by the RIAA and peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It topped the Australian chart for four weeks and, in Japan, outsold &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot;, although that was not the case in most countries. The album produced the singles &quot;True Colors&quot; (No. 1 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100), &quot;Change of Heart&quot; (No. 3), &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; (No. 12), and &quot;Boy Blue&quot; (No. 71). Each single had a music video although the video for &quot;Boy Blue&quot; was just a live performance from her Zenith concert in Paris. According to Lauper&#x27;s official website, the album was certified 4× Platinum in Australia and Platinum in Italy. The album sold around 7 million copies worldwide.

<doc id="90141" wikidata="Q375419" url="?curid=90141" title="Corey Feldman">
<text>Corey Scott Feldman (born July 16, 1971) is an American actor and musician. As a youth, he became well known for his roles in popular 1980s films such as &quot;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter&quot; (1984), &quot;Gremlins&quot; (1984), &quot;The Goonies&quot; (1985) and &quot;Stand by Me&quot; (1986). Feldman collaborated with Corey Haim starring in numerous films such as the comedy horror &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; (1987), the teen comedy &quot;License to Drive&quot; (1988) and the romantic comedy &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot; (1989). They reunited for the A&amp;E reality series &quot;The Two Coreys&quot;, which ran from 2007 to 2008.

Feldman experienced diminishing success in the film industry as an adult, amid well-publicized personal conflicts with Haim over Haim&#x27;s substance abuse and with Michael Jackson, who had befriended him during his time as a teen celebrity. While he has been outspoken about sexual abuse in the entertainment industry, he has also faced public scrutiny over Corey&#x27;s Angels and has also been accused of sexual misconduct. Feldman has released six albums, including &quot;Love Left&quot; (1992), &quot;Former Child Actor&quot; (2002), and &quot;Angelic 2 the Core&quot; (2016).

==Early life==
Corey Scott Feldman was born on July 16, 1971, in Reseda, California, the son of Bob and Sheila (née. Goldstein) Feldman, a musician and a cocktail waitress, respectively. He was raised Jewish. Feldman has claimed that his parents exploited him for his earning potential as a child actor, and that his mother was abusive. She has denied his accusations.

==Career==
===1980–1989: Teen years and breakthrough ===
Feldman started his career at the age of three, appearing in a McDonald&#x27;s commercial. In his youth, he appeared in over 100 television commercials and on 50 television series, including &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot;, &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;, &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;, &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, &quot;Madame&#x27;s Place&quot;, and &quot;Cheers&quot;. He was in the films &quot;Time After Time&quot; and Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot;. In 1981, he appeared in NBC&#x27;s musical comedy children&#x27;s special &quot;How to Eat Like a Child&quot; alongside other future child stars Billy Jayne and Georg Olden. In 1982, he portrayed &quot;Little Big&quot; Jim Malloy in the single-episode situation comedy &quot;Cass Malloy&quot;, which served as the pilot for the later sitcom &quot;She&#x27;s the Sheriff&quot;.
Feldman became known as a teen idol in the 1980s. During the mid-to-late 1980s, he &quot;was known for being one of the most popular teen pin-ups in the world&quot;. He was featured in several consecutive high-grossing movies during this period; those movies included &quot;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter&quot; (1984), &quot;Gremlins&quot; (1984), &quot;Friday the 13th: A New Beginning&quot; (1985), &quot;The Goonies&quot; (1985), and &quot;Stand By Me&quot; (1986) as Teddy Duchamp, the latter alongside River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, and Jerry O&#x27;Connell. In 1987, Feldman appeared with Corey Haim in &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;, in which he played Edgar Frog, a role he reprised in two direct-to-video sequels years later, &quot;Lost Boys: The Tribe&quot; (2008) and &quot;Lost Boys: The Thirst&quot; (2010). &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; marked the first onscreen pairing of Feldman and Haim, who became known as &quot;The Two Coreys&quot;. The pair went on to star in a string of films, including &quot;License to Drive&quot; (1988) and &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot; (1989). Feldman also voiced the character of Donatello in the original live action &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; movie.

===1990–present: Career fluctuations ===
After a public battle with drugs (which began shortly after filming concluded for &quot;The &#x27;Burbs&quot; in 1989), Feldman fought to re-establish his life and career by working with youths, starring in several lesser-known films, and branching out with an album titled &quot;Love Left&quot;. He returned to the big screen with &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III&quot;, once again providing the voice of Donatello, and starred in the Richard Donner/Robert Zemeckis/Joel Silver film &quot;Tales From The Crypt Presents: Bordello of Blood&quot; opposite Dennis Miller and Angie Everhart.

In 1995, Feldman starred with Haim in their last mainstream film together, &quot;Dream a Little Dream 2&quot;. In the late 1990s, Feldman starred in the CBS series &quot;Dweebs&quot;. In 1996, Feldman appeared alongside his former &quot;Stand By Me&quot; co-star Jerry O&#x27;Connell in &quot;Electric Twister Acid Test&quot;, an episode of the Fox Network series &quot;Sliders&quot;. In 1999, he appeared as Officer Corey Feldman in the music video for the New Found Glory single &quot;Hit or Miss&quot;. In the same year, he made an appearance in the television series &quot;The Crow: Stairway to Heaven&quot;. In 2003, he appeared in the celebrity-driven reality series &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; on The WB. He also made a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star&quot; starring David Spade. He appeared in the theatrical release &quot;My Date with Drew&quot; and was the voice of &quot;Sprx-77&quot; in the Toon Disney/ABC Family series &quot;Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!&quot;.

In 2005, Feldman starred as Michael Douglas in the Off-Broadway play Fatal Attraction: A Greek Tragedy, a parody of the 1987 film Fatal Attraction. In 2007, Feldman and Haim began a reality television series titled &quot;The Two Coreys&quot; on the A&amp;E Network. In January 2008, they started production on the second series of &quot;The Two Coreys&quot;. He was also executive producer for both seasons. In January 2012, Feldman joined the British television series &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; with American pair skater Brooke Castile. On October 28, 2013, Feldman released his first memoir, &quot;Coreyography&quot;. The book details his early life as a child actor all the way up to the death of Corey Haim. It also discusses his struggles with addiction and as a victim of Hollywood child sexual abuse. In April 2018, Feldman was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the third annual Young Entertainer Awards.

In October 2019, Feldman appeared in an episode of &quot;Marriage Boot Camp.&quot; In September 2020, he filed a lawsuit against We TV and Think Factory Media for emotional abuse, claiming he was held &quot;hostage&quot; on the set. He also claimed that We TV &quot;falsified information to the public, and discredited Mr. Feldman as a liar on their show.&quot; and alleged that Marriage Boot Camp &quot;glamorized abuse&quot; and caused &quot;distress&quot;. In March 2021, he dropped his lawsuit against We TV. Court records did not indicate whether they reached a settlement.

Feldman became friends with director Jordan Peele who called him, &quot;one of the greatest teen icons of all time&quot;. In 2023, Peele programmed screenings of Feldman&#x27;s film &quot;The Birthday&quot; (2005) at Film at Lincoln Center. Peele described the film as &quot;a WTF did I just watch experience&quot; comparing it to &quot;Nope&quot; saying both films are about &quot;exploitation and erasure&quot;.

In 2024, Feldman competed in season eleven of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as the wild card contestant &quot;Seal&quot;. While eliminated in the Group B finals alongside Clay Aiken and Ruben Studdard as &quot;Beets&quot;, there were references to his interactions with Jenny McCarthy.

== Music career ==
Feldman says his greatest influence has been his idol Michael Jackson. Feldman said he studied his dance moves and fashion style and &quot;copied him effortlessly&quot;. His first public dancing experience was when he was 12 years old he lip synched Michael Jackson&#x27;s song &quot;Billie Jean&quot;.

In 1992, he released his first album &quot;Love Left&quot;. He then released his second album, &quot;Still Searching for Soul&quot; (1999), with his band, Corey Feldman&#x27;s Truth Movement. In 2002, Feldman released a solo album, &quot;Former Child Actor&quot;, and promoted it with a second US tour. He appeared in the music video for the Moby single &quot;We Are All Made of Stars&quot;.

In 2010, Feldman made an appearance in the music video for the single &quot;1983&quot; by Neon Trees. In 2011, he also appeared in the music video for the Katy Perry single &quot;Last Friday Night&quot;. In April 2013, Feldman also appeared in the music video for the Mac Miller single &quot;S.D.S.&quot;. In October 2013, He appeared in the music video for &quot;City of Angels&quot; by Thirty Seconds to Mars.

In 2016 to promote his double album &quot;Angelic 2 the Core&quot;, he performed with &quot;Corey&#x27;s Angels&quot; on the &quot;Today Show&quot;. The album was a tribute to Michael Jackson and Corey Haim but the performance went viral with many online mocking it including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; who labeled it &quot;bizarre&quot;. Anthony Fantano ranked it as both the worst album of 2016 and the 2010s.

In 2023, Feldman performed at the punk rock music festival Riot Fest in Chicago, Illinois. The booking of Feldman was met with criticism. Julie River of &quot;New Noise Magazine&quot; wrote, &quot;Booking Corey Feldman for this show felt a little bit mean-spirited. If you&#x27;ve ever seen a video of Feldman performing live, you&#x27;ll notice it&#x27;s completely overdone, pretentious, and just outright bizarre.&quot; River described the performance writing, &quot;The music is mediocre at best, but Feldman&#x27;s choreography and stage theatrics are positively laughable... Feldman spent an inordinate amount of time on stage complaining about his ex-wives, which felt like a Hollywood cliché and a tad misogynistic&quot;.

In February 2025, Feldman&#x27;s drummer Duke Gadd died from a fentanyl overdose.

== Controversy ==

=== Corey&#x27;s Angels ===

In 2015, Feldman and his then-girlfriend, Courtney Anne Mitchell, appeared in an episode of the fourth season of the reality television series &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot;. His girlfriend swapped with actor/comedian Tommy Davidson&#x27;s fiancée, Amanda. Feldman sees himself as a Hugh Hefner-like manager over the group of women known as &quot;Corey&#x27;s Angels&quot;. Feldman states that he had helped women get careers in life but through his company, Corey&#x27;s Angels, he can have control over them and financially benefit. In the episode Feldman tells these women what to wear, eat, and do whatever he tells them to. Some viewers found the episode disturbing and creepy. &quot;Corey&#x27;s Angels&quot; is a musical group Feldman created.

In September 2016, he made an appearance on the &quot;Today&quot; program to support his album &quot;Angelic 2 the Core&quot;, which sparked backlash for its unusual nature. Following the &quot;Today&quot; show appearance Feldman had an interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; where he discussed the creation of &quot;Corey&#x27;s Angels&quot;. He said he met women at the Playboy Mansion who had dreams of acting and singing and stated, &quot;I like helping them...to help girls who were kind of lost and needed help to find their way&quot;. He described the situation as a &quot;360 management, development and production entity.&quot; He added that they sought out girls who were 18 who he thought were &quot;virtuous, and honest and loyal&quot;. Feldman was asked about a contract shown in the &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot; episode and he stated while it was not entirely real, &quot;there are certain rules that we have. That&#x27;s what they based that contract on.&quot; Feldman stated the point of the organization is to see &quot;if we could get in and mold them while they&#x27;re still young and impressionable, while they&#x27;re moldable, so to speak, we can help them make the right choices.&quot; Feldman denied any allegations the company was degrading to women.

==Personal life==
Feldman stated that he began the &quot;Emancipation Proclamation in Hollywood&quot; at age 15, when he was granted emancipation from his parents. He stated that he was worth $1 million by age 15, and by the time the judge ordered the bank records to come forward, only $40,000 remained.

On March 28, 2018, Feldman claimed that he received a small puncture wound and admitted himself to a hospital. It was later reported by the police that he had no lacerations.

Feldman is a Democrat and an advocate for animal welfare and animal rights; he has adhered to a vegetarian diet since his youth. He appeared with his wife in a PETA ad campaign promoting vegetarianism. He was awarded the Paws of Fame Award by the Wildlife WayStation for his dedication to animal rights. Feldman holds beliefs in the paranormal.

=== Drug and alcohol abuse ===
Feldman has spoken publicly about his struggles with drug addiction and alcoholism, which he said started due to abuse from his mother and his sexual abuse while in the film industry. In September 1990, it was reported that he had been charged with possession of heroin in what was described as his second narcotics-related charge since March 1990. He has said that he underwent a 10-month rehabilitation process to recover from his addiction to heroin.

In October 2016, he denied being on drugs when he performed on the &quot;Today&quot; program the previous month. In October 2017, his band was pulled over in Mangham, Louisiana. His security guard and four other members of his group were charged with drug crimes, including possession of Xanax.

===Friendship with Corey Haim===
Feldman and fellow actor Corey Haim were close friends. Feldman first met Haim at the age of 14 on the set of &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;, a film in which they both acted. The two became known as &quot;The Two Coreys&quot;. The Two Coreys &quot;became the hosts of a weekly underage party night for Hollywood Youth called Alphy&#x27;s Soda Pop Club&quot;.

The Two Coreys went on to star in &quot;License to Drive&quot; (1988) and &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot; (1989) together. Becoming a brand, The Two Coreys achieved mainstream fame and notoriety as teen idols. However, both Feldman and Haim experienced career downturns due to drug use.

&quot;The Two Coreys&quot;, a reality show about The Two Coreys, aired on the A&amp;E Network from 2007 to 2008. The disintegrating relationship between the former best friends prompted a six-month hiatus before the second season. Before Haim&#x27;s death, he and Feldman reconciled off-camera.

Following a long battle with drug addiction, Haim died of pneumonia in 2010. Following Haim&#x27;s death, Feldman said that he &quot;hoped his friend would be remembered &#x27;as a beautiful, funny, enigmatic character who brought nothing but life and lights and entertainment and art to all of our lives&#x27;&quot;.

In 2020, Feldman released &quot;My Truth: The Rape of 2 Coreys&quot;. The documentary explores the friendship between Feldman and Haim and asserts that both were sexually abused as children in the entertainment industry.

===Friendship with Michael Jackson===
Feldman was close friends with Michael Jackson, as a child and teenager. In his book &quot;Coreyography&quot; and several interviews, he wrote and spoke about his positive childhood experiences with Jackson: &quot;Michael Jackson&#x27;s world, crazy as it sounds, had become my happy place... When I was with Michael, it was like being ten years old again.&quot;

In 2001, their friendship ended because Jackson thought, based on erroneous information, that Feldman would negatively portray him in an upcoming book. Feldman claimed that on September 11, 2001, Jackson helped get Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor and Liza Minnelli out of New York City, but did not help him. He in turn retaliated with the song, &quot;Megalo Man&quot;, featuring the lyrics: &#x27;I believed in your words/I believed in your lies/But in September in New York/You left me to die/I love you, Megalo Man.&#x27;

In February 2005, Feldman was subpoenaed to testify against Jackson in the singer&#x27;s child molestation trial. Ultimately, he did not testify. Feldman said, &quot;I started looking at each piece of information, and with that came this sickening realization that there have been many occurrences in my life and in my relationship to Michael that have created a question of doubt&quot;. Although he was adamant that Jackson never touched him, Feldman recounted that when he was 13 or 14 years old, Jackson once showed him a book that was &quot;focused on venereal diseases and the genitalia&quot;. As an adult, Feldman saw this behavior as inappropriate but he later described the incident as Jackson &quot;just being parental for a boy who had no guidance&quot;.

When Jackson died in 2009, Feldman dedicated a Los Angeles hospital concert with his rock band, Truth Movement, to the singer.

In 2013, Feldman spoke out in defense of Jackson in the wake of the sexual molestation accusations made by Wade Robson. He explicitly denied that Michael Jackson had molested children. In 2017, Feldman asserted that efforts were made to frame Jackson in order to bury Feldman&#x27;s allegations of abuse against others.

After new accusations against Jackson were raised in 2019 by the documentary film &quot;Leaving Neverland&quot;, Feldman repeated that Jackson had never acted inappropriately towards him and called the documentary &quot;one-sided&quot;. Two days later, he changed his stance, saying he could &quot;no longer defend&quot; Jackson and adding, &quot;It comes to a point where as an advocate for victims... it becomes impossible for me to remain virtuous and not at least consider what&#x27;s being said.&quot; However, in December 2019, Feldman stated in a tweet: &quot;I stand [with] all victims. However that will never negate the times &amp; memories we shared. Those were [our] experiences &amp; while I was a victim of molestation, my time [with] MJ was pure &amp; innocent, &amp; that is the person I choose [to] remember&quot;.

===Marriages and relationships===
Feldman was married to actress Vanessa Marcil from 1989 until 1993.

He met actress and model Susie Sprague in a nightclub in January 2002 and they married on October 30 that year on the final episode of the first season of &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;. The ceremony was co-officiated by a rabbi and by MC Hammer, an ordained minister. In October 2009, the couple split after seven years of marriage. Later that month, Sprague filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. She sought full custody of their son, with Feldman having visitation rights. She also sought spousal support. Feldman sought joint custody and wanted the court to block Sprague&#x27;s spousal support demand. After a five-year process, the couple&#x27;s divorce became final in 2014.

On November 22, 2016, Feldman married his long-time girlfriend, Courtney Anne Mitchell. The ceremony was officiated by television producer Marklen Kennedy, at Elton John&#x27;s Fizz champagne lounge at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. In August 2023, after 7 years it was announced that Feldman was divorcing Courtney amid her continued health issues.

===Sexual abuse allegations made by Feldman===
Feldman contends that sex abuse of child actors is a widespread problem in show business. On October 25, 2017, in response to the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations, he started an Indiegogo campaign to finance a film about his life to expose the secret child sexual abuse that he claims is just as common in Hollywood as sexism and sexual assault against adults. In March 2018, he spoke at the New York State Capitol in Albany, New York, in support of the Child Victims Act, which would lengthen the statute of limitations for civil claims arising out of acts of child sex abuse and would create a one-year period in which sex abuse survivors could bring civil claims that were then barred by the statute of limitations.

As an adult, Feldman has claimed that he is a survivor of child sexual abuse. According to him, he was molested by a man he first identified only as the alias &quot;Ron Crimson&quot;, who worked as an assistant to Feldman&#x27;s father. Feldman has indicated that &quot;Ron&quot; facilitated his initiation into drug addiction. Feldman later identified that man as actor and former personal assistant Cloyd Jon Grissom. He also accused child agent Marty Weiss and former talent agent and Hollywood underage club owner Alphy Hoffman of having sexually abused him.

During an October 2013 episode of &quot;The View&quot; while Feldman was promoting his autobiography &quot;Coreyography&quot;, Barbara Walters said that Feldman was &quot;damaging an entire industry&quot; with his allegations. In March 2020, in his documentary &quot;(My) Truth: The Rape of Two Coreys&quot;, Feldman repeated a claim that the actor Charlie Sheen had raped his 13-year-old co-star Corey Haim on the set of the film &quot;Lucas&quot;. The claim was corroborated by his ex-wife Susie Feldman and his &quot;Lost Boys&quot; co-star Jamison Newlander. Sheen, through his publicist, denied the allegations, calling them &quot;sick, twisted and outlandish&quot;. Haim&#x27;s mother Judy had identified a different actor as her son&#x27;s rapist on &quot;The Dr. Oz Show&quot; and told &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; that Sheen never raped her son, calling the claims &quot;made up&quot;.

=== Sexual misconduct allegations against Feldman ===
In January 2018, Feldman was under investigation by police on charges of sexual battery. However, Feldman was cleared of all charges the following month.

In June 2020, Feldman removed himself from the SAG-AFTRA Sexual Harassment Committee after SAG-AFTRA had issued a resolution to remove him from the committee following a number of sexual misconduct allegations that were made. Former members of Corey&#x27;s Angels have come forward and accused Feldman of having &quot;abused, sexually harassed and taken advantage of them&quot;. These women include: Jacqueline Von Rueden, Poeina Suddarth, Margot Lane, Chantal Knippenburg, Amy Clark, Mara Moon, Jezebel Sweet, and Krystal Khali, who detailed information relating to Feldman&#x27;s conduct with women. The SAG-AFTRA national board resolution also stated that there had been &quot;formal complaints to law enforcement, including the Los Angeles Police Department,&quot; against Feldman, and added that &quot;investigations are currently ongoing into the allegations of sexual harassment&quot;.

<text>Moshe Dayan (; May 20, 1915 – October 16, 1981) was an Israeli military leader and politician. As commander of the Jerusalem front in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces (1953–1958) during the 1956 Sinai War, and as Defense Minister during the Six-Day War in 1967, he became a worldwide fighting symbol of the new state of Israel.

In the 1930s, Dayan joined the Haganah, the pre-state Jewish defense force of Mandatory Palestine. He served in the Special Night Squads under Orde Wingate during the Arab revolt in Palestine and later lost an eye to a sniper in a raid on Vichy forces in Lebanon during World War II. Dayan was close to David Ben-Gurion and joined him in leaving the Mapai party and setting up the Rafi party in 1965 with Shimon Peres. Dayan became Defence Minister just before the 1967 Six-Day War. After the Yom Kippur War of late 1973, during which Dayan served as Defense Minister, he was blamed for the lack of preparedness, and he resigned along with the rest of Meir&#x27;s government in early 1974. In 1977, following the election of Menachem Begin as Prime Minister, Dayan was expelled from the Israeli Labor Party because he joined the Likud-led government as Foreign Minister, playing an important part in negotiating the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.

==Early life==
Moshe Dayan was born on 20 May 1915 in Kibbutz Degania Alef, near the Sea of Galilee in Palestine, in what was then Ottoman Syria within the Ottoman Empire, one of three children born to Shmuel and Devorah Dayan, Ukrainian Jewish immigrants from Zhashkiv. Kibbutz Degania Alef, with 11 members, was the first kibbutz, and would become part of the State of Israel.

Dayan was the second child born at Degania, after Gideon Baratz (1913–1988). He was named Moshe after Moshe Barsky, the first member of Degania to be killed in an Arab attack, who died getting medication for Dayan&#x27;s father. Soon afterward, Dayan&#x27;s parents moved to Nahalal, the first &quot;moshav&quot;, or farming cooperative, to be established. Dayan attended the agricultural school there.

Dayan was a Jewish atheist. He spoke Hebrew, Arabic, and English.

==Military==

At the age of 14, Dayan joined the Jewish defence force Haganah. In 1938, he joined the British-organised irregular Supernumerary Police and led a small motorized patrol (&quot;MAN&quot;). One of his military heroes was the British pro-Zionist intelligence officer Orde Wingate, under whom he served in several Special Night Squads operations.
On 3 October 1939, he was the commanding instructor for Haganah Leader&#x27;s courses held at Yavniel when two British Palestine Police officers discovered a quantity of illegal rifles. Haganah HQ ordered the camp evacuated. Leading a group of 43 men through Wadi Bira, early the following morning, 12 to 15 Arab members of the Transjordan Frontier Force arrested them. Questions were asked about how such a large force was arrested by a much smaller one. Moshe Carmel, the group&#x27;s deputy commander, was also critical of Dayan&#x27;s willingness to talk to his interrogators in Acre Prison. On 30 October 1939, most of the group were sentenced to 10 years in prison. Seven months later, Dayan was replaced as the prisoners&#x27; representative after it was discovered that moves were being made to get him an individual pardon. On 16 February 1941, after Chaim Weizmann&#x27;s intervention in London, they were all released.

Dayan was assigned to a small Australian-led reconnaissance task force, which also included fellow Palmach members and Arab guides, formed in preparation for the Allied invasion of Syria and Lebanon and attached to the Australian 7th Division. Using his home kibbutz of Hanita as a forward base, the unit frequently infiltrated Vichy French Lebanon, wearing traditional Arab dress, on covert surveillance missions.

==Eye patch==

On 7 June 1941, the night before the invasion of the Syria–Lebanon Campaign, Dayan&#x27;s unit crossed the border and secured two bridges over the Litani River. During the time, Dayan served under the command of British Lieutenant General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson. When they were not relieved as expected, at 04:00 on 8 June, the unit perceived that it was exposed to possible attack and—on its own initiative—assaulted a nearby Vichy police station, capturing it. A few hours later, as Dayan was on the roof of the building using binoculars to scan Vichy French positions on the other side of the river, the binoculars were struck by a French rifle bullet fired by a sniper from several hundred yards away, propelling metal and glass fragments into his left eye and causing severe damage. Six hours passed before he could be evacuated. Dayan lost the eye. In addition, the damage to the extraocular muscles was such that Dayan could not be fitted with a glass eye, and he was compelled to adopt the black eye patch that became his trademark.
Letters from this time revealed that despite losing his left eye and suffering serious injuries to the area where the eye was located, Dayan still pleaded with Wilson to be reenlisted in combat. He also underwent eye surgery in 1947 at a hospital in Paris, which proved to be unsuccessful.

In the years immediately following, the disability caused him some psychological pain. Dayan wrote in his autobiography: &quot;I reflected with considerable misgivings on my future as a cripple without a skill, trade, or profession to provide for my family.&quot; He added that he was &quot;ready to make any effort and stand any suffering, if only I could get rid of my black eyepatch. The attention it drew was intolerable to me. I preferred to shut myself up at home, doing anything, rather than encounter the reactions of people wherever I went.&quot;

==Military career==

In 1947, Dayan was appointed to the Haganah General Staff working on Arab affairs, in particular recruiting agents to gain information about irregular Arab forces in Palestine. On 14 April 1948, his brother, Zorik, was killed in fighting. On 22 April, Dayan was put in charge of abandoned Arab property in newly conquered Haifa. To put a stop to the out-of-control looting, he ordered that anything that could be used by the army be stored in Haganah warehouses and the rest be distributed amongst Jewish agricultural settlements. On 18 May, Dayan was given command of the Jordan Valley sector. In a nine-hour battle, his troops stopped the Syrian advance south of the Sea of Galilee.

===89th Battalion===
In June, he became the first commander of the 89th Battalion, part of Sadeh&#x27;s Armoured Brigade. His methods of recruiting volunteers from other army units, such as the Golani and Kiryati Brigades, provoked complaints from their commanders. On 20 June 1948, two men from one of his companies were killed in a confrontation with Irgun members trying to bring weapons ashore from the Altalena at Kfar Vitkin. During Operation Danny, he led his battalion in a brief raid through Lod in which nine of his men were killed. His battalion was then transferred to the south, where they captured Karatiya, close to Faluja on 15 July. His withdrawal of his troops after only two hours, leaving a company from the Givati Brigade to face an Egyptian counterattack led to Givati Commander Shimon Avidan demanding that Dayan be disciplined. Chief of the General Staff Yigael Yadin instructed the military attorney general to proceed, but the case was dismissed.

===Jerusalem===

On 23 July 1948, on David Ben-Gurion&#x27;s insistence over General Staff opposition, Dayan was appointed military commander of Jewish-controlled areas of Jerusalem. In this post, he launched two military offensives. Both were night-time operations and both failed. On 17 August, he sent two companies to attempt to occupy the hillsides around Government House, but they retreated suffering casualties. On the night of 20 October 1948, to coincide with the end of Operation Yoav further south, &quot;Operation Wine Press&quot; was launched. Its objective was to capture Bethlehem via Beit Jala. Six companies set out but were pinned down by machine-gun fire in the wadi below Beit Jala and were forced to withdraw.

Following the 17 September 1948 assassination of Count Folke Bernadotte, it was over 20 hours before he imposed a curfew over Jewish Jerusalem and began arresting members of Lehi, the underground organisation believed to be responsible. One reason for this delay was the need to bring loyal troops from Tel Aviv into the city.

On 20 October 1948, Dayan commanded the 800-strong Etzioni Brigade during the ill-fated &quot;Operation Yeqev&quot;, in which the objectives were to join the Harel Brigade in the capture of the mountain range overlooking Beit Jala. The mission was called-off because of misguided navigation, and Ben Gurion&#x27;s fear of upsetting the Christian world at Israel&#x27;s capture of Christian sites. A ceasefire went into effect on the 22nd of October.

In the autumn of 1948, he was involved in negotiations with Abdullah el Tell, the Jordanian military commander of East Jerusalem, over a lasting cease-fire for the Jerusalem area. In 1949, he had at least five face-to-face meetings with King Abdullah of Jordan over the Armistice Agreement and the search for a long-term peace agreement. Following a February 1949 incident, he was courtmartialed for disobeying an order from his superior, Major-General Zvi Ayalon OC Central Command. A military court found him guilty and briefly demoted him from lieutenant colonel to major. This did not prevent him from attending the armistice negotiations on Rhodes. On 29 June 1949, he was appointed head of all Israeli delegations to the Mixed Armistice Commission meetings. In September 1949, despite being involved in these negotiations, Dayan recommended to Ben-Gurion that the army should be used to open the road to Jerusalem and gain access to the Western Wall and Mount Scopus.

===Southern Command===
On 25 October 1949, he was promoted to major general and appointed commander of the Southern Command. Most of the staff officers resigned in protest of his replacement of Yigal Allon. The major problem in the south of the country was Palestinians crossing the border, &quot;infiltrating&quot;, from the Gaza Strip, Sinai, and the Hebron hills. Dayan was an advocate of a &quot;harsh&quot; policy along the border. In Jerusalem, he had given instructions that infiltrators killed in no-man&#x27;s-land or the Arab side of the border should be moved to the Israeli side before UN inspections. Allon had already introduced a 7 kilometre &quot;free-fire&quot; zone along the southern borders. In the spring of 1950, Dayan authorized the Israeli Air Force to strafe shepherds and their herds in the Beit Govrin area. There were also strafing attacks on bedouin camps in the Gaza area. In early 1950, 700 bedouin, &quot;&#x27;Azame&quot;, were expelled from the South Hebron area. In September 1950, several thousand more were driven from the demilitarized zone at Al-Ajua During 1950, the remaining population of al-Majdal were transferred to the Gaza Strip In a notorious incident on 31 May 1950, the army forced 120 Arabs across the Jordanian border at &#x27;Arava. &quot;Two or three dozen&quot; died of thirst before reaching safety.

During 1950, Dayan also developed a policy of punitive cross-border reprisal raids in response to fedayeen attacks on Israelis. IDF squads were sent into the Gaza Strip to lay mines. The first retaliation raid on a village occurred 20 March 1950 when six Arabs were killed at Khirbet Jamrura. On 18 June 1950, Dayan explained his thinking to the Mapai faction in the Knesset:

[Retaliation is] the only method that [has] proved effective, not justified or moral but effective, when Arabs plants mines on our side. If we try to search for that Arab, it has no value. But if we harass the nearby village... then the population there comes out against the [infiltrators]... and the Egyptian Government and the Transjordanian government are [driven] to prevent such incidents, because their prestige is [at stake], as the Jews have opened fire, and they are unready to begin a war...
The method of collective punishment so far has proved effective... There are no other effective methods.

In 1950, Moshe Dayan also ordered the Israeli army in 1950 to destroy the Shrine of Husayn&#x27;s Head, more than a year after hostilities ended. It is thought that the demolition was related to Dayan&#x27;s efforts to expel the remaining Palestinian Arabs from the region.

On 8 March 1951, 18 were killed at Idna. On 20 October 1951, two Battalion 79 (7th Brigade) companies destroyed several houses and an ice factory in eastern Gaza City; dozens were killed and injured. On 6 January 1952, an armoured infantry company from the same battalion attacked a Bedouin camp, &quot;Nabahim,&quot; near Bureij refugee camp killing 15. Glubb Pasha wrote that the objective of this new strategy seemed to &quot;be merely to kill Arabs indiscriminately&quot;. Dayan saw it as an &quot;eye for an eye&quot;. He was a close friend of Amos Yarkoni, an Arab officer in the Israel Defense Forces, At the time, the Military Commander commented that &quot;if Moshe Dayan could be the Ramatkal (Chief of the General Staff) without an eye, we can have a Battalion Commander with a prosthetic hand&quot;.

At the end of 1951, Dayan attended a course at the British Army&#x27;s Senior Officers&#x27; School in Devizes, England. In May 1952, he was appointed operational commander of the Northern Command.

===Chief of the General Staff===

The year 1952 was a time of economic crisis for the new state. Faced with demands of a 20% cut in budget and the discharge of 6,000 IDF members, Yigael Yadin resigned as Chief of the General Staff in November 1952, and was replaced by Mordechai Maklef. In December 1952, Dayan was promoted to Chief of the Operations (G) Branch, the second most senior General Staff post. One of Dayan&#x27;s actions in this post was to commence work on the canal diverting water from the River Jordan, September 1953.

During 1953, Prime Minister and Defence Minister David Ben-Gurion began to make preparations for his retirement. His choice for defence minister was Pinhas Lavon, who became acting MoD in the autumn of 1953. Lavon and Maklef were unable to work together and Maklef resigned. Dayan was immediately appointed CoS on 7 December 1953. This appointment was Ben-Gurion&#x27;s last act as prime minister before his replacement by acting Prime Minister Moshe Sharett.

On taking command, based on Ben-Gurion&#x27;s three-year defence programme, Dayan carried out a major reorganisation of the Israeli army, which, among others, included:
* Strengthened combat units at the expense of the administrative &quot;tail&quot;.
* Raising the Intelligence and Training Branches of the Israeli Army.
* Surrendering the activities of stores and procurement to the civilian Defence Ministry.
* Revamping the mobilisation scheme and ensuring earmarking for adequate equipment.
* Starting a military academy for officers of the rank of major and above.
* Emphasised strike forces (Air Force, Armour) and on training of commando battalions.
* Developed GADNA, a youth wing for military training.

In May 1955, Dayan attended a meeting convened by Ben-Gurion. Ben-Gurion raised the issue of a possible invasion of Iraq into Syria, and how this could be used to bring about change in Lebanon. Dayan proposed that:
All that is required is to find an officer, even a captain would do, to win his heart or buy him with money to get him to agree to declare himself the savior of the Maronite population. Then the Israeli army will enter Lebanon, occupy the necessary territory, and create a Christian regime that will ally itself with Israel. The territory from the Litani southward will be totally annexed to Israel, and everything will fall into place.
Prime Minister Moshe Sharett, shocked by the officers&#x27; indifference to neighbouring Lebanon, turned down the plan as divorced from reality.

===Cross-border operations===
In July 1953, while on the General staff, Dayan was party to the setting up of Unit 101, which was to specialise in night-time cross-border retaliation raids. He was initially opposed to setting up such a group because he argued it would undermine his attempts to prepare the IDF for an offensive war. Unit 101&#x27;s first official operation was to attack, on 28 August 1953, the Bureij Refugee Camp, during which they killed 20 refugees and suffered 2 wounded.

By October 1953, Dayan was closely involved with 101. He was one of the main architects of the Qibya massacre, on the night of 14/15 October 1953, in response to the killing of 3 Israeli civilians in the Yehud attack on 12 October. The General Staff order stated &quot;temporarily to conquer the village of Qibya – with the aim of blowing up houses and hitting the inhabitants&quot;. The Central Command Operation Instructions were more specific: &quot;carry out destruction and maximum killings.&quot; One hundred and thirty IDF soldiers, of whom a third came from Unit 101, carried out the operation. They carried 70 kg of explosives, blew up 45 houses, and killed 69 people. The commander who led the attack, Ariel Sharon later said that he had &quot;thought the houses were empty&quot;. The international criticism over the killed civilians led to a change of tactics. It was the last large-scale IDF attack on civilian buildings. In the future, targets were to be the Arab Legion, the Frontier Police, and the Egyptian or Syrian Armies. Dayan merged Unit 101 with the Paratroopers Brigade and assigned its command to Sharon.

Dayan had a difficult relationship with MoD Lavon. There were issues over spending priorities and over Lavon&#x27;s dealings with senior IDF members behind Dayan&#x27;s back. This ended with Lavon&#x27;s resignation over who ordered the sabotage operation in Egypt, which led to the trial of a number of Egyptian Jews, two of whom were executed.

Dayan believed in the value of punitive cross-border retaliation raids:
We cannot save each water pipe from explosion or each tree from being uprooted. We cannot prevent the murder of workers in orange groves or of families in their beds. But we &quot;can&quot; put a very high price on their blood, a price so high that it will no longer be worthwhile for the Arabs, the Arab armies, for the Arab states to pay it.

Prime Minister Sharett was an advocate of restraint and was not as confident in the attacks&#x27; effectiveness. When seeking approval for operations, Dayan downplayed the scale of the raids to get approval. There were fewer large-scale cross-border raids in 1954. Between December 1953 and September 1954, at least 48 Arabs were killed in over 18 cross-border raids. Fifteen of the dead were civilians: farmers, shepherds, and a doctor; two were women. With Ben-Gurion&#x27;s return, this changed. On the night of 28 February 1955, Operation Black Arrow (&quot;Mivtza Hetz Shahor&quot;) was launched against an Egyptian Army camp south of Gaza City. The IDF force consisted of 120 paratroops and suffered 14 dead; 36 Egyptian soldiers were killed as well as two Palestinian civilians. Ben-Gurion and Dayan had told Sharett that their estimate of Egyptian casualties was 10. On 31 August 1955, despite Sharett&#x27;s opposition, three paratroop companies attacked the British-built Tegart fort in Khan Yunis. Operation Elkayam directives called for &quot;killing as many enemy soldiers as possible&quot;. The police station and a number of other buildings were blown-up and 72 Egyptian and Palestinians were killed.

===Armaments===
Between 1955 and 1956, Dayan and Shimon Peres negotiated a series of large weapons contracts with France. On 10 November 1955, an agreement was signed for the delivery of 100 AMX-13 tanks and assorted anti-tank weapons. On 24 June 1956, an $80 million deal was agreed involving 72 Dassault Mystère IV jets, 120 AMX-13 tanks, 40 Sherman tanks and 18 105mm artillery. The Mystere were in addition to 53 already on order. At the end of September 1956, a further 100 Sherman tanks, 300 half-tracks, and 300 6x6 trucks were added.

By the beginning of November 1956, the Israeli army had 380 tanks.

===Escalation up to the Suez Crisis===

Following the 1955 elections, Ben-Gurion resumed his dual role as prime minister and defence minister. Dayan, who believed in the inevitability of the &quot;Second Round&quot;, argued for a preemptive attack on Israel&#x27;s neighbours, particularly Egypt. The two leaders thought war with Egypt could be achieved by provoking an Egyptian response to retaliation raids, which could then be used to justify an all-out attack. On 23 October 1955, Ben-Gurion instructed Dayan to prepare plans to capture Sharm al Sheikh.

On the night of 27 October 1955, an IDF battalion attacked an Egyptian army post at Kuntilla (Operation Egged), killing 12 Egyptian soldiers. On 2 November, al Sabha, close to the DMZ, was attacked, in Operation Volcano (&quot;Mivtza Ha Ga&#x27;ash&quot;), killing 81 Egyptian soldiers. On 11 December, hoping an attack on Syria would provoke an Egyptian response, Operation Olive Leaves/Sea of Galilee (&quot;Mivtza &#x27;Alei Zayit/Kinneret&quot;) was launched in which a number of Syrian positions on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee were destroyed. Forty-eight Syrian soldiers were killed as well as six civilians. The Egyptians did not react.

A Cabinet meeting on 15 December 1955 voted against further provocations and ruled that any retaliation attacks must have full Cabinet approval. The raids ceased for six months. There was one exception: On 5 April 1956, following two earlier incidents along the border with the Gaza Strip in which four Israeli soldiers were killed, the IDF shelled the centre of Gaza City with 120 mm mortars. Fifty-eight civilians were killed, including 10 children. 4 Egyptian soldiers were also killed. It is not clear whether Dayan had Ben-Gurion&#x27;s approval to shell the city. Egypt responded by resuming fedayeen attacks across the border, killing 14 Israelis during the period 11–17 April.

During September–October 1956, as plans began to mature for the invasion of the Sinai Peninsula, Dayan ordered a series of large-scale cross-border raids. On the night of 25 September, following a number of incidents including the machine-gunning of large gathering at Ramat Rachel in which four Israelis were killed, and the murder of a girl southwest of Jerusalem, the 890th Battalion attacked the Husan police station and nearby Arab Legion positions close to the armistice lines. Thirty-seven Legionnaires and National Guardsmen were killed as well as two civilians. Nine or ten paratroopers were killed, several in a road accident after the attack.

Following the killing of two workers near Even-Yehuda, Dayan ordered a similar attack, Operation Samaria/&quot;Mivtza Shomron,&quot; on the Qalqilya police station. The attack took place on the night of 10 October 1956 and involved several thousand IDF soldiers. During the fighting, Jordanian troops surrounded a paratroop company. The Israeli survivors only escaped under close air-cover from four IAF aircraft. The Israelis suffered 18 killed and 68 wounded; 70–90 Jordanians were killed. In the aftermath, paratroop officers severely criticized Dayan for alleged tactical mistakes. It was the last time the IDF launched a reprisal raid at night.

As Israel Defense Forces Chief of the General Staff, Moshe Dayan personally commanded the Israeli forces fighting in the Sinai during the 1956 Suez Crisis. It was during his tenure as Chief of the General Staff that Dayan delivered his famous eulogy of Ro&#x27;i Rutenberg, a young Israeli resident of Kibbutz Nahal Oz, killed by Egyptian soldiers who ambushed the kibbutz, in 1956. Dayan&#x27;s words became famous quickly and has served as one of the most influential speeches in Israeli history since. In forceful terms, Dayan condemned the killing and said,
: &quot;Early yesterday morning Roi was murdered. The quiet of the spring morning dazzled him and he did not see those waiting in ambush for him, at the edge of the furrow. Let us not cast the blame on the murderers today. Why should we declare their burning hatred for us? For eight years they have been sitting in the refugee camps in Gaza, and before their eyes we have been transforming the lands and the villages, where they and their fathers dwelt, into our estate. It is not among the Arabs in Gaza, but in our own midst that we must seek Roi&#x27;s blood. How did we shut our eyes and refuse to look squarely at our fate, and see, in all its brutality, the destiny of our generation? Have we forgotten that this group of young people dwelling at Nahal Oz is bearing the heavy gates of Gaza on its shoulders? Beyond the furrow of the border, a sea of hatred and desire for revenge is swelling, awaiting the day when serenity will dull our path, for the day when we will heed the ambassadors of malevolent hypocrisy who call upon us to lay down our arms. Roi&#x27;s blood is crying out to us and only to us from his torn body. Although we have sworn a thousandfold that our blood shall not flow in vain, yesterday again we were tempted, we listened, we believed.
: We will make our reckoning with ourselves today; we are a generation that settles the land and without the steel helmet and the cannon&#x27;s maw, we will not be able to plant a tree and build a home. Let us not be deterred from seeing the loathing that is inflaming and filling the lives of the hundreds of thousands of Arabs who live around us. Let us not avert our eyes lest our arms weaken. This is the fate of our generation. This is our life&#x27;s choice – to be prepared and armed, strong and determined, lest the sword be stricken from our fist and our lives cut down. The young Roi who left Tel Aviv to build his home at the gates of Gaza to be a wall for us was blinded by the light in his heart and he did not see the flash of the sword. The yearning for peace deafened his ears and he did not hear the voice of murder waiting in ambush. The gates of Gaza weighed too heavily on his shoulders and overcame him.&quot;

==Political career==

In 1959, a year after he retired from the IDF, Dayan joined Mapai, the Israeli centre-left party, then led by David Ben-Gurion. Until 1964, he was the Minister of Agriculture. In 1965, Dayan joined with the group of Ben-Gurion loyalists who defected from Mapai to form Rafi. Prime Minister Levi Eshkol disliked Dayan. When tensions began to rise in early 1967, however, Eshkol appointed the charismatic and popular Dayan defence minister to raise public morale and bring Rafi into a unity government.

Despite his military background, Dayan advocated for the integration of the Palestinian Arabs in an eventual One-state solution.

===1967 Six-Day War===

Moshe Dayan was covering the Vietnam War to observe modern warfare up close after he left political life. Moreover, he was on patrol as an observer with members of the US Marine Corps. Although Dayan did not take part in most of the planning before the Six-Day War of June 1967, he personally oversaw the capture of East Jerusalem during the 5–7 June fighting. During the years following the war, Dayan enjoyed enormous popularity in Israel and was widely viewed as a potential Prime Minister. At this time, Dayan was the leader of the hawkish camp within the Labor government, opposing a return to anything like Israel&#x27;s pre-1967 borders. He once said that he preferred Sharm-al-Sheikh (an Egyptian town on the southern edge of the Sinai Peninsula overlooking Israel&#x27;s shipping lane to the Red Sea via the Gulf of Aqaba) without peace, to peace without Sharm-al-Sheikh. He modified these views later in his career and played an important role in the eventual peace agreement between Israel and Egypt.

Dayan&#x27;s contention was denied by Muky Tsur, a longtime leader of the United Kibbutz Movement who said &quot;For sure there were discussions about going up the Golan Heights or not going up the Golan Heights, but the discussions were about security for the kibbutzim in Galilee,&quot; he said. &quot;I think that Dayan himself didn&#x27;t want to go to the Golan Heights. This is something we&#x27;ve known for many years. But no kibbutz got any land from conquering the Golan Heights. People who went there went on their own. It&#x27;s cynicism to say the kibbutzim wanted land.&quot;

About Dayan&#x27;s comments, Israeli ambassador to the United States Michael Oren has said
There is an element of truth to Dayan&#x27;s claim, but it is important to note that Israel regarded the de-militarized zones in the north as part of their sovereign territory and reserved the right to cultivate them—a right that the Syrians consistently resisted with force. Syria also worked to benefit from the Jordan river before it flowed into Israel, aiming to get use of it as a water source; Syria also actively supported Palestinian terrorist attacks against Israel. Israel occasionally exploited incidents in the de-militarized zones to strike at the Syrian water diversion project and to punish the Syrians for their support of terror. Dayan&#x27;s remarks must also be taken in context of the fact that he was a member of the opposition at the time. His attitude toward the Syrians changed dramatically once he became defense minister. Indeed, on June 8, 1967, Dayan bypassed both the Prime Minister and the Chief of the General Staff in ordering the Israeli army to attack and capture the Golan.

====USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident====
During the Six-Day War, Israeli aerial and naval forces attacked the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; spy ship as she was on patrol in international waters in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. 34 Americans were killed and 174 were wounded in the attack. Israel&#x27;s official explanation was that the attack was a case of “mistaken identity,” but this remains disputed.

Many &quot;Liberty&quot; survivors and their supporters maintain that Dayan personally ordered the attack, and this is supported by a CIA report on the attack.

One of the prevailing theories for the motivation for the attack is that the Israelis wished to keep secret their pending invasion of the Golan Heights, and they feared that the signals intelligence collection ship might have collected intelligence about the pending invasion.

===1973 Yom Kippur War===

After Golda Meir became prime minister in 1969 following the death of Levi Eshkol, Dayan remained defense minister.

He was still in that post when the Yom Kippur War began catastrophically for Israel on 6 October 1973. As the highest-ranking official responsible for military planning, Dayan may bear part of the responsibility for the Israeli leadership having missed the signs for the upcoming war. In the hours preceding the war, Dayan chose not to order a full mobilization or a preemptive strike against the Egyptians and Syrians. He assumed that Israel would be able to win easily even if the Arabs attacked and, more importantly, did not want Israel to appear as the aggressor, as it would have undoubtedly cost it the invaluable support of the United States (who would later mount a massive airlift to rearm Israel).
Following the heavy defeats of the first two days, Dayan&#x27;s views changed radically; he was close to announcing &#x27;the downfall of the &quot;Third Temple&quot;&#x27; at a news conference, but was forbidden to speak by Meir.

Dayan suggested options at the beginning of the war, including a plan to withdraw to the Mitleh Mountains in Sinai and a complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights to carry the battle over the Jordan, abandoning the core strategic principles of Israeli war doctrine, which says that war must be taken into enemy territory as soon as possible. Chief of the General Staff David Elazar objected to these plans and was proved correct. Israel broke through the Egyptian lines on the Sinai front, crossed the Suez canal, and encircled the 3rd Egyptian Army. Israel also counterattacked on the Syrian front, repelling the Jordanian and Iraqi expeditionary forces and shelling the outskirts of Damascus. Although the war ended with an Israeli victory, the Arab attack destroyed Israel&#x27;s image of invincibility and eventually led to the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and the subsequent withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Egyptian territory.

===Foreign minister===
According to those who knew him, the war deeply depressed Dayan. He went into political eclipse for a time. In 1977, despite having been re-elected to the Knesset for the Alignment, he accepted the offer to become Foreign Minister in the new Likud government led by Menachem Begin. He was expelled from the Alignment, and as a result, sat as an independent MK. As foreign minister in Begin&#x27;s government, he was instrumental in drawing up the Camp David Accords, a peace agreement with Egypt. Dayan resigned his post in October 1979, because of a disagreement with Begin over whether the Palestinian territories were an internal Israeli matter (the Camp David treaty included provisions for future negotiations with the Palestinians; Begin, who did not like the idea, did not put Dayan in charge of the negotiating team). In 1981, he founded a new party, Telem.

==Family==

Ruth Dayan, his first wife, divorced Moshe in 1971 after 36 years of marriage due to his numerous extramarital affairs. In the Israeli best-selling book that followed the divorce, &quot;Or Did I Dream the Dream?&quot;, Ruth Dayan wrote a chapter about &quot;Moshe&#x27;s bad taste in women&quot;. In 1973, two years after the divorce, Dayan married Rachel Korem in a simple ceremony performed by Rabbi Mordechai Piron, IDF chief chaplain, at the Pirons&#x27; home. The wedding was not announced in advance and Piron had to recruit neighbors to complete a minyan (the 10-man quorum required for a religious ceremony). Dayan humorously told well-wishers that he had no trouble getting a marriage license. &quot;She is divorced and I am divorced. I am no Cohen (priest) and no mamzer (bastard) so there was no trouble.&quot; Neither Dayan&#x27;s daughter and two sons nor Korem&#x27;s two daughters attended. When he died, Dayan left almost his entire estate to his second wife, Rachel. 

Moshe&#x27;s and Ruth&#x27;s daughter, Yael Dayan, a novelist, is best known in Israel for her book, &quot;My Father, His Daughter&quot;, about her relationship with her father. She followed him into politics and has been a member of several Israeli left-wing parties over the years. She has served in the Knesset and on the Tel Aviv City Council, and was a Tel Aviv-Yafo deputy mayor, responsible for social services. One of his sons, Assi Dayan, was an actor and a movie director. Another son, novelist Ehud Dayan, who was cut out of his father&#x27;s will, wrote a book critical of his father months after he died, mocking his military, writing, and political skills, calling him a philanderer, and accusing him of greed. In his book, Ehud accused his father even of making money from his battle with cancer. He also lamented having recited Kaddish for his father &quot;three times too often for a man who never observed half the Ten Commandments&quot;.

==Death and legacy==

The Telem party won two seats in the 1981 elections, but Dayan died shortly thereafter, in Tel Aviv, from a massive heart attack. He had been in ill-health since 1980, after he was diagnosed with colon cancer later that year. He is buried in Nahalal in the &quot;moshav&quot; (a collective village) where he was raised. Following his death, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, arranged that the yearlong memorial service of kaddish be recited in honor of Dayan. Dayan bequeathed his personal belongings to his bodyguard. In 2005, his eye patch was offered for sale on eBay with a starting bid of US$75,000.

Dayan was a complex character; his opinions were never strictly black and white. He had few close friends; his mental brilliance and charismatic manner were combined with cynicism and lack of restraint. Ariel Sharon noted about Dayan:
He would wake up with a hundred ideas. Of them ninety-five were dangerous; three more had to be rejected; the remaining two, however, were brilliant.

He had courage amounting to insanity, as well as displays of a lack of responsibility. I would not say the same about his civil courage. Once Ben Gurion had asked me—what do I think of the decision to appoint Dayan as the Minister of Agriculture in his government. I said that it is important that Dayan sits in every government because of his brilliant mind—but never as prime minister. Ben Gurion asked: &quot;why not as prime minister?&quot;. I replied then: &quot;because he does not accept responsibility&quot;.
In 1969, during an address to the students at Technion University in Haifa, Dayan regretted the fact that students are unfamiliar with the Arab villages that once inhabited the land: &quot;We came to this country which was already populated by Arabs, and we are establishing... a Jewish state here. In considerable areas of the country we bought the lands from the Arabs. Jewish villages were built in the place of Arab villages. You do not even know the names of these Arab villages, and I do not blame you, because these geography books no longer exist; not only do the books not exist, the Arab villages are not there either. Nahalal arose in the place of Mahalul, Gevat – in the place of Jibta, Sarid - in the place of Haneifs and Kefar Yehoshua - in the place of Tell Shaman. There is no one place built in this country that did not have a former Arab population.&quot;

Dayan combined a kibbutznik&#x27;s secular identity and pragmatism with a deep love and appreciation for the Hebrew Bible, the Jewish people and the land of Israel—but not an orthodox religious identification. In one recollection, having seen rabbis flocking on the Temple Mount shortly after Jerusalem was captured in 1967, he asked, &quot;What is this? The Vatican?&quot; Dayan later ordered to give administrative control of the Temple Mount over to the Waqf, a Muslim council.

Dayan was an author and described himself as an amateur archaeologist, the latter hobby leading to significant controversy, as his amassing of historical artifacts, often with the help of his soldiers, seemed to be in breach of a number of laws. Yigael Yadin remarked after one incident: &quot;I know who did it, and I am not going to say who it is, but if I catch him, I&#x27;ll poke out his other eye, too.&quot; Some of his activities in this regard, whether illegal digging, looting of sites or commerce of antiquities, have been detailed by R. Kletter from the Israel Antiquities Authority.

American science-fiction writer Poul Anderson published his novel &quot;Ensign Flandry&quot; at the time when Moshe Dayan&#x27;s international renown and admiration for him in Israel were at their highest. The far-future Galactic Empire described in the book includes a planet called &quot;Dayan&quot;, inhabited by Jews.

<text>A Night to Remember is a 1955 non-fiction book by Walter Lord that tells the story of the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912. The book was hugely successful, and is still considered a definitive resource about the &quot;Titanic&quot;. Lord interviewed 63 survivors of the disaster and drew on books, memoirs, and articles that they had written. In 1986, Lord authored his follow-up book, &quot;The Night Lives On&quot;, following renewed interest in the story after the wreck of the &quot;Titanic&quot; was discovered by Robert Ballard.

The book was notably adapted into the British film adaptation, with advice from Lord, that was released in 1958.

==Publication history==
Lord traveled on the RMS &quot;Olympic&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot;″s sister ship, when he was a boy, 13 years after Titanic sank, and the experience gave him a lifelong fascination with the lost liner. As he later put it, he spent his time on the &quot;Olympic&quot; &quot;prowling around&quot; and trying to imagine &quot;such a huge thing&quot; sinking. He started reading about and drawing &quot;Titanic&quot; at the age of ten and spent many years collecting &quot;Titanic&quot; memorabilia, causing people to &quot;take note of this oddity.&quot; He majored in history at Princeton University and graduated from Yale Law School before joining the New York–based advertising agency J. Walter Thompson. Writing in his spare time, he interviewed 63 survivors of the disaster.

&quot;A Night to Remember&quot; was only Lord&#x27;s second book but was a huge success, thanks in no small part to the aggressive advertising campaign carried out by R &amp; W Holt following its launch in November 1955. The book also undoubtedly benefited from the popularity of the 1953 film &quot;Titanic&quot; and other coverage of the disaster that was published around the same time. Within two months of its publication, the book had sold 60,000 copies and remained listed as a best-seller for six months. The &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; both published condensed versions and it was selected in June 1956 by the Book of the Month Club. The first paperback edition was published by Bantam Books in October 1956.

Since then the book has never been out of print and has been translated into over a dozen languages. Its success enabled Lord to leave the world of advertising and become a full-time writer. After the discovery of the wreck of the &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1985 sparked a new wave of public interest in the disaster he wrote a follow-up book, &quot;The Night Lives On&quot; (1986). Daniel Allen Butler comments that &quot;although it was of immense interest to &quot;Titanic&quot; buffs the world over, it lacked the spark of the original,&quot; which by 1998 had reached its fiftieth printing.

==Critical commentaries==

The book received widespread praise from contemporary critics. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;stunning ... one of the most exciting books of this or any other year&quot;. The &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; praised the book for doing &quot;a magnificent job of re-creative chronicling, enthralling from the first word to the last.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that it was &quot;seamless and skillful... it&#x27;s clear why this is many a researcher&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot; bible&quot;, while &quot;USA Today&quot; described it as &quot;the most riveting narrative of the disaster.&quot;

The secret to Lord&#x27;s success, according to the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;″s critic Stanley Walker, was that he used &quot;a kind of literary pointillism, the arrangement of contrasting bits of fact and emotion in such a fashion that a vividly real impression of an event is conveyed to the reader.&quot; Walker highlighted the way that Lord had avoided telling the story through the prism of social class, which had been the usual style of previous narratives, and instead successfully depicted the human element of the story by showing how those aboard reacted to the disaster whatever their class.

Steven Biel, an American cultural historian, notes the novelistic way in which Lord tells the story. The book depicts events through the eyes of multiple individuals, violating simple chronology to present an overlapping series of narratives. Nathaniel Philbrick, writing in the introduction to the fiftieth anniversary edition of &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;, notes that at the time of publication it was the first significant book about &quot;Titanic&quot; for nearly forty years. He argues that the book&#x27;s hallmarks are its restraint, brevity and readability, which downplays the extravagant and mythical aspects of the disaster and instead puts in the foreground the stories of the people on the ship. The narrative builds suspense, making the reader care about the characters and revisit the disaster from their perspective. It tells the story in a highly visual and aural way, describing the sights and sounds of the night of the disaster &quot;with the immediacy of a live broadcast or a television documentary&quot;, as Biel puts it.

A key to Lord&#x27;s method is his technique of adopting an unconventional approach to the chronology of the event, &quot;[taking] an imaginative approach to time and space in which hours and minutes prove extremely malleable, the ship itself seems almost infinitely complex, and the disaster assumes order and unity from far away.&quot; In short it is &quot;a modernist narrative [constructed] around a modernist event.&quot; Reviewers highlighted the way in which Lord depicted the human side of the &quot;Titanic&quot; story, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;the core of Mr. Lord&#x27;s account, and explains its fascination, a pull as powerful in its way as the last downward plunge of the ship itself.&quot; While the &quot;legendary acts of gallantry&quot; stood out, the book invites readers to put themselves in the place of those aboard and implicitly asks how they would react in the same situation. As &quot;Newsweek&quot; put it, &quot;What would it be like to be aboard a sinking ocean liner?&quot;

The significance of Lord&#x27;s book, according to Biel, is that it &quot;gave the disaster its fullest retelling since 1912 and made it speak to a modern mass audience and a new set of postwar concerns. In the creation of the &quot;Titanic&quot; myth there were two defining moments: 1912, of course, and 1955.&quot; Lord updates the popular interpretation of the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster by portraying it in world-historical terms as the symbolic and actual end of an era, and as an event which &quot;marked the end of a general feeling of confidence.&quot; Uncertainty replaced orderliness, and the ship&#x27;s sinking marked the beginning of the twentieth century&#x27;s &quot;unending sequence of disillusionment. Before the &quot;Titanic&quot;, all was quiet. Afterward, all was tumult.&quot; Biel notes that Lord&#x27;s underlying theme is a rather nostalgic reflection of the &quot;nobler instincts&quot; exhibited in the disaster and their subsequent eclipse. Such ideals were attractive for a post-war society that celebrated the role of the nuclear family and the traditional roles of the male breadwinner and female homemaker.

Lord&#x27;s invocation of an era of confidence and certainty was also a relevant theme at the height of the Cold War. The University of California sociologist Fred Davis comments that nostalgia &quot;thrives ... on the rude transitions wrought by such phenomena as war, depression, civil disturbance, and cataclysmic natural disasters – in short, those events that cause masses of people to feel uneasy and to wonder whether the world and their being are quite what they always took them to be.&quot; The turmoil and uncertainty of the early Atomic Age and the onset of profound social changes made the old concepts of the nuclear family and traditional gender roles, reflected in the behaviour of &quot;Titanic&quot;″s passengers, resonate with a mid-1950s audience.

The gradual nature of the disaster was also more comforting, in some respects, compared with the nature of modern technological failures such as air crashes. &quot;Time&quot;″s reviewer made this point explicitly: &quot;This air age, when death comes too swiftly for heroism or with no survivors to record it, can still turn with wonder to an age before yesterday when a thousand deaths at sea seemed the very worst the world must suffer.&quot; It was, as Steven Biel comments, &quot;a quainter kind of disaster&quot; in which the victims had time to prepare and chose how to die.

==Screen adaptations==
The book has been adapted twice for the screen. The first production, &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; (1956), was staged as a live adaptation screened on 28 March 1956 by NBC TV and sponsored by Kraft Foods as part of the &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot; program. It has been described as &quot;the biggest, most lavish, most expensive thing of its kind&quot; attempted up to that point, with 31 sets, 107 actors, 72 speaking parts, 3,000 gallons of water and costing $95,000 ($ at present-day prices). George Roy Hill directed and Claude Rains provided a narration – a practice borrowed from radio dramas which provided a template for many television dramas of the time. It took a similar approach to the book, lacking dominant characters and switching between a multiplicity of scenes. Rains&#x27; narration was used &quot;to bridge the almost limitless number of sequences of life aboard the doomed liner&quot;, as a reviewer put it, and closed with his declaration that &quot;never again has Man been so confident. An age had come to an end.&quot; The production was a major hit, attracting 28 million viewers, and greatly boosted the book&#x27;s sales. It was rerun on kinescope on 2 May 1956, five weeks after its first broadcast.

The second adaptation was the 1958 British drama film &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; starring Kenneth More, which is still widely regarded as &quot;the definitive cinematic telling of the story.&quot; The film came about after its eventual director, Roy Ward Baker, and its producer, Belfast-born William MacQuitty both acquired copies of the book – Baker from his favorite bookshop and MacQuitty from his wife – and decided to obtain the film rights. MacQuitty had actually seen &quot;Titanic&quot; being launched on 31 May 1911 and still remembered the occasion vividly. He met Lord and brought him on board the production as a consultant. The film diverges from both the book and the NBC TV adaptation in focusing on a central character, Second Officer Charles Lightoller, played by More. Its conclusion reflects Lord&#x27;s world-historical theme of a &quot;world changed for ever&quot; with a fictional conversation between Lightoller and Colonel Archibald Gracie, sitting on a lifeboat. Lightoller declares that the disaster is &quot;different ... Because we were so sure. Because even though it&#x27;s happened, it&#x27;s still unbelievable. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever feel sure again. About anything.&quot;

==Collection==
Lord later served as a consultant to film director James Cameron for his 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot;. After Lord died in 2002, he bequeathed to the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England his huge collection of manuscripts, original letters and &quot;Titanic&quot; memorabilia, which he had gathered during his life and used to write &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;. MacQuitty also donated items from his own collection of material related to the film. Items from the collection are on display at the museum and can be accessed by researchers.

<doc id="90144" wikidata="Q2732232" url="?curid=90144" title="I Drove All Night">
<text>&quot;I Drove All Night&quot; is a song written and composed by American songwriters Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly and originally intended for Roy Orbison. Orbison recorded the song in 1987, the year before his death, but his version was not released until 1991. Before that, Cyndi Lauper recorded the song and released it as a single for her &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; album. Her version became a top 10 hit on both sides of the Atlantic in 1989 and was also her final top 40 hit on the American pop charts. Lauper still regularly performs the song in her live concerts. The song has also been covered by Canadian singer Celine Dion in 2003, whose version topped the Canadian Singles Chart and reached number 7 on the US Adult Contemporary chart.

==Cyndi Lauper version==

&quot;I Drove All Night&quot; was recorded by American singer and songwriter Cyndi Lauper for her third solo album, &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; (1989). Lauper said she wanted to do it because she liked the idea &quot;of a woman driving, of a woman in control.&quot; The song was a top 10 hit for her in the United States, becoming her 8th and last US top 10 single to date, peaking at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and was also a hit in other countries. It received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. The music video for &quot;I Drove All Night&quot;, directed by Lauper and Scott Kalvert, features the opening lines from the song &quot;Kindred Spirit&quot;, shots of an antique car, Lauper&#x27;s characteristically manic dancing, and movie film projected onto Lauper&#x27;s naked body.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Billboard&quot; reviewer described the music of this work as &quot;yearning crystalline pop/rock&quot; and found Lauper&#x27;s vocal mature. Jerry Smith, reviewer of British music newspaper &quot;Music Week&quot;, called Lauper &quot;American with good ear&quot;, praised her &quot;assured and dramatic display&quot;, expressing an assurance that this &quot;passionate ballad&quot; is &quot;destined to return her to the charts once more&quot;. Tim Nicholson of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; described the song as being &quot;a punchy stab at power-driven west coast rock&quot;.
The single sold 100.000 copies in France.

== Roy Orbison version ==

Jeff Lynne sampled Roy Orbison&#x27;s 1987 recordings for the 1992 posthumous album &quot;King of Hearts,&quot; on which &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; was one of the tracks. However, Orbison&#x27;s version of the song first appeared on the 1991 &quot;Super Mario World&quot;-themed compilation album &quot;&quot;. Released as a single in June 1992, the song was a significant hit in the United Kingdom, reaching number 7 on the UK Singles Chart, matching the peak position of Lauper&#x27;s version three years earlier. &quot;King of Hearts&quot; and &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; were generally well received in the United States, returning Orbison to the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and receiving a Grammy Award. A music video featuring Jason Priestley and Jennifer Connelly was also made for the single, mixed with archive footage of Orbison and included a background reference to the &quot;Mario&quot; series. The song is featured in the film &quot;Paperback Hero&quot;, starring Hugh Jackman.

==Celine Dion version==

&quot;I Drove All Night&quot; was recorded by Celine Dion for her eighth English-language studio album, &quot;One Heart&quot; (2003), and released as the lead single on January 21, 2003. The song was featured in a promotional ad for Chrysler. The &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; music video was directed by Peter Arnell and released in February 2003. It was included on the United Kingdom enhanced double A-side single &quot;One Heart/I Drove All Night&quot;. The song was commercially successful, reaching number 1 for five weeks in Canada, while also topping the charts in Belgium (Flanders) and Sweden.

=== Background ===
In 2003, Chrysler signed Dion to a $14 million deal to endorse their cars. They were looking for a song to use in the campaign and release as a single. Billy Steinberg knew Dion and had written &quot;Falling into You&quot;, which was the title track of her 1996 album. He sent a copy of Roy Orbison&#x27;s version of &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; to her record company, who loved it and had Dion record it with Swedish producer Peer Åström. She used the song in her Las Vegas show and it became the centerpiece of the Chrysler campaign. The commercials were great exposure for the song and helped sell many albums, but they did not sell enough cars. Chrysler pulled out of the deal after many of their dealers complained and it became clear the ads were not working. Dion was allowed to keep her $ 14 million fee.

In Dion&#x27;s version, &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; is dance-pop. It was also considered &quot;a little bit dance-club, a little bit rock and roll.&quot; In the second verse, Dion duplicates a line as it is heard in Orbison&#x27;s original recording. Instead of singing, &quot;no matter where I go I hear the beating of our heart,&quot; Dion sings, &quot;our &quot;one&quot; heart,&quot; which is where the title of the album the song is featured on gets its name. Like the original, the chorus is sung again twice, which ends the single.

===Composition===
Dion&#x27;s version of &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; is set in the key of G minor. It features a moderately fast tempo of 135 beats per minute, and her vocals span from F3 to E5.

===Critical reception ===
The song received positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine noticed that the song was &quot;a tongue-in-cheek, neo-house cover&quot; and picked it as one of the best tracks on the album, alongside the title track and &quot;Have You Ever Been in Love.&quot; Rebecca Wallwork wrote a positive review for Amazon, calling it &quot;the car-commercial-driven tempo,&quot; while Jam!&#x27;s Darryl Sterdan named it &quot;a Cher-style eurodisco.&quot; &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Sal Cinquemani echoed the same thought, saying that &quot;she gets the Cher treatment on the blazing cover.&quot; &quot;People&quot;″s Chuck Arnold wrote that in the song, Dion &quot;shows surprising restraint for a diva who just had a coliseum custom-built for her.&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Betty Clarke wrote a negative review, saying: &quot;Her cover of Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; is full of reverberating notes and sultry asides, but reveals a fundamental lack of sincerity that renders her threatening when she is trying for tender.&quot; David Browne of EW gave this cover C+, calling her delivery &#x27;frigid&#x27; without over-singing it. He called the arrangement &quot;blandly competent.&quot;

===Commercial performance ===
In Canada, the song debuted straight at number one on the Canadian Hot 100 chart and spent 5 consecutive weeks at the top. &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; was Dion&#x27;s third airplay-only single that charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 45. The commercial single was released five months later reaching number 26 on the Hot 100 Singles Sales. Because of several club remixes created mainly by Hex Hector, the song peaked at number 2 on the Hot Dance Club Play.

In Australia, the song debuted and peaked at number 22 on the ARIA Charts, on March 16, 2003. The following week, the song dropped to number 35 and it kept fluctuating on the chart for the next two weeks, until it climbed from number 44 to number 43. Later, the song fell to number 49, but it climbed to number 38, the following week. It spent 10 weeks on the chart and it was certified gold. In New Zealand, the song debuted at number 48 on the RIANZ chart, on March 2, 2003. The following week, the song climbed to number 46, while in its third week, it jumped to number 30.

The song spent 9 weeks on the chart.

The song was even more successful on the Belgian Flanders Singles Chart, where it debuted at number 14, on March 8, 2004. The following week, the song jumped to number 4, while in its third week, the song topped the charts. It remained at the top ten for ten consecutive weeks and fifteen overall weeks on the chart. It was certified platinum, for selling 50,000 copies. The song was also a big success in Sweden, debuting at the top of the Swedish Singles Chart, on March 20, 2003. However, the following week, the song fell to number 12 and in its third week, it fell to number 13. In its fourth week, the song jumped to number 7, but it kept fluctuating on the chart for the next three weeks, until it climbed from number 22 to number 16. It spent 17 weeks on the chart. On the Danish Singles Chart, the song debuted at number 2, where it remained for three consecutive weeks. Later, it fell to number 5, while on the following week, it fell to number 6, where it remained for another week.

In France, even not reaching the top twenty, the song proved to be strong on the SNEP chart. It debuted at number 89, however, it fell to number 94 in its second week and to number 97 in its third week. Despite falling for two consecutive weeks and leaving the charts, the song re-entered at number 22, its peak position, on April 26, 2003. It spent 11 non-consecutive weeks on the chart.

===Music video and promotion ===
The music video shot in Las Vegas, USA on February 2, 2003, was directed by advertising executive Peter Arnell, cinematographed by Rolf Kestermann and edited by Bee Ottinger. An arty little black and white number, it features Dion, some arm stretches and back bends whilst a couple somewhere else seem to be merrily getting their groove on. It was included in the UK Enhanced CD Single of &quot;One Heart&quot;. The music video was nominated for the MuchMoreMusic Award in 2003.

Dion appeared in four commercial spots—all scored with tracks from &quot;One Heart&quot; including &quot;I Drove All Night&quot;—for Chrysler, also directed by Arnell and edited by Ottinger, while Darius Khondji acted as director of photography on the ads.

Dion performed &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; during &quot;A New Day...&quot; show and included it on the &quot;A New Day... Live in Las Vegas&quot; CD in 2004 and &quot;Live in Las Vegas - A New Day...&quot; DVD in 2007. The &quot;A New Day... Live in Las Vegas&quot; bonus DVD, called &quot;One Year...One Heart&quot; contained the recording of the song and fragments from making the video.

The song became also an opening track for the 2008-09 Taking Chances World Tour, preceded by an introduction video using the remix of &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; as well. The audio and footage of this performance was included in the &quot;Taking Chances World Tour: The Concert&quot; CD/DVD. In October 2008, &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; was included on &quot;My Love: Essential Collection&quot; greatest hits. The song was also performed in Dion&#x27;s 2017 European tour.

===Release history===
==Pinmonkey version==
In 2003, American country music band Pinmonkey covered the song on their self-titled debut album. According to group member Chad Jeffers, the idea of doing a country cover of the song was inspired by his girlfriend, who was a fan of Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s version. To make sure their cover sounded distinct, the band intentionally declined to listen to Lauper&#x27;s version, instead basing it off an acoustic rendition sung by Jeffers. The cover was the second single off the album, peaking at number 36 on Hot Country Songs.

Jack Leaver of &quot;The Grand Rapids Press&quot; praised the cover for its vocal harmony and country rock sound. Deborah Evans Price wrote in a review for &quot;Billboard&quot; that the band members &quot;capably make it their own. Reynolds&#x27; vocals effectively convey the emotional urgency in the lyric and Worley&#x27;s production lets the band flaunt the smoother side of the group&#x27;s country rock chops.&quot;

<text>&quot;My First Night Without You&quot; is the second single released from Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s third album &quot;A Night To Remember&quot; (1989).

==Song information==
The ballad is about coming home for the first time without a partner being there after a break up. The video clip is also about this, with Lauper coming home after a long day at work to an empty room after a separation. The song was written by Lauper, Tom Kelly and Billy Steinberg. The latter two also wrote &quot;True Colors&quot; and &quot;I Drove All Night&quot;.

Its B-side was &quot;Unabbreviated Love&quot;. The song is a fan favorite; Lauper performed it many times on her &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; tour in 1989.

To promote the single, promotional posters were sent to different malls and music stores that sold the single when it was originally released.

The single failed to make a big impact on most global charts. It did do moderately well in Chile however. And also, it achieved #1 in the Radio Cidade from São Paulo, Brazil. In Colombia, the single was #1 for 10 weeks.

==Reception==
The song received a positive review from the pan-European magazine &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot;, which named it one of their &quot;singles of the week&quot; and noted both the intro, reminiscent of &quot;the classic Arthur Brown track &quot;Fire&quot;&quot;, and the overall song which was described as &quot;passionate and dramatic&quot;.

==Music video==
The video for &quot;My First Night Without You&quot;, released in 1989, was one of the first to be closed-captioned for the hearing impaired.

<doc id="90152" wikidata="Q314275" url="?curid=90152" title="Quentin Matsys">
<text>Quentin Matsys () (1466–1530) was a Flemish painter in the Early Netherlandish tradition. He was born in Leuven. According to tradition, he trained as an ironsmith before becoming a painter. Matsys was active in Antwerp for over 20 years, creating numerous works with religious roots and satirical tendencies. He is regarded as the founder of the Antwerp school of painting, which became the leading school of painting in Flanders in the 16th century. He introduced new techniques and motifs as well as moralising subjects without completely breaking with tradition.

==Early life==
Most early accounts of Matsys&#x27; life are composed primarily of legend and very little contemporary accounts exist of the nature of his activities or character. According to J. Molanus&#x27; &quot;Historiae Lovaniensium&quot;, Matsys was known to be a native of Leuven with humble beginnings as an ironsmith. One of four children, Massys was born to Joost Matsys (d. 1483) and Catherine van Kincken sometime between 4 April and 10 September 1466. Legend states that Matsys abandoned his career as a blacksmith to woo his wife, who found painting to be a more romantic profession, though Karel van Mander claimed this to be false, and the real reason was a sickness during which he was too weak to work at the smithy and instead decorated prints for the carnival celebrations.
Documented donations and possessions of Joost Matsys indicate that the family had a respectable income and that financial need was most likely not the reason Matsys turned to painting. During the period in which Matsys was active in Antwerp he took only four apprentices: a certain Ariaen whom certain art historians believe to be Adriaen van Overbeke (master in 1508), Willem Muelenbroec (registered in 1501), Eduart Portugalois (registered in 1504, master in 1506), and Hennen Boeckmakere (registered in 1510). It is widely believed that Joachim Patinir studied with Matsys at some point during his career and contributed to several of his landscapes (such as &quot;The Temptation of St. Anthony&quot; at the Prado Museum in Madrid). Lack of guild records during this time leaves Matsys&#x27; travels to Italy and other parts of the Low Countries as part of his training open to question. For the most part, foreign influences on Matsys are inferred from his paintings and are considered to be a large portion of the artist&#x27;s training during the 16th century.

==Work in Leuven==
During the greater part of the 15th century, the centres in which the painters of the Low Countries most congregated were Tournai, Bruges, Ghent and Brussels. Leuven gained prominence toward the close of this period, employing workmen from all of the crafts including Matsys. Not until the beginning of the 16th century did Antwerp take the lead which it afterward maintained against Bruges, Ghent, Brussels, Mechelen and Leuven. Because no guild records were kept prior to 1494 in Leuven there is no concrete proof that Matsys attained his master&#x27;s status there; however, historians generally accept this to be the location of his early training because he had not been previously registered in Antwerp as an apprentice. As a member of Antwerp&#x27;s Guild of Saint Luke, Matsys is considered to be one of its first notable artists. Existing records of guild laws and regulations from the 16th century indicate that it is highly unlikely that Matsys was self-taught, despite accounts in Carel van Mander&#x27;s &quot;Schilderboeck&quot; (1604) stating that Matsys studied under no artist.

==Style==
Although the roots of Matsys&#x27; training are unknown, his style reflects the artistic qualities of Dirk Bouts, who brought to Leuven the influence of Hans Memling and Rogier Van der Weyden. When Matsys settled at Antwerp at the age of twenty-five, his own style contributed importantly to reviving Flemish art along the lines of Van Eyck and Van der Weyden. Matsys departed from Leuven in 1491 when he became a master in the guild of painters at Antwerp. His most well known satirical works include &quot;A Portrait of an Elderly Man&quot; (1513), and &quot;The Money Changer and His Wife&quot; (1514), all of which provide commentary on human feeling and society in general. He also painted religious altarpieces and triptych panels, the most famous of which was built for the Church of Saint Peter in Leuven.
Matsys work is considered to contain strong religious feeling—characteristic of traditional Flemish works—and is accompanied by a realism that often favored the grotesque. Matsys&#x27; firmness of outline, clear modelling and thorough finish of detail stem from Van Der Weyden&#x27;s influence; from the Van Eycks and Memling by way of Dirck Bouts, the glowing richness of transparent pigments. Matsys&#x27; works generally reflect earnestness in expression, minutely detailed renderings, and subdued effects in light and shade. Like most Flemish artists of the time he paid a great deal of attention to jewelry, edging of garments, and ornamentation in general.

Most of the emphasis in his works lies not upon atmosphere, which is in fact given very little attention, but to the literalness of caricature: emphasizing the melancholy refinement of saints, the brutal gestures and grimaces of gaolers and executioners. Strenuous effort is devoted to the expression of individual character. A satirical tendency may be seen in the pictures of merchant bankers (Louvre and Windsor), revealing their greed and avarice. His other impulse, dwelling on the feelings of tenderness, may be noted in two replicas of the Virgin and Child at Berlin and Amsterdam, where the ecstatic kiss of the mother seems rather awkward. An expression of acute despair may be seen in a &quot;Lucretia&quot; in the museum at Vienna. The remarkable glow of the colour in these works, however, makes the Mannerist exaggerations palatable.

Matsys had considerable skill as a portrait painter. His &quot;Ægidius (Peter Gilles)&quot; which drew from Thomas More a eulogy in Latin verse, is but one of many, to which one may add the portrait of Maximilian of Austria in the gallery in Amsterdam. In this branch of his practice, Matsys was greatly influenced by his fellow countryman Jan Mabuse. Matsys&#x27; portraiture exhibits highly personal and individual emotional characteristics that reflect his adherence to realism as a technique.

==Influences==
In comparison to other Northern Renaissance artists such as Holbein and Dürer, Matsys shies away from refined and subtle detailing. Because there are numerous connections between him and these masters, however, it can be concluded that his departure in techniques was deliberate and not an act of ignorance. He most likely met Holbein more than once on his way to England, and Dürer is believed to have visited his house at Antwerp in 1520. Matsys also became the guardian of Joachim Patinir&#x27;s children after the death of that painter.

His &quot;Virgin and Christ&quot;, &quot;Ecce Homo&quot; and &quot;Mater Dolorosa&quot; (London and Antwerp) are known for their serene and dignified mastery, gaining in delicacy and nuance in the works of his maturity. It is believed that he had known the work of Leonardo da Vinci in the form of prints made and circulated among northern artists (his &quot;Madonna and Child with the Lamb&quot;, inspired by &quot;The Virgin and Child with St. Anne&quot;, reflects da Vinci&#x27;s influences). This is largely regarded as proof that Matsys was greatly influenced by Italian Renaissance artists, and that he most likely travelled to Italy for at least a brief period.

==Death==
Matsys died at Antwerp in 1530. He was a religious devotee, despite several of his relatives dying as a result of their faith. His sister Catherine and her husband suffered at Leuven in 1543 for what was then the capital offence of reading the Bible: he being decapitated, she allegedly buried alive in the square before the church. In 1629 the first centennial of Matsys&#x27; death was marked by a ceremony and erection of a relief plaque with an accompanying inscription on the facade of Antwerp Cathedral. Benefactor Cornelius van der Geest is said to be responsible for the wording, stating: &quot;in his time a smith and afterwards a famous painter&quot;, keeping in accordance with the legends surrounding Matsys&#x27; humble beginnings.

==Legacy==
Matsys&#x27; works include &quot;A Portrait of an Elderly Man&quot; (1513), &quot;Christ presented to the People&quot; (1518–1520) (Prado), and &quot;A Grotesque Old Woman&quot; (or &quot;The Ugly Duchess&quot;), which is perhaps the best-known of his works. It served as a basis for John Tenniel&#x27;s depiction of the Duchess in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. It is likely a depiction of a real person with Paget&#x27;s disease, though it is sometimes said to be a metaphorical portrait of the Margaret, Countess of Tyrol, who was known as &quot;Maultasch&quot;, which, though literally translated &quot;satchel mouth&quot;, was used to mean &quot;ugly woman&quot; or &quot;whore&quot; (because of her marital scandals). His two large triptych altarpieces &quot;The Holy Kinship&quot; or &quot;Saint Anne Altarpiece&quot; (1507–1509) and &quot;The Entombment of the Lord&quot; (1508–1511) are also highly celebrated. Commissioned for the Church of Saint Peter in Leuven, they reflect strong religious feeling and precise detailing characteristic to the majority of his works.

Matsys also painted part of the altarpiece of the Convento da Madre de Deus, in Lisbon. The altar is a primitive invocation of the &quot;Seven Sorrows of Mary&quot;, with boards still evocative of &quot;Our Lady of Sorrows&quot;,&quot;Jesus among the Doctors&quot;, &quot;on the path to Calvary&quot;, &quot;Calvary&quot;, &quot;Lamentation&quot; (all at the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga) and &quot;Flight into Egypt&quot; (Worcester Art Museum). Since the convent was founded by D. Leonor, Queen Dowager of King John II of Portugal and sister of King Manuel of Portugal, in 1509, it appeared that the order of this set has been performed once, with some authors (&quot;Firedlander&quot;) pointing as the date of making the frames years prior to 1511. His &quot;Christ as the Man of Sorrows&quot; is in the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles.

Quentin&#x27;s son, Jan Matsys, inherited the art but did not seek to expand upon his father&#x27;s legacy. The earliest of his works, a &quot;St Jerome&quot; dated 1537, in the gallery of Vienna, as well as the latest, a &quot;Healing of Tobias&quot; of 1564, in the museum of Antwerp, are evidence of his tendency to substitute imitation for originality. Another son, Cornelis Matsys, was also a painter. Jan&#x27;s son, Quentin Metsys the Younger, was an artist of the Tudor court, and painted the &quot;Sieve Portrait&quot; of Elizabeth I of England.

Near the front of the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp is a wrought-iron well, known as the &quot;Matsys Well&quot;, which according to tradition was made by the painter-to-be.

Matsys was a cult figure during the 17th century in Antwerp in addition to being one of the founders of the local school of painting (which climaxed with the career of Peter Paul Rubens).

A penny serial by the British author Pierce Egan the Younger entitled &quot;Quintin Matsys&quot; was published in 1839.

<text>Vibes is a 1988 American romantic adventure comedy film directed by Ken Kwapis and starring Cyndi Lauper, Jeff Goldblum, Julian Sands and Peter Falk. The plot concerns Sylvia, an eccentric psychic, and Nick, her equally odd psychic friend and their trip into the Ecuadorian Andes to find the &quot;source of psychic energy&quot;.

==Plot==
Sylvia Pickel (pronounced with an emphasis on the &quot;kel&quot;) is a trance-medium who has contact with Louise, a wisecracking spirit guide. She first began communicating with her after falling from a ladder at 12 and remaining comatose for two weeks. Subsequently, Louise taught her astral projection while she was placed in special homes for being &quot;different.&quot;

At a study of psychics, Sylvia meets fellow psychic Nick Deezy, a psychometrist who can determine the history of events surrounding an object by touching it. Sylvia has a history of bad luck with men, and her overly flirtatious behavior turns him off right away.

Sylvia comes home to her apartment one night to find Harry Buscafusco lounging in her kitchen. He wants to hire her for $50,000 if she&#x27;ll accompany him to Ecuador where his son has allegedly gone missing. Sylvia recruits Nick who is reluctant but also eager to leave his job as a museum curator where his special talents are abused like a circus act.

Once the two get there, they initially set out to where Harry&#x27;s son was last seen, only to have Nick&#x27;s powers tell them that Harry is up to something. Harry confesses that what he is actually looking for is a lost city of gold up in the mountains and that his last partner, who discovered it, went insane. Nick angrily retreats back to the hotel followed by Sylvia who feels embarrassed over being fooled by yet another man.

At the hotel Nick is attacked by a woman who tries to drug and then stab him, saying &quot;You think you can just come here and take it away from us?&quot; Convinced that there is something important, if dangerous, at work he agrees to trek back into the mountains to search for this lost city.

The group makes a detour to visit Harry&#x27;s former partner, who is in a vegetative state in the hospital. When Nick lays hands on him he receives a jolt of tremendous psychic energy; the former partner immediately dies.

Unexpectedly, the three are set upon by Ingo Swedlin, another psychic from their test group. He holds them at gunpoint and threatens to kill them, but Sylvia uses Louise to get in touch with his long-lost mother and the group escapes. They begin their journey anew only to once again be confronted by Ingo and by Doctor Harrison Steele. Ingo throws a knife into Harry&#x27;s back and kills him, and the other two are taken hostage. They are forced to lead the way to this alleged city of gold.

Upon arriving, the group discovers an ancient pyramid-shaped structure with mystical carvings. Sylvia translates them and they appear to reveal that the location was built by an ancient alien race who has embedded all of the psychic energy of the world into this pyramid. Nick touches the pyramid and discovers the ancient Incan civilization here was destroyed by using the pyramid&#x27;s power on each other. Using the translation Sylvia provided, Ingo attempts to decipher the secret to harnessing the energy, but before he can, Sylvia lays hands on the pyramid and allows the dangerous forces to flow through her. She kills their captors and is nearly killed herself, but survives. However, she permanently loses contact with her spirit guide Louise, who sacrifices herself to save her and Nick in the process.

The two return to their hotel, battered and bruised but thankful that they played a part in releasing a dangerous force. Later that night they reconvene in Sylvia&#x27;s room and bring to fruition a romantic flirtation that has permeated the film. Before they can make love, however, Sylvia hits her head on the headboard and reveals that a spirit guide has re-entered her life. It is not Louise, however, but Harry.

==Cast==
==Production==
The movie was described as &quot;Romancing the Ghostbusters in the Temple of Doom.&quot; It was originally meant to star Lauper and Dan Aykroyd.

Lauper said, &quot;I&#x27;ve wanted to do a movie for a long time, but I didn&#x27;t want to do a typical airhead version of what Hollywood thinks a woman is-and I didn&#x27;t want to do an ultra-serious La Femme! film either. The character I play in this film, Sylvia, is the kind of girl who&#x27;s very conscious of her appearance and always wants to look good, but unfortunately her favorite color is leopard skin. She&#x27;s definitely kooky, but she&#x27;s different from my pop persona.&quot;
Aykroyd met with Lauper and decided he did not want to do the film. Columbia Pictures stood by Lauper and Jeff Goldblum replaced Aykroyd. Filming started in April 1987 in Ecuador. After three weeks, the unit transferred to Los Angeles for the rest of the shoot over nine weeks.

&quot;Acting and performing music come from the same place, but each requires a slightly different technique,&quot; said Lauper. &quot;To play Sylvia, I had to learn to tone everything down. I&#x27;m used to things being exaggerated and larger than life-you know, the eyes going back and forth-because those things work in a big concert hall. To perform for a movie camera, you have to be capable of a certain stillness. That&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve learned here that I enjoy very much.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Vibes&quot; was panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 13% based on 23 reviews.

Roger Ebert gave the film 1 out of 4 stars and wrote: &quot;Movies like &quot;Vibes&quot; appear and disappear like fireflies in the dog days of summer. Nobody seems to have made them, nobody sees them, nobody remembers them.&quot;
&quot;Washington Post&quot; film critic Rita Kempley&#x27;s negative reaction to the film caused her to question Ron Howard&#x27;s judgement for involving himself with the production, writing &quot;Ron Howard must have been in a trance when he agreed to back the project.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Vibes&quot; bombed at the box office, bringing in just $1.7m on a $18m budget.

==Soundtrack==
The original motion picture soundtrack album includes music scored for the film by James Horner. The soundtrack does not contain the song &quot;Hole in My Heart (All the Way to China)&quot; by Cyndi Lauper and written by Richard Orange.

==Home media==
On February 3, 2009, &quot;Vibes&quot; received a DVD release through Sony Pictures&#x27; Martini Movies line.

On February 26, 2014, &quot;Vibes&quot; received a new DVD release through Mill Creek Entertainment under license by Sony.

On February 11, 2020, the film was released to Blu-ray for the first time by Mill Creek Entertainment.

<text>&quot;Hole in My Heart (All the Way to China)&quot; is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Cyndi Lauper for her 1988 film &quot;Vibes&quot;. It was written by Richard Orange, formerly of the band Zuider Zee. The track saw the light of day on an official CD, as of 2003, with the release of the 3-CD compilation, &quot;The Great Cyndi Lauper&quot;. It can be found on the following albums: &quot;Best Movie Album in the World...Ever!&quot; (3 CDs), &quot;True Colors: The Best of Cyndi Lauper&quot; (2 CDs), &quot;36 All-time Favorites&quot; (3 CDs), &quot;Monster Hits 1988/Hits of 1988 and Cyndi Lauper Japanese Singles Collection Greatest Hits (audio track on CD and music video on DVD).&quot;

==Song information==
During a live concert and Q&amp;A appearance in Las Vegas, Cyndi stated her record company thought the song was too fast for radio. Lauper seldom performed this in concert. As part of the &quot;A Night To Remember&quot; tour, it was included in the set list of the Santiago de Chile show in November 1989. 

In 2004, during the Australian leg of her &quot;At Last&quot; tour, she performed part of the song &quot;a cappella&quot; at the request of the audience, since the single reached the Top 10 there in 1988 and was very well known. However, it wasn&#x27;t until the 2006 Body Acoustic Tour that she played the song regularly in full again, and she frequently opened the True Colors 2007 Tour with it. The song was also the opening track of her 2008 Australian Tour.

==Composition==
It was written by Richard Orange. The song length is 4 minutes and 2 seconds. It was written in the key of E major with 168 beats per minute. Orange later recorded his own version of the song, under the title &quot;All The Way To China (Hole In My Heart)&quot;, on the 2005 album &quot;Big Orange Sun&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Pan-European magazine &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; wrote, &quot;Nervous, up-tempo pop song with an incredibly speedy, Westworld-like R&amp;R feel. Try to dance to it.&quot; In the same issue the song was named one of its &quot;singles of the week&quot;.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; called it &quot;an instant classic,&quot; saying that Lauper &quot;delivers an emotional, yet energy-up vocal that works.&quot;

<text>The White Goddess: a Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth is a book-length essay on the nature of poetic myth-making by the English writer Robert Graves. First published in 1948, it is based on earlier articles published in &quot;Wales&quot; magazine; corrected, revised and enlarged editions appeared in 1948, 1952 and 1961.

&quot;The White Goddess&quot; represents an approach to the study of mythology from a decidedly creative and idiosyncratic perspective. Graves proposes the existence of a European deity, the &quot;White Goddess of Birth, Love and Death&quot;, much similar to the &quot;Mother Goddess&quot;, inspired and represented by the phases of the Moon, who lies behind the faces of the diverse goddesses of various European and pagan mythologies.

Graves argues that &quot;true&quot; or &quot;pure&quot; poetry is inextricably linked with the ancient cult-ritual of his proposed White Goddess and her son.

== History ==
Graves first wrote the book under the title of &quot;The Roebuck in the Thicket&quot; in a three-week period during January 1944, only a month after he had finished &quot;The Golden Fleece&quot;. He then left it to focus on &quot;King Jesus,&quot; a historical novel about the life of Jesus. Returning to &quot;The Roebuck in the Thicket&quot;, he renamed it &quot;The Three-Fold Muse&quot;, before finishing it and retitling it as &quot;The White Goddess&quot;. In January 1946 he sent it to the publishers, and in May 1948 it was published in the UK, and in June 1948 in the US, as &quot;The White Goddess: a Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth&quot;.

Graves believed that one could be in the true presence of the White Goddess when reading a poem, but in his view, this could be achieved only by a true poet of the wild, and not a classical poet, or even a Romantic poet, of whom he spoke critically: &quot;The typical poet of the 19th-century was physically degenerate, or ailing, addicted to drugs and melancholia, critically unbalanced and a true poet only in his fatalistic regard for the Goddess as the mistress who commanded his destiny&quot;.

== Poetry and myth ==
Graves described &quot;The White Goddess&quot; as &quot;a historical grammar of the language of poetic myth&quot;. It draws from the mythology and poetry of Wales and Ireland especially, as well as that of most of Western Europe and the ancient Middle East. Relying on arguments from etymology and the use of forensic techniques to uncover what he calls &#x27;iconotropic&#x27; redaction of original myths, Graves argues for the worship of a single goddess under many names, an idea that came to be known as &quot;Matriarchal religion&quot; in feminist theology of the 1970s.

&quot;The Golden Bough&quot; (1922, but first edition published 1890), an early anthropological study by Sir James George Frazer, is the starting point for much of Graves&#x27;s argument, and Graves thought in part that his book made explicit what Frazer only hinted at. Graves wrote: 
Sir James Frazer was able to keep his beautiful rooms at Trinity College, Cambridge until his death by carefully and methodically sailing all around his dangerous subject, as if charting the coastline of a forbidden island without actually committing himself to a declaration that it existed. What he was saying-not-saying was that Christian legend, dogma and ritual are the refinement of a great body of primitive and even barbarous beliefs, and that almost the only original element in Christianity is the personality of Jesus.

Graves&#x27;s &quot;The White Goddess&quot; deals with goddess worship as the prototypical religion, analysing it largely from literary evidence, in myth and poetry.

Graves admitted he was not a medieval historian, but a poet, and thus based his work on the premise that the
language of poetic myth anciently current in the Mediterranean and Northern Europe was a magical language bound up with popular religious ceremonies in honour of the Moon-goddess, or Muse, some of them dating from the Old Stone Age, and that this remains the language of true poetry...
Graves concluded, in the second and expanded edition, that the male-dominant monotheistic god of Judaism and its successors were the cause of the White Goddess&#x27;s downfall, and thus the source of much of the modern world&#x27;s woe. He describes Woman as occupying a higher echelon than mere poet, that of the Muse Herself. He adds: &quot;This is not to say that a woman should refrain from writing poems; only, that she should write as a woman, not as an honorary man.&quot; He seems particularly bothered by the spectre of women&#x27;s writing reflecting male-dominated poetic conventions.

Graves derived some of his ideas from poetic inspiration and a process of &quot;analeptic thought&quot;, which is a term he used for throwing one&#x27;s mind back in time and receiving impressions.

Visual iconography was also important to Graves&#x27;s conception. Graves created a methodology for reading images he called &quot;iconotropy&quot;. To practice this methodology one is required to reduce &quot;speech into its original images and rhythms&quot; and then to combine these &quot;on several simultaneous levels of thought&quot;. By applying this methodology Graves decoded a woodcut of &quot;The Judgement of Paris&quot; as depicting a singular Triple Goddess rather than the traditional Hera, Athena and Aphrodite of the narrative the image illustrates.

==Celtic tree calendar==
Graves argues that the names of the Ogham letters in the alphabet used in parts of Gaelic Ireland and Britain contained a calendar that contained the key to an ancient liturgy involving the human sacrifice of a sacred king, and, further, that these letter names concealed lines of Ancient Greek hexameter describing the goddess.

Graves&#x27; &quot;tree calendar&quot; has no relation to any historical Celtic calendar.
His interpretations rather rely on the book &quot;Ogygia&quot; by the 17th-century bard Roderick O&#x27;Flaherty.

== Druantia ==
In &quot;The White Goddess&quot;, Graves proposed a hypothetical Gallic tree goddess, Druantia, who has become somewhat popular with contemporary Neopagans. Druantia is an archetype of the eternal mother as seen in the evergreen boughs. Her name is believed to be derived from the Celtic word for oak trees, * or *. She is known as &quot;Queen of the Druids&quot;. She is a goddess of fertility for plants and humans, ruling over sexual activities and passion. She also rules protection of trees, knowledge, creativity.

==Scholarship and critical reception==
&quot;The White Goddess&quot; has been seen as a poetic work where Graves gives his notion of man&#x27;s subjection to women in love an &quot;anthropological grandeur&quot; and further mythologises all women in general (and several of Graves&#x27;s lovers in particular) into a three-faced moon goddess model.
Graves&#x27;s value as a poet aside, flaws in his scholarship such as poor philology, use of inadequate texts and outdated archaeology have been criticised. Some scholars, particularly archaeologists, historians and folklorists have rejected the work – which T. S. Eliot called &quot;A prodigious, monstrous, stupefying, indescribable book&quot; – and Graves himself was disappointed that his work was &quot;loudly ignored&quot; by many Celtic scholars.

&quot;The White Goddess&quot; was accepted as history by many non-scholarly readers. According to Ronald Hutton, it &quot;remains a major source of confusion about the ancient Celts and influences many un-scholarly views of Celtic paganism&quot;. Hilda Ellis Davidson criticised Graves as having &quot;misled many innocent readers with his eloquent but deceptive statements about a nebulous goddess in early Celtic literature&quot;, and stated that he was &quot;no authority&quot; on the subject matter he presented. While Graves made the association between Goddesses and the moon appear &quot;natural&quot;, it was not so to the Celts or some other ancient peoples. In response to critics, Graves accused literary scholars of being psychologically incapable of interpreting myth or too concerned with maintaining their perquisites to go against the majority view.

Some Neopagans have been bemused and upset by the scholarly criticism that &quot;The White Goddess&quot; has received in recent years, while others have appreciated its poetic insight but never accepted it as a work of historical veracity. Likewise, a few scholars find some value in Graves&#x27;s ideas; Michael W. Pharand, though quoting earlier criticisms, stated: &quot;Graves&#x27;s theories and conclusions, outlandish as they seemed to his contemporaries (or may appear to us), were the result of careful observation.&quot; The historian Norman Davies references Graves ideas from &quot;The White Goddess&quot; favorably in his book &quot;Europe: A History&quot;. 

According to Graves&#x27;s biographer Richard Perceval Graves, Laura Riding played a crucial role in the development of Graves&#x27;s thoughts when writing &quot;The White Goddess&quot;, despite the fact the two were estranged at that point. On reviewing the book, Riding was furious: &quot;Where once I reigned, now a whorish abomination has sprung to life, a Frankenstein pieced together from the shards of my life and thoughts.&quot;

==Literary influences==
The book was a major influence on the thinking of the poets Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath, with the latter identifying to some extent with the goddess figure herself. Arguably, what Jacqueline Rose called &quot;the cliché behind the myth – woman as inspiration, woman as drudge&quot; – ultimately had a negative impact on Plath&#x27;s life and work.

Alan Garner has cited the book as an influence on his fiction, especially &quot;The Owl Service&quot;. In an interview, Garner has referred to the book as &quot;that most infuriating gold mine of imagery, &quot;The White Goddess&quot;, which I understood with great clarity on the fifth reading.&quot; Susan Cooper has also cited &quot;The White Goddess&quot; as an inspiration for her &quot;The Dark Is Rising Sequence&quot; of fantasy novels. Lloyd Alexander took the names of some of the characters in his &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot; fantasy novels from Graves&#x27; &quot;The White Goddess&quot;.

&quot;The White Goddess&quot; also influenced American science fiction writers. The novels &quot;Sign of the Labrys&quot; by Margaret St. Clair, &quot;Flesh&quot; by Philip José Farmer, and &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; by Joan D. Vinge, were all inspired by the concepts in &quot;The White Goddess&quot;.

<text>The Complutense University of Madrid (, ) is a public research university located in Madrid. Founded in Alcalá in 1293 (before relocating to Madrid in 1836), it is one of the oldest operating universities in the world, and one of Spain&#x27;s most prestigious institutions of higher learning. It is located on a sprawling campus that occupies the entirety of the Ciudad Universitaria district of Madrid, with annexes in the district of Somosaguas in the neighboring city of Pozuelo de Alarcón. It is named after the ancient Roman settlement of Complutum, now an archeological site in Alcalá de Henares, just east of Madrid.

It enrolls over 86,000 students, making it the eighth largest non-distance European university by enrollment. By Royal Decree of 1857, the Central University was the first and only institution in Spain authorized to grant doctorate degrees throughout the Spanish Empire. In 1909, the Central University became one of the first universities in the world to grant a doctorate degree to a woman. It was renamed as (&#x27;University of Madrid&#x27;) in 1943.

==History==
On 20 May 1293, King Sancho IV of Castile granted the Archbishop of Toledo, Gonzalo Pérez Gudiel, a royal charter to found a &#x27; (as universities were known at that time), named &quot;El Estudio de Escuelas Generales&quot; in Alcalá de Henares. One of its alumni, Cardinal Cisneros, made extensive purchases of land and ordered the construction of many buildings, in what became the first university campus ex-novo in history: The &quot;Civitas Dei&quot;, or &quot;city of God&quot;, named after the work of Augustine of Hippo. On 13 April 1499, Cardinal Cisneros secured from Pope Alexander VI a papal bull to expand &quot;Complutense&quot; into a full university. This papal bull conferred official recognition throughout Christendom to all degrees granted by the university. It also renamed the institution , after &#x27;, which was the Latin name of , where the university was originally located.

In the 1509–1510 school year, the Complutense University already operated with five major schools: Arts and Philosophy, Theology, Canon Law, Philology and Medicine. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Complutense University became one of the greatest centers of academic excellence in the world. Many of the leading figures in science, arts and politics of that age studied or taught in Complutense&#x27;s classrooms. Special colleges were created for students of foreign origin, such as Flemish or Irish (at the Irish College of San Jorge at Alcalá de Henares).

In 1785, Complutense became one of the first universities in the world to grant a doctorate to a female student, María Isidra de Guzmán y de la Cerda. In comparison, University of Oxford did not accept female scholars until 1920, and the University of Cambridge did not grant a PhD to a female student until 1926.

In 1824, Francisco Tadeo Calomarde further expanded Complutense by merging it with the University of Sigüenza. By a royal order of 29 October 1836, Queen Regent Maria Christina suppressed the university in Alcalá and ordered its move to Madrid, where it took the name of Literary University and, in 1851, of Central University ().
The Central University awarded Albert Einstein a Doctor of Science degree Honoris Causa on 28 February 1923; this was the first Doctor of Science degree Honoris Causa that Albert Einstein accepted from a European university. In April 1933, Minister for Education and the Arts Fernando de los Ríos, announced that Einstein had agreed to take charge of a professorship in a research institute, which would bear the name &quot;Instituto Albert Einstein&quot;, under the university&#x27;s School of Science. However, as the political situation began to deteriorate throughout Europe, Einstein ended up accepting a similar position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

The university greatly expanded during the 19th century, and its accommodations in central Madrid proved to be increasingly inadequate. Besides the greater number of students, after its move from Alcalá the university had been based in a number of preexisting, government-acquired properties – mainly aristocratic mansions and royal châteaux from centuries past, abandoned by their owners for more contemporary lodgings. Though they were not without their charm, the ancient buildings were not ideal as educational settings, and the early 20th century witnessed the students of the Central University attending philosophy lectures and anatomy lessons in elaborate spaces that had served as ballrooms and salons only a few decades prior.

This situation changed in 1927, when by royal decree King Alfonso XIII ceded state-held lands in the proximity of the Palace of La Moncloa to establish space for the University of Madrid. At the time, this constituted all of the land between the Royal Palace and the Palace of El Pardo, and today it comprises a vast swath of western Madrid referred to as the &quot;Ciudad Universitaria&quot;, or University City of Madrid.
A council appointed by King Alfonso XIII had decided that the new University of Madrid would require the innovative architecture and planning. A team of academics was sent on an international expedition to visit the most prestigious universities in Europe and North America, to combine the best of both continents and design the utopian academic setting. The trip took them to 19 universities in the American northeast, as well as to Paris, Lyon, Oxford, Berlin, Hamburg, and numerous other European cities, all in an effort to discern the best possible building structure. The architectural tendencies of the era, however, ended up having a greater influence than the academics&#x27; visits to Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, La Sorbonne or the University of Berlin; while the final plans from this period are hardly recognizable to anyone familiar with the contemporary campus, the buildings from the era that managed to survive the design revisions, the Civil War and the Franco regime betray the period&#x27;s fondness for the German Bauhaus movement. Indeed, the original buildings, exemplary amongst them the Schools of Medicine, Pharmacy and Odontology, are an homage to structural functionalism and the graceful utilitarianism of the 1920s.

In the 1970s, following the political instability of the regime of Francisco Franco, the University of Madrid was renamed, dividing existing colleges between the Complutense University of Madrid and the Technical University of Madrid. When the city of Alcalá de Henares decided to open a university within the older campus buildings, it was named &quot;&quot; to clearly distinguish it from the Complutense University.

==Today==
The University of Madrid has played a major role in the political development of Spain since its founding. Its graduates have been members, at either congressional or ministerial level, in all of the governments of Spain since the Enlightenment, and their positions in the Second Spanish Republic and the post-Franco transition to democracy were particularly notable. The former first deputy prime minister, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, and the former president, José María Aznar, are both graduates of the university. The Complutense University has also played host to some of the most significant figures of the intellectual world, with a long tradition of visiting professors amongst which feature some of the greats of world academia (most notably, Albert Einstein). A significant part of the European intelligentsia flocked to its halls during the 1930s, when democratic Spain provided a refuge from the rising terrors of fascism. The contemporary Complutense University has also counted numerous Nobel Laureates not only among its graduates, but also its faculty members over the years.
Currently, the Complutense University is the largest university in Spain. During the 2004–2005 academic year the university recorded an enrollment of 91,598 students and employed a staff of 9,500, of which over 6000 are directly involved in teaching duties; the university operates on government subsidies, grants and enrollment funds, with a current annual budget of over €500,000,000 . The university currently offers nearly 80 possible majors, 230 individual degrees, and 221 doctorate programs. The university has over 30 libraries, with over 2 million works in print, a particularly rich archive of over 90,000 historical documents, and one of the most extensive film collections in Europe.

Due to its long history in the capital, the Complutense University enjoys great support from Madrid-based institutions, at a local, national and international level. The School of Medicine operates the Hospital Clínico Universitario de San Carlos, Hospital Gregorio Marañón, and the most famous one, Hospital 12 October, as well as a number of other specialized clinics located on-campus, some of which are operated jointly with the Ministry of Health or perform specific research for the ministry. The School of Medicine is not the only one with government involvement; indeed, despite past conflicts, the Complutense University shares a close bond with the Spanish government, as both the presidential residence of La Moncloa and the Spanish Constitutional Court are located directly on-campus (with the political centre of the city at walking distance).
The School of Communications, meanwhile, enjoys equally good relations with the press (large part of its professors being former reporters, editors, or directors of major Spanish and international newspapers). Moreover, the school is known particularly for its role as one of the premiere pre-screening locales in Spain- all major Spanish film productions are screened first before an audience of Complutense students, with the main actors or production figures of the films attending a post-screening press conference. Most recently, Blanca Portillo, Carmen Maura, Lola Dueñas and Yohana Cobo pre-screened Pedro Almodóvar&#x27;s Volver; past pre-screening visitors have included director Santiago Segura, actor Alejo Sauras, and writer E. Annie Proulx.

The Faculty of Fine Arts was created in 1978, and now offers first degrees in Fine Arts, Design, and Preservation and Restoration of Artistic Patrimony; as well as postgraduate magister&#x27;s and doctorate degrees.

Each year, the Madrid Círculo de Bellas Artes extends special invitations to the Complutense students during its series of annual conferences featuring prominent philosophers, sociologists, and psychologists. Likewise, all of the faculties have been able to benefit greatly by lectures given by some of the most illustrious figures in recent history, of all fields, from singer-songwriter and Catalan activist Joan Manuel Serrat to historian Ernst Gombrich, from writer Umberto Eco to communist politician Santiago Carrillo. Alejandro Amenábar wrote his first film, Tesis, while still attending the Complutense University. All the on-campus scenes in the film were shot in the School of Communications, which Amenábar himself had attended, and the building itself serves as major device in the plot.

==Student life and extracurricular activities==

The Complutense University publishes a bi-monthly newspaper, the &quot;Gaceta Complutense&quot;, and also features a fully operational radio station, Radio Complutense (107.5 FM), which broadcasts for 12 hours daily; both are run from the School of Communications.

While the university has a select number of registered dormitories, these are located on the fringes of the campus within bordering neighborhoods, and therefore no students truly live on the campus proper. Due to the costs, and the fact that university-affiliated lodging is not required, the majority of the Complutense&#x27;s students live independently, either in non-affiliated dormitories or in actual apartments.

The University of Madrid is home to over 100 student political, social and sports-related groups. Aerobics, gym, yoga, swimming, tennis, diving, tai chi, and numerous other courses are offered. In terms of team sports, the Complutense features male and female basketball, football, and volleyball divisions, as well as rugby. Chess, badminton, golf, judo, karate, table-tennis, and archery teams are also available. Internal university games are held several times a year, with all of the different schools competing; the Complutense also participates in the regional university games, held each March at the Puerta del Hierro Stadium in Madrid, and selected national competitions. All students, professors, staff members, and family of staff members have the right to be evaluated and attended to at the Complutense University Center for Sport and Fitness Medicine.

==The Complutense Abroad==
Besides an extensive series of accords permitting student/professor exchanges and study abroad opportunity with prestigious universities throughout the world, the Complutense University of Madrid currently operates four full-time institutions outside of Spain.

*The Real Colegio Complutense at Harvard University (Cambridge, Massachusetts): The RCC was founded as a joint cooperative institution to foster intellectual and scientific interaction between Harvard University and Complutense, with the support of HM King Juan Carlos I, HM Queen Sofia of Spain and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. It follows the tradition of the Royal Spanish College, founded in 1364 to host Spanish Visiting Scholars at the University of Bologna. The RCC accord is the only one of its sort ever to have been approved by Harvard. The institution is directed jointly by the President of Harvard and the Rector of Complutense University, with an academic council formed by 5 Harvard professors and 5 Complutense professors. It permits a select number of Complutense professors to conduct their research at Harvard as visiting scholars. &quot;RCC Fellows&quot; enjoy the same privileges as Harvard&#x27;s non-tenured faculty. Each year the institution hosts the RCC Fellows Lectures, a conference cycle during which the visiting scholars deliver lectures revealing the results of their investigations to an audience of Harvard professors and students. Finally, it also permits a small number of students to attend doctoral school at the university as &quot;research associates&quot;, under scholarships hosted by the Spanish royal family.
*Collège des Hautes Études Européennes Miguel Servet (Paris, France): founded upon the initiative of the Club Européen des Recteurs, the Collège des Hautes Études Européennes Miguel Servet is a Franco-Iberian center of learning and research located within the La Sorbonne. Besides specialized degrees, it offers programs focused on jurisprudence and economy within the European Union, a double-major program in Franco-Iberian law, and the Diplôme de Formation Européenne, which is operates under the auspices of the European Union and UNESCO. It was awarded a status of &#x27;centre d&#x27;excellence&#x27;, and in 1995 it opened chapters in Italy, Portugal, and South America.
*Cátedra Complutense en la Universidad de Karlova (Prague, Czech Republic): Full campus in operation, offering bachelor and doctoral degrees in partnership with Charles University (&quot;Univerzita Karlova v Praze&quot;) in Prague.
*Cátedra Dubcek (Bratislava, Slovakia): Full campus in operation, offering bachelor and doctoral degrees in partnership with Comenius University in Bratislava.

<doc id="90170" wikidata="Q310882" url="?curid=90170" title="Colocasia">
<text>Colocasia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to southeastern Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Some species are widely cultivated and naturalized in other tropical and subtropical regions.

The names elephant-ear and cocoyam are also used for some other large-leaved genera in the Araceae, notably &quot;Xanthosoma&quot; and &quot;Caladium&quot;. The generic name is derived from the ancient Greek word , which in the Koine Greek of the 1st century botanist Pedanius Dioscorides may have meant the edible roots of both taro (&quot;C. esculenta&quot;) and &quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot;.

The species &quot;Colocasia esculenta&quot; is invasive in wetlands along the Gulf Coast of the United States, where it threatens to displace native wetland plants.

==Description==
They are herbaceous perennial plants with a large corm on or just below the ground surface. The leaves are large to very large, long, with a sagittate shape. The elephant&#x27;s-ear plant gets its name from the leaves, which are shaped like a large ear or shield. The plant reproduces mostly by means of rhizomes (tubers, corms), but it also produces &quot;clusters of two to five fragrant inflorescences in the leaf axils&quot;. Like other members of the family, the plant contains an irritant which causes intense discomfort to the lips, mouth and throat. This acridity is caused in part by microscopic needle-like raphides of calcium oxalate monohydrate. It must be processed by cooking, soaking or fermenting – sometimes along with an acid (lime or tamarind) – before being eaten.

==Species==

There are numerous species of &quot;Colocasia&quot;.

# &quot;Colocasia affinis&quot; - Yunnan, Nepal, Assam, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, eastern Himalayas 
# &quot;Colocasia antiquorum&quot; or eddoe, sometimes considered a synonym of &quot;C. esculenta&quot;.
# &quot;Colocasia esculenta&quot; or taro - taro, elephant-ear - native to southern China, the Indian subcontinent, Indochina, Sumatra; naturalized in other parts of Asia as well as Africa, southern Europe, South America, Central America, the West Indies, the southeastern United States, and many oceanic islands including Hawaii
# &quot;Colocasia fallax&quot; - Tibet, Yunnan, Himalayas, northern Indochina
# &quot;Colocasia fontanesii&quot; - Yunnan, eastern Himalayas, northern Indochina
# &quot;Colocasia hassanii&quot; -Bangladesh
# &quot;Colocasia lihengiae&quot; - Arunachal Pradesh, Yunnan
# &quot;Colocasia mannii&quot; - Assam, Nicobar Islands
# &quot;Colocasia menglaensis&quot; - Yunnan, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam 
# &quot;Colocasia oresbia&quot; - Bangladesh, Sabah
# &quot;Colocasia tonoimo&quot; - Unknown

A separate subgroup within the Colocasiae contains one species, which was previously called &quot;C. gigantea&quot;:
# &quot;Leucocasia gigantea&quot; – giant taro - southern China, Indochina, Malaysia, western Indonesia

==Ecology==
&quot;Colocasia&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Palpifer murinus&quot; and &quot;Palpifer sexnotatus&quot;.

== Cultivation ==

&quot;C. esculenta&quot; and other members of the genus are cultivated as ornamental plants, or for their edible corms, a traditional starch staple in many tropical areas.

The plant can be grown in the ground or in large containers. They are grown outside year-round in subtropical and tropical areas. In temperate regions, they are planted out for the summer and dug up and stored over winter, dry and with ventilation to prevent fungal infection. They can be grown in almost any temperature zone as long as the summer is warm. Growth is best at temperatures between . The plants can be damaged if temperatures fall below for more than a few days.

The root tuber is typically planted close to the surface. The first signs of growth will appear in 1 to 3 weeks. The adult plant will need a minimum of at least of space for good growth. They do best in compost-rich soil and in shade, but will grow reasonably well in average soil provided it is moisture-retentive. The plants should not be left to go dry for too long; if this does happen, the leaves will wilt; watering will allow the plant to recover if done before they get too dry. Periodic fertilisation (every 3 to 4 weeks) with a common plant fertiliser will increase yields.

== Culinary uses ==

The edible types are grown in the South Pacific and eaten like potatoes and known as taro, eddoe, and dasheen. The leaves are often boiled with coconut milk to make a soup.

Poi, a Hawaiian dish, is made by boiling the starchy underground stem of the plant then mashing it into a paste.

=== In the Mediterranean===

In Cyprus, Colocasia has been in use since antiquity. Today it is known as kolokasi (Kολοκάσι). It is usually cooked with celery and pork or chicken, in a tomato sauce in casserole. &quot;Baby&quot; kolokasi is called &quot;poulles&quot;: after being fried dry, red wine and coriander seed are added, and then it is served with freshly squeezed lemon. Lately, some restaurants have begun serving thin slices of kolokasi deep fried, calling them &quot;kolokasi chips&quot;.

Apart from Cyprus, Colocasia is found in one other Mediterranean island, the Greek island of Ikaria. After the island was declared a Blue zone its culinary tradition has acquired some popularity and Colocasia is part of that tradition. The plant has been reported to have been a vital source of food during WW II. In Ikaria, after it is boiled it is usually eaten as a salad (with raw onions, herbs, olive oil, lemon etc.).

In Egypt, the tubercles (or kolkas - arabic: قلقاس) are traditionally cut into cubes and cooked in a green soup with celery, chard, garlic and other herbs. Commonly served with white vermicelli rice or eaten with pita bread dipped into the soup. Prepared mostly during the winter time for warmth and widely prepared on January 19th in Christian households as part of celebrating Coptic epiphany. The broth for the soup can be prepared with beef stock and can have some cubes of beef as well.

=== In South Asia ===

Both roots and leaves are eaten. In the Hindi-speaking belt of Northern India and in Pakistan, the root is called &quot;arbi&quot;. Common preparations include cooking with curry, frying, and boiling. 

In Mithalanchal (Bihar), the leaf is called &quot;airkanchan&quot; and is curried.

In Gujarat, arbi leaves are used to make the dish &quot;patra.&quot; In Eastern part of Uttar Pradesh, arbi, known as &quot;arabi ka patta&quot;, is used to make the dish &quot;sahina&quot;. Arbi is also a very popular dish among the Hindu community in South Africa, where it is known as &quot;patha&quot;. In Manipur, the leaves are used in the Meitei ethnic cuisine, locally known as &quot;utti&quot; (pronounce &quot;ootti&quot;). The leaves are called &quot;paangkhoklaa&quot; by the Meiteis, while the edible corms are known as &quot;paan. Paan&quot; is often cooked with fermented soy beans to make curries. It is also used to make eromba, a Meitei side dish.

In Odisha, the root is called &quot;saru&quot;. it is an important ingredient in &quot;dalma&quot;, a popular Odia dish. The leaves used in a dish called &quot;saru magura&quot;, made with rice batter inside the leaf which is steamed and fried.

In Kerala, the leaves are used to make &quot;chēmbilacurry&quot;, &quot;chēmbilāppam&quot;, and the roots are used in &quot;chembü puzhukkü&quot;. Various other recipes also exist locally. The stem and root are used in the preparation of stew and curry. In Kerala, &quot;chembu&quot; is planted in the month of May and can be harvested in December of the same year.

In Maharashtra, the leaves are called &quot;aloo&quot; and are used to make a sweet and sour curry with peanuts and cashew nuts that is commonly cooked during marriages. The leaf bases are mixed with curd to make the side dish &quot;dethi&quot;. The leaves are also coated in besan and fried to make the snack &quot;paatwadi&quot; or &quot;aloowadi&quot;.

In Gujarat, this leaf is called arbi (or &quot;alvi&quot;) and is used to make patra. This is a steamed dish similar to patrode, but with gram flour instead of the rice flour used in patrode. As in Maharashtra, the leaves are eaten as a fried snack.

In Nagaland, the leaves are dried, powdered, kneaded into a dough and baked into biscuits. These biscuits are burnt and dissolved in boiling water before being added into meat dishes to create a thick, flavourful dry gravy.

In Bengal, the plant is called &quot;kachu&quot;. Its leaves are used to wrap fish and prawns for steaming to make &quot;bhapa mach&quot; (steamed fish). The roots are used to make a thick creamy curry in which to cook prawns. The roots and stems are grated with coconut and used to create a chutney.

In South Karnataka particularly in the coastal regions , the leaves are made into a traditional dish called as &#x27;patrode&#x27;or &#x27;patrude&#x27;.

In Himachal Pradesh, in northern India, taro corms are known as ghandyali in Mandi districts, and the plant is also known as kachalu in the Kangra district. The dish called patrodu is made using taro leaves rolled with corn or gram flour and boiled in water. Another dish, pujji is made with mashed leaves and the trunk of the plant and ghandyali or taro corms are prepared as a separate dish. In Shimla, a pancake-style dish, called patra or patid, is made using gram flour.

== In folklore ==
In Meitei mythology and Meitei folklore of Manipur, Colocasia () plants are mentioned. One notable example is the Meitei folktale of the ). In this lore, the old man and his wife, the old woman, were tricked by a group of monkeys to plant the Colocasia plants in an unusual way.
The old couple did according to how they were advised by the monkeys, peeling off the best tubers of the plants, then boiling them in a pot until softened and after cooling them off, wrapping them in banana leaves and burying them in the soils of the farmlands.
In the dead of the night, the monkeys sneak into the farmlands and secretly relished all the well cooked plants. After their dinner, they (monkeys) planted some inedible giant wild Colocasia plants in places to where the old couple placed the cooked plant tubers. Early in the morning, when the old couple woke up, they were surprised to see the plants getting full grown up just after one day of getting the tubers planted. Unaware of the tricks of the monkeys, the old couple cooked and ate the inedible wild Colocasia plants. As a reaction of the wild plants, they suffered from the unbearable tingling sensation in their throats.

== In art ==

In the Levant, Colocasia has been in use since the time of the Byzantine Empire. The leaves are shown in mosaics from Palestine as a platform, such as a plate or bowl, for serving of fruit to eat. For example, at the Kursi church mosaic.

==Nutrition==
Taro roots and leaves are rich in carbohydrates, protein, and dietary minerals. Micronutrients include iron, copper, magnesium, potassium, and zinc.

==Phytochemicals==
Colocasia leaves contain phytochemicals, such as anthraquinones, apigenin, catechins, cinnamic acid derivatives, vitexin, and isovitexin.

The origins of the name &quot;Kukarka&quot; are uncertain. It may derive from Mari words &quot;kü&quot; (stone) and &quot;karman&quot; (fortress) or from &quot;kugyrak&quot; (great). Attempts have been made to trace it to either Udmurt (&quot;kar&quot; &quot;town&quot;) or Turkic (&quot;kukar&quot; &quot;burned-away forest&quot;). It is not related to the Russian word &quot;&quot; (&quot;kukharka&quot;, &quot;female cook&quot;).

==History==
In the 12th century, it was a capital of the local principality of Chumbylat, a renowned Mari leader and warrior. Kukarka was occupied in 1594 by Russians during colonization of Mari land. Later it was a &quot;sloboda&quot; in Vyatka Governorate of the Russian Empire. It was granted urban-type settlement status in 1918. Town status was granted to it in 1937, at which time its name was changed by the Soviet government into &quot;Sovetsk&quot; (lit. Sovietsk).

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Sovetsk serves as the administrative center of Sovetsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Sovetsky District as the Town of Sovetsk. As a municipal division, the Town of Sovetsk is incorporated within Sovetsky Municipal District as Sovetskoye Urban Settlement.

==Notable people==
Sovetsk is the birthplace of Vyacheslav Molotov.

<text>Qʼuqʼumatz (; alternatively Gukumatz) was a god of wind and rain of the Postclassic Kʼicheʼ Maya. It was the Feathered Serpent that according to the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; created the world and humanity, together with the god Tepeu. It carried the sun across the sky and down into the underworld and acted as a mediator between the various powers in the Maya cosmos. It is considered to be the equivalent of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl and of Kukulkan, of the Yucatec Maya.

Qʼuqʼumatz was also associated with water, clouds, and the sky. Together with Tepeu, god of lightning and fire, it was considered to be the mythical ancestor of the Kʼicheʼ nobility by direct male line. 

Kotujaʼ, the Kʼicheʼ king who founded the city of Qʼumarkaj, bore the name of the deity as a title and was likely to have been a former priest of the god. The priests of Qʼuqʼumatz at Qʼumarkaj, the Kʼicheʼ capital, were drawn from the dominant Kaweq dynasty and acted as stewards in the city.

==Etymology==
&quot;Qʼuqʼumatz&quot; (alternatively &quot;Qucumatz&quot;, &quot;Gukumatz&quot;, &quot;Gucumatz&quot;, &quot;Gugumatz&quot;, &quot;Kucumatz&quot;) translates literally as &quot;quetzal serpent&quot; although it is often rendered less accurately as &quot;feathered serpent&quot;. The name derives from the Kʼicheʼ word &quot;qʼuq&quot;, referring to the Resplendent quetzal &quot;Pharomachrus mocinno&quot;, a brightly coloured bird of the cloud forests of southern Mesoamerica. This is combined with the word &quot;kumatz&quot; &quot;snake&quot;. It is likely that the feathered serpent deity was borrowed from the Aztecs or the Maya and blended with other deities to provide the god Qʼuqʼumatz that the Kʼicheʼ worshipped. Qʼuqʼumatz may have had his origin in the Valley of Mexico; some scholars have equated the deity with the Aztec deity Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl, who was also a creator god. Qʼuqʼumatz may originally have been the same god as Tohil, the Kʼicheʼ sun god who also had attributes of the feathered serpent, but they later diverged and each deity came to have a separate priesthood.

==Symbolism==

The male resplendent quetzal boasts iridescent blue-green tail feathers measuring up to long that were prized by the Maya elite. The blue-green feathers symbolized vegetation and the sky, both symbols of life for the ancient Maya, while the bright red feathers of the bird&#x27;s chest symbolized fire. Together, this combination gave a profound religious symbolism to the bird. The snake was a Maya symbol of rebirth due to its habit of shedding its skin to reveal a fresher one underneath. Qʼuqʼumatz thus combined the celestial characteristics of the quetzal with the serpentine underworld powers of the snake, giving him power over all levels of the Maya universe. These characteristics also indicated a sexual duality between his masculine feathered serpent aspect and his feminine association with water and wind. This duality enabled the god to serve as a mediator between the masculine sun god Tohil and the feminine moon goddess Awilix, a role that was symbolized with the Mesoamerican ballgame.

In ancient Maya highland texts Qʼuqʼumatz is strongly associated with water, which in turn is associated with the underworld. The Kʼicheʼ are reported to have believed that Qʼuqʼumatz was a feathered serpent that moved in the water. In the &quot;Annals of the Cakchiquels&quot;, it is related that a group of highland Maya referred to themselves as the &quot;Gucumatz&quot; because their only salvation was said to be in the water. The Kaqchikel Maya were closely linked to the Kʼicheʼ and one of their ancestors, Gagavitz, was said to have thrown himself into Lake Atitlán and transformed himself into the deity, thus raising a storm upon the water known today as Xocomil.

Among the Kʼicheʼ Qʼuqʼumatz not only appeared as a feathered serpent, he was also embodied as an eagle and a jaguar, he was also known to transform himself into a pool of blood. The deity was sometimes represented by a snail or conch shell and was associated with a flute made from bones. As well as being associated with water, Qʼuqʼumatz was also associated with clouds and the wind.

===Sun and the ballgame===

Qʼuqʼumatz was not directly equivalent to the Mexican Quetzalcoatl, he combined his attributes with those of the Classic Period Chontal Maya creator god Itzamna and was a two headed serpentine sky monster that carried the sun across the sky. Sculptures of a human face emerging between the jaws of a serpent were common from the end of the Classic Period through to the Late Postclassic and may represent Qʼuqʼumatz in the act of carrying Hunahpu, the youthful avatar of the sun god Tohil, across the sky. After midday, Qʼuqʼumatz continued into the west and descended towards the underworld bearing an older sun. Such sculptures were used as markers for the Mesoamerican ballgame. Since Qʼuqʼumatz acted as a mediator between Tohil and Awilix and their incarnations as the Maya Hero Twins Hunahpu and Ixbalanque, the positioning of such ballcourt markers on the east and west sides of north-south oriented ballcourts would represent Qʼuqʼumatz carrying the sun to the zenith with the east marker carrying Hunahpu/Tohil in its jaws, while the west marker would represent the descent of the sun into the underworld and would be carrying Ixbalanque/Awilix in its jaws.

No ballgame markers are known from the heart of the Kʼicheʼ kingdom and investigators such as Fox consider it significant that these images of Q&#x27;uq&#x27;umatz carrying the sun are found in the eastern periphery facing the underworld due to the use of the ballgame in mediating political conflict.

===Modern belief===
The various feathered serpent deities remained popular in Mesoamerican folk traditions after the Spanish conquest but by the 20th century Qʼuqʼumatz appeared only rarely among the Kʼicheʼ. A tradition was recorded by Juan de León that Qʼuqʼumatz assisted the sun god Tohil in his daily climb to the zenith. According to De León, who may have gathered the information from elders in Santa Cruz del Quiché, the feathered serpent gripped Tohil in his jaws to carry him safely up into the sky.

==&quot;Popol Vuh&quot;==
In the beginning of the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, Qʼuqʼumatz is depicted as afloat in the primordial sea with Tepeu, wrapped in quetzal feathers. Nothing yet existed, only the sea at rest under the sky. Soon Qʼuqʼumatz and Tepeu discussed the creation of man and it was decided between them to raise the earth and create mankind. The gods spoke the word &quot;Earth&quot; and the earth was formed as if from a mist. They then called forth the mountains from the water and the mountains rose at their command. Forests of pine and cypress then sprung up among the newly formed mountains and valleys. Qʼuqʼumatz was pleased with their collaborative creation of the earth and thanked the other gods that were present. The gods created animals such as the deer, the birds, pumas, jaguars and different types of snakes. They instructed each animal where it should live. The gods then commanded that the animals should give them praise and worship them. However, the animals could not speak and simply squawked, chattered and roared in their own manner. Qʼuqʼumatz soon realized that their first attempt at the creation of beings was a failure as they could not give them praise and so they condemned the animals to live in the forests and ravines. Their animals were ordered to live in the wild and to let their flesh be eaten by the ones who will keep the days of the gods and show them praise.

They first formed men of mud, but in this form man could neither move nor speak and quickly dissolved into nothingness. Later, they created men of sculpted wood, which Huracan destroyed as the wooden manikins were imperfect, emotionless and showed no praise to the gods. The survivors were then transformed into monkeys, and sentenced to live in the wild. Qʼuqʼumatz and Tepeu were finally successful in their creation by constructing men out of maize. Here the first men were formed: Bʼalam Agab, Bʼalam Quitzé, Iqi Bʼalam, Mahucatah. Their sight was far and they understood all.

The Popol Vuh also mentions a historic ruler of the Kʼicheʼ who bore the name or title of the deity, probably because he drew some of his power from the god. This title of &quot;Feathered Serpent&quot;, was an important title used for historical figures in other parts of Mesoamerica, the personal name of this king was likely to have been Kotujaʼ. This individual was likely to have been an &quot;Aj Qʼuqʼumatz&quot;, or priest of Qʼuqʼumatz, before he became the &quot;Aj pop&quot; (king). This king was said to have refounded the Kʼicheʼ capital at Qʼumarkaj.

==Temple and priesthood at Qʼumarkaj==

In the Kʼicheʼ capital city Qʼumarkaj the temple of Qʼuqʼumatz consisted of a circular temple in honor of the deity together with a palace in honor of the Kawek lineage, the ruling dynasty of the city. The only trace of the temple now is a circular impression in the surface of the city&#x27;s main plaza. The temple was located directly between the temples to the important Kʼicheʼ deities Tohil and Awilix, slightly north of the central axis of the temple of Tohil and slightly south of the axis of the temple of Awilix, replicating the role of Qʼuqʼumatz as mediator between the two deities. From the traces left in the plaza it is evident that the temple consisted of a circular wall measuring across, running around a circular platform, with a wide circular passage between the two. The whole structure probably once supported a roof and there were small stone platforms on the east and west sides of the temple, each about wide. The temple of Qʼuqʼumatz must have been completely dismantled very soon after the Spanish Conquest since it is not mentioned by any of the Colonial era visitors, and early drawings of the site show only vegetation where the temple once stood. The tradition of circular temples dedicated to the Feathered Serpent deity was an ancient one in the Mesoamerican cultural region.

The priests of Qʼuqʼumatz were drawn from an important lineage among the ruling Kaweq dynasty and this was likely to have been a source of power and prestige for the Kaweq. The priests were known as &quot;Aj Qʼuqʼumatz&quot;, meaning &quot;he of Qʼuqʼumatz&quot;. The priests of Qʼuqʼumatz and of Tepeu, his partner in the Kʼicheʼ creation myth (the &quot;Aj Qʼuqʼumatz&quot; and the &quot;Tepew Yaki&quot;), also served as stewards in Qʼumarkaj and were responsible for receiving and guarding any tribute payments and plunder that were returned to the city. Although Kʼicheʼ priests were generally of lower rank than secular officials, the priests of the Kaweq lineages were an exception, and this included the priests of Qʼuqʼumatz, Tepeu and Tohil.

<text>Mayahuel () is the female deity associated with the maguey plant among cultures of central Mexico in the Postclassic era of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican chronology, and in particular of the Aztec cultures. As the personification of the maguey plant, Mayahuel is also part of a complex of interrelated maternal and fertility goddesses in Aztec religion and is also connected with notions of fecundity and nourishment.

==Description==

=== Origins from the maguey plant ===

Maguey is a flowering plant of the genus &quot;Agave&quot;, native to parts of southwestern modern United States and Mexico. The depictions of Mayahuel in the Codex Borgia and the Codex Borbonicus show the deity perched upon a maguey plant. The deity&#x27;s positioning in both illustrations, as well as the same blue pigment used to depict her body and the body of the maguey plant on Page 8 of the Codex Borbonicus, give the sense that she and the plant are one. Furthermore, the Codex Borbonicus displays Mayahuel as holding what looks like rope, presumably spun from the maguey plant fibers. Rope was only one of the many products extracted from the maguey plant. Products extracted from the maguey plant were used extensively across highlands and southeastern Mesoamerica, with the thorns used in ritual bloodletting ceremonies and fibers extracted from the leaves worked into ropes, netting, bags, and cloth. Yet, perhaps the maguey product most well-known and celebrated by the Aztecs is the alcoholic beverage &quot;octli&quot;, or later named pulque, produced from the fermented sap of the maguey plant and used prominently in many public ceremonies and on other ritual occasions. By extension, Mayahuel is also often shown in contexts associated with pulque. Although some secondary sources describe her as a &quot;pulque goddess,&quot; she remains most strongly associated with the plant as the source, rather than pulque as the end product.

<doc id="90182" wikidata="Q149042" url="?curid=90182" title="Xōchiquetzal">
<text>In Aztec mythology, Xochiquetzal ( ), also called Ichpochtli , meaning &quot;maiden&quot;), was a goddess associated with fertility, beauty, and love, serving as a protector of young mothers and a patroness of pregnancy, childbirth, and the crafts practiced by women such as weaving and embroidery. In pre-Hispanic Maya culture, a similar figure is Goddess I.

==Name==
The name &quot;Xōchiquetzal&quot; is a compound of &quot;&quot; (“flower”) and &quot;&quot; (“precious feather; quetzal tail feather”). In Classical Nahuatl morphology, the first element in a compound modifies the second and thus the goddess&#x27; name can literally be taken to mean “flower precious feather” or ”flower quetzal feather”. Her alternative name, &quot;Ichpōchtli&quot;, corresponds to a personalized usage of &quot;&quot; (“maiden, young woman”).

==Description==

Unlike several other figures in the complex of Aztec female earth deities connected with agricultural and sexual fecundity, Xochiquetzal is always depicted as an alluring and youthful woman, richly attired and symbolically associated with vegetation and in particular flowers.

By connotation, Xochiquetzal is also representative of human desire, pleasure, and excess, appearing also as patroness of artisans involved in the manufacture of luxury items.

Worshipers wore animal and flower masks at a festival, held in her honor every eight years. Her husband was Tlaloc until Tezcatlipoca kidnapped her and she was forced to marry him. At one point, she was also married to Centeotl and Xiuhtecuhtli.

Anthropologist Hugo Nutini identifies her with the Virgin of Ocotlan in his article on patron saints in Tlaxcala.

== Worship ==
The worship of Xochiquetzal along with Tlaloc partook in the festival of Hueypachtli. During this festival Xochiquetzal was honored and also offered a variety of gifts consisting of flower offerings, drinking and fornications. A young woman was chosen to be a &quot;ixiptlatli&quot; which impersonated the goddess and was decapitated, flayed and her skin was worn by a selected man who would then weave as part of a representation of &quot;the gender ambiguity embodied in the cult of lunar deities&quot;.

<text>An altered chord is a chord that replaces one or more notes from the diatonic scale with a neighboring pitch from the chromatic scale. By the broadest definition, any chord with a non-diatonic chord tone is an altered chord. The simplest example of altered chords is the use of borrowed chords, chords borrowed from the parallel key, and the most common is the use of secondary dominants. As Alfred Blatter explains, &quot;An altered chord occurs when one of the standard, functional chords is given another quality by the modification of one or more components of the chord.&quot;

For example, altered notes may be used as leading tones to emphasize their diatonic neighbors. Contrast this with chord extensions:

In jazz harmony, chromatic alteration is either the addition of notes not in the scale or expansion of a [chord] progression by adding extra non-diatonic chords. For example, &quot;A C major scale with an added D note, for instance, is a chromatically altered scale&quot; while, &quot;one bar of Cmaj7 moving to Fmaj7 in the next bar can be chromatically altered by adding the ii and V of Fmaj7 on the second two beats of bar&quot; one. Techniques include the ii–V–I turnaround, as well as movement by half-step or minor third.

The five most common types of altered dominants are: V, V5 (both with raised fifths), V, V5 (both with lowered fifths), and V (with lowered fifth and third, the latter enharmonic to a raised ninth).

==Background==

&quot;Borrowing&quot; of this type appears in music from the Renaissance music era and the Baroque music era (1600–1750)—such as with the use of the Picardy third, in which a piece in a minor key has a final or intermediate cadence in the tonic major chord. &quot;Borrowing&quot; is also common in 20th century popular music and rock music.

For example, in music in a major key, such as C major, composers and songwriters may use a B major chord, that they &quot;borrow&quot; from the key of C minor (where it is the VII chord). Similarly, in music in a minor key, composers and songwriters often &quot;borrow&quot; chords from the tonic major. For example, pieces in C minor often use F major and G major (IV and V chords), which they &quot;borrow&quot; from C major.

More advanced types of altered chords were used by Romantic music era composers in the 19th century, such as Chopin, and by jazz composers and improvisers in the 20th and 21st century. For example, the chord progression on the left uses four unaltered chords, while the progression on the right uses an altered IV chord and is an alteration of the previous progression:

The A in the altered chord serves as a leading tone to G, which is the root of the next chord.


According to one definition, &quot;when a chord is chromatically altered, and the thirds remain large [major] or small [minor], and is not used in modulation, it is an altered chord.&quot; According to another, &quot;all chords...having a major third, i.e., either triads, sevenths, or ninths, with the fifth chromatically raised or chromatically lowered, are altered chords,&quot; while triads with a single altered note are considered, &quot;changes of form ,&quot; rather than alteration.

According to composer Percy Goetschius, &quot;Altered...chords contain one or more tones written with accidentals (, , or ) and therefore foreign to the scale in which they appear, but nevertheless, from their connections and their effect, obviously belonging to the principal key of their phrase.&quot; Richard Franko Goldman argues that, once one accepts, &quot;the variability of the scale,&quot; the concept of altered chords becomes unnecessary: &quot;In reality, there is nothing &#x27;altered&#x27; about them; they are entirely natural elements of a single key system,&quot; and it is, &quot;not necessary,&quot; to use the term as each &#x27;altered chord&#x27; is, &quot;simply one of the possibilities regularly existing and employed.&quot;

Dan Haerle argues that only fifths and ninths may be altered, as all other alterations may be interpreted as an unaltered chord tone or, enharmonically, as an altered fifth or ninth (for example, 1 = 9 and 4 = 3).

== Altered seventh chord ==

An altered seventh chord is a seventh chord with one, or all, of its factors raised or lowered by a semitone (altered), for example, the augmented seventh chord (7+ or 7+5) featuring a raised fifth (C E G B (C7+5: C–E–G–B). The factors most likely to be altered are the fifth, then the ninth, then the thirteenth. In classical music, the raised fifth is more common than the lowered fifth, which in a dominant chord adds Phrygian flavor through the introduction of .
== Altered dominant chord ==
An altered dominant chord is, &quot;a dominant triad of a 7th chord that contains a raised or lowered fifth and sometimes a lowered 3rd.&quot; According to Dan Haerle, &quot;Generally, altered dominants can be divided into three main groups: altered 5th, altered 9th, and altered 5th and 9th.&quot; This definition allows three to five options, including the original:

Alfred Music gives nine options for altered dominants, the last four of which contain two alterations each:
Pianist Noah Baerman writes that &quot;The point of having an altered note in a dominant chord is to build more tension (leading to a correspondingly more powerful resolution).&quot;

== Alt chord ==
In jazz, the term &quot;altered chord&quot;, notated generally as a root, followed by &quot;7alt&quot; (e.g. G7alt), refers to a dominant chord that fits entirely into the altered scale of the root. This means that the chord has the root, major third, minor seventh, and one or more altered tones, but does not have the natural fifth, ninth, eleventh, or thirteenth. An altered chord typically contains both an altered fifth and an altered ninth. To alter a tone is simply to raise or lower it by a semitone.

Altered chords may include &quot;both&quot; a flattened and sharpened form of the altered fifth or ninth, e.g. A7(599); however, it is more common to use only one such alteration per tone, e.g. B7(59) (which may also be spelled as B7(913)).

&lt;/score&gt;

The raised fifteenth is only used when the ninth in a chord is natural. It functions as a minor ninth, creating a major seventh interval with the natural ninth, assuming that the chord is in root position. The notation of a raised fifteenth is a fairly modern addition to Western harmony, and they have been popularized by contemporary musicians like Jacob Collier. Natural fifteenths are never notated as alterations or extensions, as they are enharmonically equivalent to the root. For example, a chord that includes a raised fifteenth could look something like Gmaj13(1115), or if it were written as a polychord, .

In practice, many fake books do not specify all the alterations; the chord is typically just labelled as G7alt, and the alteration of ninths, elevenths, thirteenths, and fifteenths is left to the artistic discretion of the comping musician. The use of chords labeled G7alt can create challenges in jazz ensembles where more than one chordal instrument are playing chords (e.g., a large band with an electric guitar, piano, vibes, and/or a Hammond organ), because the guitarist might interpret a G7alt chord as containing a 9 and 11, whereas the organ player may interpret the same chord as containing a 9 and a 13, resulting in every tone from the altered scale at once, likely a far denser and more dissonant harmonic cluster than the composer intended. To deal with this issue, bands with more than one chordal instrument may work out the alt chord voicings beforehand or alternate playing of choruses.

The choice of inversion, or the omission of certain tones within the chord (e.g. omitting the root, common in jazz harmony and chord voicings), can lead to many different possible colorings, substitutions, and enharmonic equivalents. Altered chords are ambiguous harmonically, and may play a variety of roles, depending on such factors as voicing, modulation, and voice leading.

The altered chord&#x27;s harmony is built on the altered scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C), which includes all the alterations shown in the chord elements above:

* root
*9 (= 2)
*9 (= 2 or 3)
* major third (enharmonically, as 4)
*11 (= 4 or 5)
*13 (= 5)
*7

Because they do not have natural fifths, altered dominant (7alt) chords support tritone substitution (5 substitution). Thus, the 7alt chord on a given root can be substituted with the 1311 chord on the root a tritone away (e.g., G7alt is the same as D1311).

<doc id="90185" wikidata="Q756797" url="?curid=90185" title="Tezcatlipoca">
<text>Tezcatlipoca ( ) or Tezcatl Ipoca was a central deity in Aztec religion. He is associated with a variety of concepts, including the night sky, hurricanes, obsidian, and conflict. He was considered one of the four sons of Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl, the primordial dual deity. His main festival was Toxcatl, which, like most religious festivals of Aztec culture, involved human sacrifice.

Tezcatlipoca&#x27;s nagual, his animal counterpart, was the jaguar. In the form of a jaguar he became the deity Tepeyollotl (&quot;Mountainheart&quot;). In one of the two main Aztec calendars (the Tonalpohualli), Tezcatlipoca ruled the trecena &quot;1 Ocelotl&quot; (&quot;1 Jaguar&quot;); he was also patron of the days with the name &quot;Acatl&quot; (&quot;reed&quot;). A strong connection with the calendar as a whole is suggested by his depiction in texts such as the Codex Borgia and Codex Fejéváry-Mayer, where Tezcatlipoca is surrounded by day signs, implying a sort of mastery over them.

A talisman related to Tezcatlipoca was a disc worn as a chest pectoral, called the &quot;anahuatl&quot;. This talisman was carved out of abalone shell and depicted on the chest of both Huitzilopochtli and Tezcatlipoca in codex illustrations.

The origins of Tezcatlipoca can be traced to earlier Mesoamerican deities worshipped by the Olmec and Maya. Similarities exist between Tezcatlipoca and the patron deity of the K&#x27;iche&#x27; Maya, Tohil, as described in the Popol Vuh. The name Tohil refers to obsidian and he was associated with sacrifice. The Classic Maya god of rulership and thunder, K&#x27;awiil (known to modern Mayanists as &quot;God K&quot;, or the &quot;Manikin Scepter&quot;), was depicted with a smoking obsidian knife in his forehead and one leg replaced with a snake. Although there are striking similarities between possible earlier imagery of Tezcatlipoca, archaeologists and art historians are split in the debate. It is possible that he is the same god that the Olmec and Maya term their &quot;jaguar deity&quot;, or alternately that he is an Aztec expansion on foundations set by the Olmec and Maya, as the Aztecs routinely took deliberate inspiration from earlier Mesoamerican cultures.

== Etymology ==
Tezcatlipoca is often translated from the Nahuatl as &quot;smoking mirror.&quot; It alludes to his connection to obsidian, the material from which mirrors were made in Mesoamerica. They were used for shamanic rituals and prophecy, and as such Tezcatlipoca is additionally associated with divination.

Tezcatlipoca had many epithets which alluded to different aspects of his deity and also point to his centrality in Aztec worship. Bernardino de Sahagún, in Book VI of the &quot;Florentine Codex&quot;, refers to Tezcatlipoca with 360 different forms. These include:

* &quot;Tloque Nahuaque&quot;, meaning &quot;lord of the near and nigh&quot;; &quot;the one who owns what surrounds [us]&quot;
* &quot;Titlacahuan&quot;, &quot;Titlacahua&quot; or &quot;Titlacaua&quot;, meaning &quot; [of whom] we are [his] servants&quot;; &quot;[he] whose [servants] we are&quot;
* &quot;Tehimatini&quot;, meaning &quot;the wise&quot;; &quot;the one who understands people&quot;
* &quot;Tlazopilli&quot;, meaning &quot;the precious nobleman&quot;; &quot;the precious son&quot;
* &quot;Teyocoyani&quot;, meaning &quot;the creator [of people]&quot;
* &quot;Yáotl&quot; or &quot;Yaotzin&quot;, meaning &quot;the enemy&quot;; &quot;the venerable enemy&quot;
* &quot;Icnoacatzintli&quot;, meaning &quot;the merciful&quot;
* &quot;Ipalnemoani&quot;, meaning &quot;[he] by whom [we] all live&quot;
* &quot;Ilhuicahua&quot;, meaning &quot;possessor of heaven&quot;
* &quot;Tlalticpaque&quot;, meaning &quot;possessor of the earth&quot;
* &quot;Monenequi&quot;, meaning &quot;the arbitrary&quot;; &quot;the one who pretends&quot;
* &quot;Pilhoacatzintli&quot;, meaning &quot;revered father&quot;; &quot;possessor of children&quot;
* &quot;Tlacatlé&quot; &quot;Totecué&quot;, meaning &quot;our master, our lord&quot;
* &quot;Yoalli&quot; &quot;Ehécatl&quot;, &quot;Yohualli&quot; &quot;Ehécatl&quot; or &quot;Youalli Ehécatl&quot;, meaning &quot;night wind&quot;(metaphor for &quot;invisible&quot; or &quot;impalpable&quot;)
* &quot;Monantzin&quot;, meaning &quot;your mother&quot;
* &quot;Motatzin&quot;, meaning &quot;your father&quot;
* &quot;Telpochtli&quot;, meaning &quot;[the] young man&quot;
* &quot;Moyocoyani&quot; or &quot;Moyocoani&quot;, meaning &quot;the one who creates himself.&quot; His calendrical name is &quot;Ome Ácatl, &quot;&quot;Two Reed&quot;, and under that name he consecrates himself as another deity.

==Representations==

Few representations of Tezcatlipoca survive into the present day, due in large part to a significant portion of codices being destroyed by Catholic priests. Simultaneously, some Aztec texts note that the darkness and omnipresence of Tezcatlipoca make him something akin to &quot;invisible&quot;, thus direct representations of him are considered inadequate or even impossible. Still, multiple depictions of the deity exist, and common trends and symbols can be identified. 

=== Iconography ===
One of the most recognizable iconographic details of Tezcatlipoca is his face paint, called &quot;mixchictlapanticac.&quot; Most commonly, he is shown with horizontal bands of black and yellow, though codices may vary in which two colors are depicted. Mary Miller has posited that the combination of yellow and black might be a connection to the jaguar, with which Tezcatlipoca is associated. Black is the foremost color associated with Tezcatlipoca, not only because of his role as a god of nighttime and darkness, but to differentiate him from the other three so-called Tezcatlipocas (Quetzalcoatl, Huitzilopoctli, and Xipe-Totec) and their respective colors (white, blue, and red). Which parts of his body are painted black varies by site; half of his leg, the full length of his arms, the majority of his legs, or any combination thereof can be depicted. Later scholarship has identified the black material with which the god was supposedly painted as &quot;tezcatlipoctli.&quot;

He is often depicted with various symbolic objects in place of his right foot, such as an obsidian mirror, bone, or a serpent. This is an allusion to the creation myth, in which Tezcatlipoca loses his foot battling with the earth monster Cipactli. The obsidian mirror may also appear on his chest, as a breastplate, and often is shown emanating smoke — a literal representation of his name and role. In the majority of representations, Tezcatlipoca bears the mirror in one hand, where it is surrounded by feathers of various colors.Tezcatlipoca often wears a headdress of feathers, flowers, and/or flint knives. His head could be additionally ornamented with the symbol for smoke. Heron feathers or balls of eagle down, like that from which Huitzilopochtli was born, often adorned his head, clothing, and shield. He variably wore earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and other jewelry, all rendered in precious materials like gold and jade. A motif of skulls and crossbones is recorded appearing in some pictures, but likely would have followed the European popularization of such a design. Many iconographic elements highlight Tezcatlipoca&#x27;s role as a warrior, including his shield, his &quot;anahuatl&quot; breastplate, his arrow nose ring, and his spears, or arrows.

=== &quot;Ezpitzal&quot; ===
Scholar Juan José Batalla Rosado has identified an iconographic element unique to depictions of Tezcatlipoca in codices from central Mexico, which both Rosado and Sahagún call the &quot;&quot;ezpitzal&quot;.&quot; The term is likely derived from the Nahuatl words for &quot;blood&quot; (&quot;eztli&quot;) and &quot;to become enflamed with anger&quot; or &quot;to rise with anger&quot; (&quot;pitza&quot;). Alternate translations for &quot;pitza&quot; make reference to blowing or playing instruments like the flute, which appear during the Tozcatl fest and may then have some relation with Tezcatlipoca himself. The term &quot;ezpitzal&quot; has since been translated as &quot;flow of blood&quot;, but Rosado additionally points out the sense of rage and violence the &quot;ezpitzal&quot; is meant to signify—an element which points to Tezcatlipoca&#x27;s nature and his role as a god of conflict. The &quot;ezpitzal&quot; is one or more streams of blood shown emanating from Tezcatlipoca&#x27;s head, sometimes accompanied by the symbol for a flint knife or a heart. In some cases, the idea of the &quot;ezpitzal&quot; was artistically transformed into a headband or garland, adorned with flowers or stones.

=== Codex Fejéváry-Mayer ===

The frontispiece of the Codex Fejéváry-Mayer, one of the more well-known images from Aztec codices, features a god circumscribed in the 20 &quot;trecena,&quot; or day symbols, of the &quot;Tōnalpōhualli&quot;. The exact identity of this god is unclear, but is most likely either Tezcatlipoca or Xiuhtecutli. The figure has yellow and black face paint, as is characteristic of Tezcatlipoca. But as Olivier points out, &quot;gods like Xiuhtecutli or Huitzilopoctli have similar facial painting.&quot; The figure is also shown with two unaltered feet, but does possess the white sandals, armbands, and adorned ears and head of Tezcatlipoca. He also carries arrows and a spear, the typical weapons of the war god. Finally, perhaps coincidentally, the figure is bounded on the left side by the symbols for &quot;acatl&quot; (reed) and &quot;tecpatl&quot; (flint knife), both of which are associated with Tezcatlipoca. 

Depicting either Tezcatlipoca and Xiuhtecutli surrounded by calendrical symbols is equally logical in both cases, as Tezcatlipoca is represented in other codices in association with the calendar, and Xiuhtecutli was a god of the sun and passage of time. The page also features the &quot;ollin&quot; symbol, a &quot;trecena&quot; that additionally represented eras of time, including the five suns. These mythological eras were begun by Tezcatlipoca, but Aztec festivals which celebrated the completion of eras involved worship of Xiuhtecutli. The codex features additional, more standardized depictions of both deities in its later pages.

==Temples==
Many of the temples associated with Tezcatlipoca are built facing east–west, as Olivier quotes Felipe Solis: &quot;the sacred building of the war god [Tezcatlipoca] was in direct relation with the movement of the sun, in the same manner of the Great Temple was, their façades being towards the West&quot;. There are also several references to &quot;momoztli&quot;. Although the exact definition of the &quot;momoztli&quot; is unknown, with definitions varying from &quot;mound&quot;, &quot;stone seat&quot; and &quot;temple&quot;, there is an overall consensus that it is a general holy place to worship the gods, specifically mentioned as &quot;his [Tezcatlipoca&#x27;s] viewing place&quot;.

==Priests==
The priests of Tezcatlipoca often wore the ornaments of the god and wore specific garments for different rituals. Most frequently worn were white turkey feather headdresses, a paper loincloth, and a &quot;tzanatl&quot; stick with similar feathers and paper decorations. Another common practice was to cover themselves in black soot or ground charcoal while they were involved in priestly activities at the temple or during rituals. They would also cover the sick and newly appointed king in a similar manner with a black ointment to encourage an association with the god. When the ritual called for it, priests would also dress up as Tezcatlipoca himself and accompany other similarly outfitted gods or goddesses.

Several types of priests were dedicated to the service of Tezcatlipoca, one of them likely being the one Sahagún calls &quot;huitznahuac teohua omacatl&quot;. Others were the &quot;calmeca teteuctin&quot; who were allowed to eat the ritual food offered to Tezcatlipoca, still more accompanied the impersonator of Tezcatlipoca in the year prior to his execution. Honoring Tezcatlipoca was fundamental to both the priesthood and the nobility. &quot;On his installation&quot;, the new king fasted and meditated, &quot;which included prayers in honor of Tezcatlipoca, the patron deity of the royal house&quot;. Tezcatlipoca&#x27;s priests were offered into his service by their parents as children, often because they were sick. These children would then have their skin painted black and be adorned with quail feathers in the image of the god. Sacred hymns were also chanted at ceremonies to honor the gods. Most were sung to praise the highest deities, including Tezcatlipoca, who was often addressed as the &quot;Giver of Life&quot;. In one hymn, he is mentioned as being both the creator and destroyer of the world, and both as a poet and a scribe. Everyone, including commoners, high priests, and the king, were involved in some aspect of the Toxcatl ceremonies.

==Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl==
Tezcatlipoca was often described as a rival of another important god of the Aztecs: the culture hero, Quetzalcoatl. In one version of the Aztec creation account the myth of the Five Suns, the first creation, &quot;The Sun of the Earth&quot; was ruled by Tezcatlipoca but destroyed by Quetzalcoatl when he struck down Tezcatlipoca who then transformed into a jaguar. Quetzalcoatl became the ruler of the subsequent creation &quot;Sun of Water&quot;, and Tezcatlipoca destroyed the third creation &quot;The Sun of Wind&quot; by striking down Quetzalcoatl.

In later myths, the four gods who created the world, Tezcatlipoca, Quetzalcoatl, Huitzilopochtli and Xipe Totec were referred to respectively as the Black, the White, the Blue and the Red Tezcatlipoca. The four Tezcatlipocas were the sons of Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl, lady and lord of the duality, and were the creators of all the other gods, as well as the world and all humanity.

The rivalry between Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca is also recounted in the legends of Tollan, wherein Tezcatlipoca deceives Quetzalcoatl, ruler of the legendary city, and forces him into exile. Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca both collaborated in the different creations and that both were seen as instrumental in the creation of life. Karl Taube and Mary Miller, specialists in Mesoamerican studies, write that, &quot;More than anything Tezcatlipoca appears to be the embodiment of change through conflict.&quot; A large and detailed depiction of Tezcatlipoca appears in the Codex Borgia carrying the 20 day signs of the calendar; in the Codex Cospi he is shown as a spirit of darkness, as well as in the Codex Laud and the Dresden Codex. His cult was associated with royalty, and was the subject of the most lengthy and reverent prayers in the rites of kingship, as well as being mentioned frequently in coronation speeches. The temple of Tezcatlipoca was in the Great Precinct of Tenochtitlan.

==Creation stories==
In one of the Aztec accounts of creation, Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca joined forces to create the world. Before their act there was only the sea and the primordial, crocodilian earth monster called Cipactli. To attract her, Tezcatlipoca used his foot as bait for Cipactli, and she, in turn, ate it. The two gods then captured her, and distorted her to make the land from her body. After that, they created the people, and people had to offer sacrifices to comfort Cipactli for her sufferings. Because of this, Tezcatlipoca is depicted with a missing foot.

Following this, Tezcatlipoca turned himself into the sun. As a result of his transformation, this and all subsequent ages of humanity were referred to as the five suns. Quetzalcoatl was furious, so he knocked Tezcatlipoca out of the sky with a stone club. Angered, Tezcatlipoca turned into a jaguar and destroyed the world. Quetzalcoatl, then, replaced him as the sun and started the second age of the world, and it became populated again.

Tezcatlipoca overthrew Quetzalcoatl, forcing him to send a great wind that devastated the world, and the people who survived were turned into monkeys. Tlaloc, the god of rain, then became the sun. But he had his wife stolen away by Tezcatlipoca. Angered in turn, he would not make it rain for several years until, in a fit of rage, he made it rain fire. The few people who survived the assault turned into the birds.

Chalchiuhtlicue the Water Goddess then became the sun. However, she was crushed by Tezcatlipoca&#x27;s accusation that she only pretended to be kind. She cried for many years and the world was destroyed by the resulting floods. Those who survived the deluge were turned into fish.

== Aztec religion and reverence ==
According to Aztec belief, Tezcatlipoca had a great many associations: the night sky, night winds, hurricanes, the north, the earth, obsidian, hostility, discord, rulership, divination, temptation, jaguars, sorcery, beauty, war, and conflict.

His main temple in Tenochtitlan was located south of the Templo Mayor. According to Diego Durán, it was &quot;lofty and magnificently built. Eighty steps led to a landing twelve or fourteen feet wide. Beyond it stood a wide, long chamber the size of a great hall ...&quot;. There were several smaller temples dedicated to Tezcatlipoca in the city, among them the ones called &quot;Tlacochcalco&quot; and &quot;Huitznahuatl&quot;. Tezcatlipoca was also worshipped in many other Nahua cities such as Texcoco, Tlaxcala and Chalco. Each temple had a statue of the god for which copal incense was burned four times a day.

The Codex Magliabechiano contains a passage relating Tezcatlipoca with the &quot;temascal&quot;, or sweatbath. The text states, &quot;when any sick person went to the bath house, [they] offered incense, which they call &quot;copal&quot;, to the idol and covered the body in black in veneration of the idol they call Tezcatepocatl [Tezcatlipoca], who is one of their major gods.&quot; Despite these references, Mary Miller states that the deity actually depicted in codex illustrations and the one more likely to be associated with the &quot;temascal&quot; is Tlazoteotl.

=== Toxcatl ===
Tezcatlipoca&#x27;s main feast was Toxcatl, which occurred during the eponymous fifth month of the Aztec calendar. The preparations began a year in advance, when a young man was chosen by priests to become the likeness of Tezcatlipoca. This individual was called the &quot;teixiptla&quot; or &quot;deity impersonator&quot; and was chosen to ceremonially represent the god to the Aztec people. The &quot;teixiptla&quot; was usually selected from among captive warriors, and the chosen individual was bathed and ceremoniously cleansed for the role that he was to undertake. Sometimes, slaves were purchased for the ceremony. Benardino de Sahagún describes in the Florentine Codex how the &quot;teixiptla&quot; must possess certain physical qualities in order to be worthy of becoming Tezcatlipoca:

For he who was chosen was of fair countenance, of good understanding and quick, clean body— slender like a reed; long and thin like a stout cane; well-built; not of overfed body, not corpulent, and neither very small nor exceedingly tall. [He was] like something smoothed, like a tomato, or like a pebble, as if hewn of wood ... He who was thus, without flaw, who had no [bodily] defects, who had no blemishes, no moles, who had no lacerations or wrinkles on his body, they then looked well that he be taught to blow the flute ...

For the duration of Toxcatl&#x27;s preparation, the &quot;teixiptla&quot; lived as a god would, wearing expensive jewelry and having eight attendants. The young man also was dressed in the likeness of the god and people on the streets would worship him as such when encountered. &quot;For one year he lived a life of honor,&quot; the handsome young man &quot;worshipped literally as the embodiment of the deity&quot;. During the last 20 days before being sacrificed, the &quot;teixiptla&quot; had their appearance transformed back to that of a warrior. &quot;He had been a warrior who was captured, and he ended his life as a warrior.&quot; He would then be wed to four young women, also chosen in advance and isolated for a full year and treated as goddesses. This marriage, occurring after a full year of abstinence, symbolized a period of fertility which followed the drought. The young man would spend his last week singing, feasting and dancing. During the feast where he was worshipped as the deity he personified, he climbed the stairs to the top of the temple on his own where the priests seized him, a time in which he proceeded to symbolically crush &quot;one by one the clay flutes on which he had played in his brief moment of glory&quot;, and then was sacrificed, his body being eaten later. The young man would approach this sacrifice willingly, as being sacrificed in this manner was a great honor. &quot;Sacrificial victims mounted the bloody steps of the pyramid with dignity and pride.&quot; &quot;The sacrifice itself marked the end of the drought.&quot; Immediately after he died a new victim for the next year&#x27;s ceremony was chosen. Tezcatlipoca was also honoured during the ceremony of the ninth month, when the &quot;Miccailhuitontli&quot; &quot;Little Feast of the Dead&quot; was celebrated to honour the dead, as well as during the &quot;Panquetzaliztli&quot; &quot;Raising of Banners&quot; ceremony in the 15th month.

For Aztec nobility, this &quot;patron deity&quot; is fundamental in the social and natural phenomena justified by religion during this time. Extreme reverence and respect, characterized by ceremonial proceedings in which priests were &quot;to pay homage&quot; to Tezcatlipoca, or where &quot;citizens waited expectantly&quot; for ceremonial proceedings to start under the low hum of &quot;shell trumpets,&quot; were commonplace, especially for this deity. Utter respect from the highest position of Aztec nobility, the king, shown through the figurative and literal nakedness of his presence in front of Tezcatlipoca. The king would stand &quot;naked, emphasizing his utter unworthiness&quot;, speaking as nothing but a vessel for the god&#x27;s will. The new king would claim his spiritual nakedness symbolically through words and physical vulnerability, praising Tezcatlipoca with lines such as:

&lt;poem&gt;O master, O our lord, O lord of the near, of the night, O night, O wind ... Poor am I.
In what manner shall I act for thy city? In what manner shall I act for the governed, for the vassals (macehualtin)?
For I am blind, I am deaf, I am an imbecile, and in excrement, in filth hath my lifetime been ...
Perhaps thou mistaketh me for another; perhaps thou seekest another in my stead&lt;/poem&gt;

For kings, lords, priests, and citizens alike, the cyclical nature they observed every day and every year was portrayed not through science or philosophical debate, but utter reverence and respect for the spiritual beings they believed were the cause of these events. It was gods like Tezcatlipoca that solidified this notion, representing both the silent wind, and thunderous war.

<text>Chalchiuhtlicue (from &quot;chālchihuitl&quot; &quot;jade&quot; and &quot;cuēitl&quot; &quot;skirt&quot;) (also spelled Chalciuhtlicue, Chalchiuhcueye, or Chalcihuitlicue) (&quot;She of the Jade Skirt&quot;) is an Aztec deity of water, rivers, seas, streams, storms, and baptism. Chalchiuhtlicue is associated with fertility, and she is the patroness of childbirth. Chalchiuhtlicue was highly revered in Aztec culture at the time of the Spanish conquest, and she was an important deity figure in the Postclassic Aztec realm of central Mexico. Chalchiuhtlicue belongs to a larger group of Aztec rain gods, and she is closely related to another Aztec water god called Chalchiuhtlatonal.

==Religious significance==
Chalchiuitlicue directly translates to &quot;Jade her skirt&quot;; however, her name is most commonly interpreted as &quot;she of the jade skirt.&quot; She was also known as Chalchiuhtlatonac (chalchihu[itl]-tla-tona-c) &quot;She who shines like jade&quot; and Matlalcueye &quot;Possessor of the Blue Skirt&quot; by the Tlaxcalans, an indigenous group who inhabited the republic of Tlaxcala.

Chalchiuitlicue was the wife or sister of the Aztec god of rain Tlaloc, depending on the text. Tlaloc and Chalchiuitlicue share similar attributes as they are both water deities; however, Chalchiuitlicue was often associated with groundwater, unlike Tlaloc. She was also the mother of the Aztec moon god Tecciztecatl. In other texts, she was the wife of Xiuhtecuhtli, who was a senior deity for the Aztecs.

In Aztec religion, Chalchiuitlicue helps Tlaloc to rule the paradisial kingdom of Tlalocan. Chalchiutlicue brings fertility to crops and is thought to protect women and children.

According to myths, Chalchiuhtlicue once ate the sun and the moon. She is often associated with serpents, as most Aztec water deities are. It is thought that her association with water and fertility speaks to the Aztecs&#x27; association with the womb and water. She often withheld a dual role in Aztec mythology as both a life-giver and life-ender. In the Aztec creation myth of the Five Suns, Chalchiuhtlicue presided over the Fourth Sun or the fourth creation of the world. It is believed that Chalchiuhtlicue retaliated against Tlaloc&#x27;s mistreatment of her by releasing 52 years of rain, causing a giant flood which caused the Fourth Sun to be destroyed. She built a bridge linking heaven and earth and those who were in Chalchiuhtlicue&#x27;s good graces were allowed to traverse it, while others were turned into fish. Following the flood, the Fifth Sun developed. The Fifth Sun is the world which we now occupy. During her reign the Aztecs first began to use maize, which became a paramount staple in their diet and economy.

Chalchiutlicue was associated with the many fasciates of water as well as being credited with being involved with the death of those who died in drowning accidents.

In addition to water-related deaths, Chalchiuhtlicue presided over birth rituals, bathing of sacrificial victims and ceremonial actors, judiciary purification, royal investiture, and the recycling of ritual waste.

Chalchiuhtlicue was often depicted as &quot;a river, out of which grew a prickly pear cactus laden with fruit, which symbolized the human heart.&quot; (Schwartz 2018, 14). She was believed to be the personification of youth, beauty, and zeal, although she should not be confused with Tlazolteotl (also known as Ixucuina or Tlaelquani), who was the Aztec goddess of midwives, steam baths, purification, sin, and was the patroness of adulterers. Although the two goddesses often overlapped, they were distinct from one another.

==Archaeological records==
Chalchiutlicue is depicted in several central Mexican manuscripts, including the Pre-Columbian Codex Borgia (plates 11 and 65), the 16th century Codex Borbonicus (page 5), the 16th century Codex Ríos (page 17), and the Florentine Codex (plate 11). When represented through sculpture, Chalchiutlicue is often carved from green stone in accordance with her name.

The Pyramid of the Moon is a large pyramid located in Teotihuacán, the dominant political power in the central Mexican region during the Early Classic period (ca. 200–600 CE). The pyramid is thought to have been at one point dedicated to Chalchiutlicue. It accompanies The Pyramid of the Sun, which is thought to have been dedicated to Chalchiutlicue&#x27;s husband Tlaloc.

In the mid-19th century, archaeologists unearthed a 20-ton monolithic sculpture depicting a water goddess that is believed to be Chalchiuhtlicue from underneath The Pyramid of the Moon. The sculpture was excavated from the plaza forecourt of the Pyramid of the Moon structure. The sculpture was relocated by Leopoldo Batres to Mexico City in 1889, where it is presently in the collection of the Museo Nacional de Antropología.
==Visual representations==
Chalchihuitlicue wears a distinctive headdress, which consists of several broad, likely cotton bands trimmed with amaranth seeds. Large round tassels fall from either side of the headdress. Chalchihuitlicue typically wears a shawl adorned with tassels and a skirt. She is often depicted sitting with a stream of water flowing out of or from behind her skirt.

In the Codex Borbonicus (page 5), Chalchihuitlicue wears an elaborate blue and white headdress. She sits on a red stool and a stream of water flows out from the bottom of her stool. A male baby and female baby, who are depicted as if swimming, are carried in the water.

In the Codex Borgia (page 65), Chalchihuitlicue sits on a red throne and a river flows outwards from behind her body. Two figures stand in the water and Chalchihuitlicue gesticulates out towards them. She wears an elaborate yellow headdress.

==Rites and rituals==
Five of the 20 big celebrations in the Aztec calendar were dedicated to Chalchiutlicue and her husband (or brother) Tlaloc. During these celebrations, priests dove into a lake and imitated the movements and the croaking of frogs, hoping to bring rain.

Chalchiutlicue presides over the day &quot;5 Serpent&quot; and the trecena of &quot;1 Reed&quot;. Her feast is celebrated in the ventena of &quot;Etzalqualiztli&quot;. She is associated with the fertility of both people and land, and the Aztecs asked Chalchiutlicue for a good harvest of crops.

A series of ritualistic ceremonies were performed and dedicated to Chalchiuhtlicue and other childbirth/water deities called Atlcahualo. These ceremonies would last the entire month of February.

===Childbirth===
Chalchiutlicue was the guardian of the children and newborns. When children fell ill, healers called on the goddess as they practiced hydromancy in order to find the &quot;tonalli&quot; (spirits) of sick children. She also played a central role in the process of childbirth. Mothers and babies often died in the process of childbirth; the role of the midwife was also of utmost importance in the process. During labor, the midwife spoke to the newborn and ask the gods that the baby&#x27;s birth ensure a prime place among them. After cutting the umbilical cord, the midwife washed the new baby with customary greetings to Chalchiutlicue. Four days after the birth, the child was given a second bath and a name.

As reported by Sahagún&#x27;s informants, the midwife said, &quot;The gods Ometecutli and Omecioatl who realm in the ninth and tenth heavens, have begotten you in this light and brought you into this world full of calamity and pain take then this water, which will protect you life, in the name of the goddess Chalchiutlicue.&quot; She then sprinkled water at the head of the child and said, &quot;Behold this element without whose assistance no mortal being can survive.&quot; She also sprinkled water on the breast of the baby while saying, &quot;Receive this celestial water that washes impurity from your heart.&quot; She then went to the head and said, &quot;Son, receive this divine water, which must be drank that all may live that it may wash you and wash away all your misfortunes, part of the life since the beginning of the world: this water in truth has a unique power to oppose misfortune.&quot; Finally, the midwife washed the entire body of the baby and said, &quot;In which part of you is unhappiness hidden? Or in which part are you hiding? Leave this child, today, he is born again in the healthful waters in which he has been bathed, as mandated by the will of the god of the sea Chalchiutlicue.&quot;

<doc id="90189" wikidata="Q1884529" url="?curid=90189" title="Tēcciztēcatl">
<text>In Aztec mythology, Tecciztecatl ( , &quot;person from Tēcciztlān,&quot; a place name meaning &quot;Place of the Conch,&quot; from &quot;tēcciztli&quot; or &quot;conch&quot;; also Tecuciztecatl, Teucciztecatl, from the variant form &quot;tēucciztli&quot;) was a lunar deity, representing the Man in the Moon.

The Aztecs believed that they were living in a universe dominated by generations of sun gods, the current one, known as Tonatiuh, was the fifth. The first three previous suns perished by wind storms, jaguars and fiery rain. The fourth was wiped out by a flood when people turned into fish and spread through the ocean. After the fourth sun perished, the Aztecs believed that the gods assembled to decide which god was to become the next sun. They built a bonfire to sacrifice the next volunteer. Two gods – Nanahuatzin and Tecciztecatl – vied for the honor. Nanahuatzin, a poor god, was chosen because he could be spared. Proud Tecciztecatl insisted on the honor, but at the last moment hesitated. Nanahuatzin showed more courage and jumped into the fire. Tecciztecatl gained his courage and followed Nanahuatzin, thus forming two suns in the sky. The gods, being somewhat class conscious, were angry that rich and proud Tecciztecatl had to follow humble Nanahuatzin, threw a rabbit at Tecciztecatl leaving an imprint of the rabbit&#x27;s shape and dimming Tecciztecatl&#x27;s brightness to the point where he could only be seen at night.

In some depictions, Tecciztecatl carried a large, white seashell on his back, &quot;tēucciztli&quot; in Nahuatl, representing the Moon itself; in others he had butterfly wings. He was a son of Tlaloc and Chalchiuhtlicue.

<text>The Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religion (retitled The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion in its second edition) is a wide-ranging, comparative study of mythology and religion, written by the Scottish anthropologist Sir James George Frazer. &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; was first published in two volumes in 1890; in three volumes in 1900; and in twelve volumes in the third edition, published 1906–1915. It has also been published in several different one-volume abridgments. The work was for a wide literate audience raised on tales as told in such publications as Thomas Bulfinch&#x27;s &quot;The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes&quot; (1855). The influence of &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; on contemporary European literature and thought has been substantial.

==Summary==
Frazer attempted to define the shared elements of religious belief and scientific thought, discussing fertility rites, human sacrifice, the dying god, the scapegoat, and many other symbols and practices whose influences had extended into 20th-century culture. His thesis is that the most ancient religions were fertility cults that revolved around the worship and periodic sacrifice of a sacred king in accordance with the cycle of the seasons. Frazer proposed that mankind&#x27;s understanding of the natural world progresses from magic through religious belief to scientific thought.
Frazer&#x27;s thesis was developed in relation to an incident in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, in which Aeneas and the Sibyl present the golden bough taken from a sacred grove to the gatekeeper of Hades to gain admission. The incident was illustrated by J. M. W. Turner&#x27;s 1834 painting &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;. Frazer mistakenly states that the painting depicts the lake at Nemi, though it is actually Lake Avernus. The lake of Nemi, also known as &quot;Diana&#x27;s Mirror&quot;, was a place where religious ceremonies and the &quot;fulfillment of vows&quot; of priests and kings were held.

Frazer based his thesis on the pre-Roman priest-king Rex Nemorensis, a priest of Diana at Lake Nemi, who was ritually murdered by his successor. The king was the incarnation of a dying and reviving god, a solar deity who underwent a mystic marriage to a goddess of the Earth, died at the harvest and was reincarnated in the spring. Frazer claims that this legend of rebirth was central to almost all of the world&#x27;s mythologies.

Frazer wrote in a preface to the third edition of &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; that while he had never studied Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, his friend James Ward, and the philosopher J. M. E. McTaggart, had both suggested to him that Hegel had anticipated his view of &quot;the nature and historical relations of magic and religion&quot;. Frazer saw the resemblance as being that &quot;we both hold that in the mental evolution of humanity an age of magic preceded an age of religion, and that the characteristic difference between magic and religion is that, whereas magic aims at controlling nature directly, religion aims at controlling it indirectly through the mediation of a powerful supernatural being or beings to whom man appeals for help and protection.&quot; Frazer included an extract from Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion&quot; (1832).

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Golden Bough&quot; scandalized the British public when first published, as it included the Christian story of the resurrection of Jesus in its comparative study. Critics thought this treatment invited an agnostic reading of the Lamb of God as a relic of a pagan religion. For the third edition, Frazer placed his analysis of the Crucifixion in a speculative appendix, while discussion of Christianity was excluded from the single-volume abridged edition.

Frazer himself accepted that his theories were speculative and that the associations he made were circumstantial and usually based only on resemblance. He wrote: &quot;Books like mine, merely speculation, will be superseded sooner or later (the sooner the better for the sake of truth) by better induction based on fuller knowledge.&quot; In 1922, at the inauguration of the Frazer Lectureship in Anthropology, he said: &quot;It is my earnest wish that the lectureship should be used solely for the disinterested pursuit of truth, and not for the dissemination and propagation of any theories or opinions of mine.&quot; Godfrey Lienhardt notes that even during Frazer&#x27;s lifetime, social anthropologists &quot;had for the most part distanced themselves from his theories and opinions&quot;, and that the lasting influence of &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; and Frazer&#x27;s wider body of work &quot;has been in the literary rather than the academic world.&quot;
Robert Ackerman writes that, for British social anthropologists, Frazer is still &quot;an embarrassment&quot; for being &quot;the most famous of them all&quot; even as the field now rejects most of his ideas. While &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; achieved wide &quot;popular appeal&quot; and exerted a &quot;disproportionate&quot; influence &quot;on so many [20th-century] creative writers&quot;, Frazer&#x27;s ideas played &quot;a much smaller part&quot; in the history of academic social anthropology. Lienhardt himself dismissed Frazer&#x27;s interpretations of primitive religion as &quot;little more than plausible constructs of [Frazer&#x27;s] own Victorian rationalism&quot;, while Ludwig Wittgenstein, in his &quot;Remarks on Frazer&#x27;s Golden Bough&quot; (published in 1967), wrote: &quot;Frazer is much more savage than most of his &#x27;savages&#x27; [since] his explanations of [their] observances are much cruder than the sense of the observances themselves.&quot; R.G. Collingwood shared Wittgenstein&#x27;s criticism. 

Initially, the book&#x27;s influence on the emerging discipline of anthropology was pervasive. Polish anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski said of &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;: &quot;No sooner had I read this great work than I became immersed in it and enslaved by it. I realized then that anthropology, as presented by Sir James Frazer, is a great science, worthy of as much devotion as any of her elder and more exact studies and I became bound to the service of Frazerian anthropology.&quot; However, by the 1920s, Frazer&#x27;s ideas already &quot;began to belong to the past&quot;: according to Godfrey Lienhardt: 
Edmund Leach, &quot;one of the most impatient critics of Frazer&#x27;s overblown prose and literary embellishment of his sources for dramatic effect&quot;, scathingly criticized what he saw as the artistic license exercised by Frazer in &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;: &quot;Frazer used his ethnographic evidence, which he culled from here, there and everywhere, to &quot;illustrate&quot; propositions which he had arrived at in advance by &quot;a priori&quot; reasoning, but, to a degree which is often quite startling, whenever the evidence did not fit he simply altered the evidence!&quot;

René Girard, a French historian, literary critic, and philosopher of social science, &quot;grudgingly&quot; praised Frazer for recognising kingly sacrifice as &quot;a key primitive ritual&quot;, but described his interpretation of the ritual as &quot;a grave injustice to ethnology.&quot; Girard&#x27;s criticisms against &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; were numerous, particularly concerning Frazer&#x27;s assertion that Christianity was merely a perpetuation of primitive myth-ritualism and that the New Testament Gospels were &quot;just further myths of the death and resurrection of the king who embodies the god of vegetation.&quot; Girard himself considered the Gospels to be &quot;revelatory texts&quot; rather than myths or the remains of &quot;ignorant superstition&quot;, and rejected Frazer&#x27;s idea that the death of Jesus was a sacrifice, &quot;whatever definition we may give for that sacrifice.&quot;

==Literary influence==
Despite the controversy generated by the work, and its critical reception amongst other scholars, &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; inspired much of the creative literature of the period. The poet Robert Graves adapted Frazer&#x27;s concept of the dying king sacrificed for the good of the kingdom to the romantic idea of the poet&#x27;s suffering for the sake of his Muse-Goddess, as reflected in his book on poetry, rituals, and myths, &quot;The White Goddess&quot; (1948). William Butler Yeats refers to Frazer&#x27;s thesis in his poem &quot;Sailing to Byzantium&quot;. The horror writer H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s understanding of religion was influenced by &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, and Lovecraft mentions the book in his short story &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;. T. S. Eliot acknowledged indebtedness to Frazer in his first note to his poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot;. William Carlos Williams refers to &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; in Book Two, part two, of &quot;Paterson&quot;. Frazer also influenced novelists James Joyce, Ernest Hemingway, William Gaddis and D. H. Lawrence.

The lyrics of the song &quot;Not to Touch the Earth&quot; by the Doors were influenced by &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, with the title and opening lines being taken from its table of contents. Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; shows the antagonist Kurtz with the book in his lair, and his death is depicted as a ritual sacrifice. 

The mythologist Joseph Campbell drew on &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; in &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; (1949), in which he accepted Frazer&#x27;s view that mythology is a primitive attempt to explain the world of nature, though considering it only one among a number of valid explanations of mythology. Campbell later described Frazer&#x27;s work as &quot;monumental&quot;. The anthropologist Weston La Barre described Frazer as &quot;the last of the scholastics&quot; in &quot;The Human Animal&quot; (1955). The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s commentaries on &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; have been compiled as &quot;Remarks on Frazer&#x27;s Golden Bough&quot;, edited by Rush Rhees, originally published in 1967 (the English edition followed in 1979). Robert Ackerman, in his &quot;The Myth and Ritual School: J. G. Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists&quot; (1991), sets Frazer in the broader context of the history of ideas. The myth and ritual school includes scholars Jane Harrison, Gilbert Murray, F. M. Cornford, and A.B. Cook, who were connecting the new discipline of myth theory and anthropology with traditional literary classics at the end of the 19th century, influencing Modernist literature. &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; influenced Sigmund Freud&#x27;s work &quot;Totem and Taboo&quot; (1913), as well as the work of Freud&#x27;s student Carl Jung.

The critic Camille Paglia has identified &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; as one of the most important influences on her book &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; (1990). In &quot;Sexual Personae&quot;, Paglia described Frazer&#x27;s &quot;most brilliant perception&quot; in &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; as his &quot;analogy between Jesus and the dying gods&quot;, though she noted that it was &quot;muted by prudence&quot;. In &quot;Salon&quot;, she has described the work as &quot;a model of intriguing specificity wed to speculative imagination.&quot; Paglia acknowledged that &quot;many details in Frazer have been contradicted or superseded&quot;, but maintained that the work of Frazer&#x27;s Cambridge school of classical anthropology &quot;will remain inspirational for enterprising students seeking escape from today&#x27;s sterile academic climate.&quot; Paglia has also commented, however, that the one-volume abridgement of &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; is &quot;bland&quot; and should be &quot;avoided like the plague.&quot;

<text>Mictlan () is the underworld of Aztec mythology. Most people who die would travel to Mictlan, although other possibilities exist (see &quot;Other destinations&quot;, below). Mictlan consists of nine distinct levels.

The journey from the first level to the ninth is difficult and takes four years, but the dead are aided by the psychopomp, Xolotl. The dead must pass many challenges, such as crossing a mountain range where the mountains crash into each other, a field with wind that blows flesh-scraping knives, and a river of blood with fearsome jaguars.

Mictlan also features in the Aztec creation myth. Mictlantecuhtli set a pit to trap Quetzalcoatl. When Quetzalcoatl entered Mictlan seeking bones with which to create humans, Mictlantecuhtli was waiting. He asked Quetzalcoatl to travel around Mictlan four times blowing a conch shell with no holes. Quetzalcoatl eventually put some bees in the conch shell to make sound. Fooled, Mictlantecuhtli showed Quetzalcoatl to the bones. But Quetzalcoatl fell into the pit and some of the bones broke. The Aztecs believed this is why people&#x27;s height are different.

Mictlan is believed to be ruled by King Mictlantecuhtli (&quot;Lord of the Underworld&quot;) and his wife, Mictecacihuatl (&quot;Lady of the Underworld&quot;).

Other deities in Mictlan include Cihuacoatl (who commanded Mictlan spirits called Cihuateteo), Acolmiztli, Chalmecacihuilt, Chalmecatl and Acolnahuacatl.

==Relationship to Nahuatl creation mythology==

The nine regions of Mictlán (also known as Chiconauhmictlán) in Aztec mythology take shape within the Nahua worldview of space and time as parts of a universe composed of living forces. According to Mexica mythology, in the beginning, there were two primordial gods, Omecíhuatl and Ometecuhtli, whose children became the creator gods. The names of these creator gods were Xipetótec, Tezcatlipoca, Quetzalcóatl, and Huitzilopochtli, and they inherited the art of creation from their parents. From the preexisting matter, after 600 years of inactivity, Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcóatl organized the vertical and horizontal universes, where the horizontal universe was composed of cardinal or hemispheric directions and the vertical universe was composed of two parts, a higher and a lower. The higher part was supported by four gigantic trees, growing in each corner of the Tlalocán (the central part of the universe). Such imagery is also found in the idea of a world tree, such as Yggdrasil in Norse mythology, Jian Mu in Chinese mythology or the Ashvattha fig in Hindu mythology. These trees impeded the joining of the Overworld (the higher world) and the Underworld (the lower world) to Tlaltícpac (the earth). The earth was a land formed from the body of Cipactli, the crocodilomorphic sea monster, and was a solid, living land that generated food for humankind. Cipactli was mother nature, from whom was created the surface and soil that was Tlaltícpac.

The myth recounts the following. From Cipactli&#x27;s hair sprang trees, flowers and plants, from her skin sprang plains, valleys and river sediments, from her eyes came wells, caves, and fountains, from her mouth sprang rivers, lakes and streams, from her nose came valleys, ranges and mesas, from her shoulders the saw-toothed mountain ranges, volcanoes and mountains. As they organized the universe horizontally and vertically, the four creator gods forged the pairs of gods who would control each area of power: the water (Tlaloc and Chalchiuhtlicue), the earth (Tlaltecuhtli and Tlalcíhuatl), fire (Xiuhtecuhtli and Chantico) and the dead (Mictlantecuhtli and Mictecacíhuatl).

==Other destinations==
In addition to Mictlan, the dead could also go to other destinations:
*Warriors who died in battle and those who died as a sacrifice went east and accompanied the sun during the morning.
*Women who died in childbirth went to the west and accompanied the sun when it set in the evening.
*People who died of drowning — or from other causes that were linked to the rain god Tlaloc, such as certain diseases and lightning — went to a paradise called Tlalocan.

<text>In Aztec mythology, Xolotl () was a god of fire and lightning. He was commonly depicted as a dog-headed man and was a soul-guide for the dead. He was also god of twins, monsters, death, misfortune, sickness, and deformities. Xolotl is the canine brother and twin of Quetzalcoatl, the pair being sons of the virgin Chimalma. He is the dark personification of Venus, the evening star, and was associated with heavenly fire. The axolotl is named after him.

== Myths and functions ==

Xolotl was the sinister god of monstrosities who wears the spirally-twisted wind jewel and the ear ornaments of Quetzalcoatl. His job was to protect the sun from the dangers of the underworld. As a double of Quetzalcoatl, he carries his conch-like ehecailacacozcatl or wind jewel. Xolotl accompanied Quetzalcoatl to Mictlan, the land of the dead, or the underworld, to retrieve the bones from those who inhabited the previous world (Nahui Atl) to create new life for the present world, Nahui Ollin, the sun of movement. In a sense, this re-creation of life is reenacted every night when Xolotl guides the sun through the underworld. In the tonalpohualli, Xolotl rules over day Ollin (movement) and over trecena 1-Cozcacuauhtli (vulture).

His empty eye sockets are explained in the legend of Teotihuacan, in which the gods decided to sacrifice themselves for the newly created sun. Xolotl withdrew from this sacrifice and wept so much his eyes fell out of their sockets.
According to the creation recounted in the Florentine Codex, after the Fifth Sun was initially created, it did not move. Ehecatl (&quot;God of Wind&quot;) consequently began slaying all other gods to induce the newly created Sun into movement. Xolotl, however, was unwilling to die in order to give movement to the new Sun. Xolotl transformed himself into a young maize plant with two stalks (xolotl), a doubled maguey plant (mexolotl), and an amphibious animal (axolotl). Xolotl is thus a master transformer. In the end, Ehecatl succeeded in finding and killing Xolotl.

In art, Xolotl was typically depicted as a dog-headed man, a skeleton, or a deformed monster with reversed feet. An incense burner in the form of a skeletal canine depicts Xolotl. As a psychopomp, Xolotl would guide the dead on their journey to Mictlan the afterlife in myths. His two spirit animal forms are the Xoloitzcuintli dog and the water salamander species known as the Axolotl. Xolos served as companions to the Aztecs in this life and also in the after-life, as many dog remains and dog sculptures have been found in Aztec burials, including some at the main temple in Tenochtitlan. Dogs were often subject to ritual sacrifice so that they could accompany their master on his voyage through Mictlan, the underworld. Their main duty was to help their owners cross a deep river. It is possible that dog sculptures also found in burials were also intended to help people on this journey. Xoloitzcuintli is the official name of the Mexican Hairless Dog (also known as &quot;perro pelón mexicano&quot; in Mexican Spanish), a pre-Columbian canine breed from Mesoamerica dating back to over 3,500 years ago. This is one of many native dog breeds in the Americas and it is often confused with the Peruvian Hairless Dog. The name &quot;Xoloitzcuintli&quot; references Xolotl because this dog&#x27;s mission was to accompany the souls of the dead in their journey into eternity. The name &quot;Axolotl&quot; comes from Nahuatl, the Aztec language. One translation of the name connects the Axolotl to Xolotl. The most common translation is &quot;water-dog&quot; . &quot;Atl&quot; for water and &quot;Xolotl&quot; for dog.

In the Aztec calendar, the ruler of the day, Itzcuintli (&quot;Dog&quot;), is Mictlantecuhtli, the god of death and lord of Mictlan, the afterlife.

== Origin ==

Xolotl is sometimes depicted carrying a torch in the surviving Maya codices, which reference the Maya tradition that the dog brought fire to mankind. In the Mayan codices, the dog is conspicuously associated with the god of death, storm, and lightning. Xolotl appears to have affinities with the Zapotec and Maya lightning-dog, and may represent the lightning which descends from the thundercloud, the flash, the reflection of which arouses the misconceived belief that lightning is &quot;double&quot;, and leads them to suppose a connection between lightning and twins.

Xolotl originated in the southern regions, and may represent fire rushing down from the heavens or light flaming up in the heavens. Xolotl was originally the name for lightning beast of the Maya tribe, often taking the form of a dog. The dog plays an important role in Maya manuscripts. He is the lightning beast, who darts from heaven with a torch in his hand. Xolotl is represented directly as a dog, and is distinguished as the deity of air and of the four directions of the wind by Quetzalcoatl&#x27;s breast ornament. Xolotl is to be considered equivalent to the beast darting from heaven of the Maya manuscript. The dog is the animal of the dead and therefore of the Place of Shadows.

== Ollin and Xolotl ==
Eduard Seler associates Xolotl&#x27;s portrayal as a dog with the belief that dogs accompany the souls of the dead to Mictlan. He finds further evidence of the association between Xolotl, dogs, death, and Mictlan in the fact that Mesoamericans viewed twins as unnatural monstrosities and consequently commonly killed one of the two twins shortly after birth. Seler speculates that Xolotl represents the murdered twin who dwells in the darkness of Mictlan, while Quetzalcoatl (&quot;The Precious Twin&quot;) represents the surviving twin who dwells in the light of the sun.

In manuscripts the setting sun, devoured by the earth, is opposite Xolotl&#x27;s image. Quetzalcoatl and Xolotl constitute the twin phases of Venus as the morning and evening star, respectively. Quetzalcoatl as the morning star acts as the harbinger of the Sun&#x27;s rising (rebirth) every dawn, Xolotl as the evening star acts as the harbinger of the Sun&#x27;s setting (death) every dusk. In this way they divide the single life-death process of cyclical transformation into its two phases: one leading from birth to death, the other from death to birth.

Xolotl was the patron of the Mesoamerican ballgame. Some scholars argue the ballgame symbolizes the Sun&#x27;s perilous and uncertain nighttime journey through the underworld. Xolotl is able to help in the Sun&#x27;s rebirth since he possesses the power to enter and exit the underworld. In several of the manuscripts Xolotl is depicted striving at this game against other gods. For example, in the Codex Mendoza we see him playing with the moon-god, and can recognize him by the sign ollin which accompanies him, and by the gouged-out eye in which that symbol ends. Seler thinks &quot;that the root of the name ollin suggested to Mexicans the motion of the rubber ball &quot;olli&quot; and, as a consequence, ball-playing.&quot;

Ollin is pulsating, oscillating, and centering motion-change. It is typified by bouncing balls, pulsating hearts, labor contractions, earthquakes, flapping butterfly wings, the undulating motion of weft activities in weaving, and the oscillating path of the Fifth Sun over and under the surface of the earth. Ollin is the motion-change of cyclical completion.

A jade statue of a skeletal Xolotl carrying a solar disc bearing an image of the Sun on his back (called &quot;the Night Traveler&quot;) succinctly portrays Xolotl&#x27;s role in assisting the Sun through the process of death, gestation, and rebirth. Xolotl&#x27;s association with ollin motion-change suggests proper completions and gestations must instantiate ollin motion-change. Ollin-shaped decomposition and integration (i.e., death) promote ollin-shaped composition and integration (i.e., rebirth and renewal).

== Nanahuatzin and Xolotl ==

A close relationship between Xolotl and Nanahuatzin exists. Xolotl is probably identical with Nanahuatl (Nanahuatzin).
Seler characterizes Nanahuatzin (&quot;Little Pustule Covered One&quot;), who is deformed by syphilis, as an aspect of Xolotl in his capacity as god of monsters, deforming diseases, and deformities. The syphilitic god Nanahuatzin is an avatar of Xolotl.

<text>Coatlicue (; , , &quot;skirt of snakes&quot;), wife of Mixcōhuātl, also known as  (, &quot;mother of the gods&quot;) is the Aztec goddess who gave birth to the moon, stars, and Huītzilōpōchtli, the god of the sun and war. The goddesses Toci &quot;our grandmother&quot; and Cihuacōātl &quot;snake woman&quot;, the patron of women who die in childbirth, were also seen as aspects of Cōātlīcue.

== Etymology ==
The goddess&#x27; Classical Nahuatl name can be rendered both &quot;Cōātlīcue&quot; and &quot;Cōātl īcue&quot;, from &quot;&quot; &quot;snake&quot; and &quot;&quot; &quot;her skirt&quot;, roughly meaning &quot;[she who has] the skirt of snakes&quot;. The name &quot;Tēteoh īnnān&quot;, from &quot;&quot;, plural of &quot;&quot; &quot;god&quot;, + &quot;&quot; &quot;their mother&quot;, refers directly to her maternal role.

== Myths ==
Coatlicue is represented as a woman wearing a skirt of writhing snakes and a necklace made of human hearts, hands, and skulls. Her feet and hands are adorned with claws and her breasts are depicted as hanging flaccid from pregnancy. Her face is formed by two facing serpents, which represent blood spurting from her neck after she was decapitated. 

According to Aztec legend, Coatlicue was once magically impregnated by a ball of feathers that fell on her while she was sweeping a temple. She subsequently gave birth to the god Huitzilopochtli. Her daughter the goddess Coyolxauhqui then rallied Coatlicue&#x27;s four hundred other children together and goaded them into attacking and decapitating their mother. The instant she was killed, the god Huitzilopochtli suddenly emerged from her womb fully grown and armed for battle. He killed many of his brothers and sisters, including Coyolxauhqui, who he decapitated, dismembered, and threw into the sky to become the moon. In one variation on this legend, Huitzilopochtli himself is the child conceived in the ball-of-feathers incident and is born just in time to save his mother from harm.

Cecelia Klein argues that the famous Coatlicue statue in the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico, and several other complete and fragmentary versions, may represent a personified snake skirt. The reference is to one version of the creation of the present Sun. The myth relates that the present Sun began after the deities gathered at Teotihuacan and sacrificed themselves. The best-known version states that Tezzictecatl and Nanahuatzin immolated themselves, becoming the moon and the sun. However, other versions add a group of women to those who sacrificed themselves, including Coatlicue. Afterward, the Aztecs were said to have worshiped the skirts of these women, which came back to life. Coatlicue thus has creative aspects, which may balance the skulls, hearts, hands, and claws that connect her to the earth deity Tlaltecuhtli. The earth both consumes and regenerates life.

<text>In Aztec religion,  (, &quot;Painted with Bells&quot;) is a daughter of the goddess (&quot;Serpent Skirt&quot;). She was the leader of her brothers, the (&quot;Four Hundred Huītznāhua&quot;). She led her brothers in an attack against their mother, , when they learned she was pregnant, convinced she dishonored them all. The attack is thwarted by &#x27;s other brother, Huītzilōpōchtli, the national deity of the Mexica.

In 1978, workers at an electric company accidentally discovered a large stone relief depicting in Mexico City. The discovery of the stone led to large-scale excavation, directed by Eduardo Matos Moctezuma, to unearth the Huēyi Teōcalli (Templo Mayor in Spanish). The prominent position of the stone suggests the importance of her defeat by the Centzonhuītznāhua in Aztec religion and national identity.

== Birth of Huītzilōpōchtli and Coyolxāuhqui&#x27;s defeat at Coatepec ==
On the summit of Coatepec (&quot;Serpent Mountain&quot;) sat a shrine for Coatlicue, the maternal Earth deity. One day, as she swept her shrine, a ball of hummingbird feathers fell from the sky. She &quot;snatched them up; she placed them at her waist.&quot; Thus, she became pregnant with the deity Huītzilōpōchtli.

Her miraculous pregnancy embarrassed Coatlicue&#x27;s other children, including her eldest daughter, Coyolxāuhqui. Hearing of her pregnancy, the Centzonhuītznāhua, led by Coyolxāuhqui, decided to kill Coatlicue. As they prepared for battle and gathered at the base of Coatepec, one of the Centzonhuītznāhua, Quauitlicac, warned Huītzilōpōchtli of the attack while he was in utero. Hearing of the attack, the pregnant miraculously gave birth to a fully grown and armed Huītzilōpōchtli who sprang from her womb, wielding &quot;his shield, &quot;teueuelli&quot;, and his darts and his blue dart thrower, called &quot;xinatlatl&quot;.&quot;

Huītzilōpōchtli killed , beheading her and throwing her body down the side of Coatepec: &quot;He pierced Coyolxauhqui, and then quickly struck off her head. It stopped there at the edge of Coatepetl. And her body came falling below; it fell breaking to pieces; in various places her arms, her legs, her body each fell.&quot; As for his brothers, the Centzonhuītznāhua, he scattered them in all directions from the top of Coatepec. He pursued them relentlessly, and those who escaped went south.

Some authors have written that Huītzilōpōchtli tossed Coyolxāuhqui&#x27;s head into the sky, where it became the Moon, so that his mother would be comforted in seeing her daughter in the sky every night, and that her scattered brothers became the Southern Star deities. It is difficult to verify these variations of the narrative with 16th century sources.
=== Imagery in Poses ===
The Templo Mayor stone disk served as a cautionary sign to foes of Tenochtitlán. This is exemplified by the dismemberment of her body and its restraints. 

The display of Coyolxāuhqui&#x27;s severed head served this same purpose differently, as it was different than the typical full-body sculptures and art created by the Mexica. 

=== Identifying Elements ===
Gold ornaments adorn the face of Coyolxāuhqui in the form of earrings and bell pendants. The ear ornaments have trapeze-ray signs symbolic of the tail of Xiuhcoatl, the fire serpent. This makes them identifiers as they create a direct tie to Huītzilōpōchtli, who used Xiuhcoatl as his weapon.

On February 21, 1978, a group of workers for the Mexico City electric power company came across a large shield-shaped stone covered in reliefs while digging. The stone they uncovered depicts the narrative of Coyolxāuhqui&#x27;s defeat at Coatepec, shown at left. The discovery renewed the interest in excavating the ancient city of Tenochtitlán underneath Mexico City. This led to the excavation of the Huēyi Teōcalli (Templo Mayor), directed by Eduardo Matos Moctezuma.
This relief is one of the best known Aztec monuments and one of the few great Aztec monuments to have been found fully &quot;in situ&quot;.
=== Location ===
The Coyolxāuhqui stone sat at the base of the stairs of the Huēyi Teōcalli, the primary temple of the Mexica in Tenochtitlan, on the side dedicated to Huitzilopochtli. The stone laid in the center of a platform that extended from the foot of the stairway. The temple is dedicated to Huītzilōpōchtli and the rain deity Tlāloc. Scholars believe that Mexica artists and builders incorporated images of the Coatepec narrative into the Huēyi Teōcalli during a major renovation from the years 4 Reed to 8 Reed (1483–1487) under the rule of Ahuitzotl.

Eduardo Matos Moctezuma first noted that the monument&#x27;s placement at the bottom of the Templo Mayor commemorated the history of Huītzilōpōchtli defeating Coyolxāuhqui in the battle on Mount Coatepetel. Matos Moctezuma has argued that the section of the Huēyi Teōcalli dedicated to Huītzilōpōchtli represents the sacred mountain of Coatepec where Huītzilōpōchtli was born and Coyolxāuhqui died.

The Coyolxāuhqui stone was located in what was named Phase IV of the Templo Mayor during its excavation.

=== Creation ===

The artist of the Coyolxāuhqui stone carved this disk in high relief out of a single large stone, 3.25 meters in diameter. Aztec historian Richard Townsend describes it as one of Mesoamerican art&#x27;s most powerfully expressive sculptures, using &quot;an assurance of design and a technical virtuosity not previously seen at the pyramids.&quot;

The stone was likely created under the rule of Axayacatl (1469–1481). 

=== Imagery ===
On the disk, Coyolxāuhqui lies on her back, with her head, arms, and legs severed from her body. Her head faces upwards, away from her torso and in profile view, with her mouth open. Her dismembered torso lies flat on her back. Her breasts sag downward. Her body is neatly yet dynamically organized within the circular composition. Scallop-shaped carvings line the points of decapitation and dismemberment at her neck, shoulders, and hip joints. In this representation, Coyolxāuhqui is nearly naked, barring her serpent loincloth. She wears only the ritual attire of bells in her hair, a bell symbol on her cheek, and a feathered headdress. These objects identify her as Coyolxauhqui. She wears a skull tied to a belt of snakes around her waist and an ear tab showing the Mexica year sign. Snake, skull, and earth monster imagery surround her.

In the image to the right, which represents the original colors of the stone, Coyolxāuhqui&#x27;s yellow body lies before a red background. Bright blue colors her headdress and various details in the carving. White bones emerge from the scalloped, dismembered body parts.

The double-headed serpent, also known as Maquizcoatl, were negative omens that could indicate death. Associated with Huītzilōpōchtli, as it was one of his names, creates a tie between the siblings. Coyolxāuhqui&#x27;s joints being restrained by Maquizcoatl is both symbolic of her duty to serve a warning as well as identifying. 

=== Uses ===
The Coyolxāuhqui stone would have served as a cautionary sign to the enemies of Tenochtitlán. According to Aztec history, female deities such as Coyolxāuhqui were the first Aztec enemies to die in war. In this, Coyolxāuhqui came to represent all conquered enemies. Her violent death was a warning for the fate of those who crossed the Mexica people. Richard Townsend notes that the disk represented the defeat of the Aztecs&#x27; enemies. 

Sacrificial victims crossed this stone before walking up the stairs of the temple to the block in front of Huītzilōpōchtli&#x27;s shrine.

== Role in sacrifice ==
Scholars also believe that the decapitation and destruction of Coyolxāuhqui are reflected in the pattern of the warrior ritual sacrifice, particularly during the feast of Panquetzaliztli (Banner Raising). The feast takes place in the 15th month of the Aztec calendar and is dedicated to Huītzilōpōchtli. During the ceremony, captives’ hearts were cut out and their bodies were thrown down the temple stairs to the Coyolxāuhqui stone. There, they were decapitated and dismembered, just as Coyolxāuhqui was by Huītzilōpōchtli on Coatepec.

<text>Huitzilopochtli (, ) is the solar and war deity of sacrifice in Aztec religion. He was also the patron god of the Aztecs and their capital city, Tenochtitlan. He wielded Xiuhcoatl, the fire serpent, as a weapon, thus also associating Huitzilopochtli with fire.

The Spaniards recorded the deity&#x27;s name as &quot;Huichilobos&quot;. During their discovery and conquest of the Aztec Empire, they wrote that human sacrifice was common in worship ceremonies. These took place frequently throughout the region. When performed, typically multiple victims were sacrificed per day at any one of the numerous temples.

==Etymology==
There continues to be disagreement about the full significance of Huītzilōpōchtli&#x27;s name. Generally it is agreed that there are two elements, &quot;hummingbird&quot; and &quot;left hand side.&quot; The name is often translated as &quot;Left-Handed Hummingbird&quot; or &quot;Hummingbird of the South&quot; on the basis that Aztec cosmology associated the south with the left hand side of the body.

However, Frances Karttunen points out that in Classical Nahuatl compounds are usually head final, implying that a more accurate translation may be &quot;the left (or south) side of the hummingbird&quot;.

The hummingbird was spiritually important in Aztec culture. Diego Durán describes what appears to be the hummingbird hibernating in a tree, somewhat like the common poorwill does. He writes, &quot;It appears to be dead, but at the advent of spring, ... the little bird is reborn.&quot;

==Origin stories==

There are a handful of origin mythologies describing the deity&#x27;s beginnings. One story tells of the cosmic creation and Huitzilopochtli&#x27;s role in it. According to this legend, he was the smallest son of four — his parents being the creator couple of the Ōmeteōtl (Tōnacātēcuhtli and Tōnacācihuātl) while his brothers were Quetzalcōātl (&quot;Precious Serpent&quot; or &quot;Quetzal-Feathered Serpent&quot;), Xīpe Tōtec (&quot;Our Lord Flayed&quot;), and Tezcatlipōca (&quot;Smoking Mirror&quot;). His mother and father instructed him and Quetzalcoatl to bring order to the world. Together, Huitzilopochtli and Quetzalcoatl created fire, the first male and female humans, the Earth, and the Sun.

Another origin story tells of a fierce goddess, Coatlicue, being impregnated as she was sweeping by a ball of feathers on Mount Coatepec (&quot;Serpent Hill&quot;; near Tula, Hidalgo). Her other children, who were already fully grown, were the four hundred male Centzonuitznaua and the female deity Coyolxauhqui. These children, angered by the manner by which their mother became impregnated, conspired to kill her. Huitzilopochtli burst forth from his mother&#x27;s womb in full armor and fully grown, or in other versions of the story, burst forth from the womb and immediately put on his gear. He attacked his older brothers and sister, defending his mother by beheading his sister and casting her body from the mountain top. He also chased after his brothers, who fled from him and became scattered all over the sky.

Huitzilopochtli is seen as the sun in mythology, while his many male siblings are perceived as the stars and his sister as the moon. In the Aztec worldview, this is the reason why the Sun is constantly chasing the Moon and stars. It is also why it was so important to provide tribute for Huitzilopochtli as sustenance for the Sun. If Huitzilopochtli did not have enough strength to battle his siblings, they would destroy their mother and thus the world.

==History==

Huitzilopochtli was the patron god of the Mexica tribe. Originally, he was of little importance to the Nahuas, but after the rise of the Aztecs, Tlacaelel reformed their religion and put Huitzilopochtli at the same level as Quetzalcoatl, Tlaloc, and Tezcatlipoca, making him a solar god. Through this, Huitzilopochtli replaced Nanahuatzin, the solar god from the Nahua legend. Huitzilopochtli was said to be in a constant struggle with the darkness and required nourishment in the form of sacrifices to ensure the sun would survive the cycle of 52 years, which was the basis of many Mesoamerican myths.

There were 18 especially holy festive days, and only one of them was dedicated to Huitzilopochtli. This celebration day, known as Toxcatl, falls within the fifteenth month of the Mexican calendar. During the festival, captives and slaves were brought forth and slain ceremoniously.

In the book &quot;El Calendario Mexica y la Cronografia&quot; by Rafael Tena and published by the National Institute of Anthropology and History of Mexico, the author gives the last day of the Nahuatl month Panquetzaliztli as the date of the celebration of the rebirth of the Lord Huitzilopochtli on top of Coatepec (Snake Hill); December 9 in the Julian calendar or December 19 in the Gregorian calendar with the variant of December 18 in leap years.

=== Sacrifice ===

Ritual sacrifice and self bloodletting were key offerings to Huitzilopochtli. The Aztecs performed ritual self-sacrifice (also called autosacrifice or blood-letting) on a daily basis. The Aztecs believed that Huitzilopochtli needed daily nourishment (&quot;tlaxcaltiliztli&quot;) in the form of human blood and hearts and that they, as “people of the sun,” were required to provide Huitzilopochtli with his sustenance. 

When the Aztecs sacrificed people to Huitzilopochtli, the victim would be placed on a sacrificial stone. The priest would then cut through the abdomen with an obsidian or flint blade. The heart would be torn out still beating and held towards the sky in honor to the Sun-God. The body would then be pushed down the pyramid where the Coyolxauhqui stone could be found. The Coyolxauhqui Stone recreates the story of Coyolxauhqui, Huitzilopochtli&#x27;s sister who was dismembered at the base of a mountain, just as the sacrificial victims were. The body would be carried away and either cremated or given to the warrior responsible for the capture of the victim. He would either cut the body in pieces and send them to important people as an offering, or use the pieces for ritual cannibalism. The warrior would thus ascend one step in the hierarchy of the Aztec social classes, a system that rewarded successful warriors.

During the festival of Panquetzaliztli, of which Huitzilopochtli was the patron, sacrificial victims were adorned in the manner of Huitzilopochtli&#x27;s costume and blue body paint, before their hearts would be sacrificially removed. Representations of Huitzilopochtli called teixiptla were also worshipped, the most significant being the one at the Templo Mayor which was made of dough mixed with sacrificial blood.

Warriors who died in battle or as sacrifices to Huitzilopochtli were called &quot;quauhteca&quot; (“the eagle’s people”). War was an important source of both human and material tribute. Human tribute was used for sacrificial purposes because human blood was believed to be extremely important, and thus powerful. According to Aztec mythology, Huitzilopochtli needed blood as sustenance in order to continue to keep his sister and many brothers at bay as he chased them through the sky.

==The Templo Mayor==
The most important and powerful structure in Tenochtitlan is the Templo Mayor. Its importance as the sacred center is reflected in the fact that it was enlarged frontally eleven times during the two hundred years of its existence. The Great Temple of Tenochtitlan was dedicated to Huitzilopochtli and Tlaloc, the rain god. 16th century Dominican friar Diego Durán wrote, &quot;These two gods were always meant to be together, since they were considered companions of equal power.&quot; The Templo Mayor consisted of a pyramidal platform, on top of which were twin temples, one painted with blue stripes and the other painted red. The red shrine, on the south side, was dedicated to Huitzilopochtli, while the blue shrine to the north was dedicated to Tlaloc. That these two deities were on opposite sides of the Great Temple is very representative of the Aztec dichotomy that the deities represent. Tlaloc, as the rain god, represented fertility and growth, while Huitzilopochtli, as the sun god, represented war and sacrifice.

==The Coyolxauhqui stone==
The Coyolxauhqui stone was found directly at the base of the stairway leading up to Huitzilopochtli&#x27;s temple. On both sides of the stairway&#x27;s base were two large grinning serpent heads. The image is clear. The Templo Mayor is the image of Coatepec or Serpent Mountain where the divine battle took place. Just as Huitzilopochtli triumphed at the top of the mountain, while his sister was dismembered and fell to pieces below, so Huitzilopochtli&#x27;s temple and icon sat triumphantly at the top of the Templo Mayor while the carving of the dismembered goddess lay far below. This drama of sacrificial dismemberment was vividly repeated in some of the offerings found around the Coyolxauhqui stone in which the decapitated skulls of young women were placed. This would suggest that there was a ritual reenactment of the myth at the dedication of the stone sometime in the latter part of the fifteenth century.

==Mythology==
Many gods in the pantheon of deities of the Aztecs were inclined to have a fondness for a particular aspect of warfare. However, Huitzilopochtli was known as the primary god of war in ancient Mexico. Since he was the patron god of the Mexica, he was credited with both the victories and defeats that the Mexica people had on the battlefield. The people had to make sacrifices to him to protect the Aztec from infinite night.

According to Miguel León-Portilla, in this new vision from Tlacaelel, the warriors that died in battle and women who died in childbirth would go to serve Huitzilopochtli in his palace (in the south, or left). From a description in the &quot;Florentine Codex&quot;, Huitzilopochtli was so bright that the warrior souls had to use their shields to protect their eyes. They could only see the god through the arrow holes in their shields, so it was the bravest warrior who could see him best. Warriors and women who died during childbirth were transformed into hummingbirds upon death and went to join Huitzilopochtli.

As the precise studies of Johanna Broda have shown, the creation myth consisted of “several layers of symbolism, ranging from a purely historical explanation to one in terms of cosmovision and possible astronomical content.” At one level, Huitzilopochtli&#x27;s birth and victorious battle against the four hundred children represent the character of the solar region of the Aztecs in that the daily sunrise was viewed as a celestial battle against the moon (Coyolxauhqui) and the stars (Centzon Huitznahua). Another version of the myth, found in the historical chronicles of Diego Duran and Alvarado Tezozomoc, tells the story with strong historical allusion and portrays two Aztec factions in ferocious battle. The leader of one group, Huitzilopochtli, defeats the warriors of a woman leader, Coyolxauh, and tears open their breasts and eats their hearts. Both versions tell of the origin of human sacrifice at the sacred place, Coatepec, during the rise of the Aztec nation and at the foundation of Tenochtitlan.

=== Origins of Tenochtitlan ===

There are several legends and myths of Huitzilopochtli. According to the &quot;Aubin Codex&quot;, the Aztecs originally came from a place called Aztlán. They lived under the ruling of a powerful elite called the &quot;Azteca Chicomoztoca&quot;. Huitzilopochtli ordered them to abandon Aztlán and find a new home. He also ordered them never to call themselves Aztec; instead they should be called &quot;Mexica.&quot; Huitzilopochtli guided them through the journey. For a time, Huitzilopochtli left them in the charge of his sister, Malinalxochitl, who, according to legend, founded Malinalco, but the Aztecs resented her ruling and called back Huitzilopochtli. He put his sister to sleep and ordered the Aztecs to leave the place. When she woke up and realized she was alone, she became angry and desired revenge. She gave birth to a son called Copil. When he grew up, he confronted Huitzilopochtli, who had to kill him. Huitzilopochtli then took his heart out and threw it in the middle of Lake Texcoco. Many years later, Huitzilopochtli ordered the Aztecs to search for Copil&#x27;s heart and build their city over it. The sign would be an eagle perched on a cactus, eating a precious serpent, and the place would become their permanent home. After much traveling, they arrived at the area which would eventually be Tenochtitlan on an island in the Lago Texcoco of the Valley of Mexico.

==Iconography==
In art and iconography, Huitzilopochtli could be represented either as a hummingbird or as an anthropomorphic figure with just the feathers of such on his head and left leg, a black face, and holding a scepter shaped like a snake and a mirror. According to the Florentine Codex, Huitzilopochtli&#x27;s body was painted blue. In the great temple his statue was decorated with cloth, feathers, gold, and jewels, and was hidden behind a curtain to give it more reverence and veneration. Another variation lists him having a face that was marked with yellow and blue stripes and he carries around the fire serpent Xiuhcoatl with him. According to legend, the statue was supposed to be destroyed by the soldier Gil González de Benavides, but it was rescued by a man called Tlatolatl. The statue appeared some years later during an investigation by Bishop Zummáraga in the 1530s, only to be lost again. There is speculation that the statue still exists in a cave somewhere in the Anahuac Valley.

He always had a blue-green hummingbird helmet in any of the depictions found. In fact, his hummingbird helmet was the one item that consistently defined him as Huitzilopochtli, the sun god, in artistic renderings. He is usually depicted as holding a shield adorned with balls of eagle feathers, a homage to his mother and the story of his birth. He also holds the blue snake, Xiuhcoatl, in his hand in the form of an atlatl.

==Calendar==
Diego Durán described the festivities for Huitzilopochtli. Panquetzaliztli (November 9 to November 28) was the Aztec month dedicated to Huitzilopochtli. People decorated their homes and trees with paper flags; there were ritual races, processions, dances, songs, prayers, and finally human sacrifices. This was one of the more important Aztec festivals, and the people prepared for the whole month. They fasted or ate very little; a statue of the god was made with amaranth &quot;(huautli)&quot; seeds and honey, and at the end of the month, it was cut into small pieces so everybody could eat a little piece of the god. After the Spanish conquest, cultivation of amaranth was outlawed, while some of the festivities were subsumed into the Christmas celebration.

According to the &quot;Ramírez Codex&quot;, in Tenochtitlan approximately sixty prisoners were sacrificed at the festivities. Sacrifices were reported to be made in other Aztec cities, including Tlatelolco, Xochimilco, and Texcoco, but the number is unknown, and no currently available archeological findings confirm this.

For the reconsecration of Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in 1487, dedicated to Tlaloc and Huitzilopochtli, the Aztecs reported that they sacrificed about 20,400 prisoners over the course of four days. While accepted by some scholars, this claim also has been considered Aztec propaganda. There were 19 altars in the city of Tenochtitlan.

<text>Tlāhuizcalpantēcuhtli is a principal member of the pantheon of gods within the Aztec religion, representing the Morning Star Venus. The name comes from the Nahuatl words &quot;dawn&quot; and &quot;lord&quot;. Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli is one of the thirteen Lords of the Day, representing the 12th day of the Aztec trecena.

==Origin Story==
Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli plays a significant role in the creation of Tonatiuh, the Fifth Sun in the Aztec creation narrative.

Motolinía&#x27;s &quot;Memoriales&quot;, and the Codex Chimalpopoca relate that the Toltec ruler Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl became the morning star when he died. Quetzalcoatl throws himself into a bonfire after adorning his regalia. Once he started burning, his ashes were lifted and various beautiful birds were sacrificed until Quetzalcoatl&#x27;s spirit leaves his heart as a star and becomes a part of the sky.

The &quot;Annals of Cuauhtitlan&quot; gives his year of death as 1 Reed, one 52-year calendar cycle from his birth.

In the second section of the Codex Chimalpopoca (called &quot;Legend of the Suns)&quot;, Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli becomes angry when Tonatiuh, the sun god, does not move across the sky after being created. He shoots Tonatiuh with &quot;atlatl&quot; darts, but misses and is hit by Tonatiuh&#x27;s darts, being transformed into the god of obsidian and coldness, Itztlacoliuhqui. The rest of the gods present: Tezcatlipoca, Huitzilopochtli, Nochpalliicue, Yapallicue and Xochiquetzal sacrifice themselves in Teotihuacan to make the Sun move across the sky, starting the contemporary era.

Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli is also viewed as one of the four gods who kept the sky up and was associated with the cardinal direction East.

==Effects==
Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli is believed to cause harm to people by shooting darts. According to the &quot;Annals of Cuauhtitlan&quot;, after Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl died, he spent four days in Mictlan making darts before emerging as the morning star.

The &quot;Annals&quot; list his victims according to the days of the Aztec calendar: old people on 1 Alligator; small children on 1 Jaguar, 1 Deer and 1 Flower; nobles on 1 Reed; everybody on 1 Death; and young people on 1 Movement. On 1 Rain, he shoots the rain, so that no rain falls, and on 1 Water, he causes drought. 

==Calendar==
Along with being the Lord of the 12th day, in the sacred Aztec calendar called the &quot;Tōnalpōhualli&quot; Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli is patron of the &quot;trecena&quot; beginning with the day 1 Snake and ending with 13 Movement. In this he is paired with Xiuhtecuhtli, the god of fire.

<text>Mictlāntēcutli or Mictlantecuhtli (, meaning &quot;Lord of Mictlan&quot;), in Aztec mythology, is a god of the dead and the king of Mictlan (Chicunauhmictlan), the lowest and northernmost section of the underworld. He is one of the principal gods of the Aztecs and is the most prominent of several gods and goddesses of death and the underworld. The worship of Mictlantecuhtli sometimes involved ritual cannibalism, with human flesh being consumed in and around the temple. Other names given to Mictlantecuhtli include Ixpuztec (“Broken Face”), Nextepehua (“Scatterer of Ashes”), and Tzontemoc (“He Who Lowers His Head”).

Two life-size clay statues of Mictlantecuhtli were found marking the entrances to the House of Eagles to the north of the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan.

==Attributes==
Mictlantecuhtli was considered tall and was depicted as a blood-spattered skeleton or a person wearing a toothy skull. Although his head was typically a skull, his eye sockets did contain eyeballs. His headdress was shown decorated with owl feathers and paper banners and he wore a necklace of human eyeballs, while his earspools were made from human bones.

He was not the only Aztec god to be depicted in this fashion, as numerous other deities had skulls for heads or else wore clothing or decorations that incorporated bones and skulls. In the Aztec world, skeletal imagery was a symbol of fertility, health and abundance, alluding to the close symbolic links between life and death. He was often depicted wearing sandals as a symbol of his high rank as Lord of Mictlan. His arms were frequently depicted raised in an aggressive gesture, showing that he was ready to tear apart the dead as they entered his presence. In the Aztec codices, Mictlantecuhtli is often depicted with his skeletal jaw open to receive the stars that descend into him during the daytime.

His wife was Mictecacihuatl, and together they were said to dwell in a windowless house in Mictlan. Mictlantecuhtli was associated with spiders, owls, bats, the 11th hour, and the northern compass direction, known as Mictlampa, the region of death. He was one of only a few deities held to govern over all three types of souls identified by the Aztecs, who distinguished between the souls of people who died normal deaths (of old age, disease, etc.), heroic deaths (e.g. in battle, sacrifice or during childbirth), or non-heroic deaths. Mictlantecuhtli and his wife were the opposites and complements of Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl, the givers of life.

Mictlantecuhtli was the god of the day sign &quot;Itzcuintli&quot; (dog), one of the 20 such signs recognised in the Aztec calendar, and was regarded as supplying the souls of those who were born on that day. He was seen as the source of souls for those born on the sixth day of the 13-day week and was the fifth of the nine Night Gods of the Aztecs. He was also the secondary Week God for the 10th week of the 20-week cycle of the calendar, joining the sun god Tonatiuh to symbolise the dichotomy of light and darkness.

In the Colonial Codex Vaticanus 3738, Mictlantecuhtli is labelled in Spanish as &quot;the lord of the underworld, Tzitzimitl. 

==Myths==

In Aztec mythology, after Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca created the world, they put their creation in order and placed Mictlantecuhtli and his wife, Mictecacihuatl, in the underworld.

According to Aztec legend, the twin gods Quetzalcoatl and Xolotl were sent by the other gods to steal the bones of the previous generation of gods from Mictlantecuhtli. The god of the underworld sought to block Quetzalcoatl&#x27;s escape with the bones and, although he failed, he forced Quetzalcoatl to drop the bones, which were scattered and broken by the fall. The shattered bones were collected by Quetzalcoatl and carried back to the land of the living, where the gods transformed them into the various races of mortals.

When a person died, they were interred with grave goods, which they carried with them on the long and dangerous journey to the underworld. Upon arrival in Mictlan these goods were offered to Mictlantecuhtli and his wife.

In another myth, the shrewd god of death agrees to give the bones to Quetzalcóatl if he can completely finish what would appear to be a simple test. The god informs Quetzalcóatl that he has to travel through his kingdom four times, while a shell sounds out like a trumpet. However, in place of giving Quetzalcóatl the shell from Mictlantecuhtl he gives him a normal shell, without holes in it. In order to not be mocked, Quetzalcóatl beckons the worms to come out and perforate the shell, thus creating holes. He then calls the bees to enter the shell and to make it sound out like a trumpet. (As an emblem of his power over wind and life, Quetzalcóatl is commonly depicted wearing a cut shell over his chest, this shell represents the same shell that Ehécatl, the god of the wind, wears).

Whilst listening to the roar of the trumpet, Mictlantecuhtl, at first, decides to allow Quetzalcóatl to take all of the bones from the last creation, but then quickly changes his mind. Nevertheless, Quetzalcóatl is more astute than Mictlantecuhtl and his minions and escapes with the bones. Mictlantecuhtli, now very angry, orders his followers to create a very deep pit. While Quetzalcóatl is running away with the bones he is startled by a quail, which causes him to fall into the pit. He falls into the pit and dies (or so it would appear), and is subsequently tormented by the animal (the quail), and the bones he is carrying are scattered. The quail then begins to gnaw on the bones.

Despite the fall, Quetzalcóatl is eventually revived and gathers all of the broken bones. It is for this reason that people today come in all different sizes. Once he has escaped from the underworld, Quetzalcóatl carries the precious cargo to Tamoanchan, a place of miraculous origin.

== In popular culture ==
Mictlantecuhtli has appeared in the animated movie of La leyenda de las Momias by Anima Estudios. In the movie the deity is responsible for bringing the dead back to life in the city of Guanajuato.

He also appeared towards the end of the short film &quot;God of Death&quot;, the second segment in the 2023 horror anthology film V/H/S/85. In the segment, a Mexican news station faces an earthquake, and while evacuating survivors from the wreckage, find an underground temple to Mictlantecuhtli, who rises and possesses or kills most of the main characters in the short.

<text>Mictēcacihuātl (, meaning &quot;Lady of the Dead&quot;), in Aztec mythology, is a death deity and consort of Mictlāntēcutli, god of the dead and ruler of Mictlān, the lowest level of the underworld.

Her role is to watch over the bones of the dead and preside over the ancient festivals of the dead. These festivals evolved from Aztec traditions into the modern Day of the Dead after synthesis with Spanish traditions. She now presides over the contemporary festival as well. She is known as the &quot;Lady of the Dead&quot;, since it is believed that she was born, then sacrificed as an infant. Mictēcacihuātl was represented with a flayed body and with jaw agape to swallow the stars during the day.

His name contains the Nahuatl words (&quot;flower&quot;) and (either &quot;prince&quot; or &quot;child&quot;) and hence means &quot;flower prince&quot;.

==Associations==
As the patron of writing and painting, he was called &#x27; the &quot;Seven-flower&quot;, but he could also be referred to as &#x27; &quot;Five-flower&quot;. He was the patron of the game patolli. He is frequently paired with Xochiquetzal, who is seen as his female counterpart. has also been interpreted as the patron of both homosexuals and male prostitutes, a role possibly resulting from his being absorbed from the Toltec civilization.

He, among other gods, is depicted wearing a talisman known as an , which was a teardrop-shaped pendant crafted out of mother-of-pearl.

In the mid-19th century, a 16th-century Aztec statue of Xochipilli was unearthed on the side of the volcano Popocatépetl near Tlalmanalco. The statue is of a single figure seated upon a temple-like base. Both the statue and the base upon which it sits are covered in carvings of sacred and psychoactive organisms including mushrooms (&quot;Psilocybe aztecorum&quot;), tobacco (&quot;Nicotiana tabacum&quot;), &quot;Ololiúqui&quot; (&quot;Turbina corymbosa&quot;), &quot;sinicuichi&quot; (&quot;Heimia salicifolia&quot;), possibly &quot;cacahuaxochitl&quot; (&quot;Quararibea funebris&quot;), and one unidentified flower.

Laurette Séjourné has written: &quot;The texts always use the flower in an entirely spiritual sense, and the aim of the religious colleges was to cause the flower of the body to bloom: This flower can be no other than the soul. The association of the flower with the sun is also evident. One of the hieroglyphs for the sun is a four-petalled flower, and the feasts of the ninth month, dedicated to Huitzilopochtli, were entirely given over to flower offerings.&quot;

The figure himself sits on the base, head tilted up, eyes open, jaw tensed, with his mouth half open and his arms opened to the heavens. The statue is currently housed in the Aztec hall of the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City.

===Entheogen connection===
It has been suggested by Wasson, Schultes, and Hofmann that the statue of Xochipilli represents a figure in the throes of entheogenic ecstasy. The position and expression of the body, in combination with the very clear representations of hallucinogenic plants which are known to have been used in sacred contexts by the Aztec support this interpretation. The statue appears to have hugely dilated pupils, suggesting an effect of hallucinogenic mushrooms.

Wasson says that in the statue&#x27;s depiction Xochipilli &quot;is absorbed by &quot;temicxoch&quot;, &#x27;dream flowers&#x27;, as the Nahua say describing the awesome experience that follows the ingestion of an entheogen. I can think of nothing like it in the long and rich history of European art: Xochipilli absorbed in &quot;temicxoch&quot;&quot;.

<text>John Herbert Varley (born August 9, 1947) is an American science fiction writer.

==Biography==
Varley was born in Austin, Texas. He grew up in Fort Worth, moved to Port Arthur in 1957, graduated from Nederland High School—all in Texas—and went to Michigan State University on a National Merit Scholarship. He started as a physics major, switched to English, then left school before his 20th birthday and arrived in Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco just in time for the &quot;Summer of Love&quot; in 1967. There he worked at various unskilled jobs, depended on St. Anthony&#x27;s Mission for meals, and panhandled outside the Cala Market on Stanyan Street (since closed) before deciding that writing had to be a better way to make a living. He was serendipitously present at Woodstock in 1969 when his car ran out of gas a half-mile away. He also has lived at various times in Portland and Eugene, Oregon, New York City, San Francisco again, Berkeley, and Los Angeles.

Varley has written several novels (his first attempt, &quot;Gas Giant&quot;, was, he admits, &quot;pretty bad&quot;) and numerous short stories, many of them in a future history, &quot;The Eight Worlds&quot;. These stories are set a century or two after a race of mysterious and omnipotent aliens, the Invaders, have almost completely eradicated humans from the Earth (they regard whales and dolphins to be the superior Terran lifeforms and humans only a dangerous infestation). But humans have inhabited virtually every other corner of the solar system, often through the use of biological modifications learned, in part, by eavesdropping on alien communications.

Varley&#x27;s &quot;Overdrawn at the Memory Bank&quot; was adapted and televised for PBS in 1983. In addition, two of his short stories (&quot;Options&quot; and &quot;Blue Champagne&quot;) were adapted into episodes of the short-lived 1998 Sci-Fi Channel TV series &quot;Welcome to Paradox&quot;.

Varley spent some years in Hollywood but the only tangible result of this stint was the film &quot;Millennium&quot;. Of his &quot;Millennium&quot; experience Varley said:

Varley is often compared to Robert A. Heinlein. In addition to a similarly descriptive writing style, similarities include a libertarian political perspective and advocacy of free love. Two of his connected novels, &quot;Steel Beach&quot; and &quot;The Golden Globe&quot;, include a sub-society of Heinleiners. &quot;The Golden Globe&quot; also contains a society evolved from a prison colony on Pluto and a second society evolved from it on Pluto&#x27;s moon, Charon, similar to the situation found in Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;. Unlike Heinlein&#x27;s lunar society, Varley&#x27;s convict society on Charon maintains its criminal ways and is similar to the Mafia or the &quot;yakuza&quot;. His &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot; series plays on his connection with Heinlein by deriving its main characters&#x27; names from many of Heinlein&#x27;s characters, including Jubal, Manuel Garcia, Kelly, Podkayne, Cassie, and Polly, and by frequently dropping titles of Heinlein&#x27;s novels in the dialogue.

In 2021, Varley announced a series of health problems including a quadruple bypass, COVID-19, and bacterial pneumonia. Colleagues organized a crowdfunding campaign to pay his expenses while he was unable to write. At that time he described himself as living near Vancouver, Washington.

<text>Lost Dogs are an American musical supergroup formed in 1991, comprising vocalists, songwriters, and guitarists from multiple Christian alternative rock bands. Their current lineup includes Terry Scott Taylor (Daniel Amos, The Swirling Eddies), Michael Roe (The 77s), Derri Daugherty and Steve Hindalong (The Choir). The original lineup included Gene Eugene (Adam Again), who died in 2000. The band&#x27;s eclectic blending of folk, blues, country, and rock has been characterized as &quot;a sort of CCM equivalent to the Traveling Wilburys&quot;. The band released their debut album &quot;Scenic Routes&quot; in 1992 as a one-time collaboration.

Lost Dogs concert performances are filled with between-song jokes and one-liners between the band members (usually poking fun at each other). Many Lost Dogs albums include at least one or two cover songs. Songs covered by Lost Dogs on an album or in concert include Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Lord Protect My Child&quot;, Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;If It Be Your Will&quot;, The Beatles&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m A Loser&quot;, &quot;The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don&#x27;t Be Late)&quot;, and Stephen Foster&#x27;s &quot;Hard Times, Come Again No More&quot;.

In March 2000, shortly after the release of their &quot;Gift Horse&quot; album, Gene Eugene died.

In 2004, the band got together with Steve Hindalong to produce a special album for their summer tour. The result was entitled &quot;Mutt&quot;, and included new acoustic versions of ten songs originally written and recorded for each band member&#x27;s regular rock bands. The following year, the band would release the almost entirely instrumental &quot;Island Dreams&quot;. &quot;The Lost Cabin and the Mystery Trees&quot; was released July 2006. 

In 2008, the Lost Dogs traveled down historic Route 66 with cinematographer Jimmy Abegg. Abegg filmed the band&#x27;s experiences. The band then wrote and recorded 14 songs inspired by their journey, which was released as Old Angel in May 2010.

<text>The 77s (alternatively spelled the Seventy Sevens, the 77&#x27;s, or simply 77&#x27;s) is an American rock band consisting of Michael Roe on vocals/guitar, Mark Harmon on bass guitar, and Bruce Spencer on drums.

==History==
The group was &quot;formed at a church by a church&quot; under the name Scratch Band in Sacramento, California, during the late 1970s according to Mike Roe. Accompanying him were Mark Tootle on guitar and keyboards, Jan Eric Volz on bass guitar, and Mark Proctor on drums. They were occasionally joined by singer Sharon McCall and guitarist Jimmy A. Their repertoire included originals and songs by English poet Steve Scott among others. The &quot;church&quot; that brought the players together was Sacramento&#x27;s Warehouse Christian Ministries with the band being a part of the ministries artistic outreach, performing every weekend at the Warehouse. The name of the band was changed to the Seventy Sevens before the release of their first album, &quot;Ping Pong Over the Abyss&quot; in 1982, on WCM’s own Exit label. While the meaning of the group&#x27;s name has never been revealed, it is thought to be derived from either Matt 18:22, Daniel 9 or, simply, a year – possibly 1977 – which holds some significance to the band. In 1984, the group toured with labelmate Vector and Resurrection Band with all three bands playing the very first Cornerstone festival.

When Proctor left the band, he was replaced by Aaron Smith, who appeared on the album &quot;All Fall Down&quot; (1984) and remained with the band until 1995. Smith had been a former sideman with Ray Charles and the Temptations and a member of Vector. The next album, &quot;The Seventy Sevens&quot;, was released by Island Records in 1987. While the album received favorable reviews, it did not sell as well as it might; the reason being &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; by labelmate U2 was released that same year. In his article on the subject, John Thompson (True Tunes) thought it likely that Island put most of its resources into promoting &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; while others on the label received less promotional support. The album received a positive review by Rolling Stone critic, Margot Mifflin: &quot;the 77s have come up with a sound that suggests not only that they know where they’re coming from, but also that they&#x27;re going places&quot;. Mark Alan Powell called it &quot;an artistic masterpiece – probably one of the ten best albums of the year not simply in the Christian market but in rock and roll, period&quot;. 

A compilation album – &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; (1990) and a live album – &quot;88&quot; (1991) (which contained a manic version of &quot;Over, Under, Sideways, Down&quot;) were released after their eponymous Island Records release. At some point in 1992 Tootle and Volz left the band which left Roe as the only original member. David Leonhardt (guitar) joined in early 1992 with Mark Harmon (bass) joining that year also, replacing Tootle and Volz.

&quot;Pray Naked&quot; was released in 1992 but the title was changed by the label, Word Records, to &quot;The Seventy Sevens&quot;. The album title change would cause confusion in the minds of consumers and marketers since the 1987 album on Island bore the same name. This was followed by &quot;Drowning with Land in Sight&quot; in 1994. Leonhardt and Smith left the band soon after, with Smith being replaced by former bandmate Bruce Spencer of Vector. This change brought about a new version of the band, namely a power trio line up with Harmon, Roe and Spencer which started referring to itself as &quot;the band that won&#x27;t go away&quot;. It also brought the release of &quot;Tom Tom Blues&quot; (1995). 

At the end of the 1996, the 77s started the label &quot;Fools of the World&quot; and reissued some of its albums. New material was also released following the label&#x27;s formation: &quot;Echos o&#x27; Faith&quot; (1996 live acoustic material), &quot;EP&quot; (1999) and &quot;A Golden Field of Radioactive Crows&quot; (2001). Also, Scott Reams occasionally played in the band during concerts beginning in 2000.
In 2010, the 77&#x27;s participated in the tribute album &quot;Mister Bolin&#x27;s Late Night Revival&quot;, a compilation of 17 unreleased tracks written by Tommy Bolin.

Critically, the 77s are considered by fans and music critics; such as Dwight Ozzard (&quot;Prism&quot; magazine), Brian Quincy Newcomb (&quot;HM&quot;) and John Thompson (&quot;True Tunes&quot;), as the greatest—or &quot;best&quot; depending on whom one might quote, rock and roll band in the world.

===Promotional singles===
==7&amp;7iS==

Members of the 77s have used the moniker 7&amp;7is to release projects that they do not see as fitting under their regular band name. The name comes from &quot;7 and 7 Is&quot;, a song by the 60s music group Love.

The name was first used for Alternative Records&#x27; 1989 collection of rarities and outtakes (later released as &quot;More Miserable Than You&#x27;ll Ever Be&quot;). The name was revived in 2004 for &quot;Fun with Sound&quot;, a collaboration between lead singer Michael Roe and bassist Mark Harmon. Harmon and Roe also toured that year under the name. In 2014 a special wooden box set was released that contained a vinyl 7-inch single pressing of &quot;Hey Little Girl&quot; &amp; &quot;I Saw the Light&quot;, a T-shirt, two guitar picks, two buttons, and three CD versions of &quot;More Miserable Than You&#x27;ll Ever Be&quot; including a limited two-CD version, and two special collector versions under the title &quot;Misery Loves Company&quot;. Both collector versions include different tracks.

<text>John Franklin Candy (October 31, 1950 – March 4, 1994) was a Canadian actor and comedian who is best known for his work in Hollywood films. Candy first rose to national prominence in the 1970s as a member of the Toronto branch of the Second City and its SCTV sketch comedy series. He rose to international fame in the 1980s with his roles in comedy films such as &quot;Stripes&quot; (1981), &quot;Splash&quot; (1984), &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot; (1985), &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot; (1986), &quot;Spaceballs&quot; (1987), &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot; (1987), &quot;The Great Outdoors&quot; (1988), &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; (1989), and &quot;Cool Runnings&quot; (1993). He also appeared in supporting roles in &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (1983), &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (1986), &quot;Home Alone&quot; (1990), &quot;JFK&quot; (1991), and &quot;Nothing but Trouble&quot; (1991).

In addition to his work as an actor, Candy was a co-owner of the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL), and the team won the 1991 Grey Cup under his ownership. He died in 1994 at the age of 43. His final two film appearances, &quot;Wagons East&quot; (1994) and &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; (1995), are dedicated to his memory.

== Early life and education ==
John Franklin Candy was born on October 31, 1950, in Newmarket, and grew up in Toronto, Ontario. He was brought up in a working-class Catholic family. His childhood home was at 217 Woodville Avenue in East York, Ontario. According to the 1921 Canadian census records Candy&#x27;s father Sidney James (1920–1955) was born to English parents who immigrated to Canada in 1913. John Candy&#x27;s mother, Evangeline Valeria (née Aker; 1916–2009) was of Polish descent. His father died of complications of heart disease at age 35 in 1955 when John was four years old.

Candy attended Neil McNeil Catholic High School where he was the treasurer of the student council and was a star offensive tackle on the school&#x27;s football team and participated in drama club. Long before considering acting, Candy dreamed of becoming a professional football player, but a knee injury during his high school football career prevented him from fulfilling his dream. He later enrolled in Centennial College to study journalism, and then went to McMaster University. He started acting while at college.

==Career==
===1971–1978: Early career and &quot;SCTV&quot; ===
In 1971, Candy was cast in a small part as a Shriner in &quot;Creeps&quot; by David E. Freeman, a new Canadian play about cerebral palsy, in the inaugural season of the Tarragon Theatre in Toronto. Candy guest-starred on a Canadian children&#x27;s television series, &quot;Cucumber&quot;, and made a brief, uncredited appearance in &quot;Class of &#x27;44&quot; (1973) as his first ever appearance in a feature film. He had a small part in &quot;The ABC Afternoon Playbreak&quot; (&quot;Last Bride of Salem&quot;) and had a regular role on the TV series &quot;Dr. Zonk and the Zunkins&quot; (1974–75).

Candy became a member of Toronto&#x27;s branch of The Second City in 1972. He gained wide North American popularity when he became a cast member on the influential Edmonton and later Toronto-based comedy-variety show &quot;Second City Television&quot; (&quot;SCTV&quot;). NBC picked the show up in 1981 and quickly became a fan favorite. It won Emmy Awards for the show&#x27;s writing in 1981 and 1982. Among Candy&#x27;s &quot;SCTV&quot; characters were unscrupulous street-beat TV personality Johnny LaRue, 3-D horror auteur Doctor Tongue, sycophantic and easily amused talk-show sidekick William B. Williams, and Melonville&#x27;s corrupt Mayor Tommy Shanks.

In 1975 he played Richie, an accused killer, in the episode &quot;Web of Guilt&quot; on the Canadian TV show &quot;Police Surgeon&quot;. He was in &quot;It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time&quot; (1975), shot in Canada, as well as the children&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Coming Up Rosie&quot; (1975–78) with Dan Aykroyd. Candy had a small role in &quot;Tunnel Vision&quot; (1976).

During the series&#x27; run he appeared in films such as &quot;The Clown Murders&quot; (1976) and had a lead in a low-budget comedy, &quot;Find the Lady&quot; (1976) (both co-starring fellow Canadian actor Lawrence Dane). In 1976, Candy played a supporting role (with Rick Moranis) on Peter Gzowski&#x27;s short-lived late-night television talk show &quot;90 Minutes Live&quot;. In 1978, Candy had a small role as a bank employee (with Christopher Plummer and Elliott Gould) in the Canadian thriller &quot;The Silent Partner&quot;. He guest starred on such shows as &quot;The David Steinberg Show&quot; and &quot;King of Kensington&quot;.

===1979–1987: Hollywood breakthrough ===
In 1979, Candy took a brief hiatus from &quot;SCTV&quot; and began a more active film career, appearing in a minor role in &quot;Lost and Found&quot; (1979) and playing a U.S. Army soldier in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s big-budget comedy &quot;1941&quot;. He returned to Canada for roles in &quot;The Courage of Kavik, the Wolf Dog&quot; (1980) and the action thriller &quot;Double Negative&quot; (1980). He had a supporting role as easygoing parole officer Burton Mercer in &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980), starring Aykroyd, and did an episode of &quot;Tales of the Klondike&quot; (1981) for Canadian TV.

In 1980, Candy hosted a short-lived NBC television program, &quot;Roadshow&quot;, described by The Washington Post as &quot;improvisational journalism&quot;. Appearing as himself, Candy and a video crew traveled in a tour bus to Baton Rouge, Louisiana (home of Louisiana State University), and Carbondale, Illinois (home of Southern Illinois University Carbondale), and interviewed college students amid party atmospheres such as the latter&#x27;s Halloween street celebration. He also obtained backstage access to interview Midge Ure, the lead singer of the UK electronic band Ultravox, which performed a concert on the SIU campus the evening of 10/31/80. It is unknown if more than two episodes aired.

Candy played the lovable, mild-mannered Army recruit Dewey Oxberger in &quot;Stripes&quot; (1981), directed by Canadian Ivan Reitman, which was one of the most successful films of the year. He provided voices for multiple characters in the animated film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; (1981), most notably as the title character in the &quot;Den&quot; segment, which was well-received, including by the character&#x27;s creator, Richard Corben, who singled out Candy&#x27;s humorously lighthearted interpretation of the title character as excellent.

From 1981 to 1983, Candy appeared in &quot;SCTV Network&quot; on television. He made a cameo appearance in Harold Ramis&#x27; &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (1983), his first collaboration with John Hughes, who wrote the script. Candy appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; twice (hosting in 1983) while still appearing on &quot;SCTV&quot;. According to writer-comedian Bob Odenkirk, Candy was reputedly the &quot;most-burned potential host&quot; of &quot;SNL&quot;, in that he was asked to host many times, only for plans to be changed by the &quot;SNL&quot; staff at the last minute. Candy headlined in the Canadian film &quot;Going Berserk&quot; (1983). He was approached to play the character of accountant Louis Tully in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984), starring Aykroyd and directed by Reitman, but ultimately did not get the role because of his conflicting ideas of how to play the character; the part went instead to SCTV colleague Rick Moranis, whose ideas were better received. However, Candy did make a contribution to the franchise, as one of the many people chanting &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; in the video for Ray Parker Jr.&#x27;s hit single for the film.

Candy played Tom Hanks&#x27;s womanizing brother in the hit romantic comedy&quot; Splash&quot;, generally considered his break-out role. After the success of the film, he had signed a three-picture development and producing deal with Walt Disney Pictures, and he would develop and executive produce various theatricals as planned starring vehicles for himself.

Candy went back to Canada to star in &quot;The Last Polka&quot; (1985), which he also wrote with co-star Eugene Levy. He was Richard Pryor&#x27;s best friend in &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot; (1985) and had a cameo in the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; film &quot;Follow That Bird&quot; (1985). Candy&#x27;s first lead role in a Hollywood film came with &quot;Summer Rental&quot; (1985), directed by Carl Reiner. He was reunited with Hanks in &quot;Volunteers&quot; (1985), though the film did not do as well as &quot;Splash&quot;. He had a cameo in &quot;The Canadian Conspiracy&quot; (1985) and appeared alongside Martin Short in &quot;Dave Thomas: The Incredible Time Travels of Henry Osgood&quot; (1985) in Canada. Candy&#x27;s next starring role in a Hollywood film was the box office disappointment &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot; (1986) with Levy and Meg Ryan. He had a cameo in &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (1986) and appeared in &quot;Really Weird Tales&quot; (1987). He also had a supporting role in Mel Brooks&#x27;s &quot;Spaceballs&quot; (1987).

===1987–1995: John Hughes films and final roles ===

In 1987, Candy co-starred in &quot;Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles&quot; with Steve Martin, written and directed by John Hughes. The film had positive reviews. The film grossed $49,530,280 at the US box office. He appeared in a cameo role in Hughes&#x27;s &quot;She&#x27;s Having a Baby&quot; (1988) and then starred in a film written by Hughes, &quot;The Great Outdoors&quot; (1988) which co-starred Aykroyd.

Candy provided the voice for Don the Horse in &quot;Hot to Trot&quot; (1988) and starred in a flop comedy, considered by some to be a cult classic, &quot;Who&#x27;s Harry Crumb?&quot; (1989), which he also produced. He was also in the box office flop &quot;Speed Zone&quot; aka &quot;Cannonball Fever&quot; (1989), however, he had another hit film with Hughes as writer and director in &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; (1989). Candy also produced and starred in a Saturday-morning animated series on NBC titled &quot;Camp Candy&quot; in 1989. The show was set in a fictional summer camp run by Candy, featured his two children in supporting roles, and also spawned a brief comic book series published by Marvel Comics&#x27; Star Comics imprint. During this time, he also made the television film &quot;The Rocket Boy&quot; (1989) in Canada.

Candy also provided the voice of Wilbur the Albatross in Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; (1990) and had a cameo in two more films written by Hughes, the blockbuster hit film &quot;Home Alone&quot; (1990) and the box office flop &quot;Career Opportunities&quot; (1991). According to Candy&#x27;s biography, he was in talks to play Bette Midler&#x27;s working-class husband in the 1990 film &quot;Stella&quot;. However, when he was informed that Midler demanded he do a screen test, Candy became incredulous proclaiming &quot;Who the (expletive) does she think she is?!&quot; and declined. John Goodman was eventually cast in the role. From 1988 to 1990, Candy hosted &quot;Radio Kandy,&quot; a hot adult contemporary radio music countdown syndicated by Premiere Networks.

In 1991, Chris Columbus wrote and directed &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; with John Hughes serving as co-producer, and starring Candy and Maureen O&#x27;Hara; it was well reviewed but not a big hit. Candy also had a supporting role in &quot;Nothing But Trouble&quot; (1991), Dan Aykroyd&#x27;s notorious box office flop. Also unsuccessful were the comedies &quot;Delirious&quot; (1991) and &quot;Once Upon a Crime...&quot; (1992). During this time, Candy played a small dramatic role as Dean Andrews Jr., a shady Southern lawyer in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;JFK&quot; (1991), and had a cameo in the television film &quot;Boris and Natasha: The Movie&quot; (1992). Candy starred in his first comedic hit in a number of years with &quot;Cool Runnings&quot; (1993), a story of the first Jamaican national bobsleigh team attempting to make it to the 1988 Winter Olympics. He also had a cameo in the successful &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; (1993). He made his directorial debut in the 1994 comedy television film &quot;Hostage for a Day&quot;. His last appearances were in &quot;Wagons East&quot; (1994) and &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; (1995).

===Unfinished projects===
Candy was in talks to portray Ignatius J. Reilly in a now-shelved film adaptation of John Kennedy Toole&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize–winning novel &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;. He had also expressed interest in portraying Atuk in a film adaptation of Mordecai Richler&#x27;s &quot;The Incomparable Atuk&quot; and Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle in a biopic based on the silent film comedian&#x27;s life. These three shelved projects have been alleged as cursed because Candy, John Belushi, Sam Kinison, and Chris Farley were each attached to all three roles; they all died before they could make any of these films. Candy was originally considered to play Alec Guinness&#x27;s role in the remake of the 1950 film &quot;Last Holiday&quot;, with Carl Reiner directing. Eventually the role was played by Queen Latifah in a loose remake released in 2006. Candy was also slated to collaborate with John Hughes again in a comedy opposite Sylvester Stallone, titled &quot;Bartholomew vs. Neff&quot;. Candy and Stallone were to have portrayed feuding neighbors. In the animated Disney film &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, the role of Redfeather the Turkey was written for him, but was subsequently cut from the film after his death. Stephen King reportedly wanted Candy to portray Billy Halleck in the film adaptation of his novel &quot;Thinner&quot;.

==Personal life==
Candy and his wife Rosemary Hobor had two children, Christopher Michael and Jennifer Anne. He was a Roman Catholic.

Candy was a longtime resident of Brentwood, Los Angeles.

=== Sports ===
In 1991, Bruce McNall, Wayne Gretzky, and Candy became owners of the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Toronto Argonauts. The celebrity ownership group attracted attention in Canada, and the team spent a significant amount of money, even signing some highly touted National Football League prospects such as wide receiver Raghib Ismail. The Argonauts took home the 1991 Grey Cup, beating Calgary 36–21 in the final. Only McNall&#x27;s name was originally etched onto the Grey Cup trophy as an owner of the team, but in 2007, Candy&#x27;s and Gretzky&#x27;s names were added as well.

=== Health problems and death ===
Candy publicly shared his experiences of living with severe anxiety and panic attacks.

Candy died in his sleep at the age of 43, on March 4, 1994, in Durango, Mexico, while filming &quot;Wagons East&quot;; a spokeswoman said that Candy&#x27;s cause of death was a heart attack. He tended to binge eat in response to professional struggles and weighed more than at some points in his life. Candy had a number of risk factors for heart attack, including strong family history (his father had died prematurely of a heart attack, although his children say he was unaware of his genetic risk), smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, obesity, alcohol abuse, and cocaine use. However, Candy was concerned about his weight. He once lost over a summer while preparing to film &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot;. He frequently dieted and exercised with trainers because of his family history.

==Legacy==
Candy&#x27;s funeral was held at St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church in Los Angeles. Candy was entombed in the mausoleum at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City. His crypt lies just above that of a fellow actor, Fred MacMurray. On March 18, 1994, a special memorial service for Candy, produced by his former improvisation troupe the Second City, was broadcast across Canada.

&quot;Wagons East&quot; was completed using a stunt double and special effects and released five months after Candy&#x27;s death. His final completed film was &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot;, a satirical comedy by Michael Moore released a year after Candy&#x27;s death. Candy played American sheriff Bud Boomer, who led an &quot;invasion&quot; of Canada. Candy recorded a voice for the TV film &quot;The Magic 7&quot; in the early 1990s. The film remained in production for years owing to animation difficulties and production delays, and it was eventually shelved.

Candy was posthumously inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in 1998. In May 2006, Candy became one of the first four entertainers ever honored by Canada Post by being featured on a postage stamp. On October 31, 2020, Toronto Mayor John Tory proclaimed &quot;John Candy Day&quot; in honor of what would have been John Candy&#x27;s 70th birthday.

&quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; is dedicated to three people, including Candy, who played a supporting role in the original &quot;Blues Brothers&quot;. A tribute to Candy was hosted by Dan Aykroyd at the 2007 Grey Cup festivities in Toronto in November 2007.

Experimental rock band Ween&#x27;s album &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot;, released in 1994, is &quot;dedicated in loving memory to John Candy (1950–1994)&quot;. At the time lead singer Gene Ween remarked, &quot;There was so much going on about [the suicide of] Kurt Cobain, and nobody mentioned John Candy at all. I have a special little spot in my heart for him.&quot;

After his death, the John Candy Visual Arts Studio at Neil McNeil Catholic High School in Toronto was dedicated in his honour. Candy, one of the school&#x27;s most famous alumni, said during one of his annual visits to the school, &quot;My success is simply rooted in the values and discipline and respect for others that I was taught at Neil McNeil.&quot; It has been suggested, among others, that the Canadian Screen Awards be given the official nickname &quot;The Candys,&quot; both in honour of the actor and because the name suggests Canada.

<text>In Aztec mythology, Centeōtl (also known as Centeocihuatl or Cinteotl) is the maize deity. &quot;Cintli&quot; means &quot;dried maize still on the cob&quot; and &quot;teōtl&quot; means &quot;deity&quot;. According to the Florentine Codex, Centeotl is the son of the earth goddess, Tlazolteotl and solar deity Piltzintecuhtli, the planet Mercury. He was born on the day-sign 1 Xochitl. Another myth claims him as the son of the goddess Xochiquetzal. The majority of evidence gathered on Centeotl suggests that he is usually portrayed as a young man (although a debate is still ongoing), with yellow body colouration. Some specialists believe that Centeotl used to be the maize goddess Chicomecōātl. Centeotl was considered one of the most important deities of the Aztec era. There are many common features that are shown in depictions of Centeotl. For example, there often seems to be maize in his headdress. Another striking trait is the black line passing down his eyebrow, through his cheek and finishing at the bottom of his jaw line. These face markings are similarly and frequently used in the late post-classic depictions of the &#x27;foliated&#x27; Maya maize god.

== Controversy ==
According to sources, Cinteotl is the god of maize and subsistence and Centeotl corresponds to Chicomecoatl, the goddess of agriculture.

== Worship ==
In the Tonalpohualli (a 260-day sacred calendar used by many ancient Mesoamerican cultures), Centeotl is the Lord of the Day for days with number seven and he is the fourth Lord of the Night. In Aztec mythology, maize (which was called Cintli in Nahuatl, the Aztec spoken language) was brought to this world by Quetzalcoatl and it is associated with the group of stars known commonly today as the Pleiades.

At the beginning of the year (most likely around February), Aztec workers would plant the young maize. These young maize plants potentially were used as symbolism for a pretty goddess, most likely &quot;Chicomecōātl&quot;, Princess of the Unripe Maize. &quot;Chicomecōātl&quot; is usually depicted carrying fresh maize in her hands, bare-breasted, and sitting down in a modest manner. An interesting conflict exists in that some historians believe &quot;Chicomecōātl&quot;, otherwise known as &#x27;the hairy one&#x27; and Centeotl are the same deity. When the seeds were planted, a ritual dance occurred in order to thank Mother Earth and more specifically Centeotl. These dances became increasingly more prominent as the warmth of the sun brought about great prosperity for the Aztecs in the form of sprouting maize canes. This festival has been compared to the more Western maypole festival due to the similarity of their celebrations (dancing for spring, feasting, etc.). These festivals were probably very pleasant for the Aztecs, judged by similar festivals in other civilizations. A major custom in Mexico during this festival period was for female Aztecs, regardless of marital status to loosen their ponchos and let down their hair. They would proceed to dance bare-breasted in the maize fields in order to thank Centeotl for his work. Then each female would pick five ears of corn from the field and bring it back in a grand procession while singing and dancing. Women in these processions were the promises of food and life in the Aztec world. Traditionally, massive fights would break out as people tried to soak one another in flower pollen or scented maize flour. Also, flower petals were thrown in ceremonial fashion over people who were carrying the ears of corn.

Corn was rather essential to Aztec life and thus the importance of Centeotl cannot be overlooked. It can be seen from countless historical sources that a lot of the maize that was cultivated by the Aztecs was used in sacrifices to gods. Usually, at least five newly ripened maize cobs were picked by the older Aztec women. These were then carried on the female&#x27;s backs after being carefully wrapped up, somewhat like a mother would wrap up a newborn child. Once the cobs reached their destination, usually outside a house, they were placed in a special corn basket and would stay there until the following year. This was meant to represent the resting of the maize spirits until the next harvesting period came around.

These five cobs were also symbols for a seemingly separate goddess. This highly worshipped goddess was known as Lady Chicomecoatl, Seven Serpents. She was the earth spirit and the lady of fertility and life, seen as a kind of mother figure in the Aztec world and was the partner of Centeotl.

<text>In Aztec mythology, Tlahzolteōtl (or , ) is a deity of sex, sexuality, lust, sin, vice, impurity, purification, fertilizer, steam baths, and a patroness of adulterers. She is known by three names, (&quot;she who eats or filthy excrescence [sin]&quot;) and (&quot;the death caused by lust&quot;), and or (, Deity of Cotton), the latter of which refers to a quadripartite association of four sister deities.

 is the deity for the 13th of the sacred 260-day calendar Tōnalpōhualli, the one beginning with the day , or First Movement. She is associated with the day sign of the jaguar.

Tlazolteotl played an important role in the confession of wrongdoing through her priests.

==Aztec religion==
There was a Huastec mother goddess from the Gulf Coast who was assimilated into Aztec views of Tlazolteotl.

==Quadripartite deities==
Under the name of she was thought to be , composed of four sisters of different ages known by the names (the first born), (the younger sister, also ), (the middle sister, also ) and (the youngest sister). When conceived of as four individual deities, they were called or ; individually, they were deities of luxury.

==Sin==

===Forgiveness of sin===
According to Aztec belief, it was Tlazolteotl who inspired vicious desires and who likewise forgave and cleaned away sin. She was also thought to cause disease, especially STDs. It was said that Tlazolteotl and her companions would afflict people with disease if they indulged themselves in forbidden love. The uncleanliness was considered both on a physical and moral level and could be cured by steam bath, a rite of purification, or calling upon the Tlazoltēteoh, the deities of love and desires.

===Purification===
For the Aztecs, there were two main deities thought to preside over purification: Tezcatlipoca, because he was thought to be invisible and omnipresent, therefore seeing everything; and Tlazolteotl, the deity of lechery and unlawful love. It is said that when a man confessed before Tlazolteotl everything was revealed. Purification with Tlazolteotl would be done through a priest. One could only receive the &quot;mercy&quot; once in their life, which is why the practice was most common among the elderly.

The priest (&quot;tlapouhqui&quot;) would be consulted by the penitent and would consult the 260-day ritual calendar (tonalpohualli) to determine the best day and time for the purification to take place. On the day of, he would listen to the sins confessed and then render judgment and penance, ranging from fasts to presentation of offerings and ritual song and dance, depending on the nature and the severity of the sin.

===Dirt eating===
 was called &quot;Deity of Dirt&quot; () and &quot;Eater of Ordure&quot; (, &#x27;she who eats dirt [sin]&#x27;) with her dual nature of deity of dirt and also of purification. Sins were symbolized by dirt. Her dirt-eating symbolized the ingestion of the sin and in doing so purified it. She was depicted with ochre-colored symbols of divine excrement around her mouth and nose. In the Aztec language the word for sacred, , comes from , the buttocks, and religious rituals include offerings of &quot;liquid gold&quot; (urine) and gold (Nahuatl teocuitlatl &quot;divine excrement&quot;, which Klein jocularly translated to English as &quot;holy shit&quot;). Through this process, she helped create harmony in communities.

==Festival==
 was one of the primary Aztec deities celebrated in the festival of (meaning &quot;sweeping&quot;) that was held September 2–21 to recognize the harvest season. The ceremonies conducted during this timeframe included ritual cleaning, sweeping, and repairing, as well as the casting of corn seed, dances, and military ceremonies.

== In popular culture ==
In the film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, the fictitious artifact, the Golden Idol is based on the actual Aztec Dumbarton Oaks birthing figure. The artifact is presumed to depict Tlazolteotl.

<text>The Swirling Eddies are an American rock band that began as an anonymous spinoff from the band Daniel Amos, along with new drummer David Raven.

==Career==
For each Swirling Eddies release, band members adopted pseudonyms for the liner notes; &quot;Camarillo Eddy&quot; (Terry Scott Taylor), &quot;Berger Roy Al&quot; (Tim Chandler), &quot;Gene Pool&quot; (Greg Flesch), &quot;Arthur Fhardy&quot; (Rob Watson), &quot;Spot&quot; (Jerry Chamberlain), and &quot;Hort Elvison&quot; (David Raven). These pseudonyms were dropped for their third album, &quot;Zoom Daddy&quot;. Over the years new Eddies appeared on the band&#x27;s albums including &quot;Prickly Disco&quot; (Gene Eugene), Picky Swelly, Newt York Newt York, Derry Air (Derri Daugherty), and Judy Ism. &quot;Guest Eddies,&quot; a term used for musicians that contributed musically to one of the band&#x27;s projects also made appearances on nearly every album. The list of &quot;Guest Eddies&quot; includes Buckeye Jazzbo, Miracle Babe, Mary Baker Eddy, Jeb McSwaggart (Ed McTaggart), Mike Roe, and Eddie DeGarmo. As early as 1991, Taylor saw the Eddies as an ever-evolving and ever-growing family of like-minded musicians. At that time, in an interview with Harvest Rock Syndicate, Taylor explained that the plan was to &quot;(open) the Eddies up to even more artists, sort of make the Eddies this conglomerate of different people that I&#x27;ve always wanted to work with, and have a lot of song-writing teams involved and different lead singers. Just make it this mass of people, that sort of fluctuates and changes.&quot;

The band released its debut album on Alarma Records in 1988 entitled &quot;Let&#x27;s Spin!&quot;. &quot;Outdoor Elvis&quot;, released in 1989, featured the band&#x27;s first two radio singles, &quot;Driving in England&quot; and &quot;Hide the Beer, the Pastor&#x27;s Here!&quot;. The title track included lines such as: &quot;It&#x27;s said he croons when the moon&#x27;s above, singing tenderly &#x27;Hunk of Burning Love.&#x27;&quot; The band&#x27;s humorous &quot;documentary&quot; video, &quot;Spittle and Phlegm&quot;, was released the following year.

In 2004, the band began to work on their first album of original, new material in ten years entitled &quot;The midget, the speck and the molecule&quot;. The recording sessions ended in May 2007 and the album was released on July 23, 2007.

Tim Chandler died on October 8, 2018.

<doc id="90253" wikidata="Q2703840" url="?curid=90253" title="Tōnacātēcuhtli">
<text>In Aztec mythology, Tonacatecuhtli was a creator and fertility god, worshipped for populating the earth and making it fruitful. Most Colonial-era manuscripts equate him with Ōmetēcuhtli. His consort was Tonacacihuatl.

Tonacateuchtli is depicted in the Codex Borgia.
==Etymology==
The god&#x27;s name is a compound of two Nahuatl words: and . While is generally translated &quot;lord&quot;, presents several possible interpretations. Some read this root as (without the long &#x27;o&#x27;), consisting of , meaning &quot;human flesh&quot; or &quot;food&quot;, with the possessive prefix (&quot;our&quot;). By this etymology, would mean &quot;Lord of Our Food&quot; or &quot;Lord of Our Flesh&quot;, most commonly rendered &quot;Lord of Our Sustenance.&quot; The word simply means &quot;abundance&quot;, giving the alternate reading &quot;Lord of Abundance&quot;.

==Origin and role==
Tōnacātēcuhtli was the Central Mexican form of the aged creator god common to Mesoamerican religion. According to the Codex Ríos, the History of the Mexicans as Told by Their Paintings, the Histoyre du Mechique, and the Florentine Codex, Tōnacātēcuhtli and his consort Tōnacācihuātl resided in &quot;in Tōnacātēuctli īchān&quot; (&quot;the mansion of the Lord of Abundance&quot;), also known as Omeyocan, the 13th, highest heaven, from which human souls descended to earth. Tōnacātēcuhtli is associated with procreation, appearing in pre-Columbian art near copulating humans. In the Florentine Codex, Sahagún relates that Aztec midwives would tell newborns after bathing them, &quot;You were created in the place of duality, the place above the nine heavens. Your father and mother—Ōmetēuctli and Ōmecihuātl, the heavenly woman—formed you, created you.&quot;

In terms of the Aztec calendar, Tōnacātēcuhtli was the patron of Cipactli, the first of the twenty days in a month, as well as presiding over the trecena (thirteen-day ritual week) named 1 Cipactli (itself the first of the trecenas).

In the Codex Chimalpopoca, Tōnacātēcuhtli and Tōnacācihuātl are listed as one of several pairs of gods to whom Quetzalcoatl prays.

He turned the goddess Quaxolotl into a dog when she offended him.

<text>Noodles are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is either rolled flat and cut, stretched, or extruded, into long strips or strings. Noodles are a staple food in many cultures and made into a variety of shapes. The most common noodles are those derived from either Chinese cuisine or Italian cuisine. Chinese noodles are known by a variety of different names, while Italian noodles are known as pasta.

While long, thin strips may be the most common, many varieties of noodles are cut into waves, helices, tubes, strings, or shells, or folded over, or cut into other shapes. Noodles are usually cooked in boiling water, sometimes with cooking oil or salt added. They can also be steamed, pan-fried, deep-fried, or baked. Noodles are often served with an accompanying sauce or in a soup, the latter being known as noodle soup. Noodles can be refrigerated for short-term storage or dried and stored for future use.

== Etymology ==
The word for noodles in English was borrowed in the 18th century from the German word &quot;&quot; (). The German word likely came from or , and referred to any dumpling, though mostly of wheat.

Colloquial uses for noodle to refer to someone&#x27;s head, or to a &quot;dummy&quot; are unrelated, and likely came from the older English word &quot;noddle.&quot;

==History==

===Origin===
The earliest written record of noodles is found in a book dated to the Eastern Han period (25–220 CE). Noodles made from wheat dough became a prominent food for the people of the Han dynasty. The oldest evidence of noodles was from 4,000 years ago in China. In 2005, a team of archaeologists reported finding an earthenware bowl that contained 4,000-year-old noodles at the Lajia archaeological site. These noodles were said to resemble lamian, a type of Chinese noodle. Analyzing the husk phytoliths and starch grains present in the sediment associated with the noodles, they were identified as millet belonging to &quot;Panicum miliaceum&quot; and &quot;Setaria italica&quot;. However, other researchers cast doubt that Lajia&#x27;s noodles were made from specifically millet: it is difficult to make pure millet noodles, it is unclear whether the analyzed residue were directly derived from Lajia&#x27;s noodles themselves, starch morphology after cooking shows distinctive alterations that does not fit with Lajia&#x27;s noodles, and it is uncertain whether the starch-like grains from Laijia&#x27;s noodles are starch as they show some non-starch characteristics.

The general consensus among food historians is that pasta originated somewhere in the Mediterranean region: a homogenous mixture of flour and water called &quot;itrion&quot; was described by 2nd-century Greek physician Galen, among 3rd to 5th-century Jews &quot;itrium&quot; was described by the Jerusalem Talmud and &quot;itriyya&quot; (Arabic cognate of the Greek word), referred to string-like shapes made of semolina and dried before cooking - as defined by the 9th-century physician and lexicographer Isho bar Ali.

===Historical variations===
====East Asia====
There are over 1,200 types of noodles commonly consumed in China today. They vary widely according to the region of production, ingredients, shape or width, and manner of preparation. Due to the vast diversity of Chinese noodles, there is no single Chinese word equivalent to the Western concept of &quot;noodles,&quot; nor is the notion of &quot;noodles&quot; as a unified food category recognized within Chinese cuisine.

In Standard Mandarin, &quot;miàn&quot; (simplified Chinese: 面; traditional Chinese: 麵) means &quot;dough&quot; but can be used to refer to noodles made from wheat flour and grains such as millet, sorghum, and oats. While &quot;fěn&quot; (粉) means &quot;powder&quot; but can be used to refer to noodles made from other starches, particularly rice flour and mung bean starch. 

Wheat noodles in Japan (&quot;udon&quot;) were adapted from a Chinese recipe as early as the 9th century. Innovations continued, such as noodles made with buckwheat (&quot;naengmyeon&quot;) were developed in the Joseon Dynasty of Korea (1392–1897). Ramen noodles, based on southern Chinese noodle dishes from Guangzhou but named after the northern Chinese lamian, became common in Japan by 1900.

====Central Asia====
Kesme or erişte noodles were eaten by Turkic peoples by the 13th century. 

====West Asia====
Ash reshteh (noodles in thick soup with herbs) is one of the most popular dishes in some middle eastern countries such as Iran.

====Europe====

In the 1st century BCE, Horace wrote of fried sheets of dough called &quot;lagana&quot;. However, the cooking method does not correspond to the current definition of either a fresh or dry pasta product.

=====Italy=====
The first concrete information on pasta products in Italy dates back to the Etruscan civilization, the Testaroli. The first noodles will only appear much later, in the 10th or 11th centuries, and there is a popular legend about Marco Polo bringing the first pasta back from China. Modern historians do not give much credibility to the story and rather believe the first noodles were imported earlier from the Arabs, in a form called &quot;rishta&quot;. Pasta has taken on a variety of shapes, often based on regional specializations.

=====Germany=====
In Germany, documents dating from 1725 mention &quot;Spätzle&quot;. Medieval illustrations are believed to place this noodle at an even earlier date.

===== Armenia =====
Armenian variety of noodle, Arishta, is prepared from wheat, water and salt. It is thick and is usually eaten with matzoon, clarified butter and garlic.

====Ancient Israel and diaspora====
The Latinized word &quot;itrium&quot; referred to a kind of boiled dough. Arabs adapted noodles for long journeys in the fifth century, the first written record of dry pasta. Muhammad al-Idrisi wrote in 1154 that &quot;itriyya&quot; was manufactured and exported from Norman Sicily. &quot;Itriya&quot; was also known by the Persian Jews during early Persian rule (when they spoke Aramaic) and during Islamic rule. It referred to a small soup noodle, of Greek origin, prepared by twisting bits of kneaded dough into shape, resembling Italian orzo.

=====Polish Jews=====
&quot;Zacierki&quot; is a type of noodle found in Polish Jewish cuisine.
It was part of the rations distributed to Jewish victims in the Łódź Ghetto by the Nazis.
(Out of the &quot;major ghettos&quot;, Łódź was the most affected by hunger, starvation and malnutrition-related deaths.)
The diary of a young Jewish girl from Łódź recounts a fight she had with her father over a spoonful of &quot;zacierki&quot; taken from the family&#x27;s meager supply of 200 grams a week.

<text>In Aztec mythology, Chicōmecōātl &quot;Seven Serpent&quot;, was the Aztec goddess of agriculture during the Middle Culture period. She is sometimes called &quot;goddess of nourishment&quot;, a goddess of plenty and the female aspect of maize.

More generally, Chicōmecōātl can be described as a deity of food, drink, and human livelihood.

She is regarded as the female counterpart of the maize god &quot;Centeōtl&quot;, their symbol being an ear of corn. She is occasionally called &quot;Xīlōnen&quot;, (meaning doll made of corn), who was married also to &quot;Tezcatlipoca&quot;.

== Significance of Name ==
Chicomecōātl&#x27;s name, &quot;Seven Serpent&quot;, is thought to be a reference to the duality of the deity. While she symbolizes the gathering of maize and agricultural prosperity, she also is thought to be harmful to the Aztecs, as she was thought to be of blame during years of poor harvest.

== Appearance &amp; Depiction ==
Her appearance is mostly represented with red ochre on the face, paper headdress on top, water-flowers patterned shirt, and foam sandals on the bottom. She is also described as carrying a sun flower shield.

She is also often appeared with attributes of &quot;Chalchiuhtlicue&quot;, such as her headdress and the short lines rubbing down her cheeks. Chicomecōātl is usually distinguished by being shown carrying ears of maize. She is shown in three different forms:

* As a young girl carrying flowers
*As a woman who brings death with her embraces
*As a mother who uses the sun as a shield
== Festivals ==
She is particularly recognized during Huey Tozoztli, the first of sequence of three festivals held in high season marking the harvest. During the festival, her priestesses designate seed corn that is to be planted in the coming season. To appease the deity, as well as to ask for good harvest, priests often engaged in child sacrifice. Dried seed maize, harvested and retained for the following year, bore the title Chicomecōātl, while maize consumed following harvest season was generally referred to as Cinteotl.

<doc id="90276" wikidata="Q2088018" url="?curid=90276" title="Cihuacōātl">
<text>Cihuacōātl was one of a number of motherhood and fertility goddesses in Aztec mythology. She was sometimes known as Quilaztli.

Cihuacōātl was especially associated with midwives, and with the sweat lodges where midwives practiced. She is paired with Quilaztli and was considered a protectress of the Chalmeca people and patroness of the city of Culhuacan. She helped Quetzalcoatl create the current race of humanity by grinding up bones from the previous ages, and mixing it with his blood. She is also the mother of Mixcoatl, whom she abandoned at a crossroads. Tradition says that she often returns there to weep for her lost son, only to find a sacrificial knife. 

Cihuacōātl held political symbolism as she represented victory for the Mexica state and the ruling class.

Although she was sometimes depicted as a young woman, similar to Xōchiquetzal, she is more often shown as a fierce skull-faced old woman carrying the spears and shield of a warrior. Childbirth was sometimes compared to warfare and the women who died in childbirth were honored as fallen warriors. Their spirits, the Cihuateteo, were depicted with skeletal faces like Cihuacōātl. Like her, the Cihuateteo were thought to haunt crossroads at night to steal children.

==Functionary of Tenochtitlan==
The name &quot;cihuacoatl&quot; was used as a title for one of the low functionaries of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital. The &quot;cihuacoatl&quot; supervised the internal affairs of the land as opposed to the Aztec ruler, who oversaw the affairs of the Aztec state. The &quot;cihuacoatl&quot; commanded the army of Tenochtitlan to the emperor. During the course of the 15th century AD, Tlacaelel served as &quot;cihuacoatl&quot; under four emperors: Moctezuma I, Axayacatl, Tizoc and Ahuizotl.

<doc id="90277" wikidata="Q106610695" url="?curid=90277" title="Railbanking">
<text>Railbanking is the practice of preserving rail corridors for possible future use. Railbanking leaves the railroad, railbed, bridges or bridge corridor, and other infrastructure intact. This relieves the railroad&#x27;s operator from the responsibility of maintenance, and from taxation. Existing rails may or may not be maintained intact on the railbed, depending on their condition or any planned interim use of the railbed. Often the rail corridor is put in custody of a state transportation agency, which then seeks a new operator for possible rehabilitation or reactivation. This helps ensure the possibility of future restored rail service when new economic conditions may warrant resuming operation.
==In the United States==
In the United States, railbanking was established in 1983 as an amendment to Section 8(d) of the National Trails System Act. It is a voluntary agreement between a railroad company and a trail sponsor (such as a trail organization or government agency) to use an out-of-service rail corridor as a rail trail until a railroad might need the corridor again for rail service. It takes place during the abandonment process.

In places with many environmental laws and other governmental regulations as the United States, it is very difficult to restore an abandoned line, but it is easier with a railbanked line than one that has undergone a &quot;total abandonment,&quot; as the federal government guarantees the railroad the full rights to reactivate it. A railbanked line can be reopened within a year&#x27;s time while an abandoned corridor could take years to be reactivated, if possible at all. In railbanking, the government helps fund the line&#x27;s rebuild. 

In the 25-year period from 1983 to 2008, of railroad have been abandoned. Of that, , representing 56.8% of the total, were originally negotiated for railbanking agreements. And of that, only or 35.8% of the lines abandoned actually reached a railbanking agreement because 21% percent of the railbanking agreements failed and were ultimately abandoned. The remaining 43.2% of the lines, representing , were lines that railroads never considered trying to have railbanked, and were abandoned in their entirety. In total, were not railbanked (64.2%). Some railroads refuse to railbank lines, and instead sell the land in parcels to the surrounding landowners.

Since railbanking began in 1983, less than twenty railbanked corridors have been approved for reactivation by the Surface Transportation Board (STB). Some of these reactivated corridors had only short sections reactivated, while others had the entire corridor reactivated. Railbanked corridors are usually utilized as multi-use recreational trails for cyclists, walkers, joggers, snowmobiling, cross country skiing, and horseback riding.

The land over which railways pass may have many owners—private, rail operator, or governmental—and, depending on the terms under which it was originally acquired, the type of operating rights may also vary. Without railbanking, on closure, some parts of a railway&#x27;s route might otherwise revert to the former owner. The owner could reuse them for any purpose, or modify the ground conditions, potentially prejudicing the line&#x27;s future reuse if required. However, the landowner must agree to keep the infrastructure such as bridges and tunnels intact.

Approximately 85% of the railroad rights-of-way in the United States were acquired by easement from the then-abutting property owners. Normally, when the use for an easement is abandoned, the easement is extinguished and the land is not burdened by this adverse use. In 1983, Congress passed what is now known as the federal Rails-To-Trails law codified as 16 U.S.C. 1247(d). The federal law took the property rights of property owners throughout the United States for rail trails. Several property owners sued the government as the law took property without compensation. In 1990, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the property owners were entitled to compensation for the land taken for these rail trails. In 1996, the plaintiff was awarded $1.5 million as compensation for the land taken for a trail through his property (see &quot;Preseault v. U.S.&quot;, 100 F3d 1525, Fed. Cir. [1996]).

The state of Connecticut has taken a proactive approach to preserving railway rights-of-way. Since the 1970s, Connecticut Department of Transportation policy has been to acquire abandoned rail lines for preservation. This has contributed to the majority of railroad mileage in Connecticut being publicly owned, between the state and Amtrak. Today, this policy continues; the State will purchase any right-of-way that shows future potential for transportation, when the property becomes available. CDOT has subsequently transferred 60 miles of right-of-way to the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection for use in rail trails, and CDEEP itself has independently obtained another 50 miles (22 of which are used for the Valley Railroad). A provision of this transfer is that CDOT is allowed to retake ownership of a right-of-way when needed for transportation purposes. Because of this, Connecticut is one of the only states where railbanked corridors have a reasonable chance of reactivation, should there be a need to, where elsewhere local opposition from trail users and property abutters would be able to directly influence a municipally-owned right-of-way.

Often, most of or all infrastructure is removed regardless of future use. In some cases laws have been passed to remove infrastructure. For example, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, a law was made to remove all unused railroad overpasses. Another example is a natural disaster. If a flood washes away a railbanked railroad bridge, that is beyond the owner&#x27;s control. The local, state, and federal governments could give some financial help for the railroad to rebuild any infrastructure that may have been damaged or destroyed during the time that it was unused.
A single section of a route changed in this way could have serious consequences for the viability of a restoration of rail service, with the costs of repurchasing the land or right-of-way or of restoring the site to its former condition outweighing the economic benefit. Over the full length of a railway&#x27;s route with many different owners, the reopening costs could be considerable. 

In 2017 the STB ruled that Neosho County, Kansas violated the Trails Act when it foreclosed on and sold three parcels of railbanked land where each spanned the full width of the right-of-way. The county&#x27;s sales of the parcels were preempted by federal law and were vacated to keep the rail line available for reactivation.

==In the United Kingdom ==
In the United Kingdom, thousands of miles (kilometers) of railway were closed under the Beeching Axe cuts in the 1960s. While several of these routes have subsequently been reopened, none were formally treated as land banks in the US manner. The Beeching closures were driven by the government&#x27;s desire to reduce expenditure on railways, and so most lines were offered for sale to the highest bidder, a process that frequently led to great fragmentation in the ownership of former UK railway lines and reuse of the land for entirely different purposes. The Ryle Telescope on the former OxfordCambridge Varsity Line is possibly the most extreme example, but commercial and residential developments are common.

<text>Mixcoatl (, from mixtli &quot;cloud&quot; and cōātl &quot;serpent&quot;), or Camaxtle or Camaxtli, was the god of the hunt and identified with the Milky Way, the stars, and the heavens in several Mesoamerican cultures. He was the patron deity of the Otomi, the Chichimecs, and several groups that claimed descent from the Chichimecs. Under the name of Camaxtli, Mixcoatl was worshipped as the central deity of Huejotzingo and Tlaxcala.

==Representation==
Mixcoatl is represented with a black mask over his eyes and distinctive red and white pin stripes painted on his body. These features are shared with Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, the Lord of the Dawn, god of the morning star, as well as Itzpapalotl, goddess of infant mortality who was sometimes said to be his mother. Unlike Tlahuizcalpanteuctli, Mixcoatl can usually be distinguished by his hunting gear, which included a bow and arrows, and a net or basket for carrying dead game.

==Mythology==
Mixcoatl was one of four children of Tonacatecutli, meaning &quot;Lord of Sustenance,&quot; an aged creator god, and Cihuacoatl, a fertility goddess and the patroness of midwives. Sometimes Mixcoatl was worshipped as the &quot;Red&quot; aspect of the god Tezcatlipoca, the &quot;Smoking Mirror,&quot; who was the god of sorcerers, rulers, and warriors. In one story, Tezcatlipoca transformed himself into Mixcoatl and invented the fire drill by revolving the heavens around their axes, bringing fire to humanity. Along with this cosmic fire drill, Mixcoatl was the first to strike fire with flint. These events made Mixcoatl a god of the Milky Way, along with war, and the hunt.

Mixcoatl was the father of 400 sons, collectively known as the Centzon Huitznahua, who ended up having their hearts eaten by Huitzilopochtli. The Centzon Huitznahua met their demise when they, and their sister Coyolxauhqui, after finding their mother Coatlicue pregnant, conspired to kill her. However, as they attacked she gave birth to a fully formed and armed Huitzilopochtli, who proceeded to kill his half-siblings. Mixcoatl was also related to 400 more gods, the Centzonmimixcoa, whom, together with his 3 brothers (all different from the ones named above) and their sister, he slew by ambush. Mixcoatl was also thought of as being the father of another important deity, Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent.

Quetzalcoatl&#x27;s father Mixcoatl was murdered; Quetzalcoatl was informed by Cozcaquauhtli that &quot;the uncles who had killed his father were Apanecatl, Zolton, and Cuilton.&quot;

The Codex Mendieta gives Mixcoatl six giant children, counted among the Quinametzin:
== Xipetotec, Camaxtle, Mixcoatl or Red Tezcatlipoca ==

Originally the name of the first son of the creative couple Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl is Tlatlauhca or Tlatlauhaqui-Tezcatlipoca (Red Tezcatlipoca), &quot;Smoking red mirror.&quot; Of obscure origin, this god is honored by the Tlaxcalans and Huejocinas with the name of Camaxtli (Camaxtle), and apparently a deity of Zapotlan, Xalisco, is widely known in almost all of Mesoamerica with the name of Xipetotec, &#x27;Our Lord Flayed&#x27;. His body is dyed yellow on one side and lined on the other, his face is carved, superficially divided into two parts by a narrow strip that runs from the forehead to the jawbone. His head wears a kind of hood of different colors with tassels that hang down his back. The Tlaxcala myth that refers to Camaxtle, a god identified as Xipe-Totec himself

It is difficult to discern if Camaxtle is the same Tlatlauhqui Tezcatlipoca-Xipetotec or Yayauhqui-Tezcatlipoca (Black Tezcatlipoca) who changes his name to Mixcoatl; or Huitzilopochtli himself as identified by some informants and authors. He is related to fire and hunting. After the destruction of the earth by water, came chaos. Everything was desolation. Humanity had died and the heavens were over the earth. When the gods saw that the heavens had fallen, they resolved to reach the center of the Earth, opening four subterranean paths for this, and to enter these paths to lift them up. To reward such a great action, Tonacacihuatl and Tonacatecuhtli made their children the lords of the heavens and the stars, and the path that Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl traveled was marked by the Milky Way. And this great nebula was also called Mixcoatl or Iztac-Mixcoatl, &#x27;white cloud snake&#x27;

Jerónimo de Mendieta determines that Iztac-Mixcoatl is the personification of the Milky Way, the inhabitant of Chicomoztoc that the Nahuas call ‘White Cloud Serpent’, since such is the shape of the great nebula in the sky. And Ilancueye is nothing more than the personification of the Earth.

== Centzon Mimixcoa ==
In Ce Tecpatl, after the Creation of the Fifth Sun in Teotihuacan, Camaxtle, one of the four gods, ascended to the Eighth Heaven and created four men and one woman to feed the Sun; But barely formed, they fell into the water, they returned to the sky and there was no war, frustrated by this attempt, Camaxtle struck a cane on a rock, and at the blow 400 Chichimecs Mimixcoa sprouted that populated the earth before the Aztecs. Camaxtle was able to do penance on the rock, drawing blood with maguey spikes, tongue and ears, and prayed to the gods that the four men and one woman created in the eighth heaven would come down to kill the barbarians to feed to the Sun.

The four men and one woman created in the Eighth Heaven are the five Mimixcoa who would later sacrifice the 400 Mimixcoa, called Chichimecs or Otomies.

In Ce Tecpatl, the Mimixcoa were born, their mother Iztac-Chalchiuhtlicue went into a cave (Chicomoztoc or Tlalocan) and gave birth to five other Mimixcoa called Cuauhtlicoauh; Mixcoatl; Cuitlachcihuatl; Tlotepe; and Apantecuhtli. After spending four days in the water, the five Mimixcoa were suckled by Mecitli, who by the text identifies with the Earth Goddess (Tlaltecuhtli or Coatlicue). And immediately the Sun ordered the 400 Mimixcoa; The Sun Tonatiuh gives them arrows and says: &quot;Here it is with what they will serve me to drink, with what they will feed, and a shield. And the precious arrows cast in quetzal t-shirt feathers; in heron rowing feathers; in t-shirt feathers of zacuam; in tlauhquechol t-shirt feathers; and in xiuhtototl t-shirt feathers; and also she, the Earth (Tlaltecuhtli or Coatlicue), who is your mother&quot;, but the Centzon Mimixcoa did not do their duty, instead they get drunk on tzihuactli wine - a small maguey and have sex with women. And immediately, the Sun also orders the five who were born last, immediately gives them the maguey arrow and gives them the divine shield. The five Mimixcoa climb a mesquite tree where the 400 discover them, they exclaim: &quot;Who are these who are such as us?&quot;, then the five hide in specific places: Cuauhtlicoauh takes shelter in a tree; Mixcoatl on the ground; Tlotepe in the mount; Apantecuhtli in the water; and Cuitlachcihuatl in a court of the Tlachtli ball court. Finally, the Centzon Mimixcoa are defeated by his five younger brothers, who served the Sun Tonatiuh, gave him a drink.

== Ritual associations ==
Quecholli, the 14th veintena, the 20-day Aztec month (November 19th Julian calendar, November 29th Gregorian calendar), was dedicated to Mixcoatl. The celebration for this month consisted of hunting and feasting in the countryside. The hunters would take the form of Mixcoatl by dressing like him, kindling a new fire to roast the hunted game. Along with these practices, a man and woman would be sacrificed to Mixcoatl at his temple.

==Modern associations and references==
In modern scientific nomenclature, the names Mixcoatl–Camaxtli have been assigned to: 
*Camaxtli Patera, one of the paterae (shallow craters) on the Jovian moon of Io
*&quot;Pseudoeurycea mixcoatl&quot;, a species of lungless salamander endemic to Mexico
*&quot;Mixcoatlus barbouri&quot;, a species of viper endemic to Mexico (previously &quot;Cerrophidion barbouri&quot;).

<text>Cipactli ( &quot;crocodile&quot; or &quot;caiman&quot;) was the first day of the Aztec divinatory count of 13 X 20 days (the &quot;tonalpohualli&quot;) and &quot;Cipactonal&quot; &quot;Sign of Cipactli&quot; was considered to have been the first diviner. In Aztec cosmology, the crocodile symbolized the earth floating in the primeval waters. According to one Aztec tradition, &quot;Teocipactli&quot; &quot;Divine Crocodile&quot; was the name of a survivor of the flood who rescued himself in a canoe and again repopulated the earth. In the Mixtec Vienna Codex (Codex Vindobonensis Mexicanus I), Crocodile is a day associated with dynastic beginnings.

In Aztec mythology, Cipactli was a primeval sea monster, part crocodilian, part fish, and part toad or frog, with indefinite gender. Always hungry, every joint on its body was adorned with an extra mouth. The deity Tezcatlipoca sacrificed a foot when he used it as bait to draw the monster nearer. He and Quetzalcoatl created the earth from its body.

Karl A. Taube has noted that among the Formative-period Olmec and the pre-Hispanic Maya peoples, crocodilians were identified with rain-bringing wind, probably because of the widespread belief that wind and rain clouds are &quot;breathed&quot; out of cave openings in the earth. A series of Olmec-style basreliefs from Chalcatzingo in the state of Morelos portrays crocodilians breathing rain clouds from their upturned mouths. Portable green stone Olmec sculptures depict crocodilians in similar positions, indicating that they are probably also breathing.

In the Maya tzolk&#x27;in, the day Cipactli corresponds to Imix. In the Mayan Popol Vuh, the name of the earthquake demon, Sipakna, apparently derives from Cipactli. Sipakna is the demon Sipak of 20th century Highland Maya oral tradition. In Migian, Cipactli is Quanai.
In other versions, Cipactli is called Tlaltecuhtli, a deity referred to as the &quot;earth monster&quot;.

<text>In Aztec mythology, the Cihuateteo (; , in singular ) or &quot;Divine Women&quot;, were the spirits of women who died in childbirth. They were likened to the spirits of male warriors who died in violent conflict, because childbirth was conceptually equivalent to battle in Aztec culture. According to tradition, a woman in labor was said to capture the spirit of her newborn child similar to the way a warrior captures his opponent in battle. These spirits are also associated with the west, the place where the sun sets each day.

== Mythology ==
The &quot;Cihuateteo&quot; resided in a region in the west known as &quot;Cihuatlampa&quot;, the “place of women.” Each day, they guided the sun into the west from noon until sunset, and are occasionally suggested to have even borne it through the underworld until it rose again. They were aided by the spirits of male warriors, and this practice of guiding the sun was seen as exclusive to these two groups of the deceased—it was an honor that was not bestowed on any other individuals.

On five specific days in the Aztec calendar, the &quot;cihuateteo&quot; descended to the earth: 1 Deer, 1 Rain, 1 Monkey, 1 House, and 1 Eagle. While on earth, they were considered to be demons of the night, and often haunted crossroads. Roadside shrines were often erected to appease them, as they were believed to steal children, cause madness and seizures, and induce men to adultery. The figure of a &quot;cihuateotl&quot; from the Metropolitan Museum of Art has been inscribed on top of her head with the name &quot;Ce Calli&quot;, “1 House,” while the figure from the British Museum is inscribed with the glyph “1 Monkey”—these indicate their respective days of descent.

== Funerary practices ==
When an Aztec woman experienced childbirth, it was seen as a violent and laborious effort likened to the intensity of battle. It was believed that the child was sent down to the earth by the gods, and the woman had to fight and struggle in order to bring it into the world. The newborn child was seen as a sufficient reward if she was successful and emerged victorious from her “fight” with the gods, but if she lost and proved unsuccessful, then she died and her soul underwent transformation into a &quot;cihuateotl&quot;.

In the case of the death of the woman, special funerary practices were carried out, as the body of a woman who had died in childbirth was believed to possess special powers and magic following the departure of the soul from the body. In these special practices, the body was guarded fiercely by an armed entourage that included the widowed husband, his friends, all the midwives, and old women. This was deemed necessary due to the need to protect the woman&#x27;s human remains from male warriors. Parts of the body believed to be especially potent relics for warriors were the left middle finger and the hair. According to Aztec belief, “these relics had magical power and, if placed on their shields, would make the warriors brave and valiant, give them strength, and blind the eyes of their enemies.”

== Depictions in art ==
&quot;Cihuateteo&quot; can be characterized as “fearsome figures with clenched, claw-like fists, macabre, bared teeth and gums and aggressive poses.” Sitting with their clawed feet tucked beneath their skirts, they seem at once in repose and ready to attack. In Aztec art, the postpartum female body is often depicted with pendulous breasts and stomach folds. Within Aztec artistic tradition, &quot;cihuateteo&quot; are commonly depicted with taut stomachs, exposed breasts, and prominent nipples. These are all features that serve to highlight their unrealized potential as mothers, as these women died before having the opportunity to bear and nurse their newborn child.

Oftentimes, &quot;cihuateteo&quot; are also depicted with swirling, unkempt orange hair and skirts fastened with snake belts. &quot;Cihuateteo&quot; figures found at the site of El Zapotal even carry staffs bearing heads as trophies, and seem to be covered with flayed skins, which suggests deference or worship to a female vegetation deity. The serpent around the waist may be a reference to the serpentine goddess Cihuacoatl, who was not only associated with war, sacrifice, and political power, but also with fertility, childbirth, and midwifery. Finally, the unkempt hair is often associated with darkness and the earth. Not only was &quot;Cihuatlampa&quot; a place of darkness, but most Aztec associations with the earth (and particularly earth goddesses) symbolize both childbirth and sacrifice, two of the defining traits of the &quot;cihuateteo&quot; themselves.

<doc id="90295" wikidata="Q1471691" url="?curid=90295" title="Huehueteotl">
<text>Huehueteotl ( ; ) is an aged Mesoamerican deity figuring in the pantheons of pre-Columbian cultures, particularly in Aztec mythology and others of the Central Mexico region. The spellings Huehuetéotl and Ueueteotl are also used. Although known mostly in the cultures of that region, images and iconography depicting Huehueteotl have been found at other archaeological sites across Mesoamerica, such as in the Gulf region, western Mexico, Protoclassic-era sites in the Guatemalan highlands such as Kaminaljuyú and Late-Postclassic sites on the northern Yucatán Peninsula (Miller and Taube, 1993:189). The name Huehueteotl stems from Nahuatl &quot;huēhueh&quot; (&quot;old&quot;) and &quot;teōtl&quot; (&quot;god&quot;). It seems to connect the Old God to certain Mayan deities called &quot;Mam&quot; (&quot;Grandfather&quot;).

Huehueteotl is frequently considered to overlap with, or be another aspect of, a central Mexican/Aztec deity associated with fire, [[Xiuhtecuhtli]]. In particular the Florentine Codex identifies Huehueteotl as an alternative epithet for Xiutecuhtli, and consequently that deity is sometimes referred to as Xiutecuhtli-Huehueteotl. However, Huehueteotl is characteristically depicted as an aged or even decrepit being, often with a beard, whereas Xiutecuhtli&#x27;s appearance is much more youthful and vigorous, in line with his marked association with rulership and (youthful) warriors.

==Worship==

The Florentine Codex describes an Aztec religious observance during the monthly feast of Izcalli (dedicated to Xiuhtecuhtli and Tlaloc), when boys had to hunt in the swamps for small water-related animals, such as snakes, lizards, frogs and even dragonfly larvae, and present these to elders serving as the guardians of the fire deity. As a reward for the offerings, the priest would give them steamed corn dough (tamales) stuffed with amaranth greens. At this occasion the god was represented as young with turquoise and quetzal feathers for ceremonial purposes. Later during the month he appeared as aging and tired, covered with the colours of gold, black and red. Perhaps this transformation of young into old can explain the fact that in the codices, Xiuhtecuhtli appears as a vigorous young man, whereas his representations in stone show him to be aged and decrepit.

In another, more dramatic, and better known celebration, the Aztecs cut out the hearts of human sacrifices and burned them on coal. As a result of this, the people would regain Huehueteotl&#x27;s favour through the god&#x27;s elements — fire and blood.

<text>In Aztec mythology, Xiuhtēcuhtli (&quot;Turquoise Lord&quot; or &quot;Lord of Fire&quot;), was the god of fire, day and heat. In historical sources he is called by many names, which reflect his varied aspects and dwellings in the three parts of the cosmos. He was the lord of volcanoes, the personification of life after death, warmth in cold (fire), light in darkness and food during famine. He was also named Cuezaltzin (&quot;flame&quot;) and Ixcozauhqui , and is sometimes considered to be the same as [[Huehueteotl]] (&quot;Old God&quot;), although Xiuhtecuhtli is usually shown as a young deity. His wife was Chalchiuhtlicue. Xiuhtecuhtli is sometimes considered to be a manifestation of Ometecuhtli, the Lord of Duality, and according to the Florentine Codex Xiuhtecuhtli was considered to be the father of the Gods, who dwelled in the turquoise enclosure in the center of earth. Xiuhtecuhtli-Huehueteotl was one of the oldest and most revered of the indigenous pantheon. The cult of the God of Fire, of the Year, and of Turquoise perhaps began as far back as the middle Preclassic period. Turquoise was the symbolic equivalent of fire for Aztec priests. A small fire was permanently kept alive at the sacred center of every Aztec home in honor of Xiuhtecuhtli.

The Nahuatl word &quot;xihuitl&quot; means &quot;year&quot; as well as &quot;turquoise&quot; and &quot;fire&quot;, and Xiuhtecuhtli was also the god of the year and of time. The Lord of the Year concept came from the Aztec belief that Xiuhtecuhtli was the North Star. In the 260-day ritual calendar, the deity was the patron of the day &quot;Atl&quot; (&quot;Water&quot;) and with the trecena 1 Coatl (&quot;1 Snake&quot;). Xiuhtecuhtli was also one of the nine Lords of the Night and ruled the first hour of the night, named &quot;Cipactli&quot; (&quot;Alligator&quot;). Scholars have long emphasized that this fire deity also has aquatic qualities. Xiuhtecuhtli dwelt inside an enclosure of turquoise stones, fortifying himself with turquoise bird water. He is the god of fire in relation to the cardinal directions, just as the brazier for lighting fire is the center of the house or temple. Xiuhtecuhtli was the patron god of the Aztec emperors, who were regarded as his living embodiment at their enthronement. The deity was also one of the patron gods of the &quot;pochteca&quot; merchant class.

Stone sculptures of Xiuhtecuhtli were ritually buried as offerings, and various statuettes have been recovered during excavations at the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan with which he was closely associated. Statuettes of the deity from the temple depict a seated male with his arms crossed. A sacred fire was always kept burning in the temples of Xiuhtecuhtli. In gratitude for the gift of fire, the first mouthful of food from each meal was flung into the hearth.

Xiuhtecuhtli is depicted in the Codex Borgia.

==Attributes==
 Xiuhtecuhtli&#x27;s face is painted with black and red pigment. Xiuhtecuhtli was usually depicted adorned with turquoise mosaic, wearing the turquoise &quot;xiuhuitzolli&quot; crown of rulership on his head and a turquoise butterfly pectoral on his chest, and he often wears a descending turquoise &quot;xiuhtototl&quot; bird (&quot;Cotinga amabilis&quot;) on his forehead and the Xiuhcoatl fire serpent on his back. He owns fire serpent earplugs. On his head he has a paper crown painted with different colors and motifs. On top of the crown there are sprays of green feathers, like flames from a fire. He has feather tufts to each side, like pendants, toward his ears. On his back he has plumage resembling a dragon&#x27;s head, made of yellow feathers with marine conch shells. He has copper bells tied to the insteps of his feet. In his left hand he holds a shield with five greenstones, called &quot;chalchihuites&quot;, placed in the form of a cross on a thin gold plate that covered almost all the shield. In his right hand he has a kind of scepter that was a round gold plate with a hole in the middle, and topped by two globes, one larger than the other, the smaller one had a point. Xiuhtecuhtli is closely associated with youthful warriors and with rulership, and was considered a solar god. His principal symbols are the &quot;tecpatl&quot; (flint) and the &quot;mamalhuatzin&quot;, the two sticks that were rubbed together to light ceremonial fires. A staff with a deer&#x27;s head was also an attribute of Xiuhtecuhtli, although not exclusively so as it could also be associated with Xochiquetzal and other deities.

Many of the attributes of Xiuhtecuhtli are found associated with Early Postclassic Toltec warriors but clear representations of the god are not common until the Late Postclassic. The &quot;nahual&quot;, or spirit form, of Xiuhtecuhtli is Xiuhcoatl, the Fire Serpent.

Xiuhtecuhtli was embodied in the &quot;teotecuilli&quot;, the sacrificial brazier into which sacrificial victims were cast during the New Fire ceremony. This took place at the end of each cycle of the Aztec calendar round (every 52 years), when the gods were thought to be able to end their covenant with humanity. Feasts were held in honor of Xiuhtecuhtli to keep his favors, and human sacrifices were burned after removing their heart.

==Annual festival==

The annual festival of Xiuhtecuhtli was celebrated in &quot;Izcalli&quot;, the 18th veintena of the year. The Nahuatl word izcalli means &quot;stone house&quot; and refers to the building where maize used to be dried and roasted between mid-January and mid-February. The whole month was therefore devoted to fire. The Izcalli rituals grew in importance every four years. A framework image of the deity was constructed from wood and was richly finished with clothing, feathers and an elaborate mask. Quails were sacrificed to the idol and their blood spilt before it and copal was burnt in his honour. On the day of the festival, the priests of Xiuhtecuhtli spent the day dancing and singing before their god. People caught animals, including mammals, birds, snakes, lizards and fish, for ten days before the festival in order to throw them into the hearth on the night of the festival. On the tenth day of Izcalli, during a festival called &quot;huauhquiltamalcualiztli&quot; (&quot;eating of the amaranth leaf tamales&quot;), the New Fire was lighted, signifying the change of the annual cycle and the rebirth of the fire deity. During the night the image of the god was lit with using the &quot;mamalhuatzin&quot;. Food was consumed ritually, including shrimp tamales, after first offering it to the god.
Every four years a more solemn version of the festival was held at the temple of Xiuhtecuhtli in Tenochtitlan, attended by the emperor and his nobles. Slaves and captives were dressed as the deity and sacrificed in his honour. Godparents were assigned to children on this day and the children had their ears ritually pierced. After this, the children, their parents and godparents all shared a meal together.

==New Fire Ceremony==

Xiuhtecuhtli was celebrated often but especially at the end of every 52-year period. This was the time the 365-day solar and the 260-day sacred calendars ended on the same day and the Aztec celebrated the Binding of the Years with the New Fire Ceremony. In order to perform the ritual, priests marched in solemn procession up the Hill of the Star on a peninsula near &quot;Culhuacán&quot; to wait for the star &quot;Yohualtecuhtli&quot; (either Aldebaran in the Taurus constellation or the Pleiades as a whole) to get past its zenith. Having ascertained this, they would tear out the heart of a sacrificial victim and kindle a flame in a small wooden hearth they placed inside the hole left in his chest. Priests used a drill method to generate this sacred flame. It was then carried on pine sticks to light the fires anew in every hearth, including the sacred braziers of perpetual fire, that numbered over 600 in the capital alone.

==In popular culture==
A set of six postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail in 2003 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the British Museum featured a mask of Xiuhtecuhtli alongside other Museum objects such as the Sutton Hoo helmet and Hoa Hakananai&#x27;a.

<doc id="90298" wikidata="Q185415" url="?curid=90298" title="Doodle">
<text>A doodle is a drawing made while a person&#x27;s attention is otherwise occupied. Doodles are simple drawings that can have concrete representational meaning or may just be composed of random and abstract lines or shapes, generally without ever lifting the drawing device from the paper, in which case it is usually called a scribble.

Doodling and scribbling are most often associated with young children and toddlers, because their lack of hand–eye coordination and lower mental development often make it very difficult for any young child to keep their coloring attempts within the line art of the subject. Despite this, it is not uncommon to see such behavior with adults, in which case it is generally done jovially, out of boredom.
Typical examples of doodling are found in school notebooks, often in the margins, drawn by students daydreaming or losing interest during class. Other common examples of doodling are produced during long telephone conversations if a pen and paper are available.

Popular kinds of doodles include cartoon versions of teachers or companions in a school, famous TV or comic characters, invented fictional beings, landscapes, geometric shapes, patterns, textures, or phallic scenes. Most people who doodle often remake the same shape or type of doodle throughout their lifetime.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;doodle&quot; first appeared in the early 17th century to mean a fool or simpleton. It may derive from the German &quot;Dudeltopf&quot; or &quot;Dudeldop&quot;, meaning simpleton or noodle (literally &quot;nightcap&quot;). It is the origin of the early eighteenth-century verb &quot;to doodle&quot;, meaning &quot;to swindle or to make a fool of&quot;. The modern meaning emerged as a term for a politician who was doing nothing in office at the expense of his constituents. That led to the more generalized verb &quot;to doodle&quot;, which means to do nothing.

In the final courtroom scene of the 1936 film &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot;, the main character explains the concept of &quot;doodling&quot; to a judge unfamiliar with the word, saying that &quot;People draw the most idiotic pictures when they&#x27;re thinking.&quot; The character, who has travelled from a fictional town in Vermont, describes the word &quot;doodler&quot; as being &quot;a name we made up back home&quot; for people who make &quot;foolish designs&quot; on paper when their mind is on something else.

The meaning &quot;fool, simpleton&quot; is intended in the song title &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;, originally sung by British colonial troops during the American Revolutionary War.

==Effects on memory==
According to a study published in the scientific journal &quot;Applied Cognitive Psychology&quot;, doodling can aid a person&#x27;s memory by expending just enough energy to keep one from daydreaming, which demands a lot of the brain&#x27;s processing power, as well as from not paying attention. Thus, it acts as a mediator between the spectrum of thinking too much or thinking too little and helps focus on the current situation. The study was done by Professor Jackie Andrade, of the School of Psychology at the University of Plymouth, who reported that doodlers in her experiment recalled 7.5 pieces of information (out of 16 total) on average, 29% more than the average of 5.8 recalled by the control group made of non-doodlers.

Doodling has positive effects on human comprehension as well. Creating visual depictions of information allows for a deeper understanding of material being learned. When doodling, a person is engaging neurological pathways in ways that allow for effective and efficient sifting and processing of information. For these reasons, doodling is used as an effective study tool and memory device.

== As a therapeutic device ==
Doodling can be used as a stress relieving technique. This is similar to other motor activities such as fidgeting or pacing that are also used to alleviate mental stress. According to a review of over 9,000 submitted doodles, nearly 2/3 of respondents recalled doodling when in a &quot;tense or restless state&quot; as a means to reduce those feelings. Scientists believe that doodling&#x27;s stress relieving properties arise from the way that the act of doodling engages with the brain&#x27;s default mode network. According to graphologist and behavior specialist Ingrid Seger-Woznicki, &quot;we [doodle] because we’re problem solving on an unconscious level&quot; and seeking to &quot;create our life without stressing about it&quot;. Doodling is often incorporated into art therapy, allowing its users to slow down, focus and de-stress.

==History==

Doodling have been found on multiple archaelogical artefacts at different times around the world. Examples include hand and foot prints intentionally left by children 200,000 years ago in Tibet, first century drawing of stick figures and gladiators in Pompeii, obscene drawing in the Sogdian documents from Dunhuang (9-10th century). A young student named Onfim from 13th century Novgorod left a variety of doodles in his school notes, written on birch bark.

== Notable doodlers ==
Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s notebooks are celebrated for their superabundance of marginal doodles, which include sketches of friends&#x27; profiles, hands, and feet. These notebooks are regarded as a work of art in their own right. Full editions of Pushkin&#x27;s doodles have been undertaken on several occasions. Some of Pushkin&#x27;s doodles were animated by Andrei Khrzhanovsky and Yuriy Norshteyn in the 1987 film &quot;My Favorite Time&quot;.

Other notable literary doodlers have included: Samuel Beckett; the poet and physician John Keats, who doodled in the margins of his medical notes; Sylvia Plath; and the Nobel laureate (in literature, 1913) poet Rabindranath Tagore, who made numerous doodles in his manuscript.

Mathematician Stanislaw Ulam developed the Ulam spiral for visualization of prime numbers while doodling during a boring presentation at a mathematics conference.

Many American Presidents, including Thomas Jefferson, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton, have been known to doodle during meetings.

A portfolio featuring American Presidents&#x27; doodles while in office, including those of Herbert Hoover, John F. Kennedy, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, can be found in &quot;Presidential Doodles: Two Centuries of Scribbles, Scratches, Squiggles &amp; Scrawls from the Oval Office&quot;, introductions by Paul Collins and David Greenberg (New York: Cabinet Books and Basic Books, 2006, )
Some doodles and drawings can be found in notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci.

<doc id="90300" wikidata="Q936993" url="?curid=90300" title="Huixtocihuatl">
<text>In Aztec religion, Huixtocihuatl (or Uixtochihuatl, Uixtociuatl) was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water. The Aztecs considered her to be the older sister of the rain gods, including Tlaloc. Much of the information known about Huixtocihuatl and how the Aztecs celebrated her comes from Bernardino de Sahagún&#x27;s manuscripts. His Florentine Codex explains how Huixtocihuatl became the salt god. It records that Huixtocihuatl angered her younger brothers by mocking them, so they banished her to the salt beds. It was there where she discovered salt and how it was created. As described in the second book of the Florentine Codex, during Tecuilhuitontli, the seventh month of the Aztec calendar, there was a festival in honor of Huixtocihuatl. The festival culminated with the sacrifice of Huixtocihuatl&#x27;s ixiptla, the embodiment of the deity in human form.

== Associations ==
Huixtocihuatl was considered a provider god along with Chicomecoatl and Chalchiuhtlicue. The three were sisters who together provided man with three life essentials: salt, food, and water.

In Codex Telleriano-Remensis, Huixtocihuatl is associated with the goddess Ixcuina, who represented filth and excrement. This relationship suggests that Huixtocihuatl was likely associated with urine, which was seen as salty and impure. Her association with the provider gods was not necessarily positive, and her association with urine and filth was not necessarily negative. The Aztecs recognized filth and disorder as a vital stage in the patterns of growth and renewal.

== Iconography ==
Primeros Memoriales, a manuscript written by Bernardino de Sahagún before his Florentine Codex, contains a description of Huixtocihuatl paired with an illustration. The Aztecs believed that the essence of a deity could be captured by a human impersonator, or ixiptla, of the god. Primeros Memoriales therefore illustrates and describes the likeness of Huixtocihuatl, who would have embodied the salt god. Sahagun&#x27;s description closely follows its associated illustration, saying,&quot;Her facial paint is yellow./ Her paper crown has a quetzal feather crest./ Her gold ear plugs./ Her shift has the water design./ Her skirt has the water design./ Her small bells./ Her sandals./ Her shield has the water lily design./ In her hand is her reed staff.&quot;In the Florentine Codex, Sahagún expands upon his description of Huixtocihuatl, describing the appearance of the deity captured by the impersonator. Sahagun likens her face paint, costume, and feathers to a maize plant at antithesis. He says, &quot;Her [face] paint and ornamentation were yellow. This was of yellow ochre or the [yellow] of maize blossoms. And [she wore] her paper cap with quetzal feathers in the form of a tassel of maize. It was of many quetzal feathers, full of quetzal feathers, so that it was covered with green, streaming down, glistening like precious green feathers.&quot;Sahagún goes on to describe Huixtocihuatl&#x27;s other notable characteristics. He points out that her shirt and skirt were both embroidered with a design emulating water. The border of her shirt and skirt had a cloud design. These features, more closely related to water than to salt, may reflect Huixtocihuatl&#x27;s familial ties to the water gods. Sahagún also points out that bells bound to an ocelot skin were attached to her ankles and legs. These bells made a symphony of noise when she walked. Sahagún furthermore provides details about Huixtocihuatl&#x27;s sandals, shield, and reed staff. Her shield was covered with a water lily leaf design, hung with yellow parrot feathers, and swung around by the ixiptla when she danced. The reed staff also held an important role for the ixiptla, as it was what she used to mark the beat of songs during the festival in her honor.

== Ritual ==
During Tecuilhuitontli, the seventh month of the Aztec calendar which occurred in June, there was a festival in her honor. During the festival, one woman was considered to be the ixiptla, or the embodiment, of Huixtocihuatl. That woman would be sacrificed by the end of the festival.

Bernardino de Sahagún dedicates the second book of the Florentine Codex to describing the various ceremonies of the Aztecs. The twenty-sixth chapter of this book provides details about the ceremonies of Tecuilhuitontli, focusing on the festival in Huixtocihuatl&#x27;s honor. Salt-makers would honor the deity with dances that lasted for ten days. Daughters of the salt-makers, and many more, engaged in these dances. In the Florentine Codex, Sahagún describes the range of participants in Huixtocihuatl&#x27;s festival. He says, &quot;All gathered together and took their places, the salt people and the salt-makers - the old women, the mature women, the maidens, and maidens recently matured.&quot;
Dance played an important role in Tecuilhuitontli. Dancers arranged themselves in rows, and sang songs in a high tremble. Sahagún points out that their voices &quot;rang like a bell&quot;. While the women sang and danced, the men and elders directed the dancers. The dancers wore garlands of iztauhyatl, the flower artemisia, while those watching the festival carried the flower. Song and dance in honor of Huixtocihuatl continued for ten days, and culminated on the last day of Tecuilhuitontli, when priests sacrificed the ixiptla on the shrine dedicated to Tlaloc on the Templo Mayor. Dancers escorted the likeness of Huixtocihuatl to the temple. Captives, to be slain along with the ixiptla, also joined the procession to the temple. Priests, adorned with quetzal feathers, slay the captives first. Sahagún emphasizes the significance of the sacrifice of the captives. He wrote that the captives would be, &quot;Her companions, her fellows in death; who were to be first, who would die [first].&quot;Sahagún continues his description of Huixtocihuatl&#x27;s sacrifice with vivid details of the ritual slaughter. Priests used the sharp snout of a sword fish to cut into her neck, then into her breast. Afterwards, the priests cut her heart out, raised it as an offering, and stored it in a green stone jar. Sahagún explains that after the sacrifice, people scattered and celebrated the end of the festival with banquets. All those who were affiliated with salt would drink wine. Sahagún describes the atmosphere of the night, pointing out that participants in the festival were drunk by the time they went to sleep.

<text>In Aztec mythology, Itztlacoliuhqui is the god of frost. He also represents matter in its lifeless state.

The Nahuatl name &quot;Itztlacoliuhqui&quot; is usually translated into English as &quot;curved obsidian blade&quot;. J. Richard Andrews contends that this is a mistranslation and that the correct interpretation is &quot;everything has become bent by means of coldness&quot; or &quot;plant-killer-frost&quot;.

In the Aztec calendar, Itztlacoliuhqui is the lord of the thirteen days from 1 Lizard to 13 Vulture. The preceding thirteen days are ruled over by Patecatl and the following thirteen by Tlazolteotl.

The creation of this god appeared in the Aztec myth of creation. Tonatiuh, the sun god, demanded obedience and sacrifice from the other gods before he will move. Enraged at his arrogance, the god of dawn and the planet Venus, Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, shoots an arrow at the sun. However, the dart misses its mark and the sun throws his own back at the morning star, piercing the Lord of Dawn through the head. At this moment, Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli is transformed into the god of obsidian stone and coldness, Itztlacoliuhqui.
Itztlacoliuhqui&#x27;s iconography depicts a straw broom (&quot;&quot;) in his hand, symbolizing the function of this wintry death deity as the cleaner of the way for new life to emerge thereafter.

<text>Iztaccíhuatl or Ixtaccíhuatl (both forms also spelled without the accent) ( or, as spelled with the x, ) is a dormant volcanic mountain in Mexico located on the border between the State of Mexico and Puebla within Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park. It is the nation&#x27;s third highest, after Pico de Orizaba at , and Popocatépetl at .

The name &quot;Iztaccíhuatl&quot; is Nahuatl for &quot;White (like salt) woman&quot;, reflecting the four individual snow-capped peaks which depict the head, chest, knees and feet of a sleeping female when seen from east or west. Iztaccíhuatl is to the north of its twin Popocatépetl, to which it is connected by the high altitude Paso de Cortés. Depending on atmospheric conditions Iztaccíhuatl is visible much of the year from Mexico City some to the northwest. The first recorded ascent was made in 1889, though archaeological evidence suggests the Mexica and previous cultures climbed it previously. It is the lowest peak containing permanent snow and glaciers in Mexico.

== Geology ==
The summit ridge of the massive volcano is a series of overlapping cones constructed along a NNW-SSE line to the south of the Pleistocene Llano Grande caldera. There have been andesitic and dacitic Pleistocene and Holocene eruptions from vents at or near the summit. Areas near the El Pecho summit vent are covered in flows and tuff beds post-dating glaciation, approximately 11,000 years ago. The most recent vents are at El Pecho and a depression at along the summit ridge midway between El Pecho and Los Pies.

== Legend of Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl ==

In Tlaxcaltecan mythology, &quot;Iztaccíhuatl&quot; was a princess who fell in love with one of her father&#x27;s warriors, Popocatépetl. The emperor sent Popocatépetl to war in Oaxaca, promising him Iztaccíhuatl as his wife when he returned (which Iztaccíhuatl&#x27;s father presumed he would not). Iztaccíhuatl was falsely told that Popocatépetl had died in battle, and believing the news, she died of grief. When Popocatépetl returned to find his love dead, he took her body to a spot outside Tenochtitlan and knelt by her grave. The gods covered them with snow and changed them into mountains. Iztaccíhuatl&#x27;s mountain is called &quot;White Woman&quot; (from Nahuatl &quot;white&quot; and &quot;woman&quot;) because it resembles a woman lying on her back, and is often covered with snow — the peak is sometimes nicknamed &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Sleeping Woman&quot;. Popocatépetl became an active volcano, raining fire on Earth in blind rage at the loss of his beloved.

== Elevation ==
Iztaccihuatl is usually listed at , but SRTM data and the Mexican national mapping survey assert that a range of is more accurate. The Global Volcanism Program cites .

<text>Popocatépetl ( , , ; ) is an active stratovolcano located in the states of Puebla, Morelos, and Mexico in central Mexico. It lies in the eastern half of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. At it is the second highest peak in Mexico, after Citlaltépetl (Pico de Orizaba) at .

It is linked to the twin volcano of Iztaccihuatl to the north by the high saddle known as the &quot;Paso de Cortés&quot;. Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park, wherein the two volcanoes are located, is named after them.
Popocatépetl is southeast of Mexico City, from where it can be seen regularly, depending on atmospheric conditions. Until recently, the volcano was one of three tall peaks in Mexico to contain glaciers, the others being Iztaccihuatl and Pico de Orizaba. In the 1990s, the glaciers such as Glaciar Norte (North Glacier) greatly decreased in size, partly due to warmer temperatures but largely due to increased volcanic activity. By early 2001, Popocatépetl&#x27;s glaciers were gone; ice remained on the volcano, but no longer displayed the characteristic features of glaciers such as crevasses.

Lava erupting from Popocatépetl has historically been predominantly andesitic, but it has also erupted large volumes of dacite. Magma produced in the current cycle of activity tends to be a mixture of the two with the andesites being rich in magnesium.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Popocatépetl&quot; comes from the Nahuatl words () &quot;it smokes&quot; and &quot;mountain&quot;, meaning &quot;Smoking Mountain&quot;. The volcano is also referred to by Mexicans as &quot;El Popo&quot; affectionately, or to shorten the full name. The alternate nickname &quot;Don Goyo&quot; comes from the mountain&#x27;s association in the lore of the region with San Gregorio, &quot;Goyo&quot; being a nickname-like short form of Gregorio. The name was extended by those who lived in Santiago Xalitzina, a small community from the volcano. Legend says that many years ago, a villager met an old man on the slopes of the mountain, who introduced himself as Gregorio Chino Popocatépetl. Gregorio was a personification of the spirit of the volcano, and communicates with the locals to warn them if an eruption is about to happen. Thus, every March 12, the day of San Gregorio, the locals bring flowers and food to the volcano to celebrate the saint.

== Geology ==
The stratovolcano contains a steep-walled, wide crater. The generally symmetrical volcano is modified by the sharp-peaked Ventorrillo on the NW, a remnant of an earlier volcano. At least three previous major cones were destroyed by gravitational failure during the Pleistocene, producing massive debris avalanche deposits covering broad areas south of the volcano. The modern volcano was constructed to the south of the late-Pleistocene to Holocene El Fraile cone. Three major Plinian eruptions, the most recent of which took place about 800 AD, have occurred from Popocatépetl since the mid-Holocene, accompanied by pyroclastic flows and voluminous lahars that swept basins below the volcano.

According to paleomagnetic studies, the volcano is about 730,000 years old. It is cone shaped with a diameter of at its base, with a peak elevation of . The crater is elliptical with an orientation northeast-southwest. The walls of the crater vary from in height. Popocatépetl is currently active after being dormant for about half of last century. Its activity increased in 1991 and smoke has been seen constantly emanating from the crater since 1993. The volcano is monitored by the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project.

== History ==
The geological history of Popocatépetl began with the formation of the ancestral volcano Nexpayantla. About 200,000 years ago, Nexpayantla collapsed in an eruption, leaving a caldera, in which the next volcano, known as El Fraile, began to form. Another eruption about 50,000 years ago caused that to collapse, and Popocatépetl rose from that. Around 23,000 years ago, a lateral eruption (believed to be larger than the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens) destroyed the volcano&#x27;s ancient cone and created an avalanche that reached up to from the summit. The debris field from that is one of four around the volcano, and it is also the youngest.

Three Plinian eruptions are known to have taken place: 3,000 years ago (1195–830 BC), 2,150 years ago (800–215 BC), and 1,200 years ago (likely 823 AD). The latter two buried the nearby village of Tetimpa, preserving evidence of preclassical culture.

The first recorded European ascent of the volcano was made by an expedition led by Diego de Ordaz in 1519. The early-16th-century monasteries on the slopes of the mountain are a World Heritage Site.

=== Eruptions ===

Popocatépetl is one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico and the most famous, having had more than 15 major eruptions since the arrival of the Spanish in 1519.

====Timeline====
* Mid-to late first century: A violent VEI-6 eruption may have caused the large migrations that settled Teotihuacan, according to DNA analysis of teeth and bones.
* Eruptions were observed in 1363, 1509, 1512, 1519–1528, 1530, 1539, 1540, 1548, 1562–1570, 1571, 1592, 1642, 1663, 1664, 1665, 1697, 1720, 1802, 1917, 1923, 1925, and 1933.
* January and February 1947: There were brief explosions, expelling steam and ash.
* 21 December 1994: The volcano spewed gas and ash, which was carried as far as away by prevailing winds. The activity prompted the evacuation of nearby towns and scientists to begin monitoring for an eruption.
* December 2000: Tens of thousands of people were evacuated by the government, based on the warnings of scientists. Then the volcano made its largest display in 1,200 years.
* 25 December 2005: The volcano&#x27;s crater produced an explosion which ejected a large column of smoke and ash about into the atmosphere and expulsion of lava.
* January and February 2012: Scientists observed increased volcanic activity at Popocatépetl. On January 25, an ash explosion occurred on the mountain, causing much dust and ash to contaminate the atmosphere around it.
* 15 April 2012: There were reports of superheated rock fragments being hurled into the air by the volcano. Ash and water vapor plumes were reported 15 times over 24 hours.
* 8 May 2013: at 7:28 p.m. local time, Popocatépetl erupted again with a high amplitude tremor that lasted and was recorded for 3.5 hours. It began with plumes of ash that rose into the air and began drifting west at first, but later began to drift east-southeast, covering areas of the villages of San Juan Tianguismanalco, San Pedro Benito Juárez and Puebla in smoke and ash. Explosions from the volcano subsequently ejected fragments of fiery volcanic rock to distances of from the crater.
* July 4, 2013: Due to several eruptions of steam and ash for at least 24 hours, at least six U.S. airlines canceled more than 40 flights into and out of Mexico City International Airport and Toluca International Airport.
* 27 August–September 2014: CENAPRED reported explosions, accompanied by steam-and-gas emissions with minor ash and ash plumes that rose above Popocatépetl&#x27;s crater and drifted west, southwest, and west-southwest. On most nights incandescence was observed, increasing during times with larger emissions.
* 29 and 31 August 2014: The Washington Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) reported discrete ash emissions.
* 7 January 2015: CENAPRED reported that ash from recent explosions coated the snow on the volcano&#x27;s upper slopes.
* 28 March 2016: An ash column high was released, prompting the establishment of a &quot;security ring&quot; around the summit.
* 3 April 2016: Popocatépetl erupted, spewing lava, ash and rock.
* August 2016: Eruptions continued, with four discrete blasts on August 17.
* 10 November 2017: at 7:25 local time, an eruption occurred.
* 15 December 2018: at 18:57 local time, the volcano spewed lava, ash and rocks.
* 22 January 2019: at 21:06 local time, the volcano spewed ash up to high and incandescent fragments away.
* 19 March 2019: at 21:38 local time, fragments of the dome shot within radius. Due to continuing activity, on March 28 2019, based on the analysis of the available information, the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Popocatépetl volcano recommended changing the phase of the Yellow Volcanic Warning Light Phase 2 to Yellow Phase 3, which is a preventive measure against the observed changes.
* June 3, 2019: Popocatépetl fired an ash column to approximately above sea level.
* June 18, 2019: Popocatépetl spewed ash clouds to .
* June 24, 2019 Popocatépetl erupted once more, sending an ash cloud some kilometres (thousands of feet) into the air.
* July 18, 2019: Popocatépetl erupted three times, sending ash into the air each time.
* July 20, 2019: volcanic ash was reported in Xochimilco after a morning eruption.
* October 2019: the volcano erupted multiple times in one night.
* November 2019: an eruption forced a KLM flight from Amsterdam to Mexico City to turn back.
* January 9, 2020: Popocatépetl expelled lava and rock and sent ash clouds to .
* January 27, 2020: Popocatépetl erupted in a nighttime display of rock and ash.
* February 5, 2020: Popocatépetl had a moderate explosion producing an ash plume that went up . More explosions on February 15, 18, and 22 sent ash plumes rising from .
* June 22, 2022: Four climbers and a guide began climbing Popocatépetl despite the prohibition of climbing the volcano. One woman died and another was seriously injured when they were showered with volcanic rocks and debris and fell into a gully 1,000 feet from the volcano&#x27;s crater.
* December 19, 2022: Popocatépetl emitted materials up to high
* May 19, 2023: Popocatépetl emitted some ash causing the closure of schools in 11 nearby towns and two days later on May 21, the alert level in Mexico City was raised to Yellow Phase 3 as incandescent fragments were observed and the airports in Mexico City and Puebla were temporarily shut down.
* February 27-28, 2024: Popocatépetl erupted 13 times within 24 hours, causing the cancellation of 22 flights at Mexico City and Puebla International Airports.

== In literature and art ==
In the poem &quot;Romance&quot; (&quot;Chimborazo, Cotopaxi...Popocatapetl&quot;) by Walter J. Turner (1916), Cotopaxi is one of the romantic locations that has stolen the poet&#x27;s heart.

Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl feature prominently in Malcolm Lowry’s 1947 novel &quot;Under the Volcano&quot; as well as the 1984 &quot;feature film of the same name&quot; an adaptation of the novel directed by John Huston.

In visual arts, Popocatépetl is the subject of Marsden Hartley’s 1932 painting &quot;Popocatepetl, Spirited Morning--Mexico,&quot; now at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C.

Several works by Dr. Atl feature Popocatépetl, among them his 1928 &quot;Self-Portrait with Popocatépetl,&quot; now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art and his 1942 &quot;The Shadow of Popo,&quot; now in the Museo Nacional de Arte in Mexico City.

Popocatépetl also features prominently in the Juan Manuel Martinez Caltenco mural on the upper floor Municipal Palace of Atlixco, Puebla. The murals cover much of the palace’s interior and represent an important Poblano contribution to the Mexican muralism movement.

Jesús Helguera’s 1940 masterpiece &quot;La Leyenda de los Volcanes&quot; in Chicago’s National Museum of Mexican Art depicts the myth of Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl.

<doc id="90313" wikidata="Q1399453" url="?curid=90313" title="Nagual">
<text>In Mesoamerican and Toltec spiritual traditions, a Nagual (from the Nahuatl word nāhualli) refers to a human being who can access spiritual power through transformation or deep connection with their tonal counterpart. This ability is not merely about shapeshifting but also about guiding spiritual development and fostering personal transformation by bridging the physical and metaphysical realms. 

Nagualism involves the belief that each person possesses a dual aspect: the tonal, representing their everyday awareness and ego, and the nagual, representing their deeper, limitless self.

The Nagual serves as a guide, helping individuals access hidden potential and spiritual insight by harmonizing these two aspects.

In Mesoamerican folk religion, a nagual (pronounced [na&#x27;wal]) or nahual (both from the Nahuatl word &quot;nāhualli&quot; ) is a human being who has the power to shapeshift into their tonal animal counterpart. Nagualism is tied to the belief one can access power and spiritual insight by connecting with the tonal animal within.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;nagual&quot; derives from the Nahuatl word &quot;nāhualli&quot; , an indigenous religious practitioner, identified by the Spanish as a &#x27;magician&#x27;.

In English, the word is often translated as &quot;transforming witch,&quot; but translations without negative connotations include &quot;transforming trickster,&quot; &quot;shape shifter,&quot; &quot;pure spirit,&quot; or &quot;pure being.&quot;

==Nagual in Toltec Tradition==
In the context of Toltec teachings, a Nagual (from the Nahuatl word &quot;nāhualli&quot;) refers to both the unmanifested energy field of the universe and an individual with the ability to channel that energy for spiritual transformation. The concept is deeply tied to the energetic realms beyond the material world, known as the Tonal and Nagual. While the Tonal encompasses the rational, known aspects of reality, the Nagual represents the unknown and limitless potential of pure energy. The Nagual is not only a universal force but also a person who has achieved mastery over this force, guiding others through personal and spiritual evolution.

==Universal Aspect of the Nagual==
The Nagual in its universal form is the energy field from which all creation arises. It is unbounded by time, space, or form, and exists as pure potentiality. Toltec spiritual seekers aim to access this vast, unknown realm to transcend the limits of the Tonal, expanding their awareness and spiritual capacities. In Toltec terms, this corresponds to a state of total freedom and unity with the universe.

==Individual Aspect of the Nagual==
An individual Nagual is a person who can traverse the realms of both the Tonal and Nagual. These spiritual guides play a crucial role in the Toltec path, helping others reach higher states of awareness. They have mastered the energetic forces of the Nagual, using their understanding to influence change, heal, and bring forth transformation. In this role, they connect people to their own spiritual potential, guiding them on the journey toward greater consciousness and freedom.

==Nagual vs. Tonal==
The relationship between the Nagual and the Tonal is one of balance. While the Tonal represents all that is known—our identity, the world, the self—the Nagual is everything that remains beyond understanding, including the energy field from which the Tonal arises. Achieving personal mastery means integrating these two forces, realizing the limits of the Tonal, and embracing the vastness of the Nagual.

==Modern Interpretations of the Nagual==
In modern spirituality, the Nagual has parallels to concepts like the &quot;Higher Self&quot; or &quot;Universal Consciousness.&quot; Although rooted in Mesoamerican spirituality, it speaks to a universal human experience of accessing deeper layers of awareness. Through practices such as meditation, energy work, and heightened states of consciousness, individuals aim to tap into the Nagual as a source of transformation, much like other traditions that seek unity with universal energy.

==The Nagual as an Archetype in Other Cultures==
While unique to Toltec and Mesoamerican spirituality, similar archetypes to the Nagual can be found across global traditions. In Buddhism, it can be likened to the concept of &quot;Shunyata&quot; (emptiness), or in Hinduism, to &quot;Brahman&quot;, the ultimate, unchanging reality. Both describe states of being or energy that transcend the known and manifest world, much like the Toltec Nagual does.

==The Role of the Nagual in Personal Transformation==
The Nagual is central to personal transformation in Toltec teachings. By accessing the Nagual, individuals can break free from limiting beliefs and patterns of the Tonal. This energetic process allows for deep spiritual growth, healing, and a greater alignment with the higher purpose. The ultimate aim of Toltec spiritual practice is to create a balance between the Tonal and Nagual, leading to a state of &quot;totality&quot; where one is fully connected with both the material and energetic aspects of existence.

== Beliefs ==
Naguals use their powers for good or evil according to their personality. The general concept of nagualism is Mesoamerican in origin. Nagualism is linked with pre-Columbian shamanistic practices through Pre-classic Olmec and Toltec depictions that are interpreted as human beings transforming themselves into animals. The system is linked with the Mesoamerican calendrical system, used for divination rituals. Birth dates often determine if a person can become a nagual. Mesoamerican belief in tonalism, wherein every person has an animal counterpart to which their life force is linked, is drawn upon by nagualism.

However, modern scholars have struggled to grasp the ever-evolving and contentious meanings associated with Mesoamerican Nahua terms like nahualli and tonalli. This includes their derivatives, such as nahualismo and tonalismo. Hence, it&#x27;s recommended to use clearer, descriptive language. For instance, instead of discussing nahualism, we can talk about the belief that certain individuals, often in influential social roles, possess specific spiritual abilities. These abilities allow them to transform into animals or even natural phenomena like lightning, wind, clouds, or fireballs, enabling them to perform remarkable feats while in these &quot;disguises.&quot;

The nagual trait is acquired at birth, along with other characteristics associated with a person&#x27;s birth day. Each day is associated with an animal that has strong and weak aspects. A person born on &quot;Dog Day&quot; would have both strong and weak &#x27;dog&#x27; aspects. In Nahuatl the word &quot;tonalli&quot; is used to refer both to a day and to the animal associated with that day.

The nagual is considered different; where the tonal is the day spirit itself, the nagual is the familiar spirit of the day. It is probable that the tonal represents the daytime aspect and the nagual the nighttime aspect of the tonalli, &#x27;the things of the day&#x27;. Practitioners of powerful magic were normally born on days related to animals with a strong or harmful aspect. They would have specific tonals such as the jaguar or puma. In Aztec mythology the god Tezcatlipoca was the protector of nagualism, because his tonal was the jaguar and he governed the distribution of wealth.

In modern rural Mexico, &quot;nagual&quot; is sometimes synonymous with &quot;brujo&quot; (&quot;wizard&quot;); one who is able to shapeshift into an animal at night (normally into a dog, owl, bat, wolf or turkey), drink blood from human victims, steal property, cause disease, and the like.

In some indigenous communities the nagual is integrated into the religious hierarchy. The community knows who is a nagual, tolerating, fearing and respecting them. Nagualli are hired to remove curses cast by other nagualli. In other communities the accusation of nagualism may result in violent attacks on the accused by the community.

The Western study of nagualism was initiated by archaeologist, linguist, and ethnologist Daniel Garrison Brinton who published &quot;Nagualism: A Study in Native-American Folklore and History&quot;, which chronicled historical interpretations of the word and those who practiced nagualism in Mexico in 1894. He identified various beliefs associated with nagualism in modern Mexican communities such as the Mixe, the Nahua, the Zapotec and the Mixtec.

Subsequently, many studies have described nagualism in different Mesoamerican cultures such as the Zoques and the Jakaltek, K&#x27;iche&#x27;, Q&#x27;eqchi&#x27;, and Tzeltal Maya. Among the Jacaltek, naguals reinforce indigenism by punishing those who collaborate with non-indigenous Ladinos.

In 1955, Gustavo Correa suggested nagualism is not pre-Columbian, arguing that it was wholly imported from Europe, where he compared it to the medieval belief in werewolves. However, shapeshifting folklore is not limited to Europe, nor to the Middle Ages; for example, some of Earth&#x27;s oldest literature, the Bronze Age Eastern Semitic Epic of Gilgamesh, and East Asia&#x27;s Huli Jing (origin of this folklore is of unknown date, but eighteenth century at the latest), contain shapeshifters. The werewolf (lycanthropy) is neither the only nor the earliest form of folklorical therianthropy (shapeshifting from human to animal, or vice versa).

Kaplan concludes that, in Oaxaca, the belief in naguals as evil, shape shifting witches is common in both indigenous and Mestizo populations. According to Kaplan, the belief in animal spirit companions is exclusively indigenous. This is certain for some groups and communities, but for others, such as the Mixes, Chinantecos, Triquis, or Tacuates, those who can control their nahual or alterego are protectors of the people, natural resources and culture of the community, highly revered, but also feared.

The nagual was popularized in shamanism books by author Carlos Castaneda.

== Practice ==
The practice of Nagualism was often accompanied by use of hallucinogens, including peyote, ololiuqui, and psylocibin mushrooms known as &quot;teonanácatl&quot;. Use of these medicinal herbs were said to unlock powers of perception and insight in those performing the nagual rituals.

<text>In Aztec mythology, the god Nanahuatzin or Nanahuatl (or Nanauatzin, the suffix -tzin implies respect or familiarity; ), the most humble of the gods, sacrificed himself in fire so that he would continue to shine on Earth as the Sun, thus becoming the sun god. Nanahuatzin means &quot;full of sores.&quot; According to a translation of the &quot;Histoyre du Mechique&quot;, Nanahuatzin is the son of Itzpapalotl and Cozcamiauh or Tonantzin, but was adopted by Piltzintecuhtli and Xōchiquetzal. In the Codex Borgia, Nanahuatzin is represented as a man emerging from a fire. This was originally interpreted as an illustration of cannibalism. He is probably an aspect of Xolotl.

== Aztec tradition ==
The Aztecs had various myths about the creation, and Nanahuatzin participates in several. In the legend of Quetzalcoatl, Nanahuatzin helps Quetzalcoatl to obtain the first grains which will be the food of humankind. In Aztec mythology, the universe is not permanent or everlasting, but subject to death like any living creature. However, even as it dies, the universe is reborn into a new age, or &quot;Sun.&quot; Nanahuatzin is best known from the &quot;Legend of the Fifth Sun&quot; as related by Bernardino de Sahagún.

In this legend, which is the basis for most Nanahuatl myths, there had been four creations. In each one, one god has taken on the task of serving as the sun: Tezcatlipoca, Quetzalcoatl, Tlaloc, and Chalchiuhtlicue. Each age ended because the gods were not satisfied with the human beings that they had created. Finally, Quetzalcoatl with the aid of Xolotl retrieves the sacred bones of their ancestors, mixes them with corn and his own blood, and manages to make acceptable human beings. However, no other god wants the task of being the Sun.

The gods decide that the fifth, and possibly last, sun must offer up his life as a sacrifice in fire. Two gods are chosen: Tecciztecatl and Nanahuatzin. The former is chosen to serve as the Sun because he is wealthy and strong, while the latter will serve as the Moon because he is poor and ill. Tecciztecatl, who is proud, sees his impending sacrifice and transformation as an opportunity to gain immortality. The humble Nanahuatzin accepts because he sees it as his duty. During the days before the sacrifice, both gods undergo purification. Tecciztecatl makes offerings of rich gifts and coral. Nanahuatzin offers his blood and performs acts of penance.

The gods prepare a large bonfire that burns for four days, and construct a platform high above it from which the two chosen gods must leap into the flames. On the appointed day, Tecciztecatl and Nanahuatzin seat themselves upon the platform, awaiting the moment of sacrifice. The gods call upon Tecciztecatl to immolate himself first. After four attempts to throw himself onto the pyre, which is giving off extremely strong heat by this time, his courage fails him and he desists. Disgusted at Tecciztecatl&#x27;s cowardice, the gods call upon Nanahuatzin, who rises from his seat and steps calmly to the edge of the platform. Closing his eyes, he leaps from the edge, landing in the very center of the fire. His pride wounded upon seeing that Nanahuatzin had the courage that he lacked, Tecciztecatl jumps upon the burning pyre after him.

Nothing happens at first, but eventually two suns appear in the sky. One of the gods, angry over Tecciztecatl&#x27;s lack of courage, takes a rabbit and throws it in Tecciztecatl&#x27;s face, causing him to lose his brilliance. Tecciztecatl thus becomes the moon, which bears the impression of a rabbit to this very day. Yet the Sun remains unmoving in the sky, parching and burning all the ground beneath. Finally the gods realize that they, too, must allow themselves to be sacrificed so that human beings may live. They present themselves to the god Ehecatl, who offers them up one by one. Then, with the powerful wind that arises as a result of their sacrifice, Ehecatl makes the Sun move through the sky, nourishing the earth rather than scorching it.

== Nanahuatzin and Xolotl ==

A close relationship between Xolotl and Nanahuatzin exists. Xolotl is probably identical with Nanahuatl.
Seler characterizes Nanahuatzin (&quot;Little Pustule Covered One&quot;), who is deformed by syphilis, as an aspect of Xolotl in his capacity as god of monsters, deforming diseases, and deformities. The syphilitic god Nanahuatzin is an avatar of Xolotl.

== Salvadoran Nahuatl tradition ==
The fifth sun is identified with Tonatiuh, Nanahuatzin was the youngest of three boys and a girl named &quot;Xochicihuatl&quot; who had emerged from the fruit of the gourd-tree (&quot;Crescentia cujete&quot;), which in turn had grown from the head of a woman that had flown into the night while her body slept. (The head attached itself to a startled deer, and the deer leapt into a canyon, there planting the head in the ground.) Nanahuatzin and his siblings were raised by Tlantepozilamatl (&quot;Iron-Toothed Old Woman&quot;) until she gave to her lover some food they had obtained. The siblings proceeded to butcher that lover and, calling it venison, fed his body to the old woman, then killed her. The siblings found the world&#x27;s supply of maize was concealed within a mountain, known only to a bird feeding on that stock. Where his siblings had failed, Nanahuatzin succeeded in opening the mountain, but in doing so, was himself trapped within.
