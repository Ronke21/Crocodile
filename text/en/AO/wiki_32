<text>Pueraria montana is a species of plant in the botanical family Fabaceae. At least three sub-species (alternatively called varieties) are known. It is closely related to other species in the genus &quot;Pueraria&quot; (&quot;P. edulis&quot; and &quot;P. phaseoloides&quot;) and the common name kudzu is used for all of these species and hybrids between them. The morphological differences between them are subtle, they can breed with each other, and it appears that introduced kudzu populations in the United States have ancestry from more than one of the species.

==Description==
It is a seasonal climbing plant, growing high where suitable surfaces (trees, cliffs, walls) are available, and also growing as ground cover where there are no vertical surfaces. It is a perennial vine with tuberous roots and rope-like, dark brown stems to long. It grows up to per year and can achieve a height of . It has markedly hairy herbaceous stems.

&quot;Pueraria montana&quot; is native to East Asia, primarily subtropical and temperate regions of China, Japan, and Korea, with trifoliate leaves composed of three leaflets. Each leaflet is large and ovate with two to three lobes each and hair on the underside. The species can fix atmospheric nitrogen, which can supply up to 95% of leaf nitrogen to the plant in poor soils. Along the vines are nodes, points at which stems or tendrils can propagate to increase support and attach to structures. As a twining vine, kudzu uses stems or tendrils that can extend from any node on the vine to attach to and climb most surfaces. In addition, the nodes of the kudzu vine have the ability to root when exposed to soil, further anchoring the vine to the ground. The roots are tuberous and are high in starch and water content, and the twining of the plant allows for less carbon concentration in the construction of woody stems and greater concentration in roots, which aids root growth. The roots can account for up to 40% of total plant biomass.

 Flowers are reddish-purple and yellow, fragrant, similar to pea flowers, about wide and are produced at the leaf axis in elongated racemes about long. The flowering period extends from July through October. The fruit is a flat hairy pod about long with three seeds.

Kudzu&#x27;s primary method of reproduction is asexual vegetative spread (cloning) which is aided by the ability to root wherever a stem is exposed to soil. For sexual reproduction, kudzu is entirely dependent on pollinators.

Although kudzu prefers forest regrowth and edge habitats with high sun exposure, the plant can survive in full sun or partial shade. These attributes of kudzu made it attractive as an ornamental plant for shading porches in the Southeastern United States, but they facilitated the growth of kudzu as it became a “structural parasite” of the southern states, enveloping entire structures when untreated and often referred to as “the vine that ate the south”.

==Taxonomy==
The Latin specific epithet &quot;montana&quot; refers to mountains or coming from mountains.

==Uses==
Kudzu has been referred to as a &quot;quasi-wild&quot; species, since it has been farmed and selectively bred by humans for millennia in its native range, but cultivated strains have never become isolated from wild populations, resulting in repeated interchanges between wild and farmed kudzu. As a result, the gene pool of kudzu is diverse, vigorous, and strongly influenced by the plant&#x27;s relationship with humans. The main uses of kudzu are for food, for fiber, and as a medicinal plant; it is also used to make paper, for basketry, and as a food source for livestock.

The starchy root of kudzu has been used for food in China since before 540 CE, with specific cultivars bred for this purpose, and often sustained Chinese people during famines that occurred throughout history. Kudzu starch is used as a thickening or gelling agent similar to arrowroot, tapioca or potato starch, and has many alleged benefits as a health food. Kudzu is still utilized for food in China, Japan, and Korea. Kudzu starch is an important component of many Japanese confections and sweets, valued for its ability to set firmly with a fine, translucent appearance. It is also turned into flour and can be used to make noodles. Kudzu is furthermore considered an important medicinal plant, and is sometimes sold as a supplement in health food stores.

Kudzu cloth is called &quot;ko-pu&quot; and archaeological records indicate that ko-pu was used in China at least 6,000 years ago. From the Zhou dynasty to the early twentieth century, kudzu was one of three major textile materials used in China, with the others being silk and ramie. Kudzu textiles were inexpensive and widespread, and formed such a major part of commerce that the Zhou dynasty had a specific office for dealing with kudzu-related affairs. In Japan, the earliest evidence for kudzu cloth dates back to 300-538 CE, and it continued to be used into the Edo period. Kudzu fiber is a bast fiber, like linen or hemp. To obtain the bast fibers, the new young vines are harvested in summer and boiled, then left to be fermented by the action of naturally occurring bacteria in mounds of grass until the outer bark becomes slimy and can be washed off in running water.

In 2023, kudzu was used to develop a biodegradable alternative to plastic food packaging.

==Invasive species==
The natural range of &quot;Pueraria montana&quot; can be found in India, Myanmar, Indochina, China, Korea, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, the Pacific Islands, and in north Australia. In its native habitat, it and its closely related species occur across wide areas; the species have diverged genetically due to vicariance. Its invasiveness can be attributed to similarities between both native and newly invaded niches, effectively expanding its habitable range into areas with climates it may not be able to endure otherwise.

Some researchers argue that, because of the close relationship shared between kudzu and humans since the Neolithic, human harvesting is the main ecological control mechanism that keeps kudzu in check in its natural range. In Eastern Asia, where kudzu is a valuable plant with many benefits to humans, many millennia of human selection and cultivation have facilitated the spread of the plant to new areas and resulted in a broad, adaptable gene pool. However, although humans have provided benefits to kudzu, harvesting the vines and roots regularly would decrease the plant&#x27;s competitiveness and aggressive growth, meaning humans have essentially served as a biological control for kudzu.

Like other exotic species, the introduction to other areas is due to human actions. Seeds are spread by mammals and birds. Kudzu are plants adapted to drought. Only above ground portions are damaged by frost; thick storage roots grow as deep as 1 metre. It forms new perennial root crowns from stem nodes touching the ground.

The ecological requirements of the species are those of the subtropical and temperate habitat areas.

In Europe, &quot;Pueraria montana&quot; grows in several places in the warm regions of Switzerland and Italy near Lake Maggiore and Lake Lugano.

During World War II, kudzu was introduced to Vanuatu and Fiji by United States Armed Forces to serve as camouflage for equipment. It is now a major weed there.

&quot;Pueraria montana&quot; is also becoming a problem in Queensland.

In the United States, &quot;Pueraria montana&quot; is extensively reported in the coastal states from eastern Texas to Florida, North to Maryland, as well as inland in Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Washington, D.C., and West Virginia. Since 2004, Kudzu has moved farther North along the Ohio River, appearing in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. Of all affected states, three in the southeast have the heaviest infestations: Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.

== Effects on biodiversity ==

Due to the aggressive, climbing nature of &quot;P. montana&quot; it often causes shading and death of native vegetation, resulting in a monoculture of &quot;P. montana.&quot; As &quot;P. montana&quot; spreads, it shades and crushes its competitors with its weight, eliminating everything in its path. As a result of growing over native plants and trees, it blocks their access of vital resources such as sunlight, killing off young vegetation. These result in dramatic reductions in native biodiversity at the local level.

Other than the loss of biodiversity of plant species, &quot;P. montana&quot; may have a negative effect on animals. Many plant species that are suppressed by &quot;P. montana&quot; because of its uncontrolled and rapid growth negatively impacts some wildlife animals that have specific mutualisms or feeding relationships with these plant species. This potentially could lead to the death of certain animal species, specifically herbivores, that depend on some vegetation as a resource for both food and shelter. These are important factors that lead to habitat destruction and reduction in animal biodiversity.

== Impacts of global changes ==
Changes in the global environment such as higher CO2 levels, higher temperatures, greater rates of nitrogen deposition, and greater fragmentation of natural habitats are predicted to increase the spread of &quot;P. montana&quot;.

=== Carbon dioxide ===
Kudzu is highly responsive to increased CO2 levels as it results in maximal leaf expansion, increase in leaf size, and an overall 12% increase in leaf production. In turn, the plant has higher turgor pressure which results in the improvements in its growth potential. As the atmospheric CO2 concentration continues to rise, it is possible for the potential enhancement of &quot;P. montana&quot;’s invasiveness.

=== Temperature ===
With global warming, overnight temperatures tend to increase. Data collected in the United States over the past few decades showed a reduction in frost days, an earlier date for the last freeze in spring, and a later date for the first freeze in fall. These favour the spread of  &quot;P. montana&quot;.  

The northward distribution of &quot;P. montana&quot; is hypothesized to be limited by low temperatures. Cold temperatures cause their leaves to be killed off and their leaf expansion to be lagged. However, with the continuous rise in global temperature, it is predicted that &quot;P. montana&quot; will rapidly spread northward as a result of the increased number of warmer days.

<text>Centaurea () is a genus of over 700 species of herbaceous thistle-like flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Members of the genus are found only north of the equator, mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere; the Middle East and surrounding regions are particularly species-rich.

==Common names==
Common names for this genus are centaury, centory, starthistles, knapweeds, centaureas and the more ambiguous &quot;bluets&quot;; a vernacular name used for these plants in parts of England is &quot;loggerheads&quot; (common knapweed). The &quot;Plectocephalus&quot; group – possibly a distinct genus – is known as basketflowers. &quot;Cornflower&quot; is used for a few species, but that term more often specifically means either &quot;C. cyanus&quot; (the annual cornflower) or &quot;Centaurea montana&quot; (the perennial cornflower). The common name &quot;centaury&quot; is sometimes used, although this also refers to the unrelated plant genus &quot;Centaurium&quot;.

The name is said to be in reference to Chiron, the centaur of Greek mythology who discovered medicinal uses of a plant eventually called &quot;centaury&quot;.

==Description==
Knapweeds are robust weedy plants. Their leaves, spiny in some species, are usually deeply divided into elongated lobes at least in the plants&#x27; lower part, becoming entire towards the top. The &quot;flowers&quot; (actually pseudanthium inflorescences) are diverse in colour, ranging from intense blues, reds and yellows to any mixture of these and lighter shades towards white. Often, the disk flowers are much darker or lighter than the ray flowers, which also differ in morphology and are sterile. Each pseudanthium sits atop a cup- or basket-like cluster of scaly bracts, hence the name &quot;basketflowers&quot;. Many species, in particular those inhabiting more arid regions, have a long and strong taproot.

==Ecology==
Certain knapweeds have a tendency to dominate large stretches of landscape together with a few other plants, typically one or two grasses and as many other large herbaceous plants. The common knapweed (&quot;C. nigra&quot;) for example is plentiful in the mesotrophic grasslands of England and nearby regions. It is most prominently found in pastures or meadows dominated by cock&#x27;s-foot (&quot;Dactylis glomerata&quot;) as well as either of crested dog&#x27;s-tail (&quot;Cynosurus cristatus&quot;) and false oat-grass (&quot;Arrhenatherum elatius&quot;). It is also often found in mesotrophic grassland on rendzinas and similar calcareous soils in association with glaucous sedge (&quot;Carex flacca&quot;), sheep&#x27;s fescue (&quot;Festuca ovina&quot;), and either tor-grass (&quot;Brachypodium pinnatum&quot;) and rough hawkbit (&quot;Leontodon hispidus&quot;), or upright brome (&quot;Bromus erectus&quot;). In these grasslands, greater knapweed (&quot;C. scabiosa&quot;) is found much more rarely by comparison, often in association with red fescue (&quot;Festuca rubra&quot;) in addition to cock&#x27;s-foot and false oat-grass.

Due to their habit of dominating ecosystems under good conditions, many &quot;Centaurea&quot; species can become invasive weeds in regions where they are not native. In parts of North America, diffuse knapweed (&quot;C. diffusa&quot;), spotted knapweed (&quot;C. maculosa&quot;) and yellow starthistle (&quot;C. solstitialis&quot;) cause severe problems in agriculture due to their uncontrolled spread. The seeds are typically transported by human traffic, in particular the tires of all-terrain vehicles. The two knapweeds are harmful mainly because they are strongly allelopathic, producing powerful toxins in their roots that stunt the growth of plants around them not adapted to this. Yellow starthistle, meanwhile, is inedible to most livestock due to its spines and apparently outright poisonous to horses and other equines. However, efficient methods of biological control by insect pests of these weeds have been developed; the knapweeds can also exploited to their detriment by targeted grazing. Controlled burning may also be used, though the timing is important to avoid the plants having seeded already, and neither allowing sufficient time for them to regrow from the rootstock.

Yet other species of &quot;Centaurea&quot; – mostly ones that occur between Italy and the Caucasus – are endemics of a single island or valley, and some of these are endangered. The Akamas Centaurea (&quot;Centaurea akamantis&quot;) of Cyprus is almost extinct, while the western Caucasus endemics &quot;C. leptophylla&quot; and &quot;C. straminicephala&quot; are at least very rare and &quot;C. hedgei&quot; and &quot;C. pecho&quot; from the same region are certainly not abundant either. The last four species would be adversely affected by the proposed Yusufeli Dam, which might actually destroy enough habitat to push the two rarer ones over the brink of extinction.
&quot;Centaurea&quot; are copious nectar producers, especially on high-lime soils. The high nectar yield of the genus makes it very attractive to insects such as butterflies – including the endangered Karner blue (&quot;Plebejus melissa samuelis&quot;) which visits introduced spotted knapweed – and day-flying moths – typically Zygaenidae, such as &quot;Zygaena loti&quot; or the six-spot burnet (&quot;Z. filipendulae&quot;). The larvae of some other Lepidoptera species use &quot;Centaurea&quot; species as food plants; see List of Lepidoptera that feed on &quot;Centaurea&quot;. Several of these are used in biological control of invasive knapweeds and starthistles.

Larvae of several true weevils (Curculionidae) of the subfamily Lixinae also feed on &quot;Centaurea&quot;. Some genera – such as &quot;Larinus&quot; whose larval food is flowerheads – have many species especially adapted to particular knapweeds or starthistle and are used in biological control too. These include the yellow starthistle flower weevil (&quot;L. curtus&quot;) for yellow starthistle, lesser knapweed flower weevil (&quot;L. minutus&quot;) for diffuse knapweed and blunt knapweed flower weevil (&quot;L. obtusus&quot;) for spotted knapweed. Broad-nosed seedhead weevil (&quot;Bangasternus fausti&quot;) larvae eat diffuse, spotted and squarrose knapweed (&quot;C. virgata&quot; ssp. &quot;squarrosa&quot;), while those of the yellow starthistle bud weevil (&quot;B. orientalis&quot;) do not seem to live on anything other than yellow starthistle and occasionally purple starthistle (&quot;C. calcitrapa&quot;). But perhaps most efficient in destroying developing yellow starthistle seedheads is the larva of the yellow starthistle hairy weevil (&quot;Eustenopus villosus&quot;). Knapweed root weevil (&quot;Cyphocleonus achates&quot;) larvae bore into the roots of spotted and to a lesser extentely diffuse knapweed, sometimes killing off the entire plant.

Also used in biological control are Tephritidae (peacock flies) whose larvae feed on &quot;Centaurea&quot;. Knapweed peacock fly (&quot;Chaetorellia acrolophi&quot;) larvae eat spotted knapweed and some other species. The yellow starthistle peacock fly (&quot;C. australis&quot;) has an initial generation each year which often uses cornflower (&quot;C. cyanus&quot;) as larval food; later generations switch to yellow starthistle. The flies are generally considered less efficient in destroying the growing seedheads than the weevils, but may be superior under certain conditions; employing flies and weevils in combination is expensive and does not noticeably increase their effect.

==Use by humans==
Despite the negative agricultural and environmental impacts of the more aggressive Centaurea species, there are many ways in which they benefit humans as well. For instance, due to their moderate to high nectar production, which can occur over a comparatively long duration, many species of &quot;Centaurea&quot; are popular food sources for insects that may otherwise attack certain crops. It may be advisable for some types of farms to allow certain Centaurea species, such as cornflower (&quot;C. cyanus&quot;) in a European setting, to grow adjacent to fields. These areas are known as beetle banks, though they support and attract a diversity of beneficial life beyond beetles. When certain Centaurea species are present, some pests may be drawn away from crops, and predatory insects and arachnids that feed upon pest insects will be better-supported by these more naturalized areas. They additionally have the beneficial aspect of supporting pollinators, unlike many field crops such as maize. Moreover, being untreated with pesticides and providing more diversity, plants growing in more wild areas adjacent to farms produce more insects that attract and support birds which can also feed on pests that would harm crops. Insect production is especially high for beetle banks that have enough plants that serve in the role of host plant for immature insects, rather than just in the roles of adult food and/or shelter provision.

Some plants which are considered invasive or problematic in certain areas can have beneficial qualities that outweigh their negative qualities from a human and/or human agricultural point of view, although this sometimes requires some human management – particularly if adequate biological control has not been established for the more aggressive species. An example is wild parsnip, &quot;Pastinaca sativa&quot;, which produces florets that feed predatory (and other beneficial) insects as well as large tubular stems that provide winter shelter for native bees, wasps, and other organisms that can be beneficial for agriculture. The plant is considered invasive in some areas of the United States and is also often considered undesirable due to its ability to cause contact skin irritation. However, it also serves as a host plant for the black swallowtail butterfly, helps to bring nutrients up from soils with its deep taproot, and possesses evergreen foliage even in climate zones such as US zone 6. This foliage increases soil warmth and moisture which can be beneficial for certain types of life. Perhaps the most dramatic example of a generally disliked plant&#x27;s beneficial qualities being usually overlooked is the often-despised ragwort, &quot;Jacobaea vulgaris&quot;, which topped the list by a large amount for nectar production in a UK study, with a production per floral unit of (2921 ± 448μg). This very high nectar production, coupled with its early blooming period, makes the plant helpful for the establishment of bee colonies in spring — a period that is often not well-served by commercial flower meadow seed mixes. It also has the situationally-beneficial quality of being a spring ephemeral, as well as an annual that lacks difficult-to-combat roots. Plants that provide necessary structural supports for invertebrate and small vertebrate predators can help to keep overall pest populations low.
The abundant nectar produced by &quot;C. solstitialis&quot; flowers attracts many pollinators. This is another reason for the success of the (situationally) highly invasive species. Due to genetic differences related to evolutionary adaption, not all members of &quot;Centaurea&quot; produce the same amount of nectar. Growing conditions, such as climate and soil, can have a very strong impact, even if the plants grow and flower. For instance, cornflower plants, &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot;, produced 33% less seasonal nectar than &quot;Centaurea nigra&quot; in a UK study. &quot;C. nigra&quot; also ranked higher than ragwort in another UK study, although ragwort was still in the top 10 for yearly nectar production. The strong nectar production of certain members of the genus can be exploited to the farmer&#x27;s advantage, possibly in combination with biological control. In particular, the yellow starthistle (&quot;C. solstitialis&quot;) as well as spotted knapweed (&quot;C. maculosa&quot;) are major honey plants for beekeepers. Monofloral honey from these plants is light and slightly tangy, and one of the finest honeys produced in the United States – due to its better availability, it is even fraudulently relabeled and sold as the scarce and expensive sourwood honey of the Appalachian Mountains. Placing beehives near stands of &quot;Centaurea&quot; will cause increased pollination. As most seedheads fail however when biocontrol pests have established themselves, the plants will bloom ever more abundantly in an attempt to replace the destroyed seedheads, to the point where they exhaust their resources in providing food for the pests (seeds), bees (pollen) and humans (honey). Output of allelopathic compounds is also liable to be reduced under such conditions – the plant has to compromise between allocating energy to reproduction and defense. This renders the weeds more likely to be suppressed by native vegetation or crops in the following years, especially if properly timed controlled burning and/or targeted grazing by suitable livestock are also employed. While yellow starthistle and perhaps other species are toxic to equines, some other livestock may eat the non-spiny knapweeds with relish. In Europe, common knapweed (&quot;C. nigra&quot;) and globe knapweed (&quot;C. macrocephala&quot;) are locally important pollen sources for honeybees in mid-late summer.

8-Hydroxyquinoline has been identified as a main allelopathic compound produced by diffuse knapweed (&quot;C. diffusa&quot;); native North American plants are typically sensitive to it, while those of Eastern Europe and Asia Minor usually have coevolved with the knapweed and are little harmed if at all, aided by native microorganisms that break down or even feed on the abundantly secreted compound. Thus, 8-hydroxyquinoline is potentially useful to control American plants that have become invasive weeds in the diffuse knapweed&#x27;s native range.
Arctiin, found in &quot;C. imperialis&quot;, has shown anticancer activity in laboratory studies. The roots of the long-lost &quot;C. foliosa&quot;, an endemic of Hatay Province (Turkey), are used in folk medicine, and other species are presumably too. A South Italian variety of the purple starthistle (&quot;C. calcitrapa&quot;) is traditionally consumed by ethnic Albanians (Arbëreshë people) in the Vulture area (southern Italy); e.g. in the Arbëreshë communities in Lucania the young whorls of &quot;C. calcitrapa&quot; are boiled and fried in mixtures with other weedy non-cultivated greens. According to research by the Michael Heinrich group at the Centre for Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy (School of Pharmacy, University of London) &quot;the antioxidant activity [...] of the young whorls of &quot;Centaurea calcitrapa&quot;, both in the DPPH and in the lipid peroxidation inhibition assays, [is] very interesting and [the] species should be investigated phytochemically and biochemically focusing on these properties&quot;. Extracts from &quot;C. calcitrapa&quot; were furthermore found to have significant xanthine oxidase (XO)-inhibiting activity.

Spotted knapweed as well as other species are rich in cnicin, a bitter compound found mainly in the leaves and often used to flavor the digestif amaro. In western Crete, Greece a local variety of &quot;C. calcitrapa&quot; called &#x27; ( &quot;little pig&quot;) also has its leaves eaten boiled by the locals. In the same island an endemic local species, &quot;C. idaea&quot; called &#x27; (), &#x27; () or &#x27; (), has its leaves eaten boiled by the locals too.
Some species are cultivated as ornamental plants in gardens. As regards other aspects of popular culture, cornflower (&quot;C. cyanus&quot;) is the floral emblem of Östergötland province (Sweden) – where is it called &quot;blåklint&quot;, literally &quot;blue mountain&quot; – and of Päijänne Tavastia region in Finland, where it is known as &quot;ruiskaunokki&quot; (&quot;rye-beaks&quot;) or &quot;ruiskukka&quot; (&quot;rye-flower&quot;). It is also the national flower of Estonia where its local name &quot;rukkilill&quot; means &quot;rye-lily&quot;, Belarus where it is called &quot;vałoška&quot; (), and one of those of Germany where it is called &quot;Kornblume&quot; (&quot;cornflower&quot;). The origin of the name &quot;caltrop&quot; for the ancient low-tech area denial weapon is probably in some way connected with &quot;C. calcitrapa&quot; and its spiny seeds. This plant is attested to by the colloquial name &quot;caltrop&quot; at a time when the weapons were still called by their Roman name &quot;tribulus&quot;. Lastly, the color cornflower blue is named after &quot;C. cyanus&quot;. Cornflower is also used as a cut flower.

==Systematics and taxonomy==

As namesake member of the subtribe Centaureinae of tribe Cardueae, the knapweeds are probably most closely related to genera such as &quot;Carthamus&quot; (distaff thistles), &quot;Cnicus&quot; (blessed thistle), &quot;Crupina&quot; (crupinas) or &quot;Notobasis&quot; (Syrian thistle), and somewhat less closely to most other thistles. The monotypic &quot;Cnicus&quot; seems in fact to properly belong in &quot;Centaurea&quot;.

Research in the late 20th century shows that &quot;Centaurea&quot; as traditionally defined is polyphyletic. A number of 19th- and 20th-century efforts to reorganize the genus were not successful, and it is not yet clear what the consequences of the recent research will be for classification of this genus and other related genera. The type species &quot;C. centaurium&quot; stands somewhat apart from the main lineage of knapweeds and thus the taxonomic consequences of a rearrangement might be severe, with hundreds of species needing to be moved to new genera. It has thus been proposed to change the type species to one of the main lineages to avoid this problem. What seems certain however is that the basketflowers – presently treated as a section &quot;Plectocephalus&quot; – will be reinstated as a distinct genus in the near future. The rock-centauries (&quot;Cheirolophus&quot;), formerly usually included in &quot;Centaurea&quot;, are now already treated as separate genus.

<text>Flushing Meadows (1965) is an American short film by Joseph Cornell with Larry Jordan. The film is 8 minutes long, in color, 16mm, and silent.

The film is an ode to the memory of Joyce Hunter, a Queens waitress Cornell met in 1962. Cornell apparently had an infatuation with Hunter even though she was found to have stolen items and attempted to fence them; Cornell never pressed charges against her.

Hunter was murdered in December 1964. The film was produced after her death and is largely a series of scenes from Flushing Cemetery, where Hunter was buried.

The film was first shown publicly at the Gramercy Theatre in New York City, on December 22, 2003. The short aired twice at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival, in commemoration of the centennial of Cornell&#x27;s birth.

<text>Flushing Meadows–Corona Park (often referred to as Flushing Meadows Park or simply Flushing Meadows) is a public park in the northern part of Queens in New York City, New York, U.S. It is bounded by I-678 (Van Wyck Expressway) on the east, Grand Central Parkway on the west, Flushing Bay on the north, and Union Turnpike on the south. Flushing Meadows–Corona Park is the fourth-largest public park in New York City, with a total area of .

Until the 19th century, the site consisted of wetlands straddling the Flushing River, which traverses the region from north to south. Starting in the first decade of the 20th century, it was used as a dumping ground for ashes, since at the time, the land was so far away from the developed parts of New York City as to be considered almost worthless. New York City Parks Commissioner Robert Moses first conceived the idea of developing a large park in Flushing Meadow in the 1920s as part of a system of parks across eastern Queens. Flushing Meadows–Corona Park was created as the site of the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair and also hosted the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Following the 1964 fair, the park fell into disrepair, although some improvements have taken place since the 1990s and 2000s.

Flushing Meadows–Corona Park retains much of the layout from the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair. Its attractions include the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, the venue for the US Open tennis tournament; Citi Field, the home of the New York Mets baseball team; Etihad Park, the home of soccer team New York City FC; the New York Hall of Science; the Queens Museum; the Queens Theatre in the Park; the Queens Zoo; the Unisphere; and the New York State Pavilion. It formerly contained Shea Stadium, demolished in 2009. The Flushing River continues to run through the park, and two large lakes called Meadow and Willow Lakes take up much of the park&#x27;s area south of the Long Island Expressway.

Flushing Meadows–Corona Park is owned and maintained by New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, also known as NYC Parks. Private, non-profit groups such as the Flushing Meadows–Corona Park Conservancy and the Alliance for Flushing Meadows–Corona Park provide additional funds, services, and support. The park is at the eastern edge of the area encompassed by Queens Community Board 4.

==Etymology==

The park is named after the nearby neighborhoods of Flushing and Corona, which are separated by the park. The name &quot;Flushing&quot; is a corruption of the port town of Vlissingen in the Netherlands. By the 19th century, the word &quot;flushing&quot; had become associated with &quot;a cleansing by rushing water&quot;. &quot;Corona&quot; was added to the name during the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

==History==
===Early years===
During at least three glacial periods, including the Wisconsin glaciation around 20,000 years ago, ice sheets advanced south across North America carving moraines, valleys, and hills. In particular, bays and estuaries were formed along the north shore of Long Island. During glaciation, what is now Flushing Meadows Park was formed just north of the terminal moraine that runs across Long Island, which consisted of sand, gravel, clay and boulders. The moraine created a drainage divide, with rivers north of the moraine such as the future Flushing River emptying into the north shore. The Flushing Meadows site became a glacial lake, and then a salt marsh after the ice melted. Prior to glaciation, the Flushing River valley was used by the Hudson River to drain southward into the Atlantic Ocean. Through the 19th century, the site continued to consist of wetlands straddling Flushing River. Species inhabiting the site included waterfowl and fiddler crab, with fish using water pools for spawning.

The area was first settled by Algonquian Native Americans of Long Island (referred to erroneously as &quot;Mantinecocks&quot;). They consisted of the &quot;Canarsee&quot; and &quot;Rockaway&quot; Lenape groups, which inhabited coastal wetlands across Queens and Brooklyn. Beginning in 1640, Dutch settlers moved into the area, establishing the town of Newtown to the west of the site (which would become Elmhurst, Corona, and other areas in western Queens), and the town of Flushing to the east. The meadows became known as the Corona Meadows. By 1666, the Native American population had been displaced from the Flushing Meadows site by European settlers, although a deed reserved the right to hunt on the land for the Native Americans. Several wealthy landowners began building farmhouses on the site in the mid-to-late 17th century. The meadows provided numerous natural resources for settlers, including timber, water, fertile soil, and grass and hay for grazing domestic animals. During the American Revolution, a farmhouse on the site of the modern World&#x27;s Fair Marina was used as a headquarters for British forces.

By the 1800s, primitive roads were established crossing the meadows, running along what are now Northern Boulevard and the Long Island Expressway. Several railroads were also laid through the site, including lines of the Flushing and North Side Railroad (today&#x27;s LIRR Port Washington Branch and the defunct Whitestone Branch). Shortly after the American Civil War, the meadows became a waterfront resort due to its natural beauty, and affluent New Yorkers constructed homes in the area. British saloon-keeper Harry Hill built the Flushing Bay Hotel and Pavilion on the future marina site.

===Filling and use as a dumping ground===
Around 1907, contractor Michael Degnon, whose firm constructed the Williamsburg Bridge, the Cape Cod Canal, and the Steinway subway tunnel (used by today&#x27;s ), purchased large tracts of marsh near Flushing Creek. At the time, the land was considered &quot;all but worthless&quot;. Degnon envisioned using the site to create a large industrial port around Flushing Bay, similar to a terminal he developed in Long Island City. By 1911, Degnon had created a plan along with the United States Department of War and the Queens Topographical Bureau. The plan envisioned widening Flushing River and creating docks for ships, with numerous factories and freight facilities. Meanwhile, the residential areas of Corona were expected to become the primary residence for factory workers.

To create the port, beginning in 1910 Degnon proceeded to fill the land using household coal ash and street sweepings from Brooklyn. Degnon set up two companies of his own, one of which was contracted with the New York City Department of Sanitation. He also contracted the Brooklyn Ash Removal Company, owned by Fishhooks McCarthy, a member of the corrupt Tammany Hall political machine. Residential ash was collected via trolleys of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, and loaded onto freight trains which traveled via the Long Island Rail Road branches, or other trolleys, which hauled the refuse to Corona. The operation was referred to as a citywide refuse &quot;conveyor belt&quot;, while the trains were nicknamed the &quot;Talcum Powder Express&quot; because they often ran uncovered and deposited soot onto the surroundings. The northern end of the site was filled via now-conventional means, using dirt pumped from Flushing Bay which was being dredged to a lower depth. Material from the bay was extracted by an offshore hydraulic machine, and funneled through a pipe across Northern Boulevard, before being deposited onto the wetlands. The filling for the north meadow was complete in 1916.

The prospect of creating a port was halted in 1917 by material restrictions caused by World War I, and a lack of federal support for the project. Industrial activities in the borough were fulfilled by existing terminals in Long Island City, Maspeth, Flushing, and College Point. Dumping of ash into the meadows continued, however, fueled by the increased use of garbage incinerators in the city. The area became known as the Corona Dump or Corona Ash Dumps. During nearly 30 years of filling, around 50 million cubic yards of ash and waste were dumped onto the meadows site. One particular mound of ash rose high and was called &quot;Mount Corona&quot;. Other mounds rose high. The average thickness of the ash was .

The dumps drew the ire of local residents, due to strong odors and being deemed unsightly, along with increasing rat infestations in the local neighborhoods. Much of the &quot;street sweepings&quot; collected consisted of horse manure from horse-drawn carriages. In addition, many residents simply threw out normal garbage along with the coal ashes. The meadows were also considered one of the worst breeding grounds for mosquitoes in the city. The dump was famously characterized as &quot;a valley of ashes&quot; in F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. Fitzgerald meanwhile described the Flushing River, now polluted from the dumps, as &quot;a small foul river&quot;. The dumps and garbage trains were accused of facilitating a polio outbreak in Corona in 1916. The Brooklyn Ash Removal Company was brought to court by local residents in 1923 for &quot;violation of the sanitary code&quot; due to the smoke emitted from the dumps. As a minor concession, the company opened the Corona Park Golf and Country Club in 1931, on a tract near Nassau Boulevard (today&#x27;s Long Island Expressway). When Etihad Park was built for Major League Soccer team New York City FC, &quot;The Valley of Ashes&quot; became one of the stadium&#x27;s nicknames because of its proximity to the dump&#x27;s site.

===Park planning and World&#x27;s Fairs===
====1939–1940 Fair and aftermath====
New York City Parks Commissioner Robert Moses first conceived the idea of developing a large park in Flushing Meadow in the 1920s. At the time, he envisioned the site to become a &quot;true &#x27;Central Park&#x27;&quot;, especially with much of city population moving to Queens and Long Island due to urban sprawl. Moses also planned Flushing Meadows to be the westernmost of a chain of parks running across Queens, which would include Kissena Park, Cunningham Park, Alley Pond Park, and Douglaston Park. In 1929, representatives from surrounding communities created a plan to turn the ash dump into a recreational complex, and presented them to Queens Borough President George U. Harvey.

In 1930, Moses released plans for numerous parks and highways in the city. This included the Grand Central Parkway, the construction of which would require taking land from the ash dumps. One of the provisional projects listed was a &quot;Flushing River Park&quot;, along with a &quot;Flushing River Parkway&quot;. The Brooklyn Ash Removal Company&#x27;s contract with the city expired in 1933, and the city took over the company&#x27;s assets and operations on May 25, 1934. The Brooklyn Ash property occupied around of the site, north of what is now the Long Island Expressway. The remainder of the meadows still contained natural wildlife. It was frequented by fur trappers, local residents collecting firewood and growing vegetables, and later, squatters during the Great Depression. Areas of the dumps were also used for growing vegetables, with the soil fertilized by the garbage and manure.

In 1935, the site, now planned as &quot;Flushing Meadow Park&quot;, was selected for what would become the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair. In addition to the ash dumps and undeveloped meadows, houses in Corona east of 111th Street, adjacent to the dumps, were condemned and added to the site, displacing residents. The plans were drafted by Parks Department landscape architect Gilmore David Clarke and his partner Michael Rapuano, designed in Beaux-Arts style. Work on the World&#x27;s Fair site began on June 16, 1936. The project primarily involved leveling the ash mounds, with the leftover material used to fill other areas of the meadow. Two sites were excavated to create Meadow and Willow Lake, while much of the Flushing River was diverted into underground culverts. A floodgate was built to prevent tidal flow from flooding the lakes. In addition to recreation, the lakes would serve as repositories for excess storm runoff. The dirt from the lake sites was used as additional topsoil for the park. The project was an around-the-clock job, with 450 workers operating on three daily shifts. Workers had to combat the effects of high tide, and dust storms created by the ash. The work significantly changed the topography of the meadows, differing from that created by glaciation. Thousands of trees were transplanted to the fair site in order to create a natural landscape. Meanwhile, thousands of Douglas fir timbers were driven into the ground to act as pilings for the foundations of the fair structures. The pedestrian plan called for numerous wide tree-lined pathways, including a central &quot;Cascade Mall&quot; leading to the Trylon and Perisphere, many of which would be retained for the park.

Faced with having to dispose of the mountains of ashes, Moses incorporated a significant portion of the refuse into the bases of several roadways that bordered or bisected the park. This included the Van Wyck Expressway (Interstate 678) running along the eastern side of the park, the nearby Interboro Parkway (now Jackie Robinson Parkway), and the Long Island Expressway (Interstate 495) that divides the park into north and south halves. The Grand Central Parkway separates a western lobe from the main part of the northern half, while the east-west Jewel Avenue bisects the southern half. The success of the Flushing Meadows site as a garbage dump-turned-park led Moses and the city to develop other wetlands in the city into parks via short-term refuse landfilling. This process was used to create Marine Park and Spring Creek Park in Brooklyn, and Ferry Point Park in the Bronx. This was also the original plan for the Fresh Kills and Edgemere landfills, which remained open past their expected tenure and became large and long-term municipal waste sites. The Fresh Kills site was developed into Freshkills Park in the early 21st century.

In November 1939, a water main running through Flushing Meadows Park to supply water to Flushing failed. Unlike the fair buildings, the pipeline was not built on piling foundations and eventually sank into the marsh and landfill. In January 1940, Borough President Harvey demanded an investigation into the main&#x27;s construction take place, while the Board of Estimate allocated $50,200 for repairs. Following the closure of the Fair in 1940, the site was supposed to be cleared in order to develop and open Flushing Meadows as a city park. The onset of World War II, however, delayed the project. The profits from the World&#x27;s Fair were supposed to pay for the development of the park, but in spite of its success the fair turned a financial loss. Only two permanent attractions were opened in 1941: an ice skating rink and roller rink in the New York City Building, and a public pool located in the New York State Marine Amphitheatre (now demolished). The latter utilized the pool used for &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Aquacade&quot; during the fair.

In the meantime, some of the buildings from the 1939 Fair were used for the first temporary headquarters of the United Nations beginning in 1946. The former New York City Building was used for the UN General Assembly during this time. Moses attempted to sell Flushing Meadows as a permanent headquarters for the UN, which would have required new structures and a complete redesign of the fair ground layout. The proposal was rejected however, due to concerns over the strength of the former marshland for building construction, the lack of &quot;scenic beauty&quot; in the meadows, and the distance from Manhattan. The UN moved to their now-permanent headquarters in 1951. The New York City building was later refurbished for the 1964/1965 Fair as the New York City Pavilion, featuring the &quot;Panorama of the City of New York&quot;, an enormous scale model of the entire city. It is one of two buildings that survive from the 1939/40 Fair, and the only one that remains in its original location. (The other is the Belgium exhibition building, disassembled and moved to the campus of Virginia Union University in 1941.) It is now the home of the Queens Museum of Art, which still houses, and occasionally updates, the &quot;Panorama&quot;. The remainder of the park, meanwhile, had fallen into disrepair, with wild animals moving back into the area. Only minor upgrades to the park occurred during this time.

====1964–1965 Fair====

The Flushing Meadows site was selected in 1959 as the site of the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair. Gilmore D. Clarke and Michael Rapuano were retained to tailor the original 1939 park layout for the new fair. Three structures were retained from the 1939 Fair. Meanwhile, several new structures and attractions were built for the 1964 fair, including the Unisphere, Shea Stadium, the New York Hall of Science, and Queens Botanical Garden. The Unisphere, built as the theme symbol for the 1964/1965 World&#x27;s Fair, has since become the main sculptural feature of the park. It stands on the site occupied by the Perisphere during the earlier Fair. The Van Wyck Expressway was extended north through the park site along the right-of-way of the former World&#x27;s Fair Railroad. Moses and the Parks Department also prepared post-fair plans to finish Flushing Meadows Park, as well as Kissena Corridor Park and Kissena Park, projected to be complete by 1967.

In early 1964, the New York City Council added &quot;Corona&quot; to the park&#x27;s name; the park was now named &quot;Flushing Meadows–Corona Park&quot;, in preparation for that year&#x27;s World&#x27;s Fair. Councilman Edward Sadowsky explained that this was intended to correct an injustice: &quot;The people of Corona have long lived in the aroma of a junkyard or a dump named for their community. Now, when there is something beautiful to be seen, there is no mention of the name Corona.&quot; Following the fair, most buildings from the fair were demolished. Some were relocated, such as the Wisconsin Pavilion, Uniroyal Giant Tire, and Golden Rondelle Theater, while others remained in the park, such as the Unisphere, Hall of Science, New York State Pavilion, and United States Pavilion. Most of the remaining $11.6 million from the fair funds, as well as money from Moses&#x27; Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, were used to rehabilitate the site into a true park. City officials proposed repurposing the site as a &quot;sports park&quot; in 1966; ultimately, the Parks Department took back ownership of the site, which opened on June 3, 1967.

===Late 20th century===

Although the park was opened, it had yet to become the grand park Moses had originally envisioned. In August 1967, new parks commissioner August Heckscher II sought to begin improvements on the park in order to turn it into the &quot;Central Park of the 20th century&quot;. A new plan for the park had been designed by architects Marcel Breuer and Kenzō Tange, but the project did not receive funds due to communication issues with the New York City Comptroller&#x27;s office. By 1972, little development had taken place to improve the park, while many World&#x27;s Fair structures remained in disrepair. The disrepair was systematic within the park system, a product of lack of funding during that decade&#x27;s fiscal crisis. This state of disrepair continued into the 1980s.

In 1975, a group of traditionalist Catholics started to assemble at the old Vatican Pavilion exedra monument of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair to have evening rosary prayer vigils, having been obligated to relocate from Bayside, Queens. This was led by a woman named Veronica Lueken who claimed she was experiencing visions there of the Virgin Mary, and giving out supposed messages from heaven, frequently apocalyptic in nature. At its height in the late 20th century, thousands of people attended the nightly events, held on different feast days. One event in June 1983 attracted fifteen thousand pilgrims. Despite the events&#x27; popularity, Bishop Francis Mugavero, then Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, stated in a 1986 &quot;Declaration Concerning the Bayside Movement&quot; that the events lacked credibility. After Lueken&#x27;s death in 1995, and her husband&#x27;s death in 2002, their followers divided into two small camps that continued to visit the park for vigils.

Additionally, in 1978, the US Open tennis tournament was moved from the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills to Flushing Meadows Corona Park. The tournament was originally held in the Singer Bowl stadium (renamed the Louis Armstrong Stadium), a 1964 World&#x27;s Fair structure which was renovated and expanded for the tournament. Other parts of the park were also repaired or expanded for the tournament, including the fountains of the Unisphere.

Arne Abramowitz became administrator of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in 1986 and soon began planning a renovation of the park. The following year, NYC Parks announced an $80 million rehabilitation of the park. The renovation had been planned since the early 1980s but had been deferred due to a lack of funding. The grounds of the park&#x27;s northern section were landscaped in 1992, and the restoration of the Unisphere was completed in May 1994. By the mid-1990s, NYC Parks was planning to spend another $19 million to rebuild fountains, build a new ramp to the Willets Point Boulevard station, add three entrances and a cultural walk, and enlarge the Hall of Science. The Aquacade amphitheater, which had decayed extensively, was demolished in 1996. Arthur Ashe Stadium opened in the park in 1997, replacing a smaller stadium. In addition, mosaic medallions commemorating the World&#x27;s Fair were installed at David Dinkins Circle in 1998; it is unknown who designed the mosaics.

===Early 21st century===
By the early 2000s, NYC Parks had spent $61 million to renovate the park, including $11 million on a promenade along Flushing Bay, $7 million for turf fields, and six new playgrounds. The park had also become the residence of a number of homeless people. This fact received attention after five possibly homeless individuals abducted, raped, and threatened to kill a woman who had been sitting with her partner at the nearby Mets–Willets Point subway station.

Several improvements were made to Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in the 2000s and 2010s. The Flushing Meadows–Corona Park Conservancy was formed in 2002 to advocate for parkland in the area. The $66.3 million Flushing Meadows Corona Park Aquatics Center, encompassing an Olympic-sized public indoor pool and an NHL regulation-sized skating rink, opened in 2008. The facility is the largest recreation complex in any New York City park, at . This was followed by the opening of Citi Field, a new baseball field to replace Shea Stadium, in 2009.

Another public-private partnership, the Alliance for Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, was created in 2015. It commenced construction on, or announced plans for, several improvement projects at Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. These included a plan to restore the New York State Pavilion, as well as the construction of a &quot;mist garden&quot; in the park&#x27;s Fountains of the Fairs. Other projects included the construction of a promenade around Meadow Lake and the rehabilitation of the World&#x27;s Fair Playground and the marina. In 2015, Flushing Meadows–Corona Park also started hosting the Queens Night Market, a summertime food market that features cuisine from dozens of countries. The market became popular due to its affordability, since all food cost a maximum of $5–6. Another food festival, the World&#x27;s Fare, started in 2017 and is hosted in Citi Field&#x27;s parking lot on about the third weekend of May. Restoration of the New York State Pavilion began in 2019, as did work on the Fountains of the Fairs. The Fountains of the Fairs were dedicated in October 2020.

In early 2022, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) gave a local group, the Waterfront Alliance, a $530,000 grant to study the effects of climate change at Flushing Meadows–Corona Park after U.S. representative Grace Meng had requested the grant the previous year. The park was extremely vulnerable to flooding because of its topography and because of sea level rise caused by global warming. Climate scientists had predicted that parts of the park would be flooded regularly by the 2050s and that the entire park could be underwater by the 2080s. At the time, the city government was spending $350 million on various upgrades at the park. By mid-2023, the New York City government was considering erecting tents in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park to temporarily house asylum seekers. The park had also become popular with Queens&#x27;s large Latin-American population, who frequently played soccer there. The first phase of the New York State Pavilion&#x27;s renovation was finished in 2023, with a second phase planned to be completed in 2025. The mosaic medallions at David Dinkins Circle had become dilapidated by 2024, when NYC Parks announced plans to remove them, citing the fact that the mosaics were causing people to trip. 

====Metropolitan Park and Hard Rock Resort &amp; Casino proposal====

New York state officials announced in April 2022 that they would issue three casino licenses in Downstate New York. Following this announcement, in 2023, New York Mets owner Steven A. Cohen proposed a redevelopment of the parking lot west of Citi Field. The proposed development would be known as Metropolitan Park and would feature a 2,300 room Hard Rock Hotel–themed Integrated Resort which would include a casino. The hotel could become the largest hotel in New York City and amongst the largest hotels in the world if built. It would also include cultural amenities, restaurants, shopping, and park space. In May 2024, state senator Jessica Ramos stated she would not introduce legislation to help get the project approved. In February of 2025, the City Planning Commission voting in favor of approving zoning changes which would allow for the project to be built. The area is zoned as parkland and zoning changes are needed to allow the project to move forward. Neighboring community boards have also voted in favor of the proposed development. 

==Geography==
The layout of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park retains much of Gilmore D. Clarke and Michael Rapuano&#x27;s Beaux-Arts planning from the 1939 and 1964 World&#x27;s Fairs. Flushing Meadows–Corona Park is the fourth-largest public park in New York City. It was long believed to be in size, but a survey concluded in 2013 found its actual size to be when accounting for major roads and other exclusions within the park&#x27;s perimeter. This does not take into account a disputed claim that the neighborhood of Willets Point, along the north edge of the park, is itself part of the park.

=== Layout ===

The northern section of the park, the former fair grounds, revolves around large paved pathways which during the fairs led to focal points such as pavilions, fountains and sculptures. The Trylon and Perisphere, and later Unisphere, were placed at the main axial point. The Unisphere and Queens Museum currently sit at the west end of the main promenade. Near the center of the promenade (called Herbert Hoover Promenade on the north side, and Dwight D. Eisenhower Promenade on the south side) are the Fountains of the Fairs, which sit in the median of the paths. At the far east end is the Fountain of the Planets, originally called the Pool of Industry. This layout was used to guide fair goers to exhibits. The layout was based on Gian Lorenzo Bernini&#x27;s plan for St. Peter&#x27;s Square in Vatican City. The main promenade, measuring , was provisionally called the &quot;Cascade Mall&quot; during its construction, and later named the &quot;Constitution Mall&quot; during the first fair. Many former exhibit and pavilion sites have since been replaced with soccer fields (artificial turf or dirt and grass), while others have been left as open grass fields.

The southern portion of the park is largely occupied by Meadow and Willow Lake. The two lakes, along with the Pool of Industry and Fountain of the Planets in the former fair grounds, are fed by the Flushing River, which flows north through both lakes and underneath the fountain as a subterranean river towards Flushing Bay. The two lakes are connected by a narrow channel, forming a peninsula in between the lakes. During the 1939 Fair, Meadow Lake was temporarily named &quot;Fountain Lake&quot; and &quot;Liberty Lake&quot;. The land around Meadow Lake contains much of the park&#x27;s true &quot;parkland&quot;, with open grass, picnic and grilling areas, and baseball and cricket fields. During the fairs, the land on the north shore and part of the eastern shore of the lake was used as an amusement area, with large parking lots added on the east and west shores for the 1964 Fair. The lots were removed and converted to parkland after the 1964 Fair. The Willow Lake area of the park is a nature reserve. The area around Willow Lake originally also contained sports fields and park trails, until it was fenced off and turned into a preserve in 1976.

The park is entirely circumscribed by highways constructed by Robert Moses. Its eastern boundary is formed by the Van Wyck Expressway (I-678). The south and west ends of the park are bound by the Grand Central Parkway, with the Kew Gardens Interchange situated at the southernmost point. The northern edge of the park is bound by the expressway portion of Northern Boulevard (New York State Route 25A) which connects the Grand Central and the Whitestone Expressway. The park is bisected by the Long Island Expressway, at the approximate south end of the former Corona Ash Dumps, which separate the northern and southern halves of the park. Jewel Avenue and its interchange with the Grand Central further separate the southern section into two halves, with Meadow Lake to the north of Jewel Avenue and Willow Lake to the south. Access to the park is limited due to a lack of public transportation reaching many areas of the site, and presence of the highways at the perimeters of the park separating the site from local neighborhoods. The park also has very few formal entrances from local neighborhoods; this is a vestige of the World&#x27;s Fairs, where access was controlled.

Studies by various groups have separated the park into a different number of sections. A study by the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation divides the park into three areas: the &quot;historic core&quot; (former World&#x27;s Fair grounds), Meadow Lake, and Willow Lake. The Flushing Meadows Corona Park Strategic Framework Plan divides the park into a total of seven &quot;zones&quot;: the Marina along Flushing Bay (containing the World&#x27;s Fair Marina), the &quot;Sport Center&quot; (containing Citi Field and the USTA), &quot;West Park&quot; (a small section extending west of the Grand Central Parkway and the fair grounds, housing the New York Hall of Science and the Queens Zoo), the &quot;Recreation &amp; Garden Botanical Area&quot; (extending east of the fair grounds along the Kissena Creek corridor, housing the Queens Botanical Garden), the &quot;Historic World&#x27;s Fair Core Area&quot;, Meadow Lake, and Willow Lake.

===Hydrology and ecology===

The two lakes and the remainder of Flushing Creek are separated by a flood gate or dam called the &quot;Porpoise Bridge&quot; or &quot;Tide Gate Bridge&quot;, located just south of the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Port Washington Branch trestle, at the north end of the Flushing Meadows Golf Center. The dam only permits northward flows towards Flushing Bay to pass, while blocking south-flowing waters. As its name implies, the dam also acts as a bridge, carrying pedestrian and vehicular traffic over the creek. It measures wide and long. The lakes are fed by groundwater.

Prior to human development, Flushing Meadows was originally a tidal marsh, with Flushing Creek receiving south-flowing waters from the tides of Flushing Bay. Although the lakes were built as freshwater lakes and dammed to mitigate tidal effects, flooding continues to affect the park. The lakes are also highly eutrophic, due to nutrients such as phosphorus from the former marshland seeping into the water, leading to the death of fish in the lakes. The regular tidal action that would filter the lakes is prevented by the dam. In addition, the lakes are subject to pollution and storm runoff from the nearby highways, via pipes which feed into the lakes.

Because of its connection with Flushing Bay, several fish species native to marine habitats regularly swim into and inhabit Meadow and Willow Lakes. Fish species native to Meadow Lake include American eel, largemouth bass, northern snakehead (an invasive species), and white mullet. Willow Lake is named for the many species of willow plants which inhabit the area. Invasive phragmites, a genus of wild grasses, are also abundant. Attempts to kill the phragmites with pesticides have led to further fish kill. Numerous berry-producing trees and shrubs near Willow Lake attract several migratory bird species. The biodiversity of the lakes has been found to be much lower than other water bodies of comparable size.

==== Sports stadiums ====
Near the northern end of the park, adjacent to Willets Point is the &quot;Sport Center&quot; zone, where the US Open tennis tournament is held. In 2006, the tennis center was named USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center after professional tennis player Billie Jean King. Its center court is Arthur Ashe Stadium, and its secondary stadium court is Louis Armstrong Stadium. Citi Field, the home of the New York Mets since 2009, sits at the far north end of the park. Shea Stadium, the Mets&#x27; previous home and prior host to the New York Jets football team, once stood adjacent to the area now hosting Citi Field.

In addition to the existing stadiums, several other sports venues have been proposed for the park. In the 1950s, Flushing Meadows was one of several proposed sites for the relocation of the Brooklyn Dodgers, until the franchise moved to Los Angeles in 1958. A racing circuit to host a Formula One grand prix event was proposed for New York City, with one of the potential circuits to be built around Meadow Lake, first for the 1975 season, and later for the 1983 season. The plans were opposed by the local community and environmental groups, and the race was postponed and ultimately canceled by 1985. One of the alternate sites, the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey, would host the Meadowlands Grand Prix Champ Car event in 1984. Also in the 1980s, the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League (USFL) proposed to relocate to the park, with a new stadium to be built in Willets Point adjacent to Shea Stadium. The plans dissolved when the USFL folded in 1985. Shortly afterwards, the New York Jets rejected a plan to take over the proposed stadium. In the 2010s, a Major League Soccer stadium was proposed in the park after MLS founded New York City FC, the New York area&#x27;s second soccer team. After examining several sites in the New York area, New York City FC finally decided on building its proposed stadium in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park by 2016, deeming the park as the only viable location for a stadium. The stadium, which would have been located on the site of the Pool of Industry/Fountain of the Planets, was heavily opposed by the community, which forced the team to change its plans and play at Yankee Stadium. In November 2022, New York City and NYCFC agreed to build a 25,000-seat stadium, Etihad Park, in Willets Point adjacent to Citi Field; it is expected to be completed in 2027.

==== Recreational facilities ====
The park&#x27;s Meadow Lake contains a boat house, one of two structures that remain from the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair, the other being the Queens Museum. Rental boats are available at the boathouse for rowing and paddleboating, and Meadow Lake is also the site of rowing activities for non-profit Row New York, with teams practicing on the lake for much of the year. Meadow Lake also hosts the annual Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival in New York, and teams from New York practice in Meadow Lake during the summer months. The American Small Craft Association (TASCA) also houses a fleet of over a dozen sloop-rigged sailboats, used for teaching, racing, and recreation by the club&#x27;s members. Bicycling paths extend around Meadow Lake and connect to the Brooklyn–Queens Greenway.

The Willow Lake Trail, a nature trail around Willow Lake, was partially reopened in 2013 and is part of the Willow Lake nature preserve. The 78th Avenue gate to the lake remains shuttered and inaccessible despite being the closest gate to the subway station. The chronic lack of maintenance of this portion of the trail has led to ordinary residents to resort to clearing the trail itself. The trail is officially named the Pat Dolan Trail, commemorating the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park Conservancy&#x27;s founder.

The many recreational playing fields and playgrounds in the park are used for activities that reflect the wide ethnic mix of Queens; soccer and cricket are especially popular. New York Road Runners also hosts a weekly Open Run. as well as an annual 10K run. By the 2020s, the park had eight playgrounds and a skate park. Near the northeast corner of the park are the Flushing Meadows Corona Park Aquatics Center, which opened in 2008, and the Al Oerter Recreation Center, which also opened in 2008.

==== World&#x27;s Fair facilities ====

Some 1964 World&#x27;s Fair buildings remained in use after the fair. The Flushing Meadows Carousel, opened as part of the 1964 Fair, operates in the northwestern part of the park. The New York Hall of Science at the park&#x27;s northern corner, founded during the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair, still operates in its original location. The New York State Pavilion, constructed as the state&#x27;s exhibit hall for the same World&#x27;s Fair, sits derelict and decaying. The pavilion was repainted yellow in 2015 and underwent renovations in the 2020s. At the northern end of the New York State Pavilion is the Queens Theatre in the Park, originally the pavilion&#x27;s &quot;Theaterama&quot; attraction, which moved into its current building in 1993. Terrace on the Park, a banquet and catering facility, was originally the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair&#x27;s official helipad. The Queens Museum, which became the headquarters of the United Nations General Assembly after the 1939 Fair, was adapted as the 1964 Fair&#x27;s New York City Pavilion building. After the fair, it was subdivided into the Queens Center for Art and an ice-skating rink, the latter of which was removed when the museum was expanded in 2013.

Other buildings remained for a while after the 1964 Fair&#x27;s conclusion but were subsequently demolished. This included the Travel and Transportation Pavilion, destroyed in 1967 after a failed conversion to a fire station, and the United States Pavilion, demolished in 1977 after great deterioration. One such parcel became the site of the Playground for All Children, one of the first playgrounds designed to include handicapped-accessible activities. The design competition for the playground was won by architect Hisham N. Ashkouri; the facility was completed in 1984, and it was refurbished and reopened in 1997.

=== Art installations ===
Immediately outside the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center is a sculpture by Eric Fischl called &quot;Soul in Flight&quot;. The sculpture, unveiled in August 2000, is a 14-foot bronze nude statue that serves as a permanent memorial to Arthur Ashe and includes one of his favorite quotes, &quot;From what we get we can make a living; what we give, however, makes a life.&quot;

In January 2022, sculptor Sherwin Banfield unveiled &quot;Going Back to the Meadows&quot;, a statue of Queens–born rapper LL Cool J. Located in David Dinkins Circle, the installation depicted him in a Kangol bucket hat and Cuban link chain, holding up a solar-powered boombox loaded with a cassette of his 1985 debut album, &quot;Radio&quot;. The sculpture, which remained through November 2022, featured speakers that were timed to play LL Cool J&#x27;s music for five hours on several days of the week.

=== Other infrastructure ===
This park also contains three Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) maintenance facilities: the Jamaica subway yard, the Corona subway yard, and the Casey Stengel Bus Depot. The Jamaica Yard is located at the very south end of the park site, beyond Willow Lake, while the Corona Yard and Casey Stengel Depot are located across from Citi Field.

==Transportation==

The New York City Subway and Long Island Rail Road both serve the park&#x27;s northern end. The IRT Flushing Line subway station at Mets–Willets Point is served by the , and the similarly named LIRR station serves the Port Washington Branch. These stations are located at the northern end of the park adjacent to the Corona Yard and bus depot, primarily serving Citi Field and the USTA. The 111th Street subway station is located just outside the park grounds, serving the Hall of Science. The buses all travel through the park, but only the Q48 stops within the park perimeter, serving Citi Field and the USTA. The Q58 and Q88 stop outside either side of the park and cross the park via the Horace Harding Expressway, while the Q64 crosses the park along Jewel Avenue/69th Road.

==In media==
The fictional &quot;Valley of Ashes&quot; in F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1925) is said to have been inspired by the site of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park when it was still a dump, as well as by nearby Willets Point.

In the movie &quot;Men in Black&quot; (1997), the saucer-shaped restaurants atop the observation towers of the New York State Pavilion were portrayed as real alien UFOs used as a display to disguise its appearance to the public. Edgar the bug attempts to use one to escape Earth, but not before being shot down by the agents (destroying the Unisphere in the process), after which it attempts to climb aboard the second ship but is stopped by Jay, who tricks it into coming back down. Scenes for the film &quot;Men in Black 3&quot; (2012) were also filmed at Flushing Meadows. That film features a scene that recreates Shea Stadium, demolished in 2009, during the 1969 World Series.

Since the early 1990s, the New York State Pavilion&#x27;s ledges, steps, and fountain grates have been utilized by skateboarders and featured in famous east coast skateboarding videos. The intro to the long-running 1990s sitcom &quot;The King of Queens&quot; was partly shot in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. In 2001, during the first season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, the Unisphere at Flushing Meadows Park served as the Finish Line. In 2014, it served as a stop on the first leg of Season 25. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Stark Expo—first featured in &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; (2010)—takes place at the Flushing Meadows–Corona Park and appears in multiple films in the series, including &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; (2011) and briefly in &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (2017). In early 2018, musician Paul Simon announced that he would perform his final live concert at Flushing Meadows–Corona Park on September 22, 2018. Simon had grown up near the neighborhood and had visited the park frequently.

<text>Candid Camera is an American hidden camera and practical joke reality television series. The show was created, developed, and presented by Allen Funt. Various versions of the show have appeared on television from 1948 to 2014. The program got its start on radio as The Candid Microphone on June 28, 1947.

After a series of theatrical film shorts, also titled &quot;Candid Microphone&quot;, Funt&#x27;s concept came to television on August 10, 1948, and continued into the 1970s. Aside from occasional specials in the 1980s, the show was off air until 1991, when Funt reluctantly authorized a syndicated revival with Dom DeLuise as host and Vin Di Bona producing; it ran for one year. The show made a comeback on CBS in 1996 before moving to PAX TV in 2001. This incarnation of the weekly series ended on May 5, 2004, concurrent with the selling of the PAX network itself. Beginning on August 11, 2014, the show returned in a new series with hour-long episodes on TV Land, but this incarnation only lasted a single season.

The format has been revived numerous times, appearing on U.S. TV networks and in syndication (first-run) in each succeeding decade, as either a regular show or a series of specials. Funt, who died in 1999, hosted or co-hosted all versions of the show until he became too ill to continue. His son Peter Funt, who had co-hosted the specials with his father since 1987, became the producer and host. A United Kingdom version of the format aired from 1960 to 1976.

==Premise==

The show involved concealed cameras filming ordinary people being confronted with unusual situations, sometimes involving trick props, such as a desk with drawers that pop open when one is closed or a car with a hidden extra gas tank. When the joke was revealed, victims were told the show&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;Smile, you&#x27;re on &quot;Candid Camera&quot;.&quot; The catchphrase became a song with music and lyrics by Sid Ramin.

In one episode, the show filmed the reactions of citizens after they saw the former President Harry S. Truman walking down the street. After being advised that the former president and his Secret Service entourage would be taking a walk in downtown Manhattan, the program tracked them with a hidden camera in a van. A young woman who was a champion runner was planted at a street corner they would pass, and she was asking directions from a passerby when she saw Truman and shouted hello. In a stunt suggestive of the classic radio play &quot;The Hitchhiker&quot;, she then ran around the block so she could be ahead of Truman and was at the next corner where she again said hello to him as he approached. After this was done several times, she asked President Truman if something seemed familiar. The former president replied he expected she had something to do with the van that had been following him, and pointed straight into the camera with his walking stick without turning to look.

Some of Funt&#x27;s pieces did not involve pranks but consisted simply of interviews with ordinary people. There were bizarre sequences in which people, sometimes children, gave one-of-a-kind interpretations of works of art. A little girl once told Funt that &quot;The Discus Thrower&quot; by Praxiteles showed a man throwing his little girl&#x27;s allowance to her while she stood in the back yard.

==Radio history==
&quot;The Candid Microphone&quot; was first heard on Saturday, June 28, 1947, at 7:30 p.m. on ABC radio. That series came to an end on September 23, 1948. The announcer for the radio program was Dorian St. George (1911–2004).

Beginning June 6, 1950, &quot;The Candid Microphone&quot; was broadcast by CBS on Tuesdays at 9:30 p.m., sponsored by Philip Morris, which continued for three months until August 29.

==TV history==

Funt brought his program to ABC television in 1948, using the &quot;Candid Microphone&quot; title of the radio series, and then switched to NBC in the fall of 1949 (for Philip Morris, with Ken Roberts as his announcer), at which point its name was changed to &quot;Candid Camera&quot;. The format moved to syndication in 1951 and continued for three years before returning to NBC in 1958 as a segment of Jack Paar&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. The segment reappeared in 1959 on CBS as a feature on &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;, before once again becoming a standalone show in 1960.

Its longest uninterrupted run came in the CBS Sunday evening version. Debuting in October 1960, dominating its 10pm time slot for seven years, the program reached its peak in 1963 placing second for the year in the national Nielsen ratings. In these shows producer/host Funt was joined on stage by several co-hosts. Veteran CBS broadcaster Arthur Godfrey joined Funt for the first season, until he quit due to an inability to get along with the volatile Funt. Replacing him was Garry Moore&#x27;s long time announcer and sidekick Durward Kirby from 1961 to 1966. For the final prime time season, TV hostess and former Miss America, Bess Myerson co-hosted. The 1966–67 season, with Myerson, saw the series&#x27; first use of color film. Appearances on the show by silent film comedy legend Buster Keaton were included in the 1987 Thames Television tribute documentary &quot;Buster Keaton: A Hard Act To Follow&quot;. Among the standout favorite segments was 1965&#x27;s traffic cop Vic Cianca with the Pittsburgh Police, who gained national exposure through the show and later appeared in Budweiser commercials, as well as Italian TV and the movie &quot;Flashdance&quot;. A then-unknown Woody Allen was one of the writers for the show in the early 1960s and performed in some scenarios. Though a rarity, a few celebrities appeared in the last CBS season; among them were baseball legend Jackie Robinson, impressionists George Kirby and Rich Little, singer Mike Douglas and rock vocal group The Four Seasons.

Following an ABC special in the summer of 1974 celebrating the program&#x27;s 25th anniversary, &quot;Candid Camera&quot; returned that fall for a five-year run in weekly syndication, with Funt as emcee again and John Bartholomew Tucker and Dorothy Collins as early co-hosts. Fannie Flagg, one of Funt&#x27;s writers during the 1960s run, also shared emcee duties with Funt during the 1970s era, as did Phyllis George, Betsy Palmer and Jo Ann Pflug. This version was taped at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City for its first season, then moved to WTVF in Nashville for the remainder of its run.

The network TV version celebrated its 35th anniversary with an NBC special in 1983. Four years later, a series of occasional &quot;Candid Camera&quot; specials aired on CBS with Peter Funt joining his father as co-host.

The show also aired a season in daily syndication (1991–92) with Dom DeLuise as host and Eva LaRue as co-host. Produced by Vin Di Bona and King World Productions, Funt authorized this version, but did not approve of the format or host. He stated in his biography &quot;Candidly&quot; (1994) that he deeply regretted his decision (which he made strictly for financial reasons) mainly because he did not think DeLuise understood the spirit of the show or was an appropriate host, and also because he felt the bits were weak, uninteresting, and too preoccupied with incorporating the show&#x27;s sponsor, Pizza Hut, into them in an overtly commercial way.

A 1996 CBS program celebrating the 50th anniversary of the format (dating back to the &quot;Candid Microphone&quot; days) led to another series of occasional &quot;Candid Camera&quot; specials, and then to its return as a weekly CBS show with Peter Funt and Suzanne Somers as co-hosts. The show moved to the PAX TV network in 2001 with Dina Eastwood taking over as co-host, remaining on the air for three more years before suspending production.

In April 2014, it was announced that the TV Land cable channel was reviving the show, ordering ten episodes. Peter Funt returned as a host, joined by actress Mayim Bialik as co-host, with the series premiering on August 11. However, it was not renewed for a second season.

In April 2023, it was announced that Village Roadshow Unscripted Television was in working a new version of the show with Taraji P. Henson as host.

===Ratings===
The 1960–67 run was arguably the most successful version of the show, according to the Nielsen ratings:
* 1960–61: #7 (27.3 rating)
* 1961–62: #10 (25.5 rating)
* 1962–63: #2 (31.1 rating)
* 1963–64: #7 (27.7 rating)

==Films==
In 1970, Funt wrote, narrated, directed and produced an X-rated &quot;Candid Camera&quot;-style theatrical reality film, &quot;What Do You Say to a Naked Lady?&quot; A second film, &quot;Money Talks&quot;, followed in 1972.

&quot;What Do You Say to a Naked Lady?&quot; eventually led to a series of videotapes of an adult-oriented (containing nudity) version of &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, produced in the 1980s, called &quot;Candid Candid Camera&quot;. These videos were shown on HBO and the Playboy Channel.

==Reruns==
The 1960s version was seen in reruns on CBS daytime at 10am EST from September 26, 1966, to September 6, 1968, with local stations continuing to air the series for the next several years. It also aired on the Ha! comedy network in 1990–91.

The 1970s version continued to play on local stations for several years after its cancellation, followed by a run on cable&#x27;s USA Network later in the 1980s, and another go-round on both Comedy Central and E! in the early 1990s.

Reruns of the late 1990s version and the Pax version were carried by GMC TV for a time in 2011. The final season of the 60s version and first season of the 70s version aired on JLTV from 2012 to 2013, and returned to the weekday schedule in December 2016.

No episodes from the 1991–92 season were rerun.

==Legacy==

===Television===
A British version of &quot;Candid Camera&quot; began in 1960 and ran for seven years. It was initially presented by David Nixon or Bob Monkhouse and featured Jonathan Routh and Arthur Atkins as pranksters. The show briefly returned in 1974, hosted by Peter Dulay, with Arthur Atkins and Sheila Bernette. Another series was aired in 1976 with Jonathan Routh in charge, with Dulay as producer. These two 1970s series reappeared in 1986, with an opening sequence from Peter Dulay. Jeremy Beadle made his name hosting prank shows, notably &quot;Beadle&#x27;s About&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s. Channel 4 and Dom Joly developed &quot;Trigger Happy TV&quot; in the early part of the 21st century. A similar style show with no real presenter went out as &quot;Just for Laughs&quot; on the BBC around the same time.

An Australian version of &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, titled &quot;Candid Camera On Australia&quot;, aired on the Ten Network in 1989–90.

A Chilean version of &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, titled &quot;Cámara escondida&quot;, aired on Canal 13 in 1994.

A French version of &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, titled &quot;La Caméra invisible&quot; on RTF.

Quebec saw its own adaptation titled &quot;Les insolences d&#x27;une caméra&quot;.

A German variant of &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, known as &quot;Verstehen Sie Spaß?&quot;, was begun in 1980 and continues to air as of 2019.

A wave of other American hidden-camera prank shows began in the 1980s: &quot;Totally Hidden Video&quot; was shown on Fox from 1989 until 1992. MTV&#x27;s Ashton Kutcher vehicle, &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot;, devised elaborate pranks on celebrities. Some shows have been criticized because of the potential cruelty inherent in the pranks, such as &quot;Scare Tactics&quot;. &quot;Oblivious&quot; was a series which gave cash prizes to unsuspecting subjects in the street who answered trivia questions but did not realize they were on a game show. More recent prank shows have been &quot;Girls Behaving Badly&quot;, &quot;Just for Laughs Gags&quot;, &quot;The Jamie Kennedy Experiment&quot;, &quot;Boiling Points&quot;, &quot;Trigger Happy TV&quot;, and &quot;Howie Do It&quot;. Perhaps the most ambitious of all was &quot;The Joe Schmo Show&quot; in which Matt Kennedy Gould was surrounded by actors and hoaxed for the entire series.

One episode of &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot; from 1991 featured Johnny Gilbert mentioning during the Big Sweep to a team member named Barry (who also appeared on &quot;Monopoly&quot;): &quot;He thinks he&#x27;s on &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, but he knows he&#x27;s on &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot;!&quot;

In a 2010 interview, Peter Funt commented on some of these shows, saying,
We’ve always come at it from the idea that we believe people are wonderful and we’re out to confirm it. Our imitators and other shows, whether it’s Jamie Kennedy or &quot;Punk’d&quot;, often seem to come at it from the opposite perspective, which is that people are stupid, and we’re going to find ways to underscore that.

===Academia===
In 1964, Cornell University&#x27;s Department of Psychology asked for and received permission to maintain an archive of &quot;Candid Camera&quot; and &quot;Candid Microphone&quot; episodes for educational research and study purposes.

<text>Garret Augustus Hobart (June 3, 1844 – November 21, 1899) was the 24th vice president of the United States, serving from 1897 until his death in 1899, under President William McKinley. A member of the Republican Party, Hobart was an influential New Jersey businessman, politician, and political operative prior to his vice presidency.

Hobart was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, on the Jersey Shore, and grew up in nearby Marlboro. He attended Rutgers College in New Brunswick, and read law under Paterson-based attorney Socrates Tuttle. He both studied with Tuttle and married his daughter, Jennie. Although he rarely set foot in a courtroom, Hobart became wealthy as a corporate lawyer. Hobart served in local governmental positions, and then successfully ran for office as a Republican, serving in both the New Jersey General Assembly, where he was elected Speaker in 1874, and the New Jersey Senate, where he became its president in 1881.

He was a longtime state and national party official; during the 1896 Republican National Convention, New Jersey delegates to the convention were determined to nominate him for vice president. Hobart&#x27;s political views were similar to those of William McKinley, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate. With New Jersey a key state in the upcoming election, McKinley and his close adviser, future U.S. Senator Mark Hanna, backed Hobart, who was easily nominated on the first ballot. The vice presidential candidate emulated his running mate with a front porch campaign, and also spent considerable time at the campaign&#x27;s New York City headquarters. On November 3, 1896, McKinley and Hobart were elected.

As vice president, Hobart proved a popular figure in Washington and was a close adviser to McKinley. Hobart&#x27;s tact and good humor were valuable to the President, as in mid-1899 when Secretary of War Russell Alger failed to understand that McKinley wanted him to leave office. Hobart invited Alger to his New Jersey summer home and broke the news to the secretary, who submitted his resignation to McKinley on his return to Washington. Hobart died of heart disease in 1899, aged 55. His place on the Republican ticket in 1900 was taken by Theodore Roosevelt, who succeeded as president after McKinley&#x27;s assassination in 1901.

==Early life and education==

Garret Augustus Hobart was born on June 3, 1844, in Long Branch, New Jersey, to Addison Willard Hobart and the former Sophia Vanderveer. Addison Hobart descended from the early colonial-era settlers of New England; many Hobarts served as pastors. Addison Hobart came to New Jersey, where he taught school in Bradevelt, a small hamlet in Marlboro Township, New Jersey. His mother was descended from 17th-century Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam in present-day New York City, who later moved to Long Island and then ultimately to New Jersey. When Addison and Sophia Hobart married in 1841, they moved to Long Branch, where Addison founded an elementary school. The couple had three children who survived infancy; Garret was the second of three boys.

Hobart initially attended his father&#x27;s school in Long Branch. The family moved to Marlboro in the early 1850s, where he attended the village school. Childhood tales of the future vice president describe him as an excellent student in both day and Sunday School, and a leader in boyhood sports. Recognizing his abilities, his father sent him to a well-regarded school in Freehold. After a disagreement with the teacher, however, he refused to return. He then attended Middletown Point Academy, later known as the Glenwood Institute, a boarding school in Matawan, New Jersey. Hobart graduated at age 15. His parents felt he was too young to attend college, so he remained at home for a year, where he studied and worked part-time at the Bradevelt School, the same institution that employed his father.

In 1860, Hobart enrolled at Rutgers College. In 1863, he graduated third in his class. Throughout his adult life, Hobart was a generous donor to Rutgers, and was awarded an honorary degree after becoming vice president, and was elected a Rutgers trustee shortly before his death.

==Career==
===Law practice===

After graduating from Rutgers, Hobart worked briefly as a teacher to repay loans. Although Hobart was young and in good health, he did not serve in the Union Army. Addison Hobart&#x27;s childhood friend, lawyer Socrates Tuttle, offered to take Hobart into his office to study law. Tuttle was a prominent Passaic County lawyer who had served in the New Jersey state legislature. Hobart supported himself by working as a bank clerk in Paterson; he later became director of the same bank. Hobart was admitted to the bar in 1866; he became a counsellor-at-law in 1871 and a master in chancery in 1872.

In addition to learning law from Tuttle, Hobart fell in love with his daughter, Jennie Tuttle Hobart, who later recalled, &quot;When this attractive young law student appeared in our home I, then a young girl in my teens, unexpectedly played a rôle of importance by losing my heart to him&quot;. They were married on July 21, 1869. The Hobarts had long been Democrats; Garret Hobart&#x27;s marriage into the Republican Tuttle family converted him. The Hobarts had four children, two of whom survived infancy. One daughter, Fannie, died in 1895; Hobart&#x27;s son, Garret Jr. survived him.

Socrates Tuttle was influential in Paterson, which worked to Hobart&#x27;s advantage. According to a 2010 article about Hobart, the future vice president &quot;benefited greatly from Tuttle&#x27;s beneficence&quot;. In 1866, the year he became a lawyer, Hobart was appointed grand jury clerk for Passaic County, New Jersey. When Tuttle became mayor of Paterson in 1871, he appointed Hobart as city counsel. A year later, Hobart became counsel for the county Board of Chosen Freeholders.

===Political career===

In 1872, Hobart ran as a Republican for the New Jersey General Assembly from Passaic County&#x27;s third legislative district. He was easily elected, winning nearly two-thirds of the vote. At the time, members of the General Assembly were elected annually, and Hobart was successful in winning re-election the following year, although his margin of victory was cut in half.

In 1874, still only age 30, he was voted Speaker of the Assembly. In 1876, he was nominated for the New Jersey Senate seat for Passaic County. He was elected to a three-year term and he was re-elected in 1879. In 1881 and 1882, he served as President of the state Senate, becoming the first man to lead both houses of the legislature. In 1883, he was the Republican nominee in the election for United States Senate—until 1913, senators were elected by state legislatures. As the Democrats were in the majority, the nomination was a way of honoring Hobart for his political service. When he was asked his feelings about the nomination, he responded, &quot;I do not worry about things that do not come my way.&quot; The complimentary nomination would prove to be Hobart&#x27;s only electoral defeat.

Hobart said of his involvement in public affairs, &quot;I make politics my recreation.&quot; He devoted most of his time to a law practice which according to Hobart&#x27;s legislative biography was highly profitable. He was rarely seen in a courtroom; his official biography for the 1896 campaign acknowledged that &quot;he has actually appeared in court a smaller number of times than, perhaps, any lawyer in Passaic County&quot;. Hobart&#x27;s real work was in advising corporations how to accomplish their aims, yet remain within the law. He also had a lucrative business acting as court-appointed receiver of bankrupt railroads, reorganizing them and restoring them to fiscal health. He often invested heavily in them; Hobart&#x27;s success made him wealthy. In addition to the railroads for which he served as a receiver, he served as president of the Paterson Railway Company, which ran the city&#x27;s streetcars, and as a board member for other railroads.

One reason for Hobart&#x27;s success in both the private and public sectors was his genial personality. He worked well with others and was noted for tact and charm. Senator Mark Hatfield, in his book on American vice presidents, suggests that these qualities would have made Hobart successful in Washington, D.C. had he run for Congress. Hatfield states that the reason why Hobart chose not to move from state to national politics prior to 1896 was a reluctance to leave a comfortable life and successful law practice in Paterson. Instead, Hobart continued to involve himself in party politics; he was widely regarded as Northern New Jersey&#x27;s most influential Republican.

Beginning in 1876, he was a delegate to every Republican National Convention in his lifetime. He was chairman of the New Jersey Republican Committee from 1880 to 1891, resigning the position as he became more deeply involved in Republican National Committee affairs. He was New Jersey&#x27;s representative on the national committee after 1884, and rose to become vice chairman.

== Election of 1896 ==
=== Selection as candidate ===
Jennie Tuttle Hobart, in her memoirs, traced her suspicions that her husband might be a vice presidential contender to a lunch she had with him at the Waldorf Hotel in New York City, in March 1895. During the meal, industrialist and future U.S. Senator Mark Hanna interrupted them to ask what Garret Hobart thought of the possible presidential candidacy of Ohio governor William McKinley. Hanna was one of McKinley&#x27;s principal backers. Garret Hobart evaded the question, but Jennie Hobart believed the conversation to have been the first of a chain of events which elevated her husband to national office.

In November 1895, Republican John Griggs was elected governor of New Jersey; his campaign was managed by Hobart. The election of New Jersey&#x27;s first Republican governor since the 1860s led to speculation in the newspapers that Hobart would be a candidate for vice president. New Jersey Republicans were anxious to nominate Hobart, both to see one of their own possibly elevated to national office, and in the hope that having Hobart on the national ticket would boost the Republican vote in New Jersey. Hobart was an attractive candidate as he was from a swing state, and the Griggs victory showed that Republicans could hope to win New Jersey&#x27;s electoral votes, which they had not done since 1872. Another reason for a Hobart selection was his wealth; he could be expected to spend abundantly on his own campaign.

According to Hanna biographer Herbert Croly, Hobart, an early supporter of McKinley, helped ensure New Jersey&#x27;s support for him at the Republican convention. Historian Stanley Jones, in his study of the 1896 election, stated that Hobart stopped off in Canton, Ohio, McKinley&#x27;s hometown, en route to the convention in St. Louis. Jones wrote that the future vice president was selected several days in advance, after Speaker of the House Thomas Reed of Maine turned down the nomination. Croly asserted that McKinley and Hanna desired an easterner on the ticket to balance it and boost support in the Mid-Atlantic region. The conventional means of assuring this was to nominate a politician from New York, then the largest state in population. As many New York delegates supported their favorite son candidate, Governor (and former vice president) Levi P. Morton, instead of McKinley, giving the state the vice-presidential nomination would be an unmerited reward. According to Croly,

McKinley was nominated for president on the first ballot. Hobart described his subsequent first-ballot nomination for vice president as a tribute from his friends, but Hatfield noted, &quot;it came equally as a tribute from [Hanna, who] wanted a ticket to satisfy the business interests of America, and Hobart, a corporate lawyer, fit that requirement perfectly&quot;. Although a Hobart nomination had been talked about at least since Griggs&#x27; victory the previous November, Hobart expressed reluctance in a letter to his wife from the convention: &quot;It looks to me I will be nominated for Vice-President whether I want it or not, and as I get nearer to the point where I may, I am dismayed at the thought  ... If I want a nomination, everything is going my way. But when I realize all that it means in work, worry, and loss of home and bliss, I am overcome, so overcome I am simply miserable.&quot; Despite Hobart&#x27;s expressed hesitation, he was welcomed home by a crowd of 15,000 at the Paterson Armory. City officials, feeling they had insufficient fireworks to properly honor Hobart, obtained more from New York City.

According to historian R. Hal Williams, the Republicans left St. Louis in June with &quot;a popular, experienced [presidential] candidate, a respected vice-presidential nominee, and an attractive platform&quot;. Many Republicans were convinced the election would be fought over the issue of tariffs, and they anticipated an easy victory.

On June 30, 1896, Hobart journeyed by train to Canton, where he was met at the station by his running mate. McKinley drove Hobart to the Ohioan&#x27;s home, where Hobart followed McKinley in speaking to a delegation which had arrived to greet the presidential candidate. Hobart only remained in Canton a few hours before returning east. According to Hobart&#x27;s Presbyterian minister and biographer David Magie, Hobart made the trip &quot;to pay his respects to the head of the ticket and to consult with him upon important matters&quot;. McKinley biographer Margaret Leech recorded that the two men were friends almost as soon as they met.

=== Campaign ===
The Panic of 1893 had led to hard times in the United States, and the effects were still felt in 1896. One proposal to cure the economic malaise was &quot;Free Silver&quot;; that the government would accept silver bullion and return it to the depositor, struck into silver dollars. At the time, the silver in a dollar coin was worth $.53. Implementation of the proposals would increase the money supply and cause difficulties in international trade with nations that remained on the gold standard. Proponents argued that the increased money supply would stimulate the economy. President Grover Cleveland was firmly for the gold standard, a stance which bitterly divided the Democratic Party. Most Republicans were for the gold standard, though some, mostly from the West, were &quot;Silver Republicans&quot;. The Democrats in early July nominated for president an eloquent silver supporter, former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan, whose Cross of Gold speech at the convention catapulted him to the nomination. The selection of Bryan prompted a wave of popular support for the Democrats.

Hobart was a strong supporter of the gold standard; and insisted on it remaining a major part of the Republican campaign even in the face of Bryan&#x27;s surge. In his speech responding to the formal notification of his convention victory, Hobart stated, &quot;An honest dollar, worth 100 cents everywhere, cannot be coined out of 53 cents worth of silver plus a legislative fiat. Such a debasement of our currency would inevitably produce incalculable loss, appalling disaster, and National dishonor.&quot; McKinley was not as strong a supporter of the gold standard as Hobart and considered modifying some of Hobart&#x27;s expressed views on the gold standard before the acceptance was printed for public distribution. Hobart insisted on it being printed without change, writing, &quot;I think I know the sentiment of Eastern men better than you can, and with this knowledge and my convictions I must retain the statements as I have written them.&quot; According to Connolly, &quot;Though a protectionist, Hobart believed the money issue, not tariffs, led to a November Republican victory, and, in denouncing silver, his rhetoric far outstripped [that of] William McKinley.&quot;

Together with Pennsylvania Senator Matthew Quay, Hobart ran the McKinley campaign&#x27;s New York City office, often making the short journey from Paterson for strategy meetings. The vice-presidential candidate emulated McKinley in giving speeches from his front porch; unlike McKinley he also addressed rallies. In October, he made a short tour of New Jersey to campaign, expressing relief to his wife when it came to a close. On November 3, 1896, the voters cast their ballots in most states; a nervous Hobart spent the day at his office. Special telegraph wires had been attached to his home; at 8:30 in the evening, they conveyed the news to him that McKinley and Hobart had won. The Republican ticket won New Jersey, together with the entire Northeast. The following week, Vice President-elect Hobart attended Rutgers&#x27; 130th-anniversary celebrations as guest of honor. The member of the Class of 1863 was now Rutgers&#x27; most prominent graduate.

== Vice presidency (1897–1899) ==

Hobart spent much of the four months between election and inauguration reading about the vice presidency, preparing for the move, and winding down some business affairs. He did not, however, resign from the boards of corporations which would not have business before the federal government. &quot;It would be highly ridiculous for me to resign from the different companies in which I am officer and a stockholder whose interests are not in the least affected, or likely to be, by my position as Vice President.&quot; On March 2, 1897, Hobart and his family left Paterson to travel to Washington by special train. On March 4, he was inaugurated as vice president in the Senate Chamber. The &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; predicted, &quot;Garret A. Hobart will not be seen or heard until, after four years, he emerges from the impenetrable vacuum of the Vice Presidency.&quot;

=== Presidential advisor ===
After moving to Washington, D.C., the Hobarts established themselves at the Arlington Hotel, which was the Washington, D.C. home to many political men of the era, including Hanna. Soon, however, Senator Don Cameron of Pennsylvania, who was retiring from office at the time of Hobart&#x27;s inauguration, offered them the lease of the house he owned at 21 Madison Place, diagonally across Pennsylvania Avenue from the Executive Mansion, as the White House was then known. The asking price was $10,000 per year; the vice president bargained Cameron down to $8,000, equal to the vice-presidential salary, by suggesting that the public might assume he stole the excess. Among the frequent visitors at what came to be known as the &quot;Cream White House&quot; was Hanna, by then a senator, who would come by for breakfast and talk with the vice president until it was time for both to go to the Senate.

The president and vice president were already friends from the campaign; after the inauguration, a close relationship grew between the two men and their wives. The First Lady, Ida McKinley, had health issues, and could not stand the strain of the required official entertaining. Jennie Hobart often substituted for the first lady at receptions and other events, and also was a close companion, visiting her daily. The Hobarts and McKinleys visited each other&#x27;s home without formality; according to Jennie Hobart, writing in 1930, &quot;it was an intimate friendliness that no vice president and his wife, before or since, have had the privilege of sharing with their chief administrator.&quot; The Hobarts often entertained at their house, which was useful to McKinley, who could attend and meet informally with congressmen without placing strain on his wife with a White House function. McKinley, who had become insolvent while governor of Ohio, turned over a portion of his presidential salary to Hobart to invest.

The vice president had in recent administrations been considered a relatively low-level political functionary, whose activities were generally limited to the constitutional function of presiding over the Senate. Hobart, however, became a close adviser to McKinley and his Cabinet members, although he was not called upon to attend Cabinet meetings. Reporter Arthur Wallace Dunn wrote of Hobart in 1922, &quot;for the first time in my recollection, and the last for that matter, the Vice President was recognized as somebody, as a part of the Administration, and as a part of the body over which he presided&quot;.

Through late 1897 and early 1898, many Americans called for the United States to intervene in Cuba, then a Spanish colony revolting against the mother country. These calls greatly increased in February 1898, when the American battleship &quot;Maine&quot; sank in Havana harbor after an explosion. McKinley sought delay, hoping to settle the disputes peacefully, but in April 1898, Hobart told the President that the Senate would act against Spain whether McKinley liked it or not. McKinley gave in; Congress declared war on April 25, beginning the Spanish–American War, and Hobart sent McKinley a pen with which to sign the declaration.

=== &quot;Assistant President&quot; ===
Hobart was more assertive as U.S. Senate president than his predecessors had been. It was customary for the vice president not to rule on disputed points, but to submit them to a vote. Hobart, with his experience as a presiding officer in the New Jersey Legislature, took a more assertive role, ruling on disputes, and trying to expedite legislation. Hobart was initially diffident in his role, feeling himself unproven beside longtime national legislators, but soon gained self-confidence, writing in a letter that &quot;I find that I am as good and as capable as any of them. If they know a whole lot of things I don&#x27;t know, I also know a whole lot of things they don&#x27;t know. And there is a common humanity running through them all that makes us all as one, after all.&quot; Hobart was so successful at guiding the administration&#x27;s legislative agenda through the Senate that he became known as the &quot;assistant President&quot;.

Hobart was constant in his attendance at the Senate; one onlooker called him a &quot;chronic audience&quot;. Vice President Hobart cast his tie-breaking vote only once, using it to defeat an amendment which would have promised self-government to the Philippines, one of the possessions which the United States had taken from Spain after the war. Hobart was instrumental in securing the ratification of the Treaty of Paris, which ended the war; according to McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan, Hobart was &quot;almost the president&#x27;s alter ego, [turning] every screw with his legendary politeness&quot;.

One post which Hobart refused to relinquish upon his inauguration was his position as one of three Joint Traffic Association (JTA) arbiters. The association was a group of railroads which sought to coordinate rates; if two railroads applied rates in different ways, the matter was settled by Hobart and two other arbiters. Hobart heard appeals while vice president. An October 1897 Supreme Court decision signaled that the JTA was likely to be found in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (it was, the following year) and Hobart resigned as arbiter in November 1897. Hobart was a major investor in the Ramapo Water Company; he had interests in many New York and New Jersey water utilities. In mid-1899, there was controversy over the so-called &quot;Ramapo Scheme&quot;, whereby the Ramapo Water Company, which owned large tracts of land in the Catskill Mountains, would sell New York City $5 million in water per year for 40 years at high rates. The proposal was never agreed to, and a Republican-controlled investigating committee found no wrongdoing, but Hobart&#x27;s role in the company was widely discussed in the press.

=== Illness and death ===

By late 1898, Hobart was ill with a serious heart ailment, which he at first concealed from the public. He continued his responsibilities in the U.S. Senate, but nearly collapsed after delivering an address closing the session. He accompanied the president on a vacation trip to Hanna&#x27;s winter home in Thomasville, Georgia, but quickly contracted the flu and returned to Washington, D.C.. By April 1899, Hobart&#x27;s illness was well known, though Hanna assured media that Hobart would be on the ticket in the 1900 election, saying, &quot;nothing but death or an earthquake can stop the re-nomination of Vice President Hobart&quot;.

Hobart rented a home in his birthplace of Long Branch, New Jersey, which was then an upscale Jersey Shore resort. Doctors prescribed complete rest, and the vice president amused himself by feeding two pet fish, a gold one named McKinley and a silver one named Bryan.

Despite his vice president&#x27;s ill health, McKinley called upon him to break the news to Secretary of War Russell Alger that McKinley wanted him to resign; the secretary had previously ignored or misunderstood repeated hints from McKinley. According to McKinley biographer Margaret Leech, &quot;the president did not show his usual hypersensitive regard for other people&#x27;s feelings in handing over to a sick man a disagreeable task which it was his own duty to perform.&quot; Hobart invited Alger to Long Branch for the weekend, and broke the news, and Alger promptly submitted his resignation to McKinley.

Hobart&#x27;s condition worsened in the days following Alger&#x27;s visit, and he became bedridden. &quot;The Sun&quot;, a New York City-based newspaper at the time, attributed Alger&#x27;s resignation to Hobart&#x27;s &quot;crystal insight&quot; and &quot;velvet tact&quot;. Following the description, Hobart wrote to McKinley, &quot;My &#x27;crystal insight&#x27; is still clear, but the nap is slightly worn off my velvet tact&quot;.

After a vacation with the McKinleys on Lake Champlain, Hobart returned to Paterson in September. On November 1, 1899, his family announced that Hobart would not return to public life. His condition deteriorated rapidly, and he died on November 21, 1899, at age 55. President McKinley told the family, &quot;No one outside of this home feels this loss more deeply than I do.&quot;

Foster Voorhees, the New Jersey governor, ordered that state buildings be draped in mourning for 30 days, and that flags be flown at half staff until Hobart&#x27;s funeral. Hobart&#x27;s home, Carroll Hall, was opened to the public for four hours so that citizens might pass by his open casket; 12,000 people did so. Hobart was laid to rest at Cedar Lawn Cemetery in Paterson after a large public funeral, attended by President McKinley and many high government officials. Although the large government delegation precluded many local residents from attending the service, a crowd of 50,000 came to Paterson to honor Hobart.

The mausoleum over Hobart&#x27;s grave was erected in 1901. His wife purchased eleven plots adjoining the family plot to accommodate the structure. The building has massive marble columns in the front with a heavy metal door; on the back above the sarcophagus is a stained glass window. There are two sarcophagi in the center of the building, for Garret Hobart and his wife. Around the tomb are niches for other members of the family. At the time of construction in 1901, the mausoleum cost about $80,000.

== Legacy ==

Hobart significantly expanded the powers of the vice presidency, becoming a presidential adviser, and taking a leadership role as president of the Senate. Between his advisory and leadership roles, he was perhaps the most influential vice president since Martin Van Buren. Although David Magie, writing in 1910, stated that Hobart&#x27;s death &quot;fixed his memory at the height of his fame&quot;, the former vice president today is little remembered. To date, the only in-depth biographies of Hobart are the one written in 1910 by Magie, as well as a 1930 memoir written by Hobart&#x27;s wife Jennie on the couple&#x27;s life in Washington D.C. According to Hatfield, he is best known for his death, clearing the way for the ascent of New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt, who took Hobart&#x27;s place on the Republican ticket in 1900 and succeeded as president after McKinley&#x27;s assassination in 1901.

Connolly finds Hobart to be very much a man of his times:

Roosevelt, Hobart&#x27;s successor, praised Hobart. The day after Hobart&#x27;s death, he stated:

A statue of Hobart, erected in 1903, stands outside Paterson&#x27;s city hall. The communities of Hobart, Oklahoma, and Hobart, Washington, are named after the former vice president.

During his vice presidency, Hobart was asked to select a sculptor to create a marble bust of his likeness for the United States Senate Vice Presidential Bust Collection. However, he delayed the decision and died before he could select someone. Jennie Hobart later chose the prominent New Jersey sculptor Frank Edwin Elwell, and Elwell completed it in 1901. That same year, it was placed in the U.S. Capitol Building.

<text>The University of Bonn, officially the Rhenish Friedrich Wilhelm University of Bonn (), is a public research university in Bonn, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It was founded in its present form as the () on 18 October 1818 by Frederick William III, as the linear successor of the () which was founded in 1777. The University of Bonn offers many undergraduate and graduate programs in a range of subjects and has 544 professors. The University of Bonn is a member of the German U15 association of major research-intensive universities in Germany and has the title of &quot;University of Excellence&quot; under the German Universities Excellence Initiative.

Bonn has 6 Clusters of Excellence, the most of any German university; the Hausdorff Center for Mathematics, the Matter and Light for Quantum Computing cluster, Bonn Center for Dependency and Slavery Studies, PhenoRob: Research for the Future of Crop Production, the Immune Sensory System cluster, and ECONtribute: Markets and Public Policy. The University and State Library Bonn (ULB Bonn) is the central university and archive library of the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn and North Rhine-Westphalia; it holds more than five million volumes.

 among its notable alumni, faculty and researchers are 11 Nobel Laureates, 5 Fields Medalists, 12 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize winners as well as some of the most gifted minds in Natural science, e.g. August Kekulé, Heinrich Hertz and Justus von Liebig; Eminent mathematicians, such as Karl Weierstrass, Felix Klein, Friedrich Hirzebruch and Felix Hausdorff; Major philosophers, such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Karl Marx, and Jürgen Habermas; German poets and writers, for example Heinrich Heine, Paul Heyse and Thomas Mann; Painters, like Max Ernst; Political theorists, for instance Carl Schmitt and Otto Kirchheimer; Statesmen, viz. Konrad Adenauer and Robert Schuman; economists, like Walter Eucken, Ferdinand Tönnies and Joseph Schumpeter; and furthermore Prince Albert, Pope Benedict XVI and Wilhelm II.

==History==
===Foundation===
The university&#x27;s forerunner was the (English: &#x27;Academy of the Prince-elector of Cologne&#x27;) which was founded in 1777 by Maximilian Frederick of Königsegg-Rothenfels (who was also one of the first employers of Beethoven), the prince-elector of Cologne. In the spirit of the Enlightenment the new academy was nonsectarian. The academy had schools for theology, law, pharmacy and general studies. In 1784 Emperor Joseph II granted the academy the right to award academic degrees (&quot;Licentiat&quot; and Ph.D.), turning the academy into a university. The academy was closed in 1798 after the left bank of the Rhine was occupied by France during the French Revolutionary Wars.

The Rhineland became a part of Prussia in 1815 as a result of the Congress of Vienna. King Frederick William III of Prussia thereafter decreed the establishment of a new university in the new province (German: ) on 18 October 1818. At this time there was no university in the Rhineland, as all three universities that existed until the end of the 18th century were closed as a result of the French occupation. The Kurkölnische Akademie Bonn was one of these three universities. The other two were the Roman Catholic University of Cologne and the Protestant University of Duisburg.
===Rhine University===
The new Rhine University (German: ) was then founded on 18 October 1818 by Frederick William III. It was the sixth Prussian University, founded after the universities in Greifswald, Berlin, Königsberg, Halle and Breslau. The new university was equally shared between the two Christian denominations. This was one of the reasons why Bonn, with its tradition of a nonsectarian university, was chosen over Cologne and Duisburg. Apart from a school of Roman Catholic theology and a school of Protestant theology, the university had schools for medicine, law and philosophy. Initially 35 professors and eight adjunct professors were teaching in Bonn.

The university constitution was adopted in 1827. In the spirit of Wilhelm von Humboldt the constitution emphasized the autonomy of the university and the unity of teaching and research. Similar to the University of Berlin, which was founded in 1810, the new constitution made the University of Bonn a modern research university.

Only one year after the inception of the Rhein University the dramatist August von Kotzebue was murdered by Karl Ludwig Sand, a student at the University of Jena. The Carlsbad Decrees, introduced on 20 September 1819 led to a general crackdown on universities, the dissolution of the Burschenschaften and the introduction of censorship laws. One victim was the author and poet Ernst Moritz Arndt, who, freshly appointed university professor in Bonn, was banned from teaching. Only after the death of Frederick William III in 1840 was he reinstated in his professorship. Another consequence of the Carlsbad Decrees was the refusal by Frederick William III to confer the chain of office, the official seal and an official name to the new university. The Rhine University was thus nameless until 1840, when the new King of Prussia, Frederick William IV gave it the official name . (This last sentence conflicts with pg. 176 of , which states a cabinet order on 28 June 1828 gave the university the following name: .)

Despite these problems, the university grew and attracted scholars and students. At the end of the 19th century the university was also known as the (English: &#x27;Princes&#x27; university&#x27;), as many of the sons of the king of Prussia studied here. In 1900, the university had 68 chairs, 23 adjunct chairs, two honorary professors, 57 Privatdozenten and six lecturers. Since 1896, women were allowed to attend classes as guest auditors at universities in Prussia. In 1908 the University of Bonn became fully coeducational.

===World Wars===

The growth of the university came to a halt with World War I. Financial and economic problems in Germany in the aftermath of the war resulted in reduced government funding for the university. The University of Bonn responded by trying to find private and industrial sponsors. In 1930 the university adopted a new constitution. For the first time students were allowed to participate in the self-governing university administration. To that effect the student council Astag (German: ) was founded the same year. Members of the student council were elected in a secret ballot.

After the Nazi takeover of power in 1933, the Gleichschaltung transformed the university into a Nazi educational institution. According to the Führerprinzip the autonomous and self-governing administration of the university was replaced by a hierarchy of leaders resembling the military, with the university president being subordinate to the ministry of education. Jewish professors and students and political opponents were ostracized and expelled from the university. The theologian Karl Barth was forced to resign and to emigrate to Switzerland for refusing to swear an oath to Hitler. The Jewish mathematician Felix Hausdorff was expelled from the university in 1935 and committed suicide after learning about his impending deportation to a concentration camp in 1942. The philosophers Paul Ludwig Landsberg and Johannes Maria Verweyen were deported and died in concentration camps. In 1937 Thomas Mann was deprived of his honorary doctorate. His honorary degree was restored in 1946.

During the second World War the university suffered heavy damage. An air raid on 18 October 1944 destroyed the main building.

===Post-war to Modern Day===

The university was re-opened on 17 November 1945 as one of the first in the British occupation zone. The first university president was Heinrich Matthias Konen, who had been expelled from the university in 1934 because of his opposition to Nazism. At the start of the first semester on 17 November 1945 the university had more than 10,000 applicants for only 2,500 places.

The university greatly expanded in the postwar period, in particular in the 1960s and 1970s. Significant events of the postwar era were the relocation of the university hospital from the city center to Venusberg in 1949, the opening of the new university library in 1960 and the opening of a new building, the Juridicum, for the School of Law and Economics in 1967.

In 1980 the Pedagogical University Bonn was merged into the University of Bonn, although eventually all the teachers education programs were closed in 2007. In 1983 the new science library was opened. In 1989 Wolfgang Paul was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. Three years later Reinhard Selten was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics. The decision of the German government to move the capital from Bonn to Berlin after the reunification in 1991 resulted in generous compensation for the city of Bonn. The compensation package included three new research institutes affiliated or closely collaborating with the university, thus significantly enhancing the research profile of the University of Bonn.

In the 2000s the university implemented the Bologna process and replaced the traditional Diplom and Magister programs with Bachelor and Master programs. This process was completed by 2007.

==Campus==
The University of Bonn does not have a centralized campus. The main building is the &quot;Kurfürstliches Schloss&quot;, the former residential palace of the prince-elector of Cologne in the city center. The main building was built by Enrico Zuccalli for the prince-elector of Cologne, Joseph Clemens of Bavaria from 1697 to 1705. Today it houses the faculty of humanities and theology and the university administration. The , a large park in front of the main building is a popular place for students to meet, study and relax. The Hofgarten was repeatedly the place for political demonstrations as for example the demonstration against the NATO Double-Track Decision on 22 October 1981 with about 250,000 participants.
The school of law and economics, the main university library and several smaller departments are housed in modern buildings a short distance south of the main building. The department of psychology and the department of computer science are located in a northern suburb of Bonn.

The science departments and the main science library are located in Poppelsdorf and Endenich, west of the city center, and housed in a mix of historical and modern buildings. Notable is the Poppelsdorf Palace (German: ), which was built from 1715 to 1753 by Robert de Cotte for Joseph Clemens of Bavaria and his successor Clemens August of Bavaria. Today the Poppelsdorf Palace houses the university&#x27;s mineral collection and several science departments; its grounds are the university&#x27;s botanical garden (the Botanische Gärten der Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn).

The school of medicine is located on the Venusberg, a hill on the western edge of Bonn. Several residence halls are scattered across the city. In total the University of Bonn owns 371 buildings.

===University Library===

The university library was founded in 1818 and started with 6,000 volumes inherited from the library of the closed University of Duisburg. In 1824 the library became legal deposit for all books published in the Prussian Rhine province. The library contained about 200,000 volumes at the end of the 19th century, and about 600,000 volumes at the outbreak of World War II. An air raid on 10 October 1944 destroyed about 200,000 volumes and a large part of the library catalog. After the war the library was housed in several makeshift locations until the completion of the new central library in 1960. The new building was designed by Pierre Vago and Fritz Bornemann and is located close to the main building. In 1983 a new library building was opened in Poppelsdorf, west of the main building. The new library building houses the science, agriculture and medicine collections. Today, the university library system comprises the central library, the library for science, agriculture and medicine and about 160 smaller libraries. It holds 2.2 million volumes and subscribes to about 14,000 journals.

The university hospital (German: ) was founded at the same time as the university and officially opened on 5 May 1819 in the former Electoral Palace (German: ), the main building, in the western wing (internal medicine) and on the second floor (obstetrics). In its first year, the hospital had thirty beds, performed 93 surgeries and treated about 600 outpatients. From 1872 to 1883 the hospital moved to a new complex of buildings in the city center of Bonn, where today the Beethoven Concert Hall stands, and after World War II to the Venusberg on the western edge of Bonn. On 1 January 2001 the university hospital became a public corporation. Although the university hospital is since then independent from the university, the School of Medicine of the University of Bonn and the university hospital closely collaborate. Today the university hospital comprises about thirty individual hospitals, employs more than 990 physicians and more than 1,100 nursing and clinical support staff and treated about 50,000 inpatients.

===University Museums===

The Akademisches Kunstmuseum (English: &#x27;Academic Museum of Antiquities&#x27;) was founded in 1818 and has one of the largest collections of plaster casts of ancient Greek and Roman sculptures in the world. At this time collections of plaster casts were mainly used in the instruction of students at art academies. They were first used in the instruction of university students in 1763 by Christian Gottlob Heyne at University of Göttingen. The Akademisches Kunstmuseum in Bonn was the first of its kind, as at this time collections at other universities were scattered around universities libraries. The first director was Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker, who also held a professorship of archaeology. His tenure was from 1819 until his retirement in 1854. He was succeeded by Otto Jahn and Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl, who shared the directorship. From 1870 to 1889 Reinhard Kekulé von Stradonitz, nephew of the organic chemist Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz, was the director. In 1872 the museum moved to a new building that was formerly used by the department of anatomy. The building was constructed from 1823 to 1830 and designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Hermann Friedrich Waesemann. Other directors of the museum were Georg Loeschcke (from 1889 to 1912), Franz Winter (from 1912 to 1929), Richard Delbrück (from 1929 to 1940), Ernst Langlotz (from 1944 to 1966), Nikolaus Himmelmann (from 1969 to 1994) and Harald Mielsch (since 1994). All directors, with the exception of Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl held a professorship of archaeology at the university.

The Egyptian Museum (German: ) was founded in 2001. The collection dates back to the 19th century and was formerly part of the Akademisches Kunstmuseum. Large parts of the collection were destroyed in World War II. Today the collection comprises about 3,000 objects.

The Arithmeum was opened in 1999. With over 1,200 objects it has the world&#x27;s largest collection of historical mechanical calculating machines. The museum is affiliated with the Research Institute for Discrete Mathematics.

The Teaching Collection of Archaeology and Anthropology (German: ) was opened in 2008. The collection comprises more than 7,500 objects of mostly pre-Columbian art.

The Botanical Garden was officially founded in 1818 and is located around the Poppelsdorf Palace. A garden existed at the same place at least since 1578, and around 1720 a Baroque garden was built for Clemens August of Bavaria. The first director of the Botanical Garden was Nees von Esenbeck from 1818 to 1830. In May 2003 the world&#x27;s largest titan arum, some 2.74 meters high, flowered in the Botanical Garden for three days.

The natural history museum was opened in 1820 by Georg August Goldfuss. It was the first public museum in the Rhineland. In 1882 it was split into the located in the Poppelsdorf Palace and a museum of palaeontology, now named .

The Horst Stoeckel-Museum of the History of Anesthesiology (German: ) was opened in 2000 and is the largest of its kind in Europe.

The Museum Koenig is one of the largest natural history museums in Germany and is affiliated with the university. The museum was founded in 1912 by Alexander Koenig, who donated his collection of mounted specimens to the public.

==Organization==
The University of Bonn has 32,500 students, and 4,000 of these are international students. Each year about 3,000 undergraduate students graduate. The university also confers about 800 Ph.D.s and about 60 habilitations. More than 90 programs in all fields are offered. Strong fields as identified by the university are mathematics, physics, law, economics, neuroscience, medical genetics, chemical biology, agriculture, Asian and Oriental studies and Philosophy and Ethics. The university has more than 550 professors, an additional academic staff of 3,900 and an administrative staff of over 1,700. The annual budget was more than 570 million euros in 2016.

===Faculties===
From the foundation in 1818 to 1928 the University of Bonn had five faculties, that is, the Faculty of Catholic Theology, the Faculty of Protestant Theology, the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Arts and Science. In 1928, the Faculty of Law and the Department of Economics, that until then was part of the Faculty of Arts and Science, merged into the new Faculty of Law and Economics. In 1934 the until then independent Agricultural University Bonn-Poppelsdorf (German: ) was merged into the University of Bonn as the Faculty of Agricultural Science. In 1936, the science departments were separated from the Faculty of Arts and Science. Today the university is divided into seven faculties.

==== Faculty of Protestant Theology ====

The Protestant Theological Faculty has existed at the University of Bonn since 1818 (Unlike other universities, only Bonn and the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Wroclaw, founded in 1811, had both a Catholic and a theological faculty). The thematic focuses are in the areas of &quot;Texts of Theology&quot;, &quot;Historical Theology&quot;, &quot;Theory of Theology&quot;, &quot;Theology in Dialogue with the Human Sciences&quot; and &quot;Ecumenical Theology&quot;. Other institutes of the faculty are the Institute of Hermeneutics and the Institute of Ecumenism. The faculty is located in the main building of the university, where the Protestant Castle Church is also located. The university preacher is Eberhard Hauschildt. The faculty operates its own dormitory for students of Protestant theology. With 187 students, it is the smallest faculty of the University of Bonn. In teacher training, the Faculty of Protestant Theology cooperates with the Institute of Protestant Theology of the University of Cologne. Numerous members of the faculty are also involved in the Center for Religion and Society of the university.

==== Faculty of Catholic Theology ====
The Faculty of Catholic Theology was also founded in 1818 with six chairs; it began teaching in the summer half of 1819. Today, the faculty comprises 13 chairs. A special feature is the workplace for theological gender research. With 243 students, it is also one of the small faculties of the university. It cooperates with the Institute for Catholic Theology of the University of Cologne and is part of the ZERG degree program. The Chair of Fundamental Theology was held by Joseph Ratzinger from 1959 to 1963, the later Pope Benedict XVI.

==== Faculty of Agriculture ====
In 1934, the Faculty of Agriculture was established at the university. It originated from the former Agricultural University Poppelsdorf, which was founded in 1847. Today, the faculty has its scientific focus in the areas of &quot;Agrar Systems Sensing Analysis and Management&quot;, &quot;Food and Nutrition&quot; and &quot;Enlightenment of genetically determined metabolic functions in crops, farm animals and humans using molecular biological methods&quot; (From Molecules to Function: Crop - Livestock - Human). Courses of study for students include Agricultural Sciences, Nutritional and Food Sciences, Animal Sciences, as well as Geodesy and Geoinformation. The location of the faculty is the Poppelsdorf campus. The faculty has about 2,500 students. In the winter semester 2008/09, the Theodor Brinkman Research Training Group was established at the faculty. The faculty comprises the following seven institutes:

* IEL - Institute of Nutrition and Food Sciences,
* IGG - Institute for Geodesy and Geoinformation,

=== Future development ===

==== Infrastructure ====

The university and North Rhine-Westphalia state construction and real estate agency is investing €2 billion in refurbishing existing buildings and new construction. One project currently under construction is the €55 million project constructing a &#x27;Teaching and Research Forum I &amp; II&#x27; that is expected to be completed by 2024. This will become a central research hub with lecture halls, a library and seminar rooms for the Economics department, the Clusters of Excellence, the Hausdorff Center for Mathematics, HPCA, and DiCe. By mid-2023 the €45 million research building for the new Leibniz Institute for the Analysis of Biodiversity Change of the Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig will be completed; this will allow for more collaborative research between the museum and the Department of Biology, and will house a data center, laboratories, a biobank, a cryogenic storage facility, spaces for collections, and a library. The University of Bonn is also currently replacing its chemistry building with a new €37.2 million five-story building for the chemical institutes that will house 17,750 square feet of laboratory space and 6,500 square feet of office space by 2023. From 2022, the Akademisches Kunstmuseum has been under renovation by the North Rhine-Westphalia state construction agency and expected to be completed by 2025. It will also accommodate the library, offices and lecture hall for the classical archaeology department, including providing access for teaching purposes to items in the collection.Over €1 billion is being spent on the main building, the Electoral Palace, which will be out of service for several years and completed in 2030; this includes work on fire protection, re-wiring, and plumbing, as well as modernization of lecture halls, common areas, and offices. The Humanities departments are being accommodated in the former Zurich Insurance building on Rabinstraße throughout the construction works, while the administrative staff are being housed in the former Deutscher Herold headquarters. Both temporary locations have been equipped with library areas, seminar rooms and meeting rooms. In addition, by 2031 €128 million will be spent on a &#x27;Forum of Knowledge&#x27; which will extend the main building on a site spanning several tens of thousands of square feet, and will be open to members of the university and city residents. The university is also planning spaces for study spaces, shops, catering, and bike parking in the extension.

==== Internationalization ====
A strategic objective of the University of Bonn since 2015 has been increasing internationality in the areas of research, teaching, and administration. With this aim, since 2015 six international transdisciplinary research areas and six clusters of excellence were formed, Bonn ranked second in Germany for international co-publications in the Nature Index 2018, The Bonn International Graduate Schools (BIGS) system was expanded to twelve graduate schools, and there was continuation of the &quot;International Doctorate&quot; program with DAAD.

The current strategic research aims for 2025 are to increase percentage of non-German national professors to 15% of total, increase the number of joint international research projects being conducted, increase application filing and approval rates in European Union research funding programs, to build up and expand European research and innovation networks, and to raise the international profile of the Bonn International Graduate Schools (BIGS). This will include formation of a global network with the existing strategic partner universities and establishing new partners for research, teaching and administration, continuation of efforts to build up the European University of Brain and Technology (NeurotechEU) within the European University Network funding framework, choosing at least two countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America as focus countries for international cooperation, and establishment of joint doctoral programs, and expansion of bi-national doctorate programs.

The strategic teaching aims for 2025 are digital internationalization of study offerings and teaching, increasing the number of English-language bachelor&#x27;s degree modules, increasing the number of incoming international exchange students (in particular bachelors programs), increase outgoing student mobility through the Global Exchange Program, improving access to underrepresented groups of students. This will include expanding the bilingually of services in central administration, enhancement of foreign language and intercultural competency acquisition opportunities as part of personnel staff skill development, further development of existing internationalization structures within the faculties, departments and institutes, digitalization of service structures for international students and academics at the University of Bonn, and increasing the University of Bonn&#x27;s international marketing and public relations.

Additional strategic objectives for the university are the increased bilateral cooperation between the University of Bonn and United Nations University, increased cooperation with international academic and science organizations active in Bonn, increased cooperation with private-sector firms based in the region, increased cooperation with the City of Bonn on internationalization-relevant initiatives, and development of long-term internationalization plans aligned with the identity of the City of Bonn as a center for sustainability policy.

<text>The George Foster Peabody Awards (or simply Peabody Awards or the Peabodys) program, named for the American businessman and philanthropist George Peabody, honor what are described as the most powerful, enlightening, and invigorating stories in all of television, radio, and online media. Because of their academic affiliation and reputation for discernment, the awards are held in high esteem within the media industry.

It is the oldest major electronic media award in the United States. Established in 1940 by the National Association of Broadcasters, the Peabody Award was created to honor excellence in radio broadcasting as the radio industry&#x27;s equivalent of the Pulitzer Prizes. It was later expanded to include television, and then to new media including podcasts and streaming. Final Peabody Award winners are selected unanimously by the program&#x27;s Board of Jurors. Because submissions are accepted from a wide variety of sources and styles, reflecting excellence in quality storytelling rather than popularity or commercial success, the deliberations seek &quot;Excellence On Its Own Terms&quot;.

Programs are recognized in seven categories: Entertainment, Arts, Children&#x27;s/Youth, Podcast/Radio, Interactive &amp; Immersive, and Public Service. Each entry is evaluated on the achievement of standards established within its own context. Peabody Award winners include radio and television stations, networks, online media, producing organizations, and individuals from around the world. 

==History==
In 1938, the National Association of Broadcasters formed a committee to recognize outstanding achievement in radio broadcasting. Committee member Lambdin Kay, public-service director for WSB radio in Atlanta, Georgia, at the time, is credited with creating the award, named for businessman and philanthropist George Foster Peabody, who donated the funds that made the awards possible. Fellow WSB employee Lessie Smithgall introduced Lambdin to John E. Drewry, of the University of Georgia&#x27;s Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, who endorsed the idea. The Peabody Award was established in 1940 with the Grady College of Journalism as its permanent home.

The Peabody Awards were originally issued only for radio programming, but television awards were introduced in 1948. In the late 1990s additional categories for material distributed via the World Wide Web were added. Materials created solely for theatrical motion picture release are not eligible.

==Peabody judging==

The Peabody Awards judging process changed in 2014. Previously, more than 1,000 entries were evaluated by some 30 committees composed of a number of faculty, staff, and students from the University of Georgia and other higher education institutions across the country. Each committee was charged with screening or listening to a small number of entries and delivering written recommendations to the Peabody Board of Jurors, a ~17-member panel of scholars, critics, and media-industry professionals. Beginning in 2015, the preliminary round of judging is done by faculty members at major research universities across the United States, most of which are not at UGA. The 18-member Board of Jurors selects the nominees and winners each year. Board members discuss recommended entries as well as their own selections at three intensive preliminary meetings. The Board convenes at the University of Georgia in early April for final screenings and deliberations. Each entrant is judged on its own merit, and only unanimously selected programs receive a Peabody Award. For many years, there was no set number of awards issued. However, in 2016 the program instituted the Peabody 30, representing the best programs out of a field of 60 nominees.

==Key people==

*George Foster Peabody (1852–1938), namesake of the awards, was a highly successful investment banker who devoted much of his fortune to education and social enterprise. 
*Lambdin Kay was the awards chairman for the National Association of Broadcasters when he was asked to create a prize to honor the nation&#x27;s premier radio programs and performances.
*John E. Drewry (1902–1983) was the first dean of the Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia. He accepted the position of dean when it was created in 1940. That same year he helped Lambdin Kay, general manager of Atlanta&#x27;s WSB Radio, create the Peabody Awards recognizing excellence in broadcasting.
*Worth McDougald (1926–2007) served as director of the Peabody Awards program from 1963 until his retirement in 1991.
*Barry Sherman (1952–2000) was the director of the George Foster Peabody Awards program at the University of Georgia from 1991 until his death in 2000.
*Horace Newcomb held the Lambdin Kay Chair for the Peabodys in the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia from 2001 to 2013..
*Jeffrey P. Jones succeeded Horace Newcomb in July 2013 as the Lambdin Kay Chair for the Peabodys in the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia.

==Award announcements and ceremonies==
Each spring, the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors announces award recipients for work released during the previous year. Traditionally, the winners&#x27; announcements have been made via a simple press release and/or a press conference. An April 2014 segment of &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; included an announcement of 2013 Peabody winners. In April 2015, the 2014 Peabodys were revealed over an 8-day period, with the entertainment-based recipients revealed on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;.

The formal presentation of the Peabody Awards is traditionally held in late May or early June. The awards were given during a luncheon in New York City for many years. The ceremony moved to a red carpet evening event for the first time on May 31, 2015, with Fred Armisen serving as host. Several famous names have served as Peabody Awards ceremony hosts over the years, among them Walter Cronkite, Lesley Stahl, Jackie Gleason, Jon Stewart, Morley Safer, Craig Ferguson, Larry King, and Ira Glass. From 2014 to 2016, the Peabody Awards aired on a tape-delayed basis on the TV channel Pivot. On June 2, 2017, a television special of the 76th Peabody Awards aired on PBS and Fusion.

==Brown Media Archives &amp; Peabody Awards Collection==
The Peabody Awards Collection is the flagship of The Walter J. Brown Media Archives &amp; Peabody Awards Collection. The archives are housed in the Richard B. Russell Building Special Collections Libraries on the north campus of The University of Georgia. The mission of the Peabody Archive is to preserve, protect, and provide access to the moving image and sound materials that reflect the collective memory of broadcasting and the history of the state of Georgia and its people. The collection contains nearly every entry for the first major broadcast award given in the United States. Entries began in 1940 for radio and 1948 for television, and at least 1,000 new entries are received every year—programs created by local, national, and international producers. The collection provides a cultural cross-section of television from its infancy to the present day, featuring news, documentary, entertainment, educational, and children&#x27;s programming. Once judging is complete, all entries are moved to the Main Library for in-depth cataloging, access, and long-term preservation.

In 2017 the Walter J. Brown Media Archives &amp; Peabody Awards Collection at the University of Georgia (BMA) and WGBH, on behalf of the American Archive of Public Broadcasting, were awarded a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission to digitize, preserve, and provide access to approximately 4,000 hours of public broadcasting programming nominated for a George Foster Peabody Award between 1941 and 1999. The full collection will eventually comprise 4,000 digitized hours of audio and video recordings from 230 local, state, and regional public broadcasting stations in 46 states as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.

<text>Mylodon is an extinct genus of ground sloth belonging to the family Mylodontidae, known from southern South America. With a total length of 3 to 4 m and a body mass of 1-2 tonnes, it is one of the largest mylodontids (though it was considerably exceeded in size by the mylodontid &quot;Lestodon&quot;).

The oldest finds probably date to the Lower Pleistocene; however, most of the fossil remains date to the Late Pleistocene. Its distribution ranged from southern Bolivia and the Pampas in the north southwards to the southernmost part of Patagonia at around 52-53 degrees south, the furthest south of any Pleistocene ground sloth, with some of the best known remains of the species being from the eponymous Cueva del Milodon (cave of &quot;Mylodon&quot;) in southern Chile. 

In addition to skeletal remains, &quot;Mylodon&quot; is also known from preserved skin and hair. Preserved dung (coprolites) indicates that &quot;Mylodon&quot; was a primarily a grazer, feeding on grasses and sedges.

&quot;Mylodon&quot; has generally only a single recognised species, &quot;Mylodon darwini&quot;, which was described by Richard Owen in 1840 based on remains collected in the Pampas by Charles Darwin (for whom the species is named) during the Voyage of the Beagle. Some recent authors suggest that there were two species, with &quot;M. darwini&quot; restricted to the Pampas, with the Patagonian remains belonging to the separate species &quot;Mylodon listai.&quot;

&quot;Mylodon&quot; went extinct at the end of the Late Pleistocene-beginning of the Holocene, around 12-10,000 years ago, as part of the end-Pleistocene extinction event, along with other ground sloths and most large animals across the Americas. &quot;Mylodon&quot; chronologically overlapped with Paleoindians, the first humans to inhabit the Americas, evidence from several sites suggest that they may have hunted &quot;Mylodon&quot;. The extinction of &quot;Mylodon&quot; may be the result of climatic change, hunting by Paleoindians, or a combination of both factors.

== Discovery ==
&quot;Mylodon&quot; was named by Richard Owen on the basis of a nearly complete lower jaw with teeth, which was found by Charles Darwin in a consolidated gravel cliff at Bahía Blanca, during the survey expedition of HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;. At several sites, preserved hide and dung have been discovered, and are in such a state of conservation that the people who first discovered them believed they belonged to a living animal, instead of to an extinct species. The discovery of fresh-looking samples of skin and dung sparked a small wave of expeditions during the early 20th century to search for a living example of the animal. The samples have since been found to be around 10,000 years old, although they look fresh because of the extreme cold and stable conditions in the caves in which they were found. 

Well preserved samples of &quot;Mylodon&quot; remains have been discovered in the Cueva del Milodón site in Patagonia, Chile along the southern flank of Cerro Benítez in the year 1896. Associated with bones of other early Patagonian animals, these remains of &quot;Mylodon&quot; date from an era earlier than 10,000 BC. The American Museum of Natural History has exhibited a sample of &quot;Mylodon&quot; dung from Argentina with a note that reads &quot;deposited by Theodore Roosevelt&quot;.

== Description ==
=== General ===

&quot;Mylodon&quot; was a large representative of the Mylodontidae. Its total length was estimated to be around 3 to 4 m. Based on the size of the skull, a weight between 1 and 2 tonnes is assumed, with an approximate estimate of 1.65 tonnes. Thus, &quot;Mylodon&quot; had about the size of related forms such as &quot;Glossotherium&quot; or &quot;Paramylodon&quot;, but was significantly smaller than the giant &quot;Lestodon&quot;. In terms of physique, it largely corresponded with the other large ground-living sloths.

=== Skull and dentition features ===
Especially in the construction of the skull, &quot;Mylodon&quot; differed significantly from other related forms. Its length varied between 59 and 71.5 cm, which is significantly longer than &quot;Glossotherium&quot; or &quot;Lestodon&quot;. At the skull it was between 16.5 and 22.5 cm wide, in the front nasal area between 11.3 and 15.5 cm. The height of the posterior skull was 14.0 to 19.0 cm and the anterior 15.0 to 23.5 cm. The skull was thereby elongated and narrow, unlike &quot;Glossotherium&quot; and &quot;Lestodon&quot; that had a short and very broad skull. The extraordinary length of the skull of &quot;Mylodon&quot; was mainly due to elongations in the rostrum. Seen from above, the rostrum narrowed towards the front. This is where the most important difference to most of the other representatives of the Mylodontidae can be found: The nasal bone was long and narrow and curved downwards in the front area. At the front end, it connected to the middle jawbone, which was lengthened by an appendage, and which in turn fused with the upper jaw. This resulted in a completely closed nasal arch in adult individuals, which is largely unknown in other sloths. In comparison, the skulls of &quot;Glossotherium&quot; and &quot;Lestodon&quot;, but also of &quot;Paramylodon&quot;, showed a nasal area, seen from above, which was rather short and looked clearly cut off when viewed from the side; the roof of the skull was largely straight in &quot;Mylodon&quot;, only a slight indentation could occur above the orbit. On parietal, significant temporal lines were present, but no head crest formed. The zygomatic arch was slim, the anterior attachment began above the third and fourth molars. It did not form a solid end with the rear arch attachment. As is usual with sloths, the front arch base consisted of three appendages: one ascending, one horizontal, and one descending, the former of which was the longest. The rear arch formed a triangular plate. The occiput bent at an angle of 120° from the roof of the skull. The underside of the occiput was at about the level of the occlusal plane. When viewed from behind, the occiput appeared almost circular and not as depressed as in &quot;Glossotherium&quot; and &quot;Lestodon&quot;. The palate was narrow and was more or less triangularly oriented towards the front of the skull. Numerous small bone openings were characteristic here. The glenoid pit, in which the joint of the lower jaw engages, corresponding to that of other mylodonts with its weak form, but this provided free rotation overall.
The lower jaw of &quot;Mylodon&quot; varied in length between 42 and 48 cm. It was elongated, more noticeable than in &quot;Glossotherium&quot; and &quot;Lestodon&quot;, since in &quot;Mylodon&quot; the area in front of the teeth, in particular, is strongly elongated. The horizontal bone body increased continuously in height towards the rear, below the last molar it was about 10.5 to 12.7 cm. The symphysis at the front end for the jointing of the two halves of the lower jaw was about 12.4 cm long. Here the lower edge of the body of the lower jaw rose at an angle so that the anterior end of the symphysis was above the occlusal plane of the teeth. As with other sloths, the symphysis extended forward, it ended slightly rounded. According to the rostrum of the skull, &quot;Mylodon&quot;&#x27;s symphysis was narrow and not as wide as in &quot;Glossotherium&quot; and &quot;Lestodon&quot;. The mandible foramen opened shortly behind the symphysis. The ascending branch started behind the last molar and formed an angle of 140° to the occlusal plane. The crown process rose up to 20 cm. In contrast, the articular process was lower, roughly at the level of the occlusal plane, resulting in a low cranial-mandibular connection. The angular process at the rear end of the lower jaw was clearly visible. Sometimes it tipped down and was below the lower edge of the horizontal bone body. The upper side of the angular process does not reach the occlusal plane.

The dentition of &quot;Mylodon&quot; differs greatly from that of the other placental mammals and usually consists of five teeth at the top and four teeth at the bottom per jaw arch, meaning a total of 18 teeth. In the mylodonts, the first tooth was often caniniform while the rear teeth were more molariform. Within the sloth, this structure of the teeth can be called original. A special feature of &quot;Mylodon&quot; was that the upper canine-like tooth of each row was completely regressed and only the molar-like four rear teeth were found here. In the lower row of teeth, the anterior caniniform tooth was transformed into a molariform. The dentition thus consisted of a total of 16 teeth. This is somewhat reminiscent of &quot;Paramylodon&quot;, in which the upper canine-shaped teeth were also missing, but the lower ones had retained their strikingly pointed shape. In contrast to this, &quot;Glossotherium&quot; and &quot;Lestodon&quot; had the original decayed teeth. The flat, flap-like and largely indented structure of the &quot; molariform &quot; teeth can be emphasized as a characteristic of the mylodonts, which clearly differs from that of the Megatheriidae and Megalonychidae with their two transverse raised ridges per tooth. The shapes of the teeth present in &quot;Mylodon&quot; were simpler. In the upper jaw row, they had a rather round to oval outline, in the lower jaw row a more diamond-shaped outline. The typically more complex bilobed design of the molar-like teeth of &quot;Glossotherium&quot; and &quot;Lestodon&quot;, caused by a central constriction, only occurred on the lower rearmost tooth in &quot;Mylodon&quot;. In general, the rows of teeth diverged to the front, and the teeth were very high crowned (hypsodont). The upper row of teeth ranges in length from 10.9 to 13.3 cm, the lower row was between 12.0 and 15.0 cm in length.

=== Postcrania ===
Postcranial skeletons are far rarer in &quot;Mylodon&quot; than in the other large mylodontid sloths. As a result, the skeleton is less well documented. Only individual elements of the spine, such as the atlas and various thoracic vertebrae, have been described. The humerus was massive and extremely long at 46 to 48 cm. The joint head, the diameter of which was over 10 cm, stood out due to its hemispherical, but laterally somewhat flattened shape. A distinct deltopectoral ridge ran down the shaft, which acted as an anchor point for the shoulder muscles. As with many ground sloths, the lower end of the joint extended far and brought it here to a width of almost 26 cm. In part, this was caused by a massive internal epicondyle. The articular surfaces (capitulum and trochlea) were almost perpendicular to each other and did not form such an obtuse angle as in &quot;Glossotherium&quot;. The cubit was built gracefully. Their length was around 37 cm. The olecranon, i.e. the upper articular process, took up about 8.1 cm of it, which corresponds to about 22% of the total length and is significantly less than in comparison with &quot;Glossotherium&quot; and &quot;Lestodon&quot;. It was laterally narrowed, which is also found in &quot;Paramylodon&quot;. The spoke largely resembled that of Glossotherium and was compact and straight built with a length of about 30 cm. The head was oval in shape with a prominent lip. The pelvis was extremely expansive and 114 cm wide between the two iliac bones. The thigh bone measured between 55 and 59 cm in length. It was typical of ground sloths, being flat in shape. Its width decreased significantly on the shaft, the lowest value was reached just below the midpoint. Here the width was about 18 cm, the thickness about 7.5 cm. The joint ends, on the other hand, were markedly wider, around 30 cm at the knee end and around 26 cm at the foot end. The thighbone reached the shin with only about half of its length, a characteristic of mylodonts. This bone, too, was clearly flat with a thickness that was only half the value of the width at the shaft. The fibula is so far only fragmented. It was drawn in on the shaft and widened at the joint ends, with the upper joint end showing more pronounced curves than in &quot;Glossotherium&quot;.

The hand comprised a total of five digits (I to V), whereby the metacarpal bone was fused with the large polygonal bone on the first digit. This created the so-called Metacrapal Carpal Complex (MCC for short), which is typical for many ground sloths. As a special feature of the wrist, the pea bone was clearly flat, its shape resembled that of &quot;Glossotherium&quot;, but differed from the corresponding bone of other Mylodonts with spherical, walnut-like or a pyramidal shape. The fourth digit had formed the longest metacarpal bone, while that of the fifth was only slightly shorter. The respective bones measured there around 12.5 and 10.7 cm in length. As with &quot;Glossotherium&quot; and &quot;Paramylodon&quot;, only the three inner digits were probably clawed, but only of the second digit have all bone elements been documented. The metacarpal bone was 7.8 cm long and was built very gracefully. The first phalanx was extremely short and only about 2.5 cm long, the second was about 4.2 cm long and the third at least 11.5 cm. It was tubular and went forward into an extension on which the claw rested. The first phalanges of the two outer digits were significantly reduced in length. Only individual root bones of the foot, such as the talus, are present.

=== Integument ===
&quot;Mylodon&quot; is one of the few extinct mammals that has mummified skin remains. The most important location for such finds is the Cueva del Milodón in the Chilean province of Última Esperanza, where the first skin parts were brought to light at the end of the 19th century. Individual pieces have lengths of up to 150 cm, but have shrunk through drying processes. Its thickness is up to 1.5 cm in some places, but it is usually around 1 cm. The skin is densely covered with stiff, slightly wavy hair, with only the top hair being developed, while the undercoat is missing. This feature is similar to the two-toed sloths but less so than the three-toed sloths, which possess an undercoat. The length of the individual hairs vary between 5 and sometimes over 20 cm with the shortest in the area of the back of the head, medium-length hair on the back and very long hair on the limbs. Their known color ranges from yellowish to reddish-brown. The hair shafts are uniformly tubular, at the upper end they form blunt tips. As with today&#x27;s sloths, the hair did not have a pith (medulla). In contrast to the hair of the two-toed sloth, they lack their characteristic longitudinal ribbing.

The mylodonts are the only representatives of the sloths to have bony plates embedded in their skin. Such structures, called osteoderms, are known today to a greater extent only in armadillos. In contrast to the outer armor of the armadillos, the bone platelets of the mylodonts were rather loosely scattered. Hermann Burmeister published the first finds of individual osteoderms of &quot;Mylodon&quot; as early as the 1860s. The remains of skin found in the caves of Última Esperanza give an impression of how they were embedded in the skin and distributed over the body. The bone platelets are all located in the lower section of the skin, while the hairs originate in the upper sections. The distribution turned out to be very inconsistent. Some areas with a dense array of osteoderms contain between 83 and 95 platelets per 10 cm2. For others, however, the number is very thin. However, even with a close arrangement, the osteoderms never unite to form a closed shell, but are always separated from one another by individual skin folds. In accordance with the armadillos&#x27; shells, the bone platelets form a single layer and do not appear stacked. Since all skin residues were found isolated from the body skeletons, it is sometimes difficult to assign the skin areas with a dense and thin arrangement of bone platelets to a specific part of the body. However, it can be assumed that the back was largely armored and the stomach was free. In the sections with dense osteoderm formation, these were larger than in the clear areas. The bone platelets of &quot;Mylodon&quot; were mostly of irregular oval shape with dimensions of 0.5 to 2.5 cm in length, 0.3 to 1.8 cm in width and 0.2 to 1.1 cm in thickness, with weights of a maximum of 2 g. On the surface, they showed individual dimples. In cross-section, they consisted of numerous bundles of fibers mixed with hard bone blades (osteoma). This made their structure much simpler than that of the armadillos, and they probably lacked the keratin layer known from the armadillos. In principle, the osteoderms of &quot;Mylodon&quot; were similar to those of other large mylodonts.

==Distribution and important fossil finds==
===Overview and origins===
&quot;Mylodon&quot; was mainly distributed in the southern part of South America. Fossil finds are known from Argentina, Chile, southern Bolivia, Uruguay, Paraguay and southern Brazil. Thus, the colonized regions include very far southern sites on the island of Tierra del Fuego as well as most of Patagonia northward to the Pampas region. Its northern limit was around 19.6° S, while its southern limit reached the range at about 53° south. The Tres Arroyos site on Tierra del Fuego and the region around Cueva del Milodón in southwestern Patagonia are among the southernmost known records of a sloth representative in the Pleistocene. In the Pampa region, the northern limit was found approximately at the Chuí River in the southeastern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul around 30 degrees south latitude. Even more northerly points of discovery, such as Ñuapua in Bolivia, are tangent to the 20th parallel south. Finds reported from Paraguay, however, are considered rather uncertain.

The first occurrence of &quot;Mylodon&quot; may have been in the Lower Pleistocene, but finds are rather rare. During this period, the possibly closely related form &quot;Archaeomylodon&quot; also occurred in the Pampas region, whose foremost canine teeth of the upper dentition were greatly reduced in size, but not yet completely reduced. Among the early and more northerly finds of &quot;Mylodon&quot; is, for example, a skull from the El Palmar Formation in the Argentine province of Entre Ríos, which dates to the end of the last warm period about 80,000 years ago. Also from the northern distribution areas two partial skeletons are worth mentioning, one of which was found at the Río Anisacate in the Argentine province of Córdoba and the other in Arroyo Quequén Salado near Oriente in the Argentine province of Buenos Aires. Mainly in the Pampas, there was an overlap in the occurrence of &quot;Mylodon&quot; with the two other major mylodontid sloth representatives &quot;Glossotherium&quot; and &quot;Lestodon&quot; during the Upper Pleistocene. However, actual co-occurrence is rarely attested. These include the important archaeological site of Paso Otero in Buenos Aires Province, the locality of Arroyo de Vizcaíno in southern Uruguay, and the Chuí River.

===Important Upper Pleistocene finds===
As with many of the other large ground sloths, most of the &quot;Mylodon&quot; material is from the Upper Pleistocene, with a focus toward the end of the last glacial period. It is also the phase when &quot;Mylodon&quot; again disappeared from the fossil record. From a global perspective, numerous larger animals became extinct during the transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene, which is why this event is considered a Quaternary extinction wave. In South America, this coincides with the first appearance of humans. Whether the two are causally related is the subject of much controversy. In addition to potential hunting and possible landscape overprinting by early human hunter-gatherer groups, climatic changes may also have had an influence. Numerous archaeological sites, especially in the Pampa region and in the Patagonian area, are between 13,500 and 10,000 years old. The majority of these attest to at least a coexistence of humans and ground sloths over an extended period of time. Direct associations of human cultural products and fossil remains of &quot;Mylodon&quot; are found, among others, at Gruta del Indio in the eastern foothills of the Andes, at Piedra Museo or Las Buitreras, all in Argentina, and at Tres Arroyos in Tierra del Fuego, respectively.

&quot;Mylodon&quot; is often represented by isolated osteoderms, bones or in the form of coprolites, while human remains are limited to stone artifacts and/or hearths. Whether this also involved a more or less intensive raw material use of sloth bones on the part of humans is in many cases unproven. Numerous bone marks that were originally interpreted as anthropogenically caused are, according to recent studies, due to predation. Evidence of direct hunting by humans of the large ground sloths is even more difficult. One piece of evidence is often considered to be Quebrada de Quereo, a site on an ancient coastline in northern Chile. From here come, among other things, skeletal remains of two individuals of &quot;Mylodon&quot;, distributed in each case over a narrowly defined area, but in two different stratigraphic units and at a spatial distance of 21 m from each other. One of the individuals was associated with about 70 stone objects, whose anthropogenic origin is under discussion. No cut marks are found on the bones as evidence of any human manipulation. The age of the site is given as 11,600 to 10,900 years before present.

One of the most important sites is the Cueva del Milodón near Lago Sofía in the Chilean province of Última Esperanza, known mainly for its surviving skin remains. It is part of a whole system of caves in the region, such as the Cueva del Medio or the Cueva Chica, which line the southern flank of the 556 m high Cerro Benitez like pearls. Cueva del Milodón is a large cave 250 m long, 140 m wide and 30 m high at the entrance and 10 m at the back, respectively. It was discovered in 1895 by the German captain Hermann Eberhard, who also found the first skin remains. The great importance of these finds led to the cave, initially known as &quot;Cueva Eberhardt&quot;, being subsequently visited and explored by numerous scientists. As a result, a large number of finds accumulated over time, among which &quot;Mylodon&quot; with bone remains, and numerous coprolites has a large share. Other finds belong to camels such as &quot;Lama&quot;, horses such as &quot;Hippidion&quot; or South American ungulates such as &quot;Macrauchenia&quot;, in addition, several predators are represented, including the jaguar, &quot;Smilodon&quot; as a member of the saber-toothed cats, and the giant bear form &quot;Arctotherium&quot;. Some of the mammal bones have marks that were originally associated with human activity, but the current view is that they are more likely due to predator browsing. In addition to faunal remains, the cave also held a myriad of botanical material. It also yielded one of the most extensive data sequences from the Upper Pleistocene. Several radiocarbon dates, measured from a wide variety of &quot;Mylodon&quot; finds, span a period from about 16,700 to 10,200 years ago. The upper data are among the most recent obtained directly from finds of the sloth vertebrate.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Mylodon&quot;&#x27;s close relatives include the ground sloths of the genera &quot;Glossotherium&quot; and &quot;Paramylodon&quot;. The latter genus has often been confused with &quot;Glossotherium&quot;, but &quot;Paramylodon&quot; is a distinct genus that was restricted to the Pleistocene of North America. &quot;Glossotherium&quot; also shares a long history of taxonomic confusion with &quot;Mylodon&quot;, and currently the only recognized species is &quot;Mylodon darwini&quot;. At one time, the elephant-sized &quot;Megatherium&quot; was thought to be closely related, but is recognized as belonging to a separate family (Megatheriidae).

Below is a phylogenetic tree of the Mylodontidae, based on the work of Boscaini &quot;et al.&quot;. 2019.
Recent molecular sequence results obtained using collagen and mitochondrial DNA extracted from fossils indicate that the closest living relatives of &quot;Mylodon&quot; are the two-toed sloths of genus &quot;Choloepus&quot;. This revelation came as a surprise, since morphological analyses had previously suggested that two-toed sloths were close to Caribbean sloths and &quot;Megalonyx&quot;, now regarded as representing two separate and distant branches of the sloth evolutionary tree.

Some authors suggest that there were two species, with &quot;M. darwini&quot; restricted to the Pampas, with the Patagonian remains belonging to the separate species &quot;Mylodon listai.&quot;

== History of research ==
=== First description ===
The taxonomic history of &quot;Mylodon&quot; is complex. It has involved confusion and equivocation with other mylodont forms such as &quot;Glossotherium&quot; and &quot;Paramylodon&quot; over a long period of time. Some of this complexity can be attributed to the first describer of the genus itself, who is Richard Owen (1804-1892). Owen, one of the most important explorers of the Victorian era, was concerned from 1836 with fossil finds brought back by Charles Darwin from his pioneering voyage on HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; to South America. The collection also included a mandible from Punta Alta near Bahía Blanca in the south of the Argentina Buenos Aires Province (specimen number NHM 16617). The nearly complete specimen was distinguished by a row of teeth consisting of a total of four molar-like Teeth. In an extensive 1840 paper, Owen referred the mandible to the new genus he had created, &quot;Mylodon,&quot; and named the species &quot;M. darwinii&quot; (&quot;darwinii&quot; is the spelling used by Owen, but in modern times &quot;darwini&quot; is also often used; according to the Regulations of Zoological Nomenclature, the former version is correct.) He related the genus name to the molar-like teeth (from Greek &quot;μυλη&quot; (&quot;myle&quot;) for &quot;molar&quot; and &quot;ὀδούς&quot; (&quot;odoús&quot;) for &quot;tooth&quot;, thus translating as much as &quot;molar tooth&quot;), with the species epithet &quot;darwinii&quot; honoring Darwin as finder of the voucher specimen. As a second species besides &quot;M. darwinii&quot; Owen referred in his paper to &quot;M. harlani&quot;. This form was based on a mandible and clavicle, both of which came from the Big Bone Lick in Boone County in the U.S. state of Kentucky, and which Richard Harlan had already described in 1831 under the species assignment &quot;Megalonyx laqueatus&quot;. Owen, however, recognized similarities in the construction of the mandible to his &quot;M. darwinii&quot; and renamed Harlan&#x27;s form. Harlan used an essay two years later to comment on Owen&#x27;s choice of name regarding &quot;Mylodon,&quot; which he felt was not very descriptive. According to him, the name could be applied to almost any extinct mammalian form because almost all of them had the posterior molars. Moreover, the name would be inappropriate because, starting from the Latin version &quot;dens molaris&quot; for &quot;molar tooth&quot; and the second part of speech &quot;don&quot; (from &quot;dens&quot; for &quot;tooth&quot;), there is a duplication that would translate as &quot;molar tooth-tooth&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harlan 1842&quot;/ Regardless, Owen&#x27;s establishment of the genus &quot;Mylodon&quot; with two species resulted in the extinct sloth representative being distributed in both South and North America.

=== &quot;Glossotherium&quot;, &quot;Grypotherium&quot; and &quot;Paramylodon&quot; ===

Owen, in his 1840 work, established the genus &quot;Glossotherium&quot; in addition to &quot;Mylodon&quot;, but without designation of a specific species. The basis here was a posterior skull fragment taken from the riverbed of the Arroyo Sarandi in the Uruguay department of Soriano. In contrast to &quot;Mylodon&quot;, for which Owen assumed a kinship proximity to the other large ground sloths known at the time, such as &quot;Megatherium&quot; or &quot;Megalonyx&quot;, he placed &quot;Glossotherium&quot; in a series with the anteaters and with the pangolins, respectively, and postulated an insectivorous lifestyle for the animals. Two years later, however, Owen discarded the name &quot;Glossotherium&quot; again. This occurred in the course of processing a nearly complete skeleton that had been discovered the year before in the flood plains of the Río de la Plata north of Buenos Aires. The largely intact skull was characterized by a short and broad snout and by a dentition consisting of a total of 18 teeth, of which the foremost tooth in each case showed a canine design. Based on the similarities in dental structure with the flat, molar-like teeth, Owen placed the skeleton in the genus &quot;Mylodon&quot; and introduced the new species &quot;M. robustus.&quot; The skull fragment that he had originally placed in &quot;Glossotherium&quot; he now associated with &quot;M. darwinii&quot;. As a result of this study, three species of the genus &quot;Mylodon&quot; already existed in the 1840s.

A skull including mandible found at Pergamino in Buenos Aires Province served the Danish zoologist Johannes Theodor Reinhardt (1816-1882) in 1879 as the basis for a comprehensive description. Characteristic of the skull was the narrow snout and a closed nasal arch, which was formed by the firm adhesion of the nasal bone to the middle jaw bone. Furthermore, the dentition consisted of a total of 16 teeth, the upper front canine-like tooth was reduced in each case, in the lower jaw, however, sat four molar-like teeth each. Reinhardt noticed similarities to &quot;M. darwinii&quot; in the construction of the lower jaw, but in the skull design his find deviated clearly from the broad-nosed &quot;M. robustus&quot; by the narrow snout. However, according to Reinhardt, there were matches in Owen&#x27;s &quot;Glossotherium&quot; skull fragment with corresponding skull sections in &quot;M. robustus&quot;. Based on the clear parallels between &quot;M. darwinii&quot; and his narrow-beaked skull finding, Reinhardt propagated the new genus &quot;Grypotherium&quot; with &quot;Grypotherium darwinii&quot; as the type species. A different approach was taken by Florentino Ameghino (1854-1911) about ten years later. He confirmed in 1889, the separation of both &quot;M. darwinii&quot; and &quot;M. robustus&quot; not only at the species level, but also at the genus level. Deviating from Reinhardt, but agreeing with Owen, he considered the mandible of &quot;M. darwinii&quot; and the skull fragment of &quot;Glossotherium&quot; to belong together. Since in this scenario &quot;Glossotherium&quot; possessed priority over &quot;Mylodon&quot; (Owen mentioned the former over the latter in 1840) and &quot;Grypotherium,&quot; Ameghino introduced the species &quot;Glossotherium darwinii.&quot; In contrast, he left the status of &quot;M. robustus&quot; untouched. Arthur Smith Woodward (1864-1944), in turn, followed Reinhardt&#x27;s reasoning. In a paper published in 1900, he presented findings from ground sloths of southern Patagonia and at the same time revised Charles Darwin&#x27;s collection. In doing so, he equated the mandible of &quot;M. darwinii&quot; with Reinhardt&#x27;s &quot;Grypotherium&quot; and subsequently recovered &quot;Grypotherium darwinii&quot;. Smith Woodward assigned the skull fragment of &quot;Glossotherium&quot; to &quot;M. robustus&quot; by analogy with Reinhardt.

== Paleobiology ==
===Diet===

The mylodontids (particularly &quot;Mylodon&quot; itself) are often considered to be pronounced grazers because of their dental structure with flat chewing surfaces on the molar-like teeth. This is also supported by the high (hypsodont) tooth crowns and the wide mouth with numerous shapes. The ungulates are mostly used as analogous examples, in which shapes with high tooth crowns and broad-lipped mouths are usually grass-eating, such as various cattle, horses or the white rhinoceros. In contrast, those with low tooth crowns and narrow snouts such as the duiker or the black rhinoceros feed largely selective from various leaves and other soft vegetable foods. In contrast to other large mylodontid sloths such as &quot;Glossotherium&quot;, &quot;Paramylodon&quot; or &quot;Lestodon&quot;, the mouth of &quot;Mylodon&quot; is relatively narrow. A special feature is the closed nasal arch, which is heavily roughened in its front area and thus offers muscle attachment points for a mobile upper lip. Something similar can be said about individual depressions in the vicinity of the infraorbital foramen, which also functioned as starting points for individual muscle strands in the nose and lip area. Maybe &quot;Mylodon&quot; was more well-adapted to a mixed-vegetation diet, which was picked up with the help of a movable upper lip. The loss of the front teeth in the upper row of teeth also leads to the assumption that, comparable to cattle, there was a horn-like structure on the middle jawbone that could be used to pluck the food.

The entire anterior cranial structure of &quot;Mylodon&quot; is relatively solid, combined with a partially ossified nasal septum, it can be assumed that relatively high chewing forces acted when the food was chopped up. In contrast to the sometimes huge representatives of the Megatheriidae, the joint between the lower jaw and the skull of the Mylodonts was relatively low, roughly at the chewing level of the teeth. The resulting decreasing lever arm of the masseter muscle experiences through the structure of the zygomatic arch, mainly of the descending process, a certain compensation, so that there should have been only minor differences to the Megatheria with regard to the biting force. The extended mandibular joint allows a wide freedom of movement when chewing. Against this, however, is the zygomatic arch, which is not closed and therefore could only withstand the opposing forces of the masseter and musculus pterygoideus to a limited extent. It can therefore be assumed that forwards and backwards directed chewing movements dominated in &quot;Mylodon&quot;. The flat tooth crowns lead to a comparatively small size of the total available chewing surface. In &quot;Mylodon&quot;, this amounts to a good 1320 mm2 corresponding to other mylodonts of the same size. The Indian rhinoceros, which is comparable in terms of its dimensions, has, on the other hand, double to four times the value with 2660 to 5190 mm2. The situation is similar with the hippopotamus, the total surface area of which is between 3290 and 5410 mm2. The small total occlusal surface of the teeth in &quot;Mylodon&quot; probably resulted in a rather low processing capacity for the food in the mouth. This can result in either a high rate of fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract and/or a very slow metabolism concluded. The latter is the case with today&#x27;s sloths. This is due to the long passage time of the food of up to a week through the large, multi-chambered stomach. It can be assumed that this also applies to the extinct sloths. Possibly this made the stomach of the mylodonts a functional equivalent to the complex stomach of the ruminants, whereby a long passage time of the food enabled efficient digestion, in which even more difficult to access nutrients could be provided, for example from foods with a greater fiber content. Such a digestive system could reduce the amount of processed food in the mouth and thus ultimately also have compensated for the small total chewing surface in &quot;Mylodon&quot;.
Direct analysis of the food resources used is possible, among many other things, due to the numerous dung residues in the form of coprolites. These are available not only from the Cueva del Milodón in the Chilean part of Patagonia, but also from other caves. The coprolites of &quot;Mylodon&quot; have a diameter of up to 18 cm. Investigations of the plant residues showed 80 to 95% grasses and 5 to 20% sedges. Herbaceous plants, on the other hand, could only be detected in traces. Accordingly, &quot;Mylodon&quot; led, at least in southwestern Patagonia, a diet consisting almost exclusively of grasses. The food is reflected in the paleohabitat, as pollen analyzes show that the landscape at that time was tundra-like in character and was therefore almost free of trees with only a few low bushes. Occasional evidence of false beeches is interpreted as pollen carried by the wind.

A 2021 study on stable isotope ratios concluded that &quot;Mylodon&quot; must have been at least sporadically omnivorous.

=== Locomotion ===
In general, large mylodonts are ground-dwelling animals. The lower section of the hind leg, which is very short compared to the upper, is also found in &quot;Mylodon&quot;, whose tibia is 27 cm in length and only half as long as the thigh bone, 59 cm in length. In comparison, the Megatheriidae possess significantly longer lower leg portions, about the almost equally-proportioned &quot;Pyramiodontherium&quot; possessing to a 47 cm long shin to a 49 cm long femur. Possibly these differences in the hind leg structure result in much more agile locomotion in the Megatheria in relation to the mylodonts. Similar to other large ground sloths, the hand of &quot;Mylodon&quot; made contact with the ground with the outer side edge and thus sat up rotated. This is indicated by the long metacarpal bones of the external digits and the decreasing number of phalanges on them. The special hand position protected the long claws of the inner digits, which did not penetrate the ground while walking. A functionally similar but fundamentally different hand position can be found in the ankle duct of the distantly related present-day great anteater. The elbow joint was pointed slightly outwards when standing on four feet and the arms were thus angled slightly inwards, which is evident from the position of the olecranon yields. The hands came to rest slightly within the width of the elbow. Such an orientation of the arms can effectively support the large mass of &quot;Mylodon&quot;. As a result, the hands would also be in a line with the feet, which is also conveyed, among other things, by footprints from &quot;Paramylodon&quot;. The laterally limited articular surface of the femoral head severely restricted the mobility of the hindlimbs. The same applies to the forearm, the straight spoke with the laterally elongated head of which did not allow any major rotational movements. These features can be interpreted as adaptations to a purely terrestrial lifestyle. Finally, the muscle attachment points on the first cervical vertebra referenced, which are more developed than for example with &quot;Paramylodon&quot;. Correspondingly, the occipital joint surfaces are also somewhat further apart. Both can be interpreted as meaning that the more massive skull of &quot;Mylodon&quot;, caused by the lengthening of the snout region, required greater muscle support.

For some of the mylodonts of South America, such as &quot;Glossotherium&quot;, a partially burrowing way of life is being reconstructed, which results from the construction of the foreleg, among other things. An indicator for this is the upper articular process (olecranon) of the ulna. The longer the olecranon, the higher the leverage of the forearm, since more attachment surface is available for the forearm muscles. In &quot;Glossotherium&quot;, the olecranon takes up up to 35% of the total length of the ulna. The resulting ability to dig would be comparable to that of the &quot;Tolypeutes&quot; armadillos, which seldom build their own burrows, but can do so. The previous analyses for &quot;Mylodon&quot; resulted in a much shorter olecranon, which accounts for only about 22% of the total length of the ulna. However, the fact that proportional estimates for &quot;Mylodon&quot; refer to a not fully grown specimen is problematic. Other clues can be derived from the construction of the hand. In &quot;Mylodon&quot;, for example, the metacarpal bones of the second and third ray are very delicate, in contrast to &quot;Glossotherium&quot;. A weakly pronounced central ray does not seem to support a digging activity, as this is usually most strongly developed in underground mammals. However, the distal articular facet of the third metacarpal bone is flat, which means that the middle finger is generally stiff and stable. The same articulation surface on the second metacarpal is significantly more rounded and thus supports greater mobility of the finger when gripping. This obviously resulted in functional differences between the individual rays of the hand. The rare signs of wear and tear on the last phalanx, which are isolated from the Cueva del Milodón several times, can serve as an additional indicator of digging activities.

=== Predation and Parasites ===
Especially in southern and southwestern Patagonia, numerous bone changes in finds of &quot;Mylodon&quot; can be proven to be caused by predatory animals. This includes, above all, the remains from the Cueva del Milodón in southwestern Chile. Some caves in their immediate vicinity, such as Cueva Lago Sofía 4 and Cueva Chica, are interpreted as clumps of predators. The same applies to the Cueva del Puma or the Cueva Fell in the Pali-Aike area of southern Chile. Some of the caves mainly contain smaller skeletal elements such as hand and foot bones or bone plates, which indicate that only part of the carcass was carried into the shelter. Whether this is the result of direct foraging or scavenging cannot be determined in many cases. Other caves, in turn, contained a larger proportion of young &quot;Mylodon&quot; animals. The largest predators occurring at that time are the puma and the jaguar, as well as the saber-toothed cat &quot;Smilodon populator&quot; and the extinct bear &quot;Arctotherium&quot;. The latter two could have reconstructed body weights of over 400 kg, with prey sizes between 1 and 2 t being assumed for the saber-toothed cat, which makes &quot;Smilodon&quot; a likely predator of &quot;Mylodon&quot;.

In various coprolites produced by &quot;Mylodon&quot;, eggs of nematodes are preserved. The eggs are ovaloid in shape with lengths of almost 50 μm in length and 29 μm in thickness. In addition, individual beetles could be detected.

== Extinction ==
&quot;Mylodon&quot; became extinct 12-10,000 years ago at the end of the Pleistocene as part of the Late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions, along with all other mainland ground sloths and most large animals in the Americas. The timing coincides with the arrival of humans in the Americas, as well as climatic change. There is evidence that humans exploited &quot;Mylodon&quot; for food. At Fell&#x27;s cave (Cueva Fell) in Chilean Patagonia, fractured and burned bones of &quot;Mylodon darwinii&quot; have been found in association with human artefacts, dating to around 12,766–12,354 calendar years Before Present (BP). At Piedra Museo in Argentine Patagonia, bones of &quot;Mylodon&quot; are found in association with human artefacts, dating to around 15,517–12,352 cal yr BP. This exploitation may have been a factor in its extinction.

<doc id="89071" wikidata="Q1250855" url="?curid=89071" title="Dory (boat)">
<text>A dory is a small, shallow-draft boat, about long. It is usually a lightweight boat with high sides, a flat bottom and sharp bows. It is easy to build because of its simple lines. For centuries, the dory has been used as a traditional fishing boat, both in coastal waters and in the open sea.

First recorded in 1700-10, Americanism; alleged to be from Miskito dóri, dúri; canoe or small round-bottomed boat, chiefly used in Central America and the Caribbean.

==Definition==
Strictly speaking, the only true defining characteristic of the dory is that it is planked with wide straight boards running fore-and-aft; &quot;It should be well understood, that it is the dory&#x27;s special mode of construction, not its hull shape, that sets it, and its related sub-types apart from other boats&quot;. More generally speaking, the dory can be defined as a small boat which has:
* a flat bottom, with the bottom planks fastened lengthwise (bow to stern).
* a hull shape defined by the natural curve of a sawn plank (never steam-bent).
* planks overlapping the stem at the front of the boat and an outer &quot;false&quot; stem covering the hood ends of the planks.
* (with some exceptions) a fairly narrow transom often referred to as the &quot;tombstone&quot; due to its unique shape.

The hull&#x27;s bottom is transversely flat and usually bowed fore-and-aft. (This curvature is known as &quot;rocker&quot;.) The stern is frequently a raked narrow transom that tapers sharply toward the bottom forming a nearly double-ended boat. The traditional bottom is made from planks laid fore and aft and not transverse, although some hulls have a second set of planks laid over the first in a pattern that is crosswise to the main hull for additional wear and strength.

Despite their simplicity of design, dories were known for their seaworthiness and rowing ease, although this reputation owed more to the skill of the operators than inherent factors in the design. Because of their narrow flat bottoms, they have little initial stability and are &quot;tippy&quot;. Traditionally, they were designed to carry large amounts of wet fish — often over a ton. They were commonly rowed by experienced seamen who understood the characteristics of the design and could compensate for the limitations. Dories exhibit high ultimate stability, tipping to a point and then stiffening up significantly and resisting further heel. By design they are quite voluminous and can carry a heavy load for their size. Their high sides give ample freeboard even when heavily loaded, and as the load increases, so does the stability.

==History==
With no clear definition of the type, and few early illustrations or detailed descriptions to go by, the early history of the dory is muddled at best. The first known mention of a dory in detail was in 1719. Until about 1870, there are to be found no recorded dory lines, details, nor any list of particulars that would enable us to say with certainty what the earlier dories were really like. In its most popular form, the dory was created in New England fishing towns sometime after the early 18th century. Howard Chapelle writes, &quot;... some kind of dory boat was in use on the Massachusetts coast as early as 1726.&quot; A definite precursor to the dory type was the early French bateau type, a flat bottom boat with straight sides used as early as 1671 on the Saint Lawrence River. The common coastal boat of the time was the wherry and the merging of designs between the wherry type and the simplified flat bottom construction of the bateau initiated the birth of the dory. Other anecdotal evidence exists of much older precursors throughout Europe. England, France, Belgium, and Italy all have small boats from the medieval periods that could reasonably be construed to be predecessors of the Dory.

Dories were widely built from Long Island Sound to Newfoundland.

In Nova Scotia, the towns of Lunenburg and Shelburne maintained a rivalry in mass production of dories. A distinction emerged in 1887 with the use in Shelburne of &quot;dory clips&quot;, metal braces used to join frames, versus the more expensive but stronger natural wood frames used in Lunenburg dories. The John Williams Dory Shop in Shelburne was one of several Shelburne factories mass-producing dories. It is now the Dory Shop Museum, operated by the Nova Scotia Museum and continues to produce banks dories.


The Dory Shop in Lunenburg first opened its doors in 1917 when W. Laurence Allen began building Banks Dories for the many fishing schooners that filled Lunenburg&#x27;s Harbour. Though ownership has changed hands a few times since then, they are still producing dories today using the very same jigs and patterns used 100 years ago. Very little has changed in the way they build their dories, however they now also build many other types of wooden boats as well and offer dory building classes for fishing history enthusiasts.

Today many Hollywood producers have employed the iconic form of the dory and they are choosing to use a traditional dory over many of the modern-styles of small wooden boats. Some more notable appearances of Lunenburg dories are in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;, at the opening scene when Captain Jack Sparrow steps off the mast of his ship Jolly Mon; the final scene in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End&quot; where Captain Jack is seen sailing away in a smaller Black Rocks dory; &quot;Reign III&quot; when King Francis and Queen Mary take a few days alone to sail together; &quot;Pirate Master&quot; Emmy Award-winning producer Mark Burnett&#x27;s tall ship based reality TV show; and many more!

==Traditional types==

===Beach dories===
The earliest known dories were beach dories developed for beach-launched fishing operations. The principal example is the Swampscott dory, named after Swampscott, Massachusetts where they were introduced. Early wherry types were modified with flat bottoms and borrowed construction techniques found in the French bateaus. This resulted in an almost-round-sided boat with a narrow flat bottom, well suited to launching through the surf and able to hold up against aggressive ocean conditions. The narrow &quot;tombstone&quot; transom assured that the boat rode well against a following sea or breaking surf, and also made the boat easy to row.

===Banks dories===


The Banks dory was an early dory, however, the preceded Swampscott dory preceded it by fifty years. The Banks dories first appeared in the 1830s and were probably the most numerous at their height of popularity. They were &quot;designed specifically as a ships boat but it became so well known and so common a type that it not only was used alongshore but influenced the design of some local fishing boats&quot;. Adapted almost directly from the low-freeboard French river bateaus, with their straight sides and removable thwarts, bank dories could be nested inside each other and stored on the decks of fishing schooners, for their trip to the Grand Banks and other fishing banks. They are not as handy or easy to row as the slightly more complicated Swampscott dories but were mass-produced in much larger numbers. Banks dories were also popular as work boats.

Although the Banks dory dates to the 1830s, it is not the first of its kind. The Swampscott dory preceded it by fifty years.

===Sailing dories===
As the need for working dories diminished, the Swampscott or beach dory types were modified for pleasure sailing. These sailing dories became quite popular at the beginning of the 20th century around the town of Marblehead, Massachusetts. They were generally longer, yet remained narrow with low freeboard and later were often decked over. Another common distinctive feature of the sailing dory was a long boom on the rig that angled up with a mainsail that was larger along the foot than the luff. The Townclass, a sailboat still raced today, is a late example of a sailing dory. Earlier types were the Beachcomber and Alpha series, built by the famed dory builder William Chamberlain, and raced extensively in Salem and Marblehead between 1900 and 1910.
Few of the original Chamberlain-designed dories remain intact. An original Alpha dory can be seen at the Marblehead Historical Museum in Marblehead, Massachusetts.

===River dories===
The western river dory, though sharing features with sea dories, is adapted for a different place and purpose. The key differentiating features are wider beam, more flare to prevent waves coming on board, and extensive built-in buoyancy/storage areas with water-resistant hatches to shed water and keep the boat afloat in the event of a capsize. The first small flat bottomed dory run of note on the Colorado River was made by Ramon Montez and George Flavell on an 1896 river cruise from Green River, Wyoming, through the Grand Canyon to Temple Bar, Arizona. Western river dories have additional special features such as strong rowlocks, long oars, and long blade oars to operate in the highly aerated waters in rapids. In rapids the master rower faces down river to see the rock and or hydraulic obstacles. In a rapid the oars are often used to steer the boat as well as to propel it. The first documentation of this &quot;stern first&quot; technique in Grand Canyon was by George Flavell in 1896. Credit for the &quot;stern first&quot; technique is often given to Nathaniel Galloway who used it on his cruise through Grand Canyon a few months after the Flavell-Montez cruise.

===Motor dories===
With the introduction of the outboard motor the &quot;semi-dory&quot; or &quot;half-dory&quot; was developed. Because typical dory bottoms are so narrow, the thrust of an outboard motor pushes the stern of the dory down creating a very unstable and inefficient boat. The semi-dory is basically a Swampscott dory with the stern widened and the rocker straightened aft to support the thrust of the outboard motor.

===Other dories, and related types===
Other, less but traditional types were the double ended surf and gunning dories. The pointed bow and sterns made these boats excel at launching through the surf. Gunning dories were built quite light in comparison to the more traditionally constructed beach dories.

The &quot;dory skiff&quot; is another variation of the dory type. For inshore work the transom was widened, and freeboard was lowered making an exceptionally easy-to-row boat that was more stable (initial stability not ultimate stability) than their offshore cousins. However, they are not as seaworthy as the Swampscott or Banks dories.

The Gandelow, much like a dory design from midships forward, is native to the Shannon estuary in Ireland. The main difference is that, at the stern, the gandelow has upper &#x27;butterfly planks&#x27; which are twisted to make the stern wider and more buoyant, while the lower planks, twisted opposite, form a hollow boxed skeg, much like a Sea Bright Skiff. The space created, when covered, provides a netlocker and a platform.

The cot, a protean Irish traditional boat, has variants quite similar to dories, although some have a transom bow as well as stern, resembling a jonboat. (The boat name originated as a word for an open dugout canoe, &quot;coit&quot;, but became used for many types of small open boats.)

The dory type spread by contact among fishing fleets, and was naturalized in many countries.


==Modern interpretations==
In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in the dory style. Many contemporary marine architects and backyard amateurs have been experimenting with the dory type and refining the type to some extent. These boats are designed primarily for pleasure and use new building materials and techniques not available to the originators of the dory. The basic form remains ensuring the survival and growth of the type. New England is no longer the center of dory construction and dories have been built all over the world. Modern dory designers include Phil Bolger of Gloucester, and John Welsford of New Zealand.

Most modern dories are about long, built of lightweight plywood, fastened by fibreglass tape and epoxy resin. They are much lighter than traditional dories and compensate for the lack of initial stability by having slightly wider bottoms and very low [ high] seats and are fitted with skegs for directional stability. Welsford recommends the carrying of a water container on a rope that can be thrown to the bow or stern to adjust trim in different sea conditions. Unlike a conventional wide bottom dinghy it is dangerous to sit or stand in the extreme ends due to the minimal displacement. Modern designs, like their traditional counterparts, gain significant stability when heavily laden amidships.

<text>The kea ( ; ; Nestor notabilis) is a species of large parrot in the family Strigopidae that is endemic to the forested and alpine regions of the South Island of New Zealand. About long, it is mostly olive-green, with brilliant orange under its wings and has a large, narrow, curved, grey-brown upper beak. Its omnivorous diet consists mainly of roots, leaves, berries, nectar, and insects, but also includes carrion. It was once killed for bounty due to concern by sheep-farmers that it attacked livestock, especially sheep. The kea is now uncommon, and received absolute protection under the Wildlife Act in 1986.

The kea nests in burrows or crevices among the roots of trees. Kea are known for their intelligence and curiosity, both vital to their survival in a harsh mountain environment. Kea can solve logical puzzles, such as pushing and pulling things in a certain order to get to food, and will work together to achieve a certain objective. They have been filmed preparing and using tools.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The kea was described by ornithologist John Gould in 1856, from two specimens shown to him by Walter Mantell, who obtained the birds in Murihiku. Eight years earlier, some elderly Māori had told Mantell about the bird, and how it used to visit the coast in winter but had not been seen in recent times. Mantell subsequently investigated and obtained the birds.

The kea&#x27;s Latin binomial specific epithet, &quot;notabilis&quot;, means &#x27;noteworthy&#x27;. The common name kea is from Māori, probably an onomatopoeic representation of their in-flight call – &#x27;keee aaa&#x27;. In New Zealand English, the word &quot;kea&quot; is both singular and plural. The collective noun is a circus or conspiracy of kea. 

The genus &quot;Nestor&quot; contains four species: the New Zealand kākā (&quot;Nestor meridionalis&quot;), the kea (&quot;N. notabilis&quot;), the extinct Norfolk kākā (&quot;N. productus&quot;), and the extinct Chatham kākā (&quot;N. chathamensis&quot;). All four are thought to stem from a &quot;proto-kākā&quot;, dwelling in the forests of New Zealand five million years ago. Their closest relative is the flightless kākāpō (&quot;Strigops habroptilus&quot;). Together, they form the parrot superfamily Strigopoidea, an ancient group that split off from all other Psittacidae before their radiation.

==Description==

The kea is a large parrot measuring in total length, with some specimens possibly reaching . Adult kea weigh between , with males averaging and females averaging . One source listed the mean adult weight as It has mostly olive-green plumage with a grey beak having a long, narrow, curved upper beak. The adult has dark-brown irises, and the cere, eyerings, and legs are grey. It has orange feathers on the undersides of its wings. The feathers on the sides of its face are dark olive-brown, the ones on its back and rump are orange-red, and some of the outer wing feathers are dull blue. It has a short, broad, bluish-green tail with a black tip. Feather shafts project at the tip of the tail and the undersides of the inner tail feathers have yellow-orange transverse stripes. The male is about 5% longer than the female, and the male&#x27;s upper beak is 12–14% longer than the female&#x27;s. Juveniles generally resemble adults, but have yellow eyerings and cere, an orange-yellow lower beak, and grey-yellow legs.

==Distribution and habitat==
The kea is one of nine living endemic parrot species in New Zealand.
The kea ranges from lowland river valleys and coastal forests of the South Island&#x27;s west coast up to alpine regions of the South Island such as Arthur&#x27;s Pass and Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park. It is closely associated throughout its range with the southern beech (&quot;Nothofagus&quot;) forests in the alpine ridge.

Apart from occasional vagrants, kea today are not found in the North Island. Subfossil kea bones have been found in sand dunes at Mataikona in the eastern Wairarapa, Poukawa near Hastings, and Waitomo, indicating that they ranged through lowland forest over much of the North Island until the arrival of Polynesian settlers about 750 years ago. Kea subfossils are not restricted to alpine areas, being commonly found in lowland or coastal sites in the South Island. The current distribution of kea reflects the effects of mammalian predators, including humans, which have driven them out of lowland forests into the mountains.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
At least one observer has reported that the kea is polygynous, with one male attached to multiple females. The same source also noted that there was a surplus of females.

Kea are social and live in groups of up to 13 birds. Isolated individuals do badly in captivity, but respond well to seeing themselves in a mirror.
In one study, nest sites occur at a density of one per . The breeding areas are most commonly in southern beech (&quot;Nothofagus&quot;) forests, located on steep mountainsides. Breeding at heights of above sea level and higher, it is one of the few parrot species in the world to regularly spend time above the tree line. Nest sites are usually positioned on the ground underneath large beech trees, in rock crevices, or dug burrows between roots. They are accessed by tunnels leading back into a larger chamber, which is furnished with lichens, moss, ferns, and rotting wood. The laying period starts in July and reaches into January. Two to five white eggs are laid, with an incubation time of around 21 days, and a brooding period of 94 days.

Mortality is high among young kea, with less than 40% surviving their first year. The median lifespan of a wild subadult kea has been estimated at five years, based on the proportion of kea seen again in successive seasons in Arthur&#x27;s Pass, and allowing for some emigration to surrounding areas. Around 10% of the local kea population were expected to be over 20 years of age. The oldest known captive kea was 50 years old in 2008.

===Cognitive abilities===
Kea parrots have strong cognitive abilities. According to recent studies, Kea share the ability to have sense of impulsive control and planning forward. Kea can wait up to 160 seconds for a more preferred reward. In addition, Kea also use trial and error tactics and use observational learning to solve difficult problems and when tasked with puzzles and locks. These abilities of decision-making are similar to primates and other intelligent bird species like the African grey parrot.

===Diet and feeding===
An omnivore, the kea feeds on more than 40 plant species, beetle larvae, grasshoppers, land snails, other birds (including shearwater chicks), and mammals (including sheep, rabbits and mice). It has been observed breaking open shearwater nests to feed on the chicks after hearing the chicks in their nests. It enjoys the flesh and bone marrow from carcasses. The kea has also taken advantage of human garbage and &quot;gifts&quot; of food.

Tool use behavior has been observed in this species, wherein a bird named Bruce, who has a broken upper beak, wedged pebbles between his tongue and lower mandible and then utilized this arrangement to aid with his preening habits.

====Sheep====

The controversy about whether the kea preys on sheep is long-running. Sheep suffering from unusual wounds on their sides or loins were noticed by the mid-1860s, within a decade of sheep farmers moving into the high country. Although some supposed the cause was a new disease, suspicion soon fell on the kea. James MacDonald, head shepherd at Wanaka Station, witnessed a kea attacking a sheep in 1868, and similar accounts were widespread. Prominent members of the scientific community accepted that kea attacked sheep, with Alfred Wallace citing this as an example of behavioural change in his 1889 book &quot;Darwinism&quot;. Thomas Potts noted that attacks were most frequent during winter and snow-bound sheep with two years growth in their fleece were the most vulnerable, while newly-shorn sheep in warm weather were rarely molested.

Despite substantial anecdotal evidence of sheep attacks, others remained unconvinced, especially in later years. For instance, in 1962, animal specialist J.R. Jackson concluded, while the bird may attack sick or injured sheep, especially if it mistook them for dead, it was not a significant predator. In August 1992, however, its nocturnal assaults were captured on video, proving that at least some kea will attack and feed on healthy sheep. The video confirmed what many scientists had long suspected: that the kea uses its powerful, curved beak and claws to rip through the layer of wool and eat the fat from the back of the animal. Though the bird does not directly kill the sheep, death can result from infections or accidents suffered by animals when trying to escape.

Since kea are now a protected species, their depredations are generally tolerated by sheep farmers, though why some kea attack sheep, and others do not, remains unclear. Various theories, including similarities with existing food sources, curiosity, entertainment, hunger, maggots as well as a progression from scavenging dead sheep and hides have all been put forward as to how the behaviour was first acquired. Anecdotal evidence also suggests only particular birds have learned the behaviour, with identification and removal of those individuals being sufficient to control the problem.

There are also anecdotal reports of kea attacking rabbits, dogs, and even horses. There are also suggestions that kea used to feed on moa in a similar way.

==Relationship with humans==
Kea, which are social, have been found to have a level of high cognitive ability, with the capacity to solve complex tasks. This curiosity and urge to explore and investigate makes this bird both a pest for residents and an attraction for tourists. In 2017 the kea was voted New Zealand Bird of the Year in a campaign to raise awareness about the country&#x27;s endangered wildlife.

Called &quot;the clown of the mountains&quot;, it will investigate backpacks, boots, skis, snowboards, and even cars, often causing damage or flying off with smaller items. Kea have been kept as pets before being protected, but rarely, since they were difficult to capture and destructive when in captivity.

People commonly encounter wild kea at South Island ski areas, where they are attracted by the prospect of food scraps. Their curiosity leads them to peck and carry away unguarded items of clothing, or to pry apart rubber parts of cars – to the entertainment and annoyance of human observers. They are often described as &quot;cheeky&quot;. A kea has even been reported to have made off with the passport of a tourist who was visiting Fiordland National Park.

The Department of Conservation also suggested that the time savings resulting from a more calorie-rich diet will give kea more free time to investigate and hence damage things at campsites and car parks.

The birds&#x27; naturally trusting behaviour around humans has also been indicated as a contributing factor in a number of recent incidents at popular tourist spots where kea have been purposely killed.

Kea were eaten by Māori. They were believed by the Waitaha tribe to be kaitiaki (guardians).

===Cultural references===
The kea featured on the reverse side of the New Zealand $10 note between 1967 and 1992, when it was replaced with the blue duck (whio).

Kea are the protagonists in New Zealand author Philip Temple&#x27;s novels &quot;Beak of the Moon&quot; (1981) and &quot;Dark of the Moon&quot; (1993), recounting respectively the first encounters of a group of kea with humans at the time of the colonisation of the South Island by Māori, and their life in present-day, human-dominated New Zealand. Sentient Kea also features as prominent characters in the Orson Scott Card novel &quot;The Last Shadow&quot;.

The youngest section of Scouts New Zealand (known as Beavers in the United Kingdom and Joeys in Australia) is named after the bird.

In the video game &quot;Dwarf Fortress&quot;, kea are one of many species of animals that will steal the player&#x27;s items.

===Threats===
Together with local councils and runholders, the New Zealand government paid a bounty for kea bills because the bird preyed upon livestock, mainly sheep. It was intended that hunters would kill kea only on the farms and council areas that paid the bounty, but some hunted them in national parks and in Westland, where they were officially protected. More than 150,000 were killed in the hundred years before 1970, when the bounty was lifted.

A study of kea numbers in Nelson Lakes National Park showed a substantial decline in the population between 1999 and 2009, caused primarily by predation of kea eggs and chicks. Video cameras set up to monitor kea nests in South Westland showed that possums killed kea fledglings.

Lead poisoning, mostly from the roofs of buildings/building materials, is also a significant cause of premature deaths among kea. Research on lead toxicity in kea living at Aoraki / Mount Cook found that of 38 live kea tested all were found to have detectable blood lead levels, 26 considered dangerously high. Additional analysis of 15 dead kea sent to Massey University for diagnostic pathology between 1991 and 1997 found 9 bodies to have lead blood levels consistent with causing death. Research conducted by Victoria University in 2008 confirmed that the natural curiosity of kea which has enabled the species to adapt to its extreme environment, may increase its propensity to poisoning through ingestion of lead – i.e. the more investigative behaviours identified in a bird, the higher its blood lead levels were likely to be.

The 1080 pesticide is used to control invasive pest mammals such as stoats and possums and has also been implicated in kea deaths. For example, seven kea were found dead following an aerial possum control operation using 1080, at Fox Glacier in July 2008 and a further seven had been found dead in August 2011, following a 1080 aerial possum control operation in Ōkārito Forest. Traps are also considered a risk to kea. In September 2011, hidden cameras caught kea breaking into baited stoat traps in the Matukituki Valley. More than 75% of the traps had been sprung.

===Conservation===
In the 1970s, the kea received partial protection after a census counted only 5,000 birds. The government agreed to investigate any reports of problem birds and have them removed from the land. In 1986 it was given absolute protection under the Wildlife Act 1953. Kea are also listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) meaning international export/import (including parts and derivatives) is regulated.

Despite being classified as Nationally Endangered in the New Zealand Threat Classification System and endangered in the IUCN Red List and protected by law, kea are still deliberately shot. For example, in the late 1990s, a Fox Glacier resident killed 33 kea in the glacier car park and in 2008, two kea were shot in Arthur&#x27;s Pass and stapled to a sign.

Kea deaths due to traffic have prompted the NZ Transport Agency to install signs to help raise awareness, and to encourage people to slow down if necessary. In Fiordland National Park, there have been concerns that kea are particularly at risk from road traffic at the entrance to the Homer Tunnel. Kea have been regularly observed on the roadway, moving amongst vehicles waiting to pass through the one-way tunnel. People feeding the birds was one cause of the problem. In 2017, a gym for kea was built near the Homer tunnel entrance, in an attempt to lure the birds away from the road.

A citizen science project called the &quot;Kea Database&quot; was launched in 2017 that allows for the recording of kea observations to an online database. If the recorded kea are banded, it is possible to match observations with individual named birds, enabling the monitoring of the habits and behaviour of individual kea.

Some are calling for kea to be reintroduced into predator-free zones on the North Island. A former curator of Natural History at Whanganui Regional Museum, Dr Mike Dickison, told &quot;North &amp; South&quot; magazine in the October 2018 issue that the birds would do well on Mount Ruapehu.

Kea conservation is supported by the NGO Kea Conservation Trust, founded in 2006 to protect kea.

The total kea population was estimated at between 1,000 and 5,000 individuals in 1986, contrasting with another estimate of 15,000 birds in 1992. The kea&#x27;s widespread distribution at low density across inaccessible areas prevents accurate estimates. Estimates published in 2017 suggest a population of between 3000 and 7000 individuals.

<text>The kākāpō (; : ; Strigops habroptilus), sometimes known as the owl parrot or owl-faced parrot, is a species of large, nocturnal, ground-dwelling parrot of the superfamily Strigopoidea. It is endemic to New Zealand.

Kākāpō can be up to long. They have a combination of unique traits among parrots: finely blotched yellow-green plumage, a distinct facial disc, owl-style forward-facing eyes with surrounding discs of specially-textured feathers, a large grey beak, short legs, large blue feet, relatively short wings and a short tail. It is the world&#x27;s only flightless parrot, the world&#x27;s heaviest parrot, and also is nocturnal, herbivorous, visibly sexually dimorphic in body size, has a low basal metabolic rate, and does not have male parental care. It is the only parrot to have a polygynous lek breeding system. It is also possibly one of the world&#x27;s longest-living birds, with a reported lifespan of up to 100 years. Adult males weigh around ; the equivalent figure for females is .

The anatomy of the kākāpō typifies the tendency of bird-evolution on oceanic islands. With few predators and abundant food, kākāpō exhibit island syndrome development, having a generally-robust torso physique at the expense of flight abilities, resulting in reduced shoulder- and wing-muscles, along with a diminished keel on the sternum. Like many other New Zealand bird species, the kākāpō was historically important to Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand. It appears in Māori mythology. Heavily hunted in the past, it was used by the Māori both for its meat and for its feathers.

The kākāpō is critically endangered; the total known population of living individuals is Known individuals are named, tagged and confined to four small New Zealand islands, all of which are clear of predators; however, in 2023, a reintroduction to mainland New Zealand (Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari) was accomplished. Introduced mammalian predators, such as cats, rats, ferrets, and stoats almost wiped out the kākāpō. All conservation efforts were unsuccessful until the Kākāpō Recovery Programme began in 1995.

==Taxonomy==
The kākāpō was formally described and illustrated in 1845 by the English ornithologist George Robert Gray. He created a new genus and coined the binomial name . Gray was uncertain about the origin of his specimen and wrote, &quot;This remarkable bird is found in one of the islands of the South Pacific Ocean.&quot; The type location has been designated as Dusky Sound on the southwest corner of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek , genitive (&quot;owl&quot;), and (&quot;face&quot;), while its specific epithet comes from (&quot;soft&quot;), and (&quot;feather&quot;).

In 1955 the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) ruled that the genus name was feminine. Based on this ruling many ornithologists used the form &quot;Strigops habroptila&quot; but in 2023 James L. Savage and Andrew Digby argued that under the current ICZN rules the specific epithet should be &quot;habroptilus&quot;. This view was accepted by ornithologists and in 2024 the International Ornithological Congress Checklist and the eBird/Clements Checklist changed the spelling of the binomial name back to &quot;Strigops habroptilus&quot;. The species is monotypic, as no subspecies are recognised.

The name is Māori, from (&quot;parrot&quot;) + (&quot;night&quot;); the name is both singular and plural. &quot;Kākāpō&quot; is increasingly written in New Zealand English with the macrons that indicate long vowels. The correct pronunciation in Māori is ; other colloquial pronunciations exist, however. These include the British English (), as defined in the Chambers Dictionary in 2003. 

The kākāpō is placed in the family Strigopidae together with the two species in the genus &quot;Nestor&quot;, the kea () and the kākā (). The birds are endemic to New Zealand. Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the family Strigopidae is basal to the other three parrot families in the order Psittaciformes and diverged from them 33–44 million years ago. The common ancestor of the kākāpō and the two &quot;Nestor&quot; species diverged 27–40 million years ago.

Earlier ornithologists felt that the kākāpō might be related to the ground parrots and night parrot of Australia due to their similar colouration, but this is contradicted by molecular studies; rather, the cryptic colour seems to be adaptation to terrestrial habits that evolved twice convergently.

==Description==

The kākāpō is a large, rotund parrot. Adults can measure from in length with a wingspan of . Males are significantly heavier than females with an average weight of compared with just for females. Kākāpō are the heaviest living species of parrot and on average weigh about more than the largest flying parrot, the hyacinth macaw.

The kākāpō cannot fly, having relatively short wings for its size and lacking the keel on the sternum (breastbone), where the flight muscles of other birds attach. It uses its wings for balance and to break its fall when leaping from trees. Unlike many other land birds, the kākāpō can accumulate large amounts of body fat.

The upper parts of the kākāpō have yellowish moss-green feathers barred or mottled with black or dark brownish grey, blending well with native vegetation. Individuals may have strongly varying degrees of mottling and colour tone and intensity – museum specimens show that some birds had completely yellow colouring. The breast and flank are yellowish-green streaked with yellow. The belly, undertail, neck, and face are predominantly yellowish streaked with pale green and weakly mottled with brownish-grey. Because the feathers do not need the strength and stiffness required for flight, they are exceptionally soft, giving rise to the specific epithet &quot;habroptila&quot;. The kākāpō has a conspicuous facial disc of fine feathers resembling the face of an owl; thus, early European settlers called it the &quot;owl parrot&quot;. The beak is surrounded by delicate feathers which resemble vibrissae or &quot;whiskers&quot;; it is possible kākāpō use these to sense the ground as they walk with its head lowered, but there is no evidence for this. The mandible is variable in colour, mostly ivory, with the upper part often bluish-grey. The eyes are dark brown. Kākāpō feet are large, scaly, and, as in all parrots, zygodactyl (two toes face forward and two backward). The pronounced claws are particularly useful for climbing. The ends of the tail feathers often become worn from being continually dragged on the ground.

Females are easily distinguished from males as they have a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller cere and nostrils, more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not very different from that of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. Nesting females also have a brood patch of bare skin on the belly.

The kākāpō&#x27;s altricial young are first covered with greyish white down, through which their pink skin can be easily seen. They become fully feathered at approximately 70 days old. Juvenile individuals tend to have duller green colouration, more uniform black barring, and less yellow present in their feathers. They are additionally distinguishable because of their shorter tails, wings, and beaks. At this stage, they have a ring of short feathers surrounding their irises that resembles eyelashes.

Like many other parrots, kākāpō have a variety of calls. As well as the &quot;booms&quot; (see below for a recording) and &quot;chings&quot; of their mating calls, they will often loudly &quot;skraark&quot;.

The kākāpō has a well-developed sense of smell, which complements its nocturnal lifestyle. It can distinguish between odours while foraging, a behaviour reported in only one other parrot species. The kākāpō has a large olfactory bulb ratio (longest diameter of the olfactory bulb/longest diameter of the brain) indicating that it does, indeed, have a more developed sense of smell than other parrots. One of the most striking characteristics of the kākāpō is its distinct musty-sweet odour. The smell often alerts predators to the presence of kākāpō.

As a nocturnal species, the kākāpō has adapted its senses to living in darkness. Its optic tectum, nucleus rotundus, and entopallium are smaller in relation to its overall brain size than those of diurnal parrots. Its retina shares some qualities with that of other nocturnal birds but also has some qualities typical of diurnal birds, lending to best function around twilight. These modifications allow the kākāpō to have enhanced light sensitivity but with poor visual acuity.

===Internal anatomy===
The skeleton of the kākāpō differs from other parrots in several features associated with flightlessness. Firstly, it has the smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal barbules to lock the feathers together. The sternum is small and has a low, vestigial keel and a shortened spina externa. As in other flightless birds and some flighted parrots, the furcula is not fused but consists of a pair of clavicles lying in contact with each coracoid. As in other flightless birds, the angle between the coracoid and sternum is enlarged. The kākāpō has a larger pelvis than other parrots. The proximal bones of the leg and wing are disproportionately long and the distal elements are disproportionately short.

The pectoral musculature of the kākāpō is also modified by flightlessness. The pectoralis and supracoracoideus muscles are greatly reduced. The propatagialis tendo longus has no distinct muscle belly. The sternocoracoideus is tendinous. There is an extensive cucularis capitis clavicularis muscle that is associated with the large crop.

===Genetics===
Because kākāpō passed through a genetic bottleneck, in which their world population was reduced to 49 birds, they are extremely inbred and have low genetic diversity. This manifests in lower disease resistance and in fertility problems: 61% of kākāpō eggs fail to hatch. Beginning in 2015, the Kākāpō 125+ project has sequenced the genome of all living kākāpō, as well as some museum specimens. The project is a collaboration led by Genomics Aotearoa and a collaboration with a team of international collaborators.

A DNA sequence analysis was performed on 35 kākāpō genomes of the surviving descendants of an isolated island population, and on 14 genomes, mainly from museum specimens, of the now extinct mainland population. An analysis of the long-term genetic impact of small population size indicated that the small island kākāpō population had a reduced number of harmful mutations compared to the number in mainland individuals. It was hypothesized that the reduced mutational load of the island population was due to a combination of genetic drift and the purging of deleterious mutations through increased inbreeding and purifying selection that occurred since the isolation of this population from the mainland about 10,000 years ago. Purging of deleterious mutations occurs when there is selection against recessive or partially recessive detrimental alleles as they are expressed in the homozygous state.

== Habitat ==
Before the arrival of humans, the kākāpō was distributed throughout both main islands of New Zealand. Although it may have inhabited Stewart Island / Rakiura before human arrival, it has not been found in the extensive fossil collections from there. Kākāpō lived in a variety of habitats, including tussocklands, scrublands and coastal areas. It also inhabited forests dominated by podocarps (rimu, mataī, kahikatea, tōtara), beeches, tawa, and rātā. In Fiordland, areas of avalanche and slip debris with regenerating and heavily fruiting vegetation – such as five finger, wineberry, bush lawyer, tutu, hebes, and coprosmas – became known as &quot;kākāpō gardens&quot;.

The kākāpō is considered to be a &quot;habitat generalist&quot;. Though they are now confined to islands free of predation, they were once able to live in nearly any climate present on the islands of New Zealand. They survived dry, hot summers on the North Island as well as cold winter temperatures in the sub-alpine areas of Fiordland. Kākāpō seem to have preferred broadleaf or mountain beech and Hall&#x27;s tōtara forest with mild winters and high rainfall, but the species was not exclusively forest-dwelling.

==Ecology and behaviour==

The kākāpō is primarily nocturnal; it roosts under cover in trees or on the ground during the day and moves around its territories at night.

Though the kākāpō cannot fly, it is an excellent climber, ascending to the crowns of the tallest trees. It can also &quot;parachute&quot; – descending by leaping and spreading its wings. In this way it may travel a few metres at an angle of less than 45 degrees. With only 3.3% of its mass made up of pectoral muscle, it is no surprise that the kākāpō cannot use its wings to lift its heavy body off the ground. Because of its flightlessness, it has very low metabolic demands in comparison to flighted birds. It is able to survive easily on very little or on very low quality food sources. Unlike most other bird species, the kākāpō is entirely herbivorous, feeding on fruits, seeds, leaves, stems, and rhizomes. When foraging, kākāpō tend to leave crescent-shaped wads of fiber in the vegetation behind them, called &quot;browse signs&quot;.

Having lost the ability to fly, it has developed strong legs. Locomotion is often by way of a rapid &quot;jog-like&quot; gait by which it can move several kilometres. A female has been observed making two return trips each night during nesting from her nest to a food source up to away and the male may walk from its home range to a mating arena up to away during the mating season (October–January).
 
Young birds indulge in play fighting, and one bird will often lock the neck of another under its chin. The kākāpō is curious by nature and has been known to interact with humans. Conservation staff and volunteers have engaged extensively with some kākāpō, which have distinct personalities. Despite this, kākāpō are solitary birds.

The kākāpō was a very successful species in pre-human New Zealand, and was well adapted to avoid the birds of prey which were their only predators. As well as the New Zealand falcon, there were two other birds of prey in pre-human New Zealand: Haast&#x27;s eagle and Eyles&#x27; harrier. All these raptors soared overhead searching for prey in daylight, and to avoid them the kākāpō evolved camouflaged plumage and became nocturnal. When a kākāpō feels threatened, it freezes, so that it is more effectively camouflaged in the vegetation its plumage resembles. Kākāpō were not entirely safe at night, when the laughing owl was active, and it is apparent from owl nest deposits on Canterbury limestone cliffs that kākāpō were among their prey.

Kākāpō defensive adaptations were no use, however, against the mammalian predators introduced to New Zealand by humans. Birds hunt very differently from mammals, relying on their powerful vision to find prey, and thus they usually hunt by day. Mammalian predators, in contrast to birds, often hunt by night, and rely on their sense of smell and hearing to find prey; a common way for humans to hunt kākāpō was by releasing trained dogs. 

===Breeding===
Kākāpō are the only flightless bird that has a lek breeding system. Males loosely gather in an arena and compete with each other to attract females. Females listen to the males as they display, or &quot;lek&quot;. They choose a mate based on the quality of his display; they are not pursued by the males in any overt way. No pair bond is formed; males and females meet only to mate.

During the courting season, males leave their home ranges for hilltops and ridges where they establish their own mating courts. These leks can be up to from a kākāpō&#x27;s usual territory and are an average of apart within the lek arena. Males remain in the region of their court throughout the courting season. At the start of the breeding season, males will fight to try to secure the best courts. They confront each other with raised feathers, spread wings, open beaks, raised claws and loud screeching and growling. Fighting may leave birds with injuries or even kill them. Mating occurs only approximately every five years, with the ripening of the rimu fruit. In mating years, males may make &quot;booming&quot; calls for 6–8 hours every night for more than four months.
Each court consists of one or more saucer-shaped depressions or &quot;bowls&quot; dug in the ground by the male, up to deep and long enough to fit the half-metre length of the bird. The kākāpō is one of only a handful of birds in the world which actually constructs its leks. Bowls are often created next to rock faces, banks, or tree trunks to help reflect sound: the bowls themselves function as amplifiers to enhance the projection of the males&#x27; booming mating calls. Each male&#x27;s bowls are connected by a network of trails or tracks which may extend along a ridge or in diameter around a hilltop. Males meticulously clear their bowls and tracks of debris.

To attract females, males make loud, low-frequency (below 100Hz) booming calls from their bowls by inflating a thoracic sac. They start with low grunts, which increase in volume as the sac inflates. After a sequence of about 20 loud booms, the male kākāpō emits a high-frequency, metallic &quot;ching&quot; sound. He stands for a short while before again lowering his head, inflating his chest and starting another sequence of booms. The booms can be heard at least away on a still night; wind can carry the sound at least . 

Females are attracted by the booms of the competing males; they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court of one of the males, the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak. He turns his back to the female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. He will then attempt copulation for 40 minutes or more. Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female.
The female kākāpō lays 1–4 eggs per breeding cycle, with several days between eggs. The nest is placed on the ground under the cover of plants or in cavities such as hollow tree trunks. The female incubates the eggs beginning after the first egg is laid, but is forced to leave the nest every night in search of food. Predators are known to eat the eggs, and the embryos inside can also die of cold in the mother&#x27;s absence. Kākāpō eggs usually hatch within 30 days, bearing fluffy grey chicks that are quite helpless. The female feeds the chicks for three months, and the chicks remain with the female for some months after fledging. The young chicks are just as vulnerable to predators as the eggs, and young have been killed by many of the same predators that attack adults. Chicks leave the nest at approximately 10 to 12 weeks of age. As they gain greater independence, their mothers may feed the chicks sporadically for up to 3 months.

The kākāpō is long-lived, with an average life expectancy of 60 (plus or minus 20) years, and tends to reach adolescence before it starts breeding. Males start booming at about 5 years of age. It was thought that females reached sexual maturity at 9 years of age, but four five-year-old females have now been recorded reproducing. The kākāpō does not breed every year and has one of the lowest rates of reproduction among birds. Breeding occurs only in years when trees mast (fruit heavily), providing a plentiful food supply. Rimu mast occurs only every three to five years, so in rimu-dominant forests, such as those on Whenua Hou, kākāpō breeding occurs as infrequently.

Another aspect of the kākāpō&#x27;s breeding system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female in good condition produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kākāpō will likely be able to produce eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kākāpō will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.

===Feeding===
The beak of the kākāpō is adapted for grinding food finely. For this reason, the kākāpō has a very small gizzard compared to other birds of their size. It is entirely herbivorous, eating native plants, seeds, fruits, pollen, fungi and even the sapwood of trees. A study in 1984 identified 25 plant species as kākāpō food. It is specifically fond of the fruit of the rimu tree, and will feed on it exclusively during seasons when it is abundant. The kākāpō strips out the nutritious parts of the plant out with its beak, leaving a ball of indigestible fibre. These little clumps of plant fibres are a distinctive sign of the presence of the bird. The kākāpō is believed to employ bacteria in the fore-gut to ferment and help digest plant matter.

Kākāpō diet changes according to the season. The plants eaten most frequently during the year include some species of &quot;Lycopodium ramulosum&quot;, &quot;Lycopodium fastigium&quot;, &quot;Schizaea fistulosa&quot;, &quot;Blechnum minus&quot;, &quot;Blechnum procerum&quot;, &quot;Cyathodes juniperina&quot;, &quot;Dracophyllum longifolium&quot;, &quot;Olearia colensoi&quot; and &quot;Thelymitra venosa&quot;. Individual plants of the same species are often treated differently. Kākāpō may forage heavily in certain areas, leaving, on occasion, more than 30 droppings and conspicuous evidence of herbivory. These areas, which are mostly dominated by mānuka and yellow silver pine, range from 100 – 5,000 sq. metres (1,076 – 53,820 sq. feet) per individual.

Preserved coprolites of kākāpō have been studied to obtain information on the historic diet of the bird. This research has identified 67 native plant genera previously unrecorded as food sources for kākāpō including native mistletoes as well as &quot;Dactylanthus taylorii&quot;.

==Conservation==
Fossil records indicate that in pre-Polynesian times, the kākāpō was New Zealand&#x27;s third most common bird and it was widespread on all three main islands. However, the kākāpō population in New Zealand has declined massively since human settlement of the country, and its conservation status as ranked by the Department of Conservation continues to be &quot;Nationally Critical&quot;. Since the 1890s, conservation efforts have been made to prevent extinction. The most successful scheme has been the Kākāpō Recovery Programme; this was implemented in 1995 and continues to this day.
Kākāpō are absolutely protected under New Zealand&#x27;s Wildlife Act 1953. The species is also listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) meaning international export/import (including parts and derivatives) is regulated.

===Human impact===

The first factor in the decline of the kākāpō was the arrival of humans. Māori folklore suggests that the kākāpō was found throughout the country when the Polynesians first arrived in Aotearoa 700 years ago. Subfossil and midden deposits show that the bird was present throughout the North and South Island before and during early Māori times. Māori hunted the kākāpō for food and for their skins and feathers, which were made into cloaks.

Due to its inability to fly, strong scent and habit of freezing when threatened, the kākāpō was easy prey for the Māori and their dogs. Its eggs and chicks were also preyed upon by the Polynesian rat or kiore, which the Māori brought to New Zealand as a stowaway. Furthermore, the deliberate clearing of vegetation by Māori reduced the habitable range for kākāpō. Although the kākāpō was extinct in many parts of the islands by the time Europeans arrived, including the Tararua and Aorangi Ranges, it was locally abundant in parts of New Zealand, such as the central North Island and forested parts of the South Island.

Although kākāpō numbers were reduced by Māori settlement, they declined much more rapidly after European colonisation. Beginning in the 1840s, Pākehā settlers cleared vast tracts of land for farming and grazing, further reducing kākāpō habitat. They brought more dogs and other mammalian predators, including domestic cats, black rats and stoats. 

In the 1880s, large numbers of mustelids (stoats, ferrets and weasels) were released in New Zealand to reduce rabbit numbers, but they also preyed heavily on many native species including the kākāpō. Other browsing animals, such as introduced deer, competed with the kākāpō for food, and caused the extinction of some of its preferred plant species. The kākāpō was reportedly still present near the head of the Whanganui River as late as 1894, with one of the last records of a kākāpō in the North Island being a single bird caught in the Kaimanawa Ranges by Te Kepa Puawheawhe in 1895.

===Early protection efforts===
In 1891, the New Zealand government set aside Resolution Island in Fiordland as a nature reserve. In 1894, the government appointed Richard Henry as caretaker. A keen naturalist, Henry was aware that native birds were declining, and began catching and moving kākāpō and kiwi from the mainland to the predator-free Resolution Island. In six years, he moved more than 200 kākāpō to Resolution Island. By 1900, however, stoats had swum to Resolution Island and colonised it; they wiped out the nascent kākāpō population within 6 years.

In 1903, three kākāpō were moved from Resolution Island to the nature reserve of Little Barrier Island (Hauturu-o-Toi) north-east of Auckland, but feral cats were present and the kākāpō were never seen again. In 1912, three kākāpō were moved to another reserve, Kapiti Island, north-west of Wellington. One of them survived until at least 1936, despite the presence of feral cats for part of the intervening period.

By the 1920s, the kākāpō was extinct in the North Island and its range and numbers in the South Island were declining. 
===1950–1989 conservation efforts===

In the 1950s, the New Zealand Wildlife Service was established and began making regular expeditions to search for the kākāpō, mostly in Fiordland and what is now the Kahurangi National Park in the northwest of the South Island. Seven Fiordland expeditions between 1951 and 1956 found only a few recent signs. Finally, in 1958 a kākāpō was caught and released in the Milford Sound / Piopiotahi catchment area in Fiordland. Six more kākāpō were captured in 1961; one was released and the other five were transferred to the aviaries of the Mount Bruce Bird Reserve near Masterton in the North Island. Within months, four of the birds had died and the fifth died after about four years. In the next 12 years, regular expeditions found few signs of the kākāpō, indicating that numbers were continuing to decline. Only one bird was captured in 1967; it died the following year.

By the early 1970s, it was uncertain whether the kākāpō was still an extant species. At the end of 1974, scientists located several more male kākāpō and made the first scientific observations of kākāpō booming. These observations led Don Merton to speculate for the first time that the kākāpō had a lek breeding system. From 1974 to 1978 a total of 18 kākāpō were discovered in Fiordland, but all were males. This raised the possibility that the species would become extinct, because there might be no surviving females. One male bird was captured in the Milford area in 1975, christened &quot;Richard Henry&quot;, and transferred to Maud Island. All the birds the Wildlife Service discovered from 1951 to 1976 were in U-shaped glaciated valleys flanked by almost-vertical cliffs and surrounded by high mountains. Such extreme terrain had slowed colonisation by browsing mammals, leaving islands of virtually unmodified native vegetation. However, even here, stoats were present and by 1976 the kākāpō was gone from the valley floors and only a few males survived high on the most inaccessible parts of the cliffs.

Before 1977, no expedition had been to Stewart Island to search for the bird. In 1977, sightings of kākāpō were reported on the island. An expedition to Rakiura found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen kākāpō. The finding in an area of fire-modified scrubland and forest raised hope that the population would include females. The total population was estimated at 100 to 200 birds.

Mustelids have never colonised Stewart Island, but feral cats were present. During a survey, it was apparent that cats killed kākāpō at a rate of 56% per year. At this rate, the birds could not survive on the island and therefore an intensive cat control was introduced in 1982, after which no cat-killed kākāpō were found. However, to ensure the survival of the remaining birds, scientists decided later that this population should be transferred to predator-free islands; this operation was carried out between 1982 and 1997.

===Kākāpō Recovery programme===
In the 1980s the kākāpō were translocated to islands with no predators to maintain their genetic diversity, to avoid spreading harmful diseases, and to reduce interbreeding.

In 1989, a Kākāpō Recovery plan was developed, and a Kākāpō Recovery programme was established in 1995. The New Zealand Department of Conservation replaced the Wildlife Service for this task.

The first action of the plan was to relocate all the remaining kākāpō to suitable islands for them to breed. None of the New Zealand islands were ideal to establish kākāpō without rehabilitation by extensive re-vegetation and the eradication of introduced mammalian predators and competitors. Four islands were finally chosen: Maud, Little Barrier, Codfish and Mana. Sixty-five kākāpō (43 males, 22 females) were successfully transferred onto the four islands in five translocations. Some islands had to be rehabilitated several times when feral cats, stoats and weka kept appearing. Little Barrier Island was eventually viewed as unsuitable due to the rugged landscape, the thick forest and the continued presence of rats, and its birds were evacuated in 1998. Along with Mana Island, it was replaced with two new kākāpō sanctuaries: Chalky Island (Te Kākahu-o-Tamatea) and Anchor Island. The entire kākāpō population of Codfish Island was temporarily relocated in 1999 to Pearl Island in Port Pegasus while rats were being eliminated from Codfish. All kākāpō on Pearl and Chalky Islands were moved to Anchor Island in 2005.

====Supplementary feeding====
A key part of the Recovery Programme is the supplementary feeding of females. Kākāpō breed only once every two to five years, when certain plant species, primarily &quot;Dacrydium cupressinum&quot; (rimu), produce protein-rich fruit and seeds. During breeding years when rimu masts supplementary food is provided to kākāpō to increase the likelihood of individuals successfully breeding. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied &quot;ad libitum&quot; each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–1991 for the first time since 1982, although nesting success was low.

Supplementary feeding affects the sex ratio of kākāpō offspring, and can be used to increase the number of female chicks by deliberately manipulating maternal condition. 

Today commercial parrot food is supplied to all individuals of breeding age on Whenua Hou and Anchor. The amount eaten and individual weights are carefully monitored to ensure that optimum body condition is maintained.

====Nest management====
Kākāpō nests are intensively managed by wildlife conservation staff. Before Polynesian rats were removed from Whenua Hou, the rats were a threat to the survival of young kākāpō. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats. 

All kākāpō islands are now rat-free, but infrared cameras still allow rangers to remotely monitor the behaviour of females and chicks in nests. Data loggers record when mother kākāpō come and go, allowing rangers to pick a time to check on the health of chicks, and also indicate how hard females are having to work to find food. Because mother kākāpō often struggle to successfully rear multiple chicks, Kākāpō Recovery rangers will move chicks between nests as needed.

Eggs are often removed from nests for incubation to reduce the likelihood of accidents, such as lost eggs or crushing. If chicks become ill, are not putting on weight, or there are too many chicks in the nest (and no available nest to move them to) they will be hand-reared by the Kākāpō Recovery team. In the 2019 season, eggs were also removed from nests to encourage females to re-nest. By hand-raising the first group of chicks in captivity and encouraging females to lay more eggs, the Kākāpō Recovery Team hoped that overall chick production would be increased. By the end of February 2020, the bird&#x27;s summer breeding season, these efforts led to the production of 80 chicks, &quot;a record number.&quot;

====Monitoring====
To monitor the kākāpō population continuously, each bird is equipped with a radio transmitter. Every known kākāpō, barring some young chicks, has been given a name by Kākāpō Recovery Programme officials, and detailed data is gathered about every individual. GPS transmitters are also being trialled to provide more detailed data about the movement of individual birds and their habitat use. The signals also provide behavioural data, letting rangers gather information about mating and nesting remotely. 

====Reintroduction====
The Kākāpō Recovery programme has been successful, with the numbers of kākāpō increasing steadily. Adult survival rate and productivity have both improved significantly since the programme&#x27;s inception. However, the main goal is to establish at least one viable, self-sustaining, unmanaged population of kākāpō as a functional component of the ecosystem in a protected habitat. To help meet this conservation challenge, Resolution Island () in Fiordland has been prepared for kākāpō re-introduction with ecological restoration including the eradication of stoats. Ultimately, the Kākāpō Recovery vision for the species is to restore the (Māori for &quot;life-force&quot;) of the kākāpō by breeding 150 adult females.

Four males were re-introduced to Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari in the North Island on 21 July 2023, becoming the first kākāpō living in mainland New Zealand in almost 40 years. Despite extensive improvements to the perimeter fence, in October 2023, one of the kākāpō escaped by using a downed tree to climb out. The bird was located using the signal from its GPS transmitter and returned to the sanctuary. A second group of six birds was introduced to the sanctuary in September. However, two further kākāpō found a way over the fence, and in November the Department of Conservation temporarily removed three birds from the sanctuary to a southern predator-free island, leaving the kākāpō population in the sanctuary at seven. The Department commented that &quot;Kākāpō are flightless but are excellent climbers who can use their wings to parachute from treetops&quot;.

====Fatal fungal infection====
In 2019 an outbreak of the fungal disease &quot;aspergillosis&quot; among kākāpō on the island of Whenua Hou infected 21 individuals and led to 9 deaths: two adults, five chicks and two juveniles. Over 50 birds were transported to veterinary centres for diagnostics and treatment.

==Population timeline==
* 1977: Kākāpō rediscovered on Stewart Island / Rakiura
* 1989: Most kākāpō are removed from Rakiura to Whenua Hou and Hauturu-O-Toi
* 1995: Kākāpō population consists of 51 individuals; beginning of the Kakapo Recovery Programme
* 1999: Kākāpō removed from Hauturu
* 2002: A significant breeding season led to 24 chicks being hatched
* 2005: 41 females and 45 males, including four fledglings (3 females and 1 male); kākāpō established on Anchor Island
* 2009: The total kākāpō population rose to over 100 for the first time since monitoring began. Twenty-two of the 34 chicks had to be hand-reared because of a shortage of food on Codfish Island.
* December 2010: Death of the oldest known kākāpō, &quot;Richard Henry&quot;, possibly 80 years old.
* 2012: Seven kākāpō transferred to Hauturu, in an attempt to establish a successful breeding programme. Kākāpō were last on the island in 1999.
* March 2014: With the kākāpō population having increased to 126, the bird&#x27;s recovery was used by Melbourne artist Sayraphim Lothian as a metaphor for the recovery of Christchurch, parallelling the &quot;indomitable spirit of these two communities and their determination to rebuild&quot;.
* 2016: First breeding on Anchor; a significant breeding season, with 32 chicks; kākāpō population grows to over 150
* 2018: After the death of 3 birds, the population reduced to 149 birds.
* 2019: An abundance of rimu fruit and the introduction of several new technologies (including artificial insemination and &#x27;smart eggs&#x27;) helped make 2019 the best breeding season on record, with over 200 eggs laid and 72 chicks fledged. According to the Kākāpō Recovery Team at the New Zealand Department of Conservation, this was the earliest and longest breeding season yet. Population reached 200 juvenile or older birds on 17 August 2019.
* 2022: The population increased to 252 birds after a productive breeding season and successful artificial insemination.
* 2023: Birds are reintroduced to the mainland for the first time.

==In Māori culture==
The kākāpō is associated with a rich tradition of Māori folklore and beliefs. The bird&#x27;s irregular breeding cycle was understood to be associated with heavy fruiting or &quot;masting&quot; events of particular plant species such as the rimu, which led Māori to credit the bird with the ability to tell the future. Used to substantiate this claim were reported observations of these birds dropping the berries of the hinau and tawa trees (when they were in season) into secluded pools of water to preserve them as a food supply for the summer ahead; in legend this became the origin of the Māori practice of immersing food in water for the same purpose.

===Use for food and clothing===

The Māori considered the meat of the kākāpō a delicacy and, when the bird was widespread, hunted it for food. One source states that its flesh &quot;resembles lamb in taste and texture&quot;, although European settlers have described the bird as having a &quot;strong and slightly stringent [sic] flavour&quot;.

In breeding years, the loud booming calls of the males at their mating arenas made it easy for Māori hunting parties to track the kākāpō down, and it was also hunted while feeding or when dust-bathing in dry weather. The bird was caught, generally at night, using snares, pitfall traps, or by groups of domesticated Polynesian dogs which accompanied hunting parties – sometimes they would use fire sticks of various sorts to dazzle a bird in the darkness, stopping it in their tracks and making the capture easier. Cooking was done in a hāngī or in gourds of boiling oil. The flesh of the bird could be preserved in its own fat and stored in containers for later consumption – hunters of the Ngāi Tahu would pack the flesh in baskets made from the inner bark of tōtara tree or in containers constructed from kelp. Bundles of kākāpō tail feathers were attached to the sides of these containers to provide decoration and a way to identify their contents. The Māori also used the bird&#x27;s eggs for food.

As well as eating the meat of the kākāpō, Māori would use kākāpō skins with the feathers still attached or individually weave in kākāpō feathers with flax fibre to create cloaks and capes. Each one required up to 11,000 feathers to make. Not only were these garments considered very beautiful, they also kept the wearer very warm. They were highly valued and considered as (treasures), so much so that the old Māori adage &quot;You have a kākāpō cape and you still complain of the cold&quot; was used to describe someone who is never satisfied. Only one cloak fully made of kākāpō feathers is known to still exist. It dates from the 1810s–1820s and is held in the Perth Museum in Scotland; the museum in collaboration with the British Museum and Māori advisers have restored the cloak. Kākāpō feathers were also used to decorate the heads of , but were removed before use in combat.

Despite this, the kākāpō was also regarded as an affectionate pet by the Māori. This was corroborated by European settlers in New Zealand in the 19th century, among them George Edward Grey, who once wrote in a letter to an associate that his pet kākāpō&#x27;s behaviour towards him and his friends was &quot;more like that of a dog than a bird&quot;.

==In the media==
The conservation of the kākāpō has made the species well known. Many books and documentaries detailing the plight of the kākāpō have been produced in recent years, one of the earliest being &quot;Two in the Bush&quot;, made by Gerald Durrell for the BBC in 1962.

A feature-length documentary, &quot;The Unnatural History of the Kakapo&quot; won two major awards at the Reel Earth Environmental Film Festival. Two of the most significant documentaries, both made by NHNZ, are &quot;Kakapo – Night Parrot&quot; (1982) and &quot;To Save the Kakapo&quot; (1997).
The BBC&#x27;s Natural History Unit featured the kākāpō, including a sequence with Sir David Attenborough in &quot;The Life of Birds&quot;. It was one of the endangered animals Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine set out to find for the radio series and book &quot;Last Chance to See&quot;. An updated version of the series has been produced for BBC TV, in which Stephen Fry and Carwardine revisit the animals to see how they are getting on almost 20 years later, and in January 2009, they spent time filming the kākāpō on Codfish Island / Whenua Hou. Footage of a kākāpō named Sirocco attempting to mate with Carwardine&#x27;s head was viewed by millions worldwide, leading to Sirocco becoming &quot;spokes-bird&quot; for New Zealand wildlife conservation in 2010. Sirocco became the inspiration for the party parrot, a popular animated emoji frequently associated with the workflow application Slack.

The kākāpō was featured in the episode &quot;Strange Islands&quot; of the documentary series &quot;South Pacific&quot;, originally aired on 13 June 2009, in the episode &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; of the series &quot;The Living Planet&quot;, and in episode 3 of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;New Zealand Earth&#x27;s Mythical Islands&quot;. 

In a 2019 kākāpō awareness campaign, the Kākāpō Recovery Programme New Zealand National Partner, Meridian Energy, ran a &quot;Search for a Saxophonist&quot; to provide suitable mood music for encouraging mating to coincide with the 2019 kākāpō breeding season. The search and footage from the islands where breeding was taking place were featured on the &quot;Breakfast&quot; programme. The kākāpō was featured in the mobile game &quot;Kākāpō Run&quot; developed by a UK conservation charity. This game aimed to raise support for kākāpō conservation by engaging players in fun, educational gameplay. A study found that playing the game helped increase positive attitudes and actions related to kākāpō protection, such as support for managing invasive predators and responsible pet care, though it did not lead to more donations.

The bird was voted New Zealand&#x27;s bird of the year in 2008 and 2020.

<text>Cytidine (symbol C or Cyd) is a nucleoside molecule that is formed when cytosine is attached to a ribose ring (also known as a ribofuranose) via a β-N1-glycosidic bond. Cytidine is a component of RNA. It is a white water-soluble solid that is only slightly soluble in ethanol.

==Dietary sources==
Dietary sources of cytidine include foods with high RNA (ribonucleic acid) content, such as organ meats, brewer&#x27;s yeast, as well as pyrimidine-rich foods such as beer. During digestion, RNA-rich foods are broken-down into ribosyl pyrimidines (cytidine and uridine), which are absorbed intact. In humans, dietary cytidine is converted into uridine, which is probably the compound behind cytidine&#x27;s metabolic effects.

==Cytidine analogues==
A variety of cytidine analogues are known, some with potentially useful pharmacology. For example, KP-1461 is an anti-HIV agent that works as a viral mutagen, and zebularine exists in &quot;E. coli&quot; and is being examined for chemotherapy. Low doses of azacitidine and its analog decitabine have shown results against cancer through epigenetic demethylation.

==Biological actions==
In addition to its role as a pyrimidine component of RNA, cytidine has been found to control neuronal-glial glutamate cycling, with supplementation decreasing midfrontal/cerebral glutamate/glutamine levels. As such, cytidine has generated interest as a potential glutamatergic antidepressant drug.

<doc id="89078" wikidata="Q422553" url="?curid=89078" title="Glycosidic bond">
<text>A glycosidic bond or glycosidic linkage is a type of ether bond that joins a carbohydrate (sugar) molecule to another group, which may or may not be another carbohydrate.

A glycosidic bond is formed between the hemiacetal or hemiketal group of a saccharide (or a molecule derived from a saccharide) and the hydroxyl group of some compound such as an alcohol. A substance containing a glycosidic bond is a glycoside.

The term &#x27;glycoside&#x27; is now extended to also cover compounds with bonds formed between hemiacetal (or hemiketal) groups of sugars and several chemical groups other than hydroxyls, such as -SR (thioglycosides), -SeR (selenoglycosides), -NR1R2 (N-glycosides), or even -CR1R2R3 (C-glycosides).

Particularly in naturally occurring glycosides, the compound ROH from which the carbohydrate residue has been removed is often termed the aglycone, and the carbohydrate residue itself is sometimes referred to as the &#x27;glycone&#x27;.

== S-, N-, C-, and O-glycosidic bonds ==

Glycosidic bonds of the form discussed above are known as O-glycosidic bonds, in reference to the glycosidic oxygen that links the glycoside to the aglycone or reducing end sugar. In analogy, one also considers S-glycosidic bonds (which form thioglycosides), where the oxygen of the glycosidic bond is replaced with a sulfur atom. In the same way, N-glycosidic bonds, have the glycosidic bond oxygen replaced with nitrogen. Substances containing N-glycosidic bonds are also known as glycosylamines. C-glycosyl bonds have the glycosidic oxygen replaced by a carbon; the term &quot;C-glycoside&quot; is considered a misnomer by IUPAC and is discouraged. All of these modified glycosidic bonds have different susceptibility to hydrolysis, and in the case of C-glycosyl structures, they are typically more resistant to hydrolysis.

==Numbering, and α/β distinction of glycosidic bonds== 

When an anomeric center is involved in a glycosidic bond (as is common in nature) then one can distinguish between α- and β-glycosidic bonds by the relative stereochemistry of the anomeric position and the stereocenter furthest from C1 in the saccharide.

Pharmacologists often join substances to glucuronic acid via glycosidic bonds in order to increase their water solubility; this is known as glucuronidation. Many other glycosides have important physiological functions.

== Chemical approaches ==

Nüchter et al. (2001) have shown a new approach to Fischer glycosidation. Employing a microwave oven equipped with refluxing apparatus in a rotor reactor with pressure bombs, Nüchter et al. (2001) were able to achieve 100% yield of α- and β-D-glucosides. This method can be performed on a multi-kilogram scale.

=== Vishal Y Joshi&#x27;s method ===

Joshi et al. (2006) propose the Koenigs-Knorr reaction in the stereoselective synthesis of alkyl D-glucopyranosides via glycosylation, with the exception of using lithium carbonate which is less expensive and toxic than the conventional method of using silver or mercury salts. D-glucose is first protected by forming the peracetate by addition of acetic anhydride in acetic acid, and then addition of hydrogen bromide which brominates at the 5-position. On addition of the alcohol ROH and lithium carbonate, the OR replaces the bromine and on deprotecting the acetylated hydroxyls the product is synthesized in relatively high purity. It was suggested by Joshi et al. (2001) that lithium acts as the nucleophile that attacks the carbon at the 5-position and through a transition state the alcohol is substituted for the bromine group. Advantages of this method as well as its stereoselectivity and low cost of the lithium salt include that it can be done at room temperature and its yield compares relatively well with the conventional Koenigs-Knorr method.

== Glycoside hydrolases ==

Glycoside hydrolases (or glycosidases), are enzymes that break glycosidic bonds. Glycoside hydrolases typically can act either on α- or on β-glycosidic bonds, but not on both. This specificity allows researchers to obtain glycosides in high epimeric excess, one example being Wen-Ya Lu&#x27;s conversion of D-Glucose to Ethyl β-D-glucopyranoside using naturally-derived glucosidase. Wen-Ya Lu utilized glucosidase in a reverse manner opposite to the enzyme&#x27;s biological functionality:
== Glycosyltransferases ==

Before monosaccharide units are incorporated into glycoproteins, polysaccharides, or lipids in living organisms, they are typically first &quot;activated&quot; by being joined via a glycosidic bond to the phosphate group of a nucleotide such as uridine diphosphate (UDP), guanosine diphosphate (GDP), thymidine diphosphate (TDP), or cytidine monophosphate (CMP). These activated biochemical intermediates are known as sugar nucleotides or sugar donors. Many biosynthetic pathways use mono- or oligosaccharides activated by a diphosphate linkage to lipids, such as dolichol. These activated donors are then substrates for enzymes known as glycosyltransferases, which transfer the sugar unit from the activated donor to an accepting nucleophile (the acceptor substrate).
== Disaccharide phosphorylases ==

Different biocatalytic approaches have been developed toward the synthesis of glycosides in the past decades, which using &quot;glycosyltransferases&quot; and &quot;glycoside hydrolases&quot; are among the most common catalysis. The former often needs expensive materials and the later often shows low yields, De Winter et al.
investigated use of cellobiose phosphorylase (CP) toward synthesis of alpha-glycosides in ionic liquids. The best condition for use of CP was found to be in the presence of IL AMMOENG 101 and ethyl acetate.

== Directed glycosylations ==

Multiple chemical approaches exist to encourage selectivity of α- and β-glycosidic bonds. The highly substrate specific nature of the selectivity and the overall activity of the pyranoside can provide major synthetic difficulties. The overall specificity of the glycosylation can be improved by utilizing approaches which take into account the relative transition states that the anomeric carbon can undergo during a typical glycosylation. Most notably, recognition and incorporation of Felkin-Ahn-Eisenstein models into rationale chemical design can generally provide reliable results provided the transformation can undergo this type of conformational control in the transition state.

Fluorine directed glycosylations represent an encouraging handle for both B selectivity and introduction of a non-natural biomimetic C2 functionality on the carbohydrate. One innovative example provided by Bucher et al. provides a way to utilize a fluoro oxonium ion and the trichloroacetimidate to encourage B stereoselectivity through the gauche effect. This reasonable stereoselectivity is clear through visualization of the Felkin-Ahn models of the possible chair forms.

This method represents an encouraging way to selectivity incorporate B-ethyl, isopropyl and other glycosides with typical trichloroacetimidate chemistry.

== O-linked glycopeptides; pharmaceutical uses of O-glycosylated peptides ==
O-linked glycopeptides recently have been shown to exhibit excellent CNS permeability and efficacy in multiple animal models with disease states. In addition one of the most intriguing aspects thereof is the capability of O-glycosylation to extend half life, decrease clearance, and improve PK/PD thereof the active peptide beyond increasing CNS penetration. The innate utilization of sugars as solubilizing moieties in Phase II and III metabolism (glucuronic acids) has remarkably allowed an evolutionary advantage in that mammalian enzymes are not directly evolved to degrade O glycosylated products on larger moieties.

The peculiar nature of O-linked glycopeptides is that there are numerous examples which are CNS penetrant. The fundamental basis of this effect is thought to involve &quot;membrane hopping&quot; or &quot;hop diffusion&quot;. The non-brownian motion driven &quot;hop diffusion&quot; process is thought to occur due to discontinuity of the plasma membrane. &quot;Hop diffusion&quot; notably combines free diffusion and intercomparmental transitions. Recent examples notably include high permeability of met-enkephalin analogs amongst other peptides. The full mOR agonist pentapeptide DAMGO is also CNS penetrant upon introduction of glycosylation.

== N-Glycosidic bonds in DNA ==
DNA molecules contain 5-membered carbon rings called deoxyriboses that are directly attached to two phosphate groups and a nucleobase that contains amino groups. The nitrogen atoms from the amino group in the nucleotides are covalently linked to the anomeric carbon of the ribose sugar structure through an N-glycosidic bond. Occasionally, the nucleobases attached to the ribose undergo deamination, alkylation, or oxidation which results in cytotoxic lesions along the DNA backbone. These modifications severely threaten the cohesiveness of the DNA molecule, leading to the development of diseases such as cancer. DNA glycosylases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis the N-glycosidic bond to free the damaged or modified nucleobase from the DNA, by cleaving the carbon-nitrogen glycosidic bond at the 2&#x27; carbon, subsequently initiating the base excision repair (BER) pathway.

Monofunctional glycosylases catalyze the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond via either a stepwise, SN1 like mechanism, or a concerted, SN2 like mechanism. The stepwise function, the nucleobase acts as a leaving group before the anomeric carbon gets attacked by the water molecule, producing a short-lived unstable oxacarbenium ion intermediate. This intermediate rapidly reacts with the nearby water molecule to substitute the N-glycosidic bond of the ribose and the nucleobase with an O-glycosidic bond with a hydroxy group. The concerted mechanism, the water acts as a nucleophile and attacks at the anomeric carbon before the nucelobase gets to act like a leaving group. The intermediate produced is a similar oxacarbenium ion where both the hydroxy groups and the nucleobase are still attached to the anomeric carbon. Both mechanisms theoretically yield the same product. Most ribonucleotides are hydrolyzed via the concerted SN2 like mechanism, while most deoxyribonucleotides proceed through the stepwise like mechanism.

These reactions are practically irreversible. Due to the fact that the cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond from the DNA backbone can lead to detrimental mutagenic and cytotoxic responses in an organism the ability to also catalyze the synthesis of N-glycosidic bonds by way of an abasic DNA site and a specific nucleobase.

<text>Nucleotide bases (also nucleobases, nitrogenous bases) are nitrogen-containing biological compounds that form nucleosides, which, in turn, are components of nucleotides, with all of these monomers constituting the basic building blocks of nucleic acids. The ability of nucleobases to form base pairs and to stack one upon another leads directly to long-chain helical structures such as ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Five nucleobases—adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T), and uracil (U)—are called &quot;primary&quot; or &quot;canonical&quot;. They function as the fundamental units of the genetic code, with the bases A, G, C, and T being found in DNA while A, G, C, and U are found in RNA. Thymine and uracil are distinguished by merely the presence or absence of a methyl group on the fifth carbon (C5) of these heterocyclic six-membered rings.
In addition, some viruses have aminoadenine (Z) instead of adenine. It differs in having an extra amine group, creating a more stable bond to thymine.

Adenine and guanine have a fused-ring skeletal structure derived of purine, hence they are called purine bases. The purine nitrogenous bases are characterized by their single amino group (), at the C6 carbon in adenine and C2 in guanine. Similarly, the simple-ring structure of cytosine, uracil, and thymine is derived of pyrimidine, so those three bases are called the pyrimidine bases.

Each of the base pairs in a typical double-helix DNA comprises a purine and a pyrimidine: either an A paired with a T or a C paired with a G. These purine-pyrimidine pairs, which are called &quot;base complements&quot;, connect the two strands of the helix and are often compared to the rungs of a ladder. Only pairing purine with pyrimidine ensures a constant width for the DNA. The A–T pairing is based on two hydrogen bonds, while the C–G pairing is based on three. In both cases, the hydrogen bonds are between the amine and carbonyl groups on the complementary bases.

Nucleobases such as adenine, guanine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, purine, 2,6-diaminopurine, and 6,8-diaminopurine may have formed in outer space as well as on earth.

The origin of the term &quot;base&quot; reflects these compounds&#x27; chemical properties in acid–base reactions, but those properties are not especially important for understanding most of the biological functions of nucleobases.

==Structure==
At the sides of nucleic acid structure, phosphate molecules successively connect the two sugar-rings of two adjacent nucleotide monomers, thereby creating a long chain biomolecule. These chain-joins of phosphates with sugars (ribose or deoxyribose) create the &quot;backbone&quot; strands for a single- or double helix biomolecule. In the double helix of DNA, the two strands are oriented chemically in opposite directions, which permits base pairing by providing complementarity between the two bases, and which is essential for replication of or transcription of the encoded information found in DNA.

==Modified nucleobases==
DNA and RNA also contain other (non-primary) bases that have been modified after the nucleic acid chain has been formed. In DNA, the most common modified base is 5-methylcytosine (m5C). In RNA, there are many modified bases, including those contained in the nucleosides pseudouridine (Ψ), dihydrouridine (D), inosine (I), and 7-methylguanosine (m7G).

Hypoxanthine and xanthine are two of the many bases created through mutagen presence, both of them through deamination (replacement of the amine-group with a carbonyl-group). Hypoxanthine is produced from adenine, xanthine from guanine, and uracil results from deamination of cytosine.

===Modified purine nucleobases===
These are examples of modified adenosine or guanosine.
===Modified pyrimidine nucleobases===
These are examples of modified cytidine, thymidine or uridine.
==Artificial nucleobases==

A vast number of nucleobase analogues exist.
The most common applications are used as fluorescent probes, either directly or indirectly, such as aminoallyl nucleotide, which are used to label cRNA or cDNA in microarrays. Several groups are working on alternative &quot;extra&quot; base pairs to extend the genetic code, such as isoguanine and isocytosine or the fluorescent 2-amino-6-(2-thienyl)purine and pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde.

In medicine, several nucleoside analogues are used as anticancer and antiviral agents. The viral polymerase incorporates these compounds with non-canonical bases. These compounds are activated in the cells by being converted into nucleotides; they are administered as nucleosides as charged nucleotides cannot easily cross cell membranes. At least one set of new base pairs has been announced as of May 2014.

==Prebiotic condensation of nucleobases with ribose==

In order to understand how life arose, knowledge is required of chemical pathways that permit formation of the key building blocks of life under plausible prebiotic conditions. According to the RNA world hypothesis, free-floating ribonucleotides were present in the primordial soup. These were the fundamental molecules that combined in series to form RNA. Molecules as complex as RNA must have arisen from small molecules whose reactivity was governed by physico-chemical processes. RNA is composed of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, both of which are necessary for reliable information transfer, and thus Darwinian evolution. Nam et al. demonstrated the direct condensation of nucleobases with ribose to give ribonucleosides in aqueous microdroplets, a key step leading to RNA formation. Similar results were obtained by Becker et al.

<doc id="89086" wikidata="Q414939" url="?curid=89086" title="Hemiacetal">
<text>In organic chemistry, a hemiacetal is a functional group the general formula , where is a hydrogen atom or an organic substituent. They generally result from the nucleophilic addition of an alcohol (a compound with at least one hydroxy group) to an aldehyde () or a ketone () under acidic conditions. The addition of an alcohol to a ketone is more commonly referred to as a hemiketal. Common examples of hemiacetals include cyclic monosaccharides. Hemiacetals have use as a protecting group and in synthesizing oxygenated heterocycles like tetrahydrofurans.

==Nomenclature==
According to the IUPAC definition of a hemiacetal, the R1 and R2 groups may or may not be hydrogen. In a hemiketal, both of these R-groups must not be hydrogen. Thus, hemiketals are regarded as a subclass of hemiacetals. The prefix &quot;hemi,&quot; meaning half, refers to the one alcohol added to the carbonyl group. This is half of the required alcohols to form acetals or ketals. Cyclic hemiacetals can sometimes be referred to as lactols.
==Formation ==

Hemiacetals form in the reaction between alcohols and aldehydes or ketones. Using an acid catalyst, the reaction proceeds via nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl group by the alcohol. A subsequent nucleophilic attack of the hemiacetal by the alcohol results in an acetal. Solutions of simple aldehydes in alcohols mainly consist of the hemiacetal. The equilibrium is dynamic and can be easily reversed via hydrolysis. The equilibrium is sensitive to steric effects.

Cyclic hemiacetals often form readily, especially when they are 5- and 6-membered rings. In this case, a hydroxy group reacts with a carbonyl group within the same molecule to undergo an intramolecular cyclization reaction.
===Hemiacetals in nature===
Hemiacetals commonly exist in nature as aldoses such as glucose, and hemiketals commonly exist in nature as ketoses such as fructose. The favorability of the formation of a strain-free six-membered ring and the electrophilicity of an aldehyde combine to strongly favor the acetal form.
== Usage ==
Tetrahydrofurans can be synthesized from nucleophilic addition to hemiacetals with high stereoselectivity, which can be further used to form polymers such as lignans.

Hemiacetals can also undergo acid-catalyzed spirocyclization or metal-catalyzed addition/elimination to afford spiroacetals. These reactions are moderately stereoselective, although the thermodynamically-favoured isomer is often produced. Drug discovery programs synthesize spiroacetal scaffolds to generate libraries of spiroacetal-containing molecules. These spiroacetal derivatives have potential use in treating diseases such as CLL leukemia.

One method of producing linear hemiacetal esters is through the condensation of stabilized hemiacetals by anhydrides; this creates a stable hemiketal intermediate that subsequently undergoes acetylation into the hemiacetal ester. Hemiacetal esters are primarily used in polymer chemistry as a polymerization initiator and as a protecting group for carboxylic acids.

<text>Occasional use of body fluids such as blood, urine, feces, etc. in works of art is most common in shock art or transgressive art.

== Examples ==

=== Blood ===

* New York artist Vincent Castiglia uses his own blood to make paintings, and used it to make the artwork on the guitar of thrash metal musician Gary Holt.
* &quot;The Anguished Man&quot;, an allegedly haunted painting by an unknown artist, contains the artist&#x27;s blood in its paint, according to its owner.
* The Flaming Lips released a limited run of vinyl records of the 2012 album &quot;Heady Fwends&quot; containing the blood of the musicians involved, sold for $2,500 each.

=== Urine ===

* &quot;Piss Christ&quot;, a controversial 1987 photograph by American photographer Andres Serrano, depicts a small plastic crucifix submerged in a small glass tank full of the artist&#x27;s urine.
* &quot;PISSED&quot;, a glass tube containing 200 gallons of the urine of Canadian transgender artist Cassils, was made in 2017 as a protest against a decision by the Trump administration to revoke an Obama administration executive order which guaranteed that transgender students could use restrooms that corresponded with their gender identity. It is currently on exhibition at the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art.

=== Feces ===

* &quot;Artist&#x27;s Shit&quot;, a 1961 artwork by Italian artist Piero Manzoni, consists of 90 tin cans reportedly filled with of his feces.

=== Breast milk ===

* In the work &quot;All You Can Feel&quot;, the artist Sarah Ancelle Schönfeld sprinkles exposed photo negatives with hormones or endogenous substances such as breast milk and pharmacological substances such as the contraceptive pill.

=== Human Fat ===

* &quot;Wenming zhu (Civilization Pillar)&quot; by artist duo Sun Yuan &amp; Peng Yu. The work resembles a classical stone column, but it is in fact entirely composed of layers of congealed, gleaming human fat that was collected from plastic surgery clinics. 

== Criticism and difficulties ==
Depicting objects of popular respect (religious subjects, flags, etc.) in art which includes body fluids can trigger public protests due to such material&#x27;s historic association with dirtiness. The outcry about the &quot;Piss Christ&quot; photo is an example.

In addition to the obvious difficulties of preserving perishable material, there can be regulations complicating transport by rail, truck, or aircraft of liquid body fluids due to the fluids&#x27; possible classification as dangerous goods.

The sale of blood art via eBay is prohibited as eBay prohibits the sale of body parts, and classifies blood art as falling under this heading.

<doc id="89092" wikidata="Q421103" url="?curid=89092" title="Acetal">
<text>In organic chemistry, an acetal is a functional group with the connectivity . Here, the R groups can be organic fragments (a carbon atom, with arbitrary other atoms attached to that) or hydrogen, while the R&#x27; groups must be organic fragments not hydrogen. The two R&#x27; groups can be equivalent to each other (a &quot;symmetric acetal&quot;) or not (a &quot;mixed acetal&quot;). Acetals are formed from and convertible to aldehydes or ketones and have the same oxidation state at the central carbon, but have substantially different chemical stability and reactivity as compared to the analogous carbonyl compounds. The central carbon atom has four bonds to it, and is therefore saturated and has tetrahedral geometry.

The term ketal is sometimes used to identify structures associated with ketones (both R groups organic fragments rather than hydrogen) rather than aldehydes and, historically, the term acetal was used specifically for the aldehyde-related cases (having at least one hydrogen in place of an R on the central carbon). The IUPAC originally deprecated the usage of the word ketal altogether, but has since reversed its decision. However, in contrast to historical usage, ketals are now a subset of acetals, a term that now encompasses both aldehyde- and ketone-derived structures.

If one of the R groups has an oxygen as the first atom (that is, there are more than two oxygens single-bonded to the central carbon), the functional group is instead an orthoester. In contrast to variations of R, both R&#x27; groups are organic fragments. If one R&#x27; is a hydrogen, the functional group is instead a hemiacetal, while if both are H, the functional group is a ketone hydrate or aldehyde hydrate.

Formation of an acetal occurs when the hydroxyl group of a hemiacetal becomes protonated and is lost as water. The carbocation that is produced is then rapidly attacked by a molecule of alcohol. Loss of the proton from the attached alcohol gives the acetal.
Acetals are stable compared to hemiacetals but their formation is a reversible equilibrium as with esters. As a reaction to create an acetal proceeds, water must be removed from the reaction mixture, for example, with a Dean–Stark apparatus, lest it hydrolyse the product back to the hemiacetal. The formation of acetals reduces the total number of molecules present (carbonyl + 2 alcohol → acetal + water) and therefore is generally not favourable with regards to entropy. One situation where it is not entropically unfavourable is when a single diol molecule is used rather than two separate alcohol molecules (carbonyl + diol → acetal + water). 

==Acetalisation and ketalization==

Acetalisation and ketalization are the organic reactions that involve the formation of an acetal (or ketals) from aldehydes and ketones, respectively. These conversions are acid catalysed. They eliminate water. Since each step is often a rapid equilibrium, the reaction must be driven by removal of water. Methods for removing water include azeotropic distillation and trapping water with desiccants like aluminium oxide and molecular sieves. Steps assumed to be involved: protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, addition of the alcohol to the protonated carbonyl, protonolysis of the resulting hemiacetal or hemiketal, and addition of the second alcohol. These steps are illustrated with an aldehyde RCH=O and the alcohol R&#x27;OH:
:
:

Another way to avoid the entropic cost is to perform the synthesis by acetal exchange, using a pre-existing acetal-type reagent as the OR&#x27;-group donor rather than simple addition of alcohols themselves. One type of reagent used for this method is an orthoester. In this case, water produced along with the acetal product is destroyed when it hydrolyses residual orthoester molecules, and this side reaction also produces more alcohol to be used in the main reaction.

==Examples==
===Sugars=== 
Since many sugars are polyhydroxy aldehydes and ketones, sugars are a rich source of acetals and ketals. Most glycosidic bonds in carbohydrates and other polysaccharides are acetal linkages. Cellulose is a ubiquitous example of a polyacetal. 

Benzylidene acetal and acetonide as protecting groups used in research of modified sugars.

===Chiral derivatives===
Acetals also find application as chiral auxiliaries. Indeed acetals of chiral glycols like, e.g. derivatives of tartaric acid can be asymmetrically opened with high selectivity. This enables the construction of new chiral centers.
===Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde===
Formaldehyde forms a rich collection of acetals. This tendency reflects the fact that low molecular weight aldehydes are prone to self-condensation such that the C=O bond is replaced by an acetal. The acetal formed from formaldehyde (two hydrogens attached to the central carbon) is sometimes called a &quot;formal&quot; or the methylenedioxy group. The acetal formed from acetone is sometimes called an acetonide. Formaldehyde forms Paraldehyde and 1,3,5-Trioxane. Polyoxymethylene (POM) plastic, also known as &quot;acetal&quot; or &quot;polyacetal&quot;, is a polyacetal (and a polyether), and a polymer of formaldehyde. Acetaldehyde converts to Metaldehyde.

===Unusual acetals===
Phenylsulfonylethylidene (PSE) acetal is an example of arylsulfonyl acetal possessing atypical properties, like resistance to acid hydrolysis which leads to selective introduction and removal of the protective group.

===Flavors and fragrances===
1,1-Diethoxyethane (acetaldehyde diethyl acetal), sometimes called simply &quot;acetal&quot;, is an important flavouring compound in distilled beverages. Two ketals of ethyl acetoacetate are used in commercial fragrances. Fructone (), an ethylene glycol ketal, and fraistone (), a propylene glycol ketal, are commercial fragrances.

==Related compounds==
Used in a more general sense, the term X,Y-&quot;acetal&quot; also refers to any functional group that consists of a carbon bearing two heteroatoms X and Y. For example, &quot;N&quot;,&quot;O&quot;-acetal refers to compounds of type R1R2C(OR)(NR&#x27;2) (R,R&#x27; ≠ H) also known as a &quot;hemiaminal ether&quot; or Aminal, a.k.a. aminoacetal.

&quot;S&quot;,&quot;S&quot;-acetal refers to compounds of type R1R2C(SR)(SR&#x27;) (R,R&#x27; ≠ H, also known as thioacetal and thioketals.

<doc id="89095" wikidata="Q28734" url="?curid=89095" title="Nucleoside">
<text>Nucleosides are glycosylamines that can be thought of as nucleotides without a phosphate group. A nucleoside consists simply of a nucleobase (also termed a nitrogenous base) and a five-carbon sugar (ribose or 2&#x27;-deoxyribose) whereas a nucleotide is composed of a nucleobase, a five-carbon sugar, and one or more phosphate groups. In a nucleoside, the anomeric carbon is linked through a glycosidic bond to the N9 of a purine or the N1 of a pyrimidine. Nucleotides are the molecular building blocks of DNA and RNA.

== List of nucleosides and corresponding nucleobases ==

&quot;This list does not include modified nucleobases and the corresponding nucleosides&quot; 

Each chemical has a short symbol, useful when the chemical family is clear from the context, and a longer symbol, if further disambiguation is needed. For example, long nucleobase sequences in genomes are usually described by CATG symbols, not Cyt-Ade-Thy-Gua (see &quot;Nucleic acid sequence § Notation&quot;). 

==Sources==
Nucleosides can be produced from nucleotides &quot;de novo&quot;, particularly in the liver, but they are more abundantly supplied via ingestion and digestion of nucleic acids in the diet, whereby nucleotidases break down &quot;nucleotides&quot; (such as the thymidine monophosphate) into &quot;nucleosides&quot; (such as thymidine) and phosphate. The nucleosides, in turn, are subsequently broken down in the lumen of the digestive system by nucleosidases into nucleobases and ribose or deoxyribose. In addition, nucleotides can be broken down inside the cell into nitrogenous bases, and ribose-1-phosphate or deoxyribose-1-phosphate.

== Use in medicine and technology ==
In medicine several nucleoside analogues are used as antiviral or anticancer agents. The viral polymerase incorporates these compounds with non-canonical bases. These compounds are activated in the cells by being converted into nucleotides. They are administered as nucleosides since charged nucleotides cannot easily cross cell membranes.

In molecular biology, several analogues of the sugar backbone exist. Due to the low stability of RNA, which is prone to hydrolysis, several more stable alternative nucleoside/nucleotide analogues that correctly bind to RNA are used. This is achieved by using a different backbone sugar. These analogues include locked nucleic acids (LNA), morpholinos and peptide nucleic acids (PNA).

In sequencing, dideoxynucleotides are used. These nucleotides possess the non-canonical sugar dideoxyribose, which lacks 3&#x27; hydroxyl group (which accepts the phosphate). DNA polymerases cannot distinguish between these and regular deoxyribonucleotides, but when incorporated a dideoxynucleotide cannot bond with the next base and the chain is terminated.

==Prebiotic synthesis of ribonucleosides==

In order to understand how life arose, knowledge is required of the chemical pathways that permit formation of the key building blocks of life under plausible prebiotic conditions. According to the RNA world hypothesis free-floating ribonucleosides and ribonucleotides were present in the primitive soup. Molecules as complex as RNA must have arisen from small molecules whose reactivity was governed by physico-chemical processes. RNA is composed of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, both of which are necessary for reliable information transfer, and thus Darwinian natural selection and evolution. Nam et al. demonstrated the direct condensation of nucleobases with ribose to give ribonucleosides in aqueous microdroplets, a key step leading to RNA formation. Also, a plausible prebiotic process for synthesizing pyrimidine and purine ribonucleosides and ribonucleotides using wet-dry cycles was presented by Becker et al.

<text>Daniel D. Tompkins (June 21, 1774 – June 11, 1825) was an American politician. He was the fourth governor of New York from 1807 to 1817, and the sixth vice president of the United States from 1817 to 1825.

Born in Scarsdale, New York, Tompkins practiced law in New York City after graduating from Columbia College. He was a delegate to the 1801 New York constitutional convention and served on the New York Supreme Court from 1804 to 1807. In 1807, he defeated incumbent Morgan Lewis to become the Governor of New York. He held that office from 1807 to 1817, serving for the duration of the War of 1812. During the war, he often spent his own money to equip and pay the militia when the legislature was not in session, or would not approve the necessary funds.

Tompkins was the Democratic-Republican Party&#x27;s vice presidential nominee in the 1816 presidential election. The ticket of James Monroe and Tompkins easily prevailed over limited Federalist opposition. He served as vice president from 1817 to 1825, and was the only 19th century vice president to serve two full terms. In 1820, he sought another term as Governor of New York, but was defeated by DeWitt Clinton. After the War of 1812, Tompkins was in poor physical and financial health, the latter condition stemming largely from his spending for the military effort during the War of 1812. He fell into alcoholism and was unable to re-establish fiscal solvency despite winning partial reimbursement from the federal government in 1823. He died 99 days after completing a second term and leaving office at the age of 50.

==Name==
Tompkins was baptized Daniel Tompkins, but added the middle initial &quot;D.&quot; either before or during his time as a student at Columbia College. According to his granddaughter, Helen T. Tompkins, this was to distinguish himself from another Daniel Tompkins who was a student there, though records of Columbia College do not list another Daniel Tompkins studying at Columbia at the time. There is controversy as to what the middle initial stood for; some have suggested &quot;Decius&quot;. The generally accepted conclusion is that it did not stand for anything and served only to distinguish him from another Daniel Tompkins who perhaps studied with him in primary or secondary school.

==Early life, family, and career==

Daniel D. Tompkins was born on June 21, 1774, in Scarsdale, Westchester County, New York, at his home, the estate of Fox Meadow. His parents were Sarah Ann (Hyatt) and Jonathan Griffin Tompkins. His older brother, Caleb Tompkins was a United States representative from 1817 to 1821. Daniel Tompkins graduated from Columbia College in New York City in 1795, and then studied law with James Kent and Peter Jay Munro. He was admitted to the bar in 1797, and practiced in New York City. Despite the Federalist leanings of Kent and Munro, Tompkins entered politics as a Democratic-Republican. He was a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention in 1801, and a member of the New York State Assembly in 1804. He was elected to the 9th United States Congress, but resigned before the beginning of the term to accept, at age 30, an appointment as associate justice of the New York Supreme Court of Judicature, in which capacity he served from 1804 to 1807.

On February 20, 1798, Daniel Tompkins, 23, married 16-year-old Hannah Minthorne, the daughter of Mangle Minthorne, an assistant alderman of New York City. The couple had eight children, including Arietta Minthorn Tompkins (born July 31, 1800), who married a son of Smith Thompson in 1818, and (Mangle) Minthorne Tompkins (December 26, 1807 – June 5, 1881), who was the Free Soil Party candidate for Governor of New York in 1852. The Tompkinses also fostered Henry Brewerton (1801–1879), who was orphaned at a young age. Brewerton entered West Point in 1813, served as an engineer officer during the American Civil War and retired from the Army in 1867.

The Tompkinsville section of Staten Island was named after him; in 1815, Tompkins established a settlement along the eastern shore of the island with the purchase of the Van Buskirk Farm in New Brighton and property on Grymes Hill. His main residence was located on Fort Hill, near Fort Place which burned down in 1874.

Their children Hannah and Minthorne were named after their mother, and Hannah and Minthorne streets in Staten Island are named for them. Staten Island&#x27;s Westervelt Avenue is named for daughter Hannah&#x27;s husband. Hannah was ill in the year before her husband became vice president, and did not attend his inauguration. She survived him by nearly four years in Tompkinsville, Staten Island.

==Governor==
On April 30, 1807, he defeated the incumbent Governor Morgan LewisTompkins received 35,074 votes, Lewis 30,989 – and remained in office as Governor of New York until 1817. He was reelected in 1810, defeating Jonas PlattTompkins received 43,094 votes, Jonas Platt received 36,484. In 1813 he defeated Stephen Van RensselaerTompkins received 43,324 votes, Van Rensselaer received 39,718and in 1816, he beat Rufus KingTompkins received 45,412 votes, King received 38,647. Tompkins was supported by DeWitt Clinton in his first run for office, but Tompkins later broke with Clinton by supporting James Madison over Clinton in the 1808 presidential election.

During the War of 1812, Tompkins proved to be one of the most effective war governors. He played an important role in reorganizing the state militia and promoted the formation of a standing state military force based on select conscription. He declined an appointment as United States Secretary of State by President James Madison in 1814, instead accepting appointment as commander of the federal military district that included New York City.

Tompkins was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814.

In 1815 Tompkins established a settlement along the eastern shore of Staten Island that came to be called Tompkinsville. He built a dock along the waterfront in the neighborhood in 1817 and began offering daily ferry service between Staten Island and Manhattan. In 1816 he purchased much of the land later known as Tompkinsville from the Church of St. Andrew, but his financial troubles later led the church to foreclose. His son-in-law and daughter, Dr. John S. and Hannah Westervelt then bought the property, which they later divided into many lots to sell off.

In 1817, Governor Tompkins suggested that July 4, 1827, be set as the date on which all slaves in New York state—including those who were born before the Gradual Manumission Act of July 4, 1799, (and who were therefore not eligible for freedom)—should be freed. This was subsequently marked by African Americans in the state by a Fifth of July celebration.

==Vice presidency (1817–1825)==
Many New York Democratic-Republicans supported Tompkins for president in the 1816 presidential election, but James Monroe received the party&#x27;s nomination. Tompkins was instead elected vice president as Monroe&#x27;s running mate. Tompkins was re-elected in 1820. He served from March 4, 1817, to March 4, 1825. In April 1820, while serving as vice president, he ran for Governor of New York against incumbent DeWitt Clinton. Tompkins lost, 45,900 votes to 47,447. He was a delegate to the 1821 New York State Constitutional Convention, serving as its president.
When Tompkins became vice president, he was in poor health, due to a fall from a horse on November 3, 1814. His finances were also quite poor. During the War of 1812, he had personally financed New York&#x27;s war effort with borrowed money, but did not adequately document his expenses. Both the New York legislature and the federal government refused him full reimbursement. He also slipped into alcoholism. With poor physical and financial health, Tompkins spent much of his vice presidency outside of Washington, D.C., and made for a poor presiding officer of the Senate while it debated the Missouri Compromise in 1820. In 1823, Tompkins finally won compensation from the federal government, but he continued to drink heavily and was unable to resolve his business affairs.

== Freemasonry ==
Apart from his political career, Tompkins was an active Freemason throughout his life. He was a member of Hiram Lodge 72, Mount Pleasant, New York and became Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of New York from 1820 to 1822. The Daniel D. Tompkins Memorial Chapel at the Masonic Home in Utica, New York was built in his honor in 1911. The Grand Lodge of New York celebrated the centennial of the chapel on June 25, 2011.

He also served as the first Sovereign Grand Commander of the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction Scottish Rite, a branch of Freemasonry. Tompkins served in this capacity from 1813 to 1825, although he did not devote much time to the newly formed group.

==Death==

Tompkins died in Tompkinsville on June 11, 1825, 10 days before his 51st birthday. He was interred in the Minthorne vault in the west yard of St. Mark&#x27;s Church in-the-Bowery, New York City, as was his wife. His post-vice presidency lifespan is the shortest of any US vice president, and he also lived the shortest life of any US vice president. He was the youngest US vice president until John C. Breckinridge took office in 1857 at 36, and the only 19th-century vice president to serve two terms under the same president, and two full terms at all.

==Legacy==
The Tompkinsville neighborhood of Staten Island is named for Tompkins, and the streets in that neighborhood are named for his children. Tompkins Masonic Lodge #471 in that same section of Staten Island is also named for him. Tompkins is credited with being one of the founding members of the Brighton Heights Reformed Church on Staten Island. The church was founded in 1823, during his term as vice president. Its first meeting place was in New York Marine Hospital (then known as the Quarantine), a predecessor of the immigration facility on Ellis Island.

Four forts in New York State in the War of 1812 were named for Governor Tompkins, in Staten Island, Sackets Harbor, Buffalo, and Plattsburgh.

Tompkins Park in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York (now called Herbert Von King Park) was named after Tompkins. The nearby Tompkins Avenue and Tompkins Public Houses are likewise named.

Tompkins County in New York, Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan, Public School 69 Daniel D. Tompkins School in Staten Island, and the Town of Tompkins are named after him, as is Tompkins Road, running between Post Road (NY-22) and Fenimore Road in Scarsdale, New York.

Tompkinsville, Kentucky, is named for Tompkins. It is the county seat of Monroe County, Kentucky, which is named for the president under whom Tompkins served as vice president.

Tompkins was mentioned by Kris Kringle in the 1947 film &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;. The screenplay was incorrect, however, in that Kringle mentions that Tompkins served as vice president under John Quincy Adams when Adams&#x27;s vice president was actually John C. Calhoun. Tompkins was the sixth vice president and Adams was the sixth president, leading to confusion in the script.

American actor and producer Richard Kollmar, husband of columnist and TV personality Dorothy Kilgallen, was a great-great-grandchild of Tompkins.

<text>Deoxycytidine is a deoxyribonucleoside, a component of deoxyribonucleic acid. It is similar to the ribonucleoside cytidine, but with one hydroxyl group removed from the C2&#x27; position.

Deoxycytidine can be phosphorylated at C5&#x27; of the deoxyribose by deoxycytidine kinase, converting it to deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP), a DNA precursor. dCMP can be converted to dUMP and dTMP.

It can also be used as a precursor for 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, a treatment for MDS patients. This compound slows the cell cycle by interfering with the methylation of the P15/INK4B gene, increasing the expression of P15/INK4B protein which subdues the transformation of MDS to leukemia.

Deoxycytidine can also serve as a biomarker for tumor diagnosis. Deoxycytidine can be used as a biomarker for breast cancer patients and healthy individuals. 5-(Hydroxymethyl)-2′-deoxycytidine (5-hmdC), 5-(formyl)-2′-deoxycytidine (5-fodC), and 5-(carboxyl)-2′-deoxycytidine (5-cadC) are intermediates in the DNA demethylation pathway and can act as biomarkers. 5-hmdC levels were significantly reduced in urine samples of breast cancer patients, while 5-fodC and 5-cadC levels were elevated.

<doc id="89105" wikidata="Q422573" url="?curid=89105" title="Uridine">
<text>Uridine (symbol U or Urd) is a glycosylated pyrimidine analog containing uracil attached to a ribose ring (or more specifically, a ribofuranose) via a β-N1-glycosidic bond. The analog is one of the five standard nucleosides which make up nucleic acids, the others being adenosine, thymidine, cytidine and guanosine. The five nucleosides are commonly abbreviated to their symbols, U, A, dT, C, and G, respectively. However, thymidine is more commonly written as &#x27;dT&#x27; (&#x27;d&#x27; represents &#x27;deoxy&#x27;) as it contains a 2&#x27;-deoxyribofuranose moiety rather than the ribofuranose ring found in uridine. This is because thymidine is found in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and usually not in ribonucleic acid (RNA). Conversely, uridine is found in RNA and not DNA. The remaining three nucleosides may be found in both RNA and DNA. In RNA, they would be represented as A, C and G whereas in DNA they would be represented as dA, dC and dG.

== Biosynthesis ==
Uridine is widely produced in nature as uridine monophosphate (uridylate) by de novo synthesis by the decarboxylation of orotidylate, which is catalyzed by orotidylate decarboxylase. The orotidylate is produced from orotate, which is combined with 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) to form orotidylate by pyrimidine phosphoribosyltransferase. PRPP is created from ribose-5-phosphate by a further phosphorylation, serving as an energetic molecule to drive the reaction forward, while orotate is generated in several steps from carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate.

==Dietary sources==
Uridine is regarded as a non-essential nutrient, as it is produced by the human body as needed and supplementation is not generally recommended, though it has been explored for specific applications. 

Some foods that contain uridine in the form of RNA are listed below. Although claimed that virtually none of the uridine in this form is bioavailable &quot;since – as shown by Handschumacher&#x27;s Laboratory at Yale School of Medicine in 1981 – it is destroyed in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, and no food, when consumed, has ever been reliably shown to elevate blood uridine levels&#x27;. This is contradicted by Yamamoto et al., plasma uridine levels rose 1.8-fold 30 minutes after beer ingestion, suggesting, at the very least, conflicting data. On the other hand, ethanol on its own (which is present in beer) increases uridine levels, which may explain the raise of uridine levels in the study by Yamamoto et al.
In infants consuming mother&#x27;s milk or commercial infant formulas, uridine is present as its monophosphate, UMP, which is both bioavailable and able to enter the circulation from the digestive tract.

*goat&#x27;s and sheep&#x27;s milk and milk products
* Sugarcane extract
* Tomatoes (0.5 to 1.0 g uridine per kilogram dry weight)
* Brewer&#x27;s yeast (1.7% uridine by dry weight)
* Beer 
* Broccoli
* Organ meats (liver, pancreas, etc.)

Consumption of RNA-rich foods may lead to high levels of purines (adenine and guanosine) in blood. High levels of purines are known to increase uric acid production and may aggravate or lead to conditions such as gout.

Harvard researchers report that omega-3 fatty acids and uridine, two substances in foods such as fish, walnuts, molasses, and sugar beets, prevented depression in rats as effectively as antidepressant drugs. &quot;Giving rats a combination of uridine and omega-3 fatty acids produced immediate effects that were indistinguishable from those caused by giving the rats standard antidepressant medications,&quot; said lead author of the study William Carlezon, director of McLean&#x27;s Behavioral Genetics Laboratory.

==Galactose glycolysis==
Uridine plays a role in the glycolysis pathway of galactose. There is no catabolic process to metabolize galactose. Therefore, galactose is converted to glucose and metabolized in the common glucose pathway. Once the incoming galactose has been converted into galactose 1-phosphate (Gal-1-P), it is involved in a reaction with UDP-glucose, a glucose molecule bonded to uridine diphosphate (UDP). This process is catalyzed by the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase and transfers the UDP to the galactose molecule. The end result is UDP-galactose and glucose-1-phosphate. This process is continued to allow the proper glycolysis of galactose.

<doc id="89106" wikidata="Q1503120" url="?curid=89106" title="Paris–Brest–Paris">
<text>Paris–Brest–Paris (PBP) is a long-distance cycling event. It was originally a bicycle race in France from Paris to Brest and back to Paris in 1891. The last time it was run as a race was 1951. The most recent edition of PBP was held on 20 August 2023. 

In 1931 amateur cyclists were separated from professionals. There are two independent long distance bicycle tours. One is the &quot;brevet&quot; (also called &quot;randonnée&quot;) organised by the Audax Club Parisien, in which cyclists ride individually. The goal is to make it within 90 hours, but with no competition. This event is held every four years. The other is an &quot;audax&quot; organised by the Union des Audax Françaises where cyclists ride in a group.

==The &quot;brevet&quot;==
As in all &quot;brevet&quot; events, there is emphasis on self-sufficiency. Riders buy supplies anywhere along the course, but support by motorized vehicles is prohibited except at checkpoints. There is a 90-hour limit and the clock runs continuously. Many riders sleep as little as possible, sometimes catching a few minutes beside the road before continuing.

Participants must first complete a series of &quot;brevets&quot; (randonneuring events) within the same 12-month timeframe. For participants from most countries, the period coincides with the calendar year. The exception is riders from Oceania, for whom a different timeframe is used, to place the focus on events in the southern hemisphere summer. A series consists of 200 km, 300 km, 400 km and 600 km. Each can be replaced by a longer ride. Prior to 2007, the qualifying rides had to be completed from shortest to longest.

Where once PBP was contested by a few professionals as a demonstration of the bicycle&#x27;s potential, today the focus is on the ordinary rider.

===Controls===
In 2015, the controls were in the following towns. All controls except for St Quentin and Brest are visited in both the westbound and eastbound directions.
* Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (start and finish)
* Dreux 
* Mortagne-au-Perche 
* Villaines-la-Juhel
* Fougères
* Tinténiac
* Quédillac
* Loudéac 
* Saint-Nicolas-du-Pélem
* Carhaix-Plouguer
* Brest

The 2019 event started and ended at the National Sheepfold, Rambouillet and the 2023 event in front of the castle of Rambouillet.

==History==

Pierre Giffard of &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot; staged the first &quot;Paris-Brest et retour&quot;. Despite changes, Paris–Brest–Paris continues to this day as the oldest long-distance cycling road event.

===1891 ===
In an era when diamond safety frames and pneumatic tires were taking over from high-wheelers with solid rubber tires, Paris-Brest was an &quot;épreuve,&quot; a test of the bicycle&#x27;s reliability. Giffard promoted the event through editorials signed &quot;Jean-sans-Terre.&quot; He wrote of self-sufficient riders carrying their own food and clothing. Riders would ride the same bicycle for the duration. Only Frenchmen were allowed to enter, and 207 participated.

The first (1891) Paris-Brest saw Michelin&#x27;s Charles Terront and Dunlop&#x27;s Jiel-Laval contest the lead. Terront prevailed, passing Jiel-Laval as he slept during the third night, to finish in 71 hours 22 minutes. Both had flats that took an hour to repair but enjoyed an advantage over riders on solid tires. Ultimately, 99 of the 207 finished.

The race was a coup for &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot;, bringing circulation increases. However, the logistics were daunting enough that organizers settled on a ten-year interval between editions.

====1891 Quadricycle====
Perhaps the most unusual entrant was a petrol-powered Peugeot Type 3 Quadricycle, driven by Auguste Doriot and Louis Rigoulot. In order to publicly prove its reliability and performance Armand Peugeot had persuaded Pierre Giffard to have its progress certified by his network of monitors and marshals, the distance being about three times further than any road vehicle had travelled before. After a 3-day journey from Valentigny to Paris, they started immediately behind the bicycles. They covered 200 kilometres on the first day and 160 km on the second, but then lost 24 hours when a gear failed near Morlaix. After effecting a repair using local resources (a shoemaker&#x27;s tools) they arrived at Brest after dark where they were received by a large crowd and the local Peugeot bicycle dealer.

For comparison, by the time Doriot and Rigoulot had reached Brest, Charles Terront and Jiel Laval had already returned to Paris. The next day they set off for Paris where they completed the trip 6 days after the cyclists.

===1901 to 1951 ===

The 1901 Paris-Brest was sponsored not only by &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot; but &quot;L&#x27;Auto-Velo&quot;, edited by Henri Desgrange. For the first time, professionals were segregated from the &quot;touriste-routier&quot; group (in which a 65-year-old finished in just over 200 hours). The newspapers organized a telegraph system to relay results to their Paris presses, and the public followed the exploits of Maurice Garin, who won in just over 52 hours over 112 other professionals.

So many newspapers were sold that Géo Lefèvre at L&#x27;Auto suggested an even bigger race, the Tour de France. Under Henri Desgrange&#x27;s leadership, the first Tour happened in 1903.

The 1911 event saw pack riding rather than solo breaks. Five riders stayed together until nearly the last control, Emile Georget finally pulling away from Ernest Paul to finish in 50 hours and 13 minutes.

The 1921 event, following World War I, was small, with 43 professionals and 65 touriste-routiers. It was fought between Eugène Christophe and Lucien Mottiat, Mottiat finally prevailing in 55 hours 7 minutes.

In 1931, there was a change in the regulations. Proposed by André Griffe (president of the Union des Audax Cyclistes Parisiens), Desgrange (president of l&#x27;Auto) replaced the &quot;touriste-routier&quot; group by an Audax, where cyclists rode in groups of 10 at an average 20kmh (22.5kmh since 1961).

Many people disliked that change. So Camille Durand (president of the Audax Club Parisien, ACP) organised another PBP at the same time on the same road. Cyclists could ride individually (French &quot;allure libre&quot;) and there was a limit of 96 hours. 57 participated, among them two women, a tandem with two men, four mixed tandems and a triplet.

The 1931 professional event saw victory by Australian Hubert Opperman with a sprint on the finish velodrome after his long solo breakaway was neutralized just outside Paris. Opperman&#x27;s finishing time was a record 49 hours 21 minutes, despite constant rain. His diet included 12 pounds of celery, which he thought an important energy source (celery&#x27;s energy content is minuscule, but it may have been a source of fluid and salt).

Owing to World War II, the 1941 PBP was postponed to 1948, when L&#x27;Equipe sponsored the event. Of 52 pros, Albert Hendrickx proved strongest, winning in a sprint over fellow Belgian François Neuville.

Three years later, the 1951 event saw Maurice Diot win in a record time of 38 hours 55 minutes. It is the last time PBP has been raced by professionals and from then on the course used smaller roads and more hills. Diot won a sprint over breakaway companion Eduoard Muller after waiting for Muller to fix a puncture in Trappes, 22 km from the finish.

===1956 to present: amateur event===
Though listed on the professional calendar in 1956 and 1961, too few racers signed up to make the event happen. Nonetheless, hundreds of randonneurs turned out. And the randonneur division even featured racing, René Herse-sponsored Roger Baumann winning over Lheuillier in 52 hours 19 minutes.

PBP was held every five years between 1956 and 1975, with more participants and less media coverage. From 1948 until the 1980s, the randonneur event included a &quot;Challenge des Constructeurs&quot; for the bicycle maker with the three best-placed riders. René Herse won this &quot;Challenge&quot; every time from 1948 until 1971, and again in 1975. No other builder won the &quot;Challenge&quot; more than once.

The Belgian former professional Herman de Munck came 5th in 66, first in 71, 75, 79 and 83. He was disqualified in 79, most believe unfairly. De Munck continues to place highly, finishing the 1999 PBP 109th place at the age of 60.

The randonneur Paris–Brest–Paris has always allowed women to participate. In 1975, Chantal de la Cruz and Nicole Chabriand lowered the women&#x27;s time to 57 hours. In 1979, Suzy de Carvalho finished in 57h02m.

American Scott Dickson came third in 1979, though at just less than 49 hours he was four hours behind the winners. In 1983 he again came third, this time by only one hour. He won his first PBP in 1987 by breaking away in Brest, aided by a tailwind and a few strong riders from the &quot;touring&quot; group, which that year started many hours before the &quot;racing&quot; group. Dickson also won in 1991 and in 1995.

Susan Notorangelo set a women&#x27;s record of 54 hours 40 minutes in 1983, this was bettered in 1995 when by Brigitte Kerlouet 44 hours 14 minutes. American Melinda Lyon finished as first woman in 1999 and 2003. In 2007 the first woman was Christiane Thibault, and in 2011 it was Isabelle Esclangon, both from France.

The 2007 Paris–Brest–Paris was the first poor weather event since 1987. It was the worst weather PBP riders had faced since 1956. 30.2% failed to finish.

==Time limits==
There are three groups of riders:
*The &quot;vedettes&quot; (&quot;stars&quot;) are elite riders and have a time limit of 80 hours, although some will complete the ride considerably faster. The &quot;vedettes&quot; are first to depart on the Sunday afternoon.
*The &quot;touristes&quot; are the largest group and have a time limit of 90 hours, departing in waves on the Sunday evening. 
*The &quot;randonneurs&quot; are a smaller group and have a time limit of 84 hours (representing the minimum average speed of 14.3km/h). This group departs early on the Monday morning.

==Winners==
Although the History of PBP website mentions that PBP started as a race, according to the official PBP website &quot;the organizers strongly feel that PBP is not a race&quot;.

This is an extremely important aspect of randonneuring, where &quot;riders aim to complete the course within specified time limits, and receive equal recognition regardless of their finishing order.&quot; So there is no actual &quot;winner,&quot; but a &quot;first finisher.&quot;

===Professional era===
=== Amateur era ===
==Pastry==
The Paris–Brest, a French dessert made of choux pastry and a praline flavoured cream, with a circular shape representative of a tyre or wheel, was reportedly created in 1891 to commemorate the race. It became popular with participants, partly because of its energy-giving high caloric value, and is now found in pâtisseries all over France.

<text>The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao is a museum of modern and contemporary art in Bilbao (Biscay), Spain. It is one of several museums affiliated to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and features permanent and visiting exhibits of works by Spanish and international artists. It was inaugurated on 18 October 1997 by King Juan Carlos I of Spain, with an exhibition of 250 contemporary works of art. It is one of the largest museums in Spain.

The building, designed by Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry, was built alongside the Nervion River, which runs through the city to the Cantabrian Sea. A work of contemporary architecture, it has been hailed as a &quot;signal moment in the architectural culture&quot;, because it represents &quot;one of those rare moments when critics, academics, and the general public were all completely united about something&quot;, according to architectural critic Paul Goldberger. The museum was the building most frequently named as one of the most important works completed since 1980 in the 2010 World Architecture Survey among architecture experts.

==History==
===Founding===
In 1991, the Basque Government suggested to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation that it would fund a Guggenheim museum to be built in Bilbao&#x27;s decrepit port area, once the city&#x27;s main source of income. The Basque government agreed to cover the US$100 million construction cost, to create a US$50 million acquisitions fund, to pay a one-time US$20 million fee to the Guggenheim and to subsidize the museum&#x27;s US$12 million annual budget. In exchange, the foundation agreed to manage the institution, rotate parts of its permanent collection through the Bilbao museum and organize temporary exhibitions.

The museum was built by Ferrovial, at a cost of US$89 million. About 5,000 residents of Bilbao attended a preopening extravaganza outside the museum on the night preceding the official opening, featuring an outdoor light show and concerts. On 18 October 1997 the museum was opened by Juan Carlos I of Spain.
On the 13 October, two ETA militants shot dead a Basque policeman who interrupted their attempt to set up grenade launchers to attack the opening.
===Urdaibai expansion===
In 2008, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao announced that it was looking into building a expansion in Urdaibai, an estuary to the east of Bilbao. By 2022, the government of the Biscay province presented plans to put €40 million toward the expansion.

==Building==
=== Architecture ===

The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation selected Frank Gehry as the architect, and its director, Thomas Krens, encouraged him to design something daring and innovative. The curves on the exterior of the building were intended to appear random; the architect said that &quot;the randomness of the curves are designed to catch the light&quot;. The interior &quot;is designed around a large, light-filled atrium with views of Bilbao&#x27;s estuary and the surrounding hills of the Basque country&quot;. The atrium, which Gehry nicknamed &quot;The Flower&quot; because of its shape, serves as the organizing center of the museum.

When the museum opened to the public in 1997, it was immediately hailed as one of the world&#x27;s most spectacular buildings in the style of Deconstructivism (although Gehry does not associate himself with that architectural movement), a masterpiece of the 20th century. Architect Philip Johnson described it as &quot;the greatest building of our time&quot;, while critic Calvin Tomkins, in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, characterized it as &quot;a fantastic dream ship of undulating form in a cloak of titanium,&quot; its brilliantly reflective panels also reminiscent of fish scales. Herbert Muschamp praised its &quot;mercurial brilliance&quot; in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; calls the museum &quot;an astonishing architectural feat&quot;.
The museum is seamlessly integrated into the urban context, unfolding its interconnecting shapes of stone, glass and titanium on a site along the Nervión River in the ancient industrial heart of the city; while modest from street level, it is most impressive when viewed from the river. With a total , of which are dedicated to exhibition space, it had more exhibition space than the three Guggenheim collections in New York and Venice combined at that time. The 11,000 m2 of exhibition space are distributed over nineteen galleries, ten of which follow a classic orthogonal plan that can be identified from the exterior by their stone finishes. The remaining nine galleries are irregularly shaped and can be identified from the outside by their swirling organic forms and titanium cladding. The largest gallery measures 30 meters wide and 130 meters long (98 ft × 427 ft). In 2005, it housed Richard Serra&#x27;s monumental installation &quot;The Matter of Time&quot;, which Robert Hughes dubbed &quot;courageous and sublime&quot;.

The building was constructed on time and budget, which is rare for architecture of this type. In an interview in &quot;Harvard Design Magazine&quot;, Gehry explained how he did it. First, he ensured that what he calls the &quot;organization of the artist&quot; prevailed during construction, to prevent political and business interests from interfering with the design. Second, he made sure he had a detailed and realistic cost estimate before proceeding. Third, he used computer visualizations produced by Rick Smith employing Dassault Systemes&#x27; CATIA V3 software and collaborated closely with the individual building trades to control costs during construction.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines donated $1,000,000 towards its construction.

=== Foundation ===
The museum building used more than of concrete, or , as it required deep and solid foundations. The foundation was laid on reinforced concrete piles driven into the bedrock at an average depth of .

The building sits on a clay base from the bed of the nearby Estuary of Bilbao and required the embedment of 665 pilings piles, driven into the ground by boring machines.

=== Cladding ===

The base of the building is covered with beige limestone from the Huéscar quarries near Granada, cut from thick slabs. The building is clear thanks to the walls, specially treated to protect the interior from the effects of the sun. The glass of the windows has also been treated to prevent light from damaging the exposed pieces.

It is clad in titanium plates, arranged in scales, on a galvanized steel structure. The museum&#x27;s exterior skin is made of 33,000 titanium plates, a material that has been used to replace copper or lead because of their toxicity. Many tests have been carried out with different materials to find one that would withstand heat and bad weather, while maintaining its character. It was during this research process that tests were started on titanium samples and the best treatment was found.

Its lamination process is delicate and has to be done in places with high energy sources, that is why the laminated parts were made in Pittsburgh, in the United States, the rolling allowed to obtain titanium plates only thick, which is much thinner than if steel plates had been used. Moreover, titanium is about half the weight of steel, and the museum&#x27;s titanium coating represents only 60 tons.

During the conception, the pieces were designed to resist the bad weather, that is why a quilted rather than undulated shape was chosen, to resist the wind, and to avoid vibrations during storms.

Titanium is a low-polluting material, and each part has been designed differently according to its orientation on the building, so they correspond perfectly with the curves desired by Gehry.

==Virtual Building==
In the fall of 1993, architects at Gehry Partners began to use Dassault Systèmes&#x27; CATIA software for the schematic design phase of the museum to digitize and model the exterior of the museum project. Essentially, this software calculated point by point the stresses to which materials are subjected, by generating a 3D model showing the different tensions and allowing the values of many structural elements of the museum to be calculated: the steel structure, titanium cladding or foundations, among others. It also helped to automate the cutting of materials such as stone or titanium plates.

The architects applied Master Modeling and Virtual Build Processes they learned from Rick Smith and his use of the same techniques on the Walt Disney Concert Hall during the previous two years. The success and global awareness of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao ushered in a new era of Virtual Building and was a catalyst for what would become popularly known as Building Information Modeling seven years later.

Pulitzer Prize-winning architectural critic Paul Goldberger shares the words of others that Bilbao &quot;could not have been constructed without CATIA&quot;. He further stated that Bilbao &quot;was the first building for which CATIA played a role in almost every aspect of the design and construction process&quot;.

==Exhibitions==
The museum houses &quot;large-scale, site-specific works and installations by contemporary artists&quot;, such as Richard Serra&#x27;s &quot;Snake&quot;, and displays the work of Basque artists, &quot;as well as housing a selection of works&quot; from the foundation&#x27;s modern art collection. In 1997, the museum opened with &quot;The Guggenheim Museums and the Art of This Century&quot;, a 300-piece overview of 20th-century art from Cubism to new media art. Most pieces came from the Guggenheim&#x27;s permanent collection, but the museum also acquired paintings by Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still and commissioned new works by Francesco Clemente, Anselm Kiefer, Jenny Holzer and Richard Serra.

The exhibitions change often; the museum generally hosts thematic exhibitions, centered for example on Chinese or Russian art. Traditional paintings and sculptures are a minority compared to installations and electronic forms. The highlight of the collection, and its only permanent exhibit, is &quot;The Matter of Time&quot; (incorporating an earlier work, &quot;Snake&quot;), a series of weathering steel sculptures designed by Serra, which is housed in the 130-meter Arcelor Gallery (formerly known as the Fish Gallery but renamed in 2005 for the steel manufacturer that sponsored the project). The collections usually highlight Avant-garde art, 20th century abstraction, and non-objective art. When the museum announced the 2011 exhibition &quot;The Luminous Interval&quot;, a show of artwork belonging to Greek businessman Dimitris Daskalopoulos, who is also a museum trustee, this met with criticism of, among other things, too much curatorial power for a serious benefactor. In 2005, Olivier Berggruen and Ingrid Pfeiffer curated a retrospective of Yves Klein.
In 2012 David Hockney&#x27;s exhibition drew over 290,000 visitors to the museum.
==Economic and media impact==
The museum was opened as part of a revitalization effort for the city of Bilbao. Almost immediately after its opening, the Guggenheim Bilbao became a popular tourist attraction, drawing visitors from around the globe. In its first three years, almost 4 million tourists visited the museum, helping to generate about €500 million in economic activity. The regional council estimated that the money visitors spent on hotels, restaurants, shops and transport allowed it to collect €100 million in taxes, which more than paid for the building cost.
The building was featured in the 1999 James Bond film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; in the pre-title sequence and the Tamil film &quot;Sivaji&quot; (2007), in which it is the setting for the music video of the song &quot;Style&quot;, composed by A. R. Rahman. Mariah Carey&#x27;s music video &quot;Sweetheart&quot;, directed by Hype Williams, shows singers Jermaine Dupri and Carey in various locations at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao.

==Criticism==
The so-called &quot;Bilbao effect&quot; refers to how the museum transformed the city. The term, however, has also been employed by critics who have denounced the museum as a symbol of gentrification and cultural imperialism. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; suggested that the Bilbao effect should be called the Bilbao anomaly, &quot;for the iconic chemistry between the design of building, its image and the public turns out to be rather rare.&quot;

Art critic Brian O&#x27;Doherty was positive about approaching the building but criticized the museum&#x27;s interior effect, saying &quot;[O]nce you get indoors things are a little different. Even the so-called site-specific works didn&#x27;t look too happy to me. Most of the interior spaces are too vast.&quot; He went on to describe how works by Braque, Picasso and Rodchenko &quot;looked absurd&quot; and tiny on the museum&#x27;s walls.

==Controversies==
===Management and 2007 embezzlement incident===
According to a report issued in 2007 by the Basque Court of Auditors, the museum paid more than US$27 million for the acquisition of art between 2002 and 2005, including Serra&#x27;s &quot;The Matter of Time&quot; for the cavernous ground-floor gallery. After another audit in 2008 revealed that money was missing from accounts, the foundation said that it filed a case against the director, Roberto Cearsolo Barrenetxea, &quot;for financial and accounting irregularities&quot;, asserting that he had admitted diverting money from two companies that manage the Guggenheim Bilbao building and its art collection to his own account since 1998.

===2021–2022 strike===
In 2021–2022, the eighteen cleaners (mostly women) went on strike for nine months until they got raises and full-time contracts.

<doc id="89108" wikidata="Q190012" url="?curid=89108" title="Adenosine">
<text>Adenosine (symbol A) is an organic compound that occurs widely in nature in the form of diverse derivatives. The molecule consists of an adenine attached to a ribose via a β-N9-glycosidic bond. Adenosine is one of the four nucleoside building blocks of RNA (and its derivative deoxyadenosine is a building block of DNA), which are essential for all life on Earth. Its derivatives include the energy carriers adenosine mono-, di-, and triphosphate, also known as AMP/ADP/ATP. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is pervasive in signal transduction. Adenosine is used as an intravenous medication for some cardiac arrhythmias.

Adenosyl (abbreviated Ado or 5&#x27;-dAdo) is the chemical group formed by removal of the 5′-hydroxy (OH) group. It is found in adenosylcobalamin (an active form of vitamin B12) and as a radical in the radical SAM enzymes.

== Medical uses ==
=== Supraventricular tachycardia ===
In individuals with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), adenosine is a first line treatment used to help identify and convert the rhythm.

Certain SVTs can be successfully terminated with adenosine. This includes any re-entrant arrhythmias that require the AV node for the re-entry, e.g., AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) and AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). In addition, atrial tachycardia can sometimes be terminated with adenosine.

Fast rhythms of the heart that are confined to the atria (e.g., atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter) or ventricles (e.g., monomorphic ventricular tachycardia), and do not involve the AV node as part of the re-entrant circuit, are not typically converted by adenosine. However, the ventricular response rate is temporarily slowed with adenosine in such cases.

Because of the effects of adenosine on AV node-dependent SVTs, adenosine is considered a class V antiarrhythmic agent. When adenosine is used to cardiovert an abnormal rhythm, it is normal for the heart to enter ventricular asystole for a few seconds. This can be disconcerting to a normally conscious patient, and is associated with angina-like sensations in the chest.

=== Nuclear stress test ===
Adenosine is used as an adjunct to thallium (TI 201) or technetium (Tc99m) myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (nuclear stress test) in patients unable to undergo adequate stress testing with exercise.

=== Dosage ===
When used to treat SVT, adenosine is administered intravenously as a rapid bolus (typically 0.10–0.15 mg/kg initially) over 1-2 seconds, followed by a rapid saline flush (often using a 2-way or 3-way stopcock). If the initial dose is ineffective, it may be repeated every 2 minutes with a slightly increased dose (0.05–0.1 mg/kg increments) every 2 minutes up to a maximum total dose of 0.3 mg/kg (not exceeding 12 mg). Due to adenosine&#x27;s extremely short half-life (less than 10 seconds), it is often injected through a central venous line or a large proximal peripheral vein; administration into lower extremities, PICC lines, or smaller veins may lead to therapeutic failure due to rapid metabolism before reaching the heart. When given to dilate the arteries, such as in a &quot;stress test&quot;, the dosage is typically 0.14 mg/kg/min, administered for 4 or 6 minutes, depending on the protocol.

The recommended dose may be increased in patients on theophylline since methylxanthines prevent binding of adenosine at receptor sites. The dose is often decreased in patients on dipyridamole (Persantine) and diazepam (Valium) because adenosine potentiates the effects of these drugs. The recommended dose is also reduced by half in patients presenting congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, shock, hypoxia, and/or chronic liver disease or chronic kidney disease, and in elderly patients.

==Adverse effects==
Adverse effects associated with adenosine administration are primarily due to its activation of adenosine receptors on vascular tissue, resulting in vasodilation. Side effects of adenosine include skin flushing, lightheadedness, nausea, sweating, nervousness, numbness, and a sense of impending doom. These effects are typically very short-lived due to adenosine&#x27;s rapid metabolism and short half-life. Less common, but more serious, cardiovascular effects can occur, such as cardiac arrhythmias (including premature atrial and ventricular contractions and atrioventricular (AV) block), hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and prolonged asystole.

== Drug interactions ==
Dipyridamole potentiates the action of adenosine, requiring the use of lower doses.
Methylxanthines (e.g. caffeine found in coffee, theophylline found in tea, or theobromine found in chocolate) have a purine structure and bind to some of the same receptors as adenosine. Methylxanthines act as competitive antagonists of adenosine and can blunt its pharmacological effects. Individuals taking large quantities of methylxanthines may require increased doses of adenosine.

Caffeine acts by blocking binding of adenosine to the adenosine A1 receptor, which enhances release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Caffeine also increases cyclic AMP levels through nonselective inhibition of phosphodiesterase. &quot;Caffeine has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of adenosine,&quot; which allows it to bind and block its receptors.

== Contraindications ==
Common contraindications for adenosine include
* Asthma, traditionally considered an absolute contraindication. This is being contested, and it is now considered a relative contraindication (however, selective adenosine antagonists are being investigated for use in treatment of asthma)

== Pharmacological effects ==
Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that modulates many physiological processes. Cellular signaling by adenosine occurs through four known adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3).

Extracellular adenosine concentrations from normal cells are approximately 300 nM; however, in response to cellular damage (e.g., in inflammatory or ischemic tissue), these concentrations are quickly elevated (600–1,200 nM). Thus, in regard to stress or injury, the function of adenosine is primarily that of cytoprotection preventing tissue damage during instances of hypoxia, ischemia, and seizure activity. Activation of A2A receptors produces a constellation of responses that in general can be classified as anti-inflammatory. Enzymatic production of adenosine can be anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive.

=== Adenosine receptors ===

All adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) are G-protein-coupled receptors. The four receptor subtypes are further classified based on their ability to either stimulate or inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. The A1 receptors couple to Gi/o and decrease cAMP levels, while the A2 adenosine receptors couple to Gs, which stimulates adenylate cyclase activity. In addition, A1 receptors couple to Go, which has been reported to mediate adenosine inhibition of Ca2+ conductance, whereas A2B and A3 receptors also couple to Gq and stimulate phospholipase activity.
Researchers at Cornell University have recently shown adenosine receptors to be key in opening the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
Mice dosed with adenosine have shown increased transport across the BBB of amyloid plaque antibodies and prodrugs associated with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Alzheimer&#x27;s, multiple sclerosis, and cancers of the central nervous system.

=== Ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor ===
Adenosine is an endogenous agonist of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor. However, while it is able to increase appetite, unlike other agonists of this receptor, adenosine is unable to induce the secretion of growth hormone and increase its plasma levels.

=== Mechanism of action ===
When it is administered intravenously, adenosine causes transient heart block in the atrioventricular (AV) node. This is mediated via the A1 receptor, inhibiting adenylyl cyclase, reducing cAMP and so causing cell hyperpolarization by increasing K+ efflux via inward rectifier K+ channels, subsequently inhibiting Ca2+ current. It also causes endothelial-dependent relaxation of smooth muscle as is found inside the artery walls. This causes dilation of the &quot;normal&quot; segments of arteries, i.e. where the endothelium is not separated from the tunica media by atherosclerotic plaque. This feature allows physicians to use adenosine to test for blockages in the coronary arteries, by exaggerating the difference between the normal and abnormal segments.

The administration of adenosine also reduces blood flow to coronary arteries past the occlusion. Other coronary arteries dilate when adenosine is administered while the segment past the occlusion is already maximally dilated, which is a process called coronary steal. This leads to less blood reaching the ischemic tissue, which in turn produces the characteristic chest pain.

== Metabolism ==
Adenosine used as a second messenger can be the result of &quot;de novo&quot; purine biosynthesis via adenosine monophosphate (AMP), though it is possible other pathways exist.

When adenosine enters the circulation, it is broken down by adenosine deaminase, which is present in red blood cells and the vessel wall.

Dipyridamole, an inhibitor of adenosine nucleoside transporter, allows adenosine to accumulate in the blood stream. This causes an increase in coronary vasodilatation.

Adenosine deaminase deficiency is a known cause of immunodeficiency.

== Research ==

=== Viruses ===

The adenosine analog NITD008 has been reported to directly inhibit the recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the dengue virus by terminating its RNA chain synthesis. This interaction suppresses peak viremia and rise in cytokines and prevents lethality in infected animals, raising the possibility of a new treatment for this flavivirus. The 7-deaza-adenosine analog has been shown to inhibit the replication of the hepatitis C virus. BCX4430 is protective against Ebola and Marburg viruses. Such adenosine analogs are potentially clinically useful since they can be taken orally.

=== Anti-inflammatory properties ===
Adenosine is believed to be an anti-inflammatory agent at the A2A receptor. Topical treatment of adenosine to foot wounds in diabetes mellitus has been shown in lab animals to drastically increase tissue repair and reconstruction. Topical administration of adenosine for use in wound-healing deficiencies and diabetes mellitus in humans is currently under clinical investigation.

Methotrexate&#x27;s anti-inflammatory effect may be due to its stimulation of adenosine release.

=== Central nervous system ===
In general, adenosine has an inhibitory effect in the central nervous system (CNS).
Caffeine&#x27;s stimulatory effects are credited primarily (although not entirely) to its capacity to block adenosine receptors, thereby reducing the inhibitory tonus of adenosine in the CNS. This reduction in adenosine activity leads to increased activity of the neurotransmitters dopamine and glutamate. Experimental evidence suggests that adenosine and adenosine agonists can activate Trk receptor phosphorylation through a mechanism that requires the adenosine A2A receptor.

=== Hair ===
Adenosine has been shown to promote thickening of hair on people with thinning hair. A 2013 study compared topical adenosine with minoxidil in male androgenetic alopecia, finding it was as potent as minoxidil (in overall treatment outcomes) but with higher satisfaction rate with patients due to “faster prevention of hair loss and appearance of the newly grown hairs” (further trials were called for to clarify the findings).

=== Sleep ===
Adenosine is a key factor in regulating the body&#x27;s sleep-wake cycle. Adenosine levels rise during periods of wakefulness and lowers during sleep. Higher adenosine levels correlate with a stronger feeling of sleepiness, also known as sleep drive or sleep pressure. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which is considered one of the most effective treatments for insomnia, utilizes short-term sleep deprivation to raise and regulate adenosine levels in the body, for the intended promotion of consistent and sustained sleep in the long term. 

A principal component of cannabis delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) induces sleep in rats by increasing adenosine levels in the basal forebrain. These components also significantly increase slow-wave sleep during the sleep cycle, mediated by CB1 receptor activation. These findings identify a potential therapeutic use of cannabinoids to induce sleep in conditions where sleep may be severely attenuated.

== Vasodilation ==
It also plays a role in regulation of blood flow to various organs through vasodilation.

<text>Deoxyadenosine (symbol dA or dAdo) is a deoxyribonucleoside. It is a derivative of the nucleoside adenosine, differing from the latter by the replacement of a hydroxyl group (-OH) by hydrogen (-H) at the 2′ position of its ribose sugar moiety. Deoxyadenosine is the DNA nucleoside A, which pairs with deoxythymidine (T) in double-stranded DNA. 

In absence of adenosine deaminase (ADA) it accumulates in T lymphocytes and kills these cells resulting in a genetic disorder known as adenosine deaminase severe combined immunodeficiency disease (ADA-SCID).

<doc id="89110" wikidata="Q109463" url="?curid=89110" title="Richard Mentor Johnson">
<text>Richard Mentor Johnson (October 17, 1780 – November 19, 1850) was an American lawyer, military officer and politician who served as the ninth vice president of the United States from 1837 to 1841 under President Martin Van Buren. He is the only vice president elected by the United States Senate under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment. Johnson also represented Kentucky in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. He began and ended his political career in the Kentucky House of Representatives.

After two years in the Kentucky House, Johnson was elected to the U.S. House in 1806. He became allied with fellow Kentuckian Henry Clay as a member of the War Hawks faction that favored war with Britain in 1812. At the outset of the War of 1812, Johnson was commissioned a colonel in the Kentucky Militia and commanded a regiment of mounted volunteers from 1812 to 1813. He and his brother James served under William Henry Harrison in Upper Canada. Johnson led troops in the Battle of the Thames. Many reported that he personally killed the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, a claim that he later used to his political advantage.

After the war, Johnson returned to the House of Representatives. The state legislature appointed him to the Senate in 1819 to fill the seat vacated by John J. Crittenden. With his increasing prominence, Johnson was criticized for his interracial relationship with Julia Chinn, a mixed-race slave who was classified as octoroon (or seven-eighths white). Unlike other upper-class planters and leaders who had African-American mistresses or concubines, but never acknowledged them, Johnson treated Chinn as his common law wife. He acknowledged their two daughters as his children, giving them his surname, much to the consternation of some of his constituents. It is believed that because of this, the state legislature picked another candidate for the Senate in 1828, forcing Johnson to leave in 1829, but his Congressional district voted for him and returned him to the House the same year.

In 1836, Johnson was the Democratic nominee for vice-president on a ticket with Martin Van Buren. Campaigning with the slogan &quot;Rumpsey Dumpsey, Rumpsey Dumpsey, Colonel Johnson killed Tecumseh&quot;, Johnson fell one short of the electoral votes needed to secure his election. Virginia&#x27;s delegation to the Electoral College refused to endorse Johnson, voting instead for William Smith of South Carolina. The Senate elected him to the vice-presidential office. Johnson proved such a burden for the Democrats in the 1836 election that they refused to renominate him for vice president in 1840. Van Buren campaigned for reelection without a running mate. He lost to William Henry Harrison, a Whig. Johnson then served two more years in the Kentucky House of Representatives. He tried to return to higher office but was defeated. He finally was elected to the Kentucky House in 1850, but died on November 19, 1850, just two weeks into his term.

==Early life and education==
Richard Mentor Johnson was born in the settlement of Beargrass on the Kentucky frontier (present-day Louisville) on October 17, 1780, the fifth of Robert and Jemima (Suggett) Johnson&#x27;s 11 children, and the second of eight sons. His brothers John and Henry Johnson survived him. His parents married in 1770. Robert Johnson purchased land in what is now Kentucky, but was then part of Virginia, from Patrick Henry and from James Madison. He had worked as a surveyor and was able to pick out good land. His wife Jemima Suggett &quot;came from a wealthy and politically connected family.&quot;
About the time of Richard&#x27;s birth, the family moved to Bryan&#x27;s Station, near present-day Lexington in the Bluegrass Region. This was a fortified outpost, as there was much Native American resistance to white settlement. The Shawnee and Cherokee hunted in this area. Jemima Johnson was remembered as among the community&#x27;s heroic women because of what was told of her actions during Simon Girty&#x27;s raid on Bryan&#x27;s Station in August 1782. According to later reports, with Indian warriors hidden in the nearby woods and the community short on water, she led the women to a nearby spring, and the attackers allowed them to return to the fort with the water. Having the water helped the settlers beat off an attack made with flaming arrows. At the time, Robert Johnson was serving in the legislature in Richmond, Virginia, as he had been elected to represent Fayette County. (Kentucky was part of Virginia until 1792.)

Beginning in 1783, Kentucky was considered safe enough that settlers began to leave the fortified stations to establish farms. The Johnsons settled on the land Robert had purchased at Great Crossing. As a surveyor, he became successful through well-chosen land purchases and being in the region when he could take advantage of huge land grants.

According to Miles Smith&#x27;s doctoral thesis, &quot;Richard developed a cheery disposition and seems to have been a generally happy and content child&quot;. Richard lived on the family plantation until he was 16. In 1796, he was sent briefly to a local grammar school, and then attended Transylvania University, the first college west of the Appalachian Mountains. While at the Lexington college, where his father was a trustee, he read law as a legal apprentice with George Nicholas and James Brown, later a US Senator.

==Career==
Johnson was admitted to the Kentucky bar in 1802, and opened his law office at Great Crossing. Later, he owned a retail store as a merchant and pursued a number of business ventures with his brothers. Johnson often worked &quot;pro bono&quot; for poor people, prosecuting their cases when they had merit. He also opened his home to disabled veterans, widows, and orphans. Johnson also became a prominent Freemason, and in the late 1830s was part of a Masonic organization, the Hunters Lodge, that unsuccessfully planned an invasion of Canada to overthrow the British government there and establish a provisional American administration.

==Marriage and family==
Family tradition holds that Johnson broke off an early marital engagement when he was about sixteen because of his mother&#x27;s disapproval. Purportedly Johnson vowed revenge for his mother&#x27;s interference. His former fiancée later gave birth to his daughter, named Celia, who was raised by the Johnson family. Celia Johnson later married Wesley Fancher, one of the men who served in Johnson&#x27;s regiment at the Battle of the Thames.

After his father died, Richard Johnson inherited Julia Chinn, an octoroon mixed-race woman (seven-eighths European and one-eighth African in ancestry), who was born into slavery around 1790. She had grown up in the Johnson household, where her mother served. Julia Chinn was the daughter of Benjamin Chinn, who was living in Malden, Upper Canada, or London, Canada, and a sister of Daniel Chinn. An 1845 letter from Newton Craig, Keeper of the Penitentiary in Frankfort, Kentucky, to Daniel Chinn, mentions another brother of Julia Chinn named Marcellus, who accompanied Col. Johnson on his first electioneering tour for vice-presidency. Marcellus left Col. Johnson in New York, whereupon Col. Johnson tried to find Marcellus&#x27; whereabouts from Arthur Tappan, Esq.

Though Chinn was legally Johnson&#x27;s concubine, he began a long-term relationship with her and treated her as his common-law wife, which was legal in Kentucky at the time. They had two daughters together and she later became manager of his plantation. Both Johnson and Chinn championed the &quot;notion of a diverse society&quot; by their multi-racial, predominately white family. They were prohibited from marrying because she was a slave. When Johnson was away from his Kentucky plantation, he authorized Chinn to manage his business affairs. She died in the widespread cholera epidemic that occurred in the summer of 1833. Johnson deeply grieved her loss.

The relationship between Johnson and Chinn shows the contradictions within slavery at the time. There were certainly numerous examples that &quot;kin could also be property&quot;. Johnson was unusual for being open about his relationship and treating Chinn as his common-law wife. He was heard to call her &quot;my bride&quot; on at least one occasion, and they acted like a married couple. According to oral tradition, other slaves at Great Crossings were said to work on their wedding.

Chinn gradually gained more responsibilities. As she spent much of her time in the &quot;plantation&#x27;s big house&quot;, a two-story brick home, she managed Johnson&#x27;s estate for at least half of each year, with her purview later expanding to all of his property, even acting as &quot;Richard&#x27;s representative&quot; and allowing her to handle money. This gave, as historical scholar Christina Snyder argues, some independence, since Johnson told his white employees that Chinn&#x27;s authority must be respected, and her role allowing her children&#x27;s lives to be different from &quot;others of African descent at Great Crossings&quot;, giving them levels of privileged access within the plantation. This was further complicated by the fact that Chinn was still enslaved but supervised the work of slaves, which the Chinn family never sold or mortgaged off, but she did not have the power to &quot;challenge the institution of slavery or overturn the government that supported it&quot;, she only had the power to gain some personal autonomy, with Johnson never legally emancipating her. This may have been because, as Snyder says, liberating her from human bondage would erode &quot;ties that bound her to him&quot; and keeping her enslaved supported his idea of being a &quot;benevolent patriarch&quot;.

Johnson and Chinn had two daughters, Adaline (or Adeline) Chinn Johnson and Imogene Chinn Johnson, whom he acknowledged and gave his surname to, with Johnson and Chinn preparing them &quot;for a future as free women&quot;. Johnson taught them morality and basic literacy, with Julia undoubtedly teaching her own skills, with both later pushing for both of them to &quot;receive regular academic lessons&quot; which he later educated at home to prevent the scorn of neighbors and constituents. Later Johnson would provide for Adaline and Imogene&#x27;s education. Both daughters married white men. Johnson gave them large farms as dowries from his own holdings. There is confusion about whether Adeline Chinn Scott had children; a 2007 account by the Scott County History Museum said she had at least one son, Robert Johnson Scott (with husband Thomas W. Scott) who became a doctor in Missouri. Meyers said that she was childless. There is also disagreement about the year of her death. Bevins writes that Adeline died in the 1833 cholera epidemic. Meyers wrote she died in 1836. The Library of Congress notes that she died in February 1836.

Although Johnson treated these two daughters as his own, according to Meyers, the surviving Imogene was prevented from inheriting his estate at the time of his death. The court noted she was illegitimate, and so without rights in the case. Upon Johnson&#x27;s death, the Fayette County Court found that &quot;he left no widow, children, father, or mother living.&quot; It divided his estate between his living brothers, John and Henry.

Bevins&#x27;s account, written for the Georgetown &amp; Scott County Museum, says that Adeline&#x27;s son Robert Johnson Scott, her first cousin, Richard M. Johnson, Jr., and Imogene&#x27;s family (husband Daniel Pence, first daughter Malvina and son-in-law Robert Lee, and second daughter and son-in-law Josiah Pence) &quot;acquired&quot; Johnson&#x27;s remaining land after his death.

After Chinn&#x27;s death, Johnson began an intimate relationship with another family slave. When she left him for another man, Johnson had her picked up and sold at auction. Afterward he began a similar relationship with her sister, also a slave.

==Political career==
===Early years===
After passing the bar, Johnson returned to Great Crossing, where his father gave him a plantation and slaves to work it. The many lawsuits over ownership of land provided him with much legal work, and, combined with his agricultural interests, he quickly became prosperous.

Johnson ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1803, but finished third, behind the winner, Thomas Sandford, and William Henry. At that time, following the inauguration of Thomas Jefferson in 1801, many young, democratically minded aspiring politicians were seeking office. While Jefferson and Johnson agreed on the need for greater democracy, Jefferson felt that the people should be led by the elite, such as himself, while Johnson took a more populist view.

In 1804, Johnson ran for the Kentucky House of Representatives for Scott County (where Great Crossing is) and this time was elected, the first native Kentuckian to serve in the state&#x27;s legislature. Although the Kentucky Constitution imposed an age requirement of twenty-four for members of the House of Representatives, Johnson was so popular that no one raised questions about his age, and he was allowed to take his seat. Seeking to protect his constituents, most of whom were small farmers, he introduced a proposed U.S. constitutional amendment limiting the power of the federal courts to matters involving the U.S. Constitution. Throughout his political career, Johnson sought to limit the jurisdiction of federal courts, which he deemed undemocratic.

In 1806, Johnson was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the United States House of Representatives, serving as the first native Kentuckian to be elected to Congress. In the three-way election, he defeated Congressman Sandford and James Moore. At the time of his election in August 1806, he did not meet the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s age requirement for service in the House (25), but by the time the congressional term began the following March, he had turned 25. He was re-elected and served six consecutive terms. During the first three terms from 1807 to 1813, he represented Kentucky&#x27;s Fourth District.

Johnson took his seat in the House on October 26, 1807; Congress had been called into special session by President Jefferson to consider how to react to the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;–&quot;Leopard&quot; affair, the forcible boarding of an American naval ship by a British vessel, with four sailors seized as deserters and one hanged. Jefferson had tried to maintain neutrality with the main combatants in the Napoleonic Wars, Britain and France, and at his urging, Congress passed the Embargo Act of 1807, with Johnson voting in support, finding economic warfare preferable to the use of guns: &quot;we fear no nation, but let the time for shedding human blood be protracted, when consistent with our safety&quot;.

Over the following year, Congress attempted to tighten the Embargo, which was widely evaded, especially in the Northeast, with Johnson voting in favor each time. Johnson generally supported Jefferson&#x27;s proposals, and those of his successor James Madison: all three were Democratic-Republicans, and Johnson saw the party&#x27;s proposals as superior to any suggested by the Federalists, whom he saw as not acting in the best interests of the country. In 1809, Johnson supported Jefferson in adopting the administration&#x27;s proposal to replace the Embargo Act with the Non-Intercourse Act, as the Embargo had proven ineffective except in causing a serious recession in the United States.

Although Johnson is considered one of the War Hawks, the young Southern and Western Democratic-Republicans who sought expansion and development of the nation, he was cautious in the runup to the War of 1812. Johnson saw Britain as the major obstacle to United States control of North America, but worried about what a war might bring. By the time Congress met in late 1811, he had come around to war, and joined the War Hawks in electing one of their own, Henry Clay of Kentucky, as Speaker. Like the other War Hawks, though, he was initially unwilling to support increased taxes and borrowing to finance the construction of naval vessels. When Madison asked Congress for a declaration of war against Britain in June 1812, Johnson voted in favor as the House passed the resolution, 79–49. Madison signed the declaration on June 18, 1812.

For his fourth consecutive term from 1813 to 1815, he had secured one of Kentucky&#x27;s at-large seats in the House. For his fifth and sixth consecutive terms, 1815 to 1819, he represented Kentucky&#x27;s Third District. Johnson continued to represent the interests of the poor as a member of the House. He first came to national attention with his opposition to rechartering the First Bank of the United States.

Johnson served as chairman of the Committee on Claims during the Eleventh Congress (1809–1811). The committee was charged with adjudicating financial claims made by veterans of the Revolutionary War. He sought to influence the committee to grant the claim of Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s widow to wages which Hamilton had declined when serving under George Washington. Although Hamilton was a champion of the rival Federalist Party, Johnson had compassion for Hamilton&#x27;s widow; before the end of his term, he secured payment of the wages.

===War of 1812===
====Initial service====
Within a week of the declaration of war, Johnson urged the House of Representatives to recommend the raising of troops in the western states, lest disaster befall settlers on the frontier. After the adjournment, Johnson returned to Kentucky to recruit volunteers. So many men responded that he chose only those with horses, and raised a body of mounted rifles. The War of 1812 was extraordinarily popular in Kentucky; Kentuckians depended on sea trade through the port of New Orleans and feared that the British would stir up another Indian war. The land war fought in the Northern United States pitted American troops against British forces and their Indian allies. Johnson recruited 300 men, divided into three companies, who elected him major. They merged with another battalion, forming a regiment of 500 men, with Johnson as colonel, with the merged volunteer forces becoming a brigade commanded by General Edward W. Tupper of Ohio. The Kentucky militia was under the command of General William Henry Harrison, the Governor of the Indiana Territory.

Johnson&#x27;s force was originally intended to join General William Hull at Detroit, but Hull surrendered Detroit on August 16 and his army was captured. Harrison by then was in command of the entire Northwest frontier and ordered Johnson to relieve Fort Wayne in the northeast of the Territory, which was already being attacked by the Indians. On September 18, 1812, Johnson&#x27;s men reached Fort Wayne in time to save it, and turned back an Indian ambush. They returned to Kentucky and disbanded, going out of their way to burn Potawatomi villages along the Elkhart River en route.

Johnson returned to his seat in Congress in the late fall of 1812. Based on his experience, he proposed a plan to defeat the mobile, guerrilla warfare of the Indians. American troops moved slowly, dependent on a supply line. Indians would evade battle and raid supplies until the American forces withdrew or were overrun. Mounted riflemen could move quickly, carry their own supplies, and live off the woods. If they attacked Indian villages in winter, the Indians would be compelled to stand and fight for the supplies they used to wage war and could be decisively defeated. Johnson submitted this plan to President James Madison and Secretary of War John Armstrong, who approved it in principle. They referred the plan to Harrison, who found winter operations impracticable. Johnson was permitted to try the tactics in the summer of 1813; later, the US conducted Indian wars in winter with his strategy.

Johnson left Washington, D.C., just before Congress adjourned. He raised one thousand men, nominally part of the Kentucky militia under Governor Isaac Shelby, but largely operating independently. He disciplined his men, required that every man have arms in prime condition and ready to hand, and hired gunsmiths, blacksmiths, and doctors at his own expense. He devised a new tactical system: when any group of men encountered the enemy, they were to dismount, take cover, and hold the enemy in place. All groups not in contact were to ride to the sound of firing, and dismount, surrounding the enemy when they got there. Between May and September, Johnson raided throughout the Northwest, burning the war supply centers of Indian villages, surrounding their fighting units and scattering them, killing some warriors each time.

====Battle of the Thames====
In September, Oliver Hazard Perry destroyed most of the British fleet at the Battle of Lake Erie, taking control of the lake. This made the British army, then at Fort Malden (now Amherstburg, Ontario) vulnerable to having its supply lines cut. The British, under General Henry Procter, withdrew to the northeast, pursued by Harrison, who had advanced through Michigan while Johnson kept the Indians engaged. The Indian chief Tecumseh and his allies covered the British retreat, but were countered by Johnson, who had been called back from a raid on Kaskaskia that had taken the post where the British had distributed arms and money to the Indians. Johnson&#x27;s cavalry defeated Tecumseh&#x27;s main force on September 29, took British supply trains on October 3, and was one of the factors inducing Procter to stand and fight at the Battle of the Thames on October 5, as Tecumseh had been demanding he do. One of Johnson&#x27;s slaves, Daniel Chinn, accompanied Johnson to the battle.
At the battle itself, Johnson&#x27;s forces were the first to attack. One battalion of five hundred men, under Johnson&#x27;s elder brother, James Johnson, engaged the British force of eight hundred regulars; simultaneously, Richard Johnson, with the other, now somewhat smaller battalion, attacked the fifteen hundred Indians led by Tecumseh. There was too much tree cover for the British volleys to be effective against James Johnson; three-quarters of the regulars were killed or captured.

The Indians were a harder fight; they were out of the main field of battle, skirmishing on the edge of an adjacent swamp. Richard Johnson ordered a suicide squad of twenty men to charge with him and draw the Indians&#x27; fire, with the rest to attack as the Indians reloaded. But he was unable to push his troops through the enemy position due to the swampy ground. Johnson had to order his men to dismount and hold until Shelby&#x27;s infantry came up. By then, under the pressure of Johnson&#x27;s attack, the Native American force broke and fled into the swamp, during which time Tecumseh was slain.

The question of who shot and killed Tecumseh was highly controversial in Johnson&#x27;s lifetime, as he was most often named as the shooter. Johnson himself did not publicly say that he had killed Tecumseh, stating that he had killed &quot;a tall, good-looking Indian&quot;, but initial published accounts named him, and it was not until 1816 that another claimant, a man named David King, appeared. John Sugden, in his book on the Battle of the Thames, found that Johnson&#x27;s &quot;claim is surely the stronger&quot;. Jones suggested that the issue did not truly catch the public&#x27;s attention until Johnson became a potential candidate for national office in the 1830s, and was promoted through such means as a campaign biography, stage play and song. In any event, he found, &quot;Colonel Johnson truly was a war hero at the Battle of the Thames. By ... leading the suicide mission on horseback, more lives were saved than lost. Johnson was lucky to have been only wounded, since fifteen men died instantly during the charge.&quot;

There are reports from Indians that support Johnson&#x27;s account, but most were made decades after the battle, by which time the question of whether Johnson shot Tecumseh had become politically charged. Tecumseh was said to have been shot from a firearm pointed at a downward angle, as if from a horse, with a ball and three buckshot, which Johnson&#x27;s pistol was said to be loaded with. Evidence that it was so loaded is lacking, and the angle of the wound did not exclude the possibility that he had been stooping when shot. Some accounts have muskets loaded with cartridges containing a ball and three buckshot being commonly carried by American soldiers, and whether the Americans identified the proper body as Tecumseh (whose death was attested to by British officers who had been at the battle) is another source of contention.

On April 4, 1818, an act of Congress requested that the President of the United States present to Johnson a sword in honor of his &quot;daring and distinguished valor&quot; at the Battle of the Thames. The sword was presented to Johnson by President James Monroe in April 1820. Johnson was one of only 14 military officers to be presented a sword by an act of Congress prior to the American Civil War.

====Return to Washington====
With the American success at the Battle of the Thames, the war in the northwest was effectively over. Although there was no organized resistance to his presence in Canada, Harrison withdrew to Detroit because of supply problems. Johnson remained, wounded, at Detroit as his men began their return to Kentucky. Once he had recovered enough to bear the journey, he was conveyed home in a bed in a carriage, arriving there in early November 1813. It took him five months to recover, though he was still left with a damaged left arm and hand, and was later described as walking with a limp. He returned to Congress in February 1814, but due to his wounds was unable to participate in debates until the following session of Congress. He received a hero&#x27;s welcome, still suffering from war wounds that would plague him for the rest of his life.

In August 1814, British forces attacked Washington, D.C., and burned the White House and Capitol, and when Congress reconvened on September 19, with Johnson present, it was in temporary quarters. On September 22, Johnson moved for the appointment of a committee to look into why the British had been allowed to burn the city, and he was appointed as chairman. Johnson&#x27;s committee compiled a voluminous report, but it was objected to by Representative Daniel Webster, who felt the report, including much correspondence, needed to be printed so that all congressmen could study it. This postponed any debate to 1815, by which time the Treaty of Ghent had been ratified, and the United States was again at peace. With Congress having little interest in debating the matter, it was dropped. Had the war continued, Johnson was ready to return to Kentucky to raise another military unit.

===Post-war career in the House===
With the end of the war, Johnson, who was made chairman of the House Committee on Military Affairs, turned his legislative attention to issues such as securing pensions for widows and orphans and funding internal improvements in the West. There were widespread reports of Americans, including women and children, captured by Indians during the war, and Johnson used his congressional office to investigate these matters, and to try to secure the release of captives. Western Democratic-Republicans like Johnson strongly supported the military and urged aid for the veterans; in December 1815, Johnson introduced legislation for the &quot;relief of the infirm, disabled, and superannuated officers and soldiers&quot;. Fearing that the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York produced dandies, not soldiers, Johnson expanded on a proposal by President Madison to establish three additional military academies, urging the placement of one of them in Kentucky. Despite the support of such influential members of the House as Clay and John C. Calhoun, the proposal did not pass, but Johnson worked to have federal facilities built in the West throughout his time in Congress.

Johnson believed that Congressional business was too slow and tedious and that the &quot;per diem&quot; system of compensation encouraged delays on the part of members. To remedy this, he sponsored legislation to pay annual salaries of $1,500 to congressmen rather than a $6 &quot;per diem&quot; for the days the body was in session. At the time, this had the effect of increasing the total compensation from about $900 to $1500. Johnson noted that congressmen had not had a pay increase in 27 years, during which time the cost of living had greatly increased, and that $1,500 was less than the salaries of 28 of the clerks employed by the government. The popular Johnson&#x27;s sponsorship of the measure provided political cover for proponents; Maryland&#x27;s Robert Wright wondered how his colleagues would feel if, &quot;the highly honorable mover of this bill, who slew Tecumseh with his own hands ... he who came up here covered with wounds and glory, with his favorite war-horse and his more favorite servant—his attendant in the army, his nurse and necessary assistant&quot; was &quot;obliged to sell his war-horse or his servant&quot;; salaries would prevent such things from coming to pass. The bill passed the House and Senate quickly and was made law on March 19, 1816. But, the measure proved extremely unpopular with voters, in part because it gave Congress an immediate pay raise, rather than waiting until after the next election. Many members who supported the bill lost their seats as a result, including Johnson&#x27;s colleague Solomon P. Sharp from Kentucky. Johnson&#x27;s overall popularity helped him retain his seat against a challenge, one of only 15 of 81 who voted to pass the bill to keep their seats in the House. The old Congress met for a lame-duck session in December, repealed the new law effective when the new Congress was sworn in, but at Johnson&#x27;s suggestion, did not revive the old &quot;per diem&quot;, thus forcing the new legislators to act on the matter if they wanted to get paid. Compensation for members of Congress remained on a &quot;per diem&quot; basis until an annual salary of $3,000 (~$ in ) was prescribed in 1855. According to Edward J. McManus, who wrote Johnson&#x27;s entry in the &quot;American National Biography&quot;, &quot;Johnson, instead of defending the merits of the reform, avoided the backlash by pledging to work for the repeal of his own measure. He justified his reversal by arguing that representatives should reflect the popular will, but lack of political stamina may have been closer to the truth.&quot;

Johnson disliked the idea of a national bank, and had voted in 1811 not to renew the charter of the First Bank of the United States. Calhoun&#x27;s bill for a Second Bank of the United States passed Congress in early 1816. Johnson was opposed, but was absent for the vote, busy with other matters. A bonus was to be paid to the government by the Second Bank, and a bill was introduced early in 1817 to spend that money on internal improvements. Although Johnson was opposed to the national bank, he supported the bill, believing that the improvements to transportation would benefit his constituents, and the bill passed the House by two votes. Madison, then in his final days in office, vetoed the bill. Johnson joined the effort to override the veto, but it failed. The break from the administration was unusual for Johnson, but he believed the war had shown the need for better roads and canals.

When he took office in 1817, President James Monroe&#x27;s first choice for Secretary of War was Henry Clay, who declined the position. The post ultimately went to Calhoun. The result was that Johnson became chair of the Committee on Expenditures where he wielded considerable influence over defense policy in the Department of War during the Fifteenth Congress. In 1817, Congress investigated General Andrew Jackson&#x27;s execution of two British subjects during the First Seminole War. Johnson chaired the inquiry committee. The majority of the committee favored a negative report and a censure for Jackson. Johnson, a Jackson supporter, drafted a minority report that was more favorable to Jackson and opposed the censure. The ensuing debate pitted Johnson against fellow Kentuckian Clay. Johnson&#x27;s report prevailed, and Jackson was spared censure. This disagreement between Johnson and Clay, however, marked the beginning of a political separation between the two that lasted for the duration of their careers.

In 1818, Calhoun approved an expedition to build a military outpost near the present site of Bismarck, North Dakota on the Yellowstone River; Johnson awarded the contract to his brother James. Although the Yellowstone Expedition was an ultimate failure and expensive to the U.S. Treasury, the Johnsons escaped political ill will in their home district because the venture was seen as a peacekeeping endeavor on the frontier. However, the Panic of 1819 caused Congress to investigate the Yellowstone matter, and in 1820, a report found that James Johnson had overcharged the government by $76,000. Richard and James Johnson, as well as other family members, remained in debt until 1824, when arrangements were made with the largest creditor, the Second Bank of the United States, to settle the liabilities.

===Senator===
====Monroe years (1819–1825)====
Johnson announced his intent to retire from the House of Representatives in early 1818. Sources differ on why he did; David Petriello, in his biography of Johnson, stated that the Kentucky congressman had determined to move on to the Senate; an earlier biographer, Leland Winfield Meyer stated that Johnson&#x27;s departure from the House was because he believed in rotation in office and felt he had served there long enough. Jones stated that Johnson planned to return to private life to deal with family business interests.

Under the original federal Constitution, state legislators, not the voters, elected U.S. senators, and the Kentucky General Assembly was to choose a replacement for outgoing senator Isham Talbot in December 1818. Johnson was considered a strong contender if he entered the race, and in October he let it be known through the press that he would accept the Senate seat if the General Assembly elected him. On December 18, 1818, legislators chose William Logan over Johnson, 67–55. Newspapers noted that the former congressman had never officially declared his candidacy, and that Johnson&#x27;s political friends intended to nominate him for governor in the 1820 election.

Johnson&#x27;s term in the House expired March 3, 1819, but by August, he had been elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives, where he worked to secure passage of a law that abolished imprisonment for debtors in the state, though it did not pass until 1821. But when Senator John J. Crittenden resigned in November 1819, the legislature was called upon to fill the seat. The following month, the General Assembly elected Johnson to the Senate in a 68–53 vote over John Adair, who would be Kentucky&#x27;s next governor.

Johnson was sworn in on January 3, 1820. The Senate was at that time grappling with the admission of the Missouri Territory and the Maine District (then part of Massachusetts) as states. When a bill was introduced which would bar slavery in the territories north and west of Missouri, Johnson was assigned to a select committee of five senators to consider it. The Maine and Missouri questions had been combined into one bill; Johnson voted against an amendment to separate them, which was defeated.

On February 17, the Senate voted to bar slavery outside Missouri in the part of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36°30′ north latitude line, with Johnson voting in favor. The bill passed, and was signed by President Monroe in March. Missouri&#x27;s admission was delayed due to controversial clauses in its draft constitution, such as one forbidding the entry to the state of free African-Americans. Johnson served on the committee of House and Senate members which brokered a resolution, enabling Missouri&#x27;s admission in August 1821.

Johnson was re-elected to a full term in 1822, so that in total, his Senate tenure ran from December 10, 1819, to March 4, 1829. In 1821, he introduced legislation chartering Columbian College (later The George Washington University) in Washington, D.C. During this time period, his views on Western expansion were clear. He believed that the US &quot;empire of liberty&quot; should extend across the continent, arguing in debates leading up to the Missouri Compromise that western expansion and emancipation should go hand in hand, acknowledging issues with white racism but advocating for gradual emancipation. Furthermore, he went against the ideas put forward by sympathizers of the Colonization movement, arguing in &quot;favor of meaningfully incorporating people of color into a multiracial empire&quot;.

In December 1822, Johnson introduced legislation to abolish imprisonment for debt at the federal level. He first spoke to the issue in the Senate on December 14, 1822, pointing to the positive effects its cessation had effected in his home state. The bill failed, but Johnson persisted in re-introducing it every year. In 1824, it passed the Senate but was too late to be acted upon by the House. It passed the Senate a second time in 1828, but again, the House failed to act on it, and the measure died for some years, owing to Johnson&#x27;s exit from the Senate the next year. Passage would have made only a modest impact since few were imprisoned for debt at the federal level, but Johnson hoped to advance the cause of abolishing it in the states. The reform was opposed by the business community, but Jackson&#x27;s support after he became president in 1829 eventually gave the movement fresh life, and a limited bill was passed in 1832. Within ten years after that, imprisonment for debt had been abolished in most states.

Johnson also sought help for debtors not in prison, such as some form of bankruptcy legislation, which would help his own problems and those of his neighbors. Johnson knew this politically pressing issue, which he worked on into the 1830s, quite well because it affected him personally. He was in debt himself from his business losses and support for Western expansion. He also continued to advocate for the positions he had held while a member of the House. As the chair of the Committee on Military Affairs, Johnson pushed for higher veterans pensions, and a liberal policy to enable settlers to buy land in the West more easily.

====Adams opponent (1825–1829)====
The congressional nominating caucus system for choosing presidential and vice presidential candidates was unpopular by 1824, though a caucus did choose William H. Crawford of Georgia. State legislatures chose the other presidential candidates: Clay, Jackson and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams. Johnson supported Clay, his fellow Kentuckian, and Clay gained the state&#x27;s electoral votes. Jackson led in both the popular and electoral vote for president, but did not have a majority, so the election for president was thrown into the House of Representatives, though Calhoun gained a majority of the electoral vote for vice president. Clay had finished fourth in electoral vote, and as the Constitution limits the House&#x27;s choice to the top three finishers, he was eliminated. Johnson supported Jackson, and there were rumors Johnson would be Secretary of War in a Jackson administration. Clay threw his support to Adams, who was elected, and many believed Clay (who became Secretary of State) and Adams had made a Corrupt Bargain. Johnson was the one who informed Jackson of this. Many of Jackson&#x27;s supporters were enraged by the outcome, including Johnson, who promised to oppose the Adams administration: &quot;for by the Eternal, if they act as pure as the angels that stand at the right hand of the throne of God, we&#x27;ll put them down&quot;. Johnson opposed Adams&#x27;s policies, and became a member of the faction, later the Democratic Party, that New York Senator Martin Van Buren was forming to promote Jackson&#x27;s candidacy in 1828.

Already known for securing government contracts for himself, as well as his brothers and friends, he offered land to establish the Choctaw Academy, a school devoted to the European-American education of Indians from the Southeast tribes. Johnson had tried to establish an Indian school at Great Crossings in 1818, partnering with the Kentucky Baptist Society, but the school folded in 1821 after it failed to gain the support of the federal government or private donors. The new academy would come into being a few years later. The academy, sitting on his farm in Scott County in 1825, was overseen by Johnson; and not only was part of treaty negotiations with the Choctaw Nation but appealed to his colleagues as a form &quot;peaceful conquest&quot; or &quot;expansion with honor&quot; as Henry Knox put it. Although he never ran afoul of the conflict of interest standards of his day, some of his colleagues considered his actions ethically questionable. Johnson was paid well for the school by the federal government, which gave him a portion of the annuities for the Choctaw. It was promoted by the Baptist Missionary Society as well. Some European-American students also attended the academy, including his nephew Robert Ward Johnson from Arkansas.

Another pet project Johnson supported was prompted by his friendship with John Cleves Symmes Jr., who proposed that the Earth was hollow. In 1823, Johnson proposed in the Senate that the government fund an expedition to the center of the Earth. The proposal was soundly defeated, receiving only twenty-five votes in the House and Senate combined.

Johnson served as chairman of the Committee on Post Office and Post Roads during the Nineteenth and Twentieth Congresses. Near the end of his term in the Senate, petitioners asked Congress to prevent the handling and delivery of mail on Sunday because it violated biblical principles about not working on the Sabbath. These petitions were referred to Johnson&#x27;s committee. In response, Johnson, a practicing Baptist, drafted a report now commonly referred to as &quot;The Sunday Mail Report&quot;. In the report, presented to Congress on January 19, 1829, Johnson argued that government was &quot;a civil, and not a religious institution&quot;, and as such could not legislate the tenets of any particular denomination. The report was applauded as an elegant defense of the doctrine of separation of church and state. But Johnson was criticized for conflicts of interest in his defense, as he had friends who were contracted to haul mail, and who would have suffered financially from such a ban.

In 1828, Johnson was an unsuccessful candidate for re-election, owing in part to his relationship with the biracial slave Julia Chinn, with whom he lived in a common-law marriage. Although residents of his own district seemed little bothered by the arrangement, slaveholders elsewhere in the state were not so forgiving. The Democratic Party in Kentucky was split, with enough dissidents to be able to join with the opposition to block Johnson&#x27;s re-election. Johnson&#x27;s managers withdrew his name and proposed George M. Bibb, who was elected. In his own defense, Johnson said, &quot;Unlike Jefferson, Clay, Poindexter and others I married my wife under the eyes of God, and apparently He has found no objections.&quot; (The named men were suspected or known to have similar relationships with slave women.) According to Henry Robert Burke, what people objected to was Johnson trying to introduce his daughters to &quot;polite society&quot;. People were used to planters and overseers having relationships with slave women, but they were expected to deny them.

===Return to the House===
After his failed Senatorial re-election bid, Johnson returned to the House, representing Kentucky&#x27;s Fifth District from 1829 to 1833, and Thirteenth District from 1833 to 1837. During the Twenty-first and Twenty-second Congresses, he again served as chairman of the Committee on Post Office and Post Roads. In this capacity, he was again asked to address the question of Sunday mail delivery. He drew up a second report, largely similar in content to the first, arguing against legislation preventing mail delivery on Sunday. The report, commonly called &quot;Col. Johnson&#x27;s second Sunday mail report&quot;, was delivered to Congress in March 1830.

Some contemporaries doubted Johnson&#x27;s authorship of this second report. Many claimed it was instead written by Amos Kendall. Kendall claimed he had seen the report only after it had been drafted and said he had only altered &quot;one or two words&quot;. Kendall speculated that the author could be Reverend O.B. Brown, but historian Leland Meyer concludes that there is no reason to doubt that Johnson authored the report himself.

Johnson chaired the Committee on Military Affairs during the Twenty-second, Twenty-third, and Twenty-fourth Congresses. Beginning in 1830, there arose a groundswell of public support for Johnson&#x27;s &quot;pet project&quot; of ending debt imprisonment. The subject began to appear more frequently in President Jackson&#x27;s addresses to the legislature. Johnson chaired a House committee to report on the subject, and delivered the committee&#x27;s report on January 17, 1832. Later that year, a bill abolishing the practice of debt imprisonment passed both houses of Congress, and was signed into law on July 14.

Johnson&#x27;s stands won him widespread popularity and endorsement by George H. Evans, Robert Dale Owen, and Theophilus Fisk for the presidency in 1832, but Johnson abandoned his campaign when Andrew Jackson announced he would seek a second term. He then began campaigning to become Jackson&#x27;s running mate, but Jackson favored Martin Van Buren instead. At the Democratic National Convention, Johnson finished a distant third in the vice-presidential balloting, receiving only the votes of the Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois delegations; William B. Lewis had to persuade him to withdraw

===Election of 1836===
After the election of 1832, Johnson continued to campaign for the vice presidency which would be available in 1836. He was endorsed by the New York labor leader Ely Moore on March 13, 1833, nine days after Jackson and Van Buren were inaugurated. Moore praised his devotion to freedom of religion and his opposition to imprisonment for debt.

William Emmons, the Boston printer, published a biography of Johnson in New York dated July 1833. Richard Emmons, from Great Crossing, Kentucky, followed this up with a play entitled &quot;Tecumseh, of the Battle of the Thames&quot; and a poem in honor of Johnson. Many of Johnson&#x27;s friends and supporters – Davy Crockett and John Bell among them – encouraged him to run for president. Jackson, however, supported Vice President Van Buren for the office. Johnson accepted this choice, and worked to gain the nomination for vice president.

Emmons&#x27;s poem provided the line that became Johnson&#x27;s campaign slogan: &quot;Rumpsey Dumpsey, Rumpsey Dumpsey, Colonel Johnson killed Tecumseh.&quot; Jackson supported Johnson for vice-president, thinking that the war hero would balance the ticket with Van Buren, who had not served in the War of 1812. Jackson made his decision based on Johnson&#x27;s loyalty but also the president&#x27;s anger at the primary rival candidate, William Cabell Rives.

Despite Jackson&#x27;s support, the party was far from united behind Johnson. Van Buren preferred Rives as a running mate. In a letter to Jackson, Tennessee Supreme Court justice John Catron doubted that &quot;a lucky random shot, even if it did hit Tecumseh, qualifies a man for the vice presidency.&quot; Although Johnson was a &quot;widower&quot; after Chinn&#x27;s death in 1833, there was still dissension related to Johnson&#x27;s open relationship with a slave. The 1835 Democratic National Convention, in Baltimore, in May 1835, was held under the two-thirds rule, largely to demonstrate Van Buren&#x27;s wide popularity. Although Van Buren was nominated unanimously, Johnson barely obtained the necessary two-thirds of the vote. (A motion was made to change the rule, but it obtained only a bare majority, not two-thirds.)

Tennessee&#x27;s delegation did not attend the convention. Edward Rucker, a Tennessean who happened to be in Baltimore, was picked to cast its 15 votes, so that all the states would endorse Van Buren. Senator Silas Wright, of New York, prevailed upon Rucker to vote for Johnson, giving him just more than twice the votes cast for Rives, and the nomination.

Jackson&#x27;s faith in Johnson to balance the ticket proved misplaced. In the general election, Johnson cost the Democrats votes in the South, where his relationship with Chinn was particularly unpopular. He also failed to garner much support from the West, where he was supposed to be strong due to his reputation as an Indian fighter and war hero. He even failed to deliver his home state of Kentucky for the Democrats. Regardless, the Democrats still won the popular vote.

When the electoral vote was counted in Congress on February 8, 1837, Van Buren was found to have received 170 votes for president, but Johnson had received only 147 for vice-president. Although Virginia had elected electors pledged to both Van Buren and Johnson, the state&#x27;s 23 &quot;faithless electors&quot; refused to vote for Johnson, leaving him one electoral vote short of a majority. For the only time, the Senate was charged with electing the vice president The vote on February 8, 1837 divided mostly along party lines, with Johnson becoming vice-president by a vote of 33, as opposed to 16 for Francis Granger; three senators were absent.

==Vice presidency (1837–1841)==

Johnson served as vice president from March 4, 1837, to March 4, 1841. His term was largely unremarkable, and he enjoyed little influence with President Van Buren. His penchant for wielding his power for his own interests did not abate. He lobbied the Senate to promote Samuel Milroy, whom he owed a favor, to the position of Indian agent. When Lewis Tappan requested presentation of an abolitionist petition to the Senate, Johnson, who was still a slaveholder, declined the request.

As presiding officer of the Senate, Johnson was called on to cast a tie-breaking vote fourteen times, more than all of his predecessors save John Adams and John Calhoun. Despite the precedent set by some of his predecessors, Johnson never addressed the Senate on the occasion of a tie-breaking vote; however, on one occasion, he did explain his vote — via an article in the &quot;Kentucky Gazette&quot;.

After the financial Panic of 1837, Johnson took a nine-month leave of absence, during which he returned home to Kentucky and opened a tavern and spa on his farm to offset his continued financial problems. Upon visiting the establishment, Amos Kendall wrote to President Van Buren that he found Johnson &quot;happy in the inglorious pursuit of tavern keeping – even giving his personal superintendence to the chicken and egg purchasing and water-melon selling department&quot;.

In his later political career, he became known for wearing a bright red vest and tie. He adopted this dress during his term as vice-president when he and James Reeside, a mail contractor known for his drab dress, passed a tailor&#x27;s shop that displayed a bright red cloth in the window. Johnson suggested that Reeside should wear a red vest because the mail coaches he owned and operated were red. Reeside agreed to do so if Johnson would also. Both men ordered red vests and neckties, and were known for donning this attire for the rest of their lives.

===Election of 1840===
By 1840, it had become clear that Johnson was a liability to the Democratic ticket. Even former president Jackson conceded that Johnson was &quot;dead wait [sic],&quot; and threw his support to James K. Polk. President Van Buren stood for re-election, and the Whigs once again countered with William Henry Harrison. Van Buren was reluctant to drop Johnson from the ticket, fearing that dropping the Democrats&#x27; own war hero would split the party and cost him votes to Harrison. A unique compromise ensued, with the Democratic National Convention refusing to nominate Johnson, or any other candidate, for vice president. The idea was to allow the states to choose their own candidates, or perhaps return the question to the Senate should Van Buren be elected with no clear winner in the vice-presidential race.

Undaunted by this lack of confidence from his peers, Johnson continued to campaign to retain his office. Although his campaign was more vigorous than that of Van Buren, his behavior on the campaign trail raised concern among voters. He made rambling, incoherent speeches. During one speech in Ohio, he raised his shirt in order to display to the crowd the wounds that he had received during the Battle of the Thames. Charges he leveled against Harrison in Cleveland were so poorly received that they touched off a riot in the city.

In the end, Johnson received only forty-eight electoral votes. One elector from Virginia and all eleven from South Carolina voted for Van Buren for president but selected someone other than Johnson for vice-president. Johnson lost his home state of Kentucky again and his home district.

==Post-vice presidency (1841–1850)==
After his term as vice president, Johnson returned to Kentucky to tend to his farm and oversee his tavern. He again represented Scott County in the Kentucky House from 1841 to 1843. In 1845, he served as a pallbearer when Daniel Boone was re-interred in Frankfort Cemetery.

Johnson never gave up on a return to public service. He ran an unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. Senate against John J. Crittenden in 1842. He briefly and futilely sought his party&#x27;s nomination for president in 1844. He also ran as an independent candidate for Governor of Kentucky in 1848, but after talking with the Democratic candidate, Lazarus W. Powell, who had replaced Linn Boyd on the ticket, Johnson decided to drop out and back Powell. Some speculated that the real object of this campaign was to secure another nomination to the vice-presidency, but this hope was denied.

Johnson finally returned to elected office in 1850, when he was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives. By this time, however, his physical and mental health was already failing. On November 9, the &quot;Louisville Daily Journal&quot; reported that &quot;Col. R. M. Johnson is laboring under an attack of dementia, which renders him totally unfit for business. It is painful to see him on the floor attempting to discharge the duties of a member. He is incapable of properly exercising his physical or mental powers.&quot;
He died of a stroke on November 19, just two weeks into his term, aged 70. He was interred in the Frankfort Cemetery, in Frankfort, Kentucky.

==Legacy==

Counties in four U.S. states are named for Johnson, namely in Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, and Nebraska. Richard Mentor Johnson is also the namesake of Dick Johnson Township, Indiana.

His political prominence led to a family dynasty: his brothers James and John Telemachus Johnson, and his nephew Robert Ward Johnson were all elected to the House of Representatives, the first two from Kentucky, and Robert from Arkansas. Robert was later elected as a senator before the Civil War.

<doc id="89111" wikidata="Q422564" url="?curid=89111" title="Inosine">
<text>Inosine is a nucleoside that is formed when hypoxanthine is attached to a ribose ring (also known as a ribofuranose) via a β-N9-glycosidic bond. It was discovered in 1965 in analysis of RNA transferase.
Inosine is commonly found in tRNAs and is essential for proper translation of the genetic code in wobble base pairs.
Knowledge of inosine metabolism has led to advances in immunotherapy in recent decades. Inosine monophosphate is oxidised by the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, yielding xanthosine monophosphate, a key precursor in purine metabolism. Mycophenolate mofetil is an anti-metabolite, anti-proliferative drug that acts as an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. It is used in the treatment of a variety of autoimmune diseases including granulomatosis with polyangiitis because the uptake of purine by actively dividing B cells can exceed 8 times that of normal body cells, and, therefore, this set of white cells (which cannot operate purine salvage pathways) is selectively targeted by the purine deficiency resulting from inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMD) inhibition.

==Reactions==
Adenine is converted to adenosine or inosine monophosphate (IMP), either of which, in turn, is converted into inosine (I), which pairs with adenine (A), cytosine (C), and uracil (U).

Purine nucleoside phosphorylase intraconverts inosine and hypoxanthine.

Inosine is also an intermediate in a chain of purine nucleotide reactions required for muscle movements.

==Clinical significance==
Subsequent studies in humans suggest that inosine supplementation has no effect on athletic performance. Animal studies have suggested that inosine has neuroprotective properties. It has been proposed for spinal cord injury and for administration after stroke, because observation suggests that inosine induces axonal rewiring.

After ingestion, inosine is metabolized into uric acid, which has been suggested to be a natural antioxidant and peroxynitrite scavenger with potential benefits to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Peroxynitrite has been correlated with axon degeneration In 2003, a study was initiated at the University of Pennsylvania MS Center to determine whether raising the levels of uric acid by the administration of inosine would slow the progression of MS. The study was completed in 2006 but the results were not reported to NIH. A subsequent publication hinted at potential benefits but the sample size (16 patients) was too small for a definitive conclusion. In addition, the side effect of the treatment was the development of kidney stones in four of 16 patients.

With phase II trials for Parkinson&#x27;s disease completed, inosine will continue to phase III trials. Earlier trials suggested that patients with the highest serum urate levels had slower progression of Parkinson&#x27;s symptoms. The trial uses inosine to raise urate levels in those with levels lower than the population mean (6 mg/dL).

Alseres Pharmaceuticals (named Boston Life Sciences when patent was granted) patented the use of inosine to treat stroke and was investigating the drug in the MS setting.

In the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System, it is classified as an antiviral.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlATC/DDD Index&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Binding ==
Inosine is a natural ligand for the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA A receptor.

==Biotechnology==
When designing primers for polymerase chain reaction, inosine is useful in that it can pair with any natural base. This allows for design of primers that span a single-nucleotide polymorphism, without the polymorphism disrupting the primer&#x27;s annealing efficiency.

However, inosine pairs preferentially with cytosine (C) and its introduction to RNA, e.g. by the action of ADARs, thereby destabilizes double-stranded RNA by changing AU base-pairs to IU mismatches.

==Fitness==
Despite lack of clinical evidence that it improves muscle development, inosine remains an ingredient in some fitness supplements.

==Feeding stimulant==
Inosine has also been found to be an important feed stimulant by itself or in combination with certain amino acids in some species of farmed fish. For example, inosine and inosine 5-monophosphate have been reported as specific feeding stimulants for turbot fry, (&quot;Scophthalmus maximus&quot;) and Japanese amberjack, (&quot;Seriola quinqueradiata&quot;). The main problem of using inosine and/or inosine-5-monophosphate as feeding attractants is their high cost. However, their use may be economically justified within larval feeds for marine fish larvae during the early weaning period, since the total quantity of feed consumed is relatively small.

<text>Hypoxanthine is a naturally occurring purine derivative. It is occasionally found as a constituent of nucleic acids, where it is present in the anticodon of tRNA in the form of its nucleoside inosine. It has a tautomer known as 6-hydroxypurine. Hypoxanthine is a necessary additive in certain cells, bacteria, and parasite cultures as a substrate and nitrogen source. For example, it is commonly a required reagent in malaria parasite cultures, since &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; requires a source of hypoxanthine for nucleic acid synthesis and energy metabolism.

In August 2011, a report, based on NASA studies with meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting hypoxanthine and related organic molecules, including the DNA and RNA components adenine and guanine, may have been formed extraterrestrially in outer space.

The &quot;Pheretima aspergillum&quot; worm, used in Chinese medicine preparations, contains hypoxanthine.

==Reactions==
It is one of the products of the action of xanthine oxidase on xanthine. However, more frequently in purine degradation, xanthine is formed from oxidation of hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidoreductase.

Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase converts hypoxanthine into IMP in nucleotide salvage.

Hypoxanthine is also a spontaneous deamination product of adenine. Because of its resemblance to guanine, the spontaneous deamination of adenine can lead to an error in DNA transcription/replication, as it base pairs with cytosine. Hypoxanthine is removed from DNA by base excision repair, initiated by N-methylpurine glycosylase (MPG), also known as alkyl adenine glycosylase (Aag).

<text>Outsider music (from &quot;outsider art&quot;) is music created by self-taught or naïve musicians. The term is usually applied to musicians who have little or no traditional musical experience, who exhibit childlike qualities in their music, or who have intellectual disabilities or mental illnesses. The term was popularized in the 1990s by journalist and WFMU DJ Irwin Chusid.

Outsider musicians often overlap with lo-fi artists, since their work is rarely captured in professional recording studios. Examples include Daniel Johnston, Wesley Willis, and Jandek, who each became the subjects of documentary films in the 2000s.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;outsider music&quot; is traced to the definitions of &quot;outsider art&quot; and &quot;naïve art&quot;. &quot;Outsider art&quot; is rooted in the 1920s French concept of &quot;L&#x27;Art Brut&quot; (&quot;raw art&quot;). In 1972, academic Roger Cardinal introduced &quot;outsider art&quot; as the American counterpart of &quot;L&#x27;Art Brut&quot;, which originally referred to work created exclusively by children or the mentally ill. The word &quot;outsider&quot; began to be applied to music cultures as early as 1959, with respect to jazz, and to rock as early as 1979. In the 1970s, &quot;outsider music&quot; was also a &quot;favorite epithet&quot; in music criticism in Europe. By the 1980s and 1990s, &quot;outsider&quot; was common in the cultural lexicon and was synonymous with &quot;self-taught&quot;, &quot;untrained&quot;, and &quot;primitive&quot;.

==Definition and scope==

Although outsider music has existed since before written history, it was not until the advent of sound reproduction and music exchange networks that such a genre was recognized. Music journalist Irwin Chusid is credited with adapting &quot;outsider art&quot; for music in a 1996 article for the Tower Records publication &quot;Pulse!&quot;. As a DJ on the New Jersey radio station WFMU in the 1980s, he had been an influential figure in independent music scenes. In 2000, he authored a book titled &quot;Songs in the Key of Z: The Curious Universe of Outsider Music&quot;, which attempted to introduce and market outsider music as a genre. He summarized the concept thus:

As was common with journalists who championed musical primitivism in the 1980s, Chusid considered outsiders more &quot;authentic&quot; than artists whose music is &quot;exploited through conventional music channels&quot; and &quot;revised, remodeled, and re-coifed; touched-up and tweaked; Photoshopped and focus-grouped&quot; by the time it reaches the listener, to the point that it is &quot;Music by Committee&quot;. On the other hand, outsider artists have much &quot;greater individual control over the final creative contour&quot;, either because of a low budget or because of their &quot;inability or unwillingness to cooperate with or trust anyone but themselves.&quot;

Outsider music does not generally include avant-garde music, world music, songs recorded solely for their novelty value, or anything self-consciously camp or kitsch; Chusid uses the term &quot;incorrect music&quot; for music that is intentionally recorded to draw bad reactions, from non-musician celebrity entertainers attempting to cross over into music, or from artists who are talented and self-aware enough not to produce such music but do so anyway. Works are usually sourced from home recordings or independent recording studios &quot;with no quality control&quot;. In &quot;Songs in the Key of Z&quot;, Chusid explicitly avoided discussing &quot;unpopular&quot;, &quot;uncommercial&quot;, or &quot;underground&quot; artists, and disqualified &quot;just about anyone who could keep an orchestra or band together.&quot; He did include a few acts in the definition that broke through to mainstream fame as novelty acts; Tiny Tim, for example, is included despite a consistent three-decade career in the music industry that included a major chart hit, Joe Meek was one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s most influential and successful sound engineers of the 1960s, and the Legendary Stardust Cowboy had a brief moment of widespread fame in the 1960s with several national television appearances.

Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys is regarded as the most famous example of an outsider musician. Chusid felt that &quot;it&#x27;s difficult&quot; to argue for Wilson as an outsider due to his popularity, but acknowledged that his struggles with mental illness and the widely circulated bootlegs of his unreleased 1970s and 1980s demos &quot;certify his outsider status&quot;.

==Cultural resonance and influence==
Chusid credited outsider musicians for the existence of dub reggae (&quot;invented by an outsider, Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry&quot;), the K Records and Sub Pop record labels, and the &quot;punk/new-wave/no-wave upheaval that undermined prog-rock and airbrush-pop in the mid- to late-1970s [and] hyped itself with the defiant notion that anyone―regardless of technical proficiency or lack thereof―could make music as long as it represented genuine, naturalistic self-expression.&quot; Specific acts that &quot;significantly contributed―directly and indirectly―to contemporary popular music&quot; include Syd Barrett, Captain Beefheart, the Shaggs, Harry Partch, Robert Graettinger, Tonetta and Daniel Johnston. Conversely, the book &quot;Faking It: The Quest for Authenticity in Popular Music&quot; (2007) argues that &quot;few of the outsiders praised by their fans can be called innovators; most of them are simply naïve.&quot;

Skip Spence&#x27;s &quot;Oar&quot; (1969), Beefheart&#x27;s &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; (produced by Frank Zappa, 1969), and Barrett&#x27;s &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; (1970), according to music historian John Encarnacao, &quot;were particularly important in helping to define a framework through which outsider recordings are understood ... [They] seeded many ideas and practices, affirming them as desirable in the context of rock mythology.&quot; In 1969, Zappa co-founded Bizarre Records, a label dedicated to &quot;musical and sociological material that the important record companies would probably not allow you to hear,&quot; and approached the production of &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; like an anthropological field recording. Beefheart was not on the Bizarre label, but Larry &quot;Wild Man&quot; Fischer was. Fischer was a street performer discovered by Zappa and is sometimes regarded as &quot;the grandfather of outsider music&quot;. In the liner notes of the 1968 album &quot;An Evening with Wild Man Fischer&quot;, Zappa writes: &quot;Please listen to this album several times before you decide whether or not you like it or what Wild Man Fischer is all about. He has something to say to you, even though you might not want to hear it.&quot; According to musicologist Adam Harper, the writing prefigures similar commentary on &quot;the also mentally ill Daniel Johnston.&quot;

After a 1980 reissue on NRBQ&#x27;s Red Rooster Records (distributed by Rounder Records), The Shaggs attracted notoriety for their 1969 album &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot;, which received prominent national coverage. It was referred to as &quot;the worst rock album ever made&quot; by the &quot;New York Times&quot; and later championed in published lists such as &quot;the 100 most influential alternative albums of all time&quot;, &quot;the greatest garage recordings of the 20th century&quot;, and &quot;the fifty most significant indie records&quot;. Lester Bangs famously praised the band as better than the Beatles, and Zappa also held the band in high regard, much higher than the Shaggs themselves, who were embarrassed by the record. In the 1990s, interest in outsider music was spurred by books such as &quot;Incredibly Strange Music&quot; (1994) and compilations devoted to obscure musicians such as B. J. Snowden, Wesley Willis, Lucia Pamela, and Eilert Pilarm.

==Lo-fi music==
Outsider musicians tend to overlap with &quot;lo-fi&quot; artists since their work is rarely captured in professional studios. Harper credits the discourse surrounding Daniel Johnston and Jandek with &quot;form[ing] a bridge between 1980s primitivism and the lo-fi indie rock of the 1990s. ... both musicians introduced the notion that lo-fi was not just acceptable but the special context of some extraordinary and brilliant musicians.&quot; Critics frequently write about Johnston&#x27;s &quot;pure and childlike soul&quot; and describe him as the &quot;Brian Wilson&quot; of lo-fi.

R. Stevie Moore, who pioneered lo-fi/DIY music, was affiliated with Irwin Chusid as well as being associated with the &quot;outsider&quot; tag. He recalled &quot;always ha[ving] the dilemma that [Irwin] did not want to present me as an outsider, like a Wesley Willis or a Daniel Johnston, or these people that are touched in the head and have a certain gift. I love outsider music ... but they have no concept as to how to write or arrange a Brian Wilson song.&quot; (Moore&#x27;s father, Bob Moore, was a consummate musical insider, having worked as a session musician with the Nashville A-Team.)

Tyhran, he started with noisecore, although now he is actively involved in lo-fi, dungeon synth and dark ambient and writes music based on his experiences, feelings and emotions that describe his mental state lately.

<text>George Mifflin Dallas (July 10, 1792 – December 31, 1864) was an American politician and diplomat who served as mayor of Philadelphia from 1828 to 1829, the 11th vice president of the United States from 1845 to 1849, and U.S. Minister to the United Kingdom from 1856 to 1861.

Born in Philadelphia, Dallas was a son of U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander J. Dallas, and studied law in his father&#x27;s office and was admitted to the bar in 1813. He served as the private secretary to Albert Gallatin and worked for the Treasury Department and the Second Bank of the United States. He emerged as a leader of the Family Party faction of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. Dallas developed a rivalry with James Buchanan, the leader of the Amalgamator faction. Between 1828 and 1835, he served as the mayor of Philadelphia, U.S. attorney for the U.S. District Court of Pennsylvania and as Pennsylvania&#x27;s attorney general. He also represented Pennsylvania in the United States Senate from 1831 to 1833 but declined to seek re-election. President Martin Van Buren appointed Dallas to the post of Minister to Russia, and Dallas held that position from 1837 to 1839.

In 1840, Dallas was elected to the American Philosophical Society. Dallas supported Van Buren&#x27;s bid for another term in the 1844 presidential election, but James K. Polk won the party&#x27;s presidential nomination. The 1844 Democratic National Convention nominated Dallas as Polk&#x27;s running mate, and Polk and Dallas defeated the Whig ticket in the general election. A supporter of expansion and popular sovereignty, Dallas called for the annexation of all of Mexico during the Mexican–American War. He sought to position himself for contention in the 1848 presidential election, but his vote to lower the tariff destroyed his base of support in his home state. Dallas served as the Minister to the United Kingdom from 1856 to 1861 before retiring from public office.

==Family and early life==
Dallas was born in Philadelphia on July 10, 1792, to Alexander James Dallas and Arabella Maria Smith Dallas. His father, of Scottish descent, born in Kingston, Jamaica, to Dr. Robert Dallas and educated in Edinburgh, was the Secretary of the Treasury under United States President James Madison, and was also briefly the Secretary of War. Dr Dallas left Jamaica in 1764, having mortgaged his estate, Dallas Castle, and put it in a trust. This property included 900 acres and 91 slaves. George Dallas was given his middle name after Thomas Mifflin, another politician who was good friends with his father. 
His mother, Arabella Smith, was English, born in England.

Dallas was the second of six children, another of whom, Alexander, would become the commander of Pensacola Navy Yard. During Dallas&#x27; childhood, the family lived in a mansion on Fourth Street, with a second home in the countryside, situated on the Schuylkill River. He was educated privately at Quaker-run preparatory schools, before studying at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), from which he graduated with highest honors in 1810. While at College, he participated in several activities, including the American Whig–Cliosophic Society. Afterwards, he studied law in his father&#x27;s office, and he was admitted to the bar in 1813.

==Early legal, diplomatic and financial service==

As a new graduate, Dallas had little enthusiasm for legal practice; he wanted to fight in the War of 1812, a plan that he dropped due to his father&#x27;s objection. Just after this, Dallas accepted an offer to be the private secretary of Albert Gallatin, and he went to Russia with Gallatin who was sent there to try to secure its aid in peace negotiations between Great Britain and the United States. Dallas enjoyed the opportunities offered to him by being in Russia, but after six months there he was ordered to go to London to determine whether the War of 1812 could be resolved diplomatically. In August 1814, he arrived in Washington, D.C., and delivered a preliminary draft of Britain&#x27;s peace terms. There, he was appointed by James Madison to become the remitter of the treasury, which is considered a &quot;convenient arrangement&quot; because Dallas&#x27; father was serving at the time as that department&#x27;s secretary. Since the job did not entail a large workload, Dallas found time to develop his grasp of politics, his major vocational interest. He later became the counsel to the Second Bank of the United States. In 1817, Dallas&#x27; father died, ending Dallas&#x27; plan for a family law practice, and he stopped working for the Second Bank of the United States and became the deputy attorney general of Philadelphia, a position he held until 1820.

==Political career==

After the War of 1812, Pennsylvania&#x27;s political climate was chaotic, with two factions vying for control of the state&#x27;s Democratic Party. Dallas led the Philadelphia-based &quot;Family Party&quot;, which asserted that the Constitution of the United States was supreme, and that an energetic national government should implement protective tariffs and a powerful central banking system, and undertake internal improvements to the country in order to facilitate national commerce. The other faction was called the &quot;Amalgamators&quot;, headed by the future President James Buchanan.

He was elected mayor of Philadelphia as the candidate of the Family Party, after the party had gained control of the city councils. However, he quickly grew bored with that post, and became the United States Attorney for the eastern district of Pennsylvania in 1829, a position his father had held from 1801 to 1814, and continued in that role until 1831. In December of that year, he won a five-man, eleven-ballot contest in the state legislature for Senator from Pennsylvania, to complete the unexpired term of Isaac D. Barnard, who had resigned.

Dallas served less than fifteen months, from 13 December 1831 to 3 March 1833. He was chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs. Dallas did not seek re-election, in part due to a fight over the Second Bank of the United States, and in part because his wife did not want to leave Philadelphia for Washington.

Dallas resumed the practice of law, and was Attorney General of Pennsylvania from 1833 to 1835.

He was initiated into Scottish Rite Freemasonry at Franklin Masonic Lodge #134 in Pennsylvania,
 and served as the Grand Master of Freemasons in Pennsylvania in 1835.

He was appointed by President Martin Van Buren as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Russia in 1837, serving until 1839, when he was recalled at his own request. Dallas was then offered the post of US Attorney General, but declined, and resumed his legal practice. In the lead-up to the 1844 presidential election, Dallas supported Van Buren for the Democratic nomination over fellow Pennsylvanian James Buchanan.

==Vice presidency (1845–1849)==
At the May 1844 Democratic National Convention in Baltimore, James K. Polk and Silas Wright were nominated as the Democratic ticket. However, Wright declined the nomination, and the delegates chose Dallas as his replacement. Dallas, who was not at the convention, was awakened at his home by convention delegates who had traveled to Philadelphia to tell him the news. Dallas somewhat reluctantly accepted the nomination. The Democratic candidates won the popular vote by a margin of 1.5%, and won the election with an electoral vote of 170 out of 275.

During his time as vice president, Dallas was committed to advancing two major objectives: tariff reduction and territorial expansion. He had traditionally supported the protectionist tariff policy that his state&#x27;s coal and iron interests demanded, but he agreed to do anything necessary to realize the goal of tariff reduction. Dallas equated the vice president&#x27;s constitutional power to break tied votes in the Senate with the president&#x27;s constitutional power to veto acts of Congress. At the end of his vice-presidential term, Dallas said he had cast thirty tie-breaking votes during his four years in office. However, he sought to avoid having to exercise his singular constitutional prerogative on the tariff issue, actively lobbying senators during the debate over Treasury Secretary Walker&#x27;s tariff bill in the summer of 1846. Despite his efforts, the Senate completed its voting on the Walker Tariff with a 27-to-27 tie, and Dallas cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of the tariff on July 28, 1846.

Dallas rationalized that he had studied the distribution of Senate support and concluded that backing for the measure came from all regions of the country. Additionally, the measure had overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives, a body closer to public sentiment. While his action earned Dallas the respect of the president and certain party leaders—and possible votes in 1848 from the southern and western states that supported low tariffs—it effectively demolished his home state political base, ending any serious prospects for future elective office.

Dallas was influential as the presiding officer of the Senate, where he worked to support Polk&#x27;s agenda and cast several tie-breaking votes. He called for the annexation of all of the Oregon Territory and all of Mexico during the Mexican–American War, but was satisfied with compromises that saw the United States annex parts of both areas. Though Dallas was unsuccessful in preventing Polk from appointing Buchanan as Secretary of State, he helped convince Polk to appoint Robert J. Walker as Secretary of the Treasury. As vice president, Dallas sought to maneuver himself into contention for the presidency in the 1848 election, as Polk had promised to serve only one term. However, Dallas&#x27; reluctant vote to lower a tariff destroyed much of his base in Pennsylvania, and his advocacy of popular sovereignty on the question of slavery strengthened opposition against him.

===Tariffs===

Dallas determined that he would use his vice-presidential position to advance two of the administration&#x27;s major objectives: tariff reduction and territorial expansion. As a Pennsylvanian, Dallas had traditionally supported the protectionist tariff policy that his state&#x27;s coal and iron interests demanded. But as vice president, elected on a platform dedicated to tariff reduction, he agreed to do anything necessary to realize that goal. Dallas equated the vice president&#x27;s constitutional power to break tied votes in the Senate with the president&#x27;s constitutional power to veto acts of Congress. At the end of his vice-presidential term, Dallas said he had cast thirty tie-breaking votes during his four years in office (although only nineteen of these have been identified in Senate records). Taking obvious personal satisfaction in this record, Dallas singled out this achievement and the fairness with which he believed he accomplished it in his farewell address to the Senate. Not interested in political suicide, however, Dallas sought to avoid having to exercise his singular constitutional prerogative on the tariff issue, actively lobbying senators during the debate over Treasury Secretary Walker&#x27;s tariff bill in the summer of 1846. He complained to his wife (whom he sometimes addressed as &quot;Mrs. Vice&quot;) that the Senate speeches on the subject were &quot;as vapid as inexhaustible ... All sorts of ridiculous efforts are making, by letters, newspaper-paragraphs, and personal visits, to affect the Vice&#x27;s casting vote, by persuasion or threat.&quot;

Despite Dallas&#x27; efforts to avoid taking a stand, the Senate completed its voting on the Walker Tariff with a 27-to-27 tie. (A twenty-eighth vote in favor was held in reserve by a senator who opposed the measure but agreed to follow the instructions of his state legislature to support it.) When he cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of the tariff on July 28, 1846, Dallas rationalized that he had studied the distribution of Senate support and concluded that backing for the measure came from all regions of the country. Additionally, the measure had overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives, a body closer to public sentiment. He apprehensively explained to the citizens of Pennsylvania that &quot;an officer, elected by the suffrages of all twenty-eight states, and bound by his oath and every constitutional obligation, faithfully and fairly to represent, in the execution of his high trust, all the citizens of the Union&quot; could not &quot;narrow his great sphere and act with reference only to [Pennsylvania&#x27;s] interests.&quot; While his action, based on a mixture of party loyalty and political opportunism, earned Dallas the respect of the president and certain party leaders—and possible votes in 1848 from the southern and western states that supported low tariffs—it effectively demolished his home state political base, ending any serious prospects for future elective office. (He even advised his wife in a message hand-delivered by the Senate Sergeant at Arms, &quot;If there be the slightest indication of a disposition to riot in the city of Philadelphia, owing to the passage of the Tariff Bill, pack up and bring the whole brood to Washington.&quot;)

While Dallas&#x27; tariff vote destroyed him in Pennsylvania, his aggressive views on Oregon and the Mexican War crippled his campaign efforts elsewhere in the nation. In his last hope of building the necessary national support to gain the White House, the Vice President shifted his attention to the aggressive, expansionist foreign policy program embodied in the concept of &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;. He actively supported efforts to gain control of Texas, the Southwest, Cuba, and disputed portions of the Oregon territory.

Dallas was influential as the presiding officer of the Senate, where he worked to support Polk&#x27;s agenda and cast several tie-breaking votes. Dallas called for the annexation of all of the Oregon Territory and all of Mexico during the Mexican–American War, but was satisfied with compromises that saw the United States annex parts of both areas. Though Dallas was unsuccessful in preventing Polk from appointing Buchanan as Secretary of State, he helped convince Polk to appoint Robert J. Walker as Secretary of the Treasury. As vice president, Dallas sought to maneuver himself into contention for the presidency in the 1848 election, as Polk had promised to serve only one term. However, Dallas&#x27; reluctant vote to lower a tariff destroyed much of his base in Pennsylvania, and Dallas&#x27; advocacy of popular sovereignty on the question of slavery strengthened opposition against him.

==Post-vice presidency (1849–1864)==
In 1856, Franklin Pierce appointed Dallas minister to Great Britain. He served in that post from February 4, 1856, until the appointment by President Lincoln of Charles F. Adams, who relieved him on May 16, 1861. At the very beginning of his diplomatic service in Britain, he was called to act upon the Central American question and the US request that Sir John Crampton, the British minister to the United States, should be recalled. Dallas managed these delicate questions in a conciliatory spirit, but without any sacrifice of national dignity, and both were settled amicably. In 1859, following the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision, Dallas refused Frederick Douglass a passport, on the grounds that Douglass was not a citizen; decades later, in his autobiography, Douglass remarked &quot;This man is now dead and generally forgotten... but I have lived to see myself everywhere recognized as an American citizen.&quot; At the close of his diplomatic career, Dallas returned to private life. He took no further part in public affairs except to express condemnation of secession.

===Death===
Dallas returned to Philadelphia, where he lived until his death from a heart attack on December 31, 1864, at the age of 72. He is interred at St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal churchyard in Philadelphia.

==Legacy==
Dallas County, Iowa, and one of its cities, Dallas Center, Iowa, were named for Dallas.

Dallas is also the namesake of Dallas County, Arkansas, Dallas County, Missouri, and Dallas County, Texas,

Other U.S. cities and towns named in Dallas&#x27; honor include Dallas, Texas,
Dallas, Georgia (the county seat of Paulding County, Georgia), Dallas, North Carolina (the former county seat of Gaston County, North Carolina), Dallas, Oregon (the county seat of Polk County, Oregon) and Dallastown, Pennsylvania,

<doc id="89119" wikidata="Q7327892" url="?curid=89119" title="Richard Morel">
<text>Richard Morel is an American singer-songwriter, DJ, remixer and record producer from the suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. He has worked extensively with Washington D.C.–based duo Deep Dish, co-writing, co-producing, performing and singing on many of their tracks, most notably on their albums &quot;Junk Science&quot; and &quot;George Is On&quot;. Richard Morel&#x27;s songs are represented by Downtown Music Publishing.

==Dance music==
As a dance music producer and remixer, he has released an extensive number of club hits using the names Morel and Pink Noise. Notable artists he has provided remixes for include Mariah Carey, t.A.T.u., Pet Shop Boys, Tina Turner, New Order, Depeche Mode, Filter, Yoko Ono, Seal, The Killers, Blaqk Audio and Amanda Lear.

==Record label==
In 1995 Morel started his own independent record label called Outsider Music. He released &quot;Peterbilt Angel&quot; and the &quot;4-Track&quot; CDs on Outsider. Morel has collaborated with Ute Lemper and Daniel Ash for Outsider Music releases. In 2007 Michael Alago (A+R maverick who signed Metallica and White Zombie) began working with Morel at Outsider Music.

In 2002 he released &quot;Queen Of the Highway&quot; on Deep Dish&#x27;s Yoshitoshi label. The album, which contained not only house music tracks but also had modern rock, pop and hip-hop elements throughout, impressed many critics. &quot;Queen Of the Highway&quot; is an audio portrait of punk photographer Mark Morrisroe whom Morel befriended. The autobiographical and introspective lyrics helped to earn the album its critical praise. Included on the record are some of his past club hits: &quot;True (The Faggot Is You),&quot; &quot;Funny Car (Love Is Dead)&quot; and &quot;Cabaret.&quot; Technically, the album is released by a band also called Morel, fronted by Richard.

==Dance events==
Also in 2002, he began running a monthly dance event in Washington, DC with friend and veteran punk/alternative/indie icon Bob Mould, titled Blowoff. The Blowoff dance event was so popular that it spurred Blowoff events in other cities such as New York City, Chicago, and San Diego. Blowoff is also the name of an electronic duo that Morel and Mould have been recording an album under.

After several more club hits and remixes, Morel returned with a second album, &quot;Lucky Strike&quot;, in 2004. Again praised by critics, the follow-up was an extension of sounds and lyrical content of his first. Included here are his club hits &quot;If You Love Me,&quot; &quot;Under a Disco&quot; and &quot;Escape (Driving To Heaven),&quot; a collaboration with producer 16B.

==Touring unit==
In 2005, Morel became part of Bob Mould&#x27;s new touring unit (along with another notable DC musician, Fugazi drummer Brendan Canty), formed to support the release of Mould&#x27;s &quot;Body of Song&quot; album. Morel also contributed remixes of the track &quot;(Shine Your) Light Love Hope&quot; to the bonus disc included in the limited edition version of the album.

==Collaborations==
Morel co-produced and co-wrote several songs with Cyndi Lauper for her 2008 album &quot;Bring Ya to the Brink&quot; including the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play No. 1 single &quot;Same Ol&#x27; Story&quot;.

In 2010, Richard Morel produced Amanda Lear&#x27;s new EP I&#x27;m Coming Up. Morel is openly gay.

<text>Ultima Online (UO) is a fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) released on September 24, 1997 by Origin Systems.

Set in the &quot;Ultima&quot; universe, it is known for its extensive player versus player combat system. Since its release, it has added eight expansion packs, a booster pack, and dozens of free content updates. The release of &quot;Kingdom Reborn&quot; in 2007 brought a new game engine with upgraded visuals.

In preparation for the launch of the &quot;Stygian Abyss&quot; expansion, support for the existing client was discontinued to optimize the patching procedure. As a replacement, a revised rendition of the &quot;Kingdom Reborn&quot; client emerged, rebranded as the &quot;Enhanced Client.&quot; This revamped version was unveiled as an open beta in July 2009, coinciding with the release of &quot;Stygian Abyss&quot;. The &quot;Enhanced Client&quot; is a blend of some of the 3D models and UI from &quot;Kingdom Reborn&quot; and the 2D art used in the Classic Client. The Enhanced Client and the Classic Client are the two official clients as of 2024.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Ultima Online&quot; continued the tradition of previous &quot;Ultima&quot; games in many ways, but due to advancing technology and the simple fact that it was Origin&#x27;s first persistent online game, many new game mechanics appeared. Since it was partially designed as a social and economic experiment, the game designers had to account for widespread player interaction as well as deal with the tradition of players feeling as if they were the center of attention, as had been the case in single-player games.

===Worlds===
&quot;Ultima Online&quot; began with a single world, with specific expansion packs adding additional territory and new worlds. The second world was the &quot;Lost Lands&quot;, often referred to by players as T2A due to the expansion&#x27;s name, &quot;The Second Age&quot;, with additional land, dungeons, creatures, and terrain. The third was Trammel, which was a mirror of the original &quot;Ultima Online&quot; map. The release of Trammel led the developers to distinguish the original world by making the environment more grim and naming it &quot;Felucca&quot;. The two kinds of servers were &quot;normal&quot; servers with both Trammel (consensual PVP) and Felucca (non-consensual PVP) ruleset and &quot;siege&quot; servers with non-consensual PVP and no item insurance. Siege servers support one character slot on an account, limits to ways of traveling and have other rules which generally make them more challenging than other servers.

The worlds in &quot;Ultima Online&quot; include:
* Felucca — The original world, which evolved to include dead trees and tombstones to distinguish. It has a harsher rule set where player killing is more common.
* Trammel — Supported a rule set that does not allow non-consensual PVP and includes additional open land for player housing.
* Ilshenar — Added dungeons and monsters and evolved to include new land, as well as more than 30 new creatures (designed by Todd McFarlane).
* Malas — Included a Player versus Player arena and space for 1500 new player homes. It featured Dungeon Doom, the largest dungeon at the time of its release, and two cities: Luna (the &quot;City of Paladins&quot;) and Umbra (the &quot;City of Necromancers&quot;). Malas is a series of islands floating in a starry void and is distinguished by a darker artistic style. Malas was praised for its variety of creatures and geographic features.
* Tokuno — Group of islands based on Feudal Japan.
* Ter Mur — Land of the Gargoyles. The capital, Ter Mur, features space for player homes.
* Valley of Eodon — A primitive, prehistoric style land-mass with dinosaurs and giant apes.

==Development==

The game had an initial development budget of $2.5 million. &quot;Ultima Online&quot; is the product of Richard Garriott&#x27;s idea for a fantasy game involving several thousand people who can all play in a shared fantasy world. Prior games allowed hundreds of people to play at the same time, including &quot;Habitat&quot; (beta-tested in 1986), &quot;The Realm Online&quot;, &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; (the AOL version) and &quot;Meridian 59&quot;; however, &quot;Ultima Online&quot; significantly outdid these games, in both graphics and game mechanics. Garriott commented that &quot;it was very important to us that &quot;Ultima Online&quot; be a game with a theme, and story, and quest - and then support larger, grander activity. We don&#x27;t want it to be just player controlled and dominated; we want it to be an &quot;Ultima&quot; experience, with all the qualities that people expect from that. &quot;Ultima Online&quot; will be, I believe, the very first ever completely virtual world for the mass public to go live out alternate lives in.&quot; The goal was to offer the player as much freedom as possible. 

The initial team was composed of Garriott, Starr Long, Rick Delashmit, Scott Phillips and, a bit later, Raph Koster, who became the lead designer. Koster wrote public &quot;designer letters&quot; and usually went by his nickname of Designer Dragon. Koster drew inspiration from prior online games, such as &quot;DartMUD&quot;.

The project started in 1995 and was presented to the public at E3 as &quot;Ultima Online: Shattered Legacy&quot; in May 1996. Origin claimed to have more than 3,000 participants in the preliminary alpha testing. The development cost was much greater than for previous, offline computer games; it relied on people accessing servers via modem. &quot;Ultima Online&quot;&#x27;s initial features included persistent player housing, skill-based character progression (without levels or classes), a craft-based and player-driven economy, and unrestricted player-versus-player combat.

An artificial life engine was supposed to be implemented into the game. A preview announced that ecological events in the game would affect animal behavior, potentially creating new adventure possibilities in an organic manner. However, this feature never made it beyond the game&#x27;s beta stage. Richard Garriott explained: 

===Beta and assassination of Lord British===
Lord British was Garriott&#x27;s in-game alter ego, who was killed during an in-game appearance at &quot;Ultima Online&quot;″s beta test on August 9, 1997. During a server population stress test, a player character known as Rainz cast the &quot;fire field&quot; spell, killing Lord British. Producer Starr Long blamed it on human error: Lord British&#x27;s character, like others, had been made invulnerable to this kind of attack, but by design, the invulnerability did not persist over several game sessions. When the server crashed shortly before the incident, Garriott forgot to reset his invulnerability status. Shortly after, administrators banned Rainz&#x27;s account from the beta test for repeatedly exploiting, rather than reporting, bugs. According to Origin, he was not banned for the assassination but rather for prior complaints against his account highlighted by this incident. Beta testers protested Rainz&#x27;s ban as well as subsequent actions of Long and other developers, during which his in-game character used a spell to indiscriminately kill other characters who observed the assassination. September 23, 1997 was the last day of the original beta test. The beta ended with a bang, as players were treated to an &quot;end of the world&quot; scenario with Shadowlords, demons, and other evil creatures slaughtering every character in sight.

===Origin era (1995–2004)===
In September 1997, &quot;Ultima Online&quot; launched and opened the first game servers to the public. Upon release, &quot;Ultima Online&quot; proved popular, reaching 100,000 paying subscribers within six months, causing severe lag problems. In 1999, servers opened around the world to support the rising popularity of the game, in Japan, Europe and South Korea. In 2000, Garriot resigned from Origin, taking Lord British with him. Game players created their own fanfiction speculations as to why the Lord had vanished. In February 2000, a large in-world event had a massive army of undead lay siege to the Britannia city of Trinsic. The event ran concurrently on all servers over several months. Another server opened in Australia during this time. In May 2000, &quot;Ultima Online&quot;″s second expansion &quot;Ultima Online: Renaissance&quot; dramatically altered the game. It split the game world into two mirrored worlds called Trammel and Felucca. In Trammel all PVP was required to be consensual, while in Felucca players could be attacked by others players without consent. In November 2000, &quot;Ultima Online&#x27;s&quot; first official fanfest was held, called the UO World Faire in Austin, TX. In March 2001, &quot;Ultima Online&quot;″s third expansion &quot;Ultima Online: Third Dawn&quot; was released and introduced graphics which attempted to reproduce a three-dimensional effect. It added a new area to the server called Ilshenar which could only be accessed with a new game client that launched with the expansion. The original game client could be used in the previous server areas. In January 2002, &quot;Ultima Online&quot;″s second official fanfest was called Online Worlds FanFest, also held in Austin. Players were able to meet the developers, as well as guest speaker Todd McFarlane. February saw the release of &quot;Ultima Online&quot;″s fourth expansion &quot;Ultima Online: Lord Blackthorn&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. Notably, it enabled access to the areas previously only available to the newer &quot;Third Dawn&quot; game client. In February 2003, &quot;Ultima Online&quot;″s fifth expansion &quot;Ultima Online: Age of Shadows&quot; was released. It was the most game changing update yet including: offering players the ability to custom design their game homes, a server area that doubled the amount of player housing available, and overhauled the item system. 

&quot;Ultima Online&quot; was the first MMORPG to reach the 100,000 subscriber base, far exceeding that of any game that went before it. Subscriber numbers peaked at around 250,000 in July 2003, but then began a steady decline. In February 2004, Origin Systems shut down. &quot;Ultima Online&quot; no longer had a named studio managing it. Development headquarters moved from Austin to Fairfax, Virginia.

===Electronic Arts era (2004–2006)===
The sixth expansion, &quot;Samurai Empire&quot;, launched in November 2004, was Japanese-themed. It offered two new professions, the Ninja and the Samurai, as well as new Japanese-themed housing tile sets. New lands, the Tokuno Islands, were added, with the cities being styled after ancient Japanese cities.

Expansion number seven, &quot;Mondain&#x27;s Legacy&quot;, launched in August 2005. It featured the second player race, Elves. The quest system received a major upgrade, as did the crafting system. Spellweaving was added to the skills. Many new dungeons were added. This expansion was the first that was only available online (offline versions on CDs could be ordered). &quot;Mondain&#x27;s Legacy&quot; was the last expansion for several years, with updates becoming more irregular after that point.

===Mythic Entertainment era (2006–2014)===
In June 2006 Electronic Arts purchased Mythic Entertainment, the creators of &quot;Dark Age of Camelot.&quot; Mythic was tasked with managing EA&#x27;s MMORPG portfolio, including &quot;Ultima Online&quot;. That month it was also announced that the anti-cheating software PunkBuster would be integrated into &quot;Ultima Online&quot;. This marked the first time PunkBuster would be used with an MMORPG to help curb cheating and exploiting. However, it was never integrated into the game, and in November 2006, Electronic Arts put the PunkBuster integration on indefinite hold.

In 2008 the game had around 100,000 subscribers. As of April 2008, &quot;Ultima Online&quot; held a market share below 0.6% of the massively multiplayer online game subscriptions. This may in part be attributed to the 2004 release of World of Warcraft, which quickly established hegemony over the MMORPG market and has attracted scores of players from all preexisting games in the genre.

In August 2007 &quot;Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn&quot; was released. This was the first major overhaul of the client and artwork systems since &quot;Ultima Online: Third Dawn&quot;. The final expansion was &quot;Stygian Abyss&quot; (2009), which focused on the gargoyle race. After &quot;Stygian Abyss&quot; the development model shifted from expansions to &quot;booster packs&quot; that were intended to be smaller updates released more frequently. However, the first booster pack &quot;High Seas&quot; of 2010 was also the last.

===Broadsword era (2014–present)===
It was announced on February 6, 2014, that development of the game would be transferred from Mythic to Broadsword, a new studio, that would take over future development.

====Free-to-play model====
In 2018 the traditional free fourteen-day trial was replaced with &quot;Endless Journey&quot; which allowed free playing indefinitely, but with large restrictions as to what players can do and where they can go.

====Ultima Online: New Legacy====
In 2020, Broadsword announced a new shard that would focus on returning &quot;Ultima Online&quot; to its fundamental roots as a roleplaying game. The shard is to have seasonal rulesets, whereby the shard will be reset via an in-game cataclysmic event and restarted with new rulesets in place. Broadsword stated that at the end of each season, characters will be able to transfer off of the &quot;Ultima Online: New Legacy&quot; shard onto a live shard with all skills, stats, and legacy progress that was earned.

The alpha testing phase for &quot;Ultima Online: New Legacy&quot; is currently underway, with plans for the beta phase to commence during the summer of 2024. Broadsword Online Games, the development team behind the game, has announced their intention to launch &quot;New Legacy&quot; in September 2024, coinciding with the 26th anniversary of the original &quot;Ultima Online&quot; release. 

==Reception==
===Reviews===
&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;it&#x27;s a very big world in there, full of lots of exciting things to try and accomplish, with more to be added over time and lots of real people around to know you did them. Brittania is what you make of it. Have fun.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; rated the game 4.9 of 10.

===Sales and subscriptions===
Internal sales predictions for &quot;Ultima Online&quot; were low, as Electronic Arts president John Riccitiello remarked that &quot;Ultima&quot; &quot;was never a big franchise.&quot; According to an Origin Systems employee, the game&#x27;s expected maximum subscriber count was 15,000 users. However, Stefan Janicki of GameSpot later noted that it &quot;quickly became one of the most commercially successful games ever&quot;. &quot;CNNMoney&quot; similarly declared it a &quot;watershed event&quot; and the first major hit in the Internet-only game genre. In the United States, &quot;Ultima Online&quot; debuted at #9 on PC Data&#x27;s computer game sales rankings for October 1997. It carried a list price of $65, and its average street price was $55 for the month. A writer for CNET Gamecenter found that the title was part of a trend of role-playing successes in October, alongside &quot;Fallout&quot; and &quot;Lands of Lore 2: Guardians of Destiny&quot;. He remarked, &quot;If October&#x27;s list is any indication, RPGs are back.&quot; Between &quot;Ultima Online&quot;″s launch on September 25 and November 13, the game sold 65,000 units. In Japan, its initial shipment of 5,000 units sold out within 15 minutes on shelves.

&quot;Ultima Online&quot;″s sales rate was the fastest ever for an Internet-only game by 1997, and it led Electronic Arts to declare the title its fastest-selling computer game of all time. A writer for &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; considered this speed the possible cause for &quot;the many reports of lost orders, delayed pre-orders and stores out of stock that occurred when the game launched.&quot; In mid-November, Electronic Arts revealed plans to ship an additional 80,000 units of &quot;Ultima Online&quot; worldwide, including 15,000 for Japan. The majority of its first shipment had been targeted at the United States. On November 20, the game became Japan&#x27;s best-selling computer title of its launch month. &quot;Ultima Online&quot; reached 70,000 global subscribers by early December, of which Japan made up 8,000 and Europe 5,000. The game had fallen from PC Data&#x27;s monthly top 20 for the United States during November, but the firm tracked 87,000 sales of &quot;Ultima Online&quot; in that country alone through the end of 1997.

By December 1998, &quot;Ultima Online&quot; had reached 100,000 subscribers, with an average simultaneous player count of 12,500 and an average weekly playtime of 20 hours. Declaring the game a hit, IGN&#x27;s staff wrote that its users &quot;pay $9.95 a month to play the game. That&#x27;s a million dollars in revenue a month. Twelve million dollars a year.&quot; The game had risen to 120,000 subscribers by March 1999, and by June &quot;Ultima Online&quot;″s global sales had surpassed 200,000 units. A writer for GameDaily described this performance as &quot;almost like printing money.&quot; Its subscriber base continued to climb in 2000, reaching 150,000 users by February. Domestically, &quot;Ultima Online&quot; and its &quot;Second Age&quot; add-on together had sold 249,610 copies and earned revenues of $11.3 million at retail alone by early 2000, according to PC Data. Gamecenter&#x27;s Mark Asher wrote at the time, &quot;Add in its current subscriber base of 150,000 players at $10 per month, and you can see the appeal of online, fee-based games.&quot; Subscribers rose to 165,000 by March, which amounted to $1.65 million in monthly revenue, and to 250,000 by October 2000.

By early 2001, &quot;Ultima Online&quot;″s playerbase was estimated at 20–30% female, which was common to MMORPGs of the period. Japan remained a key market for &quot;Ultima Online&quot; by July 2001, and accounted for 64,000 of the game&#x27;s 240,000 subscribers at the time. A representative for Electronic Arts reported, &quot;While we do only a fraction of PC game business in Japan against EA&#x27;s worldwide business, over 25 percent of &quot;Ultima Online&quot; business is done in Japan.&quot; Worldwide, &quot;Ultima Online&quot; retained 225,000 subscribers by early 2003.

===Awards===
&quot;Ultima Online&quot; was awarded &quot;Online Game of the Year&quot;, as well as received a nomination for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Software Engineering&quot;, at the inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards (now known as the D.I.C.E. Awards), presented by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences.
&quot;Ultima Online&quot;″s success resulted in Guinness World Records awarding the game eight world records in the &quot;Guinness World Records: Gamer&#x27;s Edition 2008&quot;. These records include &quot;First MMORPG to Reach 100,000 Players&quot;, &quot;Longest Running MMORPG&quot;, and &quot;First and Only Person to Kill Lord British&quot;, which was done by a player named Rainz during a server reset which turned off his invulnerability; however, the &quot;Longest Running MMORPG&quot; award was revoked due to an oversight and was instead given to the game &quot;Furcadia&quot;, which was released nine months prior to &quot;Ultima Online&quot;. In May 2001 &quot;Ultima Online&quot; won the MPOGD game of the month award In 2010, &quot;Ultima Online&quot; was the first inductee into the Game Developers Choice Online Awards Hall of Fame. In 2012, Stratics presented &quot;Ultima Online&quot; with a &quot;Historic Achievement Award&quot; to commemorate &quot;fifteen years of innovation, imagination, and dedication in support of the Ultima Online community.&quot; Time designated it as one of the 100 greatest video games of all time in November 2012.

===Controversies===
&quot;Ultima Online&quot; had a number of serious bugs when it first shipped, with the vast majority of them being fixed with patches over the next few months. This ignited debates over whether the recently emerged technology for continuous patching would lead to companies routinely releasing games in an unfinished and/or bug-ridden state with the intention of fixing the problems after release.

Since the designers of &quot;Ultima Online&quot; wanted to provide freedom and sense of agency, it was important to allow players to act in a villainous role. The consequences of in-game criminality were adjusted over time, but maintaining the general commitment to player freedom. As explained by designer Raph Koster, &quot;Being safe from evil is, in my mind, an uneven tradeoff for the fact that you don&#x27;t get to be heroes anymore, in that you can just opt out of fighting evil. It may be nobody wants to be heroes except when it doesn&#x27;t count, when it isn&#x27;t challenging, that people would rather fight &#x27;pretend evil&#x27; than the real thing, but I don&#x27;t personally believe that. I still think people are better than that.&quot;

&quot;Ultima Online&quot; was sued by former player volunteers (&quot;Counselors&quot;) and settled in 2004 without admitting wrongdoing. AOL had their volunteers train customer service personnel it hired, then shut down the volunteer program. Concern over future lawsuits led Microsoft to shut down their volunteer program for &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call&quot;.

==Expansions and follow-up releases==
Throughout &quot;Ultima Online&quot;″s history, there have been many major additions to the game. Expansion packs have been released regularly, all of which add new content in the form of landmass, art, quests, items, or game mechanics.
===Clients===
Electronic Arts provides the standard clients with which players are allowed to connect to the &quot;Ultima Online&quot; servers, though some third-party clients were made.

The 3D client was originally released as a part of the &quot;Ultima Online: Third Dawn&quot; expansion, but received poor reviews due to performance issues (especially memory leaks early on) and sub-par graphics. An update to the 3D client was made on January 30, 2006 when characters and creatures from the game were scaled down to smaller sizes. As of early May/Late April 2007, the &quot;Third Dawn&quot; client was no longer supported by Electronic Arts, and focus shifted to the &quot;Kingdom Reborn&quot; client and its successor the Enhanced Client. Electronic Arts &quot;Ultima Online&quot; servers do not allow the &quot;Third Dawn&quot; client to connect.

&quot;Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn&quot; was announced in August 2006 and was released August 27, 2007. A series of clues provided by developers via an in-game event arc allowed players to find a URL on the &quot;Ultima Online&quot; website wherein a simple message was contained as well as a Flash movie featuring screenshots of the upgraded graphics. In addition to the upgraded graphics, there was a newer, more streamlined interface. Some of the changes included hot keys, a scrolling bag configuration and a new character sheet. The new client modernized the game&#x27;s look, making it easy to add new content without backsliding through outdated and outmoded art, while maintaining the niche market as an MMORPG that can run on lower-end computers. Electronic Arts referred to the &quot;Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn&quot; client as &quot;2.5d,&quot; meaning that it was written in 3d and then moved into 2d to make it easier for lower-end computers to run. The client is available as a free download.

Electronic Arts originally stated that the &quot;Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn&quot; client would replace the long-standing &quot;Ultima Online&quot; client. As of September 2009, the &quot;Kingdom Reborn&quot; client has been superseded by a modified version of the &quot;KR&quot; client, now called the &quot;Enhanced Client&quot;. The &quot;Kingdom Reborn&quot; client no longer works on official shards. The new &quot;Enhanced Client&quot; keeps the rendering engine (including particle effects and light source rendering) from Kingdom Reborn, but not the KR graphics. Support for this client ended to streamline the patch process prior to the release of the Ultima Online: Stygian Abyss expansion.

A modified version of the &quot;Kingdom Reborn&quot; client, renamed as the &quot;Enhanced Client&quot;, was introduced as part of the &quot;Stygian Abyss&quot; expansion. It was released as an open beta in July 2009. Changes included enhanced macro abilities, a more configurable interface, changes to the mapping system, and graphical improvements. The enhanced graphics of the &quot;Kingdom Reborn&quot; client had been retired in favor of lower resolution original graphics that more closely resembled the original 2D client. This graphic set was based on the &quot;Third Dawn&quot; client and was previously available in the &quot;Kingdom Reborn&quot; client as optional original graphics.

===Other releases===
&quot;Ultima Online&quot; has had several special releases that were not expansions or booster packs, but came with boxed or in-game extras.
* &quot;Ultima Online: Charter Edition&quot; (September 30, 1997) was available to pre-order from Origin Systems at the launch of &quot;Ultima Online&quot; and in small quantities alongside the standard retail box. It included a signed lithograph of the &quot;Ultima Online&quot; artwork by the Hilderbrandt brothers and a pewter pin badge bearing the &quot;Ultima Online&quot; logo. The box was not signed by Richard Garriott, but simply bears a digital print of his Lord British signature. The Charter Edition included the cloth map that was also a feature of the standard box, and included three months of subscription time, as opposed to the single month included with the standard box.
* &quot;Ultima Online: Discovery Edition&quot; (February 1, 2000) was released to the Australian and New Zealand markets at the same time as the launch of the Oceania server for the region.
* &quot;Ultima Online: 7th Anniversary&quot; (September 25, 2004) was a special release of the game to celebrate &quot;Ultima Online&#x27;s&quot; seventh birthday. It included a more recently patched CD. This release was contained in a small cardboard box containing a triple-CD jewel case, featuring &quot;Ultima Online: Age of Shadows&quot;, but also included &quot;Ultima IX: Ascension&quot; install and play discs as a bonus. A glossy booklet showing the history of &quot;Ultima Online&quot; expansions was included that contained historic art and an interview from the &quot;Ultima Online&quot; team and community leaders. It included a code for an in-game gift, one of which was &quot;Ultima Online&#x27;s&quot; famous Hilderbrant print, an extra character slot (a total of six characters was now available) and 7 buddy registration codes.
* &quot;Ultima Online: Gold&quot; (July 18, 2005) was sold by Wal-Mart and includes the same content as &quot;Ultima Online: Samurai Empire&quot;. This edition came with an Advanced Character token code and quick-start manual.
* &quot;Ultima Online: The Eighth Age&quot; (September 25, 2005) was a boxed game CD with an array of in-game tokens. The release was to celebrate &quot;Ultima Online&#x27;s&quot; eighth birthday. The box included a patched game CD, a glossy booklet featuring an atlas of Sosaria, in-game tokens for an anniversary gift (choice of 8), a character transfer, an advanced character, a 45-day free trial code and a time-limited blue soul stone.
* &quot;Ultima Online: 9th Anniversary Collection&quot; (October 31, 2006). Formerly known as &quot;Eve of a New Age.&quot; This came with an in-game upgrade code that redeemed 9 &quot;Heritage Tokens&quot;, &quot;Crystal&quot; and &quot;Shadow&quot; items which matched new housing tile sets in the game, and attendants, which took the form of NPCs. These could be set to announce a player&#x27;s presence in a house or to follow the player around on the map. The Heritage tokens could be redeemed for several kinds of items including special armor, weapons, and house decoration items in various themes (3 fruit trees, a set of rugs, tables, a broken furniture set, a &quot;dark&quot; or evil furniture set and more).

==Legacy==
===Sequels===
Two sequels were planned by Electronic Arts, but both were canceled during development so that more focus could be spent on the original.
* &quot;Ultima Online 2&quot;, later renamed &quot;Ultima Worlds Online: Origin&quot; was announced in 1999. It was to add steampunk elements to the fantasy setting, set in a world where the past, present and future of Sosaria were merged by a mistake made by Lord British while attempting to merge the shards of the Gem of Immortality. Todd McFarlane was hired to design original monsters and regions for the game, as well as help shape the story. It was cancelled in 2001 before its release, citing the competitive nature of the massively multiplayer online gaming market—Electronic Arts feared the sequel would harm &quot;Ultima Online&#x27;s&quot; subscription numbers. Some of the monsters and art made for the game were later used in the &quot;Ultima Online&quot; expansion &quot;Lord Blackthorn&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.
* &quot;Ultima X: Odyssey&quot; was a new MMORPG to be set in a world named Alucinor, created by the Avatar after the events of &quot;Ultima IX: Ascension&quot;. It was cancelled in 2004 when Electronic Arts closed Origin. The &quot;Odyssey&quot; team was invited to move to the Bay area to finish the game. However, only a small number of people accepted the transfer. In the end, &quot;Odyssey&quot; was cancelled because the development team dissolved.

===Community===

During the game&#x27;s May 1996 alpha testing, there already formed over a dozen player-created guilds.

Shadowclan is a guild that gained notoriety within the online gaming community in 1997 by taking the place of non-player character orcs in &quot;Ultima Online&quot;. Former clan administrator Ogur was interviewed about Shadowclan in &quot;Massively Multiplayer Games For Dummies&quot;. A reference to Shadowclan was written into the official &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot; documentation.

Fans of &quot;Ultima Online&quot; reverse-engineered the game to produce server emulators of the original Electronic Arts servers.

In early 1999, a few users began auctioning their accounts, one garnering a winning bid of $2025 ().

<text>DCide is a privately held, Washington, D.C. based independent record label and distributor. The label was started in summer of 1995 by founding partners Jeffrey B. Clyburn, Burton Gray and Mark Thorp. Their first act Nothingface sold over 500,000 records worldwide and is widely recognized as one of the standard-bearers for the new metal genre. In 2002, DCide entered into a partnership with Geffen Records to release the debut record from TRUSTcompany out of Montgomery, Alabama. TRUSTcompany&#x27;s guitar driven rock evokes memories of the Smashing Pumpkins with Deftones-like vocal stylings and bottom heavy riffing reminiscent of Led Zeppelin. TRUSTcompany enjoyed both critical and commercial success as their debut album &quot;The Lonely Position of Neutral&quot; went on to be certified Gold.

TRUSTcompany’s sophomore record &quot;True Parallels&quot; was released by DCide/Geffen in March 2005. In 2009, DCide/Templar Label Group released the debut EP&#x27;s from Shabazz Palaces, the new project from Ishmael Butler, the creator, rapper and producer for the Grammy award winning rap group Digable Planets. DCide began its relationship with Butler with its 2003 release of his first post Digable Planets project, Cherrywine. In 2011, DCide will release &quot;Well-Done&quot; a collaboration album by Action Bronson and Statik Selektah.

<doc id="89126" wikidata="Q4268" url="?curid=89126" title="East Coast of the United States">
<text>The East Coast of the United States, also known as the Eastern Seaboard, the Atlantic Coast, and the Atlantic Seaboard, is the region encompassing the coastline where the Eastern United States meets the Atlantic Ocean. The Thirteen Colonies, which formed the United States in 1776 were located on this coast, and it has played an important role in the development of the United States.

The region is generally understood to include the U.S. states that border the Atlantic Ocean: Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia, as well as the federal capital of Washington, D.C., and non-coastline states: Pennsylvania, Vermont, and West Virginia.

==Toponymy and composition==
The place name East Coast derives from the idea that the contiguous 48 states are defined by two major coastlines, one at the western edge and one on the eastern edge. Other terms for referring to this area include the Eastern , which is another term for coastline, Atlantic Coast, and Atlantic Seaboard because the coastline lies along the Atlantic Ocean.

The 14 states that have a shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are (from north to south): Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. border the Delaware River and the Potomac River, respectively, both of which are tidal arms of the Atlantic Ocean.

==Colonial history==

The original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain in North America all lay along the East Coast.

Two additional U.S. states on the East Coast were not among the original Thirteen Colonies: Maine became part of the English Colony of Massachusetts in 1677 and Florida was held by the British from the end of the French and Indian War until 1781 and was part of New Spain until 1821. 

In present-day Florida, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León made the first textual records of the state during his 1513 voyage. The state was initially named for Ponce de León, who called the peninsula La Pascua Florida in recognition of the verdant landscape and because it was the Easter season.

Delaware Colony and the provinces of New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania had been colonized by the Dutch as New Netherland until they were ceded to the British in the mid- to late-17th century.Until 1791, Vermont was an independent nation as the Vermont Republic.

==Geography and climate==

Three basic climate regions occur on the East Coast according to the Köppen climate classification and four occur according to the Trewartha climate classification from north to south based on the monthly mean temperature of the coldest month (January) and the number of months averaging above 50 °F (10 °C), respectively.

The region from northern Maine and Upstate New York south to almost all of Connecticut, most of northern New Jersey (except for areas close enough to New York City), most of Pennsylvania, and western Maryland has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa/Dfb/Dc&quot;), with warm-to-hot summers, cold and snowy winters with at least one month averaging below freezing, and four to seven months with mean temperatures warmer than 50 °F.

The area from Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and extreme SW Rhode Island to southern Delaware and western North Carolina has a warm temperate climate (&quot;Cfa&quot; Köppen/&quot;Do&quot; Trewartha) with long and hot summers with at least one month over 22°C (71.6°F), cool winters with all months over freezing, and six to seven months above 50°F. Although winter precipitation is more likely to fall as rain than as snow, occasional heavy snow is possible.

The area from the southern Delmarva Peninsula, southeast Virginia, and central North Carolina south to central Florida is humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa/Cf&quot;), with hot and rainy summers, mild and drier winters, and eight to twelve months above 50°F. Urban heat island exclaves of this zone are found north of this area in Baltimore and Washington, D.C.

The region of Florida from the south-central region of the state south to the Florida Keys has a tropical climate (&quot;Af/Aw/Ar&quot;) that is usually frost-free and warm to hot all year, and all of the 12 months of the year average above 18 °C (64.4 °F). This region of Florida is the only tropical climate in the continental U.S.

The least common climate on the East Coast is the oceanic (&quot;Cfb/Do&quot;), which is only found on Block Island, Nantucket, and the Outer Cape and Chatham on Cape Cod, and in areas of the southern Appalachian Mountains. This zone has all monthly averages between 0 and 22 °C and six to seven months above 50 °F. Although winter precipitation is more likely to fall as rain than as snow, occasional heavy snow is possible.

Although landfalls are rare, the Eastern Seaboard is susceptible to hurricanes in the Atlantic hurricane season, officially running from June 1 to November 30, although hurricanes can occur before or after these dates. Hurricanes Hazel, Hugo, Bob, Isabel, Irene, and Sandy, and most recently Florence, Isaias, Henri, and Ida are some of the more significant storms to have affected the region.

The East Coast, with the exception of eastern Maine, is a low-relief, passive margin coast. It has been shaped by the Pleistocene glaciation in the far northern areas in New England, with offshore islands such as Nantucket, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Block Island, and Fishers Island. From northern New Jersey southward, the coastal plain broadens southwards, separated from the Piedmont region by the Atlantic Seaboard fall line of the East Coast rivers, often marking the head of navigation and prominent sites of cities. 

The coastal areas from Long Island south to Florida are often made up of barrier islands that front the coastal areas, with the long stretches of sandy beaches. Many of the larger capes along the lower East Coast are in fact barrier islands, like the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Florida Keys are made up of limestone coral and provide the only coral reefs on the U.S. mainland.

==Demographics==
In 2010, the population of the states that have shoreline on the East Coast was estimated at 112,642,503 (about 36% of the country&#x27;s total population). New York City is both the largest city and the largest metropolitan area on the East Coast. The East Coast is the most populated coastal area in the United States.

==Transportation==

The primary Interstate Highway along the East Coast is Interstate 95, completed in 2018, which replaced the historic U.S. Route 1 (Atlantic Highway), the original federal highway that traversed all East Coast states, except Delaware. 

By water, the East Coast is connected from the Annisquam River in Gloucester, Massachusetts to Miami, Florida, by the Intracoastal Waterway, also known as the East Coast Canal, which was completed in 1912. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Downeaster&quot; and &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; offer the main passenger rail service on the Seaboard. The &quot;Acela Express&quot; offers the only high-speed rail passenger service in the Americas, by the lenient US definition of high speed rail. Between New York and Boston the &quot;Acela Express&quot; has up to a 54% share of the combined train and air passenger market.

Some of the largest airports in the United States are located along the East Coast of the United States, such as John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York City, Logan International Airport in Boston, Newark Liberty Airport in Newark, New Jersey, Philadelphia International Airport in Philadelphia, Baltimore–Washington International Airport near Baltimore, Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C., Hartsfield–Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Miami International Airport in Miami, Charlotte Douglas International Airport in Charlotte, North Carolina, Tampa International Airport in Tampa, and Orlando International Airport in Orlando, Florida.

==Culture==
As the first spot in the United States that immigrants arrived and the close proximity of Europe, the Caribbean, and Latin America, the East Coast is home to a diverse population and home to multi-cultures when compared to the rest of the U.S. From the strong Latin culture in southern Florida, to the 200-year-old Gullah culture of the low country coastal islands of Georgia and South Carolina, to the many historic cities in the Mid-Atlantic, where a strong English, German, Italian, Irish, and French culture are present, the East Coast is significantly more diverse than the rest of the United States. Numerous Chinatowns in New York City, and Little Havana in Miami, are examples of such cultural centers in the bigger cities.

The East Coast is home to much of the political and financial power and a center for resort and travel destinations in the United States. New York City is the most populous city in the country and a major world financial center. Seventy-one of the world&#x27;s Fortune 500 companies have their corporate headquarters in New York City, while Midtown Manhattan, with 400 million square feet of office space in 2018, is the largest central business district in the world. Washington, D.C. is the federal capital and political nerve center of the United States. Many organizations such as defense contractors, civilian contractors, nonprofit organizations, lobbying firms, trade unions, industry trade groups and professional associations have their headquarters in or near Washington, D.C., in order to be close to the federal government.

Miami is one of the top domestic and international travel destinations in the United States. Miami is the warmest major city in the continental United States in winter, which contributes to it being a major tourism hub for international visitors. Miami has one of the largest concentrations of international banks in the United States, and the third-largest skyline in the U.S. with over 439 high-rises, 68 of which exceed 490 ft (149 m). Port of Miami is the busiest cruise port in the world in both passenger traffic and cruise lines, with over 5.5 million cruise passengers passing through the port each year. The center for tropical plant culture and research in the United States is based in Miami at Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden. The state of Florida is the second-largest producer of oranges in the world behind Brazil.

<text>An off-Broadway theatre is any professional theatre venue in New York City with a seating capacity between 100 and 499, inclusive. These theatres are smaller than Broadway theatres, but larger than off-off-Broadway theatres, which seat fewer than 100.

An &quot;off-Broadway production&quot; is a production of a play, musical, or revue that appears in such a venue and adheres to related trade union and other contracts. Some shows that premiere off-Broadway are subsequently produced on Broadway.

== History ==
The term originally referred to any venue, and its productions, on a street intersecting Broadway in Midtown Manhattan&#x27;s Theater District, the hub of the American theatre industry. It later became defined by the League of Off-Broadway Theatres and Producers as a professional venue in Manhattan with a seating capacity of at least 100, but not more than 499, or a production that appears in such a venue and adheres to related trade union and other contracts.

Previously, regardless of the size of the venue, a theatre was considered a Broadway (rather than off-Broadway) house if it was within the &quot;Broadway Box&quot;, extending from 40th Street north to 54th Street and from Sixth Avenue west to Eighth Avenue, including Times Square and West 42nd Street. This change to the contractual definition of &quot;off-Broadway&quot; benefited theatres satisfying the 499-seat criterion because of the lower minimum required salary for Actors&#x27; Equity performers at Off-Broadway theatres as compared with the salary requirements of the union for Broadway theatres. The adoption of the 499-seat criterion occurred after a one-day strike in January 1974. Examples of off-Broadway theatres within the Broadway Box are the Laura Pels Theatre and The Theater Center.

The off-Broadway movement started in the 1950s as a reaction to the perceived commercialism of Broadway and provided less expensive venues for shows that have employed many future Broadway artists. An early success was Circle in the Square Theatre&#x27;s 1952 production of &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; by Tennessee Williams. According to theatre historians Ken Bloom and Frank Vlastnik, off-Broadway offered a new outlet for &quot;poets, playwrights, actors, songwriters, and designers. ... The first great Off-Broadway musical was the 1954 revival&quot; of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, which proved that off-Broadway productions could be financially successful. Critic John Gassner argued at the time, however, that &quot;Broadway is just as eclectic – and just as footless – as &#x27;Off-Broadway&#x27;.&quot; Theatre Row, on West 42nd Street between 9th and 10th Avenues in Manhattan, is a concentration of off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway theatres. It was developed in the mid-1970s and modernized in 2002.

Many off-Broadway shows have had subsequent runs on Broadway, including such musicals as &quot;Hair&quot;, &quot;Godspell&quot;, &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot;, &quot;Rent&quot;, &quot;Grey Gardens&quot;, &quot;Urinetown&quot;, &quot;Avenue Q&quot;, &quot;The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee&quot;, &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;, &quot;In the Heights&quot;, &quot;Spring Awakening&quot;, &quot;Next to Normal&quot;, &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot;, &quot;Fun Home&quot;, &quot;Hamilton&quot;, &quot;Dear Evan Hansen&quot;, &quot;Hadestown&quot;, and &quot;Kimberly Akimbo&quot;. In particular, two that became Broadway hits, &quot;Grease&quot; and &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;, encouraged other producers to premiere their shows off-Broadway. Plays that have moved from off-Broadway houses to Broadway include &quot;Doubt&quot;, &quot;I Am My Own Wife&quot;, &quot;Bridge &amp; Tunnel&quot;, &quot;The Normal Heart&quot;, and &quot;Coastal Disturbances&quot;. Other productions, such as &quot;Stomp&quot;, &quot;Blue Man Group&quot;, &quot;Altar Boyz&quot;, &quot;Perfect Crime&quot;, &quot;Forbidden Broadway&quot;, &quot;Nunsense&quot;, &quot;Naked Boys Singing&quot;, &quot;Bat Boy: The Musical&quot;, and &quot;I Love You, You&#x27;re Perfect, Now Change&quot; have had runs of many years off-Broadway, never moving to Broadway. &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;, the longest-running musical in theatre history, spent its original 42-year run off-Broadway from 1960 to 2002 and had another off-Broadway run from 2006 to 2017.

==Awards==
Off-Broadway shows, performers, and creative staff are eligible for the following awards: the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award, the Outer Critics Circle Award, the Drama Desk Award, the Obie Award (presented since 1956 by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;), the Lucille Lortel Award (created in 1985 by the League of Off-Broadway Theatres &amp; Producers), and the Drama League Award. Although off-Broadway shows are not eligible for Tony Awards, an exception was made in 1956 (before the rules were changed), when Lotte Lenya won Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical for the off-Broadway production of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;.

<doc id="89129" wikidata="Q51393" url="?curid=89129" title="LGBTQ community">
<text>The LGBTQ community (also known as the LGBT, LGBTQ+, LGBTQIA+, or queer community) is a loosely defined grouping of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning individuals united by a common culture and social movements. These communities generally celebrate pride, diversity, individuality, and sexuality. LGBTQ activists and sociologists see LGBTQ community-building as a counterweight to heterosexism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, sexualism, and conformist pressures that exist in the larger society. The term &quot;pride&quot; or sometimes &quot;gay pride&quot; expresses the LGBTQ community&#x27;s identity and collective strength; pride parades provide both a prime example of the use and a demonstration of the general meaning of the term. The LGBTQ community is diverse in political affiliation. Not all people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender consider themselves part of the LGBTQ community.

Groups that may be considered part of the LGBTQ community include gay villages, LGBTQ rights organizations, LGBTQ employee groups at companies, LGBTQ student groups in schools and universities, and LGBT-affirming religious groups.

LGBTQ communities may organize themselves into, or support, movements for civil rights promoting LGBTQ rights in various places around the world. At the same time, high-profile celebrities in the broader society may offer strong support to these organizations in certain locations; for example, LGBTQ advocate and entertainer Madonna stated, &quot;I was asked to perform at many Pride events around the world — but I would never, ever turn down New York City&quot;.

==Terminology==

&quot;LGBT&quot;, or &quot;GLBT&quot;, is an initialism that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. In use since the 1990s, the term is an adaptation of the initialism &quot;LGB&quot;, which was used to replace the term &quot;gay&quot; – when referring to the community as a whole – beginning in various forms largely in the early 1990s.

While the movement had always included all LGBT people, the one-word unifying term in the 1950s through the early 1980s was &quot;gay&quot; (see Gay liberation). Throughout the 1970s and &#x27;80s, a number of groups with lesbian members, and pro-feminist politics, preferred the more representative, &quot;lesbian and gay&quot;. By the early nineties, as more groups shifted to names based on &quot;lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender&quot; (LGBT), &quot;queer&quot; was also increasingly reclaimed as a one-word alternative to the ever-lengthening string of initials, especially when used by radical political groups, some of which had been using &quot;queer&quot; since the &#x27;80s.

The initialism, as well as common variants such as &quot;LGBTQ&quot;, have been adopted into the mainstream in the 1990s as an umbrella term for use when labeling topics about sexuality and gender identity. For example, the LGBT Movement Advancement Project termed community centers, which have services specific to those members of the LGBT community, as &quot;LGBT community centers&quot; in comprehensive studies of such centers around the United States.

The initialism &quot;LGBT&quot; is intended to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity-based cultures. It may refer to anyone who is non-heterosexual or non-cisgender, instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. Recognize this inclusion as a popular variant that adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer or are questioning their sexual identity; &quot;LGBTQ&quot; has been recorded since 1996.

Disagreement between what precise wording is best is still present in 2023. Some propose adding more letters to make the participation of those groups explicit. Detractors of this approach argue that adding letters implicitly excludes others or makes for worse branding.

==Symbols==
The gay community is frequently associated with certain symbols, especially the rainbow or rainbow flags. The Greek lambda symbol (&quot;L&quot; for liberation), triangles, ribbons, and gender symbols are also used as &quot;gay acceptance&quot; symbol. There are many types of flags to represent subdivisions in the gay community, but the most commonly recognized one is the rainbow flag. According to Gilbert Baker, creator of the commonly known rainbow flag, each color represents a value in the community:
* pink = sexuality
* red = life
* orange = healing
* yellow = the sun
* green = nature
* blue = art
* indigo = harmony
* violet = spirit

Later, pink and indigo were removed from the flag, resulting in the present-day flag which was first presented at the 1979 Pride Parade. Other flags include the Victory over AIDS flag, the Leather Pride flag, and the Bear Pride flag.

The lambda symbol was originally adopted by Gay Activists Alliance of New York in 1970 after they broke away from the larger Gay Liberation Front. Lambda was chosen because people might confuse it for a college symbol and not recognize it as a gay community symbol unless one was actually involved in the community. &quot;Back in December of 1974, the lambda was officially declared the international symbol for gay and lesbian rights by the International Gay Rights Congress in Edinburgh, Scotland.&quot;

The triangle became a symbol for the gay community after the Holocaust. Not only did it represent Jews, but homosexuals who were killed because of German law. During the Holocaust, homosexuals were labeled with pink triangles to distinguish between them, Jews, regular prisoners, and political prisoners. The black triangle is similarly a symbol for females only to represent lesbian sisterhood.

The pink and yellow triangle was used to label Jewish homosexuals. Gender symbols have a much longer list of variations of homosexual or bisexual relationships which are clearly recognizable but may not be as popularly seen as the other symbols. Other symbols that relate to the gay community or gay pride include the gay-teen suicide awareness ribbon, AIDS awareness ribbon, labrys, and purple rhinoceros.

In the fall of 1995, the Human Rights Campaign adopted a logo (yellow equal sign on deep blue square) that has become one of the most recognizable symbols of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. The logo can be spotted the world over and has become synonymous with the fight for equal rights for LGBTQ people.

One of the most notable recent changes was made in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on June 8, 2017. They added two new stripes to the rainbow flag, one black and one brown. These were intended to highlight members of color within the LGBTQ community.

==Human and legal rights==
The LGBTQ community represented by a social component of the global community that is believed by many, including heterosexual allies, to be underrepresented in the area of civil rights. The current struggle of the gay community has been largely brought about by globalization. In the United States, World War II brought together many closeted rural men from around the nation and exposed them to more progressive attitudes in parts of Europe. Upon returning home after the war, many of these men decided to band together in cities rather than return to their small towns. Fledgling communities would soon become political in the beginning of the gay rights movement, including monumental incidents at places like Stonewall. Today, many large cities have gay and lesbian community centers. Many universities and colleges across the world have support centers for LGBTQ students. The Human Rights Campaign, Lambda Legal, the Empowering Spirits Foundation, and GLAAD advocate for LGBTQ people on a wide range of issues in the United States. There is also an International Lesbian and Gay Association. In 1947, when the United Kingdom adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), LGBTQ activists clung to its concept of equal, inalienable rights for all people, regardless of their race, gender, or sexual orientation. The declaration does not specifically mention gay rights, but discusses equality and freedom from discrimination. In 1962, Clark Polak joined The Janus Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Only a year after, he became president. In 1968, he announced that the Society would be changing their name to Homosexual Law Reform Society; &quot;Homosexuals are now willing to fly under their own colors&quot; (Stewart, 1968).

===Same-sex marriage===

In some parts of the world, partnership rights or marriage have been extended to same-sex couples. Advocates of same-sex marriage cite a range of benefits that are denied to people who cannot marry, including immigration, health care, inheritance and property rights, and other family obligations and protections, as reasons why marriage should be extended to same-sex couples. Opponents of same-sex marriage within the gay community argue that fighting to achieve these benefits by means of extending marriage rights to same-sex couples privatizes benefits (e.g., health care) that should be made available to people regardless of their relationship status. They further argue that the same-sex marriage movement within the gay community discriminates against families that are composed of three or more intimate partners. Opposition to the same-sex marriage movement from within the gay community should not be confused with opposition from outside that community.

==Media==
The contemporary lesbian and gay community has a growing and complex place in the American and Western European media. Lesbians and gay men are often portrayed inaccurately in television, films, and other media; the gay community is often portrayed as many stereotypes, such as gay men being portrayed as flamboyant and bold. Like other minority groups, these caricatures are intended to ridicule this marginalized group.

There is currently a widespread ban of references in child-related entertainment, and when references do occur, they almost invariably generate controversy. In 1997, when American comedian Ellen DeGeneres came out of the closet on her popular sitcom, many sponsors, such as the Wendy&#x27;s fast food chain, pulled their advertising. Also, a portion of the media has attempted to make the gay community included and publicly accepted with television shows such as &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; or &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot;. This increased publicity reflects the Coming out movement of the LGBTQ community. As more celebrities came out, more shows developed, such as the 2004 show &quot;The L Word&quot;. These depictions of the LGBTQ community have been controversial, but beneficial for the community. The increase in visibility of LGBTQ people allowed for the LGBTQ community to unite to organize and demand change, and it has also inspired many LGBTQ people to come out.

In the United States, gay people are frequently used as a symbol of social decadence by celebrity evangelists and by organizations such as Focus on the Family. Many LGBTQ organizations exist to represent and defend the gay community. For example, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation in the United States and Stonewall in the UK work with the media to help portray fair and accurate images of the gay community.

As companies are advertising more and more to the gay community, LGBTQ activists are using ad slogans to promote gay community views. Subaru marketed its Forester and Outback with the slogan &quot;It&#x27;s Not a Choice. It&#x27;s the Way We&#x27;re Built&quot;, which was later used in eight U.S. cities on streets or in gay rights events.

=== Social media ===
Social media is often used as a platform for the LGBTQ community to congregate and share resources. Search engines and social networking sites provide numerous opportunities for LGBTQ people to connect with one another; additionally, they play a key role in identity creation and self-presentation. Social networking sites allow for community building as well as anonymity, allowing people to engage as much or as little as they would like. The variety of social media platforms, including Facebook, TikTok, Tumblr, Twitter, and YouTube, have differing associated audiences, affordances and norms. These varying platforms allow for more inclusivity as members of the LGBTQ community have the agency to decide where to engage and how to self-present themselves. The existence of the LGBTQ community and discourse on social media platforms is essential to disrupt the reproduction of hegemonic cis-heteronormativity and represent the wide variety of identities that exist.

Before its ban on adult content in 2018, Tumblr was a platform uniquely suited for sharing trans stories and building community. Mainstream social media platforms like TikTok have also been beneficial for the trans community by creating spaces for folks to share resources and transition stories, normalizing trans identity. It has been found that access to LGBTQ content, peers, and community on search engines and social networking sites has allowed for identity acceptance and pride within LGBTQ community.

Algorithms and evaluative criteria control what content is recommended to users on search engines and social networking site. These can reproduce stigmatizing discourses that are dominant within society, and result in negatively impacting LGBTQ self-perception. Social media algorithms have a significant impact on the formation of the LGBTQ community and culture. Algorithmic exclusion occurs when exclusionary practices are reinforced by algorithms across technological landscapes, directly resulting in excluding marginalized identities. The exclusion of these identity representations causes identity insecurity for LGBTQ people, while further perpetuating cis-heteronormative identity discourse. LGBTQ users and allies have found methods of subverting algorithms that may suppress content in order to continue to build these online communities.

==Buying power==

According to Witeck-Combs Communications, Inc. and Marketresearch.com, the 2006 buying power of United States gays and lesbians was approximately $660 billion and was then expected to exceed $835 billion by 2011. Gay consumers can be very loyal to specific brands, wishing to support companies that support the gay community and also provide equal rights for LGBTQ workers. In the UK, this buying power is sometimes abbreviated to &quot;the pink pound.&quot;

According to an article by James Hipps, LGBTQ Americans are more likely to seek out companies that advertise to them and are willing to pay higher prices for premium products and services. This can be attributed to the median household income compared to same-sex couples to opposite-sex couples, as they are twice as likely to have graduated from college, twice as likely to have an individual income over $60,000 and twice as likely to have a household income of $250,000 or more. 

===Consumerism===

Although many claims that the LGBTQ community is more affluent when compared to heterosexual consumers, research has proven that false. However, the LGBTQ community is still an important segment of consumer demographics because of the spending power and loyalty to brands that they have. Witeck-Combs Communications calculated the adult LGBTQ buying power at $830 billion for 2013. Same-sex partnered households spend slightly more than the average home on any given shopping trip. But, they also make more shopping trips compared to the non-LGBTQ households. On average, the difference in spending with same-sex partnered home is 25 percent higher than the average United States household. According to the University of Maryland gay male partners earn $10,000 less on average compared to heterosexual men. However, partnered lesbians receive about $7,000 more a year than heterosexual married women. Hence, same-sex partners and heterosexual partners are about equal concerning consumer affluence.

The LGBTQ community has been recognized for being one of the largest consumers in travel. Travel includes annual trips, and sometimes even multiple annual trips. Annually, the LGBTQ community spends around $65 billion on travel, totaling 10 percent of the United States travel market. Many common travel factors play into LGBTQ travel decisions, but if there is a destination that is especially tailored to the LGBTQ community, then they are more likely to travel to those places.

===Demographics===

In a survey conducted in 2012, younger Americans are more likely to identify as gay. Statistics continue to decrease with age, as adults between ages 18–29 are three times more likely to identify as LGBTQ than seniors older than 65. These statistics for the LGBTQ community are taken into account just as they are with other demographics to find trend patterns for specific products. Consumers who identify as LGBTQ are more likely to regularly engage in various activities as opposed to those who identify as heterosexual. According to Community Marketing, Inc., 90 percent of lesbians and 88 percent of gay men will dine out with friends regularly. And similarly, 31 percent of lesbians and 50 percent of gay men will visit a club or a bar.

And at home, the likelihood of LGBTQ women having children at home as non-LGBTQ women is equal. However, LGBTQ men are half as likely when compared with non-LGBTQ men to have children at home. Household incomes for sixteen percent of LGBTQ Americans range above $90,000 per year, in comparison with 21 percent of the overall adult population. However, a key difference is that those who identify as LGBTQ have fewer children collectively in comparison to heterosexual partners. Another factor at hand is that LGBTQ populations of color continue to face income barriers along with the rest of the race issues, so they will expectedly earn less and not be as affluent as predicted.

An analysis of a Gallup survey shows detailed estimates that – during the years 2012 through 2014 – the metropolitan area with the highest percentage of LGBTQ community was San Francisco, California. The next highest were Portland, Oregon, and Austin, Texas.

A 2019 survey of the Two-Spirit and LGBTQ+ population in the Canadian city of Hamilton, Ontario, called &quot;Mapping the Void: Two-Spirit and LGBTQ+ Experiences in Hamilton&quot; showed that out of 906 respondents, when it came to sexual orientation, 48.9% identified as bisexual/pansexual, 21.6% identified as gay, 18.3% identified as lesbian, 4.9% identified as queer, and 6.3% identified as other (a category consisting of those who indicated they were asexual, heterosexual, or questioning, and those who gave no response for their sexual orientation).

A 2019 survey of trans and non-binary people in Canada called &quot;Trans PULSE Canada&quot; showed that out of 2,873 respondents. When it came to sexual orientation, 13% identified as asexual, 28% identified as bisexual, 13% identified as gay, 15% identified as lesbian, 31% identified as pansexual, 8% identified as straight or heterosexual, 4% identified as two-spirit, and 9% identified as unsure or questioning.

In a survey carried out in 2021, Gallup found that 7.1% of U.S. adults identify as &quot;lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or something other than straight or heterosexual&quot;.

===Marketing===

Marketing towards the LGBTQ community was not always a strategy among advertisers. For the last three to four decades, Corporate America has created a market niche for the LGBTQ community. Three distinct phases define the marketing turnover: 1) shunning in the 1980s, 2) curiosity and fear in the 1990s, and 3) pursuit in the 2000s.

Just recently, marketers have picked up the LGBTQ demographic. With a spike in same-sex marriage in 2014, marketers are figuring out new ways to tie in a person&#x27;s sexual orientation to a product being sold. In efforts to attract members of the LGBTQ community to their products, market researchers are developing marketing methods that reach these new families. Advertising history has shown that when marketing to the family, it was always the wife, the husband, and the children. But today, that is not necessarily the case. There could be families of two fathers or two mothers with one child or six children. Breaking away from the traditional family setting, marketing researchers notice the need to recognize these different family configurations.

One area that marketers are subject to fall under is stereotyping the LGBTQ community. When marketing towards the community, they may corner their target audience into an &quot;alternative&quot; lifestyle category that ultimately &quot;others&quot; the LGBTQ community. Sensitivity is important when marketing towards the community. When marketing towards the LGBTQ community, advertisers respect the same boundaries.

Marketers also refer to LGBTQ as a single characteristic that makes an individual. Other areas can be targeted along with the LGBTQ segment such as race, age, culture, and income levels. Knowing the consumer gives these marketers power.

Along with attempts to engage with the LGBTQ community, researchers have found gender disagreements among products with respective consumers. For instance, a gay male may want a more feminine product, whereas a lesbian female may be interested in a more masculine product. This does not hold for the entire LGBTQ community, but the possibilities of these differences are far greater. In the past, gender was seen as fixed, and a congruent representation of an individual&#x27;s sex. It is understood now that sex and gender are fluid separately. Researchers also noted that when evaluating products, a person&#x27;s biological sex is as equal is a determinant as their self-concept. As a customer response, when the advertisement is directed towards them, gay men and women are more likely to have an interest in the product. This is an important factor and goal for marketers because it indicates future loyalty to the product or brand.

==Discrimination==
LGBTQ individuals have faced a long history of discrimination. They&#x27;ve been labeled as mentally ill, faced forced attempts to change who they are, and experienced hate crimes and exclusion from jobs, homes, and public places.

Survey studies show that instances of personal discrimination are common among LGBTQ community. This includes things like slurring, sexual harassment, and violence. According to a survey conducted for National Public Radio, at least one in five LGBTQ Americans have experienced discrimination in public because of their identity. This includes in housing, education, employment, and law enforcement. Furthermore, the report reveals that people of color in the LGBTQ community are twice more likely than white people in the LGBTQ community to experience discrimination, specifically in job applications and interactions with police. One-third of LGBTQ Americans believe that the bigger problem is based on laws, and government policies, and the rest believe that it is based on individual prejudice. Due to the experiences of discrimination in public, many LGBTQ Americans tries to avoid situations or places out of fear of discrimination, such as bathrooms, medical care, or calling the police.

A survey by CAP shows that 25.2% of LGBTQ people experienced discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, and that these discriminations negatively affect their well-being and living environment. Due to the fear of discrimination, many LGBTQ people change their lives such as hiding their relationships, delaying health care, avoid social situations, etc. In research publish by UCLA School of Law, survey data showed that 29.8% of LGBTQ employees experienced workplace discrimination such as being fired or not hired. LGBTQ employees who are people of color were much more likely to report that they didn&#x27;t get hired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, compared to white LGBTQ employees. Transgender employees were more likely to face discrimination based on their LGBTQ identity compared to cisgender LGBTQ employees. Almost half (48.8%) of transgender employees experienced discrimination due to their LGBTQ identity, while only 27.8% of cisgender LGBTQ employees reported such experiences. In addition, over half (57.0%) of discriminated LGBTQ employees said their employer or co-workers indicated that the unfair treatment was linked to religious beliefs. In the U.S., certain states have passed laws permitting child welfare agencies to deny services to LGBTQ community based on religious or moral beliefs. Similarly, some states allow healthcare providers to refuse certain procedures or medications for LGBTQ community on religious or moral grounds. Additionally, certain states permit businesses to decline services to LGBTQ people or same-sex couples, particularly in the context of wedding-related services, citing religious or moral beliefs.

In a 2001 study that examined possible root causes of mental disorders in lesbian, gay and bisexual people, Cochran and psychologist Vickie M. Mays, of the University of California, explored whether ongoing discrimination fuels anxiety, depression and other stress-related mental health problems among cisgender LGBTQ people. The authors found strong evidence of a relationship between the two. The team compared how 74 cisgender LGBTQ and 2,844 heterosexual respondents rated lifetime and daily experiences with discrimination such as not being hired for a job or being denied a bank loan, as well as feelings of perceived discrimination. Cisgender LGBTQ respondents reported higher rates of perceived discrimination than heterosexuals in every category related to discrimination, the team found. However, while gay youth are considered to be at higher risk for suicide, a literature review published in the journal &quot;Adolescence&quot; states, &quot;Being gay in-and-of-itself is not the cause of the increase in suicide.&quot; Rather the review notes that the findings of previous studies suggested the,&quot;...suicide attempts were significantly associated with psychosocial stressors, including gender nonconformity, early awareness of being gay, victimization, lack of support, school dropout, family problems, acquaintances&#x27; suicide attempts, homelessness, substance abuse, and other psychiatric disorders. Some of these stressors are also experienced by heterosexual adolescents, but they have been shown to be more prevalent among gay adolescents.&quot; Despite recent progress in LGBTQ rights, gay men continue to experience high rates of loneliness and depression after coming out.

==Multiculturalism==

===General===
LGBTQ multiculturalism is the diversity within the LGBTQ community as a representation of different sexual orientations, gender identities—as well as different ethnic, language, religious groups within the LGBTQ community. At the same time as LGBTQ and multiculturalism relation, may consider the inclusion of LGBTQ community into a larger multicultural model, as for example in universities, such multicultural model includes the LGBTQ community together and equal representation with other large minority groups such as African Americans in the United States.

The two movements have much in common politically. Both are concerned with tolerance for real differences, diversity, minority status, and the invalidity of value judgments applied to different ways of life.

Researchers have identified the emergence of gay and lesbian communities during several progressive time periods across the world including: the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and modern Westernization. Depending on geographic location, some of these communities experienced more opposition to their existence than others; nonetheless, they began to permeate society both socially and politically.

===European cities past and present===
City spaces in Early Modern Europe were host to a wealth of gay activity; however, these scenes remained semi-secretive for a long period of time. Dating back to the 1500s, city conditions such as apprenticeship labor relations and living arrangements, abundant student and artist activity, and hegemonic norms surrounding female societal status were typical in Venice and Florence, Italy. Under these circumstances, many open minded young people were attracted to these city settings. Consequently, an abundance of same-sex interactions began to take place. Many of the connections formed then often led to the occurrence of casual romantic and sexual relationships, the prevalence of which increased quite rapidly over time until a point at which they became a subculture and community of their own.
Literature and ballroom culture gradually made their way onto the scene and became integrated despite transgressive societal views. Perhaps the most well-known of these are the balls of Magic-City. Amsterdam and London have also been recognized as leading locations for LGBTQ community establishment. By the 1950s, these urban spaces were booming with gay venues such as bars and public saunas where community members could come together. Paris and London were particularly attracting to the lesbian population as platforms for not only socialization, but education as well. A few other urban occasions that are important to the LGBTQ community include Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Mardi Gras in Sydney, Australia, as well as the various other pride parades hosted in bigger cities around the world.

===Urban spaces in the United States===
In the same way in which LGBTQ community used the city backdrop to join socially, they were able to join forces politically as well. This new sense of collectivity provided somewhat of a safety net for individuals when voicing their demands for equal rights. In the United States specifically, several key political events have taken place in urban contexts. Some of these include, but are not limited to:

* Independence Hall, Philadelphia - gay and lesbian protest movement in 1965 – activists led by Barbara Gittings started some of the first picket lines here. These protests continued on and off until 1969. Gittings went on to run the Gay and Lesbian Task Force of the American Library Association for 15 years.
* The Stonewall Inn, on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village, Manhattan – the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement in 1969 – for the first time, a group of gay men and drag queens fought back against police during a raid on this small bar in Greenwich Village. The site is now a U.S. National Historic Landmark.
* Castro Street, San Francisco – gathering place for LGBTQ community beginning in the 1970s; this urban spot was an oasis of hopefulness. Home to the first openly gay elected official Harvey Milk and the legendary Castro Theater, this cityscape remains iconic to the LGBTQ community.
* Cambridge, Massachusetts City Hall, was the site of the first same-sex marriage in U.S. history in 2004. Following this event, attempts by religious groups in the area to ban it have been stifled and many more states have joined the Commonwealth.
* AIDS Activities Coordinating Office, Philadelphia – an office to help stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, by providing proper administrative components, direct assistance, and education on HIV/AIDS.

During and following these events, LGBTQ community subculture began to grow and stabilize into a nationwide phenomenon. Gay bars became more and more popular in large cities. For gays particularly, increasing numbers of cruising areas, public bath houses, and YMCAs in these urban spaces continued to welcome them to experience a more liberated way of living. For lesbians, this led to the formation of literary societies, private social clubs, and same-sex housing. The core of this community-building took place in New York City and San Francisco, but cities like St. Louis, Lafayette Park in WA, and Chicago quickly followed suit.

===City===
Cities afford a host of prime conditions that allow for better individual development as well as collective movement that are not otherwise available in rural spaces. First and foremost, urban landscapes offer LGBTQ community better prospects to meet each other and form networks and relationships. One ideal platform within this framework was the free labor market of many capitalistic societies, which enticed people to break away from their often damaging traditional nuclear families in order to pursue employment in bigger cities. Making the move to these spaces afforded them new liberty in the realms of sexuality, identity, and kinship. Some researchers describe this as a phase of resistance against the confining expectations of normativity. Urban LGBTQ community demonstrated this pushback through various outlets, including their style of dress, the way they talked and carried themselves, and how they chose to build community. From a social science perspective, the relationship between the city and the LGBTQ community is not a one-way street. LGBTQ community give back as much, if not more, in terms of economic contributions (i.e., &quot;pink money&quot;), activism and politics too.

== Intersections of race ==

Compared to white LGBTQ people, LGBTQ people of color often experience prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination on the basis of not only their sexual orientation and gender identity, but also on the basis of race. Nadal and colleagues discuss LGBTQ people of color and their experience of intersectional microaggressions which target various aspects of their social identities. These negative experiences and microaggressions can come from cisgender and heterosexual white people, cisgender and heterosexual people of their own race, and from the LGBTQ community themselves, which is usually dominated by white people.

Some LGBTQ people of color do not feel comfortable and represented within LGBTQ spaces. A comprehensive and systematic review of the existing published research literature around the experiences of LGBTQ people of color finds a common theme of exclusion in largely white LGBTQ spaces. These spaces are typically dominated by white LGBTQ people, promote White and Western values, and often leave LGBTQ people of color feeling as though they must choose between their racial community or their gender and sexual orientation community. In general, Western society will often subtly code &quot;gay&quot; as white; white LGBTQ people are often seen as the face of LGBTQ culture and values.

The topic of coming out and revealing one&#x27;s sexual orientation and gender identity to the public is associated with white values and expectations in mainstream discussions. Where white Western culture places value on the ability to speak openly about one&#x27;s identity with family, one particular study found that LGBTQ participants of color viewed their family&#x27;s silence about their identity as supportive and accepting. For example, collectivist cultures view the coming out process as a family affair rather than an individual one. Furthermore, the annual National Coming Out Day centers on white perspectives as an event meant to help an LGBTQ person feel liberated and comfortable in their own skin. However, for some LGBTQ people of color, National Coming Out Day is viewed in a negative light. In communities of color, coming out publicly can have adverse consequences, risking their personal sense of safety as well as that of their familial and communal relationships. White LGBTQ people tend to collectively reject these differences in perspective on coming out, resulting in possibly further isolating LGBTQ people of color.

<text>Deoxyuridine (dU) is a compound and a nucleoside. It belongs to a class of compounds known as Pyrimidine 2&#x27;-deoxyribonucleosides and closely resembles the chemical composition of uridine but without the presence of the 2&#x27; hydroxyl group. Idoxuridine and Trifluridine are variants of deoxyuridine used as antiviral drugs. They are similar enough to be incorporated as part of DNA replication, but they possess side groups on the uracil component (an iodine and a CF3 group, respectively), that prevent base pairing. A known use of dU is as a precursor in the synthesis of Edoxudine.

This compound exists in all living organisms and can become part of DNA in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells through two mechanisms. The first is the removal of an amino group from cytosine to result in uracil and the second is the non-intentional incorporation of pyrimidine where thymine belongs in the DNA, resulting in dUMP. 

UMP synthase deficiency is a metabolic disorder in humans that involves deoxyuridine. Deoxyuridine can be toxic. It has also been found in several foods, which makes it a useful indicator for diseases through consumption of those foods.
