<text>In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Iris (; ; ) is a daughter of the gods Thaumas and Electra, the personification of the rainbow and messenger of the gods, a servant to the Olympians and especially Queen Hera. 

Iris appears in several stories carrying messages from and to the gods or running errands but has no unique mythology of her own. Similarly, very little to none of a historical cult and worship of Iris is attested in surviving records, with only a few traces surviving from the island of Delos. In ancient art, Iris is depicted as a winged young woman carrying a caduceus, the symbol of the messengers, and a pitcher of water for the gods. Iris was traditionally seen as the consort of Zephyrus, the god of the west wind and one of the four Anemoi, by whom she is the mother of Pothos in some versions.

== Etymology ==
The ancient Greek noun means both the rainbow and the halo of the Moon. An inscription from Corinth provides evidence for an original form (&quot;wîris&quot;) with a digamma that was eventually dropped. The noun seems to be of pre-Greek origin. A Proto-Indo-European pre-form &quot;*uh2i-r-i-&quot; has been suggested, although Beekes finds it &#x27;hard to motivate.&#x27;

== Family ==
According to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Iris is the daughter of Thaumas and the Oceanid Electra and the sister of the Harpies: Arke and Ocypete. During the Titanomachy, Iris was the messenger of the Olympian gods while her sister Arke betrayed the Olympians and became the messenger of the gods&#x27; enemy, the Titans. She is the goddess of the rainbow. She also serves nectar to the goddesses and gods to drink.

Zephyrus, who is the god of the west wind, is often said to be her consort. Together they had a son named Pothos, or alternatively they were the parents of Eros, the god of love, according to sixth century BC Greek lyric poet Alcaeus, though Eros is usually said to be the son of Ares and Aphrodite. According to the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; of Nonnus, Iris&#x27; brother is Hydaspes.

She is also known as one of the goddesses of the sea and the sky. Iris links the gods to humanity. She travels with the speed of wind from one end of the world to the other and into the depths of the sea and the underworld.

== Mythology ==
=== Titanomachy ===
Iris is said to travel on the rainbow while carrying messages from the gods to mortals. In some records, Iris is a sister to fellow messenger goddess Arke (&quot;swift&quot;, &quot;quick&quot;); both sisters originally sided with the Olympian gods during the Titanomachy, but Arke eventually flew out of the company of Olympians to join the Titans as their own messenger goddess, so the two sisters found each other on opposite camps during the battle.

After the war was won by the Olympian leader Zeus and his allies, Zeus punished Arke by tearing her wings from her and in time gave them as a gift to the Nereid Thetis at her wedding to Peleus, who in turn gave them to her son, Achilles, who wore them on his feet. Achilles was sometimes known as &quot;podarkes&quot; (feet like [the wings of] Arke). Podarces was also the original name of Priam, the king of Troy. Iris on the other hand maintained her position as the messenger of the gods alongside Hermes; often Iris served specifically as Hera&#x27;s personal messenger and servant.

=== Messenger of the gods ===
Following her daughter Persephone&#x27;s abduction by Hades, the goddess of agriculture Demeter withdrew to her temple in Eleusis and made the earth barren, causing a great famine that killed off mortals, and as a result sacrifices to the gods ceased. Zeus then sent Iris to Demeter, calling her to join the other gods and lift her curse; but as her daughter was not returned, Demeter was not persuaded.

In one narrative, after Leto and her children pleaded with Zeus to release Prometheus from his torment, Zeus relented, and sent Iris to order Heracles to free the unfortunate Prometheus.

After Ceyx drowned in a shipwreck, Hera made Iris convey her orders to Hypnos, the god of sleep. Iris flew and found him in his cave, and informed him that Hera wished for Ceyx&#x27;s wife, Alcyone, to be informed of her loved one&#x27;s death in her dreams. After delivering Hera&#x27;s command, Iris left immediately, not standing to be near Hypnos for too long, for his powers took hold of her, and made her dizzy and sleepy.

In Aristophanes&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Birds&quot;, the titular birds build a city in the sky and plan to supplant the Olympian gods. Iris, as the messenger, goes to meet them, but she is ridiculed, insulted, and threatened with rape by their leader Pisetaerus, an elderly Athenian man. Iris appears confused that Pisetearus does not know who the gods are and that she is one of them. Pisetaerus then tells her that the birds are the gods now, the deities whom the humans must sacrifice to. After Pisetaerus threatens to rape her, Iris scolds him for his foul language and leaves, warning him that Zeus, whom she refers to as her father, will deal with him and make him pay.

Iris also appears several times in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, usually as an agent of Juno. In Book 4, Juno dispatches her to pluck a lock of hair from the head of Queen Dido, so that she may die and enter Hades. In book 5, Iris, having taken on the form of a Trojan woman, stirs up the other Trojan mothers to set fire to four of Aeneas&#x27; ships in order to prevent them from leaving Sicily.

According to the Roman poet Ovid, after Romulus was deified as the god Quirinus, his wife Hersilia pleaded with the gods to let her become immortal as well so that she could be with her husband once again. Juno heard her plea and sent Iris down to her. With a single finger, Iris touched Hersilia and transformed her into an immortal goddess. Hersilia flew to Olympus, where she became one of the Horae and was permitted to live with her husband forevermore.

=== Trojan War ===
According to the lost epic &quot;Cypria&quot; by Stasinus, it was Iris who informed Menelaus, who had sailed off to Crete, of what had happened back in Sparta while he was gone, namely his wife Helen&#x27;s elopement with the Trojan Prince Paris as well as the death of Helen&#x27;s brother Castor.

Iris is frequently mentioned as a divine messenger in &quot;The Iliad&quot;, which is attributed to Homer. She does not, however, appear in &quot;The Odyssey,&quot; where her role is instead filled by Hermes. Like Hermes, Iris carries a caduceus or winged staff. By command of Zeus, the king of the gods, she carries a ewer of water from the River Styx, with which she puts to sleep all who perjure themselves. In Book XXIII, she delivers Achilles&#x27;s prayer to Boreas and Zephyrus to light the funeral pyre of Patroclus. In the last book, Zeus sends Iris to King Priam, to tell him that he should go to the Achaean camp alone and ransom the body of his slain son Hector from Achilles. Iris swiftly delivers the message to Priam and returns to Olympus.

=== Other myths ===
According to the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Apollo&quot;, when Leto was in labor prior to giving birth to her twin children Apollo and Artemis, all the goddesses were in attendance except for two, Hera and Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth. On the ninth day of her labor, Leto told Iris to bribe Eileithyia and ask for her help in giving birth to her children, without allowing Hera to find out. According to Callimachus, Iris along with Ares ordered, on Hera&#x27;s orders, all cities and other places to shun the pregnant Leto and deny her shelter where she could bring forth her twins. After Asteria, now transformed into the island of Delos, offered shelter to Leto, Iris flew back to Hera to inform her that Leto had been allowed to give birth due to Asteria defying Hera&#x27;s orders, and took her seat beside Hera.

According to Apollonius Rhodius, Iris turned back the Argonauts Zetes and Calais, who had pursued the Harpies to the Strophades (&quot;Islands of Turning&quot;). The brothers had driven off the monsters from their torment of the prophet Phineus, but did not kill them upon the request of Iris, who promised that Phineus would not be bothered by the Harpies again.

After King Creon of Thebes forbade the burial of the dead Argive soldiers who had raised their arms against Thebes, Hera ordered Iris to moisturize their dead bodies with dew and ambrosia.

In a lesser-known narrative, Iris once came close to being raped by the satyrs after she attempted to disrupt their worship of Dionysus, perhaps at the behest of Hera. About fifteen black-and-red-figure vase paintings dating from the fifth century BC depict said satyrs either menacingly advancing toward or getting hold of her when she tries to interfere with the sacrifice. In another cup, Iris is depicted being assaulted by the satyrs, who apparently are trying to prevent Iris from stealing sacrificial meat from the altar of Dionysus, who is also present in the scene. On the other side, the satyrs are attacking Hera, who stands between Hermes and Heracles. The ancient playwright Achaeus wrote &quot;Iris&quot;, a now lost satyr play, which might have been the source of those vases&#x27; subject.

In Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Heracles Gone Mad&quot;, Iris appears alongside Lyssa, the goddess of madness and insanity, cursing Heracles with the fit of madness in which he kills his three sons and his wife Megara. Iris also prepared the bed of Zeus and Hera.

== Worship ==
=== Cult ===

Unlike the other prominent messenger god of the Greeks, Hermes, Iris did not play a large part in the ancient Greek religion and was rarely worshipped. There are no known temples, shrines, or sanctuaries to Iris, or festivals held in her honour. While she is frequently depicted on vases and in bas-reliefs, few statues are known to have been made of Iris during antiquity. She was however depicted in sculpture on the west pediment of Parthenon in Athens.

Iris does appear to have been the object of at least some minor worship, but the only trace preserved of her cult is the note by Athenaeus in &quot;Scholars at Dinner&quot; that the people of Delos sacrificed to Iris, offering her cheesecakes called &quot;basyniae&quot;, a type of cake of wheat-flour, suet, and honey, boiled up together.

=== Epithets ===
Iris had numerous poetic titles and epithets, including &quot;chrysopteros&quot; ( &quot;golden winged&quot;), &quot;podas ōkea&quot; ( &quot;swift footed&quot;) or &quot;podēnemos ōkea&quot; ( &quot;wind-swift footed&quot;), &quot;roscida&quot; (&quot;dewy&quot;, Latin), and &quot;Thaumantias&quot; or &quot;Thaumantis&quot; (, , &quot;Daughter of Thaumas, Wondrous One&quot;), &quot;aellopus&quot; ( &quot;storm-footed, storm-swift). She also watered the clouds with her pitcher, obtaining the water from the sea.

== Representation ==
Iris is represented either as a rainbow or as a beautiful young maiden with wings on her shoulders. As a goddess, Iris is associated with communication, messages, the rainbow, and new endeavors. This personification of a rainbow was once described as being a link to the heavens and earth.

In some texts she is depicted wearing a coat of many colors. With this coat she actually creates the rainbows she rides to get from place to place. Iris&#x27; wings were said to be so beautiful that she could even light up a dark cavern, a trait observable from the story of her visit to Somnus in order to relay a message to Alcyone.

While Iris was principally associated with communication and messages, she was also believed to aid in the fulfillment of humans&#x27; prayers, either by fulfilling them herself or by bringing them to the attention of other deities.

<text>Crime fiction, detective story, murder mystery, crime novel, mystery novel, and police novel are terms used to describe narratives that centre on criminal acts and especially on the investigation, either by an amateur or a professional detective, of a crime, often a murder. Most crime drama focuses on criminal investigation and does not feature the courtroom. Suspense and mystery are key elements that are nearly ubiquitous to the genre.

It is usually distinguished from mainstream fiction and other genres such as historical fiction and science fiction, but the boundaries are indistinct. Crime fiction has several subgenres, including detective fiction (such as the whodunit), courtroom drama, hard-boiled fiction, and legal thrillers.

==History==
Proto-science and crime fictions have been composed across history, and in this category can be placed texts as varied as the Epic of Gilgamesh from Mesopotamia, the Mahabharata from ancient India, the Book of Tobit, Urashima Tarō from ancient Japan, the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; (&quot;Arabian Nights&quot;), and more. One example of a story of this genre is the medieval Arabic tale of &quot;The Three Apples&quot;, one of the tales narrated by Scheherazade in the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;. In this tale, a fisherman discovers a heavy locked chest along the Tigris River, and he sells it to the Abbasid Caliph, Harun al-Rashid, who then has the chest broken open, only to find inside it the dead body of a young woman who was cut into pieces. Harun orders his vizier, Ja&#x27;far ibn Yahya, to solve the crime and find the murderer within three days, or be executed if he fails his assignment. The story has been described as a &quot;whodunit&quot; murder mystery with multiple plot twists. The story has detective fiction elements.

Two other &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; stories, &quot;The Merchant and the Thief&quot; and &quot;Ali Khwaja&quot;, contain two of the earliest fictional detectives, who uncover clues and present evidence to catch or convict a criminal, with the story unfolding in normal chronology and the criminal already being known to the audience. The latter involves a climax where titular detective protagonist Ali Khwaja presents evidence from expert witnesses in a court. &quot;The Hunchback&#x27;s Tale&quot; is another early courtroom drama, presented as a suspenseful comedy.

The earliest known modern crime fiction is E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s 1819 novella &quot;Mademoiselle de Scudéri&quot;. Also, Thomas Skinner Surr&#x27;s anonymous &quot;Richmond&quot; is from 1827; another early full-length short story in the genre is &quot;The Rector of Veilbye&quot; by Danish author Steen Steensen Blicher, published in 1829. A further example of crime detection can be found in Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s story &quot;The Knife&quot;, published in 1832, although here the truth remains in doubt at the end.

Better known are the earlier dark works of Edgar Allan Poe. His brilliant and eccentric detective C. Auguste Dupin, a forerunner of Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes, appeared in works such as &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; (1841), &quot;The Mystery of Marie Rogêt&quot; (1842), and &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot; (1844). With his Dupin stories, Poe provided the framework for the classic detective story. The detective&#x27;s unnamed companion is the narrator of the stories and a prototype for the character of Dr. Watson in later Sherlock Holmes stories.

Wilkie Collins&#x27; epistolary novel &quot;The Woman in White&quot; was published in 1860, while &quot;The Moonstone&quot; (1868) is often thought to be his masterpiece. French author Émile Gaboriau&#x27;s &quot;Monsieur Lecoq&quot; (1868) laid the groundwork for the methodical, scientifically minded detective.
The evolution of locked-room mysteries was one of the landmarks in the history of crime fiction. The Sherlock Holmes mysteries of Doyle&#x27;s are said to have been singularly responsible for the huge popularity of this genre. A precursor was Paul Féval, whose series &quot;Les Habits Noirs&quot; (1862–67) features Scotland Yard detectives and criminal conspiracies. The best-selling crime novel of the 19th century was Fergus Hume&#x27;s &quot;The Mystery of a Hansom Cab&quot; (1886), set in Melbourne, Australia.

The evolution of the print mass media in the United Kingdom and the United States in the latter half of the 19th century was crucial in popularising crime fiction and related genres. Literary &#x27;variety&#x27; magazines, such as &quot;Strand&quot;, &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, quickly became central to the overall structure and function of popular fiction in society, providing a mass-produced medium that offered cheap, illustrated publications that were essentially disposable.

Like the works of many other important fiction writers of his day—e.g. Wilkie Collins and Charles Dickens—Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes stories first appeared in serial form in the monthly &quot;Strand&quot; in the United Kingdom. The series quickly attracted a wide and passionate following on both sides of the Atlantic, and when Doyle killed off Holmes in &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, the public outcry was so great, and the publishing offers for more stories so attractive, that he was reluctantly forced to resurrect him.

In Italy, early translations of English and American stories and local works were published in cheap yellow covers, thus the genre was baptized with the term &quot;libri gialli&quot; or yellow books. The genre was outlawed by the Fascists during WWII, but exploded in popularity after the war, especially influenced by the American hard-boiled school of crime fiction. A group of mainstream Italian writers emerged, who used the detective format to create an antidetective or postmodern novel in which the detectives are imperfect, the crimes are usually unsolved, and clues are left for the reader to decipher. Famous writers include Leonardo Sciascia, Umberto Eco, and Carlo Emilio Gadda.

In Spain, &quot;The Nail and Other Tales of Mystery and Crime&quot; was published by Pedro Antonio de Alarcón in 1853. Crime fiction in Spain (also curtailed in Francoist Spain) took on some special characteristics that reflected the culture of the country. The Spanish writers emphasized the corruption and ineptitude of the police, and depicted the authorities and the wealthy in very negative terms.

In China, crime fiction is a major literary tradition, with works dating to the Song, Ming and Qing dynasties. Modern Chinese crime fiction emerged from the 1890s, and was also influenced by translations of foreign works. Cheng Xiaoqing, considered the &quot;Grand Master&quot; of 20th-century Chinese detective fiction, translated Sherlock Holmes into classical and vernacular Chinese. In the late 1910s, Cheng began writing his own detective fiction series, &quot;Sherlock in Shanghai&quot;, mimicking Conan Doyle&#x27;s style, but relating better to a Chinese audience. During the Mao era, crime fiction was suppressed and mainly Soviet-styled and anticapitalist. In the post-Mao era, crime fiction in China focused on corruption and harsh living conditions during the Mao era (such as the Cultural Revolution).

=== Golden Age ===
The Golden Age, which spanned from the 1920s to 1954, was a period of time featuring the creation of renowned works by several authors. Many of these authors were British. Agatha Christie wrote &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; (1926) and &quot;The Murder at the Vicarage&quot; (1930). These novels commonly prioritized the allure of exploring mysteries in the plot over in-depth character development. Dorothy L. Sayers contributed the Wimsey novels. Her work focused on the spectacle of crime deduction. She also displayed an exaggerated form of aristocratic society, straying from a more realistic story. Other novelists tapped into this setting, such as Margery Allingham and Ngaio Marsh; Allingham, Christie, Marsh and Sayers are known as the &quot;Queens of Crime&quot;. 

Other British authors are G. K. Chesterton with the Father Brown short stories, and Henry Christopher Bailey.

The Golden Age also had roots in the US. As used by S. S. Van Dine, fictional character Philo Vance also took advantage of an inflated personality and a high-class background in a plethora of novels. In 1929, Father Ronald Knox wrote the ‘Detective Story Decalogue,’ mentioning some conditions of the era. Early foreshadowing and functioning roles for characters were discussed, as well as other items. Ellery Queen was featured in several novels written by Frederic Dannay and Manfred Lee, serving as both a character and pen name. In such novels, clues may be analyzed by the protagonist in tandem with the viewer, generating the possibility of understanding the narrative before it is revealed in the book.

=== Hard-Boiled Age ===
Past the Golden Age, events such as the Great Depression and the transition between World Wars ushered in a change in American crime fiction. There was a shift into hard-boiled novels and their depictions of realism. Dashiell Hammett and his work, including &quot;Red Harvest&quot; (1929), offered a more realistic social perspective to crime fiction, referencing events such as the Great Depression. James M. Cain contributed &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; (1934). This novel includes a married woman trying to murder her own husband with the assistance of a potential suitor. This theme extends to his other work, &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1934). Such elements of the book were a reference to the Gray and Snyder trial. Raymond Chandler was a significant author who managed to see some works made into films. In 1944, he argued for the genre to be seen critically in his essay from ‘The Simple Art of Murder.’

==Psychology==
Crime fiction provides unique psychological impacts on readers and enables them to become mediated witnesses through identifying with eyewitnesses of a crime. Readers speak of crime fiction as a mode of escapism to cope with other aspects of their lives. Crime fiction provides distraction from readers&#x27; personal lives through a strong narrative at a comfortable distance. Forensic crime novels have been referred to as &quot;distraction therapy&quot;, proposing that crime fiction can improve mental health and be considered as a form of treatment to prevent depression.

== Categories ==
* Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detective—either professional, amateur, or retired—investigates a crime, often murder.
* The cozy mystery is a subgenre of detective fiction in which profanity, sex, and violence are downplayed or treated humorously.
* The whodunit, the most common form of detective fiction, features a complex, plot-driven story in which the reader is provided with clues from which the identity of the perpetrator of the crime may be deduced before the solution is revealed at the end of the book.
* The historical whodunit is also a subgenre of historical fiction. The setting of the story and the crime have some historical significance.
* The locked-room mystery is a specialized kind of a whodunit in which the crime is committed under apparently impossible circumstances, such as a locked room, which no intruder could have entered or left.
* The American hardboiled school is distinguished by the unsentimental portrayal of sex and violence; the sleuth usually also confronts danger and engages in violence.
* The police procedural is a story in which the detective is a member of the police, thus the activities of a police force are usually convincingly depicted.
* Forensic crime fiction is similar to the police procedural. The investigator whom the reader follows is usually a medical examiner or pathologist; they must use the forensic evidence left on the body and at the crime scene to catch the killer. This subgenre was first introduced by Patricia Cornwell.
* In a legal thriller, the major characters are lawyers and their employees, and they become involved in proving their cases.
* In spy novels, the major characters are spies, usually working for an intelligence agency.
* The caper story and the criminal novel are stories told from the point of view of the criminals.
* The psychological thriller or psychological suspense, a specific subgenre of the thriller, also incorporates elements from detective fiction, as the protagonist must solve the mystery of the psychological conflict presented in these stories.
* The parody or spoof uses humor or sarcasm.
* The crime thriller has the central characters involved in crime, either in its investigation, as the perpetrator, or less commonly, a victim.
* The “nocturnal picaresque” explores the secrets obscured in a city at nighttime.
* The city mystery showcases the investigation of nefarious circumstances within a city.
* The gothic mystery incorporates paranormal activity into the story, including other beings such as ghosts and vampires.
* In the gallows subgenre, the story revolves around the hanging of potential criminals at hand.
* In the criminal confession subgenre, character motives and admittance are discussed.

=== Pseudonymous authors ===
In the history of crime fiction, some authors have been reluctant to publish their novels under their real names. More recently, some publish pseudonymously because of the belief that since the large booksellers are aware of their historical sales figures, and command a certain degree of influence over publishers, the only way to &quot;break out&quot; of their current advance numbers is to publish as someone with no track record.

In the late 1930s and 1940s, British County Court Judge Arthur Alexander Gordon Clark (1900–1958) published a number of detective novels under the alias Cyril Hare, in which he made use of his profoundly extensive knowledge of the English legal system. When he was still young and unknown, award-winning British novelist Julian Barnes (born 1946) published some crime novels under the alias Dan Kavanagh. Other authors take delight in cherishing their alter egos; Ruth Rendell (1930–2015) wrote one sort of crime novels as Ruth Rendell and another type as Barbara Vine; John Dickson Carr also used the pseudonym Carter Dickson. Author Evan Hunter (which itself was a pseudonym) wrote his crime fiction under the name of Ed McBain.

== Tropes ==
As crime fiction has expanded, there have been many common tropes that emerge from this category of fiction. Such occurrences can appear in a variety of subgenres and media.

While the format may vary across different forms of crime fiction, there are many elements that are generally consistent throughout the genre. Many stories often begin when the crime has already occurred. Such fiction also tends to draw from the cultural aspects in which the work originated, whether from recent events or from a general consensus and viewpoints. The use of serial killers and unreliable narrators exists in a decent variety of crime fiction as well.

The plot-puzzle formula, which was frequent in the Golden Age, makes use of potential hints and solutions to drive a story forward in order to unravel mysteries. Likewise, the feature of detectives was popularized by Edgar Allan Poe and Conan Doyle. Hard-boiled detective stories attracted a decent amount of attention to the genre in America and France as well.

Within crime fiction, it can also be common to use dark themes from real life, such as slavery, organized crime, and more. Aside from general themes, referencing instances of crime in real life is also common in several works of crime fiction. These reflections of reality can be expressed in many ways. For instance, crime fiction in Spain expressed grievances with authority, which was opposite to the instances in Japan that credited the government&#x27;s functionality.

Espionage is another prominent inclusion in many works of crime fiction. It includes the use of political intrigue, morality, and the existence of spies. Prior media used the Cold War for inspiration and provided commentary on such events. Examples include numerous works by John le Carré and &quot;Gorky Park&quot; (1981), which was written by Martin Cruz Smith.

Inspiration can be drawn from the legal system around the world, with varying degrees of realism. In these cases, a sense of morality and the more dubious parts of society are explored based on the rules that the work provides. Melville Davisson Post’s &quot;Rudolph Mason: The Strange Schemes&quot; (1896) and Harper Lee’s &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (1960) are notable examples. Additionally, stories like &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1934) are based on cases from reality.

==Availability==

===Classics and bestsellers===
Only a select few authors have achieved the status of &quot;classics&quot; for their published works. A classic is any text that can be received and accepted universally, because they transcend context. A popular, well-known example is Agatha Christie, whose texts, originally published between 1920 and her death in 1976, are available in UK and US editions in all English-speaking nations. Christie&#x27;s works, particularly featuring detectives Hercule Poirot or Miss Jane Marple, have given her the title the Queen of Crime, and made her one of the most important and innovative writers in the development of the genre. Her most famous novels include &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1934), &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1937), and the world&#x27;s best-selling mystery &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; (1939).

Other less successful, contemporary authors who are still writing have seen reprints of their earlier works, due to current overwhelming popularity of crime fiction texts among audiences. One example is Val McDermid, whose first book appeared as far back as 1987; another is Florida-based author Carl Hiaasen, who has been publishing books since 1981, all of which are readily available.

===Revivals===
From time to time, publishing houses decide, for commercial purposes, to revive long-forgotten authors, and reprint one or two of their more commercially successful novels. Apart from Penguin Books, which for this purpose have resorted to their old green cover and dug out some of their vintage authors. Pan started a series in 1999 entitled &quot;Pan Classic Crime&quot;, which includes a handful of novels by Eric Ambler, but also American Hillary Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Last Seen Wearing ...&quot;. In 2000, Edinburgh-based Canongate Books started a series called &quot;Canongate Crime Classics&quot; —both whodunnits and &quot;roman noir&quot; about amnesia and insanity—and other novels. However, books brought out by smaller publishers such as Canongate Books are usually not stocked by the larger bookshops and overseas booksellers. The British Library has also (since 2012) started republishing &quot;lost&quot; crime classics, with the collection referred to on their website as the &quot;British Library Crime Classics series&quot;.

Sometimes, older crime novels are revived by screenwriters and directors rather than publishing houses. In many such cases, publishers then follow suit and release a so-called &quot;film tie-in&quot; edition showing a still from the movie on the front cover and the film credits on the back cover of the book—yet another marketing strategy aimed at those cinemagoers who may want to do both: first read the book and then watch the film (or vice versa). Recent examples include Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; (originally published in 1955), Ira Levin&#x27;s &quot;Sliver&quot; (1991), with the cover photograph depicting a steamy sex scene between Sharon Stone and William Baldwin straight from the 1993 movie, and again, Bret Easton Ellis&#x27;s &quot;American Psycho&quot; (1991). Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, though, have launched what they call &quot;Bloomsbury Film Classics&quot;—a series of original novels on which feature films were based. This series includes, for example, Ethel Lina White&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wheel Spins&quot; (1936), which Alfred Hitchcock—before he went to Hollywood—turned into a much-loved movie entitled &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; (1938), and Ira Levin&#x27;s (born 1929) science-fiction thriller &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; (1976), which was filmed in 1978.

Older novels can often be retrieved from the ever-growing Project Gutenberg database.

<text>Interstate 8 (I-8) is an Interstate Highway in the southwestern United States. It runs from the southern edge of Mission Bay at Sunset Cliffs Boulevard in San Diego, California, almost at the Pacific Ocean, to the junction with I-10, just southeast of Casa Grande, Arizona. In California, the freeway travels through the San Diego metropolitan area as the Ocean Beach Freeway and the Mission Valley Freeway before traversing the Cuyamaca Mountains and providing access through the Imperial Valley, including the city of El Centro. Crossing the Colorado River into Arizona, I-8 continues through the city of Yuma across the Sonoran Desert to Casa Grande, in between the cities of Phoenix and Tucson.

The first route over the Cuyamaca Mountains was dedicated in 1912, and a plank road served as the first road across the Imperial Valley to Yuma; east of there, the Gila Trail continued east to Gila Bend. These were later replaced by U.S. Route 80 (US 80) across California and part of Arizona, and Arizona State Route 84 (SR 84) between Gila Bend and Casa Grande. The US 80 freeway through San Diego was largely complete by the time it was renumbered as I-8 in the 1964 state highway renumbering; east of San Diego, the US 80 roadway was slowly replaced by I-8 as construction progressed in the Imperial Valley. The Arizona portion of the road was built starting in the 1960s. Several controversies erupted during the construction process; questionable labor practices in Imperial County led to the federal conviction of mobster Jimmy Fratianno, and a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee found that the Arizona government had mismanaged financial resources.

The route was completed in 1975 through California, and by 1977 through Arizona, though the bridge over the Colorado River was not completed until 1978. Since then, the freeway through San Diego has been widened due to increasing congestion, and another portion in Imperial County had to be rebuilt following damage by the remnants of Hurricane Kathleen.

==Route description==
I-8 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The freeway from the eastern junction with California State Route 98 (SR 98) to the eastern end is designated as part of the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail auto tour route, promoted by the National Park Service.

===San Diego to Arizona border===
The entirety of Interstate 8 in California is defined in the California Streets and Highways Code as Route 8, whose definition in section 308 is as follows:Route 8 is from:&lt;br&gt;(a) Sunset Cliffs Boulevard to Route 5 in San Diego&lt;br&gt;(b) Route 5 in San Diego to Yuma via El Centro.
The freeway begins at the intersection of Sunset Cliffs Boulevard and Nimitz Boulevard in San Diego. For its first few miles, it parallels the San Diego River floodway. Near Old Town San Diego, I-8 intersects with I-5 as well as with Rosecrans Street, the former routing of SR 209. Even though the freeway west of I-5 is signed with interstate shields, it is not considered a chargeable interstate highway according to Federal Highway Administration route logs, which defines I-8&#x27;s western terminus at I-5. Under regular circumstances, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) would sign this freeway segment as State Route 8.

As the freeway enters Mission Valley, it continues eastward, bisecting the area known as &quot;Hotel Circle&quot; that has several hotels. I-8 then has interchanges with SR 163, I-805, and I-15. In La Mesa, the route intersects SR 125, and in El Cajon it intersects with SR 67. From Mission Valley through El Cajon, it is paralleled by the San Diego Trolley Green Line.

East of El Cajon, it ascends into the mountains and the Cleveland National Forest, traveling through towns such as Alpine then going by the Viejas Casino before reaching Pine Valley. This route achieves four 4,000-foot (1219.2 meters) high points at Carpenter Summit, then crosses the Pine Valley Creek Bridge before the Laguna Summit, followed by the Crestwood Summit, then the Tecate Divide, After the Laguna Summit, the road passes a U.S. border patrol interior checkpoint that was constructed in 1995 near Buckman Springs Road turnoff just east of the summit. However, this resulted in smugglers driving the wrong way on I-8 at high speeds in order to avoid the checkpoint, causing several crashes, even after concrete barriers were installed. The freeway intersects with SR 79 in the national forest before passing through the La Posta and Campo Indian reservations.

In Boulevard, I-8 has an interchange with the eastern end of SR 94.

I-8 straddles the San Diego–Imperial county line for a few miles before turning east. At the Mountain Springs/In-Ko-Pah grade, the freeway is routed down two separate canyons—Devils Canyon for westbound traffic and In-Ko-Pah Gorge for eastbound traffic—as it descends in . In places, the median is over wide. This portion of the road is known for high winds through the canyons that have made driving difficult, sometimes resulting in closure of the freeway; in 1966, the California Highway Patrol estimated that winds blew at speeds of up to . The route enters the Imperial Valley, where it intersects with SR 98, a highway leading to Calexico, and passes near the Desert View Tower. I-8 then goes through Ocotillo and Coyote Wells before entering the city of El Centro several miles later.

In El Centro, I-8 intersects with SR 86 and SR 111, both north–south routes which connect to I-10 in the Coachella Valley, north of the Salton Sea. SR 115 and SR 98 end at I-8 east of El Centro. The route also has the lowest above-ground elevation of any Interstate at below sea level near El Centro. The freeway then traverses the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area and intersects with SR 186 leading south to Baja California Norte, Mexico. I-8 runs parallel to the All-American Canal across the desert for roughly . At points in eastern Imperial County, the Mexican border is less than south of the Interstate. I-8 then passes through Felicity and Winterhaven before crossing the Colorado River on a bridge into Yuma, Arizona.

I-8 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System from I-5 to the western junction of SR 98, though it is not an official state scenic highway. It is officially known as the Border Friendship Route from San Diego to the Arizona state line. The Interstate is signed as the Ocean Beach Freeway west of I-5. For the entire length within San Diego County and into Imperial County, it is signed as the Kumeyaay Highway, after the local Native American tribe and their traditional trade route which the Interstate follows. Between Old Town and El Cajon, I-8 is called the Mission Valley Freeway. In 2014, I-8 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 11,800 vehicles between Bonds Corner Road and SR 115, as well as between SR 98 and Imperial Highway, and 239,000 vehicles between I-805 and I-15, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway in California.

===Yuma to Casa Grande===

I-8 enters Arizona from California at the Colorado River bridge at Yuma. It initially heads south through Yuma until the interchange with US 95, where the freeway begins to turn to the east and passes through eastern Yuma and Fortuna Foothills, briefly paralleling US 95 and passing through a second border inspection station. In the Gila Mountains, the eastbound lanes of I-8 cross under the westbound freeway, briefly traveling to the left near Telegraph Pass before reverting. West of Wellton, the highway takes a northeasterly course, paralleling the Gila River and passing to the south of Roll. Through this part of Arizona, I-8 passes along the northern edge of the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range and to the south of the Yuma Proving Ground. It keeps a northeastern heading, passing through the community of Dateland, until it reaches Gila Bend. There, the freeway intersects SR 85 heading north to Phoenix and south to the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument.

After leaving Gila Bend, I-8 takes a southeastern course as it passes through the Sonoran Desert National Monument. Exiting the national monument grounds, the highway continues on an easterly bearing to a junction with SR 84, a highway that parallels I-8 to the north and goes through Casa Grande, while I-8 passes to the south of both Stanfield and Casa Grande. I-8 reaches its eastern terminus southeast of Casa Grande Mountain Park at an interchange with I-10, which continues north (westbound) to Phoenix, and south (eastbound) to Tucson.

The combination of SR 85 between I-10 and I-8 as well as I-8 between SR 85 and I-10 in Casa Grande has been promoted as a bypass of the Phoenix area for long-distance travelers on I-10. In 2014, I-8 had an AADT of 5,200 vehicles between Butterfield Trail and Freeman Road, and 44,400 vehicles between SR 280 and Araby Road east of Yuma, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway in Arizona. In the early 2010s, I-8 from Casa Grande to Gila Bend was sometimes used for smuggling both drugs and humans.

==History==
The I-8 designation was accepted as a chargeable Interstate by the American Association of State Highway Officials in 1957, and was added to the state highway system in 1964 by the California State Legislature; the US 80 designation was removed at that time.

===San Diego area===
The freeway that would become I-8 was constructed in the mid-20th century through the San Diego area. The section west of I-5 was originally part of SR 109, and was added to I-8 in 1972. In later years, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) made efforts to widen the freeway as congestion increased.

====Initial construction====

Much of Alvarado Canyon Road from San Diego to La Mesa was originally built between 1947 and 1950, a bypass of the old US 80 routing along El Cajon Boulevard and La Mesa Boulevard. Work began to convert the original US 80 divided highway into a freeway in 1960, and the freeway was complete west of El Cajon by April 1962. Priority was given to planning US 80 in 1962 by the California Chamber of Commerce. In 1964, I-8 was officially designated by the California State Legislature, and the US 80 designation was removed. By 1965, I-8 from Fairmount Avenue to El Cajon Boulevard was one of the first freeway stretches in the county to have a center barrier installed in the median.

The Ocean Beach Freeway section west of I-5 was authorized as Route 286 in 1959. In 1962, four alternate routes were proposed for this part of the freeway, and for Rosecrans Street. Route 286 was renumbered to SR 109 in the 1964 renumbering. Plans for the Old Town interchange between I-5 (formerly US 101), I-8 (formerly US 80), SR 209 (Rosecrans Street), and SR 109 date from 1962, although several concerns had to be taken into account, including the preservation of historical Old Town and keeping traffic through the area moving during construction. The goal was to begin the process in 1966, and complete the interchange in 1969. There were concerns about a $3 million shortfall in funding (about $ in dollars) during May 1966, which caused the San Diego Chamber of Commerce Highway Committee to recommend the completion of SR 109 as a project. This was projected to be the final highway project before I-5 was completed in San Diego County.

The building phase started on September 22, 1966, on the interchange that was to replace the intersection of Pacific Highway and Rosecrans Street. The cost of the interchange was projected to be $10.86 million (about $ in dollars). SR 109 was planned to follow Camino del Rio up to the Frontier traffic circle, where the city of San Diego would resume construction; both SR 109 and SR 209 were to be built in the future. The eight-lane freeway was projected to relieve traffic in the Frontier Street area coming from the San Diego Sports Arena. Bidding for the SR 109 contract was to begin in 1968, after the City Council endorsed the route in December 1967. Completion of both the interchange and SR 109 was planned for early 1969. An interchange was planned at Midway Drive, and the western end of the freeway was to be at Sunset Cliffs and Nimitz boulevards. The cost of the SR 109 project was estimated to be $2.3 million (about $ in dollars).
The ramp from south I-5 to Camino del Rio opened in February 1968, and a second ramp from southbound I-5 to eastbound I-8 opened in August 1968, with the remainder of the project to be completed in summer 1969. The groundbreaking for the Ocean Beach Freeway took place on September 23, 1968, with the estimated completion to take place within 15 months. However, rain in February 1969 delayed many construction projects across the county, including the SR 109 extension. The entire project was completed in September, with the road scheduled to open in October. The routing of SR 109 was officially added to I-8 in 1972.

====Subsequent expansion====
Even before the freeway was complete in California, bidding began in 1964 on widening I-8 from six to eight lanes between near Fairmount Avenue and Spring Street, in San Diego and La Mesa. Three years later, a contract was granted for the widening of the Fairmount Avenue to Ward Road stretch, adding two lanes to the freeway. In 1974, the San Diego City Council reached an agreement with state officials to improve I-8 from east of Pacific Highway to Texas Street, over the objections of Councilman Floyd Morrow, who objected to solving traffic issues by continuing to expand freeways. The cost was estimated to be $8 million (about $ in dollars).

The La Mesa City Council asked the state to modify the interchange with SR 125 in 1974; the original interchange did not allow for access to SR 125 from I-8 east or to I-8 west from SR 125. Widening of the portion from SR 125 to El Cajon Boulevard to five lanes in each direction was under way in October. By 1981, the environmental impact report had been completed, and the $50 million (about $ in dollars) project to add ramps and widen I-8 was awaiting clearance from the Federal Highway Administration. Additional ramps to SR 67 were nearing completion in May 1985, and were completed to I-15 north in October. In 1986, the project revamping the SR 125 interchange was under way, at a cost of $80 million (about $ in dollars); it would add two more lanes to I-8 from Jackson Drive to Fuerte Drive, and allow for SR 125 to be extended north past I-8.

By 1977, traffic had reached 172,300 vehicles a day, which had increased by nearly 10 percent over the previous year. It was hoped that the construction of SR 52 would help to reduce the congestion. A revised Mission Gorge Road eastbound exit opened in 1979, merging with traffic from I-15. Traffic reached 212,000 vehicles a day by February 1981, and Caltrans declared I-8 east of I-805 the busiest highway in the region. In 1987, Caltrans determined that I-8 west between College Avenue and Waring Road had the highest ratio of cars to number of lanes worldwide, at 2400 cars per hour. Plans to add another lane to I-8 west from College Avenue to I-15 began in March 1992.

Caltrans proposed the installation of a metered traffic signal on I-8 west in Lakeside during 1987, in order to improve traffic flow in the mornings by inserting a short delay before entering San Diego should the rate exceed 2,000 vehicles per hour. However, the state put its plans on hold shortly thereafter, following several concerns from the public, and from state senator Jim Ellis.

===Cuyamaca Mountains===
====Early road====
A stagecoach road existed into the 19th century that passed through the mountains east of San Diego. Before the freeway was constructed, the automobile road through the mountains east of San Diego was narrow and wound through the mountains; it was officially dedicated in 1912. This trip was known to take up to four hours, and frequently resulted in the radiator boiling over, flat tires, or broken fan belts; inclement weather would result in cars becoming mired in the mud. The road was paved in 1926, and was open by 1927; remnants of this road were still present in the late 20th century. Another road was built in the early 1930s, to remove curves and widen the lanes. This was a two-lane road that still had many switchbacks, with one popularly known as &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Curve&quot;. Construction of I-8 took place atop much of the roadbed of the highway from the early 1930s. The delay in extending a road to San Diego caused increased development in Los Angeles and resulted in that city becoming the trade and population center of Southern California, according to the &quot;San Diego Union&quot;.

====Planning and construction====
Completion of the freeway was the second highest priority according to the Highway Development Association in May 1963, after the I-5 freeway. Bidding began on the portion from Broadway in El Cajon to Harritt Road in September 1963. This section of the freeway was to parallel US 80 to the south up to Lakeview Road, and then to the north. This portion of the freeway was scheduled to be complete by May 1965. By January 1965, I-8 had been completed from I-5 east to an interchange with Lake Jennings Park Road, just south of the latter&#x27;s intersection with the southern terminus of Harritt Road. At a cost of $3.44 million (about $ in dollars), the project reduced the grade and curves at what was known as &quot;Tunnel Hill&quot; that hindered the flow of traffic. The part of the freeway from west of Harritt Road to west of Alpine was up for bidding in October 1964, and the Highway Commission set aside $2.1 million (about $ in dollars) for this stretch in February 1965. A contract for $1.42 million (about $ in dollars) was issued in August 1965. The entire stretch from Lake Jennings Road to Harbison Canyon Road was under construction by September 1965 and was scheduled to be complete by the next year.

In the Mountain Springs pass between San Diego and Imperial counties, the eastbound lanes traverse the pass on the former roadbed of US 80 through In-Ko-Pah Gorge near Myers Creek. The westbound lanes were placed on a different routing through Devil&#x27;s Canyon that had been constructed by November 1963. A contract for paving the from the San Diego–Imperial county line to SR 98, including the eastbound lanes, was given to the Isbell Construction Company for $3.69 million (about $ in dollars) in May 1963. This portion was completed in May 1965 &quot;through some of the most rugged, hottest sections of San Diego and Imperial counties,&quot; according to &quot;The San Diego Union&quot;. Construction ran into difficulties following concerns regarding potential landslides. The westbound lanes were built first, and temporarily contained both directions of traffic while the old highway was converted into the eastbound lanes. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the stretch east of Mountain Springs as follows: &quot;Through it the freeway engineers have hacked two separate roadways not even in sight of each other, but so overpowering in the sheer magnitude of the cuts through the mountains that it is almost impossible to believe human beings could have so overpowered hostile nature ...&quot; Access to the site for construction workers was difficult, and many slopes had to be stabilized. Temperatures reached in the summer and in winter, with winds reaching up to . While using nuclear explosions to conduct blasting operations in the Laguna Mountains was considered as a possibility, the proposal was not considered to be practical at the time. Two cables and a hook were used to move girders into place; this was the first use of a cable in Southern California road construction.

The portion from Boulevard to near the Imperial County line was included in the California Highway Commission budget for 1965–1966. A extension from Mountain Springs west to what was then known as Road J-35 was given $3.3 million (about $ in dollars) in funding by the Highway Commission in May 1965. The section in between this one and the Mountain Springs pass section was in planning by that September, and was scheduled to begin the building phase shortly thereafter, with the section extending west of Boulevard to follow. That section, from Crestwood to Boulevard, was to begin construction soon after the $3 million (about $ in dollars) contract was given out in January 1966. The coming of the freeway from both west and east of Jacumba was projected to be a significant event in the history of the town. Cafes and gas stations went out of business once the freeway bypassed the town; however, many retirees relocated into the town since the high traffic levels were gone. The labeling of the town Boulevard as Manzanita on I-8 signs raised controversy and forced the Division of Highways to obscure the name on the signs until the issue was resolved.

Construction continued with the issuing of a $6.55 million contract (about $ in dollars) to widen a section of I-8 through Alpine, from Harbison Canyon to east of West Victoria Drive, and to begin construction in April or May 1967, to be completed in 1969. This would leave only a stretch of I-8 that was not at freeway standards. As the process continued, concerns about increased smog from the additional traffic were raised in October 1967. A section to the east of Alpine was scheduled to have bidding opened in November of that year, and was to be finished in 1968; this would produce a continuous freeway from San Diego to the eastern terminus of this route. Both of these projects were underway by May 1968. An additional contract was given out for $7.8 million (about $ in dollars) in August to continue the freeway east from Alpine Street to Japatul Valley Road; this would bring the freeway near Descanso Junction. Roughly of dirt and rock were to be generated by all three of these construction projects, since half of a mountain would have to be removed with a million pounds of dynamite. The third project was built near the site of an abandoned attempt to build a tunnel for the old highway after World War II, which proved to be too expensive.

By mid-February 1969, one segment of the freeway running through Alpine was nearing completion and was scheduled to open on February 21; another section was scheduled to open in April. However, although dirt and rocks were transported on a conveyor belt across US 80 to become part of an embankment for the Sweetwater River Bridge, the grading of the mountain near Viejas Grade and the Sweetwater River had not been completed on the final link. The historic Ellis Grade radiator stop was to be removed and replaced with one at Vista Point. On April 19, 1969, the part east of Alpine opened to traffic. All of the Alpine part of I-8 opened on May 22, 1969, after a ribbon-cutting ceremony; yet the Viejas Grade segment was now projected to be completed by 1972. The bridge over the Sweetwater River was under construction by 1970, and the entire segment cost $22.1 million (about $ in dollars). By May, this segment was estimated to be completed in the later part of that year. The leveling of the grade resulted in the second highest fill in the state at .

====Finishing the freeway====
The final portion of I-8 in California, between Japatul Valley Road and west of Boulevard, was prioritized in the 1969–1970 state budget. Due to financial concerns, it was announced in September 1968 that the target date for completing the Interstate Highway System would be extended until 1974, from 1972. The missing portion of I-8 was expected to cost $45 million and be constructed in three parts, with one part being started each year. The segments between Japatul Valley Road and west of Laguna Junction, and from La Posta Road to west of Boulevard, were delayed for an entire year at the end of 1969 due to a nationwide effort to fight inflation by reducing spending. A segment from Buckman Springs to Crestwood received funding in May 1970, which would leave only an stretch of the freeway uncompleted when built. The drive time from San Diego to El Centro had been reduced to two hours, according to the California Division of Highways. By August 1970, the remainder of the freeway had been funded, with the part from Japatul Valley Road to Laguna Junction costing $22 million (about $ in dollars), and the Laguna Junction to Crestwood portion costing $15 million (about $ in dollars).

In May 1971, El Centro Mayor Alex Gay requested that passing lanes be added to the remaining two-lane part of I-8 in between El Centro and San Diego due to the frequent traffic jams in between Japatul Valley and Crestwood. At this time, this was the only missing link through the mountains. Bidding took place on the $16.5 million (about $ in dollars) La Posta Road to Crestwood Road and the Japatul Valley Road to Sunrise Highway portions in November 1971. As part of this series of projects, the highest concrete bridge in the state at the time was to be built at over Pine Valley Creek on the segment between Japatul Valley Road and Sunrise Highway. The contract came in at $22.6 million (about $ in dollars), over $5 million (about $ in dollars) beyond budget due to the difficulty of the bridge construction. All three of the projects to complete I-8 were projected to be complete by mid-1974. However, in March 1972, it was announced that the La Posta Road portion of the project would be delayed due to budget troubles.

By the beginning of 1974, the new projected completion date for I-8 was mid-1975, with of two-lane highway remaining. The Pine Valley Creek bridge and the segment extending from Japatul Valley Road to Pine Valley was dedicated on November 24, 1974, and was scheduled to open on November 26; this left of freeway to be constructed. The final stretch of I-8 in California, from Sunrise Highway to La Posta Road, was completed in May 1975.

The Buckman Springs rest area opened in January 1979 in eastern San Diego County. In 1987, the first speed limit sign was posted east of El Cajon, the first one in the state; the speed limit on all I-8 east of El Cajon, except for the Mountain Springs Grade portion, was raised similarly.

===Imperial Valley===
====Construction====
The highway through Imperial Valley was originally a plank road made of pieces of wood that were tied together. The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915. Following this, US 80 was built through the valley as the main east–west route. Plans for a new freeway across the southernmost reaches of California date from before 1950. The bridge over the Colorado River was replaced in 1956, at a cost of $1.2 million, and was in use until 1978, when the I-8 bridge was built. In 1957, the City of El Centro expressed a desire for the new freeway to replace US 80 to be routed along the southern limits of the city. Caltrans engineer Jacob Dekema stated at the time that the four-lane freeway would not be constructed on the US 80 routing due to possible expansion of the Naval Air Facility El Centro.

In October 1964, the portion of I-8 between Imperial Avenue in El Centro to SR 111 appeared in the state budget. By December, a route for the part of I-8 just west of the Colorado River was being examined by the California Highway Commission. Construction was underway on the stretch from Seeley to SR 111 by June 1966, and the entire portion through the county was planned for completion by 1968. This portion, extending west to Drew Road, was planned for completion by early 1967, at a cost of $200 million (about $ in dollars); however, by then, the date for completion of the freeway had slipped to 1972. The state ordered the building of the portion from west of Coyote Wells to just east of Drew Road in September 1967. The next year, Dekema indicated that the goal was to have I-8 completed by 1973, citing a deadline in order to have the federal government pay for up to ninety percent of the costs; the other freeways in the region were to be delayed because of this.

In early 1970, the portion of the freeway from west of Ogilby Road to east of Algodones Road was under construction, and projections were to have this portion completed by later that year. This $5.2 million (about $ in dollars) project also included resurfacing the freeway that had already been built through the Colorado Desert Sandhills; this part of the freeway had been built between 1961 and 1965. By this time, it was estimated that the drive from San Diego to El Centro now took 2 hours, as opposed to the 3.5 hours required two decades earlier, and the two days required in the pioneer era. This part of the freeway was opened in July 1970. As the freeway was constructed through the valley, it caused a break in many north–south roads. These breaks were located where access to the part of the road on the other side of the freeway was cut off. Plans were put in place to build frontage roads to improve access through the region.

The portion of I-8 bypassing Holtville began construction in December 1969, and was nearing completion in May 1971, to result in a continuous freeway that connected two existing segments from Crestwood in San Diego County to just west of Winterhaven. It was estimated that the bypass would save travelers 20 minutes of travel time through the Imperial Valley. The cost of this project was $11.2 million (about $ in dollars). However, Holtville residents raised concerns about SR 115 providing the only access to the eastern part of the city, notably the narrow and curved portion leading from the freeway into town. Work on the Holtville portion began at 3:30 a.m. daily during the summer in order to avoid the desert heat. In addition to this, construction of the Highline Canal overpass involved a steel span that was prefabricated and made of girders that were hoisted into position by barges. The Matich Construction Company attempted to set the world record for laying the most concrete in a day, aided by the level terrain, but failed to do so after the concrete mixer malfunctioned. That same year, bids for an Arizona plant inspection station near Winterhaven, next to the California agricultural inspection station, were submitted.

The last part of the California portion, from near Algodones Road to west of the Arizona state line, was to enter the bidding phase in early 1972. I-8 was scheduled to be completed in the summer of 1975 between San Diego and Yuma, although there would be a break in the freeway around Yuma; this occurred by October 1975. At the time the California portion was completed, it was the preferred route to Phoenix from some areas of Los Angeles, since I-10 had not been completed.

The missing portion of the highway was the new bridge over the Colorado River, which was built at a cost of $7.4 million (about $ in dollars). In June 1975, there were concerns regarding the state delaying new construction projects due to financial concerns, and the effects this would have on the bridge. The bid for the project was awarded to Novo-Rados Construction in October 1975, as one of the final projects before the construction freeze. The new bridge, which replaced the old US 80 bridge, was dedicated on August 18, 1978; this completed I-8 from San Diego to Casa Grande. The Arizona Department of Transportation and the City of Yuma assisted in the planning process. By the time the California portion of the freeway was complete, the average cost was $1 million per mile (about $ in dollars). The bridge opened on September 20, 1978. The State of California was responsible for the bridge erection, even though the State of Arizona owned half of the bridge.

====Fratianno allegations====
Jimmy Fratianno was associated with Frank Bompensiero, the San Diego mafia leader, in a criminal lawsuit involving the Fratianno Trucking Company and the Miles and Sons Trucking Company in 1966; he was known to law enforcement as &quot;the Mafia&#x27;s West Coast executioner,&quot; with up to 16 deaths for which he was potentially responsible. Both companies were awarded the contracts to transport dirt during the construction of I-8 in El Centro. Drivers were coerced to agree to buy the trucks, although the Fratianno Company still retained the ownership; they also had portions of their wages withheld from them. Following this, the drivers were loaned money from Leo Moceri, another mafia leader. An investigation in early 1966 after complaints from the drivers led to state charges against the two firms as well as five people in August. There were concerns that John Erreca, the state director of public works, had a conflict of interest with Fratianno and did not enforce the law; however, both Transportation Administrator Robert Bradford (upon a request for investigation from then Governor Pat Brown) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation found that there was no conflict of interest.

The truck drivers were given $36,000 (about $ in dollars) in back pay from the state government. Fratianno and Bompensiero were charged with fraud, as well as state labor and public utility code violations. While charges were dropped against Bompensiero, Fratianno was found guilty. The Imperial County Board of Supervisors estimated that $25,000 (about $ in dollars) in damage to county roads took place due to overloaded trucks. The federal government fined him $10,000 (about $ in dollars), which he never paid, and placed him on probation for three years; he was imprisoned when he did not pay, but was released in September 1969. His ex-wife, Jewell, as well as the company, were fined $4,014 (about $ in dollars) individually for their responsibility in the matter. For the state charges, he was sentenced in 1969 to one to three years in prison, after pleading guilty to the charges. He was incarcerated in Chico State Prison following a parole violation until 1973.

====Storm damage====
Following Tropical Storm Kathleen in September 1976, a flood eroded 400 pieces of the roadway from westbound I-8 near Ocotillo, resulting in the construction of a detour. The freeway reopened to traffic in February 1978 after the damage was repaired and a new bridge was built, at a cost of $1 million (about $ in dollars). But, in 1982, the freeway was closed again near Ocotillo due to flooding following another storm.

===Arizona===
Between Yuma and Gila Bend, I-8 runs alongside the routes of both the Gila Trail and the Butterfield Overland Mail Company line. The latter was a stagecoach line that went between Tipton, Missouri, and San Francisco, with several stations in between, and was used to transport passengers across the country at between 1858 and 1861. In later years, the Southern Pacific Railroad was constructed, paralleling the Gila River east of Fortuna; by 1877, the tracks were complete to Yuma. Work continued the next year, and, by 1880, the tracks were extended to Tucson from Yuma.

This portion of the route of US 80, predecessor of I-8, was originally part of the proposed state system of highways in 1921. By 1926, this section became part of the cross-country highway US 80. The route was not paved at this time, but was a gravel road along the entire corridor. By 1928, the portion of I-8 between Gila Bend and Casa Grande was designated as SR 84. A small portion of the highway was paved near Yuma and SR 84 was under construction by the next year. SR 84 was completed by 1930, but not paved, and the segment of US 80 between Aztec and Sentinel had been paved.

Paving of SR 84 had commenced by 1934, with the portion of the highway in Maricopa County being paved. A group of San Diego citizens raised concerns about the road from Yuma to Gila Bend not being paved in 1934, due to the impact that this would have on tourism in San Diego, and made a request to the federal government to have it paved. The entire future corridor of I-8 had been paved from Yuma to Casa Grande by 1935. Drivers were told to bring spare fan belts, radiator hoses, and additional drinking water for the journey traversing the desert. A &quot;Shortcuts Association&quot; began in 1952 to promote SR 84 as a route to bypass Phoenix on the way to San Diego.

With the coming of the Interstate Highways, the corridor was to be upgraded to Interstate standards. In late 1958, a group of motel owners whose properties were located on SR 84 strongly objected to any routing of I-8 that would not go through the city of Casa Grande. Motel owners in Yuma proposed their own alternative in 1961 to the four routings of I-8 through the city that had been proposed, raising concerns about losing revenue from tourism. In January 1962, the alternatives were narrowed down to two, with one of them being the route supported by the motel owners. However, nearby school officials expressed concerns regarding that route, because 1200 students would no longer be able to walk to school if the freeway was constructed along that route. Later that year, a new route had been proposed, along the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks and the Colorado River. Construction was completed on the first sections of I-8 in Arizona in 1958. The first section was long, which included a grade-separated interchange south of the Painted Rock Petroglyph Site. The second section, which was in length, also included a grade separated interchange at Aztec, just east of Dateland. The interchange at Sentinel, and the section between Aztec and the Maricopa County line, which included the construction of another interchange, were both completed in 1959. The initial construction was divided into four different sections awarded to different contractors. Work commenced with a section of US 80 between Sentinel and Gila Bend on December 10, 1960. This was also the section of I-8 completed in Arizona on April 18, 1962. By 1963, work was well under way, with portions of US 80 between Mohawk and Gila Bend, and SR 84 between Gila Bend and near Stanfield upgraded. Other merchants objected to the routing, and met with the Yuma County Board of Supervisors to raise their concerns following the final approval of the route in 1964. A new park was to be built east of the Colorado River crossing, just opposite downtown; city officials hoped that this would give an improved look to the town as drivers first arrived.

Nevertheless, there was controversy over the work in Arizona as well. In 1964, a U.S. House of Representatives investigation discovered that poor management and lack of efficiency were prevalent in four of the projects constructing the I-8 freeway. The Arizona Highway Department was specifically cited in the report for not taking into account protecting government interests when selecting labor for the projects. Several errors were discovered, and one of them, adding too much clay to the gravel mixture, cost the state of Arizona $26,278 (about $ in dollars) to fix. By that year, construction had begun on the freeway west of Casa Grande, while the rest of the Arizona routing was in the design stages.

In 1965, a $1.46 million (about $ in dollars) contract was granted to build the portion from near Araby Road east through Fortuna Wash. Two years later, it was estimated that construction would be complete by 1969, except for the Colorado River bridge. The highway was in progress through the Telegraph Pass east of Yuma, and the portions from Avenue 9-E to 4-E, from there to 4th Street in Yuma, and to the river were estimated to cost $9.69 million (about $ in dollars) in total. Following local complaints, Francis Turner, the executive director of the federal Bureau of Public Roads, agreed to look at constructing an interchange at Trekell Road in Casa Grande again, after an earlier decline to do so. Work began on the Casa Grande part of the freeway in March 1968, at a cost of $3 million (about $ in dollars). That year, many gas station, motel, and restaurant owners noticed a drop in business, possibly due to concerns regarding construction traffic due to I-8; however, they hoped for increased business following completion of the freeway. The Yuma County Chamber of Commerce made plans to promote tourism in the town following the completion of I-8 by late 1968.

Bidding on the last portion of the freeway to be completed in Casa Grande, from Midway Road to I-10, was to begin in January 1969. By November, the freeway east of Yuma was under construction, at a cost of $3.7 million (about $ in dollars). On June 15, 1970, eastbound traffic began on I-8 in Casa Grande, with an exit at both Trekell and Thorton roads, with westbound traffic soon to follow. Businesses did not notice much change with the opening of the eastbound lanes. In 1971, I-8 was nearly complete, including a new alignment east of Yuma built parallel and to the south of the original US 80 alignment. A new alignment was also built to the south of the SR 84 alignment at the eastern end of the highway from southwest of Stanfield to the eastern terminus at I‑10 southeast of Casa Grande. The only portions of I-8 not completed at this time were the Gila Bend bypass and the western end near Yuma. The portion east of 16th Street in Yuma was completed in June 1972; the Arizona State Highway Commission authorized the $1.6 million (about $ in dollars) contract to construct the portion through Gila Bend in August. Some Yuma businesses had noticed a decrease in revenue at this time; the Arizona Highway Department agreed to modify some signs to eliminate any confusion. The part of I-8 between 16th and 4th streets was under construction in 1976, which was the only incomplete part of the freeway, along with the bridge over the Colorado River. The water treatment plant in Yuma was to be moved due to the potential of an accident with a vehicle carrying hazardous materials flying off the bridge and contaminating the water supply. The freeway in both states was completed with the opening of the bridge on September 20, 1978.

As the Interstate was completed, the highways that it replaced were removed from the state highway system. In 1973, the SR 84 designation was removed from the highway from Gila Bend to the split where I-8 followed a new alignment southwest of Stanfield. In 1977, the US 80 designation was removed from this stretch in favor of I-8.

==Exit list==




































==Auxiliary routes==
There are no three-digit auxiliary routes of I-8. However, there are four signed business routes related to I-8 that provide additional access to particular towns or cities:
*El Cajon Boulevard passes through downtown El Cajon.
*The El Centro business loop runs along Adams Avenue in downtown El Centro.
*The Winterhaven–Yuma business loop begins in Winterhaven before crossing the Colorado River into Yuma and providing access to the downtown area, ending in eastern Yuma.
*The Gila Bend business loop connects with Arizona State Route 85.

<doc id="86028" wikidata="Q626770" url="?curid=86028" title="Arawn">
<text>In Welsh mythology, Arawn () was the king of the otherworld realm of Annwn who appears prominently in the first branch of the Mabinogi, and alluded to in the fourth. In later tradition, the role of the king of Annwn was largely attributed to the Welsh psychopomp, Gwyn ap Nudd - meaning &quot;white&quot; (i.e. &#x27;winter&#x27;) a possible kenning for his true name. However, Arawn&#x27;s memory is retained in a traditional saying found in an old Cardigan folktale:

:&quot;Hir yw&#x27;r dydd a hir yw&#x27;r nos, a hir yw aros Arawn&quot; &quot;Long is the day and long is the night, and long is the waiting of Arawn&quot;

The name &quot;Arawn&quot; is derived from that of the biblical prophet Aaron.

Arawn&#x27;s association with the hunt, hornes and the Otherworld has prompted some scholars to associate Arawn with the continental Gaulish god Cernunnos.

==Role in Welsh tradition==

===The Four Branches===

In the &quot;First Branch of the Mabinogi&quot;, Pwyll mistakenly stumbles into the realm of Annwn and finds white hounds with red ears feeding on a stag. Pwyll chases the hounds off, only to learn that the hounds belonged to Arawn, ruler of Annwn. To pay for the misdeed, Arawn asks Pwyll to trade places with him for a year and a day and defeat Hafgan, Arawn&#x27;s rival, at the end of this time, something Arawn has attempted but has been unable to do. Arawn, meanwhile, takes Pwyll&#x27;s place as lord of Dyfed. Arawn and Pwyll become good friends because when Pwyll wore Arawn&#x27;s shape, he did not sleep with Arawn&#x27;s wife.

A friendship between the two realms is retained long after Pwyll&#x27;s death; in the fourth branch, Pryderi, Pwyll&#x27;s son and lord of Dyfed has received a gift of otherworldly pigs from Arawn. These pigs are eventually stolen by a Venedotian magician and trickster, Gwydion fab Don. Gwydion poses as a bard, and asks to be rewarded for his poems and music with the pigs Pryderi owned. According to Pryderi, he is still in a pact with Arawn and cannot give the pigs to anyone. Gwydion then tricks Pryderi into trading him the pigs (as that is allowed in the deal with Arawn), which eventually leads to Pryderi&#x27;s invasion of Gwynedd. In the ensuing war, Gwydion kills Pryderi in single combat.

While Arawn is noticeably missing from the Second through Fourth branches of the Mabinogi, some scholars claim this is due to the missing portions of the original text and that Arawn and the events of the First Branch of the Mabinogi directly lead to the birth of Pwyll&#x27;s son Pryderi. The reasoning behind the birth of Pryderi having been a result of Pwyll and Arawn&#x27;s meeting being missing from the original text is because while a quarter of the Mabinogi is spent talking about the mystical Otherworld of Annwn, but it is not mentioned in the other branches of the Mabinogi. Other scholars disagree with this idea, as many of these newer translations create more problems within the story and do not ground themselves in the Llyfr Gwyn, from which the Mabinogi was translated.

====Influence within the Mabinogion====

While Arawn is integral to the First Branch of the Mabinogi, his character seems to be more of a reinforcer of the lore behind Pwyll (and potentially Pryderi) than a character that directly impacts the story of the later Mabinogi Branches. The mysticism that is involved within the entirety of the Mabinogi is first shown when Arawn and Pwyll switch bodies for a year.

===Other legends===

In Welsh folklore, the Cŵn Annwn or &quot;Hounds of Annwn&quot; ride through the skies in autumn, winter, and early spring. The baying of the hounds was identified with the crying of wild geese as they migrate and the quarry of the hounds as wandering spirits, being chased to Annwn. However, Arawn himself is not referred to in these traditions. Later the myth was Christianised to describe the &quot;capturing of human souls and the chasing of damned souls to Annwn&quot;, and Annwn was equated with the &quot;Hell&quot; of Christian tradition.

Some writers, notably Robert Graves, have written of an incident in which Amaethon steals a dog, lapwing and a white roebuck from Arawn, leading to the Cad Goddeu (Battle of the Trees), which Arawn lost to Amaethon and his brother, Gwydion. The standard text of &#x27;Cad Goddeu&#x27; in the Book of Taliesin makes no mention of this, but the Welsh Triads records the Battle of Goddeu as one of the &quot;Three Futile Battles of the Island of Britain...it was brought about by the cause of the bitch, together with the roebuck and the plover&quot;, while Lady Charlotte Guest notes in her &quot;Mabinogion&quot; an account in the Myvyrian Archaeology that the battle &quot;was on account of a white roebuck and a whelp; and they came from Hell, and Amathaon ab Don brought them. And therefore Amathaon ab Don, and Arawn, King of Annwn (Hell), fought. And there was a man in that battle, unless his name were known he could not be overcome; and there was on the other side a woman called Achren, and unless her name were known her party could not be overcome. And Gwydion ab Don guessed the name of the man&quot;.

Rankie and d&#x27;Este (2007) note that Arawn could be the father of Modron, as the tale of the Ford of Barking recounts Modron&#x27;s father as &quot;the King of Annwn.&quot;

===Influences on other literary works===

In the Arthurian story &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, the interplay of Gawain, his host Bertilak (who is actually The Green Knight), and Bertilak&#x27;s wife are very similar to the events of Pwyll and Arawn&#x27;s encounter. In this case, Arawn seems to have been used as a basis for Bertilak/The Green Knight, while Gawain was very similar to Pwyll. The parallel between the Green Knight and Arawn extends to the treatment of the &quot;newcomer.&quot; In both stories the Knight/Arawn&#x27;s wife tries to sleep with the newcomer, but both remain loyal to the Knight/Arawn. In both stories as a result of their faithfulness, the newcomer is rewarded with the favor of the Knight/Arawn.

The character of Arawn Death-Lord in the series &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot; by Lloyd Alexander is based on King Arawn from the Mabinogi. However, many of the characters traits are altered within these books, as Arawn is depicted as an evil ruler. The stories still retain the idea that he is king of the Otherworld, and that he is in a struggle to take over the land from another king. In this story Arawn is defeated by his foes instead of taking over his kingdom like in the Mabinogi.

In Brut y Brenhennidd, a Welsh translation of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s Historia regum Britanniae, Arawn vab Kynvarch is listed as the King of &quot;Ysgotlont&quot; (Scotland), up the role filled by Anguselus in Geoffrey&#x27;s version, being first made king by Uther Pendragon and then showing up when Arthur holds his court at Caerleon, and otherwise acting as an ally of Arthur&#x27;s, sending troops on his campaigns against the Romans.

===Name===
A cleric of the Old Welsh name Araun witnessed two charters of 860 preserved in the Book of Llandaf. However, his association with the hunt has prompted some scholars to associate Arawn with the Gaulish god Cernunnos.

Despite the number, this is an east–west highway; the &#x27;H&#x27;-series (for Hawaii) numbering reflects the order in which routes were funded and built. H-1 goes from Route 93 (Farrington Highway) in Kapolei to Route 72 (Kalanianaole Highway) in Kāhala. East of Middle Street in Honolulu (exit 19A), H-1 is also known as the Lunalilo Freeway, after the former Hawaiian king, and is sometimes signed as such at older signs in central Honolulu. West of Middle Street, H-1 is also known as the Queen Liliʻuokalani Freeway, after the former Hawaiian queen; this name is shown on some roadmaps. It is both the southernmost and westernmost signed Interstate Highway located in the US.

==Route description==

H-1 begins near the Campbell Industrial Park in the town of Kapolei. West of this point, Route 93 (Farrington Highway) continues toward Waianae. The freeway continues east, passing the community of Makakilo until reaching the junction with Route 750 (north to Kunia Camp) and Route 76 (south to ʻEwa Beach).

H-1 then continues along the northern edge of Waipahu approximately until its junction with H-2. It then continues east through the towns of Pearl City and Aiea for approximately to the complex Halawa Interchange, where it meets H-3 and H-201. The highway then turns south for , then east soon after the exits for Hickam Air Force Base and Pearl Harbor. At this point, the highway runs along a viaduct above Route 92 (Nimitz Highway), passing to the north of Daniel K. Inouye International Airport.
 past the airport exit, three lanes exit the freeway at exit 18A to join Nimitz Highway toward Waikiki, while, half a mile () later, the remaining two lanes make a sharp turn south as H-1 reaches another major interchange with the east end of H-201. Access is provided by a left exit from H-1 east only. H-1 west does not have access to H-201 at this point.

From here, H-1 runs through the city of Honolulu along a series of underpasses and viaducts. A flyover interchange leading to Downtown Honolulu has a westbound exit and an eastbound entrance. H-1 ends in the Kāhala district of Honolulu near Kahala Mall, where Route 72 (Kalanianaole Highway) ends.

During morning commute hours on weekdays, an eastbound contraflow express lane is deployed from just east of exit 5 to exit 18A, where it connects to the beginning of the Nimitz Highway contraflow lane. The H-1 contraflow lane is often referred to as a &quot;zipper lane&quot; due to the use of a movable concrete barrier and a zipper machine. The H-1 and Nimitz Highway contraflow lanes are restricted to buses, motorcycles, and high-occupancy vehicles with two or more occupants while in operation.

==History==

A set of Interstate Highways serving Oʻahu were authorized by the federal government in 1960, a year after Hawaii was admitted as a state. One of the corridors, connecting Barbers Point to Diamond Head, was designated as H-1 by the Bureau of Public Roads (now the Federal Highway Administration) on August 29, 1960. The portion of H-1 that runs through Downtown Honolulu had opened in 1953 as the Mauka Arterial and was incorporated into the new freeway. This section has been largely unchanged since its inception and its design suffers from having too many on/offramps, short distanced onramps, and onramps that enter the freeway almost immediately before an offramp (opposite of current design standards). The &#x27;new&#x27; section of H-1 was, however, built to contemporary freeway standards.

Construction on the first new section of H-1 began in 1963, shortly after alignments were approved for most of the freeway. The Lunalilo Freeway, already planned by the state government and funded with a 50-percent match from the federal government, was incorporated into plans for H-1 in 1965 following the rejection of five other proposed routings. The westernmost section of H-1 in Makakilo opened on September 29, 1966. The Kapiolani Interchange, opened in October 1967, filled a gap between two sections of the Lunalilo Freeway spanning in Honolulu. Another gap in H-1 was filled in March 1969 with the opening of between Kunia Road (Route 76) and the Waiawa Interchange with H-2.

The Hawaiian Interstate shields have gone through several changes. Early shields contained the hyphen as per the official designation (e.g., H-1); however, these shields have been updated with the hyphen removed (e.g., H1). As in other states across the contiguous US, early Interstate shields also included the writing of &#x27;Hawaii&#x27; above the Interstate route number and below the &#x27;Interstate&#x27; writing. While the &quot;Queen Liliʻuokalani&quot; section of H-1 has signs designating it as such (one eastbound at exit 1, the other westbound after exit 19), there are no similar name signs for the Lunalilo Freeway portion (the remainder of the freeway).

==Interstate H-4==
In the 1960s, a fourth freeway that would have been Interstate H-4 (H-4) was proposed for the city of Honolulu. The intent of H-4 was to provide relief to the congested H-1 through Downtown Honolulu. Had it been built, the route of H-4 would have started at exit 18 (H-1/Nimitz Highway interchange) and followed the Honolulu waterfront to the Kapiolani interchange (exit 25B). The idea, however, was unpopular and the freeway was never built.

<text>Pwyll Pen Annwn () is a prominent figure in Welsh mythology and literature, the lord of Dyfed, husband of Rhiannon and father of the hero Pryderi. With a name meaning &quot;wisdom&quot;, he is the eponymous hero of Pwyll Pendefig Dyfed, the first branch of the Four Branches of the Mabinogi, and also appears briefly as a member of Arthur&#x27;s court in the medieval tale &quot;Culhwch ac Olwen&quot;. &quot;Pwyll, Prince of Dyfed&quot; also carries many similarities to the Mabinogi Branwen.

==Origin of &quot;Pwyll, Prince of Dyfed&quot;==

This tale is one of a group found in &quot;The Mabinogion&quot;, one of the earliest known efforts to form a collection of traditional Welsh tales. Such tales, which date back to circa 1325 A.D., were originally passed from person to person and generation to generation orally. The Celtic oral tradition lasted for several centuries and is a possible reason for the abundance of errors and discrepancies found in &quot;The Mabinogion&quot; as well as other Welsh literature dating back to the fourteenth century or earlier. Professor Sioned Davies of Cardiff University explains the importance of the Celtic oral tradition, in appreciating Welsh literature, this way; &quot;The Mabinogion were tales to be read aloud to a listening audience--the parchment was &quot;interactive&quot; and vocality was of its essence. Indeed, many passages can only be truly captured by the speaking voice.&quot;

==Pwyll, Prince of Dyfed==

While hunting in Glyn Cuch, Pwyll, prince of Dyfed becomes separated from his companions and stumbles across a pack of hounds feeding on a slain stag. Pwyll drives the hounds away and sets his own hounds to feast, earning the anger of Arawn, lord of the otherworldly kingdom of Annwn. In recompense, Pwyll agrees to taking on Arawn&#x27;s appearance and trade places with him for a year and a day, and takes his place at Arawn&#x27;s court. At the end of the year, Pwyll engages in single combat against Hafgan, Arawn&#x27;s rival, and mortally wounds him with one blow, earning Arawn overlordship of all of Annwn. After Hafgan&#x27;s death, Pwyll and Arawn meet once again, revert to their old appearance and return to their respective courts. They become lasting friends because Pwyll slept chastely with Arawn&#x27;s wife for the duration of the year. As a result of Pwyll&#x27;s successful ruling of Annwn, he earns the title ; &#x27;Pwyll, head of Annwn&#x27;.

Some time later, Pwyll and his noblemen ascend the mound of Gorsedd Arberth and witness the arrival of Rhiannon, appearing to them as a beautiful woman dressed in gold silk brocade and riding a shining white horse. Pwyll sends his best horsemen after her, but she always remains ahead of them, though her horse never does more than amble. After three days, Pwyll, himself, rides out to meet her and when he cannot catch her, he calls out to her in desperation. Only then does Rhiannon stop. She tells him her name and that she has come seeking him because she would rather marry him than her fiancé, Gwawl ap Clud. She tells him to come to her kingdom one year from that day, with his soldiers, and they will marry. A year after their meeting, Pwyll arrives as promised but accidentally and foolishly promises his beloved Rhiannon to Gwawl (her previous fiancé). This occurs when Gwawl enters the court extremely distraught and sues for a favor of the king. Gwawl plays to the nobility and generosity of Pwyll, as well as his rashness and passion, and Pwyll tells Gwawl that whatever it is that he should ask him, that he (Pwyll) would give it to him. Gwawl of course asks for his fiancée, Rhiannon, which Pwyll, due to his naive promise, could not refuse. It is decided that they should all come back to the kingdom in one year&#x27;s time for yet another wedding. (Pwyll and Rhiannon were not yet married the first time, the festivities had simply begun but no marriage ceremony had occurred.) Rhiannon devises a plan by which Pwyll might win her back from Gwawl. Pwyll enters the festivities of Gwawl and Rhiannon&#x27;s wedding dressed as a beggar and asks Gwawl for a bag full of food. Gwawl nobly consents but is tricked when Pwyll forces Gwawl inside the bag and he and his men begin to beat him brutally. Gwawl finally gives in so long as Pwyll will spare his life. Pwyll agrees, having managed to win back Rhiannon through the deceiving and dishonoring of Gwawl.

The men of the land were worried that there would not be an heir to follow Pwyll and advised him to take a second wife. He set a date where this would happen, but before long Rhiannon gave birth to a boy. On the night of his birth, the boy was lost while under the care of six of Rhiannon&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting. Scared of the punishment, the ladies smear dog&#x27;s blood onto a sleeping Rhiannon, claiming that she had committed infanticide and cannibalism through eating and &quot;destroying&quot; her child.

Word traveled throughout the land and the nobles requested Pwyll to divorce his wife. But since it was proven that Rhiannon could have children and produce an heir, he did not want to divorce her, rather have her punished for her wrongdoings by the courts. Rhiannon finally decide to accept the punishment given to her. This punishment was to sit outside the city&#x27;s gates at the mounting block and tell everyone her story for seven years. She also had to offer to carry all guests up to the city on her back for payment of her crimes. This was to be her punishment for her accused crimes of eating her child.

At the same time, Teyrnon, the lord of Gwent Is Coed, had a mare which produced a foal every year but would disappear the night it was born. To solve this problem, he brought the mare into his house and kept watch over it throughout the night. As soon as the colt was born, a great claw came through the window and grabbed the colt. Teyrnon cut off the arm and kept the colt but heard a roar outside and found a baby boy. He and his wife claimed the boy as their own and named him Gwri Wallt Euryn (English: &quot;Gwri of the Golden hair&quot;), for &quot;all the hair on his head was as yellow as gold&quot;. The child grew to adulthood at a superhuman pace and, as he matured, his likeness to Pwyll grew more obvious and, eventually, Teyrnon realised Gwri&#x27;s true identity. The boy was eventually reunited with Pwyll and Rhiannon and was renamed , meaning &#x27;anxiety&#x27; or &#x27;care&#x27;.

The tale ends with Pwyll&#x27;s death and Pryderi&#x27;s ascension to the throne.

==Role in Welsh mythology and English literature==

The stories of Pwyll greatly influenced the literature and story-telling of England, Ireland and Wales. The oral tradition of the Celts along with the highly fluid nature of society (caused by nearly constant conquest from circa 50 B.A.D. to circa 1500 A.D.) aided in the promiscuous Welsh literary tradition. Shadows of Pwyll&#x27;s story-lines can be seen in the early Irish tale &quot;Fled Bricrend&quot;, which in turn greatly influenced the Gawain poet. Shared themes include: &quot;ritualized competitions between two noblemen to win the hand of a lady; ritualized missions or &#x27;errands,&#x27; always involving some request; battles in which the combatants are pledged to return to the same place in exactly one year&#x27;s time; elaborate tricks in which the participants make similar arrangements; repeated chains of events in which the supernatural figures prominently.&quot;

<text>Rhiannon () is a major figure in Welsh mythology, appearing in the First Branch of the Mabinogi, and again in the Third Branch. Ronald Hutton called her &quot;one of the great female personalities in World literature&quot;, adding that &quot;there is in fact, nobody quite like her in previous human literature&quot;. In the Mabinogi, Rhiannon is a strong-minded Otherworld woman, who chooses Pwyll, prince of Dyfed (west Wales), as her consort, in preference to another man to whom she has already been betrothed. She is intelligent, politically strategic, beautiful, and famed for her wealth and generosity. With Pwyll she has a son, the hero Pryderi, who later inherits the lordship of Dyfed. She endures tragedy when her newborn child is abducted, and she is accused of infanticide. As a widow she marries Manawydan of the British royal family, and has further adventures involving enchantments.

Like some other figures of British/Welsh literary tradition, Rhiannon may be a reflection of an earlier Celtic deity. Her name appears to derive from the reconstructed Brittonic form *&quot;Rīgantonā&quot;, a derivative of *&quot;rīgan-&quot; &quot;queen&quot; (cf. Welsh &quot;rhiain&quot; &#x27;maiden&#x27;, Old Irish &quot;rígain&quot; &#x27;queen&#x27;). In the First Branch of the Mabinogi, Rhiannon is strongly associated with horses, and so is her son Pryderi. She is often considered to be related to the Gaulish horse goddess Epona. She and her son are often depicted as mare and foal. Like Epona, she sometimes sits on her horse in a calm, stoic way. This connection with Epona is generally accepted among scholars of the Mabinogi and Celtic studies, but Ronald Hutton, a historian of paganism, is skeptical.

==Rhiannon&#x27;s story==
===&quot;Y Mabinogi&quot;: First Branch===
Rhiannon first appears at Gorsedd Arberth, an ancestral mound near one of the chief courts of Dyfed. Pwyll, the prince of Dyfed, has accepted the challenge of the mound&#x27;s magical tradition to show a marvel or deal out blows. Rhiannon appears to him and his court as the promised marvel. She is a beautiful woman arrayed in gold silk brocade, riding a shining white horse. Pwyll sends his best horsemen after her two days running, but she always remains ahead of them, though her horse never does more than amble. On the third day he finally follows her himself and does no better, until he finally appeals to her to stop for him.

Rhiannon characteristically rebukes him for not considering this course before, then explains she has sought him out to marry him, in preference to her current betrothed, Gwawl ap Clud. Pwyll gladly agrees, but at their wedding feast at her father&#x27;s court, an unknown man requests Pwyll grant a request; which he does without asking what it is. The man is Gwawl, and he requests Rhiannon.

Rhiannon rebukes Pwyll a second time for his rash promise, but provides the means and the plan to salvage the situation. She holds a second wedding feast for Gwawl, where she deploys Pwyll&#x27;s men outside in the orchard. She instructs Pwyll to enter the hall dressed as a beggar and humbly request Gwawl fill a certain &#x27;small bag&#x27; with food. But she has enchanted the &#x27;small bag&#x27; so it cannot ever be filled by normal means. Gwawl is persuaded to step in it to control its magic, which means Pwyll can trap him in it. Pwyll&#x27;s men rush in and surround the hall, then beat and kick Gwawl as the Badger-in-the-Bag game. To save his life Gwawl is forced to relinquish Rhiannon completely, and also his revenge. Rhiannon marries Pwyll, then journeys to Dyfed as its queen.

After a happy two years, Pwyll comes under pressure from his nobles, to provide an heir. He refuses to set Rhiannon aside as barren, and in the third year their son is born. However, on the night of his birth, the newborn disappears while in the care of Rhiannon&#x27;s six sleepy maids. Terrified of being put to death, the women kill a puppy and smear its blood on Rhiannon&#x27;s sleeping face. In the morning they accuse her of infanticide and cannibalism. Rhiannon takes counsel with her own advisers, and offers to undergo a penance. Pwyll is again urged to set her aside, but refuses, and sets her penance instead. She must sit every day by the gate of the castle at the horse block, to tell her story to travelers. She must also offer to carry them on her back as a beast of burden, though few accept this. However, as the end of the story shows, Pwyll maintains her state as his queen, as she still sits at his side in the hall at feasting time.

The newborn child is discovered by Teyrnon, the lord of Gwent-Is-Coed (South-Eastern Wales). He is a horse lord whose fine mare foals every May Eve, but the foals go missing each year. He takes the mare into his house and sits vigil with her. After her foal is born he sees a monstrous claw trying to take the newborn foal through the window, so he slashes at the monster with his sword. Rushing outside he finds the monster gone, and a human baby left by the door. He and his wife claim the boy as their own naming him Gwri Wallt Euryn (Gwri of the Golden Hair), for &quot;all the hair on his head was as yellow as gold&quot;. The child grows at a superhuman pace with a great affinity for horses. Teyrnon who once served Pwyll as a courtier, recognises the boy&#x27;s resemblance to his father. As an honourable man, he returns the boy to the Dyfed royal house.

Reunited with Rhiannon the child is formally named in the traditional way via his mother&#x27;s first direct words to him a wordplay on &quot;delivered&quot; and &quot;worry&quot;, &quot;care&quot;, or &quot;loss&quot;. In due course Pwyll dies, and Pryderi rules Dyfed, marrying Cigfa of Gloucester, and amalgamating the seven cantrefs of Morgannwg to his kingdom.

===&quot;Y Mabinogi&quot;: Third Branch===
Pryderi returns from the disastrous Irish wars as one of the only Seven Survivors. Manawydan is another Survivor, and his good comrade and friend. They perform their duty of burying the dead king of Britain&#x27;s head in London (Bran the Blessed) to protect Britain from invasion. But in their long time away, the kingship of Britain has been usurped by Manawydan&#x27;s nephew Caswallon.

Manawydan declines to make more war to reclaim his rights. Pryderi recompenses him generously by giving him the use of the land of Dyfed, though he retains the sovereignty. Pryderi also arranges a marriage between the widowed Rhiannon and Manawydan, who take to each other with affection and respect. Pryderi is careful to pay homage for Dyfed to the usurper Caswallon to avert his hostility.

Manawydan now becomes the lead character in the Third Branch, and it is commonly named after him. With Rhiannon, Pryderi and Cigfa, he sits on the Gorsedd Arberth as Pwyll had once done. But this time disaster ensues. Thunder and magical mist descend on the land leaving it empty of all domesticated animals and all humans apart from the four protagonists.

After a period of living by hunting the four travel to borderland regions (now in England) and make a living at skilled crafts. In three different cities they build successful businesses making saddles, shields, then shoes. But vicious competition puts their lives at risk. Rather than fight as Pryderi wishes, Manawydan opts to quietly move on. Returning to Dyfed, Manawydan and Pryderi go hunting and follow a magical white boar, to a newly built tower. Against Manawydan&#x27;s advice, Pryderi enters it to fetch his hounds. He is trapped by a beautiful golden bowl. Manawydan returns to Rhiannon who rebukes him sharply for failing to even try to rescue his good friend. But her attempt to rescue her son suffers the same fate as he did. In a &quot;blanket of mist&quot;, Rhiannon, Pryderi and the tower vanish.

Manawydan eventually redeems himself by achieving restitution for Rhiannon, Pryderi, and the land of Dyfed. This involves a quasi-comical set of magical negotiations about a pregnant mouse. The magician Llwyd ap Cilcoed is forced to release both land and family from his enchantments, and never attack Dyfed again. His motive is revealed as vengeance for his friend Gwawl, Rhiannon&#x27;s rejected suitor. All ends happily with the family reunited, and Dyfed restored.

==Interpretation as a goddess==
When Rhiannon first appears she is a mysterious figure arriving as part of the Otherworld tradition of Gorsedd Arberth. Her paradoxical style of riding slowly, yet unreachably, is strange and magical, though the paradox also occurs in mediaeval love poetry as an erotic metaphor. Rhiannon produces her &quot;small bag&quot; which is also a magical paradox for it cannot be filled by any ordinary means. When undergoing her penance, Rhiannon demonstrates the powers of a giantess, or the strength of a horse, by carrying travellers on her back.

Rhiannon is connected to three mystical birds. The Birds of Rhiannon (Adar Rhiannon) appear in the Second Branch, in the Triads of Britain, and in Culhwch ac Olwen. In the latter, the giant Ysbaddaden demands them as part of the bride price of his daughter. They are described as &quot;they that wake the dead and lull the living to sleep.&quot; This possibly suggests Rhiannon is based on an earlier goddess of Celtic polytheism.

W. J. Gruffydd&#x27;s book &quot;Rhiannon&quot; (1953) was an attempt to reconstruct the original story. It is mainly focused on the relationship between the males in the story, and rearranges the story elements too liberally for other scholars&#x27; preference, though his research is otherwise detailed and helpful. Patrick Ford suggests that the Third Branch &quot;preserves the detritus of a myth wherein the Sea God mated with the Horse Goddess.&quot; He suggests &quot;the mythic significance may well have been understood in a general way by an eleventh century audience.&quot; Similar euhemerisms of pre-Christian deities can be found in other medieval Celtic literature, when Christian scribes and redactors reworked older deities as more acceptable giants, heroes or saints. In the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot;, Macha and The Morrígan similarly appear as larger-than-life figures, yet never described as goddesses.

Proinsias Mac Cana&#x27;s position is that &quot;[Rhiannon] reincarnates the goddess of sovereignty who, in taking to her a spouse, thereby ordained him legitimate king of the territory which she personified.&quot; Miranda Green draws in the international folklore motif of the calumniated wife, saying, &quot;Rhiannon conforms to two archetypes of myth ... a gracious, bountiful queen-goddess; and ... the &#x27;wronged wife&#x27;, falsely accused of killing her son.&quot;

==Modern interpretations==
Rhiannon appears in many retellings and performances of the Mabinogi (Mabinogion) today. There is also a vigorous culture of modern fantasy novels. These include &quot;Not For All The Gold In Ireland&quot; (1968) by John James, where Rhiannon marries the Irish god Manannan. Rhiannon also appears in &quot;The Song of Rhiannon&quot; (1972) by Evangeline Walton, which retells the Third Branch of the Mabinogion. 

Leigh Brackett used the name Rhiannon in her planetary romance novel &quot;The Sword of Rhiannon&quot; (1949); in this book Rhiannon is the name of a powerful male Martian.

An example of a modern Rhiannon inspiration is the Fleetwood Mac song &quot;Rhiannon&quot; (1975). Stevie Nicks was inspired to create the song after reading &quot;Triad: A Novel of the Supernatural&quot;, a novel by Mary Bartlet Leader. There is mention of the Welsh legend in the novel, but the Rhiannon in the novel bears little resemblance to her original Welsh namesake. Nevertheless, despite having little accurate knowledge of the original Rhiannon, Nicks&#x27; song does not conflict with the canon, and quickly became a musical legend.

In artworks, Rhiannon has inspired some entrancing images. A notable example is Alan Lee 1987, and 2001, who illustrated two major translations of the Mabinogi, and his pictures have attracted their own following.

In the &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; story &quot;The King&#x27;s Fool&quot; (1984), Rhiannon&#x27;s Wheel is the name of a stone circle where Herne the Hunter appears to the characters.

Rhiannon is included in various Celtic neopaganism traditions since the 1970s, with varying degrees of accuracy in respect to the original literary sources.

In the fantasy world of Poul Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Three Hearts and Three Lions&quot;, there is a &quot;University of Rhiannon&quot;, where magic is taught.

<text>In &quot;Pwyll Pendefig Dyfed&quot;, the first branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot;, Hefeydd Hen (or Heyfedd the Old) was the father of Rhiannon.

According to legend, Hefeydd Hen tried to force his daughter Rhiannon to be married against her will to Gwawl son of Clud. She met Pwyll of Dyfed at the Mound of Arberth and planned to marry at her father&#x27;s court in one year and one day. Their marriage was thwarted by Gwawl and his men. The feast was given to Pwyll and his men, but Rhiannon was given to Gwawl to marry in a year and a day. Pwyll then went to Hefeydd&#x27;s court dressed as a beggar, asking for food. By a trick, Gwawl was captured and he and his men were defeated; forcing Hefeydd to allow Rhiannon to marry Pwyll in his court. Heyfedd Hir (&quot;Hir&quot; meaning &quot;long&quot; in Welsh, but also referring to distance in time), is mentioned as one of the Seven Knights left to take charge of the Island of Britain when Bran went to rescue his sister in the second branch of the Mabinogi. He is also to be found in the 6th century epic poem &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; where the word &quot;Hir&quot; is used to describe no less than seven individuals.

<text>In Welsh mythology, Gwawl (Gwawl fab Clud) was the son of Clud, and tricks Pwyll into promising him Rhiannon. She decides to marry Pwyll instead. Nothing is known of his father Clud.

Gwawl, son of Clud, is initially mentioned in the first of the Four Branches of the Mabinogi, when Rhiannon tells Pwyll, Prince of Dyfed, who wishes to marry her, that she is intended for Gwawl. Rhiannon and Pwyll form a plan to free her from her forced marriage to Gwawl and make arrangements for their own marriage in a year&#x27;s time.

The year passes and it is assumed, if not mentioned, that Gwawl has heard of Rhiannon&#x27;s pending marriage to Pwyll and has had sufficient time to create a plan so he can marry Rhiannon himself. During the wedding feast at the court of Hyfaidd Hen, Rhiannon&#x27;s father, Gwawl enters and is described as &quot;a large, noble, brown-haired fellow...wearing silk brocade.&quot; Gwawl tricks Pwyll into promising to grant him any reasonable request he should make. Realizing his error, Pwyll has no choice but to honour his promise to Gwawl, which is to give him Rhiannon, the feast, and the current wedding preparations. Pwyll reluctantly agrees to release Rhiannon from their marital alliance, but is unable to give Gwawl the feast and preparations, as they are not his to give away.
Gwawl is promised to have Rhiannon&#x27;s hand in marriage after a year has passed and he thus goes away. Unknown to him, Rhiannon instructs Pwyll about how he can win her back from Gwawl. 

After the year is up, Gwawl returns to Rhiannon for the wedding feast and marriage. Pwyll also returns, dressed as a beggar, with a sack that can never be filled until a nobleman stomps down on the bag and orders it to be full. Pwyll enters and asks Gwawl if he can fill his bag with food, to which Gwawl immediately agrees. He becomes irritated when he sees how much food is being put into the sack and asks Pwyll when the sack will be full. Pwyll, as Rhiannon had instructed, says to Gwawl that a strong and powerful noble must trample down the food in the sack and say &quot;enough has been put in here&quot; and then it will be full.

Upon being persuaded by Rhiannon to do the task, Gwawl stands in the bag and Pwyll pulls the bag over Gwawl&#x27;s head, trapping him within the sack. Pwyll summons his war band and they round up Gwawl&#x27;s men and put them in chains. Gwawl, himself, is beaten within the bag by Pwyll&#x27;s men, striking the bag with either their foot or a stick. This is the first account of the game &quot;Badger-in-the-Bag&quot; being played. Gwawl calls out to Pwyll, stating that there is no honor in killing a man trapped in a bag. Pwyll agrees to release Gwawl, if he first promises to never take revenge on them for what has happened. Gwawl eagerly accepts their proposal and is freed from the bag. He tells Pwyll and Rhiannon that he is injured and wounded and thus needs to leave. Gwawl leaves with his men and does not reappear in the other branches, although there is mention of him in the Third Branch of the Mabinogi.

<text>In Welsh tradition, Teyrnon Twryf Lliant is the lord of the Kingdom of Gwent and the foster father of the divine son, Pryderi. He appears most prominently in &quot;Pwyll Pendefig Dyfed&quot;, the first of the Four Branches of the Mabinogi, but also features briefly in the early tale on the Matter of Britain, &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, as a knight of King Arthur. The name Teyrnon is widely acknowledged as deriving from the Common Brittonic *tigernonos, &quot;great lord&quot;.

==Role==
A son is born in Arberth to Pwyll, Lord of Dyfed, and Rhiannon, daughter of Hyfaidd Hen. On the night of his birth, the child disappears while in the care of six of Rhiannon&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting. To avoid the king&#x27;s wrath, they smear dog&#x27;s blood onto a sleeping Rhiannon, claiming that she had committed infanticide and cannibalism through eating her child. 

Teyrnon, meanwhile, owns a mare who gives birth each year but whose foals have all disappeared. He guards his stables and sees a mysterious clawed beast coming to take the foal; Teyrnon cuts off the beast&#x27;s arm and finds the child outside the stable. He and his wife claim the boy as their own and name him Gwri Wallt Euryn (English: &quot;Gwri of the Golden hair&quot;), for &quot;all the hair was as yellow as gold.&quot;

The child grows to adulthood at a superhuman pace and, as he matures, his likeness to Pwyll grows more obvious and, eventually, Teyrnon realises Gwri&#x27;s true identity. The boy is eventually reconciled with Pwyll and Rhiannon and is renamed &quot;Pryderi&quot;. From then on, he was fostered by Pendaran Dyfed and was &quot;brought up carefully, as was proper, until he was the most handsome lad, and the fairest, and the most accomplished at every worthy feat in the kingdom.&quot; 

Pwyll agrees to maintain both Teyrnon and his lands until the day he dies in gratitude. Teyrnon and his wife return to Gwent, amidst &quot;gladness and rejoicing&quot;. He is offered many fine treasures but refuses them.

<text>Hafgan is one of the kings of Annwn, the otherworld in Welsh mythology. He appears in the First Branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot; as the main rival of Arawn, the other king of Annwn. The dominions of the two kings sit side by side, and Hafgan is constantly warring against Arawn. In the story &quot;Pwyll, Prince of Dyfed&quot;, Pwyll, in order to gain Arawn&#x27;s friendship, agrees to switch places with him for one year and one day and to battle against Hafgan in order to rid Arawn of his difficulty. Before they exchange places, Arawn gives specific instructions to Pwyll to kill him with one stroke and no more. In the past when Arawn had battled and had struck Hafgan nearly to his death, Hafgan had begged him to give another stroke, and when Arawn had done so, Hafgan recovered from his injuries and was in good health for battle again the next day.&quot;

In one year Pwyll, wearing the guise of Arawn, goes to battle and succeeds in injuring Hafgan nearly to death, breaking through his shield and armor and knocking him to the ground. Just as Arawn had warned, Hafgan pleaded that Pwyll finish the slaughter and kill him thoroughly. Pwyll refuses to do so, saying, “I may yet repent this, but, whoever else may slay you now, I will not do so.&quot; Hafgan then tells his lords he has met his death and will no longer lead them. When Hafgan&#x27;s men see their leader is at his end, they realize there is no other king but Arawn, and consent to be the subjects of the new and only king of Annwn.

<text>In Gallo-Roman religion, Arduinna (also Arduina, Arduinnae or Arduinne) was the eponymous tutelary goddess of the Ardennes Forest and region, thought to be represented as a huntress riding a boar (primarily in the present-day regions of Belgium and Luxembourg). Her cult originated in the Ardennes region of present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and France. She was identified with the Roman goddess Diana.

==Depictions==
In &quot;The Gods of the Celts&quot;, Miranda Green states that some depictions of Arduinna show her riding a boar. However, Simone Deyts notes that the bronze Gallo-Roman statue of a woman in a short belted tunic, riding a boar sidesaddle and holding a knife, conserved in the Musée des antiquités nationales, St-Germain-en-Laye, bears no inscription, and was simply assumed to be Arduinna by the 19th century antiquarian who discovered it—perhaps because the modern symbol of the Ardennes region is also a boar. Another such bronze, from the collection of Richard Payne Knight, has been in the British Museum since 1824; it is traditionally identified as &quot;Diana&quot;. Both bronze statuettes are now headless.

==Inscriptions==
Arduinna is directly attested from two inscriptions:
* Düren, Germany: &quot;deae Ardbinnae&quot; (; the object in question is an altar)
* Rome, Italy: &quot;Arduinne&quot; (; this is an inscribed relief, on which the name &quot;Arduinne&quot; has also been read as &quot;Saturno&quot;)

==Etymology==

The name Arduinna derives from the Gaulish &quot;arduo-&quot; meaning height. Also Latin: &quot;Ardua-&quot; steep. It is also found in several placenames, such as the Ardennes Woods (&quot;Arduenna silva&quot;) and the Forest of Arden in England, in personal names &quot;Arduunus&quot; and &quot;Arda&quot; — the latter from coinage of the Treveri — and the Galatian &quot;Αρδή&quot;. The name &quot;Arduenna silva&quot; for &quot;wooded heights&quot; was applied to several forested mountains, not just the modern Ardennes: it is found in the départements of Haute-Loire and Puy-de-Dôme and in the French commune of Alleuze.

It has also been suggested that the gemination &quot;-nn-&quot; is typical to a language of the Belgae, being different from Celtic and thus suggesting a &quot;Nordwestblock&quot; etymology, which, generally speaking, is also assumed to be closer to Germanic.

==Historical references==
In 585, Walfroy (Wulfilaich) preached to the local population of Villers-devant-Orval in the Ardennes to persuade them to abandon the worship of Diana. On the hill near Margut, there was, according to Gregory of Tours, a large stone statue of Diana where people would worship. Worshippers would also sing chants in Diana&#x27;s honour as they drank and feasted. After some difficulties, Walfroy and his followers succeeded in pulling down the statue, which they demolished with hammers.

==Legacy==
The Main belt asteroid 394 Arduina, discovered on 19 November 1894, is named for Arduinna.

The French-Belgian television series &quot;Black Spot&quot;, set in the Ardennes, features a group of eco warriors named the Children of Arduinna (&quot;Les Enfants d&#x27;Arduinna&quot;).

<text>Arnemetia is a goddess in Romano-British religion. Her shrine is at Aquae Arnemetiae (&quot;waters of Arnemetia&quot;), which is now Buxton in Derbyshire, England.

Arnemetia&#x27;s name contains Celtic stems &quot;are&quot; (&quot;against, beside&quot;) and &quot;nemeton&quot; (&quot;sacred grove&quot;). Her name is thus interpreted as &quot;she who dwells in the sacred grove&quot;, suggesting Arnemetia may be a divine epithet rather than a name in its own right.

<text>Artio (&quot;Dea Artio&quot; in the Gallo-Roman religion) is a Celtic bear goddess. Evidence of her worship has notably been found at Bern in Switzerland. Her name is derived from the Gaulish word for &#x27;bear&#x27;, &quot;artos&quot;.

==Name==

The Gaulish theonym &quot;Artiō&quot; derives from the Celtic word for the &#x27;bear&#x27;, (cf. Old Irish , Middle Welsh , Old Breton ), itself from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;h₂ŕ̥tḱos&quot; (&#x27;bear&#x27;). A Celtic form reconstructed as *&quot;Arto-rix&quot; (&#x27;Bear-King&#x27;) could be the source for the name Arthur, via a Latinized form *&quot;Artori(u)s&quot;. The Basque (&#x27;bear&#x27;) is also presumed to be a Celtic loanword.

==Attestations==
A bronze sculpture from the Muri statuette group, found near Bern in Switzerland, shows a large bear facing a woman seated in a chair, with a small tree behind the bear. The woman seems to hold fruit in her lap, perhaps feeding the bear. The sculpture has a large rectangular bronze base, which bears the inscription &quot;Deae Artioni / Licinia Sabinilla&quot; (&quot;To the Goddess Artio&quot; or &quot;Artionis&quot;, &quot;from Licinia Sabinilla&quot;). If the name is Gaulish but the syntax is Latin, a dative &quot;Artioni&quot; would give an i-stem nominative &quot;*Artionis&quot; or an n-stem nominative &quot;*Artio&quot;. That would perhaps correspond to a Gaulish n-stem nominative &quot;*Artiu&quot;.

Other inscriptions to the goddess have been discovered in Daun (CIL 13, 4203), Weilerbach (CIL 13, 4113), Heddernheim (CIL 13, 7375 [4, p 125]), and Stockstadt (CIL 13, 11789).

== Popular culture ==
Artio is a playable character in the video game &quot;Smite&quot;. She comes from the Celtic pantheon and is a melee, magical guardian. She can freely transform between her human representation (druid stance) and her bear form (bear stance), both of which come with their own sets of abilities. Her kit mainly focuses on healing herself and her allies and locking down enemies in her druid stance and then outputting large amounts of damage with her bear stance.

<text>In Gallo-Roman religion, Arvernus was the tribal god of the Arverni and an epithet of the Gaulish Mercury. Although the name refers to the Arverni, whose territory Mercury had at important sanctuary at the Puy-de-Dôme in the Massif Central, all of the inscriptions to Mercury Arvernus are found further away along the Rhenish frontier. The similar name Mercury Arvernorix, ‘king of the Arverni’, is also recorded once. Compare also the title Mercury Dumiatis (‘of the Puy-de-Dôme’), found in the territory of the Arverni. The name, like the name of the Arverni and of Auvergne, appears to derive from a Proto-Celtic compound adjective *&quot;φara-werno-s&quot; ‘in front of alders’.

<text>The Matronae Aufaniae (or Matres Aufaniae or Deae Aufaniae) are Germanic Matronae attested on Roman era altars. The &quot;Aufaniae&quot; are one of the most frequently recorded names of matronae on record.

Dating to 164-135 CE and consisting of over 90 items, the &quot;Aufaniae&quot; inscriptions are primarily limited in distribution to the Lower Rhine region in what is today Germany, but a few inscriptions have been found elsewhere: One in Cordoba, Spain, and another in Lyon, France.

The etymology of the name &quot;Aufaniae&quot; remains unclear. Some scholars propose a link to Gothic &quot;ūfjō&quot;, meaning &#x27;abundance, plenty&#x27;.

<text>Afallach (Old Welsh Aballac) is a man&#x27;s name found in several medieval Welsh genealogies, where he is made the son of Beli Mawr. According to a medieval Welsh triad, Afallach was the father of the goddess Modron. The Welsh redactions of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, Brut y Brenhinedd, associate him with Ynys Afallach, which is substituted as the Welsh name for Geoffrey&#x27;s Insula Avalonsis (Island of Avalon), but this is fanciful medieval etymology and it is more likely his name derives from the Welsh word &quot;afall&quot; &quot;apple tree&quot; (modern Welsh &quot;afal&quot; &quot;apple&quot;, afallen &quot;apple tree&quot; cf. Proto-Celtic *&quot;aballo-&quot; &quot;apple&quot;); from which, granted, the name of Avalon is also often thought to derive, so that the meaning of &quot;Afallach&quot; is associated but not necessarily directly. In the tale of Urien and Modron he is referred to by his daughter as the King of Annwn, therefore he may originally been cognate with Arawn or Gwyn or perhaps all three were once regional variants of the same Deity.

<text>Modron (&quot;mother&quot;) is a figure in Welsh tradition, known as the mother of the hero Mabon ap Modron. Both characters may have derived from earlier divine figures, in her case the Gaulish goddess Matrona. She may have been a prototype for Morgan le Fay from the Arthurian legend.

==Origin==
Modron largely features in the Welsh tradition as a supernatural mother figure. She likely derives from the Celtic goddess Matrona, known to have been worshiped in Gaul. Similarly, Modron&#x27;s son, Mabon (&quot;youth&quot;), appears to derive from the youth god Maponos. Both Matrona and Maponos were worshiped in the area around Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, which may account for the prominence of Modron and Mabon in literature connected to the Brittonic &quot;Hen Ogledd&quot; (Old North) of Britain. 

Certain elements of Modron&#x27;s story – specifically that her son Mabon was stolen from her in the night as a baby – suggest a connection with Rhiannon in the First Branch of the Mabinogi, whose son Pryderi was similarly stolen. William John Gruffydd suggested that Modron and Rhiannon were the same in origin.

John T. Koch suggests that Saint Madrun, a daughter of Vortimer, may also be connected, based on the similarity of the names and some elements of their stories. Other scholars believe the names &quot;Modron&quot; and &quot;Madrun&quot; are likely to be etymologically distinct; Madrun comes from the Vulgar Latin name Matrōna (also a common noun &quot;matrōna&quot; &quot;matron&quot;, from Classical Latin &quot;mātrōna&quot;), while Modron is from the Gallo-Brittonic theonym &quot;*Mātronā&quot; &quot;Mother (goddess)&quot;.

==Appearances==
The first reference to the name Modron may be in the poem &quot;Pa Gur yv y Porthaur&quot;, in which &quot;Mabon am Mydron&quot;, a &quot;servant of Uthr Bendragon&quot;, is listed as one of King Arthur&#x27;s warriors. A &quot;Mabon am Melld&quot; or &quot;Mabon fab Mellt&quot; (Mabon son of Lightning) also appears in &quot;Pa Gur&quot; and elsewhere; this may be a different character, but it is also possible that &quot;Mellt&quot; is Mabon&#x27;s father (perhaps related to &quot;Meldos&quot;, an epithet of the lightning god Loucetios). 

Modron&#x27;s most substantial appearance in Welsh literature is in the prose tale &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;. The text states that Mabon was stolen from between her and the wall by unknown forces when he was only three days old, and no one had seen him since. Recovering Mabon from his mysterious captors is one of the various challenges faced by King Arthur and his men in the story, and the adventure comprises a significant portion of the text. Arthur&#x27;s men locate Mabon with the assistance of a series of wise and ancient animals, and liberate him in battle. Subsequently, he joins Arthur and assists in the hunt for the great boar Twrch Trwyth.

The Welsh Triads give her father as Afallach, a figure evidently connected to the island of Avalon. In Triad 70, Modron is the mother of the twins Owain and Morfudd by Urien Rheged. The triad seems to be connected to a story found in MS Peniarth 147 describing Owain and Morfudd&#x27;s birth to an unnamed otherworldly woman. Here, Urien investigates a mysterious ford in Denbighshire where dogs went to bark. He finds a washer woman, and has his way with her. She reveals that she had been condemned to wash at the ford until she conceived a son by &quot;a Christian&quot;, and bids Urien to return at the end of the year to receive the child. On returning, Urien finds the twins Owain and Morfudd.

Modron is connected with &quot;Euron&quot; in the poem &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot; (&quot;The Battle of the Trees&quot;), which associates her with characters known from the Third Branch of the Mabinogi. Euron may an error for &quot;Gwron&quot;; John T. Koch suggests the name may ultimately derive from an older form *&quot;Uironos&quot;, meaning &quot;divine man, husband, hero&quot;, implying he is Modron&#x27;s spouse. Modron&#x27;s name (connected to Mabon) also appears in &quot;Englynion y Beddau&quot; (&quot;Stanzas of the Graves&quot;).

<text>In Gallo-Roman religion, Dea Aveta was a mother goddess, also associated with the freshwater spring at Trier in what is now Germany. Aveta is known mainly from clay figurines found at Toulon-sur- Allier in France and at Trier. These figurines show the goddess with infants at the breast, small lap-dogs, or baskets of fruit. There was a temple dedicated to Aveta in the Altbachtal complex at Trier.
Her name is also known from inscriptions found in Switzerland and the Côte-d&#x27;Or (France).

<text>Derek Bailey (29 January 1930 – 25 December 2005) was an English avant-garde guitarist and an important figure in the free improvisation movement. Bailey abandoned conventional performance techniques found in jazz, exploring atonality, noise, and whatever unusual sounds he could produce with the guitar. Much of his work was released on his own label Incus Records. In addition to solo work, Bailey collaborated frequently with other musicians and recorded with collectives such as Spontaneous Music Ensemble and Company.

== Career ==
Bailey was born in Sheffield, England. A third-generation musician, he began playing guitar at the age of ten. He studied with Sheffield City organist C. H. C. Biltcliffe, an experience he disliked, and with his uncle George Wing and John Duarte. As an adult he worked as a guitarist and session musician in clubs, radio, and dance hall bands, playing with Morecambe and Wise, Gracie Fields, Bob Monkhouse, Kathy Kirby, and on the television program &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;.

Bailey&#x27;s earliest foray into free improvisation was in 1953 with two guitarists in Glasgow. He was part of a trio founded in 1963 with Tony Oxley and Gavin Bryars called Joseph Holbrooke, named after English composer Joseph Holbrooke, although the group never played his work. The band played conventional jazz at first, but later moved in the direction of free jazz.

In 1966, Bailey moved to London. At the Little Theatre Club run by drummer John Stevens, he met like-minded musicians such as saxophonist Evan Parker, trumpeter Kenny Wheeler, and double bassist Dave Holland, with whom he formed the Spontaneous Music Ensemble. In 1968 they recorded &quot;Karyobin&quot; for Island Records. Bailey formed the Music Improvisation Company with Parker, percussionist Jamie Muir, and Hugh Davies on homemade electronics. The band continued until 1971. He was a member of the Jazz Composer&#x27;s Orchestra and formed the trio Iskra 1903 with double bassist Barry Guy and trombonist Paul Rutherford that was named after a newspaper published by Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin. He was a member of Oxley&#x27;s sextet until 1973.

In 1970, Bailey founded the record label Incus with Tony Oxley, Evan Parker, and Michael Walters. It was the first musician-owned independent label in the UK. Oxley and Walters left early in the label&#x27;s history; Parker and Bailey continued as co-directors until the mid-1980s, when friction between them led to Parker&#x27;s departure. Bailey continued the label with his partner Karen Brookman until his death in 2005.

With other musicians, Bailey was a co-founder in 1975 of &quot;Musics&quot; magazine, described as &quot;an impromental experivisation arts magazine&quot;.

In 1976, Bailey started the collaborative project Company, which at various times included Han Bennink, Steve Beresford, Anthony Braxton, Buckethead, Eugene Chadbourne, Lol Coxhill, Johnny Dyani, Fred Frith, Tristan Honsinger, Henry Kaiser, Steve Lacy, Keshavan Maslak, Misha Mengelberg, Wadada Leo Smith, John Zorn and many other musicians. Bailey organized the annual music festival Company Week, which lasted until 1994. In 1980, he wrote the book &quot;Improvisation: Its Nature and Practice&quot;. In 1992, the book was adapted by Channel 4 in the UK into a four-part TV series, &quot;On the Edge: Improvisation in Music&quot;, which was narrated by Bailey.

Bailey died in London on Christmas Day in 2005. He had been suffering from motor neurone disease.

== Music ==

Throughout both his commercial and improvising careers, Bailey&#x27;s principal guitar was a 1963 Gibson ES 175 model. Although he occasionally made use of prepared guitar in the 1970s (he would, for example, put paper clips on the strings, wrap his instruments in chains, or add further strings to the guitar), often for Dadaist/theatrical effect, by the end of that decade he had, in his own words, &quot;dumped&quot; such methods. Bailey argued that his approach to music-making was actually far more orthodox than that of performers such as Keith Rowe of the improvising collective AMM, who treats the guitar purely as a &quot;sound source&quot; rather than as a musical instrument. Instead, Bailey preferred to &quot;look for whatever &#x27;effects&#x27; I might need through technique&quot;.

Eschewing labels such as &quot;jazz&quot; and &quot;free jazz&quot;, Bailey described his music as &quot;non-idiomatic&quot;. In the second edition of his book &quot;Improvisation...&quot;, Bailey indicated that he felt that free improvisation was no longer &quot;non-idiomatic&quot; in his sense of the word, as it had become a recognizable genre and musical style itself. Bailey frequently sought performance contexts that would provide new stimulations and challenge that would prove musically &quot;interesting&quot;, as he often put it. This led to work with collaborators such as Pat Metheny, John Zorn, Lee Konitz, David Sylvian, Cyro Baptista, Cecil Taylor, Keiji Haino, tap dancer Will Gaines, Drum &#x27;n&#x27; Bass DJ Ninj, Susie Ibarra, Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth and the Japanese noise rock group Ruins. Despite often performing and recording in a solo context, he was far more interested in the dynamics and challenges of working with other musicians, especially those who did not necessarily share his approach. As he put it in a March 2002 article of &quot;Jazziz&quot; magazine:

Bailey was also known for his dry sense of humour. In 1977, &quot;Musics&quot; magazine sent the question &quot;What happens to time-awareness during improvisation?&quot; to about thirty musicians associated with the free improvisation scene. The answers received varied from long, and theoretical essays to plain, direct comments. Typically pithy was Bailey&#x27;s reply: &quot;The ticks turn into tocks and the tocks turn into ticks.&quot;

&quot;Mirakle&quot;, a 1999 recording released in 2000, shows Bailey moving into the free funk genre, performing with bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma and drummer Grant Calvin Weston. &quot;Carpal Tunnel&quot;, the last album to be released during his lifetime, documented his struggle with the carpal tunnel syndrome in his right hand which had rendered him unable to grip a plectrum. This problem marked the onset of motor neurone disease. Characteristically, he refused invasive surgery to treat his condition, instead being more &quot;interested in finding ways to work around&quot; this limitation. He chose to &quot;relearn&quot; guitar playing techniques by utilising his right thumb and index fingers to pluck the strings.

<text>The Triple J Hottest 100 is an annual music poll presented by the publicly-funded Australian youth radio station Triple J. Members of the public are invited to vote for their favourite Australian and alternative music of the year in an online poll conducted two weeks prior to the new year.

The first countdown in 1989 was held in March, and then on various days in January and February until 1998 when it was mostly consistently held on Australia Day. Since 2017, the countdown has been held on the fourth weekend of January due to increasing controversy about Australia Day regarding its marking of the colonisation of Australia and dispossession of Indigenous people. Typically, on the day after the Hottest 100, Triple J broadcasts the Hottest 200 (songs 200–101).

The poll has grown from 500,000 votes in 2004 to a peak of over 3.2 million in 2019, and it has been referred to as &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest music democracy&quot;. American singer Chappell Roan&#x27;s song Good Luck, Babe! is the latest song to top the Hottest 100.

Since 2015, the countdown has raised at least $3.3 million for various Australian charity partners, including Lifeline, through merchandise sales. ABC Music issued compilation CDs following each year&#x27;s countdown until 2022. In 2023, Triple J launched Triple J Hottest, an online radio station featuring a playlist of tracks from all previous Hottest 100 countdowns.

==History==
===1988–1991: The Hot 100===
The idea for the poll came from Triple J producer Lawrie Zion in late 1988. During this time, he conceived the idea of running a listener poll to determine their 100 favourite songs of all time. The idea was taken from Brisbane community radio station 4ZZZ, which developed the original Hot 100 in 1976.

For the Hot 100, before Triple J had become a national broadcaster, Sydney listeners were required to write their 10 favourite tracks on the back of an envelope. Some entries were sent into the station written on a variety of items, including paintings, sculptures, and hand-rolled cannabis cigarettes. The results of the first poll were counted down on Sunday 5 March 1989, between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m.

The station repeated the event the following year when it started broadcasting to other capital cities besides Sydney. In 1991, Triple J was forced to change the poll&#x27;s name to Hottest 100 to avoid legal action with 4ZZZ.

During the poll&#x27;s first few years — from 1989 to 1991 — the winner in the first two years was &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; by Joy Division, while 1991&#x27;s favourite song was &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; by Nirvana, which had been released that year.

===1992–1995: The Hottest 100===

Realising that the poll&#x27;s results were unlikely to significantly change from year to year, Triple J rested the Hottest 100 in 1992 and relaunched it as an annual poll the following year. The newly launched poll required listeners to vote for their favourite songs of that year. Denis Leary&#x27;s comedy anthem &quot;Asshole&quot; was voted number one in 1993.

The inaugural Hottest 100 compilation CD, &quot;Triple J Hottest 100 (The Hottest Of The Hottest)&quot;, was released by ABC Music in 1994.

=== 1996–2016: Rise in Australian music ===
In 1996, Spiderbait became the first Australian act to reach number one. Since 1999, Australian acts have made up the majority of the polls.

The first Hottest 100 DVD, &quot;Triple J Hottest 100: The Hottest Videos For 2002&quot;, was released in 2002. Queens of the Stone Age&#x27;s &quot;No One Knows&quot; was voted into the top position in that year, while Grinspoon, Motor Ace, Darren Hanlon, Machine Translations and Ms Dynamite were other Hottest 100 artists featured on the release.

In 2003, Powderfinger became the first act to be featured three times in the top-10 poll, with &quot;(Baby I&#x27;ve Got You) On My Mind&quot;, &quot;Sunsets&quot; and &quot;Love Your Way&quot; placing in the fourth, seventh and tenth places, respectively.

After its beginnings as a write-in poll, the Hottest 100 progressed to phone-in voting, which then progressed to SMS and online voting. In 2003, only web votes through the Triple J website were accepted, with registration required and a limit of 10 votes applied. In 2004, the guidelines were expanded so that voters were entitled to 10 internet votes and 10 SMS votes.

In 2014, Chet Faker repeated Powderfinger&#x27;s achievement from 2003 by placing three times in the top 10 positions. Faker reached the number one spot with &quot;Talk Is Cheap&quot; and the seventh and eighth positions respectively, with &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;1998&quot;. All three songs came from Faker&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Built on Glass&quot;. Chet Faker placed a total of four times in the entire poll, with a &quot;Like a Version&quot; cover of Sonia Dada&#x27;s &quot;You Don&#x27;t Treat Me No Good&quot; in the 22nd position. The 2014 Hottest 100 poll received a record of 2,099,707 million votes, cast by 258,762 voters from 188 countries.

====2015: Taylor Swift controversy====

Following a 13 January 2015 article on BuzzFeed, the &quot;#Tay4Hottest100&quot; hashtag campaign began during the voting period for the Hottest 100 poll for 2014 to promote Taylor Swift&#x27;s hit single &quot;Shake It Off&quot;. According to those critical of the campaign, the Hottest 100 is reserved for non-mainstream artists who were &quot;discovered or fostered by Triple J&quot; and provides valuable exposure for artists in the outer circles of the music industry.

The campaign led to discussion about the broader cultural implications of the controversy generated by Swift. The &quot;Guardian&quot;″s Elle Hunt wrote: &quot;... the virulent response to #Tay4Hottest100 has revealed the persistence of a dichotomy I&#x27;d thought we&#x27;d thrown out long ago: that of high art versus low.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Conversation&quot; on 23 January 2015, Charles Darwin University academic Gemma Blackwood concluded:
The cultural and economic meanings attached to the celebrity-sign of &quot;Taylor Swift&quot; seems antithetical to Triple J&#x27;s self-representation as a place for exciting new music, with a supposed focus on emerging Australian talent. This perhaps explains why Swift is excluded from the playlist when other &quot;mainstream&quot; American artists and chart toppers ... are still played on the station heavily: the alignment and transfer of values of what is considered &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;hip&quot; between the station and its chosen artists ... It raises the question: what responsibility does a national youth broadcaster have in the shaping and the adapting of young musical interests?

Station manager Chris Scaddan told the media that the Swift campaign was within the rules of the poll, later instructing Triple J employees not to comment to &quot;media, friends, family&quot; about the campaign, as &quot;it will all become clear when we get to the countdown next Monday.&quot; The station said: &quot;we don&#x27;t comment on voting campaigns whilst Hottest 100 voting is open. It draws attention to them and may influence the results of the poll.&quot; Marketing website Mumbrella suggested on 20 January that a Facebook post by KFC incorporating the &quot;#Tay4Hottest100&quot; hashtag was against the Hottest 100 rules and could see Swift disqualified. The &quot;Guardian&quot; submitted a freedom of information request to the ABC in regard to the station&#x27;s response to the campaign.

After journalist Peter Vincent reported that the Swift campaign had &quot;swallowed&quot; the Hottest 100 for 2014, citing research from the University of Queensland that showed that over 7,341 Hottest 100 posts in a 30-day period leading up to the poll results related to Swift, &quot;Shake It Off&quot; was eventually disqualified by the radio station in an announcement on 26 January 2015. The official announcement read: &quot;it became pretty clear, pretty quick that a lot of people just wanted to prod some &#x27;hipsters&#x27; for the lulz&quot;, acknowledging that the station &quot;had a heap of fun&quot; with the campaign, while also acknowledging Swift is &quot;smart&quot;, &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;successful&quot;. The song would have placed in 12th position if it had been allowed to compete.

On the inside cover of the &quot;Triple J Hottest 100 Volume 22&quot; CD, bold capital initials spell out &quot;TAYLOR SWIFT BAN&quot;.

=== 2017–present: Announcement of date change ===

In mid-2016, support grew for a campaign calling on Triple J to change the date of the Hottest 100 due to ongoing debate about the meaning of the date of Australia Day to Indigenous Australians. Calls were led by Indigenous activists, with Australian hip-hop duo A.B. Original and their protest single &quot;January 26&quot; playing a particularly instrumental role in drawing support to the cause. Triple J responded to the campaign in September 2016, announcing a review over whether the date of the Hottest 100 should be changed.

The review of the date continued into 2017, including consultation with Reconciliation Australia, the National Congress of Australia&#x27;s First Peoples, and the National Australia Day Council, while the 2016 Hottest 100 was held on Australia Day without change. In August 2017, Triple J launched a survey asking for public opinion on whether the date should be changed. 60% of participants voted in support of moving the date; 39% responded to not change it.

In 2017, Triple J announced that they would no longer hold the Hottest 100 on 26 January. Instead, the Hottest 100 would be held on the fourth weekend of January each year, beginning with the 2017 countdown on 27 January 2018.

Some organisations offered alternatives to Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100 in response to the date change. These include nationwide rock radio station Triple M broadcasting an &quot;Ozzest 100&quot; countdown of only Australian songs on 26 January, and Senator Cory Bernardi&#x27;s Australian Conservatives publishing an &quot;AC100&quot; playlist of Australian music on Spotify.

==Hottest 100 top tens and summaries==

== Impact ==

=== In popular culture ===
The Hottest 100 has been branded a &quot;national institution&quot; and &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest music democracy&quot;. The countdown receives millions of votes every year– in 2019, a record of 3.2 million were cast. In 2022, one in two Australians engaged with the Hottest 100 campaign, and 3.6 million people listened on the day, according to national ratings. 

Musicians who have taken out the number one spot have often seen a popularity boost after the annual countdown. Following Alex Lloyd winning the 2001 countdown with &quot;Amazing&quot;, it became the most played song on Australian radio for the next year. The singer said commercial stations only started playing it after his win on Triple J; from royalties then received, he was able to buy a house. Alternative rock band the Rubens won the Hottest 100 of 2015 and immediately had to upgrade the venues for their upcoming tour due to an influx of new fans.

=== Voter turnout and fundraising ===
Since the 2015 countdown, Triple J has annually partnered with an Australian organisation to donate all funds raised from Hottest 100 merchandise – usually a T-shirt branded with the countdown&#x27;s logo. In total, these fundraisers have raised over $3.3 million for a variety of causes that the broadcaster deems &quot;most important&quot; to listeners each year.

==Notable artists==

Since its inception, the artists who have been featured the most in the annual countdown are Billie Eilish and Hilltop Hoods, who have both appeared 25 times; Powderfinger, with 22 songs between 1996 and 2009; Foo Fighters, who charted 22 times between 1995 and 2014 (in 2011, it was incorrectly stated that Foo Fighters had the most appearances); and Tame Impala, Kanye West and G Flip, with each appearing 19 times. Powderfinger&#x27;s frontman, Bernard Fanning, has taken the top spot on three occasions, twice with Powderfinger in 1999 and 2000, and once as a solo artist in 2005; only one other artist, Flume (twice) has topped an annual countdown more than once. Dave Grohl, frontman of the Foo Fighters, has appeared in annual countdowns 32 times, including five times with Queens of the Stone Age in 2002, four times with Nirvana, and once with Them Crooked Vultures.

If charting the number of countdowns an artist has appeared in, rather than the number of their songs that have been voted in, the Foo Fighters still hold the record; their songs have featured in 13 of the annual countdowns, including a streak of six consecutive appearances between 1995 and 2000. However, the record for the most consecutive appearances belongs to The Living End, who had at least one song appear in every annual countdown for ten years, between 1997 and 2006.

When including all of Triple J&#x27;s countdowns (adding the five Hottest 100 of All Time countdowns, the 2011 Australian Albums countdown, and the 2013 Twenty Years countdown), The Cure has made more appearances than any other band, with 31 entries in the All Time countdowns and five in the yearly countdowns. Powderfinger and Silverchair have been featured 30 and 28 times, respectively, in total. As for individuals, Dave Grohl has achieved 47 entries (24 with Foo Fighters, 15 with Nirvana, seven with Queens of the Stone Age, and one with Them Crooked Vultures), Bernard Fanning has 33 (30 with Powderfinger, three as a solo artist), and Robert Smith has 32 (31 with The Cure, one from a solo collaboration with Crystal Castles in 2010).

<doc id="86050" wikidata="Q754186" url="?curid=86050" title="Prepared piano">
<text>A prepared piano is a piano that has had its sounds temporarily altered by placing bolts, screws, mutes, rubber erasers, and/or other objects on or between the strings. Its invention is usually traced to John Cage&#x27;s dance music for &quot;Bacchanale&quot; (1940), created for a performance in a Seattle venue that lacked sufficient space for a percussion ensemble. Cage has cited Henry Cowell as an inspiration for developing piano extended techniques, involving strings within a piano being manipulated instead of the keyboard. Typical of Cage&#x27;s practice as summed up in the &quot;Sonatas and Interludes&quot; (1946–48) is that each key of the piano has its own characteristic timbre, and that the original pitch of the string will not necessarily be recognizable. Further variety is available with use of the una corda pedal.

Ferrante &amp; Teicher between 1950 and 1980 used partially prepared pianos for some of their tunes in their albums. Other musicians, such as Denman Maroney use prepared piano for performances, whereas Cor Fuhler and Roger Miller have developed their own ways of using prepared piano in their musical albums. Additionally, notable contributors to the subsequent repertoire include Lou Harrison, Pauline Oliveros, James Tenney, and Christian Wolff.

When a properly prepared piano has been &quot;unprepared&quot;, it should be impossible for anyone to tell that it had ever been prepared. Changes causing less easily reversible damage can be served by permanently dedicating an instrument, such as the tack piano. Other techniques related to prepared piano include the Acoustisizer.

== Historical precedents ==
Cage frequently cited Henry Cowell (1897–1965) as the primary inspiration for the prepared piano. Cowell pioneered piano extended techniques for what he dubbed &quot;string piano&quot;, involving reaching inside the piano and plucking, sweeping, scraping, thumping, and otherwise manipulating the strings directly, rather than using the keyboard. He developed these techniques in numerous pieces such as &quot;Aeolian Harp&quot; (1923) and &quot;The Banshee&quot; (1925).
Pieces of paper were called for in several early 20c works, the buzzing effect reminiscent of the parchment &#x27;bassoon&#x27; pedal of early fortepianos. In his &quot;Ragamalika&quot; (1912–22), based on the classical music of India, French composer Maurice Delage (1879–1961) calls for a piece of cardboard to be placed under the B in the second line of the bass clef to dampen the sound, imitating the sound of an Indian drum.

In his &quot;Chôros No. 8&quot;, a 1925 work for large orchestra, Heitor Villa-Lobos instructs the 2nd pianist to insert pieces of paper between the strings Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;enfant et les sortilèges&quot; (1920-1925) calls for Luthéal, but allows piano with paper to substitute.

== John Cage ==
The invention of the &quot;prepared piano&quot;, &quot;per se&quot;, is usually traced to John Cage. Cage first prepared a piano when he was commissioned to write music for &quot;Bacchanale&quot;, a dance by Syvilla Fort (its date is variously given as 1938 or 1940). For some time previously, Cage had been writing exclusively for a percussion ensemble, but the hall where Fort’s dance was to be staged had no room for a percussion group. The only instrument available was a single grand piano. After some consideration, Cage said that he realized it was possible &quot;to place in the hands of a single pianist the equivalent of an entire percussion orchestra ... With just one musician, you can really do an unlimited number of things on the inside of the piano if you have at your disposal an exploded keyboard&quot;.

== Other composers, arrangers, performers, and compositions ==
* Ferrante &amp; Teicher were an American piano duo who produced over a hundred albums of light classical and popular &quot;easy listening&quot; in their long careers (1947–1992). Between 1950 and 1980 they included partially prepared pianos on a number of their tunes to add percussive effects.
* On &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot; from &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; (1967), John Cale prepared his piano with a chain of paper clips.
* On his 1968 album &quot;Blues Roots&quot;, Dave Brubeck prepared a piano by laying copper strips across the strings to give the song &quot;Blues Roots&quot; a honky-tonk sound.
* Denman Maroney performs on what he has dubbed &#x27;hyperpiano&#x27;, which &quot;involves stopping, sliding, bowing, plucking, striking and strumming the strings with copper bars, aluminum bowls, rubber blocks, plastic boxes and other household objects.&quot;
* Cor Fuhler pioneered many inside piano techniques during the 1980s and recorded his first prepared piano solo album &quot;7CC IN IO&quot; on GeestGronden in 1995; recorded &quot;The Hands of Caravaggio&quot; with John Tilbury and M.I.M.E.O. on the USA label Erstwhile Records; and in 2007 he released &quot;Stengam&quot; on the French label Potlatch.
* Since 1982, Roger Miller has developed his own take on prepared piano in his work, initially on Mission of Burma&#x27;s single &quot;Trem II&quot;. Miller has since released many albums (on labels including Ace of Hearts, SST, New Alliance, Atavistic and Matador) incorporating this technique. His concert hall compositions since 2009 have often utilized prepared piano.
* On his 1975 album &quot;Another Green World&quot;, composer Brian Eno employed prepared piano on the track &quot;Little Fishes&quot;. He also played it on David Bowie&#x27;s Lodger (1979) album.
* Hauschka, aka Volker Bertelmann, employed prepared piano techniques in his album &quot;The Prepared Piano&quot; in 2005.
* Several Aphex Twin compositions from the 2001 album &quot;Drukqs&quot; make use of prepared piano.
* The third movement of John Mackey&#x27;s wind symphony, &quot;Wine-Dark Sea&quot;, utilizes piano prepared with glass rods. The combination of the glass rods, as well as a spoon scraped over the strings, work to create a dissonant &quot;fingernails on chalkboard,&quot; setting the scene of Odysseus in the underworld.
* Kristin Hayter, while on tour under the moniker Lingua Ignota, has performed on a piano prepared with forks, clothes pins, fishing wire with heavy rosin, bells, chains, and a clamp lamp.
* Kelly Moran, an American composer and producer makes extensive use of prepared piano techniques on her 2017 album &quot;Bloodroot&quot;.

== Related techniques ==
=== Tack piano ===
Strictly speaking, a tack piano is not a prepared piano, since
* No objects are inserted into or onto the strings;
* The strings&#x27; original pitches remain perceptible; and
* The preparation is not fully reversible.

Although the tacks can be removed from the hammers, inserting them causes permanent damage to the felt; for this and other reasons, the use of tacks is generally discouraged by piano technicians.

=== Acoustisizer ===
&quot;The Acoustisizer&quot; is an electroacoustic musical instrument built from a small grand piano with built-in speakers, magnetic guitar pickups, PZMs, and &quot;prepared piano&quot; strings. It was built as part of a graduate thesis project at California State University Dominguez Hills by Bob Fenger (1983), a student of Richard Bunger (author of the &quot;Well Prepared Piano&quot;). Speakers are built into the bottom of the instrument, redirecting its own amplified sound back onto the sounding board, with strings and magnetic pickups creating an amplitude intensity loop, which in turn drives and vibrates suspended &quot;kinetic oscillators&quot; (assemblages of vibration sensitive materials). Secondary control parameters allow extraction of vibration and sound phenomena from the &quot;kinetic oscillators&quot; through a series of proximity microphones and &quot;PZMs&quot; (piezo-electric contact mics). An article by the inventor was published in &quot;Experimental Musical Instruments Magazine&quot; April 1991, Nicasio, California. It includes pictures of the &quot;kinetic oscillators&quot; and stages of the construction process, including an underbody view of the speaker system configuration.

<doc id="86053" wikidata="Q633593" url="?curid=86053" title="New England Confederation">
<text>The United Colonies of New England, commonly known as the New England Confederation, was a confederal alliance of the New England colonies of Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Saybrook (Connecticut), and New Haven formed in May 1643, during the English Civil War. Its primary purpose was to unite the Puritan colonies in support of the Congregational church, and for defense against the Native Americans and the Dutch colony of New Netherland. It was the first milestone on the long road to colonial unity and was established as a direct result of a war that started between the Mohegan and Narragansett Native American peoples. Its charter provided for the return of fugitive criminals and indentured servants, and served as a forum for resolving inter-colonial disputes. In practice, none of the goals were accomplished. 

The confederation was weakened in 1654 after Massachusetts Bay refused to join an expedition against New Netherland during the First Anglo-Dutch War, although it regained importance during King Philip&#x27;s War in 1675. It was dissolved after numerous colonial charters were revoked in the early 1680s.

John Quincy Adams remarked at a meeting of the Massachusetts Historical Society on the 200th anniversary of the Confederation&#x27;s founding:
==Treaty==
The full name of the 1643 treaty was &quot;The Articles of Confederation between the Plantations under the Government of the Massachusetts, the Plantations under the Government of New Plymouth, the Plantations under the Government of Connecticut, and the Government of New Haven with the Plantations in Combination therewith&quot;. The colonies of New England were expanding territorially and the populations growing, and their contact was increasing with other European colonial settlements, as well as with surrounding Native American tribes. New England colonial leaders sought a way allowing the individual colonies to coordinate a collective defense of New England. The New England leaders also felt that they were unique among the American colonies, and they hoped to band together to preserve their Puritan values. The treaty calls on the New England colonies to act as a nation, saying that they share a way of life and religion. This alliance was meant to be a perpetual mode of defense and communication among the colonies themselves and with any foreign entities.

The treaty outlining the alliance contained the following clauses, in summary:

*The colonies should form into a league of friendship with mutual military assurance. This relationship would ensure the communal safety and welfare of the colonies and preserve their Puritan way of life.
*The New England colonies were to maintain their current territory. Their jurisdictions would remain unfettered by the other members of the confederation, and any changes made would have to be agreed upon by the other members.
*All members of the confederation were bound to each other if war occurred. This meant that they had to contribute to the war whatever they were capable of in terms of men and provisions. The colonies would also be obligated to provide a census of all their available men for militia. All men from 16 to 60 were to be considered eligible for service. Any gains from military conflict were to be divided in a just manner among the confederation.
*If any member of the confederation came under attack, the other members must come to their aid without delay. This assistance would take place proportionally. Massachusetts Bay would be required to send 100 armed and supplied men, the other colonies 45 armed and supplied men or less, based on size and population. If a greater number of men or supplies is needed, then the commissioners of the Confederation would need to approve of the measure.
*Two commissioners were to be chosen from each province to administer martial affairs. The commissioners were to meet once a year on the first Thursday in September, rotating the location among the colonies.
*The commissioners would select a president from among themselves; he would not have any extra powers and would serve a purely administrative function. 
*Commissioners would have power to draft law and codes that would benefit the general welfare of the Confederation. These laws would be to ensure friendly relations among the provinces and security for the Confederation. There was also to be cooperation between provinces in terms of the return of fugitives and runaway servants.
*No member colony was to undertake any act of war or conflict without the consent of the others. This would be to prevent smaller provinces from being forced to engage in a war that they did not have the resources to fight. Any offensive war would need approval of six of the eight Commissioners. 
*Four Commissioners could make administrative decisions in extenuating circumstances, but any decision would have to be within bounds of the pledged men and resources. No decision concerning bills or levies could be made with less than six commissioners present.
*If any member province of the Confederation were to break any of the clauses, then the remaining provinces&#x27; commissioners were to meet and decide upon any further action.

The Massachusetts General Court and the commissioners from Saybrook Colony and New Haven Colony agreed to the treaty on May 19, 1643. The General Court of the Plymouth Colony agreed to it on August 29.

<text>Binoculars or field glasses are two refracting telescopes mounted side-by-side and aligned to point in the same direction, allowing the viewer to use both eyes (binocular vision) when viewing distant objects. Most binoculars are sized to be held using both hands, although sizes vary widely from opera glasses to large pedestal-mounted military models.

Unlike a (monocular) telescope, binoculars give users a three-dimensional image: each eyepiece presents a slightly different image to each of the viewer&#x27;s eyes and the parallax allows the visual cortex to generate an impression of depth.

== Optical design evolution ==

=== Galilean ===

Almost from the invention of the telescope in the 17th century the advantages of mounting two of them side by side for binocular vision seems to have been explored. Most early binoculars used Galilean optics; that is, they used a convex objective and a concave eyepiece lens. The Galilean design has the advantage of presenting an erect image but has a narrow field of view and is not capable of very high magnification. This type of construction is still used in very cheap models and in opera glasses or theater glasses. The Galilean design is also used in low magnification binocular surgical and jewelers&#x27; loupes because they can be very short and produce an upright image without extra or unusual erecting optics, reducing expense and overall weight. They also have large exit pupils, making centering less critical, and the narrow field of view works well in those applications. These are typically mounted on an eyeglass frame or custom-fit onto eyeglasses.

=== Keplerian ===
An improved image and higher magnification are achieved in binoculars employing Keplerian optics, where the image formed by the objective lens is viewed through a positive eyepiece lens (ocular).
Since the Keplerian configuration produces an inverted image, different methods are used to turn the image the right way up.

==== Erecting lenses ====

In aprismatic binoculars with Keplerian optics (which were sometimes called &quot;twin telescopes&quot;), each tube has one or two additional lenses (relay lens) between the objective and the eyepiece. These lenses are used to erect the image. The binoculars with erecting lenses had a serious disadvantage: they are too long. Such binoculars were popular in the 1800s (for example, G. &amp; S. Merz models). The Keplerian &quot;twin telescopes&quot; binoculars were optically and mechanically hard to manufacture, but it took until the 1890s to supersede them with better prism-based technology.

==== Prism ====
Optical prisms added to the design enabled the display of the image the right way up without needing as many lenses, and decreasing the overall length of the instrument, typically using Porro prism or roof prism systems. The Italian inventor of optical instruments Ignazio Porro worked during the 1860s with Hofmann in Paris to produce monoculars using the same prism configuration used in modern Porro prism binoculars. At the 1873 Vienna Trade Fair German optical designer and scientist Ernst Abbe displayed a prism telescope with two cemented Porro prisms. The optical solutions of Porro and Abbe were theoretically sound, but the employed prism systems failed in practice primarily due to insufficient glass quality.

===== Porro =====
&quot;Porro prism binoculars&quot; are named after Ignazio Porro, who patented this image erecting system in 1854. The later refinement by Ernst Abbe and his cooperation with glass scientist Otto Schott, who managed to produce a better type of Crown glass in 1888, and instrument maker Carl Zeiss resulted in 1894 in the commercial introduction of improved &#x27;modern&#x27; Porro prism binoculars by the Carl Zeiss company. Binoculars of this type use a pair of Porro prisms in a Z-shaped configuration to erect the image. This results in wide binoculars, with objective lenses that are well separated and offset from the eyepieces, giving a better sensation of depth. Porro prism designs have the added benefit of folding the optical path so that the physical length of the binoculars is less than the focal length of the objective. Porro prism binoculars were made in such a way to erect an image in a relatively small space, thus binoculars using prisms started in this way.

Porro prisms require typically within 10 arcminutes ( of 1 degree) tolerances for alignment of their optical elements (collimation) at the factory. Sometimes Porro prisms binoculars need their prisms set to be re-aligned to bring them into collimation. Good-quality Porro prism design binoculars often feature about deep grooves or notches ground across the width of the hypotenuse face center of the prisms, to eliminate image quality reducing abaxial non-image-forming reflections. Porro prism binoculars can offer good optical performance with relatively little manufacturing effort and as human eyes are ergonomically limited by their interpupillary distance the offset and separation of big (60+ mm wide) diameter objective lenses and the eyepieces becomes a practical advantage in a stereoscopic optical product.

In the early 2020s, the commercial market share of Porro prism-type binoculars had become the second most numerous compared to other prism-type optical designs.

There are alternative Porro prism-based systems available that find application in binoculars on a small scale, like the Perger prism that offers a significantly reduced axial offset compared to traditional Porro prism designs .

=====Roof=====

&quot;Roof prism binoculars&quot; may have appeared as early as the 1870s in a design by Achille Victor Emile Daubresse. In 1897 Moritz Hensoldt began marketing pentaprism based roof prism binoculars.

Most roof prism binoculars use either the Schmidt–Pechan prism (invented in 1899) or the Abbe–Koenig prism (named after Ernst Karl Abbe and Albert König and patented by Carl Zeiss in 1905) designs to erect the image and fold the optical path. They have objective lenses that are approximately in a line with the eyepieces.

Binoculars with roof prisms have been in use to a large extent since the second half of the 20th century. Roof prism designs result in objective lenses that are almost or totally in line with the eyepieces, creating an instrument that is narrower and more compact than Porro prisms and lighter. There is also a difference in image brightness. Porro prism and Abbe–Koenig roof-prism binoculars will inherently produce a brighter image than Schmidt–Pechan roof prism binoculars of the same magnification, objective size, and optical quality, because the Schmidt-Pechan roof-prism design employs mirror-coated surfaces that reduce light transmission.

In roof prism designs, optically relevant prism angles must be correct within 2 arcseconds ( of 1 degree) to avoid seeing an obstructive double image. Maintaining such tight production tolerances for the alignment of their optical elements by laser or interference (collimation) at an affordable price point is challenging. To avoid the need for later re-collimation, the prisms are generally aligned at the factory and then permanently fixed to a metal plate. These complicating production requirements make high-quality roof prism binoculars more costly to produce than Porro prism binoculars of equivalent optical quality and until phase correction coatings were invented in 1988 Porro prism binoculars optically offered superior resolution and contrast to non-phase corrected roof prism binoculars.

In the early 2020s, the commercial offering of Schmidt-Pechan designs exceeds the Abbe-Koenig design offerings and had become the dominant optical design compared to other prism-type designs.

Alternative roof prism-based designs like the Uppendahl prism system composed of three prisms cemented together were and are commercially offered on a small scale.

==Optical systems and their practical effect on binoculars housing shapes==

The optical system of modern binoculars consists of three main optical assemblies:
* Objective lens assembly. This is the lens assembly at the front of the binoculars. It gathers light from the object and forms an image at the image plane.
* Image orientation correction assembly. This is usually a prism assembly that shortens the optical path. Without this, the image would be inverted and laterally reversed, which is inconvenient for the user.
* Eyepiece lens assembly. This is the lens assembly near the user&#x27;s eyes. Its function is to magnify the image.

Although different prism systems have optical design-induced advantages and disadvantages when compared, due to technological progress in fields like optical coatings, optical glass manufacturing, etcetera, differences in the early 2020s in high-quality binoculars practically became irrelevant. At high-quality price points, similar optical performance can be achieved with every commonly applied optical system. This was 20–30 years earlier not possible, as occurring optical disadvantages and problems could at that time not be technically mitigated to practical irrelevancy. Relevant differences in optical performance in the sub-high-quality price categories can still be observed with roof prism-type binoculars today because well-executed technical problem mitigation measures and narrow manufacturing tolerances remain difficult and cost-intensive.

== Optical parameters ==

Binoculars are usually designed for specific applications. These different designs require certain optical parameters which may be listed on the prism cover plate of the binoculars. Those parameters are:

=== Magnification ===
Given as the first number in a binocular description (e.g., 7×35, 10×50), magnification is the ratio of the focal length of the objective divided by the focal length of the eyepiece. This gives the magnifying power of binoculars (sometimes expressed as &quot;diameters&quot;). A magnification factor of 7, for example, produces an image 7 times larger than the original seen from that distance. The desirable amount of magnification depends upon the intended application, and in most binoculars is a permanent, non-adjustable feature of the device (zoom binoculars are the exception). Hand-held binoculars typically have magnifications ranging from 7× to 10×, so they will be less susceptible to the effects of shaking hands. A larger magnification leads to a smaller field of view and may require a tripod for image stability. Some specialized binoculars for astronomy or military use have magnifications ranging from 15× to 25×.

=== Objective diameter ===
Given as the second number in a binocular description (e.g., 7×35, 10×50), the diameter of the objective lens determines the resolution (sharpness) and how much light can be gathered to form an image. When two different binoculars have equal magnification, equal quality, and produce a sufficiently matched exit pupil (see below), the larger objective diameter produces a &quot;brighter&quot; and sharper image. An 8×40, then, will produce a &quot;brighter&quot; and sharper image than an 8×25, even though both enlarge the image an identical eight times. The larger front lenses in the 8×40 also produce wider beams of light (exit pupil) that leave the eyepieces. This makes it more comfortable to view with an 8×40 than an 8×25. A pair of 10×50 binoculars is better than a pair of 8×40 binoculars for magnification, sharpness and luminous flux. Objective diameter is usually expressed in millimeters. It is customary to categorize binoculars by the &quot;magnification&quot; × &quot;the objective diameter&quot;; e.g., &quot;7×50&quot;. Smaller binoculars may have a diameter of as low as 22 mm; 35 mm and 50 mm are common diameters for field binoculars; astronomical binoculars have diameters ranging from 70 mm to 150 mm.

=== Field of view ===
The field of view of a pair of binoculars depends on its optical design and in general is inversely proportional to the magnifying power. It is usually notated in a linear value, such as how many feet (meters) in width will be seen at 1,000 yards (or 1,000 m), or in an angular value of how many degrees can be viewed.

=== Exit pupil ===
Binoculars concentrate the light gathered by the objective into a beam, of which the diameter, the exit pupil, is the objective diameter divided by the magnifying power. For maximum effective light-gathering and brightest image, and to maximize the sharpness, the exit pupil should at least equal the diameter of the pupil of the human eye: about 7 mm at night and about 3 mm in the daytime, decreasing with age. If the cone of light streaming out of the binoculars is &quot;larger&quot; than the pupil it is going into, any light larger than the pupil is wasted. In daytime use, the human pupil is typically dilated about 3 mm, which is about the exit pupil of a 7×21 binocular. Much larger 7×50 binoculars will produce a (7.14 mm) cone of light bigger than the pupil it is entering, and this light will, in the daytime, be wasted. An exit pupil that is too &quot;small&quot; also will present an observer with a dimmer view, since only a small portion of the light-gathering surface of the retina is used. For applications where equipment must be carried (birdwatching, hunting), users opt for much smaller (lighter) binoculars with an exit pupil that matches their expected iris diameter so they will have maximum resolution but are not carrying the weight of wasted aperture.

A larger exit pupil makes it easier to put the eye where it can receive the light; anywhere in the large exit pupil cone of light will do. This ease of placement helps avoid, especially in large field of view binoculars, vignetting, which brings to the viewer an image with its borders darkened because the light from them is partially blocked, and it means that the image can be quickly found, which is important when looking at birds or game animals that move rapidly, or for a seafarer on the deck of a pitching vessel or observing from a moving vehicle. Narrow exit pupil binoculars also may be fatiguing because the instrument must be held exactly in place in front of the eyes to provide a useful image. Finally, many people use their binoculars at dawn, at dusk, in overcast conditions, or at night, when their pupils are larger. Thus, the daytime exit pupil is not a universally desirable standard. For comfort, ease of use, and flexibility in applications, larger binoculars with larger exit pupils are satisfactory choices even if their capability is not fully used by day.

=== Twilight factor and relative brightness ===
Before innovations like anti-reflective coatings were commonly used in binoculars, their performance was often mathematically expressed. Nowadays, the practically achievable instrumentally measurable brightness of binoculars rely on a complex mix of factors like the quality of optical glass used and various applied optical coatings and not just the magnification and the size of objective lenses.

The twilight factor for binoculars can be calculated by first multiplying the magnification by the objective lens diameter and then finding the square root of the result. For instance, the twilight factor of 7×50 binoculars is therefore the square root of 7 × 50: the square root of 350 = 18.71. The higher the twilight factor, mathematically, the better the resolution of the binoculars when observing under dim light conditions. Mathematically, 7×50 binoculars have exactly the same twilight factor as 70×5 ones, but 70×5 binoculars are useless during twilight and also in well-lit conditions as they would offer only a 0.14 mm exit pupil. The twilight factor without knowing the accompanying more decisive exit pupil does not permit a practical determination of the low light capability of binoculars. Ideally, the exit pupil should be at least as large as the pupil diameter of the user&#x27;s dark-adapted eyes in circumstances with no extraneous light.

A primarily historic, more meaningful mathematical approach to indicate the level of clarity and brightness in binoculars was relative brightness. It is calculated by squaring the diameter of the exit pupil. In the above 7×50 binoculars example, this means that their relative brightness index is 51 (7.14 × 7.14 = 51). The higher the relative brightness index number, mathematically, the better the binoculars are suited for low light use.

=== Eye relief ===
Eye relief is the distance from the rear eyepiece lens to the exit pupil or eye point. It is the distance the observer must position his or her eye behind the eyepiece in order to see an unvignetted image. The longer the focal length of the eyepiece, the greater the potential eye relief. Binoculars may have eye relief ranging from a few millimeters to 25 mm or more. Eye relief can be particularly important for eyeglasses wearers. The eye of an eyeglasses wearer is typically farther from the eye piece which necessitates a longer eye relief in order to avoid vignetting and, in the extreme cases, to conserve the entire field of view. Binoculars with short eye relief can also be hard to use in instances where it is difficult to hold them steady.

Eyeglasses wearers who intend to wear their glasses when using binoculars should look for binoculars with an eye relief that is long enough so that their eyes are not behind the point of focus (also called the eyepoint). Else, their glasses will occupy the space where their eyes should be. Generally, an eye relief over 16 mm should be adequate for any eyeglass wearer. However, if glasses frames are thicker and so significantly protrude from the face, an eye relief over 17 mm should be considered. Eyeglasses wearers should also look for binoculars with twist-up eye cups that ideally have multiple settings, so they can be partially or fully retracted to adjust eye relief to individual ergonomic preferences.

=== Close focus distance ===
Close focus distance is the closest point that the binocular can focus on. This distance varies from about , depending upon the design of the binoculars. If the close focus distance is short with respect to the magnification, the binocular can be used also to see particulars not visible to the naked eye.

=== Eyepieces ===

Binocular eyepieces usually consist of three or more lens elements in two or more groups. The lens furthest from the viewer&#x27;s eye is called the &quot;field lens&quot; or &quot;objective lens&quot; and that closest to the eye the &quot;eye lens&quot; or &quot;ocular lens&quot;. The most common Kellner configuration is that invented in 1849 by Carl Kellner. In this arrangement, the eye lens is a plano-concave/ double convex achromatic doublet (the flat part of the former facing the eye) and the field lens is a double-convex singlet. A reversed Kellner eyepiece was developed in 1975 and in it the field lens is a double concave/ double convex achromatic doublet and the eye lens is a double convex singlet. The reverse Kellner provides 50% more eye relief and works better with small focal ratios as well as having a slightly wider field.

Wide field binoculars typically utilize some kind of Erfle configuration, patented in 1921. These have five or six elements in three groups. The groups may be two achromatic doublets with a double convex singlet between them or may all be achromatic doublets. These eyepieces tend not to perform as well as Kellner eyepieces at high power because they suffer from astigmatism and ghost images. However they have large eye lenses, excellent eye relief, and are comfortable to use at lower powers.

==== Field flattener lens ====
High-end binoculars often incorporate a field flattener lens in the eyepiece behind their prism configuration, designed to improve image sharpness and reduce image distortion at the outer regions of the field of view.

== Mechanical design ==

=== Focus and adjustment ===

Binoculars have a focusing arrangement which changes the distance between eyepiece and objective lenses or internally mounted lens elements. Normally there are two different arrangements used to provide focus, &quot;independent focus&quot; and &quot;central focusing&quot;:
* &quot;Independent focusing&quot; is an arrangement where the two telescope tubes are focused independently by adjusting each eyepiece. Binoculars designed for harsh environmental conditions and heavy field use, such as military or marine applications, traditionally have used independent focusing.
* &quot;Central focusing&quot; is an arrangement which involves rotation of a central focusing wheel to adjust both telescope tubes together. In addition, one of the two eyepieces can be further adjusted to compensate for differences between the viewer&#x27;s eyes (usually by rotating the eyepiece in its mount). Because the focal change effected by the adjustable eyepiece can be measured in the customary unit of refractive power, the dioptre, the adjustable eyepiece itself is often called a &quot;dioptre&quot;. Once this adjustment has been made for a given viewer, the binoculars can be refocused on an object at a different distance by using the focusing wheel to adjust both tubes together without eyepiece readjustment.Central focusing binoculars can be further subdivided into:
** &quot;External focusing&quot;, which focuses binoculars by moving the eyepieces, where the volume of the binoculars always changes. During this process, external air and also small dust particles and moisture can be drawn into or pressed out of the binoculars. It is hard to seal or waterproof such systems and in case the eyepieces are moved by a central focuser shaft and external eyepiece arms bridge construction, this construction can (accidentally) get bent/deformed that can result in disabling misalignment.
** &quot;Internal focusing&quot;, which focuses binoculars by moving internal mounted optical lenses located between the objective lens group and the prism assembly – or rarely located between the prism assembly and eyepiece lens assembly – within the housing without changing the volume of the binoculars. The addition of a focusing lens reduces the light transmission of the optical system contained in the telescope tube somewhat. Internal focusing is generally considered the mechanically more robust central focusing solution and with the help of an appropriate seal like O-rings air and moisture ingress can be prevented, to make binoculars fully waterproof.

With increasing magnification, the depth of field – the distance between the nearest and the farthest objects that are in acceptably sharp focus in an image – decreases. The depth of field reduces quadratic with the magnification, so compared to 7× binoculars, 10× binoculars offer about half (7² ÷ 10² = 0.49) the depth of field. However, not related to the binoculars optical system, the user perceived practical depth of field or depth of acceptable view performance is also dependent on the accommodation ability (accommodation ability varies from person to person and decreases significantly with age) and light conditions dependent effective pupil size or diameter of the user&#x27;s eyes.
There are &quot;focus-free&quot; or &quot;fixed-focus&quot; binoculars that have no focusing mechanism other than the eyepiece adjustments that are meant to be set for the user&#x27;s eyes and left fixed. These are considered to be compromise designs, suited for convenience, but not well suited for work that falls outside their designed hyperfocal distance range (for hand held binoculars generally from about to infinity without performing eyepiece adjustments for a given viewer).

Binoculars can be generally used without eyeglasses by myopic (near-sighted) or hyperopic (far-sighted) users simply by adjusting the focus a little farther. Most manufacturers leave a little extra available focal-range beyond the infinity-stop/setting to account for this when focusing for infinity. People with severe astigmatism, however, will still need to use their glasses while using binoculars.

Some binoculars have adjustable magnification, &quot;zoom binoculars&quot;, such as 7-21×50 intended to give the user the flexibility of having a single pair of binoculars with a wide range of magnifications, usually by moving a &quot;zoom&quot; lever. This is accomplished by a complex series of adjusting lenses similar to a zoom camera lens. These designs are noted to be a compromise and even a gimmick since they add bulk, complexity and fragility to the binocular. The complex optical path also leads to a narrow field of view and a large drop in brightness at high zoom. Models also have to match the magnification for both eyes throughout the zoom range and hold collimation to avoid eye strain and fatigue. These almost always perform much better at the low power setting than they do at the higher settings. This is natural, since the front objective cannot enlarge to let in more light as the power is increased, so the view gets dimmer. At 7×, the 50mm front objective provides a 7.14 mm exit pupil, but at 21×, the same front objective provides only a 2.38 mm exit pupil. Also, the optical quality of a zoom binocular at any given power is inferior to that of a fixed power binocular of that power.

===Interpupillary distance===
Most modern binoculars are also adjustable via a hinged construction that enables the distance between the two telescope halves to be adjusted to accommodate viewers with different eye separation or &quot;interpupillary distance (IPD)&quot; (the distance measured in millimeters between the centers of the pupils of the eyes). Most are optimized for the interpupillary distance (typically about 63 mm) for adults. Interpupillary distance varies with respect to age, gender and race. The binoculars industry has to take IPD variance (most adults have IPDs in the 50–75 mm range) and its extrema into account, because stereoscopic optical products need to be able to cope with many possible users, including those with the smallest and largest IPDs.
Children and adults with narrow IPDs can experience problems with the IPD adjustment range of binocular barrels to match the width between the centers of the pupils in each eye impairing the use of some binoculars. Adults with average or wide IPDs generally experience no eye separation adjustment range problems, but straight barreled roof prism binoculars featuring over 60 mm diameter objectives can dimensionally be problematic to correctly adjust for adults with a relatively narrow IPDs. Anatomic conditions like hypertelorism and hypotelorism can affect IPD and due to extreme IPDs result in practical impairment of using stereoscopic optical products like binoculars.

=== Alignment ===
The two telescopes in binoculars are aligned in parallel (collimated), to produce a single circular, apparently three-dimensional, image. Misalignment will cause the binoculars to produce a double image. Even slight misalignment will cause vague discomfort and visual fatigue as the brain tries to combine the skewed images.

Alignment is performed by small movements to the prisms, by adjusting an internal support cell or by turning external set screws, or by adjusting the position of the objective via eccentric rings built into the objective cell.
&quot;Unconditional aligning&quot; (3-axis collimation, meaning both optical axes are aligned parallel with the axis of the hinge used to select various interpupillary distance settings) binoculars requires specialized equipment. Unconditional alignment is usually done by a professional, although the externally mounted adjustment features can usually be accessed by the end user.
&quot;Conditional alignment&quot; ignores the third axis (the hinge) in the alignment process. Such a conditional alignment comes down to a 2-axis pseudo-collimation and will only be serviceable within a small range of interpupillary distance settings, as conditional aligned binoculars are not collimated for the full interpupillary distance setting range.

=== Image stability ===
Some binoculars use image-stabilization technology to reduce shake at higher magnifications. This is done by having a gyroscope move part of the instrument, or by powered mechanisms driven by gyroscopic or inertial detectors, or via a mount designed to oppose and damp the effect of shaking movements. Stabilization may be enabled or disabled by the user as required. These techniques allow binoculars up to 20× to be hand-held, and much improve the image stability of lower-power instruments. There are some disadvantages: the image may not be quite as good as the best unstabilized binoculars when tripod-mounted, stabilized binoculars also tend to be more expensive and heavier than similarly specified non-stabilized binoculars.

=== Housing ===
Binoculars housings can be made of various structural materials. Old binoculars barrels and hinge bridges were often made of brass. Later steel and relatively light metals like aluminum and magnesium alloys were used, as well as polymers like (fibre-reinforced) polycarbonate and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. The housing can be rubber armored externally as outer covering to provide a non-slip gripping surface, absorption of undesired sounds and additional cushioning/protection against dents, scrapes, bumps and minor impacts.

== Optical coatings ==
Because a typical binocular has 6 to 10 optical elements with special characteristics and up to 20 atmosphere-to-glass surfaces, binocular manufacturers use different types of optical coatings for technical reasons and to improve the image they produce.
Lens and prism optical coatings on binoculars can increase light transmission, minimize detrimental reflections and interference effects, optimize beneficial reflections, repel water and grease and even protect the lens from scratches. Modern optical coatings are composed of a combination of very thin layers of materials such as oxides, metals, or rare earth materials. The performance of an optical coating is dependent on the number of layers, manipulating their exact thickness and composition, and the refractive index difference between them. These coatings have become a key technology in the field of optics and manufacturers often have their own designations for their optical coatings. The various lens and prism optical coatings used in high-quality 21st century binoculars, when added together, can total about 200 (often superimposed) coating layers.

===Anti-reflective===


Anti-reflective interference coatings reduce light lost at every optical surface through reflection at each surface. Reducing reflection via anti-reflective coatings also reduces the amount of &quot;lost&quot; light present inside the binocular which would otherwise make the image appear hazy (low contrast). A pair of binoculars with good optical coatings may yield a brighter image than uncoated binoculars with a larger objective lens, on account of superior light transmission through the assembly. The first transparent interference-based coating &quot;Transparentbelag (T)&quot; used by Zeiss was invented in 1935 by Olexander Smakula. A classic lens-coating material is magnesium fluoride, which reduces reflected light from about 4% to 1.5%. At 16 atmosphere to optical glass surfaces passes, a 4% reflection loss theoretically means a 52% light transmission ( = 0.520) and a 1.5% reflection loss a much better 78.5% light transmission ( = 0.785). Reflection can be further reduced over a wider range of wavelengths and angles by using several superimposed layers with different refractive indices. The anti-reflective multi-coating &quot;Transparentbelag* (T*)&quot; used by Zeiss in the late 1970s consisted of six superimposed layers. In general, the outer coating layers have slightly lower index of refraction values and the layer thickness is adapted to the range of wavelengths in the visible spectrum to promote optimal destructive interference via reflection in the beams reflected from the interfaces, and constructive interference in the corresponding transmitted beams. There is no simple formula for the optimal layer thickness for a given choice of materials. These parameters are therefore determined with the help of simulation programs. Determined by the optical properties of the lenses used and intended primary use of the binoculars, different coatings are preferred, to optimize light transmission dictated by the human eye luminous efficiency function variance. Maximal light transmission around wavelengths of 555 nm (green) is important for obtaining optimal photopic vision using the eye cone cells for observation in well-lit conditions. Maximal light transmission around wavelengths of 498 nm (cyan) is important for obtaining optimal scotopic vision using the eye rod cells for observation in low light conditions. As a result, effective modern anti-reflective lens coatings consist of complex multi-layers and reflect only 0.25% or less to yield an image with maximum brightness and natural colors. These allow high-quality 21st century binoculars to practically achieve at the eye lens or ocular lens measured over 90% light transmission values in low light conditions. Depending on the coating, the character of the image seen in the binoculars under normal daylight can either look &quot;warmer&quot; or &quot;colder&quot; and appear either with higher or lower contrast. Subject to the application, the coating is also optimized for maximum color fidelity through the visible spectrum, for example in the case of lenses specially designed for bird watching.
A common application technique is physical vapor deposition of one or more superimposed anti-reflective coating layer(s) which includes evaporative deposition, making it a complex production process.

===Phase correction===
In binoculars with roof prisms the light path is split into two paths that reflect on either side of the roof prism ridge. One half of the light reflects from roof surface 1 to roof surface 2. The other half of the light reflects from roof surface 2 to roof surface 1. If the roof faces are uncoated, the mechanism of reflection is Total Internal Reflection (TIR). In TIR, light polarized in the plane of incidence (p-polarized) and light polarized orthogonal to the plane of incidence (s-polarized) experience different phase shifts. As a consequence, linearly polarized light emerges from a roof prism elliptically polarized. Furthermore, the state of elliptical polarization of the two paths through the prism is different. When the two paths recombine on the retina (or a detector) there is interference between light from the two paths causing a distortion of the Point Spread Function and a deterioration of the image. Resolution and contrast significantly suffer. These unwanted interference effects can be suppressed by vapor depositing a special dielectric coating known as a &quot;phase-correction coating&quot; or &quot;P-coating&quot; on the roof surfaces of the roof prism. To approximately correct a roof prism for polychromatic light several phase-correction coating layers are superimposed, since every layer is wavelength and angle of incidence specific. 
The &quot;P-coating&quot; was developed in 1988 by Adolf Weyrauch at Carl Zeiss.
Other manufacturers followed soon, and since then phase-correction coatings are used across the board in medium and high-quality roof prism binoculars. This coating suppresses the difference in phase shift between s- and p- polarization so both paths have the same polarization and no interference degrades the image. In this way, since the 1990s, roof prism binoculars have also achieved resolution values that were previously only achievable with Porro prisms. The presence of a phase-correction coating can be checked on unopened binoculars using two polarization filters. Dielectric phase-correction prism coatings are applied in a vacuum chamber with maybe thirty or more different superimposed vapor coating layers deposits, making it a complex production process.

Binoculars using either a Schmidt–Pechan roof prism, Abbe–Koenig roof prism or an Uppendahl roof prism benefit from phase coatings that compensate for a loss of resolution and contrast caused by the interference effects that occur in untreated roof prisms. Porro prism and Perger prism binoculars do not split beams and therefore they do not require any phase coatings.

=== Metallic mirror ===

In binoculars with Schmidt–Pechan or Uppendahl roof prisms, mirror coatings are added to some surfaces of the roof prism because the light is incident at one of the prism&#x27;s glass-air boundaries at an angle less than the critical angle so total internal reflection does not occur. Without a mirror coating most of that light would be lost. Roof prism aluminum mirror coating (reflectivity of 87% to 93%) or silver mirror coating (reflectivity of 95% to 98%) is used.

In older designs silver mirror coatings were used but these coatings oxidized and lost reflectivity over time in unsealed binoculars. Aluminum mirror coatings were used in later unsealed designs because they did not tarnish even though they have a lower reflectivity than silver. Using vacuum-vaporization technology, modern designs use either aluminum, enhanced aluminum (consisting of aluminum overcoated with a multilayer dielectric film) or silver. Silver is used in modern high-quality designs which are sealed and filled with nitrogen or argon to provide an inert atmosphere so that the silver mirror coating does not tarnish.

Porro prism and Perger prism binoculars and roof prism binoculars using the Abbe–Koenig roof prism configuration do not use mirror coatings because these prisms reflect with 100% reflectivity using total internal reflection in the prism rather than requiring a (metallic) mirror coating.

=== Dielectric mirror ===


Dielectric coatings are used in Schmidt–Pechan and Uppendahl roof prisms to cause the prism surfaces to act as a dielectric mirror. This coating was introduced in 2004 in Zeiss Victory FL binoculars featuring Schmidt–Pechan prisms. Other manufacturers followed soon, and since then dielectric coatings are used across the board in medium and high-quality Schmidt–Pechan and Uppendahl roof prism binoculars. The non-metallic dielectric reflective coating is formed from several multilayers of alternating high and low refractive index materials deposited on a prism&#x27;s reflective surfaces. The manufacturing techniques for dielectric mirrors are based on thin-film deposition methods. A common application technique is physical vapor deposition which includes evaporative deposition with maybe seventy or more different superimposed vapor coating layers deposits, making it a complex production process. This multilayer coating increases reflectivity from the prism surfaces by acting as a distributed Bragg reflector. A well-designed multilayer dielectric coating can provide a reflectivity of over 99% across the visible light spectrum. This reflectivity is an improvement compared to either an aluminium mirror coating or silver mirror coating.

Porro prism and Perger prism binoculars and roof prism binoculars using the Abbe–Koenig roof prism do not use dielectric coatings because these prisms reflect with 100% reflectivity using total internal reflection in the prism rather than requiring a (dielectric) mirror coating.

== Applications ==

=== General use ===

Hand-held binoculars range from small 3 × 10 Galilean opera glasses, used in theaters, to glasses with 7 to 12 times magnification and 30 to 50 mm diameter objectives for typical outdoor use.

Compact or pocket binoculars are small light binoculars suitable for daytime use. Most compact binoculars feature magnifications of 7× to 10×, and objective diameter sizes of a relatively modest 20 mm to 25 mm, resulting in small exit pupil sizes limiting low light suitability. Roof prism designs tend to be narrower and more compact than equivalent Porro prism designs. Thus, compact binoculars are mostly roof prism designs. The telescope tubes of compact binoculars can often be folded closely to each other to radically reduce the binocular&#x27;s volume when not in use, for easy carriage and storage.

Many tourist attractions have installed pedestal-mounted, coin-operated binocular tower viewers to allow visitors to obtain a closer view of the attraction.

=== Land surveys and geographic data collection ===
Although technology has surpassed using binoculars for data collection, historically these were advanced tools used by geographers and other geoscientists. Field glasses still today can provide visual aid when surveying large areas.

=== Bird watching ===
Birdwatching is a very popular hobby among nature and animal lovers; a binocular is their most basic tool because most human eyes cannot resolve sufficient detail to fully appreciate and/or study small birds. To be able to view birds in flight well rapid moving objects acquiring capability and depth of field are important. Typically, binoculars with a magnification of 8× to 10× are used, though many manufacturers produce models with 7× magnification for a wider field of view and increased depth of field. The other main consideration for birdwatching binoculars is the size of the objective that collects light. A larger (e.g. 40–45mm) objective works better in low light and for seeing into foliage, but also makes for a heavier binocular than a 30–35mm objective. Weight may not seem a primary consideration when first hefting a pair of binoculars, but birdwatching involves a lot of holding up the binoculars while standing in one place. Careful shopping is advised by the birdwatching community.

=== Hunting ===
Hunters commonly use binoculars in the field as a way to observe distant game animals. Hunters most commonly use about 8× magnification binoculars with 40–45mm objectives to be able to find and observe game in low light conditions. European manufacturers produced and produce 7×42 binoculars with good low light performance without getting too bulky for mobile use like extended carrying/stalking and much bigger bulky 8×56 and 9×63 low-light binoculars optically optimized for excellent low light performance for more stationary hunting at dusk and night. For hunting binoculars optimized for observation in twilight, coatings are preferred that maximize light transmission in the wavelength range around 460-540 nm.

=== Range finding ===

Some binoculars have a range finding reticle (scale) superimposed upon the view. This scale allows the distance to the object to be estimated if the object&#x27;s height is known (or estimable). The common mariner 7×50 binoculars have these scales with the angle between marks equal to 5 mil. One mil is equivalent to the angle between the top and bottom of an object one meter in height at a distance of 1000 meters.

Therefore, to estimate the distance to an object that is a known height the formula is:

:formula_1
where:
* formula_2 is the &quot;Distance&quot; to the object in meters.
* formula_3 is the known &quot;Object Height&quot;.
* formula_4 is the angular height of the object in number of &quot;Mil&quot;.

With the typical 5 mil scale (each mark is 5 mil), a lighthouse that is 3 marks high and known to be 120 meters tall is 8000 meters distant.

:formula_5

=== Military ===

Binoculars have a long history of military use. Galilean designs were widely used up to the end of the 19th century when they gave way to porro prism types. Binoculars constructed for general military use tend to be more rugged than their civilian counterparts. They generally avoid fragile center focus arrangements in favor of independent focus, which also makes for easier, more effective weatherproofing. Prism sets in military binoculars may have redundant aluminized coatings on their prism sets to guarantee they do not lose their reflective qualities if they get wet.

One variant form was called &quot;trench binoculars&quot;, a combination of binoculars and periscope, often used for artillery spotting purposes. It projected only a few inches above the parapet, thus keeping the viewer&#x27;s head safely in the trench.

Military binoculars can and were also used as measuring and aiming devices, and can feature filters and (illuminated) reticles.

Military binoculars of the Cold War era were sometimes fitted with passive sensors that detected active IR emissions, while modern ones usually are fitted with filters blocking laser beams used as weapons. Further, binoculars designed for military usage may include a stadiametric reticle in one eyepiece in order to facilitate range estimation.
Modern binoculars designed for military usage can also feature laser rangefinders, compasses, and data exchange interfaces to send measurements to other peripheral devices.

Very large binocular naval rangefinders (up to 15 meters separation of the two objective lenses, weight 10 tons, for ranging World War II naval gun targets 25 km away) have been used, although late-20th century radar and laser range finding technology made this application mostly redundant.

===Marine===

There are binoculars designed specifically for civilian and military use under harsh environmental conditions at sea. Hand held models will be 5× to 8× magnification, but with very large prism sets combined with eyepieces designed to give generous eye relief. This optical combination prevents the image vignetting or going dark when the binoculars are pitching and vibrating relative to the viewer&#x27;s eyes due to a vessel&#x27;s motion.

Marine binoculars often contain one or more features to aid in navigation on ships and boats.

Hand held marine binoculars typically feature:
* Sealed interior: O-rings or other seals prevent air and moisture ingress.
* Nitrogen or argon filled interior: the interior is filled with &#x27;dry&#x27; gas to prevent internal fogging/tarnishing of the optical surfaces. As fungi can not grow in the presence of an inert or noble gas atmosphere, it also prevents lens fungus formation.
* Independent focusing: this method aids in providing a durable, sealed interior.
* Reticle scale: a navigational aid which uses a horizon line and a vertical scale for measuring the distance of objects of known width or height – sometimes an important navigational aid.
* Compass: A compass bearing projected in the image. Dampening helps to read the compass bearing on a moving ship or boat.
* Floating strap: some marine binoculars float on water, to prevent sinking. Marine binoculars that do not float are sometime supplied with or provided by the user as an aftermarket accessory with a strap that will function as a flotation device.

Mariners also often deem an adequate low light performance of the optical combination important, explaining the many 7×50 hand held marine binoculars offerings featuring a large 7.14 mm exit pupil, which corresponds to the average pupil size of a youthful dark-adapted human eye in circumstances with no extraneous light.

Civilian and military ships can also use large, high-magnification binocular models with large objectives in fixed mountings.

=== Astronomical ===
Binoculars are widely used by amateur astronomers; their wide field of view makes them useful for comet and supernova seeking (giant binoculars) and general observation (portable binoculars). Binoculars specifically geared towards astronomical viewing will have larger aperture objectives (in the 70 mm or 80 mm range) because the diameter of the objective lens increases the total amount of light captured, and therefore determines the faintest star that can be observed. Binoculars designed specifically for astronomical viewing (often 80 mm and larger) are sometimes designed without prisms in order to allow maximum light transmission. Such binoculars also usually have changeable eyepieces to vary magnification. Binoculars with high magnification and heavy weight usually require some sort of mount to stabilize the image. A magnification of 10x is generally considered the practical limit for observation with handheld binoculars. Binoculars more powerful than 15×70 require support of some type. Much larger binoculars have been made by amateur telescope makers, essentially using two refracting or reflecting astronomical telescopes.

Of particular relevance for low-light and astronomical viewing is the ratio between magnifying power and objective lens diameter. A lower magnification facilitates a larger field of view which is useful in viewing the Milky Way and large nebulous objects (referred to as deep sky objects) such as the nebulae and galaxies. The large (typical 7.14 mm using 7×50) exit pupil [objective (mm)/power] of these devices results in a small portion of the gathered light not being usable by individuals whose pupils do not sufficiently dilate. For example, the pupils of those over 50 rarely dilate over 5 mm wide. The large exit pupil also collects more light from the background sky, effectively decreasing contrast, making the detection of faint objects more difficult except perhaps in remote locations with negligible light pollution. Many astronomical objects of 8 magnitude or brighter, such as the star clusters, nebulae and galaxies listed in the Messier Catalog, are readily viewed in hand-held binoculars in the 35 to 40 mm range, as are found in many households for birding, hunting, and viewing sports events. For observing smaller star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies binocular magnification is an important factor for visibility because these objects appear tiny at typical binocular magnifications.

Some open clusters, such as the bright double cluster (NGC 869 and NGC 884) in the constellation Perseus, and globular clusters, such as M13 in Hercules, are easy to spot. Among nebulae, M17 in Sagittarius and the North America Nebula (NGC 7000) in Cygnus are also readily viewed. Binoculars can show a few of the wider-split binary stars such as Albireo in the constellation Cygnus.

A number of Solar System objects that are mostly to completely invisible to the human eye are reasonably detectable with medium-size binoculars, including larger craters on the Moon; the dim outer planets Uranus and Neptune; the inner &quot;minor planets&quot; Ceres, Vesta and Pallas; Saturn&#x27;s largest moon Titan; and the Galilean moons of Jupiter. Although visible unaided in pollution-free skies, Uranus and Vesta require binoculars for easy detection. 10×50 binoculars are limited to an apparent magnitude of +9.5 to +11 depending on sky conditions and observer experience. Asteroids like Interamnia, Davida, Europa and, unless under exceptional conditions, Hygiea, are too faint to be seen with commonly sold binoculars. Likewise too faint to be seen with most binoculars are the planetary moons, except the Galileans and Titan, and the dwarf planets Pluto and Eris. Other difficult binocular targets include the phases of Venus and the rings of Saturn. Only binoculars with very high magnification, 20x or higher, are capable of discerning Saturn&#x27;s rings to a recognizable extent. High-power binoculars can sometimes show one or two cloud belts on the disk of Jupiter, if optics and observing conditions are sufficiently good.

Binoculars can also aid in observation of human-made space objects, such as spotting satellites in the sky as they pass.

<doc id="86061" wikidata="Q332674" url="?curid=86061" title="Cygnus X-1">
<text>Cygnus X-1 (abbreviated Cyg X-1) is a galactic X-ray source in the constellation Cygnus and was the first such source widely accepted to be a black hole. It was discovered in 1964 during a rocket flight and is one of the strongest X-ray sources detectable from Earth, producing a peak X-ray flux density of (). It remains among the most studied astronomical objects in its class. The compact object is now estimated to have a mass about 21.2 times the mass of the Sun and has been shown to be too small to be any known kind of normal star or other likely object besides a black hole. If so, the radius of its event horizon has &quot;as upper bound to the linear dimension of the source region&quot; of occasional X-ray bursts lasting only for about 1 ms.

Cygnus X-1 belongs to a high-mass X-ray binary system, located about 2.22 kiloparsecs from the Sun, that includes a blue supergiant variable star designated HDE 226868, which it orbits at about 0.2 AU, or 20% of the distance from Earth to the Sun. A stellar wind from the star provides material for an accretion disk around the X-ray source. Matter in the inner disk is heated to millions of degrees, generating the observed X-rays. A pair of relativistic jets, arranged perpendicularly to the disk, are carrying part of the energy of the infalling material away into interstellar space.

This system may belong to a stellar association called Cygnus OB3, which would mean that Cygnus X-1 is about 5 million years old and formed from a star that had more than . The majority of the star&#x27;s mass was shed, most likely as a stellar wind. If this star had then exploded as a supernova, the resulting force would most likely have ejected the remnant from the system. Hence the star may have instead collapsed directly into a black hole.

Cygnus X-1 was the subject of a friendly scientific wager between physicists Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne in 1975, with Hawking—betting that it was not a black hole—hoping to lose. Hawking conceded the bet in 1990 after observational data had strengthened the case that there was indeed a black hole in the system. , this hypothesis lacked direct empirical evidence but was generally accepted based on indirect evidence.

==Discovery and observation==
Observation of X-ray emissions allows astronomers to study celestial phenomena involving gas with temperatures in the millions of degrees. However, because X-ray emissions are blocked by Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, observation of celestial X-ray sources is not possible without lifting instruments to altitudes where the X-rays can penetrate. Cygnus X-1 was discovered using X-ray instruments that were carried aloft by a sounding rocket launched from White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. As part of an ongoing effort to map these sources, a survey was conducted in 1964 using two Aerobee suborbital rockets. The rockets carried Geiger counters to measure X-ray emission in wavelength range 1– across an 8.4° section of the sky. These instruments swept across the sky as the rockets rotated, producing a map of closely spaced scans.

As a result of these surveys, eight new sources of cosmic X-rays were discovered, including Cyg XR-1 (later Cyg X-1) in the constellation Cygnus. The celestial coordinates of this source were estimated as right ascension 19h53m and declination 34.6°. It was not associated with any especially prominent radio or optical source at that position.

Seeing a need for longer-duration studies, in 1963 Riccardo Giacconi and Herb Gursky proposed the first orbital satellite to study X-ray sources. NASA launched their Uhuru satellite in 1970, which led to the discovery of 300 new X-ray sources. Extended Uhuru observations of Cygnus X-1 showed fluctuations in the X-ray intensity that occurs several times a second. This rapid variation meant that the X-ray generation must occur over a compact region no larger than ~ (roughly the size of Jupiter), as the speed of light restricts communication between more distant regions.

In April–May 1971, Luc Braes and George K. Miley from Leiden Observatory, and independently Robert M. Hjellming and Campbell Wade at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, detected radio emission from Cygnus X-1, and their accurate radio position pinpointed the X-ray source to the star AGK2 +35 1910 = HDE 226868. On the celestial sphere, this star lies about half a degree from the 4th-magnitude star Eta Cygni. It is a supergiant star that is by itself incapable of emitting the observed quantities of X-rays. Hence, the star must have a companion that could heat gas to the millions of degrees needed to produce the radiation source for Cygnus X-1.

Louise Webster and Paul Murdin, at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and Charles Thomas Bolton, working independently at the University of Toronto&#x27;s David Dunlap Observatory, announced the discovery of a massive hidden companion to HDE 226868 in 1972. Measurements of the Doppler shift of the star&#x27;s spectrum demonstrated the companion&#x27;s presence and allowed its mass to be estimated from the orbital parameters. Based on the high predicted mass of the object, they surmised that it may be a black hole, as the largest possible neutron star cannot exceed three times the mass of the Sun.

With further observations strengthening the evidence, by the end of 1973 the astronomical community generally conceded that Cygnus X-1 was most likely a black hole. More precise measurements of Cygnus X-1 demonstrated variability down to a single millisecond. This interval is consistent with turbulence in a disk of accreted matter surrounding a black hole—the accretion disk. X-ray bursts that last for about a third of a second match the expected time frame of matter falling toward a black hole.
Cygnus X-1 has since been studied extensively using observations by orbiting and ground-based instruments. The similarities between the emissions of X-ray binaries such as HDE 226868/Cygnus X-1 and active galactic nuclei suggests a common mechanism of energy generation involving a black hole, an orbiting accretion disk and associated jets. For this reason, Cygnus X-1 is identified among a class of objects called microquasars; an analog of the quasars, or quasi-stellar radio sources, now known to be distant active galactic nuclei. Scientific studies of binary systems such as HDE 226868/Cygnus X-1 may lead to further insights into the mechanics of active galaxies.

==Binary system==
The compact object and blue supergiant star form a binary system in which they orbit around their center of mass every 5.599829 days. From the perspective of Earth, the compact object never goes behind the other star; in other words, the system does not eclipse. However, the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight from Earth remains uncertain, with predictions ranging from 27° to 65°. A 2007 study estimated the inclination as , which would mean that the semi-major axis is about , or 20% of the distance from Earth to the Sun. The orbital eccentricity is thought to be only , meaning a nearly circular orbit. Earth&#x27;s distance to this system is calculated by trigonometric parallax as , and by radio astrometry as .
The HDE 226868/Cygnus X-1 system shares a common motion through space with an association of massive stars named Cygnus OB3, which is located at roughly 2000 parsecs from the Sun. This implies that HDE 226868, Cygnus X-1 and this OB association may have formed at the same time and location. If so, then the age of the system is about . The motion of HDE 226868 with respect to Cygnus OB3 is , a typical value for random motion within a stellar association. HDE 226868 is about from the center of the association and could have reached that separation in about —which roughly agrees with estimated age of the association.

With a galactic latitude of 4° and galactic longitude 71°, this system lies inward along the same Orion Spur, in which the Sun is located within the Milky Way, near where the spur approaches the Sagittarius Arm. Cygnus X-1 has been described as belonging to the Sagittarius Arm, though the structure of the Milky Way is not well established.

===Compact object===
From various techniques, the mass of the compact object appears to be greater than the maximum mass for a neutron star. Stellar evolutionary models suggest a mass of , while other techniques resulted in 10 solar masses. Measuring periodicities in the X-ray emission near the object yielded a more precise value of . In all cases, the object is most likely a black hole—a region of space with a gravitational field that is strong enough to prevent the escape of electromagnetic radiation from the interior. The boundary of this region is called the event horizon and has an effective radius called the Schwarzschild radius, which is about for Cygnus X-1. Anything (including matter and photons) that passes through this boundary is unable to escape. New measurements published in 2021 yielded an estimated mass of .

Evidence of just such an event horizon may have been detected in 1992 using ultraviolet (UV) observations with the High Speed Photometer on the Hubble Space Telescope. As self-luminous clumps of matter spiral into a black hole, their radiation is emitted in a series of pulses that are subject to gravitational redshift as the material approaches the horizon. That is, the wavelengths of the radiation steadily increase, as predicted by general relativity. Matter hitting a solid, compact object would emit a final burst of energy, whereas material passing through an event horizon would not. Two such &quot;dying pulse trains&quot; were observed, which is consistent with the existence of a black hole.

The spin of the compact object is not yet well determined. Past analysis of data from the space-based Chandra X-ray Observatory suggested that Cygnus X-1 was not rotating to any significant degree. However, evidence announced in 2011 suggests that it is rotating extremely rapidly, approximately 790 times per second.

====Formation====
The largest star in the Cygnus OB3 association has a mass 40 times that of the Sun. As more massive stars evolve more rapidly, this implies that the progenitor star for Cygnus X-1 had more than 40 solar masses. Given the current estimated mass of the black hole, the progenitor star must have lost over 30 solar masses of material. Part of this mass may have been lost to HDE 226868, while the remainder was most likely expelled by a strong stellar wind. The helium enrichment of HDE 226868&#x27;s outer atmosphere may be evidence for this mass transfer. Possibly the progenitor may have evolved into a Wolf–Rayet star, which ejects a substantial proportion of its atmosphere using just such a powerful stellar wind.

If the progenitor star had exploded as a supernova, then observations of similar objects show that the remnant would most likely have been ejected from the system at a relatively high velocity. As the object remained in orbit, this indicates that the progenitor may have collapsed directly into a black hole without exploding (or at most produced only a relatively modest explosion).

====Accretion disk====
The compact object is thought to be orbited by a thin, flat disk of accreting matter known as an accretion disk. This disk is intensely heated by friction between ionized gas in faster-moving inner orbits and that in slower outer ones. It is divided into a hot inner region with a relatively high level of ionization—forming a plasma—and a cooler, less ionized outer region that extends to an estimated 500 times the Schwarzschild radius, or about 15,000 km.

Though highly and erratically variable, Cygnus X-1 is typically the brightest persistent source of hard X-rays—those with energies from about 30 up to several hundred kiloelectronvolts—in the sky. The X-rays are produced as lower-energy photons in the thin inner accretion disk, then given more energy through Compton scattering with very high-temperature electrons in a geometrically thicker, but nearly transparent corona enveloping it, as well as by some further reflection from the surface of the thin disk. An alternative possibility is that the X-rays may be Compton-scattered by the base of a jet instead of a disk corona.

The X-ray emission from Cygnus X-1 can vary in a somewhat repetitive pattern called quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO). The mass of the compact object appears to determine the distance at which the surrounding plasma begins to emit these QPOs, with the emission radius decreasing as the mass decreases. This technique has been used to estimate the mass of Cygnus X-1, providing a cross-check with other mass derivations.

Pulsations with a stable period, similar to those resulting from the spin of a neutron star, have never been seen from Cygnus X-1. The pulsations from neutron stars are caused by the neutron star&#x27;s rotating magnetic field, but the no-hair theorem guarantees that the magnetic field of a black hole is exactly aligned with its rotation axis and thus is static. For example, the X-ray binary V 0332+53 was thought to be a possible black hole until pulsations were found. Cygnus X-1 has also never displayed X-ray bursts similar to those seen from neutron stars. Cygnus X-1 unpredictably changes between two X-ray states, although the X-rays may vary continuously between those states as well. In the most common state, the X-rays are &quot;hard&quot;, which means that more of the X-rays have high energy. In the less common state, the X-rays are &quot;soft&quot;, with more of the X-rays having lower energy. The soft state also shows greater variability. The hard state is believed to originate in a corona surrounding the inner part of the more opaque accretion disk. The soft state occurs when the disk draws closer to the compact object (possibly as close as ), accompanied by cooling or ejection of the corona. When a new corona is generated, Cygnus X-1 transitions back to the hard state.

The spectral transition of Cygnus X-1 can be explained using a two-component advective flow solution, as proposed by Chakrabarti and Titarchuk. A hard state is generated by the inverse Comptonisation of seed photons from the Keplarian disk and likewise synchrotron photons produced by the hot electrons in the centrifugal-pressure–supported boundary layer (CENBOL).

The X-ray flux from Cygnus X-1 varies periodically every 5.6 days, especially during superior conjunction when the orbiting objects are most closely aligned with Earth and the compact source is the more distant. This indicates that the emissions are being partially blocked by circumstellar matter, which may be the stellar wind from the star HDE 226868. There is a roughly 300-day periodicity in the emission, which could be caused by the precession of the accretion disk.

====Jets====
As accreted matter falls toward the compact object, it loses gravitational potential energy. Part of this released energy is dissipated by jets of particles, aligned perpendicular to the accretion disk, that flow outward with relativistic velocities (that is, the particles are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light). This pair of jets provide a means for an accretion disk to shed excess energy and angular momentum. They may be created by magnetic fields within the gas that surrounds the compact object.

The Cygnus X-1 jets are inefficient radiators and so release only a small proportion of their energy in the electromagnetic spectrum. That is, they appear &quot;dark&quot;. The estimated angle of the jets to the line of sight is 30°, and they may be precessing. One of the jets is colliding with a relatively dense part of the interstellar medium (ISM), forming an energized ring that can be detected by its radio emission. This collision appears to be forming a nebula that has been observed in the optical wavelengths. To produce this nebula, the jet must have an estimated average power of 4–, or . This is more than 1,000 times the power emitted by the Sun. There is no corresponding ring in the opposite direction because that jet is facing a lower-density region of the ISM.

In 2006, Cygnus X-1 became the first stellar-mass black hole found to display evidence of gamma-ray emission in the very high-energy band, above . The signal was observed at the same time as a flare of hard X-rays, suggesting a link between the events. The X-ray flare may have been produced at the base of the jet, while the gamma rays could have been generated where the jet interacts with the stellar wind of HDE 226868.

===HDE 226868===

HDE 226868 is a supergiant star with a spectral class of O9.7 Iab, which is on the borderline between class-O and class-B stars. It has an estimated surface temperature of 31,000 K and mass approximately 20–40 times the mass of the Sun. Based on a stellar evolutionary model, at the estimated distance of 2,000 parsecs, this star may have a radius equal to about 15–17 times the solar radius and has approximately 300,000–400,000 times the luminosity of the Sun. For comparison, the compact object is estimated to be orbiting HDE 226868 at a distance of about 40 solar radii, or twice the radius of this star.

The surface of HDE 226868 is being tidally distorted by the gravity of the massive companion, forming a tear-drop shape that is further distorted by rotation. This causes the optical brightness of the star to vary by 0.06 magnitudes during each 5.6-day binary orbit, with the minimum magnitude occurring when the system is aligned with the line of sight. The &quot;ellipsoidal&quot; pattern of light variation results from the limb darkening and gravity darkening of the star&#x27;s surface.

When the spectrum of HDE 226868 is compared to the similar star Alnilam, the former shows an overabundance of helium and an underabundance of carbon in its atmosphere. The ultraviolet and hydrogen-alpha spectral lines of HDE 226868 show profiles similar to the star P Cygni, which indicates that the star is surrounded by a gaseous envelope that is being accelerated away from the star at speeds of about 1,500 km/s.

Like other stars of its spectral type, HDE 226868 is thought to be shedding mass in a stellar wind at an estimated rate of solar masses per year; or one solar mass every 400,000 years. The gravitational influence of the compact object appears to be reshaping this stellar wind, producing a focused wind geometry rather than a spherically symmetrical wind. X-rays from the region surrounding the compact object heat and ionize this stellar wind. As the object moves through different regions of the stellar wind during its 5.6-day orbit, the UV lines, the radio emission, and the X-rays themselves all vary.

The Roche lobe of HDE 226868 defines the region of space around the star where orbiting material remains gravitationally bound. Material that passes beyond this lobe may fall toward the orbiting companion. This Roche lobe is believed to be close to the surface of HDE 226868 but not overflowing, so the material at the stellar surface is not being stripped away by its companion. However, a significant proportion of the stellar wind emitted by the star is being drawn onto the compact object&#x27;s accretion disk after passing beyond this lobe.

The gas and dust between the Sun and HDE 226868 results in a reduction in the apparent magnitude of the star, as well as a reddening of the hue—red light can more effectively penetrate the dust in the interstellar medium. The estimated value of the interstellar extinction (&quot;AV&quot;) is 3.3 magnitudes. Without the intervening matter, HDE 226868 would be a fifth-magnitude star, and thus visible to the unaided eye.

==Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne==

Cygnus X-1 was the subject of a bet between physicists Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne, in which Hawking bet against the existence of black holes in the region. Hawking later described this as an &quot;insurance policy&quot; of sorts. In his book &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; he wrote:

According to the updated tenth-anniversary edition of &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;, Hawking has conceded the bet due to subsequent observational data in favor of black holes. In his own book &quot;Black Holes and Time Warps&quot;, Thorne reports that Hawking conceded the bet by breaking into Thorne&#x27;s office while he was in Russia, finding the framed bet, and signing it. While Hawking referred to the bet as taking place in 1975, the written bet itself (in Thorne&#x27;s handwriting, with his and Hawking&#x27;s signatures) bears additional witness signatures under a legend stating &quot;Witnessed this tenth day of December 1974&quot;. This date was confirmed by Kip Thorne on the January 10, 2018 episode of &quot;Nova&quot; on PBS.

== In popular culture ==
Cygnus X-1 is the subject of a two-part song series by Canadian progressive rock band Rush. The first part, &quot;Book I: The Voyage&quot;, is the last song on the 1977 album &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot;. The second part, &quot;Book II: Hemispheres&quot;, is the first song on the following 1978 album, &quot;Hemispheres&quot;. The lyrics describe an explorer aboard the spaceship &quot;Rocinante&quot;, who travels to the black hole, believing that there may be something beyond it. As he moves closer, it becomes increasingly difficult to control the ship, and he is eventually drawn in by the pull of gravity.

In the 1979 Disney live-action science fiction film &quot;The Black Hole&quot;, the scientific survey ship captained by Dr. Hans Reinhardt to study the black hole of the film&#x27;s title is the &quot;Cygnus&quot;, presumably (although never stated as such) named for the first-identified black hole, Cygnus X-1.

<text>In Irish mythology, Balor or Balar was a leader of the Fomorians, a group of malevolent supernatural beings, and considered the most formidable. He is often described as a giant with a large eye that wreaks destruction when opened. Balor takes part in the Battle of Mag Tuired, and is primarily known from the tale in which he is killed by his grandson Lugh of the Tuatha Dé Danann. He has been interpreted as a personification of the scorching sun, and has also been likened to figures from other mythologies, such as the Welsh Ysbaddaden and the Greek Cyclops. 

==Name==
The name &quot;Balor&quot; may come from Common Celtic &quot;*Boleros&quot;, meaning &quot;the flashing one&quot;.

In the early literature he is also referred to as &quot;Balor Béimnech&quot; (Balor the smiter), &quot;Balor Balcbéimnech&quot; (Balor the strong smiter), &quot;Balor Birugderc&quot; (Balor of the piercing-eye), &quot;Balor mac Doit meic Néid&quot; (Balor, son of Dot son of Nét) or &quot;Balor ua Néit&quot; (Balor, grandson of Nét).

Later forms are &quot;Balor Béimeann&quot; or &quot;Balar Bemen&quot; (&quot;Ogygia&quot;, 1685), and &quot;Balór na Súile Nimhe&quot; (Balor of the Evil Eye).

==Mythological Cycle==
Balor first appears in the medieval texts that make up the Mythological Cycle.

Balor was the son of Dot son of Néit according to the &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot; (&quot;CMT&quot;), but called Balor son of Buarainech in the list of renowned rath- and castle-builders of the world, preserved in the &quot;Book of Leinster&quot;. Cethlenn was Balor&#x27;s wife according to O&#x27;Flaherty&#x27;s &quot;Ogygia&quot; (1685). Cethlenn is mentioned by name in the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; (&quot;LGE&quot;), but not as a wife of Balor.

The Mythological Cycle tells of a struggle between the divine Tuatha Dé Danann and the demonic Fomorians. At the behest of Bres, the Fomorians go to war against the Tuath Dé. Balor appears as champion of the Fomorians and king of the Isles (the Hebrides), while Indech mac De was the Fomorian king; the two of them leading the Fomorian army. Balor built for Bres the fort of Rath Breisi in Connacht, according to the rath-builder list.

In the ensuing battle, the second Battle of Mag Tuired, Balor kills the Tuath Dé king Nuada Airgetlám, but Balor is himself killed by his own grandson Lugh before he had a chance to use his destructive eye. Balor&#x27;s eye wreaked destruction when opened, unleashing some &quot;power of poison&quot;, but it took the strength of four warriors to lift the eyelid, by grabbing the ring (handle) attached to it. Lugh shot a sling-stone (, &quot;stone from the sling&quot;) at the eye, which came out the other side and harmed the Fomorian army. Balor&#x27;s falling body crushed 27 Fomorian soldiers, and his head struck their king Indech.

Though not stated outright, the supposition is that Balor here is a &quot;one-eyed giant&quot;. In one account of the battle, Lugh also killed a Fomorian leader named Goll (meaning &quot;one-eyed&quot;), who may be a duplication of Balor. The &quot;CMT&quot; says that Balor&#x27;s eye gained its baleful power from exposure to the fumes from the magic potion his father&#x27;s druids were brewing. O&#x27;Curry tantalizingly stated he was in possession of a manuscript with an alternate explanation on how Balor got his power, but does not elaborate due to lack of space.

Another description of Balor&#x27;s death, dating from at least the 12th century, says he survived the loss of his eye and was chased by Lugh to Mizen Head. Lugh beheads Balor and sets the head on a large rock, which then shatters. This is said to be the origin of the headland&#x27;s Irish name, &quot;Carn Uí Néit&quot; (&quot;cairn of Nét&#x27;s grandson&quot;).

==Folktale==

In folklore collected during the 19th century, Balor is a warrior or tyrant who is generally said to live on Tory Island. Balor hears a prophecy that he would be killed by his grandson. To avoid his fate, he locks his only daughter, Ethnea (Eithne), in a tower to keep her from becoming pregnant. Balor goes to the mainland and steals the magical cow of abundance Glas Gaibhnenn belonging to
MacKineely (Cian mac Cáinte) MacKineely/Cian learns he can only get the cow back when Balor is dead, and with the help of his female familiar spirit (&quot;leanan sídhe&quot;) named Biróg, enters the tower, finds Ethnea and impregnates her. When she gives birth to three sons, Balor orders the three to be drowned, but one survives without Balor&#x27;s knowledge. The grandson is fostered by the smith who is his uncle Balor eventually encounters his grandson by chance and is killed by him.

The unnamed grandson in the tale is recognizable as Lugh. In &quot;Balor on Tory Island&quot; and its variant, the child is called Lughaidh Lámhfhada (Lughaidh Longhand), and is recognized as an equivalent of Lugh. In the very similar Irish text &quot;Balor agus Mac Cionnfhaolaidh&quot;, the child is Lugh Fadlámhach, i.e., &quot;Lugh the long-armed&quot;. In another variant, the child is called Dul Dauna, which has been explained as a corruption of &quot;Ildanach&quot; &quot;master of all knowledge&quot;, Lugh&#x27;s nickname.

The weapon used against Balor by his grandson may be a red-hot heated iron rod, or a special red spear crafted by the smith Gaivnin Gow, the latter being of special interest to A. C. L. Brown who tries to establish connection to Arthurian lore.

===Balor&#x27;s eye===
&quot;Balor himself may have one, two or three eyes, one of which is poisonous, incendiary, or otherwise malignant; he may have two eyes in front, one each in front and back, an extra eye in the middle of his forehead. Lugh always puts the evil eye out&quot;, as summarized by Mark Scowcroft.

In O&#x27;Donovan&#x27;s version of the folktale above, Balor has one eye in the middle of the forehead, and a deadly eye on the back of his head. It is described as both venomous, and issuing some sort of petrifying beam with powers like unto a basilisk. O&#x27;Curry deplored the dissemination of such a &quot;peasantry&quot; version, assisted by O&#x27;Donovan printing it. This second eye in the back does not preclude comparison with the one-eyed Cyclops of Greek myth.

In &quot;Balor on Tory Island&quot;, Balor covers the eye in the middle of his forehead with nine leather shields, but Lugh (Lui Lavada &quot;the Longhand&quot;) sends a red spear crafted by Gavidin Gow through all the layers.

It may be that this forehead eye should be interpreted as an &quot;extra eye in the middle of his forehead&quot; (one of three) as Scowcroft puts it, otherwise Balor would be rendered blind most of the time. But Scowcroft does not specify the work to which he is alluding. Balor is explicitly three-eyed in a version published by William Hamilton Maxwell.

But another version of the folktale (from County Mayo) says that Balor was one-eyed, yet it was usually covered: &quot;He had a single eye in his forehead, a venomous fiery eye. There were always seven coverings over this eye. One by one Balar removed the coverings. With the first covering the bracken began to wither, with the second the grass became copper-coloured, with the third the woods and timber began to heat, with the fourth smoke came from the trees, with the fifth everything grew red, with the sixth it sparked. With the seventh, they were all set on fire, and the whole countryside was ablaze!&quot;

===Severed head and lake origin tales===
According to a lay in &quot;Duanaire Finn&quot;, after he was slain, Balor&#x27;s severed head was set in the fork of an oak, and the tree which absorbed the venom became the timber-wood made into the shield of Fionn mac Cumhaill.

In &quot;Balor on Tory Island&quot; and the Irish text close to it, Lui Lavada (or Lugh) sets Balor&#x27;s head on a rock, and a lake forms from the dripping pool of liquid. The Irish text does not specify location, but Curtin&#x27;s tale in English names Gweedore Loch (in County Donegal, local to the storyteller).

According to folklore from County Sligo, Balor was said to have a glass through which he would look to destroy a person with his eye. He used the glass to burn and wither all of the plants at Moytura, which prompted a hero to ask how he did this. Balor, being duped by the trick, removed the glass from his eye long enough for the hero to put the eye out. The blood running from Balor&#x27;s eye created a lake called &quot;Suil Balra&quot; or &quot;Lochan na Súil&quot; (Lough Nasool, &quot;lake of the eye&quot;), near Ballindoon Abbey.

===Localization of the legend===
The placing of Balor&#x27;s stronghold on Tory Island derives from the medieval literature, which places the Fomorians&#x27; stronghold there. On Tory Island there are geological features called &quot;Dún Bhalair&quot; (&quot;Balor&#x27;s fortress&quot;) and &quot;Túr Bhalair&quot; (&quot;Balor&#x27;s tower&quot;), and a tall rock formation called &quot;Tór Mór&quot; (&quot;great tower&quot;).

Although the Tory Island version of the folktale printed by O&#x27;Donovan was influential, this may have misled the public with the impression that &quot;Tory has almost a monopoly of Balor traditions&quot;, so argues Henry Morris. O&#x27;Donovan said that Balor was remembered &quot;throughout Ireland&quot;. The Balor tales involving the magic cow were also being told plentifully elsewhere, particularly &quot;South of Ulster&quot;. Morris stated he had collected &quot;remnants&quot; in Farney, Monaghan c. 1900, and that these versions connected Balor and the cow Glasgaivlen with places as far afield as &quot;south Monaghan to Rockabill Island off the coast of Dublin&quot;.

==Interpretations==
Some have interpreted Balor as symbolizing a solar deity of the old year, struggling with the solar god of the new year, namely Lugh. Folklorist Alexander Haggerty Krappe subscribed to this notion. He suggests that the myth and others like it could be metaphors for yearly cycles of growth, death, and re-growth. Krappe hypothesized that the myth is of ancient origin, with Balor representing winter and the old year, confining the woman who represents the fertile earth.

Dáithí Ó hÓgáin interprets Balor as personifying the harmful aspects of the sun, such as the scorching sun that would bring crop failure and drought. He speculates that the imagery of Balor is a conflation of a Bronze Age Celtic sun god with the Greek Cyclops. Both Ó hÓgáin and Máire MacNeill believe that Lugh&#x27;s slaying of Balor was originally a harvest myth associated with the festival of Lughnasa and the later tale of Saint Patrick overcoming Crom Dubh. Ó hÓgáin also believes that the hero Fionn&#x27;s conflict with figures named Goll (meaning &quot;one-eyed&quot;), Áed (meaning &quot;fire&quot;) and Aillen (the burner) stems from Lugh&#x27;s conflict with Balor.

===Parallels===
The parallel between Balor and Ysbaddaden from Welsh mythology has been noted by several commentators, but for different reasons. Each is a giant whose eyelid takes several men to lift (using a ring handle vs. lifting with forks); each has a spear cast at him and loses an eye; and each is unwilling to give away his daughter to the bridal-quester.

Since the mid-19th century, Balor has been likened to figures from Greek mythology, especially the Cyclops. James O&#x27;Laverty noted the parallel with Acrisius, the King of Argos who was fated to be killed by his grandson, the hero Perseus. This parallel has been pursued at length by others.

O&#x27;Laverty also ventured that the name &quot;Balor&quot; may be linked to the name of the Greek hero Bellerophon. Arbois de Jubainville argued that the name &quot;Bellerophon&quot; means &quot;slayer of Belleros&quot; and that this is another name for the Chimera. He asserts that both the Chimera and Balor are monsters that spew flame or thunderbolts.

However, de Jubainville (and others) also seized on another comparison: between Balor and Argos the many-eyed watchman of the white cow Io. Since the destroyer of the former is Lugh, and of the latter is Hermes, this neatly fits into the framework of identifying the Celtic Hermes with Lugh.

Krappe lists six elements that are found in other myths: the prophecy of being slain by his own descendant; the precaution of locking the daughter in a tower; the seduction of the daughter by a stranger, who needs to use magic to gain access; the birth of a boy and the attempt to drown him; the fostering of the boy, and the fulfillment of the prophecy by the boy killing his grandparent.

Krappe drew parallel between Balor with the supposed Serbian &quot;vy&quot; mentioned by W. R. S. Ralston, but unfortunately Krappe misreads Ralston and utterly confounds this &quot;vy&quot; with what is actually the &quot;Aged One&quot; character (or &quot;old, old man&quot;, the witch&#x27;s husband) in the Russian &quot;skazka&quot; &quot;Ivan Bykovich&quot; (&quot;Ivan the Bull&#x27;s Son&quot;). In actuality, the heavy eyelid/eyebrow motif occurs in &quot;Ivan Bykovich&quot;, but not specifically ascribed to the &quot;vy&quot; by Ralston.

Parallels have also been noted in the etymologies and mythic structures between Lugh&#x27;s slaying of Balor and Loki&#x27;s slaying of Baldr with additional etymological parallels noted between the theonyms Belenus and Belin (Slovenian deity).

==Cultural references==

&quot;Cyathophycus balori&quot;, a species of sponge, was named after Balor after a 315-million-year-old fossilised remnant of the sponge was discovered by the Cliffs of Moher in Ireland.

<text>Biróg (Biroge of the Mountain, Birog), in Irish folklore is the &quot;leanan sídhe&quot; or the female familiar spirit of Cian who aids him in the folktale about his wooing of Balor&#x27;s daughter Eithne.

She is reinvented as a druidess in Lady Gregory and T. W. Rolleston&#x27;s retellings.

== Attestations ==
A version of the folktale recorded by John O&#x27;Donovan in 1835 relates how the Fomorian warrior Balor, to frustrate a prophecy that he would be killed by his own grandson, imprisons his only daughter Eithne in the tower of Tory Island, away from any contact with men.

But Biroge of the Mountain helps a man called Mac Cinnfhaelaidh (Mac Kineely), whose magical cow (Glas Gaivlen &quot;recté&quot; Glas Gaibhnenn) Balor stole, to gain access to the tower and seduce her. Eithne gives birth to triplets, but Balor gathers them up in a sheet and sends a messenger to drown them in a whirlpool. The messenger drowns two of the babies, but unwittingly drops one in the harbour, where he is rescued by Biróg. She takes the child back to his father, who gives him to his brother, Gavida the smith, in fosterage. The boy (identified in the tale only as the &quot;heir of Mac Kineely&quot;) who grows up to kill Balor, is more explicitly identified as Lugh in Lady Gregory and T. W. Rolleston&#x27; retelling.

Lady Gregory refers to her as Birog the druidess, and T. W. Rolleston gives her orthography as Biróg.

<text>In Irish mythology, Caitlín () was the wife of Balor of the Fomorians and, by him, the mother of Ethniu. She was also a prophetess and warned Balor of his impending defeat by the Tuatha Dé Danann in the second battle of Magh Tuiredh. During that battle she wounded the Dagda with a projectile weapon. She was also known by the nickname Cethlenn of the Crooked Teeth.

== Name ==
Ceithlinn in modern Irish is pronounced like &quot;Kehlen&quot;, and her name is sometimes indicated by that spelling. Kethlenda is the form of the name that appeared in Roderick O&#x27;Flaherty&#x27;s &quot;Ogygia&quot; or &quot;Rerum Hibernicarum Chronologia&quot;, written in Latin, reused as &quot;Kethlenda of the Crooked Teeth&quot; by story-reteller P. W. Joyce.

;Nickname
Ceithlinn is called by the nickname Ceithlion Chaisfhiaclach &quot;the crooked toothed&quot; in the &quot;Oidheadh Chloinne Tuireann&quot;, also translatable as &quot;twisted teeth&quot;, from Irish &quot;cas&quot; &#x27;twisted&#x27;. She is also glossed as being &quot;buck-toothed&quot;.

Ceitleann Chraos-Fhiaclach is the slightly different form of the nickname that occurs in the Fenian cycle story (&quot;The Fairy Palace of the Quicken Trees&quot;, &quot;Rowan Tree Palace&quot;, &quot;The Story of the Rowan Tree Dwelling&quot;). The headword, &quot;craos&quot; () can mean a &#x27;gap, gaping, yawning&#x27;, as well as &#x27;voraciousness&#x27;, but Pearse has accepted the latter sense, and glosses the name as &quot;ravening tooth&quot;. This Ceaithlann also appears in Scottish copies of this tale.

== Attestations ==

=== Battle of Mag Tuired ===
Cethlenn is unmentioned in the narrative &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot;, as she is not listed in the roster of Fomorians compiled by Whitley Stokes .

But in this Battle of Mag Tuired (The Second Battle of Moytura), Cethlenn hurled a javelin (&quot;gae&quot;) at the Dagda giving him a mortal wound, as recorded in the&quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;. It took 120 years before the Dagda died of the wound.

The recounting of Cethlenn injuring the Dagda is repeated in the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;, Keating&#x27;s &quot;History&quot;, and O&#x27;Flaherty&#x27;s &quot;Ogygia&quot;.

Cethlenn presumably fell in battle, or so it has been commented on by John O&#x27;Mahony without clarification of source.

=== Enniskillen ===

Some local historians in the 20th century and after refer to a legend that the Cethlenn was injured and swam to Enniskillen on Loch Erne, Co. Fermanagh, where she died. The suggestion that Enniskillen is eponymous after Cethlenn is made in the early 17th century &quot;Annals of Clonmacnoise&quot;, though nothing about her swimming there is remarked on by 19th century writers. The present-day town is still situated on a river island. The town centre can only be accessed by crossing a bridge from the surrounding mainland. The town was the location of an island fortress on the River Erne once maintained by the Maguire of Fermanagh and the castle river gate entrance still stands.

According to local lore, the town has taken the name of a smaller island, Innis Cethlenn, located just south of today&#x27;s East Bridge. It was long ago foretold that if the island was flooded by Erne waters, it would fall to its enemies. Just before the Flight of the Earls (the old Gaelic rulers) the island did flood and the town of Enniskillen fell to the English. In the nineteenth century the Enniskillen borough took measures to prevent the town ever being taken by an enemy again, by filling in the narrow waterway between the smaller island and the mainland. At the same time, the island&#x27;s elevation was raised to the level of the mainland with earth filling enclosed inside a stone wall. This piece of ground can still be seen, home now to a stand of mature chestnut trees that overhang the river. Innis Cethleen is still enclosed by the stone wall that has prevented it flooding for the past two centuries. 

Énrí Ó Muirgheasa suggested that this area (Breifne) which is the nexus between Ulster and Connacht should be investigated as the genuine location where the Balor legend was localized, rather than Tory Island.

=== Balor&#x27;s wife ===
Cethlenn is not explicitly called Balor&#x27;s wife in the LGE, but it is thus stated in the &quot;Ogygia&quot; (1685).

=== Prognostication ===
In the early modern Romance &quot;Oidheadh Chloinne Tuireann&quot; (OCT), Balor&#x27;s wife (Céithlionn or Ceithlinn) identifies Lug as their grandson, and proclaims that once he comes into Erin, the days that they the Fomorians will remain in power are at an end.

Arthur C. L. Brown remarks on this prediction that comes true in the form of Balor&#x27;s destruction by Lugh, but prefers not to make connection to the ancient version of the &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot; in which Lug uses a sling stone as the lethal weapon, but rather to a folktale version in which Lugh uses a spear crafted by a particular swordsmith named Gavnin Gow.

The town of Enniskillen (Irish &quot;inis Cethlinn&quot;, &quot;Cethlenn&#x27;s island&quot;) in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland is named after her.

It has also been suggested that the name of Cethlenn may have influenced the name &quot;Cathaleen&#x27;s Fall(s)&quot; used for the Assaroe Falls in County Donegal. This name is now used for the hydroelectric dam built at that location.

<text>In Irish mythology, Banba (modern spelling: Banbha ), daughter of Delbáeth and Ernmas of the Tuatha Dé Danann, is a matron goddess of Ireland. She was married to Mac Cuill, a grandson of the Dagda.

She was part of an important triumvirate of matron goddesses, with her sisters, Ériu and Fódla. According to Seathrún Céitinn she worshipped Macha, who is also sometimes named as a daughter of Ernmas. The two goddesses may therefore be seen as equivalent. Céitinn also refers to a tradition that Banbha was the first person to set foot in Ireland before the flood, in a variation of the legend of Cessair.

In the &quot;Tochomlad mac Miledh a hEspain i nErind: no Cath Tailten&quot;, it is related that as the Milesians were journeying through Ireland, &quot;they met victorious Banba among her troop of faery magic hosts&quot; on Senna Mountain, the stony mountain of Mes. A footnote identifies this site as Slieve Mish in Chorca Dhuibne, County Kerry. The soil of this region is a non-leptic podzol . If the character of Banba originated in an earth-goddess, non-leptic podzol may have been the particular earth-type of which she was the deification.

The LÉ Banba (CM11), a ship in the Irish Naval Service, was named after her.

Initially, she could have been a goddess of war as well as a fertility goddess.

<text>In Irish mythology, Ériu (; ), daughter of Delbáeth and Ernmas of the Tuatha Dé Danann, was the eponymous matron goddess of Ireland.

The English name for Ireland comes from the name Ériu and the Germanic (Old Norse or Old English) word &quot;land&quot;.

Since Ériu is represented as goddess of Ireland, she is often interpreted as a modern-day personification of Ireland, although since the name &quot;Ériu&quot; is the Old Irish form of the word Ireland, her modern name is often modified to &quot;Éire&quot; or &quot;Erin&quot; to suit a modern form.

==Name and etymology==
The name &quot;Ériu&quot; has been derived from reconstructed Archaic Irish &quot;*Īweriū&quot;, which is related to the ethnic name Iverni. The University of Wales derives this from Proto-Celtic *&quot;Φīwerjon-&quot; (nominative singular &quot;Φīwerjō&quot;). This is further derived from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*piHwerjon-&quot; (&quot;fertile land&quot; or &quot;land of abundance&quot;), from the adjective &quot;*piHwer-&quot; &quot;fat&quot; (cognate with Ancient Greek &quot;píeira&quot; and Sanskrit &quot;pīvara&quot;, &quot;fat, full, abounding&quot;). The Archaic Irish form was borrowed into Ancient Greek as &quot;Iernē&quot; and &quot;Iouernia&quot;, and into Latin &quot;Hibernia&quot;.

== Epithets ==
In the &quot;Banshenchas&quot; (a mediaeval text describing legendary and historical Irish women), Ériu and her sisters are called:

* &quot;fair women of the Tuatha Dé Danand&quot;
* &quot;a famous throng&quot;
* &quot;clear voice of achievement&quot;
* &quot;three fair daughters of Fiachra&quot;
* &quot;bright women of spirited speech&quot;

== Family ==
Different texts attribute differing personal relationships to Ériu. Ériu&#x27;s sisters are consistently named as Banba and Fódla, who are members of the Tuatha Dé Danann, and the three sisters share a trio of brothers as husbands. In the &quot;Banshenchas&quot;, Ériu is described as the wife of Cetar, while Banba and Fódla are named as the wives of Etar and Detar, respectively. More commonly, she is named as the wife or lover of Mac Gréine (&quot;Son of the Sun&quot;), a grandson of the Dagda, although in the &quot;Banshenchas&quot;, her husband is simply named &quot;Grian&quot; (&quot;Sun&quot;). Ériu is also portrayed as the lover of Elatha, a prince of the Fomorians, with whom she produces a son named Bres, and as the mistress of Bres&#x27;s enemy - the hero Lugh. Both Elatha and Ériu are described in some sources as the children of Delbaeth, indicating they may be half-siblings. Elsewhere Ériu is named as the daughter of Fiachra, and her mother is named as Ernmas. Her foster-father in the Rennes &quot;Dindsenchas&quot; is named as Codal the Roundbreasted, and it is said that when he fed Ériu on a peak called &quot;Benn Codail&quot;, it caused the land in Ireland to heave toward the sky, and it would have kept rising until the entire land would have been the peak or otherwise until the sun would have scorched Ériu and the wind pierced her ears.

==Role and mythical portrayal==
With her sisters, Banba and Fódla, Ériu forms a triumvirate of goddesses. When the Milesians arrived from Galicia, each of the three sisters asked that her name be given to the country. This was granted to them, although Ériu (Éire) became the chief name in use. (Banba and Fódla are still sometimes used as poetic names for Ireland, much as &quot;Albion&quot; is used as a poetic name for Great Britain.)

According to the 17th-century Irish historian Geoffrey Keating (&quot;&quot;), the three sovereignty goddesses associated with Éire, Banbha and Fódla were Badb, Macha and The Morrígan. Ériu, Banba and Fódla are also interpreted as goddesses of sovereignty.

<text>In Irish mythology, Fódla or Fótla (modern spelling: Fódhla, Fodhla or Fóla), daughter of Delbáeth and Ernmas of the Tuatha Dé Danann, was one of the tutelary goddesses of Ireland. Her husband was Mac Cecht.

With her sisters, Banba and Ériu, she was part of an important triumvirate of goddesses. When the Milesians arrived from Spain, each of the three sisters asked the bard Amergin that her name be given to the country. Ériu (Éire, and in the dative &#x27;Éirinn&#x27;, giving English &#x27;Erin&#x27;) seems to have won the argument, but the poets hold that all three were granted their wish, and thus &#x27;Fódhla&#x27; is sometimes used as a literary name for Ireland, as is &#x27;Banba&#x27;. This is similar in some ways to the use of the poetic name &#x27;Albion&#x27; for Great Britain.

In the &quot;Tochomlad mac Miledh a hEspain i nErind&quot;, Fótla is described as the wife of Mac Cecht, reigning as Queen of Ireland in any year in which Mac Cecht ruled as king. The text goes on to relate that as the Milesians were journeying through Ireland, Fótla met them ‘with her swift fairy hosts around her’ on Naini Mountain, also called the mountain of Ebliu. A footnote identifies the Naini Mountain of Ebliu as the Slieve Felim Mountains in County Limerick. The soil of this region is peaty luvisol.

According to Seathrún Céitinn she worshipped the Mórrígan, who is also named as a daughter of Ernmas.

In &quot;De Situ Albanie&quot; (a late document), the Pictish Chronicle, and the &quot;Duan Albanach&quot;, &quot;Fotla&quot; (modern Atholl, &quot;Ath-Fotla&quot;) was the name of one of the first Pictish kingdoms.

<text>In Irish mythology, Fiacha (, sometimes Fiachu, Fiachra or Fiachna), son of Delbáeth, of the Tuatha Dé Danann, was a legendary High King of Ireland. According to the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, he took the throne after his father was overthrown by Caicher son of Nama, brother of Nechtan. The &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; and Geoffrey Keating say he overthrew his father himself. His mother was Ernmas. He had three daughters, Banba, Fódla, and Ériu, by his own mother. He reigned for ten years, before he and his nephew Aoi Mac Ollamain were killed in battle against Éogan of Imber.

<text>In Irish mythology, Mac Cuill of the Tuatha Dé Danann, was a son of Cermait, son of the Dagda. Mac Cuill&#x27;s given name was Éthur and he was named Mac Cuill after his god, Coll, the hazel. His wife was Banba.

==Description==
He and his brothers Mac Cecht and Mac Gréine killed Lug in revenge for their father. The three brothers became joint High Kings of Ireland, rotating the sovereignty between them a year at a time, covering twenty-nine or thirty years depending on the source consulted. They were the last kings of the Tuatha Dé Danann before the coming of the Milesians. Mac Cuill and his brothers treacherously slew Íth, prompting his nephew Míl Espáine and his sons to invade Ireland for revenge. During the battle against the Milesians, Mac Cuill was slain by Eber Finn.

<text>Belatucadros or Belatucadrus, was a deity worshipped in Celtic northern Britain, particularly in Cumberland and Westmorland. In the Roman period he was identified with Mars and appears to have been worshipped by lower-ranked Roman soldiers as well as by Britons. In five inscriptions he is called Mars Belatucadrus and the name is frequently translated as &quot;fair shining one&quot; or &quot;fair slayer.&quot;

Belatucadros is known from approximately 28 inscriptions in the vicinity of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. Dedications to Balatocadrus, Balatucadrus, Balaticaurus, Balatucairus, Baliticaurus, Belatucairus, Belatugagus, Belleticaurus, Blatucadrus and Blatucairus are generally accepted as variants of the most common of these forms: Belatucadrus. Altars dedicated to him were usually small, simple and plain, leading to the suggestion that this god was mainly worshipped by people of low social status. His name never appears with a female consort and there is no certain extant representation of him.

Celtic scholar Anne Ross suggests that his name, and that of a similar local god, Cocidius, may be epithets for a common general type of Celtic horned god. A horned head was found near the shrine of Belatucadros at Netherby, Cumbria but cannot be securely identified with the god.

<text>Belenus (Gaulish: &quot;Belenos&quot;, &quot;Belinos&quot;) is an ancient Celtic healing god. The cult of Belenus stretched from the Italian Peninsula to the British Isles, with a main sanctuary located at Aquileia, on the Adriatic coast. Through &quot;interpretatio romana&quot;, Belenus was often identified with Apollo, although his cult seems to have preserved a certain degree of autonomy during the Roman period.

==Name==
=== Attestations ===
The theonym &quot;Belenus&quot; (or &quot;Belinus&quot;), which is a latinized form of the Gaulish &quot;Belenos&quot; (or &quot;Belinos&quot;), appears in some 51 inscriptions. Although most of them are located in Aquileia (Friuli, Italy), the main centre of his cult, the name has also been found in places where Celtic speakers lived in ancient times, including in Gaul, Noricum, Illyria, Britain and Ireland. 

Linguist Blanca María Prósper argues that &quot;Belinos&quot; was probably the original form, which also appears in the name &quot;&quot; (from an earlier &quot;Belinos&quot;), a Welsh leader who died in 627 AD. Known variants include &quot;Bellinus&quot; and perhaps &quot;Belus&quot;. The deity may also have been known in Ireland and Britain by the variants &quot;Bel&quot;, &quot;Beli&quot;, and &quot;Bile.&quot;

===Etymology===

The etymology of &quot;Belenos&quot; remains unclear. It has been traditionally translated as the &#x27;bright one&#x27; or the &#x27;shining one&#x27;, by deriving the name from a Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*bʰelH-&quot;, interpreted as &#x27;white, shining&#x27; (cf. &quot;báltas&quot; &#x27;white&#x27;, φαλός &quot;phalós&quot; &#x27;white&#x27;, &quot;bal&quot; &#x27;pallor&#x27;, &quot;bala&quot; &#x27;grey&#x27;). This theory was encouraged by the &quot;interpretatio romana&quot; of &quot;Belenos&quot; as the &#x27;Gaulish Apollo&#x27;, a divinity with sun attributes.

However, this etymology has come under increasing criticism in recent scholarship. Xavier Delamarre notes that the proposed cognates stemming from &quot;*bʰelH-&quot; do not seem to connote &#x27;shining&#x27;, but rather &#x27;[pale] white&#x27; or &#x27;grey&#x27;, and suggests that &quot;Belenos&quot; may rather derive from the Gaulish stem &quot;belo&quot;- (&#x27;strong, powerful&#x27;) attached to the suffix -&quot;nos&quot; (&#x27;lord, master&#x27;), which would lead to &quot;Belenos&quot; as the &#x27;Master of Power&#x27;. Alternatively, Peter Schrijver has proposed that &quot;Belenos&quot; might be an &quot;o&quot;-stem of the Indo-European root *&quot;bʰel-&quot;, designating the henbane (cf. Welsh &quot;bela&quot;, Germanic *&quot;bel(u)nōn&quot;, Slavic &quot;*bъlnъ&quot;), a psychoactive plant which was known as &quot;belenuntia&quot; in Gaulish and as &quot;apollinaris&quot; in Latin. Bernhard Maier and Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel have also argued that the name may derive from a root &quot;*gwelH-&quot;, meaning &#x27;source, spring&#x27;. According to Šašel Kos, Belenus&#x27; &quot;close association with water is confirmed by two dedications to &quot;Fons B(eleni)&quot; and by an altar in which Belenus is worshipped together with the Nymphs. Thermal springs are also attested to at Iulium Carnicum.&quot; The 19th-century attempt to link the root &quot;bel&quot;- with the Phoenician deity &quot;Baal&quot; is now widely rejected by modern scholars.

=== Related terms ===
A village that is now part of the municipality of Aquileia is still named &quot;Beligna&quot;. A tribal leader of pre-Roman Britain was named &quot;Cunobelinos&quot; (Old Welsh &quot;Conbelin&quot;), which possibly means &#x27;hound of Belenos&#x27;, or else &#x27;strong as a dog&#x27; if the name is not theophoric. The Old Welsh personal name &quot;Liuelin&quot; (modern &quot;Llywelyn&quot;) goes back to a similar compound *&quot;lugu-belinos&quot; (either a dvandva with the names of two deities, or else &#x27;strong as Lugus&#x27;). The Brittonic variant of the name could be the source of the &quot;Billingsgate&quot; ward in London, although this may be a folk etymology, and possibly of the fountain of &quot;Belenton&quot; (now Bérenton) in the Brocéliande forest in Brittany. The names of the Welsh and Irish ancestor-figures &quot;Beli Mawr&quot; and &quot;Bile&quot; may also be related.

The Gaulish term &quot;belenuntia&quot; (Βελενούντιαν), designating the henbane, a hallucinogenic plant also known in Latin as &quot;apollinaris&quot;, may be a derivative form of &quot;Belenos&quot;. The variant &quot;belenion&quot;, cited as a poisonous plant by Pseudo-Aristotle, appears to be the source of the Spanish &quot;beleño&quot; (&#x27;henbane&#x27;). The Gallo-Roman term &quot;belisa&quot; could also have been borrowed into Old High German as &quot;bilisa&quot; (cf. modern German &quot;Bilsenkraut&quot; &#x27;henbane&#x27;). Henbane was commonly used in antiquity for medicinal purposes, providing further evidence of Belanos&#x27; healing attributes. A shallow stone dish found in Saint-Chamas (south of France) and dedicated to &quot;Beleino&quot; could thus have been used to hold hallucinogenic substances.

According to Delamarre, the name of the goddess &quot;Belisama&quot; appears to be built on a same stem &quot;bel(o)&quot;- (&#x27;strong, powerful&#x27;) attached to the intensifying suffix -&quot;isama&quot;, and could thus been translated as &#x27;Very Powerful&#x27;. Schrijver rather links it to a stem for &#x27;henbane&#x27;, *&quot;beles&quot;-, attached to an unknown suffix -&quot;ma&quot;, and compares the name with the Gaulish theonym &quot;Belisa-maros&quot;. The personal name &quot;Bellovesus&quot; can probably be translated as &#x27;Worthy of Power&#x27;, from &quot;bello&quot;- (&#x27;power&#x27;) attached to &quot;uesus&quot; (&#x27;worthy, good, deserving&#x27;).

Spanish scholarship also relates the deity&#x27;s name to Aquitanian anthroponym &quot;Belinatepos&quot; or &quot;Belanetepos&quot; (taken to have an equine association), as well as the toponyms Beleño and Beloño.

===Epithets===
In ancient Gaul and Britain, Apollo was commonly associated with the sun and healing attributes. He may have been equated with fifteen or more different names and epithets (including &quot;Belenus&quot;, &quot;Vindonnus&quot;, &quot;Grannos&quot;, &quot;Borvo&quot;, &quot;Maponus&quot;, &quot;Moritasgus&quot;, among others).

The god was venerated as Apollo Belenus at the curative shrine of Sainte-Sabine (Burgundy), where he was invoked by pilgrims seeking cures for their sickness. If Belenus is interpreted as meaning &#x27;shining, brilliant&#x27;, it can be compared to the Celtic epithet &quot;Vindonnus&quot; (from *&quot;windo&quot;- &#x27;white&#x27;), attached to Apollo as a deity who restored light and vision to people with eye disease at Essarois (Burgundy).

==Historical cult==

=== Origin ===
According to philologist Helmut Birkhan, Belenus was seen as a &quot;typical Karnian oracle- and health-giving deity&quot;, although its widespread attestation among ancient Celtic peoples may point to a Common Celtic origin of the cult. Scholar Miranda Aldhouse-Green writes that the deity probably pre-existed the Roman period. Philologist Marjeta Šašel Kos thinks that the worship of Belenus spread from Noricum towards the nearby towns of Aquileia and Iulium Carnicum (modern Zuglio).

=== Locations ===
Tertullian, writing in c. 200 AD, identifies Belenus as the national god of Noricum. Inscriptions dedicated to Belenus are concentrated in the Eastern Alps and Gallia Cisalpina, but there is evidence that the popularity of the god became more widespread in the Roman period. 

Around 240, Herodian mentions Belenus&#x27; worship in Aquileia, where he was regarded as its patron god. During the siege of the city in 238 AD by emperor Maximinus Thrax, who died during the event while his army was defeated soon afterwards, Belenus was invoked as the divine protector of Aquileia. The soldiers reported seeing an appearance of the god floating in the air, battling and defending his town, in an evocation of Apollo&#x27;s defence of Delphi against the troops of Brennos. Dedications to a &quot;Fons Beleni&quot; (&#x27;Fountain of Belenos&#x27;) show connection with medicinal springs. The third-century emperors Diocletian and Maximian each dedicated an inscription to Belenus in the region of Aquileia. A further 6 votive inscriptions of Belenus were discovered at Altinum, Concordia and Iulium Carnicum.Belenus was an important god of Iulium Carnicum (modern Zuglio), a town close to the border with Noricum inhabited by the Carni. A sanctuary dedicated to the deity is attested by the second half of the 1st century BC, when its renovation was commemorated by two chiefs of the village. Epigraphic dedications to the god are also known in Venice and at Rimini. An altar was also found in Celeia (modern Celje), one of the most important Norican towns. The cult may have been introduced here from Aquileia, as suggested by the name of its dedicator, Lucius Sentius Forensis, the Sentii being well attested to at Aquileia, but not in Noricum.
Ausonius (later 4th century AD) alludes to sanctuaries dedicated to Belenus in Aquitania, and mentions a temple priest of the cult named Phoebicius. The deity was also popular in Provence, as attested by inscriptions from the Marseille and Nîmes areas. A votive inscription from Caesarean times by the poet Lucius Erax Bardus was found at Rochemolles, near Bardonecchia (Bardonnèche), in Italy (Alpi Graie). At Aquae Borvonis (Bourbon-Lancy), the Aedui worshipped Belenus in association with health giving waters.

=== Consort ===
Images of Belenus sometimes show him to be accompanied by a female, perhaps the Gaulish deity Belisama. The river name &quot;Bienne&quot; (&quot;Biena&quot; in 1337 AD), present-day eastern France, and the place name &quot;Bienne&quot; (&quot;apud Belnam&quot; in 1142 AD), modern Switzerland, also attest to the existence of a feminine form *&quot;Belenā&quot;.

In Noricum, Belenus may also have been accompanied by an otherwise unknown female deity named &quot;Belestis&quot; (or &quot;Beléna, Beléstis Augústa, Beléstris, Belínca&quot;), possibly worshipped as a goddess of nature and fertility. Two shrines dedicated to the goddess were found in Podljubelj in the Karawanks.

== Related beliefs ==

=== Medieval Ireland ===
The Irish Bel has been speculated by some scholars to be linked to the god Belenus. Fires in honor of the deity were lit for Celtic festivals of Beltaine (&#x27;Bel&#x27;s Fires&#x27;) on May 1. On occasion, cattle was driven between two fires in order to repeal diseases, which Schrijver has compared to the traditional German custom of burning henbane collected on Midsummer to protect the cattle against diseases and witchcraft.

=== Modern Slovenia ===
The Slovenian divinity &quot;Belin&quot;, attested in the 19th century by historian Simon Rutar, may provide evidence of the survival of Belenus&#x27; cult in the region and of its later integration into Slovenian beliefs, possibly blended with attributes of the Slavic god Belibog. The local population regarded him as a great healer who could cure blindness with his &#x27;key&#x27;. Professor Monika Kropej also states that Belenus was possibly incorporated into the Slovenian lore as the &quot;beliči&quot;, a type of fairy-like beings. An incised stone in southwestern Slovenia, called &quot;berlina&quot; by the local population, among other names, may also be related. It is connected to ancient rituals and features two primitively carved figures with heads ornamented with rays.

== Legacy ==

=== Science ===
The minor planet 11284 Belenus is named after him.

=== Popular culture ===
The Gauls of the Asterix franchise often swear by Belenos and Toutatis.

<text>Los Chicos (also known as Los Chicos de Puerto Rico) were a Puerto Rican boy band that was popular in Puerto Rico, South America and in Central America during the early to mid 1980s, which was created to rival Menudo&#x27;s success.

The band was created by Eric Laboy in 1978, with the name Encuentro. Due to a political campaign slogan, the name was changed to Los Chicos, which translates to &quot;The Kids&quot; by Mr. Carlos Alfonso Ramirez, who took ownership and managed the boy band. They enjoyed huge success during the early 1980s, under the new management particularly in Puerto Rico South America and Central America. Mr. Alfonso added the following individuals to his management team: Mr. Angelo Medina (Road Manager), Leonor Constanzo (Choreographer), Grace Fontecha (Personal Image Enhancement), Julio Farinacci-Fontecha &quot;Master-Jay&quot; (Audio-Visuals &amp; Computer Technologies) and &quot;Jacquene&quot; (Security/Driver). A movie (Conexión Caribe) was filmed and a TV show hosted weekly on Puerto Rico&#x27;s WAPA-TV. Many songs, including &quot;Puerto Rico son Los Chicos&quot;, &quot;Vuelve&quot;, &quot;Ave María&quot;, &quot;Para Amar&quot; and &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; sung by Jorge Lopez a.k.a. Giro Lopez or Giro became radio favorites, and memorabilia items like posters were mass-produced. Los Chicos became national sponsors for Malta Corona and Mahones Savage (Savage Jeans).

In October 1983, three of the original members, Rey, Migue and Chayanne, quit the group, alleging poor working conditions.
Chayanne became a solo artist and released his first album in 1984. Carlos Alfonso took over the new group with original member Hector Antonio &quot;Tony&quot; Ocasio and three new group members (Tico Santana, Alejandro &quot;Casito&quot; Farinacci Fontecha, and Alejandro Rodriguez). However, this version did not have as much of the acceptance from the public as the first group of boys, and finally the band was dissolved. While it never achieved Menudo&#x27;s level of popularity, it gave them a run for their money in Puerto Rico and Latin American countries, especially Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Panamá. During a televised concert in the Dominican Republic, Los Chicos had to abandon the stage because of fans reaching it. In 1990 Tony Ocasio joined the United States Army and was sent to Iraq where he fought at in Operation Desert Storm. 

==After break-up==
Los Chicos&#x27; most popular members were Chayanne (now an international super-star), Jorge Lopez a.k.a. Giro or Giro Lopez, who was signed to Sony Music and has had a long-term relationship with the label as a Salsa artist with over 10 albums, many gold records and a Grammy Nomination. Giro is still performing and is still well known as a Salsa artist and has released new albums with other labels; in 2010 he created Giro Productions and with the help of Chino Rodriguez now his manager and record label, has released the latest Album &quot;Todavia Hay Amor&quot; on OMG records and Giro Productions, Migue Santa (who became a helicopter pilot), Tony Ocasio and Rey Díaz. Currently Rey is working as a Sales Executive in a prominent firm at Puerto Rico. Future Menudo member Sergio Blass was a member of Los Chicos for a short period of time, he was the only singer to be a member of both Los Chicos and Menudo. Sergio Blass was also a member of arguably the third most popular boy band in Puerto Rico during the early eighties, Concepto Juvenil, making him the only person to be in all three bands.

In the aftermath of the success achieved by six former Menudos in a comeback nicknamed &quot;El Reencuentro&quot;, some former members of Los Chicos spoke about making a comeback too. They had one concert, as &#x27;Los Chicos-El Retorno&quot;. Chayanne did not participate in it.

In August 2012, three former members of Los Chicos released a tell all book named &quot;Los Chicos ~ Mil Recuerdos Sus Historias&quot; written by Joana Acevedo Ocasio with the help of Tony Ocasio (Original lead singer of Los Chicos) and original group members Rey Diaz and Migue Santa. The book recounts their experiences as members of the famous boy band, how they reached stardom and lost it all to mismanagement.

Former member Jose Miguel &quot;Migue&quot; Santa died on March 19, 2019, of respiratory failure.

<doc id="86092" wikidata="Q65979" url="?curid=86092" title="Bile">
<text>Bile (from Latin &quot;bilis&quot;), or gall, is a yellow-green/misty green fluid produced by the liver of most vertebrates that aids the digestion of lipids in the small intestine. In humans, bile is primarily composed of water, is produced continuously by the liver, and is stored and concentrated in the gallbladder. After a human eats, this stored bile is discharged into the first section of the small intestine.

==Composition==
In the human liver, bile is composed of 97–98% water, 0.7% bile salts, 0.2% bilirubin, 0.51% fats (cholesterol, fatty acids, and lecithin), and 200 meq/L inorganic salts. The two main pigments of bile are bilirubin, which is orange-yellow, and its oxidised form biliverdin, which is green. When mixed, they are responsible for the brown color of feces. About of bile is produced per day in adult human beings.

==Function==

Bile or gall acts to some extent as a surfactant, helping to emulsify the lipids in food. Bile salt anions are hydrophilic on one side and hydrophobic on the other side; consequently, they tend to aggregate around droplets of lipids (triglycerides and phospholipids) to form micelles, with the hydrophobic sides towards the fat and hydrophilic sides facing outwards. The hydrophilic sides are negatively charged, and this charge prevents fat droplets coated with bile from re-aggregating into larger fat particles. Ordinarily, the micelles in the duodenum have a diameter around 1–50 μm in humans.

The dispersion of food fat into micelles provides a greatly increased surface area for the action of the enzyme pancreatic lipase, which digests the triglycerides, and is able to reach the fatty core through gaps between the bile salts. A triglyceride is broken down into two fatty acids and a monoglyceride, which are absorbed by the villi on the intestine walls. After being transferred across the intestinal membrane, the fatty acids reform into triglycerides (), before being absorbed into the lymphatic system through lacteals. Without bile salts, most of the lipids in food would be excreted in feces, undigested.

Since bile increases the absorption of fats, it is an important part of the absorption of the fat-soluble substances, such as the vitamins A, D, E, and K.

Besides its digestive function, bile serves also as the route of excretion for bilirubin, a byproduct of red blood cells recycled by the liver. Bilirubin derives from hemoglobin by glucuronidation.

Bile tends to be alkaline on average. The pH of common duct bile (7.50 to 8.05) is higher than that of the corresponding gallbladder bile (6.80 to 7.65). Bile in the gallbladder becomes more acidic the longer a person goes without eating, though resting slows this fall in pH. As an alkali, it also has the function of neutralizing excess stomach acid before it enters the duodenum, the first section of the small intestine. Bile salts also act as bactericides, destroying many of the microbes that may be present in the food.

==Clinical significance==

In the absence of bile, fats become indigestible and are instead excreted in feces, a condition called steatorrhea. Feces lack their characteristic brown color and instead are white or gray, and greasy. Steatorrhea can lead to deficiencies in essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins. In addition, past the small intestine (which is normally responsible for absorbing fat from food) the gastrointestinal tract and gut flora are not adapted to processing fats, leading to problems in the large intestine.

The cholesterol contained in bile will occasionally accrete into lumps in the gallbladder, forming gallstones. Cholesterol gallstones are generally treated through surgical removal of the gallbladder. However, they can sometimes be dissolved by increasing the concentration of certain naturally occurring bile acids, such as chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid.

On an empty stomach – after repeated vomiting, for example – a person&#x27;s vomit may be green or dark yellow, and very bitter. The bitter and greenish component may be bile or normal digestive juices originating in the stomach. Bile may be forced into the stomach secondary due to a weakened valve (pylorus), the presence of certain drugs including alcohol, or powerful muscular contractions and duodenal spasms. This is known as biliary reflux.

===Obstruction===
Biliary obstruction refers to a condition when bile ducts which deliver bile from the gallbladder or liver to the duodenum become obstructed. The blockage of bile might cause a buildup of bilirubin in the bloodstream which can result in jaundice. There are several potential causes for biliary obstruction including gallstones, cancer, trauma, choledochal cysts, or other benign causes of bile duct narrowing. The most common cause of bile duct obstruction is when gallstone(s) are dislodged from the gallbladder into the cystic duct or common bile duct resulting in a blockage. A blockage of the gallbladder or cystic duct may cause cholecystitis. If the blockage is beyond the confluence of the pancreatic duct, this may cause gallstone pancreatitis. In some instances of biliary obstruction, the bile may become infected by bacteria resulting in ascending cholangitis.

==Society and culture==
In medical theories prevalent in the West from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages, the body&#x27;s health depended on the equilibrium of four &quot;humors&quot;, or vital fluids, two of which related to bile: blood, phlegm, &quot;yellow bile&quot; (choler), and &quot;black bile&quot;. These &quot;humors&quot; are believed to have their roots in the appearance of a blood sedimentation test made in open air, which exhibits a dark clot at the bottom (&quot;black bile&quot;), a layer of unclotted erythrocytes (&quot;blood&quot;), a layer of white blood cells (&quot;phlegm&quot;) and a layer of clear yellow serum (&quot;yellow bile&quot;).

Excesses of black bile and yellow bile were thought to produce depression and aggression, respectively, and the Greek names for them gave rise to the English words cholera (from Greek χολή &quot;kholē&quot;, &quot;bile&quot;) and melancholia. In the former of those senses, the same theories explain the derivation of the English word bilious from &quot;bile&quot;, the meaning of gall in English as &quot;exasperation&quot; or &quot;impudence&quot;, and the Latin word &quot;cholera&quot;, derived from the Greek &quot;kholé&quot;, which was passed along into some Romance languages as words connoting anger, such as &quot;&quot; (French) and &quot;cólera&quot; (Spanish).

===Soap===
Soap can be mixed with bile from mammals, such as ox gall. This mixture, called bile soap or gall soap, can be applied to textiles a few hours before washing as a traditional and effective method for removing various kinds of tough stains.

===Food===
Pinapaitan is a dish in Philippine cuisine that uses bile as flavoring. Other areas where bile is commonly used as a cooking ingredient include Laos and northern parts of Thailand.

During the Boshin War, Satsuma soldiers of the early Imperial Japanese Army reportedly ate human livers boiled in bile. The practice of eating a slain enemy&#x27;s liver, known as , was a tradition of the Satsuma people.

=== Bears ===
In regions where bile products are a popular ingredient in traditional medicine, the use of bears in bile-farming has been widespread. This practice has been condemned by activists, and some pharmaceutical companies have developed synthetic (non-ursine) alternatives.

<text>Belisama (Gaulish &quot;Belesama&quot;; epigraphically ) is a Celtic goddess. She was identified by Roman commentators with Minerva by &quot;interpretatio romana&quot;.

== Name ==
The Gaulish theonym &quot;Belesama&quot; has been traditionally interpreted as meaning &#x27;the very bright&#x27;, stemming from the Indo-European root &quot;*bʰelH-&quot; (&#x27;white, shining&#x27;; cf. Lith. &quot;báltas&quot; &#x27;white&#x27;, Greek φαλόσ &quot;phalós&quot; &#x27;white&#x27;, Arm. &quot;bal&quot; &#x27;pallor&#x27;, goth. &quot;bala&quot; &#x27;grey&#x27;) attached to the superlative suffix *-&quot;isamā&quot;. As for &quot;Belenos&quot;, however, this theory has come under increasing criticism in contemporary scholarship.

Xavier Delamarre notes that the proposed cognates stemming from &quot;*bʰelH-&quot; do not seem to connote &#x27;shining&#x27;, but rather &#x27;white, grey, pale&#x27;, and proposes to derive the name from the Gaulish root &quot;belo&quot;- (&#x27;strong, powerful&#x27;), rendering &quot;Belesama&quot; as &#x27;the very strong&#x27; (cf. Sanskrit &quot;baliṣṭhaḥ&quot; &#x27;the strongest&#x27;). Alternatively, Peter Schrijver has conjectured a connection with the stem for &#x27;henbane&#x27;, *&quot;beles&quot;-, attached to an unknown suffix -&quot;ma&quot;, by comparing the name with the Gaulish theonym &quot;Belisa-maros&quot;. According to him, this is &quot;formally attractive and semantically possible (if *&quot;Belesama&quot; = Lat. &quot;Minerva medica&quot;) but not supported by direct evidence&quot;.

The toponyms Beleymas, Bellême, Balesmes, Blesmes, Blismes, and Velesmes are based on the theonym. The name also appears in various river names of Gauls and Britain, including &quot;Belisama&quot; (River Ribble) and &quot;Le Blima&quot; (Tarn). The Galatian personal name &quot;Blesamius&quot;, from an earlier *&quot;Belesamios&quot;, may also be added to the comparison.

==Attestations==

A Gaulish inscription found at Vaison-la-Romaine in Provence (RIG G-172) shows that a &quot;nemeton&quot; was dedicated to her:
: &quot;СΕΓΟΜΑΡΟС/ ΟΥΙΛΛΟΝΕΟС/ ΤΟΟΥΤΙΟΥС/ ΝΑΜΑΥСΑΤΙС/ ΕΙѠΡΟΥ ΒΗΛΗ/СΑΜΙ СΟСΙΝ/ ΝΕΜΗΤΟΝ&quot;
: &quot;Segomaros Ouilloneos tooutious Namausatis eiōrou Bēlēsami sosin nemēton&quot;
: &quot;Segomarus Uilloneos, citizen [&quot;toutius&quot;] of Namausus, dedicated this sanctuary to Belesama&quot;
The identification with Minerva in Gallo-Roman religion is established in a Latin inscription from Saint-Lizier (anciently &quot;Consoranni&quot;), Ariège department (CIL XIII, 8):
:&quot;Minervae / Belisamae / sacrum / Q(uintus) Valerius / Montan[us] / [e]x v[oto?]&quot;

The presence of the goddess in Ancient Britain is more difficult to establish. Based on Ptolemy&#x27;s reference to a &quot;Belisama estuary&quot; (Βελισαμα), River Ribble in England seems to have been known by the name &quot;Belisama&quot; in Roman times.

== Theories ==
The attestation of the theonym as a river name may indicate that she was a lake- and river-goddess. Belisama has also been speculatively claimed as companion of Belenos, whose name seems to contain the same root.

<text>Brigid or Brigit ( , ; meaning &#x27;exalted one&#x27;), also Bríd, is a goddess of pre-Christian Ireland. She appears in Irish mythology as a member of the Tuatha Dé Danann, the daughter of the Dagda and wife of Bres, with whom she had a son named Ruadán. Her sacred tree appears to have been the birch, given some older Imbolc-related traditions.

She is associated with wisdom, poetry, healing, protection, smithing and domesticated animals. &quot;Cormac&#x27;s Glossary&quot;, written in the 9th century by Christian monks, says that Brigid was &quot;the goddess whom poets adored&quot; and that she had two sisters: Brigid the healer and Brigid the smith. This suggests she may have been a triple deity. She is also thought to have some relation to the British Celtic goddess Brigantia.

Saint Brigid shares many of the goddess&#x27;s attributes and her feast day, 1 February, was originally a pagan festival called Imbolc. It has thus been argued that the saint is a Christianization of the goddess, or that the lore of the goddess was transferred to her.

==In early Irish literature==
&quot;Cormac&#x27;s Glossary&quot;, written by Christian scribes in the 9th century and based on earlier sources, says that Brigit was a goddess and daughter of the Dagda. It describes her as a &quot;goddess of poets&quot; and &quot;woman of wisdom&quot; or sage, who is also famous for her &quot;protecting care&quot;. It says that Brigit has two sisters: Brigit the physician or &quot;woman of healing&quot;, and Brigit the smith. It explains that from these, all goddesses in Ireland are called &quot;Brigit&quot;; suggesting that it &quot;may have been more of a title than a personal name&quot;.

The &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; also calls Brigit a poetess and daughter of the Dagda. It says she has two oxen, Fea and Femen, from whom are named Mag Fea (the plain of the River Barrow) and Mag Femin (the plain of the River Suir). Elsewhere, these are named as the two oxen of Dil, &quot;radiant of beauty,&quot; which may have been a byname for Brigid. It also says she possesses the &quot;king of boars&quot;, Torc Triath (from whom the plain of Treithirne is named), and the &quot;king of wethers&quot;, Cirb (from whom the plain of Cirb is named). The animals were said to cry out whenever plundering was committed in Ireland. This suggests Brigid was a guardian goddess of domesticated animals. 

In &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot;, Bríd is the wife of Bres and bears him a son, Ruadán. His name is cognate to several words in Indo-European languages that mean &quot;red, rust&quot;, etc. The story says she began the custom of keening, a combination of wailing and singing, while mourning the death of Ruadán. She is credited in the same passage with inventing a whistle used for night travel.

In her English retellings of Irish myth, Lady Augusta Gregory describes Brigit as &quot;a woman of poetry, and poets worshipped her, for her sway was very great and very noble. And she was a woman of healing along with that, and a woman of smith&#x27;s work, and it was she first made the whistle for calling one to another through the night.&quot;

==Brigid and Saint Brigid==
Historians suggest that the goddess Brigid was syncretized with the Christian saint of the same name. According to medievalist Pamela Berger, Christian monks &quot;took the ancient figure of the mother goddess and grafted her name and functions onto her Christian counterpart,&quot; Brigid of Kildare. 

The goddess and saint have many of the same associations. Saint Brigid is considered a patroness of healers, poets, blacksmiths, livestock and dairy workers, as well as serpents (in Scotland) and the arrival of spring. 

The saint&#x27;s hagiographies &quot;are mainly anecdotes and miracle stories, some of which are deeply rooted in Irish pagan folklore&quot;. Dáithí Ó hÓgáin wrote that the melding of pagan goddess and Christian saint can be seen in some of the saint&#x27;s miracles, where she multiplies food, bestows cattle and sheep, controls the weather, and is linked with fire or thermal springs.

This theory is contested, however, with many scholars including Elva Johnston arguing that the significance of the pagan goddess has been exaggerated at the historical figure&#x27;s expense. Johnston has written &quot;the argument for the priority of the goddess over the saint depends on three interrelated points: firstly, that Brigit is not real, secondly that her lives betray that they are an attempt to euhemerise a pagan deity and finally an underlying assumption that a goddess cult is more empowering for the women of ancient and, by analogy, contemporary Ireland&quot;.

In the late 12th century, Gerald of Wales wrote that nineteen nuns took turns in keeping a perpetual fire burning at Kildare in honour of Saint Brigid, and that this fire was kept burning since Brigid&#x27;s time. It has been suggested this fire originally belonged to a temple of Brigit the goddess. The Roman goddess Vesta and the Greek goddess Hestia had perpetual fires tended by priestesses. According to Gerald, it was ringed by a hedge that no man was allowed to cross, lest he be cursed.

The saint is associated with many holy wells and clootie wells in Ireland and Britain, where small strips of cloth or ribbons are left as part of a healing ritual. Celtic healing goddesses, such as Sirona and Coventina, were often associated with sacred springs. 

Saint Brigid&#x27;s Day is 1 February. It was originally &quot;Imbolc&quot;, the first day of spring in Irish tradition. Because Saint Brigid has been linked to the goddess Brigid, the festival of Imbolc is commonly associated with the goddess. 

Saint Brigid&#x27;s Day or &quot;Imbolc&quot; is traditionally a time for weather prognostication:
A tholus on Venus was named after Brigit by the International Astronomical Union in 1985. As the planetary nomenclature rules prohibit the use of national figures and religious figures from contemporary religions, this is a reference to the goddess rather than the saint.

== Neo-Paganism ==
Brigid is an important figure for some modern pagans, who emphasize her triple aspect. She is sometimes worshipped in conjunction with Lugh or Cernunnos.

==Name==
Middle Irish &quot;Brigit&quot; came to be spelled &quot;Briġid&quot; and &quot;Brighid&quot; by the early modern Irish period. Since the spelling reform of 1948, this has been spelled &quot;Bríd&quot; . The earlier form gave rise to various forms in the languages of Europe, starting from the Medieval Latin &quot;Brigida&quot;, and from there to English &quot;Bridget&quot;, French &quot;Brigitte,&quot; Swedish &quot;Birgitta&quot; and Finnish &quot;Piritta.&quot;

The name comes from Proto-Celtic &quot;*Brigantī&quot; and means &quot;the high one&quot; or &quot;the exalted one&quot;. It is cognate with the name of the ancient British goddess Brigantia, with whom Brigid is thought to have some relation. It is also cognate with the Old High German personal name &quot;Burgunt,&quot; and the Sanskrit word &quot;Bṛhatī&quot; (बृहती) &quot;high&quot;, an epithet of the Hindu dawn goddess Ushas. The ultimate source is Proto-Indo-European &quot;*bʰr̥ǵʰéntih₂&quot; (feminine form of &quot;*bʰérǵʰonts&quot;, &quot;high&quot;), derived from the root &quot;*bʰerǵʰ-&quot; (&quot;to rise&quot;). Xavier Delamarre, citing E. Campanile, suggests that Brigid could be a continuation of the Indo-European dawn goddess.

<text>A bride is a woman who is about to be married or who is a newlywed.

When marrying, if the bride&#x27;s future spouse is a man, he is usually referred to as the &quot;bridegroom&quot; or just &quot;groom&quot;. In Western culture, a bride may be attended by a maid, bridesman and one or more bridesmaids.

The word &quot;bride&quot; has its roots in the Old English word &quot;bryd&quot;, which is shared with other Germanic languages. In Western countries, brides typically wear white wedding dresses, a tradition started by Queen Victoria. The white dress was once considered a symbol of luxury due to the difficulties in laundering delicate white clothing. Today, Western brides may wear white, cream, or ivory dresses, regardless of their number of marriages.

In non-Western countries, brides often wear national dress, with white wedding dresses being uncommon in Asian cultures as it symbolizes mourning and death. Red, on the other hand, represents vibrancy and health and is commonly worn by brides in many Asian cultures. Brides may also wear multiple outfits, as seen in some traditions in Japan, India, and parts of the Arab world.

Bridal jewelry holds cultural significance, such as wedding rings in Western cultures, chura (red and white bangles) in Punjabi Sikh culture, and mangalsutra in Hindu culture. Brides often wear veils and carry bouquets, prayer books, or other tokens. Wedding traditions have evolved over time, including the cake-eating and the bride-cup, both of which had symbolic meanings.

In Christianity, the term &quot;Bride of Christ&quot; typically refers to the Church, spiritually betrothed to Jesus Christ. The interpretation of this term varies among different denominations.

==Etymology==

The word comes from the Old English &quot;, a word shared with other Germanic languages. Its further origin is unknown.

==Attire==
In Europe and North America, the typical attire for a bride is a formal dress, and a veil. Usually, in the &quot;white wedding&quot; model, the bride&#x27;s dress is bought specifically for the wedding, and is not in a style that could be worn for any subsequent events. Previously, until at least the middle of the 19th century, the bride generally wore her best dress, whatever color it was, or if the bride was well-off, she ordered a new dress in her favorite color and expected to wear it again.

For first marriages in Western countries, a white wedding dress is usually worn, a tradition started by Queen Victoria, who wore a white court dress for her wedding. Through the earlier parts of the 20th century, Western etiquette prescribed that a white dress should not be worn for subsequent marriages, since the wearing of white was mistakenly regarded by some as an ancient symbol of virginity, despite the fact that wearing white is a fairly recent development in wedding traditions, and its origin has more to do with conspicuous consumption from an era when a white dress was luxurious, even prodigal, because of difficulties with laundering delicate clothes. Today, Western brides frequently wear white, cream, or ivory dresses for any number of marriages; the color of the dress is not a comment on the bride&#x27;s sexual history.

Outside of Western countries, brides most commonly wear national dress. White wedding dresses are particularly uncommon in Asian traditions, because white is the color of mourning and death in those cultures. In many Asian cultures, red is usual for brides, as this colour indicates vibrance and health and has over time been associated with brides. However, in modern times other colours may be worn, or Western styles preferred. Regardless of colour in most Asian cultures bridal clothes are highly decorative, often covered with embroidery, beading or gold. In some traditions brides may wear more than one outfit; this is true, for example, in Japan, parts of India, and, archaically, in parts of the Arab world.

Particular styles of jewelry are often associated with bridal wear; for example wedding rings in most Western cultures, or chura (red and white bangles) in Punjabi Sikh culture. Hindu brides are presented with a mangalsutra during the wedding ceremony, which has much of the same significance as a wedding ring in other parts of the world. Wedding jewelry has traditionally been used to demonstrate the value of the bride&#x27;s dowry.

In addition to the gown, brides often wear a veil and carry a bouquet of flowers, a small heirloom such as a lucky coin, a prayer book, or other token. In Western countries, a bride may wear &quot;something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue&quot;; a bridal purse (or money bag) is also common.

== History ==

The term &quot;bride&quot; appears in combination with many words, some of which are obsolete. Thus, &quot;bridegroom&quot; is a newly married man, and &quot;bride-bell,&quot; &quot;bride-banquet&quot; are old equivalents of wedding-bells, wedding-breakfast. &quot;Bridal&quot; (from &quot;Bride-ale&quot;), originally the wedding-feast itself, has grown into a general descriptive adjective, the &quot;bridal&quot; ceremony. The &quot;bride-cake&quot; had its origin in the Roman &quot;&quot;, an upper-class form of marriage, the essential features of whose ceremony were the eating by the couple of a cake made of salt, water and spelt flour, and the holding by the bride of three wheat-ears, a symbol of plenty.

The cake-eating went out of fashion, but the wheat ears survived. In the Middle Ages, they were either worn or carried by the bride. Eventually it became the custom for the young girls to assemble outside the church porch and throw grains of wheat over the bride, and afterwards a scramble for the grains took place. In time the wheat-grains came to be cooked into thin dry biscuits, which were broken over the bride&#x27;s head, as is the custom in Scotland today, an oatmeal cake being used. In Elizabeth I&#x27;s reign these biscuits began to take the form of small rectangular cakes made of eggs, milk, sugar, currants and spices. Every wedding guest had one at least, and the whole collection were thrown at the bride the instant she crossed the threshold. Those that lighted on her head or shoulders were most prized by the scramblers. At last these cakes became amalgamated into a large one that took on its full glories of almond paste and ornaments during Charles II&#x27;s time. But even today in rural parishes, e.g. north Notts, wheat is thrown over the bridal couple with the cry &quot;Bread for life and pudding for ever,&quot; expressive of a wish that the newly wed may be always affluent. The throwing of rice, a very ancient custom but one later than the wheat, is symbolical of the wish that the bridal may be fruitful.

The &quot;bride-cup&quot; was the bowl or loving cup in which the bridegroom pledged the bride, and she him. The custom of breaking this wine-cup, after the bridal couple had drained its contents, is common to both the Greek Christians and members of the Jewish faith. It is thrown against a wall or trodden under foot. The phrase &quot;bride-cup&quot; was also sometimes used of the bowl of spiced wine prepared at night for the bridal couple. &quot;Bride-favours&quot;, anciently called bride-lace, were at first pieces of gold, silk or other lace, used to bind up the sprigs of rosemary formerly worn at weddings. These took later the form of bunches of ribbons, which were at last metamorphosed into rosettes.

The &quot;bride-wain&quot;, the wagon in which the bride was driven to her new home, gave its name to the weddings of any poor deserving couple, who drove a &quot;wain&quot; round the village, collecting small sums of money or articles of furniture towards their housekeeping. These were called bidding-weddings, or bid-ales, which were in the nature of &quot;benefit&quot; feasts. So general is still the custom of &quot;bidding-weddings&quot; in Wales, that printers usually keep the form of invitation in type. Sometimes as many as six hundred couples will walk in the bridal procession.

The &quot;bride&#x27;s wreath&quot; is a Christian substitute for the gilt coronet all Jewish brides wore. The crowning of the bride is still observed by the Russians, and the Calvinists of Holland and Switzerland. The wearing of orange blossoms is said to have started with the Saracens, who regarded them as emblems of fecundity. It was introduced into Europe by the Crusaders. The &quot;bride&#x27;s veil&quot; is the modern form of the &quot;&quot; or large yellow veil that completely enveloped the Greek and Roman brides during the ceremony. Such a covering is still in use among the Jews and the Persians.

The &quot;bride&#x27;s crate&quot; was the bride&#x27;s container to gather all the things for the wedding in Hungary. Once all the underwear and clothes were finished, the girl was ready for marriage.

== Religion ==

=== Christianity ===

In Christianity, bride, the Lamb&#x27;s wife, or the Bride of Christ, is a term that generally describes the Church (followers of Christ) spiritually betrothed to Jesus Christ. The term is found in related verses in the Bible that describe a woman, in the Gospels, the Book of Revelation, the Epistles and related verses in the Old Testament. Sometimes, the Bride is implied by calling Jesus a bridegroom to the Church. For over 1500 years, the Church was identified as the bride betrothed to Christ. However, there are instances of the interpretation of the usage of varying from church to church. Most believe that it always refers to the church. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the bride must always wear a white dress when getting married in the church temple, and nothing but white is allowed.

<text>In mathematics, the winding number or winding index of a closed curve in the plane around a given point is an integer representing the total number of times that the curve travels counterclockwise around the point, i.e., the curve&#x27;s number of turns. For certain open plane curves, the number of turns may be a non-integer. The winding number depends on the orientation of the curve, and it is negative if the curve travels around the point clockwise.

Winding numbers are fundamental objects of study in algebraic topology, and they play an important role in vector calculus, complex analysis, geometric topology, differential geometry, and physics (such as in string theory).

==Intuitive description==
Suppose we are given a closed, oriented curve in the &quot;xy&quot; plane. We can imagine the curve as the path of motion of some object, with the orientation indicating the direction in which the object moves. Then the winding number of the curve is equal to the total number of counterclockwise turns that the object makes around the origin.

When counting the total number of turns, counterclockwise motion counts as positive, while clockwise motion counts as negative. For example, if the object first circles the origin four times counterclockwise, and then circles the origin once clockwise, then the total winding number of the curve is three.

Using this scheme, a curve that does not travel around the origin at all has winding number zero, while a curve that travels clockwise around the origin has negative winding number. Therefore, the winding number of a curve may be any integer. The following pictures show curves with winding numbers between −2 and 3:

==Formal definition==

Let formula_1 be a continuous closed path on the plane minus one point. The winding number of formula_2 around formula_3 is the integer

:formula_4

where formula_5 is the path written in polar coordinates, i.e. the lifted path through the covering map

:formula_6

The winding number is well defined because of the existence and uniqueness of the lifted path (given the starting point in the covering space) and because all the fibers of formula_7 are of the form formula_8 (so the above expression does not depend on the choice of the starting point). It is an integer because the path is closed.

==Alternative definitions==
Winding number is often defined in different ways in various parts of mathematics. All of the definitions below are equivalent to the one given above:

===Alexander numbering===

A simple combinatorial rule for defining the winding number was proposed by August Ferdinand Möbius in 1865
and again independently by James Waddell Alexander II in 1928.
Any curve partitions the plane into several connected regions, one of which is unbounded. The winding numbers of the curve around two points in the same region are equal. The winding number around (any point in) the unbounded region is zero. Finally, the winding numbers for any two adjacent regions differ by exactly 1; the region with the larger winding number appears on the left side of the curve (with respect to motion down the curve).

===Differential geometry===
In differential geometry, parametric equations are usually assumed to be differentiable (or at least piecewise differentiable). In this case, the polar coordinate &quot;θ&quot; is related to the rectangular coordinates &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; by the equation:
:formula_9
Which is found by differentiating the following definition for θ:
:formula_10 
By the fundamental theorem of calculus, the total change in &quot;θ&quot; is equal to the integral of &quot;dθ&quot;. We can therefore express the winding number of a differentiable curve as a line integral:
:formula_11
The one-form &quot;dθ&quot; (defined on the complement of the origin) is closed but not exact, and it generates the first de Rham cohomology group of the punctured plane. In particular, if &quot;ω&quot; is any closed differentiable one-form defined on the complement of the origin, then the integral of &quot;ω&quot; along closed loops gives a multiple of the winding number.

===Complex analysis===
Winding numbers play a very important role throughout complex analysis (c.f. the statement of the residue theorem). In the context of complex analysis, the winding number of a closed curve formula_2 in the complex plane can be expressed in terms of the complex coordinate . Specifically, if we write &quot;z&quot; = &quot;re&quot;&quot;iθ&quot;, then

:formula_13

and therefore

:formula_14

As formula_2 is a closed curve, the total change in formula_16 is zero, and thus the integral of formula_17 is equal to formula_18 multiplied by the total change in formula_19. Therefore, the winding number of closed path formula_2 about the origin is given by the expression

:formula_21

More generally, if formula_2 is a closed curve parameterized by formula_23, the winding number of formula_2 about formula_25, also known as the &quot;index&quot; of formula_25 with respect to formula_2, is defined for complex formula_28 as

:formula_29

This is a special case of the famous Cauchy integral formula.

Some of the basic properties of the winding number in the complex plane are given by the following theorem:

Theorem. &quot;Let formula_30 be a closed path and let formula_31 be the set complement of the image of formula_2, that is, formula_33. Then the index of formula_34 with respect to formula_2,&quot;formula_36&quot;is (i) integer-valued, i.e., formula_37 for all formula_38; (ii) constant over each component (i.e., maximal connected subset) of formula_31; and (iii) zero if formula_34 is in the unbounded component of formula_31.&quot;

As an immediate corollary, this theorem gives the winding number of a circular path formula_2 about a point formula_34. As expected, the winding number counts the number of (counterclockwise) loops formula_2 makes around formula_34:

Corollary. &quot;If formula_2 is the path defined by formula_47, then&quot; formula_48

===Topology===
In topology, the winding number is an alternate term for the degree of a continuous mapping. In physics, winding numbers are frequently called topological quantum numbers. In both cases, the same concept applies.

The above example of a curve winding around a point has a simple topological interpretation. The complement of a point in the plane is homotopy equivalent to the circle, such that maps from the circle to itself are really all that need to be considered. It can be shown that each such map can be continuously deformed to (is homotopic to) one of the standard maps formula_49, where multiplication in the circle is defined by identifying it with the complex unit circle. The set of homotopy classes of maps from a circle to a topological space form a group, which is called the first homotopy group or fundamental group of that space. The fundamental group of the circle is the group of the integers, Z; and the winding number of a complex curve is just its homotopy class.

Maps from the 3-sphere to itself are also classified by an integer which is also called the winding number or sometimes Pontryagin index.

==Turning number==

One can also consider the winding number of the path with respect to the tangent of the path itself. As a path followed through time, this would be the winding number with respect to the origin of the velocity vector. In this case the example illustrated at the beginning of this article has a winding number of 3, because the small loop &quot;is&quot; counted.

This is only defined for immersed paths (i.e., for differentiable paths with nowhere vanishing derivatives), and is the degree of the tangential Gauss map.

This is called the turning number, rotation number, rotation index or index of the curve, and can be computed as the total curvature divided by 2.

=== Polygons ===

In polygons, the turning number is referred to as the polygon density. For convex polygons, and more generally simple polygons (not self-intersecting), the density is 1, by the Jordan curve theorem. By contrast, for a regular star polygon {&quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot;}, the density is &quot;q&quot;.

=== Space curves ===
Turning number cannot be defined for space curves as degree requires matching dimensions. However, for locally convex, closed space curves, one can define tangent turning sign as formula_50, where formula_51 is the turning number of the stereographic projection of its tangent indicatrix. Its two values correspond to the two non-degenerate homotopy classes of locally convex curves. 

==Winding number and Heisenberg ferromagnet equations==
The winding number is closely related with the (2 + 1)-dimensional continuous Heisenberg ferromagnet equations and its integrable extensions: the Ishimori equation etc. Solutions of the last equations are classified by the winding number or topological charge (topological invariant and/or topological quantum number).

==Applications==

=== Point in polygon ===

A point&#x27;s winding number with respect to a polygon can be used to solve the point in polygon (PIP) problem – that is, it can be used to determine if the point is inside the polygon or not.

Generally, the ray casting algorithm is a better alternative to the PIP problem as it does not require trigonometric functions, contrary to the winding number algorithm. Nevertheless, the winding number algorithm can be sped up so that it too, does not require calculations involving trigonometric functions. The sped-up version of the algorithm, also known as Sunday&#x27;s algorithm, is recommended in cases where non-simple polygons should also be accounted for.

<text>The image of Britannia () is the national personification of Britain as a helmeted female warrior holding a trident and shield. An image first used by the Romans in classical antiquity, the Latin was the name variously applied to the British Isles, Great Britain, and the Roman province of Britain during the Roman Empire. Typically depicted reclining or seated with spear and shield since appearing thus on Roman coins of the 2nd century AD, the classical national allegory was revived in the early modern period. On coins of the pound sterling issued by Charles II of England, Scotland, and Ireland, Britannia appears with her shield bearing the Union Flag. To symbolise the Royal Navy&#x27;s victories, Britannia&#x27;s spear became the characteristic trident in 1797, and a helmet was added to the coinage in 1825.

By the 1st century BC, Britannia replaced Albion as the prevalent Latin name for the island of Great Britain. After the Roman conquest in 43 AD, &quot;Britannia&quot; came to refer to the Roman province that encompassed the southern two-thirds of the island (see Roman Britain). The remaining third of the island, known to the Romans as Caledonia, lay north of the River Forth in modern Scotland. It was intermittently but not permanently occupied by the Roman army. The name is a Latinisation of the native Brittonic word for Great Britain, &quot;Pretanī&quot;, which also produced the Greek form &quot;Prettanike&quot; or &quot;Brettaniai&quot;.

In the 2nd century, Roman Britannia came to be personified as a goddess, armed with a spear and shield and wearing a Corinthian helmet. When Roman Britain was divided into four provinces in 197 AD, two were called Britannia Superior () in the south and Britannia Inferior () to the north. The name &quot;Britannia&quot; long survived the end of Roman rule in Britain in the 5th century and yielded the name for the island in most European and various other languages, including the English Britain and the modern Welsh &quot;Prydain&quot;. In the 9th century the associated terms &quot;Bretwalda&quot; and &quot;Brytenwealda&quot; were applied to some Anglo-Saxon kings to assert a wider hegemony in Britain and hyperbolic inscriptions on coins and titles in charters often included the equivalent title &quot;rex Britanniae&quot;. However, when England was unified the title used was &quot;rex Angulsaxonum&quot; (&#x27;king of the Anglo-Saxons&#x27;).

After centuries of declining use, the Latin form was revived during the English Renaissance as a rhetorical evocation of a British national identity. Especially following the Acts of Union in 1707, which joined the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, the personification of the martial Britannia was used as an emblem of British maritime power and unity, most notably in the patriotic song &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;.

A British cultural icon, she was featured on all modern British coinage series until the redesign in 2008, and still appears annually on the gold and silver &quot;Britannia&quot; bullion coin series. In 2015 a new definitive £2 coin was issued, with a new image of Britannia. She is also depicted in the Brit Awards statuette, the British Phonographic Industry&#x27;s annual music awards.

== Greek and Roman periods ==


The first writer to use a form of the name was the Greek explorer and geographer Pytheas in the 4th century BC. Pytheas referred to &quot;Prettanike&quot; or &quot;Brettaniai&quot;, a group of islands off the coast of North-Western Europe. In the 1st century BC, Diodorus Siculus referred to &quot;Pretannia&quot;, a rendering of the indigenous name for the &quot;Pretani&quot; people whom the Greeks believed to inhabit the British Isles. Following the Greek usage, the Romans referred to the &quot;Insulae Britannicae&quot; in the plural, consisting of &quot;Albion&quot; (Great Britain), &quot;Hibernia&quot; (Ireland), &quot;Thule&quot; (possibly Iceland or Orkney) and many smaller islands. Over time, Albion specifically came to be known as &quot;Britannia&quot;, and the name for the group was subsequently dropped.
Although the creation and unification of the province of Britannia is commonly attributed to the emperor Claudius in 43 AD, Julius Caesar had already established Roman authority over the Southern and Eastern Britain dynasties during his two expeditions to the island in 55 and 54 BC. Just as Caesar himself had been an &quot;obside&quot;, hostage, in Bithynia as a youth, he also had taken the King&#x27;s sons back to Rome as &quot;obsides&quot; and to be educated.

The Roman conquest of the island began in AD 43, leading to the establishment of the Roman province known in Latin as &quot;Britannia&quot;. The Romans never successfully conquered the whole island, building Hadrian&#x27;s Wall as a boundary with &quot;Caledonia&quot;, which covered roughly the territory of modern Scotland, although the whole of the boundary marked by Hadrian&#x27;s Wall lies within modern-day Northern England. A southern part of what is now Scotland was occupied by the Romans for about 20 years in the mid-2nd century AD, keeping in place the Picts to the north of the Antonine Wall. People living in the Roman province of Britannia were called &quot;Britanni&quot;, or Britons. Ireland, inhabited by the Scoti, was never invaded and was called Hibernia. Thule, an island &quot;six days&#x27; sail north of Britain, and [...] near the frozen sea&quot;, possibly Iceland, was also never invaded by the Romans.

Claudius paid a visit while Britain was being conquered and was honoured with the agnomen &quot;Britannicus&quot; as if he were the conqueror; a frieze discovered at Aphrodisias in 1980 shows a bare breasted and helmeted female warrior labelled , writhing in agony under the heel of the emperor. She appeared on coins issued under Hadrian, as a more regal-looking female figure. Britannia was soon personified as a goddess, looking fairly similar to the goddess Athena-Minerva - both are seated and replete with helmet, spear (trident) and shield. Early portraits of the goddess depict Britannia as a beautiful young woman, wearing a Corinthian helmet, and wrapped in a white garment with her right breast exposed. She is usually shown seated on a rock, holding a trident, and with a spiked shield propped beside her. Sometimes she holds a standard and leans on the shield. On another range of coinage, she is seated on a globe above waves: Britain at the edge of the (known) world. Similar coin types were also issued under Antoninus Pius.

== British revival ==

=== Medieval use ===

After the Roman withdrawal, the term &quot;Britannia&quot; remained in use in Britain and abroad. Latin was ubiquitous amongst native Brythonic writers and the term continued in the Welsh tradition that developed from it. Writing with variations on the term &quot;Britannia&quot; (or &quot;Prydein&quot; in the native language) appeared in many Welsh works such as the &quot;Historia Britonum&quot;, &quot;Armes Prydein&quot; and the 12th-century &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, which gained unprecedented popularity throughout western Europe during the High Middle Ages.

Following the migration of Brythonic Celts, the term &quot;Britannia&quot; also came to refer to the Armorican peninsula (at least from the 6th century). The modern English, French, Breton and Gallo names for the area, all derive from a literal use of &quot;Britannia&quot; meaning &quot;land of the Britons&quot;. The two &quot;Britannias&quot; gave rise to the term &quot;Grande Bretagne&quot; (Great Britain) to distinguish the island of Britain from the continental peninsula.

Following the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, the term &quot;Briton&quot; only referred to the native British, Celtic-speaking inhabitants of the province; this remained the case until the modern era. The use of the term as an inhabitant of the island of Great Britain or the UK is relatively recent.

=== Renaissance and British Empire ===

It was during the reign of Elizabeth I that &quot;Britannia&quot; again came to be used as a personification of Britain. In his 1576 &quot;General and rare memorials pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation&quot;, John Dee used a frontispiece figure of Britannia kneeling by the shore beseeching Elizabeth I, to protect her empire by strengthening her navy.

With the death of Elizabeth in 1603 came the succession of her Scottish cousin, James VI, King of Scots, to the English throne. He became James I of England, and so brought under his personal rule the Kingdoms of England (and the dominion of Wales), Ireland and Scotland. On 20 October 1604, James VI and I proclaimed himself as &quot;King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland&quot;, a title that continued to be used by many of his successors. When James came to the English throne, some elaborate pageants were staged. One pageant performed on the streets of London in 1605 was described in Anthony Munday&#x27;s &quot;Triumphs of Reunited Britannia&quot;:
On a mount triangular, as the island of Britain itself is described to be, we seat in the supreme place, under the shape of a fair and beautiful nymph, Britannia herself...

Britain&#x27;s first road atlas was updated in a series of editions titled from the early 18th into the early 19th century using the title &quot;Britannia Depicta&quot;.

During the reign of Charles II, Britannia made her first appearance on English coins on a farthing of 1672 (see &quot;Depiction on British coinage and postage stamps&quot; below). With the constitutional unification of England with Scotland in 1707 and then with Ireland in 1800, Britannia became an increasingly important symbol and a strong rallying point among Britons.

British power, which depended on a liberal political system and the supremacy of the navy, lent these attributes to the image of Britannia. By the time of Queen Victoria, Britannia had been renewed. Still depicted as a young woman with brown or golden hair, she kept her Corinthian helmet and her white robes, but now she held Neptune&#x27;s trident and often sat or stood before the ocean and tall-masted ships representing British naval power. She also usually held or stood beside a Greek hoplite shield, which sported the British Union Flag: also at her feet was often the British Lion, an animal found on the arms of England, Scotland and the Prince of Wales.

Neptune is shown symbolically passing his trident to Britannia in the 1847 fresco &quot;Neptune Resigning to Britannia the Empire of the Sea&quot; by William Dyce, a painting Victoria commissioned for her Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.

New Zealanders adopted a similar personification of their country in Zealandia, Britannia&#x27;s daughter, who appeared on postage stamps at the turn of the 20th century and still features in the New Zealand Coat of Arms.

Perhaps the best analogy is that Britannia is to the United Kingdom and the British Empire what Marianne is to France or perhaps what Columbia is to the United States. Britannia became a very potent and more common figure in times of war, and represented British liberties and democracy.

=== Modern associations ===

During the 1990s the term &quot;Cool Britannia&quot; (drawn from a humorous version by the Bonzo Dog Band of the song &quot;Rule Britannia&quot;, with words by James Thomson [1700–1748], which is often used as an unofficial national anthem), was used to describe the contemporary United Kingdom. The phrase referred to the fashionable scenes of the era, with a new generation of pop groups and style magazines, successful young fashion designers, and a surge of new restaurants and hotels. Cool Britannia represented late-1990s Britain as a fashionable place to be.

Britannia is sometimes used in political cartoons to symbol the United Kingdom&#x27;s relationship with other countries.

=== Depiction on British currency and postage stamps ===

==== Coinage ====

Although the archetypical image of Britannia seated with a shield first appeared on Roman bronze coins of the 1st century AD struck under Hadrian, Britannia&#x27;s first appearance on British coinage was on the farthing in 1672, though earlier pattern versions had appeared in 1665, followed by the halfpenny later the same year. The figure of Britannia was said by Samuel Pepys to have been modelled on Frances Teresa Stuart, the future Duchess of Richmond, who was famous at the time for refusing to become the mistress of Charles II, despite the King&#x27;s strong infatuation with her. Britannia then appeared on the British halfpenny coin throughout the rest of the 17th century and thereafter until 1936. The halfpennies issued during the reign of Queen Anne have Britannia closely resembling the queen herself. When the Bank of England was granted a charter in 1694, the directors decided within days that the device for their official seal should represent &#x27;Brittannia sitting on looking on a Bank of Mony&#x27; (sic). Britannia also appeared on the penny coin between 1797 and 1967, occasional issues such as the fourpence under William IV between 1836 and 1837, and on the 50 pence coin between 1969 and 2008. See &quot;External Links&quot; below for examples of all these coins and others.

In the spring of 2008, the Royal Mint unveiled new coin designs &quot;reflecting a more modern twenty-first century Britain&quot; which do not feature the image of Britannia. The government pointed out, however, that earlier-design 50p coins will remain in circulation for the foreseeable future. Also Britannia still appeared on the gold and silver &quot;Britannia&quot; bullion coins issued annually by the Royal Mint.

A new definitive £2 coin was issued in 2015, with a new image of Britannia. In late 2015, a limited edition (100000 run) £50 coin was produced, bearing the image of Britannia on one side and Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse.

In October 2020, The Royal Mint released the 2021 Britannia bullion coin range. The original 1987 coin design by Philip Nathan was enhanced with new security features. The Royal Mint claims this makes the Britannia &quot;the world&#x27;s most visually secure bullion coin.&quot; The security features include a latent image, micro-text, surface animation and tincture lines.

In 2021, the Royal Mint issued a new range of commemorative coins featuring a redesigned Britannia as a woman of colour.

==== Banknotes ====


A figure of Britannia appeared on the &quot;white fiver&quot; (a five pound note printed in black and white) from 1855 for more than a century, until 1957.

From 1928 &quot;Britannia Series A&quot; ten shilling and one pound notes were printed with a seated Britannia bearing both a spear and an olive branch.

The 25 cents fractional paper currency of the Dominion of Canada (1870, 1900 and 1923 respectively) all depict Britannia.

==== Postage stamps ====

Britannia also featured on the high value Great Britain definitive postage stamps issued during the reign of George V (known as &#x27;seahorses&#x27;) and is depicted on the £10 stamp first issued in 1993.

=== Britannia watermark in paper ===

The Britannia watermark has been widely used in papermaking, usually showing her seated. An example can be found at papermoulds.typepad.com

=== Brit Awards ===

Britannia is depicted in the Brit Award statuette, the British Phonographic Industry&#x27;s annual music awards. The statuette of Britannia has been regularly redesigned by some of the best known British designers, stylists and artists, including Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, Sir Peter Blake and also the late Dame Vivienne Westwood and Dame Zaha Hadid.

<text>Edgardo Díaz Meléndez (born 1947) is a Puerto Rican music producer and songwriter. He is the creator of the &quot;boy band&quot; Menudo.

== Early life ==
Díaz was born in Panama City, Panama to Puerto Rican parents &quot;Nacho&quot; Diaz and his wife &quot;Panchi&quot;, Díaz grew up in Miami, Florida.

== Career ==
Díaz moved to Spain after graduating from school and he worked with a group that was widely successful, La Pandilla, which had 4 boys and 1 girl, Mari Blanca, (now a Veterinarian in her home country), but after the &quot;La Pandilla&quot; members grew up, he moved back to Puerto Rico, and created Menudo. Díaz managed Menudo from 1977 to the group&#x27;s era as MDO&quot;.&quot;

At the time he started to manage Menudo, Diaz was also the director of a young-adult oriented band named &quot;Aquamarina&quot;.

In 2004, Díaz signed Daniela Lujan to manage the Mexican singer and actress&#x27; career.

== Personal ==
Diaz was once romantically linked to the Puerto Rican actress and singer Millie Aviles.

Diaz lived for two years in Ecuador.

== Allegations ==
In 1991, Diaz was accused by an ex-member of Menudo of sexual abuse on a May 1991 Univisión Television Program &quot;Cristina Show&quot;. He denied the allegations. Diaz has been the recipient of several sexual crime allegations by former Menudo members, including Ralphy Rodriguez and Roy Rossello, who accused him of sexual abuse during a Brazilian reality show on 21 October 2014.

On 20 November 2014, Rene Farrait, another former Menudo member, told the Telemundo show Suelta La Sopa: &quot;Unfortunately, there are many people in the communications world that really know what happened (at Menudo) and are playing stupid&quot;, when asked about abuse allegations by Diaz. He did not, however, mention anything about sexual abuse against him or his Menudo bandmates. &quot;He (Diaz) knows perfectly what happened there&quot;, Farrait told the show.

Former Los Chamos member Gabriel Fernandez, who was allegedly accepted into Menudo once, made similar allegations in 2021.

As of May 2nd 2023, Díaz was under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department over allegations that he sexually assaulted a former teenage member of the group in the 1980s. It is the first known criminal investigation surrounding Menudo and its creator by law enforcement.

== In popular culture ==
Díaz was played by Braulio Castillo Jr. and by Yamil Urena in the 2020 Amazon Prime Video series based on Menudo, &quot;Subete A Mi Moto&quot;.

In the sixth episode of &quot;&quot;, Diaz was portrayed by Hugo Medina.

<text>In Irish mythology, Bodb Derg (Old Irish, ) or Bodhbh Dearg (Middle Irish and Modern Irish, ) was a son of Eochaid Garb or the Dagda, and the Dagda&#x27;s successor as King of the Tuatha Dé Danann.

== Name ==

The name Bodb could be a cognate of &quot;bádhbh&quot; as it has a similar pronunciation; Bodb Derg would then mean &quot;Red Crow&quot;. Given the fluidity of Old Irish scribal practice, the name of the female mythological character Badb was occasionally spelled Bodb as well.

== Mythology ==

Aengus asks for his brother Bodb&#x27;s help in finding the woman of his dreams in &quot;Aislinge Óenguso&quot; (the Dream of Aengus). At the time, Bodb is king of the &quot;síde&quot; of Munster. Bodb successfully identifies the woman as Caer Ibormeith.

Following the Tuatha Dé Danann&#x27;s defeat in the battle of Tailtiu, Bodb is elected king of the Tuatha Dé Danann in the &quot;Children of Lir&quot;, just as the Tuatha Dé are going underground to dwell in the &quot;sídhe&quot;. The principle justification given for Bodb&#x27;s election is that he is the Dagda&#x27;s eldest son. He subsequently fathered many deities. Bodb&#x27;s election is recognised by all of his rivals, save only Lir, who refuses him homage. Bodb, however, counsels his followers to forbear from punishing Lir; later, Bodb will successively offer two of his own daughters in marriage to Lir to placate him. Both marriages, however, end unhappily.

In variants of the story, Manannan is named the high king over the Tuatha Dé along with Bodb Derg when the Tuatha Dé Danann descend into the sidhe; Manannan is called “chief of the kings” and owner of every sidhe and divides the sidhe mounds amongst the Tuatha Dé.

As king of the Munster &quot;síde&quot; with Lén as his smith, Bodb Sída ar Femen (&#x27;of the Mound on Femen&#x27;) plays a role in an important prefatory tale to &quot;Táin Bó Cuailnge,&quot; for it is his swineherd who quarrels with that of the king of the Connacht &quot;síde&quot;; the swineherds are later swallowed and reborn as the magical bulls Donn Cuailnge and Finnbennach, of which the former was the object of the great cattle-raid.

In one Fenian tale, Bodb leads the Tuatha Dé Danann to the aid of the Fianna at the Battle of Ventry.

<text>Borvo or Bormo (Gaulish: *&quot;Borwō&quot;, &quot;Bormō&quot;) was an ancient Celtic god of healing springs worshipped in Gaul and Gallaecia. He was sometimes identified with the Graeco-Roman god Apollo, although his cult had preserved a high degree of autonomy during the Roman period.

== Name ==

The Gaulish theonym &quot;Boruō&quot; means &#x27;hot spring&#x27;, &#x27;warm source&#x27;. It stems from the Proto-Celtic verbal root *&quot;berw&quot;- (&#x27;boil, brew&#x27;; cf. Old Irish &quot;berbaid&quot;, Middle Welsh &quot;berwi&quot;), itself from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;bʰerw&quot;- (&#x27;boil, brew&#x27;; cf. Latin &quot;ferueō&quot; &#x27;to be intensely hot, boil&#x27;, Sanskrit &quot;bhurváni&quot; &#x27;agitated, wild&#x27;). The &quot;Bhearú&quot; river (River Barrow) in Ireland has also been linked to this Celtic root.

The variant &quot;Bormō&quot; could have emerged from a difference in suffixes or from dissimilation. Known derivates include &quot;Bormanicus&quot; (Caldas de Vizela), from an earlier *&quot;Borwānicos&quot;, and &quot;Bormanus&quot; or &quot;Borbanus&quot; (Aix-en-Diois, Aix-en-Provence), from an earlier *&quot;Borwānos&quot;. A goddess named &quot;Boruoboendoa&quot;, perhaps reflecting the Gaulish theonym *&quot;Buruo-bouinduā&quot; or *&quot;Buruo-bō-uinduā&quot;, has also been found in Utrecht.

The toponyms Bourbon-l&#x27;Archambault, Bourbon-Lancy, Bourbonne-les-Bains, Boulbon, Bormes, Bourbriac, La Bourboule and Worms are derived from &quot;Borvo&quot; or from its variant &quot;Bormo&quot;. The names of various small rivers in France, such as &quot;Bourbouillon&quot;, &quot;Bourban&quot;, and &quot;Bourbière&quot;, also stem from the theonym.

==Centres of worship==

In Gaul, he was particularly worshipped at Bourbonne-les-Bains, in the territory of the Lingones, where ten inscriptions are recorded. Two other inscriptions are recorded, one (CIL 13, 02901) from Entrains-sur-Nohain and the other (CIL 12, 02443) from Aix-en-Savoie in Gallia Narbonensis. Votive tablets inscribed ‘Borvo’ show that the offerers desired healing for themselves or others. Many of the sites where offerings to Borvo have been found are in Gaul: inscriptions to him have been found in Drôme at Aix-en-Diois, Bouches-du-Rhône at Aix-en-Provence, Gers at Auch, Allier at Bourbon-l&#x27;Archambault, Savoie at Aix-les-Bains, Saône-et-Loire at Bourbon-Lancy, in Savoie at Aix-les-Bains, Haute-Marne at Bourbonne-les-Bains and in Nièvre at Entrains-sur-Nohain. 

Findings have also been uncovered in the Netherlands at Utrecht, where he is called Boruoboendua Vabusoa Labbonus, and in Portugal at Vizela and at Idanha-a-Velha, where he is called Borus and identified with Mars. At Aix-en-Provence, he was referred to as Borbanus and Bormanus but at Vizela in Portugal, he was hailed as Bormanicus, and at Burtscheid and at Worms in Germany as Borbetomagus.
==Divine entourage==
Borvo was frequently associated with a divine consort, usually Damona (Bourbonne, Bourbon-Lancy), but sometimes also Bormana when he was worshipped by the name Bormanus (Die, Aix-en-Diois). Bormana was in some areas worshipped independently of her male counterpart, such as at Saint-Vulbas.

Borvo bore similarities to the goddess Sirona, who was also a healing deity associated with mineral springs. According to some scholars, Sirona may have been his mother.

In other areas, Borvo&#x27;s partner is the goddess Bormana. Bormana was, in some areas, worshipped independently of her male counterpart. Gods like Borvo, and others, equated with Apollo, presided over healing springs, and they are usually associated with goddesses, as their husbands or sons. He is found in Drôme at Aix-en-Diois with Bormana and in Saône-et-Loire at Bourbon-Lancy and in Haute-Marne at Bourbonne-les-Bains with Damona but he is accompanied by the ‘candid spirit’ Candidus in Nièvre at Entrains-sur-Nohain. In the Netherlands at Utrecht as Boruoboendua Vabusoa Lobbonus, he is found in the company of a Celtic Hercules, Macusanus and Baldruus.

<text>Bartholomaeus Anglicus (before 1203–1272), also known as Bartholomew the Englishman and Berthelet, was an early 13th-century Scholastic of Paris, a member of the Franciscan order. He was the author of the compendium &quot;De proprietatibus rerum&quot; (&quot;On the Properties of Things&quot;), dated c.1240, an early forerunner of the encyclopedia and a widely cited book in the Middle Ages. Bartholomew also held senior positions within the church and was appointed Bishop of Łuków in what is now Poland, although he was not consecrated to that position.

==Early life==

Little is known of Bartholomew&#x27;s early life. He is believed to have been born around the turn of the 13th century to unknown parents. The first record of him was in 1224 in Paris as a teacher, although he is also believed to have studied at Oxford University.

==Encyclopedia==

The work De proprietatibus rerum was written at the school of Magdeburg in Saxonia and intended for the use of students and the general public. Bartholomew carefully notes the sources for the material included, although, at present, it is sometimes impossible to identify or locate some of them. His annotations give a good idea of the wide variety of works available to a medieval scholar.

The original Latin work was translated into French in 1372 and a number of manuscripts of the Latin and French versions survive. The work was later printed in numerous editions. John Trevisa produced an English translation in 1397. Extracts were compiled by Robert Steele under the title &quot;Medieval Lore: an Epitome&quot; (1893). A critical edition of Trevisa&#x27;s translation appeared in 1975.
The work was organized in 19 books. The subjects of the books, in order, are God, angels (including demons), the human mind or soul, physiology, of ages (family and domestic life), medicine, the universe and celestial bodies, time, form and matter (elements), air and its forms, water and its forms, earth and its forms including geography, gems, minerals and metals, animals, and color, odor, taste and liquids.

==Church positions==

Bartholomew was elected as Minister of Austria in 1247 and was then elected as Minister of Bohemia in 1255. This appointment included Poland where he resolved a dispute between Duke Boleslaw and the Cathedral Chapter at Kraków. Pope Alexander IV appointed him as Papal legate north of the Carpathians in 1256 and appointed him as the Bishop of Łuków. However, he was probably not consecrated in that position due to the second Mongol invasion of Poland in 1259. Bartholomew was appointed as Minister at Saxonia in 1262 and served in that position until his death in 1272.

He was at some point confused with Bartholomeus de Glanvilla, another Franciscan friar who lived a century later.

<text>Branwen, Daughter of Llŷr is a major character in the Second Branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot;, which is sometimes called the &quot;Mabinogi of Branwen&quot; after her.

Branwen is a daughter of Llŷr and Penarddun. She is married to Matholwch, King of Ireland, but the marriage does not bring peace.

==Her story==
The story opens with Branwen&#x27;s brother, Brân the Blessed, giant and King of Britain, sitting on a rock by the sea at Harlech and seeing the vessels of Matholwch, King of Ireland, approaching. Matholwch has come to ask for the hand of Branwen in marriage. Brân agrees to this, and a feast is held to celebrate the betrothal. During the feast, Efnysien, a half-brother of Branwen and Brân, arrives at the stables and asks of the nature of the celebration. On being told, he is furious that his half sister has been given in marriage without his consent, and flying into a rage he mutilates the horses belonging to the Irish. Matholwch is deeply offended, but conciliated by Brân, who gives him a magical cauldron which can bring the dead to life; he does not know that when the dead are brought back, they will be mute and deaf.

When Matholwch returns to Ireland with his new bride, he consults with his nobles about the occurrences in the Isle of the Mighty. They are outraged and believe that Matholwch was not compensated enough for the mutilation of his horses. In order to redeem his honor, Matholwch banishes Branwen to work in the kitchens.

Branwen is treated cruelly by her husband Matholwch as punishment for Efnysien&#x27;s mutilation of the horses, though not before she gives birth to an heir, Gwern. She tames a starling and sends it across the Irish Sea with a message to her brother and Brân brings a force from Wales to Ireland to rescue her.

Some swineherds see the giant Brân wading the sea and report this to Matholwch, who retreats beyond a river and destroys the bridges. However, Brân lays himself down over the river to serve as a bridge for his men, he said (&quot;He would be a leader, let him be a bridge&quot;).

Matholwch, fearing war, tries to reconcile with Brân by building a house big enough for him to fit into in order to do him honour. Matholwch agrees to give the kingdom to Gwern, his son by Branwen, to pacify Brân. The Irish lords do not like the idea, and many hide themselves in flour bags tied to the pillars of the huge, newly built house to attack the Welsh.

Efnysien, inspecting the house prior to the arrival of Brân and his men, uncovers the men hidden in the bags and kills them all by crushing their heads one by one. At the subsequent feast to celebrate Gwern&#x27;s investiture as King of Ireland, Efnysien, in an unprovoked moment of rage, throws his nephew Gwern into the fire. This causes chaos between the two countries, and they start fighting each other. The Irish forces at first appear to be losing, but by resurrecting their dead soldiers using the magical cauldron begin to win the battle. However, Efnysien sees what he has done, and regrets it. Disguised as a dead Irish soldier he is thrown into the magical cauldron, and pushes against its walls so that it breaks into four pieces. Efnysien dies in the attempt. The war is still extremely bloody, and leaves no survivors except for Branwen, Bran, and seven Welsh soldiers. They sail home to Wales.

Upon reaching Wales, they realize that Bran has been hit by a poisoned arrow to his leg, and he dies. Branwen, overwhelmed with grief for everyone she has lost, dies of a broken heart.

==War against Ireland==
In the ensuing war, all the Irish are killed save for five pregnant women who lived in Wales who repopulate the island, while only seven of the Welsh survive to return home with Branwen, taking with them the severed head of Bendigeidfran. On landing in Wales at Aber Alaw in Anglesey, Branwen dies of grief that so much destruction had been caused on her account, crying, , &quot;Oh Son of God, woe to me that I was born! Two fair islands have been laid waste because of me!&quot; She was buried beside the Afon Alaw.

Brân had commanded his men to cut off his head and to &quot;bear it even unto the White Mount, in London, and bury it there, with the face towards France.&quot; And so for seven years, his men spent feasting in Harlech, accompanied by three singing birds and Brân&#x27;s head. After the seven years they go to Gwales in Penfro, where they remain for eighty years. Eventually, they go to London and bury the head of Brân in the White Mount. Legend said that as long as the head was there, no invasion would come over the sea to Britain.

==Branwen&#x27;s Grave==
At Llanddeusant, Anglesey on the banks of the Alaw can be found the cairn called , her supposed grave. Now in ruins, it still has one standing stone. It was dug up in 1800, and again in the 1960s by Frances Lynch, who found several urns with human ashes. It is believed that if the story of Branwen is based on real events, these must have taken place during the Bedd Branwen Period of Bronze Age British history.

<text>Penarddun is a figure in Welsh mythology, the wife of Llŷr. The Second Branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot; names Bran, Branwen, and Manawydan as her children by Llŷr, and ascribes to her two additional sons by Euroswydd: Nisien, a good man, and Efnysien, a conniving troublemaker. The Welsh Triads call Llŷr one of the Three Exalted Prisoners of Britain for his captivity at Euroswydd&#x27;s hands; this likely refers to a lost tradition of the birth of Penarddun&#x27;s younger sons. The &quot;Mabinogi&quot; names Penarddun as a daughter of the ancestor Beli Mawr, but the genealogy is confused; it is possible she was meant to be his sister rather than daughter.

The name Penarddun can be translated as &quot;Chief Beauty&quot; or &quot;Most Fair&quot; (Welsh &quot;pen&quot; &quot;head, chief, foremost&quot; + &quot;arddun&quot; &quot;fair, beautiful (of a girl)&quot;.

<text>Euroswydd is a figure in Welsh mythology, the father of Nisien and Efnysien by Penarddun, daughter of Beli Mawr. In the Second Branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot; Penarddun is married to Llŷr, by whom her children are Brân, Branwen, and Manawydan. The circumstances of Nisien and Efnysien&#x27;s conception are not described, but one of the Welsh Triads mentions that Euroswydd had held Llŷr captive as one of the Three Exalted Prisoners of the Island of Britain; it is likely the traditions are connected.

It is possible he is the aging King in the Manx tale Y Chadee and father of Eshyn and Ny-Eshyn oddly familiar sounding names of a Good son (Eshyn) and a Bad son (Ny-Eshyn) which parallel what is said about Nisien and Efnisien in the tale of Branwen ferch Llyr, whom the later are considered only uterine brothers of Bran Fendigaid ab Llyr. Whilst the Manx tale never names the aging King properly except as King of Ellan Vannin (the Isle of Man).

<text>Efnisien fab Euroswydd (also spelled Efnissien or Efnysien) is a sadistic anti-hero in Welsh mythology, appearing prominently in the tale of &quot;Branwen ferch Llŷr&quot;, the second branch of the Mabinogi. Described by Will Parker as &quot;a study in the psychopathic personality&quot; and an &quot;embodiment of the forces of anti-social disruption,&quot; he is the catalyst of the tale&#x27;s ultimate tragedy, and is largely responsible for the destruction of both Ireland and the Island of the Mighty. He is the son of Euroswydd and Penarddun, twin brother to Nisien, and half-brother to Brân the Blessed, Manawydan, and Branwen. The Welsh Triads call Llŷr one of the Three Exalted Prisoners of Britain for his captivity at Euroswydd&#x27;s hands; this is likely to a lost tradition of the birth of Penarddun&#x27;s younger sons.

==Role in Welsh tradition==
The Irish king Matholwch sails to Harlech to speak with Brân the Blessed high king of the Island of the Mighty and to ask for the hand of his sister Branwen in marriage, thus forging an alliance between the two lands. Bendigeidfran agrees to Matholwch&#x27;s request, but the celebrations are cut short when Efnysien, a half-brother to the children of Llŷr, brutally mutilates Matholwch&#x27;s horses, angry that his permission was not sought in regards to the marriage. Matholwch is deeply offended until Bran offers him compensation in the form of a magic cauldron that can restore the dead to life. Pleased with the gift, Matholwch and Branwen sail back to Ireland to reign.

Once in Matholwch&#x27;s kingdom, Branwen gives birth to a son, Gwern, but Efnysien&#x27;s insult continues to rankle among the Irish and, eventually, Branwen is mistreated, banished to the kitchen and beaten every day. She tames a starling and sends it across the Irish Sea with a message to her brother Bran, who sails from Wales to Ireland to rescue her with his brother, Manawydan and a huge host of warriors, mustered from the 154 cantrefs of Britain. The Irish offer to make peace and build a house big enough to entertain Bendigeidfrân but hang a hundred bags inside, supposedly containing flour but actually containing armed warriors. Efnisien, suspecting treachery, reconnoitres the hall and kills the warriors by crushing their skulls. Later, at the feast, Efnysien, again feeling insulted, murders Gwern by burning him alive, and, as a result, a vicious battle breaks out. Seeing that the Irish are using the cauldron to revive their dead, he hides among the Irish corpses and is thrown into the cauldron by the unwitting enemy. He destroys the cauldron from within, sacrificing himself in the process.

Only seven men survive the conflict, among them Manawydan, Taliesin and Pryderi, prince of the Kingdom of Dyfed, Branwen having herself died of a broken heart. The survivors are told by a mortally wounded Bran to cut off his head and to return it to Britain. For seven years the seven survivors stay in Harlech, where they are entertained by Bendigeidfran&#x27;s head, which continues to speak. They later move on to Gwales (often identified with Grassholm off Dyfed) where they live for eighty years without perceiving the passing of time. Eventually, Heilyn fab Gwyn opens the door of the hall facing Cornwall and the sorrow of what had befallen them returns. As instructed they take the now silent head to the Gwynfryn, the &quot;White Hill&quot; (thought to be the location where the Tower of London now stands), where they bury it facing France so as to ward off invasion.

==Character analysis==

Described variously by modern scholars as &quot;warped&quot;, &quot;perverted&quot;, &quot;malicious&quot;, and &quot;psychopathic&quot;, Efnysien is often considered to be one of the most vivid and interesting characters to appear in the four branches. Referring to Efnysien&#x27;s atrocities throughout the tale, Will Parker writes:

Jeffrey Gantz describes him as, &quot;[T]he controlling force of &quot;Branwen&quot;...a story all by himself: progressively insecure and envious, cruel and sadistic, clever and resourceful, repentant and self-sacrificing.&quot;

The character has been compared to other trickster figures, such as the Irish hero Bricriu Nemthenga and the Norse god Loki. Nikolai Tolstoy describes Efnisien as &quot;the gallant if peevish Briton who selflessly sacrifices himself for his comrades&quot;, while he is characterised by Proinsias Mac Cana as a force of &quot;irrational malice and hate&quot;.

==In modern media==

*Efnisien appeared prominently in the 2003 film &quot;Otherworld&quot;, in which he was voiced by Welsh actor Alun Raglan.
* In 2006, Welsh singer-songwriter Elin Fflur released an EP entitled &quot;Ysbryd Efnisien&quot; (Efnisien&#x27;s Ghost).
* &quot;Evnyssien&quot; is the title of a song by Italian band Ataraxia.
* &#x27;A Hero&#x27;s Death&#x27; on &quot;Friends and Enemies; Lovers and Strangers&quot; by singer-songwriter Sharron Kraus tells the story of Efnisien.

<text>Matholwch, King of Ireland, is a character in the Second Branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot;, the tale of Branwen ferch Llŷr. 

The story opens with Bendigeidfran (Bran the Blessed), giant and king of Britain, sitting on a rock by the sea at Harlech and seeing the vessels of Matholwch approaching. Matholwch has come to ask for the hand of Bendigeidfran&#x27;s sister Branwen in marriage. Bendigeidfran agrees to this, and a feast is held to celebrate the betrothal. While the feast is going on, Efnisien, a half-brother of Branwen and Bendigeidfran, arrives and asks why there were celebrations. On being told, he is furious that his half-sister has been given in marriage without his consent and vents his spleen by mutilating Matholwch&#x27;s horses. Matholwch is deeply offended but is conciliated by Bran who gives him , a magical cauldron known as the cauldron of rebirth, which can bring the dead to life.

Once they are married, Matholwch treats Branwen cruelly and she is forced to work in the kitchens. Branwen tames a starling and gives it a message to carry across the Irish Sea to Bran, who sets out for Ireland to rescue her. When Matholwch sees the giant, he asks for peace and builds a house big enough for him. Matholwch agrees to give the kingdom to Gwern, his son by Branwen. The Irish lords do not like the idea, so they hide themselves in flour bags to attack the Welsh. Efnisien guesses what is happening and kills them by squeezing their heads inside the sacks, then throws Gwern into the fire.

In the ensuing war, all the Irish are killed save for five pregnant women who repopulate the island, while only seven of the Welsh survive to return home with Branwen, taking with them the severed head of Bendigeidfran. On landing in Wales at Aber Alaw Branwen dies of grief that so much destruction has been caused on her account.

<text>(meaning &quot;Alder&quot;) is a minor figure in Welsh tradition. He is the son of Matholwch, king of Ireland, and Branwen, sister to the king of Britain. He appears in the tale of &quot;Branwen, daughter of Llŷr&quot;, in which his murder at the hands of his sadistic uncle Efnysien sparks a mutually destructive battle between Britain and Ireland.

==Role in Welsh tradition==

===Background===
Matholwch, King of Ireland, sails across the Irish Sea to ask the British High King, Brân, for the hand of his sister Branwen in marriage. Bendigeidfran agrees to this, but during a feast to celebrate the betrothal, Efnisien, a half-brother of Branwen and Bendigeidfran, arrives and asks what was going on. When told, he is furious that Branwen has been given in marriage without his permission, and retaliates by mutilating Matholwch&#x27;s horses. Matholwch is deeply angered until Bendigeidfran gives him a magic cauldron which restores the dead to life.

Once in Ireland, Branwen is treated cruelly by her husband, Matholwch, and is forced to work in the kitchen. She tames a starling and sends it across the Irish Sea with a message to her brother Bendigeidfran, who sails from Wales to Ireland to rescue her with his brother, Manawydan and a host raised from the one hundred and fifty four cantrefs of Britain. The Irish offer to make peace by building a house big enough to entertain Bendigeidfrân but hang a hundred bags inside, supposedly containing flour but actually containing armed warriors. Efnisien, suspecting treachery, reconnoitres the hall and kills the warriors by crushing their skulls.

===Death===
To make peace between the kingdoms, Branwen and Matholwch&#x27;s young son, Gwern, ascends to the throne of Ireland and, during the feast held in the Great House in his honour, is called in turn to his uncles Bran, Manawydan and Nisien. He is then called to Efnysien who, seemingly without motive, throws the boy into the flames, burning him to death. Branwen attempts to rescue her son from the fire but is held back by Bendigeidfran.

===Aftermath===
As a result of Efnysien&#x27;s &quot;unspeakable crime&quot;, the two hosts rise up against each other and a vicious fighting begins. In the ensuing battle, the Irish at first have the advantage because of the magic cauldron. When the Irish dead are placed in it, they came to life and were able to fight as well as ever, though they cannot speak. Efnisien lies down among the dead and is placed in the cauldron, then breaks it, bursting his heart and dying in the process. The Welsh eventually win the war, but only seven men survived. Bendigeidfran himself is dying from a mortal wound in the foot, and orders that his head should be cut off and buried in London. When the survivors return to Britain, Branwen dies of grief from believing that she was the cause of the war; she is buried beside the River Alaw in Anglesey.

For seven years the seven survivors, amongst them Manawydan and Pryderi, stay in Harlech, where they are entertained by Bendigeidfran&#x27;s head, which continues to speak. They later move on to Gwales (often identified with Grassholm Island off Dyfed) where they live for eighty years without perceiving the passing of time. Eventually, one of the men opens the door of the hall facing Cornwall and the sorrow of what had befallen them returns. As instructed they take the now silent head to the &quot;Gwynfryn&quot;, the &quot;White Hill&quot; (thought to be the location where the Tower of London now stands), where they bury it facing France so as to ward off invasion. The imagery of the talking head is widely considered to derive from the ancient Celtic &quot;cult of the head&quot;; the head was considered the home of the soul.

===The Battle of the Trees===

A number of texts relate to &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot; or, The Battle of the Trees, a conflict between Arawn, king of the otherworld, and the children of Dôn, Amaethon, Gwydion and his nephew Lleu. The battle was fought on account of the &quot;white roebuck and the whelp&quot; stolen by Amaethon from the Otherworld. 

A great warrior fights alongside Arawn and cannot be overcome unless his name can be guessed by the opposing force. Gwydion, the Venedotian magician sings these englyns, identifying the warrior as Bran:

Bran is here identified by the &quot;sprigs of alder&quot; (&quot;gwern&quot;) on his shield. A number of scholars have suggested an association between Gwern&#x27;s role in &quot;Branwen&quot; and in the bardic tradition relating to the Battle of the Trees.

<text>Brân the Blessed ( or Brân Fendigaidd, literally &quot;Blessed Crow&quot;) is a giant and king of Britain in Welsh mythology. He appears in several of the Welsh Triads, but his most significant role is in the Second Branch of the Mabinogi, &quot;Branwen ferch Llŷr&quot;. He is a son of Llŷr and Penarddun, and the brother of Brânwen, Manawydan, Nisien and Efnysien. The name &quot;Brân&quot; in Welsh is usually translated as crow or raven.

==Role in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;==
The Irish king Matholwch sails to Harlech to speak with Brân the Blessed, high king of the Island of the Mighty and to ask for the hand of his sister Branwen in marriage, thus forging an alliance between the two islands. Brân agrees to Matholwch&#x27;s request, but the celebrations are cut short when Efnysien, a half-brother of Brân and Branwen, brutally mutilates Matholwch&#x27;s horses, angry that his permission was not sought in regard to the marriage. Matholwch is deeply offended until Brân offers him compensation in the form of a magic cauldron that can restore the dead to life. Pleased with the gift, Matholwch and Branwen sail back to Ireland to reign.

Once in Matholwch&#x27;s kingdom, Branwen gives birth to a son, Gwern, but Efnysien&#x27;s insult continues to rankle among the Irish, and eventually Branwen is mistreated, banished to the kitchen and beaten every day. She tames a starling and sends it across the Irish Sea with a message to her brother Brân. Brân wades across the Irish Sea to rescue her with his brother Manawydan and a huge host of warriors, mustered from the 154 cantrefi of Britain, following in ships. The Irish offer to make peace, and build a house big enough to entertain Brân, but they hang a hundred bags inside, supposedly containing flour but actually containing armed warriors. Efnysien, suspecting treachery, reconnoitres the hall and kills the warriors by crushing their skulls. Later, at the feast, Efnysien, again feeling insulted, murders Gwern by burning him alive, and a vicious battle breaks out. Seeing that the Irish are using the cauldron to revive their dead, he hides among the Irish corpses and is thrown into the cauldron by the unwitting enemy. He destroys the cauldron from within, sacrificing himself in the process.

Only seven men survive the conflict, among them Manawydan, Taliesin and Pryderi fab Pwyll, prince of Dyfed, Branwen having herself died of a broken heart. The survivors are told by a mortally wounded Brân to cut off his head and to return it to Britain. For seven years the seven survivors stay in Harlech, where they are entertained by Brân&#x27;s head, which continues to speak. They later move on to Gwales (often identified with Grassholm Island off Dyfed) where they live for eighty years without perceiving the passing of time. Eventually, Heilyn fab Gwyn opens the door of the hall facing Cornwall and the sorrow of what had befallen them returns. As instructed, they take the now silent head to the Gwynfryn, the &quot;White Hill&quot; (thought to be the location where the Tower of London now stands), where they bury it facing France so as to ward off invasion. The imagery of the talking head is widely considered to derive from the ancient Celtic &quot;cult of the head&quot;; the head was considered the home of the soul.

== Role in &quot;Branwen ferch Llŷr&quot; ==
King Bran was sitting on the rocky shore at Harlech when he saw thirteen ships over the horizon coming from Southern Ireland. Soon the boat men came to shore declaring the fleet belonged to the Irish Lord Matholwch who came seeking Bran&#x27;s sister Branwen&#x27;s hand in marriage. Of course to Bran this union made sense, someone worthy of his sister had come forth and their union would bring forth a powerful alliance for the two kingdoms. Bran readily welcomed King Matholwch of Ireland ashore and gave him great hospitality. The wedding was decidedly set at the coast to Aberffraw. All this had to be set inside specially erected tents since no house had yet been built that could accommodate the giant King Bran. Soon after all the wedding and celebration took place Bran&#x27;s half brother Efnysien returned to Wales and was puzzled to see so many foreign horses stabled. He asked whom the horses belonged and was enraged to find his sister had been given away without his consent. In his anger he maimed all the Irish horses by cutting their lips back to their gums, their ears down to their skulls, eyelids to eyeballs, and their tails to their rumps. Matholwch&#x27;s courtiers advised him to see this as a calculated insult from the Welsh and was in the end persuaded to head back home in dudgeon. Bran sent his best messengers to attempt to sway Matholwch. He sent with them a stick of solid silver as tall as himself and as thick as a finger along with a plate made of gold the circumference of his face. He also offered to replace every horse maimed and begged Matholwch to see his family dilemma, Bran could not execute his own brother. He begged to meet with the Irish King face to face so that he might make a humble apology. The two kings met again, however during the meeting Matholwch expressed his feeling that Bran&#x27;s compensation was too small. Bran could not stand for that, so he offered Matholwch a magic black cauldron that could bring the dead back to life on the condition they could not speak. Matholwch was astounded by this great gift and forgot all unpleasantries that had come before. The next morning the fleet of thirteen ships left for Ireland with Branwen and Matholwch side by side.
At first sight the Irish loved their new queen, and they brought many gifts to the castle celebrating Matholwch and Branwen&#x27;s union and in due time Branwen bore a son Gwern and the realm once again rejoiced. A few years passed and the counselors began to reflect once again on the maiming of the horses. They believed that Matholwch had not acted like a man and probed him to take out this injustice on his wife Branwen. The council made him expel her from his court and forced her to work in the kitchen. In the kitchen she faced being bullied by the cook and stared at by the kitchen boys who even boxed her ears. This mistreatment continued on for three years, in that time Branwen had been taming a starling to help take her mind off things. One day she fastened a letter to the starling meant for her brother Bran pleading for help. The bird made its way to Wales and dove from the sky during one of Bran&#x27;s legislative assemblies. What Bran read inside made him feel despair then fury. He declared war on the Irish to exact revenge for his beloved sister.

Bran led all his armies down the shore to Ireland. From the shore Matholwch&#x27;s swineherds saw an awesome sight, an entire landscape it seemed moving towards Ireland. They soon saw Bran wading through the water ahead of the fleet since no ship could carry him. The Irish ran across the river Shannon and barred the way from the sea so that no ships could travel up the river. Just before Bran&#x27;s troops landed they saw that the Irish had destroyed the bridge and blocked the river. At that moment Bran said “The man who would lead his people must first become a bridge” then he positioned himself across the flow so that his troops could march across. Matholwch&#x27;s men seeing the Welsh advance successfully, said they would atone for the injustice done to Branwen by ensuring the kingship of Bran&#x27;s nephew Gwern. That alone did not satisfy Bran, so they offered to build him a house that would accommodate his massive body. Bran only accepted after Branwen&#x27;s plea, for she feared bloodshed. The house the Irish built however was a clever trick as they hid one hundred soldiers inside bags throughout the home instructed to jump out at the feast and kill the nearest Welshman. They did not however factor in Efnysien, who arrived at the house to inspect it, obviously expecting foul play. He went around and crushed the skull of every man hidden inside a bag. Soon after the great feast took place and Gwern went around charming his new-found relatives from Wales. Efnysien complained the boy had not greeted him, and then suddenly grabbed the boy by his heels and cast him head first into the huge fire. Branwen in a craze tried to leap into the fire, Bran stopped her knowing she would die too. He then protected his sister from the fight that broke out escorting her outside the house. The Welsh had the advantage until the Irish brought out their secret weapon, the black cauldron that could reanimate the dead. Efnysien seeing the great trouble he brought his country men he decided upon one last act of valour.

He hid himself in the bodies of the fallen Irish. When the cauldron attendants came along and threw him in, he spread his body out in all directions, shattering the cauldron but sacrificing himself in the process. During the great fight Bran took a fatal blow to the foot, and as he lay in his deathbed he gave his men these last instructions: “Cut my head off and take it to London. Eventually you must bury it in the state on the White Hill of London (thought to be the location where the Tower of London now stands), turning my head towards France.” Ceremonially they cut off Bran&#x27;s head and left Ireland. When they returned to Wales and Branwen had time to contemplate all that had happened, she died there on the spot of a broken heart. The men buried her where she fell and continued on their quest for London.

== Other associations ==
According to the Welsh Triads, Brân&#x27;s head was buried in London where the White Tower now stands. As long as it remained there, Britain would be safe from invasion. However, King Arthur dug up the head, declaring the country would be protected only by his great strength. There have been attempts in modern times to link the still-current practice of keeping ravens at the Tower of London under the care of Yeomen Warder Ravenmaster with this story of Brân. The connection can still be seen in several Celtic languages, in Welsh brân means crow, and bran means raven in both Cornish and Irish.

Several scholars have noted similarities between Brân the Blessed and the Arthurian character the Fisher King, the keeper of the Holy Grail. The Fisher King first appears in Chrétien de Troyes&#x27;s 12th century French romance &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;; he has been dealt a mortal wound in the leg (Brân&#x27;s wound was in his foot) but stays alive in his mystical castle due to the effects of the Grail, waiting to be healed by Percival. A later author who took up the story, Robert de Boron, describes the history of the Grail in ancient times, and says the first Fisher King was a man called &quot;Bron&quot;. Additionally, the Welsh story &quot;Peredur son of Efrawg&quot;, a version of the Percival story with several striking deviations, features the hero visiting a mysterious castle, although he does not find the Grail there, but rather a severed human head. Additionally, some works attribute to the Grail the power to restore the fallen, making it somewhat similar to Brân&#x27;s cauldron. Others have identified Bendigeidfran with the Irish hero Bran mac Febal.

John T. Koch proposes a number of parallels between the mythological Bendigeidfran and the historical Celtic chieftain Brennus, who invaded the Balkans in the 3rd century BC. He goes on to suggest an association between Brân and Brancaster, a fort on the Norfolk coast, while Rachel Bromwich suggests that Castell Dinas Brân in Denbighshire is similarly related. Count Nikolai Tolstoy proposes that Brân&#x27;s original function was that of a psychopomp, guiding the souls of the dead to the Otherworld.

Brân is praised in the poetry of 12th century bard Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr, in which he is described as &quot;a good commander of the host; in battle, in hostile territory, in the contest, in stress&quot;, while, in his elegy for Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales, Bleddyn Fardd compares the overthrow of the prince to the deaths of Llywelyn Fawr, King Arthur and Brân. A poem found in the Black Book of Carmarthen refers to Bendigeidfran&#x27;s death in Ireland, claiming that Gwyn ap Nudd was present at the battle, either as a warrior or in his traditional role as a psychopomp.

The novel series &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot; by Lloyd Alexander, whose second installment is named The Black Cauldron, is based on Welsh mythology. The Disney film &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;, based loosely on the novel series, features a cauldron that can bring the dead back to life.

The novel series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; by George R. R. Martin includes several characters named Brandon (Bran) Stark. Many of them have epithets commonly associated with their names, such as Brandon the Builder, Brandon the Breaker, Brandon the Shipwright, Brandon the Burner, Brandon the Bad, and Brandon the Daughterless. The television series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; is based on the Martin novels. One of the Brandon Starks is associated with crows in the novels, and with ravens in the TV series.

==Name==
The Welsh mythological texts of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; were recorded between the 14th and 15th centuries in Middle Welsh. As a result, there are discrepancies regarding the spelling of names, because English translations maintain Middle Welsh orthography whereas Modern Welsh versions use Modern Welsh orthography. In Middle Welsh, there was some variation on the name Brân. In modern Welsh, the &quot;treiglad meddal&quot; (soft mutation) is Frân, but in Middle Welsh documents, this might be rendered as &quot;Vran&quot; or &quot;Uran&quot; (the latter arising because U and V represented the same letter in Latin).

In the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, the character is referred to virtually exclusively as &quot;Bendigeituran&quot;; that is, with the epithet &quot;Bendigeit&quot; (blessed or praiseworthy) attached (a terminal D is pronounced similarly to T in Welsh, and in early documents was also spelt with T). The only exceptions are in the patronymic of his son Caradog ap Brân and a single reference to his gathering in Ireland as &quot;Gwledd Brân&quot;, &quot;The feast of Brân (or &#x27;Crow&#x27;)&quot;. This usage is followed in the Welsh Triads. Bendigeituran becomes &quot;Bendigeidfrân&quot; or &quot;Brân Fendigeid&quot; in Modern Welsh; Bendigeidfran is the form used in many Modern Welsh adaptations of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. However, earlier references generally do not include the epithet, instead calling the character &quot;Brân fab Llŷr&quot; or simply &quot;Brân&quot;. Ifor Williams thought &quot;Bendigeit&quot; was a late addition, perhaps a replacement for a word that had become obsolete by the time the &quot;Mabinogi&quot; was recorded. &quot;Vran&quot; appears in an old poem in the Book of Taliesin, while Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr and Prydydd y Moch mention &quot;Brân fab Llŷr&quot; several times in their poetry, under different spellings. However, Bleddyn Fardd refers to &quot;Benigeitran&quot; in his elegy for Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, demonstrating that the epithet &quot;Bendigeit&quot; had been attached to Brân since the late 13th century.

In West Penwith, Cornwall, the name Bran is associated with Caer Bran a Cornish Round and the Men Scryfa which records a Brittonic RIALOBRANI CUNOVALI FILI (&#x27;royal raven&#x27; son of &#x27;Famous Leader&#x27;) suggesting a local leader carried the name of the famous hero, the son of a Cynfawl.

<text>The Breg is a river, 46 kilometres long, in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, and the primary headstream of the Danube.

== Description ==
The &quot; Breg &quot; is the longest and biggest headstream of the river Danube. It flows through the southeast part of the Middle Black Forest and the lowlands of the Baar region.

The Breg rises at a height of , six kilometres northwest of Furtwangen. Its source, which is near St. Martin&#x27;s Chapel and is also called the source of the Danube or &quot;Donauquelle&quot;, is protected as a natural monument. It is located about 100 metres south-east of the Rhine / Danube watershed (the great European Watershed). Beyond that, but only about 900 metres away is the source of the Elz, which flows in the same longitudinal valley but initially in the opposite direction, to the north, and later flows into the Rhine.
In its upper section, known as the &quot;Katzensteig&quot;, the Breg valley is clearly a result of glaciation, with a strikingly low gradient and landscape characterized by large Black Forest houses. Between the towns of Furtwangen and Vöhrenbach, the Breg flows eastwards through a broader and somewhat more densely populated valley, then in a generally southeasterly direction through a solitary forest valley, accompanied by a road and the route of the former Breg Valley Railway, which is now a bicycle track. Shortly before Hammereisenbach-Bregenbach, the Breg is joined by the Linach just below the Linach Dam and, in the village, by the Hammerbach, a short tributary, but the most important thanks to its two large headstreams. Near Bräunlingen, the Breg meets the Röthenbach stream at the Kirnbergsee. Here the Breg leaves the Black Forest and continues via Hüfingen to Donaueschingen, through wide, open countryside on the plateau of the Baar.

After 46.2 kilometres, the Breg merges with the Brigach in Donaueschingen to form the Danube - &quot;Brigach und Breg bringen die Donau zuweg&quot; (&quot;Brigach and Breg bring the Danube together&quot;) as the well known rhyme goes. Since the Breg is not only the longest, but also the most voluminous river of the Danube with a catchment area of 291.5 km², its source is considered hydrographically as the source of the Danube (&quot;Donauquelle&quot;).

<text>In Irish mythology, Bres (or Bress) was a king of the Tuatha Dé Danann. He is often referred to by the name Eochaid / Eochu Bres. He was an unpopular king, and favoured his Fomorian kin.

==Name==
&quot;Eochu Bres&quot; has been translated as &quot;beautiful horseman.&quot; The scribes who wrote down the text of the Cath Maige Tuired record &quot;Bres&quot; as meaning &#x27;beautiful&#x27;, however, this may be a false etymology. The original meaning of &quot;Bres&quot; may have derived from a root meaning &quot;fight,&quot; &quot;blow,&quot; &quot;effort,&quot; &quot;uproar,&quot; or &quot;din.&quot;

==Description==
In the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; and &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot;, Bres is portrayed as beautiful to behold, yet harsh and inhospitable. However, the poem &quot;Carn Hui Neit&quot; from the &quot;dindsenchas&quot; praises Bres&#x27; &quot;kindly&quot; and &quot;noble&quot; character and calls him the &quot;flower&quot; of the Tuatha Dé Danann. There, the following flattering descriptions are provided for Bres:
* gifted with excellences
* master of love-spells
* kindly friend
* noble and fortunate
* ornament of the host
* with a visage never woeful
* flower of the Tuatha De
* hot of valour
* spear-attended king

==Family==
In &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot; Bres&#x27; parents were Prince Elatha of the Fomorians and Eri of the Tuatha Dé Danann. Alternately in &quot;The Fate of the Children of Turenn&quot;, Bres&#x27; father is Balor of the Evil Eye. He grew so quickly that by the age of seven he was the size of a 14-year-old. His wife was Brigid, daughter of the Dagda, and his son was Ruadan, who was killed by Goibniu.

==Irish Mythology==
In the First Battle of Magh Tuiredh, King Nuada of the Tuatha Dé Danann lost his hand; because he was imperfect, he could not be king. Hoping to reconcile relations between the Fomorians and the Tuatha Dé Danann, Bres was named king and Brigid of the Tuatha de Danann married him, giving him a son, Ruadan, who would later be killed trying to assassinate Goibniu.

Bres made the Tuatha Dé Danann pay tribute to the Fomorians and work as slaves: Ogma was forced to carry firewood, and the Dagda had to dig trenches around forts. He neglected his duties of hospitality: the Tuatha Dé complained that after visiting his house their knives were never greased and their breaths did not smell of ale. Cairbre, poet of the Tuatha Dé, composed a scathing poem against him, which was the first satire in Ireland, and everything went wrong for Bres after that.

After Bres had ruled for seven years, Nuada had his hand, which had formerly been replaced with a silver one by Dian Cecht and Creidhne, replaced with one of flesh and blood by Dian Cecht&#x27;s son Miach, with the help of his sister Airmed; following the successful replacement, Nuada was restored to kingship and Bres was exiled. He went to his father for help to recover his throne, but Elatha would not help him gain by foul means what he had been unable to keep: &quot;You have no right to get it by injustice when you could not keep it by justice&quot;. Bres was guided by his father to Balor, another leader of the Fomorians, for the help he sought.

He led the Fomorians in the Second Battle of Magh Tuireadh but lost. He was found unprotected on the battlefield by Lugh and pleaded for his life. Lugh spared him because he promised to teach the Tuatha Dé agriculture.

In a contradictory account from the dindsenchas Bres&#x27; death is described at the hands of Lugh. Lugh made 300 wooden cows, and filled them with a bitter, poisonous red liquid which was then &quot;milked&quot; into pails and offered to Bres to drink. Bres, who was under an obligation not to refuse hospitality, drank it down without flinching, and it killed him. The &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; mentions this incident briefly, however the deadly liquid is identified as sewage.

<text>In Irish mythology, Elatha, Elotha, Elier or Elada (modern spelling: Ealadha) was a king of the Fomorians and the father of Bres by Ériu of the Tuatha Dé Danann, as well as Delbaeth, Ogma, Elloth (another name for Lir the father of Manannán mac Lir), and the Dagda by an unnamed mother. The imagery surrounding him suggests he may be associated with sources of light and illumination, such as the sun.
==Overview==

Elatha is described as being the &quot;beautiful Miltonic prince of darkness with golden hair&quot;. He was the son of Delbaeth and a king of the Fomor, and he was the father of Bres by Eriu, a woman of the Tuatha Dé Danann. He came to her over the sea in a vessel of silver, himself having the appearance of a young man with yellow hair, wearing clothes of gold and five gold torcs. He was one of the Fomor who took part in the Second Battle of Magh Tuireadh.

During the Second Battle of Magh Tuireadh, Elatha watched over his son the Dagda&#x27;s magic harp, Uaithne, sometimes called Dur-da-Bla, &quot;the Oak of Two Blossoms,&quot; and sometimes Coir-cethar-chuin, &quot;the Four-Angled Music.&quot; He is said to have a sense of humor and a sense of nobility.

Though considered to be the Fomorian father of Eochu Bres, Elatha (Elada) was also the father of the Dagda, Ogma, a son named Delbaeth, and Elloth, elsewhere known as Lir (the father of Manannan mac Lir) according to the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn.&quot; The mother of these Tuatha Dé Danann chiefs may have been Ethne, the mother of Lug, based on Ogma&#x27; often cited matronymic &quot;mac Ethliu.&quot; Since Ethne was Fomorian, this means they are all Fomorians. This is rather confusing, but may portray the battle between the two groups as actually being about the new generation of gods displacing the older generation.

==Elatha and Bres==

&quot;She told him that his father was Elatha, one of the Kings of the Fomorians; that he had come to her one time over a level sea in a great vessel that seemed to be of silver; that he himself had the appearance of a young man with yellow hair, his clothes decked with gold and five rings of gold around his neck. She had refused the love of all the young men of her own people, had given him her love and cried when he had left her.&quot;

Before he left he had given her a ring from his own hand and had bade her give it only to the man whose finger it would fit. Eri brought out the ring and put it on the finger of Bres and it fit him well. She and Bres and some of their followers then set out of the land of the Fomorians. At long last they came to that faraway land. Elatha the local King saw the ring on Bres’ hand and asked him the whole story and said that Bres was his own son. Elatha then asked Bres what it was that drove him out of his own country and his own kingship. Bres answered truthfully: “Nothing drove me out but my own injustice and my own hardness; I took away their treasures from the people and their jewels and their food itself. And there were never taxes put on them before I was their King. And still I am come to look for fighting men that I may take Ireland by force”. Elatha listened and then bade him go to the chief King of the Fomorians, Balar of the Evil Eye.&quot;&quot;

==Names==
These are the names that Elatha has gone by and where that name stems from.

* Elatha - T. W. Rolleston: &quot;Myths and Legends of Celtic Race&quot;
* Elathan - Charles Squire: &quot;Mythology of the Celtic People&quot;
* Elathan - Lady Gregory: &quot;Gods and Fighting Men&quot;

&quot;Elathan&quot; is used incorrectly by Squire and Lady Gregory, as &quot;Elathan&quot; is the genitive case of Elatha and means &#x27;of Elatha&#x27;.

According to Lady Gregory the etymology of &quot;Elatha&quot; is &quot;art&quot; or &quot;knowledge&quot; in the bardic sense. The name Elathan could also mean &quot;(he) of the art&quot; the n is justified in this case. This could explain why Ogma (inventor of the ogham script) is son of Elatha(n) (bardic knowledge). Elatha is called &quot;glory of weapons&quot; and &quot;a wolf of division against men of plunder&quot; in the Lebor Gabála Érenn.

<doc id="86172" wikidata="Q1294939" url="?curid=86172" title="Edwin Rosario">
<text>Edwin &quot;Chapo&quot; Rosario Rivera (; March 15, 1963 – December 1, 1997) was a Puerto Rican professional boxer who competed from 1979 to 1997. He was a world champion in two weight classes, having held the WBC lightweight title from 1983 to 1984, the WBA lightweight title twice between 1986 and 1990, and the WBA super lightweight title from 1991 to 1992.

Rosario was posthumously inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Early life and career==
Edwin Rosario was born in Candelaria barrio, Toa Baja, an extremely poor barrio on the north coast of Puerto Rico. Rosario&#x27;s older brother Papo became a professional boxer, beginning what looked like a promising career. Edwin and Papo were the sons of Antonio Rosario and Elizabeth Rivera. They also had three sisters.

His boxing manager and coach (trainer), Manny Siaca Sr., had noticed the younger Edwin Rosario&#x27;s talent when the boy was 8 years old. Inspired by his brother Papo, &quot;Chapo&quot; Rosario, as he became known in the world of boxing, had a stellar amateur boxing career.

==Professional boxing career==
Chapo&#x27;s brother Papo died unexpectedly, purportedly due to drugs, two years after his entry into professional boxing. Rosario persevered, wanting to honor his brother&#x27;s memory by winning a world championship. He scored big knockout wins over Young Ezzard Charles and Edwin Viruet. He beat Charles in three rounds on the Benitez-Duran undercard in January 1982 in Las Vegas. He also defeated Viruet in three rounds; that opponent had boxed 25 rounds against Roberto Durán-including a world lightweight championship bout-without being knocked out.

Rosario eventually gained a record of 21–0 with 20 knockouts. This led to talks of a title fight against World Boxing Council (WBC) lightweight champion Alexis Argüello, to be held in Miami. But Argüello relinquished the title in order to move up in weight to challenge junior welterweight champion Aaron Pryor.

===Boxing champion===
With Arguello moving divisions, Rosario was matched with Mexico&#x27;s José Luis Ramírez on May 1, 1983 for the vacant WBC lightweight title. Rosario seemed to have the momentum over the first half of the fight, but tired down the stretch to make for a very close outcome. The judges, as well as most of the public present, felt Rosario had done enough to win. He became world lightweight champion by the unanimous score of 115–113 on all 3 judging cards. Rosario injured his hand during the fight and needed surgery, for which the World Boxing Council gave him a dispensation.

He didn&#x27;t return to the ring until 1984. In his first defense of the title, he faced Roberto Elizondo, who had lasted 7 rounds with Argüello in a previous world title challenge and was expected to give him a tough fight. Rosario knocked out Elizondo in one round. Howard Davis Jr proved more of a challenge – Davis Jr was ahead on all scorecards with ten seconds remaining in the bout, but was dropped by Rosario for the second time in their fight at that point, and lost a split decision.

A rematch with Ramírez was scheduled, again in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on November 3, 1984. Rosario dropped Ramírez once in round one and again in the second, but the challenger got off the canvas to take Rosario&#x27;s title away with a fourth-round TKO. This was Rosario&#x27;s first defeat. Some fans felt he never fully recovered, although he won three more championships.

Rosario won a comeback fight against Frankie Randall, the future world champion, in London. He had to wait another year before an opportunity to regain the title. On June 13, 1986, he met the world champion Hector &#x27;Macho&#x27; Camacho at Madison Square Garden in New York. The fight was televised by HBO, and although Rosario shook Camacho badly in the fifth round and rallied down the stretch, Camacho swept the middle rounds. The judges, in a split decision, awarded Camacho the fight.

Because of the closeness of that bout, the WBA gave Rosario a chance to challenge Livingstone Bramble, one of two other world lightweight champions (the other one being the International Boxing Federation&#x27;s Jimmy Paul). Rosario went to Miami and defeated Bramble by knockout in the second round to become world lightweight champion for the second time. His pose, raising his arms after the fight, became &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s cover for the next month — the only time Rosario was featured on its English-version cover.

Rosario defended the WBA lightweight title against fellow Puerto Rican Juan Nazario with a knockout in eight in Chicago.

In Rosario&#x27;s next defense, he faced WBC super featherweight title holder Julio César Chávez, on November 21, 1987, in Las Vegas. Chavez moved up in weight to challenge for Rosario&#x27;s title, and he battered the lightweight champion. By the tenth round, Rosario&#x27;s left eye was completely shut. His right eye was swollen, and he was bleeding from the nose and mouth. Referee Richard Steele stopped the fight at 2:38 of the eleventh round at the request of Rosario&#x27;s corner. At the time of the stoppage, Rosario trailed on the judges&#x27; scorecards by the following scores: Jerry Roth: 98-92. Bob Watson: 99-91. Albert Tramari 100-92 (2 rounds even).

Rosario was inactive for seven months then went 7–0 with 6 KO&#x27;s in his next fights. After Chavez vacated the title in 1989, Rosario came back and won it again, beating Anthony Jones, a tough Kronk prospect for the championship.

Rosario joined a small group of men who had become world champions three times in the same division. This time, however, he didn&#x27;t hold the title for long. When he gave Nazario a 1990 rematch at Madison Square Garden, he was defeated on cuts in the 8th round.

Rosario moved up a weight class to the junior welterweight division, and defeated defending world champion Loreto Garza in three rounds in Sacramento&#x27;s Arco Arena to become a world champion for the 4th time.

However, personal problems started to take their toll. In his first defense, against Japanese Akinobu Hiranaka in Mexico City on April 10, 1992, he lost by a 1st-round TKO. He later lost a rematch to Frankie Randall, by technical knockout in seven rounds.

==Later career and death==
Rosario disappeared from the boxing scene. Years later he received media attention after being arrested for stealing beer from a supermarket. He vowed to stay clean and went into a program to achieve this.

In 1997, he won two comeback fights, then won the Caribbean welterweight title by beating Roger Benito Flores of Nicaragua in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, in a twelve-round decision. Once an HBO staple, Rosario was then fighting on small cards without any TV showings. He was ranked #10 among Oscar De La Hoya&#x27;s challengers at the welterweight division after his win over Flores, making him an official world title challenger once again.

He defeated Sanford Ricks at Madison Square Garden. In his final fight on September 25, 1997, Rosario knocked out Harold Bennett in two rounds at Bayamon. He died before fighting again.

On December 1, 1997, Rosario visited the home of his ex-wife and four daughters, but he cut his visit short an hour later, saying he felt ill. After returning home where he lived with his parents, Rosario was later found dead in his bed by his father. He was found to have died of an aneurysm on December 1, 1997, with fluid accumulated in the lungs. Doctors said that his history of narcotics and alcohol abuse was a factor.

Many celebrities and dignitaries attended his funeral, and a group of Puerto Rican world boxing champions were among the pallbearers. More than 5,000 people came to the funeral or watched from their homes as the coffin was driven from the funeral home to the cemetery.

<text>Mullah Muhammad Omar (; 196023 April 2013) was an Afghan militant leader and cleric who founded the Taliban in 1994. During the Third Afghan Civil War, the Taliban fought the Northern Alliance and took control of most of the country, establishing the First Islamic Emirate for which Omar began to serve as Supreme Leader in 1996. Shortly after al-Qaeda carried out the September 11 attacks, the Taliban government was toppled by an American invasion of Afghanistan, prompting Omar to go into hiding. He successfully evaded capture by the American-led coalition before dying in 2013 from tuberculosis.

Born into a religious family in Kandahar, Omar was educated at local &quot;madrasas&quot; in Afghanistan. After Afghanistan was invaded by the Soviet Union in 1979, he joined the Afghan &quot;mujahideen&quot; to fight in the Soviet–Afghan War and he was trained by Brigadier Sultan Amir Tarar (also known as Imam Tarar). He served as an important military commander during several skirmishes, losing his right eye in an explosion. The Soviets eventually withdrew from the country in 1989 and Afghanistan&#x27;s Soviet-backed Democratic Republic was toppled in 1992, triggering the Afghan Civil War of 1992–1996. While initially remaining quiet and focused on continuing his studies, Omar became increasingly discontent with what he perceived as &quot;fasād&quot; in the country&quot;,&quot; ultimately prompting him to return to fighting in the Civil War. In 1994, Omar, along with religious students in Kandahar, formed the Taliban, which emerged victorious against other Afghan factions by 1996. Omar led the Taliban to form a Sunni Islamic theocracy headed by the Supreme Council, known as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, which strictly enforced &quot;sharia&quot;. While ruling between 1996 and 2001, the Taliban were widely condemned for committing massacres against civilians; discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities; banning women from school and most employment; and the destruction of cultural monuments, including the Buddhas of Bamiyan, which Omar personally ordered.

After al-Qaeda, which had been given sanctuary in Afghanistan by the Taliban, carried out the September 11 attacks against the United States in 2001, American president George W. Bush demanded that the Taliban extradite al-Qaeda&#x27;s leader Osama bin Laden to the United States. The Taliban, under the leadership of Mullah Omar, refused to extradite him to the U.S. without concrete evidence linking him to the attacks, and they requested proof of his involvement in 9/11, the United States, however had enough proof of him being in Afghanistan and under the Taliban&#x27;s protection, subsequently began the Global War on Terrorism and led a multinational invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, greatly bolstered by the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. By December 2001, the Taliban government had been ousted by the American-led coalition; Omar fled Kandahar, went into hiding in Zabul Province, and delegated operational control of the Taliban to his deputies. Under his command, the Taliban launched an insurgency against the new Afghan government and the coalition. Although Omar was the subject of a decade-long international manhunt, he remained in hiding for the rest of his life. He died in 2013, reportedly due to tuberculosis, which was not revealed publicly until 2015. In 2021, the Taliban deposed the Afghan government and regained power following the Fall of Kabul. 

Omar remains a largely popular figure amongst the Taliban, who view him as a key freedom fighter who defended Afghanistan&#x27;s Islamic principles — first against the Soviet empire and later against the Western world. Others have criticized him for his method of governance and his religious views.

== Early life ==
Muhammed Omar was born in 1960 into a poor and large Pashtun family in the village of &quot;Chah-i-Himmat&quot; in Khakrez of Kandahar, Kingdom of Afghanistan. He came from a line of Islamic scholars and teachers. At tall, he was the tallest boy in his family.

His father was Mawlawi Ghulam Nabi, his grandfather Mawlawi Muhammad Rasool, and his great-grandfather Mawlawi Baz Muhammad. They were of the Tomzi clan of the Hotak tribe, which is part of the larger Ghilzai tribal confederation of the Pashtuns. His father, born in Khakrez District, was a poor, landless itinerant teacher who taught the Quran to village boys and received alms from their families. He died when Omar was three years old, according to Omar&#x27;s own words, or five years old, according to the Taliban biography. Thereafter Omar was raised by his uncles. One of his father&#x27;s brothers, Maulawi Muzafer, married Omar&#x27;s widowed mother, as was often done in rural Afghanistan. 

The family moved to the village of Dehwanawark, several miles from the town of Deh Rawood, in the poor Deh Rawood District in Uruzgan Province, where the uncle was a religious teacher. According to former Afghan President Hamid Karzai, &quot;Omar&#x27;s father was a local religious leader, but the family was poor and had absolutely no political links in Kandahar or Kabul. They were essentially lower middle class Afghans and were definitely not members of the elite.&quot;

Omar studied at a religious school or madrasa run by his uncle. According to Gopal and Strick van Linschoten, all of his religious education was in Afghan hujras, which are small religious schools annexed to village mosques. He completed his primary and secondary religious education, then began higher religious studies at 18. His studies were interrupted before he completed them and he did not properly earn the title &quot;Mullah&quot;. Later in life he was given an honorary degree by the Jamia Uloom-ul-Islamia seminary in Karachi, Pakistan, but he never studied there, contrary to some reports. He was also given an honorary doctorate by Darul Uloom Haqqania in northwestern Pakistan, where numerous other senior Taliban leaders studied. Some sources have claimed that he studied there, but its leader Sami-ul-Haq said that he did not know of Omar until 1994.

Much of Omar&#x27;s early and personal life remains either secret or is the subject of conflicting reports. In April 2015, during the time when his death was being kept secret, the Taliban published a biography of Omar to mark his &quot;19th year as their supreme leader,&quot; when in fact he had already died on 23 April 2013.

== Soviet–Afghan War (1979–1989) ==
After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, Omar joined the mujahideen in Deh Rawood to fight the Soviets. In 1983 he moved with mujahideen friends to Maywand District in Kandahar Province and fought under Faizullah Akhundzada, the commander of a group affiliated with Harakat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami (Islamic and National Revolution Movement). Abdul Ghani Baradar was another from Deh Rawood who was in the group. Omar fought in the Maiwand, Zhari, Panjwai and Dand districts and was an expert in using rocket-propelled grenades against tanks. In the last years of the war, some mujahideen groups split up, and Omar and his friends left Faizullah Akhundzada&#x27;s group. They formed a new group under Omar&#x27;s leadership, based at Aday, in the Singesar area, then in the Panjwayi District and now in Zhari District, and became registered with Harakat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami as an affiliated group. Omar was wounded four times. Abdul Salam Zaeef has said he was present when exploding shrapnel destroyed Omar&#x27;s right eye at Singesar during the 1987 Battle of Arghandab. Other sources place this event in 1986 or in the 1989 Battle of Jalalabad. Omar went to a hospital in Quetta, Pakistan, for treatment to his eye wound. According to former Taliban official Abdul Hai Mutmaen (or Mutma&#x27;in), this was the only time that Omar ever went to Pakistan, and that he returned after treatment. According to Dutch journalist Bette Dam, in research published in 2019, he went to Pakistan on one other occasion during the war, to fetch weapons following a dispute within his mujahideen group. Mutmaen denies that Omar went there for weapons, but acknowledges that a few members of Omar&#x27;s family claim he visited Pakistan four times during the war – once for the injury, then to register his group, and two visits to injured friends.

=== Soviet withdrawal and fight against the Democratic Republic ===
The Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989. According to Ahmed Rashid, Omar joined the mujahideen group Hezb-i Islami Khalis and fought under the command of Nek Mohammed against Mohammad Najibullah&#x27;s communist regime between 1989 and 1992.

After Najibullah&#x27;s government collapsed in 1992, Omar and a group of mujahideen turned their base near Haji Ibrahim Mosque in Gheshano village, in the Singesar area, into a madrassa. As well as teaching there, Omar resumed his own studies that had been interrupted by the war. Unlike many Afghan mujaheddin, Omar spoke Arabic. He was devoted to the lectures of Sheikh Abdullah Azzam.

== Forming the Taliban (1994) ==

After Najibullah&#x27;s regime ended, the country fell into chaos as various mujahideen factions fought for control. According to one legend, Omar had a dream in 1994 in which a woman told him: &quot;We need your help; you must rise. You must end the chaos. God will help you.&quot; Omar started his movement with less than 50 armed madrassah students who were simply known as the Taliban (Pashtun for &#x27;students&#x27;). His recruits came from madrassas located in Afghanistan and the Afghan refugee camps which were located across the border in Pakistan. They fought against the rampant corruption which had emerged during the civil war period and were initially welcomed by Afghans who were weary of warlord rule. Omar became sickened by the abusive raping of children by warlords (&quot;Bacha bazi&quot;) and turned against their authority in the mountainous country of Afghanistan from 1994 onwards.

Two influential anti-Soviet political leaders who were connected with Peshawar during this era were Mohammad Yunus Khalis and Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi; both exerted a considerable influence over the Taliban, particularly in the southern parts of the country, including Kandahar. Many of those who later formed the core of the Taliban, including Omar, fought under the command of factions that were loyal to Nabi Mohammadi. These factions had helped spread &quot;madrasa&quot;, attended by many of the Kandahar Taliban, throughout the southern regions of Afghanistan.

The practice of &quot;bacha bazi&quot; by warlords was one of the key factors in Omar mobilizing the Taliban. In early 1994, Omar led 30 men armed with 16 rifles to free two young girls who had been kidnapped and raped by a warlord, hanging him from a tank gun barrel. Another instance arose when in 1994, a few months before the Taliban took control of Kandahar, two militia commanders confronted each other over a young boy whom they both wanted to sodomize. In the ensuing fight, Omar&#x27;s group freed the boy; appeals soon flooded in for Omar to intercede in other disputes. His movement gained momentum through the year and he quickly gathered recruits from Islamic schools totaling 12,000 by the year&#x27;s end with some Pakistani volunteers. By November 1994, Omar&#x27;s movement managed to capture the whole of the Kandahar Province and then captured the Herat Province in September 1995. Some accounts estimated that by the spring of 1995 he had already taken 12 of the 31 provinces in Afghanistan.

== Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (1996–2001) ==
=== Leadership ===
On 4 April 1996, supporters of Omar bestowed the title &quot;Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin&quot; (أمير المؤمنين, ) on him, after he donned a cloak which was alleged to be that of Muhammad, locked in a series of chests and held inside the Shrine of the Cloak in the city of Kandahar. Legend decreed that whoever could retrieve the cloak from the chest would be the great Leader of the Muslims, or the &quot;&quot;Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin&quot;.

In September 1996, Kabul fell to Omar and his followers. The civil war continued in the northeast corner of the country, near Tajikistan. In October 1997 the nation was named the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and recognized by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Described as a &quot;reclusive, pious and frugal&quot; leader, Omar rarely left his residence in the city of Kandahar, and he only visited Kabul twice between 1996 and 2001 during his tenure as ruler of Afghanistan. In November 2001, during a radio interview with the BBC, Omar stated: &quot;All Taliban are moderate. There are two things: extremism [&#x27;ifraat&#x27;, or doing something to excess] and conservatism [&#x27;tafreet&#x27;, or doing something insufficiently]. So in that sense, we are all moderates – taking the middle path.&quot; During his tenure as Afghanistan&#x27;s ruler, Omar seldom left the city of Kandahar, where he lived in a large house reportedly built for him by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi militant who was the founder of al-Qaeda.

Omar had a complicated relationship with Osama bin Laden. According to Pakistani journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai, Omar stated in the late 1990s, &quot;We have told Osama [Bin Laden] not to use Afghan soil to carry out political activities as it creates unnecessary confusion about Taliban objectives.&quot; Bin Laden was a challenge for Omar: he was widely seen as a defender of the faith, had deep pockets, and if he were to censure the Taliban, the movement would likely end. However, Omar did not want bin Laden spreading a message of jihad. Omar summoned bin Laden to meet him in 1996 after bin Laden&#x27;s declaration of jihad against the United States the same year. He asked bin Laden to stop talking about the jihad, but as a matter of Pashtun tribal custom did not outright forbid him, as it would be deeply insulting to a guest. Bin Laden chose to ignore Omar. The high stature of bin Laden and his importance in keeping the Taliban in power were further evidenced by Omar visiting bin Laden as a guest, a sign of deference and respect. After the 1998 United States embassy bombings, the US launched cruise missiles against al-Qaeda training camps and sought bin Laden. This inadvertently created more sympathy for bin Laden in Afghanistan. Omar did not hand bin Laden over, citing Pashtunwali tribal customs that require a host to protect guests, and that bin Laden was a guest of Afghanistan. Privately, Omar felt that if he bowed to the US by turning over bin Laden, the US would try to further influence Afghanistan and attempt to meddle in its religious matters. He may have also feared retaliation or withdrawal of support from the Saudi or Pakistani governments should he turn over bin Laden. In 2000, Omar ordered bin Laden to not attack the United States, after advisors warned him that bin Laden might be planning to do so. Omar suggested to the US that bin Laden be turned over to an international Islamic court, or simply exiled, but the US turned both suggestions down.

Omar was also &quot;Head of the Supreme Council of Afghanistan&quot;. The Supreme Council was initially established at Kandahar in 1994.

According to a 2001 United Nations report, the Taliban committed systematic massacres against civilians between 1996 and 2001 while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan. The report said that such mass killings were ordered or approved by Omar himself and that bin Laden&#x27;s 055 Brigade, made up of Arab fighters, was involved in these massacres.

=== Demolition of the Buddhas of Bamiyan ===
In July 1999, Mohammed Omar issued a decree in favor of the preservation of the Bamiyan Buddha statues. Because Afghanistan&#x27;s Buddhist population no longer exists, so the statues are no longer worshiped, he added: &quot;The government considers the Bamiyan statues as an example of a potential major source of income for Afghanistan from international visitors. The Taliban states that Bamiyan shall not be destroyed but protected.&quot;

In early 2000, local Taliban authorities asked for UN assistance to rebuild drainage ditches around tops of the alcoves where the Buddhas were set.

In March 2001, the Bamiyan Buddha statues were destroyed by the Taliban under an edict issued from Omar, stating: &quot;all the statues around Afghanistan must be destroyed.&quot; This prompted an international outcry. Information and Culture Minister Qadratullah Jamal told Associated Press of a decision by 400 religious clerics from across Afghanistan declaring the Buddhist statues against the tenets of Islam. &quot;They came out with a consensus that the statues were against Islam,&quot; said Jamal. A statement issued by the Ministry of Religious Affairs of the Taliban regime justified the destruction as being in accordance with Islamic law. The then Taliban ambassador to Pakistan Abdul Salam Zaeef held that the destruction of the Buddhas was finally ordered by Abdul Wali, the Minister for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice.

Omar explained why he ordered the statues to be destroyed in an interview:

=== Opium production ===

Between 1996 and 1999, the Taliban controlled 96% of Afghanistan&#x27;s poppy fields and made opium its largest source of taxation. Taxes on opium exports was the primary source of income for the Taliban during its rule and subsequent insurgency after 2001. In July 2000, Taliban leader Mohammed Omar, in an effort to eradicate heroin production in Afghanistan, declared that growing poppies was un-Islamic, resulting in one of the world&#x27;s most successful anti-drug campaigns. The Taliban enforced a ban on poppy farming via threats, forced eradication, and public punishment of transgressors. The result was a 99% reduction in the area of opium poppy farming in Taliban-controlled areas, roughly three-quarters of the world&#x27;s supply of heroin at the time. The ban was effective only briefly due to the deposition of the Taliban in 2001.

=== September 11 attacks by al-Qaeda ===

Following the September 11 attacks on the United States carried out by al-Qaeda, the United States under the Bush administration issued an ultimatum to Afghanistan to hand over Osama bin Laden and other high ranking al-Qaeda officials and shut down all al-Qaeda training camps within the country. In an interview with Voice of America, Omar was asked if he would give up Osama bin Laden. Omar replied, &quot;No. We cannot do that. If we did, it means we are not Muslims, that Islam is finished. If we were afraid of attack, we could have surrendered him the last time we were threatened.&quot; Omar explained his position to high-ranking Taliban officials:

Omar was adamant that bin Laden was innocent of planning the 9/11 attacks despite the accusations directed against him. Nonetheless, high-ranking Taliban officials attempted to persuade Omar to hand bin Laden over and made offers to the United States through its contacts with Pakistan. The Taliban ambassador to Pakistan Abdul Salam Zaeef said at a news conference in Islamabad that &quot;our position in this regard is that if the Americans have evidence, they should produce it.&quot; If they could prove their allegations, he said, &quot;we are ready for a trial of Osama bin Laden.&quot; The Taliban foreign minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil also attempted to negotiate, offering the Americans the proposal of setting up a three-nation court under the supervision of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference as it was a &quot;neutral organization&quot; or having bin Laden tried by an Islamic council in Afghanistan. Muttawakil said &quot;the US showed no interest in it.&quot; The Taliban Prime Minister Abdul Kabir stated that if evidence was provided, &quot;we would be ready to hand him over to a third country&quot;. Part of the reluctance to hand bin Laden over stemmed from Omar&#x27;s own miscalculations. Omar thought there was &quot;less than a 10 percent&quot; chance that the US would do anything beyond make threats.

The Supreme Council of the Islamic Clergy, a council of around 1,000 clerics, convened in Kabul in late September 2001 and issued a decree against the United States and its threats of militarily invading Afghanistan. They also recommended that Osama bin Laden be asked to leave Afghanistan of his own free will to &quot;avoid the current tumult&quot; and expressed sympathy and a conciliatory tone towards those who died in the 11 September attacks: &quot;The ulema voice their sadness over American deaths and hope America does not attack Afghanistan.&quot; The Taliban Education Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said that Omar had agreed to follow guidance offered by the clerics and would try to encourage bin Laden to leave Afghanistan without forcibly handing him over to the United States for prosecution, even if bin Laden refused to leave the country.

However, according to an interview with Pakistani journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai, Omar told him:

=== U.S. invasion of Afghanistan ===

On the night of 7–8 October 2001, shortly after the US-led United States invasion of Afghanistan began, Omar&#x27;s house in Kandahar was bombed just after he had left, fatally injuring his 10-year-old son. His stepfather, who was also his uncle, was initially reported killed, but later reports said he was injured and treated at a hospital.

In another account of an attack that night, an MQ-1 Predator drone followed a three-vehicle convoy that left Omar&#x27;s compound and drove to a compound to the southwest of Kandahar, with US commanders believing Omar was in one of the vehicles. Men disembarked from the vehicles and entered a large building in the compound. US military officers considered bombing the building, but were concerned that another building in the compound might be a mosque, which they wished to avoid hitting. Eventually it was decided to fire a Hellfire missile from the Predator at one of the vehicles, where armed guards kept gathering, in the hope that it would draw out anyone inside the possible mosque. The the first missile launched by a drone in appeared to cause two casualties. Dozens of men, some armed, emerged from the large building and other buildings in the compound, and some got into vehicles and departed.

According to fellow Taliban fighters, Omar had secretly fled his residence in Kandahar for security purposes shortly after it was bombed and was last seen riding on the back of a motorcycle driven by his brother-in-law and right-hand man, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. Senior and former Taliban officials have said that there had not been any confirmed sightings of their &quot;Amir-ul-Momineen&quot; (commander of the faithful) in Afghanistan since then.

In November 2001, he was heard over a short-wave radio ordering all Taliban troops to abandon Kabul and take to the mountains, noting, &quot;defending the cities with front lines that can be targeted from the air will cause us terrible loss&quot;. In a November 2001 BBC Pashto interview, Omar said, &quot;You (the BBC) and American puppet radios have created concern. But the current situation in Afghanistan is related to a bigger cause – that is the destruction of America. ... This is not a matter of weapons. We are hopeful for God&#x27;s help. The real matter is the extinction of America. And, God willing, it [America] will fall to the ground.&quot; Claiming that the Americans had circulated &quot;propaganda&quot; that Omar had gone into hiding, Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil stated that he would like to &quot;propose that Prime Minister Blair and President Bush take Kalashnikovs and come to a specified place where Omar will also appear to see who will run and who not&quot;. He stated that Omar was merely changing locations due to security reasons.

During the Battle for Kandahar in late November 2001, US Special Operations teams known as Texas 12 and Texas 17 aligned with Hamid Karzai and with General Gul Agha Sherzai, respectively, surrounded Kandahar backed by US Marines outside Lashkar Gah. On 28 November 2001, while under attack by a Russian-made BM-21 multiple rocket launcher, Texas 17 observed Omar&#x27;s black American-made Chevrolet Suburban passing Kandahar Airport and travelling down highway four surrounded by a dozen sedans and six semi-trucks. Four US Navy F-18&#x27;s from USS Kitty Hawk destroyed all the vehicles including the Suburban. The same day, 28 November 2001, the Taliban reported that Omar had supposedly survived an American air strike.

== After the U.S. invasion (2001–2013) ==
=== Seclusion ===
On 5 December 2001, Omar held a meeting in Kandahar of top Taliban leaders and asked them what they wanted to do. Many were ready to stop fighting and willing to surrender. Omar handed over the Taliban leadership to his defence minister, Mullah Obaidullah, in writing. Two days later Omar left Kandahar and went into hiding in Zabul province in Afghanistan. In the following years, there was speculation about his location – with some believing that he went to Pakistan along with other Taliban leaders – and his circumstances and purported communications. But according to Bette Dam, in research published in 2019, and Borhan Osman, a senior analyst at International Crisis Group (ICG), Omar spent the rest of his life living in Zabul province. Dam said that her research relied on interviews with current and former members of the Afghan government, the Afghan intelligence agency National Directorate of Security, the Taliban, and Omar&#x27;s bodyguard Jabbar Omari. She said that her findings, confirmed by Afghan officials as well as the Talibans, depicted the US intelligence failure and cast even further doubt on US claims in the Afghan war.

Omar was protected in hiding by Jabbar Omari, a former Taliban governor of Baghlan province, who was from Zabul province and belonged to the Hotak tribe, as Omar did. They spent four years living in the provincial capital Qalat at a private home owned by Abdul Samad Ustaz, Omari&#x27;s former driver. Omar&#x27;s wives moved to Pakistan and Omar declined when Omari offered to bring his son to visit. He had very little active involvement in the Taliban from the end of 2001. He sent a cassette tape to the rest of the Taliban leadership in Quetta in 2003, reaffirming that Obaidullah was the supreme leader and naming who should be on the leadership shura (council). The shura sent a messenger every three to seven months, when they wanted his advice on some matter. He sent at least one other cassette tape, in 2007, but stopped that practice after the messenger was briefly detained in Pakistan, and thereafter messages were just relayed person-to-person. Omar kept in touch with events in the world by listening to BBC Pashto radio. Bette Dam wrote, &quot;Though Mullah Omar did not venture outside for fear of being caught, according to Jabbar Omari, in the four years they hid in that home, they felt relatively safe.&quot; The house was searched by the US military once, but they did not enter the concealed room where Omar was hiding.

After the US established Forward Operating Base Lagman a few hundred metres from the house in 2004, Omar relocated to a shack in a remote hamlet on the edge of a river, about 20 miles southeast of Qalat in Shinkay District, close to the Durand Line. His hideout was connected to underground irrigation channels that ran up into the hills. Soon after moving there, the US started building Forward Operating Base (FOB) Wolverine an hour&#x27;s walk or about three miles away, but Omar stayed put. The FOB eventually housed about 1,000 United States troops, and sometimes other NATO troops. To avoid detection, he would occasionally hide in the underground irrigation tunnels connected to his hideout, as US planes flew over or if US or Afghan troops came to search the area. People in the village knew that Taliban personnel were living there and offered gifts of clothes and food to Omari and Omar. In 2019, the Taliban released a picture of the supposed hideout where Omar spent the last years of his life. The pictures show a modest mud house with a small garden in which Omar &quot;used to sit in the sun&quot;, according to a Taliban spokesman.

Jabbar Omari said that Omar grew ill in 2013, refusing to visit a doctor and dying of illness on 23 April. Omari and two helpers buried him that night, with Omari videoing the burial as proof. Omari went to Quetta, returning with Omar&#x27;s son Yaqoob and brother Abdul Manan Omari, who had not seen him since 2001. Yaqoob insisted that the grave be opened so that he could see his father. Omari went to Quetta and met with ten senior Taliban to describe the 12 years he spent with Omar. Obaidullah had died in 2010 and Akhtar Mansour was the operational leader of the Taliban. Four religious scholars at the meeting decided that Mansour should continue as leader, but that Omar&#x27;s death and Mansour&#x27;s succession should not be disclosed publicly yet, while the United States was preparing to withdraw from Afghanistan. Some at the meeting unsuccessfully argued for openness. Omar&#x27;s death remained a secret for two years. The Taliban were extremely successful at keeping Omar&#x27;s death hidden during these two years even from highly experienced experts on the upper echelons of the Taliban. Afghanistan and Pakistan analyst Michael Semple, for example, wrote in a December 2014 report that &quot;Mullah Omar remains the Taliban supreme leader and the source of all authority in the movement.&quot;

=== Suspected activities ===
Some believed that Omar hid in the mountains of southern Afghanistan for over a year before he fled to neighboring Pakistan in late 2002. He continued to receive the allegiance of prominent pro-Taliban military leaders in the region, including Jalaluddin Haqqani. According to sources, he lived somewhere in Karachi for a time, where he worked as a potato trader to escape detection; a city where he had lived in already and visited for many years before the group&#x27;s emergence in the 1990s. The United States offered a reward of US$10 million for information leading to his capture.

In April 2004, Omar was interviewed via phone by Pakistani journalist Mohammed Shehzad. During the interview, Omar claimed that Osama bin Laden was alive and well, and that his last contact with Bin Laden was months before the interview. Omar declared that the Taliban were &quot;hunting Americans like pigs&quot;.

In the years following the allied invasion, numerous statements were released that were identified as coming from Omar. In June 2006, a statement regarding the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in Iraq was released by Omar and in it, he hailed al-Zarqawi as a martyr and he also claimed that the resistance movements in Afghanistan and Iraq &quot;will not be weakened&quot;. Then, in December 2006, Omar reportedly issued a statement expressing confidence that foreign forces will be driven out of Afghanistan.

In January 2007, it was reported that Omar made his &quot;first exchange with a journalist since he went into hiding&quot; in 2001 with Muhammad Hanif via email and courier. In it he promised &quot;more Afghan War&quot;, and he also said that the more than one hundred suicide bomb attacks which occurred in Afghanistan in the last year had been carried out by bombers who acted on religious orders which they received from the Taliban – &quot;the mujahedeen do not take any action without a fatwa.&quot; In April 2007, Omar issued another statement through an intermediary in which he encouraged more suicide attacks.

In November 2009, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; claimed that Omar, assisted by Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), had moved back to Karachi in October. In January 2010, Brigadier Amir Sultan Tarar, a retired officer with ISI who had previously trained Omar, said that he was ready to break with his al-Qaida allies and make peace in Afghanistan: &quot;The moment he gets control, the first target will be the al-Qaida people.&quot;

In January 2011, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, citing a report which was published by the Eclipse Group, a privately operated intelligence network that may be contracted by the CIA, stated that Omar had a heart attack on 7 January 2011. According to the report, Pakistan&#x27;s ISI rushed Omar to a hospital near Karachi where he was operated on, treated, and then released several days later. Pakistan&#x27;s Ambassador to the US, stated that the report &quot;had no basis whatsoever&quot;.

On 23 May 2011, TOLO News in Afghanistan quoted unnamed sources as saying that Omar had been killed by ISI two days earlier. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid responded to the report by stating, &quot;He is in Afghanistan safe and sound.&quot; On 20 July 2011, phone text messages which were delivered from accounts which were used by Mujahid and fellow spokesman Qari Mohammed Yousuf announced Omar&#x27;s death. However, Mujahid and Yousuf quickly denied sending the messages and they claimed that their mobile phones, websites, and e-mail accounts had all been hacked, and they swore revenge on the telephone network providers. In 2012, it was revealed that an individual claiming to be Omar sent a letter to President Barack Obama in 2011, expressing slight interest in peace talks.

After Omar&#x27;s confirmed death (April 2013):

On 31 May 2014, five senior Afghan detainees were released from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba in return for the release of American prisoner of war Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl – a person claiming to be Omar reportedly hailed their release.

In December 2014, acting Afghan intelligence chief Rahmatullah Nabil stated that he was not sure &quot;whether Omar is alive or dead&quot;. This statement was made after the Afghan intelligence agency published reports in which it revealed that fracturing was occurring within the Taliban movement, leading some reporters to speculate that a leadership struggle had ensued because Omar had died. Later reports which were released by Afghan intelligence in December said that Omar had been hiding in Karachi. An anonymous European intelligence official stated that &quot;there&#x27;s a consensus among all three branches of the Afghan security forces that Omar is alive. Not only do they think he&#x27;s alive, they say they have a good understanding of where exactly he is in Karachi.&quot;

In April 2015, a man who claimed to be Mullah Omar issued a fatwa which decreed that pledges of allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) are forbidden by Islamic law. The man described ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as a &quot;fake caliph&quot;, and he also said that &quot;Baghdadi just wanted to dominate what has so far been achieved by the real jihadists of Islam after three decades of jihad. A pledge of allegiance to him is &#x27;haram&#x27;.&quot;

=== 2015 announcement of his death ===

On 29 July 2015, Abdul Hassib Seddiqi, the spokesman for Afghanistan&#x27;s National Directorate of Security, said &quot;officially&quot; that Mohammed Omar had died at a hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, in April 2013, and the office of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani confirmed that information on his death was &quot;credible&quot;. Pakistani newspaper &quot;The Express Tribune&quot; reported that a former Taliban minister and current leadership council member, who spoke anonymously, said Omar died from tuberculosis.

The following day, the Taliban confirmed that he was dead, but denied that he died in Pakistan. Other Taliban members stated that his death occurred in Afghanistan. According to an official statement by Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif, &quot;Mullah Omar neither died nor was buried in Pakistan and his sons&#x27; statements are on record to support this. Whether he died now or two years ago is another controversy which we do not wish to be a part of. He was neither in Karachi nor in Quetta.&quot;

Afghan officials report that Omar was buried in Zabul province, a province in southern Afghanistan. Atta Mohammed Haqyar, head of Zabul&#x27;s provincial council, believed that Omar was buried in a cemetery in Sarkhogan area of Shinkay district in Zabul province. Several senior Taliban commanders have also been buried in Sarkhogan area. He further stated that the area had special significance for the Hotak tribe which Omar was from.

Sources close to the Taliban leadership said his deputy, Akhtar Mansoor, would replace him, although with the lesser title of Supreme Leader. It was confirmed by a senior Taliban member that Omar&#x27;s death was kept a secret for two years.

Fidai Mahaz, a Taliban splinter group, claimed that Omar did not die of natural causes; rather he was killed in his hideout in Zabul province.

Many Islamist and jihadist movements expressed condolences following Omar&#x27;s death, including Ajnad al-Kavkaz, Ansar Al-Furqan, Islamic Front&#x27;s Ahrar al-Sham, Jaish Muhammad, Ansar al-Din Front, Turkistan Islamic Party, Jamaat Ansar al-Sunna, Jaish al Ummah, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, Caucasus Emirate, Jaish al-Islam, Al-Nusra Front, AQAP, AQIM, and Al-Shabaab.

Conversely, the Afghan government was unsympathetic to mourning his death; security forces were ordered to prevent citizens from publicly grieving Omar. A National Directorate of Security (NDS) spokesman said that Omar was &quot;the biggest cause of war and backwardness in the modern history of Afghanistan&quot;, adding that any ceremony for Omar would be an &quot;insult&quot; to victims of the Taliban. Meanwhile, thousands of Afghans nationwide took part in rallies on 4 August, denouncing Omar.

After his death, the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan as the Second Islamic Emirate following the Fall of Kabul during the Taliban offensive. During this time the location of Mullah Omar&#x27;s grave was indirectly revealed. The grave is situated in the Suri district of Zabul Province.

== Personal life ==
Despite his political rank and his high status on the Rewards for Justice most wanted list, not much was publicly known about Omar. Omar made no public speeches and always refused to meet foreigners; Before his death, only one known photo existed of him. After his death, the Taliban released a newer and clearer photo showing Omar in his youth in 1978.

Accounts of his physical appearance state that Omar was thin, strongly built and very tall, at around . Omar was described as shy and taciturn, by – for example – the famed Afghan poet Abdul Bari Jahani, who visited him with academics and activists at the beginning of his rule. The members of this group applauded the order and security he brought to the country, and Jahani remembers him as a &quot;tall and handsome&quot; man who &quot;listened in quiet.&quot; Zaeef said &quot;he listened, he was patient, and he did not react in anger.&quot; Conversely, a former Saudi intelligence chief who met him said Omar was &quot;extremely nervous, perspired, and even screamed at me.&quot; Senior Taliban leaders claimed he would &quot;stumble over his native tongue in the interviews he occasionally gave the BBC Pashto service.&quot; He had &quot;at least&quot; three wives and &quot;at least&quot; five or six children, including Mullah Yaqoob, the current acting Defence Minister of Afghanistan.

Omar refused to and never made a pilgrimage to Mecca, despite receiving a personal invitation from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to do so in 1998.

The word literally means &#x27;old woman, hag&#x27;, and is found with this meaning in modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic, and has been applied to numerous mythological and folkloric figures in Ireland, Scotland, and the Isle of Man. In modern Irish folklore studies, she is sometimes known as [[The Hag of Beara]], while in Scotland she is known as Beira, Queen of Winter.

==Name==
 (&#x27;old woman&#x27; or &#x27;hag&#x27; in modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic) comes from the Old Irish (&#x27;veiled one&#x27;), an adjectival form of (&#x27;veil&#x27;), an early loan from Latin , &#x27;woollen cloak&#x27;.

The Cailleach is often referred to as the in Irish and in Scottish Gaelic. Gearóid Ó Crualaoich believes this comes from a word meaning &#x27;sharp, shrill, inimical&#x27; – or – and refers to the Cailleach&#x27;s association with winter and wilderness, as well as her association with horned beasts or cattle.

The 8th- to 9th-century Irish poem &quot;The Lament of the Old Woman&quot; says that the Cailleach&#x27;s name is Digdi or Digde. In &quot;The Hunt of Slieve Cuilinn&quot; she is called Milucra, sister of Áine. In the tale of the Glas Gaibhnenn, she is called Biróg. Elsewhere, she is called Bui or Bua[ch]. In Manx Gaelic she is known as the .

The plural of &quot;cailleach&quot; is () in Irish, () in Scottish Gaelic, and in Manx. The word is found as a component in terms like the Gaelic (&#x27;nun&#x27;) and (&#x27;owl&#x27;), as well as the Irish (&#x27;wise woman, fortune-teller&#x27;) and (&#x27;sorceress, charm-worker&#x27;). Related words include the Gaelic and the Irish (&#x27;young woman, girl, colleen&#x27;), the diminutive of &#x27;woman&#x27;, and the Lowland Scots (&#x27;old woman, witch&#x27;). A more obscure word that is sometimes interpreted as &#x27;hag&#x27; is the Irish , which has led some to speculate on a connection between the Cailleach and the stone carvings of Sheela na Gigs.

==Legends==

In Scotland, where she is also known as Beira, Queen of Winter (a name given by 20th-century folklorist Donald Alexander Mackenzie), she is credited with making numerous mountains and large hills, which are said to have been formed when she was striding across the land and accidentally dropped rocks from her creel or wicker basket. In other cases she is said to have built the mountains intentionally, to serve as her stepping stones. She carries a hammer for shaping the hills and valleys, and is said to be the mother of all the goddesses and gods. According to Mackenzie, Beira was a one-eyed giantess with white hair, dark blue skin, and rust-colored teeth.

The Cailleach displays several traits befitting the personification of winter: she herds deer, she fights spring, and her staff freezes the ground.

In partnership with the goddess Brìghde, the Cailleach is seen as a seasonal deity or spirit, ruling the winter months between Samhainn (5 November or first day of Samhain) and Bealltainn (1 May or first day of summer), while Brìghde rules the summer months between Bealltainn and Samhainn. Some interpretations have the Cailleach and Brìghde as two faces of the same goddess, while others describe the Cailleach as turning to stone on Bealltainn and reverting to humanoid form on Samhainn in time to rule over the winter months. Depending on local climate, the transfer of power between the winter goddess and the summer goddess is celebrated any time between (Imbolc, 1 February) at the earliest, Latha na Cailliche (25 March), or Bealltainn (1 May) at the latest, and the local festivals marking the arrival of the first signs of spring may be named after either the Cailleach or Brìghde.

Là Fhèill Brìghde is also the day the Cailleach gathers her firewood for the rest of the winter. Legend has it that if she intends to make the winter last a good while longer, she will make sure the weather on 1 February is bright and sunny, so she can gather plenty of firewood to keep herself warm in the coming months. As a result, people are generally relieved if Là Fhèill Brìghde is a day of foul weather, as it means the Cailleach is asleep, will soon run out of firewood, and therefore winter is almost over. On the Isle of Man, where She is known as &quot;Caillagh ny Groamagh&quot;, the Cailleach is said to have been seen on St. Bride&#x27;s day in the form of a gigantic bird, carrying sticks in her beak.

According to Mackenzie, the longest night of the year marked the end of her reign as Queen of Winter, at which time she visited the Well of Youth and, after drinking its magic water, grew younger day by day.

In Scotland, the Cailleachan (lit. &#x27;old women&#x27;) are also known as the Storm Hags, and seen as personifications of the elemental powers of nature, especially in a destructive aspect. They are said to be particularly active in raising the windstorms of spring, during the period known as &quot;A&#x27; Chailleach&quot;.
On the west coast of Scotland, the Cailleach ushers in winter by washing her great plaid (Gaelic: &quot;féileadh mòr&quot;) in the Gulf of Corryvreckan (Gaelic: &quot;Coire Bhreacain&quot; - &#x27;whirlpool/cauldron of the plaid&#x27;). This process is said to take three days, during which the roar of the coming tempest is heard as far away as inland. When she is finished, her plaid is pure white and snow covers the land.

In Scotland and Ireland, the first farmer to finish the grain harvest made a corn dolly, representing the Cailleach (also called &quot;the Carlin or Carline&quot;), from the last sheaf of the crop. The figure would then be tossed into the field of a neighbor who had not yet finished bringing in their grain. The last farmer to finish had the responsibility to take in and care for the corn dolly for the next year, with the implication they&#x27;d have to feed and house the hag all winter. Competition was fierce to avoid having to take in the Old Woman.

Some scholars believe the Old Irish poem &quot;The Lament of the Old Woman of Beara&quot; is about the Cailleach; Kuno Meyer states, &quot;she had fifty foster-children in Beare. She had seven periods of youth one after another, so that every man who had lived with her came to die of old age, and her grandsons and great-grandsons were tribes and races.&quot;

===Ireland===
In Ireland, the Cailleach is associated with craggy, prominent mountains and outcroppings, such as Hag&#x27;s Head () the southernmost tip of the Cliffs of Moher in County Clare.

Labbacallee wedge tomb () is located near Glanworth, County Cork and is, according to folklore, the Cailleach&#x27;s grave and former dwelling where she lived with her husband, Mogh Ruith, who she threw a boulder at, pinning him to the floor of the River Funshion.
There is a rock on the Beara Peninsula in West Cork at Kilcatherine said to resemble the Cailleach. In mythology she is said to have leapt across the bay from Coulagh to its present location.

The megalithic tombs at Loughcrew in County Meath are situated atop Slieve na Calliagh () and include a kerbstone known as &quot;the hag&#x27;s chair&quot;. Cairn T on Slieve na Calliagh is a classic passage tomb, in which the rays of the equinox sunrise shine down the passageway and illuminate an inner chamber filled with megalithic stone carvings.

The summit of Slieve Gullion in County Armagh features a passage tomb known locally as the &#x27;Calliagh Beara&#x27;s House&#x27;. There is also a lake, where the Calliagh is said to have played a trick on the mythical warrior, Fionn mac Cumhaill, when he took on the physical appearance of an old man after diving into the lake to retrieve a ring that the Calliagh fooled him into thinking was lost.

Aillenacally (&quot;Aill na Caillí&quot;, &quot;Hag Cliff&quot;) is a cliff in County Galway.

The Carrowmore passage tombs on the Cúil Iorra Peninsula in County Sligo, are associated with the Cailleach. One is called the Cailleach a Bhéara&#x27;s House. William Butler Yeats refers to the Sligo Cailleach as the &#x27;Clooth na Bare&#x27;. In County Sligo she is also called the Garavogue Cailleach.

===Scotland===
The Cailleach is prominent in the landscape of Argyll and Bute, Scotland. In later tales she is known as the &quot;Cailleach nan Cruachan&quot; (&quot;the witch of Ben Cruachan&quot;). Ben Cruachan is the tallest mountain in the region. Tea-towels and postcards of her are sold in the visitor shop for the Hollow Mountain, which also features a mural depicting her accidental creation of Loch Awe. Legend has it that the Cailleach was tired from a long day herding deer. Atop Ben Cruachan she fell asleep on her watch and a well she was tending overflowed, running down from the highlands and flooding the valleys below, forming first a river and then the loch. The overflowing well is a common motif in local Gaelic creation tales - as seen in the goddess Boann&#x27;s similar creation of the River Boyne in Ireland. Other connections to the region include her above-mentioned strong ties with the fierce whirlpool in the Gulf of Corryvreckan.

She is also associated with other Scottish mountains. Ben Nevis was said to be her &quot;mountain throne&quot;. The two mountains on the Isle of Skye named Beinn na Caillich (western and eastern) after her, from which fierce storms of sleet and rain descend, wreaking havoc and destruction upon the lands below.

There is a Gleann Cailliche in Glen Lyon in Perthshire with a stream named Allt Cailliche which runs into Loch Lyon. This area is famous for a pagan ritual which according to legend is associated to the Cailleach. There is a small shieling in the Glen, known as either Tigh nan Cailleach (Scottish Gaelic for &quot;house of the old women&quot;) or Tigh nam Bodach, (Scottish Gaelic for &quot;house of the old men&quot;), which houses a number of heavy water-worn stones, resembling miniature human beings. Roughly rectangular, the building originally measured 2m by 1.3m by 0.4m high with a stone roof. A replacement roof of a wooden pallet having collapsed and the whole building having become somewhat ruinous it was rebuilt by a local dyker in 2011.

According to local legend the stones represent the Cailleach, her husband the Bodach, and their children and the site may represent the only surviving shrine of its kind in Great Britain. The local legend suggests that the Cailleach and her family were given shelter in the glen by the locals and while they stayed there the glen was always fertile and prosperous. When they left they gave the stones to the locals with the promise that as long as the stones were put out to look over the glen at Bealltainn and put back into the shelter and made secure for the winter at Samhain then the glen would continue to be fertile. This ritual is still carried out to this day.

==In popular culture==
* In Scottish Gaelic literature, the Cailleach was famously used to personify the internal literary critic of 18th-century poet William Ross. Despite being widely viewed as a, &quot;love-lorn romantic who died of unrequited love&quot;, due to the poet&#x27;s many versifications of his loss and heartbreak over the 1782 marriage of his beloved Mòr Ros, Ross was also capable of poking fun at himself, as in the self-flyting poem &quot;Oran eadar am Bàrd agus Cailleach-mhilleadh-nan-dàn&quot; (&quot;Exchange of Verses between the Poet and the Hag-who-spoils-poems&quot;).
* According to American ethnomusicologist Amy Murray, the Gaels of the Outer Hebrides sometimes referred to Queen Victoria as &quot;A&#x27; chailleach a-stùiradh&quot; (&quot;The Hag that&#x27;s steering&quot;).
* Morna Young&#x27;s dramatisation of Hans Christian Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Snow Queen&quot;, produced by the Lyceum Theatre Company, Edinburgh, in November/December 2023, conflates the characters of Beira, Queen of Winter, and the Snow Queen.
* A version of the Cailleach appears in the 1978 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Stones of Blood&quot;, impersonated by a long-lived alien and worshipped by a modern druid cult.

<doc id="86187" wikidata="Q2935181" url="?curid=86187" title="Camma">
<text>Camma () was a Galatian princess and priestess of Artemis whom Plutarch writes about in both &quot;On the Bravery of Women&quot; and the &quot;Eroticus&quot; or &quot;Amatorius&quot;. As Plutarch is our only source on Camma, her historicity cannot be independently verified. In both works, Plutarch cites her as an exemplar of fidelity and courage in love.

In Plutarch&#x27;s accounts, Camma was wedded to the Sinatus, and became known and admired for her virtue and beauty. Sinatus&#x27; rival, another tetrarch named Sinorix, murdered Sinatus and proceeded to woo Camma herself. Rather than submit to Sinorix&#x27; advances, Camma took him to a temple of Artemis where she served poison to both herself and him in a libation of either milk and honey or mead. Camma died happily, according to Plutarch, in the knowledge that she had avenged the death of her husband.

Plutarch&#x27;s story of Camma inspired a number of works of later art and literature. Polyaenus briefly reprises Plutarch&#x27;s tale in his 2nd-century CE &quot;Stratagems of War&quot;. In the Renaissance, the story of Camma enjoyed considerable popularity, inspiring &quot;De re uxoria&quot; by Barbaro, &quot;De institutione feminae christianae&quot; by Vives, the &quot;Libro del cortegiano&quot; by Castiglione, and &quot;Orlando furioso&quot; by Ariosto (where Camma is renamed Drusilla). Thomas Corneille wrote a play named &quot;Camma&quot; (1661) about the story of the Galatian princess. The opera &quot;Nephté&quot; (1789) by Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne uses the story of Camma but moves the setting to Ancient Egypt. Tennyson subsequently wrote the tragedy &quot;The Cup&quot; (1884), in which Camma is again a Galatian princess. The poem ‘Camma’ by Oscar Wilde has been seen as a hedonistic commentary on Plutarch&#x27;s Camma.

<text>Camulus or Camulos is a Celtic deity who was identified with Mars via &quot;interpretatio romana&quot;. Camulus was an important god of Roman Britain and Gaul, especially among the Belgae and the Remi, Gaulish tribes that originate from the areas of modern day Belgium, Luxembourg, Northern France and parts of Germany and the Netherlands. 

== Name ==
The etymology of the name is uncertain. It has been compared with the Old Irish , meaning &#x27;champion&#x27;.

==Attestations==
Evidence of Camulus&#x27; popularity can be seen in several place-names, notably Camulodunum.

Camulus is named in combination with Mars in inscriptions coming from Reims, Arlon, Kruishoutem, Rindern, Mainz, Bar Hill Fort near the Antonine Wall, Sarmizegetusa, and Southwark, London.

The town Camulodunum (now Colchester) in Essex may have been named after him (and is the conjectured basis for the legendary city of Camelot). Camulodunum is a Latinised form of the Brittonic &quot;Camulodūnon&quot; from &quot;Camulos&quot; plus &quot;dūnon&quot; &quot;(hill)fort, stronghold&quot;, a reference to the town&#x27;s extensive Iron Age earthwork defences.

==Theories==
Attempts from the 20th century and earlier to link the name &quot;Camulus&quot; with the nursery rhyme character Old King Cole, and with Irish mythological Cumhall, the hero Fionn&#x27;s father, have been rejected by contemporary scholars.

<text>In Celtic mythology, Carman (Carmán) or Carmun was a warrior and sorceress from Athens who tried to invade Ireland in the days of the Tuatha Dé Danann, along with her three sons, Dub (&quot;darkness&quot;), Dother (&quot;evil&quot;) and Dian (&quot;violence&quot;). She used her magical powers to destroy all the fruit of Ireland.

Four of the Tuatha Dé Danann, Crichinbel, Lug, Bé Chuille and Aoi, challenged Carman and her sons. The sons were forced to leave Ireland, and Carman was imprisoned. She died of longing and was buried in Wexford among oak trees. Her grave was dug by Bres. The place she was buried was called Carman after her, and the Tuatha Dé Danann are said to have instituted an Óenach Carmán, or Festival of Carmán.

Celtic historian Peter Berresford Ellis describes her as &quot;a goddess who came to Ireland from Athens with her three ferocious sons – Calma (Valiant), Dubh (Black) and Olc (Evil). They laid Ireland to waste but were eventually overcome by the Tuatha Dé Danann. Carmán died of grief and it is recorded that death &#x27;came upon her in an ungentle shape&#x27;. She was subsequently remembered in Leinster by a Festival of Carmán held at Lughnasad, 1 August.&quot;

Her story is told in a poem of the Metrical Dindshenchas, which states that she died in 600 BCE.

<text>Bé Chuille, also known as Becuille and Bé Chuma, is the daughter of Flidais and one of the Tuatha Dé Danann in Irish mythology. In a tale from the Metrical Dindshenchas, she is a good sorceress who joins three other of the Tuatha Dé to defeat the evil Greek witch Carman. According to the Book of Leinster (1150) Bé Chuille was killed, along with Dianann, by &quot;gray demons of air.&quot; During the second Second Battle of Moytura, Bé Chuille and Dianann are called Lugh&#x27;s two witches, and when asked what they will do in battle, they respond that they will enchant the trees, stones, and grasses of the earth to route the Fomorians with horror and affliction. In the Lebor Gabála Érenn Bé Chuille and Dianann are called &quot;she-farmers&quot; and mentioned along with their sisters Argoen and Be Theite as the daughters of Flidais.

Becuille is often confused with Bechuma of the Fair Skin. In &quot;Echtrae Airt meic Cuinn&quot; (&quot;The Echtra, or Adventure, of Art mac Cuinn&quot;), Bechuma is married to Eogan Inbir, but commits adultery with Gaidiar, son of Manannán mac Lir, and is banished to the human world. Conn of the Hundred Battles marries her, but she becomes infatuated with his son Art. The druids inform Conn that Bechuma&#x27;s wickedness has turned his realm into a Wasteland, and she is eventually exiled.

<text>Cartimandua or Cartismandua (reigned ) was a 1st-century queen of the Brigantes, a Celtic people living in what is now northern England. She is known through the writings of Roman historian Tacitus.

She came to power during the time period that Rome was campaigning against Britain. She was widely influential during her reign. As ruler of the Brigantes, she united various British tribes that eventually surrendered their loyalty to Rome.

Cartimandua is portrayed notoriously in Tacitus&#x27;s account of her. She is recorded betraying the Celtic chieftain Caratacus, insincerely offering him sanctuary, but instead turning him in to the Romans in exchange for wealth. She also is recorded for her disloyalty to her husband, whom she divorced and replaced with a common military man. She subsequently engaged in extended military conflict with her ex-husband as he staged revolts against her multiple times, eventually losing to him. 

==History==
Although Cartimandua is first mentioned by Tacitus in AD 51, her rule over the Brigantes may have already been established when the Roman emperor Claudius began the organised conquest of Britain in 43: she may have been one of the eleven &quot;kings&quot; who Claudius&#x27;s triumphal arch says surrendered without a fight. If not, she may have come to power after a revolt of a faction of the Brigantes was defeated by Publius Ostorius Scapula in 48.

Being of &quot;illustrious birth&quot;, according to Tacitus, Cartimandua probably inherited her power, as she does not appear to have obtained it through marriage. She and her husband, Venutius, are described by Tacitus as loyal to Rome and &quot;defended by our [Roman] arms&quot;.

Her name may be a compound of the Common Celtic roots &quot;*carti-&quot; &quot;chase, expel, send&quot; and &quot;*mandu-&quot; &quot;pony&quot;.

=== Betrayal of Caratacus ===

In 51, the British resistance leader Caratacus sought sanctuary with Cartimandua after being defeated by Ostorius Scapula in Wales, but Cartimandua handed him over to the Romans in chains. According to Tacitus:

&quot;She had later strengthened her power when she was credited with having captured King Caratacus by treachery and so furnished an adornment for the triumph of Claudius Caesar. From this came her wealth and the wanton spirit which success breeds.&quot;

=== Venutius divorce and conflict ===

Cartimandua later divorced Venutius, replacing him with his armour-bearer, Vellocatus. In 57, although Cartimandua had seized his brother and other relatives and held them hostage, Venutius made war against her and then against her Roman protectors. He built alliances outside the Brigantes, and during the governorship of Aulus Didius Gallus (52–57) he staged an invasion of the kingdom of the Brigantes. The Romans had anticipated this and sent some cohorts to defend their client queen. The fighting was inconclusive until Caesius Nasica arrived with a legion, the &quot;IX Hispana&quot;, and defeated the rebels. Cartimandua retained the throne thanks to prompt military support from Roman forces.

Tacitus wrote:

&quot;She grew to despise her husband Venutius, and took as her consort his squire Vellocatus, whom she admitted to share the throne with her. Her house was at once shaken by this scandalous act. Her husband was favoured by the sentiments of all the citizens; the adulterer was supported by the queen&#x27;s passion for him and by her savage spirit. So Venutius, calling in aid from outside and at the same time assisted by a revolt of the Brigantes themselves, put Cartimandua into an extremely dangerous position. Then she asked the Romans for protection, and in fact some companies of our foot and horse, after meeting with indifferent success in a number of engagements, finally succeeded in rescuing the queen from danger. The throne was left to Venutius; the war to us.&quot;

Tacitus refers to Cartimandua&#x27;s dumping of her husband for Vellocatus as scandalous. He Also discusses how Venutius rallies against her, but fails after she secures aid from the Romans.

Cartimandua was not as successful in the year 69. Taking advantage of Roman instability during the year of four emperors, Venutius staged another revolt, again with help from other nations. Cartimandua appealed for troops from the Romans, who were only able to send auxiliaries. Cartimandua was evacuated, leaving Venutius in control of a kingdom at war with Rome. After this, Cartimandua disappears from the sources.

<text>Ceridwen or Cerridwen ( &quot;Ke-RID-wen&quot;) was an enchantress in Welsh medieval legend. She was the mother of a hideous son, Morfran, and a beautiful daughter, Creirwy. Her husband was Tegid Foel and they lived near Bala Lake () in north Wales. Medieval Welsh poetry refers to her as possessing the cauldron of poetic inspiration (Awen) and the Tale of Taliesin recounts her swallowing her servant Gwion Bach who is then reborn through her as the poet Taliesin. Ceridwen is regarded by many modern pagans as the Celtic goddess of rebirth, transformation, and inspiration.

==Etymology==
Marged Haycock catalogues various forms of the name in the early texts, and in less detail in her edition of the Taliesin poems. These mainly occur in manuscripts which have been dated to the 13th century, though they may, of course, be using earlier forms or 13th century adaptations of earlier forms. &quot;The Black Book of Carmarthen&quot; gives ‘’. &quot;Peniarth 3&quot; gives ‘’, &quot;The Book of Taliesin&quot; variously gives ‘’, ‘’ and ‘’, while &quot;The Red Book of Hergest&quot; gives ‘’. So ‘-fen’ is the most common termination (a mutated form of archaic ‘’ : ‘woman’). The variant forms ‘fen’, ‘uen’ and ‘ven’ are all due to variant scribal practices in the spelling of the sound in the modern letter ‘v’, as is the letter ‘w’, which was also sometimes used for this sound, causing the final syllable to be confused with ‘’ as a mutated form of Gwen (fair, blessed) a common ending to Welsh names. So ‘’ as a modern Welsh form of the name. Similarly, the difference between the ‘C’ and the ‘K’ initial consonant is clearly simply a matter of a different spelling convention to represent the hard ‘c’ sound. But the following vowel, ‘y’ or ‘e’ could well represent a shift in actual pronunciation of the vowel sound. 
Sir Ifor Williams asserted that ‘’ is the most likely original form from ‘’ (bent, angled), so ‘woman with a crooked back’, fitting the stereotype of a witch. Marged Haycock accepts ‘’ but questions the first syllable as ‘cyr’, suggesting other possible alternatives which could relate to ‘’ (shake or shiver), or ‘’ (passionate, fierce, powerful), but also notes her daughter Creirwy, with the first syllable a form of ‘’ (belief) and so, by analogy, her mother’s name as Credidfen would mean ‘woman to be believed in’, making the mother’s and daughter’s name stems a pair.

The earliest poems emphasise her keeping of the cauldron of awen and so a source of poetic inspiration. Cuhelyn Fardd (1100-1130) spoke of being inspired by her muse, while Cynddelw Prydydd Mawr (1155-1200) acknowledged her as the source of his art and Prydydd y Moch at the beginning of the 13th century specifically mentions the cauldron of Kyridfen as the source of the gift of awen. These and other references by identified bards are in addition to the many references by unidentified bards in &quot;The Book of Taliesin&quot;.

==Legend==
This story is first attested in a sixteenth-century manuscript written by Elis Gruffydd who claimed that it was widely known in Wales at that time in both written versions and in oral lore The story tells that Ceridwen&#x27;s son, Morfran (also called Afagddu), was hideously ugly – particularly compared with his beautiful sister Creirwy – so Ceridwen sought to make him wise in compensation. She made a potion in her magical cauldron to grant the gift of wisdom and poetic inspiration, also called Awen.

The mixture had to be boiled for a year and a day. She set Morda, a blind man, to tend the fire beneath the cauldron, while Gwion Bach, a young boy, stirred the concoction. The first three drops of liquid from this potion gave wisdom; the rest was a fatal poison. Three hot drops spilled onto Gwion&#x27;s thumb as he stirred, burning him. He instinctively put his thumb in his mouth, and gained the wisdom and knowledge Ceridwen had intended for her son. Realising that Ceridwen would be angry, Gwion fled. Ceridwen chased him. Using the powers of the potion he turned himself into a hare. She became a greyhound. He became a fish and jumped into a river. She transformed into an otter. He turned into a bird; she became a hawk. Finally, he turned into a single grain of corn. She then became a hen and, being a goddess (or enchantress, depending on the version of the tale), she found and ate him without trouble. But because of the potion he was not destroyed. When Ceridwen became pregnant, she knew it was Gwion and resolved to kill the child when he was born. However, when he was born, he was so beautiful that she could not do it. She threw him in the ocean instead, sewing him inside a leather-skin bag (or set him in a coracle, depending on the story). The child did not die, but was rescued on a Welsh shore – near Aberdyfi according to most versions of the tale – by a prince named Elffin ap Gwyddno; the reborn infant grew to become the legendary bard Taliesin.

==Later interpretations==
It has been suggested that Ceridwen first appeared as a simple sorceress character in the &quot;Tale of Taliesin&quot;. Its earliest surviving text dates from the mid-16th century, but it appears from its language to be a 9th-century composition, according to Hutton. References to Ceridwen and her cauldron found in the work of the 12th century or Poets of the Princes (such as Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr) he thus considers later, derivative works. In them, according to Hutton, Ceridwen is transformed from a sorceress into a goddess of poetry. Citing this and a couple of other examples, Hutton proposes that the substantially created a new mythology not reflective of earlier paganism. Nonetheless, references to Ceridwen&#x27;s cauldron (&quot;pair Ceridwen&quot;) are also to be found in some of the early mythological poems attributed to the legendary Taliesin in the &quot;Book of Taliesin&quot;.

The Victorian poet Thomas Love Peacock also wrote a poem entitled the &quot;Cauldron of Ceridwen&quot;. Later writers identified her as having originally been a pagan goddess, speculating on her role in a supposed Celtic pantheon. John Rhys in 1878 referred to the Solar Myth theory of Max Müller according to which &quot;Gwenhwyfar and Ceridwen are dawn goddesses.&quot; Charles Isaac Elton in 1882 referred to her as a &quot;white fairy&quot;. Robert Graves later fitted her into his concept of the Threefold Goddess, in which she was interpreted as a form of the destructive side of the goddess. In Wicca, Ceridwen is a goddess of change and rebirth and transformation and her cauldron symbolizes knowledge and inspiration.

<text>:&quot;The variant spelling &#x27;Elphin&#x27; may refer to Saint Elphin, the town of Elphin, County Roscommon, Ireland or the Diocese of Elphin, cathedral in Sligo Town, Co. Sligo, Ireland. Elphin is also a village in Sutherland, Scotland.&quot;

In Welsh mythology, Elffin ap Gwyddno (Welsh, also Elphin) was a son of Gwyddno Garanhir, &#x27;Lord of Ceredigion&#x27;. The earliest example of the name occurs in several of the mythological poems attributed to Taliesin in the &quot;Book of Taliesin&quot;. The date of their composition is uncertain but probably predates the Norman conquest. Several late medieval compositions refer to Elffin and Taliesin in more detail.

==Hanes Taliesin==
The legend of Elffin&#x27;s association with Taliesin is given at its fullest in the late medieval prose text &quot;Ystorya Taliesin&quot;, the earliest redaction of the tale known as Hanes Taliesin. In that tale Elffin was extremely unlucky. Gwyddno sent him to a salmon weir and had him fish. Instead of catching salmon, Elffin found a baby boy and called it Taliesin (&quot;radiant brow&quot;). Along the way back to his father, Taliesin, though still a baby, spoke in beautiful poetry.

A few years later, Maelgwn Gwynedd, king of Gwynedd, demanded that Elffin praise him and his court. Elffin refused, claiming Taliesin was a better bard and his wife a more virtuous woman than anyone the King had in his court. Taliesin knew what was happening, because he was a seer, and told Elffin&#x27;s wife. Maelgwn&#x27;s son Rhun went to Elffin&#x27;s house to seduce his wife and prove Elffin&#x27;s claims weren&#x27;t true. Rhun got her drunk. When she passed out, Rhun tried to take her wedding ring off to prove her unfaithfulness; since the ring wouldn&#x27;t come off, he cut off her finger. When King Maelgwn attempted to show the finger to Elffin, he pointed out that his wife cut her fingernails more often than the owner of the finger, had servants to knead dough and never had any under her nails, and her ring was loose on her finger, and that one was tight.

Maelgwn demanded Taliesin come to his court to prove the other claim wrong. Taliesin gave twenty minutes for both himself and the King&#x27;s bards to come up with an epic. The royal bards couldn&#x27;t do it. When it came Taliesin&#x27;s time, he caused a massive wind to rattle the castle. Frightened, Maelgwn sent for Elffin. Taliesin&#x27;s next song caused Elffin&#x27;s chains to detach.

Then Maelgwn challenged the pair to a horse race. Taleisin arrived the next day with an old, weak horse. As each of the king&#x27;s horses passed him at the very start of the race, Taliesin touched its rump with a twig of holly. When they had all passed, he dropped his hat to the ground. When the king&#x27;s horses came back, right before the finish line, they stopped at the holly twigs Taliesin had laid there, and began to dance. Taliesin&#x27;s old horse strolled back in quite a bit later and won the race.

==Later literary references==
Thomas Love Peacock&#x27;s novel of 1829 &quot;The Misfortunes of Elphin&quot; relates much of Elfin&#x27;s story. The novel is in part a satire of contemporary British life and in part a playful and ironic version of Welsh legend. The novel includes the discovery of Taleisin as a baby and the attempted rape of Elfin&#x27;s wife by Rhun - which is considerably toned down for a comic novel.

<text>Gwyddno Garanhir was the supposed ruler of a sunken land off the coast of Wales, known as Cantre&#x27;r Gwaelod. He was the father of Elffin ap Gwyddno, the foster-father of the famous Welsh poet Taliesin in the legendary account given in the late medieval &quot;Chwedl Taliesin&quot; (&quot;Ystoria Taliesin&quot;/&quot;Hanes Taliesin&quot;; &quot;The Tale of Taliesin&quot;).

==Legend==
The basket of Gwyddno Garanhir is one of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain. According to tradition, Gwyddno was the lord of &quot;Cantre&#x27;r Gwaelod&quot; () in what is now Cardigan Bay. His chief fortress was said to have been &quot;Caer Wyddno&quot; (), located somewhere to the north-west of modern-day Aberystwyth. The whole kingdom was protected from the sea by floodgates, which had to be shut before high tide. One day the keeper of the floodgates, Seithenyn, was drunk and failed to close them, with the result that the sea rushed in and covered the land.

==Kingdom==
Stories of the drowned lands of Gwyddno appear to have arisen from the identification of natural underwater ridges as the remains of sea walls. However, tradition also assigns Gwyddno a landlocked portion of his kingdom to which he was able to flee. He was called &#x27;King of Ceredigion&#x27; by the 18th century Welsh antiquarian, Iolo Morganwg, well known for his literary forgeries, but he does not appear in the Old Welsh pedigrees for that kingdom. He is identified with a number of different historical Gwyddnos in various sources. 16th century writers favoured Gwyddno ap Clydno, the late 6th century King of Meirionydd, who is perhaps the most likely candidate.

In Susan Cooper&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; series, Gwyddno is the king of the Lost Lands in &quot;Silver on the Tree&quot;.

==Epithet==
His name is Welsh and means &quot;Gwyddno Long-Shanks,&quot; &quot;Crane-Legs,&quot; or literally &quot;Tall-Crane.&quot;

<doc id="86205" wikidata="Q886399" url="?curid=86205" title="Maelgwn Gwynedd">
<text>Maelgwn Gwynedd (; died c. 547) was King of Gwynedd during the early 6th century. Surviving records suggest he held a pre-eminent position among the Brythonic kings in Wales and their allies in the &quot;Old North&quot; along the Scottish coast. Maelgwn was a generous supporter of Christianity, funding the foundation of churches throughout Wales and even far beyond the bounds of his own kingdom. Nonetheless, his principal legacy today is the scathing account of his behavior recorded in &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot; by Gildas, who considered Maelgwn a usurper and reprobate. The son of Cadwallon Lawhir ap Einion and great-grandson of Cunedda, Maelgwn was buried on &quot;Ynys Seiriol&quot; (now known as Puffin Island in English), off the eastern tip of Anglesey, having died of the &quot;yellow plague&quot;; quite probably the arrival of Plague of Justinian in Britain.

== Name ==
&quot;Maelgwn&quot; (IPA: ) in a Middle Welsh name meaning &quot;Princely Hound&quot;. Attested in Latin as &quot;Maglocunus&quot; in Gildas&#x27; De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, it derives from a Common Brittonic form reconstructed as *&quot;Maglo-kunos&quot;, a compound composed of the root *&quot;maglo&quot;- (MW. &quot;mael&quot;) meaning &quot;prince&quot;, attached to *&quot;cun-&quot; (&quot;cwn&quot;), an old oblique case root of &quot;*cū&quot; (&quot;ci&quot;), meaning &quot;hound, dog&quot;. As the word for &quot;hound&quot; was sometimes used as a kenning for warriors in early Welsh poetry, the name may also be translated as &#x27;Princely Warrior&#x27;.

== Reign ==
After the collapse of Roman authority in Britain, north Wales was invaded and colonized by Gaelic tribes from Ireland. The kingdom of Gwynedd began with the reconquest of the coast by northern Britons under the command of Maelgwn&#x27;s great-grandfather Cunedda. Three generations later, Maelgwn&#x27;s father Cadwallon Lawhir ap Einion completed the process by destroying the last Irish settlements on Anglesey. Maelgwn was the first king to enjoy the fruits of his family&#x27;s conquest and he is considered the founder of the medieval kingdom&#x27;s royal family. He is thus most commonly referenced by appending the name of the kingdom to his own: Maelgwn Gwynedd.

By tradition, his &quot;llys&quot; (, literally hall) was located at Deganwy, in the Creuddyn Peninsula of Rhos. Tradition also holds that he died at nearby Llanrhos, and was buried there. Other traditions say that he was buried at &quot;Ynys Seiriol&quot; (), off easternmost Anglesey. There are no historical records to confirm or deny these traditions.

Historical records of this early era are scant. Maelgwn appears in the royal genealogies of the Harleian genealogies, Jesus College MS. 20, and &quot;Hengwrt MS. 202&quot;. His death in a &quot;great mortality&quot; of 547 is noted in the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;. Tradition holds that he died of the &quot;Yellow Plague&quot; () of Rhos, but this is based on one of the &quot;Triads&quot; that was written much later. The record says only that it was a &quot;great mortality&quot;, which followed the outbreak of the great Plague of Justinian in Constantinople by a few years.

Maelgwn was a generous contributor to the cause of Christianity throughout Wales. He made donations to support saints Brynach in Dyfed, Cadoc in Gwynllwg, Cybi in Anglesey, Padarn in Ceredigion, and Tydecho in Powys. He is also associated with the foundation of Bangor, but hard evidence of this is lacking. In his 1723 &quot;Mona Antiqua Restaurata&quot;, Henry Rowlands asserts that Bangor was raised to an episcopal see by Maelgwn in 550, but he provides no source for the assertion.

The only contemporary information about the person is provided by Gildas, who includes Maelgwn among the five British kings whom he condemns in allegorical terms in his &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;. He says Maelgwn held a regional pre-eminence among the other four kings, going on to say that he overthrew his paternal uncle () to gain the throne; that he had taken up life as a monk but then returned to the secular world; that he had been married and divorced, then remarried to the widow of his nephew after being responsible for his nephew&#x27;s death; and that he was tall.

== &quot;High king&quot; ==
The evidence suggests that Maelgwn held a pre-eminent position over the regions ruled by the descendants of Cunedda, perhaps in the sense of a regional high king. There is nothing to suggest that Maelgwn held sway over any larger area. Gildas says as much in his condemnation, saying he held a pre-eminence over the other four kings similarly condemned, and also describing him as the &quot;dragon of the island&quot;, where the Isle of Anglesey is the ancient stronghold of the kings of Gwynedd.

The fact that Maelgwn&#x27;s donations to religious foundations are not restricted to the Kingdom of Gwynedd but are spread throughout northern and southern Wales in the regions where the descendants of Cunedda held sway implies that Maelgwn had a responsibility to those regions beyond the responsibilities of a king to his own kingdom.

While the context is not definitive, Taliesin also implies it, in his &quot;Marwnad Rhun&quot; () that laments the death of Maelgwn&#x27;s son Rhun, where he says that Rhun&#x27;s death is &quot;the fall of the court and girdle of Cunedda&quot;.

== Gildas ==
In his work &quot;On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain&quot; written c. 540, Gildas makes an allegorical condemnation of five British kings by likening them to the beasts of the Book of Revelation 13:2 — the lion, leopard, bear and dragon, with the dragon supreme among them. He says that Maelgwn is the &quot;dragon of the island&quot;, and goes on with a litany of moral accusations, in the process describing him almost as a regional high king over the other kings (the power-giving dragon of the Apocalypse). The Isle of Anglesey was the base of power of the kings of Gwynedd, so describing Maelgwn as the &quot;dragon of the island&quot; is appropriate.

Gildas restricts his attention to the kings of Gwynedd (Maelgwn), Dyfed (Vortiporius), Penllyn (probable, as its king Cuneglasus (Cynlas) appears in royal genealogies associated with the region), Damnonia/Alt Clud or Dumnonia (Constantine), and the unknown region associated with Caninus. Gwynedd is associated with the conquest of the Gaels by Cunedda, while Alt Clud had a long and ongoing relationship with Gwynedd and its kings.

In the course of his condemnations, Gildas makes passing reference to the other beasts mentioned in the Apocalypse, such as the eagle, serpent, calf and wolf. The reason for Gildas&#x27; disaffection for these individuals is unknown. He was selective in his choice of kings, as he had no comments concerning the kings of the other British kingdoms that were thriving at the time, such as Rheged, Gododdin, Elmet, Pengwern/Powys, or the kingdoms of modern-day southern England. That he chose only the kings associated with one king&#x27;s pre-eminence (Maelgwn, the &quot;dragon&quot;) suggests a reason other than his claim of moral outrage over personal depravity. Neither outrage nor a doctrinal dispute would seem to justify beginning the condemnation of the five kings with a personal attack against the mother of one of the kings, calling her an &quot;unclean lioness&quot;.

== Literary record ==
In the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, Nennius says that &quot;the great king Mailcun reigned among the Britons, i.e., in Gwynedd&quot;. He adds that Maelgwn&#x27;s ancestor Cunedda arrived in Gwynedd 146 years before Maelgwn&#x27;s reign, coming from Manaw Gododdin, and expelled the Scots [i.e., the Gaels] with great slaughter.

Maelgwn appears once in the &quot;Welsh Triads&quot;: In the &quot;Three Tribal Thrones of the Island of Britain&quot;, which describes three seats of power, each ruled by Arthur, Maelgwn is Arthur&#x27;s Chief of Elders in Mynyw (St Davids). The pestilence that killed him also appears as one of the &quot;Three Dreadful Pestilences of the Isle of Britain&quot;. It is described as the Yellow Plague of Rhos, originating from the carcasses of the dead.

There is an incidental mention of Maelgwn in the song &quot;To Maenwyn&quot; found in the Red Book of Hergest and attributed to Llywarch Hen. The steward () Maenwyn is encouraged to resist a command to surrender his post and show his fidelity to Maelgwn.

In the Book of Llandaff, compiled c. 1125, Maelgwn Gwynedd is claimed to be one of the benefactors of the Diocese of Llandaff in its early years. One of the specific places mentioned is at Louhai (Tintern parva, some six miles north of Chepstow), where Maelgwn is claimed as a secular witness to its donation.

In the Black Book of Carmarthen, Dormarch, Gwyn ap Nudd&#x27;s favourite hound, is recorded as previously belonging to Maelgwn Gwynedd. This is significant in relation to the mythological role of his new master in the Wild Hunt.

== Fictional tradition ==
As a famous king of the past, Maelgwn&#x27;s name figures strongly in Welsh legend. It is used more often than most in questionable accounts of history and in genuine efforts at history that either invent fictions of their own or repeat the fictions of others as though they were true. Some of the most significant sources of misinformation about Maelgwn are:

=== The &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; ===
Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s 12th century pseudohistorical &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; includes Maelgwn (Malgo) as a character in its account of British history. It says that Saint David was buried at St Davids on the command of &quot;Malgo, king of the Venedotians&quot;, that Malgo addicted himself to sodomy, and that he was succeeded by a certain Careticus. It adds that Britain had groaned under the barbarians since the time of Malgo, that Malgo was the fourth king of Britain after Arthur, and that Malgo had two sons, Ennianus and Runo.

Scholars contend that there is no authority for any of this except Geoffrey&#x27;s fertile imagination. Historically, Rhun ap Maelgwn was Maelgwn&#x27;s son and successor (though this may be the &quot;Runo&quot; Geoffrey refers to). Geoffrey appears to twist Gildas&#x27; words to obtain his reference to sodomy. In his condemnation of 5 British kings in the &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;, Gildas refers to wine as &quot;sodomitical&quot; but never applies that word to any person.

=== The &quot;Brut Tysilio&quot; ===
Once attributed to Saint Tysilio (died 640), the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Britain&quot; was written c. 1500 as an amalgam of earlier versions of the &quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot;, a derivative of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. Among its spurious claims is that Maelgwn Gwynedd came to the crown following Vortiper, that he was succeeded by a certain Caretig, that he was the fourth king of all Britain after Arthur, and that he had two sons, Einion and Rhun.

=== The &quot;Iolo Manuscripts&quot; ===
Maelgwn Gwynedd is mentioned repeatedly in the spurious 18th century &quot;Iolo Manuscripts&quot; of Iolo Morganwg. His three Chief Bards are named, and he is proclaimed King Paramount over the other kings. A Maelgwn Hir of Llandaff is described, and said to be commonly mistaken for Maelgwn Gwynedd. Taliesin is said to have been dispossessed of his property by Maelgwn, and so cursed him. Saint Eurgain is said to be Maelgwn&#x27;s daughter. Saint Cwyllog, daughter of Caw Cawlwyd of Twr Celyn, had been given lands by Maelgwn Gwynedd. In &quot;The Three Holy Families of the Isle of Britain&quot;, there is a story of Caw and his children who had been driven from their lands by the Gwyddelian Picts, and who then came to Wales and were given land in Anglesey by Maelgwn. Without independent and reputable verification, the material found in the &quot;Iolo Manuscripts&quot; is considered to be the product of Iolo&#x27;s fertile imagination.

=== The &quot;Tale of Taliesin&quot; ===
The &quot;Tale of Taliesin&quot; (&quot;Hanes Taliesin&quot; or &quot;Ystoria Taliesin&quot;) is a genuine legendary story about Taliesin which is preserved in two principal redactions dating from the mid-16th century and the early 17th century but which probably derives from older sources. It was first printed in Lady Charlotte Guest&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;: the notes to that edition are the work of Iolo Morganwg and contain inaccuracies and some of his inventions. The story itself tells of events where the Taliesin of legend is placed in difficult or impossible situations but invariably overcomes all obstacles, usually through feats of magic. Maelgwn Gwynedd is conspicuously depicted in a negative light, being foiled in unscrupulous actions of deceit and being outwitted.

The historical Taliesin was actually a contemporary of Maelgwn Gwynedd&#x27;s son and successor Rhun. An elegy for Rhun, the &quot;Marwnad Rhun&quot; () was once attributed to Taliesin by some scholars. but is now considered to be of later provenance and is no longer accepted as his work. There is nothing to connect the historical Taliesin with Maelgwn Gwynedd, although references to the legend are found in medieval Welsh poems.

=== The &quot;Chronicle of the Scottish Nation&quot; ===
According to the account of John of Fordun&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle of the Scottish Nation&quot;, written c. 1360, a certain &quot;Maglo, King of the Britons&quot; asks for aid from King Aydanus. There is nothing to link Maelgwn Gwynedd to the Pictish king, Fordun&#x27;s claim notwithstanding. In the next section, Fordun says that later on it is &quot;Cadwallo, King of the Britons&quot; who is receiving aid from King Aydanus.

This story is repeated uncritically in some later histories, and subsequently &quot;Malgo the Briton&quot; is mentioned in Thomas Stephens&#x27; notes on an 1888 publication of &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;, with the stated suggestion that Maelgwn was an ally of &quot;Aeddan&quot; against the Pictish king Bridei. Fordun&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; is given as one of Stephens&#x27; references.

=== The Pictish king Bridei ===
Bridei (died c. 584) was the son of a certain Maelchon (or Melcho, or Maelchú in Irish records). Aside from having a similar name, there is nothing that connects the father of Bridei to Maelgwn Gwynedd.

Of those who have promoted a connection, perhaps the most notable person of late is John Morris in his &quot;Age of Arthur&quot;, where he refers in passing and without authority, to &quot;... Bridei, son of Maelgwn, the mighty king of north Wales, ...&quot;. Though the book has been a commercial success, it is disparaged by historians as an unreliable source of &quot;misleading and misguided&quot; information.

=== Later fiction ===
As a famous king of the past, Maelgwn has been associated with unsubstantiated but popular legends and stories throughout history. Modern authors have occasionally used his name as a character in fictional stories. These include the trilogies of Traci Harding, Mary Gilgannon&#x27;s historical novels, and a fantasy novel by Nikolai Tolstoy.

== Family and children ==
His father was Cadwallon Lawhir and his mother Meddyf, a daughter of Maeldaf. He had a brother and nephew, mentioned in Gildas&#x27; &quot;De Excidio&quot;, but they are unnamed. He is given various wives, including Nesta, Sanan (his nephew&#x27;s wife) and Gwallwyn (possibly his cousin). It is also possible that he impregnated the Pictish princess Waelgush.

His children are variously given as:
* Alser;
* Doeg;
* Einion;

* Rhun Hir.

It is possible but highly debated whether Bridei I and his sister Domelch were children of Maelgwn. Their father is given as Máelchú, which is the Irish form of Maelgwn.

<doc id="86207" wikidata="Q357835" url="?curid=86207" title="Taliesin">
<text>Taliesin ( , ; 6th century AD) was an early Brittonic poet of Sub-Roman Britain whose work has possibly survived in a Middle Welsh manuscript, the &quot;Book of Taliesin&quot;. Taliesin was a renowned bard who is believed to have sung at the courts of at least three kings.

In 1960, Ifor Williams identified eleven of the medieval poems ascribed to Taliesin as possibly originating as early as the sixth century, and so possibly being composed by a historical Taliesin. The bulk of this work praises King Urien of Rheged and his son Owain mab Urien, although several of the poems indicate that Taliesin also served as court bard to King Brochfael Ysgithrog of Powys and his successor Cynan Garwyn, either before or during his time at Urien&#x27;s court. Some of the events to which the poems refer, such as the Battle of Arfderydd (), are referred to in other sources. 

John T. Koch argues that the description of Easter in the praise poem &quot;Yspeil Taliesin&quot; (&#x27;The Spoils of Taliesin&#x27;) indicates that Urien and Taliesin were Christians who adhered to the Latin rather than the Insular observance of Easter. He also suggests that the figure of Taliesin served as a bridge between the worlds of Brittonic Christian Latin literature and the Heroic Age court poets, allowing monastic scribes to cultivate vernacular poetry.

In legend and medieval Welsh poetry, he is often referred to as &quot;Taliesin Ben Beirdd&quot; (&quot;Taliesin, Chief of Bards&quot; or chief of poets). He is mentioned as one of the five British poets of renown, along with Talhaearn Tad Awen (&quot;Talhaearn Father of the Muse&quot;), Aneirin, Blwchfardd, and Cian Gwenith Gwawd (&quot;Cian Wheat of Song&quot;), in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, and is also mentioned in the collection of poems known as &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;. Taliesin was highly regarded in the mid-12th century as the supposed author of a great number of romantic legends.

According to legend Taliesin was adopted as a child by Elffin, the son of Gwyddno Garanhir, and prophesied the death of Maelgwn Gwynedd from the Yellow Plague. In later stories he became a mythic hero, companion of Bran the Blessed and King Arthur. His legendary biography is found in several late renderings (see below), the earliest surviving narrative being found in a manuscript chronicle of world history written by Elis Gruffydd in the 16th century.

==Biography==
Details of Taliesin&#x27;s life are sparse. The first mention of him occurs in the Saxon genealogies appended to four manuscripts of the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; from 828AD. The writer names five poets, among them Taliesin, who lived in the time of Ida of Bernicia (fl. mid-6th century) and a British chieftain, (O)utigirn (Modern Welsh Eudeyrn). This information is considered fairly credible, since he is also mentioned by Aneirin, another of the five mentioned poets, who is famed as the author of &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;, a series of elegies to the men of the kingdom of Gododdin (now Lothian) who died fighting the Angles at the Battle of Catraeth around 600.

Taliesin&#x27;s authorship of several odes to King Urien Rheged (died c. 550) is commonly accepted, and they mention The Eden Valley and an enemy leader, Fflamddwyn, identified as Ida or his son Theodric. The poems refer to victories of Urien at the battles of Argoed Llwyfain, The Ford of Clyde and Gwen Ystrad. Taliesin also sang in praise of Cynan Garwyn, king of Powys. Cynan&#x27;s predecessor, Brochwel Ysgithrog, is also mentioned in later poems.

According to legends that first appear in the &quot;Book of Taliesin&quot;, Taliesin&#x27;s early patron was Elffin ap Gwyddno, son of Gwyddno Garanhir, who was a lord of a lost land in Cardigan Bay called Cantre&#x27;r Gwaelod. Taliesin defended Elffin and satirised his enemy, the powerful Maelgwn Gwynedd, shortly before the latter died (probably in 547 AD). The Latin-Breton &quot;Life of Iudic-hael&quot; refers to Taliesin visiting the monastery of Gildas at Rhuys in Brittany.

According to the Welsh Triads, Taliesin had a son, Afaon, who was accounted a great warrior, and who suffered a violent death, probably in Lothian. Taliesin&#x27;s grave is held in folklore to be near the village of Tre Taliesin near Llangynfelyn called Bedd Taliesin, but this is a Bronze Age burial chamber, and the village of Tre-Taliesin, at the foot of the hill, was actually named after the burial chamber in the 19th century though legend was traced by Edward Lhuyd to the 17th century.

==Legendary accounts of his life==

More detailed traditions of Taliesin&#x27;s biography arose from about the 11th century, and in &quot;Historia Taliesin&quot; (&quot;The Tale of Taliesin&quot;, surviving from the 16th century). In the mid-16th-century, Elis Gruffydd recorded a legendary account of Taliesin that resembles the story of the boyhood of the Irish hero Fionn mac Cumhail and the salmon of wisdom in some respects. The tale was also recorded in a slightly different version by John Jones of Gellilyfdy (c. 1607). This story agrees in many respects with fragmentary accounts in the &quot;Book of Taliesin&quot;.

According to the &quot;Hanes Taliesin&quot;, he was originally known as Gwion Bach ap Gwreang. He was a servant of Cerridwen and was made to stir the Cauldron of Inspiration for one year to allow for Cerridwen to complete her potion of inspiration. The potion was initially intended for her son, Morfran, who although was considered frightfully ugly, she loved nonetheless, and felt that if he would not grow in beauty then he should have the gift of the Awen to compensate. Upon completion of this potion, three drops sprang out and landed upon Gwion Bach&#x27;s thumb. Gwion then placed his thumb in his mouth to soothe his burns resulting in Gwion&#x27;s enlightenment. Out of fear of what Cerridwen would do to him, Gwion fled and eventually transformed into a piece of grain before being consumed by Cerridwen. However, this resulted in Cerridwen becoming impregnated with the seed and upon giving birth, she could not bring herself to kill the baby Gwion. She instead cast him into the ocean in a large leather bag, where he was found by Elffin, who named him Taliesin.

According to these texts Taliesin was the foster-son of Elffin ap Gwyddno, who gave him the name Taliesin, meaning &quot;radiant brow&quot;, and who later became a king in Ceredigion, Wales. The legend states that he was then raised at his court in Aberdyfi and that at the age of 13, he visited King Maelgwn Gwynedd, Elffin&#x27;s uncle, and correctly prophesied the manner and imminence of Maelgwn&#x27;s death. A number of medieval poems attributed to Taliesin allude to the legend but these postdate the historical poet&#x27;s &quot;floruit&quot; considerably.

The introduction to Gwyneth Lewis and Rowan Williams&#x27;s translation of The Book of Taliesin suggests that later Welsh writers came to see Taliesin as a sort of shamanic figure. The poetry ascribed to him in this collection shows how he not only can channel other entities (such as the Awen) in these poems, but that the authors of these poems can in turn channel Taliesin himself in creating the poems that they ascribe to him. This creates a collectivist, rather than individualistic, sense of identity; no human is simply one human, humans are part of nature (rather than opposed to it), and all things in the cosmos can ultimately be seen to be connected through the creative spirit of the Awen. 

The idea that he was a bard at the court of King Arthur dates back at least to the tale of &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, perhaps a product of the 11th century. It is elaborated upon in modern English poetry, such as Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Idylls of the King&quot; and Charles Williams&#x27; &quot;Taliessin Through Logres&quot;. But the historical Taliesin&#x27;s career can be shown to have fallen in the last half of the 6th century, while historians who argue for Arthur&#x27;s existence date his victory at Mons Badonicus in the years on either side of AD 500; the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; offer the date of c. 539 for his death or disappearance in the Battle of Camlann, only a few years earlier than the date of 542 found in the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. Taliesin also appears as a companion of Bran the Blessed in this era, by which time he was clearly perceived as a legendary figure who existed in many different times.

A manuscript in the hand of 18th-century literary forger Iolo Morganwg claimed he was the son of Saint Henwg of Llanhennock; but this is contrary to other tradition. In it he is said to have been educated in the school of Catwg, at Llanfeithin, in Glamorgan, which the historian Gildas also attended. Captured as a youth by Irish pirates while fishing at sea, he is said to have escaped by using a wooden buckler for a boat; he landed at the fishing weir of Elffin, one of the sons of Urien (all medieval Welsh sources, however, make Elffin the son of Gwyddno Garanhir). Urien made him Elffin&#x27;s instructor, and gave Taliesin an estate. But once introduced to the court of the warrior-chief Taliesin became his foremost bard, followed him in his wars, and wrote of his victories.

==Influence==
Modern Welsh poet John Davies of Denbighshire (1841–1894) took the bardic name of Taliesin Hiraethog. The American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, whose mother, Anna Lloyd Jones, was born in Wales, named his Wisconsin home and studio Taliesin and his home and studio near Scottsdale, Arizona Taliesin West.

Susan Kare, the typographer and graphic designer who developed the first set of fonts for the early Macintosh, created a dingbat font called Taliesin that shipped with the update disk for System 2 in 1985. Taliesin is relatively obscure compared to its more well-known counterpart Cairo, the symbol font that featured Apple&#x27;s iconic dogcow logo. It is not clear why the font shares a name with the British poet, having been the only one of the set that does not bear the name of a &quot;world class city&quot; (Chicago, San Francisco, Toronto, etc.). As it contains several glyphs of buildings, furniture, and other aspects of architecture, landscaping, and interior design, however, it has been theorized that Taliesin was also named in homage to Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s aforementioned studio and estate of same name.

===Literature===

As early as the 12th century bards of the Welsh princes adopted the persona of Taliesin to make prophetic and legendary claims for the source of their inspiration or awen as well as those poems which can be attributed directly to them. So some of the poems in the &quot;Book of Taliesin&quot; have been attributed to bards who saw themselves as working within the tradition of a legendary bard whose poems could be re-worked or re-imagined, giving rise to the prose tale in which some of these poems are embedded. Much of the academic work done on these poems focuses on attempting to separate poems by the original bard and later poets imaginatively taking on his mantle.

His name was used, spelled as Taliessin, in Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;. He is a character in Thomas Love Peacock&#x27;s satirical romantic 1829 novel &quot;The Misfortunes of Elphin&quot; where he is discovered as a baby floating in a coracle by Elphin (Elfin) who is fishing. In the 1951 novel &quot;&quot;, by John Cowper Powys, he is depicted as a politically astute court bard who is accomplished in both cookery and poetry.

He also makes an appearance in a number of works of modern commercial fiction that blend history and Arthurian legend, including quite a lengthy appearance in Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;Warlord Chronicles&quot; and Guy Gavriel Kay&#x27;s &quot;The Fionavar Tapestry&quot;. In Stephen R. Lawhead&#x27;s &quot;The Pendragon Cycle&quot;, he is most notable in the first book, eponymously named &quot;Taliesin&quot;, in which he is depicted as Merlin&#x27;s father. In M. K. Hume&#x27;s King Arthur trilogy, he&#x27;s depicted as Merlin&#x27;s firstborn son. Gillian Bradshaw uses him as a stand-in for Merlin in her Arthurian trilogy. He is also a central character in &quot;Moonheart&quot;, an urban fantasy novel by Charles de Lint, and appears as the chief bard of the Kingdom of Prydain in the children&#x27;s novels of Lloyd Alexander which are based on the Welsh &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. The historical novel &quot;Radiant Brow – The Epic of Taliesin&quot; by H. Catherine Watling is based on &quot;The Tale of Taliesin&quot; and the poetry contained in &quot;The Book of Taliesin&quot;. In the young adult fiction series &quot;The Dark Is Rising Sequence&quot; by British author Susan Cooper, he guides young protagonists Will Stanton and Bran Davies through the Lost Land in the final book, &quot;Silver on the Tree&quot;. Taliesin&#x27;s harp-tuning key makes an appearance in &quot;A String in the Harp&quot; by Nancy Bond, a time-travel story set in Wales. The key gives Peter Morgan, the main protagonist, the ability to see visions of Taliesin&#x27;s life.

In Charles Williams&#x27; unfinished series of Arthurian poems, found in &quot;Taliessin Through Logres&quot; and &quot;The Region of the Summer Stars&quot;, Taliesin is the central character, Arthur&#x27;s bard and Captain of Horse, and the head of a companionship dedicated to Christian Charity in Camelot.

He is character in Traci Harding&#x27;s Chosen series starting with The Ancient Future Trilogy where he is an immortal time traveler trying to help the human soul mind evolution advance.

===Music===
The Norwegian classical composer Martin Romberg wrote a concerto for alto saxophone and orchestra in eight parts after the tale named &quot;The Tale of Taliesin&quot;. The concerto was premiered in 2009 by Akademische Orchestervereinigung Göttingen, with the Norwegian saxophonist Ola Asdahl Rokkones as a soloist. The work has since been published at Éditions Billaudot, Paris and played by Mittelsächsische Philharmonie, The Saint-Petersburg Northern Synfonia Orchestra and Nizhny Novgorod Philharmonic Orchestra, the two latter being conducted by Fabio Mastrangelo.

In modern music, Deep Purple&#x27;s second studio album was named &quot;The Book of Taliesyn&quot; in honour of the bard. A track on the album &quot;Softs&quot; by Canterbury prog-rock band Soft Machine is titled &quot;The Tale of Taliesin&quot;. Paul Roland’s 2006 album &quot;Re-Animator&quot; contains a song about the bard titled &quot;Taliesin&quot;. There is a Dungeon synth band from Germany named Taliesin The Bard. The Song &quot;Spiral Castle&quot; by the american Epic Heavy Metal band Manilla Road uses Taliesin as the fictional narrator of the lyrics. The 2024 album by MGMT, &quot;Loss of Life&quot; begins with a spoken word piece which is an excerpt from The Book of Taliesin.

<text>Morda is a village on the outskirts of the town of Oswestry, Shropshire, located near the border of England with Wales.

The village is named after the River Morda, a tributary of the River Vyrnwy.

== History ==

===The Morda Valley===

Prior to 1792, Morda comprised the Drill Inn, perhaps one or two farms, and possibly a small flour mill. The following decades of the Industrial Revolution saw several factories and mills spring up along the banks of the village&#x27;s namesake river, which provided a ready source of power for machinery. These mills were used to grind corn for flour, and to manufacture textiles, paper and animal products. Dwellings were also built at this time to house the local workforce, which comprised blacksmiths, wheelwrights and millwrights among other craftspeople.

The village&#x27;s main enterprise at the end of the 18th century was that of Warren Roberts &amp; Co., originally of Manchester, who opened several mills for the printing and dyeing of calico. Calico activities ceased in Morda around 1818.

The village&#x27;s present school was erected in 1872, replacing one that operated in a malt kiln behind the Drill Inn from around 1850.

===Coal mining and brick making===

There were several good sources of coal in Shropshire and in its heyday in the 1800s the local mining industry rivalled neighbouring Staffordshire in its output. Contributing to this productivity was coal extracted from Morda, Coed-y-go and Trefonen. The coal in the area was often close to the surface and accordingly the bell pit was a common method of extraction.

By the turn of the 19th century, the Ellesmere Canal and the Shropshire Union offshoot opened up the markets to the north and for some fifty years, much coal mining would take place in Morda. In 1813, the Morda Tramway was laid down to transport coal to the canal at Maesbury. In 1860, local entrepreneur Thomas Savin constructed a railway to link the Morda pits to the main line of the Cambrian Railway at Whitehaven, near Llynclys. The railway opened in 1861 but Savin&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1866 ended matters and his mine closed in 1869.

As some of the mines in the area became flooded, their owners turned instead to utilising the clay dug out as a by-product of mining. This clay was most often used in the making of bricks and pottery items.

Coal extraction had mostly ended in the Morda field by 1900.

===Morda House===

The village was home to Morda House, otherwise known as the House of Industry or Oswestry Workhouse, originally opened in 1792 as the communal workhouse for Oswestry, Chirk and Llansilin. After the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 the workhouse&#x27;s scope was extended to take in people from many more of the surrounding parishes.

The main workhouse was a substantial three-storey building that could accommodate up to 300 inmates. In 1891, a 16-bed isolation hospital was erected to the south-east of the workhouse. This later became the Oswestry and Chirk Isolation Hospital, and then Greenfields Hospital. Since the 1980s the former hospital has housed Morda &amp; Sweeney Social Club.

The main workhouse building was destroyed by fire in 1982. The only surviving part of it was a two-storey section that was later incorporated into a private residence.

==Morda United F.C.==
The village is home to the football club Morda United, which plays at the Weston Road Ground. The club was first founded as Morda F.C. in the 1800s, but folded in the mid-1900s. The club was reformed in the 1970s under the name of Morda United F.C. and played throughout central Wales and the West Midlands for more than 40 years. Notable success came in 1991, when the club became Mid Wales Football League champions. Following a period of dormancy from 2017, Morda United reformed and returned to playing action in 2020 in the Shropshire County Football League.

==Other==
Morda features heavily in &quot;Dear Thief&quot; (2014), a novel by the award-winning author Samantha Harvey.
