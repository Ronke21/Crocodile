<text>Jörð () is the personification of earth and a goddess in Norse mythology. She is the mother of the thunder god Thor and a sexual partner of Odin. Jörð is attested in Danish history , composed in the 12th century by Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus; the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century by an unknown individual or individuals; and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, also composed in the 13th century. Her name is often employed in skaldic poetry and kennings as a poetic term for land or earth.

== Name ==
=== Etymology ===
Old Norse means &#x27;earth, land&#x27;, serving both as a common noun (&#x27;earth&#x27;) and as a theonymic incarnation of the noun (&#x27;Earth-goddess&#x27;). It stems from Proto-Germanic &quot;*erþō&quot;- (&#x27;earth, soil, land&#x27;), as evidenced by the Gothic , Old English , Old Saxon , or Old High German (OHG) . The Ancient Greek word (; &#x27;earth&#x27;) is also possibly related. The word is most likely cognate with Proto-Germanic &quot;*erwa&quot; or &quot;erwōn-&quot;, meaning &#x27;sand, soil&#x27; (cf. Old Norse &#x27;sand, gravel&#x27;, OHG &#x27;earth&#x27;).

=== Alternative names ===
&quot;Fjörgyn&quot; is considered by scholars to be another name for Jörð. She is similarly described as Thor&#x27;s mother and her name is also used as a poetic synonym for &#x27;land&#x27; or &#x27;the earth&#x27; in skaldic poems. The name &quot;Hlóðyn&quot;, mentioned in &quot;Völuspá&quot; (as &quot;son of Hlódyn&quot; for Thor), is most likely also used as a synonym for &quot;Jörð.&quot; The etymology of &quot;Hlóðyn&quot; remains unclear, although it is often thought to be related to the goddess &quot;Hludana&quot;, to whom Romano-Germanic votive tablets have been found on the Lower Rhine.

== Attestations ==
=== &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; ===
Jörð receives mention in Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus&#x27;s as &quot;Iuritha&quot;.

=== &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; ===
In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, Jörð receives mention in the poems &quot;Völuspá&quot; and &quot;Lokasenna&quot;. In &quot;Völuspá&quot;, Thor is referred to as &quot;mǫgr Hlóðyniar&quot; and &quot;Fjǫrgyniar burr&quot; (child of Hlóðyn, Fjörgyn&#x27;s child). Hlóðyn, although etymologically unclear, must therefore have been another name of Jörð.

In &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, Thor is called &quot;Jarðar burr&quot; (&quot;son of Jörð&quot;).

=== &quot;Prose Edda&quot; ===
Jörð is attested in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; books &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;. According to section 10 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;:
Additionally, the section describes Jörð&#x27;s ancestry as follows (the included note is Faulkes&#x27;s own; Faulkes uses the anglicization &quot;Iord&quot; throughout his edition of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;):
:Narfi or Narfi was the name of a giant who lived in Giantland. He had a daughter called Night. She was black and dark in accordance with her ancestry. She was married to a person called Naglfari. Their son was called Aud. Next she was married to someone called Annar. Their daughter was called Iord [Earth].
This section, however, varies by manuscript (see discussion below).

Section 25 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; lists Jörð among the &quot;ásynjur&quot; (Old Norse &#x27;goddesses&#x27;, singular &quot;ásynja&quot;):
:Thor&#x27;s mother Iord and Vali&#x27;s mother Rind are reckoned among the Asyniur.

&quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; mentions Jörð numerous times, including in several quotes from skaldic poetry. The second section 4 of the book list kennings for the god Thor, including &quot;son of Odin and Iord&quot;. Section 17 quotes Þjóðólfr of Hvinir&#x27;s composition &quot;Haustlöng&quot;, in which the skald refers to Thor as &quot;the son of Iord&quot; twice. The poem is quoted again in section 23. Section 18 quotes Eilífr Goðrúnarson&#x27;s composition &quot;Þórsdrápa&quot;, in which the skald refers to Thor as &quot;Iord&#x27;s son&quot;.

Section 19 contains a list of kennings for the goddess Frigg, including &quot;rival of Iord and Rind and Gunnlod and Gerd&quot;. Section 90 contains a list of kennings for Jörð, referencing a variety of skaldic kennings for the goddess:
:How shall earth be referred to? By calling it Ymir&#x27;s flesh and mother of Thor, daughter of Onar, bride of Odin, rival of Frigg and Rind and Gunnlod, mother-in-law of Sif, floor and base of winds&#x27; hall, sea of the animals, daughter of Night, sister of Aud and Day.

The section contains quotes from poems by Hallfreðr vandræðaskáld and Þjóðólfr of Hvinir. The Nafnaþulur section of &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; includes Jörð in a list of &quot;ásynjur&quot; names.

Additionally, as the common noun &quot;jörð&quot; also simply means &#x27;earth&#x27;, references to earth occur throughout the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;.

== Scholarly reception ==
According to philologist Rudolf Simek, Jörð is &quot;[a]n Æsir goddess, even though she is also called a giantess&quot;. Simek highlights parallels between Thor and the Vedic deity Indra: &quot;Just as Thor&#x27;s counterpart in Indian mythology, Indra, is begotten by the god of the heavens Dyaus and the Earth, so Thor is also the son of the Earth, just like the proto-ancestor Tuisto ... &quot;.

According to folklorist John Lindow, &quot;Jörd must have been a giantess in the beginning. If so, Odin’s marriage (or, more likely, sexual relationship outside marriage, perhaps not even a willing one on her part) to Jörd should be regarded as parallel to his other strategically minded relationships with giantesses.&quot;

Philologist Haukur Thorgeirsson points out that the four manuscripts of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; vary in their descriptions of the family relations between Nótt, Jörð, Dagr, and Dellingr. Depending on the manuscript, either Jörð or Nótt is the mother of Dagr and partner of Dellingr. Haukur details that &quot;the oldest manuscript, U, offers a version where Jǫrð is the wife of Dellingr and the mother of Dagr while the other manuscripts, R, W and T, cast Nótt in the role of Dellingr&#x27;s wife and Dagr&#x27;s mother&quot;, and argues that &quot;the version in U came about accidentally when the writer of U or its antecedent shortened a text similar to that in RWT. The results of this accident made their way into the Icelandic poetic tradition&quot;.

Some 19th-century scholars proposed that Thor&#x27;s brother Meili should be understood as the son of Jörð.

<text>The Savoy Theatre is a West End theatre in the Strand in the City of Westminster, London, England. The theatre was designed by C. J. Phipps for Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte and opened on 10 October 1881 on a site previously occupied by the Savoy Palace. Its intended purpose was to showcase the popular series of comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, which became known as the Savoy operas.

The theatre was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electricity. For many years, the Savoy Theatre was the home of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company, which continued to be run by the Carte family for over a century. Richard&#x27;s son Rupert D&#x27;Oyly Carte rebuilt and modernised the theatre in 1929, and it was rebuilt again in 1993 following a fire. It is a Grade II* listed building.

In addition to &quot;The Mikado&quot; and other famous Gilbert and Sullivan premières, the theatre has hosted such premières as the first public performance in England of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot; (1931) and Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; (1941). In recent years it has presented opera, Shakespeare and other non-musical plays, and musicals.

==History of the site==
The House of Savoy was the ruling family of Savoy descended from Humbert I, Count of Sabaudia (or &quot;Maurienne&quot;), who became count in 1032. The name Sabaudia evolved into &quot;Savoy&quot; (or &quot;Savoie&quot;). Count Peter (or &quot;Piers&quot; or &quot;Piero&quot;) of Savoy (d. 1268) was the maternal uncle of Eleanor of Provence, queen-consort of Henry III of England, and came with her to London.
King Henry made Peter Earl of Richmond and, in 1246, gave him the land between The Strand and the Thames where Peter built the Savoy Palace in 1263. On Peter&#x27;s death, the Savoy was given to Edmund, 1st Earl of Lancaster, by his mother, Queen Eleanor. Edmund&#x27;s great-granddaughter, Blanche, inherited the site. Her husband, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, built a magnificent palace that was burned down by Wat Tyler&#x27;s followers in the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381. King Richard II was still a child, and his uncle John of Gaunt was the power behind the throne and so a main target of the rebels.

In about 1505 Henry VII planned a great hospital for &quot;pouer, nedie people&quot;, leaving money and instructions for it in his will. The hospital was built in the palace ruins and was licensed in 1512. Drawings show that it was a magnificent building, with a dormitory, dining hall and three chapels. Henry VII&#x27;s hospital lasted for two centuries but suffered from poor management. The sixteenth-century historian John Stow noted that the hospital was being misused by &quot;loiterers, vagabonds and strumpets&quot;. In 1702 the hospital was dissolved, and the hospital buildings were used for other purposes. Part of the old palace was used for a military prison in the eighteenth century. In the nineteenth century, the old hospital buildings were demolished and new buildings erected.

In 1864 a fire burned everything except the stone walls and the Savoy Chapel, and the property sat empty until Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte bought it in 1880 to build the Savoy Theatre specifically for the production of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas that he was producing. The new theatre was built speedily, and accounts noted that it &quot;was situated on a site which, though rich in historical associations, was also rich in the olfactory sense, Mr Rimmel&#x27;s scent factory being close by as was Burgess&#x27;s Noted Fish-Sauce Shop.&quot;

==Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte&#x27;s theatre==

Carte bought the freehold of the site, then known as &quot;Beaufort Buildings&quot;, early in 1880 for £11,000, but had begun planning his theatre several years before. In 1877 he engaged Walter Emden, an architect whose work includes the Garrick and the Duke of York&#x27;s theatres. Before completing the site purchase, city officials had assured Carte that they would open a new street on the south side of the plot, provided he paid half the cost. He paid his half in March 1880, but the officials caused lengthy delays. Carte told &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;I am struggling in the meshes of red tape&quot;. He finally received the necessary agreement in June. At the same time he ran into another obstacle: Emden suddenly revised his estimate of building costs upward from £12,000 to £18,000. Carte dismissed Emden, who successfully sued for £1,790 for services to date and £3,000 for wrongful dismissal.
Design of the theatre was given to C. J. Phipps. The builders were Patman and Fotheringham. Plans were drawn up and executed with speed and efficiency. Nonetheless, the advertised opening date had to be put back several times while the innovative electrical work was completed. The Savoy finally opened on 10 October 1881. Carte had at one time intended to call it the Beaufort Theatre, but he announced in a letter to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 1881, &quot;On the Savoy Manor there was formerly a theatre. I have used the ancient name as an appropriate title for the present one.&quot; The exterior of the building was made from red brick and Portland stone. The interior decoration, by Collinson and Locke, was &quot;in the manner of the Italian Renaissance&quot;, with white, pale yellow and gold predominating, including a gold satin curtain (instead of the usual printed act-drop), red boxes and dark blue seats. There were none of the cherubs, deities and mythical creatures familiar from the décor of rival theatres. Carte wanted nothing that would appear too garish or gaudy to his target, middle-class audience.

On the opening night Phipps took curtain calls along with Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte. &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;A perfect view of the stage can be had from every seat in the house.&quot; Exits on all four sides of the theatre were provided, and fireproof materials were used to ensure maximum safety. There were three tiers with four levels: stalls and pit, balcony, circle, and amphitheatre and gallery at the top. The total seating capacity was 1,292. The proscenium arch was high by wide, and the stage was deep from the proscenium to the back wall. The theatre originally had its main entrance on the Embankment. The parcel on which it was built is steep, stretching from the Strand down to the Embankment along Beaufort Street. After Carte built the Savoy Hotel in 1889, the theatre entrance was moved to its present location at the hotel&#x27;s courtyard off the Strand.
The Savoy was a state-of-the-art theatre and the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electricity. In 1881, Sir Joseph Swan, inventor of the incandescent light bulb, supplied about 1,200 Swan incandescent lamps, and the lights were powered by a generator on open land near the theatre. Carte explained why he had introduced electric light: &quot;The greatest drawbacks to the enjoyment of the theatrical performances are, undoubtedly, the foul air and heat which pervade all theatres. As everyone knows, each gas-burner consumes as much oxygen as many people, and causes great heat beside. The incandescent lamps consume no oxygen, and cause no perceptible heat.&quot; The first generator proved too small to power the whole building, and though the entire front-of-house was electrically lit, the stage was lit by gas until 28 December 1881. At that performance, Carte stepped onstage and broke a glowing lightbulb before the audience to demonstrate the safety of the new technology. &quot;The Times&quot; described the electric lighting as superior, visually, to gaslight. Gaslights were installed as a backup, but they rarely had to be used. &quot;The Times&quot; concluded that the theatre &quot;is admirably adapted for its purpose, its acoustic qualities are excellent, and all reasonable demands of comfort and taste are complied with.&quot; Carte and his manager, George Edwardes (later famous as manager of the Gaiety Theatre), introduced several innovations including numbered seating, free programme booklets, good quality whisky in the bars, the &quot;queue&quot; system for the pit and gallery (an American idea) and a policy of no tipping for cloakroom or other services. Daily expenses at the theatre were about half the possible takings from ticket sales.
The work that opened the new theatre was Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s comic opera &quot;Patience&quot;, which had been running since April 1881 at the smaller Opera Comique. The last eight of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s comic operas were premièred at the Savoy: &quot;Iolanthe&quot; (1882), &quot;Princess Ida&quot; (1884), &quot;The Mikado&quot; (1885), &quot;Ruddigore&quot; (1887), &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; (1888) &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; (1889), &quot;Utopia, Limited&quot; (1893), and &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; (1896), and the term Savoy opera has come to be associated with all their joint works. After the end of the Gilbert and Sullivan partnership, Carte, and later his widow, Helen (and from 1901 to 1903, William Greet, lessee of the theatre), staged other comic operas at the theatre by Arthur Sullivan and others, notably Ivan Caryll, Sydney Grundy, Basil Hood and Edward German. The Savoy Operas of the 1890s, however, were far less successful than those of the Gilbert and Sullivan heyday. After Carte&#x27;s production of &quot;The Chieftain&quot; ended in March 1895, the Theatre briefly hosted the Carl Rosa Opera Company and then closed until late 1895, when Carte resumed productions at the theatre. Sullivan died in 1900, and Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte died in 1901.

The Savoy Theatre closed in 1903, and was reopened under the management of John Leigh and Edward Laurillard from February 1904 (beginning with a musical, &quot;The Love Birds&quot;) to December 1906. The D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company returned to the Savoy for repertory seasons between 1906 and 1909, in which year C. H. Workman took over the management of the theatre. He produced, among other works, Gilbert&#x27;s final opera, with music by German, &quot;Fallen Fairies&quot; in 1909–10, which ran for only 51 performances. He also produced &quot;Two Merry Monarchs&quot; and &quot;Orpheus and Eurydice&quot; in 1910, the latter of which starred Marie Brema and Viola Tree in the title roles. The D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company did not play in the theatre from 1909 until 1929, instead touring throughout Britain and playing London seasons in other theatres; other works held the stage of the Savoy. George Augustus Richardson managed the theatre from November 1911 to February 1915. &quot;The Mikado&#x27;s&quot; record as the Savoy&#x27;s longest-running production was broken by the comedy &quot;Paddy the Next Best Thing&quot; by Gertrude Page, which played for 867 performances from April 1920.

==Rupert D&#x27;Oyly Carte&#x27;s theatre==
In 1915 Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte&#x27;s son, Rupert D&#x27;Oyly Carte, took over management of the theatre. After serving in the navy in World War I, Carte decided to bring the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company back to London in first-rate style. He began to mount seasons of updated and refreshed Gilbert and Sullivan productions at first at the Prince&#x27;s Theatre in 1919. J. B. Fagan&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; first played in December 1922 at the Savoy Theatre with Arthur Bourchier as Long John Silver. It was so popular that it was revived every Christmas until the outbreak of World War II.
On 3 June 1929 Carte closed the Savoy Theatre, and the interior was completely rebuilt to designs by Frank A. Tugwell with elaborate décor by Basil Ionides. The ceiling was painted to resemble an April sky; the walls, translucent gold on silver; the rows of stalls were all richly upholstered in different colours, and the curtain repeated the tones of the seating. Ionides said that he took the colour scheme from a bed of zinnias in Hyde Park. The entire floor space had been replanned: the old cloakrooms and bar at the back of the theatre were relocated to the side, and instead of 18 boxes there was now only one. The new auditorium had two tiers leaving three levels: stalls, dress, and upper circle. The capacity of the old house, originally 1,292, had been reduced to 986 by 1912, and the new theatre restored the capacity almost completely, with 1,200 seats. The new stage was 29.3 feet wide, by 29.5 feet deep.

The theatre reopened on 21 October 1929 with a new production of &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; designed by Charles Ricketts and conducted by Malcolm Sargent. In the only box sat Lady Gilbert, the librettist&#x27;s widow. There were Gilbert and Sullivan seasons at the Savoy Theatre in 1929–30, 1932–33, 1951, 1954, 1961–62, 1975, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003. Other famous works presented at the Savoy included Robert Morley in &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot;, and several comedies by William Douglas-Home starring, among others, Ralph Richardson, Peggy Ashcroft, and John Mills. The long-delayed first public performance in England of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot; played at the theatre in 1931. In 1951 Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Relative Values&quot; premièred at the theatre and ran for 477 performances.

After Rupert D&#x27;Oyly Carte died in 1948 his daughter, Bridget D&#x27;Oyly Carte, succeeded to the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company and became a director and later president of the Savoy Hotel group, which controlled the theatre. Management of the theatre was assumed in 1948 by Sir Hugh Wontner, chairman of the Savoy hotel group. The theatre was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1973. The D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company closed in 1982, and Dame Bridget died childless in 1985, bringing the family line to an end. Wontner continued as chairman of the theatre until his death in 1992.

==1990 fire and restored theatre==

While the theatre was being renovated in February 1990, a fire gutted the building, except for the stage and backstage areas. A proposal to build a new theatre in late 20th-century style was overruled by the Savoy&#x27;s insurers and by English Heritage, the government body that had oversight of listed buildings. It was decided to restore the building as faithfully as possible to the 1929 designs. Tugwell&#x27;s and Ionides&#x27;s working designs had been preserved, allowing accurate restoration of the theatre under the direction of the architect Sir William Whitfield, Sir Hugh Wontner and the theatre&#x27;s manager, Kevin Chapple. It reopened on 19 July 1993, with a royal gala that included a specially commissioned ballet, &quot;Savoy Suite&quot;, by choreographer Wayne Sleep to a score arranged by Carl Davis based on Sullivan&#x27;s music. The present theatre has a capacity of 1,158. During the renovation, an extra storey was added above the theatre that includes a health club for the hotel and a swimming pool above the stage. The reopened theatre was the venue for the World Chess Championship in 1993, won by Garry Kasparov.

In 1993 Coward&#x27;s &quot;Relative Values&quot; was revived. Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Travesties&quot;, with Antony Sher was next, and from 1994 to 1995 the musical &quot;She Loves Me&quot; played, with Ruthie Henshall and John Gordon Sinclair. These were followed by Terry Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dead Funny&quot;; Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s &quot;Communicating Doors&quot; (which transferred to the theatre in 1996), with Angela Thorne; J. B. Priestley&#x27;s &quot;When We Are Married&quot;, with Dawn French, Alison Steadman, and Leo McKern; and Ben Travers&#x27; &quot;Plunder&quot;, with Griff Rhys Jones and Kevin McNally. In 1997 a group led by Sir Stephen Waley-Cohen was given management of the theatre by The Savoy Group. Productions that followed included Simon Callow in &quot;The Importance of Being Oscar&quot;; Pet Shop Boys in concert; Ian Richardson in Pinero&#x27;s &quot;The Magistrate&quot;; Edward Fox in &quot;A Letter of Resignation&quot;; the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s production of &quot;Richard III&quot;, with Robert Lindsay; and Coward&#x27;s &quot;Hay Fever&quot;, with Geraldine McEwan in 1999.

In 2000 the briefly reconstituted D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company produced &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; at the theatre. Donald Sutherland next starred at the theatre in &quot;Enigmatic Variations&quot;, followed by a further D&#x27;Oyly Carte seasons, playing &quot;The Mikado&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. In 2002, a season of &quot;Return to the Forbidden Planet&quot; was followed by the D&#x27;Oyly Carte productions of &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;, The Mikado, and then a revival of Yasmina Reza&#x27;s &quot;Life x 3&quot;. In 2003, the company revived &quot;Pinafore&quot;, followed by &quot;Bea Arthur at The Savoy&quot;, John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and &quot;Pirates&quot;. These were followed by &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; and &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; performed by The Savoy Opera Company in 2004. Next were seasons of Lorna Luft starring in &quot;Songs My Mother Taught Me&quot; and the new salsa musical &quot;Murderous Instincts&quot;. Coward&#x27;s &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; was revived in 2004–05.

The Savoy Hotel group, including the theatre, was sold in 2004 to Quinlan Private which, in turn, sold the theatre in 2005 to the Ambassador Theatre Group (ATG) and the Tulbart Group (selling the Savoy Hotel to Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal). Productions since then have been mostly revivals and transfers of modern musicals; major productions have included &quot;The Rat Pack: Live from Las Vegas&quot; and a new musical theatre version of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, directed by Trevor Nunn (both in 2006), &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (2007–08), &quot;Carousel&quot; (2008–09), &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; (2010–12) and &quot;Let It Be&quot; (2013–14).

In December 2013, ATG acquired sole ownership of the Savoy. The first new production after this was &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; (2014–15), followed by &quot;Gypsy&quot; (2015), &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (2016), &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; (2016–19), and &quot;9 to 5: The Musical&quot; (2019–March 2020), when UK theatres closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The theatre reopened in July 2021 with &quot;Pretty Woman: The Musical&quot;, which had been playing at the Piccadilly Theatre before the closure. The production closed in June 2023. &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; starring Nicole Scherzinger played a limited 16-week run from September 2023 to January 2024. The Broadway transfer of &quot;Plaza Suite&quot;, starring Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick, had a limited run from January to April 2024.

The West End premiere of &quot;Mean Girls&quot; began previews on 5 June 2024 with an opening night on 26 June.

<doc id="88568" wikidata="Q494938" url="?curid=88568" title="Nixon Doctrine">
<text>The Nixon Doctrine (sometimes referred to as the Guam Doctrine) was the foreign policy doctrine of Richard Nixon, the 37th president of the United States from 1969 to 1974. It was put forth during a press conference in Guam on July 25, 1969, by Nixon, and later formalized in his speech on Vietnamization on November 3, 1969. 

According to Gregg Brazinsky, author of &quot;Nation Building in South Korea: Koreans, Americans, and the Making of a Democracy&quot;, Nixon stated that &quot;the United States would assist in the defense and developments of allies and friends&quot; but would not &quot;undertake all the defense of the free nations of the world.&quot; This doctrine meant that each ally nation was in charge of its own security in general, but the U.S. would act as a nuclear umbrella when requested. The doctrine argued for the pursuit of peace through a partnership with American allies.

==Background==
At the time of Nixon&#x27;s first inauguration in January 1969, the United States had been engaged in combat in Vietnam for almost four years. The war had so far killed over 30,000 Americans and several hundred thousand Vietnamese. By 1969, U.S. public opinion had moved decisively to favoring ending the Vietnam War; a Gallup poll in May showed 56% of the public believed sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake. Of those over 50 years old, 61% expressed that belief, compared to 49% of those between ages 21 and 29, even if tacit abandonment of the SEATO Treaty was ultimately required and caused a complete communist takeover of South Vietnam despite previous U.S. guarantees. Because Nixon campaigned for &quot;Peace with Honor&quot; in relation to Vietnam during the 1968 presidential election, ending the war became an important policy goal for him.

==Doctrine==
During a stopover during an international tour on the U.S. territory of Guam, Nixon formally announced the doctrine. Nixon declared the United States would honor all of its treaty commitments in Asia, but &quot;as far as the problems of international security are concerned ... the United States is going to encourage and has a right to expect that this problem will increasingly be handled by, and the responsibility for it taken by, the Asian nations themselves&quot;.

Later, from the Oval Office in an address to the nation on the Vietnam War on November 3, 1969, Nixon said:First, the United States will keep all of its treaty commitments. Second, we shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threatens the freedom of a nation allied with us or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our security. Third, in cases involving other types of aggression, we shall furnish military and economic assistance when requested in accordance with our treaty commitments. But we shall look to the nation directly threatened to assume the primary responsibility of providing the manpower for its defense.

==Doctrine in practice==

The doctrine was exemplified by the process of Vietnamization regarding South Vietnam and the Vietnam War. It also played elsewhere in Asia including Iran, Taiwan, Cambodia, and South Korea. The doctrine was an explicit rejection of the practice that sent 500,000 U.S. soldiers to South Vietnam, even though there was no treaty obligation to that country. A major long-term goal was to reduce the tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and mainland China, so as to better enable the policy of détente to work.

The particular Asian nation the doctrine was aimed at with its message that Asian nations should be responsible for defending themselves was South Vietnam, but Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran seized upon the Nixon Doctrine with its message that Asian nations should be responsible for their own defense to argue that the Americans should sell him arms without limitations, a suggestion that Nixon eagerly embraced. The U.S. turned to Saudi Arabia and Iran as &quot;twin pillars&quot; of regional stability. Oil price increases in 1970 and 1971 would allow funding both states with this military expansion. Total arms transfers from the United States to Iran increased from $103.6 million in 1970 to $552.7 million in 1972; those to Saudi Arabia increased from $15.8 million in 1970 to $312.4 million in 1972. The U.S. would maintain its small naval force of three ships in the Gulf, stationed since World War II in Bahrain, but would take on no other formal security commitments.

One factor in reducing open-ended American commitments was financial concern as the war in Vietnam had proven to be very expensive. In South Korea, 20,000 of the 61,000 U.S. troops stationed there were withdrawn by June 1971.

The application of the Nixon Doctrine &quot;opened the floodgates&quot; of U.S. military aid to allies in the Persian Gulf. That in turn helped set the stage for the Carter Doctrine and for subsequent direct military involvement in the Gulf War and the Iraq War.

==Contemporary usage==
Scholar Walter Ladwig argued in 2012 that the United States should adopt a &quot;neo-Nixon doctrine&quot; towards the Indian Ocean region, in which the U.S. would sponsor key local partners—India, Indonesia, Australia, and South Africa—to assume the primary burden for upholding regional peace and security. A key shortcoming of the original Nixon Doctrine, Ladwig argues, was its reliance on pro-Western autocrats who proved to be a poor foundation for an enduring regional security structure. In contrast, his &quot;neo-Nixon Doctrine&quot; would focus on cultivating the major Indian Ocean nations that are democratic and financially capable of being net providers of security in the region. Although crediting this idea for the &quot;reasonable balance it strikes between US leadership and local initiative&quot;, Andrew Philips of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has suggested the idea overstates &quot;the degree of convergent security interests between its four presumptive sub-regional lynchpin states.&quot;

<text>Fraggle Rock (also known as Jim Henson&#x27;s Fraggle Rock or Fraggle Rock with Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppets) is a children&#x27;s musical fantasy comedy puppet television series about interconnected societies of Muppet creatures, created by Jim Henson.

An international co-production of Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; was co-produced by British television company Television South (TVS), the CBC, American pay television service HBO, and Henson Associates. Unlike &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, which had been created for a single market and only later adapted for international markets, &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; was intended from the start to be an international production, and the entire show was constructed with this in mind. At least four different versions of the human wraparound segments were produced separately to air in different countries.

Following the success of the &quot;Fraggle Rock: Rock On!&quot; shorts which aired on Apple TV+ in April 2020, a reboot of &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; was ordered by the streaming service. Known as &quot;Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock&quot;, it premiered on January 21, 2022.

==History==
&quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; debuted in 1983 as one of the first shows involving the collaboration of Henson International Television (HiT Entertainment from 1989), the international arm of Jim Henson Productions. The co-production brought together British regional ITV franchise-holder Television South (TVS), CBC Television (Canada), and U.S. pay-TV service Home Box Office and the Jim Henson Company (then known as Henson Associates). Filming took place on a Toronto soundstage. The avant-garde poet bpNichol worked as one of the show&#x27;s writers. In the early days of development, the script called the Fraggles &quot;Woozles&quot; pending the devising of a more suitable name.

Henson described the &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; series as &quot;a high-energy, raucous musical romp. It&#x27;s a lot of silliness. It&#x27;s wonderful.&quot; The program proved accessible to audiences of all ages, and used the fantasy creatures as an allegory to deal with serious issues such as prejudice, spirituality, personal identity, the environment, and social conflict.

In 2009, as part of the Jim Henson Foundation&#x27;s donation of puppets to the Center for Puppetry Arts, the Atlanta museum displayed many of the original puppet characters from &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; in their exhibition &quot;Jim Henson: Wonders from his Workshop&quot;.

==International co-productions==
The producers made the series with the intention of it airing in various forms internationally. That concept grew out of Jim Henson&#x27;s experience adapting &quot;Sesame Street&quot; to the requirements of foreign markets. The human &quot;wraparound&quot; segments were produced separately in several countries, so the viewer could always relate to the world of the program. The series has appeared now in over 10 countries and languages. The head producer was Wesley James Tomlinson.
* The original North American version, filmed in Toronto, features an inventor named Doc (played by Gerry Parkes) and his dog Sprocket. This wraparound was also used in Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland, Scandinavia, Spain, Japan, and Eastern Europe. Dutch, Scandinavian, Spanish, Japanese, and Eastern European shows were dubbed in their respective languages.
* The British inserts were filmed first at the TVS Television Theatre in Gillingham, Kent (since closed and demolished), and later at their larger studio complex in Maidstone, and presents &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; as a rock-filled sea island with a lighthouse. Exterior footage was that of St Anthony&#x27;s Lighthouse located near Falmouth in Cornwall. The lighthouse keeper is The Captain (played by Fulton Mackay), a retired sailor who lives with his faithful dog Sprocket. In the third season, as MacKay had died in 1987, the role was played by John Gordon Sinclair as P.K., (the Captain&#x27;s nephew) and in the fourth and final season by Simon O&#x27;Brien as B.J. (son of the lighthouse&#x27;s owner, Mr. Bertwhistle). In 2014, 35 of these British &quot;wraparounds&quot; were still missing, believed wiped, although subsequent recoveries have gradually reduced this number. As of December 2020, all 96 wraparounds have been found and handed over to the BFI, confirming that the entire UK production still exists in some shape or form. Nickelodeon repeated it in the UK from 1993, as did Boomerang and Cartoonito in 2007. The episodes shown were the original North American versions.
* In France, the wraparound segments take place in a bakery with its version of Doc (played by Michel Robin) who worked as a baker and a French Sprocket called Croquette. Doc inherited the home from his eccentric Uncle Georges (who was a noted inventor). Thus, when the frame story required the use of a mechanical device, Doc would find yet another of Uncle Georges&#x27;s machines. Plot-lines also frequently involved the elegant but unseen Madame Pontaven (whom Doc repeatedly attempted to impress and invite to dinner with no success). Not all of the 96 episodes were produced in French.
* In the German version, the action takes place beneath the workshop of the inventor Doc (played by Hans-Helmut Dickow). The series was named &quot;Die Fraggles&quot; with 85 of the 96 produced episodes being presented in German.

==Characters==

There are four main intelligent anthropomorphic species in the Fraggle Rock environment: Fraggles, Doozers, Gorgs, and Silly Creatures. The Fraggles and Doozers live in a system of natural caves called Fraggle Rock that are filled with all manner of creatures and features and which connect to at least two different areas:
* The Land of the Gorgs which they consider part of the &quot;Universe&quot;.
* &quot;Outer Space&quot; (our world).

One of the main themes of the series is that, although the three species depend on the other for their survival, they usually fail to communicate due to vast differences in their biology and culture. The series mainly follows the adventures of five Fraggles, each with their own personality: pragmatic Gobo, artistic Mokey, indecisive Wembley, superstitious Boober, and adventurous Red. Some of the characters&#x27; names are film industry in-jokes. For example, Uncle Traveling Matt is a reference to the traveling matte technique used with blue screen to give the impression a character is somewhere they are not; Gobo is named after a shaped metal grill placed over a theater light to produce interesting shadows (window shapes, leaves, etc.) and Red is a reference to a &quot;redhead&quot;, another name for an 800w film light.

===Fraggles===

Fraggles are small anthropomorphic creatures, typically tall, that come in a variety of colors and have fur tuft tipped tails. Fraggles live a generally carefree life, spending most of their time (they have a thirty-minute work week) playing, exploring, and generally enjoying themselves. They live mainly on radishes and Doozer sticks, made of ground-up radishes and the material with which the Doozers build their constructions. The Fraggles seek wisdom from Marjory the Trash Heap, who is located in a corner of the Gorgs&#x27; garden. Marjory the Trash Heap is a large, matronly, sentient compost heap. According to her rat-like companions Philo and Gunge, the Trash Heap &quot;knows all and sees all.&quot; By her own admission, she has &quot;everything&quot;.

===Doozers===

Within Fraggle Rock lives a second species of small humanoid creatures, the pudgy, green, and industrious Doozers. They stand about tall (&quot;knee-high to a Fraggle&quot;). Doozers are in a sense the opposite of Fraggles; their lives are dedicated to working and industry. Doozers spend much of their time busily constructing all manner of scaffolding throughout Fraggle Rock, using miniature construction equipment and wearing hardhats and work boots. Doozers build their constructions out of an edible candy-like substance (manufactured from radishes) which is greatly enjoyed by Fraggles. This is essentially the only interaction between Doozers and Fraggles; Doozers spend most of their time building just for the sake of it, and Fraggles spend much of their time eating Doozer buildings which they consider delicious. The Doozers say in an early episode that &quot;architecture is meant to be enjoyed&quot;, and in &quot;The Preachification of Convincing John&quot; Mokey prevents the other Fraggles from eating the building work, believing it to be insensitive to the Doozers. As a result, the Doozer building eventually takes over Fraggle Rock, and once full the Doozers plan on moving out as they have nowhere left to build. They explain that they want the Fraggles to eat their work to create space for more building work to go up again. Despite this co-dependence, the Doozers generally maintain a low opinion of Fraggles, considering them frivolous. The Doozers also seem to have little knowledge of the universe outside Fraggle Rock; early in the series, they are unaware of the existence of the Gorgs or their garden. However, there was also one time when Doc found, in his workshop, an ancient-looking Doozer helmet, indicating that the Doozers may have explored outside Fraggle Rock into &quot;Outer Space&quot; at some time in their forgotten past.

Adolescent Doozers come of age with a &quot;taking the helmet&quot; ceremony, in which they proudly accept their Doozer helmet from the Doozer Architect, after swearing to live a life of hard work. Rarely, a Doozer will refuse to &quot;take the helmet&quot;; a once in a generation occurrence that is generally met with shock and disbelief in the Doozer community. Such non-conformist Doozers can, however, find places of high regard in Doozer society, due to the advantages of their more creative way of thinking.

===Gorgs===
Outside another exit from Fraggle Rock live a small family of Gorgs, fat furry humanoids standing about . The husband and wife of the family, Pa, and Ma, consider themselves the King and Queen of the Universe, with their son Junior Gorg as its prince and heir-apparent, but to all appearances, they are simple farmers with a rustic house and garden patch. In &quot;The Gorg Who Would Be King&quot;, Pa says he has ruled for 742 years.

Fraggles are considered pests by the Gorgs, as they often steal radishes from the garden. The Fraggles do not consider it stealing. The Gorgs use the radishes to make anti-vanishing cream, without which they disappear headfirst.

===The Silly Creatures of Outer Space===
In the North American, French, and German versions of Fraggle Rock (along with most other foreign dubs), the connection between Fraggle Rock and Outer Space is a small hole in the wall of the workshop of an eccentric inventor named Doc and his (Muppet) dog Sprocket. In the British version, the situation is much the same, except that the hole leads into the living quarters of a lighthouse where the keeper lives with his dog, Sprocket.

Gobo must go out into Doc&#x27;s workshop to retrieve the postcards from his uncle Matt from the wastebasket where Doc throws them, assuming they are misdelivered. Traveling Matt (a pun on traveling matte, the film compositing technique used in his segments) is exploring the wider world, observing humans, and reporting humorously false conclusions about their everyday behavior.

Sprocket often sees and chases Gobo, but can&#x27;t convince Doc anything lives beyond the wall. Sprocket and Doc have many similar miscommunications throughout the series, given the language barrier, but overall, they understand each other quite well.

In the final episode arc of the original North American version of the show, Doc himself finally meets Gobo and befriends him. Gobo tells Doc that Fraggles refer to humans as &quot;silly creatures&quot;, and apologizes. Doc tells him that he thinks that it is a very good name for humans. Unfortunately in the final episode, Doc and Sprocket have to move to another state, but the Fraggles discover a magic tunnel that allows them to visit Doc and Sprocket&#x27;s new home easily at any time.

The CBC/HBO version of the series has been broadcast and dubbed in 95 countries. The series airs on Channel 7, TV One, Doordarshan, and Workpoint TV. Others were broadcast on Coub as an uploaded video, and others broadcast on TVtropolis (Canada), Bolivision (Bolivia), and CNC3 (Trinidad and Tobago).

After the show ended on HBO in 1987, the channel started to rerun the series. In 1988, it ran on TNT. The show aired on Disney Channel from October 1, 1992 to September 30, 1996. From 1999 to 2001, the show moved to Odyssey Network, which had recently been purchased by Henson and Hallmark. After Hallmark took full control, it discontinued the reruns. From October 10, 2010, to October 4, 2014, reruns aired on The Hub as part of the channel&#x27;s launch.

In 2007, &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; reruns aired on television internationally. On July 23, 2007, Boomerang and Cartoonito started repeating episodes of the original North American production of &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; in the UK, as they were unable to use the UK edits. In January 2013, ITV broadcast two episodes of this version as part of its Old Skool Weekend feature on the CITV channel.

On December 12, 2015, the remastered &quot;The Bells of Fraggle Rock&quot; episode debuted alongside Henson&#x27;s remastered &quot;Emmet Otter&#x27;s Jug-Band Christmas&quot; on ABC Family in its &quot;25 Days of Christmas&quot; programming block. &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; was available on HBO Now in HD and in 2016 the series began to air reruns on HBO Family.

In 2019, &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; debuts along with the Henson classic content on Amazon Prime Video in North America, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Scandinavia, Finland, and Iceland.

On May 26, 2020, Apple TV+ announced that, alongside a series order for a reboot, they had acquired the exclusive streaming rights to the previous seasons of &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; in the 100 countries the service is available in, making the series the first piece of non-original content available on the service.

==Home media==
===Australia===
Magna Pacific published the American version of &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; on Region 4 DVD in 2007. The DVD set &quot;Fraggle Rock: The Complete Fourth Season&quot; actually includes seasons four and five. The DVDs have no special features.

A set of plush dolls of Gobo, Wembley, Boober, and Red were released by Sababa Toys, each accompanied by a DVD featuring two episodes of the show, and one episode of the animated series.

===United Kingdom===
Twelve UK episodes were released on VHS and DVD by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment in April 2004. TVS, the original ITV broadcaster, has passed through several owners since dropping out of the ITV network in 1992 and it was believed only these 12 episodes had survived. The research found more episodes, but many of the original 95 remained lost. HiT Entertainment has tried unsuccessfully to locate the missing episodes, including extensive inquiries with The Jim Henson Company both in the UK and the US. When UK television channels wish to broadcast the show, they have had to use the original US versions; such was the case with Boomerang and Cartoonito in 2007. In addition to the unknown fate of the physical master material, much of the original TVS production paperwork and sales documentation has been lost during the intervening years. This problem affects the majority of the TV program archive, preventing any commercial exploitation. As of December 2017, search efforts and returned episodes from private collectors - mostly home recordings on VHS - have raised the number of episodes to 95, with only one episode - &quot;Gobo’s School For Explorers&quot;, missing.
In December 2020 TV preservation company Kaleidoscope announced via their Facebook page that VHS copies of all episodes had been located and transferred from the collection of producer Victor Pemberton. In 2010, Lionsgate Home Entertainment the UK released seasons 1-3 in complete season box sets. These releases are the same as the American box sets, except without bonus features. However, seasons 4 and 5 have never, as of 2024, been commercially been released in the UK.

===United States===
HBO Video, previously known as HBO/Cannon Video and Thorn EMI/HBO Video, released a collection of single-episode VHS tapes during the 1980s through Jim Henson Video.

In 1993, Buena Vista Home Video, under their &quot;Jim Henson Video&quot; label released five &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; VHS tapes with two episodes each.

HIT Entertainment released several single-disc DVDs with three episodes each (two in the VHS counterparts) plus bonus episodes which could be unlocked by completing a trivia game before releasing the first three seasons of &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; on DVD in Region 1 between September 2005 and September 2007. It released a complete series box set on November 4, 2008, but did not release the final season in a separate release. Season 4 had originally been scheduled to be released on the same day as the complete series set but at the last minute, it was scrapped and was never released.

In 2009, Lionsgate Home Entertainment reached a deal with The Jim Henson Company to release &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; on DVD. It subsequently released the final season on DVD for the first time on November 3, 2009. On the same day, the &quot;Complete Series&quot; collection was re-released with new packaging (due to numerous complaints about the previous release).

In 2013, Vivendi Visual Entertainment acquired the license to release Jim Henson Company DVDs, including Fraggle Rock. Season 1 was re-released on March 12, 2013, followed by Season 2 on April 16, Season 3 on May 14, and Season 4 on June 18. A complete series set was also released on May 14 as &quot;Fraggle RockThe 30th Anniversary Collection&quot;. This 22-disc set features all 96 episodes of the series as well as bonus features. A six-episode DVD was released with the title &quot;Meet the Fraggles&quot;.

On July 11, 2018, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment announced that they would be releasing a complete series set of &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; on Blu-ray in honor of the show&#x27;s 35th anniversary. The 12-disc set includes remastered versions of all 96 episodes of the series in high-definition, and includes all features from the previous DVD season releases as well as adding new material such as a 1993 &quot;Today Show&quot; segment featuring Uncle Traveling Matt, a series of on-set videos with creator Jim Henson, and all 13 episodes of &quot;Fraggle Rock: The Animated Series&quot;. It was released on September 25, 2018.

==Spin-offs==
===Animated series===

An animated &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; series aired for one season on NBC&#x27;s Saturday morning lineup in 1987. The cartoon series introduced some Fraggles, Doozers, and other cave creatures exclusive to the series.

===&quot;A Muppet Family Christmas&quot;===

Doc, Sprocket the Dog, Gobo Fraggle, Wembley Fraggle, Boober Fraggle, Mokey Fraggle, Red Fraggle, and Uncle Traveling Matt appear in &quot;A Muppet Family Christmas&quot;. Doc and Sprocket rent the farmhouse of Fozzie Bear&#x27;s mother while she plans to go to Malibu until Fozzie shows up with his friends. Doc and Sprocket end up adjusting to the Muppets and the characters from &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Kermit the Frog and his nephew Robin find a Fraggle hole in the basement and enter Fraggle Rock where they encounter the five main Fraggles. Large Marvin Fraggle and other background Fraggles make appearances as well. During the finale, the five Fraggles come up where Uncle Traveling Matt is seen sitting near Doc and Sprocket. In the final scenes, Jim Henson washes the dishes while Sprocket dries them.

===&quot;The Doozers&quot;===

In 2012, The Jim Henson Company and DHX Media announced a computer-animated spin-off to Fraggle Rock, titled &quot;The Doozers&quot;, targeted at children between ages 4 and 7. It focuses on four young Doozers named Spike, Mollybolt, Flex and Daisy Wheel, who live at Doozer Creek.

The series began airing on Hulu on April 25, 2014.

===Canceled feature film===
In September 2005, The Jim Henson Company announced it was working on a film adaptation of &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, known as &quot;Fraggle Rock: The Movie&quot;, with the aim of a release in 2009. The story allegedly involves the original Fraggle characters.

In October 2006, Darkhorizons.com reported &quot;Henson&#x27;s company has hired executive producer Ahmet Zappa (&quot;The Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless&quot;) to write a treatment for the film which will be a full-length live-action musical fantasy starring the underground dwellers who venture out into the human world. Henson Co. co-topper Lisa Henson is producing, whilst Brian Henson will exec produce.&quot;

In May 2008, The Weinstein Company announced it would distribute the &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; movie. The film was written as a live-action musical by Cory Edwards, who would also direct. The film was to be produced by The Jim Henson Company; Ahmet Zappa was executive producing along with Brian Inerfeld. The film would involve all of the core characters from the series. The story would take the characters &quot;outside of their home in Fraggle Rock, where they interact with humans, which they think are aliens.&quot; Karen Prell and Dave Goelz were slated to return for the film as Red Fraggle, Boober Fraggle, and Uncle Traveling Matt, respectively.

In 2011, Weinstein&#x27;s deal with Henson expired, leaving the production of the film in doubt. The Scissor Sisters were announced to write music for the film. In October 2011, New Regency acquired the rights to the movie to be produced by The Jim Henson Company and The Montecito Picture Company, with 20th Century Fox distributing. New Regency and the producers were in discussion of whether to use puppets or CGI as well as a mix of live-action. Once this has been decided, it will look to a writer for the movie.

In 2012, James Byrkit and Alex Manugian were announced as screenwriters.

In March 2015, &quot;Variety&quot; said Joseph Gordon-Levitt would star in and produce the film. On July 28, 2018, Gordon-Levitt revealed that the film is still in early stages of development.

In December 2017, The Walt Disney Company (the current owners of The Muppets) announced that it would acquire 21st Century Fox, including 20th Century Fox. The acquisition was completed in March 2019, thus granting Disney the distribution rights to the film.

The feature film project was subsequently canceled in favor of a new television series.

===&quot;Fraggle Rock: Rock On!&quot;===
&quot;Fraggle Rock: Rock On!&quot; is a series of weekly live-action shorts, first broadcast on the Apple TV+ streaming service starting on April 21, 2020. Episodes follow the Fraggles living in separate caves during a period of social distancing, and interacting with each other using a video chat system that was installed by the Doozers. Footage for the series is shot using smartphones in the production teams&#x27; and artists&#x27; own homes. A total of six episodes have aired. Original cast members Karen Prell and Dave Goelz reprise their roles as Red Fraggle, and the voices of Boober Fraggle and Uncle Traveling Matt (they were puppeteered by John Tartaglia, who also performs Gobo Fraggle and puppeteers Wembley Fraggle). Other cast members include Donna Kimball as Mokey Fraggle and Frankie Cordero as the voice of Wembley.

===&quot;Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock&quot;===

In January 2021, The Jim Henson Company announced that production officially started on a reboot of the show, titled &quot;Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock&quot;. This new show is distinct from the &quot;Fraggle Rock: Rock On!&quot; shorts that were released in April 2020, and consists of full-length episodes. The show would be produced at the Calgary Film Centre. The series was released on January 21, 2022. Most of the cast from &quot;Fraggle Rock: Rock On&quot; returns for the series, with the exceptions of Wembley Fraggle, now performed by Jordan Lockhart, and Boober Fraggle and Uncle Traveling Matt, puppeteered by Frank Meschkuleit and Kevin Clash, respectively (Dave Goelz still provides their voices).

==Music==
Music played a central part in &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;. Every episode featured two or three original songs co-written by Canadian poet Dennis Lee and Philip Balsam, as well as incidental music. Several episodes (usually involving Cantus and the Minstrels) focused primarily on music—such as Red Fraggle&#x27;s attempt to find &quot;her song&quot; for the Fraggle Medley, or the effect of music on the breaking of winter or the presence of light in Fraggle Rock.

During the show&#x27;s original run, a re-recorded, extended version of its opening theme was released as a single that reached number 33 on the British chart in March 1984. Writers included Jim Henson, Jerry Juhl, and Jocelyn Stevenson, with songs by Philip Balsam and Dennis Lee, with lyric contributions to several songs by bpNichol.

===Album releases===
KOCH Records released &quot;Fraggle Rockin&#x27;: A Collection&quot;, a three-disc box set of &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; music, on October 30, 2007. The collection featured &quot;restored and remastered&quot; versions of three original &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; LPs. The collection also included &quot;special liner notes featuring rarely seen photos, contributions from the original composers and even sheet music for select songs&quot;. The main portion of these liner notes, called &quot;Getting Down at Fraggle Rock&quot;, features an interview with Philip Balsam and Lawrence S. Mirkin and is written by Mike Petersen and Saul Pincus.

===Comics===
The Star Comics imprint of Marvel Comics published two separate &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; comic-book series in 1985 and 1988 respectively. Originally, the first series was to be drawn by Marty Taras, the creator of Baby Huey, and the cover of the first published issue of the &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; comic is done by him. Also, at least one penciled page of his Fraggle work for that first issue has been preserved in print. However the art assignment for the series finally went to Marie Severin, who illustrated all eight-issue interiors and the other seven covers. The second series lasted six issues.

In early 2010, Archaia Studios Press published its first three-issue series of &quot;Fraggle Rock.&quot; A second three-issue series was followed in January 2011. Both series were collected into hardcover editions shortly after their respective publications. A four-issue miniseries &quot;Fraggle Rock: Journey to the Everspring&quot; was published in 2014. A third three-issue miniseries was published in 2018.

===Other televised appearances===
* Before its background appearance on Fraggle Rock, Food (a small, brown, alien creature) first appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; during &quot;The Land of Gorch&quot; sketch. It was later recycled as Zsa Zsa Porkmustard in the &quot;Science Fiction&quot; episode of &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot; as well as an undersea creature cameo in the &quot;Aquatic Life&quot; episode.
* Uncle Traveling Matt appears in &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;, seated in Piggy&#x27;s wedding party during the play where he is in the same section as the bears that Fozzie Bear was hibernating with.
* There was a special featuring the Fraggles called &quot;Fraggles Look for Jobs&quot; which details the Fraggles after the show had ended. Gobo has secured a singing job billed as &quot;Gobo the Frosty Fraggle&quot;, Wembley has no immediate plans except to stop wearing banana tree shirts, Mokey is writing a screenplay called &quot;Girls of the Sixties&quot;, and Red has signed a contract to play hockey for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Boober spends most of the video on the phone (with Bernie and others) hoping to find another acting job, preferably as a romantic lead. Two clips from this have been shown on The Jim Henson Company&#x27;s YouTube page.
* A prototype version of Blustering Bellowpane Monster appeared in the Play-Along Video film &quot;Neat Stuff: To Know &amp; To Do&quot; as Mergie (performed by Camille Bonora).
* Mama Tree Bird and Baby Tree Bird appeared in &quot;The Ghost of Faffner Hall&quot;.
* The Rumble Bugs made background cameos in &quot;The Song of the Cloud Forest&quot;.
* Gobo Fraggle, Mokey Fraggle, and Wembley Fraggle made a cameo appearance in &quot;The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson&quot; alongside the other Muppets and characters from &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in the &quot;Just One Person&quot; tribute song to Jim Henson.
* The puppets for Sprocket the Dog, Begoony, Mudwell the Mudbunny, Murray the Minstrel, Aretha, Wander McMooch, Brool the Minstrel, and the Inkspots make cameo appearances in &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot;. Begooney was shown as the child of the characters depicted by Mudwell and Murray. Sprocket was seen in a crowd cameo. The Inkspots (performed by Jerry Nelson and Steve Whitmire) were seen in the house windows and one of them was seen near a mud puddle during the song &quot;Scrooge&quot; while sitting next to the Porcupine from &quot;Billy Bunny&#x27;s Animal Songs&quot;. Aretha (performed by Karen Prell) appears in a crowd chorus where she has a line in the song with a Pig Businessman and the Blue Frackle. Wander McMooch (performed by David Rudman) and Brool the Minstrel (performed by Louise Gold) make cameo appearances as one of the guests at Fred&#x27;s party.
* Mudwell the Mudbunny, Begoony, Murray the Minstrel, Brool the Minstrel, Wander McMooch, Inkspots, Aretha, Baby Tree Creature, Mama Tree Creature, Papa Tree Creature and Blustering Bellowpane Monster appears in &quot;Muppet Classic Theater&quot;.

<doc id="88572" wikidata="Q305889" url="?curid=88572" title="IBook">
<text>iBook is a line of laptop computers designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer from 1999 to 2006. The line targeted entry-level, consumer and education markets, with lower specifications and prices than the PowerBook, Apple&#x27;s higher-end line of laptop computers. It was the first mass consumer product to offer Wi-Fi network connectivity, which was then branded by Apple as AirPort.

The iBook had three different designs during its lifetime. The first, known as the &quot;Clamshell&quot;, was inspired by the design of Apple&#x27;s popular iMac line at the time. It was a significant departure from previous portable computer designs due to its shape, bright colors, incorporation of a handle into the casing, lack of a display closing latch, lack of a hinged cover over the external ports and built-in wireless networking. Two years later, the second generation abandoned the original form factor in favor of a more conventional, rectangular design. In October 2003, the third generation was introduced, adding a PowerPC G4 chip, USB 2.0 and a slot-loading drive. iBooks were very popular in education, with Henrico County Public Schools being the first of many school systems in the United States to distribute one to every student.

Apple replaced the iBook line with the MacBook in May 2006 during the Mac transition to Intel processors.

== iBook G3 (&quot;Clamshell&quot;) ==
In the late 1990s, Apple was trimming its product line from the large number of intersecting Performa, Quadra, LC, Power Macintosh and PowerBook models to a simplified &quot;four box&quot; strategy: desktop and portable computers, each in both consumer and professional models. Three boxes of this strategy were already in place: The newly introduced iMac was the consumer desktop, the Power Macintosh G3 filled the professional desktop box, and the PowerBook G3 line served as the professional portable line. This left only the consumer portable space empty, leading to much rumor on the Internet of potential designs and features. Putting an end to this speculation, on July 21, 1999, Steve Jobs unveiled the iBook G3 during the keynote presentation of Macworld Conference &amp; Expo, New York City.

Like the iMac, the iBook G3 had a PowerPC G3 CPU, and no legacy Apple interfaces. USB, Ethernet, modem ports and an optical drive were standard. The ports were left uncovered along the left side, as a cover was thought to be fragile and unnecessary with the iBook&#x27;s new interfaces, which lacked the exposed pins of earlier connectors. Featuring a clamshell design, when the lid was closed, the hinge kept it firmly shut, so there was no need for a latch on the screen. The hinge included an integrated carrying handle. Additional power connectors on the bottom surface allowed multiple iBook G3s to be charged on a custom-made rack. The iBook G3 was the first Mac to use Apple&#x27;s new &quot;Unified Logic Board Architecture&quot;, which condensed all of the machine&#x27;s core features into two chips, and added AGP and Ultra DMA support.

The iBook was the first mainstream computer designed and sold with integrated wireless networking. On the iBook&#x27;s introduction, Phil Schiller, Apple&#x27;s VP of Marketing, held an iBook while jumping off a height as data from the computer was transferred to another in order to demonstrate the wireless networking capability. The display bezel contained the wireless antenna, which attached to an optional internal wireless card. Lucent Technologies helped create this wireless capability which established the industry standard. Apple released the AirPort Wireless Base Station at the same time.

There was heated debate over many things such as the aesthetics, features, weight, performance and pricing. To provide sufficient impact protection, the iBook was larger and heftier than the PowerBook of the time, and yet had lower specifications. Standard features like PC card slots were absent, and so were speculated features such as touch screens and an ultra-long battery life. The iBook gained the label &quot;Barbie&#x27;s toilet seat&quot;, due to the distinctive design. Nevertheless, this same design made the iBook G3 unmistakable in movies and television shows.

The iBook was a commercial success. The line continually received processor, memory, hard disk upgrades and new colors. FireWire and video out were later added. The design was discontinued in May 2001, in favor of the new &quot;Dual USB&quot; iBooks.

=== Design ===
The design was clearly influenced by Apple&#x27;s consumer desktop, the iMac. In fact, one of the marketing slogans for the iBook was &quot;iMac to go.&quot; The clamshell design also echoed the eMate 300. Apple continued its trend of using transparent colored plastics for the shell, and released the iBook clamshell series in several colors, starting with Blueberry and Tangerine, later adding Indigo, Graphite and Key Lime colors. However, unlike the iMac, the iBook did not feature pinstripes. Steve Jobs announced that the Key Lime color, &quot;a little less conservative, a little more fun&quot;, was exclusive to the online Apple Store. This resulted in some crowd members booing, to which Jobs replied: &quot;Don&#x27;t you like buying on the Apple Online Store?&quot;

Compared to follow-up iBook and PowerBook notebook computers, the Clamshell iBook proved to be the more reliable model. The original iBook is on exhibition at the London Design Museum and the Yale University Art Gallery. Vestiges of design ideas first adopted in the iBook G3 can still be seen today: moving interface ports from the back to the sides and leaving them uncovered, omitting a latch for the computer&#x27;s lid, and providing multiple color options.

=== Technical specifications ===

=== Expandability and upgrades ===
The original iBook&#x27;s only customer-serviceable parts were the RAM and AirPort card, accessed via two slots under the keyboard. No other modifications were possible in-warranty. There was no PCMCIA port for additional expansion capabilities. 40 screws needed to be removed to access the hard drive. The optical drive, however, can be accessed far more easily, requiring only 11 screws and one standoff to be removed. Later on, some users transplanted a 1024×768 LCD from the more recent white iBook into a clamshell iBook. This is only possible with the &quot;FireWire&quot; and &quot;FireWire SE&quot; models, as they have 8 MB of video RAM; the older ones only have 4 MB.

All clamshell iBooks shipped with Mac OS 8.6 or 9.0. All clamshell iBooks supported Mac OS X 10.0 through 10.3.9. Mac OS X Tiger (v10.4) can also be installed.

== iBook G3 Dual USB (&quot;Snow&quot;) ==
Apple debuted the next-generation iBook G3 at a press conference in Cupertino, California, on May 1, 2001. The previous bold colors and bulky form-factor were abandoned, as were the handle, latch-less design and additional power connectors on the bottom surface.

The resulting iBook was available in white only, hence the name &quot;Snow&quot; and incorporated transparent polycarbonate in its casing. It was 30% lighter, and occupied less than half of the volume of the model it replaced, being smaller in all three dimensions. Despite that, it added an extra USB port and a higher resolution screen. Apple claimed the compact design did not sacrifice durability, saying it was &quot;Twice as durable&quot; as the previous model. This is the model seen in the first iPod commercial.

With this revision, Apple began transitioning to translucent and white polycarbonate casings in most of its consumer line, such as the iMac and the eMac. In contrast, most of its professional products used an anodized aluminium finish. Near the end of its run, the Snow iBook G3 case became opaque and white instead of translucent white and magnesium.

=== Technical specifications ===


== iBook G4 ==
Apple added a PowerPC G4 chip to the iBook Snow design on October 23, 2003, finally ending Apple&#x27;s use of the PowerPC G3 chip. A slot-loading optical drive replaced the disc tray. The iBook G4 notebook also features an opaque white case finish and keyboard and a plastic display hinge. This is also the last iBook laptop released before MacBooks replaced the iBook line in 2006.

=== Technical specifications ===

== Supported operating systems ==
== Expandability and upgrades ==

The iBook keyboard lifts up, allowing installation of the AirPort (wireless) card and additional memory. This gives the keyboard a &quot;spongy&quot; effect, especially in G3 iBooks with the translucent keyboard. The &quot;sponginess&quot; was corrected in the PowerPC G4 models.

Accessing the hard disk drive is complex and time-consuming, involving partial disassembly of the unit and the removal of over 30 different-sized screws.

The memory in the iBook G4 is covered by a removable AirPort card, and accessible by removing the RAM shield with a Phillips screwdriver. While some of the earlier models (e.g., 800 MHz and 933 MHz) have a specified 640 MB RAM limit, it is possible to have a total of 1.12 GB of RAM installed (128 MB built-in, plus a 1 GB SO-DIMM), or 1.25 or 1.5 GB in the later models with 256 or 512 MB of RAM soldered to the logic board.

Although no longer officially supported by macOS versions beyond those given in the chart above, the system has also been supported via MorphOS (an Amiga compatible OS) since version 3.2.

== Notes ==
* A copy of &quot;Marble Blast Gold&quot; came preinstalled on a certain version of the iBook G4 as a promotion of the game.

== Quality issues ==
Display issues with the iBook line were caused by a notoriously problematic graphics chip, which could have issues with the heatsink or the BGA soldering work done at the factory. This would manifest in symptoms such as system lockups (as the graphics chip hangs from reaching the thermal limit), or visible graphical artifacts appearing on the screen (from the graphics chip failing).

Apple initiated the &quot;iBook Logic Board Repair Extension Program&quot; in January 2004, which covered the expense of repairing display problems of iBook G3 models for three years. In June 2004, the Repair Extension Program was expanded to cover all White G3 iBooks.

Early models of the iBook G4 also suffered from display problems similar to those of the iBook G3, but were not covered by the repair extension program. Owners of iBooks that required expensive repairs for these problems submitted new class action lawsuits in December 2006.

On May 2, 2007, the Danish Consumer Board published an extensive 3rd party report concerning the Apple iBook G4 logic board issue. A press release referred to the global consequences that this could have for possible guarantee claims.

Some owners of the iBooks that experienced this flaw solved these issues temporarily through applying pressure to the heatsink or graphics chip, using a thin metal shim placed between the heatsink and the graphics chip. This both pushed the heatsink and graphics chip together, bridging the thermal gap, and pushing the graphics chip against the motherboard, temporarily reheating the solder beads back together.

<doc id="88573" wikidata="Q864211" url="?curid=88573" title="Carter Doctrine">
<text>The Carter Doctrine was a policy proclaimed by United States president Jimmy Carter in his State of the Union Address on January 23, 1980, which stated that the U.S. would use military force, if necessary, to defend its national interests in the Persian Gulf. It was a response to the Soviet Union&#x27;s intervention in Afghanistan in 1979, and it was intended to deter the Soviet Union, the country&#x27;s Cold War adversary, from seeking hegemony in the Persian Gulf region.

The following key sentence, written by Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter&#x27;s National Security Adviser, concludes the section:

Let our position be absolutely clear: An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force.
Brzezinski modeled the wording on the Truman Doctrine, and insisted the sentence be included in the speech &quot;to make it very clear that the Soviets should stay away from the Persian Gulf.&quot;

In &quot;The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power&quot;, author Daniel Yergin notes that the Carter Doctrine &quot;bore striking similarities&quot; to a 1903 British declaration in which British Foreign Secretary Lord Lansdowne warned Russia and Germany that the British would &quot;regard the establishment of a naval base or of a fortified port in the Persian Gulf by any other power as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal.&quot;

==Background==

The Persian Gulf region was first proclaimed to be of national interest to the United States during World War II. Petroleum is centrally important to modern armies. The U.S., the world&#x27;s leading oil producer at the time, supplied most of the oil for the Allied armies. Many American strategists were concerned that the war would dangerously reduce the country&#x27;s oil supply and so they sought to establish good relations with Saudi Arabia, a kingdom with large oil reserves. On February 16, 1943, U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt stated that, &quot;the defense of Saudi Arabia is vital to the defense of the United States.&quot;

On February 14, 1945, while returning from the Yalta Conference, Roosevelt met with Saudi king Ibn Saud on the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal, the first time a U.S. president had visited the Persian Gulf. During Operation Desert Shield in 1990, U.S. defense secretary Dick Cheney cited the landmark meeting between Roosevelt and Ibn Saud as one of the justifications for sending troops to protect Saudi Arabia&#x27;s border.

In World War II, Britain and the Soviet Union had jointly invaded and partitioned Iran in 1941 which was to end with the conclusion of the war. However, Soviet-aligned rebellions, the Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government and Republic of Mahabad, created a crisis in the Allied occupation zone, the Iran crisis of 1946, which was one of the first struggles of the Cold War. U.S. pressure on the Soviets to withdraw from Iran was one of the first postwar conflicts between the two superpowers.

The Persian Gulf was still regarded as an area of vital importance to the U.S. during the Cold War. Three Cold War American presidential doctrines (the Truman, Eisenhower, and Nixon Doctrines) played roles in forming the Carter Doctrine. The Truman Doctrine, which stated that the U.S. would send military aid to countries threatened by Soviet aggression, was used to strengthen both Iran and Saudi Arabia&#x27;s security. In October 1950, President Harry S. Truman wrote to Ibn Saud that &quot;the United States is interested in the preservation of the independence and territorial integrity of Saudi Arabia. No threat to your Kingdom could occur which would not be a matter of immediate concern to the United States.&quot;

The Eisenhower Doctrine called for U.S. troops to be sent to the Middle East to defend American allies against their Soviet-backed adversaries. Ultimately, the Nixon Doctrine&#x27;s application provided military aid to Iran and Saudi Arabia so that U.S. allies could ensure peace and stability there. In 1979, the Iranian revolution and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted the restatement of U.S. interests in the region in the form of the Carter Doctrine. The Yemenite War of 1979, with Soviet support to South Yemen, may also have been a &quot;smaller shock&quot; contributing to the crisis of that year, and Carter&#x27;s foreign policy shift. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski advised Carter that the United States&#x27;s &quot;greatest vulnerability&quot; lay on an arc &quot;stretching from Chittagong through Islamabad to Aden.&quot; Henry Kissinger gave Carter similar advice.

In July 1979, responding to a national energy crisis that resulted from the Iranian revolution, Carter delivered his &quot;Crisis of Confidence&quot; speech, urging Americans to reduce their energy use to help lessen U.S. dependence on foreign oil supplies. In 2008, some scholars claimed that Carter&#x27;s energy plan, had it been fully enacted, would have prevented some of the economic difficulties caused by American dependency on foreign oil.

The 1979 oil crisis also led to a vast surge in energy wealth for the oil-rich Soviet Union, which along the lines of resource curse literature, has been hypothesized to have caused the boldness of the Soviet Politburo in the intervention in Afghanistan in the first place. Previously, the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;Third World&quot; strategy combined largely cautious support of revolutions with covert action. However, the invasion of Afghanistan indicated that Soviet policy had become more direct and belligerent. This was seen to advance a long-term Soviet geopolitical goal, the acquisition of strategic presence on the Indian Ocean, closer to the realm of possibility. This caused previous critics of containment policy to become some of its major supporters.

Over the course of January 1980 in response to the invasion, Carter withdrew the SALT II treaty from consideration before the Senate, recalled U.S. ambassador Thomas J. Watson from Moscow, curtailed grain sales to the Soviet Union, and suspended high-technology exports to the Soviet Union.

==Doctrine==
Carter, in his State of the Union Address on January 23, 1980, after stating that Soviet troops in Afghanistan posed &quot;a grave threat to the free movement of Middle East oil,&quot; proclaimed:

:The region which is now threatened by Soviet troops in Afghanistan is of great strategic importance: It contains more than two-thirds of the world&#x27;s exportable oil. The Soviet effort to dominate Afghanistan has brought Soviet military forces to within 300 miles of the Indian Ocean and close to the Straits of Hormuz, a waterway through which most of the world&#x27;s oil must flow. The Soviet Union is now attempting to consolidate a strategic position, therefore, that poses a grave threat to the free movement of Middle East oil.

: This situation demands careful thought, steady nerves, and resolute action, not only for this year but for many years to come. It demands collective efforts to meet this new threat to security in the Persian Gulf and in Southwest Asia. It demands the participation of all those who rely on oil from the Middle East and who are concerned with global peace and stability. And it demands consultation and close cooperation with countries in the area which might be threatened.

: Meeting this challenge will take national will, diplomatic and political wisdom, economic sacrifice, and, of course, military capability. We must call on the best that is in us to preserve the security of this crucial region.

: Let our position be absolutely clear: An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force.

==Implementation==
The Carter administration began to build up the Rapid Deployment Force, which would eventually become CENTCOM. In the interim, the administration asked Congress to restart Selective Service registration, proposed a five percent increase in military spending for each of the next five years, and expanded U.S. naval presence in the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean.

A negative response came from retired strategist and diplomat George F. Kennan. U.S. senator Ted Kennedy charged that Carter had overreacted, exaggerated the Soviet threat, and failed to act diplomatically. Kennedy repeated these allegations during his 1980 Democratic presidential primary bid, in which he was defeated.

Carter&#x27;s successor, Ronald Reagan, extended the policy in October 1981 with what is sometimes called the &quot;Reagan Corollary to the Carter Doctrine,&quot; which proclaimed that the United States would intervene to protect Saudi Arabia, whose security was believed to be threatened during the Iran–Iraq War. Thus, while the Carter Doctrine warned away &quot;outside&quot; forces from the region, the Reagan Corollary pledged to secure &quot;internal&quot; stability. According to diplomat Howard Teicher, &quot;with the enunciation of the Reagan Corollary, the policy groundwork was laid for Operation Desert Storm.&quot;

<text>The Reagan Doctrine was a United States foreign policy strategy implemented by the administration of President Ronald Reagan to overwhelm the global influence of the Soviet Union in the late Cold War. As stated by Reagan in his State of the Union Address on February 6, 1985: &quot;We must not break faith with those who are risking their lives—on every continent from Afghanistan to Nicaragua—to defy Soviet-supported aggression and secure rights which have been ours from birth.&quot; The doctrine was a centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy from the early 1980s until the end of the Cold War in 1991.

Under the Reagan Doctrine, the United States provided overt and covert aid to anti-communist guerrillas and resistance movements in an effort to &quot;roll back&quot; Soviet-backed pro-communist governments in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The doctrine was designed to diminish Soviet influence in these regions as part of the administration&#x27;s overall strategy to win the Cold War.

==Background==
The Reagan Doctrine followed in the tradition of U.S. presidents developing foreign policy &quot;doctrines&quot;, which were designed to reflect challenges facing international relations, and to propose foreign policy solutions. The practice began with the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, and continued with the Roosevelt Corollary, sometimes called the Roosevelt Doctrine, introduced by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1904.

The post–World War II tradition of presidential doctrines started with the Truman Doctrine in 1947, under which the U.S. provided support to the governments of Greece and Turkey as part of a Cold War strategy to keep both nations out of the Soviet sphere of influence. It was followed by the Eisenhower Doctrine, the Kennedy Doctrine, the Johnson Doctrine, the Nixon Doctrine, and the Carter Doctrine, all of which defined the foreign policy approaches of these respective U.S. presidents on some of the largest global challenges of their presidencies.

==Origins==
===Carter administration and Afghanistan===

At least one component of the Reagan Doctrine technically pre-dated the administration. In Afghanistan, the Carter administration began providing limited covert military assistance to the Afghan &quot;mujahideen&quot; in an effort to drive the Soviets out of the country, or at least raise the military and political cost of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. The policy of aiding the &quot;mujahideen&quot; in their war against the Soviet occupation was originally proposed by Carter&#x27;s National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski and was implemented by U.S. intelligence services. It enjoyed broad bipartisan political support.

Democratic congressman Charlie Wilson became obsessed with the Afghan cause, and was able to leverage his position on the House Appropriations committees to encourage other Democratic congressmen to vote for CIA Afghan war money, with the tacit approval of Speaker of the House Tip O&#x27;Neill, even as the Democratic Party lambasted Reagan for the CIA&#x27;s secret war in Central America. It was a complex web of relationships described in George Crile III&#x27;s book &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot;.

Wilson teamed with CIA manager Gust Avrakotos and formed a team of a few dozen insiders who greatly enhanced the support for the &quot;mujahideen&quot;, funneling it through Pakistani president Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s ISI. Avrakotos and Wilson charmed leaders from various anti-Soviet countries including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and China to increase support for the rebels. Avrakotos hired Michael G. Vickers, a young paramilitary officer, to enhance the guerilla&#x27;s odds by revamping the tactics, weapons, logistics, and training used by the &quot;mujahideen&quot;. Michael Pillsbury, a Pentagon official, and Vincent Cannistraro pushed the CIA to supply Stinger missiles to the rebels. Reagan&#x27;s covert action program has been given credit for assisting in ending the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

==Origin and advocates==
With the arrival of the Reagan administration, The Heritage Foundation and other conservative foreign policy think tanks saw a political opportunity to significantly expand Carter&#x27;s Afghanistan policy into a more global &quot;doctrine&quot;, including U.S. support to anti-communist resistance movements in Soviet-allied nations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. According to political analysts Thomas Bodenheimer and Robert Gould, &quot;it was the Heritage Foundation that translated theory into concrete policy. Heritage targeted nine nations for regime change: Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Iran, Laos, Libya, Nicaragua, and Vietnam&quot;.

Throughout the 1980s, The Heritage Foundation&#x27;s foreign policy expert on the Third World, Michael Johns, the foundation&#x27;s principal Reagan Doctrine advocate, visited with resistance movements in Angola, Cambodia, Nicaragua, and other Soviet-supported nations and urged the Reagan administration to initiate or expand military and political support to them. Heritage Foundation foreign policy experts also endorsed the Reagan Doctrine in two of their &quot;Mandate for Leadership&quot; books, which provided comprehensive policy advice to Reagan administration officials.

In fact, the doctrine only applied to Afghanistan, Cambodia, Angola, Nicaragua, and Mozambique, while Afghanistan was the centerpiece of the doctrine.

The result was that, unlike in Afghanistan, the Reagan Doctrine was rather quickly applied in Angola and Nicaragua, with the United States providing military support to the UNITA movement in Angola and the &quot;Contras&quot; in Nicaragua, but without a declaration of war against either country. Addressing The Heritage Foundation in October 1989, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi called the efforts &quot;a source of great support. No Angolan will forget your efforts. You have come to Jamba, and you have taken our message to Congress and the Administration&quot;. U.S. aid to UNITA began to flow overtly after Congress repealed the Clark Amendment, a long-standing legislative prohibition on military aid to UNITA.

Following these victories, Johns and The Heritage Foundation urged further expanding the Reagan Doctrine to Ethiopia, where they argued that the Ethiopian famine was a product of the military and agricultural policies of Ethiopia&#x27;s Soviet-supported government under Mengistu Haile Mariam. Johns and Heritage also argued that Mengistu&#x27;s decision to permit Soviet naval and air presence on the Red Sea ports of Eritrea represented a strategic challenge to U.S. security interests in the Middle East and North Africa.

The Heritage Foundation and the Reagan administration also sought to apply the Reagan Doctrine in Cambodia. The largest resistance movement fighting Cambodia&#x27;s communist government was largely made up of members of the former Khmer Rouge regime, whose human rights record was among the worst of the 20th century. Therefore, Reagan authorized the provision of aid to a smaller Cambodian resistance movement, a coalition called the Khmer People&#x27;s National Liberation Front, known as the KPNLF and then run by Son Sann; in an effort to force an end to the Vietnamese occupation.

While the Reagan Doctrine enjoyed strong support from The Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute, the libertarian-oriented Cato Institute opposed the Reagan Doctrine, arguing in 1986 that &quot;most Third World struggles take place in arenas and involve issues far removed from legitimate American security needs. U.S. involvement in such conflicts expands the republic&#x27;s already overextended commitments without achieving any significant prospective gains. Instead of draining Soviet military and financial resources, we end up dissipating our own.&quot;

Even Cato, however, conceded that the Reagan Doctrine had &quot;fired the enthusiasm of the conservative movement in the United States as no foreign policy issue has done in decades&quot;. While opposing the Reagan Doctrine as an official governmental policy, Cato instead urged Congress to remove the legal barriers prohibiting private organizations and citizens from supporting these resistance movements.

===Advocates within the Reagan administration===
Within the Reagan administration, the doctrine was quickly embraced by nearly all of Reagan&#x27;s top national security and foreign policy officials, including Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, UN Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, and a series of National Security Advisors appointed by Reagan including John Poindexter, Frank Carlucci, and Colin Powell.

Reagan himself was a vocal proponent of the policy. Seeking to expand congressional support for the doctrine in his 1985 State of the Union Address in February 1985, Reagan said: &quot;We must not break faith with those who are risking their lives ... on every continent, from Afghanistan to Nicaragua ... to defy Soviet aggression and secure rights which have been ours from birth. Support for freedom fighters is self-defense&quot;.

As part of his effort to gain congressional support for the Nicaraguan Contras, Reagan labeled the Contras &quot;the moral equivalent of our founding fathers&quot;, which was controversial because the Contras had shown disregard for human rights. There also were allegations that some members of the Contra leadership were involved in cocaine trafficking.

Reagan and other conservative advocates of the Reagan Doctrine advocates also argued that the doctrine served U.S. foreign policy and strategic objectives and was a moral imperative against the Soviet Union, which Reagan, his advisers, and supporters labeled an &quot;evil empire&quot;.

===Other advocates===
Other early conservative advocates for the Reagan Doctrine included influential activist Grover Norquist, who ultimately became a registered UNITA lobbyist and an economic adviser to Savimbi&#x27;s UNITA movement in Angola, and former Reagan speechwriter and former U.S. congressman Dana Rohrabacher, who made several secret visits with the &quot;mujahideen&quot; in Afghanistan and returned with glowing reports of their bravery against the Soviet occupation. Rohrabacher was led to Afghanistan by his contact with the &quot;mujahideen&quot;, Jack Wheeler.

===Origin of the phrase===
In 1985, as U.S. support was flowing to the &quot;mujahideen&quot;, Savimbi&#x27;s UNITA, and the Nicaraguan Contras, columnist Charles Krauthammer, in an essay for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, labeled the policy the &quot;Reagan Doctrine,&quot; and the name stuck.

Krauthammer has said of his writing in support of the Reagan Doctrine,

===&quot;Rollback&quot; replaces &quot;containment&quot; and &quot;détente&quot;===

The Reagan Doctrine was especially significant because it represented a substantial shift in the post–World War II foreign policy of the United States. Prior to the Reagan Doctrine, U.S. foreign policy in the Cold War was rooted in &quot;containment&quot;, as originally defined by George F. Kennan, John Foster Dulles, and other post–World War II U.S. foreign policy experts. In January 1977, four years prior to becoming president, Reagan bluntly stated, in a conversation with National Security Advisor Richard V. Allen, his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War. &quot;My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic,&quot; he said. &quot;It is this: We win and they lose. What do you think of that?&quot;

Although a similar policy of &quot;rollback&quot; had been considered on a few occasions during the Cold War, the U.S., fearing an escalation of the Cold War and possible nuclear conflict, chose not to confront the Soviet Union directly. With the Reagan Doctrine, those fears were set aside and the United States began to openly confront Soviet-supported governments through support of rebel movements in the doctrine&#x27;s targeted countries.

One perceived benefit of the Reagan Doctrine was the relatively low cost of supporting guerrilla forces compared to the Soviet Union&#x27;s expenses in propping up client states. Another benefit was the lack of direct involvement of American troops, which allowed the United States to confront Soviet allies without sustaining casualties. Especially since the September 11 attacks, some Reagan Doctrine critics have argued that, by facilitating the transfer of large amounts of weapons to various areas of the world and by training military leaders in these regions, the Reagan Doctrine actually contributed to &quot;blowback&quot; by strengthening some political and military movements that ultimately developed hostility toward the U.S., such as al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. However, no direct U.S. aid to Osama bin Laden or any of his affiliates has ever been established.

===Controversy over Nicaragua===

Historian Greg Grandin described a disjuncture between official ideals preached by the United States and actual U.S. support for terrorism. &quot;Nicaragua, where the United States backed not a counter insurgent state but anti-communist mercenaries, likewise represented a disjuncture between the idealism used to justify U.S. policy and its support for political terrorism. ... The corollary to the idealism embraced by the Republicans in the realm of diplomatic public policy debate was thus political terror. In the dirtiest of Latin America&#x27;s dirty wars, their faith in America&#x27;s mission justified atrocities in the name of liberty&quot;. Grandin examined the behaviour of the U.S.-backed Contras and found evidence that it was particularly inhumane and vicious: &quot;In Nicaragua, the U.S.-backed Contras decapitated, castrated, and otherwise mutilated civilians and foreign aid workers. Some earned a reputation for using spoons to gouge their victims&#x27; eyes out. In one raid, Contras cut the breasts of a civilian defender to pieces and ripped the flesh off the bones of another.&quot;

Professor Frederick H. Gareau has written that the Contras &quot;attacked bridges, electric generators, but also state-owned agricultural cooperatives, rural health clinics, villages, and non-combatants&quot;. U.S. agents were directly involved in the fighting. &quot;CIA commandos launched a series of sabotage raids on Nicaraguan port facilities. They mined the country&#x27;s major ports and set fire to its largest oil storage facilities.&quot; In 1984, Congress ordered this intervention to be stopped; however, it was later shown that the Reagan administration illegally continued (see Iran–Contra affair). Gareau has characterized these acts as &quot;wholesale terrorism&quot; by the United States.

A CIA manual for training the Contras in psychological operations, leaked to the media in 1984, entitled &quot;Psychological Operations in Guerrilla War&quot;. recommended &quot;selective use of violence for propagandistic effects&quot; and to &quot;neutralize&quot; government officials. Contras were taught to lead:

Similarly, former diplomat Clara Nieto, in her book &quot;Masters of War&quot;, charged that &quot;the CIA launched a series of terrorist actions from the &quot;mothership&quot; off Nicaragua&#x27;s coast. In September 1983, she charged the agency attacked Puerto Sandino, Nicaragua&#x27;s largest port, with rockets. The following month, frogmen blew up the underwater oil pipeline in the same port – the only one in the country. In October there was an attack on Puerto Corinto with mortars, rockets, and grenades blowing up five large oil and gasoline storage tanks. More than a hundred people were wounded, and the fierce fire, which could not be brought under control for two days, forced the evacuation of 23,000 people.&quot;

The International Court of Justice, when judging the case of &quot;Nicaragua v. United States&quot; in 1984, found that the United States was obligated to pay reparations to Nicaragua, because it had violated international law by actively supporting the Contras in their rebellion and by mining the Naval waters of Nicaragua. The U.S. refused to participate in the proceedings after the Court rejected its argument that the ICJ lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The U.S. later blocked the enforcement of the judgment by exercising its veto power in the United Nations Security Council and so prevented Nicaragua from obtaining any actual compensation.

===Covert implementation===
As the Reagan administration set about implementing The Heritage Foundation&#x27;s plan in Afghanistan, Angola, and Nicaragua, it first attempted to do so covertly, not as part of official policy. &quot;The Reagan government&#x27;s initial implementation of the Heritage plan was done covertly&quot;, according to the book &quot;Rollback&quot;, &quot;following the longstanding custom that containment can be overt but rollback should be covert&quot;. Ultimately, however, the administration supported the policy more openly.

===Congressional support===
While the doctrine benefited from strong support from the Reagan administration, The Heritage Foundation and several influential members of Congress, many votes on critical funding for resistance movements, especially the Nicaraguan Contras, were extremely close, making the Reagan Doctrine one of the more contentious American political issues of the 1980s.

===End of the Cold War===
As arms flowed to the contras, Savimbi&#x27;s UNITA and the &quot;mujahideen&quot;, advocates of the Reagan Doctrine argued that the doctrine was yielding constructive results for U.S. interests and global democracy.

In Nicaragua, pressure from the Contras led the Sandinstas to end the State of Emergency, and they subsequently lost the 1990 elections. In Afghanistan, the &quot;mujahideen&quot; bled the Soviet Union&#x27;s military and paved the way for Soviet military defeat. In Angola, Savimbi&#x27;s resistance ultimately led to a decision by the Soviet Union and Cuba to bring their troops and military advisors home from Angola as part of a negotiated settlement.

All of these developments were Reagan Doctrine victories, the doctrine&#x27;s advocates argue, laying the ground for the ultimate dissolution of the Soviet Union. Johns later argued that &quot;the Reagan-led effort to support freedom fighters resisting Soviet oppression led successfully to the first major military defeat of the Soviet Union ... Sending the Red Army packing from Afghanistan proved one of the single most important contributing factors in one of history&#x27;s most profoundly positive and important developments&quot;.

===Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s view===
Among others, Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990, credited the Reagan Doctrine with aiding the end of the Cold War. In December 1997, Thatcher said that the Reagan Doctrine &quot;proclaimed that the truce with communism was over. The West would henceforth regard no area of the world as destined to forego its liberty simply because the Soviets claimed it to be within their sphere of influence. We would fight a battle of ideas against communism, and we would give material support to those who fought to recover their nations from tyranny&quot;.

===Iran–Contra affair===
U.S. funding for the Contras, who opposed the Sandinista government of Nicaragua, was obtained from covert sources. Congress did not authorize sufficient funds for the Contras&#x27; efforts, and the Boland Amendment barred further funding. In 1986, in an episode that became known as the Iran–Contra affair, the Reagan administration illegally facilitated the sale of arms to Iran, the subject of an arms embargo, in the hope that the arms sales would secure the release of hostages and allow U.S. intelligence agencies to fund the Contras.

==End==
The Reagan Doctrine continued into the administration of Reagan&#x27;s successor, George H. W. Bush, who won the presidency in November 1988. Bush&#x27;s presidency featured the final years of the Cold War and the Gulf War, but the Reagan Doctrine soon faded from U.S. policy as the Cold War ended. Bush also noted a presumed peace dividend to the end of the Cold War with economic benefits of a decrease in defense spending. However, following the presidency of Bill Clinton, a change in United States foreign policy was introduced with the presidency of his son George W. Bush and the new Bush Doctrine, who increased military spending in response to the September 11 attacks.

In Nicaragua, the Contra War ended after the Sandinista government, facing military and political pressure, agreed to new elections, in which the contras&#x27; political wing participated, in 1990. In Angola, an agreement in 1989 met Savimbi&#x27;s demand for the removal of Soviet, Cuban, and other military troops and advisors from Angola. Also in 1989, in relation to Afghanistan, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev labeled the war against the U.S.-supported &quot;mujahideen&quot; a &quot;bleeding wound&quot; and ended the Soviet occupation of the country.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot;, a Golden Globe Award and Oscar-nominated Universal Pictures film released in December 2007, depicts early U.S. efforts to provide military support to the Afghan &quot;mujahideen&quot; following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
* &quot;Miami&quot;, a 1987 book by Joan Didion covers U.S. efforts to overthrow communist governments, including that of Fidel Castro in Cuba.

<doc id="88580" wikidata="Q45556" url="?curid=88580" title="Boidae">
<text>The Boidae, commonly known as boas or boids, are a family of nonvenomous snakes primarily found in the Americas, as well as Africa, Europe, Asia, and some Pacific islands. Boas include some of the world&#x27;s largest snakes, with the green anaconda of South America being the heaviest and second-longest snake known; in general, adults are medium to large in size, with females usually larger than the males. Six subfamilies comprising 15 genera and 54 species are currently recognized.

==Description==
Like the pythons, boas have elongated supratemporal bones. The quadrate bones are also elongated, but not as much, while both are capable of moving freely so when they swing sideways to their maximum extent, the distance between the hinges of the lower jaw is greatly increased.

 Both families share a number of primitive characteristics. Nearly all have a relatively rigid lower jaw with a coronoid element, as well as a vestigial pelvic girdle with hind limbs that are partially visible as a pair of spurs, one on either side of the vent. In males, these anal spurs are larger and more conspicuous than in females. A long row of palatal teeth is present, and most species have a functional left lung that can be up to 75% as large as the right lung.

Boids are, however, distinguished from the pythons in that none has postfrontal bones or premaxillary teeth, and that they give birth to live young. When labial pits are present, these are located between the scales as opposed to on them. Also, their geographical distributions are almost entirely mutually exclusive. In the few areas where they do coexist, the tendency is for them to occupy different habitats.
Formerly, boas were said to be found in the New World and pythons in the Old World. While this is true of boine boas, other boid species are present in Africa, much of southern Eurasia, Madagascar, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands, so this is not accurate. However, they seem more abundant in evolutionarily isolated areas. South America was isolated until a few million years ago, with a fauna that included marsupials and other distinctive mammals. With the formation of the Panamanian land bridge to North America about three million years ago, boines have migrated north as colubrids (and various Nearctic mammals) have migrated south, as part of the Great American Interchange.

==Distribution and habitat==
Most species are found in North, Central, and South America, as well as the Caribbean, while a few are found in southeastern Europe and Asia Minor, North, Central and East Africa, Madagascar, the Arabian Peninsula, Central and Southwestern Asia, India and Sri Lanka, Indonesian islands (Moluccas, West Papua, Talaud, Sulawesi) and Papua New Guinea through Melanesia and Samoa.

==Feeding==
Prey is killed by constriction; after an animal has been grasped to restrain it, a number of coils are hastily wrapped around it. Then, by applying and maintaining sufficient pressure, the snake prevents its prey from inhaling, so that it eventually succumbs to asphyxiation. Recently, the pressures produced during constriction have been suggested as the cause of cardiac arrest by interfering with blood flow, but this hypothesis has not yet been confirmed.

Larger specimens usually eat animals about the size of a domestic cat, but larger food items are not unknown: the diet of the green anaconda (&quot;Eunectes murinus&quot;) is known to include subadult tapirs. Prey is swallowed whole, and may take several days or even weeks to fully digest. Despite their intimidating size and muscular power, they are generally not dangerous to humans.

Contrary to popular belief, even the larger species do not crush their prey to death; in fact, prey is not even noticeably deformed before it is swallowed. The speed with which the coils are applied is impressive and the force they exert may be significant, but death is caused by suffocation, with the victim not being able to move its ribs to breathe while it is being constricted.

==Reproduction==
Most species of boa are ovoviviparous, with females giving birth to live young. This is in contrast to the pythons, which lay eggs (oviparous).

==Subfamilies==

Type genus = &quot;Boa&quot; – Gray, 1825

==Taxonomy==
Pythons were historically classified as a subfamily of Boidae (called Pythoninae), but it was later determined that they are not closely related to boas despite having superficial similarities.

Almost all of the non-boine boids are frequently elevated to their own full families: Calabariidae/inae, Candoiidae/inae, Charinidae/inae, Erycidae/inae, Sanziniidae/inae, and Ungaliophiidae/inae. The taxonomy of boid snakes has been long debated, and ultimately the decision whether to assign a particular clade to a particular Linnaean rank (such as a superfamily, family, or subfamily) is arbitrary.

The subfamily Ungaliophiinae was formerly made up of four genera. Two of them (&quot;Tropidophis&quot; and &quot;Trachyboa&quot;) are actually more closely related to the American pipe snake (&quot;Anilius scytale&quot;) than to the boas, and are now placed in the family Tropidophiidae within the superfamily Amerophidia. The other two genera (&quot;Ungaliophis&quot; and &quot;Exiliboa&quot;) are the sister group of the &quot;Charina&quot;/&quot;Lichanura&quot; clade within Boidae.

<doc id="88582" wikidata="Q654652" url="?curid=88582" title="The Partridge Family">
<text>The Partridge Family is an American musical sitcom created by Bernard Slade, which was broadcast in the United States from September 1970 to March 1974 on ABC.

The series follows the lives of a fictional pop music band formed by the titular family, including Shirley (Shirley Jones), Keith (David Cassidy), Laurie (Susan Dey), and Danny (Danny Bonaduce), as well as their manager Reuben Kincaid (Dave Madden). The family was loosely based on the real-life musical family the Cowsills, a popular band in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The show was broadcast on ABC as part of its Friday night line-up, and had subsequent runs in syndication.

==Premise==

In the pilot episode, a group of musical siblings in the fictional city of San Pueblo, California, (said to be &quot;40 miles from Napa County&quot; in episode 24, &quot;A Partridge By Any Other Name&quot;) convinces their widowed mother, bank teller Shirley Partridge, to help them out by singing as they record a pop song in their garage. Through the efforts of the precocious and streetsmart 10-year-old Danny, they find a manager, Reuben Kincaid, who helps make the song a Top 40 hit. After more persuading, Shirley agrees that the family can go on tour. They acquire an old school bus, a 1957 Chevrolet Series 6800 Superior, for touring, paint it with Mondrian-inspired patterns, and head to Las Vegas, Nevada, for their first live gig at Caesars Palace.

Subsequent episodes usually show the band performing in various venues or in their garage. The shows often contrast suburban life with the adventures of a show-business family on the road. After the first season, more of the show&#x27;s action takes place in the family&#x27;s hometown than on tour.

==Background==

&quot;The Partridge Family&quot; was created for television by Bernard Slade, and the series&#x27; executive producer was Bob Claver. The show was inspired by and loosely based on the Cowsills, a family pop music group that was famous in the late 1960s. In the show&#x27;s early development, the Cowsill children were considered by the producers, but because the Cowsills were not trained actors and were too old for the roles as scripted, Slade and Claver abandoned that idea. Shirley Jones had already been signed as mother Shirley Partridge and star of the show, with the producers insisting that Jones&#x27; casting in the role of Mrs. Partridge was not negotiable.

The pilot was filmed in December 1969. This unbroadcast pilot differs from the pilot that was broadcast in 1970. In the unaired pilot, Shirley&#x27;s name is Connie and she has a boyfriend played by Jones&#x27; real-life husband at the time, Jack Cassidy, father of David Cassidy. The family has a different address and lives in Ohio.

The show proved popular, but the fame took its toll on several, if not most, of the starring cast, particularly David Cassidy. In the midst of his rise to fame, Cassidy soon felt stifled by the show and trapped by the mass hysteria surrounding his every move. In May 1972, he appeared nude on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in a cropped Annie Leibovitz photo. He used the article to get away from his squeaky clean image. The article mentioned that Cassidy was riding around New York in the back of a car &quot;stoned and drunk&quot;.

Shortly after the series ended, the scriptwriter Roberta Tatum launched a lawsuit against Screen Gems concerning the creation of the show. She claimed that she had submitted a similar premise to Screen Gems before 1970 called &quot;Baker&#x27;s Half-Dozen&quot;. The matter was resolved out of court, with Tatum receiving a reported $150,000 from Screen Gems.

==Cast and characters==
* Shirley Jones as Shirley Partridge: vocals, keyboard, tambourine, percussion
* David Cassidy as Keith Partridge: lead vocals, guitars, banjo
* Susan Dey as Laurie Partridge: vocals, harmony, piano, Hammond organ, percussion
* Danny Bonaduce as Danny Partridge: vocals, bass guitar
* Jeremy Gelbwaks as Chris Partridge (season 1): vocals, drums
* Brian Forster as Chris Partridge (seasons 2–4): vocals, drums
* Suzanne Crough as Tracy Partridge: tambourine, percussion, vocals
* Dave Madden as Reuben Kincaid: band manager
* Rick Segall as Ricky Stevens (season 4): singer
* Simone, the family&#x27;s pet dog (Season 1, occasionally in later seasons)
* Gary Dubin as Punky Lazaar (recurring role): a friend of Danny Partridge

No members of the cast played any music on the show or the album releases and originally only Jones sang. Initially, all of the actors pretended to sing while listening to recordings by session musicians, who provided the real vocal and instrumental music attributed to the Partridge Family. However, after Cassidy demonstrated to the series music producer, Wes Farrell, that he could sing, he was allowed to record his own vocal parts.

===Notable guest stars===
During the show&#x27;s four-season run, many actors made guest appearances. The country singer Johnny Cash made an uncredited cameo appearance in the pilot episode. Ray Bolger played Shirley&#x27;s father in three episodes and Rosemary DeCamp played her mother in four episodes. Then-Governor Ronald Reagan&#x27;s daughter, Maureen Reagan, also appeared in one episode. The future &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; stars Jaclyn Smith, Farrah Fawcett and Cheryl Ladd all made guest appearances on separate episodes.

Baseball Hall of Fame catcher Johnny Bench appeared in a cameo role as a Kings Island Inn poolside waiter in &quot;I Left My Heart in Cincinnati,&quot; a Season 3 episode which first aired on January 26, 1973.

Bobby Sherman appeared in the last episode of the first season as the struggling songwriter Bobby Conway. This episode led into a short-lived spin-off series on ABC, &quot;Getting Together&quot;, starring Sherman and Wes Stern as Conway&#x27;s business partner Lionel Poindexter.

==Episodes==

==Production==
At the end of the first season, Jeremy Gelbwaks&#x27; family moved out of the Los Angeles area, and the part of Chris was recast with the actor Brian Forster. According to Cassidy, Gelbwaks &quot;had a personality conflict with every person in the cast and the producers&quot; and especially did not get along with Cassidy or Bonaduce. A dog named Simone appeared in the first season, but it was phased out during the second season. At the beginning of the fourth season, a four-year-old neighbor, Ricky Stevens (Ricky Segall), appeared and sang a children&#x27;s song during each episode, but the character was dropped mid-season.

===Music===
Music recorded for the pilot episode was produced by Shorty Rogers, a jazz musician and arranger who worked with the Monkees. Songs for the ongoing series were recorded by the music producer Wes Farrell. Chip Douglas was the first to be offered the job of producing the music, but declined.

The studio concoction that forms the Partridge Family sound has lead singer David Cassidy, members of the Ron Hicklin Singers as backing vocalists and several of the era&#x27;s most highly regarded studio musicians, now known as &quot;the Wrecking Crew&quot;. Cassidy&#x27;s co-star and real-life stepmother Shirley Jones also appears on the recordings, although there remains speculation that she can be heard more prominently in the television mixes of the songs than in the album mixes. In each episode of the sitcom, the television family of six are seen on screen together in recording sessions and concert performances, playing the part of performers, but none except Cassidy and Jones was involved in any of the actual recordings. Two tracks on the 1970 first LP, &quot;The Partridge Family Album&quot;, do not include Cassidy. These songs, &quot;I&#x27;m on the Road&quot; and &quot;I Really Want to Know You&quot;, were sung in blended-harmony style by members of the Ron Hicklin Singers: brothers John and Tom Bahler, Ron Hicklin and Jackie Ward (who in 1963, as Robin Ward, charted with the no. 14 hit &quot;Wonderful Summer&quot;). These professional singers appear throughout the Partridge Family&#x27;s output.

Cassidy was originally to lip sync to dubbed vocals with the rest of the cast but convinced Farrell that he could sing, and was allowed to join the studio ensemble as the lead singer.

Season 1, episode 1 is the only episode of the series that does not use any version of the theme song, instead using the Rogers and Kelly Gordon song &quot;Together (Havin&#x27; A Ball)&quot; under the opening credits. The first episode is also unique in that it does not include the animated main title, instead using shots of the Partridge Family singing &quot;Together&quot; as if in a performance.

Two different songs were used as the opening theme for the television series. Season 1 uses &quot;When We&#x27;re Singin (Wes Farrell and Diane Hildebrand):

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Come on down and meet everybody,
And hear us singin&#x27;.
There&#x27;s nothing better than being together,
When we&#x27;re singin&#x27;.
Five of us, and Mom working all day,
We knew we could help her if our music would pay.
Danny got Reuben to sell our song, 
And it really came together when Mom sang along...&quot; &quot;(from &quot;When We&#x27;re Singin)&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

The other seasons all use &quot;C&#x27;mon Get Happy&quot; (Wes Farrell and Danny Janssen), which retained the &quot;When We&#x27;re Singin&#x27;&quot; tune but with new lyrics by Danny Janssen:

&lt;poem&gt;
Hello world, hear the song that we&#x27;re singing.
C&#x27;mon get happy.
A whole lot o&#x27; loving is what we&#x27;ll be bringin&#x27;
We&#x27;ll make you happy. 
We had a dream, we&#x27;d go travelin&#x27; together,
We spread a little love and then we keep movin&#x27; on.
Somethin&#x27; always happens whenever we&#x27;re together;
We get a happy feelin&#x27; when we&#x27;re singing a song...&quot; &quot;(from &quot;C&#x27;mon Get Happy&quot;)&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

For its final season, ABC moved the show from its 8:30 p.m. Friday slot (where it rated first in its slot) to Saturday at 8 p.m. (opposite CBS&#x27; top-rated &quot;All in the Family&quot; and NBC&#x27;s medical drama &quot;Emergency!&quot;, against which it lost more than half of its audience from the previous season).

In the United Kingdom, it was first picked up by the BBC who showed the first three episodes in a Friday children&#x27;s slot of 17:20, starting on September 17, 1971. From October 2, 1971, it moved to Saturdays at 17:10, and eight episodes were shown at this time. A further episode was shown on New Year&#x27;s Eve (December 31, 1971), after which the BBC dropped the programme. After Cassidy succeeded with UK Top 30 chart hits the following year, the show was picked up by ITV in many regions. On London Weekend Television, it was shown at Saturday lunchtimes. After the show&#x27;s popularity began to decline in the US, it began to increase in the UK. This new popularity in the UK gave the Partridge Family five UK Top 20 hits, some of which were less popular in the US.

After 96 episodes and eight Partridge Family albums, ABC canceled the show in 1974.

===Syndication===
Nickelodeon ran &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; from 1993 to 1994 as part of its &quot;Nick at Nite&quot; line-up. The network used interviews and commercials with cast members, and created a new version of the bus for promotion. The show was also shown at various times on USA Network, Fox Family, Ion Television, and Hallmark Channel. In January 2011, it was shown on Antenna TV. FETV started showing &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; in December 2017.

The cast was reunited in 1977 on the special &quot;Thanksgiving Reunion with The Partridge Family and My Three Sons&quot;. They reunited again in the 1990s on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; and the short-lived talk show &quot;Danny!&quot; (1995) and were featured on &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot;, &quot;Biography&quot; and VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot;.

When the digital subchannel Antenna TV began in January 2011, &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; was one of its offerings through the network&#x27;s distribution agreement with Sony Pictures Television (parent company and successor of series producer Screen Gems). From November 25–27, 2020, Antenna TV aired all 96 episodes in chronological order to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the series&#x27; debut.

As of 2023, the show streams in Canada via CTV Throwback.

===Film adaptation===
In April 1995 following the successful release of &quot;The Brady Bunch Movie&quot;, it was announced Warner Bros. had made a deal with Bernard Slade and Witt/Thomas Productions to develop a feature length adaptation.

===Discography===

&quot;The Partridge Family&quot; was produced for ABC by Screen Gems. The company promoted the show by releasing a series of albums featuring the family band, though David Cassidy and Shirley Jones (as backing vocalist) were the only cast members who were actually featured on the recordings.

As the show and other associated merchandising soared, Cassidy became a teen idol. The producers signed Cassidy as a solo act as well. Cassidy began touring with his own group of musicians, performing Partridge songs, as well as hits from his own albums, to thousands of screaming teenagers in major stadiums across the US, the UK, Europe, Japan and Australia.
The Partridge Family remain best known for their 1970 smash debut single &quot;I Think I Love You&quot;, written by Tony Romeo, who had penned the big 1968 hit &quot;Indian Lake&quot; (and other records) by the Cowsills. &quot;I Think I Love You&quot; spent three weeks at number one on &quot;the Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in November and December 1970. It sold more than five million copies, outselling the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot;, was awarded a gold disc, and made the group the third fictional artist to have a number one hit (after the Chipmunks and the Archies). The single&#x27;s parent LP, &quot;The Partridge Family Album&quot;, reached No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was also awarded gold status by the RIAA in December 1970, having sold more than 500,000 copies. A string of US and/or UK hit singles followed: &quot;Doesn&#x27;t Somebody Want to Be Wanted&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Meet You Halfway&quot;, &quot;I Woke Up in Love This Morning&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s One of Those Nights (Yes Love)&quot;, &quot;Am I Losing You&quot;, and covers of the early- to -mid-1960s hits &quot;Looking Through the Eyes of Love&quot;, &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard to Do&quot; and &quot;Walking in the Rain&quot;. These singles were showcased on the three gold-certified albums &quot;Up to Date&quot; (1971), &quot;Sound Magazine&quot; (1971) and &quot;Shopping Bag&quot; (1972), plus &quot;The Partridge Family Notebook&quot; (1972), &quot;Crossword Puzzle&quot; (1973), and &quot;Bulletin Board&quot; (1973), with &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard to To Do&quot; making its album debut on &quot;The Partridge Family at Home with Their Greatest Hits&quot; (1972). The holiday album &quot;A Partridge Family Christmas Card&quot; was the top-selling Christmas record of 1971. Record sales success was replicated internationally, with both the Partridge Family group and Cassidy as a solo singer achieving huge hits in Canada, Great Britain, Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In all, the Partridge Family released 89 songs on nine albums between 1970 and 1973.

===Danny Bonaduce album===
Though Danny Bonaduce was not part of the session band, he also got a recording contract. His self-titled debut LP was released in 1973 by Lion Records, a subsidiary label of MGM Records. The single from the album, &quot;Dreamland&quot;, was a minor hit. Though Bonaduce was credited as lead singer on all songs, he insists that he had a weak voice and that Bruce Roberts provided most of the vocals on the album. The first track, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Magician&quot;, in which the 13-year-old Bonaduce seduces a woman into having sexual intercourse with him, has developed a cult following for its campy entertainment value. The original, watered-down version was recorded with Cassidy for the &quot;Sound Magazine&quot; album, but was discarded and never released. In fall 2010, Cassidy dared Bonaduce to learn how to play the bass guitar lines for the songs the Partridge Family performed. Bonaduce learned the bass guitar line for &quot;Doesn&#x27;t Somebody Want to Be Wanted&quot;, stating that although he had no ability to read music, the song was relatively easy to learn; Cassidy and Bonaduce subsequently performed together on rare occasions.

===Ricky Segall album===
In conjunction with the songs featured by Ricky Segall in the fourth season of the TV show, Bell Records released the album &quot;Ricky Segall and The Segalls&quot; in 1973. Seven of the album&#x27;s 10 tracks were featured on the TV show. Two tracks were also released as a single, &quot;Sooner or Later&quot;/&quot;Say Hey Willie&quot; (Bell 45429).

===Animated spin-off===
The Partridges had a brief resurgence in animated form that saw the family propelled into the future. The animated Partridges first appeared when the kids did a series of guest spots on &quot;Goober and the Ghost Chasers&quot;. That idea evolved into a CBS Saturday morning Hanna-Barbera-produced cartoon in 1974, &quot;Partridge Family 2200 A.D.&quot; (also called &quot;The Partridge Family in Outer Space&quot; when rerun later as part of &quot;Fred Flintstone and Friends&quot;). Jones and Cassidy did not voice their animated characters and Susan Dey and Dave Madden had very limited involvement with this cartoon.

===Board game===
Released in 1971 by Milton Bradley, The Partridge Family Game offers a glimpse of what life on the road was like for one of TV&#x27;s favorite fictional pop bands. The back of the box explains, &quot;As on TV, many happenings occur to the Partridge family, this game describes one of them. They have finished playing at a local arena and must hurry to their BUS to get traveling again. On the way, they may have some delays.&quot; The object of the game is to be the first player to get back to the tour bus.

===Books===
During the entire four season run of the series, Curtis Books published seventeen paperback mystery novels featuring the entire cast of characters. The various authors included Michael Avallone, Vic Crume, Lee Hays, Paul Fairman, Vance Stanton and Edward Fenton.

===Comic books===
Charlton Comics produced a comic book featuring the Partridge Family between March 1971 and December 1973 and later on just David Cassidy comic books. It features stories about the characters, song lyrics and features about Cassidy. The drawings were provided by Don Sherwood.

===Reunion special===
Three years after the show&#x27;s cancellation, Jones and other cast members gathered with cast members of &quot;My Three Sons&quot; for the ABC special &quot;Thanksgiving Reunion with The Partridge Family and My Three Sons&quot;, which aired on November 25, 1977. The show featured the casts discussing the histories of their shows, although other than Jones and Fred MacMurray both portraying single parents of large families, the two series had no narrative link.

===Reunion on &quot;Danny!&quot;===
In 1995, a majority of the cast appeared on Bonaduce&#x27;s talk show &quot;Danny!&quot;, including Shirley Jones, Dave Madden, Jeremy Gelbwaks, Brian Forster, Suzanne Crough, Ricky Segall and the show&#x27;s executive producer Bob Claver. Susan Dey was working on a movie at the time but called into the show to briefly reminisce with Bonaduce. David Cassidy was also unable to appear as he was working on a new album at that time.

===&quot;Come On Get Happy: The Partridge Family Story&quot;===
In 1999, a &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; TV movie called &quot;Come On Get Happy: The Partridge Family Story&quot; aired on ABC. The film focuses on the lives of Danny Bonaduce (who narrated) and David Cassidy.

===&quot;The New Partridge Family&quot;===
In 2004, VH1 produced a pilot for a syndicated &quot;The New Partridge Family&quot;, starring Suzanne Sole as Shirley, Leland Grant as Keith, Emma Stone (in her first role) as Laurie, Spencer Tuskowski as Danny, and French Stewart as Reuben Kincaid. The pilot was the only episode produced. The episode ended with a teaser for &quot;next week&#x27;s episode&quot; in which the children&#x27;s estranged father, played by Danny Bonaduce, drops in for a surprise visit with his same-sex life partner.

===&quot;Ruby &amp; the Rockits&quot;===

In 2009, Shirley Jones guest starred as David Cassidy&#x27;s mother on the television series &quot;Ruby &amp; the Rockits&quot;. David and half-brother Patrick Cassidy played brothers on the series. Shirley&#x27;s other sons were a part of the show: Shaun Cassidy was producer, and Ryan Cassidy worked behind the scenes.

===Animated reboot===
On June 8, 2023, it was announced an animated reboot of the series is in the works. The Partridge Family will be black in this version.

===Home media===
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has released all four seasons of &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; on DVD in Region 1. Seasons 1 and 2 have been released in Regions 2 and 4.

On October 15, 2013, Sony released &quot;The Partridge Family – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1. The 12-disc set features all 96 episodes of the series as well as bonus features.

<doc id="88583" wikidata="Q4164320" url="?curid=88583" title="Clinton Doctrine">
<text>The Clinton Doctrine is not an official government statement but an interpretation made by experts of the main priorities in the foreign policy of the Bill Clinton administration in the United States from 1993 to 2001.

==Clinton statements==
Various speeches have been proposed as texts for a doctrine. Thus, in a February 26, 1999, speech, President Bill Clinton said the following:

:&quot;It&#x27;s easy ... to say that we really have no interests in who lives in this or that valley in Bosnia, or who owns a strip of brushland in the Horn of Africa, or some piece of parched earth by the Jordan River. But the true measure of our interests lies not in how small or distant these places are, or in whether we have trouble pronouncing their names. The question we must ask is, what are the consequences to our security of letting conflicts fester and spread. We cannot, indeed, we should not, do everything or be everywhere. But where our values and our interests are at stake, and where we can make a difference, we must be prepared to do so.&quot;

Clinton later made statements that augmented his approach to interventionism:

:&quot;Genocide is in and of itself a national interest where we should act&quot; and &quot;we can say to the people of the world, whether you live in Africa, or Central Europe, or any other place, if somebody comes after innocent civilians and tries to kill them en masse because of their race, their ethnic background or their religion, and it&#x27;s within our power to stop it, we will stop it.&quot;

The interventionist position was used to justify U.S. involvement in the Yugoslav Wars. Clinton was criticized for not intervening to stop the Rwandan genocide of 1994. Other observers viewed Operation Gothic Serpent in Somalia as a mistake.

The Clinton administration also promoted globalization by pushing for trade agreements. The administration negotiated a total of around 300 trade agreements, such as NAFTA. Anthony Lake who served as National Security Advisor to Clinton between 1993 and 1997, showed the Clinton administration&#x27;s commitment to accelerating the process of globalization in a speech given in 1993. The speech talked about enlarging the community of democracies around the world alongside expanding free markets.

==National Security Strategy==
In Clinton&#x27;s final National Security Strategy, he differentiated between national interests and humanitarian interests. He described national interests as those that:

:&quot;...do not affect our national survival, but ... do affect our national well-being and the character of the world in which we live. Important national interests include, for example, regions in which we have a sizable economic stake or commitments to allies, protecting the global environment from severe harm, and crises with a potential to generate substantial and highly destabilizing refugee flows.&quot;

Clinton&#x27;s National Security Strategy provided Bosnia and Kosovo as examples of such interests and stakes. In contrast, it described humanitarian interests as those that force the nation to act:
:&quot;because our values demand it. Examples include responding to natural and manmade disasters; promoting human rights and seeking to halt gross violations of those rights; supporting democratization, adherence to the rule of law and civilian control of the military; assisting humanitarian demining; and promoting sustainable development and environmental protection.&quot;

The NSS also declared the right of the United States to intervene militarily to secure its &quot;vital interests,&quot; which included, &quot;ensuring uninhibited access to key markets, energy supplies, and strategic resources.&quot;

==Historiography==
Historians and political scientists evaluated Clinton&#x27;s immediate predecessors in terms of how well they handled the Cold War. A dilemma has arisen regarding what criteria to use regarding presidential administrations after the end of the Cold War. Historians have debated, with inconclusive results, on the question of whether there was a consistent overall theme or schema to Clintonian foreign policy, or what scholars would call a &quot;Clinton doctrine&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that Henry Kissinger echoed a frequent complaint when he characterized the Clinton foreign policy as less a grand design than “a series of seemingly unrelated decisions in response to specific crises.” John Dumbrell however notes that Douglas Brinkley and others have identified a Clinton doctrine in terms of systematic efforts to expand democracy in the world. Other experts have pointed to the Clintonian emphasis on humanitarianism, especially when military intervention was called for. Democracy and humanitarianism represent the idealistic tradition in American foreign policy. Critics of Clintonianism have drawn upon the warnings of George F. Kennan, an exponent of the realist tradition. Kennan argued that idealism made poor policy, and according to Richard Russell, believed idealism that ignored the realities of power and the national interest would be self-defeating and erode American power.

Dumbrell also sees several other possible Clinton doctrines, including perhaps a systematic reluctance to become involved in foreign complications far from the American shore. Dumbrell&#x27;s favorite candidate is the explicit Clinton administration policy of warning &quot;rogue&quot; states on their misbehavior, using U.S. military intervention as a threat. He traces the origins of this policy to presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, arguing that the Clinton administration made it more systematic so it deserves the term &quot;Clinton Doctrine&quot;. However, Dumbrell concludes, it did not prove successful in practice.

<doc id="88585" wikidata="Q41705" url="?curid=88585" title="Fujian">
<text>Fujian is a province located in South China. Fujian is bordered by Zhejiang to the north, Jiangxi to the west, Guangdong to the south, and the Taiwan Strait to the east. Its capital is Fuzhou and its largest prefecture city by population is Quanzhou, with other notable cities including the port city of Xiamen and Zhangzhou. Fujian is located on the west coast of the Taiwan Strait as the closest province geographically and culturally to Taiwan. Certain islands such as Kinmen are only approximately 10 km (6.2 mi) east of Xiamen in Fujian.

While the population predominantly identifies as Han, it is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse provinces in China. The dialects of the language group Min Chinese are most commonly spoken within the province, including the Fuzhou dialect and Eastern Min of Northeastern Fujian province and various Southern Min and Hokkien dialects of southeastern Fujian. The capital city of Fuzhou and Fu&#x27;an of Ningde prefecture along with Cangnan county-level city of Wenzhou prefecture in Zhejiang province make up the Min Dong linguistic and cultural region of Northeastern Fujian. Hakka Chinese is also spoken, by the Hakka people in Fujian. Min dialects, Hakka and Standard Chinese are mutually unintelligible. Due to emigration, a sizable amount of the ethnic Chinese populations of Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines speak Southern Min (or Hokkien).

With a population of 41.5 million, Fujian ranks 15th in population among Chinese provinces. In 2022, Fujian&#x27;s GDP reached CN¥5.31 trillion (US$790 billion by nominal GDP), ranking 4th in East China region and 8th nationwide in GDP. Fujian&#x27;s GDP per capita is above the national average, at ( in nominal), the second highest GDP per capita of all Chinese provinces after Jiangsu. It has benefited from its geographical proximity with Taiwan. As a result of the Chinese Civil War, a small portion of Historical Fujian is now within the Republic of China (ROC, Taiwan). The Fujian province of the ROC consists of three offshore archipelagos, namely the Kinmen Islands, the Matsu Islands, and the Wuqiu Islands.

Fujian is considered one of China&#x27;s leading provinces in education and research. As of 2023, two major cities in the province ranked in the top 45 cities in the world (Xiamen 38th and Fuzhou 45th) by scientific research output, as tracked by the Nature Index.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Fujian&quot; () originated from the combination of the city names of Fuzhou () and nearby Jianzhou (, or present-day Nanping ()).

==History==
===Prehistoric Fujian===
Recent archaeological discoveries in 2011 demonstrate that Fujian had entered the Neolithic Age by the middle of the 6th millennium BC. From the Keqiutou site (7450–5590 BP), an early Neolithic site in Pingtan Island located about southeast of Fuzhou, numerous tools made of stones, shells, bones, jades, and ceramics (including wheel-made ceramics) have been unearthed, together with spinning wheels, which is definitive evidence of weaving.

The Tanshishan () site (5500–4000 BP) in suburban Fuzhou spans the Neolithic and Chalcolithic Age where semi-underground circular buildings were found in the lower level. The Huangtulun () site (), also in suburban Fuzhou, was of the Bronze Age in character.

Tianlong Jiao (2013) notes that the Neolithic appeared on the coast of Fujian around 6,000 B.P. During the Neolithic, the coast of Fujian had a low population density, with the population depending on mostly on fishing and hunting, along with limited agriculture.

There were four major Neolithic cultures in coastal Fujian, with the earliest Neolithic cultures originating from the north in coastal Zhejiang.
*Keqiutou culture (; , or )
*Tanshishan culture (; , or )
*Damaoshan culture (; )
*Huangguashan culture (; , or )

There were two major Neolithic cultures in inland Fujian, which were highly distinct from the coastal Fujian Neolithic cultures. These are the Niubishan culture () from 5000 to 4000 years ago, and the Hulushan culture () from 2050 to 1550 BC.

===Minyue kingdom===
Fujian was also where the kingdom of Minyue was located. The word &quot;Mǐnyuè&quot; was derived by combining &quot;Mǐn&quot; (), which is perhaps an ethnic name (), and &quot;Yuè&quot;, after the State of Yue, a Spring and Autumn period kingdom in Zhejiang to the north. This is because the royal family of Yuè fled to Fujian after its kingdom was annexed by the State of Chu in 306 BC. Mǐn is also the name of the main river in this area, but the ethnonym is probably older.

===Qin dynasty===
The Qin deposed the King of Minyue, establishing instead a paramilitary province there called Minzhong Commandery. Minyue was a &quot;de facto&quot; kingdom until one of the emperors of the Qin dynasty, the first unified imperial Chinese state, abolished its status.

===Han dynasty===

In the aftermath of the Qin dynasty&#x27;s fall, civil war broke out between two warlords, Xiang Yu and Liu Bang. The Minyue king Wuzhu sent his troops to fight with Liu and his gamble paid off. Liu was victorious and founded the Han dynasty. In 202 BC, he restored Minyue&#x27;s status as a tributary independent kingdom. Thus Wuzhu was allowed to construct his fortified city in Fuzhou as well as a few locations in the Wuyi Mountains, which have been excavated in recent years. His kingdom extended beyond the borders of contemporary Fujian into eastern Guangdong, eastern Jiangxi, and southern Zhejiang.

After Wuzhu&#x27;s death, Minyue maintained its militant tradition and launched several expeditions against its neighboring kingdoms in Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, primarily in the 2nd century BC. This was stopped by the Han dynasty as it expanded southward. The Han emperor eventually decided to get rid of the potential threat by launching a military campaign against Minyue. Large forces approached Minyue simultaneously from four directions via land and sea in 111 BC. The rulers in Fuzhou surrendered to avoid a futile fight and destruction and the first kingdom in Fujian history came to an abrupt end.

Fujian was part of the much larger Yang Province (Yangzhou), whose provincial capital was designated in Liyang (歷陽; present-day He County, Anhui).

The Han dynasty collapsed at the end of the 2nd century AD, paving the way for the Three Kingdoms era. Sun Quan, the founder of the Kingdom of Wu, spent nearly 20 years subduing the Shan Yue people, the branch of the Yue living in mountains.

===Jin era===
The first wave of immigration of the noble class arrived in the province in the early 4th century when the Western Jin dynasty collapsed and the north was torn apart by civil wars and rebellions by tribal peoples from the north and west. These immigrants were primarily from eight families in central China: 

Nevertheless, isolation from nearby areas owing to rugged terrain contributed to Fujian&#x27;s relatively undeveloped economy and level of development, despite major population boosts from northern China during the &quot;barbarian&quot; rebellions. The population density in Fujian remained low compared to the rest of China. Only two commanderies and sixteen counties were established by the Western Jin dynasty. Like other southern provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan, Fujian often served as a destination for exiled prisoners and dissidents at that time.

During the Southern and Northern Dynasties era, the Southern Dynasties (Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang (Western Liang), and Chen) reigned south of the Yangtze River, including Fujian.

===Sui and Tang dynasties===

During the Sui and Tang eras a large influx of migrants settled in Fujian.

During the Sui dynasty, Fujian was again part of Yang Province.

During the Tang, Fujian was part of the larger Jiangnan East Circuit, whose capital was at Suzhou. Modern-day Fujian was composed of around 5 prefectures and 25 counties.

The Tang dynasty (618–907) oversaw the next golden age of China, which contributed to a boom in Fujian&#x27;s culture and economy. Fuzhou&#x27;s economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang dynasty saw several political upheavals in the Chinese heartland, prompting even larger waves of northerners to immigrate to the northern part of Fujian.

===Five Dynasties Ten Kingdoms===

As the Tang dynasty ended, China was torn apart in the period of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms. During this time, a second major wave of immigration arrived in the safe haven of Fujian, led by Wang Brothers (Wang Chao, and Wang Shenzhi), who set up an independent Kingdom of Min with its capital in Fuzhou. After the death of the founding king, however, the kingdom suffered from internal strife, and was soon absorbed by Southern Tang, another southern kingdom.

Parts of northern Fujian were conquered by the Wuyue Kingdom to the north as well, including the Min capital Fuzhou.

Quanzhou city was blooming into a seaport under the reign of the Min Kingdom.

&quot;Qingyuan Jiedushi&quot; was a military/governance office created in 949 by Southern Tang&#x27;s second emperor Li Jing for the warlord Liu Congxiao, who nominally submitted to him but controlled Quan (, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian) and Zhang (, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian) Prefectures in &quot;de facto&quot; independence from the Southern Tang state. (Zhang Prefecture was, at times during the circuit&#x27;s existence, also known as Nan Prefecture ().) Starting in 960, in addition to being nominally submissive to Southern Tang, Qingyuan Circuit was also nominally submissive to Song, which had itself become Southern Tang&#x27;s nominal overlord.
After Liu&#x27;s death, the circuit was briefly ruled by his biological nephew/adoptive son Liu Shaozi, who was then overthrown by the officers Zhang Hansi and Chen Hongjin. Zhang then ruled the circuit briefly, before Chen deposed him and took over. In 978, with Song&#x27;s determination to unify Chinese lands in full order, Chen decided that he could not stay &quot;de facto&quot; independent, and offered the control of the circuit to Song&#x27;s Emperor Taizong, ending Qingyuan Circuit as a &quot;de facto&quot; independent entity.

===Song dynasty===
The area was reorganized into the Fujian Circuit in 985, which was the first time the name &quot;Fujian&quot; was used for an administrative region.

===Vietnam===
Many Chinese migrated from Fujian&#x27;s major ports to Vietnam&#x27;s Red River Delta. The settlers then created Trần port and Vân Đồn. Fujian and Guangdong Chinese moved to the Vân Đồn coastal port to engage in commerce.

During the Lý and Trần dynasties, many Chinese ethnic groups with the surname Trần (陳) migrated to Vietnam from what is now Fujian or Guangxi. They settled along the coast of Vietnam and the capital&#x27;s southeastern area. The Vietnamese Trần clan traces their ancestry to Trần Tự Minh (227 BC). He was a Qin General during the Warring state period who belonged to the indigenous Mân, a Baiyue ethnic group of Southern China and Northern Vietnam. Tự Minh also served under King An Dương Vương of Âu Lạc kingdom in resisting Qin&#x27;s conquest of Âu Lạc. Their genealogy also included Trần Tự Viễn (582 – 637) of Giao Châu and Trần Tự An (1010 - 1077) of Đại Việt. Near the end of the 11th century the descendants of a fisherman named Trần Kinh, whose hometown was in Tức Mạc village in Đại Việt (Modern day Vietnam), would marry the royal Lý clan, which was then founded the Vietnam Tran dynasty in 1225.

In Vietnam, the Trần served as officials. The surnames are found in the Trần and Lý dynasty Imperial exam records. Chinese ethnic groups are recorded in Trần and Lý dynasty records of officials. Clothing, food, and languages were fused with the local Vietnamese in Vân Đồn district where the Chinese ethnic groups had moved after leaving their home province of what is now Fujian, Guangxi, and Guangdong.

In 1172, Fujian was attacked by Pi-she-ye pirates from Taiwan or the Visayas, Philippines.

===Yuan dynasty===
After the establishment of the Yuan dynasty, Fujian became part of Jiangzhe province, whose capital was at Hangzhou. From 1357 to 1366 Muslims in Quanzhou participated in the Ispah Rebellion, advancing northward and even capturing Putian and Fuzhou before the rebellion was crushed by the Yuan. Afterward, Quanzhou city lost foreign interest in trading and its formerly welcoming international image as the foreigners were all massacred or deported.

Yuan dynasty General Chen Youding, who had put down the Ispah Rebellion, continued to rule over the Fujian area even after the outbreak of the Red Turban Rebellion. Forces loyal to the eventual Ming dynasty founder Zhu Yuanzhang (Hongwu Emperor) defeated Chen in 1367.

===Ming dynasty===
After the establishment of the Ming dynasty, Fujian became a province, with its capital at Fuzhou. In the early Ming era, Fuzhou Changle was the staging area and supply depot of Zheng He&#x27;s naval expeditions. Further development was severely hampered by the sea trade ban, and the area was superseded by nearby ports of Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo and Shanghai despite the lifting of the ban in 1550. Large-scale piracy by Wokou was eventually wiped out by the Chinese military.

An account of the Ming dynasty Fujian was written by No In (Lu Ren ).

The Pisheya appear in Quanzhou Ming era records.

===Qing dynasty===
The late Ming and early Qing dynasty symbolized an era of a large influx of refugees and another 20 years of sea trade ban under the Kangxi Emperor, a measure intended to counter the refuge Ming government of Koxinga in the island of Taiwan.

The sea ban implemented by the Qing forced many people to evacuate the coast to deprive Koxinga&#x27;s Ming loyalists of resources. This has led to the myth that it was because Manchus were &quot;afraid of water&quot;.

Incoming refugees did not translate into a major labor force, owing to their re-migration into prosperous regions of Guangdong. In 1683, the Qing dynasty conquered Taiwan in the Battle of Penghu and annexed it into Fujian province, as Taiwan Prefecture. Many more Han Chinese then settled in Taiwan. Today, most Taiwanese are descendants of Hokkien people from Southern Fujian. Fujian and Taiwan were originally treated as one province (Fujian-Taiwan-Province), but starting in 1885, they split into two separate provinces.

In the 1890s, the Qing ceded Taiwan to Japan via the Treaty of Shimonoseki after the First Sino-Japanese War. In 1905–1907 Japan made overtures to enlarge its sphere of influence to include Fujian. Japan was trying to obtain French loans and also avoid the Open Door Policy. Paris provided loans on condition that Japan respects the Open Door principles and does not violate China&#x27;s territorial integrity.

===Republic of China===
The Xinhai revolution overthrew the Qing dynasty and brought the province into the rule of the Republic of China.

The anarchist Constitution Protection Region of Southern Fujian was established by Chen Jiongming from 1918 to 1920.

Fujian briefly established the independent Fujian People&#x27;s Government in 1933. It was re-controlled by the Republic of China in 1934.

Fujian came under a Japanese sea blockade during World War II.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
After the Chinese Civil War, the People&#x27;s Republic of China unified the country and took over most of Fujian, excluding the Quemoy and Matsu Islands.

In its early days, Fujian&#x27;s development was relatively slow in comparison to other coastal provinces due to potential conflicts with Kuomintang-controlled Taiwan. Today, the province has the highest forest coverage rate while enjoying a high growth rate in the economy. The GDP per capita in Fujian is ranked 4-6th place among provinces of China in recent years.

Development has been accompanied by a large influx of population from the overpopulated areas to Fujian&#x27;s north and west, and much of the farmland and forest, as well as cultural heritage sites such as the temples of king Wuzhu, have given way to ubiquitous high-rise buildings. Fujian faces challenges to sustain development while at the same time preserving Fujian&#x27;s natural and cultural heritage.

In 2023, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council of China jointly proposed making Fujian a demonstration zone in cross-strait integration between Taiwan and mainland China. Under the plan, the Chinese government would boost economic and transportation cooperation with Taiwan and make it easier for Taiwanese people to live, buy property, access social services and study in Fujian.

==Geography==
The province is mostly mountainous and is traditionally said to be &quot;eight parts mountain, one part water, and one part farmland&quot; (). The northwest is higher in altitude, with the Wuyi Mountains forming the border between Fujian and Jiangxi. It is the most forested provincial-level administrative region in China, with a 62.96% forest coverage rate in 2009. Fujian&#x27;s highest point is Mount Huanggang in the Wuyi Mountains, with an altitude of .

Fujian faces East China Sea to the east, South China Sea to the south, and the Taiwan Strait to the southeast. The coastline is rugged and has many bays and islands. Major islands include Quemoy (also known as Kinmen, controlled by the Republic of China), Haitan Island, and Nanri Island. Meizhou Island occupies a central place in the cult of the goddess Matsu, the patron deity of Chinese sailors.

The Min River and its tributaries cut through much of northern and central Fujian. Other rivers include the Jin and the Jiulong. Due to its uneven topography, Fujian has many cliffs and rapids.

Fujian is separated from Taiwan by the -wide Taiwan Strait. Some of the small islands in the Taiwan Strait are also part of the province. The islands of Kinmen and Matsu are under the administration of the Republic of China.

Fujian contains several faults, the result of a collision between the Asiatic Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. The Changle-Naoao and Longan-Jinjiang fault zones in this area have annual displacement rates of 3–5 mm. They could cause major earthquakes in the future.

Fujian has a subtropical climate, with mild winters. In January, the coastal regions average around while the hills average . In the summer, temperatures are high, and the province is threatened by typhoons coming in from the Pacific. Average annual precipitation is .

==Transportation==
===Roads===

, there are of highways in Fujian, including of expressways. The top infrastructure projects in recent years have been the Zhangzhou-Zhaoan Expressway (US$624 million) and the Sanmingshi-Fuzhou expressway (US$1.40 billion). The 12th Five-Year Plan, covering the period from 2011 to 2015, aims to double the length of the province&#x27;s expressways to .

===Railways===

Due to Fujian&#x27;s mountainous terrain and traditional reliance on maritime transportation, railways came to the province comparatively late. The first rail links to neighboring Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Zhejiang Province, opened respectively, in 1959, 2000, and 2009. As of October 2013, Fujian has four rail links with Jiangxi to the northwest: the Yingtan–Xiamen Railway (opened 1957), the Hengfeng–Nanping Railway (1998), Ganzhou–Longyan Railway (2005) and the high-speed Xiangtang–Putian Railway (2013). Fujian&#x27;s lone rail link to Guangdong to the west, the Zhangping–Longchuan Railway (2000), will be joined with the high-speed Xiamen–Shenzhen Railway (Xiashen Line) in late 2013. The Xiashen Line forms the southernmost section of China&#x27;s Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor. The Wenzhou–Fuzhou and Fuzhou–Xiamen sections of this corridor entered operation in 2009 and link Fujian with Zhejiang with trains running at speeds of up to .

Within Fujian, coastal and interior cities are linked by the Nanping–Fuzhou (1959), Zhangping–Quanzhou–Xiaocuo (2007) and Longyan–Xiamen Railways, (2012). To attract Taiwanese investment, the province intends to increase its rail length by 50 percent to .

===Air===
The major airports are Fuzhou Changle International Airport, Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport, Quanzhou Jinjiang International Airport, Nanping Wuyishan Airport, Longyan Guanzhishan Airport and Sanming Shaxian Airport. Xiamen is capable of handling 15.75 million passengers as of 2011. Fuzhou is capable of handling 6.5 million passengers annually with a cargo capacity of more than 200,000 tons. The airport offers direct links to 45 destinations including international routes to Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

==Administrative divisions==

The People&#x27;s Republic of China controls most of the province and divides it into nine prefecture-level divisions: all prefecture-level cities (including a sub-provincial city):

All of the prefecture-level cities except Nanping, Sanming, and Longyan are found along the coast.

These nine prefecture-level cities are subdivided into 84 county-level divisions (31 districts, 11 county-level cities, and 42 counties). Those are in turn divided into 1,102 township-level divisions (653 towns, 233 townships, 19 ethnic townships, and 195 subdistricts).

The People&#x27;s Republic of China claims five of the six townships of Kinmen County, Republic of China (Taiwan) as a county of the prefecture-level city of Quanzhou.

The PRC claims Wuqiu Township, Kinmen County, Republic of China (Taiwan) as part of Xiuyu District of the prefecture-level city of Putian.

Finally, the PRC claims Lienchiang County (Matsu Islands), Republic of China (Taiwan) as a township of its Lianjiang County, which is part of the prefecture-level city of Fuzhou.

Together, these three groups of islands make up the Republic of China&#x27;s Fujian province.

==Economy==

Fujian is one of the more affluent provinces in China, with many industries spanning tea production, clothing, and sports manufacturers such as Anta, 361 Degrees, Xtep, Peak Sport Products and Septwolves. Fujian was one of the first provinces in China authorized by the central government to receive foreign investments. Many foreign firms have operations in Fujian. They include Boeing, Dell, GE, Kodak, Nokia, Siemens, Swire, TDK, and Panasonic. Within Fujian, the city of Xiamen was one of China&#x27;s first special economic zones (&quot;SEZs&quot;).

In 2022, Fujian&#x27;s GDP was CN¥5.31 trillion (US$790 billion in nominal), ranking 8th in GDP nationwide and appearing in the world&#x27;s top 20 largest sub-national economies. Along with its coastal neighbours Zhejiang and Guangdong, Fujian&#x27;s GDP per capita is above the national average, at ( in nominal), the second highest GDP per capita of all Chinese provinces after Jiangsu. The primary, secondary and tertiary economy respectively contributed to ¥307 billion ($45.7 billion), ¥2.51 trillion ($372.8 billion), and ¥2.50 trillion ($371 billion) to Fujian&#x27;s economy.

In terms of agricultural land, Fujian is hilly and farmland is sparse. Rice is the main crop, supplemented by sweet potatoes and wheat and barley. Cash crops include sugar cane and rapeseed. Fujian leads the provinces of China in longan production, and is also a major producer of lychees and tea. Seafood is another important product, with shellfish production especially prominent.

Because of its geographic location with Taiwan, Fujian has been considered the battlefield frontline in a potential war between mainland China and Taiwan. Hence, it received much less investment from the Chinese central government and developed much slower than the rest of China before 1978. Since 1978, when China opened to the world, Fujian has received significant investment from overseas Fujianese around the world, Taiwanese and foreign investment.

Minnan Golden Triangle, which includes Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou, accounts for 40 percent of the GDP of Fujian province.

Fujian province will be the major economic beneficiary of the opening up of direct transport with Taiwan, which commenced on December 15, 2008. This includes direct flights from Taiwan to major Fujian cities such as Xiamen and Fuzhou. In addition, ports in Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Fuzhou will upgrade their port infrastructure for increased economic trade with Taiwan.

Fujian is the host of China International Fair for Investment and Trade annually. It is held in Xiamen to promote foreign investment for all of China.

==Demographics==

As of 1832, the province was described as having an estimated &quot;population of fourteen millions.&quot; In 2021, Fujian&#x27;s population was estimated to be 41.87 million, with an urbanization rate of 69.7%.

Fujianese who are legally classified as Han Chinese make up 98% of the population. Various Min Chinese speakers make up the largest subgroups classified as Han Chinese in Fujian, such as Hoklo people, Fuzhounese people, Putian people and Fuzhou Tanka.

The Hakka, a Han Chinese people with their own distinct identity, live in the central and southwestern parts of Fujian. The She, an ethnic group scattered over mountainous regions in the north, is the largest minority ethnic group of the province.

Many ethnic Chinese around the world (especially in Southeast Asia) trace their ancestries to the Fujianese branches of the Hoklo and Teochew peoples. Descendants of Southern Min-speaking emigrants make up the majorities of ethnic-Chinese populations in Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, Brunei, Thailand, Indonesia, and Philippines. Eastern Min-speaking people (especially Fuzhounese people) are one of the major sources of Chinese immigrants to the United States since the 1990s.

=== Religion ===
The predominant religions in Fujian are Chinese folk religions, Taoist traditions, and Chinese Buddhism. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, just over 30% of the population believes and is involved in Chinese ancestral religion; 3.5% of the population identifies as Christian. The reports did not give figures for other religions; 65.19% of the population may be irreligious or involved in Chinese folk religion, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Chinese salvationist religions, or Islam. Notably, Fujian is one of the only places in the world where Manichaeism may still be practiced.

In 2010, there were reportedly just under 116,000 Muslims in Fujian.

==Culture==

Because of its mountainous nature and waves of migration from central China and assimilation of numerous foreign ethnic groups such as maritime traders in the course of history, Fujian is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse places in China. Local dialects can become unintelligible within , and the regional cultures and ethnic composition can be completely different from each other as well. This is reflected in the expression that &quot;if you drive five miles in Fujian the culture changes, and if you drive ten miles, the language does&quot;. Most varieties spoken in Fujian are assigned to a broad Min category. Recent classifications subdivide Min into
* Eastern Min (the former Northern group), including the Fuzhou dialect
* Northern Min, spoken in inland northern areas
* Pu-Xian, spoken in central coastal areas
* Central Min, spoken in the west of the province
* Shao-Jiang, spoken in the northwest
* Southern Min, including the Amoy dialect and Taiwanese
The seventh subdivision of Min, Qiong Wen, is not spoken in Fujian. Hakka, another subdivision of spoken Chinese, is spoken around Longyan by the Hakka people who live there.

As is true of other provinces, the official language in Fujian is Mandarin, which is used for communication between people of different localities, although native Fujian peoples still converse in their native languages and dialects respectively.

Several regions of Fujian have their own form of Chinese opera. Min opera is popular around Fuzhou; Gaojiaxi around Jinjiang and Quanzhou; Xiangju around Zhangzhou; Fujian Nanqu throughout the south, and Puxianxi around Putian and Xianyou County.

Fujian cuisine, with an emphasis on seafood, is one of the eight great traditions of Chinese cuisine. It is composed of traditions from various regions, including Fuzhou cuisine and Min Nan cuisine. The most prestigious dish is Fotiaoqiang (literally &quot;Buddha jumps over the wall&quot;), a complex dish making use of many ingredients, including shark fin, sea cucumber, abalone and Shaoxing wine (a type of Chinese alcoholic beverage).

Many well-known teas originate from Fujian, including oolong, Wuyi Yancha, Lapsang souchong and Fuzhou jasmine tea. Indeed, the tea processing techniques for three major classes of tea, namely, oolong, white tea, and black tea were all developed in the province. Fujian tea ceremony is an elaborate way of preparing and serving tea. The English word &quot;tea&quot; is borrowed from Hokkien. Mandarin and Cantonese pronounce the word &quot;chá&quot;.

Nanyin is a popular form of music of Fujian.

Fuzhou bodiless lacquer ware, a noted type of lacquer ware, is noted for using a body of clay and/or plaster to form its shape; the body later removed. Fuzhou is also known for Shoushan stone carvings.

==Tourism==
Fujian is home to several tourist attractions, including four UNESCO World Heritage Sites, one of the highest in China.

=== Cultural features ===
The Fujian Tulou are Chinese rural dwellings unique to the Hakka in southwest Fujian. These 46 buildings were listed by the UNESCO as one of the World Heritage Sites in 2008.

Gulangyu Island, Xiamen, is notable for its beaches, winding lanes, and rich architecture. The island is on China&#x27;s list of National Scenic Spots and is classified as a 5A tourist attraction by the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA). It was listed by the UNESCO as one of the World Heritage Site in 2017. Also in Xiamen is the South Putuo Temple.

The Guanghua Temple is a Buddhist temple in Putian. It was built in the penultimate year of the Southern Chen dynasty. Located in the northern half of the mouth of Meizhou Bay, it is about 1.8 nautical miles from the mainland and faces the Strait of Taiwan to the southeast.

=== Natural features ===
Mount Taimu is a mountain and a scenic resort in Fuding. It offers a grand view of mountains and sea and is famous for its natural scenery including granite caves, odd-shaped stones, cliffs, clear streams, cascading waterfalls, and cultural attractions such as ancient temples and cliff Inscriptions.

The Danxia landform in Taining was listed by the UNESCO as one of the World Heritage Sites in 2010. It is a unique type of petrographic geomorphology found in China. Danxia landform is formed from red-coloured sandstones and conglomerates of largely Cretaceous age. The landforms look very much like karst topography that forms in areas underlain by limestones, but since the rocks that form danxia are sandstones and conglomerates, they have been called &quot;pseudo-karst&quot; landforms. They were formed by endogenous forces (including uplift) and exogenous forces (including weathering and erosion).

The Wuyi Mountains was the first location in Fujian to be listed by UNESCO as one of the World Heritage Sites in 1999. They are a mountain range in the prefecture of Nanping and contain the highest peak in Fujian, Mount Huanggang. It is famous as a natural landscape garden and a summer resort in China.

<text>The Internet Oracle (historically known as The Usenet Oracle) is an effort at collective humor in a pseudo-Socratic question-and-answer format.

A user sends a question (&quot;tellme&quot;) to the Oracle via e-mail, or the Internet Oracle website, and it is sent to another user (another &quot;incarnation&quot; of the Oracle) who may answer it. Meanwhile, the original questioner is also sent a question to answer. All exchanges are conducted through a central distribution system which makes all users anonymous. Unanswered questions are returned to the queue after a day or two. Users may also request (&quot;askme&quot;) unanswered questions without posing their own.

A completed question-and-answer pair is called an &quot;Oracularity&quot;.

== Style ==

A representative (and famous) exchange is:
:&quot;The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply.&quot;
:&quot;Your question was:&quot;
:&quot;&gt; Why is a cow?&quot;
:&quot;And in response, thus spake the Oracle:&quot;
:&quot;} Mu.&quot;

Many of the Oracularities contain Zen references and witty wordplay. &quot;Geek&quot; humor is also common, though less common than in the early years of the Oracle&#x27;s existence, when fewer casual home computer users had Internet access. Most Oracularities are significantly longer than the above example, and they sometimes take the form of rambling narratives, poems, top-ten lists, spoofing of interactive fiction games, or anything else that can be put into plain text.

A complex Oracle mythos has also evolved around the figure of an omniscient, anthropomorphic, geeky deity and a host of grovelling priests and attendants. Other staples in conversation with the Oracle include:

* A &quot;*ZOT*&quot; (administered with the Staff of Zot, see LART) is earned when the Oracle is irritated. *ZOT*s are something like lightning strikes and are usually fatal. Unscrupulous participants will sometimes administer undeserved *ZOT*s. The particular word &quot;*ZOT*&quot; may be a reference to the comic strip &quot;B.C.&quot; Alternatively, it may be an allusion to Walter Karig&#x27;s 1947 novel entitled &quot;Zotz!&quot;, in which a person could point at anyone or anything, say &quot;Zotz!&quot; and make that thing or person instantly disintegrate.
* Woodchuck questions are a sure way to earn a *ZOT*. The Oracle will often censor the word &quot;woodchuck&quot; as &quot;w..dch.ck&quot; or simply refer to it obliquely (&quot;rodent of unusual size&quot;). This is a reference to &quot;The Woodchuck Question&quot;: &quot;How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?&quot;, which in the early days of the Usenet Oracle, was over-asked to the point of being a cliché.
* Traditionally, questions to the Oracle open with a suitable grovel such as &quot;High and Mighty Oracle, please answer my most humble question,&quot; although grovels are often very creative and can be very long, or even part of the question.
* Answers from the Oracle traditionally contain a request for payment such as &quot;You owe the Oracle a rubber chicken and a Cadillac.&quot; This segment, often called the &quot;YOTO line&quot; (for &quot;You owe the Oracle&quot;) or tribute, often refers to objects that are related, in a punny way, to the answer they are a part of.

An assorted mythos of recurring characters—or in-jokes—has accumulated over the years. These include the worthless High Priest Zadoc (sometimes with an assistant named Kendai), the Oracle&#x27;s girlfriend Lisa the &quot;Net.Sex.Goddess&quot;, an assortment of deities, and the caveman figure Og.

== Administration, Digests, and the Priesthood ==

The Oracularities are compiled into periodic digests by a team of volunteer &quot;priests&quot;, who read every Oracularity and select what they consider the best. These are posted to the Usenet newsgroup codice_1, the Oracle website, and also distributed via e-mailing list.

Now, the forum is basically about asking silly questions to get silly answers; consequently questions meant for libelous intent, questions of a sexual nature, and serious questions are not apt to this forum (although an exception may be made when a serious question is given a particularly silly or funny answer). An especially adept incarnation may occasionally deal with such questions in keeping with the forum—absurdly, perhaps masking the truth, perhaps framing the truth from an absurd viewpoint, or perhaps resorting to nothing but demanding an absurd tribute.

== Usenet discussion group ==

There is a usenet group, news:rec.humor.oracle.d, which is populated by a variety of participants in the Internet Oracle. The group is rife with TOIJs (&quot;tired old in-jokes&quot;), obscure references and dry humor. This is probably the only group on multicast e-mail systems of any sort where &quot;OT:...&quot; means &quot;on&quot; topic.

== Origins ==

Peter Langston is credited with the initial idea for an Oracle program. In 1976, he wrote one which ran at the Harvard Science Center&#x27;s Unix time-sharing system. He then distributed the program via the PSL Games Tape to Unix installations around the world until 1988.

In 1989, Lars Huttar was told about Langston&#x27;s Oracle by a friend at college. Not knowing where to obtain a copy, he wrote his own version of the program, which only worked when users were logged into the same computer. Huttar posted the source code to the Usenet group alt.sources in August.

Steve Kinzler, who was a graduate student and system administrator at Indiana University, downloaded Huttar&#x27;s code that same year. He deployed it as the Usenet Oracle on a university server and it became popular. Ray Moody, a graduate student at Purdue University, enhanced the program to allow access via e-mail. This allowed anyone on the Internet to use the Oracle. Kinzler installed this version on another Indiana University computer, where it resided until 2014. It was renamed the Internet Oracle in March 1996.

Kinzler has since made further enhancements, the most prominent being the &quot;priests&quot; choosing Oracularities for irregularly published digests. He provides a server to host the Oracle program, its web site, and archives.

<text>Megatherium ( ; from Greek () &#x27;great&#x27; + () &#x27;beast&#x27;) is an extinct genus of ground sloths endemic to South America that lived from the Early Pliocene through the end of the Late Pleistocene. It is best known for the elephant-sized type species Megatherium americanum, primarily known from the Pampas, but ranging southwards to northernmost Patagonia and northwards to southern Bolivia during the late Middle Pleistocene and Late Pleistocene. Various other species belonging to the subgenus &quot;Pseudomegatherium&quot; ranging in size comparable to considerably smaller than &quot;M. americanum&quot; are known from the Andean region.

The first (holotype) specimen of &quot;Megatherium&quot; was discovered in 1787 on the bank of the Luján River in what is now northern Argentina. The specimen was then shipped to Spain the following year wherein it caught the attention of the French paleontologist Georges Cuvier, who named the animal in 1796 and was the first to determine, by means of comparative anatomy, that &quot;Megatherium&quot; was a giant sloth.

&quot;Megatherium&quot; is part of the sloth family Megatheriidae, which also includes the closely related and similarly giant &quot;Eremotherium&quot;, comparable in size to &quot;M. americanum,&quot; which was native to tropical South America, Central America and North America as far north as the southern United States.

&quot;Megatherium americanum&quot; is thought to have been a browser that fed on the foliage and twigs of trees and shrubs using a black rhinoceros–like prehensile upper lip. Despite its large body size, &quot;Megatherium americanum&quot; is widely thought to have been able to adopt a bipedal posture at least while standing, which allowed it to feed on high-growing leaves, as well as possibly to use its claws for defense.

&quot;Megatherium&quot; became extinct around 12,000 years ago as part of the end-Pleistocene extinction event, simultaneously with the majority of other large mammals in the Americas. The extinctions followed the first arrival of humans in the Americas, and one and potentially multiple kill sites where &quot;M. americanum&quot; was slaughtered and butchered is known, suggesting that hunting could have been a factor in its extinction.

== Research history ==
The earliest specimen of &quot;Megatherium americanum&quot; was discovered in 1787 by Manuel de Torres, a Dominican friar and naturalist, from a ravine on the banks of the Lujan River in what is now northern Argentina, which at the time was part of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata in the Spanish Empire. Torres described the bones as a ‘wonder and providence of the Lord’. On the orders of the then viceroy of la Plata, Nicolás Cristóbal del Campo, Marqués de Loreto, the specimen was moved to the capital Buenos Aires. There the skeleton was drawn for the first time by José Custodio Sáa y Faria in a horse-like posture. Campo summoned a number of local indigenous leaders to ask if they had heard of the animal. The skeleton was then transferred by Campo to the Royal Cabinet of Natural History of Madrid (now the National Museum of Natural Sciences MNCN) in 7 crates, which had arrived and been unpacked by late 1788.

At the direction of the cabinets main taxidermist Juan Bautista Bru, the specimen was then mounted for public exhibition (which remains unaltered in the modern museum display). In 1796 a scientific description of the skeleton was published authored by Bru along with engineer Joseph Garriga, with engravings by Manuel Navarro. As the work was going through the process of publication in 1795, preliminary prints of the paper were obtained by French diplomat Philippe-Rose Roume who was in Madrid at the time, who sent them to the National Museum of Natural History (&quot;Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle&quot;) in Paris, France, where they were seen by French anatomist and paleontologist Georges Cuvier.

Cuvier, working solely from the prints from Madrid and not visiting the specimen personally, and using comparative anatomy with &quot;edentate&quot; mammals (now recognised as members of the order Xenarthra) in the collection of the Paris museum, correctly recognised that the remains represented those of a giant sloth, and an animal that was entirely extinct and not living. In early 1796, somewhat before the full publication of the work by Bru, Garriga and Navarro, Cuvier published a paper naming the species &quot;Megatherium americanum&quot; (literally &quot;Great American beast&quot;), becoming the first fossil mammal to be identified with both a genus and species name. Which description had priority has been controversial in the past. Cuvier later wrote a fuller description in 1804, which was republished in his famous 1812 book &quot;Recherches sur les ossemens fossiles de quadrupèdes.&quot; Cuvier identified &quot;Megatherium&quot; as a sloth primarily on the basis of its skull morphology, the dental formula and the shoulder, while regarding the anatomy of its limbs as more similar to armadillos and anteaters. Cuvier suggested that based on the proportions of its limbs (which are approximately equal to each other), that &quot;Megatherium&quot; did not jump or run, nor crawl like living sloths, with the presence of a clavicle and well developed crests on the humerus, suggesting to Cuvier that the animal probably used its forelimbs to grasp. A later publication in 1823 by Cuvier suggested that giant carapaces found in the Pampas also belonged to &quot;Megatherium&quot;, but British paleontologist Richard Owen in 1839 demonstrated that these actually belonged to another extinct group of xenarthrans called glyptodonts that were related to armadillos.

Additional remains of &quot;Megatherium&quot; were collected by Charles Darwin during the Voyage of the Beagle in the 1830s, these remains were assigned by Richard Owen in 1840 to the species &quot;Megatherium cuvieri&quot;, which had been named by Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest in 1822. These remains are now assigned to &quot;M. americanum.&quot;Owen later wrote a monograph series from 1851 to 1860 thoroughly describing the anatomy of &quot;M. americanum.&quot;

From the late 19th century onward additional species of &quot;Megatherium&quot; were described. In 1888 Argentine explorer Francisco Moreno erected the species &quot;Megatherium filholi&quot; for remains found in the Late Pleistocene of Argentina.&quot;&quot; In 1880 Paul Gervais and Florentino Ameghino described the species &quot;M. tarijense&quot; from remains of Pleistocene age found in Bolivia. In 1893 Rodolfo Amando Philippi erected the species &quot;M. sundti&quot; and &quot;M. medinae&quot; from remains found in the Pleistocene of Bolivia and Chile, respectively. In 1921, Florentino&#x27;s brother Carlos Ameghino and Lucas Kraglievich described the species &quot;Megatherium gallardoi&quot; based on remains found in the Pampas of Northern Argentina, of Early-Middle Pleistocene age. In 2001, the species &quot;M. altiplanicum&quot; was described based on remains found in the Pliocene of Bolivia. In 2004, the species &quot;Megatherium urbinai&quot; was erected based on remains found in Pleistocene aged deposits in Peru. In 2006, the species &quot;Megatherium celendinense&quot; was erected for remains of Pleistocene age found in the Peruvian Andes.

== Taxonomy and evolution ==
&quot;Megatherium&quot; is divided into 2 subgenera, &quot;Megatherium&quot; and &quot;Pseudomegatherium.&quot; Taxonomy according to Pujos (2006) and De Iuliis &quot;et al&quot; (2009):

* Subgenus &quot;Megatherium&quot;
** †&quot;M. altiplanicum&quot; 
** †&quot;M. americanum&quot; 
** &quot;†M. gallardoi&quot; 
*Subgenus &quot;Pseudomegatherium&quot; 
** †&quot;M. celendinense&quot; 
** †&quot;M. medinae&quot; 
** †&quot;M. sundti&quot; 
** †&quot;M. tarijense&quot; 
** †&quot;M. urbinai&quot; 
&quot;Megatherium gallardoi&quot; from the Pampas dating to the Early to Middle Pleistocene has sometimes been regarded as a synonym of &quot;M. americanum&quot;. The species &quot;Megatherium filholi&quot; also from the Pleistocene of the Pampas region, historically regarded to be a junior synonym of &quot;M. americanum&quot; representing juvenile individuals has been suggested to be valid by some recent authors. &quot;Megatherium gaudryi&quot; from Argentina, of uncertain temporal provenance but possibly Pliocene in age, may also be valid.

Mitochondrial DNA sequences obtained from &quot;M. americanum&quot; indicates that three-toed sloths (&quot;Bradypus&quot;) are their closest living relatives. Phylogeny of sloths after Delsuc et al. 2019.

Megatheriidae is suggested to have diverged from other sloth families during the Oligocene, around 30 million years ago. The subfamily to which &quot;Megatherium&quot; belongs, Megatheriinae, first appeared in the Middle Miocene in Patagonia, at least 12 million years ago, represented by the genus &quot;Megathericulus&quot;. The earliest known remains of the genus &quot;Megatherium&quot; are known from the Pliocene, found in Bolivia (&quot;M. altiplanicum&quot;) and the Pampas (indeterminate species), dating to at least 3.6 million years ago. &quot;M. altiplanicum&quot; is suggested to be more closely related to &quot;M. americanum&quot; than to species of &quot;Pseudomegatherium&quot;. Phylogeny of Megatheriinae after Pujos, 2006:
&quot;Megatherium americanum&quot; first appears in the fossil record during the second half of the Middle Pleistocene, from around 400,000 years ago.

== Description ==

=== Size ===

&quot;M. americanum&quot; is one of the largest known ground sloths, with a total body length of around . Volumetric analysis suggests that a full grown &quot;M. americanum&quot; weighed around , comparable to an Asian elephant. The Late Pleistocene Andean-Altiplano &quot;Pseudomegatherium&quot; species &quot;Megatherium celendinense&quot; was likely comparable in size. These species were only rivalled in size amongst ground sloths by the closely related &quot;Eremotherium&quot; and the distantly related &quot;Lestodon&quot;. The Chilean &quot;Pseudomegatherium&quot; species &quot;M. sundti&quot; was much smaller, with an estimated body mass of only , with the Peruvian &quot;Megatherium urbinai,&quot; Bolivian &quot;Megatherium tarijense&quot; and the Chilean &quot;Megatherium medinae&quot; (all also belonging to &quot;Pseudomegatherium&quot;) also having a considerably smaller body size than &quot;M. americanum.&quot; The Pliocene &quot;Megatherium&quot; (&quot;Megatherium&quot;) species &quot;M. altiplanicum&quot; has been estimated to weigh .

=== Skull and jaws ===

The head of &quot;Megatherium&quot; is relatively small compared to body size. The skull is roughly cylindrical in shape, with the cranial region of the skull being narrow. The jugal bone of &quot;M. americanum&quot; has strongly developed ascending and descending processes. The skull of &quot;M. americanum&quot; has a relatively small cranial cavity (and thus brain) relative to skull size, with the skull having extensive sinus spaces. In many species of &quot;Megatherium&quot;, the lower jaw is relatively deep, which served to accommodate the very long hypselodont (evergrowing) teeth, which are considerably proportionally longer than those of other ground sloths. Like other ground sloths, the number of teeth in the jaw is reduced to 5 and 4 teeth in each half of the upper and lower jaws, respectively, and the teeth lack enamel. The teeth of &quot;Megatherium americanum&quot; have sharp crests separated by v-shaped valleys, which interlock with the teeth on the opposing jaw. These teeth were self-sharpening, akin to rodent incisors. The skull of &quot;M. americanum&quot; has a relatively narrow snout/muzzle with a ossified nasal septum, and is suggested to have had a thick prehensile upper lip, similar to that of the living black rhinoceros, which compensated for the lack of teeth at the front of the jaws. The morphology of the hyoid bones in &quot;Megatherium&quot; suggests that they were relatively rigid, this along with the short distance between the hyoid and the mandibular symphysis (the joint connecting the two halves of the lower jaw) suggests that the tongue had limited ability to protrude, and thus &quot;Megatherium&quot; did not have a long prehensile tongue, contrary to what was often historically suggested. The skull and jaws of &quot;M. americanum&quot; show adaptation to powerful vertical biting. &quot;M. americanum&quot; and &quot;M. altiplanicum&quot; are distinguished from species of the subgenus &quot;Pseudomegatherium&quot; by the fusion of the maxilla and premaxilla, while members of &quot;Pseudomegatherium&quot; are distinguished from those species by their flat occipital condyles.

=== Axial skeleton ===
Like other xenarthrans, the posterior trunk vertebrae of &quot;Megatherium americanum&quot; have additional xenarthrous processes that articulate with the other vertebrae. The ischium was connected to the caudal vertebrae. The caudal vertebrae were combined into a synsacrum. The sacrum was composed of 5 vertebrae. The pubic symphysis is reduced. The tail is large in size.

=== Limbs ===

The bones of the forelimbs of &quot;M. americanum&quot; are relatively slender. The three fingers in the middle of the hand bore claws, while the cuneiform hand bones did not touch the ulna. The olecranon process of the ulna was relatively short. Like other xenarthrans, but unlike most other mammals, &quot;Megatherium&quot; possesses clavicles (collarbones), which serves to support the forelimb. Like other sloths, the clavicle is merged with the acromion of the scapula. The femur was massive and roughly rectangular in shape. As in most megatheriines, the tibia and fibula of &quot;Megatherium&quot; species are fused together at their proximal (closest to hip) end, while in &quot;M. americanum&quot; and &quot;M. tarijense&quot;, they are also fused together at their distal (closest to foot) ends. The foot was heavily modified from those of other mammals and earlier ground sloths, with a reduction in the number of digits on the inner part of the foot (digits I and II being lost), the increase in the size and robustness (thickness) of the metapodial elements of the outer digits, with the loss or reduction of the phalangeal bones. The calcaneum is wide and elongate posteriorly. The foot is suggested to have been inwardly rotated, historically the foot was suggested to be near vertical, though a recent study suggests that the angle was much shallower. The weight was primarily borne on the outer digits and the calcaneum. &quot;M. urbinai&quot; differs from &quot;M. americanum&quot; and other &quot;Megatherium&quot; species in the shape and position of the feet and hand bones, including the metacarpals, metatarsals, ectocuneiform, hamate/unciform, navicular and astragalus/talus.

== Ecology ==

Remains of &quot;Megatherium americanum&quot; have been found in low elevation areas to the east of the Andes mountains in northern Patagonia, the Pampas and adjacent areas in what is now northern Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, southern Bolivia and Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil. &quot;Megatherium americanum&quot; inhabited temperate, arid-to semi arid open habitats. During the Last Glacial Period, the Pampas was generally drier than it is at present with many areas exhibiting a steppe-like environment dominated by grass, with some areas of woodland.

Although some authors have suggested that &quot;Megatherium&quot; was an omnivore, isotopic analysis has supported an entirely herbivorous diet for &quot;Megatherium&quot;. &quot;Megatherium americanum&quot; is suggested to have been a browser that was a selective feeder on the foliage, twigs and fruits of trees and shrubs. The sharp cusps of the teeth served to shear plant material. &quot;Megatherium&quot; is widely thought to have been able to adopt a bipedal posture to use its forelimbs to grasp vegetation, though whether it was capable of moving in this posture is uncertain. Analysis of injuries on the clavicles of &quot;M. americanum&quot; individuals suggests that the species probably habitually moved in a quadrupedal posture and assumed a bipedal posture next to trees to feed on high-growing leaves, likely using its forelimbs to brace itself against the tree trunk, as well as to pull down higher branches within reach of its prehensile lip. Isotopic analysis suggests that some individuals of &quot;M. americanum&quot; at certain times and places also consumed grass. The smaller &quot;Megatherium tarijense&quot; has been suggested to have had a mixed feeding-browsing diet. Preserved coprolites attributed to &quot;Megatherium&quot; suggests that its diet included plants like &quot;Fabiana&quot;, &quot;Ephedra&quot; &quot;(Ephedra breana&quot;), beebrush, &quot;Junellia&quot;, and &quot;Chuquiraga&quot;.

Whether or not &quot;Megatherium&quot; had a slow metabolism like living tree sloths is uncertain. Analysis of the nutrient foramina in the diaphysis (shaft) of the femur of &quot;Megatherium americanum&quot; shows that they are more similar to those of other large living mammals like elephants than living tree sloths, which may suggest that it had a metabolism more similar to non-xenarthran mammals and was capable of vigorous activity similar to living elephants. However, isotopic analysis of teeth suggests that &quot;Megatherium&quot; had a somewhat lower body temperature than non-xenarthran mammals, around , comparable to that of living tree sloths, implying a lower metabolic rate. &quot;Megatherium americanum&quot; has been traditionally reconstructed as being covered with a thick coat of fur. Due to its very large body size, some authors have alternatively argued that &quot;Megatherium americanum&quot; was probably hairless like modern elephants for thermodynamic reasons. However this has been disputed, with other authors suggesting based on thermodynamic modelling assuming a living xenarthran-like metabolism that &quot;Megatherium&quot; species probably had a dense coat of fur around thick to be able to tolerate the relatively cool environments they inhabited.

Based on fossil trackways and the anatomy of its inner ear, which is considerably different from living sloths and more similar to those of armadillos, species of &quot;Megatherium&quot;, while probably not capable of moving at considerable speed due to limitations of their skeletal anatomy (with one study estimating a max speed of approximately or , a fraction of the or top speed observed for living elephants) were likely significantly more agile and mobile than living sloths, which are only capable of moving . Species of &quot;Megatherium&quot; likely relied on their large adult body size to protect themselves against predators. Like many other large mammals, &quot;Megatherium&quot; is suggested to have had a slow life cycle in accordance with a K-selection strategy. &quot;Megatherium americanum&quot; is suggested to have given birth to a single large offspring at a time.

The anatomy of its forelimb bones suggests that &quot;M. americanum&quot; had the ability to rapidly and powerfully extend its arms, which likely made its claws effective stabbing weapons. It may have used its claws like this to defend itself, as living tree sloths do. Although some authors in the 19th century suggested that &quot;Megatherium&quot; engaged in digging behaviour, this has been disputed by other scholars, and the morphology of its limb bones do not appear to display significant adaptations to digging unlike some ground sloths such as mylodontids.

In the Pampas, &quot;Megatherium americanum&quot; lived alongside other megafauna species, including the large ground sloth &quot;Lestodon&quot;, along with the smaller (but still large) ground sloths &quot;Mylodon&quot;, &quot;Glossotherium,&quot; and &quot;Scelidotherium&quot;, the glyptodonts (very large armadillos with fused round carapaces covering the body) &quot;Glyptodon&quot;, &quot;Doedicurus&quot;, and &quot;Panochthus&quot;, the large camel-like ungulate &quot;Macrauchenia&quot; and rhinoceros-like &quot;Toxodon&quot;, the gomphothere (elephant-relative) &quot;Notiomastodon&quot;, the equines &quot;Hippidion&quot; and &quot;Equus neogeus&quot;, the large short-faced bear &quot;Arctotherium&quot;, and the large sabertooth cat &quot;Smilodon.&quot; The range of &quot;Megatherium americanum&quot; overlaps little with its similarly sized tropical relative &quot;Eremotherium,&quot; with their co-occurrence only confidently reported from a few localities in Southern Brazil, and it is unclear whether they were contemporary at these localities.

== Relationship with humans and extinction ==
During the Late Pleistocene, six species of &quot;Megatherium&quot; were present in South America, including &quot;M. americanum&quot; in the Pampas and adjacent regions, and the 5 species of &quot;Pseudomegatherium&quot; in the vicinity of the Andes.&quot;&quot;

The youngest unambiguous dates for &quot;Megatherium&quot; are from the end of the Late Pleistocene. Supposed early Holocene dates obtained for &quot;Megatherium americanum&quot; and other Pampas megafauna have been questioned, with suggestions that they are likely due to humic acid contamination of the collagen used to radiocarbon date the bones. &quot;Megatherium&quot; disappeared simultaneously along with the vast majority (&gt;80%) of other large (megafaunal) South American mammals, as part of the end-Pleistocene extinction event. The use of bioclimatic envelope modeling indicates that the area of suitable habitat for &quot;Megatherium&quot; had shrunk and become fragmented by the mid-Holocene. While this alone would not likely have caused its extinction, it has been cited as a possible contributing factor.

Towards the end of the Late Pleistocene, humans first arrived in the Americas, with some of the earliest evidence of humans in South America being the Monte Verde II site in Chile, dating to around 14,500 years Before Present (~12,500 BC). The extinction interval of &quot;Megatherium&quot; and other megafauna coincides with the appearance and abundance of Fishtail points, which are suggested to have been used to hunt megafauna, across the Pampas region and South America more broadly. At the Paso Otero 5 site in the Pampas of northeast Argentina, Fishtail points are associated with burned bones of &quot;Megatherium americanum&quot; and other extinct megafauna. The bones appear to have been deliberately burned as a source of fuel. Due to the poor preservation of the bones there is no clear evidence of human modification.

There is evidence for the butchery of &quot;Megatherium&quot; by humans. Two &quot;M. americanum&quot; bones, an ulna and an atlas vertebra, from separate collections, bear cut marks suggestive of butchery, with the latter suggested to represent an attempt to exploit the contents of the head. A kill site dating to around 12,600 years Before Present (BP), is known from Campo Laborde in the Pampas in Argentina, where a single individual of &quot;M. americanum&quot; was slaughtered and butchered at the edge of a swamp, which is the only confirmed giant ground-sloth kill site in the Americas. At the site several stone tools were present, including the fragment of a projectile point. Another possible kill site is Arroyo Seco 2 near Tres Arroyos in the Pampas in Argentina, where &quot;M. americanum&quot; bones amongst those of other megafauna were found associated with human artifacts dating to approximately 14,782–11,142 cal yr BP. This hunting may have been a factor in its extinction.

== Cultural references ==

The &quot;Megatherium Club&quot;, named for the extinct animal and founded by William Stimpson, was a group of Washington, D.C.–based scientists who were attracted to that city by the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s rapidly growing collection, from 1857 to 1866.

<text>The reticulated python (Malayopython reticulatus) is a python species native to South and Southeast Asia. It is the world&#x27;s longest snake, and the third heaviest after the green anaconda and Burmese python. It is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List because of its wide distribution. In several countries in its range, it is hunted for its skin, for use in traditional medicine, and for sale as pets. Due to this, reticulated pythons are one of the most economically important reptiles worldwide.

It is an excellent swimmer, has been reported far out at sea, and has colonized many small islands within its range.

Like all pythons, it is a non-venomous constrictor. In very rare cases, adult humans have been killed (and in at least six reported cases, eaten) by reticulated pythons.

==Taxonomy==
The reticulated python was first described in 1801 by German naturalist Johann Gottlob Theaenus Schneider, who described two zoological specimens held by the Göttingen Museum in 1801 that differed slightly in colour and pattern as separate species—&quot;Boa reticulata&quot; and &quot;Boa rhombeata&quot;. The specific name, &quot;reticulatus&quot;, is Latin meaning &quot;net-like&quot;, or , and is a reference to the complex color pattern. The generic name &quot;Python&quot; was proposed by French naturalist François Marie Daudin in 1803. American zoologist Arnold G. Kluge performed a cladistics analysis on morphological characters and recovered the reticulated python lineage as sister to the genus &quot;Python&quot;, hence not requiring a new generic name in 1993.

In a 2004 genetics study using cytochrome b DNA, and colleagues discovered the reticulated python as sister to Australo-Papuan pythons, rather than &quot;Python molurus&quot; and relatives. Raymond Hoser erected the genus &quot;Broghammerus&quot; for the reticulated python in 2004, naming it after German snake expert Stefan Broghammer, on the basis of dorsal patterns distinct from those of the genus &quot;Python&quot;, and a dark mid-dorsal line from the rear to the front of the head, and red or orange (rather than brown) iris colour. In 2008, Lesley H. Rawlings and colleagues reanalysed Kluge&#x27;s morphological data and combined it with genetic material, finding the reticulated clade to be an offshoot of the Australo-Papuan lineage as well. They adopted and redefined the genus name &quot;Broghammerus&quot;.

Most taxonomists choose to ignore &quot;Broghammerus&quot; and other names by Hoser as its description lacked scientific rigour and was not published in a reputable journal. and colleagues accordingly proposed the name &quot;Malayopython&quot; for this species and its sister species, the Timor python. &quot;Malayopython&quot; has been recognized by subsequent authors and the Reptile Database. Hoser has argued that &quot;Broghammerus&quot; was validly published and &quot;Malayopython&quot; name is invalid as it is a junior synonym. In 2021, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature found no basis for regarding the name &quot;Broghammerus&quot; to be invalid. Nevertheless, the name &quot;Malayopython&quot; remains in use by reliable sources.

===Subspecies===
Three subspecies have been proposed:
* &quot;M. r. reticulatus&quot; – Asian reticulated python
* &quot;M. r. jampeanus&quot; – Kayaudi reticulated python or Tanahjampean reticulated python, about half the length, or according to Auliya et al. (2002), not reaching much more than in length. Found on Tanahjampea in the Selayar Archipelago south of Sulawesi. Closely related to &quot;M. r. reticulatus&quot; of the Lesser Sundas.
* &quot;M. r. saputrai&quot; – Selayer reticulated python, occurs on Selayar Island in the Selayar Archipelago and also in adjacent Sulawesi. This subspecies represents a sister lineage to all other populations of reticulated pythons tested. According to Auliya et al. (2002) it does not exceed in length.

The latter two are dwarf subspecies. Apparently, the population of the Sangihe Islands north of Sulawesi represents another such subspecies, which is basal to the &quot;P. r. reticulatus&quot; plus &quot;P. r. jampeanus&quot; clade, but it is not yet formally described.

The proposed subspecies &quot;M. r. &quot;dalegibbonsi&quot;&quot;, &quot;M. r. &quot;euanedwardsi&quot;&quot;, &quot;M. r. &quot;haydnmacphiei&quot;&quot;, &quot;M. r. &quot;neilsonnemani&quot;&quot;, &quot;M. r. &quot;patrickcouperi&quot;&quot;, and &quot;M. r. &quot;stuartbigmorei&quot;&quot; have not found general acceptance.

==Characteristics==

The reticulated python has smooth dorsal scales that are arranged in 69–79 rows at midbody. Deep pits occur on four anterior upper labials, on two or three anterior lower labials, and on five or six posterior lower labials.

The reticulated python is the largest snake native to Asia. More than a thousand wild reticulated pythons in southern Sumatra were studied, and estimated to have a length range of , and a weight range of . Reticulated pythons with lengths more than are rare, though according to the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, it is the only extant snake to regularly exceed that length. One of the largest scientifically measured specimens, from Balikpapan, East Kalimantan, Indonesia, was measured under anesthesia at and weighed after not having eaten for nearly 3 months.

The specimen once widely accepted as the largest-ever &quot;accurately&quot; measured snake, that being Colossus, a specimen kept at the Highland Park Zoo (now the Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, during the 1950s and early 1960s, with a peak reported length of from a measurement in November 1956, was later shown to have been substantially shorter than previously reported. When Colossus died on 14 April 1964, its body was deposited in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. At that time, its skeleton was measured and found to be in total length, and the length of its fresh hide was measured as . The hide tends to stretch from the skinning process, thus may be longer than the snake from which it came – e.g., by roughly 20–40% or more. The previous reports had been constructed by combining partial measurements with estimations to compensate for &quot;kinks&quot;, since completely straightening an extremely large live python is virtually impossible. Because of these issues, a 2012 journal article concluded, &quot;Colossus was neither the longest snake nor the heaviest snake ever maintained in captivity.&quot; Too large to be preserved with formaldehyde and then stored in alcohol, the specimen was instead prepared as a disarticulated skeleton. The hide was sent to a laboratory to be tanned, but it was either lost or destroyed, and now only the skull and selected vertebrae and ribs remain in the museum&#x27;s collection. Considerable confusion exists in the literature over whether Colossus was male or female (females tend to be larger).
Numerous reports have been made of larger snakes, but since none of these was measured by a scientist nor any of the specimens deposited at a museum, they must be regarded as unproven and possibly erroneous. In spite of what has been, for many years, a standing offer of a large financial reward (initially $1,000, later raised to $5,000, then $15,000 in 1978 and $50,000 in 1980) for a live, healthy snake or longer by the New York Zoological Society (later renamed as the Wildlife Conservation Society), no attempt to claim this reward has ever been made.

=== Reported sizes ===
The colour pattern is a complex geometric pattern that incorporates different colours. The back typically has a series of irregular diamond shapes flanked by smaller markings with light centers. In this species&#x27; wide geographic range, much variation of size, colour, and markings commonly occurs.

In zoo exhibits, the colour pattern may seem garish, but in a shadowy jungle environment amid fallen leaves and debris, it allows them to virtually disappear. Called disruptive colouration, it protects them from predators and helps them to catch their prey.

The huge size and attractive pattern of this snake has made it a favorite zoo exhibit, with several individuals claimed to be above in length and more than one claimed to be the largest in captivity. However, due to its huge size, immense strength, aggressive disposition, and the mobility of the skin relative to the body, it is very difficult to get exact length measurements of a living reticulated python, and weights are rarely indicative, as captive pythons are often obese. Claims made by zoos and animal parks are sometimes exaggerated, such as the claimed snake in Indonesia which was subsequently proven to be about long. For this reason, scientists do not accept the validity of length measurements unless performed on a dead or anesthetized snake that is later preserved in a museum collection or stored for scientific research.

A reticulated python kept in the United States in Kansas City, Missouri, named &quot;Medusa&quot; is considered by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; to be the longest living snake ever kept in captivity. In 2011 it was reported to measure and weigh .

In 2012, an albino reticulated python, named &quot;Twinkie&quot;, housed in Fountain Valley, California, was considered to be the largest albino snake in captivity by the Guinness World Records. It measured in length and weighed about .

Dwarf forms of reticulated pythons also occur, from some islands northwest of Australia, and these are being selectively bred in captivity to be much smaller, resulting in animals often referred to as &quot;super dwarfs&quot;. Adult super dwarf reticulated pythons are typically between in length.

==Distribution and habitat==

The reticulated python is found in South and Southeast Asia from the Nicobar Islands, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Singapore, east through Indonesia and the Indo-Australian Archipelago (Sumatra, the Mentawai Islands, the Natuna Islands, Borneo, Sulawesi, Java, Lombok, Sumbawa, Sumba, Flores, Timor, Maluku, Tanimbar Islands) and the Philippines (Basilan, Bohol, Cebu, Leyte, Luzon, Mindanao, Mindoro, Negros, Palawan, Panay, Polillo, Samar, Tawi-Tawi). The original description does not include a type locality. The type locality was restricted to &quot;Java&quot; by Brongersma (1972).

Three subspecies have been proposed, but are not recognized in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System. The color and size can vary a great deal among the subspecies described. Geographical location is a good key to establishing the subspecies, as each one has a distinct geographical range.

The reticulated python lives in rainforests, woodlands, and nearby grasslands. It is also associated with rivers and is found in areas with nearby streams and lakes. An excellent swimmer, it has even been reported far out at sea and has consequently colonized many small islands within its range. During the early years of the 20th century, it is said to have been common even in busy parts of Bangkok, sometimes eating domestic animals.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Diet===

As with all pythons, the reticulated python is an ambush predator, usually waiting until prey wanders within strike range before seizing it in its coils and killing by constriction. Its natural diet includes mammals and occasionally birds. Small specimens up to long eat mainly small mammals such as rats, other rodents, mouse-eared bats, and treeshrews, whereas larger individuals switch to prey such as small Indian civet and binturong, primates, pigs, and deer weighing more than . As a rule, the reticulated python seems able to swallow prey up to one-quarter its own length and up to its own weight. Near human habitation, it is known to snatch stray chickens, cats, and dogs on occasion.
Among the largest documented prey items are a half-starved sun bear of that was eaten by a specimen and took some 10 weeks to digest.
At least one case is reported of a foraging python entering a forest hut and taking a child.

===Reproduction===
The reticulated python is oviparous. Adult females lay between 15 and 80 eggs per clutch. At an optimum incubation temperature of , the eggs take an average of 88 days to hatch. Hatchlings are at least in length.

==Danger to humans==
The reticulated python is among the few snakes that prey on humans, and is the only species of snake where video and photographic proof exists of them having consumed humans. In 2015, the species was added to the Lacey Act of 1900, prohibiting import and interstate transport due to its &quot;injurious&quot; history with humans. Attacks on humans in captivity are not common. Wild pythons, however, are known to sometimes prey on humans, particularly in their natural habitat in Sulawesi, Indonesia. Considering the known maximum prey size, a full-grown reticulated python can open its jaws wide enough to swallow a human, but the width of the shoulders of some adult &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; can pose a problem for even a snake with sufficient size. Reports of human fatalities and human consumption (the latest examples of consumption of an adult human being well authenticated) include:

* A report of a visit of Antonio van Diemen, Governor-General of the Dutch East India Company, to the Banda Islands in 1638, includes a description of an enslaved woman who, when tending to a garden on the volcanic island of Gunung Api, was strangled by a snake of &quot;24 houtvoeten&quot; (slightly over seven meters) in length, and then swallowed whole. The snake, having become slow after ingesting such a large prey, was subsequently shot by Dutch soldiers and brought to the Governor-General to be looked at, with its victim still inside. Although less reliable than this first-hand document, several early published travel journals describe similar episodes.
* In early 20th-century Indonesia: On Salibabu island, North Sulawesi, a 14-year-old boy was killed and supposedly eaten by a specimen in length. Another incident involved a woman reputedly eaten by a &quot;large reticulated python&quot;, but few details are known.
* In the early 1910s or in 1927, a jeweller went hunting with his friends and was apparently eaten by a python after he sought shelter from a rainstorm in or under a tree. Supposedly, he was swallowed feet-first, perhaps the easiest way for a snake to actually swallow a human.
* Among a small group of Aeta peoples in the Philippines, six deaths by pythons were said to have been documented within a period of 40 years, plus one who died later of an infected bite.
* In September 1995, a 29-year-old rubber tapper from the southern Malaysian state of Johor was reported to have been killed by a large reticulated python. The victim had apparently been caught unaware and was squeezed to death. The snake had coiled around the lifeless body with the victim&#x27;s head gripped in its jaws when it was stumbled upon by the victim&#x27;s brother. The python, reported as measuring long and weighing more than , was killed soon after by the arriving police, who shot it four times.
* In October 2003, a woman was reported to be eaten by a giant reticulated python at Sajek Valley in Rangamati Hill District, Bangladesh, when she was collecting paddy crops with her husband. People came to help and retrieved the woman&#x27;s body from the python&#x27;s belly. 
* In October 2008, a woman from Virginia Beach appeared to have been killed by a pet reticulated python. The apparent cause of death was asphyxiation. The snake was later found in the bedroom in an agitated state.
* In January 2009, a 3-year-old boy was wrapped in the coils of a pet reticulated python, turning blue. The boy&#x27;s mother, who had been petsitting the python on behalf of a friend, rescued him by gashing the python with a knife. The snake was later euthanized because of its wounds.
* In December 2013, a 59-year-old security guard was strangled to death while trying to capture a python near the Bali Hyatt, a luxury hotel on Indonesia&#x27;s resort island. The incident happened around 3 am as the 4.5-m (15-ft) python was crossing a road near the hotel. The victim had offered to help capture the snake, which had been spotted several times before near the hotel in the Sanur, Bali, area and escaped back into nearby bushes.
*In March 2017, the body of Akbar Salubiro, a 25-year-old farmer in Central Mamuju Regency, West Sulawesi, Indonesia, was found inside the stomach of a reticulated python. He had been declared missing from his palm tree plantation, and the people searching for him found the python the next day with a large bulge in its stomach. They killed the python and found the whole body of the missing farmer inside. This was the first fully confirmed case of a person being eaten by a python. The process of retrieving the body from the python&#x27;s stomach was documented by pictures and videos taken by witnesses.
* In June 2018, a 54-year-old Indonesian woman in Muna Island, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia, was killed and eaten by a python. The woman went missing one night while working in her garden, and the next day, a search party was organized after some of her belongings were found abandoned in the garden. The python was found near the garden with a large bulge in its body. The snake was killed and carried into town, where it was cut open, revealing the woman&#x27;s body completely intact.
*In June 2020, a 16-year-old Indonesian boy was attacked and killed by a long python in Bombana Regency, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. The incident took place near a waterfall at Mount Kahar in Rumbia sub-district. The victim was separated from his four friends in the woods. When he screamed, his friends came to help and found him encoiled by a large python. Villagers came to help and managed to kill the snake using a parang machete. However, the victim had already suffocated.
*In October 2022, a 52-year-old woman in Terjun Gajah village, Betara Subdistrict, West Tanjung Jabung Regency, Jambi, Indonesia, was killed and swallowed whole by a reticulated python. She went to tap rubber sap on 23 October 2022 and did not return home after sunset. After she was reported missing for a day and a night, a search party discovered a large python with a bulge in its body in a jungle near the rubber plantation. The villagers immediately killed and dissected the python and discovered the intact body of the missing woman inside. Villagers feared more large pythons might be present because farmers previously had reported two goats missing.
*In June 2024, a woman of Kalempang village in South Sulawesi province in Indonesia went missing, and her body was discovered inside a reticulated python. 3 weeks later, in July 2024, another woman was discovered inside a python&#x27;s stomach in South Sulawesi. In August 2024, an elderly woman was found dead after a predatory attempt by a long python. The snake had killed the victim and tried to swallow her, but could not get over the shoulders, regurgitating the body instead. 2 weeks later another woman in Jambi province was killed by a python, which managed to swallow half of her body before being found and killed by the villagers. In November 2024, a 30-year-old man was killed and swallowed whole by a long specimen, the first recorded case of an adult male being eaten since 2017.

==In captivity==

Increased popularity of the reticulated python in the pet trade is due largely to increased efforts in captive breeding and selectively bred mutations such as the &quot;albino&quot; and &quot;tiger&quot; strains. Other notable color mutations recorded in this species include &quot;sunfire&quot;, &quot;motley&quot;, &quot;Aztec&quot;, &quot;ocelot&quot;, &quot;rainbow&quot;, and &quot;goldenchild&quot;. Some mutations, such as the &quot;BEL&quot; (black eyed leucistic) mutations are seldom bred due the discovery that they develop fatal gastrointestinal issues upon reaching adulthood. The &quot;jaguar&quot; color mutation is likewise controversial in the breeding of captive reticulated pythons, as certain specimens will develop neurological and osseous inner ears, similar to the &quot;Spider&quot; mutation that occurs in the ball python. It remains unclear as to why some individual pythons with the jaguar mutation display neurological issues associated with this genetic trait and others do not. 

Smaller animals such as the proposed &quot;super dwarf&quot; subspecies found on small islands are likewise popular due to their smaller size, as they grow to a fraction of the lengths and weights of their mainland kin due to genetics, limited space and prey availability. Dwarf and super dwarf reticulated pythons are likewise defined for captive animals as any reticulated pythons with at least 50 percent lineage hailing from seven select islands in the Selayer island chain near Sulawesi. It can make a good captive, but keepers working with adults from mainland populations should have previous experience with large constrictors to ensure safety to both animal and keeper. Although its interactivity and beauty draws much attention, some feel it is unpredictable. The python can bite and possibly constrict if it feels threatened, or mistakes a hand for food. While not venomous, large pythons can inflict serious injuries by biting, sometimes requiring stitches.

<text>A rock opera is a collection of rock music songs with lyrics that relate to a common story. Rock operas are typically released as concept albums and are not scripted for acting, which distinguishes them from operas, although several have been adapted as rock musicals. The use of various character roles within the song lyrics is a common storytelling device. The success of the rock opera genre has inspired similar works in other musical styles, such as rap opera.

== History ==
A number of rock artists became interested in the idea of creating a rock opera in the 1960s. Early use of the terms rock opera and teenage opera date from 1963, when Frank Zappa used both phrases to describe a work in progress, &quot;I Was a Teenage Malt Shop&quot;. Zappa can be heard discussing his rock opera in a radio program: a recording of a which is included on the album &quot;Joe&#x27;s Xmasage&quot;, on the track &quot;The Uncle Frankie Show&quot;. Don Van Vliet was to be cast as a character named “Captain Beefheart”. Zappa abandoned the project in 1964 after a demo tape with a few of the songs was rejected by a record company. Several songs that were written for the uncompleted opera appeared on later albums (e.g. &quot;I Was a Teen-age Malt Shop&quot; on the album &quot;Mystery Disc&quot;, &quot;Status Back Baby&quot; on the album &quot;Absolutely Free&quot;). Zappa later wrote and produced &quot;Joe’s Garage&quot; in 1979.

Another early use of the term, the July 4, 1966, edition of &quot;RPM Magazine&quot; (published in Toronto) reported that &quot;Bruce Cockburn and Mr [William] Hawkins are working on a Rock Opera, operating on the premise that to write you need only &#x27;something to say&#x27;.&quot; Mark Wirtz explored the idea in a project &quot;A Teenage Opera&quot;, from which an early song &quot;Excerpt from A Teenage Opera (Grocer Jack)&quot; recorded by Keith West was released and became a hit song in 1967. However, the album for the rock opera was not released until 1996, and it was only fully realised and staged in 2017.

Colin Fleming of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; described &quot;The Story of Simon Simopath&quot; (1967) by British psychedelic band Nirvana as an &quot;early foray into the rock opera sub-genre&quot;. Neil Strauss of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;S.F. Sorrow&quot; (1968) by the Pretty Things is &quot;generally acknowledged as the first rock opera&quot;.

Scott Mervis of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; wrote that the Who&#x27;s 1969 record &quot;Tommy&quot; was the first album to be billed as a rock opera. The album tells the story of Tommy Walker, a &quot;deaf, dumb and blind kid.&quot; &quot;Tommy&quot; displays the titular character&#x27;s experiences with life and his relationship with his family. Although the band&#x27;s guitarist Pete Townshend denied taking any influence from &quot;S.F. Sorrow&quot;, critics have compared &quot;Tommy&quot; to it. The &quot;Tommy&quot; album developed into other media, including a Seattle Opera production in 1971, an orchestral version by Lou Reizner in 1972, a film in 1975, and a Broadway musical in 1992. The original album has sold 20 million copies and has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. &quot;Tommy&quot; would also go on to influence &quot;On and On&quot;, a rap opera by the Fat Boys and &quot;American Idiot&quot;, a punk rock opera by Green Day, the latter of whom having made &quot;21st Century Breakdown&quot;, another rock opera. The Who had previously toyed with the concepts which would lead to the full-blown rock opera with their six-movement 1966 track &quot;A Quick One, While He&#x27;s Away&quot;.

A rock opera that experienced commercial recording and Broadway success is &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (1970), written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, and in respect of which Lloyd Webber said &quot;the piece was written as a rock album from the outset and set out from the start to tell the story through the music itself.&quot; In 1972, David Bowie released the rock opera &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot;.

&quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; is a rock album by Meat Loaf that remains one of the best-selling albums of all time, having sold over 50 million copies worldwide. It is certified 14× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). As of June 2019, it has spent 522 weeks in the UK Albums Chart, the second longest chart run by a studio album. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it at number 343 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. A musical based on &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, staged by Jay Scheib, opened at the Manchester Opera House in 2017. The album&#x27;s producer, Jim Steinman, coined the term Wagnerian rock after composer Richard Wagner to describe the genre of the record.

Perhaps the archetypal and most famous rock opera is &quot;The Wall&quot;, a double album released by Pink Floyd in 1979. &quot;The Wall&quot; chronicles the story of Pink, a character who ultimately constructs an emotional wall to protect himself after being driven into insanity as a result of traumatic life experiences. The album was included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s lists of the greatest albums of all time in 2003, 2012, and 2020. James Guthrie, the album&#x27;s engineer, won the 1980 Grammy award for Best Engineered Recording (non-classical), and the album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The album was subsequently made into a 1982 film entitled &quot;Pink Floyd – The Wall&quot;. An elaborate 1980-1981 concert tour was conducted by the band after the album&#x27;s release and bassist Roger Waters reincarnated the tour twice; once in Berlin in 1990 to commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall and again around the world from 2010-2013, a series of shows that became the highest-grossing tour by a solo musician. 

In 1999, progressive metal band Dream Theater released their album &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory&quot;, which has been regarded as Rock Opera. The album tells the story of Nicholas, a man getting flashbacks from a previous life, as he undergoes hypnosis sessions to recall the memories of Victoria, a young girl who he discovers was murdered as a violent result of a love affair.

In an effort to appeal to more modern audiences, opera companies have welcomed more pop and rock influences. The resulting rock operas have met varying degrees of success as the worlds of high art and low art mix. In Russian music, the term &quot;zong-opera&quot; (Зонг-опера) is sometimes used, since the first Soviet-Russian rock-opera &quot;Orpheus and Eurydice&quot; was described with this term, though the term &quot;rock-opera&quot; was already known in the Soviet rock music circles.

== Style ==
According to Fleming, rock operas are more akin to a cantata or suite, because they are not usually acted out. Similarly, Andrew Clements of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called &quot;Tommy&quot; a subversively labeled musical. Clements states that lyrics drive rock operas, which makes them not a true form of opera. Responding to accusations that rock operas are pretentious and overblown, Pete Townshend wrote that pop music by its very nature rejects such characteristics and is an inherently simple form. Townshend said that the only goal of pop music is to reach audiences, and rock operas are merely one more way to do so. Peter Kiesewalter, on the other hand, said that rock music and opera are &quot;both overblown, massive spectacles&quot; that cover the same themes. Kiesewalter, who was originally not a fan of opera, did not think the two styles would mix well together, but his modernized operas with rock music surprised him with their popularity at the East Village Opera Company.

The performance of these works on Broadway has also courted controversy; Anne Midgette of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called them musicals with &quot;no more than the addition of a keyboard and a drum set&quot;.

<doc id="88604" wikidata="Q457306" url="?curid=88604" title="David Cassidy">
<text>David Bruce Cassidy (April 12, 1950 – November 21, 2017) was an American actor and musician. He was best known for his role as Keith Partridge, the son of Shirley Partridge (played by his real-life stepmother, actress Shirley Jones), in the 1970s musical-sitcom &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;. This role catapulted Cassidy to teen idol status as a superstar pop singer of the 1970s.

Raised primarily by his maternal grandparents in West Orange, New Jersey, Cassidy was later informed of his parents&#x27; divorce, which had happened two years prior without his knowledge. After completing high school, Cassidy pursued acting and music, moving into his father and stepmother&#x27;s home in Irvington, New York. His career took off after signing with Universal Studios in 1969, leading to roles in several TV series. His major breakthrough came in 1970 as Keith Partridge on &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, which propelled him to teen idol status. Despite the show&#x27;s success, Cassidy sought to break free from his idol image, leading to a diverse solo music career with hits in the UK and Australia, and a tumultuous life marked by public and personal challenges.

Cassidy&#x27;s personal life was complex, with multiple marriages, children from relationships, and struggles with alcohol. He became an advocate for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease research, inspired by his family&#x27;s history with the condition. Despite facing health and legal issues later in life, Cassidy continued performing until announcing his retirement in 2017, before his death later that year.

==Early life==

Cassidy was born at Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital in New York City, the son of singer and actor Jack Cassidy and actress Evelyn Ward. His father was of half Irish and half German ancestry, and his mother was descended mostly from Colonial Americans, along with having some Irish and Swiss roots. His mother&#x27;s ancestors were among the founders of Newark, New Jersey.

As his parents were frequently touring on the road, he spent his early years being raised by his maternal grandparents in a middle-class neighborhood in West Orange, New Jersey. In 1958, he found out from neighbors&#x27; children that his parents had been divorced for more than two years and had not told him.

In 1956, Cassidy&#x27;s father married singer and actress Shirley Jones. They had three children, David&#x27;s half-brothers Shaun (b. 1958), Patrick (b. 1962), and Ryan (b. 1966). In 1968, after completing one final session of summer school to obtain credits necessary to get a high school diploma, David moved into the rental home of Jack Cassidy and Shirley Jones in Irvington, New York, where his half-brothers also lived. David remained there, seeking fame as an actor/musician, while simultaneously working half-days in the mailroom of a textile firm. He moved out when his career began to flourish.

Cassidy&#x27;s father, Jack, is credited with setting his son up with his first manager. After David Cassidy signed with Universal Studios in 1969, Jack introduced him to former table tennis champion and close friend Ruth Aarons, who later found her niche as a talent manager, given her theater background. Aarons had represented Jack and Shirley Jones for several years and later represented Cassidy&#x27;s half-brother Shaun. Aarons became an authority figure and close friend to Cassidy and was the driving force behind his on-screen success. After Cassidy made small wages from Screen Gems for his work on &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; during season one, Aarons discovered that he had been underage when he signed his contract; she then renegotiated the contract with far superior provisions and a rare four-year term.

==Career==
===1960s===
On January 2, 1969, Cassidy made his professional debut in the Broadway musical &quot;The Fig Leaves Are Falling&quot;. It closed after four performances, but a casting director saw the show and asked Cassidy to make a screen test. In 1969, he moved to Los Angeles. After signing with Universal Studios in 1969, Cassidy was featured in episodes of the television series &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Adam-12&quot;, &quot;Medical Center&quot;, and &quot;Bonanza&quot;.

===1970s===

In 1970, Cassidy took the role of Keith Partridge on the musical television show &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; produced by Screen Gems. After demonstrating his singing talent, Cassidy was allowed to join the studio ensemble as the lead singer. (He and Shirley Jones were the only TV cast members to appear on any Partridge Family recordings.)

The show proved popular, but the fame took its toll on Cassidy. In the midst of his rise to fame, Cassidy felt stifled by the show and trapped by the mass hysteria surrounding his every move. In May 1972, to alter his public image, he appeared nude on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in a cropped Annie Leibovitz photo; among other things, the accompanying &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article mentioned that Cassidy was riding around New York in the back of a car &quot;stoned and drunk.&quot;

Once &quot;I Think I Love You&quot;—the first single released by The Partridge Family pop group—became a hit, Cassidy began work on solo albums, including &quot;Cherish&quot; and &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot;, both released in 1972. Within the first year, he had produced his own single, a cover of The Association&#x27;s &quot;Cherish&quot; (from the album of the same title); the song reached number nine in the United States, number two in the United Kingdom (a double A-side with &quot;Could It Be Forever&quot;), and number one in Australia and New Zealand. He began tours that featured Partridge tunes and his own hits.

Cassidy achieved far greater solo chart success in the UK than in his native America, including a cover of The Young Rascals&#x27; &quot;How Can I Be Sure&quot; and the double A-side single &quot;Daydreamer&quot; / &quot;The Puppy Song&quot; – a UK number one which failed to chart in the States. In Britain, Cassidy the solo star remains best known for &quot;Daydreamer&quot;, &quot;How Can I Be Sure&quot; and &quot;Could It Be Forever&quot; (UK number 2/US number 37), all released during his 1972–73 solo chart peak.

After launching his solo musical career, he was for a short time the highest paid entertainer in the world. At the peak of his career, Cassidy&#x27;s fan club was larger than that of any other musical group or pop star, including The Beatles or Elvis Presley. A fictionalized version of him starred in the fan magazine &quot;David Cassidy&quot;. Many of its issues were signed by Turkish comics creator Su Gumen. In a 1993 interview, Cassidy said that he was frustrated by his portrayal in the magazines, which sanitized his image. His fanclub nicknamed a star after him in the International Star Registry in 1983. In his autobiography, Cassidy said that he felt overwhelmed by his fanbase, and said that &quot;it became impossible for me to go in a store or even walk down the street without being stopped by people.&quot;

Though he wanted to become a respected rock musician along the lines of Mick Jagger, his channel to stardom launched him into the ranks of teen idol, a brand he loathed until much later in life, when he managed to come to terms with his pop idol beginnings. Ten albums by &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; and five solo albums by Cassidy were produced during the series, with most selling more than a million copies each. Internationally, Cassidy&#x27;s solo career eclipsed the already phenomenal success of &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;. He became an instant drawing card, with sellout concert successes in major arenas around the world. These concerts produced mass hysteria, resulting in the media coining the term &quot;Cassidymania&quot;. For example, he played to two sellout crowds of 56,000 each at the Houston Astrodome in Texas over one weekend in 1972. His concert in New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden sold out in one day and resulted in riots after the show. His concert tours of the United Kingdom included sellout concerts at Wembley Arena in 1973. In Australia in 1974, the mass hysteria was such that calls were made to have him deported from the country, especially after the madness at his 33,000-person audience concert at Melbourne Cricket Ground.

A turning point in Cassidy&#x27;s live concerts (while still filming &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;) was a gate stampede at the penultimate show on a world tour, in London&#x27;s White City Stadium on May 26, 1974, when nearly 800 people were injured in a crush at the front of the stage. Thirty were taken to the hospital, and a 14-year-old girl, Bernadette Whelan, died four days later at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Hospital without regaining consciousness.

A deeply affected Cassidy faced the press, trying to make sense of what had happened. Out of respect for the family and to avoid turning the girl&#x27;s funeral into a media circus, Cassidy did not attend the service, although he spoke to Whelan&#x27;s parents and sent flowers. Cassidy stated at the time that this would haunt him until the day he died.
By this point, Cassidy had decided to quit both touring and acting in &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, concentrating instead on recording and songwriting. International success continued, mostly in Great Britain, Germany, Japan and South Africa, when he released three well-received solo albums and several hit singles on RCA in 1975 and 1976. Cassidy became the first recording artist to have a hit with &quot;I Write the Songs&quot;, peaking at No. 11 in the Top 30 in Great Britain before the song became Barry Manilow&#x27;s signature tune. Cassidy co-produced the recording with the song&#x27;s author-composer, Bruce Johnston of The Beach Boys. The two artists collaborated on two of David&#x27;s mid-70s RCA Records albums &quot;The Higher They Climb&quot; and &quot;Home Is Where the Heart Is&quot;.

In 1978, Cassidy starred in an episode of &quot;Police Story&quot; titled &quot;A Chance to Live&quot;, for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award. NBC created a series based on it, called &quot;David Cassidy: Man Undercover&quot;, but it was cancelled after one season. A decade later, the successful Fox series &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; used the same plot, with different youthful-looking police officers infiltrating a high school.

===1980s===
Cassidy later stated he was broke by the 1980s, despite being successful and highly paid. In 1985, music success continued with the Arista release of the single &quot;The Last Kiss&quot; (number six in the United Kingdom), with backing vocals by George Michael, which was included on the album &quot;Romance&quot;. These went gold in Europe and Australia, and Cassidy supported them with a sellout tour of the United Kingdom, which resulted in the &quot;Greatest Hits Live&quot; compilation of 1986. Michael cited Cassidy as a major career influence and interviewed Cassidy for David Litchfield&#x27;s &quot;Ritz Newspaper&quot;.

Cassidy performed in musical theater. In 1981, he toured in a revival of a pre-Broadway production of &quot;Little Johnny Jones,&quot; a show originally produced in 1904 with music, lyrics, and book by George M. Cohan. (The show is excerpted in the biographic film &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; [1942], when James Cagney sings &quot;Give My Regards to Broadway&quot; and &quot;The Yankee Doodle Boy&quot;.) However, Cassidy received negative reviews, and he was replaced by another former teen idol, Donny Osmond, before the show reached Broadway. Cassidy, in turn, was himself a replacement for the lead in the original 1982 Broadway production of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.&quot; Cassidy also appeared in London&#x27;s West End production of &quot;Time&quot; and returned to Broadway in &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; alongside Petula Clark and David&#x27;s half-brother Shaun Cassidy.

===Later career===
Cassidy returned to the American top 40 with his 1990 single &quot;Lyin&#x27; to Myself&quot;, released on Enigma Records, from his 1990 album &quot;David Cassidy&quot;, followed by the 1992 album &quot;Didn&#x27;t You Used to Be...&quot; on Scotti Brothers Records. In 1998, he had an adult contemporary music hit with &quot;No Bridge I Wouldn&#x27;t Cross&quot; from his album &quot;Old Trick New Dog&quot; on his own Slamajamma Records label.

Along with his single &quot;Lyin&#x27; to Myself&quot;, 1990 was also the year he starred in the motion picture comedy, &quot;The Spirit of &#x27;76&quot;, where he was the main character as a man from the future who arrived in the US in the year 1976 on a mission to find the US Constitution. It was also the year he was a main character in the romantic drama &quot;Instant Karma&quot;.

From November 1996 to December 1998, Cassidy starred in the Las Vegas show &quot;EFX&quot; at the MGM Grand Las Vegas. In 2000, Cassidy wrote and appeared in the Las Vegas show &quot;At the Copa&quot; with Sheena Easton, as both the young and old versions of the lead character, Johnny Flamingo. His 2001 album &quot;Then and Now&quot; went platinum internationally and returned Cassidy to the top five of the UK album charts for the first time since 1974.

In 2005, Cassidy played the manager of Aaron Carter&#x27;s character in the film &quot;Popstar&quot;. He co-starred alongside his half-brother Patrick in a short-lived 2009 ABC Family comedy series titled &quot;Ruby &amp; the Rockits&quot;, a show created by Shaun.

Cassidy was one of the contestants on &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; in 2011.

As the days of &quot;Cassidymania&quot; subsided, Cassidy regularly addressed fans at his concerts in question-and-answer sessions. In August 2016, Cassidy performed in The Villages, Florida, and brought multiple attendees to the side of the stage, asking and answering questions and engaging with members of the community who had been fans for nearly half a century.

==Personal life==
Cassidy&#x27;s first wife was actress Kay Lenz, whom he married on April 3, 1977, and divorced on December 28, 1983.

Cassidy married his second wife, horse breeder Meryl Tanz, in 1984. They met in 1974 at a horse sale in Lexington, Kentucky. This marriage ended in divorce in 1988.

Cassidy&#x27;s daughter, actress Katie Cassidy, was born in 1986 from an extramarital affair with fashion model Sherry Williams. After David and Williams ended their relationship, Katie was raised by her mother and her stepfather, Richard Benedon. David spoke of his absence from Katie&#x27;s life: in February 2017, he said, &quot;I&#x27;ve never had a relationship with her. I wasn&#x27;t her father. I was her biological father but I didn&#x27;t raise her. She has a completely different life. I&#x27;m proud of her. She&#x27;s very talented. It&#x27;s hard for me to even accept how old she is now.&quot;

Cassidy married songwriter Sue Shifrin on March 30, 1991. It was Cassidy&#x27;s third marriage and Shifrin&#x27;s second marriage. They had one child, Beau, in 1991. In August 2013, Cassidy&#x27;s Los Angeles publicist confirmed that the couple had separated, with Shifrin filing for divorce in February 2014.

Cassidy moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 2002. He filed for bankruptcy in 2015.

===Activism===
In 2011, Cassidy recorded a public service announcement for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease research and prevention – because his mother, Evelyn Ward, suffered with the condition – and said that he would campaign for that cause whenever possible. He planned to address Congress in 2012.

Cassidy was a long-time registered Democrat. During a 2012 guest appearance on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; he expressed his views on the leading Republican candidates for president, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich. Cassidy stated, &quot;I believe both of them are the most embarrassing, sad, pathetic  ... I mean, really, this is the best we can do?&quot;

===Alcohol-related driving incidents and criminal charges===
Cassidy was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) in Florida on November 3, 2010.

Cassidy was arrested for DUI in Schodack, New York, in the early hours of August 21, 2013. He was pulled over after failing to dim his headlights as he passed a police car going in the opposite direction. After performing poorly on a field sobriety test, Cassidy was subjected to an alcohol breath test, returning a blood alcohol level of 0.10%, which was above the New York legal limit of 0.08%. The arresting officer, one Tom Jones, reported that Cassidy was polite and courteous; in reference to a 1965 hit song by singer Tom Jones, Cassidy jokingly asked the officer, &quot;What&#x27;s New, Pussycat?&quot; Cassidy was charged, taken to jail, and released several hours later on $2,500 bail. On May 12, 2015, Cassidy was sentenced to community service, a fine, and a six-month license suspension.

Cassidy was arrested on suspicion of DUI in California on January 10, 2014, after he made an illegal right turn against a red light. He was held overnight in jail, ordered to undergo inpatient rehabilitation, and placed on probation for five years.

On September 9, 2015, Cassidy was cited in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on charges of leaving the scene of a car accident, improper lane change, expired plates and driving on a suspended license.

==Illness and death==
In 2008, Cassidy publicly admitted he had an alcohol problem.

On February 20, 2017, following a performance in Agoura Hills, California, in which Cassidy had difficulty remembering the lyrics of songs he had been performing for nearly 50 years, and appeared to fall off the stage, he announced that he was living with dementia and was retiring from all further performing. He said that his mother and grandfather had also suffered from dementia at the end of their lives, and that &quot;I was in denial, but a part of me always knew this was coming.&quot;
Later in 2017, Cassidy fell ill at a recording studio and was hospitalized. In a later phone conversation with an A&amp;E producer, he stated that he had just met with his doctor, that he had liver disease, and that his life had &quot;changed dramatically.&quot; Cassidy added that he had been unconscious and near death for the first few days after the incident, but that his memory had returned. Cassidy also acknowledged that there was &quot;no sign of [dementia] at this stage of [his] life,&quot; adding that &quot;[it] was complete alcohol poisoning—and the fact is, I lied about my drinking.&quot; Cassidy said, &quot;You know, I did it to myself, man. I did it to myself to cover up the sadness and the emptiness.&quot; Cassidy had told his family and others that he had given up drinking.

On November 18, 2017, Cassidy was hospitalized with liver and kidney failure, and was critically ill in a medically induced coma. He came out of the coma two days later, remaining in critical but stable condition. Doctors hoped to keep Cassidy stable until a liver became available for transplant, but he died of liver failure on November 21, 2017, at the age of 67. According to his daughter, Katie Cassidy, his final words were &quot;So much wasted time.&quot;

==Memoirs==
In 1994, Cassidy, in collaboration with Chip Deffaa, wrote his autobiography &quot;C&#x27;mon, Get Happy ... Fear and Loathing on the Partridge Family Bus&quot;. In December 2019, &quot;C&#x27;mon, Get Happy&quot; was published as an E-book (by Open Road Media, ) with a new afterword by Chip Deffaa, covering the rest of Cassidy&#x27;s life.

Cassidy also wrote a memoir, &quot;Could It Be Forever? My Story&quot;, published in the United Kingdom in March 2007, which gives further details about his personal life.

<text>Table Mountain (; ) is a flat-topped mountain forming a prominent landmark overlooking the city of Cape Town in South Africa. It is a significant tourist attraction, with many visitors using the cableway or hiking to the top. Table Mountain National Park is the most visited national park in South Africa, attracting 4.2 million people every year for various activities. The mountain has 8,200 plant species, of which around 80% are fynbos, meaning fine bush. It forms part of the Table Mountain National Park, and part of the lands formerly ranged by Khoe-speaking clans, such as the (the &quot;High Clan&quot;). It is home to a large array of mostly endemic fauna and flora. Its top elevates about 1,000 m above the surrounding city, making the popular hike upwards on a large variety of different, often steep and rocky pathways a serious mountain tour which requires fitness, preparation and hiking equipment.

==Features==

The main feature of Table Mountain is the level plateau approximately from side to side, edged by steep cliffs. The plateau, flanked by Devil&#x27;s Peak to the east and by Lion&#x27;s Head to the west, forms a dramatic backdrop to Cape Town. This broad sweep of mountainous heights, together with Signal Hill, forms the natural amphitheatre of the City Bowl and Table Bay harbour. The highest point on Table Mountain is towards the eastern end of the plateau and is marked by Maclear&#x27;s Beacon, a stone cairn built in 1865 by Sir Thomas Maclear for trigonometrical survey. It is above sea level, and about higher than the cable station at the western end of the plateau.

The cliffs of the main plateau are split by Platteklip Gorge (&quot;Flat Stone Gorge&quot;), which provides an easy and direct ascent to the summit and was the route taken by António de Saldanha on the first recorded ascent of the mountain in 1503.

The flat top of the mountain is often covered by orographic clouds, formed when a southeasterly wind is directed up the mountain&#x27;s slopes into colder air, where the moisture condenses to form the so-called &quot;table cloth&quot; of cloud. Legend attributes this phenomenon to a smoking contest between the Devil and a local pirate called Van Hunks. When the table cloth is seen, it symbolizes the contest.

Table Mountain is at the northern end of a sandstone mountain range that forms the spine of the Cape Peninsula that terminates approximately to the south at the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Point. Immediately to the south of Table Mountain is a rugged &quot;plateau&quot; at a somewhat lower elevation than the Table Mountain Plateau (at about ), called the &quot;Back Table&quot;. The &quot;Back Table&quot; extends southwards for approximately 6 km to the Constantia Nek-Hout Bay valley. The Atlantic side of the Back Table is known as the Twelve Apostles, which extends from Kloof Nek (the saddle between Table Mountain and Lion&#x27;s Head) to Hout Bay. The eastern side of this portion of the Peninsula&#x27;s mountain chain, extending from Devil&#x27;s Peak, the eastern side of Table Mountain (Erica and Fernwood Buttresses), and the Back Table to Constantia Nek, does not have a single name, as on the western side. It is better known by the names of the conservation areas on its lower slopes: Groote Schuur Estate, Newlands Forest, Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens, Cecilia Park, and Constantia Nek.

==Geology==

The upper approximately portion of the table-topped mountain, or mesa, consists of 450- to 510-million-year-old (Ordovician) rocks belonging to the two lowermost layers of the Cape Fold Mountains. The uppermost, and younger of the two layers, consists of extremely hard quartzitic sandstone, commonly referred to as &quot;Table Mountain Sandstone&quot; (TMS), or &quot;Peninsula Formation Sandstone&quot; (as it is known as at present), which is highly resistant to erosion and forms characteristic steep grey crags. The lower layer, known as the &quot;Graafwater Formation&quot;, consists of distinctively maroon-colored mudstones, which were laid down in much thinner horizontal strata than the Table Mountain Sandstone strata above it. The Graafwater rocks can best be seen just above the contour path on the front of Table Mountain, and around Devils Peak. They can also been seen in the cutting along Chapman&#x27;s Peak Drive. These rocks are believed to have originated in shallow tidal flats, in which a few Ordovician fossils, and fossil tracks have been preserved. The overlying TMS probably arose in deeper water, either as a result of subsidence, or a rise in the sea level. The Graafwater rocks rest on the basement consisting of Cape Granite. Devil&#x27;s Peak, Signal Hill, the City Bowl and much of the &quot;Cape Flats&quot;, however, rest on heavily folded and altered phyllites and hornfelses known informally as the Malmesbury shales. The Cape Granite and Malmesbury shales form the lower, gentler slopes of the Table Mountain range on the Cape Peninsula. They are of late Precambrian age, pre-dating the &quot;Graafwater rocks&quot; by at least 40 million years.
The basement rocks are not nearly as resistant to weathering as the TMS, but significant outcrops of the Cape Granite are visible on the western side of Lion&#x27;s Head, and elsewhere on the Peninsula (especially below Chapman&#x27;s Peak Drive, and The Boulders near Simon&#x27;s Town). The weathered granite soil of the lower slopes of the Peninsula Mountain range are more fertile than the nutrient-poor soils derived from TMS. Most of the vineyards found on the Cape Peninsula are therefore found on these granitic slopes of the Table Mountain range.

The mountain owes its table-top flatness to the fact that it is a syncline mountain, meaning that it was once the floor of a valley (see diagram on the right). The anticline, or highest point of the series of folds that Table Mountain was once part of, lay to the east, but that has been weathered away, together with the underlying softer Malmesbury shale and granite basement, to form the &quot;Cape Flats&quot;, the isthmus that connects the Cape Peninsula to the mainland. The fold mountains reappear as the Hottentots-Holland Mountain range on the mainland side of the Cape Flats. What has added to the mountain&#x27;s table-top flatness is that it consists entirely of the very hard, lower layer of the TMS Formation. Originally this was topped by a thin glacial tillite layer, known as the Pakhuis Formation (see the diagram above, left), above which was the upper layer of TMS. Both these layers, but especially the tillite layer, are softer than the lower layer of Table Mountain Sandstone. When these softer layers eroded away, they left a very hard, flat erosion-resistant quartzitic sandstone platform behind which today forms Table Mountain&#x27;s top.
Table Mountain is the northernmost end of a and roughly Cape Fold Mountain range that forms the backbone of the Cape Peninsula, stretching from the Cape of Good Hope in the south to Table Mountain and its flanking Devil&#x27;s Peak (to the east) and Lion&#x27;s Head and Signal Hill (to the west) in the north. Table Mountain forms the highest point of this range. The range runs parallel to the other Cape Fold Mountain ranges on the mainland to the east.

==Flora==


Table Mountain and the Back Table have an unusually rich biodiversity. Its vegetation consists predominantly of several different types of the unique and rich Cape fynbos. The main vegetation type is endangered Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos, but critically endangered Peninsula Granite Fynbos, Peninsula Shale Renosterveld and Afromontane forest occur in smaller portions on the mountain.

Table Mountain&#x27;s vegetation types form part of the Cape Floral Region protected areas. These protected areas are a World Heritage Site, and an estimated 2,285 species of plants are confined to Table Mountain and the Cape Peninsula range, of which a great proportion, including many species of proteas, are endemic to these mountains and valleys and can be found nowhere else. Of the 2,285 species on the Peninsula 1,500 occur in the 57 km2 area comprising Table Mountain and the Back Table, a number at least as large as all the plant species in the whole of the United Kingdom. The &quot;Disa uniflora&quot;, despite its restricted range within the Western Cape, is relatively common in the perennially wet areas (waterfalls, streamlets and seeps) on Table Mountain and the Back Table, but hardly anywhere else on the Cape Peninsula. It is a very showy orchid that blooms from January to March on the Table Mountain Sandstone regions of the mountain. Although they are quite widespread on the Back Table, the best (most certain, and close-up) place to view these beautiful blooms is in the &quot;Aqueduct&quot; off the Smuts Track, halfway between Skeleton Gorge and Maclear&#x27;s Beacon.

Remnant patches of indigenous forest persist in the wetter ravines. However, much of the indigenous forest was felled by the early European settlers for fuel for the lime kilns needed during the construction of the Castle. The exact extent of the original forests is unknown, though most of it was probably along the eastern slopes of Devil&#x27;s Peak, Table Mountain and the Back Table where names such as Rondebosch, Kirstenbosch, Klassenbosch and Witteboomen survive (in Dutch &quot;bosch&quot; means forest; and &quot;boomen&quot; means trees). Hout Bay (in Dutch &quot;hout&quot; means wood) was another source of timber and fuel as the name suggests. In the early 1900s commercial pine plantations were planted on these slopes all the way from the Constantiaberg to the front of Devil&#x27;s Peak, and even on top of the mountains, but these have now been largely cleared allowing fynbos to flourish in the regions where the indigenous Afromontane forests have not survived, or never existed.

Fynbos is a fire adapted vegetation, and providing fires are not too frequent, regular or intense, they are important drivers of fynbos diversity. Regular fires have dominated fynbos for at least the past 12 000 years largely as a result of human activity. In 1495 Vasco da Gama named the South African coastline &quot;Terra de Fume&quot; because of the smoke he saw from numerous fires. This was originally probably to maintain a productive stock of edible bulbs (especially watsonians) and to facilitate hunting, and later, after the arrival of pastoralists, to provide fresh grazing after the rains. Thus the plants that make up fynbos today are those that have been subjected to a variety of fire regimes over a very long period time, and their preservation now requires regular burning. The frequency of the fires obviously determines precisely which mix of plants will dominate any particular region, but intervals of 10–15 years between fires are considered to promote the proliferation of the larger Protea species, a rare local colony of which, the &quot;Aulax umbellata&quot; (Family: Proteaceae), was wiped out on the Peninsula by more frequent fires, as have been the silky-haired pincushion, &quot;Leucospermum vestitum&quot;, the red sugarbush, &quot;Protea grandiceps&quot; and Burchell&#x27;s sugarbush, &quot;Protea burchellii&quot;, although a stand of a dozen or so plants has recently been &quot;rediscovered&quot; in the saddle between Table Mountain and Devil&#x27;s Peak. Some bulbs may similarly have become extinct as a result a too rapid sequence of fires. The fires that occur on the mountains today are still largely due to unregulated human activity. Fire frequency is therefore a matter of chance rather than conservation.

Despite intensive conservation efforts the Table Mountain range has the highest concentration of threatened species of any continental area of equivalent size in the world. The non-urban areas of the Cape Peninsula (mainly on the mountains and mountain slopes) have suffered particularly under a massive onslaught of invasive alien plants for well over a century, with perhaps the worst invader being the cluster pine, partly because it was planted in extensive commercial plantations along the eastern slopes of the mountains, north of Muizenberg. Considerable efforts have been made to control the rapid spread of these invasive alien trees. Other invasive plants include black wattle, blackwood, Port Jackson and rooikrans (All Australian members of the acacia family), as well as several &quot;Hakea&quot; species and bramble.

==Fauna==
The most common mammal on the mountain was the &quot;dassie&quot; (the South African name, from Afrikaans, pronounced &quot;dussy&quot;), or rock hyrax. Between about 2000 and 2004 (no one is certain about the exact year or years) their numbers suddenly plummeted for unknown reasons. They used to cluster around the restaurant at the upper cable station, near areas where tourists discarded or (inadvisably) supplied food. The population crash of the dassies may have been responsible for the decline in the Verreaux&#x27;s eagle population on the Peninsula, which is believed to have consisted of three breeding pairs during the period 1950-1990, with only two pairs, maximally, ever having been reported to fledge a chick each in any given year. With the commencement of formal monitoring in 1993, two breeding pairs were recorded on the Cape Peninsula Mountain Chain in 2004: one below the upper cable station at the western end of Table Mountain, in Blinkwater Ravine, the other on the cliffs below Noordhoek Peak. The nest near the cable station was abandoned in 2006, leaving only the Noordhoek pair, which continued to fledge chicks reasonably regularly until 2013, at which point one member of the pair disappeared. From 2013 until January 2017 only a single Verreaux&#x27;s Eagle, presumed to be a female, remained on the Peninsula. She continued to maintain the nest under Noordhoek Peak, but seemed unable to attract a mate. But in early 2017 a pair of eagles was seen by at least 7 independent observers during the course of 10 days (27 January – 5 February). Dassies are an important part the Verreaux&#x27;s eagle&#x27;s prey on the Peninsula. (See Foot note)

Table Mountain is also home to porcupines, mongooses, snakes, lizards, tortoises, and a rare endemic species of amphibian that is only found on Table Mountain, the Table Mountain ghost frog. The last lion in the area was shot circa 1802. Leopards persisted on the mountains until perhaps the 1920s but are now extinct locally. Two smaller, secretive, nocturnal carnivores, the &quot;rooikat&quot; (caracal) and the &quot;vaalboskat&quot; (also called the vaalkat or Southern African wildcat) were once common in the mountains and the mountain slopes. The rooikat continues to be seen on rare occasions by mountaineers but the status of the vaalboskat is uncertain. The mountain cliffs are home to several raptors species, apart from the Verreaux&#x27;s eagle. They include the jackal buzzard, booted eagle (in summer), African harrier-hawk, peregrine falcon and the rock kestrel. In 2014 there were four pairs of African fish eagles on the Peninsula, but they nest in trees generally as far away from human habitation and activity as is possible on the Peninsula. 

Up until the late 1990s baboons lived on all the mountains of the Peninsula, including the Back Table immediately behind Table Mountain. Since then they have abandoned Table Mountain and the Back Table, and only occur south of Constantia Nek. They have also abandoned the tops of many of the mountains, in favor of the lower slopes, particularly when these were covered in pine plantations which seemed to provide them with more, or higher quality food than the fynbos on the mountain tops. However these new haunts are also within easy reach of Cape Town&#x27;s suburbs, which brings them into conflict with humans and dogs, and the risk of traffic accidents. There are now (2014) a dozen troops on the Peninsula, varying in size from 7 to over 100 individuals, scattered on the mountains from the Constantiaberg to Cape Point. The baboon troops are the subject of intense research into their physiology, genetics social interactions and habits. In addition, their sleeping sites are noted each evening, so that monitors armed with paint ball guns can stay with the troop all day, to ward them off from wandering into the suburbs. From when this initiative was started in 2009 the number of baboons on the Peninsula has increased from 350 to 450, and the number of baboons killed or injured by residents has decreased.

Himalayan tahrs, fugitive descendants of tahrs that escaped from Groote Schuur Zoo in 1936, used to be common on the less accessible upper parts of the mountain. As an exotic species, they were almost eradicated through a culling programme initiated by the South African National Parks to make way for the reintroduction of indigenous klipspringers. Until recently there were also small numbers of fallow deer of European origin and sambar deer from southeast Asia. These were mainly in the Rhodes Memorial area but during the 1960s they could be found as far afield as Signal Hill. These animals may still be seen occasionally despite efforts to eliminate or relocate them.

On the lower slopes of Devil&#x27;s Peak, above Groote Schuur Hospital an animal camp bequeathed to the City of Cape Town by Cecil John Rhodes has been used in recent years as part of the Quagga Project. The quagga used to roam the Cape Peninsula, the Karoo and the Free State in large numbers, but were hunted to extinction during the early 1800s. The last quagga died in an Amsterdam zoo in 1883. In 1987 a project was launched by Reinhold Rau to back-breed the quagga, after it had been established, using mitochondrial DNA obtained from museum specimens, that the quagga was closely related to the plains zebra, and on 20 January 2005 a foal considered to be the first quagga-like individual because of a visible reduced striping, was born. These quagga-like zebras are officially known as Rau quaggas, as no one can be certain that they are anything more than quagga look-alikes. The animal camp above Groote Schuur Hospital has several good looking Rau quaggas, but they are unfortunately not easily seen except from within the game camp, which is quite large and undulating, and the animals are few. The animal camp is not open to the public.

==History==

Prehistoric inhabitation of the district is well attested (see for example the article on Fish Hoek). About 2000 years ago the Khoe-speaking peoples migrated towards the Cape Peninsula from the north. This countryside was before that occupied by nomadic !Ui speakers (who were foragers). The pastoralist influx brought herds of cattle and sheep into the region, which then formed part of a larger grazing land that was seasonally rotated. It was the !Uriǁʼaekua (&quot;Highclansmen&quot;, often written in Dutch as &quot;Goringhaiqua&quot;) who were the dominant local people when the Europeans first sailed into Table Bay. This clan is said to be the ancestral population of the !Ora nations of today (so-called &quot;Korana&quot; people).

These original inhabitants of the area so-called &quot;Khoekhoen&quot;, called Table Mountain Huriǂ&#x27;oaxa – &quot;ocean-emerging (mountain)&quot;.

António de Saldanha was the first European to land in Table Bay. He climbed the mighty mountain in 1503 and named it Taboa do Cabo (&quot;Table of the Cape&quot;, in his native Portuguese). The great cross that the Portuguese navigator carved into the rock of Lion&#x27;s Head is still traceable.

In 1796, during the British occupation of the Cape, Major-General Sir James Craig ordered three blockhouses to be built on Table Mountain: the King&#x27;s blockhouse, Duke of York blockhouse (&quot;later renamed Queen&#x27;s blockhouse&quot;) and the Prince of Wales blockhouse. Two of these are in ruins today, but the King&#x27;s blockhouse is still in good condition. and easily accessible from the Rhodes Memorial.

Between 1896 and 1907, five dams, the Woodhead, Hely-Hutchinson, De Villiers, Alexandria and Victoria reservoirs, were opened on the Back Table to supply Cape Town&#x27;s water needs. A ropeway ascending from Camps Bay via Kasteelspoort ravine was used to ferry materials and manpower (the anchor points at the old top station can still be seen). There is a well-preserved steam locomotive from this period housed in the Waterworks Museum at the top of the mountain near the Hely-Hutchinson dam. It had been used to haul materials for the dam across the flat top of the mountain. Cape Town&#x27;s water requirements have since far outpaced the capacity of the dams and they are no longer an important part of the water supply.

Arguments for a national park on the Cape Peninsula, centred on Table Mountain, began in earnest in the mid-1930s. Following a big fire in 1986, the &quot;Cape Times&quot; started a &#x27;save the mountain&#x27; campaign, and in 1989 the Cape Peninsula Protected Natural Environment (CPPNE) area was established. However, environmental management was still bedeviled by the fragmented nature of land ownership on the Peninsula. Following another big fire in 1991, Attorney General Frank Kahn was appointed to reach consensus on a plan for rationalizing management of the CPPNE. In 1995, Prof. Brian Huntley recommended that SANParks be appointed to manage the CPPNE, with an agreement signed in April 1998 to transfer around 39,500 acres to SANParks. On 29 May 1998, then-president Nelson Mandela proclaimed the Cape Peninsula National Park. The park was later renamed to the Table Mountain National Park.

Fires are common on the mountain. The most recent major fires include those of January 2006, which burned large amounts of vegetation and resulted in the death of a tourist (a charge of arson and culpable homicide was laid against a British man who was suspected of starting the blaze), and March 2015. There was a major fire in April 2021 that affected the Rhodes Memorial and the University of Cape Town.

In November 2011, Table Mountain was named one of the New7Wonders of Nature.

==Cableway==
The Table Mountain Aerial Cableway takes passengers from the lower cable station on Tafelberg Road, about above sea level, to the plateau at the top of the mountain, at . The upper cable station offers views overlooking Cape Town, Table Bay, Lion&#x27;s Head and Robben Island to the north, and the Atlantic seaboard to the west and south. The top cable station includes curio shops, a restaurant and walking trails of various lengths.

The original cableway construction was awarded to Adolf Bleichert &amp; Co. of Leipzig, Germany, in 1926 and the cableway opened on 4 October 1929.

The cableway has been refurbished three times since its inauguration in 1929, with upgrades to the upper and lower cable stations and enlarged gondolas. The first refurbishment occurred in 1958, the second in 1974, and the third and most significant reconstruction from 1996 to 1997, introducing a &quot;Rotair&quot; gondola manufactured by the Swiss company Garaventa AG – CWA (Doppelmayr Garaventa Group) which increased the capacity from 20 to 65 passengers per trip and provided a faster journey to the summit. The gondolas rotate through 360 degrees during the ascent or descent, giving a panoramic view over the city.

===Hiking on Table Mountain===
Hiking on Table Mountain is popular amongst locals and tourists, and a number of trails of varying difficulty are available. Because of the steep cliffs around the summit, direct ascents from the city side are limited. Platteklip Gorge, a prominent gorge up the centre of the main table, is a popular and straightforward direct ascent to the summit. Par for the course is about 2.5 hours depending on fitness. This route is very hot in summer, as it is located on the north facing slope of the mountain, with almost no shade along the 600 m climb from Tafelberg Road to the Table Mountain plateau.

Longer routes to the summit go via the Back Table, a lower area of Table Mountain south of the main plateau which constitutes the flat summit of Table Mountain as seen from the north. From the Southern Suburbs side, the Nursery Ravine and Skeleton Gorge routes start at Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden. The route via Skeleton Gorge to Maclear&#x27;s Beacon is known as Smuts Track in memory of Jan Smuts, who was a keen hiker. The Bridle Path, or Jeep Track, makes a more gradual ascent from Constantia Nek along the road used to service the dams on Back Table. There are many other paths in popular walking areas on the lower slopes of the mountain accessed from Constantia Nek, Cecilia Park, Kirstenbosch, Newlands Forest and Rhodes Memorial.

There are a number of ascents on the Atlantic side of the mountain, the most popular being Kasteelspoort, a ravine overlooking Camps Bay.

There is a popular &quot;Contour Path&quot; that runs from Constantia Nek, and then, in succession, above Cecilia Park, Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens, Newlands Forest, and from there, above Groote Schuur Estate, past the King&#x27;s Blockhouse, at the north-east corner of Devil&#x27;s Peak, immediately below the Mowbray Ridge cliffs, to the front of Devil&#x27;s Peak and the north face of Table Mountain, ending at the bottom of Kloof Corner Ridge at the western end of the Table Mountain cliffs. It starts at Constantia Nek at 250 m and climbs to around 320 m above Cecilia Park and Kirstenbosch, then climbs to 470 m to the scree below the cliffs of Fernwood Buttress. It then descends to 350 m, only to ascend to 400 m 1 km later and remains on this contour until the King&#x27;s Blockhouse, and from there, eventually, to Tafelberg Road (at 400 m). From the King&#x27;s Blockhouse it is possible to choose a footpath that will lead to the &quot;upper contour path&quot; which traverses the front (north face) of Devil&#x27;s Peak and Table Mountain at 500 m, to just beyond the Lower Cable Station. From there it is possible, from either contour path, to join up with the &quot;Pipe Track&quot; which starts from Kloof Nek, and then runs at an elevation of about 300 m, below the cliffs of the Twelve Apostles, on the Atlantic side of the mountain range as far as the Oudekraal Ravine, where the path goes up the ravine to join the &quot;Apostles Path&quot; on top of the Back Table at an elevation of 685 m. There are innumerable paths which join the contour path from below (at least five from Kirstenbosch alone), and somewhat fewer that join it from above.

On top of the mountain, and particularly on the Back Table, there is an extensive network of well marked hiking paths over a variety of terrains and distances and durations up to several hours or all day. Maps of all the routes are available at bookshops and outdoor recreation stores, which hikers are advised to use, as dense mist and cold weather (or extreme heat) can descend without warning at any time of the year.

The Hoerikwaggo Trails were four hiking trails on the Cape Peninsula Mountain Chain ranging from two to six days, operated by South African National Parks (SANPARKS) between the Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront and Cape Point. Today (2017) the trails can no longer be undertaken with an official SANPARKS guide, and only four of the original accommodation facilities are operational (the Overseer&#x27;s Cottage on the Back Table, the Orange Kloof Tented Camp, the Slangkop Tented Camp and the Smitswinkel Tented Camp). These camps are &quot;self-catering&quot;, each with communal ablution facilities, with large communal kitchen/lounge areas, fully equipped for 12 persons. SANPARKS arranges for luggage and provisions to be transported to the operational cottages and tented camps, so that the hikers can ascend the mountain unencumbered by heavy backpacks. The four Table Mountain Hoerikwaggo hiking trails were called the People&#x27;s Trail, Table Mountain Trail, Orangekloof Hiking Trail and Top to Tip Trail.

===Rock climbing===
Rock climbing on Table Mountain is a very popular pastime. There are well-documented climbing routes of varying degrees of difficulty up the many faces of the mountain. The main climbs are located on cliffs below the upper cable station. No bolting can be done here and only traditional climbing is allowed. Commercial groups also offer abseiling from the upper cable station.

===Caving===
Most of the world&#x27;s important caves occur in limestone but Table Mountain is unusual in having several large cave systems that have developed in sandstone. The biggest systems are the Wynberg Caves, located on the Back Table, not far from the Jeep Track, in ridges overlooking Orange Kloof and Hout Bay.

===Mountain biking===
The slopes of Table Mountain have many jeep tracks that allow mountain biking. The route to the Block House is a popular route for bike riding. Plum Pudding Hill is the name of a very steep jeep track. Bike riders should follow the directional signs on display for mountain bike riders.

==&quot;Mensa&quot; constellation==
Table Mountain is the only terrestrial feature to give its name to a constellation: &quot;Mensa&quot;, meaning &quot;The Table&quot;. The constellation is seen in the Southern Hemisphere, below Orion, around midnight in mid-July. It was named by the French astronomer Nicolas de Lacaille during his stay at the Cape in the mid-18th century.

<doc id="88614" wikidata="Q1245432" url="?curid=88614" title="Dork Tower">
<text>Dork Tower is an online comic created, written and drawn by John Kovalic. It chronicles the lives of a group of geeks living in the fictional town of Mud Bay, Wisconsin. Mud Bay&#x27;s design is strongly influenced by the author&#x27;s home town of Madison, Wisconsin. Topics have included role-playing games (RPGs), comic books, video games, and fandom in general. The comic strip began in January 1997 and has made appearances in publications like &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine, &quot;Shadis&quot;, and &quot;Comic Shop News&quot;. Starting in 2000, the strip began web publication roughly three times a week and is featured in &quot;Pyramid&quot;. The bimonthly comic book made its first appearance in 1998 and features continuing storylines. It has recently gone to full color with issue #32, and it is collected in trade paperback.

During its first year in &quot;Dragon&quot;, &quot;Dork Tower&quot; was called &quot;Shop Keep&quot;, making the comics focusing on Bill Blyden and Pegasaurus Games a separate series from the comics focusing on Matt and his group that were published elsewhere (although the &quot;Dork Tower&quot; cast, especially Igor, also appeared in &quot;Shop Keep&quot; as customers). This was later discontinued, and subsequent Pegasaurus-based strips were also titled &quot;Dork Tower&quot;. The name is a cacographic of the Judges Guild &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; module &quot;Dark Tower&quot;.

==Awards==
&quot;Dork Tower&quot; won the 2002 Origins Awards for Best Game-Related Periodical and Best Game-Related Fiction, Graphic Form (&quot;Dork Tower&quot; #18), and the 2001 award for Best Professional Game Periodical.

John Kovalic also won the 2001 Origins Award for Best Illustration for the cover of &quot;Dork Shadows&quot;. The story &quot;Matt and Gilly&#x27;s Big Date&quot; won the 2000 Origins Award for Best Game-Related Short Work, and the story &quot;Everybody Loves Gilly&quot; won the 2003 award for Graphic Fiction.

==Cast of characters==
&quot;Dork Tower&quot;s central characters are a group of people who play games as a hobby, including role-playing games and miniatures games, and some also participate in live action role-playing games. The comic primarily chronicles the ins-and-outs of the gaming world (typically exaggerating stereotypes of gamers for comic effect).

* Matt McLimore is the main character in the comic book; many of the storylines focus around his love life. He usually serves as the gamemaster for his group of friends when they role-play; his favorite game is &quot;Warhamster&quot; (a parody of &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay&quot;). He has been dating Kayleigh but has a crush on Gilly. He works as a graphic designer but also draws his own comic book, &quot;That Grrl&quot;, in his spare time. The main character in &quot;That Grrl&quot; bears a strong resemblance to Gilly.
* Ken Mills is the most responsible of the group. He likes miniature figures and usually plays as a Cleric in the group&#x27;s RPG campaigns. He is dating Sujata, Kayleigh&#x27;s roommate. Sujata enjoys miniature wargaming.
* Igor Olman is largely the comic relief. He has been Matt&#x27;s best friend since they were kids. In games, Igor tends to make rash decisions that get the party killed. He also likes to LARP, usually playing Vampire: The Groveling (a parody of &quot;&quot;) with the goths. He cannot stand Kayleigh, and wants to get Matt together with Gilly. He is an obsessive collector and a spendthrift; his cry of &quot;It must be mine!&quot; (accompanied by flung wads of cash) has become the series&#x27; most popular catchphrase. He also is an alien in Cosmic Encounter Online as &quot;Dork&quot;. He claims to be the nephew of &quot;Good Eats&quot; host Alton Brown.
* Carson is a muskrat. He is flighty and switches interests regularly. He also makes rash decisions when he role-plays. Carson works demeaning jobs in the service sector to pay for his hobbies, which include comic book collecting. Carson is a fan of the Chicago Cubs. He is also the star of John Kovalic&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Wild Life&quot;.
* Bill Blyden is the owner and manager of Pegasaurus Games, a store in Mud Bay where all the characters shop. The &quot;Shop Keep&quot; comic strips published in &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine, before the strip reverted to &quot;Dork Tower&quot;, focus on his activities. He is married to Stacy, and his sole employee is Leslie. Pegasaurus is strongly influenced by Madison, Wisconsin game shop Pegasus Games, as are the character designs of Bill and Leslie.
* Gilly Woods (the Perky Goth) likes to LARP, which is how Igor met her. Matt saw her at a party and developed a crush on her, but did not meet her until Igor invited Gilly to one of their games. Gilly likes cute and cheerful things, to the disgust of her brother Walden. She recently moved to London for grad school.
* Walden Woods is Gilly&#x27;s older brother, a mopey goth. He is the leader of the goth gamers in Mud Bay, and often has to deal with the indignity of the LARPers being kicked out of everywhere they want to play (recently ending up at the pet cemetery).
* Kayleigh was Matt&#x27;s girlfriend. They have known each other since they were kids, and went steady in college. They got back together recently, much to the disgust of Matt&#x27;s friends, then broke up again. She looks down on almost all of Matt&#x27;s hobbies and interests (except for &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;), even though she is an excellent gamer. Kayleigh is a journalist for a local newspaper.
* Maxwell and Claire were also featured in &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine. Little is known about them save that they are married and enthusiastic role-players, although their differences within the hobby often lead to arguments. Maxwell also has a crush on Gilly, which causes a lot of friction.

<doc id="88615" wikidata="Q1190911" url="?curid=88615" title="Christopher Robin">
<text>Christopher Robin is a character created by A. A. Milne, based on his son Christopher Robin Milne. The character appears in the author&#x27;s popular books of poetry and &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; stories, and has subsequently appeared in various Disney adaptations of the Pooh stories.

==Christopher Robin Milne==
Christopher Robin was based on the author A. A. Milne&#x27;s son, Christopher Robin Milne, who later in life became disappointed about the use of his name. Christopher Milne wrote in one of a series of autobiographical works: &quot;It seemed to me almost that my father had got where he was by climbing on my infant shoulders, that he had filched from me my good name and left me nothing but empty fame,&quot; One of the poems, &quot;Vespers&quot; – which describes young Christopher Robin saying his evening prayers – was said by Christopher Milne as &quot;the one work that has brought me over the years more toe-curling, fist-clenching, lip-biting embarrassment than any other.&quot;

==In the books==
Christopher Robin appears in Milne&#x27;s poems and in the two books: &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; (1926) and &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot; (1928). In the books he is a young boy and one of Winnie-the-Pooh&#x27;s best friends. His other friends are Eeyore, Kanga and Roo, Rabbit, Piglet, Owl, and Tigger. In the second book, there are hints that Christopher Robin is growing up. In the final chapter, the inhabitants of the Forest throw him a farewell party after learning he must leave them soon. It is implied that he will attend boarding school; Christopher Robin Milne, for whom the stories were originally developed, left home to attend Stowe School at age 9.

In addition to both Pooh books, the character was immortalized in other works by A. A. Milne including two books of poems: &quot;When We Were Very Young&quot; (1924) and &quot;Now We Are Six&quot; (1927). An arrangement of one of the poems, &quot;Buckingham Palace&quot;, was first recorded by Ann Stephens in July 1941. Petula Clark released a recording of it in 1953 to coincide with the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

In David Benedictus&#x27;s 2009 authorized sequel &quot;Return to the Hundred Acre Wood&quot;, Christopher Robin was at school, but during the summer break he returns to the forest for a visit with a lot of knowledge to share. Though slightly older, he is still the same person as before and is happy to share more good times with his friends all summer. At the end of the summer, he has to leave again for another school year, but the animals know they will see him again.

Christopher Robin is cheerful, compassionate, adventurous, fun-loving, imaginative, and helpful. Despite being a child, he is much wiser and more mature than many of the other characters, and is someone Pooh and the others look up to. In the book illustrations, his house appears as a hollow tree with a door at the top of the forest.

==Disney adaptations==

Since 1966, Disney has released numerous features starring Winnie-the-Pooh and related characters. Christopher Robin appears in all of the Disney animated adaptations except for &quot;Welcome to Pooh Corner&quot;, &quot;Boo to You Too! Winnie the Pooh&quot;, &quot;Springtime with Roo&quot;, and &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Heffalump Halloween Movie&quot;. But in most of the cartoons, he is only a supporting character, sometimes only appearing in a few scenes or episodes; in &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Heffalump Movie&quot;, he only appears during the credits. His personality is virtually the same as in the books, but he attends day school instead of boarding school.

Christopher Robin&#x27;s bedroom, but not Christopher Robin himself, appears in live-action opening sequences. In the world within his storybooks, his house appears just as it does in E. H. Shepard&#x27;s illustrations.

An English boy living in the Ashdown Forest, Christopher Robin has brown hair. He wears a yellow polo shirt with white collar and trim on his short sleeves, blue shorts, white socks and black Mary Jane shoes (or sometimes red sneakers). On several appropriate occasions, he plays a snare drum.

&quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; re-imagines him as an American boy living in the suburban house 100 Acre Road whose backyard connects directly to the Hundred Acre Wood. His mother also appears in the series and Robin is apparently their surname in that continuity.

Some of these elements were reused for &quot;The Book of Pooh&quot;, but the animals are once again characters in Christopher Robin&#x27;s storybook. His hollow tree house does not appear from both series.

Christopher Robin has appeared on the television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot; with his friends in cameo appearances. While he does not appear in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; video game series, in this continuity the &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; book belongs to Merlin and Christopher Robin&#x27;s role is played out mostly by Sora. He only appears in two episodes of &quot;My Friends Tigger and Pooh&quot; but in the whole series, he is absent and is replaced by his younger friend Darby, a feisty red-headed girl who is the main protagonist and hosts the series.

His appearance was updated for the 2011 film. He also appears with the same appearance as a playable character in the video game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;.

In the &quot;Doc McStuffins&quot; crossover special &quot;Into the Hundred Acre Wood!&quot;, Christopher Robin visits Doc&#x27;s toy hospital searching for Pooh, who has been admitted as a patient. Christopher Robin and Doc bond through their shared ability to talk to toys. The character is voiced by Oliver Bell.

Ewan McGregor played a grown-up version of the character in the 2018 Disney live-action film &quot;Christopher Robin&quot;, while Orton O&#x27;Brien portrays the character as a child. In this film adaptation, the now adult Christopher is director of efficiency at a luggage company, and Pooh ultimately helps him to devise a plan to significantly decrease the company&#x27;s expenditures.

Christopher Robin has a cameo appearance in the 2023 short film &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;, where, together with his friends, he tries to help Pooh when he is stuck in a photo frame, and being part of the Walt Disney Animation Studios characters who gather to take a group photo.

===Portrayals===
Of the nine main characters, Christopher Robin has the most voice actors. He has been voiced by the following:
* Bruce Reitherman: &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree&quot;
* Jon Walmsley: &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot;, &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; (also re-recorded Christopher&#x27;s lines for &quot;Honey Tree&quot;)
* Timothy Turner: &quot;Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too&quot;
* Kim Christianson: &quot;Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore&quot;
* Tim Hoskins: &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;
* Edan Gross: &quot;Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too&quot;
* Brady Bluhm: &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin&quot;, &quot;A Winnie the Pooh Thanksgiving&quot;, &quot;A Valentine for You&quot; and &quot;Winnie the Pooh: Seasons of Giving&quot;
* Frankie J. Galasso: &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin&quot; (singing voice)
* Tom Attenborough: &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot;
* Tom Wheatley: &quot;Piglet&#x27;s Big Movie&quot;
* Kath Soucie: &quot;Piglet&#x27;s Big Movie&quot; (singing voice)
* William Green: &quot;A Very Merry Pooh Year&quot;
* Paul Tiesler: &quot;The Book of Pooh&quot;
* Struan Erlenborn: &quot;My Friends Tigger and Pooh&quot;
* Jack Boulter: &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;
* Oliver Bell: &quot;Doc McStuffins&quot;

Reitherman, Hoskins, Gross and Tiesler are the only actors to use an American accent for the character. All others use received pronunciation.

==&quot;Blood and Honey&quot;==
In the 2023 horror film, &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey&quot;, Christopher Robin was played by Nikolai Leon with Frederick Dallaway as young Christopher Robin. Like the 2018 Disney film, Christopher Robin is a grown adult, who sees his old friends again. However, due to leaving them for college five years ago, they are feral, and go on a rampage. He is depicted as a victim rather than a killer like his friends, because of the torture his former friends did to him.

<text>Eeyore ( ) is a fictional character in the &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; books by A. A. Milne. He is an old, grey stuffed donkey and friend of the title character, Winnie-the-Pooh. Eeyore is generally characterised as pessimistic, depressed, and anhedonic.

==A. A. Milne books==
Eeyore appears in chapters 4, 6, 7, and 10 of &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; and is mentioned in a few others. He also appears in every chapter of &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot; except chapter 7. His name is an onomatopoeic representation of the braying sound made by a normal donkey, usually represented as &quot;hee haw&quot; in American English: the spelling with an &quot;r&quot; is explained by the fact that Milne and most of his intended audience spoke a non-rhotic variety of English in which the &quot;r&quot; in &quot;Eeyore&quot; is not pronounced as /r/.

Physically, Eeyore is described as an &quot;old grey donkey&quot;. In Ernest H. Shepard&#x27;s illustrations, he appears to be about chin-high to Pooh and about hip-high to Christopher Robin. He has a long, detachable tail with a pink bow on the end, of which he is very fond, but which he is also prone to losing (Owl once mistakes it for a bell-pull). Christopher Robin is able to reattach the tail with a drawing pin.

In &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot;, Eeyore&#x27;s level of literacy is unclear. When Christopher Robin shows him the letter &quot;A&quot;, Eeyore does not understand its meaning, knowing only that &quot;it means learning&quot;, something he desperately wants to be seen as having, but he angrily destroys the letter after finding that Rabbit (who is quite literate) knows about it already. Nevertheless, he spells his own name &quot;eoR&quot; when signing the &quot;rissolution&quot; (resolution) that the animals give Christopher Robin as a farewell present in the final chapter. Eeyore also wrote the awkwardly-rhymed poem called &quot;POEM&quot;, which appeared on the &quot;rissolution&quot;, making him the only character in the Winnie-the-Pooh books other than Pooh himself who attempts to write poetry (a fact that Eeyore himself notes). When Pooh humbly declares that Eeyore&#x27;s poetry is better than his own, &quot;really believing it to be true&quot;, Eeyore vainly replies that &quot;it was meant to be&quot;.

Eeyore has a poor opinion of most of the other animals in the Forest, describing them as having &quot;No brain at all, some of them&quot;, &quot;only grey fluff that&#x27;s blown into their heads by mistake&quot; (from chapter 1 of &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot;). Eeyore&#x27;s favorite food is thistles. He lives in the southeast corner of the Hundred Acre Wood, in an area labeled &quot;Eeyore&#x27;s Gloomy Place: Rather Boggy and Sad&quot; on the map in the &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; book. He has a stick house therein called The House at Pooh Corner. Pooh and Piglet built it for him after accidentally mistaking the original house that Eeyore built for a pile of sticks. On Eeyore&#x27;s birthday, he is given an empty honey jar from Pooh for keeping things in, a popped red balloon from Piglet to keep in the pot, and a note from Owl.

Eeyore is also surprisingly good at the game Poohsticks, winning more times than anyone else when it is played in the sixth chapter.

==Adaptations==
===Disney adaptations===

Eeyore appears in the &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; cartoons produced by The Walt Disney Company. He is somewhat less caustic and sarcastic in the Disney version than in Milne&#x27;s original stories. Though often a supporting character, &quot;Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore&quot; focuses on him. He is physically one of the stronger animals and is often treated as a pack animal whenever a plot calls for one. His house is regularly knocked down, but he always rebuilds it. He usually expects misfortune to happen to him, accepts it when it does and rarely even tries to prevent it. His catchphrases are &quot;Thanks for noticin&#x27; me&quot; and &quot;Ohhh-kayyy&quot;. His pessimistic outlook was also shown in an encounter with Piglet, who cheerfully bade him &quot;Good morning!&quot; Eeyore responded, &quot;Well, I suppose it is...for some.&quot;

Despite his depressive nature, Eeyore is capable of great compassion, whereas in the books he is more apathetic. Several episodes of &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; exemplify this, including &quot;Donkey for a Day&quot;, &quot;Stripes&quot;, &quot;Home is Where the Home is&quot; and &quot;Eeyi Eeyi Eeyore&quot;. Eeyore is usually one of the core group of animals, along with Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit and Tigger. Of these five, he is the most reluctant to go along with their plans or adventures, but does not oppose them because he believes it to be futile to try.

In the adaptations, Eeyore has developed a close friendship with Tigger. Despite their opposite personalities, Eeyore&#x27;s passive nature and Tigger&#x27;s optimism and outgoingness help them to accept each other&#x27;s flaws and understand each other better. Their closeness begins at the end of &quot;Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore&quot; and continues in later works such as &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;, &quot;A Winnie the Pooh Thanksgiving&quot; and the &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; film.

His tail was not always fixed to him by a nail, although Disney has chosen this as part of his permanent image. When Eeyore lost his tail, Owl found it and used it as a bell-pull beside his door before Pooh found it for Eeyore. Christopher Robin then pinned it back on. According to &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree&quot;, this was possible because Eeyore is full of sawdust. In Disney merchandise, Eeyore sometimes has an uncharacteristic smile. In animation, Eeyore is coloured his natural grey, though he is coloured blue with a pink muzzle in merchandising. He appears at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts for meet and greets.

====Casting history====
Eeyore was voiced by Ralph Wright in the original featurettes, although Ron Feinberg filled in as his voice in the short film &quot;Winnie the Pooh Discovers the Seasons&quot;. Thurl Ravenscroft voiced him for Disneyland Records. Ron Gans took over the role for &quot;Welcome to Pooh Corner&quot; and was succeeded by Peter Cullen in &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; through &quot;My Friends Tigger and Pooh&quot;. Although Cullen was still active when the film &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; was in production, Eeyore was voiced by Bud Luckey for the film. In reference to this, Cullen re-enacted a scene at BotCon to demonstrate a scene where his character Optimus Prime meets Eeyore; Cullen later returned to the role in the 2017 crossover with &quot;Doc McStuffins&quot;. Gregg Berger voiced Eeyore in video games from &quot;My Interactive Pooh&quot; to &quot;&quot;, plus &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; dark ride. Brad Garrett voices Eeyore in the 1990s video games &quot;Disney&#x27;s Animated Storybook: Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree&quot; and &quot;Ready to Read with Pooh&quot;. Garrett reprised the role for the 2018 live-action film &quot;Christopher Robin&quot; and the animated film &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot;. In the 2023 short &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;, Eeyore was voiced by Jim Meskimen. In the 2024 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; Disney+ short (&quot;May the 12th Be with You&quot;) Chris Edgerly voiced Eeyore.

===&quot;Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey&quot;===
In the beginning of the 2023 horror film &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey&quot;, Eeyore was killed while the other animals were starving after Christopher Robin left for college. Eeyore&#x27;s tail was used by Pooh to whip his victims.

<text>A Heffalump is an elephant-like creature in the Winnie-the-Pooh stories by A. A. Milne. Heffalumps are mentioned, and only appear, in Pooh and Piglet&#x27;s dreams in &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; (1926), and are seen again in &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot; (1928). Physically, they resemble elephants; E. H. Shepard&#x27;s illustration shows an Indian elephant. They are later featured in the animated television series &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; (1988–1991), followed by two animated films in 2005, &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Heffalump Movie&quot; and &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Heffalump Halloween Movie&quot;.

== Origins ==
Although the fifth chapter of &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; is titled &quot;In Which Piglet Meets a Heffalump&quot;, Piglet only actually meets a Heffalump in his imagination. In this chapter, Pooh and Piglet bravely attempt to capture a heffalump in a clever trap; however, no heffalumps are ever caught, and indeed they never meet a heffalump in the course of the books. The sole appearance of heffalumps in the books is imagined, as Pooh tries to put himself to sleep:

In the third chapter of &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot;, Pooh and Piglet fall into a similar trap (it is implied it was the same trap) and think that it was made by a Heffalump to catch them. Pooh and Piglet rehearse the conversation they will have when the heffalump comes, but Pooh falls asleep and when Piglet hears a voice, he panics and says the wrong thing. He is mortified when the voice turns out to be that of Christopher Robin.

== Explanation ==
Although this is not explicitly stated, it is generally thought that heffalumps are elephants from a child&#x27;s viewpoint (the word &quot;heffalump&quot; being a child&#x27;s attempt at pronouncing &quot;elephant&quot;). Shepard&#x27;s illustrations in Milne&#x27;s books depict heffalumps (in Piglet&#x27;s dreams) as looking much like elephants.

=== Disney version ===
In Disney&#x27;s adaptations of the stories, Heffalumps are first mentioned in the 1968 featurette &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day and later The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;, and seem to be a product of Tigger&#x27;s imagination. They appeared with their partners, the woozles, in a song called &quot;Heffalumps and Woozles&quot; during a nightmare that Pooh has. Here, Tigger described them as honey-eating creatures. In both the animated films and all subsequent television series, they are also depicted as looking like elephants, albeit slightly cuddlier and less fierce than those Pooh imagines in the books, with rabbit-like tails and stitches as would be found on a stuffed animal.
In the animated television series &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;, most heffalumps are enemies of Pooh and his friends. They are known to steal honey and are often associated with woozles. One particular heffalump named Heff was the dim-witted sidekick of Stan the Woozle and was afraid of Roo because he thought Roo was a giant mouse.

Piglet befriended a young heffalump named Junior in two episodes of &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;. Junior lived with his parents, Papa Heffalump (voiced by Jim Cummings) and Mama Heffalump. Mama Heffalump often had to remind Papa Heffalump of his many allergies.
&quot;Pooh&#x27;s Heffalump Movie&quot;, released in 2005, looks at the differences between the denizens of the Hundred Acre Wood, and the Heffalumps, cleared up after Roo becomes friends with a Heffalump named Lumpy. A sequel to this movie called &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Heffalump Halloween Movie&quot;, was later released. Lumpy later appears in the television program &quot;My Friends Tigger &amp; Pooh&quot;, where he continues to appear as Roo&#x27;s friend and joins the gang on many adventures.

They and the song are also featured in the attraction at the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World, Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland, also called &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;, where the riders travel through the heffalumps and woozles in Pooh&#x27;s dream.

There are several Winnie the Pooh video games where the Heffalumps are an antagonist to the storyline of various levels in &quot;Piglet&#x27;s Big Game&quot; and &quot;Winnie the Pooh’s Rumbly Tumbly Adventure&quot;. Each video game was developed on various platforms such as the Nintendo Gameboy Advance, Nintendo Gamecube, PC, and Sony Playstation 2.

In a fantasy sequence in the 2018 film &quot;Christopher Robin&quot;, when the title character almost drowns in a Heffalump trap, he hallucinates seeing an actual elephant as a Heffalump.

==Cultural impact==

Since the 1950s heffalumps have gained notability beyond the Pooh stories.

* The term &quot;heffalump&quot; is whimsically used by adults to describe an elephant, or a child&#x27;s view of an elephant.
* The term &quot;heffalump trap&quot; has been used in political journalism for a trap that is set up to catch an opponent but ends up trapping the person who set the trap (as happens to Winnie the Pooh in &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot;).
* The protagonist, Gnossos Pappadopoulis, in Richard Fariña&#x27;s 1966 novel &quot;Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me&quot; believes his best friend to be named Heffalump for the majority of the novel, although Gnossos discovers in Cuba that Heffalump&#x27;s birth name was Abraham Jackson White.
* There is an orchestral score called &quot;To Catch a Heffalump&quot; (1971) by Willem Frederik Bon.
* The Swedish newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot;″s Heffalump Award is an annual literary prize awarded to the year&#x27;s best Swedish author for children and young adults.
* A search for &quot;heffalon particles&quot; is the subject of an April Fool&#x27;s Day paper posted on a scientific pre-print server.
* The heffalump operator &quot;=&gt;&quot; is used in the BCPL programming language for structure references.
* The 2018 Cosmo Sheldrake song &quot;Come Along&quot;, featured in an ad for the iPhone XR, contains the line &quot;Come along, catch a Heffalump&quot;.
* The longstanding Labour MP for Liverpool Walton from 1964 to 1991, Eric Heffer, taciturn and portly, was often known in satirical media stories as &quot;The Hefferlump&quot;, initially in Private Eye magazine and then elsewhere.
* The 2020 Song &quot;Heffalumps&quot; by Sematary and Ghost Mountain references Heffalumps.
* In March 2024, shortly after &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2&quot; was released, it was announced that &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 3&quot; had entered development, and will feature Heffalumps.
* The videogame Diplomacy is not an Option features Heffalumps.

<doc id="88622" wikidata="Q246930" url="?curid=88622" title="Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)">
<text>Kanga is a character in A. A. Milne&#x27;s books Winnie-the-Pooh (1926) and The House at Pooh Corner (1928). A female kangaroo and the mother of Roo, she is the only female character in Milne&#x27;s Pooh books. Kanga and Roo are the only pair of animals of the same species in the books, and their close relationship is emphasized by the combination of their names (&quot;Kanga-Roo&quot;). The maternal instinct, in addition to Kanga&#x27;s desire to always keep Roo close to her, in her pouch, is also evident in Kanga&#x27;s willingness to adopt the newly arrived Tigger.

==Origin==

Like many other characters in the Winnie-the-Pooh books, Kanga is associated with a stuffed toy that was an early childhood present to Milne&#x27;s son, Christopher Robin Milne. Milne himself noted that after his son got a bear (the future Winnie-the-Pooh), a donkey (Eeyore), and a piglet (Piglet), gifted to him on separate occasions by different people, the tiger (Tigger) and kangaroo were acquired &quot;not just for the delight they might give to their new owner, but also for their literary possibilities&quot;.

Most critics agree that Kanga reflects the British nanny type, possibly the &quot;Nanny&quot; described in Christopher Milne&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Enchanted Places&quot;.

==Profile==
Like other characters in the Milne&#x27;s children books, Kanga is portrayed in an &quot;impressionist&quot; manner: a dominant trait is defined early and refined in a one-dimensional way. Kanga always stays motherly as the story unfolds, just like Tigger keeps being bouncy. The choice of animal assists in this unidimensional development of a character, with real-life female kangaroo protecting an offspring for months after birth literally within her body. Along with Rabbit, Eeyore, and Owl, Kanga is one of the four &quot;staid&quot; adult characters, in contrast to the adolescent Tigger (who still need a mother&#x27;s firm hand, lent by Kanga), baby Roo, and somewhere-in-between Pooh and Piglet. Yarbrough considers her to be the only &quot;adult&quot; in the forest. Despite her staid appearance, however, Kanga fully participates in the nonsensical humor and physicality of the stories, Pooh is envious of her jumping.

Motherly role of Kanga is evident in her behavior towards other characters: unlike the wise Owl&#x27;s, her concerns are purely practical, for example, she chastises Owl for the mess he made in his house. In her complete devotion to family affairs (a trait quite foreign to Rabbit), she often goes far, using the only punishments in the books: she bathes Roo in cold water and warns him not to become &quot;small and weak like Piglet&quot;. Christopher Robin considers her to be one of the &quot;Fiercer Animals&quot;. Piglet seconds, &quot;if One of the Fiercer Animal is Deprived of Its Young, it becomes as fierce as Two of the Fiercer Animals&quot;.

Kanga, like Tigger, is an outsider not quite fitting in with the rest of the forest crowd.

<doc id="88626" wikidata="Q836719" url="?curid=88626" title="Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)">
<text>Piglet is a fictional character from A. A. Milne&#x27;s &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; books. Piglet is Winnie‑the‑Pooh&#x27;s closest friend amongst all the toys and animals featured in the stories. Although he is a &quot;Very Small Animal&quot; of a generally timid disposition, he tries to be brave and on occasion conquers his fears.

==In the books==
Piglet is introduced in the text from Chapter III of &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;, although he is shown earlier in one of the illustrations for Chapter II. He also appears in Chapters V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X, as well as every chapter of &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot;. Piglet is best friends with Pooh and is also especially close to Christopher Robin and the rest of the main characters.

Like most of the characters, Piglet was based on one of Christopher Robin Milne&#x27;s stuffed animals. In the original colour versions of Ernest H. Shepard&#x27;s illustrations in the Winnie‑the‑Pooh books, Piglet has pale pink skin and a green jumper. He is smaller than most animals, being only slightly taller than Roo. His voice is described as &quot;squeaky&quot;.

Piglet&#x27;s adventures in the first book include hunting Woozles, attempting to capture Heffalumps, giving Eeyore a birthday balloon (popped), impersonating Roo in an attempt to trick Kanga, joining the Expotition to the North Pole, and being trapped by a flood. In the second book, he helps build a house for Eeyore, meets Tigger, finds Small while trapped in a gravel pit, plays Poohsticks, gets lost in the mist, and helps rescue Pooh and Owl after they are trapped in Owl&#x27;s fallen house. For that last feat, Piglet is the subject of a seven-verse &quot;Respectful Pooh Song&quot; that Pooh composes for him.

Piglet himself can read and write, at least well enough for short notes. In the illustrations for &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot;, it appears that Piglet spells his own name &quot;Piglit&quot;, although it is rendered as &quot;Piglet&quot; in the actual text even when describing his signature. In one chapter, Piglet is referred to as &quot;Henry Pootel&quot; by Christopher Robin, who claimed to not recognise Piglet after he was thoroughly cleaned by Kanga. Eeyore likes to refer to him as &quot;Little Piglet&quot;.

Piglet&#x27;s favourite food is acorns (or as the book often spells it, &quot;haycorns&quot;). At one point he plants one just outside his house, in hopes of someday having a handy supply. He lives in a house in a beech tree in the Hundred Acre Wood, next to a sign which says &quot;TRESPASSERS W&quot;. An illustration shows that the sign is broken off after the &quot;W.&quot; According to Piglet, that is &quot;short for Trespassers Will, which is short for Trespassers William&quot;, which was the name of his grandfather (this was a parody of the usual sign &quot;Trespassers will be prosecuted&quot;). Later in &quot;The House at Pooh Corner,&quot; Eeyore mistakenly offers Piglet&#x27;s house as a new home for Owl, after Owl&#x27;s house had blown down. Piglet nobly agrees to let Owl have the house, at which point Pooh asks Piglet to live with him and Piglet accepts.

== Adaptations ==
In 1960, the His Master&#x27;s Voice recorded a dramatised version with songs (music by Harold Fraser-Simson) of two episodes from &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot; (Chapters 2 and 8), with Penny Morrell as Piglet, which was released on a 45rpm EP.

===Disney adaptations===

Piglet was originally omitted by Disney in the first Pooh film, &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree&quot; (1966). According to the film&#x27;s director, Wolfgang Reitherman, Piglet was replaced by Gopher, which was thought to have a more &quot;folksy, all-American, grass-roots image&quot;. Many familiar with the classic Milne books protested Disney&#x27;s decision to exclude Piglet, and Disney relented. Piglet appeared in the next Pooh film, &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot; (1968).

Disney&#x27;s interpretation of Piglet has pink skin and a magenta jumper. His fears and nervousness are played up more, as he runs and hides when unnecessary and often stutters when nervous. He has a lot of hidden courage and often faces danger to help others, even when afraid. Stories about him tend to revolve around these traits as well as his small size.

In the Disney cartoons, Piglet is very kindhearted, loves beautiful things like flowers, and prefers keeping things neat and tidy. He sometimes has an inferiority complex, although his friends think highly of him. However, he is often left performing tasks better suited to someone bigger and stronger, such as in several episodes of &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; or the 2011 film.

Piglet can be found at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts for meet and greets. He appears less frequently than Pooh, Tigger, and Eeyore, but more than Rabbit. Piglet also made a brief cameo in the 1988 movie &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. He was featured as one of the guests in &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. Piglet also makes a cameo appearance in the DreamWorks animated film &quot;Bee Movie&quot; along with Pooh; at one point, a man spies Pooh and Piglet eating honey and Barry tells him to &quot;take him out&quot; with a tranquiliser dart.

====Casting history====
John Fiedler provided the voice for Piglet from 1968 until his death on June 25, 2005, except in &quot;Welcome to Pooh Corner&quot; where Phil Baron voiced him. Fiedler&#x27;s last appearance as Piglet&#x27;s voice was in &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Heffalump Halloween Movie&quot;, notably being the longest-remaining original cast member in the series.

Travis Oates has provided Piglet&#x27;s voice since Fiedler&#x27;s death, including in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; and &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Heffalump Halloween Movie&quot; in certain scenes that Fiedler was unable to record before his death. His first major performance as Piglet was in &quot;My Friends Tigger &amp; Pooh&quot;. He and Jim Cummings were the only actors to return for the 2011 film &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;. Piglet was voiced by Nick Mohammed for the 2018 live-action film &quot;Christopher Robin&quot;.

===Soviet adaptation===
In the Soviet Union, a trilogy of short films about Winnie‑the‑Pooh (Russian language: Винни-Пух, or &quot;Vinni Pukh&quot;) were made by Soyuzmultfilm (directed by Fyodor Khitruk) from 1969 to 1972. In all three films Piglet, renamed Pyatachok (Пятачок, &quot;Pig Snout&quot;) and voiced by Iya Savvina, is Pooh&#x27;s constant companion, even taking Christopher Robin&#x27;s place in the story concerning Pooh and the honey tree. Unlike the Disney adaptations, animators did not rely on Shepard&#x27;s illustrations to depict the characters.

===The Twisted Childhood Universe adaptation===

Piglet is an antagonistic character in the slasher film &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey&quot; (2023) and its sequel &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2&quot; (2024).

===Other media===
Piglet, with the appearance of a small piggy with a green shirt, has a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Bee Movie&quot; (2007).

==Influence on popular culture==
&quot;The Te of Piglet&quot; was written by Benjamin Hoff following the publication of &quot;The Tao of Pooh&quot;. Both books feature the original drawing of E. H. Shepard. &quot;The Te of Piglet&quot; details Piglet&#x27;s exemplification of the Taoist concept of &quot;virtue of the small&quot;.

In 1982, whilst studying at Oxford University as an undergraduate, the columnist and commentator Andrew Sullivan adopted the persona of Piglet in holding office in the University Pooh Sticks Club as cited in the 1987 book &quot;The Oxford Myth&quot;.

<doc id="88630" wikidata="Q246477" url="?curid=88630" title="Rabbit (Winnie-the-Pooh)">
<text>Rabbit is a fictional character in the book series and cartoons &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;. He is a friend of Winnie-the-Pooh, regards himself as practical and tends to take the lead, though not always with the results that he intends.

==In the books==
The first appearance of Rabbit is in chapter II in the &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; book by A. A. Milne. He also appears in chapters VII, VIII, IX and X of that book, as well as in chapters III, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X in &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot;.

While most of the cast in the books are based on stuffed animals owned by Christopher Robin Milne, Ernest H. Shepard&#x27;s illustrations of Rabbit look more like a living animal. Rabbit resembles an ordinary rabbit, except that he walks on two legs and uses his front paws as hands. The top of his head reaches about to Pooh&#x27;s nose.

Rabbit lives in a house in the north-central part of the Hundred Acre Wood, between the sandy pit where Roo plays and the area where the animals he calls his &quot;Friends-and-Relations&quot; live. Rabbit likes to take charge and come up with elaborate plans, such as the one to scare Kanga by hiding Roo, and the one to &quot;unbounce&quot; Tigger. He is also an organizer, as in the case of the Search for Small. As detailed as his plans are, they often miss certain key points and go wrong.

Rabbit tends to include Pooh and Piglet in his plans, and he goes to Owl when there is &quot;thinking to be done&quot;. He likes to be put in charge of things and is sometimes bossy, and he sees his relationship to Christopher Robin as being the one that Christopher depends on. While loyal to the friends he knows, Rabbit shows a certain reluctance to welcome newcomers, as evidenced by his initial negative reaction to the arrival of Kanga and Roo in the first book, and to Tigger in the second book. Nonetheless, he warms up to all of them in time.

While the literacy (or lack thereof) of Pooh, Owl, and Eeyore becomes a plot point in &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot;, Rabbit&#x27;s ease with reading and writing is taken for granted.

Rabbit also has good relationships with the minor animals in the forest, known as &quot;Rabbit&#x27;s Friends-and-Relations&quot;. Several are mentioned by name, including beetles called Small, Alexander Beetle and Henry Rush, and three unspecified creatures called Smallest-of-All, Late, and Early. According to the illustrations of the book, his Friends-and-Relations include other rabbits, a squirrel, a hedgehog, mice, and insects. At one point, Rabbit estimates that he would need &quot;seventeen pockets&quot; if he were going to carry all his family about with him. Whether that number refers just to his relatives or to the friends-and-relations as a group is unknown, if it had any basis at all.

In &quot;Return to the Hundred Acre Wood&quot;, a sequel not written by A. A. Milne but by David Benedictus, Rabbit tries to organize things further. He tries to have a census in the forest, but it does not work out very well. Rabbit also attempts to teach a Household Management class and is the one who discovers Lottie the otter. His grandfather, Grandad Buck, appears in the book.

== Disney adaptations==

Rabbit appears in most Disney &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; cartoons, but he is cream yellow in color, instead of brown. An added element is his keeping of a garden, of which he is strongly protective, becoming angered when any creature seeks to damage it. Although he is not described as having a garden in either of the A. A. Milne books, he has one in David Benedictus&#x27;s &quot;Return to the Hundred Acre Wood&quot;.

The Disney adaptations also develop his personality further, expanding the original organized character into a by-the-book control freak with a short temper, although his care for his friends remains. The film character&#x27;s willingness to do things by the book appeared in &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin&quot;, in which he consistently follows written instructions for fear of being unable to think well for himself, although he later produces a competent plan. Despite occasional malevolent behavior, he always learns from his wrongdoing; while a leading character in the film &quot;Springtime with Roo&quot;, he abandons his selfishness after considering the possibility that it will drive all of the other characters away from the forest.

In the Disney adaptations, Rabbit and Tigger are usually foils for each other. In the original featurettes, Rabbit outright dislikes Tigger. By &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;, however, they have become close friends, though very dysfunctional ones, who regularly work together. Tigger&#x27;s antics continue to annoy Rabbit and make trouble for him, while Rabbit&#x27;s harsh attitude and attempts to teach Tigger a lesson still come off as unkind. Nevertheless, Tigger is usually the first one to help Rabbit when he needs it and Rabbit cannot deny their closeness.

His character is consistent in most of the Disney adaptations, although in &quot;Welcome to Pooh Corner&quot;, he is a talented magician and in &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;, he is pale green instead of yellow. At one point in the latter series, Rabbit adopts a bluebird named Kessie. , Rabbit now appears at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, FL and Disneyland in Anaheim, CA for meet and greets.

==Casting history==
Junius Matthews was the voice of Rabbit in the first three Disney films. After his death, Ray Erlenborn briefly voiced him in &quot;Winnie the Pooh Discovers the Seasons&quot;. Will Ryan took over the role for &quot;Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore&quot; and performed both Rabbit and Tigger in &quot;Welcome to Pooh Corner&quot;.

Ken Sansom replaced Ryan beginning with &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; and is to date Rabbit&#x27;s longest-running portrayer, having continued the voice up to and including &quot;My Friends Tigger and Pooh&quot;. Tom Kenny provided the voice for the 2011 film, &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;. Peter Capaldi voiced Rabbit in &quot;Christopher Robin&quot;, the live-action extension of the Winnie the Pooh franchise.

<doc id="88632" wikidata="Q249081" url="?curid=88632" title="Roo">
<text>Roo is a fictional character created in 1926 by A. A. Milne and first featured in the book &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;. He is a young kangaroo (known as a joey) and his mother is Kanga. Like most other Pooh characters, Roo is based on a stuffed toy animal that belonged to Milne&#x27;s son, Christopher Robin Milne. Though stuffed, Roo was lost in the 1930s in an apple orchard somewhere in Sussex.

Roo participates in the adventures of a teddy bear called Winnie-the-Pooh and his friends Piglet, a small toy pig; Eeyore, a toy donkey; Owl, a live owl; Rabbit, a live rabbit; and Christopher Robin, a human boy. Roo is introduced in the chapter entitled &quot;In Which Kanga and Baby Roo Come to the Forest and Piglet has a Bath.&quot; Roo&#x27;s friend Tigger does not appear until the sequel, &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot;. He would subsequently appear in various cartoons and other adaptations.

==Profile==

Roo is a young kangaroo, or joey. His mother is called Kanga. &quot;The New York Times&quot; has noted that inquiring about the fate of Roo&#x27;s father is one of many questions that could be asked, such as &quot;Where are Pooh&#x27;s pants?&quot;

Because of his young age, Roo is a very small animal, the smallest in the story (other than Rabbit&#x27;s friends and relations, and Alexander Beetle), although he must be very close in size to Piglet since Kanga is unable to tell the difference when Piglet jumps into her pouch instead of Roo. (In Ernest H. Shepard&#x27;s illustrations, Roo appears to be very slightly smaller than Piglet.) He is also apparently small enough to fall down mouse holes while practicing jumps, and too small to reach the first rail of the Poohsticks bridge.

Like most of the characters in Winnie-the Pooh, Roo was based on one of Christopher Robin Milne&#x27;s stuffed toys. The illustrations show Roo with brown fur and an upturned tail.

Roo and Kanga come to the Forest &quot;in the usual way&quot; in Chapter VII of &quot;Winnie–the–Pooh&quot;. He also appears in Chapter VIII, is mentioned in Chapter IX, and appears again in Chapter X of that book. In &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot;, Roo appears in chapters II, IV, VI, VII, IX, and X, and is mentioned in a few others. Some of the adventures that Roo experiences include being &quot;kidnapped&quot; by Rabbit, accompanying the &quot;expotition&quot; to the North Pole (and getting an impromptu swimming lesson), attending Christopher Robin&#x27;s party for Pooh, getting stuck in a tree with Tigger, and playing Poohsticks.

Unlike many of the other characters in the Pooh books, Roo does not have a known favorite food, although his mother makes him watercress sandwiches on occasion. He dislikes the extract of malt that his mother gives him as &quot;strengthening medicine&quot; after meals, though he will reluctantly take it.

Some of Roo&#x27;s friends include Tigger, Winnie-the-Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, Rabbit, Owl, and Christopher Robin.

==Adaptations==
Roo appears in the Shirley Temple&#x27;s Storybook episode, played by Louis Jean Norman.

Roo is planned to appear in the 2026 film &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 3&quot;.

===Disney adaptation===
Roo also appears in the Disney cartoon versions of the &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; stories.

In the cartoons, Roo is the smallest of the regularly appearing characters. He has brown fur and wears a light blue shirt. He often expresses thoughts and feelings that make him seem wiser than his years. In fact, on occasion Roo seems even wiser than many of the older characters.

He states that he&#x27;s got a mother (Kanga) when he tries to comfort Tigger in &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot;. He appeared in &quot;Piglet&#x27;s Big Movie&quot; and his own direct-to-video movie, &quot;Springtime with Roo&quot;.

Roo becomes good friends with Lumpy the Heffalump in &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Heffalump Movie&quot;.

Roo appeared as one of the guests in &quot;House of Mouse&quot; and &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse&quot;.

Roo made his first live action appearance in the 2018 film &quot;Christopher Robin&quot;, voiced by Sara Sheen.

==Satirical psychological study==
A tongue-in-cheek psychological study of Roo was published in the year 2000, by pediatricians at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in the &quot;Canadian Medical Association Journal&quot; during its end of year issue in April; which publishes lighter more parody-style content. This Canadian team was following the trend of analyzing famous art works, to point out that even wonderful people can have disorders. Reuters reported as follows about the Canadian study:
The researchers said they are especially worried about baby Roo, who is growing up in a single-parent household and whose closest friend, Tigger, is not a good role model. &quot;We predict we will someday see a delinquent, jaded, adolescent Roo hanging out late at night at the top of the forest, the ground littered with broken bottles of extract of malt and the butts of smoked thistle,&quot; the article said.

<doc id="88639" wikidata="Q1278035" url="?curid=88639" title="Skywarn">
<text>Skywarn (sometimes stylized as SKYWARN) is a program of the National Weather Service (NWS). Its mission is to collect reports of localized severe weather in the United States. These reports are used to aid forecasters in issuing and verifying severe weather watches and warnings and to improve the forecasting and warning processes and the tools used to collect meteorological data. Reports are also used by local emergency managers and public safety organizations.

Skywarn consists of a network of severe storm spotters who observe weather conditions and make reports of severe weather to their local NWS offices. These spotters are regularly trained by personnel from the local NWS offices. In many areas, classes are conducted each spring in advance of the coming severe weather season. Many SKYWARN spotters use methods to communicate with one another during severe storm events. A notable example of this is through the use of amateur radio nets, which is still an important method since severe weather can significantly disrupt local telecommunications systems. The program began in 1965, and counts over 300,000 active trained spotters.

== Storm spotting ==
Where severe storms are possible, storm spotting groups such as Skywarn in the United States coordinate amateur radio operators and localized spotters to keep track of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. Reports from spotters and chasers are given to the National Weather Service so that they have ground truth information to warn the general public. Spotting provides ground information and localized conditions that the National Weather Service might not know the extent or might not otherwise be aware of. They typically report events, such as structures struck by lightning, rotating wall clouds, funnel clouds—or conditions that exceed specific thresholds, such as extremely strong winds, significant hail or very heavy rainfall. The exact reporting thresholds can vary by region and may even dynamically change during a severe weather event. Spotters also give reports during winter storms, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. Some spotters also play a role in damage assessment after a disaster, by reporting or documenting areas of damage, and by helping to formulate preliminary damage estimates (such as for tornadoes).

Other countries have similar programs, such as the Canadian spotting program Canwarn, the SkyWarnUK and the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) programs in the United Kingdom, and Skywarn Europe for several European countries.

==Training==

The NWS sponsors Skywarn training sessions in the US. These sessions usually occupy two hours, and focus on hazard identification and communication along with spotter strategies and safety. NWS recommends attendance at refresher courses every two years.

=== Methods of participation ===
Skywarn has long been associated with ham radio. Many NWS offices maintain an amateur radio station that is manned by amateur radio operators during times of severe weather. This allows licensed amateur radio spotters to transmit their severe weather reports directly to the NWS and receive up-to-date severe weather updates even if regular communications are disrupted or overloaded by the weather emergency. It does, however, require 1) the cooperation of the local Weather Forecast Office (WFO), and 2) that the station be manned continuously during severe weather events. Ham radio nets can operate to gather and relay information via landline telephone or Internet. Automatic weather station observations and spotter positions can be provided by the Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS), which can also accommodate text message. Participation in the Skywarn program does not require an amateur radio license. More than half of all Skywarn spotters are &quot;not&quot; licensed amateur radio operators.

Many Skywarn spotters are members of emergency services such as volunteer fire departments, rescue squads, ambulance units, or police or sheriff&#x27;s departments. 

The NWS encourages anyone with an interest in public service and access to some method of communication, such as amateur radio, telephone, the Internet, etc. to join the Skywarn program. Volunteers include police and fire personnel, dispatchers, EMS workers, public utility workers, truck drivers, mariners, aircraft pilots, and other concerned private citizens. Individuals affiliated with hospitals, schools, churches, nursing homes or who have a responsibility for protecting others are also strongly encouraged to become spotters.

Those without radio communication capability can still make their reports via cell phone, landline telephone, or the Internet.

<doc id="88651" wikidata="Q181227" url="?curid=88651" title="Jörmungandr">
<text>In Norse mythology, Jörmungandr (, see Etymology), also known as the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent (, &quot;worm of Midgard&quot;), is an unfathomably large and monstrous sea serpent or worm who dwells in the world sea, encircling the Earth (Midgard) and biting its own tail, an example of an ouroboros. As a result of him surrounding Midgard, the beast is referred to as the World Serpent. Jörmungandr releasing his tail is one of the signs of the beginning of Ragnarök.

Jörmungandr is said to be the middle child of the god Loki and the jötunn Angrboða. According to the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Odin took Loki&#x27;s three children by Angrboða – the wolf Fenrir, underworld ruler Hel, and the serpent Jörmungandr – and removed them from Asgard (the world of the Æsir). The serpent Jörmungandr was tossed into the great ocean that encircles Midgard. There the serpent grew so large that he was able to surround the Earth and grasp his own tail. The old Norse thunder god, Thor, has an ongoing feud with Jörmungandr and the two can be seen as archfoes. During Ragnarök, Thor and Jörmungandr will fight each other to the death.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Jǫrmungandr&quot; is a poetic title and consists of the prefix &quot;jǫrmun-&quot; and the word &quot;gandr&quot;. The prefix &quot;jǫrmun-&quot; denotes something huge, vast, or superhuman. The word &quot;gandr&quot; can mean a variety of things in Old Norse, but mainly refers to elongated entities and or supernatural beings. Gandr can refer to, among other things: snake, fjord, river, staff, cane, mast, penis, bind, and the like (mainly in a &quot;supernatural&quot; or &quot;living&quot; sense). The term &quot;Jörmungandr&quot; therefore has several possible meanings in connection with its mythology, such as: &quot;the vast serpent&quot;, &quot;the vast river&quot; (a synonym for the sea where he dwells), &quot;the vast staff or stick&quot; (a connection to the world tree Yggdrasil), as well as &quot;the vast bind&quot; (the serpent&#x27;s coiling around the world, biting its own tail, symbolising the world&#x27;s circle of life).

== Sources ==
The major sources for myths about Jörmungandr are the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, the skaldic poem &quot;Húsdrápa&quot;, and the Eddic poems &quot;Hymiskviða&quot; and &quot;Völuspá&quot;. Other sources include the early skaldic poem &quot;Ragnarsdrápa&quot; and kennings in other skaldic poems; for example, in &quot;Þórsdrápa&quot;, &quot;faðir lögseims&quot;, &quot;father of the sea-thread&quot;, is used as a kenning for Loki. There are also several image stones depicting the story of Thor fishing for Jörmungandr.

== Stories ==
There are three preserved myths detailing Thor&#x27;s encounters with Jörmungandr:

=== Lifting the cat ===

In one story, Thor encounters the jötunn king Útgarða-Loki and has to perform deeds for him, one of which is a challenge of Thor&#x27;s strength. Útgarða-Loki goads Thor into attempting to lift the World Serpent, disguised by magic as a huge cat. Thor grabs the cat around its midsection but manages to raise the cat only high enough for one of its paws to leave the floor. Útgarða-Loki later explains his deception and that Thor&#x27;s lifting the cat was an impressive deed, as he had stretched the serpent so that it had almost reached the sky. Many watching became fearful when they saw one paw lift off the ground. If Thor had managed to lift the cat completely from the ground, he would have altered the boundaries of the universe.

=== Thor&#x27;s fishing trip ===

Jörmungandr and Thor meet again when Thor goes fishing with the jötunn Hymir. When Hymir refuses to provide Thor with bait, Thor strikes the head off Hymir&#x27;s largest ox to use it. They row to a point where Hymir often sat and caught flatfish and where he drew up two whales. Thor demands to go further out to sea and does so despite Hymir&#x27;s protest. Thor then prepares a strong line and a large hook and baits it with the ox head, which Jörmungandr bites. Thor pulls the serpent from the water, and the two face one another, Jörmungandr blowing atter. Hymir goes pale with fear. As Thor grabs his hammer to kill the serpent, the jötunn cuts the line, leaving the serpent to sink beneath the waves and return to its original position encircling the earth. The Eddic poem &quot;Hymiskviða&quot; has a similar ending to the story, but in earlier Scandinavian versions of the myth in skaldic poetry, Thor successfully captures and kills the serpent by striking it on the head.

Thor&#x27;s fishing for Jörmungandr was one of the most popular motifs in Norse art. Four picture stones that are believed to depict the myth are the Altuna Runestone and the Ardre VIII image stone in Sweden, the Hørdum stone in Denmark, and a stone slab at Gosforth, Cumbria by the same sculptor as the Gosforth Cross. Many of these depictions show the giant cutting the fishing line; on the Altuna stone, Thor is alone, implying he successfully killed the serpent. The Ardre VIII stone may depict more than one stage in the events: a man entering a house where an ox is standing, two men leaving, one with something on his shoulder, and two men using a spear to fish. The image on this stone has been dated to the 8th to 10th century. If the stone is correctly interpreted as a depiction of this myth, it would indicate that the story was preserved essentially unchanged for several centuries prior to the recording of the version in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; around the year 1220.

=== Ragnarök ===
As recounted in Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; based on the Eddic poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, one sign of the coming of Ragnarök is the violent unrest of the sea as Jörmungandr releases its tail from its mouth. The sea will flood and the serpent will thrash onto the land. It will advance, spraying poison to fill the air and water, beside Fenrir, whose eyes and nostrils blaze with fire and whose gape touches the earth and the sky. They will join the sons of Muspell to confront the gods on the plain of Vigrid. Here is where the last meeting between the serpent and Thor is predicted to occur. He will eventually kill Jörmungandr but will fall dead after walking nine paces, having been poisoned by the serpent&#x27;s deadly venom. Thor&#x27;s final battle with Jörmungandr has been identified, with other scenes of Ragnarök, on the Gosforth Cross.

== Analysis ==
Thor&#x27;s fishing for Jörmungandr has been taken as one of the similarities between him and the Hindu god Indra, who in Vedic mythology slays the dragon Vritra, and has also been related to a Balto-Slavic motif of the storm god combatting a serpent. An alternative analysis of the episode by Preben Meulengracht Sørensen is that it was a youthful indiscretion on the part of Thor, retold to emphasize the order and balance of the cosmos, in which Jörmungandr played a vital role. John Lindow draws a parallel between Jörmungandr&#x27;s biting of its own tail and the binding of Fenrir, as part of a recurring theme of the bound monster in Norse mythology, where an enemy of the gods is bound but destined to break free at Ragnarök.

== Eponym ==
Asteroid 471926 Jörmungandr was named after the mythological sea serpent. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 25 September 2018 ().

== Popular culture media appearances ==
Jörmungandr has made a variety of appearances in popculture media. Some notable examples include:
*&quot;Vikings&quot; – Jörmungandr makes an appearance in season six of the History Channel television show Vikings.
*&quot;God of War&quot; – Jörmungandr is a mainstay character in the video games God of War from 2018 and God of War Ragnarök from 2022.
*&quot;For Honor&quot; – Worshipers of Jörmungandr, who are also named after it, are a playable character in the video game series For Honor (2017).

<text>In Norse mythology, Þrymr (&quot;Thrymr&quot;, &quot;Thrym&quot;; &quot;noise&quot;) was a jötunn. He is the namesake of the Eddic poem &quot;Þrymskviða&quot;, in which he stole Thor&#x27;s hammer Mjǫlnir, and the same tale is told in &quot;Þrymlur&quot;. Another mention of Þrymr is in the &quot;þulur&quot; appended to the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, probably deriving from &quot;Þrymskviða&quot;. Three figures named Þrymr, including a king and a jötunn, are mentioned in &quot;Hversu Noregr byggðist&quot;. 

==&quot;Þrymskviða&quot;==
Through Loki, Þrymr conveys his demand for the goddess Freyja&#x27;s hand in marriage as the price for returning Mjǫlnir, which he has buried eight leagues under the ground. When Loki flies to Jǫtunheimar using Freyja&#x27;s feather cloak, he finds Þrymr sitting on a mound, twisting gold leashes for his dogs, and primping his horses&#x27; manes. He is repeatedly described as (&quot;lord of thurses&quot;). To recover his hammer, Thor travels to Jǫtunheimar disguised as Freyja, in bridal drag; when Þrymr peeps under &quot;her&quot; veil, seeking a kiss from his bride, Thor&#x27;s glare sends him reeling the length of the hall. Nonetheless, Þrymr is stupid enough to believe the explanations of &quot;Freyja&#x27;s handmaiden&quot;, Loki. Thor regains his weapon when Þrymr has it brought out and laid in Thor&#x27;s lap to bless their union, and strikes Þrymr dead first, followed by all his assembled kin and following.

==&quot;Hversu Noregr byggðist&quot;==
Three figures named Þrymr are mentioned in &quot;Hversu Noregr byggðist&quot;, which recounts the story of the early settlement of Norway. These figures are:

<text>In Norse mythology, Þrymheimr is a home located in the giants&#x27; territory Jötunheimr. It was the residence of a jötunn, Þjazi, and was inherited by his daughter Skaði, later the wife of Njörðr.

==Abduction of Iðunn and aftermath==
Þjazi, the jötunn who originally owned Þrymheimr, once abducted the goddess Iðunn from the Æsir and kept her captive there. Without Iðunn, whose apples kept them youthful, the Æsir began to age, and arranged a rescue. Þjazi was killed while attempting to recapture her.

After the Þjazi&#x27;s death, his daughter — the giantess / goddess Skaði — inherited and inhabited Þrymheimr. During the course of Skaði&#x27;s marriage to the god Njörðr, the two separated over Skaði&#x27;s preference for her home in Þrymheimr.

==Misspellings vs. alternate forms==
In Old Norse the name &quot;Þrymheimr&quot; is sometimes transliterated as &quot;Thrymheim&quot; in English; it means something like &quot;crash-home&quot;, &quot;Thunder Home&quot;, or &quot;noisy-home&quot;. Manuscripts of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; also contain the spellings Þrumheimr and Þruþheimr. (Þrúðheimr is the home of Thor according to the poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot;.)

Some of the spellings may be intentional: Rudolf Simek translates the variant &quot;Þruþheimr&quot; as &quot;power house&quot; and notes that the variant translation is a fitting name for a jötunn&#x27;s home.

<text>In Norse mythology, Útgarða-Loki (Anglicized as Utgarda-Loki, Utgard-Loki, and Utgardsloki) is the ruler of the castle Útgarðr in Jötunheimr. He is one of the jötnar and his name means literally &quot;Loki of the Outyards&quot; or &quot;Loki of the Outlands&quot;, to distinguish him from Loki, the companion of Thor. He was also known as Skrýmir or Skrymir.

==&quot;Prose Edda&quot;==
In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; (chapter 44), the enthroned figure of Third reluctantly relates a tale in which Thor, Loki and Thor&#x27;s servants, Þjálfi and Röskva are traveling to the east. They arrive at a vast forest in Jötunheimr, and they continue through the woods until dark. The four seek shelter for the night and discover an immense building. Finding shelter in a side room, they experience earthquakes through the night. The earthquakes cause all four to be fearful, except Thor, who grips his hammer in defense. The building turns out to be the huge glove of Skrýmir, who has been snoring throughout the night, causing what seemed to be earthquakes. The next night, all four sleep beneath an oak tree near Skrýmir in fear.
Thor wakes up in the middle of the night, and a series of events occur where Thor twice attempts to destroy the sleeping Skrýmir with his hammer. Skrýmir awakes after each attempt, only to say that he detected an acorn falling on his head or that he wonders if bits of tree from the branches above have fallen on top of him. After the third attempt, Skrýmir gives them advice; if they are going to be cocky at the castle of Útgarðr it would be better for them to turn back now, for Útgarða-Loki&#x27;s men there won&#x27;t put up with it. Skrýmir throws his knapsack onto his back and abruptly goes into the forest and &quot;there is no report that the Æsir expressed hope for a happy reunion&quot;.

The four travelers continue their journey until midday. They find themselves facing a massive castle in an open area. The castle is so tall that they must bend their heads back to their spines to see above it. At the entrance to the castle is a shut gate, and Thor finds that he cannot open it. Struggling, all four squeeze through the bars of the gate, and continue to a large hall. Inside the great hall are two benches, where many generally large people sit on two benches. The four see Útgarða-Loki, the king of the castle, sitting.

Útgarða-Loki says that no visitors are allowed to stay unless they can perform a feat. Loki, standing in the rear of the party, is the first to speak, claiming that he can eat faster than anyone. Loki competes with a being named Logi to consume a trencher full of meat but loses. Útgarða-Loki asks what feat the &quot;young man&quot; can perform, referring to Þjálfi. Þjálfi says that he will attempt to run a race against anyone Útgarða-Loki chooses. Útgarða-Loki says that this would be a fine feat yet that Þjálfi had better be good at running, for he is about to be put to the test. Útgarða-Loki and the group go outside to a level-grounded course.

At the course, Útgarða-Loki calls for a small figure by the name of Hugi to compete with Þjálfi. The first race begins and Þjálfi runs, but Hugi runs to the end of the course and then back again to meet Þjálfi. Útgarða-Loki comments to Þjálfi that he will have to run faster than that, yet notes that he has never seen anyone who has come to his hall run faster than that. Þjálfi and Hugi run a second race. Þjálfi loses by an arrow-shot. Útgarða-Loki comments that Þjálfi has again run a fine race but that he has no confidence that Þjálfi will be able to win a third. A third race between the two commences and Þjálfi again loses to Hugi. Everyone agrees that the contest between Þjálfi and Hugi has been decided.

Thor agrees to compete in a drinking contest but after three immense gulps fails. Thor agrees to lift a large, gray cat in the hall but finds that it arches his back no matter what he does, and that he can only raise a single paw. Thor demands to fight someone in the hall, but the inhabitants say doing so would be demeaning, considering Thor&#x27;s weakness. Útgarða-Loki then calls for his nurse Elli, an old woman. The two wrestle but the harder Thor struggles the more difficult the battle becomes. Thor is finally brought down to a single knee. Útgarða-Loki said to Thor that fighting anyone else would be pointless. As it is now late at night, Útgarða-Loki shows the group to their rooms and they are treated with hospitality.

The next morning the group gets dressed and prepares to leave the keep. Útgarða-Loki appears, has his servants prepare a table, and they all merrily eat and drink. As they leave, Útgarða-Loki asks Thor how he thought he fared in the contests. Thor says that he is unable to say he did well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that Útgarða-Loki will now speak negatively about him. Útgarða-Loki, once the group has left his keep, points out that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had had an inkling of what he was dealing with he would never have allowed the group to enter in the first place. Útgarða-Loki reveals that all was not what it seemed to the group. Útgarða-Loki was in fact the immense Skrýmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first would have killed Skrýmir. In reality, Thor&#x27;s blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.

The contests, too, were an illusion. Útgarða-Loki reveals that Loki had actually competed against wildfire itself (&quot;Logi&quot;, Old Norse &quot;flame&quot;), Þjálfi had raced against thought (&quot;Hugi&quot;, Old Norse &quot;thought&quot;), Thor&#x27;s drinking horn had actually reached to the ocean and with his drinks he lowered the ocean level (resulting in tides). The cat that Thor attempted to lift was in actuality the world serpent, Jörmungandr, and everyone was terrified when Thor was able to lift the paw of this &quot;cat&quot;, for Thor had actually held the great serpent up to the sky. The old woman Thor wrestled was in fact Old Age (&quot;Elli&quot;, Old Norse &quot;old age&quot;), and there is no one whom old age cannot bring down. Útgarða-Loki concludes by telling Thor that it would be better for &quot;both sides&quot; if they did not meet again. Upon hearing this, Thor takes hold of his hammer and swings it at Útgarða-Loki but he disappears and so does his castle. Only a wide landscape remains.

==&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;==
In &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; a ship meets strong winds and sacrifices are made to various gods to obtain favorable weather, including to one called Utgarthilocus. With vows and propitiations to him a beneficial spell of weather is obtained. Later an expedition to the land of the giants comes upon this figure.

As a proof of their accomplishments, the men bring back a hair pulled from the giant&#x27;s beard, stinking so harshly that several men drop dead on smelling it.

Apart from the name of the giant there is little that reminds of Snorri&#x27;s Útgarða-Loki. The bound giant figure is more reminiscent of the bound Loki who likewise lies chained and tortured in a cave. Gabriel Turville-Petre notes that &quot;Utgardilocus appears to be Loki, expelled from Ásgarð into Útgarð&quot; and expresses an opinion that &quot;Snorri appears to be retelling a folktale, which has changed from the original myth in which Útgarðaloki must have been Loki himself&quot;.

==Popular culture==
The Danish animated film &quot;Valhalla&quot; (Peter Madsen and others, 1984) is based on the Útgarða-Loki story from the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. Útgarða-Loki serves as the villain and Elli is described as his mother.

In the Marvel Comics continuity, Utgard-Loki is an enemy of Thor. He had attempted to lead a cadre of Frost Giants against a weakened Asgard but was defeated by a small force of its defenders.

Utgarda-Loki also makes an appearance as the final boss in the video game &quot;Ragnarok Odyssey.&quot;

Skrymir also appears in the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; novel &quot;&quot;.

Utgard-Loki appears as a supporting character in Rick Riordan&#x27;s &quot;Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard&quot; series. He is stated to be king of the mountain giants and the most powerful sorcerer in Jotunheim.

In Thomas Hardy&#x27;s 1884 short story, &quot;Interlopers at the Knapp&quot;, a breeze &#x27;brought a snore from the wood as if Skrymir the Giant were sleeping there&#x27;. The short story appears in Hardy&#x27;s short story collection, &quot;Wessex Tales&quot;.

Saturn&#x27;s moon Skrymir is named after him.

<text>A &#x27; (also jotun; plural &#x27;; in the normalised scholarly spelling of Old Norse, &#x27; ; or, in Old English, &#x27;, plural &#x27;) is a type of being in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, they are often contrasted with gods (the Æsir and Vanir) and other non-human figures, such as dwarfs and elves, although the groupings are not always mutually exclusive. The entities included in &quot;jötunn&quot; are referred to by several other terms, including &#x27;, &#x27; (or ) and if male and &#x27; or  if female. The typically dwell across boundaries from the gods and humans in lands such as .

The are frequently attested throughout the Old Norse record, with also featuring in the Old English epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;. The usage of the terms is dynamic, with an overall trend that the beings become portrayed as less impressive and more negative as Christianity becomes more influential. Although the term &quot;giant&quot; is sometimes used to gloss the word &quot;&quot; and its apparent synonyms in some translations and academic texts, this is seen as problematic by some scholars as are not necessarily notably large.

The terms for the beings also have cognates in later folklore such as the English &quot;yotun&quot;, Danish and Finnish which can share some common features such as being turned to stone in the day and living on the periphery of society.

==Origin, appearance and terminology==
===Terms and etymology===
 and Old English developed from the Proto-Germanic masculine noun . Philologist Vladimir Orel says that semantic connections between with Proto-Germanic (&#x27;to eat&#x27;) makes a relation between the two words likely. The words are cognate with , an archaic word for a type of being. Old Norse and Old High German derive from the Proto-Germanic masculine noun . Orel observes that the Old Saxon adjective &#x27;enormous&#x27; is likely also connected. Old Norse , Old English , and Old High German &#x27;devil, evil spirit&#x27; derive from the Proto-Germanic masculine noun , itself derived from Proto-Germanic , which is etymologically connected to Sanskrit - &#x27;strong, powerful, rich&#x27;. Several terms are used specifically to refer to female entities that fall into this wider category, including (plural ), (plural ) and (plural ).

Terms for are also found in Old Norse compound words such as , (&quot;mountain-risi&quot;) and (&quot;rime-þurs&quot;, or &quot;frost-þurs&quot;).

The cognates and , and and have been equated by scholars such as J. R. R. Tolkien and Rudolf Simek, with the words being used to describe the being in either Old Norse or Old English respectively.

===Appearance, connotations and distinctions===
In the Eddas, are beings typically with similar power to the gods and may also be referred to by the negative terms and . The harmful nature of is also described in the Icelandic and Norwegian rune poems, where they are identified for causing strife to women. Descriptions of the appearance of are uncommon; however, the progenitor of the is described as having the form of a man. Some female are described as being beautiful, such as Gerðr and Hymir&#x27;s partner, while others are described as monstrous and having many heads. Some dwarfs are described as such as Regin and Fáfnir, while in Alvíssmál, the eponymous dwarf is noted for having the likeness of a .

As the influence of Christianity grew, became demonised and typically portrayed as less intelligent, easier to outwit and more monstrous, as is common with giants in later Germanic folklore. In some later sagas, such as Bárðar saga Snæfellsáss, are clearly distinct from however in others the terms are used interchangeably, albeit with an overall trend that have begun to be seen negatively relative to .

 has a much wider semantic scope in Old Norse literature than solely , also including individuals with unusual or supernatural traits such as witches, abnormally strong, large or ugly people, ghosts and berserkers.

===Glossing as &quot;giant&quot;===
Terms for are often translated into Modern English as &quot;giant&quot; or &quot;giantess&quot;. John Lindow uses the glosses to contrast them with the gods but notes that they are not giant, being similar in size to the gods, and are best conceived of as a kin or family group, separated by relation rather than physical appearance. Due to this issue, some scholars such as Terry Gunnell, Jeramy Dodds and Benjamin Thorpe either anglicise or leave untranslated terms for in translations and academic work.

==Notable ==

* Gerðr, a daughter of Gymir and wife of Freyr. Usually regarded as an earth-goddess.
* Grendel, an eoten who, along with his mother, ravages the hall of Heorot before being killed by Beowulf.
* Fárbauti, the jötunn father of Loki with Laufey.
* Fenja and Menja, sisters who turn the mill &quot;Grotti&quot; to produce gold and Fróði&#x27;s Peace.
* Hrungnir, a jötunn champion who challenged Thor to a duel.
* Jörð, possibly a jötunn at one period of time and the mother of Thor with Odin. According to Rudolf Simek, Jörð is &quot;[a]n Æsir goddess, even though she is also called a giantess&quot;; while John Lindow claims, &quot;Jörd must have been a giantess in the beginning.&quot;
* Skaði, a daughter of Þjazi and later wife of Njörðr. Goddess associated with skiing and claimed as a mythical ancestor of Haakon Sigurdsson.
* Þjazi, a jötunn who once kidnapped Iðunn and her apples of youth. He was later killed by the gods and his eyes made into stars.
* Ymir, the progenitor of the jötnar.

==Mythological origin==
In a stanza of &quot;Völuspá hin skamma&quot; (found in the poem &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;), all descend from Ymir. Gylfaginning elaborates on this, describing that the primordial Ymir formed in the warm waters that arose in Ginnungagap when the rime of Niflheim was melted by the heat of Muspelheim. He lay there asleep, fed by milk from Auðumbla, whereupon from his left armpit he sweated a male and a female, and his legs begat a son with one another. Together, these children became the ancestors of all other .

Later, he was killed by the first gods, resulting in a flood of Ymir&#x27;s blood, in which all drowned except Bergelmir and his family, who survive this event by way of sailing upon a . This has been linked to a runic inscription on a sword hilt in Beowulf which describes the being killed in an ancient flood and has been proposed to derive from Germanic and wider Indo-European mythology.

According to Gylfaginning, after Ymir was killed, his body was wrought into the world and a sea surrounded it. The gods then gave the surviving families lands along the shore to settle, placing them in the periphery. Ymir&#x27;s brows were then used to build Midgard and protect it from the due to their known aggression.

==Attributes and themes==
===Position as the &quot;Other&quot;===

Most stories in Old Norse mythology show a clear division between &quot;This World&quot;, pertaining to that of gods and men, and &quot;The Other&quot;, which is inhabited by and beings associated with them.

A common motif is the journeying to obtain secret knowledge from the . In the Eddic poem Hyndluljóð, Freyja travels to the to obtain understanding of the lineage of Ottar, and the &quot;ale of remembrance&quot; () so that he does not forget it. In the Eddic poem Vafþrúðnismál, Óðinn travels to the Vafþrúðnir whereupon they engage in a wisdom contest. He also travels to the to obtain from Suttungr the Mead of poetry, which imparts skill in poetry to any who drink it. The völva who tells the Völuspá prophecy to Óðinn, while not explicitly described as a but was raised by them. 
Cosmology in Germanic mythology, as with other oral cultures, has many apparent contradictions when viewed from a naturalistic standpoint. Despite this, a system of motifs repeat when travelling to the . 
In the Prose Edda that the dwell in Jötunheimr which is at points located in the North or East and in can only be reached by air, however are also found South and across water. such as Suttungr and Skaði live in mountains, which is further reflected in the terms (mountain risar) and (mountain dweller), a kenning for . Their lands of inhabitation are not restricted to this, also including forests, underground, and the shore. Sometimes they are referred to as living in specific geographical locations such as Ægir on Læsø. These motifs are also seen in the section of Beowulf concerning the fight with mother of the Grendel which has been noted by scholars to closely resemble the fight between a and Grettir in his eponymous saga, wherein the female beings may only be reached by crossing through water. The seemingly ununified location of the has been suggested to be an outcome of their intrinsically chaotic nature. Even within the same story, what seem like contradictions have been noted by scholars, prompting the proposal of a model that the otherworld where the dwell can be reached from a number of passages or boundaries that cannot be traversed under normal conditions, such as the mountains, darkness and &quot;flickering flame&quot; crossed by Skírnir in Skírnismál.

In Eddic sources, present a constant threat to gods and humans, often leading them to confrontation with Thor. Hárbarðsljóð and Þrymskviða tell that if it was not for Thor and Mjöllnir, would soon overrun Midgard and Asgard respectively. Nonetheless, Thor also has a positive relationship with some , such as Gríðr and the unnamed wife of Hymir, who provide magical items and council that enable him to overcome other .

===Ancestors of gods and humans===

The distinction between gods and is not clearly defined and they should be seen as different culturally rather than biologically, with some gods, such as Odin, Thor and Loki being the descendants of . A common motif that often forms the core storyline of Eddic narratives is the unsuccessful attempts of to marry one of the goddesses, be it through either trickery or force. In contrast, the female Skaði chooses the male Vanr Njörðr as a husband. According to the Ynglinga saga, she later had children with Odin, from whom kings such as Earl Hakon were descended. The Freyr also marries Gerðr, who are the claimed ancestors of the Ynglings.
Odin also seduces the Gunnlöð and Rindr and marries Jörð. In the cases when gods marry , they appear to be fully incorporated into the gods and are referred to as Ásynjur in Nafnaþulur. Consistent with this, reference to Skaði&#x27;s vés in Lokasenna and toponyms such as Skedevi in Sweden suggests that despite being a , she was worshipped in Old Norse religion.

===Association with wild animals===
One of the who dwell in the wood Járnviðr is a mother of &quot;jötnar&quot; in the forms of wolves and from whom are descended all wolves. This has been suggested to be Angrboða, the who begat with Loki the monstrous wolf Fenrir and venomous worm Jörmungandr who become enemies of the gods. Also in &quot;Járnviðr&quot; dwells the &quot;jötunn &quot; Eggþér who has been interpreted as either a guardian of the &quot;gýgjar&quot; who live there or a herdsman of the wolves. Wolves are also taken as mounts by such as Hyndla and Hyrrokkin, the latter of which using snakes as reins. This is further attested in skaldic poetry in which &quot;wolf&quot; is described by the kennings &quot;Leikn&#x27;s horse&quot;, &quot;Gjálp&#x27;s horse&quot;, &quot;Gríðr&#x27;s horse&quot;, while a group of wolves is referred to as &quot;Gríðr&#x27;s grey herd of horses&quot;. Wolf-riding are referred to as (&quot;riders in the night&quot;) or (&quot;dusk riders&quot;).

Hræsvelgr is told in Vafþrúðnismál (37) and Gylfaginning (18) to be a in an arnarhamr (eagle-guise) who creates the wind by beating his wings. Other , such as Þjazi and Suttungr are able to become eagles by wearing their , or resemble them like Griðr in Illuga saga Gríðarfóstra who has hands like eagle talons.

===Demonisation===
In later material composed during the Christian period such as the legendary sagas, are often portrayed as uncivilised and cannibalistic. In the case of &quot;Bárðar saga Snæfellsáss&quot; and Hálfdanar saga Brönufóstra they specifically eat both human and horse meat, the latter of which was directly associated with heathen practices. The post-Christian association between and pre-Christian practices is also seen in Beowulf, in which the man-eating Grendel is described as having a &quot;heathen soul&quot; and &quot;heathenish hand-spurs&quot;. Female are explicitly described as being heathen in some later sources such as &quot;Orms þáttr Stórólfssonar&quot;, in which religion prevents her from being with the hero, and the legendary saga Þorsteins þáttr bæjarmagns, in which she must be baptised before marrying the hero.

==Modern folklore==

Giants with names cognate to terms for are found in later Northern European folklore, such as the English &quot;ettin&quot; or &quot;yotun&quot;, &quot;thurse&quot; and &quot;hobthrust&quot;, Danish , Swedish and Finnish . In Germanic folklore, giants often share traits with , particularly as depicted in legendary sagas, combined with motifs from other European giants and are often interchangeable with trolls.

As with , Germanic giants live outside of human communities, in woods and mountains. They commonly show an aversion to Christianity, often showing a disdain for the ringing of church bells. Similarities are also both seen in their role in the construction of stoneworks. Akin to the Old Norse tale of the who built the wall of Ásgarðr, giants often enter into wagers involved in the building of churches which they later lose, as with the tale of Jätten Finn who is attributed with the construction of Lund Cathedral. Ruins are also attributed to the works of both beings, as in the Old English poem The Ruin and the aetiological story of Wade&#x27;s Causeway in Yorkshire.

Some standing stones in northern Europe are explained as petrified giants such as the Yetnasteen in Orkney which derives its name from (&quot;Jötunn&#x27;s&quot; stone). According to folklore, it awakens every New Year at midnight whereupon it visits the Loch of Scockness to drink. Orcadian folklore also explains the Ring of Brodgar as dancing giants who were turned to stone by the morning sun. This motif is also seen in Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar, in which the Hrímgerðr engages in a senna with Helgi Hundingsbane until the sun rises and she is turned to stone.

The Orcadian tradition of Gyro Night derives its name from and consisted of two older boys dressing up as masked old women one night in February and chasing smaller boys with ropes. Similar to this are the Faroese and Shetlandic popular customs of dressing up as giantesses referred to as (plural ), or other similar terms, in costumes traditionally made from a combination of animal skins, tattered clothes, seaweed, straw and sometimes featuring masks. Grýla is a female creature described in Sturlunga saga as having fifteen tails, and listed as a in the Nafnaþulur section of the Prose Edda who features in folklore throughout the North Atlantic islands settled by Scandinavians.

Extremely wise, Kvasir traveled far and wide, teaching and spreading knowledge. This continued until the dwarfs Fjalar and Galar killed Kvasir and drained him of his blood. The two mixed his blood with honey, thus creating the Mead of Poetry, a mead which imbued the drinker with skaldship and wisdom, and the spread of which eventually resulted in the introduction of poetry to mankind.

Kvasir is attested in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, both written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century, and in the poetry of skalds. According to the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Kvasir was instrumental in the capture and binding of Loki, and an euhemerized account of the god appears in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, where he is attested as the wisest among the Vanir.

Scholars have connected Kvasir to methods of beverage production and peacemaking practices among ancient peoples.

==Attestations==
In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Kvasir appears in the books &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;. Kvasir is mentioned a single time in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;; in chapter 50, where the enthroned figure of High tells Gangleri (Gylfi in disguise) of how Loki was caught by the gods after being responsible for the murder of the god Baldr. In the chapter, High says that while Loki was hiding from the gods, he often took the form of a salmon during the day and swam in the waterfall Franangrsfors. Loki considered what sort of device the gods might craft to catch him there, and so, sitting in his four-door mountain lookout house, knotted together linen thread in &quot;which ever since the net has been&quot;. Loki noticed that the gods were not far away from him and that Odin had spotted him from Hliðskjálf. Loki sat before a fire, and when he noticed the gods were coming near him, he threw the net into the fire and jumped up, and slipped into the river. The gods reached Loki&#x27;s house, and the first to enter was Kvasir, who the High describes as &quot;the wisest of all&quot;. Kvasir saw the shape of the net in the ash of the fire, and so realized its purpose; to catch fish. And so Kvasir told the gods about it. The gods used the shape found in the ash as their model, and with it fished Loki from the river to make him their prisoner, later binding him in torment until the coming of Ragnarök.

In &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Kvasir is mentioned several times. In chapter 57 of the book, Ægir asks the skaldic god Bragi where the craft of poetry originated. Bragi says that the Æsir once wrangled with the Vanir (see Æsir–Vanir War) but eventually came together to make peace. The two groups decided to form a truce by way of both sides spitting into a vat. After they left, the gods kept the vat as a symbol of their truce, &quot;and decided not to let it be wasted and out of it made a man&quot;. The man was named Kvasir, and he was extremely wise; he knew the answer to any question posed to him. Kvasir traveled far and wide throughout the world teaching mankind and spreading his vast knowledge. In time, two dwarfs, Fjalar and Galar, invited Kvasir to their home for a private talk. Upon Kvasir&#x27;s arrival, the two dwarfs killed him and drained his blood into three objects. Two of the objects were vats, called Són and Boðn, and the third was a pot called Óðrerir. Fjalar and Galar mixed the blood with honey and made mead of it. Whoever drank of it would become a poet or scholar (Kvasir&#x27;s blood had become the Mead of Poetry). The two dwarfs explained to the Æsir that Kvasir had died from &quot;suffocating in his own intelligence&quot;, as there were none among them who were so well educated as to be able to pose him questions. Bragi then tells how the Mead of Poetry, by way of the god Odin, ultimately came into the hands of mankind.

In chapter 2 &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, poetic ways of referring to poetry are provided, including &quot;Kvasir&#x27;s blood&quot;. In reference, part of &quot;Vellekla&quot; by the 10th century Icelandic skald Einarr skálaglamm is provided, where the term &quot;Kvasir&#x27;s blood&quot; for &#x27;poetry&#x27; is used. Further, in chapter 3, a prose narrative mentions that the Kvasir&#x27;s blood was made into the Mead of Poetry.

Kvasir is mentioned in an euhemerized account of the origin of the gods in chapter 4 of &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, contained within &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. The chapter narrative explains that Odin waged war on the Vanir, yet the Vanir could not be defeated, and so the two decided to exchange hostages in a peace agreement. Kvasir, here a member of the Vanir and described as the &quot;cleverest among them&quot;, is included among the hostages.

==Name==
The etymology of the name is uncertain. The root &quot;kvas-&quot; in &quot;Kvas-ir&quot; likely stems from the Proto-Germanic base *&quot;kvass&quot;-, meaning &quot;to squeeze, squash, crush, bruise&quot;. Regarding this etymology, linguist Albert Morey Sturtevant comments that &quot;fluids may result from the crushing or pressing of an object (cf. Dan. &quot;kvase&quot; &#x27;to crush something in order to squeeze out the juice&#x27;). Hence we are justified in assuming the stem syllable in &quot;kvas-ir&quot; has reference to the fluid (saliva) out of which he was created and that the name &quot;Kvas-ir&quot; denotes the person who possesses the characteristic qualities inherent in this fluid, viz., poetic inspiration and wisdom.&quot;

The same root &quot;kvas-&quot; may also be related to kvass, a fermented drink of the Slavic peoples. The common Slavic word stems from Proto-Slavic (&quot;leaven&quot;, &quot;fermented drink&quot;) and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European base . This etymological connection, as considered by some scholars (Alexander Afanasyev, Richard Heinzel, Jooseppi Julius Mikkola, Georges Dumézil, et al.), is motivated by the consideration of kvasir as a personification of fermented beverages.

==Interpretations==
Rudolf Simek comments that &quot;kvasir&quot; likely originally referred to juice squeezed from berries and then fermented. In some ancient cultures, berries were communally chewed before being spat into a container, which exactly parallels Kvasir&#x27;s mythical creation.

Simek says that Snorri&#x27;s description is further proven faithful by way of the (above-mentioned) 10th-century skaldic kenning &quot;Kvasir’s blood&quot; (Old Norse &quot;Kvasis dreyra&quot;). He also points out strong parallels exist between the Old Norse tale of the theft of the Mead of Poetry by Odin (in the form of an eagle) and the Sanskrit tale of the theft of Soma (beverage of the gods) by the god Indra (or an eagle), and that these parallels point to a common Proto-Indo-European basis.

Further, the mixing of spit in a vat between the two groups of gods points to an ancient basis for the myth: The customs of mixing spittle and the group drinking of the intoxicating beverage are well rooted in traditional peacemaking and group binding customs among various ancient peoples.

==Modern influence==
A Norwegian search engine, Kvasir, takes its name from the god.

<text>In Nordic mythology, Fjalar ( ) and his brother Galar ( ), were wicked dwarfs who killed Kvasir and turned his blood into the mead of poetry, which inspired poets. They appear in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;.

== Myth ==
Fjalar and Galar murdered a jötunn named Gilling, along with his wife. Their son, Suttungr, searched for his parents and threatened the dwarven brothers, who offered him the magical mead in exchange for sparing their lives. Suttungr took it and hid it in the center of a mountain, with his daughter, Gunnlöð, standing guard.

Odin eventually decided to obtain the mead. He worked for Baugi, Suttungr&#x27;s brother, for an entire summer, then asked for a small sip of the mead. Baugi drilled into the mountain, whereupon Odin changed into a snake and slithered inside. Inside, Gunnlöð was guarding the mead, but he seduced her and persuaded her to give him three sips; Odin proceeded to drink all the mead, change into an eagle and escape.

<text>Baugi (Old Norse: ; &quot;ring-shaped&quot;) is a jötunn in Norse mythology. He is brother of Suttungr, the giant from whom Odin obtained the mead of poetry.

== Name ==
The Old Norse name &quot;Baugi&quot; has been translated as &#x27;ring-shaped&#x27;.

== Attestations ==
The name of the jötunn Baugi is only mentioned in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (The Language of Poetry) and in the &quot;þulur&quot;, and is not attested in other poetic texts. It is notably absent from &quot;Hávamál&quot; (Words of the High One), which Snorri Sturluson used as a source for the story of the mead of poetry. Some scholars have argued that Baugi may have been an invention or a misunderstanding of &quot;Hávamál&quot; by Snorri.

=== Mead of poetry ===
In &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Odin causes Baugi&#x27;s nine slaves to kill each other in his quest to obtain the mead of poetry, possessed at that time by Baugi&#x27;s brother, Suttungr. Calling himself Bölverk (&#x27;Evil-deed&#x27; or &#x27;Evil worker&#x27;), Odin then offers to do the labour of all nine men for Baugi as a reparation for his wrongdoings, in exchange of a wage of one drink of the mead of poetry. Baugi accepts to help him acquire it from his brother.

After the summer of work is over, Bölverk (Odin) asks for his payment, but Suttungr refuses to give him a single drop of the mead. Bölverk then enlists Baugi&#x27;s help to dig a hole into the Hnitbjörg mountain with Baugi&#x27;s drill, Rati, in order to reach the chamber where the mead was kept and watched over by Gunnlöð, Suttung’s daughter. When Baugi announces to him that the tunnel is finished, Bölverk blows into the hole but realizes that the other end is still blocked. As he understands that Baugi is trying to deceive him, Bölverk turns himself into a snake and slips into the hole. Baugi tries to strike at him with his auger but misses.

<text>Gillingr (Old Norse: ; also Gilling) is a jötunn in Norse mythology, and the father of Suttungr. Gillingr and, later, his wife are murdered by the dwarfs Fjalar and Galar. In revenge, his son Suttungr tortures the dwarfs into giving him the mead of poetry. 

== Name ==
The Old Norse name &quot;Gillingr&quot; has been translated as &#x27;screamer&#x27;. It is a related to the Old Norse verb &quot;gjalla&quot; (&#x27;to scream, yell&#x27;; compare with Icelandic &quot;gjalla&quot;, Norwegian &quot;gjella&quot;, or Swedish &quot;gälla&quot;).

== Attestations ==

=== Prose Edda ===
In &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (The Language of Poetry), the dwarfs Fjalar and Galar kill Gillingr by overturning his boat. When his wife hears of the news, she is &quot;greatly distressed&quot; and &quot;weeps loudly&quot; and the dwarf Galar, &quot;weary of her howling&quot;, eventually kills her by dropping a millstone on her head.

=== Viking Age ===
Gillingr is mentioned in a skaldic verse by Eyvindr skáldaspillir (10th c. AD), who portrays the mead of poetry as &quot;Gilling’s compensation&quot;.
== Legacy ==
Gillingr is also a surname, although not very common.

<text>The Lion King is a 1994 American animated musical coming-of-age drama film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. Directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, and produced by Don Hahn, the film&#x27;s screenplay was written by Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, and Linda Woolverton. Featuring an ensemble voice cast consisting of Matthew Broderick, James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Moira Kelly, Niketa Calame, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, Rowan Atkinson, and Robert Guillaume, &quot;The Lion King&quot; follows a young lion, Simba, who flees his kingdom when his father, King Mufasa, is murdered by his paternal uncle, Scar. After growing up in exile, Simba returns home to confront his evil uncle and reclaim his throne.

&quot;The Lion King&quot; was conceived during conversations among various Disney executives, to whom several writers submitted early treatments. Original director George Scribner had envisioned &quot;The Lion King&quot; as a nature documentary-style film, with Allers joining as co-director after having worked in the story departments of several successful animated Disney films. Considered to be Disney&#x27;s first original animated film, &quot;The Lion King&quot;&#x27;s plot draws inspiration from several sources, notably William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Woolverton, screenwriter for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991), drafted early versions of &quot;The Lion King&quot;&#x27;s script, which Mecchi and Roberts were hired to revise once Woolverton left to prioritize other projects. Scribner departed due to disagreements over the studio&#x27;s decision to reimagine the film as a musical, with original songs by Elton John and Tim Rice, and Minkoff was hired to replace him in April 1992. Throughout production, the creative team visited Kenya for research and inspiration.

Released on June 15, 1994, &quot;The Lion King&quot; was praised by critics for its music, story, themes, and animation. With an initial worldwide gross of $763 million, it completed its theatrical run as the highest-grossing film of 1994 and the second-highest-grossing film of all time, behind &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993). It held the title of highest-grossing animated film until it was replaced by &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; in 2003. The film remains the highest-grossing traditionally animated film of all time, as well as the best-selling film on home video, having sold over copies worldwide. It won two Academy Awards, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. It is considered by many to be among the greatest animated films ever made.

The success of the film launched a multibillion-dollar franchise comprising a Broadway adaptation, two direct-to-video sequels, television series, and a photorealistic remake (which itself spawned a ), which in 2019 also became the highest-grossing animated film at the time of its release. In 2016, &quot;The Lion King&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

In the Pride Lands of Tanzania, a pride of lions rule over the kingdom from Pride Rock. King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi&#x27;s newborn son, Simba, is presented to the gathering animals by Rafiki the mandrill, the kingdom&#x27;s shaman and advisor. Mufasa&#x27;s younger brother, Scar, covets the throne.

Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands and forbids him from exploring beyond its borders. He explains to Simba the responsibilities of kingship and the &quot;circle of life&quot;, which connects all living things. Scar manipulates Simba into exploring an elephant graveyard beyond the Pride Lands. There, Simba and his best friend, Nala, are chased by three spotted hyenas named Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. Mufasa is alerted by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though disappointed with Simba for disobeying him and endangering himself and Nala, Mufasa forgives him. He explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba. Scar visits the hyenas and convinces them to help him kill Mufasa and Simba in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands.

Scar sets a trap for Simba and Mufasa. He lures Simba into a gorge and signals the hyenas to drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede to trample him. Scar alerts Mufasa, who saves Simba and tries to escape the gorge; he begs for Scar&#x27;s help, but Scar betrays Mufasa by throwing him into the stampede to his death. Scar then deceives Simba into believing that Mufasa&#x27;s death was his fault and tells him to leave the kingdom and never return. He then orders the hyenas to kill Simba, who escapes. Unaware of Simba&#x27;s survival, Scar tells the pride that the stampede killed both Mufasa and Simba, and steps forward as the new king, allowing the hyenas into the Pride Lands.

Simba collapses in a desert but is rescued by two outcasts, a meerkat and a warthog named Timon and Pumbaa. Simba grows up with his two new friends in their oasis, living a carefree life under their motto &quot;hakuna matata&quot; (&quot;no worries&quot; in Swahili). Years later, an adult Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who is revealed to be Nala. Simba and Nala fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him that the Pride Lands have become drought-stricken under Scar&#x27;s reign. Still feeling guilty over Mufasa&#x27;s death, Simba refuses and leaves angrily. He encounters Rafiki, who tells Simba that Mufasa&#x27;s spirit lives on in him. Simba is visited by the spirit of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his place as king. After Rafiki advises him to learn from the past instead of running from it, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.

Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who shames Simba over his supposed role in Mufasa&#x27;s death. Scar then reveals to Simba that he killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba retaliates and forces Scar to confess the truth to the pride. A battle ensues between Simba and his allies and the hyenas. Scar attempts to escape, but is cornered by Simba at a ledge near the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to deceive Simba by blaming his actions on the hyenas. Simba spares Scar&#x27;s life but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever; Scar refuses and attacks Simba. Following a brief battle, Simba throws Scar off the ledge. Scar survives the fall, but the hyenas, who overheard him betraying them, attack and maul him to death.

With Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba takes his place as king, and Nala becomes his queen. With the Pride Lands restored, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala&#x27;s newborn cub to the assembled animals, thus continuing the circle of life.

==Production==
===Development===
The origin of the concept for &quot;The Lion King&quot; is widely disputed. According to Charlie Fink (then-Walt Disney Feature Animation&#x27;s vice president for creative affairs), he approached Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney, and Peter Schneider with a &quot;&quot;Bambi&quot; in Africa&quot; idea with lions. Katzenberg balked at the idea at first, but nevertheless encouraged Fink and his writers to develop a mythos to explain how lions serviced other animals by eating them. Another anecdote states that the idea was conceived during a conversation between Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney, and Schneider on a flight to Europe during a promotional tour. During the conversation, the topic of a story set in Africa came up, and Katzenberg immediately jumped at the idea. Katzenberg decided to add elements involving coming of age and death, and ideas from personal life experiences, such as some of his trials in his career in politics, saying about the film, &quot;It is a little bit about myself.&quot;

On October 11, 1988, Thomas Disch (the author of &quot;The Brave Little Toaster&quot;) had met with Fink and Roy E. Disney to discuss the idea, and within the next month, he had written a nine-paged treatment entitled &quot;King of the Kalahari&quot;. Throughout 1989, several Disney staff writers, including Jenny Tripp, Tim Disney, Valerie West and Miguel Tejada-Flores, had written treatments for the project. Tripp&#x27;s treatment, dated on March 2, 1989, introduced the name &quot;Simba&quot; for the main character, who gets separated from his pride and is adopted by Kwashi, a baboon, and Mabu, a mongoose. He is later raised in a community of baboons. Simba battles an evil jackal named Ndogo, and reunites with his pride. Later that same year, Fink recruited his friend J. T. Allen, a writer, to develop new story treatments. Fink and Allen had earlier made several trips to a Los Angeles zoo to observe the animal behavior that was to be featured in the script. Allen completed his script, which was titled &quot;The Lion King&quot;, on January 19, 1990. However, Fink, Katzenberg, and Roy E. Disney felt Allen&#x27;s script could benefit from a more experienced screenwriter, and turned to Ronald Bass, who had recently won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for &quot;Rain Man&quot; (1988). At the time, Bass was preoccupied to rewrite the script himself, but agreed to supervise the revisions. The new script, credited to both Allen and Bass, was retitled &quot;King of the Beasts&quot; and completed on May 23, 1990.

Sometime later, Linda Woolverton, who was also writing &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991), spent a year writing several drafts of the script, which was titled &quot;King of the Beasts&quot; and then &quot;King of the Jungle&quot;. The original version of the film was vastly different from the final product. The plot centered on a battle between lions and baboons, with Scar being the leader of the baboons, Rafiki being a cheetah, and Timon and Pumbaa being Simba&#x27;s childhood friends. Simba would not only leave the kingdom but become a &quot;lazy, slovenly, horrible character&quot; due to manipulations from Scar, so Simba could be overthrown after coming of age. By 1990, producer Thomas Schumacher, who had just completed &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; (1990), decided to attach himself to the project &quot;because lions are cool&quot;. Schumacher likened the &quot;King of the Jungle&quot; script to &quot;an animated &quot;National Geographic&quot; special&quot;.

George Scribner, who had directed &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; (1988), was the initial director of the film, being later joined by Roger Allers, who was the lead story man on &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991). Allers worked with Scribner and Woolverton on the project, but temporarily left the project to help rewrite &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992). Eight months later, Allers returned to the project, and brought Brenda Chapman and Chris Sanders with him. In October 1991, several of the lead crew members, including Allers, Scribner, Chapman, Sanders, and Lisa Keene visited Hell&#x27;s Gate National Park in Kenya, in order to study and gain an appreciation of the environment for the film. After six months of story development work, Scribner decided to leave the project upon clashing with Allers and the producers over their decision to turn the film into a musical, since Scribner&#x27;s intention was of making a documentary-like film more focused on natural aspects. By April 1992, Rob Minkoff had replaced Scribner as the new co-director.

Don Hahn joined the production as the film&#x27;s producer because Schumacher was promoted to Vice President of Development for Walt Disney Feature Animation. Hahn found the script unfocused and lacking a clear theme, and after establishing the main theme as &quot;leaving childhood and facing up to the realities of the world&quot;, asked for a final retool. Allers, Minkoff, Chapman, and Hahn then rewrote the story across two weeks of meetings with directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale, who had finished directing &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991). One of the definite ideas that stemmed from the meetings was to have Mufasa return as a ghost. Allers also changed the character Rafiki from a more serious court advisor into a wacky shaman. The title was also changed from &quot;King of the Jungle&quot; to &quot;The Lion King&quot;, as the setting was not the jungle but the savannah. It was also decided to make Mufasa and Scar brothers, as the writers felt it was much more interesting if the threat came from someone within the family. Allers and Minkoff pitched the revised story to Katzenberg and Michael Eisner, to which Eisner felt the story &quot;could be more Shakespearean&quot;; he suggested modeling the story on &quot;King Lear&quot;. Maureen Donley, an associate producer, countered, stating that the story resembled &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Continuing on the idea, Allers recalled Katzenberg asking them to &quot;put in as much &quot;Hamlet&quot; as you can&quot;. However, they felt it was too forced, and looked to other heroic archetypes such as the stories of Joseph and Moses from the Bible.

Not counting most of the segments from &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940), &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; (1942), &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; (1944), &quot;Make Mine Music&quot; (1946), and &quot;Melody Time&quot; (1948); and &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; (1990) (a sequel to &quot;The Rescuers&quot; (1977)), &quot;The Lion King&quot; was the first Disney animated feature to be an original story, rather than be based on pre-existing works and characters. The filmmakers have stated that the story of &quot;The Lion King&quot; was inspired by the lives of Joseph and Moses from the Bible, and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, though the story has also drawn some comparisons to Shakespeare&#x27;s lesser known plays &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot;.

By this point, Woolverton had left the production to work on the Broadway adaptation of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. To replace her, Allers and Minkoff met with numerous screenwriters, including Billy Bob Thornton and Joss Whedon, to discuss writing the new screenplay. During the summer of 1992, Irene Mecchi was hired as the new screenwriter, and months later, she was joined by Jonathan Roberts. Mecchi and Roberts took charge of the revision process, fixing unresolved emotional issues in the script and adding comedic situations for Pumbaa, Timon, and the hyenas.

Lyricist Tim Rice worked closely with the screenwriting team, flying to California at least once a month, as his songs for the film needed to work in the narrative continuity. Rice&#x27;s lyrics—which were reworked up to the production&#x27;s end—were pinned to the storyboards during development. Rewrites were frequent, with animator Andreas Deja saying that completed scenes would be delivered, only for the response to be that parts needed to be reanimated because of dialogue changes. Due to the rewrites, &quot;The Lion King&quot; missed its initial release window for Thanksgiving 1993, with &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; (1993) assuming its release slot. Hahn stated the film was delayed to a summer 1994 release, &quot;with much consternation, because people said you can&#x27;t release animation in the summertime.&quot;

===Casting===
The voice actors were chosen for how they fit and could add to the characters; for instance, James Earl Jones was cast because the directors found his voice &quot;powerful&quot; and similar to a lion&#x27;s roar. Jones remarked that during the years of production, Mufasa &quot;became more and more of a dopey dad instead of [a] grand king&quot;.

Nathan Lane auditioned for Zazu, and Ernie Sabella for one of the hyenas. Upon meeting at the recording studio, Lane and Sabellawho were starring together in a Broadway production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; at the timewere asked to record together as hyenas. The directors laughed at their performance and decided to instead cast them as Timon and Pumbaa. For the hyenas, the original intention was to reunite Cheech &amp; Chong, but while Cheech Marin agreed to voice Banzai, Tommy Chong was unavailable. His role was changed into a female hyena, Shenzi, voiced by Whoopi Goldberg, who insisted on being in the film. The English double act Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer auditioned for roles as a pair of chipmunks; according to Mortimer, the producers were enthusiastic, but he and Reeves were uncomfortable with their corporate attitude and abandoned the film. Rowan Atkinson was initially uninterested in the studio&#x27;s offer to voice Zazu, later explaining that &quot;voice work is something I generally had never done and never liked [...] I&#x27;m a visual artist, if I&#x27;m anything, and it seemed to be a pointless thing to do&quot;. His friend and fellow &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; writer/actor Robin Driscoll convinced him to accept the role, and Atkinson retrospectively expressed that &quot;The Lion King&quot; became &quot;a really, very special film&quot;.

Matthew Broderick was cast as adult Simba early during production. Broderick only recorded with another actor once over the three years he worked on the film, and only learned that Moira Kelly voiced Nala at the film&#x27;s premiere. English actors Tim Curry, Malcolm McDowell, Alan Rickman, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen were considered for the role of Scar, which eventually went to fellow Englishman Jeremy Irons. Irons initially turned down the part, as he felt uncomfortable going to a comedic role after his dramatic portrayal of Claus von Bülow in &quot;Reversal of Fortune&quot; (1990). His performance in that film inspired the writers to incorporate more of his acting as von Bülow in the scriptadding one of that character&#x27;s lines, &quot;You have no idea&quot;and prompted animator Andreas Deja to watch &quot;Reversal of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Damage&quot; (1992) in order to incorporate Irons&#x27; facial traits and tics.

===Animation===

The development of &quot;The Lion King&quot; coincided with that of &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995), which most of the animators of Walt Disney Feature Animation decided to work on instead, believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two. The story artists also did not have much faith in the project, with Chapman declaring she was reluctant to accept the job &quot;because the story wasn&#x27;t very good&quot;, and Burny Mattinson telling his colleague Joe Ranft: &quot;I don&#x27;t know who is going to want to watch that one.&quot; Most of the leading animators either were doing their first major work supervising a character, or had much interest in animating an animal. Thirteen of these supervising animators, both in California and in Florida, were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the film&#x27;s main characters. The animation leads for the main characters included Mark Henn on young Simba, Ruben A. Aquino on adult Simba, Andreas Deja on Scar, Aaron Blaise on young Nala, Anthony DeRosa on adult Nala, and Tony Fucile on Mufasa. Nearly twenty minutes of the film, including the &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Wait to Be King&quot; sequence, was animated at the Disney-MGM Studios facility. More than 600 artists, animators, and technicians contributed to &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Weeks before the film&#x27;s release, the 1994 Northridge earthquake shut down the studio and required the animators to complete via remote work.

The character animators studied real-life animals for reference, as was done for &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942). Jim Fowler, renowned wildlife expert, visited the studios on several occasions with an assortment of lions and other savannah inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings authenticity. The animators also studied animal movements at the Miami MetroZoo under guidance from wildlife expert Ron Magill. The Pride Lands are modeled on the Kenyan national park visited by the crew. Varied focal lengths and lenses were employed to differ from the habitual portrayal of Africa in documentaries—which employ telephoto lenses to shoot the wildlife from a distance. The epic feel drew inspiration from concept studies by artist Hans Bacher—who, following Scribner&#x27;s request for realism, tried to depict effects such as lens flare—and the works of painters Charles Marion Russell, Frederic Remington, and Maxfield Parrish. Art director Andy Gaskill and the filmmakers sought to give the film a sense of grand sweep and epic scale similar to &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962). Gaskill explained: &quot;We wanted audiences to sense the vastness of the savannah and to feel the dust and the breeze swaying through the grass. In other words, to get a real sense of nature and to feel as if they were there. It&#x27;s very difficult to capture something as subtle as a sunrise or rain falling on a pond, but those are the kinds of images that we tried to get.&quot; The filmmakers also watched the films of John Ford and other filmmakers, which also influenced the design of the film.

Because the characters were not anthropomorphized, all the animators had to learn to draw four-legged animals, and the story and character development was done through the use of longer shots following the characters.

Computers helped the filmmakers present their vision in new ways. For the wildebeest stampede sequence, several distinct wildebeest characters were created in a 3D computer program, multiplied into hundreds, cel shaded to look like drawn animation, and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real, unpredictable movement of a herd. Five specially trained animators and technicians spent more than two years creating the two-and-a-half-minute stampede. The Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) helped simulate camera movements such as tracking shots, and was employed in coloring, lighting, and particle effects.

==Music==
Lyricist Tim Rice, who was working with composer Alan Menken on songs for &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992), was invited to write songs for &quot;The Lion King&quot;, and accepted on the condition of bringing in a composing partner. As Menken was unavailable, the producers accepted Rice&#x27;s suggestion of Elton John, after Rice&#x27;s invitation of ABBA fell through due to Benny Andersson&#x27;s commitments to the stage musical &quot;Kristina från Duvemåla&quot;. John expressed an interest in writing &quot;ultra-pop songs that kids would like; then adults can go and see those movies and get just as much pleasure out of them&quot;, mentioning a possible influence of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967), where he felt the &quot;music was so funny and appealed to kids and adults&quot;.

Rice and John wrote five original songs for &quot;The Lion King&quot; (&quot;Circle of Life&quot;, &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Wait to Be King&quot;, &quot;Be Prepared&quot;, &quot;Hakuna Matata&quot;, and &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight&quot;), with John&#x27;s performance of &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight&quot; playing over the end credits. The IMAX and DVD releases added another song, &quot;The Morning Report&quot;, based on a song discarded during development that eventually featured in the live musical version of &quot;The Lion King&quot;. The score was composed by Hans Zimmer, who was hired based on his earlier work on two films in African settings, &quot;A World Apart&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Power of One&quot; (1992), and supplemented the score with traditional native African music and choir elements arranged by Lebo M. Zimmer&#x27;s partners Mark Mancina and Jay Rifkin helped with arrangements and song production.

Jason Weaver recorded his song vocals as young Simba for &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Wait to be King,&quot; &quot;Hakuna Matata,&quot; and an unused song, &#x27;Warthog Rhapsody,&quot; the day he came in for what was supposed to be an audition. His mother turned down Disney&#x27;s initial financial offer and negotiated a fee of $100,000 plus royalties.

The &quot;Lion King&quot; original motion picture soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on April 27, 1994. It was the fourth-best-selling album of the year on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the top-selling soundtrack. It is the only soundtrack to an animated film to be certified Diamond (10× platinum) by the Recording Industry Association of America. Zimmer&#x27;s complete instrumental score for the film was never originally given a full release, until the soundtrack&#x27;s commemorative twentieth anniversary re-release in 2014. &quot;The Lion King&quot; also inspired the 1995 release &quot;Rhythm of the Pride Lands&quot;, with eight songs by Zimmer, Mancina, and Lebo M.

The use of the song &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; in a scene with Timon and Pumbaa led to disputes between Disney and the family of South African Solomon Linda, who composed the song (originally titled &quot;Mbube&quot;) in 1939. In July 2004, Linda&#x27;s family filed a lawsuit, seeking $1.6 million in royalties from Disney. In February 2006, Linda&#x27;s heirs reached a settlement with Abilene Music, who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney for an undisclosed amount of money.

==Marketing==
For &quot;The Lion King&quot;″s first film trailer, Disney opted to feature a single scene, the entire opening sequence with the song &quot;Circle of Life&quot;. Buena Vista Pictures Distribution president Dick Cook said the decision was made for such an approach because &quot;we were all so taken by the beauty and majesty of this piece that we felt like it was probably one of the best four minutes of film that we&#x27;ve seen&quot;, and Don Hahn added that &quot;Circle of Life&quot; worked as a trailer as it &quot;came off so strong, and so good, and ended with such a bang&quot;. The trailer was released in November 1993, accompanying &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1993) and &quot;Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit&quot; (1993) in theaters; by then, only a third of &quot;The Lion King&quot; had been completed. Audience reaction was enthusiastic, causing Hahn to have some initial concerns as he became afraid of not living up to the expectations raised by the preview. Prior to the film&#x27;s release, Disney did 11 test screenings.

Upon release, &quot;The Lion King&quot; was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign which included tie-ins with Burger King, Mattel, Kodak, Nestlé, and Payless ShoeSource, and various merchandise, accounting 186 licensed products. In 1994, Disney earned approximately $1 billion with products based on the film, with $214 million for &quot;Lion King&quot; toys during Christmas 1994 alone.

In a 2024 retrospective, the &quot;New York Times&quot; noted that the marketing and promotion of the film heavily focused on Jonathan Taylor Thomas&#x27; role in the film, with a lot less emphasis on Jason Weaver&#x27;s role as young Simba&#x27;s singing voice.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;The Lion King&quot; had a limited release in the United States on June 15, 1994, playing in only two theaters, El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles and Radio City Music Hall in New York City, and featuring live shows with ticket prices up to $30.

The wide release in the United States and Canada followed on June 24, 1994, in 2,550 screens. The digital surround sound of the film led many of those theaters to implement Dolby Laboratories&#x27; newest sound systems. The film also started its international release on June 24, opening in Latin America, South Africa and Israel.

===Localization===
When first released in 1994, &quot;The Lion King&quot; numbered 28 versions overall in as many languages and dialects worldwide, including a special Zulu version made specifically for the film in South Africa, where a Disney USA team went to find the Zulu voice-actors. This was the first Zulu dubbing made by Disney, and also the only one made in any African language other than Arabic. The Zulu language version was released in South Africa on June 24, 1994.

Following the success of the 2017 Māori dub of &quot;Moana&quot;, a Māori version of &quot;The Lion King&quot; was announced in 2021, and released theatrically on June 23, 2022, to align with the Māori holiday of Matariki. Much of the Matewa Media production team, including producer Chelsea Winstanley, director Tweedie Waititi, and co-musical director Rob Ruha had previously worked on the Māori language version of &quot;Moana&quot;. &quot;The Lion King Reo Māori&quot; is the first time a language adaptation has translated Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight&quot; for the ending credits.

===Re-releases===

====IMAX and large-format====
The film was re-issued on December 25, 2002, for IMAX and large-format theaters. Don Hahn explained that eight years after &quot;The Lion King&quot; had its original release, &quot;there was a whole new generation of kids who haven&#x27;t really seen it, particularly on the big screen.&quot; Given the film had already been digitally archived during production, the restoration process was easier, while also providing many scenes with enhancements that covered up original deficiencies. An enhanced sound mix was also provided to, as Hahn explained, &quot;make the audience feel like they&#x27;re in the middle of the movie.&quot; On its first weekend, &quot;The Lion King&quot; made $2.7 million from 66 locations, a $27,664 per theater average. This run ended with $15.7 million on May 30, 2003.

====3D conversion====
In 2011, &quot;The Lion King&quot; was converted to 3D for a two-week limited theatrical re-issue and subsequent 3D Blu-ray release. The film opened at the number one spot on Friday, September 16, 2011, with $8.9 million and finished the weekend with $30.2 million, ranking number one at the box office. This made &quot;The Lion King&quot; the first re-issue release to earn the number-one slot at the American weekend box office since the re-issue of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) in March 1997. The film also achieved the fourth-highest September opening weekend of all time. It held off very well on its second weekend, again earning first place at the box office with a 27 percent decline to $21.9 million. Most box-office observers had expected the film to fall about 50 percent in its second weekend and were also expecting &quot;Moneyball&quot; (2011) to be at first place.

After its initial box-office success, many theaters decided to continue to show the film for more than two weeks, even though its 3D Blu-ray release was scheduled for two and a half weeks after its theatrical release. In North America, the 3D re-release ended its run in theaters on January 12, 2012, with a gross of $94.2 million. Outside North America, it earned $83.4 million. The successful 3D re-release of &quot;The Lion King&quot; made Disney and Pixar plan 3D theatrical re-releases of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003), &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; (2001), and &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989) during 2012 and 2013. However, none of the re-releases of the first three films achieved the enormous success of &quot;The Lion King 3D&quot; and the theatrical re-release of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was ultimately cancelled. In 2012, Ray Subers of Box Office Mojo wrote that the reason why the 3D version of &quot;The Lion King&quot; succeeded was because, &quot;the notion of a 3D re-release was still fresh and exciting, and &quot;The Lion King (3D)&quot; felt timely given the movie&#x27;s imminent Blu-ray release. Audiences have been hit with three 3D re-releases in the year since, meaning the novelty value has definitely worn off.&quot;

====Disney100====
As part of Disney&#x27;s 100th anniversary, &quot;The Lion King&quot; was re-released between September 29 to October 12, 2023, in selected Cinemark theaters across the United States as well as Helios theaters across Poland on October 8.

====30th anniversary====
In conjunction with the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary, &quot;The Lion King&quot; was re-released on July 12, 2024. During its opening weekend, the film earned an estimated $1.08 million in the United States from 1,330 theaters.

===Home media===
&quot;The Lion King&quot; was first released on VHS and LaserDisc in the United States on March 3, 1995, under Disney&#x27;s &quot;Masterpiece Collection&quot; video series. The VHS edition of this release contained a special preview for Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; then-upcoming animated feature film &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995), in which the title character (voiced by Judy Kuhn) sings the musical number &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot;. In addition, Deluxe Editions of both formats were released. The VHS Deluxe Edition included the film, an exclusive lithograph of Rafiki and Simba (in some editions), a commemorative &quot;Circle of Life&quot; epigraph, six concept art lithographs, another tape with the half-hour TV special &quot;The Making of The Lion King&quot;, and a certificate of authenticity. The CAV laserdisc Deluxe Edition also contained the film, six concept art lithographs and &quot;The Making of The Lion King&quot;, and added storyboards, character design artwork, concept art, rough animation, and a directors&#x27; commentary that the VHS edition did not have, on a total of four double sided discs. The VHS tape quickly became the best-selling videotape of all time: 4.5 million tapes were sold on the first day and ultimately sales totaled more than 30 million before these home video versions went into moratorium in 1997. The VHS releases have sold a total of 32million units in North America, and grossed in sales revenue. In addition, 23million units were shipped overseas to international markets. In the Philippines, the film was released on VHS in March 1995 by Magnavision. The film sold more than video copies worldwide by August 1997, making it the best-selling home video title of all time.

On October 7, 2003, the film was re-released on VHS and released on DVD for the first time, titled &quot;The Lion King: Platinum Edition&quot;, as part of Disney&#x27;s Platinum Edition line of DVDs. The DVD release featured two versions of the film on the first disc, a remastered version created for the 2002 IMAX release and an edited version of the IMAX release purporting to be the original 1994 theatrical version. A second disc, with bonus features, was also included in the DVD release. The film&#x27;s soundtrack was provided both in its original Dolby 5.1 track and in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix, making this one of the first Disney DVDs so equipped. This THX certified two-disc DVD release also contains several games, &quot;Timon and Pumbaa&#x27;s Virtual Safari&quot;, deleted scenes, music videos and other bonus features. By means of seamless branching, the film could be viewed either with or without a newly created scene – a short conversation in the film replaced with a complete song (&quot;The Morning Report&quot;). A Special Collector&#x27;s Gift Set was also released, containing the DVD set, five exclusive lithographed character portraits (new sketches created and signed by the original character animators), and an introductory book entitled &quot;The Journey&quot;. The Platinum Edition of &quot;The Lion King&quot; featured changes made to the film during its IMAX re-release, including re-drawn crocodiles in the &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Wait to Be King&quot; sequence as well as other alterations. More than two million copies of the Platinum Edition DVD and VHS units were sold on the first day of release. A DVD box set of the three &quot;The Lion King&quot; films (in two-disc Special Edition formats) was released on December 6, 2004. In January 2005, the film, along with the sequels, went back into moratorium. The DVD releases have sold a total of 11.9million units and grossed .

Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the Diamond Edition of &quot;The Lion King&quot; on October 4, 2011. This marks the first time that the film has been released in high-definition Blu-ray and on Blu-ray 3D. The initial release was produced in three different packages: a two-disc version with Blu-ray and DVD; a four-disc version with Blu-ray, DVD, Blu-ray 3D, and digital copy; and an eight-disc box set that also includes the sequels &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot; and &quot;The Lion King 1½&quot;. A standalone single-disc DVD release also followed on November 15, 2011. The Diamond Edition topped the Blu-ray charts with over 1.5 million copies sold. The film sold 3.83 million Blu-ray units in total, leading to a $101.14 million income.

&quot;The Lion King&quot; was once again released to home media as part of the &quot;Walt Disney Signature Collection&quot; first released on Digital HD on August 15, 2017, and on Blu-ray and DVD on August 29, 2017.

&quot;The Lion King&quot; was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray and 4K digital download on December 3, 2018.

==Reception==
===Box office===
, &quot;The Lion King&quot; grossed $425 million in North America and $553.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $979 million. After its initial run, having earned $763.5 million, it ranked as the highest-grossing animated film of all time, the highest-grossing film of Walt Disney Animation Studios, and the highest-grossing film of 1994. It was the second-highest-grossing film of all time, behind &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993). The film remained as the second-highest-grossing film until the spot was taken by &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996) two years later. It finished as the 5th highest grossing film of the 1990s domestically.

It held the record for the highest-grossing animated feature film (in North America, outside North America, and worldwide) until it was surpassed by &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003). With the earnings of the 3D run, &quot;The Lion King&quot; surpassed all the aforementioned films but &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010) to rank as the second-highest-grossing animated film worldwide—later dropping to ninth, and then tenth, surpassed by its photorealistic CGI remake counterpart—and it remains the highest-grossing hand-drawn animated film. It is also the biggest animated movie of the last 50 years in terms of estimated attendance. &quot;The Lion King&quot; was also the highest-grossing G-rated film in the United States from 1994 to 2003 and again from 2011 to 2019 until its total was surpassed by &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; (2019) (unadjusted for inflation).

====Original theatrical run====
During the first two days of limited release in two theaters, &quot;The Lion King&quot; grossed $622,277, and for the weekend it earned nearly $1.6 million, placing the film in tenth place at the box office. The average of $793,377 per theater stands as the largest ever achieved during a weekend, and it was the highest-grossing opening weekend on under 50 screens, beating the record set by &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) from 43 screens. The film grossed nearly $3.8 million from the two theaters in just 10 days.

When it opened wide, &quot;The Lion King&quot; grossed $40.9 million—which at the time was the fourth biggest opening weekend ever and the highest sum for a Disney film—to top the weekend box office. It displaced the previous box office champion &quot;Wolf&quot;, while also topping &quot;Speed&quot; and &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;. At that time, it easily outgrossed the previous biggest 1994 opening, which was the $37.2 million earned by &quot;The Flintstones&quot; during the four-day Memorial Day weekend. The film also produced the third-highest opening weekend gross of any film, trailing only behind &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993) and &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992). For five years, the film held the record for having the highest opening weekend for an animated film until it was surpassed by &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999). For its second weekend, &quot;The Lion King&quot; collected a total of $34.2 million, outgrossing the openings of &quot;The Shadow&quot;, &quot;Blown Away&quot; and &quot;I Love Trouble&quot;. It remained the number-one box office film for a total of two weeks until it was displaced by &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, followed by &quot;True Lies&quot; the week after.

In September 1994, Disney pulled the film from movie theaters and announced that it would be re-released during Thanksgiving in order to take advantage of the holiday season. At the time, the film had earned $267 million in the United States. Upon its re-release in November 1994, it earned $5.5 million during its first weekend, ranking in fourth place behind &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;, &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; and &quot;The Santa Clause&quot;. Following its re-release, by March 1995, it had grossed $312.9 million, being the highest-grossing 1994 film in the United States and Canada, but was soon surpassed by &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 74 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run, equivalent to $812.1 million adjusted for inflation in 2018.

Internationally, the film grossed $455.8 million during its initial run, for a worldwide total of $763.5 million. It had record openings in Sweden and Denmark.

===Critical response ===
&quot;The Lion King&quot; was widely praised by film critics upon release. On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Lion King&quot; has an approval rating of with an average score of , based on reviews. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Emotionally stirring, richly drawn, and beautifully animated, &quot;The Lion King&quot; stands tall within Disney&#x27;s pantheon of classic family films.&quot; It also ranked 56th on Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; &quot;Top 100 Animation Movies&quot;. At Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the film received a score of 88 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three and a half stars out of a possible four and called it &quot;a superbly drawn animated feature&quot;. He further wrote in his print review, &quot;The saga of Simba, which in its deeply buried origins owes something to Greek tragedy and certainly to &quot;Hamlet&quot;, is a learning experience as well as an entertainment.&quot; On the television program &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;, the film was praised but received a mixed reaction when compared to the previous Disney films. Ebert and his partner Gene Siskel both gave the film a &quot;Thumbs Up&quot;, but Siskel said that it was not as good as &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and that it was &quot;a good film, not a great one&quot;. Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;an impressive, almost daunting achievement&quot; and felt that the film was &quot;spectacular in a manner that has nearly become commonplace with Disney&#x27;s feature-length animations&quot;. However, he was less enthusiastic toward the end of his review saying, &quot;Shakespearean in tone, epic in scope, it seems more appropriate for grown-ups than for kids. If truth be told, even for adults it is downright strange.&quot;

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the film, writing that it &quot;has the resonance to stand not just as a terrific cartoon but as an emotionally pungent movie&quot;.
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; film critic Peter Travers praised the film and felt that it was &quot;a hugely entertaining blend of music, fun, and eye-popping thrills, though it doesn&#x27;t lack for heart&quot;. James Berardinelli from Reelviews.net praised the film saying, &quot;With each new animated release, Disney seems to be expanding its already-broad horizons a little more. &quot;The Lion King&quot; is the most mature (in more than one sense) of these films, and there clearly has been a conscious effort to please adults as much as children. Happily, for those of us who generally stay far away from &#x27;cartoons&#x27;, they have succeeded.&quot;

Steve Pond of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that &quot;The Lion King&quot; failed to replicate the near-unanimous acclaim achieved by some of its predecessors. Some reviewers still had problems with the film&#x27;s narrative. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt the film &quot;is less of a piece than its revered predecessors and the first to have a core story noticeably less involving than its scintillating peripheral characters.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; wrote that while &quot;The Lion King&quot; was technically proficient and entertaining, it &quot;offers a less memorable song score than did the previous hits, and a hasty, unsatisfying dramatic resolution.&quot; &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s Terrence Rafferty considered that despite the good animation, the story felt like &quot;manipulat[ing] our responses at will&quot;, as &quot;Between traumas, the movie serves up soothingly banal musical numbers and silly, rambunctious comedy&quot;.

===Accolades===
====Other honors====
In 2008, &quot;The Lion King&quot; was ranked as the 319th greatest film ever made by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, and in June 2011, &quot;TIME&quot; named it one of &quot;The 25 All-TIME Best Animated Films&quot;. In June 2008, the American Film Institute listed &quot;The Lion King&quot; as the fourth best film in the animation genre in its AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 list, having previously put &quot;Hakuna Matata&quot; as 99th on its AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs ranking. The film was ranked 66th in a &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; ranking of &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s Top 100 Movies of All Time&quot; and the film ranked 86th in a BBC ranking of the &quot;100 greatest American films.&quot;

In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

===Criticisms===

Protests were raised against one scene where it appears as if the word &quot;SEX&quot; might have been embedded into the dust flying in the sky when Simba flops down, which conservative activist Donald Wildmon asserted was a subliminal message intended to promote sexual promiscuity. Animator Tom Sito has stated that the letters spell &quot;SFX&quot; (a common abbreviation for &quot;special effects&quot;), not with an &quot;E&quot; instead of the &quot;F&quot;, and were intended as an innocent &quot;signature&quot; created by the effects animation team.

Hyena biologists protested against the animal&#x27;s portrayal, though the complaints may have been somewhat tongue-in-cheek. One hyena researcher, who had organized the animators&#x27; visit to the University of California, Berkeley, Field Station for the Study of Behavior, Ecology, and Reproduction, where they would observe and sketch captive hyenas, listed &quot;boycott &quot;The Lion King&quot;&quot; in an article listing ways to help preserve hyenas in the wild, and later &quot;joke[d] that &quot;The Lion King&quot; set back hyena conservation efforts.&quot; Even so, the film was also credited with &quot;spark[ing] an interest&quot; in hyenas at the Berkeley center.

The film has been criticized for race and class issues, with the hyenas seen as reflecting negative stereotypes of black and Latino ethnic communities. Others have also criticized the film for advancing a fascist narrative in its portrayal of a lion kingdom and a circle of life where &quot;only the strong and the beautiful triumph, and the powerless survive only by serving the strong.&quot;

====Claims of resemblance to &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot;====
Certain elements of the film were thought to bear a resemblance to Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s 1960s Japanese anime television series &quot;Jungle Emperor&quot; (known as &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot; in the United States), with some similarities between a number of characters and various individual scenes. The 1994 release of &quot;The Lion King&quot; drew a protest in Japan, where &quot;Kimba&quot; and its creator Osamu Tezuka are cultural icons. 488 Japanese cartoonists and animators, led by manga author Machiko Satonaka, signed a petition accusing Disney of plagiarism and demanding that they give due credit to Tezuka. Matthew Broderick believed initially that he was, in fact, working on an American version of &quot;Kimba&quot; since he was familiar with the Japanese original.

&quot;The Lion King&quot; director Roger Allers claimed complete unfamiliarity with the series until the movie was nearly completed, and did not remember it being ever mentioned during development. Madhavi Sunder has suggested that Allers might have seen the 1989 remake of &quot;Kimba&quot; on prime time television while living in Tokyo. However, while Allers did indeed move to Tokyo in 1983 in order to work on &quot;Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland&quot; (1989), he moved back to the United States in 1985, four years before the 1989 remake of &quot;Kimba&quot; began airing. Co-director Rob Minkoff also stated that he was unfamiliar with it. Minkoff also observed that whenever a story is based in Africa, it is &quot;not unusual to have characters like a baboon, a bird, or hyenas.&quot;

Takayuki Matsutani, the president of Tezuka Productions which created &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot;, said in 1994 that &quot;quite a few staff of our company saw a preview of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, discussed this subject and came to the conclusion that you cannot avoid having these similarities as long as you use animals as characters and try to draw images out of them&quot;. Yoshihiro Shimizu of Tezuka Productions has refuted rumors that the studio was paid hush money by Disney and stated that they have no interest in suing Disney, explaining that &quot;we think it&#x27;s a totally different story&quot;. Shimizu further explained that they rejected urges from some American lawyers to sue because &quot;we&#x27;re a small, weak company... Disney&#x27;s lawyers are among the top twenty in the world!&quot; Tezuka&#x27;s family and Tezuka Productions never pursued litigation.

Fred Ladd, who was involved early on with importing &quot;Kimba&quot; and other Japanese anime into America for NBC, expressed incredulity that Disney&#x27;s people could remain ignorant. Ladd stated there was at least one animator remembered by his colleagues as being an avid &quot;Kimba&quot; fan and being quite vociferous about Disney&#x27;s conduct during production. Animators Tom Sito and Mark Kausler have both stated that they had watched &quot;Kimba&quot; as children in the 1960s. However, Sito maintains there was &quot;absolutely no inspiration&quot; from &quot;Kimba&quot; during the production of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, and Kausler emphasized Disney&#x27;s own &quot;Bambi&quot; as being their model during development.

The controversy surrounding &quot;Kimba&quot; and &quot;The Lion King&quot; was parodied in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Round Springfield&quot;, where Mufasa appears through the clouds and says, &quot;You must avenge my death, Kimba... I mean, Simba.&quot;

==Legacy==

===Sequels and spin-offs===
The first &quot;Lion King&quot;–related animated project was the spin-off television series, &quot;The Lion King&#x27;s Timon &amp; Pumbaa&quot;, which centers on the characters of Timon and Pumbaa, as they have their own (mis)adventures both within&#x27; and outside of the Serengeti. The show ran for three seasons and 85 episodes between 1995 and 1999. Ernie Sabella continued to voice Pumbaa, while Timon was voiced by Quinton Flynn and Kevin Schon in addition to Nathan Lane. One of the show&#x27;s music video segments &quot;Stand By Me&quot;, featuring Timon singing the eponymous song, was later edited into an animated short which was released in 1995, accompanying the theatrical release of &quot;Tom and Huck&quot; (1995).

Disney released two direct-to-video films related to &quot;The Lion King&quot;. The first was sequel &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot;, released in 1998 on VHS. The film centers around Simba and Nala&#x27;s daughter, Kiara, who falls in love with Kovu, a male lion who was raised in a pride of Scar&#x27;s followers, the Outsiders. &quot;The Lion King 1½&quot;, another direct-to-video &quot;Lion King&quot; film, saw its release in 2004. It is a prequel in showing how Timon and Pumbaa met each other, and also a parallel in that it also depicts what the characters were retconned to have done during the events of the original movie.

In June 2014, it was announced that a new TV series based on the film would be released called &quot;The Lion Guard&quot;, featuring Kion, the second-born cub of Simba and Nala. &quot;The Lion Guard&quot; is a sequel to &quot;The Lion King&quot; and takes place during the time-gap within &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot;, with the last 2 episodes of Season 3 taking place after the events of that film. It was first broadcast on Disney Channel as a television film titled &quot;The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar&quot; in November 2015 before airing as a series on Disney Junior in January 2016.

===CGI remake===

In September 2016, following the critical and financial success of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, Walt Disney Pictures announced that they were developing a CGI remake of &quot;The Lion King&quot; by the same name, with Jon Favreau directing. The following month, Jeff Nathanson was hired to write the script for the film. Favreau originally planned to shoot it back-to-back with the sequel to &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. However, it was reported in early 2017 that the latter film was put on hold in order for Favreau to instead focus mainly on &quot;The Lion King&quot;. In February 2017, Favreau announced that Donald Glover had been cast as Simba and that James Earl Jones would be reprising the role of Mufasa. The following month, it was reported that Beyoncé was Favreau&#x27;s top choice to voice Nala, but she had not accepted the role yet due to a pregnancy. In April 2017, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen joined the film as Timon and Pumbaa, respectively. Two months later, John Oliver was cast as Zazu. At the end of July 2017, Beyoncé had reportedly entered final negotiations to play Nala and contribute a new soundtrack. The following month, Chiwetel Ejiofor entered talks to play Scar. Later on, Alfre Woodard and John Kani joined the film as Sarabi and Rafiki, respectively. On November 1, 2017, Beyoncé and Chiwetel Ejiofor were officially confirmed to voice Nala and Scar, with Eric André, Florence Kasumba, Keegan-Michael Key, JD McCrary, and Shahadi Wright Joseph joining the cast as the voices of Azizi, Shenzi, and Kamari, young Simba, and young Nala, respectively, while Hans Zimmer would return to score the film&#x27;s music. On November 28, 2017, it was reported that Elton John had signed onto the project to rework his musical compositions from the original film.

Production for the film began in May 2017. It was released on July 19, 2019.

=== &quot;Black Is King&quot; ===

In June 2020, Parkwood Entertainment and Disney announced that a film titled &quot;Black Is King&quot; would be released on July 31, 2020, on Disney+. The live-action film is inspired by &quot;The Lion King&quot; (2019) and serves as a visual album for the tie-in album &quot;The Lion King: The Gift&quot;, which was curated by Beyoncé for the film. Directed, written and executive produced by Beyoncé, &quot;Black Is King&quot; is described as reimagining &quot;the lessons of &quot;The Lion King&quot; for today&#x27;s young kings and queens in search of their own crowns&quot;. The film chronicles the story of a young African king who undergoes a &quot;transcendent journey through betrayal, love and self-identity&quot; to reclaim his throne, utilizing the guidance of his ancestors and childhood love, with the story being told through the voices of present-day Black people. The cast includes Lupita Nyong&#x27;o, Naomi Campbell, Jay-Z, Kelly Rowland, Pharrell Williams, Tina Knowles-Lawson, Aweng Ade-Chuol, and Adut Akech.

=== &quot;Mufasa: The Lion King&quot; ===

On September 29, 2020, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that a follow-up film was in development with Barry Jenkins attached to direct. While &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said the film would be a prequel about Mufasa during his formative years, &quot;Deadline&quot; said it would be a sequel centering on both Mufasa&#x27;s origins and the events after the first film, similar to &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;. Jeff Nathanson, the screenwriter for the remake, has reportedly finished a draft. In August 2021, it was reported that Aaron Pierre and Kelvin Harrison Jr. had been cast as Mufasa and Scar respectively. The film will not be a remake of &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot;, the 1998 direct-to-video sequel to the original animated film. In September 2022 at the D23 Expo, it was announced that the film will be titled &quot;&quot; and it will follow the titular character&#x27;s origin story. Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner, and John Kani will reprise their roles as Pumbaa, Timon, and Rafiki, respectively. The film was released on December 20, 2024.

===Video games===

Along with the film release, three different video games based on &quot;The Lion King&quot; were released by Virgin Interactive in December 1994. The main title was developed by Westwood Studios, and published for PC and Amiga computers and the consoles SNES and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. Dark Technologies created the Game Boy version, while Syrox Developments handled the Master System and Game Gear version. The film and sequel &quot;Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot; later inspired another game, Torus Games&#x27; &quot;The Lion King: Simba&#x27;s Mighty Adventure&quot; (2000) for the Game Boy Color and PlayStation. Timon and Pumbaa also appeared in &quot;Timon &amp; Pumbaa&#x27;s Jungle Games&quot;, a 1995 PC game collection of puzzle games by 7th Level, later ported to the SNES by Tiertex.

The Square Enix series &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; features Simba as a recurring summon, as well as a playable in the &quot;Lion King&quot; world, known as Pride Lands, in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;. There the plotline is loosely related to the later part of the original film, with all of the main characters except Zazu and Sarabi. &quot;The Lion King&quot; also provides one of the worlds featured in the 2011 action-adventure game &quot;Disney Universe&quot;, and Simba was featured in the Nintendo DS title &quot;Disney Friends&quot; (2008). The video game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot; includes some characters of the film and some attractions based on locations of the film as content to unlock for a limited time.

===Stage adaptations===

Walt Disney Theatrical produced a musical stage adaptation of the same name, which premiered in Minneapolis, Minnesota in July 1997, and later opened on Broadway in October 1997 at the New Amsterdam Theatre. &quot;The Lion King&quot; musical was directed by Julie Taymor and featured songs from both the movie and &quot;Rhythm of the Pride Lands&quot;, along with three new compositions by Elton John and Tim Rice. Mark Mancina did the musical arrangements and new orchestral tracks. To celebrate the African culture background the story is based on, there are six indigenous African languages sung and spoken throughout the show: Swahili, Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, Tswana, Congolese. The musical became one of the most successful in Broadway history, winning six Tony Awards including Best Musical, and despite moving to the Minskoff Theatre in 2006, is still running to this day in New York, becoming the third longest-running show and highest grossing Broadway production in history. The show&#x27;s financial success led to adaptations all over the world.

&quot;The Lion King&quot; inspired two attractions retelling the story of the film at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. The first, &quot;The Legend of the Lion King&quot;, featured a recreation of the film through life-size puppets of its characters, and ran from 1994 to 2002 at Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World. Another that is still running is the live-action 30-minute musical revue of the movie, &quot;Festival of the Lion King&quot;, which incorporates the musical numbers into gymnastic routines with live actors, along with animatronic puppets of Simba and Pumbaa and a costumed actor as Timon. The attraction opened in April 1998 at Disney World&#x27;s Animal Kingdom, and in September 2005 in Hong Kong Disneyland&#x27;s Adventureland. A similar version under the name &quot;The Legend of the Lion King&quot; was featured in Disneyland Paris from 2004 to 2009.

<text>In Norse mythology, Suttungr ( ; Old Norse: ) was a &quot;jötunn&quot; and the son of Gilling.
== Mythology ==
Suttungr searched for his parents and threatened the dwarven brothers Fjalar and Galar who had killed them, tying them and some other dwarves who killed Gilling to a rock that would be submerged by the rising tide. The dwarves begged for Suttungr to spare their life and offered him the magical mead of poetry. Suttungr took it and hid it in the center of the mountain Hnitbjorg, with his daughter Gunnlöð standing guard, whom he turned into a witch in order to guard it.

Odin eventually decided to obtain the mead. He worked for Baugi, Suttungr&#x27;s brother, a farmer, for an entire summer, then asked for a small sip of the mead, which Suttungr refused. Baugi drilled into the mountain and Odin changed into a snake and slithered inside. Inside, Gunnlöð was on guard but he persuaded her to give him three sips in exchange for three nights of sex. Odin proceeded to drink all the mead in the three containers, changed into an eagle and escaped. Suttungr chased him in the shape of an eagle, but Odin was able to escape him and returned to Asgard.

<text>Gunnlǫð (Old Norse: ; also Gunnlöd) is a jötunn in Norse mythology. She is the daughter of Suttungr, for whom she guards the mead of poetry.
Saturn&#x27;s moon Gunnlod is named after her.

== Name ==
The Old Norse name has been translated as &#x27;war-invitation&#x27;, or &#x27;battle-invitation&#x27;. It stems from Old Norse (&#x27;battle&#x27;).

== Attestations ==
&quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (The Language of Poetry) mentions that the jötunn Suttungr has entrusted his daughter Gunnlöð to the guard of the mead of poetry:
But Odin, in the form of a snake, manages to gain access to the chamber within the Hnitbjörg mountain where the mead is kept. The god seduces the guardian Gunnlöð, and sleeps with her three nights. In return, Gunnlöð allows Odin to obtain three drinks of the mead, after which he immediately flies himself out of the cavern as an eagle.
In &quot;Hávamál&quot; (Sayings of the High One), the account given by Odin differs in a number of details, and the narrative pays most attention to Gunnlöð herself.

<doc id="88681" wikidata="Q339616" url="?curid=88681" title="Quarter note">
<text>A quarter note (AmE) or crotchet (BrE) () is a musical note played for one quarter of the duration of a whole note (or semibreve). Quarter notes are notated with a filled-in oval note head and a straight, flagless stem. The stem usually points upwards if it is below the middle line of the staff, and downwards if it is on or above the middle line. An upward stem is placed on the right side of the notehead, a downward stem is placed on the left (see image). The Unicode symbol is U+2669 (♩).

A quarter [[rest (music)|rest]] (or crotchet rest) denotes a silence of the same duration as a quarter note or crotchet. It is notated with the symbol . In some older music it was notated with symbol .

==History==

The quarter note equates to the (&#x27;half minim&#x27;) of mensural notation. The word &quot;crotchet&quot; comes from Old French , meaning &#x27;little hook&#x27;, diminutive of , &#x27;hook&#x27;, because of the hook used on the note in black notation of the medieval period.

As the name implies, a quarter note&#x27;s duration is one quarter that of a whole note, half the length of a half note, and twice that of an eighth note. It represents one beat in a bar of time. The term &quot;quarter note&quot; is a calque (loan-translation) of the German term . 

In the Romance languages of Catalan, French, Galician, and Spanish, the name of this note and its equivalent rest is derived from the Latin meaning &#x27;black&#x27;—as the was the longest note to be colored in mensural white notation. This is still true of the note&#x27;s modern form. The Bulgarian, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Serbian and Slovak names mean &quot;quarter&quot; (for the note) and &quot;quarter&#x27;s pause&quot; (for the rest).

<text>In music, a half note (American) or minim (British) is a note played for half the duration of a whole note (or semibreve) and twice the duration of a quarter note (or crotchet). It was given its Latin name (&quot;minima&quot;, meaning &quot;least or smallest&quot;) because it was the shortest of the five note values used in early medieval music notation. 
Half notes are notated with a hollow oval notehead like a whole note and straight note stem with no flags like a quarter note (see Figure 1). The half rest (or minim rest) denotes a silence of the same duration. Half rests are drawn as filled-in rectangles sitting on top of the middle line of the musical staff, although in polyphonic music the rest may need to be moved to a different line or even a ledger line. As with all notes with stems, half notes are drawn with upward stems on the right when they are below the middle line of the staff and downward stems on the left when they are on or above the middle line. In vocal music, notes on the middle line have a downward stem instead of an upward stem.

The American term &quot;half note&quot; is a 19th-century loan translation of German &quot;halbe Note&quot;.

The Catalan, French, and Spanish names (&quot;blanca&quot;, &quot;blanche&quot;, meaning &quot;white&quot;) derive from the fact that the &quot;minima&quot; was the shortest unfilled note in mensural white notation, which is true of the modern form as well. The form in the earlier black notation resembles the modern quarter note (crotchet). The Greek, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean names mean &quot;half&quot;, and in Greek, the modern word (&quot;miso&quot; – μισό) and older (&quot;imisi&quot; – ήμισι) are used.

<doc id="88695" wikidata="Q3922571" url="?curid=88695" title="Professional Widow">
<text>&quot;Professional Widow&quot; is a song written by the American singer-songwriter Tori Amos, released on her third album, &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; (1996). It is a harpsichord-driven rock song and its lyrics are rumored to have been inspired by the American songwriter Courtney Love. The song was released on July 2, 1996, by Atlantic and EastWest, as the third single from the &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; album in the US, containing remixes by the house music producers Armand van Helden and MK. The single reached number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. In Italy, the original version peaked at number two in October 1996. An edited version of the Armand&#x27;s Star Trunk Funkin&#x27; Mix of &quot;Professional Widow&quot; was originally released as a double A-side single with &quot;Hey Jupiter&quot; in Europe and Australia. 

On December 30, 1996, van Helden&#x27;s remix was released as a single in the UK as &quot;Professional Widow (It&#x27;s Got to Be Big)&quot;, which topped the UK Singles Chart in January 1997 and reached the top 20 in Finland, Iceland, Ireland and Norway. In 2022, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named the remix the 109th-greatest dance song of all-time.

==Lyrics==
&quot;Professional Widow&quot; is rumored to be about the American songwriter Courtney Love, the widow of the Nirvana songwriter Kurt Cobain. Love said she had never determined if she was the &quot;professional widow&quot; of the title. In 1996, Amos said she had never met Love and that the song was about her own experience and &quot;the part of myself that&#x27;s Lady Macbeth&quot;. In a 2003 television interview, when the host said the song was inspired by Love, Amos interrupted with &quot;allegedly&quot; and smiled.

==Remix==
&quot;Professional Widow&quot; was remixed by the American DJ Armand van Helden. In Europe, the remix became more widely known than the original song.

Van Helden said that Amos was contractually entitled to approve all remixes, and when the remix became popular in Europe, she called to thank him. In a 1998 interview with &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot;, Amos said: &quot;It did kick my ass a bit [...] I know what van Helden took and what he did and I think he did some very clever things [...] I loved the fact that he didn&#x27;t try and retain that at all, he went completely to the other pole.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Scottish &quot;Aberdeen Press and Journal&quot; praised the song as &quot;excellent&quot;. Justin Chadwick from Albumism wrote in his retrospective review of &quot;Boys for Pele&quot;, &quot;Though much of the world is more familiar with the propulsive, dancefloor-filling Armand Van Helden remix of &#x27;Professional Widow&#x27;, its original incarnation featured here is noteworthy for its much-debated allusions to none other than Courtney Love.&quot; Neil Z. Yeung from AllMusic described it as a &quot;powerful dose of industrial-piano ferocity that holds nothing back in its demands for peace, love, and a little something extra.&quot; Paul Verna from &quot;Billboard&quot; named it a &quot;highlight&quot; of the album, viewing it as &quot;searing&quot; and &quot;groove-heavy&quot;. The Daily Vault&#x27;s Sean McCarthy felt it&#x27;s one of the most &quot;straightforward&quot; songs of the album. Kevin Courtney from &quot;Irish Times&quot; declared it as &quot;a mad maelstrom of beats and harpsichord arpeggia, a sort of Portishead for the beaten generation&quot;. In a separate review of the remix, Courtney wrote, &quot;Older fans of Tori&#x27;s introspective balladeering will be bemused that their heroine now sounds like Stretch &amp; Vern. Calling this a Tori Amos single is like describing &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; as a Sting song, and the lady&#x27;s sampled voice is just incidental to the handbag-heaving beat and bassline.&quot; 

Alan Jones from &quot;Music Week&quot; deemed the remix as a &quot;brilliant reworking&quot; and remarked that &quot;it is as different from the rest of the album as chalk is from cheese.&quot; Tim Jeffery from &quot;Record Mirror&quot;″s Dance Update gave it top score with five out of five, adding, &quot;Needless to say, any lyrical subtlety has gone out of the window on this remixed package but that&#x27;s not the point really. MK and Armand Van Helden pick and choose which of Tori&#x27;s lines to chop up into bits and loop over their own music — Helden&#x27;s is by far the most inventive with loads of strange synth sounds over a Bucketheads-style groove and a terrific atmospheric drop in the middle. A big club hit for sure but it&#x27;ll be radio that decides this record&#x27;s success or otherwise.&quot; Cynthia Joyce from &quot;Salon&quot; noted that Amos&#x27; &quot;penchant for abrupt endings and ad nauseam repetition; still surfaces on more experimental songs&quot; like &quot;Professional Widow&quot;. Kevin Newman from &quot;Smash Hits&quot; named it the best track of the album with &quot;Caught a Lite Sneeze&quot;, describing it as &quot;more-Björk-than-Björk&quot;. In 2014, &quot;Stereogum&quot; ranked the song number 10 on their list of the 10 greatest Tori Amos songs, &quot;Mixmag&quot; featured it in their list of the best basslines in dance music in 2020, and in 2023, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the song number five on their list of the 20 greatest Tori Amos songs. In 2022, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named the &quot;Professional Widow&quot; remix the 109th-greatest dance song of all-time.

==Music video==
A music video was made for the &quot;Star Trunk Funkin&#x27; Mix&quot;, comprising clips from other Amos videos edited together. It is the only video from between 1991 and 1998 that does not appear on &quot;Tori Amos: Complete Videos 1991–1998&quot;.

A live performance of the song is featured on the &quot;Welcome to Sunny Florida&quot; DVD. The performance features Jon Evans on bass and Matt Chamberlain on drums, while Amos plays the piano. This version mutes the words &quot;fucker&quot; and &quot;cock&quot;.

<text>Montgomery College (MC) is a public community college in Montgomery County, Maryland. 

The school was founded in 1946 as Montgomery Junior College. Four years later, it absorbed the 57-year-old Bliss Electrical School, which became the junior college&#x27;s electrical program.

The college has three campuses, the largest of which is in Rockville. Its other campuses are in Takoma Park/Silver Spring and Germantown. Its off-campus sites include the Business Training Center in Gaithersburg and Westfield South in Wheaton, which are operated by the college&#x27;s Workforce Development and Continuing Education Division.

== History ==
=== Bliss School of Electricity ===
The Bliss School of Electricity was a private, for-profit institution which claimed to be the oldest school teaching electricity in the world. Established in 1893 and named after its founder Louis D. Bliss, its first class was held on October 15, 1893, in a single room on the third floor of the Warder Building at Ninth and F streets NW in Washington, D.C. It started as a night class with 26 students, including Thomas E. Robertson, who would later go on to be the United States Commissioner of Patents. The capital investment in the school was $400, representing an advance payment of $20 each from 20 men. During the eight-month session of 1894–1895, about 75 men enrolled and paid $50 of tuition each. In 1895, Charles Francis Jenkins, of motion picture and television fame, enrolled as a student. The school later moved to 219 G Street NW in Washington, D.C.

W. B. Connelly, a 1904 graduate of Bliss, worked for the General Electric Company at Schenectady, N.Y., where he led the inspection of some two miles of switchboards for the Panama Canal. Before going to General Electric, Connelly taught at Bliss; his student Skipwith B. Cole would later become dean of the school&#x27;s faculty.

===Move to Takoma Park===
In July 1908, the Bliss Electrical School bought the four-story North Takoma Hotel and its 4.5 acres of land from Thomas H. Pickford. Located on Takoma Avenue between New York and Chicago avenues, the hotel had originally been built by Benjamin F. Gilbert in 1892. Bliss intended to remodel the four-story hotel building into space for classes.
===Fire===
Eight weeks after classes were first held in the new building, the school building burned to the ground around 2:45a.m. on November 6, 1908. The fire forced almost 200 students in the second floor dormitory to escape the building. As there were no fire escapes, the students climbed out of windows using ropes intended for that purpose. The fire was caused by gas leak in the first-floor kitchen. At the time, Takoma Park did not have a fire station; the closest one was located nearly two miles away in Brightwood.

Afterwards, many Takoma Park residents allowed the students to stay in their homes, many of whom had come from elsewhere in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Brazil, and Japan. The City of Takoma allowed the Bliss School to use Takoma Hall for classes temporarily, as did Takoma Park Presbyterian Church. A new two-story building of brick and reinforced concrete was built at the same site, opening for classes in September 1909. A bungalow across the street was acquired to be used as a dining room.
On June 3, 1914, Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan addressed the school&#x27;s graduating class in the auditorium of the Calvary Baptist Church. Bryan said, &quot;No one can set a limit on the growth of the electrical profession. There are greater opportunities for greater discoveries than in any other department of activity. Before you lies a field in which any one of you may be a pioneer.&quot;

===World War I===
In 1917, the United States entered World War I. By special permission granted by the War Department, the Bliss Electrical School organized a searchlight company of engineers consisting of 57 men from the 1917 class, headed by Lt. Clyde K. Krisee of the faculty, and under Major John C. Gotwals of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This company went overseas with the First Division of the American Expeditionary Forces. These men were used for instruction purposes in a searchlight school in Paris. All returned safely to the United States after the war except one, who was killed in an automobile accident in Paris. The captured German searchlight, which adorns the campus, was presented to the Bliss School of Electricity by the War Department as a tribute to the work of the Bliss Searchlight Company of Engineers.

At the request of the War Department in 1918, Bliss School prepared an intensive training course in the fundamentals of electricity for drafted men entering the Army. This course was adopted by the War Department, and was the first course used in all the colleges throughout the country, giving instructions along this line to army personnel in the Student Army Training Corps. The school contracted with the War Department to house, feed, and instruct selected groups of soldiers for this course. Beginning June 15, 1918, the school trained 700 soldiers in three detachments. The contract called for training these men at cost. This cost was determined by the auditors in the War Department at $2.00 for the first detachment, at $1.80 for the second detachment, and $1.62 for the third detachment per man per day for housing, feeding, instruction, and supplies. The school was under military control following instruction hence, following the signing of the armistice on November 11, 1918. The third and last detachment of the Student Army Training Corps was mustered out and disbanded on December 6, 1918, and the school was released from military control. In 1919, Bliss returned to civilian training. The first edition of the Bliss School textbook, &quot;Theoretical and Practical Electrical Engineering&quot;, was published in September 1921.

===World War II===
During World War II, the Bliss School was selected by the U.S. Navy as one of six engineering schools to give Primary School in the Electronics Training Program and it graduated over 3,000 students. Bliss Electrical School&#x27;s building was sold to Montgomery County for $350,000. 
===Montgomery Junior College===
The current college was organized in 1946 as Montgomery Junior College, with its campus located at the Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School. Its first dean was Hugh G. Price. The first day of class was held on September 16, 1946. During its first school year, it had about 175 students.

In 1950, the college moved to Takoma Park, absorbing the Bliss Electrical School 
Previously, Montgomery Junior College could only hold evening classes because the high school used the building for its classes during the day, but with the acquisition of Bliss School of Electricity&#x27;s building, Montgomery Junior College began holding daytime classes as well. The first day of classes at the new location began on October 2, 1950. At the time, it was segregated, with an enrollment of over 500 students. The newly established Carver Junior College in Rockville was expected to have 40 African-Americans enrolled, but only 19 managed to show up, due both to problems in finding transportation to school and the cost of tuition.

The Rockville campus of Montgomery College opened in September 1965, and the Germantown campus opened in early 1970s, occupying its present permanent site since 1978. Montgomery College also offers learning opportunities through its extensive Workforce Development and Continuing education programs.

=== 21st century ===
In 2010, DeRionne Pollard assumed leadership of Montgomery College and its three campuses. She spearheaded the development of a new Montgomery College mission and strategic plan. She has partnered actively with Montgomery County Public Schools and the Universities at Shady Grove in the creation of Achieving Collegiate Excellence and Success (ACES), a support program designed to help disadvantaged students transition from high school to college completion. The program now has 1,700 students enrolled. Montgomery College is also a member of Achieving the Dream network, a non-governmental reform movement for student success at community colleges.

In 2016, NBC 4 investigated frivolous spending claims made by students and staff against Pollard. NBC 4 had received letters from staff throughout the summer asking the news organization to investigate the president. In response, the school released a statement supporting Pollard and claiming that none of the charges were justified and that there was no inappropriate use of college funds. The matter was dropped.

== Campuses ==

=== Takoma Park / Silver Spring ===
The Takoma Park campus began expanding into neighboring city of Silver Spring with the opening of a new Health Sciences Center in January 2004. To reflect the campus&#x27;s expansion into Silver Spring, the board of trustees renamed the Takoma Park campus as the &quot;Takoma Park/Silver Spring Campus&quot; in June 2005. The campus expansion in Silver Spring included the addition of The Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Arts Center which opened in fall 2007. The building houses the campus visual arts programs and the School of Art + Design, formerly the Maryland College of Art and Design, which merged with Montgomery College in September 2004. The Cultural Arts Center, which contains two theaters, opened in 2009. The West Garage, a six-story parking garage with 357 spaces, opened in 2010. On the east side of the campus, a new Student Services Center opened in 2006, the building was later renamed in honor of former college president, Charlene R. Nunley. In 2013, the Commons Building was named in honor of a former faculty member, Catherine F. Scott in appreciation of a $1 million gift she donated to the Montgomery College Foundation. The Commons Building and Pavilion 3 Building underwent comprehensive renovations that were completed in 2010 and 2015 respectively. In 2019, the Falcon Hall and Science South buildings were demolished to make room for a new building, and the Resource Center closed for a major renovation project that is expected to be completed in late January 2025. In September 2024, the college opened the Leggett Math and Science Building a three story building featuring 8 multi-use classrooms, 20 laboratories, a planetarium, a STEM forum, and a greenhouse. The building was named in honor of former Montgomery County Executive, Ike Leggett, and his wife, Catherine.

<text>A whole note (American) or semibreve (British) in musical notation is a single note equivalent to or lasting as long as two half notes or four quarter notes.
== Description ==
The whole note or semibreve has a note head in the shape of a hollow oval—like a half note (or &quot;minim&quot;)—but with no note stem (see Figure 1). Since it is equal to four quarter notes, it occupies the entire length of a measure in time.

Other notes are multiples or fractions of the whole note. For example, a double whole note (or &quot;breve&quot;) lasts twice the duration of the whole note, a half note lasts one half the duration, and a quarter note (or &quot;crotchet&quot;) lasts one quarter the duration.

A related symbol is the whole rest (or semibreve rest), which signifies a rest for the duration of a whole note. Whole rests are drawn as filled-in rectangles generally hanging under the second line from the top of a musical staff, though they may occasionally be put under a different line (or ledger line) in more complicated polyphonic passages, or when two instruments or vocalists are written on one staff.

The whole note may also be used to denote a whole measure in music of free rhythm, such as Anglican chant, irrespective of the time of the measure.

== History ==
The whole note symbol is first found in music notation from the late thirteenth century . It derives from the round, stemless of mensural notation, hence the origin of the British name.

== Nomenclature ==

The British term is taken from Italian &quot;semibreve&quot;, itself built upon Latin &quot;semi-&quot; &quot;half&quot; and &quot;brevis&quot; &quot;short.&quot; The American &quot;whole note&quot; is a calque of the German . Some languages derive the name of the note from its round shape, such as Catalan &quot;rodona&quot;, French &quot;ronde&quot;, and Spanish &quot;redonda&quot;. The Greek name means &quot;whole&quot;. The Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese names mean &quot;whole note&quot;.

<text>Steve Caton is an American musician, songwriter, producer, and visual artist, perhaps best known for a lengthy association with Tori Amos.

== Career ==
Caton&#x27;s first band experience was as a member of Pegasus in the late 1970s. He first gained widespread attention as the guitarist for Y Kant Tori Read, featuring the then-unknown singer Tori Amos. That band released one self-titled album in 1988. After that band split, Caton served as a session musician for artists in a variety of genres. When Amos went solo in the early 1990s, Caton played on all of her albums and the associated tours until 1999.

Caton also wrote and produced music for movies and television throughout the 1980s and 1990s. He started a band called Binge with Matt Sorum (also a former member of Y Kant Tori Read) in 1997. That band released one album. Caton then moved into a career in graphic arts and video production, particularly for the surfboard industry.

<text>Y Kant Tori Read was an American synth-pop band fronted by singer-songwriter Tori Amos and active between 1984 and 1989. The band originally consisted of vocalist and keyboardist Amos, guitarist Steve Caton, drummer Matt Sorum (later of Guns N&#x27; Roses), and bassist Brad Cobb. The band&#x27;s name comes from an incident in Amos&#x27;s childhood where she was asked to leave the Peabody Conservatory because she refused to read sheet music.

The band released one album, also called &quot;Y Kant Tori Read&quot; (1988), which was considered a dismal commercial failure. Atlantic Records abandoned the album completely after two months of release. The band worked with record producer Joe Chiccarelli and Kim Bullard, later of Kajagoogoo. 

Two singles were released. The first, &quot;The Big Picture&quot;, was commercially issued exclusively as a 7&quot; vinyl single, and without a picture sleeve, though the 12&quot; vinyl promo did have one. The second single, &quot;Cool on Your Island&quot;, was issued as a cassette single and 7&quot; vinyl single, this time with a picture sleeve; and in various promo 7&quot; vinyl singles. Neither single was successful.

A music video for their song &quot;The Big Picture&quot; was made, but the only member of the band featured was Amos, since by then, unable to withstand pressure from Atlantic Records, she had jettisoned the rest of them with the exception of Steve Caton.

<doc id="88704" wikidata="Q236181" url="?curid=88704" title="Sandra Bernhard">
<text>Sandra Bernhard (born June 6, 1955) is an American actress, comedian, and singer. She first gained attention in the late 1970s with her stand-up comedy, where she often critiqued celebrity culture and political figures.

She played Nancy Bartlett Thomas on the ABC sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot; from the fourth season (1991) to the end of the show in 1997. She played Nurse Judy Kubrak in the FX drama series &quot;Pose&quot;. She is number 96 on Comedy Central&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest stand-ups of all time.

==Early life==
Bernhard was born June 6, 1955, in Flint, Michigan, the daughter of Jeanette (née LaZebnik) and proctologist Jerome Bernhard. Her parents raised her as a Conservative Jew.

She has three older brothers: Dan, David, and Mark. Her family moved to Arizona when she was 10. She attended Saguaro High School in Scottsdale, graduating in 1973.

In 1973 she traveled to Israel and stayed for 7 months at Kibbutz Kfar Menahem with her friend Daniel Chick. She later returned to Israel during the Yom Kippur War.

==Career==
Bernhard became a staple at The Comedy Store in Hollywood. As her popularity as a comedian grew, she was cast as a supporting player on &quot;The Richard Pryor Show&quot; in 1977. Guest appearances on evening talk shows followed. Her big break came in 1981 when she was cast by Martin Scorsese to star as stalker/kidnapper Masha in the film &quot;The King of Comedy&quot;, for which she won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress. She was a frequent guest on David Letterman&#x27;s NBC program &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, making 28 appearances starting in 1983.

She began performing her first one-woman show, &quot;I&#x27;m Your Woman&quot;, in 1985, and an album version was released. She appeared in a variety of small television roles throughout the 1980s while crafting her stand-up routine into a more performance art-oriented show. She launched an off-Broadway one-woman show called &quot;Without You, I&#x27;m Nothing, With You, I&#x27;m Not Much Better&quot; in 1988, which played at the Orpheum Theatre. By 1990, it had become a film and a double album of the same title. The album was recorded in 1988 at the Orpheum and released in 1989 and the film was mostly shot on location in 1989 in the Cocoanut Grove nightclub at the Ambassador Hotel. Bernhard was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album in 1990.

During the run of &quot;Without You, I&#x27;m Nothing, With You, I&#x27;m Not Much Better&quot; Bernhard appeared with her then good friend (and rumored lover) Madonna on a 1988 episode of &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. The two alluded to their romantic relationship and staged a sexy confrontation; the appearance received much publicity. They continued to be friends for several years, with Bernhard making an appearance in Madonna&#x27;s film &quot;&quot;. The friendship ended in 1992.

In 1991, Bernhard began playing Nancy Bartlett on the hit sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot;. She appeared in 33 episodes between 1991 and 1997, and was one of the first actresses to portray an openly bisexual recurring character on American television. In September 1992, Bernhard appeared in a nude pictorial for &quot;Playboy&quot;. She hosted the USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Reel Wild Cinema&quot; for two seasons beginning in 1995. She continued acting in mostly independent films, TV guest roles, and forays into mainstream films such as &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot; and &quot;Dallas Doll&quot;. In 1991, she released her first studio album, &quot;Excuses for Bad Behavior (Part One)&quot;. In 1995, she briefly appeared as a guest in the &quot;Jerk&quot; episode of the animated talk show &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;. In 1996, she guest-starred on an episode of &quot;&quot; called &quot;Dramatic License&quot;, where she played a romance novelist writing about the life of the main character.

She appeared as herself on &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, in an episode where the title characters spuriously bid on Bernhard&#x27;s Manhattan apartment in an attempt to become friendly with her. When their ruse is exposed, Bernhard rants at them, with the sounds of a blender (she was having a smoothie made) blotting out supposed obscenities. She briefly returned as herself two years later.

Bernhard returned to Broadway in 1998 with the show &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here... Damn It!&quot;, recorded for a live comedy album. She was pregnant at the time, and gave birth to daughter Cicely Yasin Bernhard on July 4, 1998. She returned to New York in 2006 with the off-Broadway show &quot;Everything Bad &amp; Beautiful&quot;. The CD of the show, released by indie label Breaking Records, was lauded as one of her best. That year she also hosted the first season of the reality competition show &quot;The Search for the Funniest Mother in America&quot; on Nick at Nite. 2007 saw the debut of her one-woman show &quot;Plan B from Outer Space&quot;, and the inclusion of her Hanukkah-themed song &quot;Miracle of Lights&quot;, which she co-wrote with Mitchell Kaplan, in the Breaking Records compilation album &quot;Breaking For the Holidays&quot;. She toured &quot;Plan B&quot; through 2008 and performed &quot;Miracle of Lights&quot; on some morning shows in New York.

Bernhard was a featured guest singer with children&#x27;s artist Dan Zanes on the &quot;Family Dance&quot; album&#x27;s &quot;Thrift Shop&quot;. In an interview with Howard Stern, she revealed that she was originally offered the role of Miranda Hobbes on the TV show &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, but opted out owing to the &quot;terrible&quot; original script and small paycheck. In 2013, it was announced that she would join the cast of ABC Family&#x27;s &quot;Switched at Birth&quot; with &quot;Glee&quot;″s Max Adler, where she would play an art professor on the season 3 opener in January 2014. In 2015, she began hosting a radio show, &quot;Sandyland&quot;, on Sirius XM&#x27;s Radio Andy.

In 2015, she made her first appearance as the recurring character of Joedth (&quot;Joe&quot;) in season 4 of &quot;2 Broke Girls&quot;. From 2018 until 2021, she played Nurse Judy on FX&#x27;s &quot;Pose&quot;, a show based on queer and trans ball culture in Manhattan inspired by the documentary &quot;Paris Is Burning&quot;. In 2025, she appeared in &quot;Severance&quot; as Cecily, a nurse.

==Public controversies==
In 1995, while serving as a guest panelist on the Comedy Central talk show &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;, Bernhard became engaged in an argument with fellow panelist, conservative political commentator John Lofton. Bernhard then stood up and spat at Lofton and exclaimed, &quot;If I had you, you’d be an abortion.&quot;

In August 2006, Bernhard served as the spokesperson in a commercial for Make-up Art Cosmetics (MAC). In the commercial, promoting PlushGlass lipgloss, she referred to someone who might not approve of her outspokenness as a &quot;little freaked out, intimidated, frightened, right-wing Republican thin-lipped bitch.&quot; MAC edited the line from the commercial to avoid offending some of its customers.

In September 2008, she warned vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin that she would be gang-raped by her &quot;big black brothers&quot; if she visited Manhattan. Palin had a campaign stop planned in New York City at the time.

In November 2020, during an interview with Mariah Carey, Naomi Campbell called out Bernhard for her comments about Carey and Black men in her 1998 comedy show &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here… Damn It!&quot; In the show, Bernhard disparaged Carey&#x27;s Black ancestry, saying &quot;She&#x27;s trying to backtrack on our asses by acting real nigger-ish there at the Royalton Hotel suite with Puff Daddy and all the greasy, chain-wearing Black men.&quot;

==Personal life==
Bernhard identifies herself as bisexual and is a strong supporter of LGBT rights. On July 4, 1998, she gave birth to a daughter, whom she raised with Sara Switzer, her partner of over 20 years. Bernhard was also in a relationship with Venezuelan actress Patricia Velasquez.

==Music==
Bernhard performs classic pop music, jazz, and blues tunes. She has released several albums (combinations of music and comedy).

<doc id="88705" wikidata="Q1073464" url="?curid=88705" title="China O'Brien">
<text>China O&#x27;Brien is a 1990 martial arts film produced by Golden Harvest studios and starring actress and martial artist Cynthia Rothrock with co-stars Richard Norton and Keith Cooke. The film was directed by Robert Clouse, the fight choreography was by Nijel Binns, and it was executive produced by Raymond Chow. Rothrock plays a former cop who runs for sheriff after her father, the previous sheriff, is killed.

== Plot ==
Police officer China O&#x27;Brien is a good cop who teaches martial arts class to her fellow officers. After an altercation with a gang that leads to the accidental death of a young boy, China resigns from the force, and returns to her hometown of Beaver Creek, Utah. On her way into town she runs into her former high school sweetheart Matt Conroy. Searching for her father, she goes to the Beaver Creek Inn and encounters a hostile situation, as her father has just arrested one of the men there. Her father, John O&#x27;Brien, is the town sheriff. China finally catches up with him back at the station. John is losing control of the town to local crime boss Edwin Sommers, who controls corrupt deputy Marty Lickner and corrupt local judge Harry Godar. When John and honest deputy Ross Tyler are killed by car bombs that were planted by Sommers&#x27;s henchmen, there is an emergency election to elect a new sheriff.

Matt tells China that she has a lot of support from the townspeople, so she decides to run for sheriff against Lickner. At the same time, she starts cleaning up the town with the help of Matt and a Native American biker named Dakota, whose mother was murdered by Sommers. China wins the election, and then Maria, who had been her father&#x27;s housekeeper up until his death, is murdered by Sommers&#x27; men in a drive-by shooting during the victory celebration. China has to force Judge Godar to swear her in as the new sheriff. China deputizes Matt and Dakota, and they set out to free Beaver Creek from Sommers&#x27; stranglehold.

First, they bulldoze a house that Sommers was using to distribute drugs. Then, during an altercation at the Beaver Creek Inn, Dakota questions Lickner about his mother, and Lickner admits Sommers was responsible for his mother&#x27;s death. Dakota takes Lickner&#x27;s gun and gets on his motorcycle to Sommers&#x27;s home. China realises Dakota intends to confront Sommers, and so she and Matt pursue Dakota. Dakota finds Sommers at the stables and points the gun at him. However, he restrains himself and when China and Matt arrive, Sommers is still alive. Matt handcuffs himself to Sommers but as they leave the stable, a woman that Sommers had locked up and beaten fires at Sommers and kills him. The next day, China asks Dakota what he will do next. Dakota says he will stay for the trial and China tells him she could use a man like him. Dakota laughs off being a cop to which Matt replies that they can discuss it over a beer.

== Production ==
Parts of the film were shot in Park City, Utah.

After a career in Hong Kong, Golden Harvest worked to raise Rothrock&#x27;s profile in her native America, and she was cast in &quot;China O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Film scholar Rikke Schubart says the producers paired her with Richard Norton, who plays her former highschool boyfriend, and made her the daughter of a slain cop to make her more feminine and seem less threatening. Production halted temporarily when Rothrock had to fly back to Hong Kong to reshoot the ending scene of &quot;Righting Wrongs&quot; after the original cut was met with a negative reception in Taiwan.

Early in her career, Tori Amos recorded a song, &quot;Distant Storm&quot;, which can only be heard by viewing the original film. Amos did not want to be credited under her real name and created a fake band, Tess Makes Good, to be credited.

== Release ==
&quot;China O&#x27;Brien&quot; was released direct-to-video in the United States in 1990.

== Reception ==
&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;an okay showcase&quot; for Rothrock.
== Sequel ==
&quot;China O&#x27;Brien II&quot; was released in 1990, with the same cast and crew.

<doc id="88706" wikidata="Q339575" url="?curid=88706" title="Eighth note">
<text>An eighth note (American) or a quaver (British) is a musical note played for one eighth the duration of a whole note (semibreve). Its length relative to other rhythmic values is as expected—e.g., half the duration of a quarter note (crotchet), one quarter the duration of a half note (minim), and twice the value of a sixteenth note. It is the equivalent of the &quot;fusa&quot; in mensural notation.

Eighth notes are notated with an oval, filled-in note head and a straight note stem with one note flag (see Figure 1).
The stem is on the right of the notehead extending upwards or on the left extending downwards, depending primarily on where the notehead lies relative to the middle line of the staff. A related symbol is the eighth rest (or quaver rest), which denotes a silence for the same duration.

Eighth notes may be beamed together in groups (Figure 2). In , , , and they are typically beamed in groups of three. A single eighth note is always stemmed with a flag, while two or more are usually beamed in groups in instrumental music.

In Unicode, the symbol U+266A (♪) is a single eighth note and U+266B (♫) is a beamed pair of eighth notes. These symbols are inherited from the early 1980s code page 437, where they occupied codes 13 and 14 respectively. Additions to the Unicode standard incorporated eighth note depictions from Japanese emoji sets: ascending eighth notes (U+1F39C, 🎜), descending eighth notes (U+1F39D, 🎝), a graphical generic musical note generally depicted as an eighth note (U+1F3B5, 🎵), and three unconnected eighth notes in sequence (U+1F3B6, 🎶). All of these are graphical dingbats. In contrast, Unicode&#x27;s Musical Symbols block includes eighth note symbols designed to be used in computerized musical notation.

<doc id="88712" wikidata="Q1944591" url="?curid=88712" title="From the Choirgirl Hotel">
<text>From the Choirgirl Hotel (stylised in all lowercase) is the fourth studio album by American musician Tori Amos. It was released on May 5, 1998, on Atlantic Records. The album was Amos&#x27;s first to be recorded at her own Martian Engineering Studios in Cornwall, England and was self produced, with the mixing being handled by longtime collaborators Marcel van Limbeek and Mark Hawley, whom she had married in early 1998.

In contrast with the sparse, minimalist sound of Amos&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;From the Choirgirl Hotel&quot; features a greater emphasis on full band arrangements. Additionally, the album sees Amos integrate elements of electronica, trip hop, and dance music. The album marks the first appearance of Matt Chamberlain on drums; he has gone on to contribute to the majority of Amos&#x27;s albums ever since.

&quot;From the Choirgirl Hotel&quot; was commercially and critically successful. It peaked at number 5 in the US, becoming Amos&#x27;s second straight top ten album in her home country, and reached number 6 in the UK. &quot;Spark&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single, reached number 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, her highest position on the chart. Two further singles—&quot;Jackie&#x27;s Strength&quot; and &quot;Raspberry Swirl&quot; / &quot;Cruel&quot;—were released, with the former reaching the top of the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. The album garnered two Grammy nominations – one for Best Alternative Music Performance, and another for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance (for &quot;Raspberry Swirl&quot;). Amos promoted the album with the &quot;Plugged &#x27;98&quot; tour, her first with a full band. Performances from the tour were included on the live disc of her next release, &quot;To Venus and Back&quot;.

==Album description==
The album began recording in September 1997, with mastering complete by early February 1998. Following the trend set by 1996&#x27;s &quot;Boys for Pele&quot;, Amos allowed several songs from the album to be remixed. Remixes of both &quot;Raspberry Swirl&quot; and &quot;Jackie&#x27;s Strength&quot; were club hits. The album&#x27;s theme dealt very closely with the first two in Amos&#x27;s series of three miscarriages between 1996 and 1999.

Thematically and conceptually, the &quot;choirgirl hotel&quot; of the title refers to the fictional, imaginary place where the songs &quot;live&quot;. Amos pointed out that although the songs are recorded, they are also alive themselves – they can be re-modeled and reshaped in concert. Amos imagined the songs as living their own lives, all checking into the &quot;choirgirl hotel&quot; (i.e., the album) but living separate lives. In the artwork, Amos included a hand-drawn map detailing the stomping ground of these songs.

The album artwork was created by the UK-based photographer, Katerina Jebb. The artwork features full-body color photocopies of Amos (in various couture outfits) as scanned by a human-sized photocopier.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The kookiness isn&#x27;t dominant, she&#x27;s stopped the attention-seeking lyrics almost completely and, yes, her pianos don&#x27;t try to be guitars too often,&quot; enthused John Aizlewood in &quot;Q&quot;. &quot;At last, she&#x27;s putting the songs first, and the band-led &quot;From the Choirgirl Hotel&quot; is, by any reasonable yardstick, a glorious coming of age.&quot;

==Track listing==
Notes
*The track &#x27;Merman&#x27; was released as a pre-order bonus track*

===B-sides===
Like Amos&#x27;s previous Atlantic albums, several songs recorded during the &quot;From the Choirgirl Hotel&quot; sessions were released as B-sides, and introduced into Amos&#x27;s live performance repertoire. &quot;Cooling,&quot; &quot;Never Seen Blue,&quot; and &quot;Beulah Land&quot; were originally written and recorded for 1996&#x27;s &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; album. Several tracks from a demo CD for the album leaked online in 2010, including &quot;Violet&#x27;s Eyes&quot;. Parts of this song evolved into &quot;Almost Rosey&quot; and &quot;Miracle&quot; from 2007&#x27;s &quot;American Doll Posse&quot;.

<text>Hrymr (also Hrym or Rym) is a jötunn in Norse mythology. During the final battle of Ragnarök, Hrym will bring with him all the legions of the jötnar (giants) toward the field of Vígríðr to confront the Æsir (gods).

== Name ==
The etymology of the Old Norse name &quot;Hrym&quot; is unclear. Andy Orchard has proposed the meaning &#x27;decrepit&#x27;. Jan de Vries argues that a relation with &quot;hrumr&quot; (&#x27;weak, fragile&#x27;) is semantically questionable.

== Attestations ==
In &quot;Völuspá&quot; (Prophecy of the Völva), Hrym plays a major role in the apocalyptic events of Ragnarök.

In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; (The Beguiling of Gylfi), he is depicted as the captain of &quot;Naglfar&quot;, the ship that will ferry the enemies of the gods during Ragnarök, directly contradicting the version of &quot;Völuspá&quot; where it is the god Loki who will steer the ship.

<text>In Norse mythology, Hoddmímis holt (Old Norse &quot;Hoard-Mímir&#x27;s&quot; holt) is a location where Líf and Lífþrasir are foretold to survive the long winters of Fimbulvetr. Hoddmímis holt is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Like the very similarly named Mímameiðr, scholars generally consider &quot;Hoddmímis holt&quot; to be another name for Yggdrasil and connect it to folklore recorded from continental Germanic folklore.

==Attestations==
In the poem &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, collected in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, the god Odin poses a question to the jötunn Vafþrúðnir, asking who among mankind will survive when the winter Fimbulvetr occurs. Vafþrúðnir responds that they will be Líf and Lífþrasir, that the two will have hidden in the wood of Hoddmímis holt, they will consume the morning dew as food, and &quot;from them generations will spring.&quot;

In chapter 53 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, High tells Gangleri (king Gylfi in disguise) that two people, Líf and Lífþrasir, will lie hid in Hoddmímis holt during &quot;Surt&#x27;s fire,&quot; and that &quot;from these people there will be descended such a great progeny that the world will be inhabited.&quot; The above-mentioned stanza of &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot; is then quoted.

==Theories==
Connections have been proposed between the forest and Mímameiðr (&quot;Mímir&#x27;s tree&quot;), generally thought to refer to the world tree Yggdrasil, and Mímisbrunnr. Based on this association, all three have been theorized as either being the same entity, or as having been visualized within the same proximity. For example, Carolyne Larrington, who notes that it is nowhere expressly stated what will happen to the world tree Yggdrasil at Ragnarök, points to a connection between Mímir and Yggdrasil in the poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, and theorizes that &quot;it is possible that Hoddmimir is another name for Mimir, and that the two survivors hide in Yggdrasill.&quot;

Rudolf Simek theorizes that the survival of Líf and Lífþrasir is &quot;a case of reduplication of the anthropogeny, understandable from the cyclic nature of the Eddic eschatology.&quot; Simek says that Hoddmímis holt &quot;should not be understood literally as a wood or even a forest in which the two keep themselves hidden, but rather as an alternative name for the world-tree Yggdrasill. Thus, the creation of mankind from tree trunks (Askr, Embla) is repeated after the Ragnarǫk as well.&quot; Simek says that in Germanic regions, the concept of mankind originating from trees is ancient. Simek additionally points out legendary parallels in a Bavarian legend of a shepherd who lives inside a tree, whose descendants repopulate the land after life there has been wiped out by plague (citing a retelling by F. R. Schröder). In addition, Simek points to an Old Norse parallel in the figure of Örvar-Oddr, &quot;who is rejuvenated after living as a tree-man (&quot;Ǫrvar-Odds saga&quot; 24–27).&quot;
