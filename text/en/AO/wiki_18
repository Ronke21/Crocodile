<text>}}

The Tlatelolco massacre () was a military massacre committed by the Mexican Armed Forces against the students of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN), and other universities in Mexico.

The massacre followed a series of large demonstrations called the Mexican Movement of 1968 and is considered part of the Mexican Dirty War, when the U.S.-backed Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) government violently repressed political and social opposition. The event occurred ten days before the opening ceremony of the 1968 Summer Olympics, which were carried out normally.

On October 2, 1968 in the Tlatelolco section of Mexico City, the Mexican Armed Forces opened fire on a group of unarmed civilians in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas who were protesting the upcoming Olympics. The Mexican government and media claimed that the Armed Forces had been provoked by protesters shooting at them, but government documents made public since 2000 suggest that snipers had been employed by the government. 

The number of deaths resulting from the event is disputed. According to U.S. national security archives, American analyst Kate Doyle documented the deaths of 44 people; however, estimates of the actual death toll range from 300 to 400, with eyewitnesses reporting hundreds dead. Additionally, the head of the Federal Directorate of Security reported that 1,345 people were arrested.

==Background==

Mexican President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz struggled to maintain public order during a time of rising social tensions but suppressed movements by labor unions and farmers fighting to improve their lot. His administration suppressed independent labor unions and farmers and heavy-handedly tried to direct the economy. In 1958, under the previous administration of Adolfo López Mateos (when Díaz Ordaz was Minister of the Interior), labor leader Demetrio Vallejo was arrested and peasant activist Rubén Jaramillo was murdered.

Arising from reaction to the government&#x27;s violent repression of a July 1968 fight between rival &quot;porros&quot; (gangs), the student movement in Mexico City quickly grew to include large segments of the university students who were dissatisfied with the regime of the PRI, most especially at the Autonomous National University of Mexico (UNAM) and the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) but also at other universities. After a fight by rival student groups in central Mexico City was broken up violently by a large contingent of police, university students formed a National Strike Council (CNH) to organize protests and present demands to the government. Large-scale protests grew in size over the summer as the opening of the Olympic Games in mid October grew nearer, and Minister of the Interior Luis Echeverría needed to keep public order. On October 2, 1968, a large peaceful march arrived at the Plaza of the Three Cultures for the usual speeches. However, the Díaz Ordaz government and troops marched into the plaza and gunmen in surrounding buildings opened fire on the unarmed civilians in what is now known as the Tlatelolco massacre.

==Assault and massacre==
On October 2, 1968, around 10,000 university and high school students gathered in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas to protest the government&#x27;s actions and listen peacefully to speeches. Many men and women not associated with the CNH gathered in the plaza to watch and listen; they included neighbors from the Residential complex, bystanders and children. The students had congregated outside the Chihuahua Building, a three-moduled thirteen-story apartment complex in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas. Among their chants were &quot;¡No queremos olimpiadas, queremos revolución!&quot; (&quot;We don&#x27;t want Olympics, we want revolution!&quot;). Rally organizers did not try to call off the protest when they noticed an increased military presence in the area.
Two helicopters, one from the police and another from the army, flew over the plaza. Around 5:55 P.M. red flares were shot from the nearby S.R.E. (Mexican Ministry of Foreign Relations) tower. Around 6:15 P.M. another two flares were shot, this time from a helicopter (one was green and another one was red) as 5,000 soldiers, 200 tankettes and trucks surrounded the plaza. Much of what proceeded after the first shots were fired in the plaza remained ill-defined for decades after 1968. Records and information released by American and Mexican government sources since 2000 have enabled researchers to study the events and draw new conclusions.

The question of who fired first remained unresolved years after the massacre. The Mexican government said gunfire from the surrounding apartments prompted the army&#x27;s attack. But the students said that the helicopters appeared to signal the army to fire into the crowd. Journalist Elena Poniatowska culled interviews from those present and described events in her book &quot;Massacre in Mexico&quot;: &quot;Flares suddenly appeared in the sky overhead and everyone automatically looked up. The first shots were heard then. The crowd panicked [and] started running in all directions.&quot; Despite CNH efforts to restore order, the crowd on the plaza quickly fell into chaos.

Shortly thereafter, the Olympia Battalion, a secret government branch made for the security of the Olympic Games composed of soldiers, police officers, and federal security agents, were ordered to arrest the leaders of the CNH and advanced into the plaza. The Olympia Battalion members wore white gloves or white handkerchiefs tied to their left hands to distinguish themselves from the civilians and prevent the soldiers from shooting them. Captain Ernesto Morales Soto stated that &quot;immediately upon sighting a flare in the sky, the prearranged signal, we were to seal off the aforementioned two entrances and prevent anyone from entering or leaving.&quot;

The ensuing assault into the plaza left dozens dead and many more wounded in its aftermath. The soldiers responded by firing into the nearby buildings and into the crowd, hitting not only the protesters, but also watchers and bystanders. Demonstrators and passersby alike, including students, journalists (one of which was Italian reporter Oriana Fallaci), and children, were hit by bullets, and mounds of bodies soon lay on the ground. Meanwhile, on the Chihuahua building, where the speakers stood, Olympia Battalion members pushed people and ordered them to lie on the ground near the elevator walls. People claim these men were the people who shot first at the soldiers and the crowd.

Video evidence also points out that at least two companies of the Olympia Battalion hid themselves in the nearby apartment buildings and set up a machine gun in an apartment in the Molino del Rey Building, where a sister-in-law of then-Secretary of State Luis Echeverría lived. In addition, many snipers were positioned on the roof of the church of Santiago de Tlatelolco and many people involved, including the ones who fired the first two flares, were present at the nearby convent and the Foreign Relations Tower; there was a machine gun on the 19th floor and a video camera on the 17th floor. Video evidence shows 10 white-gloved men leaving the church and bumping into soldiers, who point their weapons at them. One of the men shows what appears to be an ID and they are let go.

By the next morning, newspapers reported that 20 to 28 people had been killed, hundreds wounded, and hundreds more arrested. &quot;El Día&quot;″s morning headline on October 3, 1968, read: &quot;Criminal Provocation at the Tlatelolco Meeting Causes Terrible Bloodshed.&quot; A 2001 investigation revealed documents showing that the snipers were members of the Presidential Guard, who were instructed to fire on the military forces in order to provoke them.

==Investigation and aftermath==
In 1977, seven years after the end of his presidency, Gustavo Díaz Ordaz was appointed ambassador to Spain by then-President José López Portillo. His appointment revived the debate over his responsibility regarding the Tlatelolco massacre, to which Díaz Ordaz responded by firmly defending his handling of the incident; in an interview on 13 April 1977, shortly before leaving for Spain, a journalist told the former president that his appointment as ambassador &quot;touched a sore spot&quot;, to which an upset Díaz Ordaz replied:

In 1998, President Ernesto Zedillo, on the 30th anniversary of the Tlatelolco massacre, authorized a congressional investigation into the events of October 2. However, the PRI government continued its recalcitrance and did not release official government documents pertaining to the incident. In a 2002 &quot;All Things Considered&quot; radio interview with Kate Doyle, director of the Mexican Documentation Project for the US National Security Archive, she described the PRI government&#x27;s investigations: &quot;I mean, there have been a number of investigations throughout the years. In fact, former president Miguel de la Madrid was interviewed yesterday in the press, and said that he had asked the military and the interior secretary for documents and for photographs of the demonstrations, and was subjected to tremendous political pressure not to investigate. And when he continued to press, the military and the interior ministry claimed that their files were in disarray and they had nothing.&quot;
Enduring questions remained after &quot;La Noche Triste&quot; (the Sad Night) that have taken the Mexican government over 30 years to answer. Eventually in 2001, President Vicente Fox, the president who ended the 70-year reign of the PRI, attempted to resolve the question of who had orchestrated the massacre. President Fox ordered the release of previously classified documents concerning the 1968 massacre. The documents revealed that Elena Poniatowska&#x27;s synthesis of the events that October night was accurate, as Kate Doyle uncovered, Thousands of students gathered in the square and, as you say, the government version is that the students opened fire. Well, there&#x27;s been pretty clear evidence now that there was a unit that was called the &quot;Brigada Olímpica&quot;, or the Olympic Brigade, that was made up of special forces of the presidential guard, who opened fire from the buildings that surrounded the square, and that that was the thing that provoked the massacre.

President Fox also appointed Ignacio Carrillo Prieto in 2002 to prosecute those responsible for ordering the massacre. In 2006, former President Luis Echeverría was arrested on charges of genocide. However, in March 2009, after a convoluted appeal process, the genocide charges against Echeverria were dismissed. The Mexican newspaper &quot;The News&quot; reported that &quot;a tribunal of three circuit court judges ruled that there was not enough proof to link Echeverria to the violent suppression of hundreds of protesting students on Oct. 2, 1968.&quot; Despite the ruling, prosecutor Carrillo Prieto said he would continue his investigation and seek charges against Echeverria before the United Nations International Court of Justice and the Inter-American Human Rights Commission.

== United States government records ==

In October 2003, the role of the United States government in the massacre was publicized when the National Security Archive at George Washington University published a series of records from the CIA, the Pentagon, the State Department, the FBI and the White House which were released in response to Freedom of Information Act requests.

The documents detail: 
* That in response to Mexican government concerns over the security of the Olympic Games, the Pentagon sent military radios, weapons, ammunition and riot control training material to Mexico before and during the crisis.
* That the CIA station in Mexico City produced almost daily reports concerning developments within the university community and the Mexican government from July to October. Six days before the massacre at Tlatelolco, both Echeverría and head of Federal Security (DFS) Fernando Gutiérrez Barrios told the CIA that &quot;the situation will be under complete control very shortly&quot;.
* That the Díaz Ordaz government &quot;arranged&quot; to have student leader Sócrates Campos Lemus accuse dissident PRI politicians such as Carlos Madrazo of funding and orchestrating the student movement.

== Remembrance ==
In 1993, in remembrance of the 25th anniversary of the events, a stele was dedicated with the names of a few of the students and persons who lost their lives during the event. The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation has a mural commemorating the massacre.

During June 2006, days before the controversial presidential election of 2006, 84-year-old Echeverría was charged with genocide in connection with the massacre. He was placed under house arrest pending trial. In early July of that year (after the presidential elections), he was cleared of genocide charges, as the judge found that Echeverría could not be put on trial because the statute of limitations had expired.

In December 2008 the Mexican Senate named October 2 starting in 2009 as a National Day of Mourning; the initiative had already passed the Deputies&#x27; Chamber of Congress.

Alejandro Encinas, undersecretary of Human Rights, Population, and Migration, said on October 2, 2020 that the federal government would remove the names of &quot;repressors&quot; involved in the 1968 student movement and &quot;El Halconazo&quot; of 1971 from public places. He specifically proposed that the Licenciado Gustavo Díaz Ordaz International Airport in Puerto Vallarta should be renamed. He also promised that 8,000 boxes of archives, including those in possession of the military, would be digitalized and made public.

On 2 October 2024, President Claudia Sheinbaum, whose mother was dismissed from her job as a professor for denouncing the massacre, issued an official apology for the incident. 

===40th anniversary march===
On October 2, 2008, two marches were held in Mexico City to commemorate the event. One traveled from Escuela Normal Superior de Maestros (Teacher&#x27;s College) to the Zocalo. The other went from the Instituto Politécnico Nacional to the massacre site of the Plaza de las Tres Culturas. According to the &quot;Comité del 68&quot; (68 Committee), one of the organizers of the event, 40,000 marchers were in attendance.
==Media portrayals==
In 1969, Mexican rock band Pop Music Team, launched the single &quot;Tlatelolco&quot; but was heavily censored by the government after a few days of airplay.

The &#x27;Cinéma vérité documentary film &quot;El Grito, México 1968&quot; directed by Leobardo López Aretche captures the events surrounding the protest and massacre.

&quot;Rojo Amanecer&quot; (1989), directed by Jorge Fons, is a Spanish-language film about the event. It focuses on the day of a middle-class family living in one of the apartment buildings surrounding the Plaza de Tlatelolco and is based on testimonials from witnesses and victims. It starred Héctor Bonilla, María Rojo, the Bichir Brothers, Eduardo Palomo and others.

Alejandro Jodorowsky dramatized the massacre in &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; (1973), with birds, fruits, vegetables, liquids and other things falling and being ripped out of the wounds of the dying students.

Richard Dindo, a documentary filmmaker, made &quot;Ni olvido, ni perdón&quot; (2004), which includes contemporary interviews with witnesses and participants as well as footage from the time.

A feature film, &quot;Tlatelolco, verano del &#x27;68&quot;, was released in Mexico, November 2012, written and directed by Carlos Bolado.

Roberto Bolaño released &quot;Amulet&quot;, a Spanish-language novel, in 1999, recounting the massacre from the point of view of a woman named Auxilio, based on the true story of Alcira Soust Scaffo. Auxilio was caught in the university bathroom at the time of the police ambush. She tells her story also in his later novel &quot;The Savage Detectives&quot;.

&quot;Borrar de la Memoria&quot;, a movie about a journalist who investigates a girl who was killed in July 1968, lightly touches the massacre, which is filmed by Roberto Rentería, a C.U.E.C. student who was making a documentary about said girl, known popularly as &quot;La empaquetada&quot; (&quot;the packaged [girl]&quot;) for the way her dismembered body was found inside a box.

&quot;Los Parecidos&quot;, a 2015 film, also takes place at the date, references Tlatelolco heavily and portrays the conflict between students and the government.

&quot;Jarhdin&quot;, a song by Mexican artist Maya Ghazal, features a two-minute audio sample recorded during the shooting at the Plaza de las Tres Culturas.

In season 1 episode 2 of Netflix TV series &quot;Narcos&quot;, it briefly explains the role of the Mexican Government FDS and short video of the Mexican Army storming the Plaza de las Tres Culturas.

The 2018 TV series An Unknown Enemy focuses on the same subject, from the perspective of an Intelligence agency.

Episodes 1 and 2 of the Netflix documentary series &quot;Break It All&quot; feature the massacre and its impact on contemporary Latin American rock and roll.

==Tlatelolco in the arts==

The 1968 massacre has been referenced in the arts and pop culture in various ways. For example, in literary works such as &quot;La Noche de Tlatelolco&quot; (1971) by Elena Poniatowska which collected interviews, chants, slogans, and banners from student movement survivors. Tlatelolco movement veterans like Carlos Monsiváis, José Emilio Pacheco, Octavio Paz, and Jaime Sabines have written poems on the massacre and films like Jorge Fons&#x27;s &quot;Rojo Amanecer&quot; (1990) have kept the memory alive. American composer John Adams set Rosario Castellanos&#x27; poem on the massacre at Tlatelolco in his oratorio El Niño (2000). Tlatelolco has marked the history of massacres and national injustice in Mexico in other historical ways which have permeated the arts such as it being a place of Aztec sacrificial performances, being the place where the Aztecs surrendered to the Spanish, and giving way to legitimizing the genocide of indigenous people in Mexico.

<text>The states and territories included in the United States Census Bureau&#x27;s statistics for the United States population, ethnicity, and most other categories include the 50 states and Washington, D.C. Separate statistics are maintained for the five permanently inhabited territories of the United States: Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

As of April 1, 2020, the date of the 2020 United States census, the nine most populous U.S. states contain slightly more than half of the total population. The 25 least populous states contain less than one-sixth of the total population. California, the most populous state, contains more people than the 21 least populous states combined, and Wyoming, the least populous state, has a population less than any of the 31 most populous U.S. cities.

==Method==
The United States Census counts the persons residing in the United States including citizens, non-citizen permanent residents and non-citizen long-term visitors. Civilian and military federal employees serving abroad and their dependents are counted in their home state.

==Electoral apportionment==
Every 10 years, the U.S. Census Bureau is charged with making an actual count of all residents by state and territory. The accuracy of this count is then tested after the fact, and sometimes statistically significant undercounts or overcounts occur. For example, for the 2020 decennial census, 14 states had significant miscounts ranging from 1.5% to 6.6%. While these adjustments may be reflected in government programs over the following decade, the 10-year representative apportionments discussed below are not changed to reflect the miscount.

=== House of Representatives ===
Based on this decennial census, each state is allocated a portion of the 435 fixed seats in the United States House of Representatives (until the early 20th century, the apportionment process generally increased the size of the House based on the results of the census until the size of the House was capped by the Reapportionment Act of 1929), with each state guaranteed at least one Representative. The allocation is based on each state&#x27;s proportion of the combined population of the fifty states (not including the District of Columbia, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or the United States Virgin Islands).

=== Electoral College ===
The Electoral College, every four years, elects the President and Vice President of the United States based on the popular vote in each state and the District of Columbia. Each state&#x27;s number of votes in the Electoral College is equal to its number of members in the Senate plus members in the House of Representatives.

The Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution additionally grants the District of Columbia (D.C.), which is not part of any state, as many Electoral College votes as it would have if it &quot;were&quot; a state, while having no more votes than the least populous state (currently, Wyoming). Since the U.S. Constitution guarantees every state at least one member of the U.S. House of Representatives and two members of the U.S. Senate, every state has at least three Electoral College votes. Thus, the Electoral College has 538 members (100 senators, plus 435 representatives due to the limit imposed by the Reapportionment Act of 1929, plus 3 members for the District of Columbia). Territories of the United States are not included in the Electoral College: people in those territories cannot vote directly for the President of the United States, although they may participate in the partisan nominating primaries and caucuses.

<doc id="87529" wikidata="Q327009" url="?curid=87529" title="Maurice Papon">
<text>Maurice Papon (; 3 September 1910 – 17 February 2007) was a French civil servant and Nazi collaborator who was convicted of crimes against humanity committed during the occupation of France. Papon led the police in major prefectures from the 1930s to the 1960s, before he became a Gaullist politician. When he was secretary general for the police in Bordeaux during World War II, he participated in the deportation of more than 1,600 Jews. He is also known for his activities in the Algerian War (1954–1962), during which he tortured insurgent prisoners as prefect of the Constantinois department, and ordered, as prefect of the Paris police, the 1961 massacre of pro-National Liberation Front (FLN) demonstrators for violating a curfew that he had &quot;advised&quot;.

In 1961, Maurice Papon was personally awarded the Legion of Honour by French President Charles de Gaulle, whose government had been struggling with the FLN insurgency. Papon also commanded the Paris police in the Charonne subway massacre and the Paris massacre of 1961, during which between 200 and 300 Algerian demonstrators were deliberately killed by the Paris police. Forced to resign in 1967 after the suspicious forced disappearance of the Moroccan Marxist Mehdi Ben Barka, with de Gaulle&#x27;s support he was named as president of Sud Aviation, the company which co-developed Concorde.

After May 1968, Papon was elected as a member of the French National Assembly and served several terms. From 1978 to 1981, he served in the cabinet of Prime Minister Raymond Barre under President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. Between the two rounds of the May 1981 presidential election, where Giscard d&#x27;Estaing was running for a second term, details about Papon&#x27;s past were leaked in newspaper. Documents signed by Papon were made public that showed his responsibility in the deportation of 1,690 Bordeaux Jews to Drancy internment camp from 1942–44. After a long investigation and protracted legal wranglings, he was eventually tried.

In 1998, Papon was convicted of crimes against humanity. He was released from prison early, in 2002, for ill health. He died in 2007.

==Early life==

Papon was born in Gretz-Armainvilliers, Seine-et-Marne, the son of a solicitor who became an industrialist. In 1919, when Papon was nine years old, his father was elected mayor in the &quot;commune&quot; and held that office until 1937. His father was also local representative (&quot;conseiller général&quot;) of Tournan-en-Brie and president of the canton&#x27;s council in 1937.

Papon studied at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, in Paris. Fellow students at the elite school were Georges Pompidou, later President of France, and René Brouillet, who would join Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s cabinet after the war. Papon entered Sciences-Po, the specialty university for future civil servants and politicians, and he studied law, psychology and sociology.

==Early career==
After entering public service at the age of 20, Papon was quickly promoted. During the second &quot;Cartel des gauches&quot;, in February 1931, he worked in the cabinet of the Minister of Air, Jean-Louis Dumesnil. He was named in the Ministry of Interior in July 1935 before he became chief of staff of the deputy director of departmental and communal affairs, in January 1936, under Maurice Sabatier.

In June 1936, during the Popular Front government, he was attached to the cabinet of Radical-Socialist François de Tessan, the vice-state secretary to the presidency of the council as well as a friend of his father. He became a member of the &quot;Ligue d&#x27;action universitaire républicaine et socialiste&quot;, a Radical-Socialist youth group; Pierre Mendès France was also a member.

==World War II==
Mobilised on 26 August 1939 in the 2nd colonial infantry regiment, Papon was sent to Tripoli, French Lebanon. He was assigned to direct the French secret services in Ras-el-Aïn, in the north of French Syria. Following the fall of France, he was demobilized and returned to France by October 1940. Papon opted to serve the Vichy government, his mentors, Jean-Louis Dumesnil and Maurice Sabatier, having voted on 10 July 1940 to grant all power to Philippe Pétain.

Papon was appointed as the vice-chief of bureau to the central administration of the Ministry of Interior, before he was named, in February 1941, as vice-prefect, 1st class. The next month, he became Maurice Sabatier&#x27;s general secretary and general secretary of the administration for the Interior Minister. While Papon chose Vichy, 94 civil servants were dismissed at the end of the spring of 1941, 104 pensioned off and 79 moved. Now, as &quot;Le Monde&quot; put it in 2002, &quot;neutrality is no longer an option.&quot;

In May 1942, his chief, Sabatier, was named prefect of Aquitaine by Pierre Laval, the head of the Vichy government. Papon was appointed as general secretary of the prefecture of Gironde in charge of Jewish Affairs.

Papon later claimed he had Gaullist tendencies during the war. A confidential report from the Nazis at the time shows that in April 1943, he identified himself as a &quot;collaborationist&quot; during &quot;personal or official conversations.&quot; Another document from July 1943 called him a &quot;good negotiator.&quot;

During World War II, Papon served as a senior police official in the Vichy régime. He was the second official in the Bordeaux region (the secretary-general of the prefecture of Gironde) and the supervisor of its Service for Jewish Questions. With authority over Jewish affairs, Papon regularly collaborated with Nazi Germany&#x27;s SS, which was responsible for the extermination of Jews. Under his command, about 1,560 Jews were deported. Most were sent directly to the camp of Mérignac and then they were transported to Drancy internment camp, near Paris, and finally to Auschwitz or other concentration camps for extermination.

From July 1942 to August 1944, 12 trains left Bordeaux for Drancy; about 1,600 Jews, including 130 children under 13, were deported; few survived. Papon also implemented the anti-Semitic laws voted by the Vichy government. By July 1942, he had &quot;dejudaised&quot; 204 companies, sold 64 land properties owned by Jewish people and was in the process of &quot;dejudaising&quot; 493 other businesses.

==Rehabilitation under the Fourth Republic==

Some &quot;résistants&quot; questioned his activities, but Papon avoided being judged by the Comité départemental de libération (CDL) of Bordeaux for his role during Vichy, as he was protected by Gaston Cusin. He presented a certificate attesting that he had taken part in the Resistance, although its authenticity was later rejected.

The CDL were in charge of the &quot;épuration&quot;, the pursuit of collaborators. During the Liberation of France, the Resistance in Bordeaux was very weak. It lacked members because of internal dissensions and German repression. Maurice Sabatier, Papon&#x27;s mentor and chief, was accused by the CDL of having &quot;boasted&quot; that his prefecture was one of the most efficient concerning the &quot;percentage&quot; of &quot;deportations.&quot; He was sentenced only to a suspension of several months during which he was paid half his salary. In 1948, he was awarded the Legion of Honour for general wartime service.

Papon became chief of staff of the &quot;commissaire de la République&quot;, a high civil servant that replaced Vichy&#x27;s prefects. He effectively retained the same functions as during the war. Charles de Gaulle and others &quot;perfectly knew his past,&quot; according to Olivier Guichard. De Gaulle had received him personally after the liberation of Bordeaux in September 1944.

Papon was first named prefect of the Landes department in August 1944 and then chief of staff of the commissaire of the Republic of Aquitaine, under Gaston Cusin. When Cusin left Bordeaux, his successor, Jacques Soustelle, a Gaullist Résistant, confirmed Papon into his functions. A few months later, Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury also confirmed him there.

In October 1945, Papon was appointed as vice-director of Algeria at the Minister of Interior. A year later, he became secretary of state to the Ministry of Interior Jean Biondi of the socialist French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO). Eric Roussel, a De Gaulle biographer, wrote that to the general and president, who was concerned with the survival of the Republic against undemocratic movements:&quot;the authority of the state is so sacred, the danger constituted by the communists so intolerable, that he is disposed to accept without too many problems of conscience men who may have, for a fairly long time, worked on behalf of Vichy.&quot;

Papon was named prefect of Corsica in January 1947 by Léon Blum&#x27;s government and, in October 1949, prefect of Constantine in Algeria by Radical Henri Queuille&#x27;s government (with SFIO member Jules Moch at the Interior). He went to Morocco in 1954 as general secretary of the protectorate, where he helped repress Moroccan nationalists. He returned to Constantine in 1956 during the Algerian War (1954–1962), where he actively participated in the repression, including the use of torture against the civilian population.

==Prefect of Police of Paris==

In March 1958, Papon was appointed Prefect of Police for Paris by the government of Radical Félix Gaillard.

===May 1958 crisis===
Papon thus had an important role in the May 1958 crisis, which brought de Gaulle to power and led to the founding of the Fifth Republic. He took part in the secret Gaullist meetings that assured the use of the crisis to prepare de Gaulle&#x27;s nomination as President of the council and to grant him special powers. On 3 July 1958, he managed to get what, according to &quot;Le Monde&quot;, he could &quot;never have dreamed of&quot; a &quot;Carte d&#x27;Ancien Combattant de la Resistance&quot;. On 12 July 1961, President de Gaulle bestowed on him the French Legion of Honour for service to the state.

===October 1961 massacre===

Papon oversaw the repression during the Paris massacre of 1961: on 17 October 1961, a large peaceful march, organised by the Algerian National Liberation Front, broke a curfew that had been &quot;advised&quot; by Papon because of ostensible &quot;concerns&quot; on the group&#x27;s sponsoring of a series of bombings throughout France. The police arrested 11,000 persons, who claimed that it was simply because of their appearance.

They were mostly people from the Maghreb but also included Spanish, Portuguese and Italians. They were sent, in a tragic echo of the Vichy regime, on public buses to the Parc des Expositions, the Vélodrome d&#x27;Hiver and other such centres that had been used under Vichy as internment centers. A massacre occurred in the courtyards of the Prefecture of Police, and the detainees were held without specific charges. In the following days at the Parc des Expositions, detainees were subject to inhumane treatments. Arrests continued throughout October 1961. Meanwhile, bodies were found floating in the Seine River.

Up to 200 people were killed during the events, according to a prominent historian, Jean-Luc Einaudi. Because some archives have been destroyed and others remain classified, the exact number of the dead remains unknown. At the time, the French government, headed by de Gaulle, with Roger Frey as Interior Minister, admitted only two of the dead. A government inquiry in 1999 concluded 48 drownings on the one night and 142 similar deaths of Algerians in the weeks before and after, 110 of whom were found in the Seine. It also concluded the true toll was almost certainly higher. According to &quot;Le Monde&quot;, Papon &quot;organized the silence.&quot; It was only in the 1990s that historians began to speak out. The French government reluctantly recognized 48 deaths, but the Paris Archives, consulted by historian David Assouline, note 70 persons dead. Papon never acknowledged responsibility for that massacre.

===February 1962 massacre===
Papon was also in charge during the 8 February 1962 demonstration against the OAS&#x27;s violent campaign for &quot;French Algeria.&quot; Organised by the French Communist Party (PCF), the demonstration had been banned by the state. Nine members of the Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT) trade union, most of them communists, were killed at Charonne métro station by the police, directed by Papon under the same government. The funerals on 13 February 1962 of the nine individuals killed (one being Fanny Dewerpe) were attended by hundreds of thousands of people.

On 8 February 2007, the Place du 8 Février 1962, a square near the metro station, was dedicated by Bertrand Delanoë, the mayor of Paris, after bouquets of flowers were deposited at the foot of a commemorative plaque installed inside the metro station in which the killings occurred.

===Ben Barka affair===
Papon was forced to leave his functions after the October 1965 kidnapping, in Paris, of Mehdi Ben Barka, a Moroccan dissident and leader of the Tricontinental Conference, in October 1965. Two French police agents and French secret agents participated in the forced disappearance that was at least ordered by Moroccan Interior Minister Mohamed Oufkir. It is still an unsolved case, involving various international intelligence agencies.

De Gaulle was forced to ask for Papon&#x27;s resignation in early 1967; Papon&#x27;s successor was Maurice Grimaud.

==Company president and government minister==

De Gaulle helped Papon become president of the company Sud Aviation (1967–1968). The firm, which later merged into &quot;Aérospatiale&quot;, built the first Concorde plane in 1969. During May 1968, he wrote: &quot;Is it the return of the Occupation? The young German anarchist [Daniel] Cohn-Bendit is freely arranging the riots.&quot; The new chief of the Paris police managed to take care of the situation without a single death.

Papon was elected deputy of Cher as candidate of the Gaullist Union of Democrats for the Republic (UDR) in May 1968. He was re-elected in 1973 and again in 1978, now for the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR). He was elected mayor of Saint-Amand-Montrond in 1971 and 1977. Papon was director of the &quot;Verreries mécaniques champenoises&quot;, a glass art firm in Reims.

On the evening of 4–5 June 1977, a commando shot at workers on strike, killing CGT trade-unionist Pierre Maître and severely injuring two others. Four of the five members of the commando, members of the CGT were arrested by the police. The leader of the commando and shooter, who received a 20-year sentence, and the driver were members of the Service d&#x27;Action Civique.

From 1968 to 1971, Papon was treasurer of the UDR. He became President of the Finance Commission of the National Assembly in 1972 and was the deputy presenting the budget (&quot;rapporteur général du budget&quot;) from 1973 to 1978. He served as Budget Minister under Prime Minister Raymond Barre and President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing from 1978 to 1981, before finishing his mayoral term in 1983 and renouncing further political activity.

==Trial, prison and release==

Evidence of his responsibility in the Holocaust emerged in 1981 and throughout rest of the 1980s, he fought a string of legal battles.

===The &quot;Canard enchaîné&quot; leaks===

On 6 May 1981, &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot; newspaper published an article, &quot;Papon, aide de camps. Quand un ministre de Giscard faisait déporter des juifs&quot; (&quot;Papon, aide of camps: When one of Giscard&#x27;s ministers deported the Jews&quot;). It also made public several documents that had been signed by Papon and showed his responsibility in the deportation of 1,690 Jews of Bordeaux to Drancy from 1942–44. The documents had been provided to the newspaper by one of the survivors of Papon&#x27;s raid, Michel Slitinsky (1925–2012). Slitinsky had received them from historian Michel Bergés, who had discovered them in February 1981 in the department&#x27;s archives. The publication of the 6 May article occurred four days before the second round of the presidential election, opposing candidate François Mitterrand, who would win the race, and incumbent president Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing under whom Papon was a cabinet minister.

===Legal battles===
Noted Nazi hunters Serge and Beate Klarsfeld helped bring him to trial, where Serge and his son, Arno, represented the families of the victims. Other important collaborators, such as René Bousquet, head of the French police under Vichy, did not go to trial. Bousquet himself would be assassinated in 1993, shortly before his trial was to start. His adjunct, Jean Leguay, died of cancer in 1989 before he could go on trial, a decade after he had been indicted for crimes against humanity for his role in the Vel&#x27; d&#x27;Hiv Roundup in July 1942. In 1995, President Chirac recognized the French state&#x27;s complicity in the roundup.

Papon had begun writing his memoirs before his death; he criticised Chirac&#x27;s official recognition of the involvement of the French state in the Holocaust.

Charges of crimes against humanity, complicity of assassination and abuse of authority were first brought against Papon in January 1983. Three months later, Papon sued the families of the victims for defamation but eventually lost. The slow investigation was cancelled in 1987 because of legal technicalities (such as a mistake by the investigating magistrate). New charges were laid in 1988, in October 1990 and in June 1992. The investigation was finished in July 1995.

In December 1995, Papon was sent to the &quot;Cour d&#x27;Assises&quot; and was accused of organising four deportation trains (later increased to eight trains). The French press contrasted Papon, the Bordeaux official who was &quot;just following orders&quot; in the commission of murder, to Aristides de Sousa Mendes, the Portuguese Consul in Bordeaux at the time, who defied his government&#x27;s orders and saved lives.

===The trial===
Papon finally went to trial on 8 October 1997, after 14 years of bitter legal wrangling. The trial was the longest in French history and went on until 2 April 1998. Papon was accused of ordering the arrest and deportation of 1,560 Jews, some children or elderly, between 1942 and 1944.

As in Adolf Eichmann&#x27;s trial 30 years earlier, one of the issues of the trial was to determine to what extent an individual should be held culpable in a chain of responsibility. Papon&#x27;s lawyers argued that he was a mid-level official, not the person making decisions about whom to deport. His lawyers argued that he had done the most good he could in the circumstances and had ensured that those to be deported were treated well while in his custody. The prosecution argued that the defence of following orders was not sufficient and that he bore at least some of the responsibility for the deportations. Calling on assistance from the best historians of the period, they dismantled his arguments of having tried to &quot;humanise&quot; the conditions of deportations of the Jews.

While Papon claimed that he had worked to grant humane conditions of transport to the Camp of Mérignac, historians testified that his concerns were motivated by efficiency. Although Papon claimed that he had used ordinary trains and not livestock trains, as had been used by the SNCF in numerous other transfers, the historians asserted that he was trying to prevent any demonstration of sympathy toward the Jews from the local population.

Leading historians of the period who testified as experts during the trial included Jean-Pierre Azéma, Henry Rousso, Maurice Rajsfus, René Rémond, Henri Amouroux and American historian Robert Paxton. The defence tried to exclude Paxton&#x27;s testimony by claiming the international and national context was irrelevant, but the magistrate dismissed that argument and said that &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; necessarily imply a larger context.

Paxton, an expert in Vichy history, dismissed the &quot;preconceived ideas&quot; according to which Vichy had &quot;hoped to protect French Jews&quot; by handing &quot;foreign Jews&quot; over to the Germans: &quot;From the start, at the summit, it was known that their departure [of the French Jews] was unavoidable... Italians had protected the Jews. And the French authorities complained about it to the Germans... The French state, itself, has participated in the politics of extermination of the Jews.&quot; In his 36-minute final speech to the jury, Papon rarely evoked those killed during the Holocaust. He portrayed himself as a victim of &quot;the saddest chapter in French legal history.&quot; He denounced a &quot;Moscow Trial&quot; and compared his status to that of the Jew Alfred Dreyfus in the 19th century.

===Verdict, appeals and escape===
Having proved that Papon had organized eight &quot;death trains,&quot; the plaintiffs&#x27; lawyers recommended a 20-year prison term, as opposed to life imprisonment, which is usually the norm for such crimes. Papon was convicted in 1998 as having been complicit with the Nazis in crimes against humanity. He was given a ten-year sentence but served less than three years. His lawyers filed an appeal in the Court of Cassation, but Papon fled to Switzerland under the name of Robert de La Rochefoucauld, in violation of a French law that requires one to report to prison before the beginning of the appeal hearing. He was recaptured in 1999, but was required to serve little time because of his advanced age and medical problems.

The real Robert de La Rochefoucauld, a hero of the French Resistance who maintained that Papon had worked with the Resistance, had given Papon his passport to enable him to escape. Papon&#x27;s appeal, scheduled for 21 October 1999, was automatically denied by the Court because of his flight.

===Prison and release===
France issued an international arrest warrant, and Papon was quickly apprehended by the Swiss police and extradited. On 22 October 1999, Papon began serving his sentence at La Santé Prison in Paris.

Papon applied for release on the grounds of poor health in March 2000, but President Jacques Chirac denied the petition three times. Papon continued to fight legal battles while he was in prison. His lawyers appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, where they argued that the French court&#x27;s denial of his appeal on a technicality, rather than on the merits of the case, constituted a violation of Papon&#x27;s right to appeal his conviction. The Court agreed in July 2002, admonishing the Court of Cassation and awarding Papon 429,192 French francs (about 65,400 euros) in legal costs but no damages.

Meanwhile, Papon&#x27;s lawyers pursued a separate action in France and petitioned for his release under the terms of a March 2002 law, which provided for the release of ill and elderly prisoners to receive outside medical care. His doctors affirmed that Papon, now 92 years old, was essentially incapacitated. He became the second person released under the terms of the law and left jail on 18 September 2002, less than three years into his sentence. Former Justice Minister Robert Badinter expressed support for the release, prompting indignation from relatives of the victims as well as Arno and Serge Klarsfeld.

Relatives of Papon&#x27;s victims and human rights nongovernmental organisations pointed out that many other detainees did not benefit from that law (including detainees in the terminal stages of AIDS as well as Nathalie Ménigon, a member of &quot;Action Directe&quot; who was still imprisoned despite suffering from partial hemiplegia).

The &quot;Ligue des droits de l&#x27;homme&quot; (LDH, Human Rights League) criticised the inequality before the law, as Papon was freed but not other prisoners.

==Later life and funeral==
In March 2004, the chancery of the Legion of Honour accused Papon of illegally wearing his decoration, which had been stripped of him after his conviction, while he was being photographed for a press interview for &quot;Le Point&quot;. He was tried and fined €2,500. In February 2007, Papon had heart surgery for congestive heart failure. While the surgery was initially thought to be successful, he died a few days later on 17 February, at the age of 96.

His attorney, Francis Vuillemin, declared that Papon should be buried with insignia of Commander of the Legion of Honour. That triggered public expressions of indignation from all French political parties except Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s far-right National Front.

Bernard Accoyer, head of the Union for a Popular Movement group in the French National Assembly, suggested that as the high chancellor of the Order of the Legion of Honour, Chirac might personally intervene to prevent that, but Chirac did not do so. Papon was buried, with the insignia, on 21 February 2007. A son of one of Papon&#x27;s victims observed of Papon, &quot;Besides being a remorseless dead man, he also wishes to remain a vengeful one.&quot;

After his death, The &quot;Irish Independent&quot; wrote in an article: &#x27;Have no doubt Hitler would have wiped out Arabs after Jews&#x27;:Maurice Papon, lowered into his grave along with his precious Legion d&#x27;honneur last week, proved what many Arabs have long suspected but generally refuse to acknowledge: that bureaucrats and racists and others who worked for Hitler regarded all Semitic people as their enemies and that – had Hitler&#x27;s armies reached the Middle East – they would ultimately have found a &quot;final solution&quot; to the &quot;Arab question,&quot; just as they did for the Jews of Europe. Papon&#x27;s responsibility for the 1942 arrest and deportation of 1,600 Jews in and around Bordeaux – 223 children among them, all shipped off to the Drancy camp and then to Auschwitz – was proved without the proverbial shadow of a doubt at his 1998 trial. Less clear were the exact number of Algerians murdered by his police force in Paris and hurled into the Seine in 1961.

<text>Ray Charles Leonard (born May 17, 1956), best known as Sugar Ray Leonard, is an American former professional boxer, motivational speaker, and actor. Often regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, he competed professionally between 1977 and 1997, winning world titles in five weight classes; the lineal championship in three weight classes; as well as the undisputed welterweight championship. Leonard was part of the &quot;Four Kings&quot;, a group of boxers who all fought each other throughout the 1980s, consisting of Leonard, Roberto Durán, Thomas Hearns, and Marvin Hagler. As an amateur, Leonard won a light welterweight gold medal at the 1976 Summer Olympics.

The &quot;Four Kings&quot; created a wave of popularity in the lower weight classes that kept boxing relevant in the post-Muhammad Ali era, during which Leonard defeated future fellow International Boxing Hall of Fame inductees Hearns, Durán, Hagler, and Wilfred Benítez. Leonard was also the first boxer to earn more than $100 million in purses, and was named &quot;Boxer of the Decade&quot; in the 1980s. &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine named him Fighter of the Year in 1979 and 1981, while the Boxing Writers Association of America named him Fighter of the Year in 1976, 1979, and 1981. In 2002, Leonard was voted by &quot;The Ring&quot; as the ninth greatest fighter of the last 80 years. In 2016, he was voted by &quot;The Ring&quot; to be the greatest living fighter. BoxRec ranks him as the 14th greatest boxer of all time, pound for pound.

==Early life==
Leonard, the fifth of seven children of Cicero and Getha Leonard, was born in Wilmington, North Carolina. He was named after Ray Charles, his mother&#x27;s favorite singer. The family moved to Washington, D.C., when he was three, and they settled permanently in Palmer Park, Maryland when he was ten. His father worked as a supermarket night manager and his mother was a nurse. He attended Parkdale High School. Leonard was a shy child, and aside from the time he nearly drowned in a creek during a flood in Seat Pleasant, Maryland, his childhood was uneventful. He stayed home a lot, reading comic books and playing with his dog. His mother said: &quot;He never did talk too much. We never could tell what he was thinking. But I never had any problems with him. I never had to go to school once because of him.&quot;

==Amateur career==
Leonard started boxing at the Palmer Park Recreation Center in 1969. His older brother, Roger, started boxing first. Roger helped start the boxing program, urging the center&#x27;s director, Ollie Dunlap, to form a team. Dave Jacobs, a former boxer, and Janks Morton volunteered as boxing coaches. Roger won some trophies and showed them off in front of Ray, goading him to start boxing.

In 1972, Leonard boxed in the featherweight quarterfinals of the National AAU Tournament, losing by decision to Jerome Artis. It was his first defeat. Later that year, he boxed in the Eastern Olympic Trials. The rules stated that a boxer had to be seventeen to box in international competition, so Leonard, only sixteen, lied about his age. He made it to the lightweight semifinals, losing a disputed decision to Greg Whaley, who took such a beating that he wasn&#x27;t allowed to continue in the trials and never boxed again.

Sarge Johnson, assistant coach of the US Olympic Boxing Team, said to Dave Jacobs, &quot;That kid you got is sweet as sugar&quot;. The nickname stuck. However, given his style and first name, it was probably only a matter of time before people started calling him Sugar Ray, after the man many consider to be the greatest boxer of all time, Sugar Ray Robinson.

In 1973, Leonard won the National Golden Gloves Lightweight Championship but lost to Randy Shields in the lightweight final of the National AAU Tournament. The following year, Leonard won the National Golden Gloves and National AAU Lightweight Championships. Leonard suffered his last two losses as an amateur in 1974. He lost a disputed decision to Anatoli Kamnev in Moscow, after which, Kamnev gave the winner&#x27;s trophy to Leonard. In Poland, local fighter Jan Kwacz was given a disqualification victory over Leonard after being knocked down three times in the first round but the referee ruled that Leonard had punched after the bell.

Leonard won the National Golden Gloves and National AAU Light Welterweight Championships in 1974. The following year, he again won the National AAU Light Welterweight Championship, as well as the Light Welterweight Championship at the Pan American Games.

In 1976, Leonard made the U.S. Olympic Team as the light welterweight representative. The team also included Leon and Michael Spinks, Howard Davis Jr., Leo Randolph, Charles Mooney, and John Tate. Many consider the 1976 U.S. team to be the greatest boxing team in the history of the Olympics. Leonard won his first four Olympic bouts by 5–0 decisions. In the semifinals, he faced Kazimierz Szczerba and won a 5–0 decision.

In the final, Leonard boxed the great Cuban knockout artist Andrés Aldama, who scored five straight knockouts to reach the final and would go on to win the gold medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics. Leonard landed several good left hooks in the first round. In the second, he dropped Aldama with a left to the chin. Late in the final round, he again hurt Aldama, which brought a standing eight count from the referee.

With only a few seconds left in the fight, a Leonard combination forced another standing eight count. Leonard was awarded a 5–0 decision and the Olympic gold medal. Afterward, Leonard announced, &quot;I&#x27;m finished...I&#x27;ve fought my last fight. My journey has ended, my dream is fulfilled. Now I want to go to school.&quot; He was given a scholarship to the University of Maryland, a gift from the citizens of Glenarden, Maryland. He planned to study business administration and communications. He finished his amateur career with a record of 165–5 and 75 KOs.

==Change of plans==
Juanita Wilkinson, Leonard&#x27;s high school girlfriend, told him she was pregnant in the summer of 1973. They decided to have the baby but marriage would be put off until after the Olympics in 1976. Leonard would continue to pursue his Olympic dream while she and the baby, Ray Charles Leonard Jr., lived with her parents. When Leonard boxed in the Olympics, he had a picture of Wilkinson taped to his sock.

Shortly before the Olympics, Wilkinson had filed an application to receive $156 a month in child support payments from Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. She named Leonard as the father and the county&#x27;s state attorney&#x27;s office filed a civil suit against Leonard to establish paternity and get support payments for the child. Leonard learned of the suit several days after returning home from the Olympics. The headline in the &quot;Washington Star&quot; read, &quot;Sugar Ray Leonard Named in Welfare Dept. Paternity Suit&quot;.

Wilkinson went to the Olympics to watch Leonard box, but she did not tell him about the suit and never asked him for any money. &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel like being bothered by all those complications by asking him for any money for support&quot;, she said. Leonard pledged he would support his son, even if he had to scrap plans to attend college.

Leonard had hoped to get lucrative endorsements following his gold medal win, but the negative publicity from the paternity suit chased off any big commercial possibilities. To make matters worse, his father was hospitalized with meningitis and his mother had a heart attack. With neither parent able to work, with his child and the mother of his child to support, and without any endorsement opportunities, Leonard decided to become a professional boxer.

==Professional career==

===Early professional career===
When Leonard decided to turn professional, Janks Morton introduced him to Mike Trainer, a friend of his who was an attorney. Trainer talked 24 of his friends and clients into underwriting Leonard&#x27;s career with an investment of $21,000 to be repaid within four years at 8% interest. Trainer then made Leonard the sole stockholder in Sugar Ray Leonard, Inc. Angelo Dundee, Muhammad Ali&#x27;s trainer, was brought in to be Leonard&#x27;s trainer and manager. Many of the people being considered wanted absolute control and a cut somewhere near the manager&#x27;s traditional 33%. Dundee had a different proposition. Although he would prescribe the training procedures, he would leave the day-to-day work to Dave Jacobs and Janks Morton. He would also choose Leonard&#x27;s opponents. For his services, Dundee would get 15% of Leonard&#x27;s purse.

Leonard made his professional debut on February 5, 1977, before a crowd of 10,270 at the Civic Center in Baltimore. He was paid $40,044 for the fight. His opponent was Luis &quot;The Bull&quot; Vega, whom he defeated by a six-round unanimous decision. After the fight, Leonard paid back his $21,000 loan to the investors.

In his fourteenth professional fight, Leonard fought his first world-ranked opponent, Floyd Mayweather, who was ranked seventeenth. The fight took place on September 11, 1978. Leonard won by a tenth-round knockout. A month later, Leonard defeated his old amateur nemesis Randy Shields by a ten-round unanimous decision.

On August 12, 1979, Leonard knocked out Pete Ranzany in four rounds to win the NABF Welterweight Championship. 
The following month, he made his first title defense against Andy Price. Price, an up-and-coming contender who was sponsored by Marvin Gaye, had a reputation for prolonged bouts in earlier fights and was believed by sports reporters to defeat or give a long fight to Leonard. Although Price landed multiple good blows, Leonard knocked him out in the first round, advancing his record to 25–0 with 16 knockouts.

===First world title===

==== Leonard vs. Benitez ====

Leonard fought Wilfred Benítez for the WBC Welterweight Championship on November 30, 1979, at Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. There was a capacity crowd of about 4,600. Leonard received $1 million and Benitez, a two-division champion with a record of 38–0–1, received $1.2 million.

It was a highly competitive and tactical battle. In the first round, Leonard rocked Benitez with a left hook that came off a jab and right cross. Late in the third, Leonard dropped Benitez on the seat of his pants with a stiff left jab. More embarrassed than hurt, Benitez got up quickly. Benitez started improving in the fourth, slipping numerous punches and finding the range with his right hand. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t aware I was in a championship early because I hit him so easy&quot;, Leonard said. &quot;But then he adjusted to my style. It was like looking in a mirror&quot;.

In the sixth, there was an accidental clash of heads, which opened a cut on the forehead of Benitez. Blood flowed down his forehead and the bridge of his nose but stayed out of his eyes.

Leonard landed the harder punches and had Benitez hurt several times late in the fight, but Leonard couldn&#x27;t put him away. Benitez was very slick. &quot;No one, I mean no one, can make me miss punches like that&quot;, Leonard said.

Going into the final round, Leonard led by scores of 137–130, 137–133, and 136–134. The two went toe-to-toe in the fifteenth. Late in the round, Leonard dropped Benitez with a left. He got up, but after a few more punches, the referee stopped the fight. The time was 2:54 of round fifteen.

The Boxing Writers Association of America and &quot;The Ring&quot; named Leonard &quot;Fighter of the Year&quot; for 1979.

==== Leonard vs. Green ====
Leonard made his first title defense in Landover, Maryland, on March 31, 1980. His opponent was Dave &quot;Boy&quot; Green. The British challenger had a record of 33–2. In the fourth round, Leonard knocked Green out with a devastating left hook. Leonard called it &quot;the hardest single punch I ever threw.&quot;

===&quot;The Brawl in Montreal&quot;===

On June 20, 1980, Leonard returned to the Olympic Stadium in Montreal to defend his title against Roberto Durán before a crowd of 46,317. Durán, the former Undisputed World Lightweight Champion for years, had a record of 71–1 and was the #1 welterweight contender and considered the best &quot;Pound for Pound&quot; fighter in the world. Durán received $1.5 million and Leonard, working for a percentage of the closed-circuit gate as well as a guarantee, received over $9 million.

Durán forced the issue and took the fight to Leonard, cutting off the ring and denying Leonard space to fight his fight. Durán attacked at almost every turn. Leonard battled back again and again, but he had to work just to find room to breathe and swing, at times simply to survive. In the second, Durán rocked Leonard with a left hook, sending him into the ropes. Leonard started to do better by the fifth round, finding some punching room and throwing numerous multi-punch combinations. The two fought with great intensity throughout the fight. According to Bill Nack:

Durán was awarded a unanimous decision, although it was mistakenly read as a majority decision in the ring. The scorecard of judge Angelo Poletti was incorrectly added and announced as 147–147. He actually scored it 148–147. In rounds, he had it three for Durán, two for Leonard, and ten even. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; called his scorecard &quot;a monument to indecision.&quot; Judges Raymond Baldeyrou and Harry Gibbs scored the fight 146–144 and 145–144, respectively. Associated Press had it 144–141 for Durán, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; had Leonard ahead 144–142.

&quot;I did the best I could&quot;, Leonard said. &quot;I think I pretty much fought from the heart.&quot; Asked if Leonard was the best he ever fought, Durán thought for a moment and then answered, &quot;Si, si.&quot; Durán said. &quot;He does have a heart. That&#x27;s why he&#x27;s living.&quot;

===&quot;No Más&quot; in New Orleans===
The rematch billed as &quot;Stone vs. Sugar.. Once Again&quot;, took place November 25, 1980, at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans in front of 25,038 fans. Leonard received $7 million and Durán received $8 million.

Dave Jacobs disagreed with the decision to have an immediate rematch with Durán and terminated his relationship with Leonard when the rematch was made. &quot;My idea is that he should have a tune-up fight before he fights with Roberto again&quot;, Jacobs said. &quot;I think he won the fight with Durán, but I don&#x27;t think it is healthy for him to be fighting Durán right away&quot;.

After the Montreal fight Durán went on a partying binge and ballooned in weight. Leonard was aware of this, and in an interview for Beyond the Glory he said: &quot;My intention was to fight Durán ASAP because I knew Durán&#x27;s habits. I knew he would indulge himself; he&#x27;d gain 40–50 lbs and then sweat it off to make 147.&quot; Unlike the fight in Montreal, Leonard used his superior speed and movement to outbox and befuddle Durán. &quot;The whole fight, I was moving, I was moving&quot;, Leonard said. &quot;And &quot;Voom!&quot; I snapped his head back with a jab. &quot;Voom!&quot; I snapped it back again. He tried to get me against the ropes, I&#x27;d pivot, spin off and &quot;Pow!&quot; Come under with a punch.&quot;

In round seven, Leonard started to taunt Durán. Leonard&#x27;s most memorable punch came late in the round. Winding up his right hand, as if to throw a bolo punch, Leonard snapped out a left jab and caught Durán flush in the face. &quot;It made his eyes water&quot;, Leonard said. He continued to taunt Durán mercilessly. He stuck out his chin, inviting Durán to hit it. Durán hesitated. Leonard kept it up, continuing to move, stop, and mug.

In the closing seconds of the eighth round, Durán turned his back to Leonard and quit, saying to referee Octavio Meyran, &quot;No Más&quot; (English: &quot;No more&quot;). Leonard was the winner by a technical knockout at 2:44 of round eight, regaining the WBC Welterweight Championship. Leonard led by scores of 68–66, 68–66 and 67–66.

Durán said he quit because of stomach cramps, caused by overeating after the weigh-in. &quot;At the end of the fifth round, I got cramps in my stomach, and it kept getting worse and worse&quot;, Duran later said. &quot;I felt weaker and weaker in my body and arms.&quot; He then announced, &quot;I am retiring from boxing right now.&quot; During the night Durán was admitted to a hospital with stomach pains and discharged the following day.

Everyone was surprised by Durán&#x27;s actions, none more so than his veteran trainers, Freddie Brown and Ray Arcel. &quot;I was shocked&quot;, Brown said. &quot;There was no indication that he was in pain or getting weak.&quot; Arcel was angry. &quot;That&#x27;s it&quot;, he said. &quot;I&#x27;ve had it. This is terrible. I&#x27;ve handled thousands of fighters and never had anyone quit on me. I think he needs a psychiatrist more than he needs anything else.&quot; Durán&#x27;s manager, Carlos Eleta, said, &quot;Durán didn&#x27;t quit because of stomach cramps. He quit because he was embarrassed. I &quot;know&quot; this.&quot; According to Randy Gordon, who witnessed Durán&#x27;s antics beforehand and was in his dressing room immediately afterwards, Durán quit because of his huge eating binge prior to the fight.

&quot;I &quot;made&quot; him quit&quot;, Leonard said. &quot;To make a man quit, to make Roberto Durán quit, was better than knocking him out.&quot;

===Second world title===

==== Leonard vs. Bonds ====
On March 28, 1981, Leonard defended his title against Larry Bonds, the WBC sixth-ranked contender, at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York. Bonds was a southpaw, which made him a good opponent for Leonard, given that his next opponent was scheduled to be the WBA Light Middleweight Champion Ayub Kalule, a southpaw.

Leonard was the aggressor throughout, with Bonds circling the ring. He staggered Bonds with a right in the fourth round and dropped him with a follow-up combination. Bonds got up and continued to move, with Leonard in pursuit. Leonard dropped him again in the tenth. Bonds rose but Leonard didn&#x27;t let him off the hook. The referee stopped the fight with Bonds taking punishment in a corner.

==== Leonard vs. Kalule ====
Leonard moved up to the junior middleweight division and faced Kalule on June 25, 1981, at the Astrodome in Houston, Texas. Kalule, who was 36–0, had been the WBA Light Middleweight Champion for two years.

Kalule and his handlers had expected Leonard to use lateral movement against him, but Leonard chose to fight inside instead. After eight tough rounds, Leonard was ahead although Kalule appeared to be coming on strong in the eighth and ninth. Leonard finally hurt him with a right to the head. Shortly afterward, Leonard dropped him with a flurry of punches. Kalule got up but the referee waved it off. Leonard celebrated his victory with a full 360-degree, no-hands flip. Despite an official stoppage time of 2.59, the fight was actually stopped at 3.06 into the round, meaning Kalule should have been saved by the bell.

===The Showdown===

Promoted as &quot;The Showdown&quot;, Leonard fought Thomas Hearns on September 16, 1981, at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas to unify the World Welterweight Championship in a scheduled fifteen-rounder. They fought before a live crowd of 23,618. Hearns was paid $5.1 million, and Leonard made over $11 million. The fight grossed over $35 million. The live gate was $5.9 million, and the revenue from pay-per-view was $7.5 million.

Hearns, 32–0 with 30 knockouts, won the WBA Welterweight Championship in 1980, scoring a second-round knockout of José &quot;Pipino&quot; Cuevas in Detroit, Michigan. He made three successful title defenses, stopping Luis Primera, Randy Shields, and Pablo Baez.

The fight began as expected Leonard boxing from a distance and Hearns&#x27;s stalking. Leonard had difficulty with Hearns&#x27; long reach and sharp jab. By the end of round five, Leonard had a growing swelling under his left eye, and Hearns had built a considerable lead on the scorecards. Leonard, becoming more aggressive, hurt Hearns in the sixth with a left hook to the chin. Leonard battered Hearns in rounds six and seven, but Hearns regrouped. Hearns started to stick and move, and he started to pile up points again. The roles reversed: Leonard became the stalker and Hearns became the boxer. The fight billed as a classic showdown between a powerful knockout artist and the best boxer/puncher the welterweight division had seen in decades devolved into a slow, tactical fight.

Hearns won rounds nine through twelve on all three scorecards. Between rounds twelve and thirteen, Angelo Dundee told Leonard, &quot;You&#x27;re blowing it, son! You&#x27;re blowing it!&quot;.

Leonard, with a badly swollen left eye, came out roaring for the thirteenth round. After hurting Hearns with a right, Leonard exploded with a combination of punches. Hearns&#x27; legs were clearly gone and after more pressure from Leonard he was bundled through the ropes, no knockdown was given as it wasn&#x27;t a punch that sent him there. Hearns managed to rise but was dropped by a flurry of hard punches near the end of the round.

In round fourteen, after staggering Hearns with an overhand right, Leonard pinned Hearns against the ropes, where he unleashed another furious combination, prompting referee Davey Pearl to stop the contest and award Sugar Ray Leonard the Unified World Welterweight Championship. Hearns was leading by scores of 124–122, 125–122, and 125–121.

After the fight, there was controversy due to the scoring of rounds six and seven. Even though Leonard dominated, hurting Hearns and battering him, all three judges gave both rounds to Leonard by a 10–9 margin. Many felt that the ten-point must scoring system was not properly used and those rounds should have been scored 10–8. Some also considered the stoppage premature. Veteran ringside commentator Don Dunphy said &quot;They&#x27;re stopping the fight. I don&#x27;t believe it. Hearns was ahead on points.&quot; However, Emanuel Steward, Hearns&#x27; manager and trainer, said, &quot;I felt that the referee was justified in stopping the fight ... Tommy did not have enough energy to make it through the fight.&quot;

The fight was named &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Ring&quot;. Leonard was named &quot;Fighter of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Ring&quot; and The Boxing Writers Association of America. He was also named &quot;Athlete of the Year&quot; by ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; and &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

===Retirement and return===

On February 15, 1982, Leonard defended the unified title against Bruce Finch, the WBC fourth-ranked contender, in a bout at Reno, NV. Leonard knocked him out in the third round. Leonard&#x27;s next fight was scheduled to be against Roger Stafford on May 14, 1982, in Buffalo, New York. While training, Leonard started to see floaters. He went to a doctor and discovered that he had a detached retina. The fight was canceled, and Leonard had surgery to repair the retina on May 9, 1982.

On November 9, 1982, Leonard invited Marvin Hagler and other boxing dignitaries to a charity event in Baltimore, Maryland to hear him announce whether he would continue his career. Standing in a boxing ring with Howard Cosell, the master of ceremonies, Leonard announced his retirement, saying a bout with Hagler would unfortunately never happen. Leonard maintained his eye was fully healed, but that he just didn&#x27;t want to box anymore.

Missing the limelight and the competition, Leonard announced in December 1983 that he was returning to the ring. Leonard boasted that he would have a couple of ten-round bouts and then take on Milton McCrory, Donald Curry, Durán, Hearns and finally Hagler. This decision was met with a torrent of criticism from fans and the media, who felt Leonard was taking unnecessary risks with his surgically repaired eye.

A bout with Philadelphia&#x27;s Kevin Howard, who was 20–4–1, was scheduled for February 25, 1984. The fight was postponed when Leonard had minor surgery on his right eye to fix a loose retina. This latest eye problem further fueled the flames of those who opposed Leonard&#x27;s comeback.

Before the fight with Howard, Dave Jacobs rejoined Leonard&#x27;s team in a limited role. Jacobs had quit in 1980, disagreeing with Leonard&#x27;s decision to have an immediate rematch with Durán.

Leonard and Howard fought on May 11, 1984, in Worcester, Massachusetts. Howard knocked Leonard flat on his back in the fourth round. It was the first knockdown of Leonard&#x27;s professional career. Leonard came back to stop Howard in the ninth round, but the stoppage was disputed, with some feeling that the referee stopped the fight prematurely. Leonard was ahead on all three scorecards at the time of the stoppage. At the post-fight press conference, Leonard surprised everyone by announcing his retirement again, saying he just didn&#x27;t have it anymore.

===Leonard vs. Hagler===

On March 10, 1986, Marvin Hagler knocked out John Mugabi in eleven rounds to retain the Undisputed World Middleweight Championship for the twelfth time and advance his record to 62–2–2. After the bout Hagler stated it may be his last fight. &quot;I was ringside&quot;, Leonard said. &quot;I&#x27;m watching John &#x27;The Beast&#x27; Mugabi outbox Hagler. Of all people, John &#x27;The Beast&#x27; Mugabi.&quot; It was then that Leonard decided to come back and fight Hagler. He called Mike Trainer and said, &quot;I can beat Hagler&quot;.

On May 1, 1986, Leonard announced on a Washington, D.C. talk show that he would return to the ring to fight Hagler. The announcement generated a lot of controversy because of Leonard&#x27;s inactivity and eye injuries, yet it also excited many sports fans who had hoped to see them fight years earlier. Hagler took a few months to decide, then agreed to the match.

The fight, promoted as &quot;The Super Fight&quot; and &quot;The King of the Ring&quot;, was scheduled for April 6, 1987, at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Leonard was guaranteed $11 million, and Hagler was guaranteed $12 million. Hagler was a heavy favorite. The odds started at 4–1, then settled at 3–1. A paying crowd of 12,379 generated a live gate of $6.2 million. According to Bob Arum, the fight grossed $78 million (which equates to around $179 million in 2020).

The original fight plan for Leonard was to go toe-to-toe with Hagler and try to cut him, but the plan changed about five days before the fight. Leonard got hit by sparring partner Quincy Taylor and was badly buckled. &quot;He almost knocked me out&quot;, Leonard said. After that, Leonard decided to box Hagler.

Many were surprised that Hagler, a natural southpaw, opened the fight boxing out of an orthodox stance. After the quick and slick Leonard won the first two rounds on all three scorecards, Hagler started the third round as a southpaw. Hagler did better, but Leonard&#x27;s superior speed and boxing skill still allowed him to control the fight. Hagler looked stiff and mechanical and missed the speedy Leonard time and again prompting CBS ringside commentator Gil Clancy to remark &quot;...and is he ever missing...Leonard isn&#x27;t doing anything to make him miss, he&#x27;s just missing!&quot;

By the fifth, Leonard, who was moving a lot, began to tire and Hagler started to get closer. Hagler buckled Leonard&#x27;s knees with a right uppercut near the end of the round, which finished with Leonard on the ropes. Hagler continued to score somewhat effectively in round six. Leonard, having slowed down, was obliged to fight more and move less. However, he was able to outpunch Hagler along the ropes and got the better of several bristling exchanges. Hagler never seized total control of the fight as he had against Thomas Hearns two years earlier, when he brutalized Hearns and scored a third-round knockout. Hagler&#x27;s punches lacked snap and, although he was scoring solidly to the body, he looked nothing like the powerful fighter who had dominated the middleweight division for the previous five years. Leonard&#x27;s observation that the Hagler who beat John Mugabi was older and slower proved to be spot on. In rounds seven and eight, Hagler&#x27;s southpaw jab was landing solidly, and Leonard&#x27;s counter flurries were less frequent.

Round nine was the most exciting round of the fight. Hagler hurt Leonard with a left cross and pinned him in a corner. Leonard looked to be in trouble, but he furiously fought his way out of the corner. The action see-sawed back and forth for the rest of the round, with each man having his moments. However, Hagler&#x27;s moments were more spectacular and one of Hagler&#x27;s cornermen: Roger Perron (in an interview that took place on an episode of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Legendary Nights&quot; episode segments in 2003) later stated that: &quot;the ninth round was probably Marvin (Hagler)&#x27;s, best round&quot;.

Round ten was tame by comparison, as the pace slowed after the furious action of the previous round but with Hagler having more spectacular moments. Despite Leonard&#x27;s obvious fatigue, he boxed well in the eleventh. Every time Hagler scored, Leonard came back with something flashier and more eye-catching, if not as effective. But at that point in the fight, Hagler appeared to be slightly more ring-general and clearly more aggressive. Between rounds eleven and twelve, Leonard&#x27;s trainer: Angelo Dundee, implored Sugar Ray to get up off his stool yelling &quot;We got three minutes...new champ...new champ!&quot; Leonard yelled &quot;Yeah!&quot; and played to the screaming crowd. Hagler&#x27;s corner was much more reserved prompting Clancy to comment: &quot;They&#x27;re talking to him like it&#x27;s an IBM meeting or something...no emotion.&quot; In the final round, Hagler continued to chase Leonard. He hit Leonard with a big left hand and backed him into a corner. Leonard responded with a furious flurry, landing few punches but whipping the upset-hoping crowd into a frenzy. Hagler backed off, and Leonard danced away with Hagler in pursuit. The fight ended with Hagler and Leonard exchanging along the ropes. At the final bell, even uniformed ringside security rushed into the ring applauding and lauding Leonard&#x27;s effort.

Leonard threw 629 punches and landed 306, while Hagler threw 792 and landed 291.

Leonard was awarded a controversial split-decision. Judge Dave Moretti scored it 115–113 for Leonard, while judge Lou Filippo had it 115–113 for Hagler. Judge José Guerra scored the fight 118–110 for Leonard. Many felt that Hagler deserved the decision because he was the aggressor and landed the harder punches. Scottish boxing journalist Hugh McIlvanney wrote that Leonard&#x27;s plan was to &quot;steal rounds with a few flashy and carefully timed flurries...he was happy to exaggerate hand speed at the expense of power, and neither he nor two of the scorers seemed bothered by the fact that many of the punches landed on the champion&#x27;s gloves and arms.&quot;

Many others felt that Leonard deservedly got the decision, arguing that Leonard landed more punches and showed better defense and ring generalship. Jim Murray, long-time sports columnist for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, wrote, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t even close...He didn&#x27;t just outpoint Hagler, he exposed him. He made him look like a guy chasing a bus. In snowshoes...Leonard repeatedly beat Hagler to the punch. When he did, he hit harder. He hit more often...He made Hagler into what he perceived him to be throughout his career—a brawler, a swarmer, a man who could club you to death only if you stood there and let him. If you moved, he was lost.&quot;

The scorecards from the ringside press and broadcast media attest to the polarizing views and opinions of the fight.

The fight was named &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; and &quot;Upset of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Ring&quot;.

Despite requests from the Hagler camp, Leonard was uninterested in a rematch and retired on May 27, 1987. &quot;I&#x27;ll try, I&#x27;ll give it a shot&quot;, Leonard said of his latest retirement. &quot;But you guys know me.&quot; A month after Hagler&#x27;s formal retirement in June 1988, Leonard would announce another comeback.

===Second comeback===

====Leonard vs. Lalonde====

On November 7, 1988, Leonard made another comeback, facing Donny Lalonde at Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Las Vegas. They fought for Lalonde&#x27;s WBC Light Heavyweight Championship and the newly created WBC Super Middleweight Championship, which meant that Lalonde had to make 168 lbs. Many were critical of the fact that Lalonde&#x27;s light heavyweight title was on the line when the weight limit of the fight with Leonard was at 168 pounds, and critical of Leonard for stipulating that his opponent—a natural 175-pounder—should weigh less than his usual fighting weight, which could possibly weaken him. However, Lalonde later told HBO&#x27;s Larry Merchant that he didn&#x27;t have any trouble making weight.

Lalonde, 31–2 with 26 knockouts, was guaranteed at least $6 million and Leonard was guaranteed over $10 million.

This would be Leonard&#x27;s first professional fight without Angelo Dundee. For Leonard&#x27;s fight with Hagler, Dundee worked without a contract and received $175,000, which was less than 2% of Leonard&#x27;s purse. Dundee was unhappy with that amount. He requested a contract for the Lalonde fight and Leonard refused. &quot;I don&#x27;t have contracts. My word is my bond&quot;, Leonard said. Janks Morton and Dave Jacobs trained Leonard for the Lalonde fight.

Lalonde&#x27;s size and awkwardness troubled Leonard. In the fourth round, a right hand to the top of Leonard&#x27;s head dropped him for just the second time in his career. Early in the ninth, Lalonde hurt Leonard with a right to the chin. Leonard fired back and hurt Lalonde with a right. He drove him to the ropes and unleashed a furious assault. Lalonde tried to tie up Leonard but got dropped with a powerful left hook. He rose but was soon down again, and the fight was stopped. Judges Chuck Giampa and Franz Marti had Leonard ahead by scores of 77–74 and 77–75, respectively. Judge Stuart Kirshenbaum had Lalonde ahead 76–75.

After the fight, Leonard vacated the light heavyweight title, but kept the super middleweight title. Also, Leonard and Janks Morton split because of personal differences. Morton was replaced as co-trainer by Pepe Correa, who had worked with Leonard for most of the previous fifteen years.

====Leonard vs. Hearns====

On June 12, 1989, Leonard defended the WBC Super Middleweight Championship in a rematch with Thomas Hearns at Caesar&#x27;s Palace. It was promoted as &quot;The War&quot;. Hearns was guaranteed $11 million, and Leonard was guaranteed $14 million.

Hearns dropped Leonard with a right cross in the third round, but Leonard came back and battered Hearns around the ring in the fifth. Early in the seventh round, Hearns hurt Leonard but punched himself out going for the knockout. With Hearns fatigued, Leonard came back and had a strong finish to the round. Rounds nine and ten were good rounds for Leonard, but he ran into trouble in the eleventh round. Three booming rights from Hearns sent Leonard down for the second time in the fight. Knowing he needed a big finish; Leonard fought furiously and had a big final round.

The judges scored the fight a draw and Leonard retained the title. Judge Jerry Roth scored the fight 113–112 for Hearns, Judge Tom Kazmarek scored it 113–112 for Leonard, and Judge Dalby Shirley scored it 112–112. Shirley was the only judge to give Leonard a 10–8 margin in the twelfth. If he had scored it 10–9, as his two colleagues did, Hearns would have won by a split decision. Eventually, Leonard admitted that Hearns deserved the decision.

====Leonard vs. Durán III – Uno Más====

On December 7, 1989, Leonard defended the title against Roberto Durán, who was the reigning WBC Middleweight Champion. Durán was guaranteed $7.6 million, and Leonard&#x27;s arrangement guaranteed him over $13 million.

For the Durán fight, Leonard cut his entourage from twenty-one to six. Dave Jacobs was one of the people let go, leaving Correa as the sole trainer. Correa was instructed not to spare the whip. &quot;For the first time in a long time, I allowed someone to push me&quot;, Leonard said.

The fight took place at the new Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. Leonard used constant lateral movement and won by a lopsided twelve-round unanimous decision over a listless Durán. The scores were 120–110, 119–109, and 116–111. In a fight that many considered to be very boring, both fighters were booed often by the fans, and many left the arena before the decision was announced. Pat Putnam of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; wrote, &quot;Leonard gave them artistic perfection when they wanted heated battle, and they booed lustily. Most fight fans would not spend a dime to watch Van Gogh paint Sunflowers, but they would fill Yankee Stadium to see him cut off his ear.&quot; Although Leonard dominated the fight, he suffered several cuts. His lower lip was cut from a headbutt in the fourth round, his left eye was cut in the eleventh round, and his right eye was cut in the twelfth round. The cuts required a total of 60 stitches.

In August 1990, Leonard relinquished the WBC super-middleweight title, saying that he was under the weight for the division. He then offered Hearns a third fight, but Hearns said he could no longer make the weight and moved up to the light heavyweight division.

====Leonard vs. Norris====

On February 9, 1991, Leonard went down to 154 lbs and fought WBC Light Middleweight Champion Terry Norris at Madison Square Garden. Leonard entered the bout as a 3-1 favorite, but Norris dominated the fight, giving Leonard a heavy beating. He knocked Leonard down with a left hook in the second round, and in the seventh, he dropped Leonard again with a short right. Leonard had no answer for the skillful, younger, faster man. Leonard went the distance but lost by a lopsided decision. The scores were 120–104, 119–103, and 116–110. After the verdict was announced, Leonard announced his retirement. &quot;It took this fight to show me it is no longer my time&quot;, Leonard said. &quot;Tonight, was my last fight. I know how Hagler felt now.&quot;

===Final comeback===

In October 1996, the 40-year-old Leonard announced that he was coming out of retirement to fight 34-year-old Héctor Camacho for the lightly regarded International Boxing Council (IBC) Middleweight Championship. Camacho, a light-hitting southpaw, was a three-time world champion with a record of 62–3–1. However, Camacho was also considered to be past his prime. Leonard decided to fight Camacho after commentating on Camacho&#x27;s fight with the 45-year-old Roberto Durán the previous year, describing the disputed unanimous decision as &quot;an early Christmas gift&quot;.

Leonard blamed his poor performance against Norris on lack of motivation, a rib injury, moving down in weight, and divorce, which was being litigated while he was in training. &quot;It was stupid for me to fight Norris at 154 lbs&quot;, Leonard said. &quot;This is different. I&#x27;m in the best shape possible.&quot;
For the Camacho fight, Leonard had a new trainer, Adrian Davis. &quot;He&#x27;s a great trainer, a throwback&quot;, Leonard said. &quot;He has really helped me get ready.&quot;

In January 1997, it was announced that Leonard had been voted into the International Boxing Hall Of Fame in Canastota, New York. The rules state that a boxer must be retired for five years before being eligible for induction. When the vote took place, Leonard had been retired for more than five years, therefore, he was eligible, even though he had a fight scheduled. The induction ceremony was on June 15, 1997.

The fight with Camacho took place on March 1, 1997, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Camacho applied pressure from the opening bell and started to score well in the third. He continued to score well in the fourth and opened a cut above Leonard&#x27;s right eye. In the fifth, Camacho dropped Leonard with a right followed by two left uppercuts. Leonard got up but was unable to ward off Camacho. The referee stopped the fight with Camacho teeing off on a defenseless Leonard on the ropes. It was the only time in Leonard&#x27;s career that he was knocked out.

Afterward, Leonard retired again, saying, &quot;For sure, my career is definitely over for me in the ring.&quot; However, less than a week after the fight, Leonard said he planned to fight again. He blamed his loss on a torn right calf muscle. His doctor suggested that he cancel the fight, but Leonard wanted to go through with it. Before the fight, he was given a shot of novocaine.

Leonard said he planned to have a series of tune-up fights before fighting a champion. He was scheduled to fight Tony Menefee on February 15, 1998, in Australia, but he pulled out of the fight, saying that he didn&#x27;t have the motivation. The Camacho fight was Leonard&#x27;s last. He finished his career with a record of 36–3–1 with 25 knockouts.

==Media appearances==

Leonard has worked as a boxing analyst for ABC, CBS, NBC, ESPN, HBO and EPIX. His relationship with HBO lasted for more than a decade. It ended in 1990, after HBO was not offered an opportunity to bid on the telecast rights to Leonard&#x27;s fight with Terry Norris. HBO believed it would be inappropriate for Leonard to continue with them if they couldn&#x27;t bid on his fights. Leonard&#x27;s attorney, Mike Trainer, said, &quot;There never has been a linkage between his broadcasting and his fighting.&quot;

Leonard has provided commercial endorsements for companies including Coca-Cola, EA Sports, Ford, Nabisco, Revlon and 7 Up. His most famous commercial was a 7 Up ad he did with his son, Ray Jr., Roberto Durán and Durán&#x27;s son Roberto Jr. in the early 1980s. Leonard is among the most sought-after motivational/inspirational speakers in the world today. His speech, entitled &quot;Power&quot; (Prepare, Overcome and Win Every Round), is consistently booked with major Fortune 500 companies throughout the United States and abroad.

Leonard has also worked as an actor. He has appeared in numerous television shows, including &quot;Half &amp; Half&quot;, &quot;L.A. Heat&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Renegade&quot; (1995) and &quot;Tales From The Crypt&quot;. He has also appeared in several movies, including &quot;I Spy&quot; and most recently &quot;The Fighter&quot; (2010), starring Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg. This movie brought back memories of his fight with Dicky Eklund. He also worked as an adviser in the 2011 robot boxing film &quot;Real Steel&quot;. Leonard served as host and mentor to the aspiring fighters on &quot;The Contender&quot;. Sylvester Stallone, who co-hosted during the first season, was one of the executive producers, along with Mark Burnett. When Leonard left the show, he was replaced as host by Tony Danza for the final season.

In 2001, Leonard launched Sugar Ray Leonard Boxing Inc., a boxing promotional company, and announced the company&#x27;s strategic partnership with ESPN. Together, Leonard and ESPN would produce and promote &quot;Sugar Ray Leonard and ESPN II Presents Friday Night Fights&quot;, which would air the first Friday of every month for twelve months. Leonard&#x27;s boxing promotional company was dissolved in 2004. He had a falling out with partner Bjorn Rebney, whom he called &quot;a cancer in my company.&quot; Speaking of his promotional company, Leonard said, &quot;We did some great shows with evenly matched fights. I took great pride in it. But the TV show came about and made my decision a lot easier. I already had it in the back of my mind to dissolve the company. The working environment was not healthy.&quot;

Leonard competed on season 12 of Dancing with the Stars, which premiered on Monday, March 21, 2011, on ABC. His partner was Anna Trebunskaya. He was voted off in Week 4 of the show. During his appearance on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; in 2011, Leonard was defeated by host Stephen Colbert in a thumb wrestling contest. He appeared as a guest at the chef&#x27;s table, along with Tito Ortiz, during the tenth season of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;. He is the celebrity spokesperson for the Atlanta law firm John Foy and Associates, PC.

Leonard was also the subject of a &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode (season 6, episode 21) where George tries to flatter his boss by saying he looks like Sugar Ray Leonard. The real Leonard (a Seinfeld fan) mentioned that he was told about the episode by friends and family but had never seen it for himself until a friend gave him the DVD set for a gift.

In March 2019, Leonard made a guest appearance on the popular daily morning show on YouTube, &quot;Good Mythical Morning&quot;, hosted by Rhett McLaughlin and Link Neal. In this episode of the &quot;March Milkness&quot; series (where Rhett and Link created a March Madness style bracket to determine the best breakfast cereal), Leonard was brought in to break a tie between the Fruity Region Champion, Froot Loops, and the Chocolatey Region Champion, Oreo O&#x27;s. His decision was to push Froot Loops onto the Finals, where they were taken out by Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

==Personal life==

===Family===

Leonard married his high school sweetheart, Juanita Wilkinson, in January 1980. Their six-year-old son, who was born when they were teenagers, served as the ring bearer. In 1984, they had another son. They were divorced in 1990. During divorce proceedings, Juanita Leonard testified that her husband physically abused her while under the influence of alcohol. She also said he was an occasional cocaine user. In his testimony, Leonard confirmed his wife&#x27;s claims and went on to reveal that the problems of their marriage were not due to drug and alcohol use.

After the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; broke the story, Leonard held a press conference and publicly acknowledged that the accusations were true. He said he started using medication after he retired in 1982, following surgery to repair a detached retina. &quot;I wanted more&quot;, Leonard said. &quot;I wanted that arena. I didn&#x27;t want anyone to tell me my career had to end.&quot; &quot;I decided to search for a substitute...I resorted to cocaine. I used when I felt bad, I used when I missed competing at that level&quot;, he said. &quot;It was a crutch, something that enabled me to forget.&quot; He said he quit using drugs in early 1986, when he woke up one morning and &quot;what I saw in the mirror was scary.&quot; &quot;I can never erase the pain or the scars I have made through my stupidity, my selfishness&quot;, Leonard said. &quot;All I can do is say I&#x27;m sorry, but that is not enough.&quot; In 2011, Leonard revealed in an NPR interview that he had been free of alcohol since July 2006.

In 1989, Leonard was introduced to Bernadette Robi by Kenny G at a Luther Vandross concert. Robi is the daughter of Paul Robi, one of the original Platters, and she is the ex-wife of Lynn Swann. Leonard and Robi were married at Leonard&#x27;s $8.7 million estate in Pacific Palisades, California in August 1993. At the wedding ceremony, the grounds were converted into a garden with 10,000 roses and blossoms of other flowers flown in from the Netherlands. They have a daughter, Camille.

Leonard is also the godfather of Khloé Kardashian and has appeared on many episodes of &quot;Keeping Up With The Kardashians&quot;.

===Charity work===
For many years, Leonard has been the International Chairman of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation&#x27;s Walk for a Cure and is actively involved in raising both awareness and funds.

Leonard testified before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs in 2009. The Senate hearing was titled &quot;Type 1 Diabetes Research: Real Progress and Real Hope for a Cure&quot;. He testified about the burden of diabetes and the need for continued research funding to find a cure.

Leonard and his wife, Bernadette, founded the Sugar Ray Leonard Foundation to support the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and its annual Walk for a Cure. In 2009, the foundation expanded to support programs that help people rebuild their communities in ten cities across the United States. It supports accessible housing, healthcare services, and educational services and job training.

In 2007 he was awarded The Ambassador Award of Excellence by the LA Sports &amp; Entertainment Commission at the Riviera Country Club for his continued community involvement.

===Advocacy===
In his autobiography &quot;The Big Fight: My Life in and out of the Ring&quot;, published in June 2011, Leonard reveals that as a young boxer he was the victim of sexual abuse from an Olympic trainer as well as another man, a benefactor. He has since made public appearances to bring attention to the issue of child sex abuse, declaring himself a &quot;poster child&quot; for the cause and encouraging victims to report their abuse.

<doc id="87532" wikidata="Q2934542" url="?curid=87532" title="Afrikaner Calvinism">
<text>Afrikaner Calvinism () is a cultural and religious development among Afrikaners that combined elements of seventeenth-century Calvinist doctrine with a &quot;chosen people&quot; ideology based in the Bible. It had origins in ideas espoused in the Old Testament of the Jews as the chosen people.

A number of modern studies have argued that Boers gathered for the Great Trek inspired by this concept, and they used it to legitimise their subordination of other South African ethnic groups. It is thought to have contributed the religious basis for modern Afrikaner nationalism. Dissenting scholars have asserted that Calvinism did not play a significant role in Afrikaner society until after they suffered the trauma of the Second Boer War. Early settlers dwelt in isolated frontier conditions and lived much closer to pseudo-Christian animist beliefs than organised religion.

== Background ==

White settlement in South Africa is traced to the 1652 arrival of the Dutch East India Company at the Cape of Good Hope, seeking to establish a supply and refreshment station for its ships and crews bound to and from Indonesia. From its headquarters in Amsterdam, the Company recruited crew and equipped voyages for the Orient. Most of its Dutch employees were Protestant Calvinists, who were the majority of the population in the region, supplemented by other Protestants: a few Lutheran Germans, and numerous French Huguenot refugees who had fled religious persecution in France. Among their Afrikaner descendants, individual religious communities such as the &quot;Dopper&quot;s became known for establishing their own doctrine in rifts with the Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk (Dutch Reformed Church). By the late nineteenth century, the separatist churches of Gereformeerde Kerk had developed in South Africa.

==Settlement period==
The Dutch settlement of the Cape of Good Hope was the first colonial success in South Africa. The company established strict rules for trade between the settlement and the native population. Only a Company administrator could authorize trade or Christian missionary ventures among the Africans. Settlers were forbidden from stealing or shooting cattle, which were a form of wealth and sustainability for the Africans. The early Europeans were shocked by the differences in the customs, clothing and appearance of the Africans. False rumours that the natives were cannibals reinforced the motive to avoid unnecessary contact. The Cape was a walled garden, with Africa on the outside and Europe within. This strict order minimised conflicts with the Africans during the early settlement period.

But many settlers believed they had arrived with a missionary motive, which included spreading the superiority of European culture. These factors contributed to the settler practice of indenturing the native Khoisan population to serve as workers and servants. Within that master/servant relationship, the Europeans would teach the Bible to them in hope that the message would filter back through the servant&#x27;s family (along with reports of the superiority of the European way of life) and thus bring about conversion.

The farmers who lived outside the physical walls of the towns had a different arrangement with natives than did the townspeople. To them, occupation meant ownership, and ownership implied the right to protect their property. As they settled into the seemingly unoccupied territories surrounding the Cape, they enforced their assumptions about ownership and its rights against the wandering hunters or herding tribes who crossed the Fish River into farm territories. The settlers considered the farms to be an extension beyond the towns of the separation between the white and the black occupants of the land.

Separation and rules of exchange were opposed very early in the Afrikaner mind to invasion and conquest. And, this anti-imperialism extended also to the theory of missionary obligation that developed within the Dutch Reformed Church: the Kingdom of God will grow within the sphere of influence assigned to the church by divine providence, as children are taught the Gospel by their parents and family. If God deems it fitting for the Gospel to be received by the natives, and taught to their children, then this is his glory. Toward that end, Christians have a defining role given them from God, a calling, or covenantal responsibility as God&#x27;s people, to keep themselves pure in the faith and just in their dealings with the heathen, and to be absolutely unyielding in their protection of what has been legitimately claimed in the name of the Triune God.

==Folk religion==
This history is essential to understanding the distinctive concept of &quot;calling&quot; that developed among the Afrikaners. These attitudes, adopted very early, went with them through later conflicts, formed in a way that to them, seemed to be obviously crafted by the hand of God Himself. They believed that they were preserved because of God&#x27;s wisdom and Providence. The suffering which they experienced, and the strong bonds that they formed in response to it, seemed to confirm this idea at every turn. Their history as a people has a central place in the formation of the Boer religion. In this way, a distinctive folk character became attached to their Calvinistic beliefs.

This folk religion was not articulated in a formal way. It was the experience of the Afrikaners, which they interpreted through their assurance that their absolutely sovereign Creator and their Lord had shown special grace to them as a particular people.

==Nationalism==
However, the French Revolution brought these habits of thought more self-consciously to the surface. France invaded the Republic of the United Provinces in January 1794, the Stadtholder fled to England and asked the British to send its Navy to take care of the possessions of the United East India Company that was in dire financial straits and in which the Stadtholder had a huge stake. The British took care of the Cape of Good Hope in 1795 and handed it back to the Batavian Republic after the Peace of Amiens in 1802. For about a year and a half, Enlightenment ideas were promoted by Janssens and De Mist, including changes in church government. In 1806, the British re-captured the Cape of Good Hope on its own, and appointed British administrators there, who were zealous propagators of the Enlightenment. They loosened the trade and labour regulations, speaking of the blacks as those whose untainted natural souls they professed to admire. The British government outlawed slavery in parts of the British Empire in 1833 with enforcement in the Cape Colony in 1834. They called the blacks equals, and gave them access to the courts in suit against white landowners. And, they professed to believe in their own autonomous reason above all else.

A more antithetical message could hardly be imagined, as the British Enlightenment found itself with the Afrikaners for the first time. From the Boer (meaning farmer in Dutch and Afrikaans) point of view, the Enlightenment had resulted in a foreign power ruling over them, imposing alien laws and alien languages, liberated their slaves without compensation, and put the interest of English-speakers over those of the Dutch-speakers. They were exposed to the Enlightenment, and it appeared to them to be a revolution against their God and way of life.

== Schism between Boer and Cape Calvinists ==

During the Great Trek, many people, mostly from the eastern part of the Cape Colony, went north, to areas not under control of the British colonies authorities. Because the Cape Dutch Reformed Church was seen by the trekkers as being an agent of the Cape government, they also did not trust its ministers and emissaries, seeing them as attempts by the Cape government to regain political control. There were also religious divisions among the trekkers themselves. A minister from the Netherlands, Dirk Van der Hoff went to the Transvaal in 1853, and became a minister in the Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk, which was constituted in 1856, and in 1860 recognised as the State Church of the South African Republic (also known as the Transvaal), separate from the Cape Church.

Meanwhile, back in the Netherlands, the Dutch State church had also been transformed by the Enlightenment, a change represented in the minds of those opposed it, by the loss of any meaningful profession of faith as requisite for adult church members, and the singing of hymns (in addition to psalms) and other innovations in worship and doctrine. In the Netherlands a movement grew in reaction to this perceived dismantlement of Biblical faith. It was called the Afscheiding, in which the Rev. Hendrik de Cock separated himself from the State Church in 1834 in Ulrum, Groningen. There was also a movement called the Reveil (&quot;Awakening&quot;), supported by those who did not separate from the State Church, like Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer, whose writings became known in South Africa. And much later the leader of another schism called the Doleantie, Abraham Kuyper, began to become known to the Afrikaners. Highly critical of the Enlightenment, the &quot;revolution&quot; as they called it, the Doleantie in the church had counterparts in education and in politics. The timing of this influence was significant, coming on the crest of a wave of evangelical revival, the Reveil in the Dutch Reformed Church, which had been led in South Africa by the Scottish preacher, Andrew Murray. The slogan of the Doleantie, which eventually rang with unintended nationalist nuance for the Afrikaners was, &quot;Separation is Strength&quot;.

==Doppers==
In the South African Dutch Reformed Church in Transvaal, the more conservative party (known as Doppers) were opposed to singing some hymns in church. They asked the Afgescheiden Gereformeerde Kerk in the Netherlands to provide them with a minister. The Rev. Dirk Postma came from Zwolle to the South African Republic in 1858, and was accepted as a minister of the Hervormde Kerk, but on learning that he and his congregation could be required to sing hymns (rather than the Psalms only), he and the Doppers, numbering about 300 adults, among whom was the South African Republic&#x27;s President Paul Kruger, broke away from the state church to form the Gereformeerde Kerk in Rustenburg in February 1859. There were thus now three Dutch Reformed Churches in South Africa – the Afrikaner Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk (the Cape Synod), the Boer Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk, which was the State Church of the South African Republic, and the Boer Gereformeerde Kerk, the smallest of the three, led by Rev. Postma.

The originally contemptuous name, &quot;Dopper&quot;, may come from the Dutch &quot;domp&quot; (&quot;wick-snuffers&quot;) for their opposition to candles and other innovations in worship, perhaps representing their contempt for the Enlightenment; or, &quot;Dopper&quot; may originate from Dutch &quot;dop&quot; (and thus &quot;drinkers&quot;), perhaps on account of their strong opposition to small, individual communion cups.

The separatism of the Doppers, expressed in the severity of their doctrine, the austere puritanism of their worship, and even in their distinctive dress and speech, set them in stark contrast to European influence. Nevertheless, the Doppers were symbolic of resistance to all things English in South Africa, and despite their small size and distinctiveness they were culturally sophisticated and disproportionately influential during and after the Great Trek. It was the Dopper church that established Potchefstroom University.

Boer Republics which arose after the Great Trek needed a comprehensive philosophy upon which to organise a puritanical Boer society. Paul Kruger, first president of the South African Republic upon its reacquired independence after the brief British annexation, adopted the Calvinistic principles in its political form, and formulated a &quot;cultural mandate&quot; based on the Voortrekkers&#x27; conviction that they had a special calling from God, not unlike the people of Israel in the Bible. The Doppers waged an intellectual war against the perceived influx of uitlander culture which was flooding into the Transvaal through the mass settlements of foreign immigrants lured by gold and diamonds.

==Afrikaner Broederbond==
The Boer Wars had left many of the Afrikaners utterly destitute. The ruined farmers were seen in the hundreds, following the war, lining the highways selling produce by the basket. After the four South African colonies united politically into the Union of South Africa and relinquished control to democratic elections, a small, anonymous group of young intellectuals called the Afrikaner Broederbond, formed in the years following the Second Anglo-Boer War to discuss strategies for addressing the overwhelming social problem of &quot;poor whites&quot; and other Afrikaner interests. By the account of Irving Hexham, according to Klaus Venter and Hendrick Stoker who were themselves disgruntled members of the secret organisation, in 1927 the Broederbond moved to Potchefstroom University, asking that the school would take over leadership of the then-struggling group. That year, the Broederbond formally adopted the Calvinist philosophy based on the work of Abraham Kuyper. The Broederbond believed, with deep-rooted conviction, that what their past had provided them through the interpretation of faith was a model of anti-imperialism, self-discipline and responsibility, which in the end would preserve justice for all – blacks, coloured, and whites – against Communist deceit. These strategies that arose from the Broederbond were directly responsible for the establishment of apartheid, in 1948.

After the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, under enormous international pressure, the Broederbond began a slow and quiet re-examination of their policy proposals. And yet no significant changes took place to reform the apartheid system until the Soweto riots in 1976. Some time after this, the Broederbond declared apartheid an irreformable failure and began work to dismantle it. The conviction had finally become established, although not universally that, if the Afrikaner people, language and religion were to survive, they must take the initiative to emerge from the laager, and invite South Africa in. The Broederbond (dropping the policy of secrecy and with the new name &quot;Afrikanerbond&quot;) began proposing initiatives for land reform and the reversal of apartheid.

==Radical changes==
The reversal of apartheid has cast the Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk (NGK) into a period of change. While remaining confessionally Calvinist, the religious character of the church is now less cohesive and more difficult to assess. Having been thoroughly conflated with apartheid, historic Calvinism appears to have fallen out of favour. Liberation theology, which attempts to reconcile Christianity with the Marxist doctrine of class struggle, has gained a foothold in some quarters, and appears to have advocates on both the left and right ends of the political spectrum. American-style evangelicalism and Arminianism also appear to have made inroads, which with its more individualistic emphasis has less potential for a full-scale civil religion. Certainly the old synthesis of revealed and natural theology is largely repudiated; officially at least. But, the folk religion of the Afrikaners is not dead. Some scholars are attempting to draw lines of distinction between Calvinism &quot;per se&quot;, the history of the Afrikaners, and the civil religion of the apartheid regime in particular.

In 1985, 92% of Afrikaners were members of Reformed Churches. By late 2013, this figure had dropped to 40%, while actual weekly church attendance of Reformed Churches is estimated to be around 25%.

<doc id="87533" wikidata="Q851493" url="?curid=87533" title="Bujinkan">
<text>The is an international martial arts organization based in Japan and headed by Masaaki Hatsumi. The combat system taught by this organization comprises nine separate ryūha, or schools, which are collectively referred to as &quot;Bujinkan Budō Taijutsu&quot;. The Bujinkan is most commonly associated with ninjutsu. However, Masaaki Hatsumi uses the term Budo (meaning martial way) as he says the ryūha are descended from historical samurai schools that teach samurai martial tactics and ninjutsu schools that teach ninja tactics.

==Training==
The Bujinkan organization incorporates the teachings of the martial arts lineages &quot;(ryūha)&quot; that Masaaki Hatsumi learned from Takamatsu Toshitsugu under the banner of Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu. 
These are:

*Togakure Ryū Ninpō Taijutsu (戸隠流忍法体術)
*Gyokushin Ryū Ninpō (玉心流忍法)
*Kumogakure Ryū Ninpō (雲隠流忍法)
*Kotō Ryū Koppō jutsu (虎倒流骨法術)
*Gyokko Ryū Kosshi jutsu (玉虎流骨指術)
*Kuki Shinden Ryū Happō Bikenjutsu (九鬼神伝流八法秘剣術)
*Shinden Fudo Ryū Dakentai jutsu (神伝不動流打拳体術)
*Takagi Yoshin Ryū Jūtai jutsu (高木揚心流柔体術)
*Gikan Ryū Koppō jutsu (義鑑流骨法術)

At around the time of Hatsumi&#x27;s 88th birthday (Beiju: :ja:米寿) on 2 December 2019, he announced his successors for most of the above schools:

*Togakure-ryū: Tsutsui Takumi
*Gyokushin-ryū: Kan Jun&#x27;ichi
*Kumogakure-ryū: Furuta Kōji
*Kotō-ryū: Noguchi Yukio
*Gyokko-ryū: Ishizuka Tetsuji
*Kukishin-ryū: Iwata Yoshio
*Shinden Fudō-ryū: Nagato Toshirō
*Takagi Yōshin-ryū: Sakasai Norio
*Gikan-ryū: Sakasai Norio

Bujinkan Budō Taijutsu training does not include participation in competitions or contests, as the school&#x27;s training aims to develop the ability to protect oneself and others using techniques that focus on disabling an attacker (and/or removing their desire/ability to continue) as quickly and efficiently as possible.

This training is conducted in a manner in which there are predefined &quot;attackers&quot; (&quot;tori&quot;) and &quot;receivers&quot; (&quot;uke&quot;) similar to drills in judo (gokyo) or traditional Japanese martial arts. However, the Bujinkan differs from many traditional martial arts in that the training progresses through the following stages:
*Predefined sets of movements (kata) and physical conditioning
*Variations to the fixed drills (henka), responding to changes in the attacker&#x27;s movements or situation
*Free form training (randori) consisting mostly of spur-of-the-moment, dynamic techniques during which the defender hits, locks, chokes or throws the attacker in a controlled and safe manner
*More advanced training consists of controlling the attacker&#x27;s mind using various techniques such as pain compliance and deception
Training is done in a manner that entails little risk of permanent injury.

The Bujinkan does not adhere to any official guideline or set of rules to limit actions or techniques used during training. The approach used in the Bujinkan includes gaining compliance through pain and utilising potentially damaging techniques in order to survive dangerous situations rather than focusing on winning a competition or evenly matched duel.
As a result, many of the staple responses of a Bujinkan student would be inappropriate in most competitions, but in ring environment the principles of the training can be employed. One mainstay criticism of Bujinkan training, which is a misconception is that it does not necessarily involve testing techniques (locks, throws, chokes, strikes, etc.) against a fully resisting opponent. This is purely subjective to the instructor and individual practitioner. Bujinkan is widely practiced and utilized by law enforcement, government agencies, military and military contractors, and those in private security. 

The Bujinkan largely focuses on “taijutsu” (body movement / skills) as well as other skills of &quot;ninjutsu&quot; (&quot;ninpo&quot; tactics and strategies) and &quot;happo biken jutsu&quot; (various modern and traditional weapons) - this is The Bujinkan&#x27;s branch of Kukishin-ryū

===Taijutsu===
&quot;Taijutsu&quot; (body combat art) is the Bujinkan system of unarmed defence using strikes, throws, holds, chokes and joint locks. It encompasses skill such as: &quot;koppo jutsu&quot; is the &quot;way of attacking and/or using the skeletal structure&quot;; &quot;koshi jutsu&quot; is the way of attacking muscles and weak points on the body; &quot;jutai jutsu&quot; is the &quot;relaxed body method&quot; teaching throwing, grappling and choking techniques and &quot;dakentai jutsu&quot; which emphasises strikes, kicks and blocks

The first levels of training, such as leaping, tumbling, break fall techniques and body conditioning, form the basis for &quot;taijutsu&quot;. They are needed to progress into other techniques such as unarmed combat and the use of tools and weapons. Once learned, &quot;Taijutsu&quot; techniques can be applied to any situation, armed or unarmed.

====&quot;Tori&quot; and &quot;Uke&quot;====
Training begins with two partners practicing pre-arranged forms (&quot;waza&quot; or &quot;kata&quot;) and then advancing to unlimited variations of those forms (&quot;henka&quot;). The basic pattern is for the Tori (&quot;Tori&quot;, or the person applying the technique) to initiate a technique against the person who receives the technique (&quot;Uke&quot;).

====&quot;Ukemi&quot; and balance====
Bujinkan &quot;taijutsu&quot; seeks to use body movement and positioning rather than strength to defeat the opponent. All techniques in Bujinkan &quot;taijutsu&quot; involve unbalancing the opponent while maintaining one&#x27;s own balance. This is achieved by moving the opponent into inferior positions and manipulating their body along weak lines where it is difficult for the opponent to resist. The attacker continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (such as an exposed side), while the defender uses position and timing to keep the attacker off balance and vulnerable. In more advanced training, the attacker will sometimes apply to regain balance and disable the defender.

 refers to the act of receiving a technique. Good &quot;ukemi&quot; involves a roll or breakfall to avoid pain or injury such as dislocation of a joint. Thus, learning to roll and breakfall effectively is key to safe training in &quot;taijutsu&quot;. Before receiving the 9th &quot;kyu&quot; (the lowest rank), a student must demonstrate the ability to roll smoothly in a variety of directions without exposing the neck to injury.

===Physical conditioning===
&quot;Junan taiso&quot; (&quot;junan&quot; meaning flexible) is a yogic method of stretching and breathing by means of which the Bujinkan practitioner may develop and maintain good physical condition and wellbeing. The exercises promote relaxation, blood circulation, muscle toning and flexibility, and form a core part of all training sessions. &quot;Junan taiso&quot; is a form of conditioning and preparation for the body. All major joints are rotated and stretched in a proper manner while healthy breathing and concentration are practiced.

===Origins===
Almost all of the martial arts/ryuha in the Bujinkan are listed with their historical lineages in the &quot;Bugei Ryuha Daijiten&quot; (&quot;Encyclopedia of Martial Art Schools&quot;, researched by Watatani Kiyoshi and Yamada Tadashi and first published in 1963). From 1968 on (4 years before Takamatsu&#x27;s death), the &quot;Bugei Ryuha Daijiten&quot; has had entries for Hatsumi below Takamatsu.

Several Bujinkan &quot;ryūha&quot; were mentioned in the &quot;Kakutogi no Rekishi&quot; (&quot;History of Fighting Arts&quot;). Although details are omitted, it states, &quot;there are several schools that are well-known for being &#x27;effective arts&#x27; (jitsuryoku ha)&quot;. Among the schools listed in this section are Gyokko Ryū, Gikan-ryū Koppō jutsu, Gyokushin-ryū Ninpō, Kukishin-ryū, Takagi Yōshin-ryū Jūtai jutsu and Asayama Ichiden-ryū (which is not part of the Bujinkan&#x27;s nine schools but was studied by Hatsumi via Takashi Ueno).

Several of the samurai systems taught by Hatsumi such as Kuki Shinden Ryū Happō Bikenjutsu and Takagi Yoshin Ryū Jūtai jutsu have well documented lineages with different branches of these arts surviving under their own Sōke. However, whilst the ninja&#x27;s activities are well documented, the nature of ninjutsu &amp; the historical context means that there are no surviving written records of ninjutsu teachings prior to 1676. As a result, some researchers assert that there is no way to independently verify the oral lineage included in the Togakure Ryu tradition.

In the &quot;Bugei Ryuha Daijiten&quot; the researchers list the full lineage for Togakure-ryū stating the following: &quot;The succession is an oral tradition from Toda Shinryūken. Toda Shinryūken Masamitsu died in 1908 at the age of 90 years. According to the lineage, Ikai originated the school, and in the Yōwa period (1181–1182), it separated from Hakuun Dōshi of Hakuun-ryū and became the Kōga and Iga schools of ninjutsu. The lineage passed through Momochi Sandayū and entered into the Natori-ryū of Kishū domain. From the time of Toda Nobutsuna, the tradition was passed on to the Toda family. This genealogy refers to dates and kuden (orally transmitted stories/lessons) about people implying that these people were older than written records would suggest&quot;

The entry regarding Gyokko Ryu is as follows: &quot;Receiving the tradition of Gyokko ryu Shitojutsu from Sakagami Taro Kunishige of the Tenbun era, Toda Sakyo Ishinsai established Gyokko ryu Koshijutsu as well as Koto ryu Koppojutsu, passing them on to Momochi Sandayu, bringing them within the traditions of Iga ryu Ninjutsu of Toda Shinryuken who lived during the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate (ended 1868). It is said that Toda Shinryuken died in the 14th year of the Meiji Emperor (1881) at the age of 90 years.&quot;

The entry regarding Koto Ryu is as follows: &quot;The genesis of koppoujutsu is said to have been in ancient China. Koto ryu was brought to our country by a Chan Bushou* of Korea, after this it was brought within the traditions of Iga ryu Ninjutsu, and it’s revitalization in the Tenbun era is said to have been from Momochi Sandayu inheriting the tradition from Toda Sakyo Ishinsai (oral tradition from Toda Shinryuken).&quot;

===Recent history===
Since 1988, Hatsumi&#x27;s teaching has focused on a particular theme, or focus, each year. This typically means that a specific ryū, or a certain set of techniques from specific ryū, will be taught. Hatsumi announces the year&#x27;s theme each year at the Daikomyosai.

Depending on what years a student has studied in Japan, they may find that their focus reflects the themes or schools taught during their time. This is one reason why there are often noticeable differences in the techniques of different teachers in the Bujinkan. Although Ninpo Taijutsu is an overall theme of the Bujinkan, 2008 marked the first time that a Ninpo Taijutsu Ryū was the focus of the year. Prior to founding the Bujinkan organization and teaching the nine Ryū collectively (with particular yearly focus), Hatsumi awarded his students rank certificates in individual Ryū. The themes so far have been:

* 2019 - Muto Dori Continued
* 2018 - Muto Dori Continued
* 2017 - Muto Dori
* 2015 - Nagamaki
* 2014 – 神韻武導 Shin In Bu Dou / 神 SHIN, JIN god, deity; mind, soul / 韻 IN rhyme; elegance; tone / 武 BU, MU martial, military arts, chivalry. Bu or Mu refers to the warrior, Bushi or Musha / 導 DŌ leading, guiding.
* 2013 – Ken Engetsu no Kagami (&quot;mirror of the fullmoon sword&quot;)/ Tachi Hôken (&quot;divine treasure sword&quot;)— Ken, Tachi, and Katana/ Naginata and Yari
* 2012 – Jin Ryo Yo Go - Kaname, Sword and Rokushakubo, separately and with one in each hand
* 2011 – Kihon Happo
* 2010 – Rokkon Shoujou
* 2009 – 才能 魂 器 ”saino konki”/ Talent, Heart, Capacity / Talent, Soul, Capacity
* 2008 – Togakure-ryū Ninpō Taijutsu
* 2007 – Kukishin Ryu
* 2006 – Shinden Fudo Ryu
* 2005 – Gyokko-ryū Kosshi jutsu (Bo and Tachi)
* 2004 – Daishou Juutai jutsu (Roppo-Kuji-no Biken)
* 2003 – Juppo Sessho
* 2002 – Jutai jutsu (Takagi Yoshin Ryu)
* 2001 – Kosshi jutsu (Gyokko Ryu)
* 2000 – Koppo jutsu (Koto Ryu)
* 1999 – Kukishinden Ryu
* 1998 – Shinden Fudo Ryu
* 1997 – Jojutsu
* 1996 – Bokken
* 1995 – Naginata
* 1994 – Yari
* 1993 – Rokushakubojutsu
* 1992 – Taijutsu Power
* 1991 – Sword and Jutte
* 1990 – Hanbo
* 1989 – Taijutsu and Weapons
* 1988 – Taijutsu

No focus was announced for 2009, though Hatsumi talked about three things that are important for a martial artist, which may be loosely considered to be the yearly theme. He said that these things would become a bit of a theme for next year.
*&quot;Sainou&quot; (Ability/talent)
*&quot;Kokoro&quot; (Heart)
*&quot;Utsuwa&quot; (Capacity)

Soon after this theme as was announced, Hatsumi proposed that the second aspect, &quot;Kokoro&quot; (Heart), be replaced by &quot;Tamashii&quot; (Soul), reasoning that the heart is constantly changing, whereas the soul is permanent and unchanging and therefore &quot;essential to the person&quot;.

==Ninpo==

===Gyokushin-ryū Ninpō===
&quot;Gyokushin-ryū Ninpō&quot; (&quot;The Jeweled Heart School&quot;) is taught by the Bujinkan martial arts organization. According to the Bujinkan, Gyokushin Ryu has sutemi waza techniques and is focused more on the art and techniques of espionage than on fighting. Its most prominent weapon is the lasso (&quot;nagenawa&quot;). The &quot;Bugei Ryuha Daijiten&quot; states that Takamatsu Toshitsugu transferred the Gyokushin-ryū Ninpō to Hatsumi in the middle of the 20th century, making Hatsumi its lineage holder. Gyokushin-ryū Ninpō is taught today in the Bujinkan organization. According to the Bujinkan martial arts organization, Gyokushin-ryū was founded in the mid-16th century by Sasaki Goeman Teruyoshi, who was also &quot;sōke&quot; of Gyokko-ryū, which explains the similarities between the two styles. Gyokushin-ryū is considered a style of &quot;koshi jutsu&quot;. Hatsumi is the 21st &quot;sōke&quot;.

===Togakure-ryū===
According to Bujinkan members, &quot;Ninja Jūhakkei&quot; (the eighteen disciplines) were first identified in the scrolls of , or &quot;School of the Hidden Door&quot;, founded during the Oho period by one Daisuke Nishina (Togakure), who learned a life view and techniques (&quot;ninjutsu&quot;) from Kagakure Doshi. &quot;Togakure ryu Ninjutsu Hidensho&quot; is a manuscript in Hatsumi&#x27;s possession that is said to document &quot;Togakure-ryū&quot;. It is the purported origin of the &quot;18 skills of Ninjutsu.&quot;

&quot;Ninja jūhakkei&quot; was often studied along with &quot;Bugei jūhappan&quot; (the 18 samurai fighting art skills). Though some techniques were used in the same way by both samurai and ninja, others were used differently by the two groups. The 18 disciplines are:

#&quot;Seishinteki kyōyō&quot; (spiritual refinement)
#&quot;Taijutsu&quot; (unarmed combat)
#&quot;Kenjutsu&quot; (sword techniques including Tojutsu)
#&quot;Bōjutsu&quot; (stick and staff techniques)
#&quot;Sōjutsu&quot; (spear techniques)
#&quot;Naginatajutsu&quot; (&quot;naginata&quot; techniques)
#&quot;Kusarigamajutsu&quot; (&quot;kusarigama&quot; techniques)
#&quot;Shurikenjutsu&quot; (throwing weapons techniques)
#&quot;Kayakujutsu&quot; (pyrotechnics)
#&quot;Hensōjutsu&quot; (disguise and impersonation)
#&quot;&quot; (stealth and entering methods)
#&quot;Bajutsu&quot; (horsemanship)
#&quot;Sui-ren&quot; (water training)
#&quot;Bōryaku&quot; (tactics)
#&quot;Chōhō&quot; (espionage)
#&quot;Intonjutsu&quot; (escaping and concealment)
#&quot;Tenmon&quot; (meteorology)
#&quot;Chi-mon&quot; (geography)

The name of the discipline of , literally means &quot;body skill&quot;. Historically in Japan, the word is often used interchangeably with jujutsu and many others to refer to a range of grappling skills. It is also used in the martial art of aikido to distinguish unarmed fighting techniques from others, such as those of stick fighting. In &quot;ninjutsu&quot;, especially since the emergence of the Ninja movie genre, it was used to avoid referring explicitly to &quot;ninja&quot; combat techniques.

==Uniforms and rankings==

===Kyu levels===
The Bujinkan Dōjō has a series of &quot;kyū&quot; (grades) below the level of &quot;shodan&quot;. The new student starts at &quot;mukyu&quot; (&quot;without grade&quot;) and progresses from &quot;kukyu&quot; (9-kyu), the lowest rank, to &quot;ikkyu&quot; (1-kyu), the highest. Unranked (&quot;mukyū&quot;) practitioners wear white belts, kyu grade practitioners wear green belts (men) or red belts (women), and those with ranks of &quot;shōdan&quot; and above wear black belts. In some dojos kyu-level practitioners – especially in children&#x27;s classes – wear colored belts, though the actual color of the belt varies from place to place. In Japan it was once customary for kyu-level men to wear green belts over a black ninjutsugi and women to wear red belts over a purple ninjutsugi, but this practice has largely been abandoned. Currently, both male and female Bujinkan practitioners now wear green belts over a black ninjutsugi and on the feet they wear tabi (soft-sole &quot;tabi&quot; for indoor training and &quot;jika-tabi&quot; for outdoor training) at most dojos.

===Dan levels===
There are Ten dan grades in the Bujinkan, with the final JuDan level having additional five levels of rank. With the exception of fifth dan (see below) there are no fixed criteria for attaining each grade. Different dojos have their own approaches based on the cultural environment and the instructor&#x27;s preference.

Typically the study of &quot;tenchijin ryaku no maki&quot; (scrolls of heaven, earth and man) guides progression from 9-kyu to shodan (1st dan) and comprises all the fundamental techniques required for advanced study thereafter. Until 4th dan the student is expected to focus on developing strong foundations and to perfect their form. At 5th dan the training focus changes to becoming more responsive and responding naturally in dynamic &amp; increasingly challenging situations.

In order to attain fifth dan (&quot;godan&quot;), fourth dan practitioners must submit to a &quot;sakki&quot; (or &quot;godan&quot;) test before the &quot;sōke&quot; to establish that they are able to sense the presence of danger and evade it, which is considered a fundamental survival skill. After passing this test, a practitioner is considered to be under the protection of the &quot;Bujin&quot;, or Guiding Spirits, and is entitled to apply for a teaching license (&quot;shidōshi menkyo&quot;). A &quot;shidōshi&quot; (士道師) is entitled to open their own Bujinkan &quot;dōjō&quot; and grade students up to fourth dan. A practitioner between first dan and fourth dan may become a licensed assistant teacher (&quot;shidōshi-ho&quot;) if backed by and acting under the supervision of a &quot;shidōshi&quot;. In the Bujinkan, a person ranked tenth dan or higher is often referred to as a &quot;shihan&quot;.

The practitioner&#x27;s level is displayed by the color of the art&#x27;s emblem, called &quot;wappen&quot; (ワッペン) inscribed with the kanji &quot;bu&quot;(武) and &quot;jin&quot; (神). There are four kinds of &quot;wappen&quot; (9 to 1 &quot;kyū&quot;, 1 to 4 &quot;dan&quot;, 5 to 9 &quot;dan&quot;, and 10 &#x27;dan’. Following 10 Dan, Chi, Sun, Ka, Fu, and Ku), sometimes augmented with up to four silver, gold or white stars (called &quot;hoshi&quot;) above or around the emblem, representing the individual ranks.

In addition to the kyu/dan system, a few practitioners have earned &quot;menkyo kaiden&quot; &quot;licenses of complete transmission&quot; in individual schools. These establish that the master practitioner has learned all that there is to learn about the particular lineage. Whereas the kyu/dan ranks are often made public, those who have earned &quot;menkyo kaiden&quot; rarely divulge their status, sometimes even being reluctant to recognize their actual dan ranking to outsiders.

==Criticism of historical claims==
Modern Togakure-ryu and various historical claims are taught by Masaaki Hatsumi (Takamatsu&#x27;s successor) and the Bujinkan organization. Criticism regarding the historical accuracy of the Bujinkan&#x27;s claims of lineage have arisen from several issues of the &quot;Bugei Ryūha Daijiten&quot;:

* The 1978 version of the &quot;Bugei Ryūha Daijiten&quot; states that Takamatsu&#x27;s Togakure-ryu &quot;genealogy includes embellishments by referring to data and kuden about persons whose existence is based on written materials and traditions in order to appear older than it actually is.&quot;
* The 1969 version of the &quot;Bugei Ryūha Daijiten&quot; states that Takamatsu&#x27;s Togakure-ryu &quot;is a genealogy newly put together by Takamatsu Toshitsugu, who made use of (took advantage of) the popularity of written materials on ninjutsu after the Taishō era&quot; and that &quot;there are many points where it has added embellishments, it has made people whose real existence is based on written records older than is actually the case, and so it is a product of very considerable labor&quot;.
* The 1963 version of the &quot;Bugei Ryūha Daijiten&quot; states of Takamatsu&#x27;s Togakure-ryu &quot;this genealogy refers to various written records and oral transmissions and there are many points/places where embellishments have been added and people appearing in the genealogy are also made older than they actually are&quot;.

Watatani questioned whether there was enough evidence that Togakure ryū was an unbroken tradition since the 12th C, but he did not doubt that Togakure ryū was an art that pre-dated the Meiji period.

<text>Nicholas Edward Cave (born 22 September 1957) is an Australian musician, writer and actor who fronts the rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Known for his baritone voice, Cave&#x27;s music is characterised by emotional intensity, a wide variety of influences and lyrical obsessions with death, religion, love, and violence.

Born and raised in rural Victoria, Cave studied art in Melbourne before fronting the Birthday Party, one of the city&#x27;s leading post-punk bands, in the late 1970s. In 1980, the band moved to London, England. Disillusioned by their stay there, they evolved towards a darker and more challenging sound that helped inspire gothic rock, and they acquired a reputation as &quot;the most violent live band in the world&quot;. Cave became recognised for his confrontational performances, his shock of black hair and pale, emaciated look. The band broke up soon after relocating to West Berlin in 1982. The following year, Cave formed Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, later described as one of rock&#x27;s &quot;most redoubtable, enduring&quot; bands. Much of their early material is set in a mythic American Deep South, drawing on spirituals and Delta blues, while Cave&#x27;s preoccupation with Old Testament notions of good versus evil culminated in what has been called his signature song, &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot; (1988), and in his debut novel, &quot;And the Ass Saw the Angel&quot; (1989). In 1988, he appeared in &quot;Ghosts… of the Civil Dead&quot;, an Australian prison film which he both co-wrote and scored.

The 1990s saw Cave move between São Paulo and England, and find inspiration in the New Testament. He went on to achieve mainstream success with quieter, piano-driven ballads, notably the Kylie Minogue duet &quot;Where the Wild Roses Grow&quot; (1996), and &quot;Into My Arms&quot; (1997). Turning increasingly to film in the 2000s, Cave wrote the Australian Western &quot;The Proposition&quot; (2005), also composing its soundtrack with frequent collaborator Warren Ellis. The pair&#x27;s film score credits include &quot;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford&quot; (2007), &quot;The Road&quot; (2009) and &quot;Hell or High Water&quot; (2016). Their garage rock side project Grinderman has released two studio albums since 2006. In 2009, he released his second novel, &quot;The Death of Bunny Munro&quot;, and starred in the semi-fictional &quot;day in the life&quot; film &quot;20,000 Days on Earth&quot; (2014). His more recent musical work features ambient and electronic elements, as well as increasingly abstract lyrics, informed in part by grief over his son Arthur&#x27;s 2015 death, which is explored in the documentary &quot;One More Time with Feeling&quot; (2016) and the Bad Seeds&#x27; 2019 album &quot;Ghosteen&quot;. The band&#x27;s 18th and latest album, &quot;Wild God&quot;, was released in 2024.

Since 2018, Cave has maintained &quot;The Red Hand Files&quot;, a newsletter he uses to respond to questions from fans. He has collaborated with the likes of Johnny Cash, Shane MacGowan and ex-partner PJ Harvey. His songs have also been covered by a wide range of artists, including Cash (&quot;The Mercy Seat&quot;), Metallica (&quot;Loverman&quot;) and Snoop Dogg (&quot;Red Right Hand&quot;). He was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2007, and he was named an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2017.

== Early life and education ==

Nicholas Edward Cave was born on 22 September 1957 in Warracknabeal, a country town in the Australian state of Victoria, to Dawn Cave (née Treadwell) and Colin Frank Cave. He has two older brothers, Tim (born 1952) and Peter (born 1954), and a younger sister, Julie (born 1959). As a child, he lived in Warracknabeal and then Wangaratta in rural Victoria. 

His father taught English and mathematics at the local technical school; his mother was a librarian at the high school that Cave attended. From an early age, Cave&#x27;s father read him literary classics, such as &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; (1866) and &quot;Lolita&quot; (1955), and also organised the first symposium on the Australian bushranger and outlaw Ned Kelly, with whom Cave was enamoured as a child. Through his older brother, Cave became a fan of British progressive rock bands such as King Crimson, Pink Floyd and Jethro Tull, while a childhood girlfriend introduced him to the Canadian folk artist Leonard Cohen, who he later described as &quot;the greatest songwriter of them all&quot;.

When Cave was nine he joined the choir of Wangaratta&#x27;s Holy Trinity Cathedral. At 13 he was expelled from Wangaratta High School, and sent by his parents to Melbourne to become a boarder and later day student at Caulfield Grammar School. His family moved to Melbourne the following year, settling in the suburb of Murrumbeena. After his secondary schooling, Cave studied painting at the Caulfield Institute of Technology in 1976, but dropped out the following year to pursue music. He also began using heroin around the time that he left art school.

Cave attended his first music concert at Melbourne&#x27;s Festival Hall. The bill consisted of the English rock bands Manfred Mann, Deep Purple and Free. Cave recalled: &quot;I remember sitting there and feeling physically the sound going through me.&quot; In early 1977, he saw the Australian punk rock bands Radio Birdman and the Saints live for the first time. Cave was particularly inspired by the show of the latter band, saying that he left the venue &quot;a different person.&quot;

Cave was 19 when his father was killed in a car collision; his mother told him of his father&#x27;s death while she was bailing him out of a St Kilda police station where he was being held on a charge of burglary.
He would later recall that his father &quot;died at a point in my life when I was most confused&quot; and that &quot;the loss of my father created in my life a vacuum, a space in which my words began to float and collect and find their purpose&quot;.

== Music career ==
=== Early years and the Birthday Party (1973–1983) ===
In 1973, Cave founded a band with fellow students at Caulfield Grammar. With Cave as lead vocalist, the band included Mick Harvey (guitar), Phill Calvert (drums), John Cochivera (guitar), Brett Purcell (bass guitar), and Chris Coyne (saxophone). Their repertoire consisted of cover versions of songs by Lou Reed, David Bowie, Alice Cooper, Roxy Music and Alex Harvey, among others. Later, the line-up slimmed down to four members including Cave&#x27;s friend Tracy Pew on bass guitar. In 1977, after leaving school, they adopted the name the Boys Next Door and began playing predominantly original punk rock material. Guitarist, songwriter and ex-Young Charlatans member Rowland S. Howard joined the band in 1978.
The Boys Next Door emerged as the linchpin of the Melbourne post-punk scene in the late 1970s, securing a residency at St Kilda&#x27;s Crystal Ballroom venue, where they attracted a cult following. They played hundreds of live shows in Australia and toured interstate before changing their name to the Birthday Party in 1980 and moving to London, England. Cave&#x27;s girlfriend and muse Anita Lane accompanied the band. They struggled initially with financial instability and limited connections, and grew to detest London and much of its music scene, which Cave later described as &quot;dead, ... we felt really ripped off, robbed&quot;. He did however greatly admire the Pop Group, and the Birthday Party shared a mutual affinity with the Fall.

By the end of their first year in London, the Birthday Party had gained notoriety for their aggressive, confrontational live shows and Cave&#x27;s unhinged stage presence, with him shrieking, bellowing and throwing himself about the stage, backed up by harsh pounding rock music laced with guitar feedback. Drawing on Old Testament imagery, Cave&#x27;s lyrics frequently revolved around sin, debauchery and damnation. The band found a champion in prominent radio DJ and taste-maker John Peel, and went on to record four Peel Sessions.

Cave&#x27;s droll sense of humour and penchant for parody is evident in many of the band&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Nick the Stripper&quot; and &quot;King Ink&quot;. &quot;Release the Bats&quot;, one of the band&#x27;s most famous songs and John Peel&#x27;s single of the year in 1981, was intended as an over-the-top &quot;piss-take&quot; on gothic rock, and a &quot;direct attack&quot; on the &quot;stock gothic associations that less informed critics were wont to make&quot;. Ironically, it became highly influential on the genre, giving rise to a new generation of bands in England.

The Birthday Party relocated to West Berlin in 1982. After establishing a cult following in Europe, Australia and the United States, they disbanded in the following year.

=== Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (1984–present) ===
The band with Cave as their lead vocalist has released eighteen studio albums. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; calls the group one of rock&#x27;s &quot;most enduring, redoubtable&quot; bands, with an accomplished discography. Though their sound tends to change considerably from one album to another, the one constant of the band is an unpolished blending of disparate genres, and song structures which provide a vehicle for Cave&#x27;s virtuosic, frequent histrionics. Critics Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Steve Huey wrote: &quot;With the Bad Seeds, Cave continued to explore his obsessions with religion, death, love, America, and violence with a bizarre, sometimes self-consciously eclectic hybrid of blues, gospel, rock, and arty post-punk.&quot;

Reviewing the band&#x27;s fourteenth studio album &quot;Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!&quot; (2008), &quot;NME&quot; used the phrase &quot;gothic psycho-sexual apocalypse&quot; to describe the &quot;menace&quot; present in the lyrics of the title track. Their most recent work, &quot;Wild God&quot;, was released in August 2024.

In a September 2013 interview, Cave explained that he returned to using a typewriter for songwriting after his experience with their twelfth studio album &quot;Nocturama&quot; (2003), as he &quot;could walk in on a bad day and hit &#x27;delete&#x27; and that was the end of it&quot;. Cave believes that he lost valuable work due to a &quot;bad day&quot;.

=== Grinderman (2006–2010) ===
In 2006, Cave formed Grinderman with himself on vocals, guitar, organ and piano, Warren Ellis (tenor guitar, electric mandolin, violin, viola, guitar, backing vocals), Martyn P. Casey (bass, guitar, backing vocals) and Jim Sclavunos (drums, percussion, backing vocals). The alternative rock outfit was formed as &quot;a way to escape the weight of the Bad Seeds&quot;. The band&#x27;s name was inspired by a Memphis Slim song, &quot;Grinder Man Blues&quot;, which Cave is noted to have started singing during one of the band&#x27;s early rehearsal sessions. The band&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Grinderman&quot;, was released in 2007 to positive reviews and the band&#x27;s second and final studio album, &quot;Grinderman 2&quot;, was released in 2010 to a similar reception.

Grinderman&#x27;s first public performance was at All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties in April 2007, where Bobby Gillespie from Primal Scream accompanied Grinderman on backing vocals and percussion.

In December 2011, after performing at the Meredith Music Festival, Cave announced that Grinderman was over. Two years later, Grinderman performed both weekends at the 2013 Coachella Festival, as did Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.

=== Music in film and television ===
Cave&#x27;s music was featured in a scene of the 1986 film, &quot;Dogs in Space&quot; by Richard Lowenstein. Cave performed parts of the Boys Next Door song &quot;Shivers&quot; twice during the film, once on video and once live.

Another early fan of Cave&#x27;s was German director Wim Wenders, who lists Cave, along with Lou Reed and Portishead, as among his favourites. Cave and the Bad Seeds appear in the 1987 film &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; performing &quot;The Carny&quot; and &quot;From Her to Eternity&quot;. Two original songs were included in Wenders&#x27; 1993 sequel &quot;Faraway, So Close!&quot;, including the title track. The soundtrack for Wenders&#x27; 1991 film &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; features, another Cave original, &quot;(I&#x27;ll Love You) Till the End of the World&quot;. Cave and the Bad Seeds later recorded a live in-studio cover track for Wenders&#x27; 2003 documentary &quot;The Soul of a Man&quot;, and his 2008 film &quot;Palermo Shooting&quot; features two original songs from Cave&#x27;s side project Grinderman.

Cave&#x27;s songs have also appeared in a number of Hollywood blockbusters – &quot;There is a Light&quot; appears on the 1995 soundtrack for &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, and &quot;Red Right Hand&quot; appeared in a number of films including &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; (1994), &quot;The X-Files&quot; (1998); &quot;Scream&quot; (1996), its sequels &quot;Scream 2&quot; (1997) and &quot;3&quot; (2000), and &quot;Hellboy&quot; (2004; performed by Pete Yorn). In &quot;Scream 3&quot;, the song was given a reworking with Cave writing new lyrics and adding an orchestra to the arrangement of the track. &quot;People Ain&#x27;t No Good&quot; was featured in &quot;Shrek 2&quot; (2004). &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; (2010) music supervisor Matt Biffa chose to use Cave&#x27;s &quot;O Children&quot; in the film because it was &quot;really uplifting&quot;.

In 2000, Andrew Dominik used &quot;Release the Bats&quot; in his film &quot;Chopper&quot;. Other films that use Cave&#x27;s songs include &quot;The Freshman&quot; (1990), &quot;Gas Food Lodging&quot; (1992), &quot;Box of Moonlight&quot; (1996), &quot;Kevin &amp; Perry Go Large&quot; (2000), &quot;Mr In-Between&quot; (2001), &quot;Romance &amp; Cigarettes&quot; (2005), &quot;Cirque du Freak: The Vampire&#x27;s Assistant&quot; (2009) and &quot;About Time&quot; (2013).

His music also appear in a number of major television shows, including &quot;Trauma&quot;, &quot;The L Word&quot;, &quot;Traveler&quot;, &quot;The Unit&quot;, &quot;I Love the &#x27;70s&quot;, &quot;The Others&quot;, &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, &quot;Californication&quot;, &quot;After Life&quot; and &quot;Jack Irish&quot;. &quot;Red Right Hand&quot; is the theme song for &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;, which also features cover versions by artists such as his ex-partner PJ Harvey, Arctic Monkeys, Laura Marling, Iggy Pop and Jarvis Cocker of Pulp, Patti Smith and Anna Calvi. In a 2019 interview with &quot;Vice&quot;, Cillian Murphy, who plays Tommy Shelby in &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;, mentioned that Cave personally approved the use of the song for the series after watching a pre-screening of the show.

=== Collaborations ===

==== 1980–2000 ====
During the 1982 recording sessions for the Birthday Party&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Junkyard&quot;, Cave, together with band-mates Harvey and Howard, joined members of the Go-Betweens to form Tuff Monks. The short-lived band released one single, &quot;After the Fireworks&quot;, and played live only once. Later that year, Cave contributed to the concept album &quot;Honeymoon in Red&quot;. Intended as a collaboration between the Birthday Party and Lydia Lunch, the album was not released until 1988, by which time Lunch had fallen out with Cave, who she credits on the release as &quot;Anonymous&quot;, &quot;Her Dead Twin&quot; and &quot;A Drunk Cowboy Junkie&quot;.

During the Birthday Party&#x27;s Berlin period, Cave collaborated with local post-punk and post-rock band Die Haut on their studio album &quot;Burnin&#x27; the Ice&quot;, released in 1983. In the immediate aftermath of the Birthday Party&#x27;s break-up, Cave performed several shows in the United States as part of the Immaculate Consumptive, a short-lived &quot;super-group&quot; with Lunch, Marc Almond and Clint Ruin. Cave sang on an Annie Hogan song called &quot;Vixo&quot; which was recorded in October 1983: the track was released in 1985 on the 12&quot; inch vinyl &quot;Annie Hogan – Plays Kickabye&quot;.
A lifelong fan of Johnny Cash, Cave covered his song &quot;The Singer&quot;, originally &quot;The Folk Singer&quot;, for the studio album &quot;Kicking Against the Pricks&quot; (1986), which Cash seemingly repaid by covering &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot; on &quot;American III: Solitary Man&quot; (2000). Cave was then invited to contribute to the liner notes of the double-compact disc compilation album &quot;The Essential Johnny Cash&quot;, released to coincide with Cash&#x27;s 70th birthday. Subsequently, Cave recorded a duet with Cash, a cover version of Hank Williams&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot;, for what would be Cash&#x27;s final studio album, &quot;American IV: The Man Comes Around&quot; (2002). Another duet between the two artists, the American folk song &quot;Cindy&quot;, was released posthumously on &quot;Unearthed&quot;, a boxset of outtakes. Cave&#x27;s song &quot;Let the Bells Ring&quot;, released on the studio album &quot;Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus&quot; (2004), is a posthumous tribute to Cash.
Cave played with Shane MacGowan on cover versions of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Death is Not the End&quot; and Louis Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;. Cave recorded a cover version of the Pogues&#x27; song &quot;Rainy Night in Soho&quot;, written by MacGowan. MacGowan also sings a version of &quot;Lucy&quot;, released on &quot;B-Sides &amp; Rarities&quot; (2005). Cave provided guest vocals on the title track of Current 93&#x27;s studio album &quot;All the Pretty Little Horses&quot; (1996), as well as the closer &quot;Patripassian&quot;. For his studio album &quot;Murder Ballads&quot; (1996), Cave recorded &quot;Where the Wild Roses Grow&quot; with Kylie Minogue, and &quot;Henry Lee&quot; with PJ Harvey.

Cave also took part in &quot;The X-Files&quot; compilation CD with some other artists, where he reads parts from the Bible combined with own texts, like &quot;Time Jesum ...&quot;, he outed himself as a fan of the series some years ago, but since he does not watch much TV, it was one of the only things he watched.

==== 2000–present (as of 2025) ====
In 2004, Cave gave a hand to Marianne Faithfull on her sixteenth studio album, &quot;Before the Poison&quot;. He co-wrote and produced three songs (&quot;Crazy Love&quot;, &quot;There Is a Ghost&quot; and &quot;Desperanto&quot;), and the Bad Seeds are featured on all of them. He is also featured on &quot;The Crane Wife 3&quot; (originally by the Decemberists), on Faithfull&#x27;s seventeenth studio album, &quot;Easy Come, Easy Go&quot; (2008).

He collaborated on the 2003 single &quot;Bring It On&quot;, with Chris Bailey, formerly of the Australian punk group, the Saints. Cave contributed vocals to the song &quot;Sweet Rosyanne&quot;, on the studio album &quot;Catch That Train!&quot; (2006) by Dan Zanes &amp; Friends, a children&#x27;s music group.

In 2010, Cave began a series of duets with Debbie Harry of Blondie for &quot;The Jeffrey Lee Pierce Sessions Project&quot;.

In 2011, Cave recorded a cover version of the Zombies&#x27; &quot;She&#x27;s Not There&quot; with Neko Case, which was used at the end of the first episode of the fourth season of &quot;True Blood&quot;.

In 2014, Cave wrote the libretto for the opera &quot;Shell Shock&quot; by the Belgian composer Nicholas Lens. The opera premiered at the Royal Opera House La Monnaie in Brussels on 24 October 2014
and was also set up at the international Weekend of War and Peace, Paris on 10 and 11 November 2018 performed by L&#x27; Orchestre philharmonique de Radio France at Cité de la Musique (Philharmonie de Paris) with live television broadcasting on Arte and France Musique.

In 2020, Cave wrote the libretto for &quot;L.I.T.A.N.I.E.S&quot;, a trance-minimal chamber opera by Nicholas Lens. A recording produced by both writers was released by Deutsche Grammophon.

==== Film scores and theatre music ====

Cave creates original film scores with fellow Bad Seeds band member Warren Ellis—they first teamed up in 2005 to work on Hillcoat&#x27;s bushranger film &quot;The Proposition&quot;, for which Cave also wrote the screenplay.

In 2007, Cave and Ellis composed the music for Andrew Dominik&#x27;s adaptation of Ron Hansen&#x27;s &quot;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford&quot;. By the time Dominik&#x27;s film was released, Hillcoat was preparing his next project, &quot;The Road&quot;, an adaptation of Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s novel about a father and son struggling to survive in a post-apocalyptic world. Cave and Ellis wrote and recorded the score for the film, which was released in 2009. In 2011, Cave and Ellis reunited with Hillcoat to score his latest picture, &quot;Lawless&quot;. Cave also authored this screenplay based on Matt Bondurant&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wettest County in the World&quot; (2008). Set in Depression-era Franklin County, Virginia, the film was released in 2012.

In 2016, Cave and Ellis scored the neo-Western film &quot;Hell or High Water&quot;, directed by David Mackenzie. The following year, they scored Taylor Sheridan&#x27;s neo-Western &quot;Wind River&quot;, as well as Australian director David Michôd&#x27;s &quot;War Machine&quot;.

Cave and Ellis have also scored a number of documentary films, including &quot;The English Surgeon&quot; (2007), &quot;West of Memphis&quot; (2012), &quot;Prophet&#x27;s Prey&quot; (2015) and &quot;The Velvet Queen&quot; (2021). Cave and Ellis created music for the Icelandic theatre group Vesturport productions &quot;Woyzeck&quot;, &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; and &quot;Faust&quot;.

== Writing ==
Cave released his first book, &quot;King Ink&quot;, in 1988. It is a collection of lyrics and plays, including collaborations with Lydia Lunch. This was followed up with &quot;King Ink II&quot; in 1997, containing lyrics, poems, and the transcript of a radio essay he wrote for the BBC in July 1996, &quot;The Flesh Made Word&quot;, discussing in biographical format his relationship with Christianity.

While he was based in West Berlin, Cave started working on what was to become his debut novel, &quot;And the Ass Saw the Angel&quot; (1989). Significant crossover is evident between the themes in the book and the lyrics Cave wrote in the late stages of the Birthday Party and the early stage of his solo career. &quot;Swampland&quot;, from &quot;Mutiny&quot;, in particular, uses the same linguistic stylings (&#x27;mah&#x27; for &#x27;my&#x27;, for instance) and some of the same themes (the narrator being haunted by the memory of a girl called Lucy, being hunted like an animal, approaching death and execution).

In 1993, Cave and Lydia Lunch published an adult comic book they wrote together, with illustrations by Mike Matthews, titled &quot;AS-FIX-E-8&quot;.

On 21 January 2008, a special edition of Cave&#x27;s novel &quot;And the Ass Saw the Angel&quot; was released. Cave&#x27;s second novel &quot;The Death of Bunny Munro&quot; was published on 8 September 2009 by HarperCollins. Telling the story of a sex-addicted salesman, it was also released as a binaural audio-book produced by British Artists Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard and an iPhone app. The book originally started as a screenplay Cave was going to write for John Hillcoat.

In 2015 he released the book &quot;The Sick Bag Song&quot;, followed in 2022 by &quot;Faith, Hope, and Carnage&quot;, collected from a series of phone conversations conducted between Cave and Irish writer Sean O&#x27;Hagan during the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Contributions ===
Aside from their soundtracks, Cave also wrote the screenplays for John Hillcoat&#x27;s &quot;The Proposition&quot; (2005) and &quot;Lawless&quot; (2012).

Cave wrote the foreword to a Canongate publication of the &quot;Gospel According to Mark&quot;, published in the UK in 1998. The American edition of the same book (published by Grove Press) contains a foreword by the noted American writer Barry Hannah.

Cave was a contributor to a biography of the alternative rock and pop band the Triffids, &quot;Vagabond Holes: David McComb and the Triffids&quot; (2009), edited by Australian academics Niall Lucy and Chris Coughran.

== Acting ==
Cave&#x27;s first film appearance was in Wim Wenders&#x27; 1987 film &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;, in which he and the Bad Seeds are shown performing at a concert in Berlin.

Cave has made occasional appearances as an actor. He appears alongside Blixa Bargeld in the 1988 Peter Sempel film &quot;Dandy&quot;, playing dice, singing and speaking from his Berlin apartment. He is most prominently featured in the 1989 film &quot;Ghosts… of the Civil Dead&quot;, written and directed by John Hillcoat, and in the 1991 film &quot;Johnny Suede&quot; with Brad Pitt.

Cave appeared in the 2005 homage to Leonard Cohen, &quot;Leonard Cohen: I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;, in which he performed &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot; solo, and &quot;Suzanne&quot; with Julie Christensen and Perla Batalla. He also appeared in the 2007 film adaptation of Ron Hansen&#x27;s novel &quot;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford&quot;, where he sings &quot;The Ballad of Jesse James&quot;. Cave and Warren Ellis are credited for the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Nick Cave and his son Luke performed one of the songs on the soundtrack together. Luke played the triangle.

His interest in the work of Edward Gorey led to his participation in the BBC Radio 3 programme &quot;Guest + Host = Ghost&quot;, featuring Peter Blegvad and the radiophonic sound of the Langham Research Centre.

Cave lent his voice in narrating the animated film &quot;The Cat Piano&quot; (2009). It was directed by Eddie White and Ari Gibson (of the People&#x27;s Republic of Animation), produced by Jessica Brentnall and features music by Benjamin Speed.

He provided the voice of the character Bill Clarke in the stop-motion film &quot;Memoir of a Snail&quot; (2024) by Adam Elliot.

== Screenwriting ==

Cave wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Proposition&quot;, a film about bushrangers in the Australian outback during the late 19th century. Directed by John Hillcoat and filmed in Queensland in 2004, it premiered in October 2005 and was later released worldwide to critical acclaim. Cave explained his personal background in relation to writing the film&#x27;s screenplay in a 2013 interview:
I had written long-form before but it is pure story-telling in script writing and that goes back as far as I can remember for me, not just with my father but with myself. I slept in the same bedroom as my sister for many years, until it became indecent to do so and I would tell her stories every night—that is how she would get to sleep. She would say &quot;tell me a story&quot; so I would tell her a story. So that ability, I very much had that from the start and I used to enjoy that at school so actually to write a script—it suddenly felt like I was just making up a big story.

The film critic for British newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; called &quot;The Proposition&quot; &quot;peerless&quot;, &quot;a star-studded and uncompromisingly violent outlaw film&quot;. The generally ambient soundtrack was recorded by Cave and Warren Ellis.

At the request of his friend Russell Crowe, Cave wrote a script for a proposed sequel to &quot;Gladiator&quot; which was rejected by the studio.

An announcement in February 2010 stated that Andy Serkis and Cave would collaborate on a motion-capture movie of the Brecht and Weill musical &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;. As of November 2024, the project has not been realised.

Cave wrote a screenplay titled &quot;The Wettest County in the World&quot;, which was used for the 2012 film &quot;Lawless&quot;, directed again by John Hillcoat, starring Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf.

== Blogging ==
Cave currently maintains a personal blog and an online correspondence page with his fans called &quot;The Red Hand Files&quot; which is seen as a continuation of &quot;In Conversation,&quot; a series of live personal talks Cave had held in which the audience were free to ask questions. On the page, Cave discusses various issues ranging from art, religion, current affairs and music, as well as using it as a free platform in which fans are encouraged to ask personal questions on any topic of their choosing. Cave&#x27;s intimate approach to the Question &amp; Answer format on &quot;The Red Hand Files&quot; was praised by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;a shelter from the online storm free of discord and conspiracies, and in harmony with the internet vision of Tim Berners-Lee.&quot;

In January 2023, after being sent a song written by ChatGPT &quot;in the style of Nick Cave&quot;, he responded on &quot;The Red Hand Files&quot; (and was later quoted in &quot;The Guardian&quot;) saying that act of song writing &quot;is not mimicry, or replication, or pastiche, it is the opposite, it is an act of self-murder that destroys all one has strived to produce in the past.&quot; He went on to say &quot;It&#x27;s a blood and guts business [that] requires my humanness&quot;, concluding that &quot;this song is bullshit, a grotesque mockery of what it is to be human, and, well, I don&#x27;t much like it.&quot;

== Legacy and influence ==
In 2010, Cave was ranked the 19th greatest living lyricist in &quot;NME&quot;. Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers called him the greatest living songwriter in 2011. Rob O&#x27;Connor of Yahoo Music listed him as the 23rd best lyricist in rock history. &quot;The Art of Nick Cave: New Critical Essays&quot; was edited by academic John H. Baker and published in 2013. In an essay on the studio album &quot;The Boatman&#x27;s Call&quot; (1997), Peter Billingham praised Cave&#x27;s love songs as characterised by a &quot;deep, poetic, melancholic introspection&quot;. Carl Lavery, another academic featured in the collection, argued that there was a &quot;burgeoning field of Cave studies&quot;. Dan Rose argued that Cave &quot;is a master of the disturbing narrative and chronicler of the extreme, though he is also certainly capable of a subtle romantic vision. He does much to the listener who enters his world.&quot;

Songs written about Cave include &quot;Just a King in Mirrors&quot; (1983) by the Go-Betweens, &quot;Sick Man&quot; (1984) by Foetus, and &quot;Bill Bailey&quot; (1987) by the Gun Club.

A number of prominent noise rock vocalists have cited Cave&#x27;s Birthday Party-era work as their primary influence, including the U-Men&#x27;s John Bigley, and David Yow, frontman of Scratch Acid and the Jesus Lizard. Yow stated: &quot;For a long time, particularly with Scratch Acid, I was so taken with the Birthday Party that I would deny it&quot;, and that &quot;it sounded like I was trying to be Birthday Party Nick Cave—which I was.&quot; Often compared to Cave in his vocal delivery, Alexis Marshall of Daughters said that he admires the personality and energy within Cave&#x27;s voice, and that his early studio albums &quot;exposed [him] to lyrical content as literature&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Cave left Australia in 1980. After stints living in London, Berlin, and São Paulo, he moved to Brighton, England, in the early 2000s.

The film &quot;20,000 Days on Earth&quot; (2014), about Cave&#x27;s life, is set around Brighton. In 2017, Cave reportedly told &quot;GQ&quot; magazine that he and his family were considering moving from Brighton to Los Angeles as, after the death of his 15-year-old son, Arthur, they &quot;just find it too difficult to live here.&quot;

In November 2021, while answering a question on &quot;The Red Hand Files&quot; which was referencing the song &quot;Heart That Kills You&quot; (from the compilation album &quot;B-Sides &amp; Rarities Part II&quot;) Cave stated, &quot;The words of the song go someway toward articulating why Susie and I moved from Brighton to L.A. Brighton had just become too sad. We did, however, return once we realised that, regardless of where we lived, we just took our sadness with us. These days, though, we spend much of our time in London, in a tiny, secret, pink house, where we are mostly happy.&quot;

Cave was a guest at the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla in May 2023.

In June 2023, in &quot;The Archbishop Interview&quot; with Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, on BBC Radio 4, Cave spoke about being a heroin addict for 20 years. Although his life during that time was admittedly &quot;a terrible shambles&quot;, his second decade of addiction was much more stable and characterised by regularly taking heroin in the morning and in the evening and being able to work on writing during the day.

On his blog, Cave discussed practicing Transcendental Meditation (TM), saying &quot;from the first time I meditated, I stopped fearing the end of the world.&quot; In 2025 he disclosed that he regularly attends a 900-year old Anglican church in London where he enjoys the traditional solemn liturgy &quot;with no guitars. Thank God.&quot;

=== Partners and children ===

Cave dated singer/songwriter Anita Lane from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. Cave and Lane recorded together on a few occasions. Their most notable collaborations include Lane&#x27;s &quot;cameo&quot; verse on Cave&#x27;s Bob Dylan cover version &quot;Death Is Not the End&quot; from the studio album &quot;Murder Ballads&quot; (1996), and a cover of the Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin song &quot;Je t&#x27;aime... moi non plus/ I love you ... me neither&quot;. Lane co-wrote the lyrics to the title track for Cave&#x27;s studio album, &quot;From Her to Eternity&quot; (1984), as well as the lyrics of the song &quot;Stranger Than Kindness&quot; from &quot;Your Funeral... My Trial&quot; (1986).

Cave then moved to São Paulo, Brazil, in 1990, where he met and married his first wife, Brazilian journalist Viviane Carneiro. She gave birth to their son Luke in 1991. Cave and Carneiro were married for six years and divorced in 1996.

Cave&#x27;s son Jethro was also born in 1991, just 10 days before Luke, and grew up with his mother, Beau Lazenby, in Melbourne, Australia. Cave and Jethro never met until Jethro was about seven or eight. He died at age 31 in May 2022. 

Cave briefly dated English singer/songwriter PJ Harvey during the mid-1990s, with whom he recorded the duet &quot;Henry Lee&quot;. Their break-up influenced his studio album &quot;The Boatman&#x27;s Call&quot; (1997).

In 1997, Cave met English model Susie Bick; they married in 1999. Their twin sons, Arthur and Earl, were born in London in 2000 and raised in Brighton. Bick is the model on the cover of Cave&#x27;s studio album &quot;Push the Sky Away&quot; (2013).

When he was 15 years old, Cave&#x27;s son Arthur fell from a cliff at Ovingdean, near Brighton, and died from his injuries on 14 July 2015. An inquest found that Arthur had taken LSD before the fall and the coroner ruled his death was an accident. The effect of Arthur&#x27;s death on Cave and his family was explored in the documentary film &quot;One More Time with Feeling&quot; (2016), and the studio album &quot;Ghosteen&quot; (2019).

Cave is the godfather to Michael Hutchence&#x27;s daughter Tiger Lily Hutchence Geldof; he performed &quot;Into My Arms&quot; at the televised funeral of Hutchence, but insisted that the cameras cease rolling during his performance.

=== Religion ===
Cave is an avid reader of the Christian Bible. In his recorded lectures on music and songwriting, Cave said that any true love song is a song for God, and ascribed the mellowing of his music to a shift in focus from the Old Testament to the New. When asked if he had interest in religions outside of Christianity, Cave quipped that he had a passing, sceptical interest but was a &quot;hammer-and-nails kind of guy&quot;. Despite this, Cave has also said he is critical of organised religion. When interviewed by Jarvis Cocker of Pulp on 12September 2010, for his BBC Radio6 show &quot;Jarvis Cocker&#x27;s Sunday Service&quot;, Cave said that &quot;I believe in God in spite of religion, not because of it.&quot;

Cave has always been open about his doubts. When asked in 2009 about whether he believed in a personal god, Cave&#x27;s reply was &quot;No&quot;. The following year, he stated that &quot;I&#x27;m not religious, and I&#x27;m not a Christian, but I do reserve the right to believe in the possibility of a god. It&#x27;s kind of defending the indefensible, though; I&#x27;m critical of what religions are becoming, the more destructive they&#x27;re becoming. But I think as an artist, particularly, it&#x27;s a necessary part of what I do, that there is some divine element going on within my songs.&quot;

Cave&#x27;s religious doubts were once a source of discomfort to him, but he eventually concluded:
In 2019, Cave expressed his personal disagreement with both organised religion and atheism (in particular New Atheism) when questioned about his beliefs by a fan during a question and answer session on his &quot;Red Hand Files&quot; blog. On the same blog, Cave confirmed he believed in God in June 2021. By 2023, Cave characterised himself as not being a Christian but &#x27;act[ing] like one&#x27; and detailed in his 2022 book &quot;Faith, Hope, and Carnage&quot; that he regularly attends church.

In 2023, Cave wrote on his blog that he had sympathised with feminist author Ayaan Hirsi Ali&#x27;s conversion from Islam to atheism after reading her book &quot;&quot; (2006), and had also considered himself an atheist. However, he described his growing interest in religion as a &quot;slowly emergent state&quot; and shaped by his upbringing in the Anglican church. He also clarified his view on Christianity was &quot;non-political and fully personal and emotional&quot; and described his religious beliefs as &quot;bound up in the liturgy and the ritual and the poetry that swirls around the restless, tortured figure of Jesus, as presented within the sacred domain of the church itself. My religiousness is softly spoken, both sorrowful and joyful, broadening and deepening, imagined and true. It is worship and prayer. It is resilient yet doubting, and forever wrestles with the forces of rationality.&quot; He concluded by describing Hirsi Ali&#x27;s 2023 article in &quot;UnHerd&quot; documenting her conversion to Christianity as a &quot;laudable achievement&quot; for its ability to &quot;vex atheists and Christians alike.&quot;

=== Politics ===
In 2019, Cave wrote in defence of singer Morrissey of the Smiths after the latter expressed a series of controversial political statements during the release of his solo studio album &quot;California Son&quot; which led to some record stores refusing to stock it. Cave argued that Morrissey should have that right to freedom of speech to state his opinions while everyone should be able to &quot;challenge them when and wherever possible, but allow his music to live on, bearing in mind we are all conflicted individuals.&quot; He also added it would be &quot;dangerous&quot; to censor Morrissey from expressing his beliefs.

In response to a fan asking about his political beliefs, Cave expressed a disdain for &quot;atheism, organised religion, radical bi-partisan politics and woke culture&quot; on his &quot;Red Hand Files&quot; blog. He in particular singled out woke politics and culture for criticism, describing it as &quot;finding energy in self-righteous belief and the suppression of contrary systems of thought&quot; and &quot;regardless of the virtuous intentions of many woke issues, it is its lack of humility and the paternalistic and doctrinal sureness of its claims that repel me.&quot; In 2020, Cave also expressed opposition to ostracism, particularly cancel culture, and misguided political correctness, describing both as &quot;bad religion run amuck&quot; and their &quot;refusal to engage with uncomfortable ideas has an asphyxiating effect on the creative soul of a society.&quot;

Cave has previously described himself as a supporter of freedom of speech in both his live &quot;In Conversation&quot; events and on his blog. He has also argued against boycotting musicians for controversial actions or political opinions while giving a lecture at the Hay Festival in 2023, saying that audiences should not &quot;eradicate the best of these people in order to punish the worst of them.&quot;

In October 2022, Cave expressed support for the participants of the Mahsa Amini protests in Iran on his correspondence blog after being asked by a fan on the matter. He responded by stating &quot;I am in awe of their courage and pray for their safety.&quot;

In 2023, Cave disputed a characterisation of him as right-wing or conservative by the &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine but added &quot;I have these days what I would call a conservative temperament&quot; and described himself as &quot;conservative with a small c.&quot; He also clarified he was &quot;not against progress&quot; but &quot;I just see things moving very rapidly and a whole lot of different things worry me a lot, like AI&quot; and expressed criticism of the idea &quot;that everything is systemically fucked&quot;. He also stated that his small-c conservative views had formed following the deaths of two of his sons, explaining &quot;I think that I have an understanding of loss and what it is to lose something and how difficult it is to get that back&quot; and argued that the demise of religion and spirituality &quot;which may or may not be a good thing&quot; had led to a &quot;vacuum that we created that we don&#x27;t really know what to do with&quot;. He has also written in support of the rights of trans people, stating on his personal blog that he &quot;[loves] my trans fans fully&quot; and &quot;[wishes] for them to receive every right inherent to them and for them to lead lives of dignity and freedom, devoid of violence and prejudice&quot;.

==== Israel and BDS ====
In November 2017, Cave was urged by British musicians Brian Eno and Roger Waters to cancel two concerts in Tel Aviv, Israel, while &quot;apartheid remains&quot; but he declined. Cave went on to describe the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement as &quot;cowardly and shameful&quot;, and that calls to boycott the country are &quot;partly the reason I am playing Israel – not as support for any particular political entity but as a principled stand against those who wish to bully, shame and silence musicians.&quot; He wrote an open letter to Eno to defend his position.

In 2024, when asked by a musician on Cave&#x27;s The Red Hand Files whether they should boycott The Great Escape Festival in response to the claim by Bands Boycott Barclays that the festival sponsor increased its investment in arms companies trading with Israel, he responded with &quot;play&quot;.

<text>Passions is an American television soap opera that originally aired on NBC from July 5, 1999, to September 7, 2007, and on DirecTV&#x27;s The 101 Network from September 17, 2007, to August 7, 2008. Created by screenwriter James E. Reilly and produced by NBC Studios, &quot;Passions&quot; follows the lives, loves and various romantic and paranormal adventures of the residents of Harmony, a small town in New England with many secrets.

Storylines center on the interactions among members of its multi-racial core families: the African-American Russells, the white Cranes and Bennetts, and half-Mexican half-Irish Lopez-Fitzgeralds. The series also features supernatural elements, which focus mainly on town witch Tabitha Lenox (Juliet Mills) and her doll-come-to-life, Timmy (Josh Ryan Evans).

NBC cancelled &quot;Passions&quot; on January 16, 2007. The series was subsequently picked up by DirecTV. The series aired its final episode on NBC on September 7, 2007, with new episodes continuing on DirecTV&#x27;s 101 Network starting on September 17. In December 2007, just months after picking up the series, DirecTV decided not to renew its contract for &quot;Passions&quot;, and the studio was subsequently unable to sell the series elsewhere. The final episode was broadcast in August 2008. &quot;Passions&quot; was the last daytime television soap opera created for American network television until CBS announced a new soap opera entitled &quot;Beyond the Gates&quot;, that will premiere in February 2025.

==Series history==
&quot;Passions&quot; debuted on NBC in July 1999 with major fanfare. Creator Reilly had been credited for a large surge in the ratings for &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; years before, thanks to innovative storylines like that of heroine Dr. Marlena Evans being possessed by Satan that drew new viewers, but also tended to alienate stalwart fans. With &quot;Passions&quot;, Reilly was able to start with a blank slate and no pre-existing fan base to please. The series replaced the Procter &amp; Gamble-produced soap &quot;Another World&quot;, which ended a 35-year run on June 25, 1999, on NBC&#x27;s daytime schedule. In the early days of the show, &quot;Passions&quot; heroine Sheridan Crane is identified as a close friend of Diana, Princess of Wales; soon Sheridan recalls speaking to Diana on the phone immediately before the 1997 car crash in which Diana was killed. Sheridan also has a similar accident in the same Paris tunnel, and speaks to a &quot;guardian Angel Diana&quot; who urges her to fight to survive, which drew considerable controversy. Sheridan later adopts the name Diana after a boating accident that results in amnesia.

The opening days of the show also introduced the Theresa/Ethan/Gwen love triangle that persisted as an ongoing main story line to the very last episode of the series.

For much of the first three to four years of the series, supernatural elements such as witches, warlocks, and closet doors leading to Hell were major plot points, many surrounding the machinations of the centuries-old witch Tabitha Lenox and her doll-brought-to-life sidekick, Timmy—named by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; as one of their &quot;17 Great Soap Supercouples&quot; in 2008. In 2001, HarperEntertainment released &quot;Hidden Passions&quot;, a tie-in novelization presented as Tabitha&#x27;s diary, exposing the secrets and pasts of the town&#x27;s residents. &quot;Passions&quot; featured a story-line involving Tabitha and Timmy promoting the book, which reached No. 4 on the real-life &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list and garnered the series two alternative covers of &quot;TV Guide&quot; in July 2001.

In 2003, &quot;Passions&quot; submitted an orangutan named BamBam, who had been portraying the recurring role of Precious, for a Daytime Emmy Award. Precious was the non-speaking live-in nurse and caregiver for elderly Edna Wallace, and held an unrequited love for Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald, which was depicted in elaborate fantasy sequences. In early 2004, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which administers the awards, disallowed the entry with the following statement:
Our ruling is based on the belief that the Academy must draw a line of distinction between animal characters that aren&#x27;t capable of speaking parts and human actors whose personal interpretation in character portrayal creates nuance and audience engagement that uniquely qualifies those performers for consideration of television&#x27;s highest honor.

In summer 2005, the prominent character Simone Russell came out as gay; &quot;Passions&quot; made daytime history by being the first serial to show two women—Simone and love interest Rae Thomas—in bed making love. In 2007, it was revealed that longtime hero Chad Harris-Crane was cheating on his wife with another man. This was also a daytime first, with the men portrayed in bed together, committing—albeit unknowingly—incest. &quot;Passions&quot; also portrayed Vincent as an intersex person who became pregnant with his own father&#x27;s son.

Nearly seven years after the debut of &quot;Passions&quot; on July 5, 1999, the NBC-owned Sci Fi Channel began airing the series from its first episode starting February 13, 2006. Due to low ratings, the reruns were taken off the air as of May 25, 2006. On August 15, 2006, &quot;Passions&quot; became the first daytime drama to make full episodes available for download and purchase from the online music store iTunes. On November 6, 2006, the show also became the first daytime drama to make full episodes available for free viewing via streaming on NBC.com.

Though plagued since its inception by low overall Nielsen ratings, &quot;Passions&quot; was historically top-rated in key demographics, namely the female 12-to-17 demographic; &quot;Passions&quot; and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; usually occupied the top two positions among all soaps in this age group.

===Move to DirecTV===
On January 17, 2007, NBC announced that it would not renew &quot;Passions&quot; for a ninth season, in order to accommodate a planned expansion of its morning news and talk show &quot;Today&quot; to a fourth hour. NBC reclaimed the program&#x27;s hour-long slot in order to extend &quot;Today&quot; into the 10:00 am ET hour, rather than acquiring an extra hour of programming time already allocated to its stations for syndicated or local programs. NBC soon began shopping the series to other networks. In April 2007, satellite television provider DirecTV reached an agreement with NBCUniversal Television Studio to acquire the exclusive broadcast rights to &quot;Passions&quot;, with most of the serial&#x27;s principal cast members staying on.

Ahead of the move from NBC to DirecTV, the call-in aftershow &quot;Passions Live&quot;, hosted by Eric Martsolf (who succeeded original cast member Travis Schuldt as Ethan Winthrop in 2002), premiered on DirecTV&#x27;s general entertainment network The 101 in August 2007, making &quot;Passions&quot; the first (and only) American soap opera to ever have a live talk show. Airing weekly on Thursday nights until October 2007 and streamed simultaneously on NBC.com&#x27;s official &quot;Passions&quot; website, the show gave fans the chance to call into the program and interact live with cast members from the soap. &quot;Passions&quot; ended its NBC run after eight seasons on September 7, 2007, leaving &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as the network&#x27;s lone remaining soap opera and conventional daytime program (until it was moved to the co-owned Peacock streaming service in September 2022 to accommodate the afternoon newscast &quot;NBC News Daily&quot;); new episodes subsequently began airing on The 101 ten days later on September 17, becoming the first (and , only) American daytime network soap opera to move their first-run episodes to a subscription television service.

With the move to The 101, episodes were reduced to four days a week, airing Monday–Thursday at 2:00 pm ET/11 am PT (retaining the timeslot it had held since its NBC debut), with repeats airing later in the day and on weekends. NBC.com continued to maintain &quot;Passions&quot;″ official website after the series moved over to DirecTV; however, first-run episodes were no longer made available to stream for free on NBC&#x27;s website or for purchase at iTunes. Initially, new episodes were supposed to air exclusively on DirecTV after the soap concluded its run on NBC; however, on September 27, 2007, DirecTV announced it would provide viewers who were not already DirecTV subscribers an &quot;All Access Pass to &quot;Passions&quot;&quot; to stream all newer episodes on NBC.com after their initial airing on The 101 for a monthly fee. This subscription offering launched on October 1, 2007, originally priced at $19.99 per month (later reduced to $14.99 when &quot;Passions&quot; cut its weekly schedule from four episodes to three). In another first for the soap opera genre, episodes airing on The 101 included a interactive feature allowing viewers to answer a special &quot;Passions&quot; trivia question that appeared on-screen as a pop-up using their remote control.

On December 10, 2007, &quot;Variety&quot; magazine and various cast members confirmed that DirecTV had decided not to renew &quot;Passions&quot; for a tenth season, but extended its existing order to include 52 additional episodes to be taped through March 2008. In January 2008, DirecTV reduced the show&#x27;s schedule to three episodes per week, airing Monday through Wednesday. Universal Media Studios wrapped up production of &quot;Passions&quot; on March 28, 2008. As confirmed by original cast member McKenzie Westmore (Sheridan Crane), the cast and crew were told at the wrap party that efforts to find a new outlet had failed and that the show&#x27;s cancellation was final. New episodes continued to air on The 101 until August 7, 2008, when &quot;Passions&quot; ended its nine-season run. Though &quot;Passions&quot; had been the highest-rated original program on DirecTV&#x27;s The 101, it was reported that the network had failed to meet the projected number of new subscribers they had hoped to attract with the series.

==Hallmarks==
===Pop culture homages===
Over its run, &quot;Passions&quot; featured several storylines and sequences paying homage to or parodying other television series, films, books, and musicals like &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, &quot;Carrie&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, &quot;The Osbournes&quot;, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, and &quot;Wicked&quot;. A 2003 fantasy sequence imitated the &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot; number from the 2002 film &quot;Chicago&quot;. &quot;Passions&quot;″ version of the song, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Sorry&quot;, received a 2004 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Song. A 2006 Bollywood homage featured the song &quot;Love is Ecstasy,&quot; which earned the show another Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Original Song and was made available on the NBC website. In nods to &quot;Bewitched&quot;, Bernard Fox appeared as that series&#x27; &quot;Dr. Bombay&quot; twice on &quot;Passions&quot; in scenes with Tabitha (not to be confused with own Tabitha Stephens). When &quot;Passions&quot;″ Tabitha has a child in 2003, she names the baby &quot;Endora&quot; which was Tabitha&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s name, and later notes that her parents had been &quot;Samantha&quot; and a mortal named &quot;Darrin.&quot;

===Dream sequences and flashbacks===
One of &quot;Passions&quot;″ most notorious trademarks is the false &quot;dream sequence&quot; or fakeout. Often, the show would play out an outlandish event, or explode a huge secret which viewers have long been waiting to see, only to reveal it to be a daydream. This dream sequence would last anywhere from a few scenes to a few episodes, typically beginning without warning. On &quot;Passions&quot;, often a dream sequence would begin with no visual cues of any sort whatsoever, often going as far as to include contradictory elements to give the dream sequence credence (for instance, another character may show up within the dream wearing an outfit, or revealing information that the daydreamer had no possible way of knowing about beforehand).

Characters on the show have flashbacks to earlier events quite often, so much so that a significant portion of an episode may be repeated scenes.

===Fate and destined couples===
Another trademark of the serial is its pre-occupation with the concepts of fate and soulmates. For the run of the series, the show established a few couples as &quot;fated&quot; and, with few short-lived exceptions, never mixed up any of the relationships. Some of the early &quot;fated&quot; couples were considered to be those of Luis and Sheridan, Ethan and Theresa, Miguel and Charity, and Chad and Whitney. Sam and Grace Bennett were the prototype &quot;fated couple&quot; but again, thanks to Tabitha&#x27;s schemes, The House Bennett started a heredity of disfunction in the town of Harmony with &quot;fated&quot; relationships starting with Grace&#x27;s affair with David Hastings, and the corruption of Grace&#x27;s niece Charity as well as Sam&#x27;s daughter Kay in their love triangle with Miguel. Common indications of a couple&#x27;s status as &quot;fated&quot; include (but are not necessarily limited to) Tabitha&#x27;s desire to split said couple up, an unshakeable love that survives numerous break-ups and relationships with third parties, and/or an ability of one character, or perhaps both characters, to &quot;sense&quot; when his/her &quot;soulmate&quot; is in danger, as well as having shared past lives together in the case of Luis and Sheridan. However, despite the fact that each of these couples has existed as a storyline since the first episodes, the show seems to have given up on the &quot;fated&quot; angle as it approached its end. Ethan and Theresa are still in love and marry in the final episode, but Miguel is now in love with and marries Kay, Luis falls in love with and marries Sheridan&#x27;s niece Fancy, while Sheridan&#x27;s formerly presumed dead husband Antonio returns to Harmony alive and well. Whitney left Chad after finding out about his affair with Vincent, and Chad later was shot dead by his father Alistair, leaving Whitney widowed and pregnant.

===Summertime extravaganzas===
Likely due to &quot;Passions&quot;″ school-aged target audience, the show often presented large, wild storylines for the summer, which often took place outside of Harmony. In 1999, a carnival came to town as characters were introduced; 2000 saw the Prom Boat Disaster storyline and 2001 witnessed the failed double-wedding of popular couples Luis and Sheridan and Ethan and Theresa, and their subsequent journey to Bermuda, where Sheridan apparently perished in a boat explosion and Theresa wound up married to Ethan&#x27;s ex-stepfather, Julian Crane. In 2002, Julian and Timmy set out on a journey in the magical land of Oz as Theresa was &quot;executed&quot; for Julian&#x27;s &quot;murder&quot;; 2003 saw six characters (Chad, Whitney, Fox, Theresa, Ethan, and Gwen) travel to Los Angeles for the summer (and into October), while, in 2004, Luis and Sheridan traveled to Puerto Arena, Mexico, to retrieve his younger sister, Paloma (and ended up finding his missing father, Martin, and her &quot;dead&quot; mother, Katherine). The plot of the summer in 2005 was a deadly earthquake and tsunami, which destroyed much of Harmony and resulted in the death of James&#x27; mother, Maureen, while 2006 saw the extravagant &quot;Passions&quot; Vendetta plot, in which Alistair lured 19 people (Whitney, Simone, Paloma, Chad, Ethan, Theresa, Gwen, Lena, Spike, Jessica, Maya, Noah, Esmé, Fancy, Luis, Edna Wallace, Norma Bates, Beth, and Marty) to Rome, where he planned to take over the world with a chalice stolen from the Pope&#x27;s private chambers; the plot saw the death of Lena, Maya, Alistair, Beth, and Marty. Summer 2007 saw the resolution of the &quot;blackmailer&quot; storyline as Vincent Clarkson was revealed to be the half-man/half-woman blackmailer, and Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald was saved from execution for Vincent&#x27;s crimes by Endora&#x27;s spell that turned back time in the execution chamber. In 2008, the show spent its final summer on the air wrapping up its plotlines at a rapid pace, with Alistair Crane being killed once and for all, the final showdowns between the main characters and the newly introduced villains Viki, Juanita, Pretty, and Vincent, Tabitha&#x27;s redemption as a born again Christian who sacrifices her powers to save the residents of Harmony, the return of Antonio and his reunion with Sheridan, the mass weddings of Fancy and Luis, Paloma and Noah, Miguel and Kay, and Edna and Norma (the first gay couple ever to go down the aisle on a soap opera), and Gwen and Rebecca being exposed for their crimes as Theresa and Ethan finally married.

===Sexual violence===
Another recurring theme on &quot;Passions&quot; was sexual violence. Many storylines, from 2005 until the series’ end, included rape as a plot point.

In 2005, Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald was sexually assaulted and nearly raped during a club raid. The show then carried a plotline over whether they should do a rape test while Paloma was in a coma (at the time she was a virgin) and Jessica Bennett was also raped a few weeks later while at a club. Also early in the year, Alistair Crane repeatedly raped his wife, Katherine Crane, while at the Crane Compound. Late in May, heiress Fancy Crane was nearly raped by a man in Las Vegas who demanded &quot;payment&quot; for letting her into a party after she lost her invitation. During the tsunami and later in November, Liz Sanbourne attempted to rape Julian Crane at knife point. In August, Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald was raped by Alistair Crane when she refused to pay him (with sex) for helping her with visitation of her infant daughter, Jane; Theresa later married Alistair, and he continued to rape her throughout their marriage. Also in August or September, Kay Bennett was attacked by a gang of men while walking through the park at night, though Fox Crane soon arrived and the two defeated the group. Liz Sanbourne also revealed during the tsunami that Julian Crane had raped her in Boston many years previously (she later revealed that it had been Alistair who had done the deed, thus producing a son, Chad Harris-Crane).

The most prominent rape storyline began in December 2006, when Crane heiress and police cadet Fancy Crane was raped during a sting operation designed to catch a peeping tom. The brutal attack left Fancy in a brief coma and emotionally traumatized the young woman. Fancy was also the show&#x27;s first rape victim to visibly experience prolonged effects; her bubbly demeanor disappeared, and she became extremely nervous and could not stand to be touched for several months. Fancy was eventually raped for a second time in January 2007, and her boyfriend, Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald, was framed for the crimes; the rapist was later revealed to be Vincent Clarkson, Fancy&#x27;s paternal half-brother through their father.

Rape also played prominently into the 2007–2008 storyline involving Mexican drug cartel leader Juanita Vasquez. Sometime between the births of Pilar&#x27;s second and third children, the Lopez-Fitzgerald matriarch returned to her native Mexico to visit with her childhood best friend, Juanita Vasquez. There, she discovered that Juanita&#x27;s husband, Carlos, was still involved with his family&#x27;s drug cartel and was planning a hit on a rival family; when Pilar confronted Carlos, he raped her, and she accidentally killed him in self-defense. Pilar then called the police in an attempt to stop the hit, but the police ended up murdering the entire Vasquez family, including Juanita and Carlos&#x27; young children, except for Juanita. Juanita refused to believe that her husband had raped Pilar and made it her life&#x27;s mission to murder Pilar&#x27;s entire family, eventually murdering Pilar&#x27;s sister and two nephews.

Men on the show were equally as likely to be violated as women. Fox Crane, Julian Crane, and Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald have all been victims of sexual assault.
===Eerie deaths===
One unfortunate trademark for &quot;Passions&quot; has been eerie deaths. In 2002, Josh Ryan Evans, who played Tabitha&#x27;s doll sidekick Timmy, died while on medical leave, just as scenes were airing where Timmy died in the hospital and went to Heaven. &quot;Passions&quot; had planned to revive the character in a few months once Evans returned from his own surgery, but instead had to write Timmy out. After five years of evil Crane patriarch Alistair being heard but never having his face seen (voiced by Alan Oppenheimer), &quot;Passions&quot; cast the role with longtime daytime veteran David Bailey. Bailey was a hit with the cast as well as the fans, but on Thanksgiving Day 2004, Bailey drowned in his pool, just as scenes were airing where various characters tried to kill Alistair, who actually suffered clinical death before being magically revived by Tabitha. Again, the viewers and the producers were stunned, but the show had no choice but to recast the pivotal role (with John Reilly).

===Breaking the fourth wall===
With its humor and occasional tongue-in-cheek tone, &quot;Passions&quot; has been known to &quot;break the fourth wall&quot;, or somehow call attention to the fact that the show is fictional. In an early episode, Kay, Simone, and Zombie Charity were seen actually watching &quot;Passions&quot;, and when the television in the Bennetts&#x27; kitchen covered what would have been Theresa&#x27;s execution, the news report actually pre-empted &quot;Passions&quot;, cutting in during the theme song just after the appearance of the logo. In a 2002 episode Theresa was giving birth while stuck in a cabin with Ethan and Gwen; she had a hallucination in which the three of them did a dance together and sang the show&#x27;s theme song &quot;Breathe.&quot; In a 2004 episode, TC commented on &quot;that crazy soap after &quot;Days of our Lives&quot;&quot;, referring to &quot;Passions&quot; itself. In a 2005 episode, Fancy Crane used a magazine to hide her face from Noah; the magazine had an image of the then-unrevealed Rachel Barrett with the sentence &quot;Who is she?&quot; under the &quot;Passions&quot; logo. In the same episode, Fancy later commented that &quot;soaps are like life; you never know what&#x27;s going to happen next!&quot; In an early 2006 episode, Ivy and assistant Valerie were searching on the internet for Miguel to bring him back to Harmony and interfere with Fox and Kay&#x27;s relationship. They could not find him, but Valerie tracked down his last place of employment: he was last seen working as a gardener in some suburban town on a street called Wisteria Lane. At that time, Jesse Metcalfe (ex-Miguel) was playing a gardener on the prime-time serial &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, which takes place on a street called Wisteria Lane. In the March 30, 2006 episode, while &quot;Passions&quot; reruns were airing on the Sci Fi Channel, Simone compared life in Harmony to living in a show on the Sci Fi Channel. Similarly, in the August 10, 2006 episode, Theresa commented that her office was not like an NBC daytime serial, and that she would not hire somebody just because he looked like Jesse Metcalfe (who had portrayed her brother Miguel from 1999 to 2004). A similar inside joke occurred when the character Fancy had a dream that she was a cheerleader; in real life, Fancy&#x27;s portrayer Emily Harper was a &quot;Laker Girl&quot; (cheerleader for the Los Angeles Lakers) from 2000 to 2003.

In April 2007, Kay was watching the sixth hour of &quot;The Today Show&quot; (an apparent jab at NBC&#x27;s decision to extend it at the expense of the &quot;Passions&quot; timeslot) when it was interrupted with a news report that Luis had been arrested. In one August 2007 episode, Tabitha said that a certain soap opera was starting on DirecTV and she would have to tell her friends not to call her between the hours of 2:00 and 3:00 pm, blatantly referring to &quot;Passions&quot; itself. At the beginning of the show&#x27;s final week on NBC, as Whitney was preparing to move to New Orleans, Theresa asked if she was sure she wanted to go, and Whitney commented that she had already arranged to have her DirecTV hooked up in Louisiana so she could &quot;keep up on everything happening in Harmony.&quot; And also in 2007, Endora flat-out made a reference to the &quot;audience&quot; in one of her thought balloons, prompting Norma to look in the camera and respond, &quot;Audience? What audience?&quot; Endora also pointed out in one of her thought balloons that when Miguel returned to &quot;Passions&quot;, he looked nothing like Jesse Metcalfe (&quot;Nope, not even close!&quot;). In May 2008 while Juanita was looking for clues in a bookstore as to where Pilar was, the bargain shelf was full of copies of &quot;Hidden Passions&quot;. In June 2008, Tabitha mentions the fourth hour of &quot;Today&quot; being a ratings-grabber, poking fun as to how they canceled the soap making way for this fourth hour trying to bring the ratings on NBC up.
In the June 30, 2008, episode, Sheridan mentions Pretty&#x27;s fake scar with references to her real family the Westmores. Michael Westmore did make up for all four &quot;Star Trek&quot; spin-off series.

In the July 30, 2008, episode, Tabitha tells Endora about the volcano in Harmony referring to it as how &quot;Passions&quot; was canceled at the last moment and the actors not knowing. She tells Endora to look in the bowl and Endora says she sees a man sitting at a desk with the initials &quot;J. Z.&quot; this is referring to NBC President Jeff Zucker. Tabitha looks at the audience mentioning Universal forces and Direct Intervention. This is a nod at both Universal Studios and DirecTV for canceling the series twice in one year.

===Promotion and product placement===
During its NBC run, &quot;Passions&quot; was known to &quot;promote&quot; other NBC programming within its storylines, and to incorporate commercial products into the plot in a promotional tactic known as product placement.

Shortly after &quot;Passions&quot; debuted, Campbell tomato soup was featured as an ingredient in Grace Bennett&#x27;s tomato soup cake. Also, Nestlé Purina Dog Chow was used to feed Tabitha Lenox&#x27;s pet cat Fluffy.

In a 2004 episode, TC watched an NBC ad for &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; on his TV, and went on to praise the writers of &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; for coming up with such good storylines; &quot;Days&quot;, at that time, was under the helm of James E. Reilly, head writer of &quot;Passions&quot;. In the September 4, 2006, episode, Fox was sucked into a black hole; he then told Tabitha that it was the kind of black hole that one gets sucked into on the Sci Fi Channel, which was the channel on which &quot;Passions&quot; repeats aired in 2006. Tabitha then told him stick with NBC (&quot;Passions&quot;″ network). In an episode later in September 2006, Siren tried to get Miguel into bed by singing her Siren&#x27;s song. Miguel told her that she should not audition for &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, which airs on NBC. In another episode, Tabitha talked about &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot; season finale, which was also aired on NBC. A more recent episode featured characters watching a trailer for the 2007 Diane Keaton film &quot;Because I Said So&quot; (produced by Universal Studios, which, like NBC, is owned by General Electric).

For a time, Jessica Bennett was an Avon mark saleswoman, and more recently the show featured Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s K-Y Jelly personal lubricant, and characters were seen drinking from Brita water pitchers. Both Jessica and Theresa were seen using Clearblue Easy pregnancy test products. After Kay and Miguel&#x27;s wedding in 2008, Norma gave Miguel 2-in-1 K-Y Jelly lubricant, telling him how it is so great for her and Edna and that Miguel and Kay will find great enjoyment in it.

In July 2007, &quot;Passions&quot; began to promote its own move to DirecTV for the following September. Several characters&#x27; homes were seen sporting DirecTV dishes on their roofs, and characters began to make frequent references to switching to DirecTV.

==Theme song and opening sequence==
The theme song for &quot;Passions&quot; is titled &quot;Breathe&quot;; it was performed by Jane French and written by French and John Henry Kreitler. A long version of this theme was also released but was never used on the show.

The opening title sequence used since the show&#x27;s premiere in 1999 features shots of the city of Harmony and its landmarks (actually the real-life town of Camden, Maine). The sequence opens and closes with the show&#x27;s logo in an italic typeface and in an Arial Black typeface in generic caps posted in front of the cursive form of the title. The opening theme is sometimes shortened to the last two verses to fit in extra scene time.

==Ratings and broadcasting history==
===United States===
A replacement for the serial &quot;Another World&quot; (which ended on June 25, 1999 after a 35-year run) on NBC&#x27;s daytime schedule, &quot;Passions&quot; debuted in tenth place among the eleven soaps airing on American network television at the time, ahead of only fellow NBC soap &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;, with a 2.1 rating (1.9 million viewers) and remained there until &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; was cancelled in December 1999. From January 2000 until early May, the show came in last place in the ratings among the ten soaps on the air then. During the May 2000 sweeps period, &quot;Passions&quot; gained in popularity and pulled ahead of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Port Charles&quot;. &quot;Passions&quot; remained ahead of &quot;Port Charles&quot; until the latter show&#x27;s cancellation in October 2003. From then on, &quot;Passions&quot; once again was last in the American daytime ratings, where it would stay for virtually the rest of its run. It did top &quot;Guiding Light&quot; on occasion, but never for more than one week at a time. From 2001 to 2003, when &quot;Passions&quot; was at the peak of its popularity, it averaged a weekly 2.1–2.3 rating (roughly 2.4 million viewers). However, the ratings slowly declined each year afterwards; by the 2006–07 season, the show averaged a 1.5 weekly rating (about 1.9 million viewers). The final episode on NBC had a household rating of 1.3/4 (1.68 million viewers). No ratings information was ever released for the show&#x27;s run on DirecTV.

While &quot;Passions&quot; was never a big hit in household ratings, the show was a powerhouse in the younger-skewing demographics. For its entire NBC run, it ranked as the No. 1 soap among girls aged 12 to 17 and women aged 18 to 24. The show also ranked at No. 2 among women aged 18 to 34, and even overtook fellow NBC soap &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; for a short period during the 2004–05 season. In the crucial 18-to-49 demographic, &quot;Passions&quot; usually ranked No. 7, ahead of CBS soaps &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. The highest ranking &quot;Passions&quot; ever achieved in the 18-to-49 demographic was fourth place in November 2002 and once again in January 2007.

During its NBC run, &quot;Passions&quot; ran for 60 minutes every weekday (excluding some holidays). For its final season on NBC (2006–07), episodes were available online at NBC.com for free viewing and for purchase on iTunes. After the move to DirecTV, the schedule was shortened to four days a week (Monday through Thursday) plus weekend marathon encores, then later three days a week (Monday through Wednesday) starting in January 2008 until the finale. Initially, DirecTV episodes were only available on its own exclusive channel; later they were made available for a paid subscription fee at NBC.com.

===Canada===
&quot;Passions&quot; aired in Canada for its entire NBC run, first on CTV in 1999 and then on Global TV in 2000. The series lasted there until its final airdate on NBC in September 2007, at which time it was then succeeded by &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in the same time slot. NTV in Newfoundland and Labrador also aired &quot;Passions&quot; for almost its entire NBC run and was replaced by &quot;As the World Turns&quot; just before the series ended on NBC. On July 3, 2007 it was reported that new Canadian premium television service Super Channel would air the DirecTV episodes of &quot;Passions&quot; in Canada when the channel launched in October 2007. Those episodes premiered on Super Channel on October 8, 2007 (airing two new episodes at a time only until it caught up to the DirecTV episodes) and ran until the series finale on August 7, 2008. On August 11, 2008, Super Channel began to air &quot;Passions&quot; from the premiere episode. Season 2 re-ran on Super Channel starting August 2009 and season 3 in 2010. Season 4 premiered on July 14, 2011. Passions run on Super Channel ended on July 3, 2012. Super Channel chose not to renew their contract due to technical issues.

===Australia===
&quot;Passions&quot; was broadcast nationally in Australia on the Seven Network each weekday at 3:00pm, beginning on 29 January 2001 with the series&#x27; 1999 episodes. In 2005, the series was moved to an earlier 9:30am time slot, before the show&#x27;s international licensing was cancelled due to the music copyright fees. &quot;Passions&quot; then went into re-runs in a 2am weekday-morning time slot, before ultimately ending with a &quot;series finale.&quot;

=== Croatia ===
In Croatia, private televizor Nova TV aired the first two seasons of the show (520 episodes). The show was well received by the public, but badly by the critics.

==Awards and nominations==

&quot;Passions&quot; has been honored with numerous awards and nominations during its run, including Daytime Emmy Awards, Imagen Foundation Awards, and a GLAAD Media Award.

==Critical reception==
At its debut, reviews for the series were mixed. The &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; gave &quot;Passions&quot; a &quot;bleak prognosis&quot; regarding the Princess Diana controversy. Their critic wrote: &quot;A show&#x27;s dearth of creativity is evident when it shamelessly keeps picking over the bones of the dead. &quot;Passions&quot; seems to have a death wish.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote that apart from the show&#x27;s supernatural elements, &quot;&quot;Passions&quot; would appear indistinguishable from almost any other soap opera.&quot; Unlike the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, Time approved of the Princess Diana link, stating that it showed that &quot;Passions&quot; was not &quot;devoid of promise&quot; and that the storyline showed &quot;flashes of a certain kind of genius.&quot;

By 2001, Michael Logan of &quot;TV Guide&quot; remarked of &quot;Passions&quot;, &quot;There hasn&#x27;t been this sort of buzz about a soap since the Luke and Laura days on &quot;General Hospital&quot;...It&#x27;s unlike anything else out there. There&#x27;s a real sense of hipness to it.&quot;

Craig Tomashoff of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the campy storylines by calling &quot;Passions&quot; the &quot;&quot;Twin Peaks&quot; of daytime&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s a staggeringly psychotic blend of supernatural thriller, melodramatic soap opera and situation comedy, featuring acting that would make a pro wrestler blush. I&#x27;m never quite sure whether this is a &quot;laughing at&quot; or a &quot;laughing with&quot; kind of show; either way, I&#x27;m still laughing.&quot;

==Cast==
===Main===
===Noted guest stars===

In a nod to &quot;Bewitched&quot;, Bernard Fox appeared as that series&#x27; &quot;Dr. Bombay&quot; on &quot;Passions&quot; in 1999 and 2000. Alice Ghostley, who portrayed bumbling witch Esmeralda on &quot;Bewitched&quot;, also appeared on &quot;Passions&quot; in 2000 as the ghost of Matilda Matthews, a friend and rival witch from Tabitha&#x27;s past in colonial New England. Comedian Ruth Buzzi portrayed Nurse Kravitz, an eccentric nurse who discovers that the character Endora has a demon tail, in 2003. Marla Gibbs appeared in 2004 and 2005 as Irma Johnson, the cantankerous aunt of Eve Russell and Liz Sanbourne. Gibbs was nominated for an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama Series for the role. From 2005 to 2006, Julia Duffy portrayed the Mother Superior at the convent to which Whitney Russell flees, and Georgia Engel played Esmeralda, Tabitha&#x27;s childhood rival, in a 2007 &quot;Wicked&quot;-themed storyline.

Professional basketball player Robert Horry appeared as himself in 1999, as did singer Mýa in 2003 and the band Scissor Sisters in 2007. Judge Mablean Ephriam also portrayed herself in a 2003 fantasy sequence in which the character T. C. and Eve Russell go on the &quot;Divorce Court&quot; television program.

The band Scissor Sisters appeared on two February 2007 episodes and performed two songs from their &quot;Ta-Dah&quot; album: &quot;Land of a Thousand Words&quot; on February 8 and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Feel Like Dancin&#x27;&quot; on February 9.

Juliet Mills&#x27; daughter Melissa Caulfield appeared in 1999 and 2005 as Nanny Phoebe Figalilly, a role played by Mills in the sitcom &quot;Nanny and the Professor&quot;. Gabby Tamargo, daughter of Eva Tamargo, portrayed a young version of the elder Tamargo&#x27;s character, Pilar Lopez-Fitzgerald, in 2008.

==&quot;Hidden Passions&quot;==

In 2001, HarperEntertainment released &quot;Hidden Passions: Secrets from the Diaries of Tabitha Lenox&quot;, a tie-in novelization presented as Tabitha&#x27;s diary, exposing the secrets and pasts of the town&#x27;s residents. &quot;Passions&quot; featured a storyline involving Tabitha and Timmy promoting the book, which reached No. 4 on the real-life &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list and garnered the series two alternative covers of &quot;TV Guide&quot; in July 2001. While the novel was billed as being canonical, by the show&#x27;s final episode, the televised canon had diverged significantly from the novel since its publication.

<text>Corn dollies or corn mothers are a form of straw work made as part of harvest customs of Europe before mechanisation.

Scholars of the 18th and 19th centuries theorized that before Christianisation, in traditional pagan European culture it was believed that the spirit of the corn (in American English, &quot;corn&quot; would be &quot;grain&quot;) lived amongst the crop, and that the harvest made it effectively homeless. James Frazer devotes chapters in &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; to &quot;Corn-Mother and Corn-Maiden in Northern Europe&quot; (chs. 45–48) and adduces European folkloric examples collected in great abundance by the folklorist Wilhelm Mannhardt. Among the customs attached to the last of the harvest were hollow shapes fashioned from the last sheaf of wheat or other cereal crops. The corn spirit would then spend the winter in this home until the &quot;corn dolly&quot; was ploughed into the first furrow of the new season.

==Background==
James George Frazer discusses the Corn-mother and the Corn-maiden in Northern Europe, and the harvest rituals that were being practised at the beginning of the 20th century:


Many more customs are instanced by Frazer. For example, the term &quot;Old Woman&quot; (Latin &quot;&quot;) was in use for such &quot;corn dolls&quot; among the Germanic pagans of Flanders in the 7th century, where Saint Eligius discouraged them from their old practices: &quot;[Do not] make vetulas, (little figures of the Old Woman), little deer or iotticos or set tables [for the house-elf, compare Puck] at night or exchange New Year gifts or supply superfluous drinks [a Yule custom].&quot; Frazer writes: &quot;In East Prussia, at the rye or wheat harvest, the reapers call out to the woman who binds the last sheaf, “You are getting the Old Grandmother...In Scotland, when the last corn was cut after Hallowmas, the female figure made out of it was sometimes called the Carlin or Carline, that is, the Old Woman.&quot;

The mechanisation of harvesting cereal crops probably brought an end to traditional straw dolly and figure making at the beginning of the 20th century. In the UK corn dolly making was revived in the 1950s and 1960s. Farm workers created new creations including replicas of farm implements and models such as windmills and large figures. New shapes and designs with different techniques were being created. In the 1960/70s several books were published on the subject. (see Lettice Sandford) The simple origins of the craft had been lost and new folk lore stories were added to the original ideas.

The Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford and the Museum of English Rural Life in Reading both have collections of corn dollies from around the world.

==Materials used==
* Great Britain: mainly wheat, oats, rye and barley
* Ireland: rush
* Southern France: palm leaves

With the advent of the combine harvester, the old-fashioned, long-stemmed and hollow-stemmed wheat varieties were replaced with knee-high, pithy varieties. However, a number of English and Scottish farmers are still growing the traditional varieties of wheat, such as Maris Wigeon, Squarehead Master, Elite Le Peuple. mainly because they are in great demand in thatching, a craft which is enjoying a renaissance, with customers facing long waiting lists for having their roofs thatched or repaired.

==Types==
Corn dollies and other similar harvest straw work can be divided into these groups:

===Traditional corn dollies named after counties or place names of England, Scotland and Wales===

* Other corn dollies include Anglesey Rattle, Cambridgeshire Umbrella, Durham Chandelier, Claidheach (Scotland) Herefordshire Fan, Kincardine Maiden (Scotland), Leominster Maer (Herefordshire), Norfolk Lantern, Northamptonshire Horns, Okehampton Mare, Oxford Crown, Suffolk Bell, Suffolk Horseshoe and Whip, Teme Valley Crown (Shropshire), Welsh Border Fan, Welsh Long Fan, Worcester Crown.
* There are also corn dolly designs from other countries, for example the Kusa Dasi from Turkey, named after the town of Kuşadası.

===Countryman&#x27;s favours and other harvest designs===
A countryman&#x27;s favour was usually a plait of three straws and tied into a loose knot to represent a heart. It is reputed to have been made by a young man with straws picked up after the harvest and given to his loved one. If she was wearing it next to her heart when he saw her again then he would know that his love was reciprocated. Three straws can be plaited using the hair plait or a cat&#x27;s foot plait. Favours can be made with two, three, four or more straws.

Other examples include:
* Bride of the Corn (&quot;Aruseh&quot; in North Africa)
* Devonshire Cross, a harvest cross from Topsham, Devon
* Dedham Cross
* St Brigid&#x27;s Cross; the National Museum of Ireland has many examples of harvest crosses.

===Fringes===
* Larnaca Fringe
* Montenegrin Fringe
* Lancashire Fringe

===Large straw figures===
These are representations of animals or humanoid beings made from an entire sheaf. They are known by a variety of names, depending on location and also the time of harvesting:
* The Goddess Ceres
* Maiden or Bride (harvest before All Saints):
* Kirn Dolly (Roxburghshire)
* Kirn Baby (Lothians)
* Kern Baby (Northumberland)
* The Neck (Cornwall and Devon)
* Hare (Galloway)
* Lame Goat, Scottish Gaelic: gobhar bacach (Harris, Skye, Glenelg)
* Straw dog - (Shetland, Orkney)
* Cailleach Gaelic: Old Woman or The Hag (harvest after All Saints)
* Caseg Fedi or harvest mare in Wales.
* &#x27;Y Wrach&#x27; or &#x27;The Hag&#x27; in Caernarvonshire, Wales
* Whittlesey Straw Bear, the centre of a ceremony in Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, every January. Its origins are obscure.

===Tied straw work===
Here the straw is not plaited, but tied with yarn, wool, raffia or similar. This type of straw work is particularly popular in Scandinavia and German-speaking countries. Examples of these are the Oro (Swedish Straw Crown); the Tomte or Nisse; and smaller versions of the Yule Goat.
===Ridge finials===
* These are straw sculptures which are placed on the ridge of the thatched roof. They are sometimes purely for decoration, but can be the signature of a particular thatcher. Animal shapes (birds, foxes etc.) are the most common. In days gone by, hay-ricks would also be thatched, and topped with a straw decoration.

<text>A BLT is a type of sandwich, named for the initials of its primary ingredients, bacon, lettuce, and tomato. It can be made with varying recipes according to personal preference. Simple variants include using different types of lettuce or tomatoes, toasting or not, or adding mayonnaise. More pronounced variants can include using turkey bacon or tofu in place of bacon, removing the lettuce entirely, or adding other ingredients such as a fried egg, avocado, or sprouts.

==History==
Although its ingredients have existed for many years, there is little evidence of BLT sandwich recipes before 1900. In the &quot;1903 Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book&quot;, a recipe for a club sandwich included bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and a slice of turkey sandwiched between two slices of bread. While the 1928 book &quot;Seven Hundred Sandwiches&quot; by Florence A. Cowles includes a section on bacon sandwiches, the recipes often include pickles and none contain tomato.

The BLT became popular after World War II because of the rapid expansion of supermarkets, which made its ingredients available year-round. The initials, representing &quot;bacon, lettuce, tomato&quot;, likely began in the U.S. restaurant industry as shorthand for the sandwich, but it is unclear when this transferred to the public consciousness. For example, a 1951 edition of the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; makes reference to the sandwich, although it does not use its initials, describing a scene in which: &quot;On the tray, invariably, are a bowl of soup, a toasted sandwich of bacon, lettuce and tomato, and a chocolate milk shake.&quot;

A 1954 issue of &quot;Modern Hospital&quot; contains a meal suggestion that includes: &quot;Bean Soup, Toasted Bacon Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich, Pickles, Jellied Banana Salad, Cream Dressing, and Pound Cake.&quot; By 1958, Hellmann&#x27;s Mayonnaise advertised their product as &quot;traditional on bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwiches&quot;, suggesting that the combination had been around for some time. However, there are several references to a &quot;B.L.T.&quot; in the early 1970s, including in one review of Bruce Jay Friedman&#x27;s play entitled &quot;Steambath&quot; titled: &quot;A B.L.T. for God – hold the mayo.&quot; The abbreviation used in title references a line of dialogue in the play in which God yells, &quot;Send up a bacon and lettuce and tomato sandwich, hold the mayo. You burn the toast, I&#x27;ll smite you down with my terrible swift sword.&quot;

===Popularity===
As the sixth-most popular sandwich in the United States, it falls behind the ham sandwich, the roast beef sandwich, turkey sandwich, grilled chicken sandwich, and the grilled cheese sandwich. A 2008 poll by OnePoll showed that the BLT was the &quot;nation&#x27;s favourite&quot; sandwich in the UK. BLT sandwiches are popular especially in the summer, following the tomato harvest. In the United States, the BLT season is associated with an increase in the price of pork-bellies, which are processed into bacon.

==Ingredients and preparation==

While there are variations on the BLT, the essential ingredients are bacon, lettuce, and tomato, between two slices of bread (usually white), often toasted. The quantity and quality of the ingredients are matters of personal preference. The bacon can be well cooked or tender, but as it &quot;carries&quot; the other flavours, chefs recommend using higher quality meat; in particular, chef Edward Lee states &quot;Your general supermarket bacon is not going to cut the mustard.&quot;

Iceberg lettuce is a common choice because it does not add too much flavour while adding crunch. Food writer Ed Levine has suggested that BLT does not require lettuce at all, as it is &quot;superfluous&quot;, a suggestion that Jon Bonné, lifestyle editor at MSNBC, described as &quot;shocking&quot;. Michele Anna Jordan, author of &quot;The BLT Cookbook&quot;, believes the tomato is the key ingredient and recommends the use of the beefsteak tomato as it has more flesh and fewer seeds. Similarly, chef and food writer J. Kenji Lopez-Alt believes that a BLT is not a bacon sandwich with additional ingredients, but rather, a tomato sandwich seasoned with bacon. For that reason, Lopez-Alt argues that the BLT is a seasonal sandwich best made with high-quality summer tomatoes.

The sandwich is sometimes served with dressings, like mayonnaise. The bread can be of any variety, white or wholemeal, toasted or not, depending on personal preference.

===Variations===

The sandwich has a high sodium and fat content, and has been specifically targeted by UK café chains in an effort to reduce salt and fat. Due to this, low-fat mayonnaise is a common substitute along with low salt bread and less fatty bacon. A more visible solution is to use turkey bacon in lieu of normal bacon. One of the variations on the BLT is the club sandwich, a two-layered sandwich in which one layer is a BLT. The other layer can be almost any sort of sliced meat, normally chicken or turkey.

==In culture==

===United States===
In 1963, pop art sculptor Claes Oldenburg created &quot;Giant BLT&quot;, a soft sculpture representing the sandwich, now in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art. It measures and uses vinyl, kapok and wood, painted in acrylic. Every time it is moved, it must be restacked, which means it varies between exhibits. The artist has said that he has not set it up personally since its creation in 1963.

In 2003, Michele Anna Jordan set a record for the world&#x27;s largest BLT, which measured in length. It was prepared at a 2003 tomato festival in Sonoma County, California and had an area of . In 2008, Marie Ganister and Glenda Castelli created a BLT – a sandwich originally planned with Jordan. The record was broken again by the Iron Barley restaurant in St. Louis, Missouri, with a BLT measuring , and is currently held by Bentley Dining Services for their 2009 attempt, measuring .

===United Kingdom===
In 2004, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; reported that the sandwich chosen by a politician as his &quot;favourite&quot; is loaded with political symbolism. For example, it suggested that a chicken tikka sandwich would be a &quot;gentle nod to an imperial past and a firm statement of a multicultural present and future&quot;. The article went on to explain that the then Leader of the Opposition William Hague had accused the then Prime Minister Tony Blair of being a hypocrite with regards to food, telling one portion of society that his favourite meal was fish and chips and another that it was a fresh fettuccine dish. The conclusion of the article was that Blair chose the BLT as his favourite sandwich, which appeals to all classes.

<text>The Gordon Riots of 1780 were several days&#x27; rioting in London motivated by anti-Catholic sentiment. They began with a large and orderly protest against the Papists Act 1778, which was intended to reduce official discrimination against British Catholics enacted by the Popery Act 1698. Lord George Gordon, head of the Protestant Association, argued that the law would enable Catholics to join the British Army and plot treason. The protest led to widespread rioting and looting, including attacks on Newgate Prison and the Bank of England and was the most destructive in the history of London.

Violence started on 2 June 1780, with the looting and burning of Catholic chapels in foreign embassies. Local magistrates, afraid of drawing the mob&#x27;s anger, did not invoke the Riot Act. There was no repression until the government finally sent in the army, resulting in an estimated 300–700 deaths. The main violence lasted until 9 June 1780.

The riots occurred near the height of the American War of Independence, when Britain, with no major allies, was fighting American rebels, France, and Spain. Public opinion, especially in middle-class and elite circles, repudiated anti-Catholicism and lower-class violence, and rallied behind Lord North&#x27;s government. Demands were made for a London police force. There appeared painted on the wall of Newgate Prison a proclamation that the inmates had been freed by the authority of &quot;His Majesty, King Mob&quot;. The term &quot;&quot; afterwards denoted an unruly and fearsome proletariat.

Edmund Burke later recalled the riots as a dangerous foretaste of the 1789 French Revolution:

==Background==
The stated intention of the Papists Act 1778 was, as its preamble notes, to mitigate some of the official discrimination against Roman Catholics in Great Britain. It absolved Catholics from taking the religious oath when joining the British Armed Forces as well as granting a few and limited liberties. There were strong expedient reasons for this change. British military forces at the time were stretched very thinly in what had become a global American War of Independence, with conflicts ongoing with France, Spain, and the new United States. The recruitment of Catholics would be a significant help to address this shortfall of manpower.

The 1698 anti-Catholic laws had largely been ignored for many years and were rarely enforced. Because of this, many leading Catholics were opposed to the repeal of these laws, fearing it would stir up anti-Catholic sentiment for little practical return. It was also pointed out that large numbers of Catholics, recruited in Ireland and the Scottish Highlands, were already serving in the military. In spite of this, the government decided to press ahead with the Bill, and had it introduced in Parliament by Sir George Savile.

===Protestant Association===
The Protestant Association of London had the support of leading Calvinist religious figures, including Rowland Hill, Erasmus Middleton, and John Rippon. Lord George Gordon became its president in 1779, in an effort to force the repeal of the Papists Act. An articulate propagandist, though eccentric, Gordon inflamed the mob with fears of Papism and a return to absolute monarchical rule. He implied that Catholics in the military would, given a chance, join forces with their co-religionists on the Continent and attack Britain. He enjoyed popularity in Scotland where he took part in a successful campaign to prevent the same legislation from being introduced into Scots law, although the Act continued in force in England and Wales and in Ireland. The success in obstructing the law in Scotland led Gordon to believe he could enjoy similar success in the rest of Britain and Ireland. Early in 1780 Gordon had several audiences with King George III but was unable to convince him of what he saw as the dangers of the act. George III initially humoured Gordon, but grew increasingly irritated with him and eventually refused any future audiences.

The political climate deteriorated rapidly. On 29 May 1780, Gordon called a meeting of the Protestant Association, and his followers subsequently marched on the House of Commons to deliver a petition demanding the repeal of the Act.

===Other causes===
After the first march to Parliament, further riots occurred involving groups whose grievances were nationalist, economic, or political, rather than religious. Aside from the issue of Catholic emancipation, it has also been suggested that the driving force of the riots was Britain&#x27;s poor economic situation: the loss of trade during the war had led to falling wages, rising prices, and periodic unemployment. As Rudé noted, there was no general attack on the Catholic community, &quot;the victims of the riots&quot; being distinguished by the fact they were &quot;on the whole, persons of substance&quot;.

Voting in parliamentary elections was restricted by a property threshold, so most Londoners were unable to vote and many hoped for reforms to make Parliament more representative of the people. However, Paul Monod has argued that &quot;no matter how much one would like to interpret the Gordon Riots ... as economically motivated, they remain fundamentally anti-Catholic in character&quot;.

Shortly after the riots had broken out, the Duke of Richmond suggested that they were directly attributable to the passing of the Quebec Act six years before, which, among other provisions, removed the reference to the Protestant faith from the oath of allegiance, and guaranteed free practice of Catholicism. This view was ridiculed by many of his colleagues.

Another suggested cause was Britain&#x27;s weakened international position, which had arisen from the country&#x27;s isolation in Europe and the disappointing news coming from the ongoing war. Some rioters were against the continuation of the war, and many strongly supported American independence, while others were angry that Britain&#x27;s war effort was being mishandled by Lord North. In many cases a mix of issues blended together and drove people to take part in the rioting.

==Riots==

===March on Parliament===
On 2 June 1780 a huge crowd, estimated at 40,000 to 60,000 strong, assembled and marched on the Houses of Parliament. Many carried flags and banners proclaiming &quot;No Popery&quot;, and most wore blue cockades which had become the symbol of their movement. As they marched, their numbers swelled. They attempted to force their way into the House of Commons, but without success. Gordon, petition in hand, and wearing in his hat the blue cockade of the Protestant Association, entered the Commons and presented the petition. Outside, the situation quickly got out of hand and a riot erupted. Members of the House of Lords were attacked as they arrived, and a number of carriages were vandalised and destroyed.

Despite being aware of the possibility of trouble, the authorities had failed to take steps to prevent violence breaking out. The Prime Minister, Lord North, had forgotten to issue an order mobilising the small number of Constables in the area. Those that were present in the House of Commons were not strong enough to take on the angry mob. Eventually a detachment of soldiers was summoned, and they dispersed the crowd without violence. Inside the House of Commons, the petition was overwhelmingly dismissed by a vote of 192 to 6.

===Embassies attacked===
Once the mob around Parliament had dispersed, it seemed to the government that the worst of the disorder was over. However, the same night a crowd gathered and attacked the Roman Catholic Sardinian Embassy Chapel in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields. Bow Street Runners and soldiers were called out and made thirteen arrests, although most of the ringleaders had managed to escape. The same night the chapel of the Bavarian Embassy in Warwick Street, Soho, was destroyed and crowds caused random violence in streets known to house rich Catholics.

===Moorfields===

The area of Moorfields, one of the poorest parts of the city, was the home of many Irish immigrant workers and had a large area of open ground where crowds could assemble. Despite the appeal of a prominent Irish merchant, James Malo, to the Lord Mayor, Brackley Kennett, no additional protection was offered to the area. During 3 June a crowd had gathered in Moorfields, and by nightfall it began to go on the rampage. Malo&#x27;s house was amongst the many to be sacked and burned.

Newgate Prison, where rioters arrested on 2 June were being held, was attacked and largely destroyed, as was The Clink. This allowed large numbers of prisoners to escape, many of whom were never recaptured. Severe destruction was inflicted on Catholic churches and homes and chapels on the grounds of several embassies, as well as on New Prison, Fleet Prison, and the house of the Lord Chief Justice, William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, including the destruction of the house&#x27;s library. On 7 June, called &quot;Black Wednesday&quot; by Horace Walpole, the riot reached its climax. An attempt on the Bank of England was narrowly averted when a combination of the London Military Association and regular troops repulsed rioters, resulting in heavy casualties.

===Army repression===

The army was called out on 7 June and given orders to fire upon groups of four or more who refused to disperse. About 285 people were shot dead, with another 200 wounded. Around 450 of the rioters were arrested. Of those arrested, about twenty or thirty were later tried and executed. Gordon was arrested and charged with high treason but was acquitted. Brackley Kennett, the Lord Mayor, was convicted of criminal negligence for not reading out the Riot Act and was given a £1,000 fine. The military units which dealt with the rioters included the Horse Guards, Foot Guards, Inns of Court Yeomanry, the Honourable Artillery Company, line infantry including the 2nd (Queen&#x27;s Royal) Regiment, and militia from the city and neighbouring counties. The defence of the Bank of England was conducted by the 9th Regiment of Foot under the command of Thomas Twisleton, 13th Baron Saye and Sele.

==Aftermath==
The riots damaged the reputation of Britain across Europe, where many saw British constitutional monarchy as an inherently unstable form of government. This came at a time when Britain was searching for allies, particularly Catholic Austria, in the American War of Independence to challenge the strong coalition the French had built. Britain had also initiated secret negotiations with Catholic Spain to end Spanish support of the United States. After learning of the riots, the Spanish government pulled back from peace negotiations with Britain, concerned that the disorder would lead to a widespread collapse of the current British administration.

The riots highlighted the problems Britain faced by not having a professional police force, a notion which was opposed as foreign and absolutist. The day after the riots broke out, the Earl of Shelburne shocked many by proposing in parliament that Britain should consider forming a force modelled on the French police.

The riots damaged the popularity of the radical politician John Wilkes, who led citizen militia against the rioters. Many of his followers saw this as a betrayal; some of them may have been among the rioters. A pamphlet and a book of poems defending the role of Gordon were written and published by the polemicist and hymn-writer Maria De Fleury.

The events at the Bank of England started a tradition where a detachment of soldiers, usually from the Brigade of Guards, would march to the bank to perform security duties. Until 1963 the duty was performed by the Guards in Home Service Dress with bearskin, though tennis shoes were worn inside the bank. From that date until 31 March 1973 the detachment became more functional than ceremonial, doing their duties in service dress with automatic weapons.

==Cultural references==

George Walker&#x27;s anti-Jacobin novel &quot;The Vagabond&quot; (1799) anachronistically resituates the Gordon Riots amidst the political events of the 1790s. Its narrator unwittingly becomes a prominent figure in the riots, which Walker depicts as solely destructive and acquisitive.

Maria Edgeworth&#x27;s 1817 novel &quot;Harrington&quot; contains a vivid evocation of the Gordon Riots, with two unsympathetic characters taken for Papists and finding refuge in the home of the rich Spanish Jew, the father of the young Jewish woman at the centre of the love story.

Charles Dickens&#x27; 1841 novel &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; is centered on a long and detailed description of the Gordon Riots and features Lord George in a prominent role.

John Creasey&#x27;s 1974 novel &quot;The Masters of Bow Street&quot; depicts the Gordon Riots and the recalcitrance of Lord North to the establishment of a police force.

In Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;Sharpe&quot; novels (1981–2007), the protagonist Richard Sharpe&#x27;s mother was killed during the riots while he was still a child.

Miranda Hearn&#x27;s 2003 historical novel &quot;A Life Everlasting&quot; depicts the main protagonists caught up in the riots as innocent Londoners.

In the film &quot;The Great Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Swindle&quot;, a scene set in 1780 refers to the Gordon Riots, showing the Sex Pistols hung in effigy.

&quot;BABYLONdon&quot;, a novel by English SF/Fantasy author John Whitbourn (2020), blends a detailed depiction of the Gordon Riots with supernatural plot elements and an apocalyptic denouement.

&quot;The Invisibles&quot;, a comic series by Grant Morrison features a principal character mostly known as King Mob.

Mentioned by Peter O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s character to Aldo Ray in &quot;The Day They Robbed The Bank of England&quot;, referencing that he and his men had been guarding the titular bank in a certain fashion since &quot;the Gordon Riots in 1780.&quot;

<text>Sharon Christa McAuliffe ( Corrigan; September 2, 1948 – January 28, 1986) was an American teacher and astronaut from Concord, New Hampshire who died on the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; on mission STS-51-L, where she was serving as a payload specialist.

McAuliffe received her bachelor&#x27;s degree in education and history from Framingham State College in 1970 and her master&#x27;s degree in education, supervision and administration from Bowie State University in 1978. McAuliffe took a teaching position as a social studies teacher at Concord High School in New Hampshire in 1983.

In 1985, McAuliffe was selected from more than 11,000 applicants to the NASA Teacher in Space Project and was scheduled to become the first teacher to fly in space. As a member of mission STS-51-L, she was planning to conduct experiments and teach two lessons from &quot;Challenger&quot;. On January 28, 1986, the shuttle broke apart 1 minute 13 seconds after launch, killing all onboard. After her death, several schools were named in her honor, and McAuliffe was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 2004. In 2024, a statue of McAuliffe was installed on the grounds of the New Hampshire State Capitol.

==Early life==
Sharon Christa Corrigan was born on September 2, 1948, in Boston as the oldest of the five children of accountant Edward Christopher Corrigan (1922–1990), who was of English and Irish descent; and Grace Mary Corrigan (née George; 1924–2018), a substitute teacher, whose father was of Lebanese Maronite descent. McAuliffe was a great niece of Lebanese-American historian Philip Khuri Hitti. McAuliffe was known by her middle name from an early age, and in later years she signed her name &quot;S. Christa Corrigan&quot;, and eventually &quot;S. Christa McAuliffe&quot;.

The year McAuliffe was born, her father was completing his sophomore year at Boston College. Not long after, he took a job as an assistant comptroller in a Boston department store, and they moved to Framingham, Massachusetts, where McAuliffe attended Marian High School, graduating in 1966. She went on to earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1970 from Framingham State College, now Framingham State University. As a youth, McAuliffe was inspired by Project Mercury and the Apollo Moon landing program. The day after John Glenn orbited the Earth in &quot;Friendship 7&quot;, she told a friend at Marian High, &quot;Do you realize that someday people will be going to the Moon? Maybe even taking a bus, and I want to do that!&quot; McAuliffe wrote years later on her NASA application form: &quot;I watched the Space Age being born, and I would like to participate.&quot;

In 1970, McAuliffe married her longtime boyfriend whom she had known since high school, Steven J. McAuliffe, a 1970 graduate of the Virginia Military Institute. The couple moved closer to Washington, D.C., so that he could attend the Georgetown University Law Center. They had two children, Scott and Caroline, who were nine and six respectively when she died.

McAuliffe obtained her first teaching position in 1970, as an American history teacher at Benjamin Foulois Junior High School in Morningside, Maryland. From 1971 to 1978, she taught history and civics at Thomas Johnson Middle School in Lanham, Maryland. In addition to teaching, McAuliffe completed a Master of Arts in education supervision and administration from Bowie State University in Maryland. In 1978, she moved to Concord, New Hampshire, when Steven accepted a job as an assistant to the New Hampshire Attorney General. McAuliffe taught 7th and 8th grade American history and English in Concord, New Hampshire, and ninth grade English in Bow, New Hampshire, before taking a teaching post at Concord High School in 1983.

McAuliffe was a social studies teacher, and taught several courses including American history, law, and economics, in addition to a self-designed course: &quot;The American Woman&quot;. Taking field trips and bringing in speakers were an important part of her teaching techniques. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, McAuliffe &quot;emphasized the impact of ordinary people on history, saying they were as important to the historical record as kings, politicians or generals.&quot;

==Teacher in Space Project==

In 1984, President Ronald Reagan announced the Teacher in Space Project, and McAuliffe learned about NASA&#x27;s efforts to find their first civilian, an educator, to fly into space. NASA wanted to find an &quot;ordinary person,&quot; a gifted teacher who could communicate with students while in orbit. McAuliffe became one of more than 11,000 applicants.

NASA hoped that sending a teacher into space would increase public interest in the Space Shuttle program, and also demonstrate the reliability of space flight at a time when the agency was under continuous pressure to find financial support. President Reagan said it would also remind Americans of the important role that teachers and education serve in their country.

The Council of Chief State School Officers, a non-profit organization of public officials in education, was chosen by NASA to coordinate the selection process. Out of the initial applicant pool, 114 semi-finalists were nominated by state, territorial, and agency review panels. McAuliffe was one of two teachers nominated by the state of New Hampshire. The semi-finalists gathered in Washington, D.C., from June 22–27, 1985, for a conference on space education and to meet with the Review Panel that would select the 10 finalists.
On July 1, 1985, McAuliffe was announced as one of the 10 finalists, and on July 7 she traveled to Johnson Space Center for a week of thorough medical examinations and briefings about space flight. The finalists were interviewed by an evaluation committee composed of senior NASA officials, and the committee made recommendations to NASA Administrator James M. Beggs for the primary and backup candidates for the Teacher in Space Project. On July 19, 1985, Vice President George H. W. Bush announced that McAuliffe had been selected for the position. Another teacher, Barbara Morgan, served as her backup. According to Mark Travis of the &quot;Concord Monitor&quot;, it was McAuliffe&#x27;s manner that set her apart from the other candidates. NASA official Alan Ladwig said &quot;she had an infectious enthusiasm&quot;, and NASA psychiatrist Terrence McGuire told &quot;New Woman&quot; magazine that &quot;she was the most broad-based, best-balanced person of the 10.&quot;

Later that year, McAuliffe and Morgan each took a year-long leave of absence from teaching in order to train for a Space Shuttle mission in early 1986. NASA paid both their salaries. While not a member of the NASA Astronaut Corps, McAuliffe was to be part of the STS-51-L crew, and would conduct experiments and teach lessons from space. Her planned duties included basic science experiments in the fields of chromatography, hydroponics, magnetism, and Newton&#x27;s laws. She was also planning to conduct two 15-minute classes from space, including a tour of the spacecraft, called &quot;The Ultimate Field Trip&quot;, and a lesson about the benefits of space travel, called &quot;Where We&#x27;ve Been, Where We&#x27;re Going, Why&quot;. The lessons were to be broadcast to millions of schoolchildren via closed-circuit TV. To record her thoughts, McAuliffe intended to keep a personal journal like a &quot;woman on the Conestoga wagons pioneering the West.&quot;

After being chosen to be the first teacher in space, McAuliffe was a guest on several television programs, including &quot;Good Morning America&quot;; the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot;; the &quot;Today Show&quot;; and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, where, when asked about the mission, she stated, &quot;If you&#x27;re offered a seat on a rocket ship, don&#x27;t ask what seat. Just get on.&quot; She had an immediate rapport with the media, and the Teacher in Space Project received popular attention as a result.

==Disaster and aftermath==
On January 28, 1986, McAuliffe boarded &quot;Challenger&quot; with the other six crew members of STS-51-L. Only 73 seconds into its flight at an altitude of , the shuttle broke apart, resulting in the deaths of all seven crew members.

According to NASA, the accident had such a significant effect on the nation in part because of the excitement over McAuliffe&#x27;s presence on the shuttle. Many schoolchildren were viewing the launch live, and media coverage of the accident was extensive.

Barbara Morgan, her backup, became a professional astronaut in January 1998, and flew on Space Shuttle mission STS-118, to the International Space Station, on August 8, 2007, aboard &quot;Endeavour&quot;, the orbiter that replaced &quot;Challenger&quot;.

==Legacy==
McAuliffe was buried at Blossom Hill Cemetery in her hometown of Concord. McAuliffe has since been honored at many events, including the Daytona 500 NASCAR race in 1986. The McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center in Concord, the Christa Corrigan McAuliffe Center for Education and Teaching Excellence at Framingham State University, the Christa McAuliffe Intermediate School in Brooklyn, NY, the McAuliffe Branch Library in Framingham, MA, the Christa McAuliffe Adult Learning Center in Baton Rouge, LA, the S. Christa McAuliffe Elementary School in Lowell, Massachusetts, Christa McAuliffe Elementary School in Sammamish, Washington and Christa McAuliffe Middle School in Jackson, NJ, Christa McAuliffe Middle School in Bay City, MI, and The Christa McAuliffe Residential Community (CMRC) dorm and wellness center on the campus of her alma mater of Bowie State University in Bowie, Maryland, were named in her memory, as are the asteroid 3352 McAuliffe, the crater McAuliffe on the Moon, and a crater on the planet Venus, which was named McAuliffe by the Soviet Union. Approximately 40 schools around the world have been named after McAuliffe, including the Christa McAuliffe Space Education Center in Pleasant Grove, Utah. Christa McAuliffe Park in Green Bay, WI is named after her.

Scholarships and other events have also been established in McAuliffe&#x27;s memory. The Christa McAuliffe Technology Conference has been held in Nashua, New Hampshire, every year since 1986, and is devoted to the use of technology in all aspects of education. The Nebraska McAuliffe Prize honors a Nebraska teacher each year for courage and excellence in education. Grants in McAuliffe&#x27;s name, honoring innovative teachers, are provided by the American Association of State Colleges and Universities and the National Council for the Social Studies.

The Christa McAuliffe Space Center in Pleasant Grove, Utah, teaches school children about space, and is visited by students from around the world. It has a number of space flight simulators.
The center was started in 1990 by Victor Williamson, an educator at Central Elementary School. It is a 4,000-square-foot (370 m2) building added onto Central Elementary. It aims to teach astronomy and social studies through the use of simulators; the first, Voyager, proved itself popular, and a new planetarium was added in 2020. As the years passed, the demand for flights expanded and new ships were commissioned.

McAuliffe was portrayed by Karen Allen in the 1990 TV movie &quot;Challenger&quot;. In October 2018, it was announced that Michelle Williams was cast to portray McAuliffe in &quot;The Challenger&quot;, another retelling of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. In 2019, McAuliffe was portrayed by Erika Waldorf in the independent film &quot;The Challenger Disaster&quot;. The spaceship on the 1996–1997 children&#x27;s science-fiction series &quot;Space Cases&quot;, about a group of students lost in space, was called &quot;Christa&quot;. In 2005, the documentary film Christa McAuliffe: Reach for the Stars, celebrating the life and legacy of Christa McAuliffe, premiered on the film festival circuit, with screenings at the prestigious High Falls Film Festival and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. Directed by Renee Sotile and Mary Jo Godges, the film is narrated by Academy Award winner Susan Sarandon and features an original song, “Christa’s Song,” written and performed by Grammy Award winner Carly Simon. January 2006, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Christa McAuliffe’s passing and the tragedy of the Space Shuttle Challenger, CNN aired Christa McAuliffe: Reach for the Stars over 20 times in the &quot;CNN Presents&quot; format, featuring an on-set introduction and narration by Paula Zahn.

McAuliffe&#x27;s parents worked with Framingham State College to establish the McAuliffe Center. Her husband, Steven J. McAuliffe, later remarried, and in 1992 became a federal judge, serving with the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire in Concord. Her son, Scott, completed graduate studies in marine biology, and her daughter, Caroline, went on to pursue the same career as her mother: teaching. On July 23, 2004, McAuliffe and all the other 13 astronauts lost in both the &quot;Challenger&quot; and &quot;Columbia&quot; disasters were posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President George W. Bush.

On January 28, 2016, several teachers who competed alongside McAuliffe for a seat on the &quot;Challenger&quot; traveled to Cape Canaveral, Florida, for a 30th anniversary remembrance service, along with her widower, Steven, and son, Scott. After remarking that 30 years had passed, Steven said &quot;&quot;Challenger&quot; will always be an event that occurred just recently. Our thoughts and memories of Christa will always be fresh and comforting.&quot; In 2017, McAuliffe was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

In 2019, Congress passed the Christa McAuliffe Commemorative Coin Act which was signed into law by President Donald Trump on October 9, 2019. The bill allows the Department of the Treasury to &quot;issue not more than 350,000 $1 silver coins in commemoration of Christa McAuliffe.&quot; The coins were minted in 2021.

On September 2, 2024 - McAuliffe&#x27;s 76th birthday - a statue of the astronaut was unveiled at the New Hampshire State Capitol. The statue, sculpted by artist Benjamin Victor, is the first statue of a woman on the state house grounds. Inscribed on the side of the statue&#x27;s pedestal is a quote from McAuliffe: &quot;I touch the future, I teach&quot;.

The documentary &quot;Christa: From Ordinary to Extraordinary&quot; by New Hampshire PBS looks at her life in new Hampshire and Concord, with people she knew talking about what she wanted for students to know about the role of women in history.

<text>In Norse mythology, Svaðilfari is a stallion that fathered the eight-legged horse Sleipnir with Loki (in the form of a mare). Svaðilfari was owned by the disguised and unnamed who built the walls of Asgard.

==Name==
&quot;Svaðilfari&quot; in Old Norse translates as &quot;the one making an unlucky journey&quot; or &quot;unlucky traveler&quot;.

==Attestations==
===&quot;Völuspá hin skamma&quot;===

&quot;Völuspá hin skamma&quot;, contained within &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;, states that Svaðilfari fathered Sleipnir with Loki:

===&quot;Gylfaginning&quot;===
In chapter 42 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, High tells a story set in the early days and after the gods had established Midgard and built Valhöll about an unnamed builder who offered to build a fortification for the gods to protect them from and . Under Loki&#x27;s advice, it was agreed that if the work was completed in one winter with the help of his horse Svaðilfari, the builder would be given Freyja, the sun, and the moon. With Svaðilfari&#x27;s help, the builder made fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of summer, the builder was nearly done.

Because of his role in the making of the wager, the gods declared that Loki would face severe repercussions if he did not think of a way to cause the builder fail to complete his task. That night, the builder drove out to fetch stones with Svaðilfari, and out from the woods, into the clearing, ran a beautiful mare who was, in fact, Loki in disguise. Svaðilfari saw the mare and became frantic, chasing her into the woods. As the two horses ran around all night, the building work could not be finished in time and realising this, the builder went into a rage (), revealing he was a .

When the Æsir realised the builder&#x27;s identity, they disregarded their previous oaths with the builder and called for Thor who killed the builder with Mjöllnir. Due to his night with Svaðilfari, Loki became pregnant and later gave birth to the eight legged horse Sleipnir.

<text>Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Fuller Olsen (born June 13, 1986), also known as the Olsen twins, are American fashion designers and former actresses. Mary-Kate and Ashley made their acting debut as infants playing Michelle Tanner on the television sitcom &quot;Full House&quot; (1987–1995). As they grew older, they began starring in other television shows, films, and media through their own production company, Dualstar. The twins became preteen icons, and some of the wealthiest women in the entertainment industry at a young age.

The Olsens stepped away from acting in the mid-2000s and entered the fashion design industry. They founded their own luxury fashion label in 2006, The Row, based in New York City. They have won several awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA).

==Lives and career==
===Childhood and acting career===

The twins were born in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, to David &quot;Dave&quot; Olsen and Jarnette &quot;Jarnie&quot; (née Jones). Ashley is two minutes older than Mary-Kate. They have an older brother, Trent, and a younger sister, actress Elizabeth, as well as a half-sister, Courtney Taylor, and a half-brother, Jake. The twins&#x27; parents divorced in 1995; Courtney Taylor and Jake are from their father&#x27;s second marriage. The Olsen twins have Norwegian ancestry.

In 1987, at the age of six months, the twins were cast in the role of Michelle Tanner on the ABC sitcom &quot;Full House&quot;. They began filming at nine months old. In order to comply with child labor laws that set strict limits on how long a child actor may work, the sisters took turns playing the role. The Olsens continued to portray Michelle throughout the show&#x27;s run, which concluded in 1995.

In 1992, Mary-Kate and Ashley shared the role of Michelle Tanner when they guest-starred on the &quot;Full House&quot; crossover episode of &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot;. While starring on &quot;Full House&quot;, the Olsens also began appearing (as separate characters) in films for video and television. The first such film, &quot;To Grandmother&#x27;s House We Go&quot;, debuted in 1992 and featured cameos from several other &quot;Full House&quot; actors. In 1993, the Olsens established the company Dualstar, which would produce the twins&#x27; subsequent films and videos, including 1993&#x27;s &quot;Double, Double, Toil and Trouble&quot; and 1994&#x27;s &quot;How the West Was Fun&quot;. A series of musical mystery videos called &quot;The Adventures of Mary-Kate &amp; Ashley&quot; premiered in 1994 and continued through 1997.

In 1995, following the end of &quot;Full House&quot;, the Olsens made their feature film debut in &quot;It Takes Two&quot;, co-starring Steve Guttenberg and Kirstie Alley. That same year, they introduced a second video series, &quot;You&#x27;re Invited to Mary-Kate &amp; Ashley&#x27;s...&quot;, which continued to release new entries until 2000.

The following year, the Olsens appeared in an episode of &quot;All My Children&quot;. In 1997, they appeared once again as guest stars in an episode of &quot;Sister Sister&quot;. Also, in 1998, the twins returned to series television with another ABC sitcom, &quot;Two of a Kind&quot;, co-starring Christopher Sieber as their characters&#x27; widowed father. The series lasted only one season but aired in reruns on cable for several years afterward. 1998 also saw the release of &quot;Billboard Dad&quot;, the first of a new string of direct-to-video films starring the Olsens. The final such film, &quot;The Challenge&quot;, debuted in 2003.In 2000, the Olsens appeared in an episode of &quot;7th Heaven&quot; as bad girls Sue and Carol Murphy. The following year, the sisters starred in two new series: &quot;So Little Time&quot;, a live-action sitcom on Fox Family (later ABC Family); and &quot;Mary-Kate and Ashley in Action!&quot;, an animated series airing Saturday mornings on ABC. Both shows were canceled after one season, although Mary-Kate received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for her performance on &quot;So Little Time&quot;.

In early 2004, the Olsens had a cameo voice role in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as the readers of Marge&#x27;s book-on-tape, &quot;The Harpooned Heart&quot;. That same year, the twins starred in a second feature film, &quot;New York Minute&quot;. It would be their last film together, as well as Ashley&#x27;s last acting role. Mary-Kate has continued to appear in film and television.
Mary-Kate and Ashley had a fan club until 2000, &quot;Mary-Kate &amp; Ashley&#x27;s Fun Club&quot;, where fans would pay to receive Mary-Kate and Ashley collectibles and photos. Each subscription included an issue of &quot;Our Funzine&quot;, Mary-Kate and Ashley&#x27;s fan club magazine, exclusively available through the club, and a collectibles catalog, where one could purchase T-shirts, posters, baseball caps, key rings, school folders, postcards, and various other items. Subscribers would also receive &quot;surprise gifts&quot; (usually key rings, book excerpts, or back issues of the &quot;Funzine&quot;), lyric sheets to Mary-Kate and Ashley&#x27;s songs, a school folder, a membership card, a full-sized poster, two black and white photos (one of each girl), and a color photo with reprint autographs. The club was advertised at the beginning of Mary-Kate and Ashley movies until 1998.
Mary-Kate and Ashley were popular figures in the preteen market during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Their names and likenesses extended not only to movies and videos, but to clothes, shoes, purses, hats, books, CDs and cassette tapes, fragrances and makeup, magazines, video and board games, dolls, posters, calendars, and even telephones and CD players—with a market share made up mostly of the tween demographic. Mattel produced various sets of Mary-Kate and Ashley fashion dolls from 2000 to 2005, along with separate outfits and accessory packs.
The sisters became co-presidents of Dualstar on their 18th birthday in 2004. Upon taking control of the company, Mary-Kate and Ashley made moves to secure the future of the company by releasing products that appealed to the teen market, including home decoration and fragrances. The Dualstar brand has been sold in more than 3,000 stores in the United States and over 5,300 stores worldwide. The Olsens have appeared on the &quot;Forbes&quot; &quot;Celebrity 100&quot; list since 2002; in 2007, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked them (collectively) as the eleventh-richest women in entertainment, with an estimated net worth of US$100 million.

The sisters retired from acting in 2012, expressing interest in the fashion industry. When &quot;Fuller House&quot;, a spin-off of the original sitcom &quot;Full House,&quot; was announced, the sisters were the only members of the original cast who didn&#x27;t return to play their character, Michelle. They received harsh criticism due to their absence, but it was later revealed that John Stamos, who played Michelle&#x27;s uncle, Jesse Katsopolis, was to blame for their refusal to return, when he reached out to their agent instead of directly to the sisters. Mary-Kate considered joining again, and offered to persuade Ashley to join as well, but Stamos, who also produced &quot;Fuller House,&quot; &quot;didn&#x27;t seize the opportunity and everything fell apart.&quot; The sisters&#x27; new fashion career was also a factor in their failure to return, as they had moved away from acting and toward fashion designing. It was speculated that the twins&#x27; younger sister, actress Elizabeth Olsen, would take up the role as Michelle, but the team that produced &quot;Fuller House&quot; wasn&#x27;t open to the idea, and Michelle never made it onto the show.

===Fashion career===
As the sisters have matured, they expressed greater interest in their fashion choices, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; declaring Mary-Kate a fashion icon for pioneering her signature &quot;homeless&quot; look. The style sometimes referred to by fashion journalists as &quot;ashcan&quot; or &quot;bohemian-bourgeois&quot;, is similar to the boho-chic style popularized in Britain by Kate Moss and Sienna Miller. The look consists of oversized sunglasses, boots, loose sweaters, and flowing skirts, with an aesthetic of mixing high-end and low-end pieces. The twins were tapped as the faces of upscale fashion line Badgley Mischka in 2006.

The Olsens had a clothing line for girls ages 4–14 in Wal-Mart stores across North America, as well as a beauty line called &quot;Mary-Kate and Ashley: Real fashion for real girls&quot;. In 2004, they made news by signing a pledge to allow full maternity leave to all the workers that sew their line of clothing in Bangladesh. The National Labor Committee, which organized the pledge, praised the twins for their commitment to worker rights.

 The Olsens have also launched their own couture fashion label, The Row, named after Savile Row in London. In 2007, they launched &quot;Elizabeth &amp; James&quot;, a contemporary collection inspired by many of their unique vintage finds and pieces in their personal wardrobes. They have also released a women&#x27;s clothing line for J.C. Penney, called &quot;Olsenboye&quot;, and a T-shirt line called &quot;StyleMint&quot;. In 2008, the sisters published the book &quot;Influence&quot;, a compilation of interviews with many of the most prominent people in the field of fashion. In August 2013, the twins launched a new fashion line in Oslo, Norway. The Olsens were first named Womenswear Designer of the Year by the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) for The Row in 2012. They received the award again in 2015. The CFDA also named the Olsens Accessories Designer of the Year in 2014 for their work with The Row.

===Personal Lives===
Ashley is married in Louis Eisner and has one son, born in 2023. Mary-Kate was married to Olivier Sarkozy but is now divorced.

<doc id="87577" wikidata="Q150088" url="?curid=87577" title="Saab JAS 39 Gripen">
<text>The Saab JAS 39 Gripen ( ; English: &quot;Griffin&quot;) is a light single-engine supersonic multirole fighter aircraft manufactured by the Swedish aerospace and defence company Saab AB. The Gripen has a delta wing and canard configuration with relaxed stability design and fly-by-wire flight controls. Later aircraft are fully NATO interoperable. , more than 271 Gripens of all models, A–F, have been delivered.

In 1979, the Swedish government began development studies for &quot;an aircraft for fighter, attack, and reconnaissance&quot; (&quot;ett jakt-, attack- och spaningsflygplan&quot;, hence &quot;JAS&quot;) to replace the Saab 35 Draken and 37 Viggen in the Swedish Air Force. A new design from Saab was selected and developed as the JAS 39. The first flight took place in 1988, with delivery of the first serial production airplane in 1993. It entered service with the Swedish Air Force in 1996. Upgraded variants, featuring more advanced avionics and adaptations for longer mission times, began entering service in 2003.

To market the aircraft internationally, Saab formed partnerships and collaborative efforts with overseas aerospace companies. On the export market, early models of the Gripen achieved moderate success, with sales to nations in Central Europe, South Africa, and Southeast Asia. Bribery was suspected in some of these procurements, but Swedish authorities closed the investigation in 2009.

A major redesign of the Gripen series, previously referred to as &quot;Gripen NG&quot; (Next Generation) or &quot;Super JAS&quot;, now designated &quot;JAS 39E/F Gripen&quot; began deliveries to the Swedish Air Force and Brazilian Air Force in 2019. Changes from the JAS C to JAS E include a larger fuselage, a more powerful engine, increased weapons payload capability, and new cockpit, avionics architecture, electronic warfare system and other improvements.

==Development==
===Origins===
In the late 1970s, Sweden sought to replace its aging Saab 35 Draken and Saab 37 Viggen. The Swedish Air Force required an affordable Mach 2 aircraft with good short-field performance for a defensive dispersed basing plan in the event of invasion; the plan included 800 m long by 17 m wide rudimentary runways that were part of the Bas 90 system. One goal was for the aircraft to be smaller than the Viggen while equalling or improving on its payload-range characteristics. Early proposals included the Saab 38, also called B3LA, intended as an attack aircraft and trainer, and the A 20, a development of the Viggen that would have capabilities as a fighter, attack and sea reconnaissance aircraft. Several foreign designs were also studied, including the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, the Northrop F-20 Tigershark and the Dassault Mirage 2000. Ultimately, the Swedish government opted for a new fighter to be developed by Saab.

In 1979, the government began a study calling for a versatile platform capable of &quot;JAS&quot;, standing for &quot;Jakt&quot; (air-to-air), &quot;Attack&quot; (air-to-surface), and &quot;Spaning&quot; (reconnaissance), indicating a multirole, or swingrole, fighter aircraft that could fulfill multiple roles during the same mission. Several Saab designs were reviewed, the most promising being &quot;Project 2105&quot; (redesignated &quot;Project 2108&quot; and, later, &quot;Project 2110&quot;), recommended to the government by the Defence Materiel Administration (&quot;Försvarets Materielverk&quot;, or FMV). In 1980, &quot;Industrigruppen JAS&quot; (&quot;IG JAS&quot;, &quot;JAS Industry Group&quot;) was established as a joint venture by Saab-Scania, LM Ericsson, Svenska Radioaktiebolaget, Volvo Flygmotor and Försvarets Fabriksverk, the industrial arm of the Swedish armed forces.

The preferred aircraft was a single-engine, lightweight single-seater, embracing fly-by-wire technology, canards, and an aerodynamically unstable design. The powerplant selected was the Volvo-Flygmotor RM12, a licence-built derivative of the General Electric F404−400; engine development priorities were weight reduction and lowering component count. On 30 June 1982, with approval from the Riksdag, the FMV issued contracts worth SEK 25.7 billion to Saab, covering five prototypes and an initial batch of 30 production aircraft. By January 1983, a Viggen was converted to a flying test aircraft for the JAS 39&#x27;s intended avionics, such as the fly-by-wire controls. The JAS 39 received the name &quot;Gripen&quot; (griffin) via a public competition, which is the heraldry on Saab&#x27;s logo.

===Testing, production, and improvements===
Saab rolled out the first Gripen on 26 April 1987, marking the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Originally planned to fly in 1987, the first flight was delayed by 18 months due to issues with the flight control system. On 9 December 1988, the first prototype (serial number 39-1) took its 51-minute maiden flight with pilot Stig Holmström at the controls. During the test programme, concern surfaced about the aircraft&#x27;s avionics, specifically the fly-by-wire flight control system (FCS), and the relaxed stability design. On 2 February 1989, this issue led to the crash of the prototype during an attempted landing at Linköping; the test pilot Lars Rådeström walked away with a broken elbow. The cause of the crash was identified as pilot-induced oscillation, caused by problems with the FCS&#x27;s pitch-control routine.

In response to the crash, Saab and US firm Calspan introduced software modifications to the aircraft. A modified Lockheed NT-33A was used to test these improvements, which allowed flight testing to resume 15 months after the accident. On 8 August 1993, production aircraft 39102 was destroyed in an accident at an aerial display for the Stockholm Water Festival. Test pilot Lars Rådeström lost control of the aircraft during a roll at low altitude when the aircraft stalled, forcing him to eject. Saab later found the problem was high amplification of the pilot&#x27;s quick and significant stick command inputs. The ensuing investigation and flaw correction further delayed test flying by several months, resuming in December 1993.

The first order included an option for another 110, which was exercised in June 1992. Batch II consisted of 96 one-seat JAS 39As and 14 two-seat JAS 39Bs. The JAS 39B variant is 66 cm (26 in) longer than the JAS 39A to accommodate a second seat, which also necessitated the deletion of the cannon and a reduced internal fuel capacity. By April 1994, five prototypes and two series-production Gripens had been completed; but a beyond-visual-range missile (BVR) had not yet been selected. A third batch was ordered in June 1997, composed of 50 upgraded single-seat JAS 39Cs and 14 JAS 39D two-seaters, known as &#x27;Turbo Gripen&#x27;, with NATO compatibility for exports. Batch III aircraft, delivered between 2002 and 2008, possess more powerful and updated avionics, in-flight refuelling capability via retractable probes on the aircraft&#x27;s starboard side, and an on-board oxygen-generating system (OBOGS) for longer duration missions. In-flight refuelling was tested via a specially equipped prototype (39‐4) used in successful trials with a Royal Air Force VC10 in 1998.

===Teaming agreements===
During the 1995 Paris Air Show, Saab Military Aircraft and British Aerospace (BAe, now BAE Systems) announced the formation of the joint-venture company Saab-BAe Gripen AB with the goal of adapting, manufacturing, marketing and supporting Gripen worldwide. The deal involved the conversion of the A and B series aircraft to the &quot;export&quot; C and D series, which developed the Gripen for compatibility with NATO standards. This co-operation was extended in 2001 with the formation of Gripen International to promote export sales. In December 2004, Saab and BAE Systems announced that BAE was to sell a large portion of its stake in Saab, and that Saab would take full responsibility for marketing and export orders of the Gripen. In June 2011, Saab announced that an internal investigation revealed evidence of acts of corruption by BAE Systems, including money laundering in South Africa, one of the Gripen&#x27;s customers.

On 26 April 2007, Norway signed a NOK150 million joint-development agreement with Saab to co-operate in the development programme of the Gripen, including the integration of Norwegian industries in the development of future versions of the aircraft. In June of the same year, Saab also entered an agreement with Thales Norway A/S concerning the development of communications systems for the Gripen fighter. This order was the first awarded under the provisions of the Letter of Agreement signed by the Norwegian Ministry of Defence and Gripen International in April 2007. As a result of the United States diplomatic cables leak in 2010, it was revealed that US diplomats had become concerned with co-operation between Norway and Sweden on the topic of the Gripen, and had sought to exert pressure against a Norwegian purchase of the aircraft.

In December 2007, as part of Gripen International&#x27;s marketing efforts in Denmark, a deal was signed with Danish technology supplier Terma A/S that let them participate in an Industrial Co-operation programme over the next 10–15 years. The total value of the programme was estimated at over DKK10 billion, and was partly dependent on a procurement of the Gripen by Denmark. Subsequently, Denmark elected to procure the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.

===Controversies, scandals, and costs===
Developing an advanced multi-role fighter was a major undertaking for Sweden. The predecessor 37 Viggen had been criticized for occupying too much of Sweden&#x27;s military budget and was branded &quot;a cuckoo in the military nest&quot; by critics as early as 1971. At the 1972 party congress of the Socialdemokraterna, the dominant party in Swedish politics since the 1950s, a motion was passed to stop any future projects to develop advanced military aircraft. In 1982, the Gripen project passed in the Riksdag by a margin of 176 for and 167 against, with the entire Social Democratic party voting against the proposal due to demands for more studies. A new bill was introduced in 1983 and a final approval was given in April 1983 with the condition that the project was to have a predetermined fixed-price contract, a decision that would later be criticized as unrealistic due to later cost overruns.

According to Annika Brändström, in the aftermath of the 1989 and 1993 crashes, the Gripen risked a loss of credibility and the weakening of its public image. There was public speculation that failures to address technical problems exposed in the first crash had directly contributed to the second crash, which thus had been avoidable. Brändström observed that media elements had called for greater public accountability and explanation of the project; ill-informed media analysis had also distorted public knowledge of the Gripen. The sitting Conservative government quickly endorsed and supported the Gripen – Minister of Defense Anders Björck issued a public reassurance that the project was very positive for Sweden. In connection to the Gripen&#x27;s marketing efforts to multiple countries, including South Africa, Austria, the Czech Republic and Hungary, there were reports of widespread bribery and corruption by BAE Systems and Saab. In 2007, Swedish journalists reported that BAE had paid bribes equivalent to millions of dollars. Following criminal investigations in eight countries, only one individual in Austria, Alfons Mensdorf-Pouilly, was prosecuted for bribery. The scandal tarnished the international reputation of the Gripen, BAE Systems, Saab, and Sweden.

The Gripen&#x27;s cost has been subject to frequent attention and speculation. In 2008, Saab announced reduced earnings for that year, partly attributing this to increased marketing costs for the aircraft. In 2008, Saab disputed Norway&#x27;s cost calculations for the Gripen NG as overestimated and in excess of real world performance with existing operators. A 2007 report by the European Union Institute for Security Studies stated the total research and development costs of Gripen were €1.84 billion. According to a study by Jane&#x27;s Information Group in 2012, the Gripen&#x27;s operational cost was the lowest among several modern fighters; it was estimated at $4,700 per flight hour. The Swedish Ministry of Defense estimated the cost of the full system, comprising 60 Gripen E/F, at SEK 90 billion distributed over the period 2013–42. The Swedish Armed Forces estimated that maintaining 100 C/D-model aircraft until 2042 would cost SEK 60 billion (€6.6 billion in 2013), while buying aircraft from a foreign supplier would cost SEK 110 billion (€12.1 billion).

==== Operational costs ====
Price of purchase is what gets most attention during the procurement process, but over the lifetime of an aircraft system the operating costs will take the larger part of the total budget. It is not uncommon that pilots and aircraft remain on the ground because the allocated funds for training have run out. Without sufficient practice, pilots cannot use the abilities of the aircraft to their full potential, which means a state of the art aircraft with poorly trained pilots can be expected to perform worse than trained pilots in slightly less capable aircraft.

===JAS 39E/F and other developments ===
A two-seat aircraft, designated &quot;Gripen Demo&quot;, was ordered in 2007 as a testbed for various upgrades. It was powered by the General Electric F414G, a development of the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet&#x27;s engine. The Gripen NG&#x27;s maximum takeoff weight was increased from 14,000 to 16,000 kg (30,900–35,300 lb), internal fuel capacity was increased by 40 per cent by relocating the undercarriage, which also allowed for two additional hardpoints be added on the fuselage underside. Its combat radius was when carrying 6 AAMs (4 RR + 2 IR) and external tank. The PS-05/A radar is replaced by the new Raven ES-05 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, which is based on the Vixen AESA radar family from Selex ES (since 2016 Finmeccanica, then Leonardo S.p.A.). The Gripen Demo&#x27;s maiden flight was conducted on 27 May 2008. On 21 January 2009, the Gripen Demo flew at Mach 1.2+ at 28,000 ft (8,540 m) without reheat to test its supercruise capability. The Gripen Demo served as a basis for the Gripen E/F, also referred to as the Gripen NG (Next Generation) and MS (Mission System) 21.

Saab studied a variant of the Gripen capable of operating from aircraft carriers in the 1990s. In 2009, it launched the Sea Gripen project in response to India&#x27;s request for information on a carrier-based aircraft. Brazil may also require new carrier aircraft. Following a meeting with Ministry of Defence (MoD) officials in May 2011, Saab agreed to establish a development center in the UK to expand on the Sea Gripen concept. In 2013, Saab&#x27;s Lennart Sindahl stated that development of an optionally manned Gripen E capable of flying unmanned operations was being explored by the firm; further development of optionally manned and carrier versions would require customer commitment. On 6 November 2014, the Brazilian Navy expressed interest in a carrier-based Gripen.

In 2010, Sweden awarded Saab a four-year contract to improve the Gripen&#x27;s radar and other equipment, integrate new weapons, and lower its operating costs. In June 2010, Saab stated that Sweden planned to order the Gripen NG, designated JAS 39E/F, and was to enter service in 2017 or earlier dependent on export orders. On 25 August 2012, following Switzerland&#x27;s intention to buy 22 of the E/F variants, Sweden announced it planned to buy 40–60 Gripen E/Fs. On 17 January 2013, the Swedish government decided to purchase 60 Gripen Es. Subsequent to a national referendum in 2014 Switzerland decided not to procure replacement fighters and postponed their procurement process.

In July 2013, assembly began on the first pre-production Gripen E. Originally 60 JAS 39Cs were to be retrofitted as JAS 39Es by 2023, but this was revised to Gripen Es having new-built airframes and some reused parts from JAS 39Cs. In March 2014, Saab revealed the detailed design and indicated plans to receive military type certification in 2018. The first Gripen E was rolled out on 18 May 2016. Saab delayed the first flight from 2016 to 2017 to focus on civilian-grade software certification; high speed taxi tests began in December 2016. In September 2015, Saab Aeronautics head Lennart Sindahl stated that an Electronic Warfare version of the Gripen F two-seater could be developed. On 15 June 2017, Saab completed the Gripen E&#x27;s first flight. By May 2018, the Gripen E had attained supersonic flight and was to commence load tests. On 24 November 2021, Saab announced that the first six Gripen Es were ready to be delivered to the Swedish and Brazilian air forces. The flight test programme with pre-production Gripen Es continued even after initial deliveries to both the Swedish and Brazilian Air Forces.

==Design==

===Overview===
The Gripen is a multirole fighter aircraft, intended as a light-weight and agile aerial platform with advanced, highly adaptable avionics. It has canard control surfaces that contribute a positive lift force at all speeds, while the generous lift from the delta wing compensates for the rear stabiliser producing negative lift at high speeds, increasing induced drag. Being intentionally unstable and employing digital fly-by-wire flight controls to maintain stability removes many flight restrictions, improves manoeuvrability, and reduces drag. The Gripen also has good short takeoff performance, being able to maintain a high sink rate and strengthened to withstand the stresses of short landings. The aircraft is fitted with retractable tricycle landing gear, with a double-wheeled nose gear and single main wheels. A pair of air brakes are located on the sides of the rear fuselage; the canards also angle downward to act as air brakes and decrease landing distance. It is capable of flying at a 70–80 degrees angle of attack.

To enable the Gripen to have a long service life, roughly 50 years, Saab designed it to have low maintenance requirements. Major systems such as the RM12 engine and PS-05/A radar are modular to reduce operating cost and increase reliability. The Gripen was designed to be flexible, so that newly developed sensors, computers, and armaments could be integrated as technology advances. The aircraft was estimated to be roughly 67% sourced from Swedish or European suppliers and 33% from the US.

One key aspect of the Gripen programme that Saab have been keen to emphasize has been technology-transfer agreements and industrial partnerships with export customers. The Gripen is typically customized to customer requirements, enabling the routine inclusion of local suppliers in the manufacturing and support processes. A number of South African firms provide components and systems – including the communications suite and electronic warfare systems – for the Gripens operated by the South African Air Force. Operators also have access to the Gripen&#x27;s source code and technical documentation, allowing for upgrades and new equipment to be independently integrated. Some export customers intend to domestically assemble the Gripen; it has been proposed that Brazilian aerospace manufacturer Embraer may produce Gripens for other export customers as well.

===Avionics and sensors===
All of the Gripen&#x27;s avionics are fully integrated using five MIL-STD-1553B digital data buses, in what is described as &quot;sensor fusion&quot;. The total integration of the avionics makes the Gripen a &quot;programmable&quot; aircraft, allowing software updates to be introduced over time to increase performance and allow for additional operational roles and equipment. The Ada programming language was adopted for the Gripen, and is used for the primary flight controls on the final prototypes from 1996 onwards and all subsequent production aircraft. The Gripen&#x27;s software is continuously being improved to add new capabilities, as compared to the preceding Viggen, which was updated only in an 18-month schedule.

Much of the data generated from the onboard sensors and by cockpit activity is digitally recorded throughout the length of an entire mission. This information can be replayed in the cockpit or easily extracted for detailed post-mission analysis using a data transfer unit that can also be used to insert mission data to the aircraft. The Gripen, like the Viggen, was designed to operate as one component of a networked national defence system, which allows for automatic exchange of information in real-time between Gripen aircraft and ground facilities. According to Saab, the Gripen features &quot;the world&#x27;s most highly developed data link&quot;. The Gripen&#x27;s Ternav tactical navigation system combines information from multiple onboard systems such as the air data computer, radar altimeter, and GPS to continuously calculate the Gripen&#x27;s location.

The Gripen entered service using the PS-05/A pulse-Doppler X band multi-mode radar, developed by Ericsson and GEC-Marconi, which is based on the latter&#x27;s advanced Blue Vixen radar for the Sea Harrier that also served as the basis for the Eurofighter&#x27;s CAPTOR radar. The all-weather radar is capable of locating and identifying targets 120 km (74 mi) away, and automatically tracking multiple targets in the upper and lower spheres, on the ground and sea or in the air. It can guide several beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to multiple targets simultaneously. Saab stated the PS-05/A is able to handle all types of air defence, air-to-surface, and reconnaissance missions, and is developing a Mark 4 upgrade to it. The Mark 4 version has a 150% increase in high-altitude air-to-air detection ranges, detection and tracking of smaller targets at current ranges, 140% improvement in air-to-air mode at low altitude, and full integration of modern weapons such as the AIM-120C-7 AMRAAM, AIM-9X Sidewinder, and MBDA Meteor missiles.
The future Gripen E/F will use a new AESA radar, Raven ES-05, based on the Vixen AESA radar family from Selex ES. Among other improvements, the new radar is to be capable of scanning over a greatly increased field of view and improved range. In addition, the new Gripen integrates the Skyward-G Infra-red search and track (IRST) sensor, which is capable of passively detecting thermal emissions from air and ground targets in the aircraft&#x27;s vicinity. The sensors of the Gripen E are claimed to be able to detect low radar cross-section (RCS) targets at beyond visual range. Targets are tracked by a &quot;best sensor dominates&quot; system, either by onboard sensors or through the Transmitter Auxiliary Unit (TAU) data link function of the radar.

===Cockpit===

The primary flight controls are compatible with the Hands On Throttle-And-Stick (HOTAS) control principle – the centrally mounted stick, in addition to flying the aircraft, also controls the cockpit displays and weapon systems. A triplex, digital fly-by-wire system is employed on the Gripen&#x27;s flight controls, with a mechanical backup for the throttle. Additional functions, such as communications, navigational and decision support data, can be accessed via the Up Front Control Panel, directly above the central cockpit display. The Gripen includes the EP-17 cockpit display system, developed by Saab to provide pilots with a high level of situational awareness and reduces pilot workload through intelligent information management. The Gripen features a sensor fusion capability, information from onboard sensors and databases is combined, automatically analysed, and useful data is presented to the pilot via a wide field-of-view Head-Up Display, three large multi-function colour displays, and optionally a Helmet Mounted Display System (HMDS).

Of the three multi-function displays (MFD), the central display is for navigational and mission data, the display to the left of the center shows aircraft status and electronic warfare information, and the display to the right of the center has sensory and fire control information. In two-seat variants, the rear seat&#x27;s displays can be operated independently of the pilot&#x27;s own display arrangement in the forward seat. Saab has promoted this capability as being useful during electronic warfare and reconnaissance missions, and while carrying out command and control activities. In May 2010, Sweden began equipping their Gripens with additional onboard computer systems and new displays. The MFDs are interchangeable and designed for redundancy in the event of failure, flight information can be presented on any of the displays.

Saab and BAE developed the Cobra HMDS for use in the Gripen, based on the Striker HMDS used on the Eurofighter. By 2008, the Cobra HMDS was fully integrated on operational aircraft, and is available as an option for export customers; it has been retrofitted into older Swedish and South African Gripens. The HMDS provides control and information on target cueing, sensor data, and flight parameters, and is optionally equipped for night time operations and with chemical/biological filtration. All connections between the HMDS and the cockpit were designed for rapid detachment, for safe use of the ejection system.

===Engine===

All in-service Gripens as of January 2014 are powered by a Volvo RM12 turbofan engine (now GKN Aerospace Engine Systems), a licence-manufactured derivative of General Electric F404, fed by a Y-duct with splitter plates; changes include increased performance and improved reliability to meet single engine use safety criteria, as well as a greater resistance to bird strike incidents. Several subsystems and components were also redesigned to reduce maintenance demands. By November 2010, the Gripen had accumulated over 143,000 flight hours without a single engine-related failure or incident; Rune Hyrefeldt, head of Military Program management at Volvo Aero, stated: &quot;I think this must be a hard record to beat for a single-engine application&quot;.

Like the Gripen, test models of the Dassault Rafale used F404 engines until replaced by the Snecma M88-2 engine on production aircraft. A JAS 39C variant powered by a new thrust SNECMA M88-3 engine was proposed. The M88-3 variant would have a new low pressure compressor (LPC) with a new variable stator vane stage and an increased mass flow of .

The JAS 39E and F variants under development are to adopt the F414G powerplant, a variant of the General Electric F414. The F414G can produce 20% greater thrust than the current RM12 engine, enabling the Gripen to supercruise at a speed of Mach 1.1 while carrying an air-to-air combat payload. In 2010, Volvo Aero stated it was capable of further developing its RM12 engine to better match the performance of the F414G, and claimed that developing the RM12 would be a less expensive option. Prior to Saab&#x27;s selection of the F414G, the Eurojet EJ200 had also been under consideration for the Gripen; proposed implementations included the use of thrust vectoring.

===Equipment and armaments===
The Gripen is compatible with a number of different armaments, beyond the aircraft&#x27;s single 27 mm Mauser BK-27 cannon (omitted on the two-seat variants), including air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder, air-to-ground missiles such as the AGM-65 Maverick, and anti-ship missiles such as the RBS-15. In 2010, the Swedish Air Force&#x27;s Gripen fleet completed the MS19 upgrade process, enabling compatibility with a range of weapons, including the long-range MBDA Meteor missile, the short-range IRIS-T missile and the GBU-49 laser-guided bomb. Speaking on the Gripen&#x27;s selection of armaments, Saab&#x27;s campaign director for India, Edvard de la Motte stated that: &quot;If you buy Gripen, select where you want your weapons from: Israel, Sweden, Europe, US… South America. It&#x27;s up to the customer&quot;.

In flight, the Gripen is typically capable of carrying up to of assorted armaments and equipment. Equipment includes external sensor pods for reconnaissance and target designation, such as Rafael&#x27;s LITENING targeting pod, Saab&#x27;s Modular Reconnaissance Pod System, or Thales&#x27; Digital Joint Reconnaissance Pod. The Gripen has an advanced and integrated electronic warfare suite, capable of operating in an undetectable passive mode or to actively jam hostile radar; a missile approach warning system passively detects and tracks incoming missiles. In November 2013, it was announced that Saab will be the first to offer the BriteCloud expendable Active jammer developed by Selex ES. In June 2014, the Enhanced Survivability Technology Modular Self Protection Pod, a defensive missile countermeasure pod, performed its first flight on the Gripen.

Saab describes the Gripen as a &quot;swing-role aircraft&quot;, stating that it is capable of &quot;instantly switching between roles at the push of a button&quot;. The human/machine interface changes when switching between roles, being optimized by the computer in response to new situations and threats. The Gripen is also equipped to use a number of different communications standards and systems, including SATURN secure radio, Link-16, ROVER, and satellite uplinks. Equipment for performing long range missions, such as an air-to-air refuelling probe and Onboard Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS), was integrated on the Gripen C/D.

===Usability and maintenance===
During the Cold War, the Swedish Armed Forces were to be ready to defend against a possible invasion. This scenario required defensive force dispersal of combat aircraft in the Bas 90 system to maintain an air defence capacity. Thus, a key design goal during the Gripen&#x27;s development was the ability to operate from snow-covered landing strips of only ; furthermore, a short-turnaround time of just ten minutes (attack mission preparations is double that time), during which a team composed of a technician and five conscripts would be able to re-arm, refuel, and perform routine inspections and servicing inside that time window before returning to flight for air-to-air missions. For air-to-ground missions this turnaround time using the same resource is slightly longer at twenty minutes.

During the design process, great priority was placed on facilitating and minimizing aircraft maintenance; in addition to a maintenance-friendly layout, many subsystems and components require little or no maintenance at all. Aircraft are fitted with a Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) that monitors the performance of various systems, and provides information to technicians to assist in servicing it. Saab operates a continuous improvement programme; information from the HUMS and other systems can be submitted for analysis. According to Saab, the Gripen provides &quot;50% lower operating costs than its best competitor&quot;.

A 2012 &quot;Jane&#x27;s Aerospace and Defense Consulting&quot; study compared the operational costs of a number of modern combat aircraft, concluding that Gripen had the lowest &quot;cost per flight hour&quot; (CPFH) when fuel used, pre-flight preparation and repair, and scheduled airfield-level maintenance together with associated personnel costs were combined. The Gripen had an estimated CPFH of US$4,700 whereas the next lowest, the F-16 Block 40/50, had a 49% higher CPFH at $7,000.

In 2024, a study was begun to see if a Gripen could launch a small satellite into low earth orbit, building on previous research in this area. It is more common for commercial airliners to be used for this purpose but the Eurofighter Typhoon has also been studied for this task (see also ASM-135 ASAT).

==Operational history==

===Sweden===
The Swedish Air Force placed a total order for 204 Gripens in three batches. The first delivery occurred on 8 June 1993, when 39102 was handed over to the Flygvapnet during a ceremony at Linköping; the last of the first batch was handed over on 13 December 1996. The Air Force received its first Batch II example on 19 December 1996. Instead of the fixed-price agreement of Batch I, Batch II aircraft were paid as a &quot;target price&quot; concept: any cost underruns or overruns would be split between FMV and Saab.

The JAS 39 entered service with the Skaraborg Wing (F 7) on 1 November 1997. The final Batch III aircraft was delivered to FMV on 26 November 2008. This was accomplished at 10% less than the agreed-upon price for the batch, putting the JAS 39C flyaway cost at under US$30 million. This batch of Gripens was equipped for in-flight refuelling from specially equipped TP84s. In 2007, a programme was started to upgrade 31 of the air force&#x27;s JAS 39A/B fighters to JAS 39C/Ds. The SwAF had a combined 134 JAS 39s in service in January 2013. In March 2015, the Swedish Air Force received its final JAS 39C.

On 29 March 2011, the Swedish parliament approved the Swedish Air Force for a 3-month deployment to support the UN-mandated no-fly zone over Libya. Deployment of eight Gripens, ten pilots, and other personnel began on 2 April. On 8 June 2011, the Swedish government announced an agreement to extend the deployment for five of the Gripens. By October 2011, Gripens had flown more than 650 combat missions, almost 2,000 flight hours, and delivered approximately 2,000 reconnaissance reports to NATO. Journalist Tim Hepher suggested that the Libyan operations might stimulate sales of the Gripen and other aircraft.
In November 2012, Lieutenant Colonel Lars Helmrich of the Swedish Air Force testified to the Riksdag regarding the Gripen E. He stated that the then-current version of the Gripen would be outdated in air-to-air combat by 2020. With 60 Gripens having been judged to be the minimum required to defend Swedish Airspace, the Swedish Air Force wanted to have 60–80 Gripens upgraded to the E/F standard by 2020.

On 25 August 2012, the Swedish government announced that 40–60 JAS 39E/F Gripens were expected to be procured and in service by 2023. On 11 December 2012, the Riksdag approved the purchase of 40 to 60 JAS 39E/Fs with an option to cancel if at least 20 aircraft are not ordered by other customers. on 17 January 2013, the government approved the deal for 60 JAS 39Es to be delivered between 2018 and 2027. On 3 March 2014, the Swedish defence minister stated that another 10 JAS 39Es might be ordered; this was later confirmed by the government.

There are also plans to keep some of the Gripen C/D active after 2025. This was recommended by the Swedish defence advisory committee in 2019.

In 2006, Swedish Gripen aircraft participated in Red Flag – Alaska, a multinational air combat exercise hosted by the United States Air Force. Gripen flew simulated combat sorties against F-16 Block 50, Eurofighter Typhoon and F-15C and scored ten kills, including a Eurofighter Typhoon and five F-16 Block 50s on day one of the exercises with no losses. Three Swedish Gripen C also participated in a war game against five Royal Norwegian Air Force&#x27;s F-16 Block 50 fighters in Sweden. Swedish Gripen C and Norwegian F-16 flew three combat sorties; Gripen C scored five kills in each sortie against Norwegian F-16, on the last sortie F-16 scored a kill against Gripen.

In December 2022 Sweden ordered an upgrade package from Saab for a number of their Gripen C/D fighters. The upgrade includes new engines, a new radar and a new electronic warfare system. The order value is approximately SEK 3.5 billion and the contract period is 2023–29. In September 2023 Swedish FMV and Saab signed additional orders for the Gripen E and C/D versions. The new orders enables the C/D version to continue serving after 2030 parallel with the introduction of the E.
===Czech Republic===
When the Czech Republic became a NATO member in 1999, it needed to replace its existing Soviet-built MiG-21 fleet with aircraft compatible with NATO standards. In 2000, the Czech Republic began evaluating a number of aircraft, including the F-16, F/A-18, Mirage 2000, Eurofighter Typhoon and the Gripen. One major procurement condition was the industrial offset agreement, set at 150% of the expected purchase value. In December 2001, having reportedly been swayed by Gripen International&#x27;s generous financing and offset programme, the Czech government announced that the Gripen had been selected. In 2002, the deal was delayed until after parliamentary elections had taken place; alternative means of air defence were also studied, including leasing the aircraft.
On 14 June 2004, it was announced that the Czech Republic was to lease 14 Gripens, modified to comply with NATO standards. The agreement also included the training of Czech pilots and technicians in Sweden. The first six were delivered on 18 April 2005. The lease was for an agreed period of 10 years at a cost of €780 million; the 14 ex-Swedish Air Force aircraft included 12 single-seaters and two JAS 39D two-seat trainers. In September 2013, the Defence and Security Export Agency announced that a follow-up agreement with the Czech Republic had been completed to extend the lease by 14 years, until 2029; leased aircraft shall also undergo extensive modernization, including the adoption of new datalinks. The lease also has an option of eventually acquiring the fighters outright. In 2014, the lease was extended to 2027 and the Saab service contract was extended to 2026.

In November 2014, Czech Air Force commander General Libor Štefánik proposed leasing a further six Gripens due to Russia&#x27;s deteriorating relationship with the West; a Ministry of Defence spokesperson stated that the notion was the commander&#x27;s personal vision and fleet expansion was not on the agenda for years to come. In 2015, the service decided to upgrade its fleet to the MS20 configuration. The MS20 upgrade was completed in 2018.

===Hungary===

Following Hungary&#x27;s membership of NATO in 1999, there were several proposals to achieve a NATO-compatible fighter force. Considerable attention went into studying second-hand aircraft options as well as modifying the nation&#x27;s existing MiG-29 fleet. In 2001, Hungary received several offers of new and used aircraft from various nations, including Sweden, Belgium, Israel, Turkey, and the US. Although the Hungarian government initially intended to procure the F-16, in November 2001 it was in the process of negotiating a 10-year lease contract for 12 Gripen aircraft, with an option to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease period.

As part of the procurement arrangements, Saab had offered an offset deal valued at 110 per cent of the cost of the 14 fighters. Initially, Hungary had planned to lease several Batch II aircraft; however, the inability to conduct aerial refuelling and weapons compatibility limitations had generated Hungarian misgivings. The contract was renegotiated and was signed on 2 February 2003 for a total of 14 Gripens, which had originally been A/B standard and had undergone an extensive upgrade process to the NATO-compatible C/D &#x27;Export Gripen&#x27; standard. The last aircraft deliveries took place in December 2007.

While the Hungarian Air Force operates a total of 14 Gripen aircraft under lease, in 2011, the country reportedly intended to purchase these aircraft outright. However, in January 2012, the Hungarian and Swedish governments agreed to extend the lease period for a further 10 years; according to Hungarian Defence Minister Csaba Hende, the agreement represented considerable cost savings.

Two Gripens were lost in crashes in May and June 2015, leaving 12 Gripens in operation. From 2017, Hungary returned to operating 14 fighters.

In August 2021, a contract was signed with Saab to modernise the Gripen fleet of the Hungarian Air Force. The radar will be upgraded to &quot;PS-05/Mk4&quot; and the software will be upgraded to &quot;MS 20 Block 2&quot; level. New weapons would be added to the arsenal of the Hungarian Gripens. The IRIS-T missiles were ordered in December 2021.

In February 2024, it was announced that a contract was signed to buy four additional Gripen C aircraft.

===South Africa===
In 1999, South Africa signed a contract with BAe/Saab for the procurement of 26 Gripens (C/D standard) with minor modifications to meet its requirements. Deliveries to the South African Air Force commenced in April 2008. By April 2011, 18 aircraft (nine two-seater aircraft and nine single-seaters) had been delivered. While the establishment of a Gripen Fighter Weapon School at Overberg Air Force Base in South Africa had been under consideration, in July 2013 Saab ruled out the option due to a lack of local support for the initiative; Thailand is an alternative location being considered, as well as the Čáslav Czech air base.

Between April 2013 and December 2013, South African contractors held prime responsibility for maintenance work on the Gripen fleet as support contracts with Saab had expired; this arrangement led to fears that extended operations may not be possible due to a lack of proper maintenance. In December 2013, Armscor awarded Saab a long-term support contract for the company to perform engineering, maintenance, and support services on all 26 Gripens through 2016. On 13 March 2013, South African Defense Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula stated that &quot;almost half of the SAAF Gripens&quot; have been stored because of an insufficient budget to keep them flying. In September 2013, the SAAF decided not to place a number of its Gripens in long-term storage; instead all 26 aircraft would be rotated between flying cycles and short-term storage. Speaking in September 2013, Brigadier-General John Bayne testified that the Gripen met the SAAF&#x27;s minimum requirements, as the country faced no military threats.

===Thailand===
In 2007, Thailand&#x27;s Parliament authorised the Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) to spend up to 34 billion baht (US$1.1 billion) as part of an effort to replace Thailand&#x27;s existing Northrop F-5 fleet. In February 2008, the RTAF ordered six Gripens (two single-seat C-models and four two-seat D-models) from Saab; deliveries began in 2011. Thailand ordered six more Gripen Cs in November 2010; deliveries began in 2013. Thailand may eventually order as many as 40 Gripens. In 2010, Surat Thani Airbase was selected as the RTAF&#x27;s main Gripen operating base.

The first of the six aircraft were delivered on 22 February 2011. Saab delivered three Gripens in April 2013, and three more in September 2013. In September 2013, RTAF Marshal Prajin Jantong stated that Thailand was interested in purchasing six more aircraft, although no second order had been placed. Thai Supreme Commander General Thanasak Patimapragorn has stated that the RTAF intends the Gripen&#x27;s information systems to be integrated with army and navy systems. The armed forces were to officially inaugurate the Gripen Integrated Air Defence System during 2014.

In August 2024, the Thailand Air Force announced having selected the Gripen E/F over the F-16 Block 70/72 to replace its 12 existing F-16. The government still needs to approve the selection.

===United Kingdom===
The Empire Test Pilots&#x27; School (ETPS) in the United Kingdom has used the Gripen for advanced fast jet training of test pilots under a &quot;wet lease&quot; arrangement since 1999. It operates a Gripen D aircraft.

===Brazil===
In October 2008, Brazil selected three finalists for its F-X2 fighter programme: the Dassault Rafale B/C, the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, and the Gripen NG. The Brazilian Air Force (FAB) initially planned to procure at least 36 and possibly up to 120 later, to replace its Northrop F‐5EM and Dassault Mirage 2000C aircraft. In February 2009, Saab submitted a tender for 36 Gripen NGs. In early 2010, the Brazilian Air Force&#x27;s final evaluation report reportedly placed the Gripen ahead, a decisive factor being lower unit cost and operational costs. After delays due to financial constraints, on 18 December 2013, President Dilma Rousseff announced the Gripen NG&#x27;s selection. Key factors were domestic manufacturing opportunities, full Transfer of Technology (ToT), participation in its development, and potential exports to Africa, Asia and Latin America; Argentina and Ecuador are interested in procuring Gripens via Brazil, and Mexico is considered an export target. Another factor was the distrust of the US due to the NSA surveillance scandal. The Gripen is not immune to foreign pressure: the UK may use their 30% component percentage in the Gripen to veto an Argentinian sale over the Falkland Islands dispute; thus Argentina is considering other fighters instead.
On 24 October 2014, Brazil and Sweden signed a 39.3 billion SEK (US$5.44 bn, R$13 bn) contract for 28 Gripen E (single-seat version) and eight Gripen F (dual-seat version) fighters for delivery from 2019 to 2024 and maintained until 2050; the Swedish government will provide a subsidized 25-year, 2.19% interest rate loan for the buy. At least 15 aircraft are to be assembled in Brazil, Brazilian companies shall be involved in its production; Gripen Fs are to be delivered later. An almost US$1 billion price increase since selection is due to developments requested by Brazil, such as the &quot;Wide Area Display&quot; (WAD), a panoramic 19 by 8 inches touchscreen display. The compensation package is set at US$9 billion, or 1.7 times the order value. The Brazilian Navy is interested in the Gripen Maritime to replace its Douglas A-4KU Skyhawk carrier-based fighters. In 2015, Brazil and Sweden finalised the deal to develop the Gripen F, designated F-39 by Brazil.

The first Brazilian F-39E Gripen flight took place on 26 August 2019, from Saab&#x27;s facility in Linköping, Sweden. It was handed over to the Brazilian Air Force on 10 September 2019 for flight testing. The fighter arrived in Brazil on 20 September 2020, and then was transported by land to Navegantes International Airport. On 24 September, it took off to the Embraer unit in Gavião Peixoto, in São Paulo state, for the test program for flight control systems, weapon integration, communication systems and others. The fighters will be part of the 1st Air Defense Group (1º GDA), based at the Anápolis Air Force Base. The deliveries of operational fighters will begin in 2021. According to Saab executive Eddy De La Motte, the first F-39F will be delivered in 2023. In 2021, Brazil started F-39E supersonic flight tests at high altitude above 16,000 feet. According to Saab executive Mikael Franzén, Brazil will start receiving production aircraft with IRST from November 2021. The service has a requirement for 108 Gripens, to be delivered in three batches.
On 1 February 2022, the Brazilian Air Force commander Carlos de Almeida Baptista Júnior told newspaper &quot;Folha de S. Paulo&quot; that Brazil is in initial planning phase for negotiations with Saab for a new batch of 30 Gripen E/Fs, &quot;our capacity planning takes us today, by our employment assumptions, to 66 Gripens in operation&quot;; this planning phase is expected to be finished by mid-2022. The negotiation and Brazilian intention was confirmed by the Saab&#x27;s chief executive Håkan Buskhe in February 2019. The confirmation comes after media rumors that the service saw the Lockheed Martin F-35 as an ideal candidate to continue the modernization process in the coming years, after Gripen&#x27;s recent failed bids in Finland and Switzerland, rumors that Baptista denied. On 1 April 2022, Brazil received the first two series produced F-39E. On 22 April 2022, the Brazilian Air Force announced the purchase of four more Gripens E/F for the first batch, totaling 40 aircraft, and the ongoing studies for a second batch. On 23 May 2022, Commander Baptista Júnior announced at a press conference that the second batch will consist of 26 Gripens, priced around US$85 million per unit (US$2.2 billion); these new units plus the four ordered in April 2022 will be assembled at the Embraer factory in Gavião Peixoto. On 1 August 2022, the Saab&#x27;s chief executive Micael Johansson, confirmed that Brazil has initiated formal negotiations for 26 more Gripen fighters.

Saab and Embraer inaugurated the production line for Gripen E in Brazil on 9 May 2023. On 23 November 2023, the newspaper &quot;Folha de S. Paulo&quot; reported ongoing negotiations between the Brazilian and Swedish governments, for a deal involving 14 more Gripens for the Brazilian Air Force, in exchange of four Embraer C-390 Millennium transport aircraft for the Swedish Air Force, according to sources, the deal will be finalized in 2024.

On 9 November 2024, the Brazilian Minister of Defence José Múcio signed a letter of intent, to increase the contract with Saab by 25%, increasing to 45 Gripens for the FAB. In exchange, the Swedish Air Force announced the selection and the beginning of negotiations to procure the Embraer C-390 Millenium airlifter.

===Potential operators===
====Botswana====
In 2014, Saab opened an office in Botswana. The country is interested in buying eight surplus Gripen C/Ds, with possible extension to 16, to replace the Botswana Defence Force Air Wing&#x27;s (BDF) 14 ex-Royal Canadian Air Force CF-5 fighters used since 1996. BDF officials reportedly believe the Gripen acquisition is a done deal.

====Colombia====
Saab had offered 15 Gripen C/D or E/F to Colombia, with possible deliveries during 2018–21, depending on variant selected.

====Philippines====
In September 2016, Saab announced its intention to open an office in Manila to support its campaign to sell the Gripen to fill the Philippine Air Force&#x27;s requirement for 12 multirole fighters; Saab also intends to offer ground infrastructure, integrated C2 systems and datalinks, similar to the capabilities of the Royal Thai Air Force. In 2018, Saab renewed its sales push. The Department of National Defense is reportedly more likely to buy six Gripen C/D MS20 over the US offer of F-16V Block 70/72. According to Swedish newspaper &quot;Aftonbladet&quot;, Swedish ISP Exportkontrollrådet (Export Control Council) ruled in November 2022 to approve export to the Philippines. They also raise the option of providing leased JAS 39 Gripens as a counter-offer to the F-16V offer of the United States. In June 2023, the Philippines and Sweden signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, paving the way for a potential agreement that would see Sweden supplying 12 Gripen C/D MS20 multirole fighter aircraft to the Philippine Air Force (PAF). The MOU on defence materiel cooperation was signed by Acting Defence Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. and Swedish Defence Minister Pål Jonson.

==== Ukraine ====
Since 2014, Ukraine considered locally producing the JAS 39 Gripen under license, but such plans were abandoned and the country focused on overhauling and upgrading its fleet of Soviet-era combat aircraft instead.

In 2020, the &quot;Kyiv Post&quot; reported that Ukraine had plans on fully replacing its fleet of MiG-29s, Su-27s, Su-25s, and Su-24Ms with 72−108 Western 4.5 generation multirole combat aircraft such as the Gripen E/F or F-16 Block 70/72 by 2035.

In July 2022, the Minister of Defence Oleksii Reznikov announced the JAS 39 Gripen as a candidate aircraft for the Ukrainian Air Force. In August 2023 after visiting Sweden&#x27;s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson Ukraine&#x27;s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that &quot;Ukrainian pilots had already begun training on the planes.&quot; In early December 2023, it was reported that there were fruitful bilateral discussions about the possible transfer of Gripen aircraft to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

On 9 September 2024, Sweden announced its 17th aid package for Ukraine of 4.6 billion Swedish crowns or US$ 443 million. Funds were included to &quot;facilitate a transfer of Gripen fighter jets in the future&quot;.

On 6 February 2025, Commander-in-Chief of the AFU General Oleksandr Syrskyi confirmed that negotiations on the transfer of Gripens C/D to Ukraine are still ongoing.

====Others====
Other countries that have expressed interest in Gripen include:

* Ecuador (C/D, or E/F from Brazil)
* Estonia
* Kenya (C/D)
* Latvia
* Lithuania
* Malaysia (C/D)
* Mexico (C/D, or E/F from Brazil)
* Namibia (C/D)
* Peru (C/D, or E/F from Brazil)
* Portugal (C/D)
* Serbia
* Slovenia
* Vietnam
Saab&#x27;s head of exports Eddy de La Motte has stated in 2013 that Gripen&#x27;s chances have improved as nations waver in their commitments to the F-35. In September 2013, Saab&#x27;s CEO Håkan Buskhe said he envisioned Gripen sales to reach 400 or 450 aircraft.

===Failed bids===
====Argentina====
Used F-16s from Denmark instead.

====Austria====
Starting in the 1990s, the Gripen was one candidate to replace the Austrian Air Force&#x27;s aging Saab 35 Drakens; the Eurofighter Typhoon was selected in 2003. During the mid-2010s, Austria started considering replacing its Typhoons with Gripens due to obsolescence and cost, as they are all Tranche 1 and need upgrades to be retained.

In 2023, Austria decided to upgrade its Typhoons and is considering enlarging its fleet.

====Bulgaria====
In response to the Bulgarian Air Force&#x27;s interest in the Gripen, the Gerdzhikov caretaker cabinet announced in April 2017 the fighter&#x27;s section by a state commission and plans for an initial batch of eight Gripens at up to 1.5 billion BGN (ca. 745 million euro), to be delivered around 2018–2020, along with a second batch of eight later. Competing bids were used USAF F-16A/Bs to be modernised to MLU standard by the Portuguese OGMA (similar to Bulgaria&#x27;s neighbour Romania) and used Italian Tranche 1 Eurofighter Typhoons, with the US/Portuguese offer finishing second and the Italian offer third. According to the deputy prime minister and minister of defence Stefan Yanev, the Gripen&#x27;s selection was primarily due to Saab&#x27;s offer of favourable financial terms, such as a lease option and offset agreements, accounting for about one billion BGN for the aircraft alone ($834 million), while the US/Portuguese bid accounted a price of about one and a half billion BGN for the aircraft alone. The second-place offer was retained as a back-up option if negotiations with Saab failed; program finances were budgeted through to 2017. It would replace both the MiG-29 fighters of Graf Ignatievo Air Base and the Su-25 attack aircraft of Bezmer Air Base, as well as the already retired Su-22 reconnaissance aircraft.

In October 2018, potential suppliers responded to a renewed tender, consisting of new F-16V Vipers from Lockheed Martin, new Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, used Eurofighter Typhoons from Italy and used Gripen C/Ds from Sweden. France, Germany, Israel and Portugal did not respond to requests for used Eurofighter Typhoons and F-16 variants. In December 2018, Saab submitted an improved offer to supply 10 new Gripen C/Ds instead of the previously proposed 8. However, in December 2018, the Bulgarian Ministry of Defence selected the F-16V offer as the preferred option, and recommended talks with the US. On 3 June 2019, the US State Department approved the possible sale of 8 F-16Vs to Bulgaria at an estimate cost of $1.67 billion. On 10 July 2019, Bulgaria approved the acquisition of eight F-16V Block 70/72s for US$1.25bn. The deal was vetoed by the Bulgarian President, Rumen Radev on 23 July 2019, citing the need for a broader consensus, returning it to parliament. On 26 July 2019, parliament again approved the deal, overruling the veto, and was approved by Radev. In April 2020, Lockheed Martin was contracted by the US government to produce Bulgaria&#x27;s F-16Vs, completion is expected in 2027.

In September 2022, there were reports that Bulgaria had been given an offer from the Swedish government of procuring 10 Gripen C/Ds from Sweden for delivery within two years. The &quot;24chasa&quot; newspaper referenced a letter from Bulgarian Acting Minister of Defense Dimitar Stojanov to his Swedish counterpart Peter Hultqvist dated 30 September 2022. Dimitar Stojanov allegedly wrote in the letter that they would like to receive a more detailed offer, including an option of a leasing arrangement, and he invited Swedish representatives to visit Sofia to discuss further details. Peter Hultqvist&#x27;s office confirmed to the Swedish news agency TT that it concerned a potential procurement inquiry. At the time Saab offered no comments on the issue. The Swedish Defence Materiel Administration, FMV, claimed that they were aware of reports about Bulgarian interest but they had not received any formal inquiry so they refrained from commenting.

====Canada====
Canada is a level 3 industrial partner in the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II development program, however an open fighter competition was launched in December 2017. The Royal Canadian Air Force announced in February 2018 that Saab was a contestant along with the F-35. The competition was very dependent on industrial benefits for Canadian companies; in May 2019, Saab offered to build Gripens in Canada akin to the Brazilian arrangement.

In June 2019, Saab stated it was ready to offer 88 Gripen Es to Canada, in addition to full transfer of technology, Saab stated that they could offer the integration of American and other non-Saab equipment so that the aircraft is interoperable with the US military. Saab also stated the Gripen E was built for arctic conditions. In January 2021, Saab offered to build two aerospace centers in Canada as part of the technology transfer proposal. On 1 December 2021, the Canadian government confirmed that the Super Hornet did not meet its requirements and reduced the competitors to the F-35 and the Gripen.

In late March 2022, the Canadian government announced its intention to negotiate a contract to purchase the F-35. By early December 2022, defence sources revealed an initial funding request for 16 F-35s had been approved by the Treasury Board of Canada, though Saab claimed their offer remained eligible for selection. On 9 January 2023, the government announced the signing of a final contract to procure 88 F-35s, ending the Gripen&#x27;s chance for selection.

====Croatia====

On 24 October 2015, Sweden announced its Gripen C/D bid for Croatia&#x27;s fighter replacement requirement, following a request for information from the Croatian Ministry of Defence in June for between 8 and 12 new-build aircraft to replace Croatia&#x27;s fleet of MiG-21bis aircraft. The LTDP would run from 2015 to 2024 and was scheduled to have funding available for a replacement aircraft in 2019. On 29 March 2018, the Croatian government chose Israel&#x27;s bid of 12 F-16C/D Barak 2020 fighters over the Gripen; this sale was halted in January 2019 after the US failed to approve Israel&#x27;s sale of the modified aircraft to Croatia. Sweden submitted another response in September 2020 following a second RFP identifying Croatia&#x27;s requirements issued in the spring 2020 for twelve fighters. The second RFP opened up the competition to both new and secondhand aircraft. On 28 May 2021, the Prime Minister of Croatia Andrej Plenković announced that the Croatian Government will buy 12 used French Rafale F3R fighters for the Croatian Air Force.

====Denmark====

In 2007, Denmark signed a Memorandum of Understanding between the Defence Ministers of Sweden and Denmark to evaluate the Gripen as a replacement for Denmark&#x27;s fleet of 48 F-16s. Denmark also requested the development of Gripen variants featuring more powerful engines, larger payloads, longer range, and additional avionics; this request contributed to Saab&#x27;s decision to proceed with the JAS E/F&#x27;s development. Denmark repeatedly delayed the purchase decision; in 2013, Saab indicated that the Gripen was one of four contenders for the Danish purchase, alongside Boeing&#x27;s Super Hornet, Lockheed Martin&#x27;s F-35 Lightning II, and the Eurofighter Typhoon. Denmark is a level-3 partner in the JSF programme, and has already invested US$200 million. The final selection was to be in mid-2015 where an order for 24 to 30 fighters was expected. The Swedish government announced on 21 July 2014 the Gripen&#x27;s withdrawal from the Danish competition, having chosen not to respond to the invitation to tender.

On 9 June 2016, the Danish defence committee agreed to purchase 27 F-35As to replace its F-16s for US$3 billion. In May 2019, Danish Minister of Defence Claus Hjort Frederiksen stated that Denmark is considering stationing fighters in Greenland to counter Russia&#x27;s expanding military presence in the Arctic region. Frederiksen said that Greenland&#x27;s air defense would need at least four fighters, in turn requiring Denmark to make an additional purchase. In January 2020, Lockheed Martin announced that assembly had begun on L-001, the first of 27 F-35As destined for Denmark.
According to DR, the Danish public service broadcaster, the US spied on other contenders, Danish ministries, and the defense industry to gain an advantage in the procurement process.

====Finland====

The Gripen&#x27;s first export bid was to Finland, where it competed against F-16, F/A-18, MiG-29 and Mirage 2000 to replace the Finnish Air Force&#x27;s J 35 Draken and MiG-21 fleet. In May 1992, McDonnell Douglas F/A-18C/D was announced as a winner on performance and cost grounds. The Finnish Minister of Defence, Elisabeth Rehn, stated that delays in Gripen&#x27;s development schedule had hurt its chances in the competition.

In June 2015, a working group set up by the Finnish MoD proposed starting a program to replace the Finnish Air Force&#x27;s F/A-18 Hornet fleet; it recognized five potential types: Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-35, and Gripen. In December 2015, the Finnish MoD sent a letter to Britain, France, Sweden and the US, informing them that the HX Fighter Program had launched to buy multi-role fighters by around 2025 and mentioned the Gripen. A Request for Information (RFI) for the program was sent in April 2016, and five responses were received by November 2016; an official request for quotations was sent to all five responders in 2018. On 29 January 2020, the Gripen E prototype 39–10 landed at Tampere–Pirkkala Airport to participate in HX Challenge, the HX Fight Program&#x27;s flight evaluations. It was later followed by Gripen NG demonstrator 39–7 (sensor testbed), while a GlobalEye participated in the trials from Linköping in Sweden.

Saab announced the successful completion of planned tests to demonstrate both the Gripen and GlobalEye. On 31 January 2020 Saab submitted a revised offer in response to the revised Request for Quotation for the HX programme and follow-on BAFO activity anticipated to continue through April 2021. Saab submitted its Best and Final Offer (BAFO) for 64 JAS 39Es, two GlobalEye AEW&amp;C, weapons package, and an option for JAS 39Fs. Over 20% of the proposal price relating to Gripen was for weapons such as Meteor, IRIS-T, KEPD 350, SPEAR, EAJP (Electronic Attack Jammer Pod), and LADM (Lightweight Air-launched Decoy Missile). On 5 December 2021, the Finnish newspaper Iltalehti reported that several sources stated the Finnish Defense Forces recommendation for the F-35 as Finland&#x27;s next fighter and pointed to its capability and expected long lifespan as key reasons. On 10 December 2021, the F-35&#x27;s selection was officially confirmed by the Finnish government.

====India====

The Gripen was a contender for the Indian MRCA competition for 126 multirole combat aircraft. In April 2008, Gripen International offered the Next Generation Gripen for India&#x27;s tender and opened an office in New Delhi to support its efforts in the Indian market. On 4 February 2009, Saab announced that it had partnered with India&#x27;s Tata Group to develop the Gripen to fit India&#x27;s needs. The Indian Air Force (IAF) conducted extensive evaluations of the Gripen&#x27;s flight performance, logistics capability, weapons systems, advanced sensors and weapons firing. In April 2011, the IAF rejected the bid in favour of the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Dassault Rafale. Allegedly, IAF officials, while happy with the Gripen NG&#x27;s improved capabilities, noted its high reliance on US-supplied hardware, such as electronics, weaponry and the GE-F414 engine, as a factor that may hamper exports.

In 2015, after the Rafale order was cut back to just 36 aircraft, Saab indicated a willingness to set up joint production of the Gripen in India. In October 2016, Saab, among other manufacturers, reportedly received an informal request-for-information query, resuming a new competition for a single-engine fighter to replace the IAF&#x27;s Soviet-built MiG-21 and MiG-27 fleets; Saab had already submitted an unsolicited bid. In November 2017, Saab pledged full Gripen E technology transfer to India if it is awarded the contract.

On 23 September 2016, Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian signed the contract for the purchase of 36 off-the-shelf Rafales in a deal worth €7.8 billion with an option for 18 more at the same inflation-adjusted price. The deliveries were to begin in 2019 and complete by 2022. The deal includes weapons and spares; the aircraft will be equipped with Meteor missiles. The first Rafale was handed over to the Indian Air Force in October 2019. The first batch of 5 fighters arrived in India on 29 July 2020. As of January 2021, a total of 11 fighters have arrived in India from France.

An RFI was again issued by India in April 2018 for the procurement of 114 multi-role combat aircraft at a budget of $20 billion for the Indian Air Force. Gripen is competing with six other types in a fresh tender often referred to as MMRCA 2.0 in the media, for the procurement of 114 multi-role combat aircraft. An official of Saab, on 17 October 2024, stated that Saab offers full technology transfer for setting-up an entire Gripen ecosystem in the country. They aim to deliver the first Gripen-E/F aircraft they are offering within 3 years if they are awarded the contract. They also had discussions with various private sector companies for co-production.

====Indonesia====
In July 2016, Saab Indonesia confirmed having submitted a proposal earlier in the year in response to an Indonesian Air Force requirement. The proposal included the initial acquisition of 16 Gripen C/D for US$1.5 billion, to replace Northrop F-5E Tiger II in service with the Indonesian Air Force since the 1980s. Saab have expressed the intention for the bid to &quot;100%&quot; comply with Indonesia&#x27;s Defence Industry Law 2012 (or, Law Number 16), which requires foreign contractors to work with local industry, collaborating on production and sharing technology. They also indicated that the bid could replace the C/D versions with the E-version, if Indonesia were willing to accept longer delivery times. Competing aircraft for the requirement include the F-16V, Su-35, Dassault Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon. As of 2023, the Indonesian Air Force has purchased 42 Rafales and 12 Mirage 2000s from Qatar.

====Netherlands====

In July 2008, the Netherlands announced it would evaluate Gripen NG together with four other competitors; in response, Saab offered 85 aircraft to the Royal Netherlands Air Force in August 2008. On 18 December 2008, it was reported that the Netherlands had evaluated the F-35 as having a better performance-price relation than the Gripen NG. On 13 January 2009, &quot;NRC Handelsblad&quot; claimed that, according to Swedish sources, Saab had offered to deliver 85 Gripens for €4.8 billion to the Dutch Air Force, about 1 billion euro cheaper than budgeted for the F-35.

====Norway====

On 18 January 2008, the Norwegian Ministry of Defence issued a Request for Binding Information (RBI) to the Swedish Defence Material Administration, who issued an offer for 48 Gripens in April 2008. On 20 November 2008, the selection of the F-35 Lightning II for the Royal Norwegian Air Force was announced, stating that it was the only candidate to meet all operational requirements; media reports claimed the requirements were tilted in the F-35&#x27;s favour. Saab and Sweden&#x27;s defence minister Sten Tolgfors stated that Norway&#x27;s cost calculations were flawed; the offer being for 48 Gripens over 20 years, but Norway had extrapolated it to operating 57 aircraft over 30 years, thus doubling the cost; cost projections also failed to relate to the Gripen&#x27;s operational costs. Norway also calculated greater attrition losses than what Sweden considered reasonable. According to Tolgfors, Norway&#x27;s decision complicated further export deals. In December 2010, leaked United States diplomatic cables revealed that the United States deliberately delayed Sweden&#x27;s request for access to an AESA radar until after Norway&#x27;s selection, and that Norway&#x27;s consideration of the Gripen &quot;was just a show&quot; and that Norway had purchased the F-35 due to &quot;high-level political pressure&quot; from the US.

====Poland====

The Gripen C/D was a contender for 48 multirole fighters for the Polish Air Force in 2001. On 27 December 2002, the Polish Defence Minister announced the F-16C/D Block 50/52+&#x27;s selection. According to Stephen Larrabee, the selection was heavily influenced by Lockheed Martin&#x27;s lucrative offset agreement (totaling $3.5 billion and 170% offset against Gripen International&#x27;s €3.2 billion with 146% offset) and by a political emphasis on Poland&#x27;s strategic relationship with the US and NATO. Both Gripen International and Dassault Aviation (who offered the Mirage 2000-5 Mk 2) described the decision as political. A former vice-minister of defense claimed that the industrial part of the JAS 39 offer was better and included research participation proposals.

In 2014, Poland launched the &quot;Harpia&quot; program (harpy eagle) aimed at acquiring multi-role combat aircraft from 2021 as part of its modernisation plans to replace the ageing fleet of Sukhoi Su-22M4 &#x27;Fitter-K&#x27; ground attack aircraft and Mikoyan MiG-29 &#x27;Fulcrum&#x27; fighters. On 23 November 2017, the Armament Inspectorate announced the start of the procurement process. By 22 December 2017, five entities had expressed interest in the procurement, including Saab AB with Gripen NG, Lockheed Martin with F-35, Boeing with F/A-18, Leonardo with Eurofighter Typhoon and Fights-On Logistics with second hand F-16s. In May 2019, the Polish Defense Ministry formally requested to buy 32 fifth-generation F-35A for $4 billion with delivery from 2023 to 2026 with an option for 32 more from 2027.

====Slovakia====
On 30 August 2014, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Sweden signed a letter of intent agreeing to co-operate on using the Gripen, which might lead to its acquisition by the Slovak Air Force. The letter of intent laid the foundation for bilateral co-operation around a common airspace surveillance of Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Slovakia sought to replace its MiG-29 fighters and the Gripen has been reported as the aircraft of choice, although the requirement would go to open competition. They may seek to lease fighters rather than buy, as did neighbouring Hungary and the Czech Republic.

In February 2018, the Slovak Ministry of Defence announced the launch of a new study to examine bids from the US and Swedish governments for the F-16V Viper and the Gripen to replace Slovakian MiG-29s. On 11 July 2018, the Slovakian Defense ministry announced that it will purchase 14 F-16V Block 70/72s instead of Gripen Cs. The F-16V package includes ammunition, training and logistics for a total of €1.589 billion (US$1.85 billion). Political opposition, among them former Defence Minister Ľubomír Galko, expressed criticism that the deal lacked transparency. On 12 December 2018, Slovakia signed a contract to acquire 14 F-16 Block 70/72. All are to be delivered by the end of 2023.

====Switzerland====

In January 2008, the Swiss Defence Material Administration invited Gripen International to bid to replace the nation&#x27;s F-5 fleet. Saab responded with an initial proposal on 2 July 2008; other contenders were the Dassault Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon. On 30 November 2011, the Swiss government announced its decision to buy 22 Gripen NG aircraft for 3.1 billion Swiss francs. In 2012, a confidential report of the Swiss Air Force&#x27;s 2009 tests of the three contenders was leaked, which had rated the Gripen as performing substantially below both the Rafale and the Eurofighter. The Gripen was assessed as satisfactory for reconnaissance but unsatisfactory for combat air patrol and strike missions. The JAS 39C/D was evaluated, while the Gripen NG was bid. The parliamentary security commission found that the Gripen offered the most risks, but voted to go ahead as it was the cheapest option. The Gripen was rated satisfactory for operational suitability and overall was rated satisfactory.

On 25 August 2012, the plan to order was confirmed by both Swedish and Swiss authorities. Deliveries were expected to run from 2018 to 2021 at a fixed price of CHF 3.126 billion (US$3.27 billion) including development costs, mission planning systems, initial spares and support, training, and certification; the Swedish government also guaranteed the price, performance and operational suitability. Eight JAS 39Cs and three JAS 39Ds were to be leased from 2016 to 2020 to train Swiss pilots and allow the F-5s to be retired. In 2013, Saab moved to increase Swiss industry offsets above 100% of the deal value after the Swiss parliament&#x27;s upper house voted down the deal&#x27;s financing. On 27 August 2013, the National Council&#x27;s Security Commission approved the purchase, followed by the lower and upper houses of the parliament&#x27;s approval in September 2013. Elements of the left and center of the political spectrum often criticized the Gripen as unnecessary and too expensive. On 18 May 2014, 53.4% of Swiss voters voted against the plan in a national referendum. Reportedly, objectors questioned the role of fighter aircraft in general, and the relevance of alternatives such as UAVs, surface-to-air missiles, or cyberwarfare capabilities.

In 2015, Switzerland was set to relaunch the F-5E/F, and now also F/A-18C/D, replacement programme; the Gripen was again considered the favourite. In March 2018, Swiss officials named contenders in its Air 2030 programme that includes not only combat aircraft but also ground-based air defense systems: the Gripen, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin F-35. In January 2019, Saab submitted a formal proposal for 30 to 40 Gripen Es to Armasuisse. It was due to perform evaluation flights for Swiss personnel at Payerne Air Base in June 2019. However, in June 2019, Saab did not participate at Payerne with the Gripen E because it was not considered ready to perform all tests.

====Others====
Sweden withdrew from the Belgian F-16 replacement competition due to foreign policy incompatibility.

Oman ended up procuring the Eurofighter Typhoon.

Pakistan was interested in the Gripen C/D, but it was denied by Sweden in 2004.

Romania decided to acquire used F-16s instead.

The Gripen was one of the aircraft evaluated by the Chilean Air Force in 1999. Chile finally selected the F-16 over the Gripen, Boeing F/A-18, and Dassault Mirage 2000–5.

There were plans to begin licensed production of the Gripen in Lviv, Ukraine. However, these plans have stalled since 2014.

==Variants==
* Gripen A, or JAS 39A: initial single seat version that entered service with the Swedish Air Force in 1996. A number have been upgraded to the C standard or been converted to 39D at a 2:1 ratio.
* Gripen B, or JAS 39B: two-seat version of the 39A for training, specialised missions and aircraft type conversion. To fit the second crew member and life support systems, the internal cannon and an internal fuel tank were removed and the airframe lengthened 0.66 m (2 ft 2 in).
* Gripen C, or JAS 39C: NATO-compatible single seat version with extended capabilities in terms of armament, electronics, etc. Can be refuelled in flight. Variant was first deliveried on 6 September 2002.

* Gripen D, or JAS 39D: two-seat version of the JAS 39C, with similar alterations as the JAS 39B.
* Gripen NG: Follow-on the &quot;Gripen Demo&quot; technology demonstrator. Changes from the JAS 39C include the more powerful F414G engine, Raven ES-05 AESA radar, increased fuel capacity and payload, and two additional hardpoints. These improvements reportedly increased costs to an estimated 24,000 Swiss Francs (US$27,000) per hour, and the flyaway cost to 100 million Swiss Francs (US$113M).

* Gripen E, or JAS 39E: single-seat production version developed from the Gripen NG program, priced at US$85 million per unit. Sweden and Brazil have ordered the variant. Brazil&#x27;s designation for this variant is F-39E.
* Gripen F, or JAS 39F: two-seat version of the JAS 39E. Eight ordered by Brazil, to be developed locally and assembled in Gavião Peixoto, Brazil; planned for pilot training and combat, being optimized for back seat air battle management, with jamming, information warfare and network attack, besides weapon system officer and electronic warfare roles. Brazil&#x27;s designation for the variant is F-39F.

===Proposals===
* Gripen Aggressor: &#x27;red team&#x27; weaponless variant of the Gripen C &amp; possibly D intended for the UK&#x27;s Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) requirement, and part of the US Air Force&#x27;s adversary air (AdAir) opportunity.
* Gripen Maritime: proposed carrier-based version based on the Gripen E. , its development was underway. , Brazil and India were interested. This variant has also been named &quot;Sea Gripen&quot;. In July 2017, the Brazilian Navy began studying the Gripen Maritime for naval purposes and is looking to replace its fleet of Douglas A-4KU Skyhawk II aircraft.

==Accidents and incidents==
, Gripen aircraft have been involved in at least 10 incidents, including nine hull-loss accidents, with one loss of life.

The first two crashes, in 1989 and 1993 respectively, occurred during public displays of the Gripen and resulted in considerable negative media reports. The first crash was filmed by a Sveriges Television news crew and led to critics calling for development to be cancelled. The second crash occurred in an empty area on the island of Långholmen during the 1993 Stockholm Water Festival with tens of thousands of spectators present. The decision to display the Gripen over large crowds was publicly criticized, and was compared to the 1989 crash. Both the 1989 and 1993 crashes were related to flight control software issues and pilot-induced oscillation; the flight control system was corrected by 1995. The first and only fatal crash occurred on 14 January 2017 at Hat Yai International Airport, Thailand, during an airshow for Thai Children&#x27;s Day; the pilot did not survive. The last crash occurred on 21 August 2018 at Kallinge Airport near the southern Swedish town of Ronneby; the pilot was able to successfully eject from the aircraft. The following investigation by the Swedish Accident Investigation Authority led to the conclusion by DNA analysis of the engine that it collided with Great cormorant birds at a speed of and height .

<text>Lancaster (, ) is a city in Lancashire, England, and the main cultural hub, economic and commercial centre of City of Lancaster district. The city is on the River Lune, directly inland from Morecambe Bay. Lancaster is the county town, although Lancashire County Council has been based at County Hall in Preston since its formation in 1889.

The city&#x27;s long history is marked by Lancaster Roman Fort, Lancaster Castle, Lancaster Priory Church, Lancaster Cathedral and the Ashton Memorial. It is the seat of Lancaster University and has a campus of the University of Cumbria. It had a population of 52,234 in the 2011 census, compared to the district, which had a population of 138,375. 

The House of Lancaster was a branch of the English royal family. The Duchy of Lancaster still holds large estates on behalf of Charles III, who is the Duke of Lancaster. The Port of Lancaster and the 18th-century Lancaster slave trade played a major role in the city&#x27;s growth, but for many years the outport of Glasson Dock, downstream, has been the main shipping facility.

==History==

===Toponymy===
Lancaster was recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, as &quot;Loncastre&quot;, where &quot;Lon&quot; refers to the River Lune and &quot;castre&quot; from the Old English &quot;cæster&quot; and Latin &quot;castrum&quot; for &quot;fort&quot; to the Roman fort that stood on the site.

===Roman and Saxon eras===

A Roman fort was built by the end of the 1st century CE on the hill where Lancaster Castle now stands, possibly as early as the 60s, based on Roman coin evidence. Coin evidence also suggests that the fort was not continuously inhabited in its early years. It was rebuilt in stone about 102. The fort name is known only in a shortened form; the only evidence is a Roman milestone found outside Lancaster, with an inscription ending L MP IIII, meaning &quot;from L – 4 miles, and that its name began with an L. The fort was perhaps named Calunium.

Roman baths were found in 1812 and can be seen near the junction of Bridge Lane and Church Street. There was presumably a bath-house with the 4th-century fort. The Roman baths incorporated a reused inscription of the Gallic Emperor Postumus, dating from 262 to 266. The 3rd-century fort was garrisoned by the &quot;ala Sebosiana&quot; and &quot;numerus Barcariorum Tigrisiensium&quot;.

The ancient &quot;Wery Wall&quot; was identified in 1950 as the north wall of the 4th-century fort, which was a drastic remodelling of the 3rd-century one, while retaining the same orientation. The later fort is the only example in north-west Britain of a 4th-century type, with massive curtain-wall and projecting bastions typical of the &quot;Saxon Shore&quot; or Wales. Extension of the technique as far north as Lancaster shows that the coast between Cumberland and North Wales was not left defenceless after the west-coast attacks and the disaster in the Carausian Revolt of 296, which followed from those under Albinus in 197.

The fort at its largest extent covered . Evidence suggests that it stayed in use until the end of Roman occupation of Britain. Church Street and some of St Leonard&#x27;s Gate probably mark the initial course of the Roman road up the valley to the fort at Over Burrow.

Little is known of Lancaster from the end of Roman rule to the early 5th century and the Norman Conquest of the late 11th century. Despite a lack of documentation for the period, it is thought that Lancaster remained inhabited. It lay on the fringes of the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria and over time may have passed from one to the other. Archaeological evidence suggests there was a monastery on or near the site of today&#x27;s Lancaster Priory by the 700s or 800s. The Anglo-Saxon runic &quot;Cynibald&#x27;s cross&quot; found at the Priory in 1807 is thought to date from the late 9th century. Lancaster was probably one of several abbeys founded under Wilfrid.

===Medieval===

After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, Lancaster fell under the control of William I, as stated in the Domesday Book of 1086, which has the earliest known mention of Lancaster as such in any document. The founding Priory charter dated 1094 is the first known document specific to Lancaster. By this time William had passed Lancaster and its surroundings to Roger de Poitou. The document also suggests the monastery was refounded as a parish church some time before 1066.

Lancaster became a borough in 1193 under King Richard I. Its first charter, dated 12 June 1193, was from John, Count of Mortain, who later became King of England.

Lancaster Castle, partly built in the 13th century and enlarged by Elizabeth I, stands on the site of a Roman garrison. During The Great Raid of 1322, damage was done to the castle by Robert the Bruce, though it resisted the attack and was restored and strengthened by John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, who added much of the Gateway Tower and a turret on the keep or Lungess Tower, which has been named &quot;John o&#x27; Gaunt&#x27;s Chair&quot;. In 1322 the Scots burnt the town. It was rebuilt but removed from its position on the hill to the slope and foot. Again in 1389, after the Battle of Otterburn, it was destroyed by the Scots. Lancaster Castle is known as the site of the Pendle witch trials in 1612. It was said that the court based in the castle (the Lancaster Assizes) sentenced more people to be hanged than any other in the country outside London, earning Lancaster the nickname, &quot;the Hanging Town&quot;. It also figured prominently in the suppression of Catholicism during the Reformation – at least eleven Catholic priests were executed and a memorial to them as the Lancaster Martyrs stands by the city centre.
The traditional emblem of the House of Lancaster is the Red Rose of Lancaster, similar to that of the House of York with a white rose. The names derive from emblems of the Royal Duchies of Lancaster and York in the 15th century. This erupted into a civil war over rival claims to the throne during the Wars of the Roses.

More recently the term &quot;Wars of the Roses&quot; has been applied to rivalry in sports between teams from Lancashire and Yorkshire. It is also applied to the annual Roses Tournament between Lancaster and York universities.
Lancaster gained a first charter in 1193 as a market town and borough, but had to await city status until 1937. 

===18th-century port===
Many of the city&#x27;s central buildings, including those lining St George&#x27;s Quay date from the 18th century, as the Port of Lancaster became one of the UK&#x27;s busiest and the Lancaster slave trade was the fourth most important in the UK slave trade. Among prominent Lancaster slavers were Dodshon Foster, Thomas Hinde and his namesake son. The last slave ship to be constructed in Lancaster was the 267-tonne &quot;Trafalgar&quot;, built in 1806 at Brockbank’s shipyard for Samuel Hinderland and William Hinde. Lancaster&#x27;s role as a major port diminished as the river began to silt up and Morecambe, Glasson Dock and Sunderland Point became preeminent for brief periods. Heysham Port has now eclipsed all others on the Lune.

===Recent history===
A permanent military presence was built up with the completion of Bowerham Barracks in 1880. The Phoenix Street drill hall was completed in 1894.

Since the Industrial Revolution, the city was home to many industries from the 18th century to the 20th century. The main industries in the city at the time were candle making, sailcloth making, rope making and shipbuilding. Since the decline of the industrial revolution, Lancaster suffered from economic decline and high unemployment rates like many parts of the north of England. The city underwent regeneration and is now a tourist destination.

Lancaster is mainly a service-oriented city. Products include animal feed, textiles, chemicals, livestock, paper, synthetic fibre, farm machinery, HGV trailers and mineral fibres. In recent years, a high-tech sector has emerged from information technology and telecommunications companies investing in the city.

In March 2004, Lancaster was granted Fairtrade City status.

Lancaster was home to the European headquarters of Reebok. After merging with Adidas, Reebok moved to Bolton and Stockport in 2007.

In May 2015, Elizabeth II visited the castle for commemorations for the 750th anniversary of the creation of the Duchy of Lancaster.

==Governance==

The former City and Municipal Borough of Lancaster and the Municipal Borough of Morecambe and Heysham, along with other authorities, merged in 1974 to form the City of Lancaster district within the shire county of Lancashire. This was given city status and Lancaster City Council became the governing body for the district. Lancaster is an unparished area and has no separate council. It is divided into wards (for elections to Lancaster City Council), such as Bulk, Castle, Ellel, John O&#x27;Gaunt (named after John of Gaunt, the 1st Duke of Lancaster), Scotforth East, Scotforth West, Skerton East, Skerton West and University and Scotforth Rural.

For elections to Lancashire County Council, Lancaster is split into the electoral divisions of Lancaster Central (the city centre and an area extending south including Cockerham and Glasson Dock), Lancaster East (south of the River Lune and east of the Lancaster Canal), Lancaster South East (bordered by the River Conder with the University at its southern point) and Skerton (north of the River Lune).

===Political representation===
The city lies in the Lancaster and Wyre constituency for elections of Members of Parliament to the House of Commons, represented since 2015 by Cat Smith of the Labour Party (as Lancaster and Fleetwood constituency before 2024). 

While the United Kingdom was in the European Union, Lancaster was in the North West England European Parliamentary Constituency.

In the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century, the city council was under the control of the Morecambe Bay Independents (MBIs), who campaigned for an independent Morecambe council. In 2003, their influence waned and Labour became the largest party on the council. They formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats and Greens. At the May 2007 local elections, Labour lost ground to the Greens in Lancaster and the MBIs in Morecambe, resulting in no overall control, with all parties represented in a PR administration. The 2011 elections saw Labour emerge as the largest party. They reached a joint administrative arrangement with the Greens.

The 2019 Lancaster City Council election results put no party in overall control. The council was run by a coalition of Labour, Green, Eco-Socialist Independent and Liberal Democrat councillors, supported by the Independent Group, with Conservatives and MBIs in opposition. The cabinet consisted of 4 Labour, 4 Green, 1 Eco-Socialist, 1 Independent Group. At 10 seats, Lancaster had one of the country&#x27;s largest Green Party representations. The 2023 Lancaster City Council election resulted in a council with Labour as the largest party but not in overall control, with 24 of the 61 seats.

After the 2021 Lancashire County Council election, Lancaster East, Lancaster South East and Skerton were represented on the county council by Labour, while Lancaster Central was represented by the Green Party.

==Geography==
Lancaster is Lancashire&#x27;s northernmost city, three miles () inland from Morecambe Bay. It is on the River Lune (from which comes its name), and the Lancaster Canal. It becomes hillier from the Lune Valley eastwards, with Williamson Hill in the north-west a notable height at and recognised as a TuMP: a hill with &quot;thirty and upwards metres prominence&quot;. The central area of the city can be roughly defined by the railway to the west, the canal to the south and east, and the river to the north.

===Built-up area===
Lancaster, Morecambe and Heysham have been identified by the Office for National Statistics as forming the Lancaster/Morecambe Built-up area, with a population of 97,150 in the 2011 census. Within this, ONS identifies a Lancaster built-up area sub division with a 2011 population of 48,085.

===Green belt===

There is a small portion of green belt on the northern fringe of Lancaster, covering the area into Carnforth and helping to prevent further urban expansion towards nearby Morecambe, Hest Bank, Slyne and Bolton-le-Sands.
==Transport==
===Road===

The A6 road, one of the main historic north–south roads in England, passes through the city centre, with northbound and southbound traffic on separate streets, and crosses the Lune at Greyhound Bridge northbound and Skerton Bridge southbound (these are the two furthest-downstream road crossing points of the Lune). The road leads south to Preston, Chorley and Manchester and north to Carnforth, Kendal, Penrith and Carlisle. 

The M6 motorway passes to the east of Lancaster with junctions 33 and 34 to the south and north. The Bay Gateway, a dual carriageway opened in 2016, links Heysham to the M6.

Lancaster&#x27;s main bus operator, Stagecoach Cumbria &amp; North Lancashire, operates network of services from Lancaster bus station throughout the Lancaster District and services to more distant places such as Kendal, Keswick, Kirkby Lonsdale, Preston and Blackpool. There are buses to Lancaster University, the No. 1 and No. 1A services run every 10–15 minutes using double-deckers, with less frequent services 4, 41 and 42. Other routes are covered by Kirkby Lonsdale Coach Hire, including the 582 to Kirkby Lonsdale, Settle and Skipton and the 89 to Knott End-on-Sea.

===Rail===
Lancaster is served by the West Coast Main Line from Lancaster railway station. The station was formerly named Lancaster Castle, to differentiate it from Lancaster Green Ayre on the Leeds–Morecambe line, which closed in 1966. There are train services to and from London, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Barrow-in-Furness, and a local service to Morecambe.

The city council aims to open a railway station serving the university and south Lancaster, although this is not feasible in the short or medium term with current levels of demand. The Caton–Morecambe section of the former North Western railway is now used as a cycle path.

===Water and air===
The Port of Lancaster gained importance in the 18th century. In 1750 the Lancaster Port Commission was established to develop the port. However, in more recent years, shipping visits Glasson Dock, where the Port commission is now based. Heysham Port, about west of Lancaster, is used by ferry services to the Isle of Man, Northern Ireland and Ireland.

The Lancaster Canal and River Lune pass through the city.

The nearest airports are Manchester and Liverpool.

===Cycling===
In 2005, Lancaster was one of six English towns chosen to be cycling demonstration towns to promote cycling as a means of transport. Lancaster has cycle routes to many nearby places, many are off-road using disused railways or canal towpaths.

Lancaster has a range of historic buildings and venues, having retained many fine examples of Georgian architecture. Lancaster Castle, the Priory Church of St Mary and the Edwardian Ashton Memorial are among the sites of historical importance. Its many museums include Lancaster City Museum, Maritime Museum, the Cottage Museum and the Judges&#x27; Lodgings Museum.

Lancaster Friends Meeting House, dating from 1708, is the longest continual Quaker meeting site in the world, with an original building built in 1677. George Fox, founder of Quakerism, was near the site several times in the 1660s and spent two years imprisoned in Lancaster Castle. The meeting house holds regular Quaker meetings and a wide range of cultural activities including adult learning, meditation, art classes, music and political meetings. Lancaster Grand Theatre is another historic cultural venue, under its many names. It has played a major part in social and cultural life since it was built in 1782.

Lancaster is known nationally for its Arts scene. There are around 600 business and organisations in the region involved directly or indirectly in arts and culture.

In 2009, several major arts bodies based in the district formed a consortium called Lancaster Arts Partners (LAP) to champion strategic development of arts activities in Lancaster District. Notable partners include Ludus Dance, More Music and the Dukes. LAP curates and promotes &quot;Lancaster First Fridays&quot;, a monthly multi-disciplinary mini-festival under its brand &quot;Lancaster Arts City&quot;.

Lancaster University has a public arts organisation, part of LAP, known as Lancaster Arts at Lancaster University. Its programmes include Lancaster&#x27;s Nuffield Theatre, one of the largest professional studio theatres in Europe, the Peter Scott Gallery, with the most significant collection of Royal Lancastrian ceramics in Britain, and the Lancaster International Concerts Series, drawing nationally and internationally renowned classical and world-music artists.

The gallery in the Storey Creative Industries Centre is now programmed and run by Lancaster City Council. In 2013 the previous incumbent organisation &quot;The Storey Gallery&quot; moved out of the building and reformed as &quot;Storey G2&quot;. The Storey Creative Industries Centre is also home to Lancaster&#x27;s Litfest, which runs an annual literature festival. In the summer months Williamson Park hosts outdoor performances, including a Dukes &quot;Play in the Park&quot;, which over the past 26 years has attracted 460,000 people, as the UK&#x27;s biggest outdoor walkabout theatre event.

Lancaster is known as the Northern City of Ale, with almost 30 pubs serving cask ale. The pubs include the &quot;White Cross&quot;, &quot;Three Mariners&quot;, &quot;Borough&quot; and &quot;Water Witch&quot;. There are two cask ale breweries: Lancaster Brewery and a microbrewery run by the Borough. There is a local CAMRA (Campaign for Real Ale) branch at Lunesdale.

The Lancaster Grand Theatre and the Dukes are notable venues for live performance, as are the Yorkshire House (currently closed), Jailors Barrel, The John O&#x27; Gaunt and The Bobbin. Throughout the year events are held in and around the city, such as the Lancaster Music Festival, Lancaster Jazz Festival, and Chinese New Year celebrations in the city centre.

Every November the city hosts a daylight and art festival entitled &quot;Light Up Lancaster&quot;, which includes a prominent fireworks display.

Lancaster still has two city-centre cinemas; Vue and the Dukes playhouse. The 1930s art deco &quot;Regal Cinema&quot; closed in 2006. The Gregson Centre is also known for small film screenings and cultural events.

===Art and literature===
John Henderson (c.1770–1853) painted many views of the town. One of these, together with a poetical illustration (which relates to the treacherous sands of Morecambe Bay) by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, was published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1833.
===Music===
The city&#x27;s semi-professional Haffner Orchestra has a reputation for classical music. It performs in the Ashton Hall in the city centre and at Lancaster University.

During parades and festivals it is common to see two other long standing musical groups perform, Lancaster City Brass, which is the oldest remaining brass band in the city celebrating its 75th anniversary in 2021 and Batala who recently completed 15 years of Samba Regge drumming.

Lancaster has been producing successful bands and musicians since the 1990s, notably the drummer Keith Baxter of 3 Colours Red.The all-girl punk-rock band Angelica used the Lancaster Musicians&#x27; Co-operative, the main rehearsal and recording studio in the area.

The city has also produced many other musicians, including singer and songwriter John Waite, who first became known as lead singer of The Babys and had a solo #1 hit in the US, &quot;Missing You&quot;. As part of the band Bad English, John Waite also had a #1 hit in the Billboard top hundred in the 1970s called &quot;When I See You Smile&quot;. Additionally, Paul James, better known as The Rev, former guitarist of English punk band Towers of London who is now in the band Day 21 and plays guitar live on tour for The Prodigy; Chris Acland, drummer of the early 1990s shoegaze band Lush; Tom English, drummer of North East indie band Maxïmo Park and Steve Kemp, drummer of the indie band Hard-Fi.

Lancaster continues to produce bands and musicians such as singer-songwriter Jay Diggins, and acts like The Lovely Eggs, receiving considerable national radio play and press coverage in recent years. More recently, Lancaster locals Massive Wagons signed to Nottingham-based independent label Earache Records.

Since 2006, Lancaster Library has hosted regular music events under the &quot;Get it Loud in Libraries&quot; initiative. Musicians such as Clean Bandit, The Long Blondes, Ellie Goulding, Marina And The Diamonds, Jessie J, Wolf Alice, The Wombats, The Thrills, Kate Nash, Adele and Bat for Lashes have taken part. Get It Loud in Libraries has gained national exposure, featuring on The One Show on BBC1 and having gigs reviewed in &quot;Observer Music Monthly&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Art Rocker&quot;.

Notable popular music venues include The Dukes, The Grand Theatre, and The Gregson Centre. 

====Festivals====
The Lancaster Jazz and Lancaster Music Festivals are respectively held every September and October, at venues throughout the city. In 2013 the headline jazz act was The Neil Cowley Trio, performing at The Dukes, whilst one of the Lancaster Music Festival headline acts was Jay Diggins at the Dalton Rooms.

The Highest Point Festival takes place in Williamson Park each summer, and is a successor to the A-Wing festival which was held in Lancaster Castle from 2014.

It provides undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the arts, social sciences, business, teacher training, health care and nursing. St Martin&#x27;s college was founded in 1962 as Lancaster College of Education, and took its name from Martin of Tours, a Roman soldier who converted to Christianity, because its premises were a former barracks of the King&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment. The college merged with Cumbria Institute of the Arts, in Carlisle, and parts of the University of Central Lancashire, having previously absorbed Charlotte Mason College in Ambleside, to become the University of Cumbria.

<text>Pueblo is a Puerto Rican supermarkets chain. It has been one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s major supermarket chains since 1955. Pueblo operates supermarkets in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

==History==
The brainchild of brothers Harold Toppel and George Toppel, sons of Russian immigrant parents, Pueblo began as a single store operation on Roosevelt Avenue in the Puerto Nuevo section of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The success of the first store led the Toppels to open 43 other Pueblo Supermarkets around the Island and, by 1960, to convert the enterprise into a public company that began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

In 1963, Pueblo expanded beyond Puerto Rico&#x27;s shores to the US Virgin Islands. Pueblo opened stores in St. Thomas and St. Croix.

The company also introduced the trademark &quot;Pueblo&quot; which included items from paper towels to rice.

In 1983, Pueblo launched the &quot;Xtra Super Food Centers&quot; concept, a discount warehouse supermarket which allowed the customer to shop for groceries in a larger store format featuring lower prices with stores located in Puerto Rico and the state of Florida. The lower prices were made possible by the elimination of some services, such as baggers. In 1989, Pueblo acquired the franchise rights to develop Blockbuster Video Stores in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. The first Blockbuster Video store opened in Puerto Rico in June 27, 1990 at Campo Rico Avenue in Carolina, next to the Administration Office and Distribution Center.

===Bankruptcy===
In 2003, Pueblo faced financial troubles and there were rumors of a potential buyer from Venezuela.
In 2007, Pueblo faced serious financial difficulties again, as many locations were sold to other competitors. Some were acquired and taken over by rival supermarkets Econo, Grande, COOP and Supermax.

=== Bidding and Pueblo, Inc. (f/k/a as PS Acquisition)===

The entire chain was auctioned in September 2007 as part of the Chapter 11 Bankruptcy process, where a bid by Ramón Calderón president of Holsum of Puerto Rico (a baker goods company) for $139 million succeeded in taking over the rest of its operations. The Bankruptcy Court in Delaware approved the transaction. The new company expected to restructure Pueblo in an effort to revive the brand.

In September, 2009 Pueblo, Inc. sold its flagship store in Campo Rico Avenue, Carolina (next to their Corporate Headquarters and Distribution Center) to Econo Supermarkets.

In April 2012, Pueblo acquired two former Supermercados Selectos stores in Southeast Puerto Rico and converted them into Pueblo, in Arroyo and Guayama.
In February, 2014, Pueblo opened a new store in Ciudadela, Santurce.

In May, 2016, Pueblo relocated their Monte Mall store in Hato Rey from the first level of the Mall to the second one facing Luis Muñoz Rivera Ave. on a bigger space of 34,000 sq. feet incorporating the Village concept.

===Pueblo Supermarkets acquisition of Amigo Supermarkets===

In June 2022, Pueblo Supermarkets announced that it would be buying the 11 Amigo Supermarkets from Walmart, the name would stay and the 1,100 employees would keep their jobs. On August 26, 2022, the transition from Amigo to Pueblo supermarkets began.

==Blockbuster Video Franchise==
On June 27, 1990, it was reported that Pueblo International had inaugurated its first video store &quot;Blockbuster Video&quot; on Campo Rico Avenue in Carolina. The store was a subsidiary of Pueblo International, which had purchased the franchise for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, for an undisclosed amount, from the BLOCKBUSTER Entertainment Corporation (BEC), which was the largest video-movie rental chain in the world at the time. At the opening ceremony, then Pueblo International president David Morrow said that with the first store the company began a successful chain of video stores in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Pueblo had entered this business because they understood that the Blockbuster concept was the future in the video rental industry, the executive also indicated. Marrow would not publicly indicate the amount of money that was paid for the franchise, he said that Pueblo would also pay, as part of the agreement, a royalty on sales volume to Blockbuster Entertainment. The store, which was built at a cost of $250,000, measured more than 6,000 square feet and had more than 10,000 videos in 30 categories. Filiberto Berríos, then general manager of the chain of stores, said that Pueblo had plans to open two more in the metropolitan area, have nine in operation by the end of 1991 and 22 in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands by 1992. Morrow explained that the second store would open on Piñeiro Avenue in Río Piedras and the location of the third was reserved because it was still under negotiation. When asked, the president of Pueblo ruled out that the chain was going to compete directly with the video clubs that Pueblo already had developed in some of its stores and Pueblo Xtras. &quot;We have 11 video stores operating in our stores and we expect to open another four this year, so we will continue to expand in that area and we do not anticipate closing any of the video stores that are already in operation”, Morrow said. Elvin Santiago was named manager of the first store, which would have a total of 28 employees.

=== Closure ===
On June 3, 2013, it was reported that Blockbuster had spent some past three months quietly closing its stores in Puerto Rico, a market it would possibly be exiting that summer. Since January of that year, the chain had closed several stores, such as in Plaza Río Hondo and the San Patricio Plaza, and that past week it had begun liquidating stores in Caguas, Cupey, De Diego Avenue in San Juan, Plaza Carolina and Rexville Plaza in Bayamón. During an informal round of the stores that were holding close out sales, it was confirmed that most, if not all locations would be shuttered by August of that year. The Blockbuster chain had undergone a significant transformation about four years earlier, when local franchisee BB Entertainment of Puerto Rico, LLC, which was headed by entrepreneur Susana Santamaría, invested about $1 million to purchase 13 locations from the Colorado-based corporation. That transaction, which secured the Blockbuster operation in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, markedly whittled down the chain’s presence from the 40 stores it had at the height of its success. By this point the chain had already closed stores in Hato Rey, Isla Verde, Plaza del Norte in San Juan, Fajardo, Mayagüez, and Aguadilla. The closings of local Blockbuster locations in Puerto Rico and the USVI mirrored what has been taking place stateside, where parent company Dish Network had announced that January that it planned to shutter 300 stores across the U.S. &quot;soon.&quot; By June 20, 2013, it was reported that after almost four years of having acquired the Blockbuster store chain in Puerto Rico, Susana Santamaría would be closing the following month the last stores that were still open.

<text>Lot (; [ɔl]) is a department in the Occitanie region of France. Named after the Lot River, it lies in the southwestern part of the country and had a population of 174,094 in 2019. Its prefecture is Cahors; its subprefectures are Figeac and Gourdon.

== History ==
Lot is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was created from part of the province of Quercy. In 1808 some of the original southeastern cantons were separated from it to form the department of Tarn-et-Garonne. It originally extended much farther to the south and included the city of Montauban.

== Geography ==

Lot is part of the region of Occitanie and is surrounded by the departments of Corrèze, Cantal, Aveyron, Tarn-et-Garonne, Lot-et-Garonne and Dordogne. It is named after the river Lot, which in its Occitan name is &quot;Olt&quot;.

Cahors is the prefecture of the department, lying in its southwestern part: a medieval cathedral town known internationally for its production of Cahors wine, it lies in a wide loop of the Lot River and is famous for its 14th-century bridge, the Pont Valentré. Figeac is a medieval town where Jean-François Champollion, the first translator of Egyptian hieroglyphics, was born, situated in the eastern part of Lot. Gourdon, a medieval hilltop town located in Lot&#x27;s northwestern part, with a well preserved centre, comprises many prehistoric painted caves nearby, notably the Grottes de Cougnac.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Cahors, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are seven communes with more than 3,000 inhabitants:

<doc id="87585" wikidata="Q158629" url="?curid=87585" title="David Irving">
<text>David John Cawdell Irving (born 24 March 1938) is an English author who has written on the military and political history of World War II, especially Nazi Germany. He was found to be a Holocaust denier in a UK court in 2000 as a result of a failed libel case.

Irving&#x27;s works include &quot;The Destruction of Dresden&quot; (1963), &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot; (1977), &quot;Churchill&#x27;s War&quot; (1987) and &quot;Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich&quot; (1996). In his works, he argued that Adolf Hitler did not know of the extermination of Jews, or, if he did, he opposed it. Though Irving&#x27;s negationist claims and views of German war crimes in World War II (and Hitler&#x27;s responsibility for them) were never taken seriously by mainstream historians, he was once recognised for his knowledge of Nazi Germany and his ability to unearth new historical documents, which he held closely but stated were fully supportive of his conclusions. His 1964 book &quot;The Mare&#x27;s Nest&quot; about Germany&#x27;s V-weapons campaign of 1944–45 was praised for its deep research but criticised for minimising Nazi slave labour programmes.

By the late 1980s, Irving had placed himself outside the mainstream of the study of history, and had begun to turn to further extremes, possibly influenced by the 1988 trial of Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel. That trial, and his reading of the pseudoscientific Leuchter report, led him to openly espouse Holocaust denial, specifically denying that Jews were murdered by gassing at the Auschwitz concentration camp.

Irving&#x27;s reputation as a historian was further discredited in 2000, when, in the course of an unsuccessful libel case he filed against the American historian Deborah Lipstadt and Penguin Books, High Court Judge Charles Gray determined in his ruling that Irving willfully misrepresented historical evidence to promote Holocaust denial and whitewash the Nazis, a view shared by many prominent historians. The English court found that Irving was an active Holocaust denier, antisemite and racist, who &quot;for his own ideological reasons persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence&quot;. In addition, the court found that Irving&#x27;s books had distorted the history of Hitler&#x27;s role in the Holocaust to depict Hitler in a favourable light.

==Early life==
David Irving and his twin brother Nicholas were born six months before the start of the undeclared German–Czechoslovak War, as Nazi Germany moved towards its opening of World War II. The family lived in Hutton, near Brentwood, Essex, England. They had a brother, John, and a sister, Jennifer. Their father, John James Cawdell Irving (1898–1967), was a career naval officer and a commander in the Royal Navy. Their mother, Beryl Irving (&quot;née&quot; Newington), was an illustrator and a writer of children&#x27;s books.

During World War II, Irving&#x27;s father was an officer aboard the light cruiser HMS &quot;Edinburgh&quot;. On 30 April 1942, while escorting Convoy QP 11 in the Barents Sea, the ship was badly damaged by the German submarine U-456. Two days later, the ship was attacked by the German destroyers , and , and now beyond recovery was abandoned and scuttled by a torpedo from HMS &quot;Foresight&quot;. Irving&#x27;s father survived but severed all links with his wife and children after the incident.

Irving described his childhood in an interview with the American writer Ron Rosenbaum as: &quot;Unlike the Americans, we English suffered great deprivations ... we went through childhood with no toys. We had no kind of childhood at all. We were living on an island that was crowded with other people&#x27;s armies&quot;. According to his brother, Nicholas, David has been a provocateur and prankster since his youth. Nicholas Irving has said that &quot;David used to run toward bombed out houses shouting &#x27;Heil Hitler!, a statement which Irving denies.

Irving went on to say to Rosenbaum that his negationist views about World War II dated to his childhood, particularly due to his objections to the way Adolf Hitler was portrayed in the British media during the war. Irving asserted that his sceptical views about the Third Reich were rooted in his doubts about the cartoonist caricatures of Hitler and the other Nazi leaders published in the British wartime press.

==Student years==
After completing A levels at Brentwood School, Irving studied for a physics degree at Imperial College London, leaving after the first year. He did not complete the course because of financial constraints.

Irving later studied for two years toward a degree in Economics in the department of Political Economy at University College London. He again had to drop out due to lack of funds. During this period at university, he participated in a debate on Commonwealth immigration, seconding British Union of Fascists founder Sir Oswald Mosley.

===&quot;Carnival Times&quot; article===
Irving&#x27;s time as an editor of the &quot;Carnival Times&quot;, a student rag mag of the University of London Carnival Committee, became controversial in 1959 when he added a &quot;secret supplement&quot; to the magazine. This supplement contained an article in which he called Hitler the &quot;greatest unifying force Europe has known since Charlemagne&quot;. Although Irving deflected criticism by characterising the &quot;Carnival Times&quot; as &quot;satirical&quot;, he also stated that &quot;the formation of a European Union is interpreted as building a group of superior peoples, and the Jews have always viewed with suspicion the emergence of any &#x27;master-race&#x27; (other than their own, of course)&quot;. Opponents also viewed a cartoon included in the supplement as racist and criticised another article in which Irving wrote that the British press was owned by Jews. Volunteers were later recruited to remove and destroy the supplements before the magazine&#x27;s distribution. Irving has said that the criticism is &quot;probably justifiable&quot; and has described his motivation in producing the controversial secret issue of &quot;Carnival Times&quot; as being to prevent the &quot;Carnival&quot; from making a profit that would be passed on to a South African group which he considered a &quot;subversive organisation&quot;.

==&quot;The Destruction of Dresden&quot;==
Irving tried to join the Royal Air Force but was deemed to be medically unfit.

After serving in 1959 as editor of the University of London Carnival Committee&#x27;s journal, instead of doing national service, Irving left for West Germany, where he worked as a steelworker in a Thyssen AG steel works in the Ruhr area and learned the German language. He then moved to Spain, where he worked as a clerk at an air base.

By 1962, Irving was engaged to write a series of 37 articles on the Allied bombing campaign, &quot;Und Deutschlands Städte starben nicht&quot; (&quot;And Germany&#x27;s Cities Did Not Die&quot;), for the German boulevard journal &quot;Neue Illustrierte&quot;. These were the basis for his first book, &quot;The Destruction of Dresden&quot; (1963), in which he examined the Allied bombing of Dresden in February 1945. By the 1960s, a debate about the morality of the carpet bombing of German cities and civilian population had already begun, especially in the United Kingdom. There was consequently considerable interest in Irving&#x27;s book, which was illustrated with graphic pictures, and it became an international best-seller.

In the first edition, Irving&#x27;s estimates for deaths in Dresden were between 100,000 and 250,000 – notably higher than most previously published figures. These figures became widely accepted in many standard reference works. In later editions of the book over the next three decades, he gradually adjusted the figure downwards to 50,000–100,000. According to Richard J. Evans at the 2000 libel trial that Irving brought against Deborah Lipstadt, Irving based his estimates of the dead of Dresden on the word of one individual who provided no supporting documentation, used a document forged by the Nazis, and described one witness who was a urologist as Dresden&#x27;s Deputy Chief Medical Officer. The doctor later complained about being misidentified by Irving, and further, that he, the doctor, was only repeating rumours about the death toll. According to an investigation by Dresden City Council in 2008, casualties at Dresden were estimated as 22,700–25,000 dead.

Irving had based his numbers on what purported to be &quot;Tagesbefehl 47&quot; (&quot;Daily Order 47&quot;, TB 47), a document promulgated by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, and on claims made after the war by a former Dresden Nazi functionary, Hans Voigt, without verifying them against official sources available in Dresden. Irving&#x27;s estimates and sources were first disputed by Walter Weidauer, Mayor of Dresden 1946–1958, in his own account of the Dresden bombing. When it was later confirmed that the TB 47 used was a forgery, Irving published a letter to the editor in &quot;The Times&quot; on 7 July 1966 retracting his estimates, writing that he had &quot;no interest in promoting or perpetuating false legends&quot;. In 1977, the real document TB 47 was located in Dresden by Götz Bergander.

Despite acknowledging that the copy of &quot;TB 47&quot; he had used was inaccurate, Irving argued during the late 1980s and 1990s that the death toll at Dresden was much higher than the accepted estimates: in several speeches during this period, he said that 100,000 or more people had been killed in the bombing of Dresden. In some of the speeches Irving also argued or implied that the raid was comparable to the Nazis&#x27; killing of Jews.

===1963 burglary of Irving&#x27;s flat===
In November 1963, Irving called the Metropolitan Police with suspicions he had been the victim of a burglary by three men who had gained access to his Hornsey flat in London by claiming to be General Post Office engineers. Anti-fascist activist Gerry Gable was convicted in January 1964, along with Manny Carpel. They were fined £20 each.

==Subsequent works==
After the success of the Dresden book, Irving continued writing, including some works of negationist history, although his 1964 work &quot;The Mare&#x27;s Nest&quot; – an account of the German V-weapons programme and the Allied intelligence countermeasures against it – was widely praised when published and continues to be well regarded. Michael J. Neufeld of the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum has described &quot;The Mare&#x27;s Nest&quot; as &quot;the most complete account on both Allied and German sides of the V-weapons campaign in the last two years of the war.&quot;

Irving translated the &quot;Memoirs&quot; of Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel in 1965 (edited by Walter Görlitz) and in 1967 published &quot;Accident: The Death of General Sikorski&quot;. In the latter book, Irving claimed that the plane crash which killed Polish government in exile leader General Władysław Sikorski in 1943 was really an assassination ordered by Winston Churchill, so as to enable Churchill to betray Poland to the Soviet Union. Irving&#x27;s book inspired the highly controversial 1967 play &quot;Soldiers&quot; by his friend, the German playwright Rolf Hochhuth, where Hochhuth depicts Churchill ordering the assassination of General Sikorski.

Also in 1967, Irving published two more works: &quot;The Virus House&quot;, an account of the German nuclear energy project for which Irving conducted many interviews, and &quot;The Destruction of Convoy PQ-17,&quot; in which he blamed British escort group commander Commander Jack Broome for the catastrophic losses of the Convoy PQ 17. Amid much publicity, Broome sued Irving for libel in October 1968, and in February 1970, after a 17-day-trial before London&#x27;s High Court, Broome won. Irving was forced to pay £40,000 in damages, and the book was withdrawn from circulation.

After &quot;PQ-17&quot;, Irving largely shifted to writing biographies. In 1968, he published &quot;Breach of Security&quot;, an account of German reading of messages to and from the British Embassy in Berlin before 1939 with an introduction by the British historian Donald Cameron Watt. As a result of Irving&#x27;s success with &quot;Dresden&quot;, members of Germany&#x27;s extreme right wing assisted him in contacting surviving members of Hitler&#x27;s inner circle. In an interview with the American journalist Ron Rosenbaum, Irving claimed to have developed sympathies towards them. Many ageing former mid- and high-ranked Nazis saw a potential friend in Irving and donated diaries and other material. Irving described his historical work to Rosenbaum as an act of &quot;stone-cleaning&quot; of Hitler, in which he cleared off the &quot;slime&quot; that he felt had been unjustly applied to Hitler&#x27;s reputation.

In 1969, during a visit to Germany, Irving met Robert Kempner, one of the American prosecutors at the Nuremberg trials. Irving asked Kempner if the &quot;official record of the Nuremberg Trials was falsified&quot;, and told him that he was planning to go to Washington, D.C., to compare the sound recordings of Luftwaffe Field-Marshal Erhard Milch&#x27;s March 1946 evidence with the subsequently published texts to find proof that evidence given at Nuremberg was &quot;tampered with and manipulated&quot;. Upon his return to the United States, Kempner wrote to J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the FBI, that Irving expressed many &quot;anti-American and anti-Jewish statements&quot;.

In 1971, Irving translated the memoirs of General Reinhard Gehlen, and in 1973 published &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Luftwaffe&quot;, a biography of Field Marshal Milch. He spent the remainder of the 1970s working on &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot; and &quot;The War Path&quot;, his two-part biography of Adolf Hitler; &quot;The Trail of the Fox,&quot; a biography of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel; and a series in the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; describing the Royal Air Force&#x27;s famous Dam Busters raid. In 1975, in his introduction to &quot;Hitler und seine Feldherren&quot;, the German edition of &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot;, Irving attacked Anne Frank&#x27;s diary as a forgery, claiming falsely that a New York court had ruled that the diary was really the work of American scriptwriter Meyer Levin &quot;in collaboration with the girl&#x27;s father&quot;.

==Revisionism==

===&quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot;===
In 1977, Irving published &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot;, the first of his two-part biography of Adolf Hitler. Irving&#x27;s intention in &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot; was to clean away the &quot;years of grime and discoloration from the facade of a silent and forbidding monument&quot; to reveal the real Hitler, whose reputation Irving argued had been slandered by historians. In &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot;, Irving tried to &quot;view the situation as far as possible through Hitler&#x27;s eyes, from behind his desk&quot;. He portrayed Hitler as a rational, intelligent politician, whose only goal was to increase Germany&#x27;s prosperity and influence on the continent, and who was constantly let down by incompetent or treasonous subordinates. Irving&#x27;s book faulted the Allied leaders, especially Winston Churchill, for the eventual escalation of war, and argued that the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 was a &quot;preventive war&quot; forced on Hitler to avert an impending Soviet attack. Irving also argued that Hitler had no knowledge of the Holocaust: while not denying its occurrence, he argued that SS leader Heinrich Himmler and his deputy Reinhard Heydrich were its originators and architects. Irving made much of the lack of any written order from Hitler ordering the Holocaust; he offered to pay £1,000 to anyone who could find such an order. , his offer still stood.

In &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot;, Irving quoted a 1942 memorandum by Hans Lammers, the Chief of the Reich Chancellery, to the Reich Justice Minister Franz Schlegelberger, saying: &quot;the Führer has repeatedly pronounced that he wants the solution of the Jewish Question put off until after the war is over&quot;. Irving took this as proof that Hitler ordered against the extermination of the Jews. He falsely claimed that &quot;no other historians have quoted this document, possibly finding its content hard to reconcile with their obsessively held views&quot; about Hitler&#x27;s responsibility for the Holocaust. However, the interpretation of the document is not as simple as Irving made it out to be in his book. The memorandum has no date and no signature on it, although historians estimate that it was issued at some point between 1941 and 1942 by looking at the other documents where the memorandum is located. They have concluded that the memorandum was more than likely from late 1941 when Hitler was still advocating the expulsion of the Jews, rather than later when he advocated their extermination.

Critical reaction to &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot; was generally negative. Reviewers took issue with Irving&#x27;s factual claims as well as his conclusions. For example, American historian Charles W. Sydnor Jr. noted numerous errors, such as Irving&#x27;s unreferenced statement that the Jews who fought in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943 were well supplied with weapons from Germany&#x27;s allies. Sydnor pointed out that Hitler had received an SS report in November 1942 which contained a mention of 363,211 Russian Jews executed by the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; between August and November 1942. Sydnor remarked that Irving&#x27;s statement that the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were in charge in the death camps seems to indicate that he was not familiar with the history of the Holocaust, as the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were in fact mobile death squads who had nothing to do with the death camps.

===Irving&#x27;s work in the late 1970s and early 1980s===
Months after the release of &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot;, Irving published &quot;The Trail of the Fox&quot;, a biography of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. In it, Irving attacked the members of the 20 July Plot to assassinate Hitler, branding them &quot;traitors&quot;, &quot;cowards&quot;, and &quot;manipulators&quot;, and uncritically presented Hitler and his government&#x27;s subsequent revenge against the plotters, of which Rommel was also a victim. In particular, Irving accused Rommel&#x27;s friend and Chief of Staff General Hans Speidel of framing Rommel in the attempted coup. The British historian David Pryce-Jones in a book review of &quot;The Trail of the Fox&quot; in the edition of 12 November 1977 of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; accused Irving of taking everything Hitler had to say at face value.

In 1978, Irving released &quot;The War Path&quot;, the companion volume to &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot; which covered events leading up to the war and which was written from a similar point of view. Again, professional historians such as Donald Cameron Watt noted numerous inaccuracies and misrepresentations. Despite the criticism, the book sold well, as did all of Irving&#x27;s books up to that date. The success of his books enabled Irving to buy a home in the prestigious Mayfair district of London, own a Rolls-Royce car and enjoy an affluent lifestyle. In addition, Irving, despite being married, became increasingly open about his affairs with other women, all of which were detailed in his self-published diary. Irving&#x27;s affairs caused his first marriage to end in divorce in 1981.

In the 1980s, Irving started researching and writing about topics other than Nazi Germany, but with less success. He began his research on his three-part biography of Winston Churchill. After publication Irving&#x27;s work on Churchill received at least one bad review from Professor David Cannadine (then of the University of London):

In 1981, he published two books. The first was &quot;The War Between the Generals&quot;, in which Irving offered an account of the Allied High Command on the Western Front in 1944–45, detailing the heated conflicts Irving alleges occurred between the various generals of the various countries and presenting rumours about their private lives. The second book was &quot;Uprising!&quot;, about the 1956 revolt in Hungary, which Irving characterised as &quot;primarily an anti-Jewish uprising&quot;, supposedly because the Communist regime was itself controlled by Jews. Irving&#x27;s depiction of Hungary&#x27;s Communist regime as a Jewish dictatorship oppressing Gentiles sparked charges of antisemitism. In addition, there were complaints that Irving had grossly exaggerated the number of people of Jewish origin in the Communist regime and had ignored the fact that Hungarian Communists who did have a Jewish background like Mátyás Rákosi and Ernő Gerő had totally repudiated Judaism and sometimes expressed antisemitic attitudes themselves. Critics such as Neal Ascherson and Kai Bird took issue with some of Irving&#x27;s language that seemed to evoke antisemitic imagery, such as his remark that Rákosi possessed &quot;the tact of a kosher butcher&quot;.

In 1982, Irving described himself as an &quot;untrained historian&quot; and argued that his lack of academic qualifications did not mean that he could not be considered a historian. He listed Pliny the Elder and Tacitus as examples of historians without university training.

===Hitler Diaries===
In 1983, &quot;Stern&quot;, a weekly German news magazine, purchased 61 volumes of Hitler&#x27;s supposed diaries for DM 9 million and published excerpts from them. Irving played a major role in exposing the Hitler Diaries as a hoax. In October 1982 Irving had purchased from the same source as &quot;Stern&quot;&#x27;s 1983 purchase, 800 pages of documents relating to Hitler, only to conclude that many of the documents were forgeries. Irving was amongst the first to identify the diaries as forgeries, and to draw media attention. He went so far as to crash the press conference held by Hugh Trevor-Roper at the Hamburg offices of &quot;Stern&quot; magazine on 25 April 1983 to denounce the diaries as a forgery and Trevor-Roper for endorsing the diaries as genuine. Irving&#x27;s performance at the &quot;Stern&quot; press conference where he violently harangued Trevor-Roper until ejected by security led him to be featured prominently on the news: the next day, Irving appeared on the &quot;Today&quot; television show as a featured guest. Irving had concluded that the alleged Hitler diaries were a forgery because they had come from the same dealer in Nazi memorabilia from whom Irving had purchased his collection in 1982. At the press conference in Hamburg, Irving said, &quot;I know the collection from which these diaries come. It is an old collection, full of forgeries. I have some here&quot;. Irving was proud to have detected and denounced the hoax material and of the &quot;trail of chaos&quot; he had created at the Hamburg press conference and the attendant publicity it had brought him, and took pride in his humiliation of Trevor-Roper, whom Irving strongly disliked for his sloppy work, in not detecting the hoax, and past criticism of Irving&#x27;s methods and conclusions. Irving also noted internal inconsistencies in the supposed Hitler diaries, such as a diary entry for 20 July 1944, which would have been unlikely given that Hitler&#x27;s right hand had been badly burned by the bomb planted in his headquarters by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg earlier that day.

A week later, on 2 May, Irving asserted that many of the diary documents appeared to be genuine: at the same press conference, Irving took the opportunity to promote his translation of the memoirs of Hitler&#x27;s physician Theodor Morell. Robert Harris, in his book &quot;Selling Hitler&quot;, suggested that an additional reason for Irving&#x27;s change of mind over the authenticity of the alleged Hitler diaries was that the fake diaries contain no reference to the Holocaust, thereby buttressing Irving&#x27;s claim in &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot; that Hitler had no knowledge of it. Subsequently, Irving conformed when the diaries were declared a forgery by consensus. At a press conference held to withdraw his endorsement of the diaries, Irving proudly claimed that he was the first to call them a forgery, to which a reporter replied that he was also the last to call them genuine.

===Other books===
By the mid-1980s, Irving had not had a successful book for some years and was behind schedule in writing the first volume of his Churchill series, the research for which had strained his finances. He finished the manuscript in 1985, and the book was published in 1987, as &quot;Churchill&#x27;s War, The Struggle for Power&quot;.

In 1989, Irving published his biography of Hermann Göring.

==Holocaust denial==
===Movement towards Holocaust denial===
Over the years, Irving&#x27;s stance on the Holocaust has changed significantly. Since at least the 1970s, he has either questioned or denied Hitler&#x27;s involvement in the Holocaust and whether or not the Nazis had a plan to exterminate the Jews of Europe.

Irving always denied Hitler was antisemitic, even before he openly denied the Holocaust. Irving claimed Hitler only used antisemitism as a political platform, and that after he came to power in 1933 he lost interest in it, while Joseph Goebbels and other Nazis continued to espouse antisemitism. In 1977 on a BBC1 television programme, he said that Hitler &quot;became a statesman and then a soldier ... and the Jewish problem was a nuisance to him, an embarrassment.&quot; In 1983, Irving summarised his views about Hitler and the Jews when he said that &quot;probably the biggest friend the Jews had in the Third Reich, certainly when the war broke out, was Adolf Hitler. He was the one who was doing everything he could to prevent things nasty happening to them.&quot; In the same year, he further declared about Hitler and the mass killing of Jews, &quot;There is a whole chain of evidence from 1938 right through to October 1943, possibly even later, indicating that Hitler was completely in the dark about anything that may have been going on.&quot; Irving boasted that he had not been disproved.

In his first edition of &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot; in 1977, Irving argued that Hitler was against the killings of the Jews in the East. He claimed that Hitler even ordered a stop to the extermination of Jews in November 1941; British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper noted that this admission blatantly contradicted Irving&#x27;s claim that Hitler was ignorant about what was happening to Jews in Eastern Europe. On 30 November 1941, Heinrich Himmler went to the Wolf&#x27;s Lair for a private conference with Hitler and during it the fate of some Berlin Jews was mentioned. At 1.30 pm, Himmler was instructed to tell Reinhard Heydrich that the Jews were not to be liquidated. Irving falsely claimed that Himmler telephoned SS General Oswald Pohl, the overall chief of the concentration camp system, with the order: &quot;Jews are to stay where they are&quot; (Himmler actually referred to &quot;administrative leaders of the SS&quot; needing to stay where they were). Irving argued that &quot;No liquidation&quot; (&quot;Keine Liquidierung&quot;) was &quot;incontrovertible evidence&quot; that Hitler ordered that no Jews were to be killed. However, although the telephone log is genuine, it provides no evidence that Hitler was involved at all, only that Himmler contacted Heydrich and there is no evidence that Hitler and Himmler were in contact before the phone call. This is an example of Irving&#x27;s manipulation of documents since there was no general order to stop the killing of Jews. Historian Eberhard Jäckel wrote that Irving &quot;only ever sees and collects what fits his story, and even now he will not let himself be dissuaded from understanding what he wants to by the phrase &#x27;postponement of the Jewish question&#x27;.&quot;

In June 1977, British television host David Frost aired a debate. During the debate, Irving argued that there was no evidence Hitler even knew about the Holocaust. Frost asked Irving whether or not he thought Hitler was evil, he replied, &quot;He was as evil as Churchill, as evil as Roosevelt, as evil as Truman&quot;.

From 1988, Irving started to espouse Holocaust denial openly: he had previously not denied the Holocaust outright, and for this reason many Holocaust deniers were ambivalent about him. They admired Irving for the pro-Nazi slant in his work and the fact that he possessed a degree of mainstream credibility that they lacked, but were annoyed that he did not openly deny the Holocaust. In 1980, Lucy Dawidowicz noted that, although &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot; was strongly sympathetic to the Third Reich, because Irving argued that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust as opposed to denying the Holocaust happened at all, his book was not part of the &quot;anti-Semitic canon&quot;. In 1980, Irving received an invitation to speak at a Holocaust-denial conference, which he refused on the grounds that his appearance there would damage his reputation. In a letter, Irving stated his reasons for his refusal as: &quot;This is pure &quot;Realpolitik&quot; on my part. I am already dangerously exposed, and I cannot take the chance of being caught in flak meant for others!&quot; Though Irving refused at this time to appear at conferences sponsored by the Holocaust-denying Institute for Historical Review (IHR), he did grant the institute the right to distribute his books in the United States. Robert Jan van Pelt suggests that the major reason for Irving wishing to keep his distance from Holocaust deniers in the early 1980s was his desire to found his own political party called Focus.

In a footnote in the first edition of &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot;, Irving writes, &quot;I cannot accept the view ... [that] there exists no document signed by Hitler, Himmler or Heydrich speaking of the extermination of the Jews&quot;. In 1982, Irving temporarily stopped writing and made an attempt to unify all of the various far-right splinter groups in Britain into one party called Focus, in which he would play a leading role. Irving described himself as a &quot;moderate fascist&quot; and spoke of plans to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but his efforts to move into politics, which he regarded at the time as very important, failed due to fiscal problems. Irving told the &quot;Oxford Mail&quot; of having &quot;links at a low level&quot; with the National Front (NF). Irving described &quot;The Spotlight&quot;, the main journal of the Liberty Lobby, as &quot;an excellent fortnightly paper&quot;. At the same time, Irving put a copy of Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Prophecy Speech&quot; of 30 January 1939, promising the &quot;annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe&quot; if &quot;Jewish financiers&quot; started another world war, onto his wall.

Following the failure of Focus, in September 1983, Irving for the first time attended a conference of the IHR. Van Pelt has argued that, with the failure of Irving&#x27;s political career, he felt freer to associate with Holocaust deniers. At the conference, Irving did not deny the Holocaust, but did appear happy to share the stage with Robert Faurisson and Judge Wilhelm Stäglich, and claimed to be impressed with the pseudoscientific allegations of neo-Nazi and Holocaust denier Friedrich &quot;Fritz&quot; Berg that mass murder using diesel gas fumes at the Operation Reinhard death camps was impossible. At that conference, Irving repeated his claims that Hitler was ignorant of the Holocaust because he was &quot;so busy being a soldier&quot;. In a speech at that conference, Irving stated: &quot;Isn&#x27;t it right for Tel Aviv to claim now that David Irving is talking nonsense and &quot;of course&quot; Adolf Hitler must have known about what was going in Auschwitz and Treblinka, and then in the same breath to claim that, &quot;of course&quot; our beloved Mr. Begin didn&#x27;t know what was going on in Sabra and Chatilla&quot;. During the same speech, Irving proclaimed Hitler to be the &quot;biggest friend the Jews had in the Third Reich&quot;. In the same speech, Irving stated that he operated in such a way as to bring himself maximum publicity. Irving stated that: &quot;I have at home... a filing cabinet full of documents which I don&#x27;t issue all at once. I keep them: I issue them a bit at a time. When I think my name hasn&#x27;t been in the newspapers for several weeks, well, then I ring them up and I phone them and I say: &#x27;What about this one, then?

A major theme of Irving&#x27;s writings from the 1980s was his belief that it had been a great blunder on the part of Britain to declare war on Germany in 1939, and that ever since then and as a result of that decision, Britain had slipped into an unstoppable decline. Irving also took the view that Hitler often tried to help the Jews of Europe. In a June 1992 interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Irving claimed to have heard from Hitler&#x27;s naval adjutant that the &quot;Führer&quot; had told him that he could not marry because Germany was &quot;his bride&quot;. Irving then claimed to have asked the naval adjutant when Hitler made that remark, and upon hearing that the date was 24 March 1938, Irving stated in response &quot;Herr Admiral, at that moment I was being born&quot;. Irving used this alleged incident to argue that there was some sort of mystical connection between himself and Hitler.

In a 1986 speech in Australia, Irving argued that photographs of Holocaust survivors and dead taken in early 1945 by Allied soldiers were proof that the Allies were responsible for the Holocaust, not the Germans. Irving claimed that the Holocaust was not the work of Nazi leaders, but rather of &quot;nameless criminals&quot;, and claimed that &quot;these men [who killed the Jews] acted on their own impulse, their own initiative, within the general atmosphere of brutality created by the Second World War, in which of course Allied bombings played a part.&quot; In another 1986 speech, this time in Atlanta, Irving claimed that &quot;historians have a blindness when it comes to the Holocaust because like Tay–Sachs disease it is a Jewish disease which causes blindness&quot;. In 1986, he told reporters in Brisbane, Australia, without explaining how the Allied bombing raids on Germany had made non-Germans to be antisemitic that:
By the mid-1980s, Irving associated himself with the IHR, began giving lectures to groups such as the far-right German Deutsche Volksunion (DVU), and publicly denied that the Nazis systematically exterminated Jews in gas chambers during World War II. Irving in his revised edition of &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot; in 1991 removed all mentions of &quot;gas chambers&quot; and the word &quot;Holocaust&quot;. He defended the revisions by stating, &quot;You won&#x27;t find the Holocaust mentioned in one line, not even in a footnote, why should [you]. If something didn&#x27;t happen, then you don&#x27;t even dignify it with a footnote.&quot;

Irving was present at a memorial service for Hans-Ulrich Rudel in January 1983 after the latter&#x27;s death, organised by the DVU and its leader Gerhard Frey, delivering a speech, and was given the Hans-Ulrich-Rudel-Award by Frey in June 1985. Irving was a frequent speaker for the DVU in the 1980s and the early 1990s, but the relationship ended in 1993 apparently because of concerns by the DVU that Irving&#x27;s espousal of Holocaust denial might lead to the DVU being banned.

In 1986, Irving visited Toronto, where he was met at an airport by Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel. According to Zündel, Irving &quot;thought I was &#x27;Revisionist-Neo-Nazi-Rambo-Kook!, and asked Zündel to stay away from him. Zündel and his supporters obliged Irving by staying away from his lecture tour, which consequently attracted little media attention, and was considered by Irving to be a failure. Afterwards, Zündel sent Irving a long letter in which he offered to draw publicity to Irving, and so ensure that his future speaking tours would be a success. As a result, Irving and Zündel became friends, and Irving agreed in late 1987 to testify for Zündel at his second trial for denying the Holocaust. In addition, the publication in 1987 of the book &quot;Der europäische Bürgerkrieg 1917–1945&quot; by Ernst Nolte, in which Nolte flirted with Holocaust denial as a serious argument, encouraged Irving to become more open in associating with Zündel.

In 1988, Irving argued that the Nazi state was not responsible for the extermination of the Jews in places like Minsk, Kiev and Riga because according to him they were carried out for the most part by &quot;individual gangsters and criminals&quot;.

In 1989, Irving during a speech told an audience that &quot;there is not one shower bath in any of the concentration or slave labour camps that turns out to have been some kind of gas chamber.&quot; He described Jewish Holocaust survivors as &quot;liars, psychiatric cases and extortionists.&quot; In 1990, Irving said on 5 March that there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz and that &quot;30,000 people at the most were murdered in Auschwitz ... that&#x27;s about as many as we Englishmen killed in a single night in Hamburg.&quot; He reiterated his claim that there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz on 5 March 1990 to an audience in Germany:

During the same speech, he said, &quot;I and, increasingly, other historians ... are saying, the Holocaust, the gas chamber establishments in Auschwitz did not exist.&quot; Later on in the same year, Irving told an audience in Toronto, &quot;The gas chambers that are shown to the tourists in Auschwitz are fakes.&quot;

Irving denied that the Nazis gassed any Jews or other people, with the exception of admitting that a small number of people were gassed during experiments.

In 1990, Irving told an audience in Canada that &quot;particularly when there&#x27;s money involved and they can get a good compensation cash payment out of it&quot; there would be people claiming to be eyewitnesses to gas chambers or extermination camps. He continued:

In 1991, Irving espoused an antisemitic conspiracy theory when he stated that the Jews &quot;dragged us into two world wars and now, for equally mysterious reasons, they&#x27;re trying to drag us into the Balkans.&quot;

In 1995, when Irving was confronted with a Holocaust survivor, he repeated the same claim and asked, &quot;How much money have you made from that piece of ink on your arm, which may indeed be real tattooed ink? Yes. Half a million dollars, three-quarters of a million for you alone?&quot;

On 6 October 1995, Irving told an audience in Tampa, Florida, that he agreed with the Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels that the Jews &quot;had it coming for them&quot;. He continued:

Thus, according to Irving, the Jews brought the Holocaust on themselves.

===Ernst Zündel trial===

In January 1988, Irving travelled to Toronto, Ontario, to assist Douglas Christie, the defence lawyer for Ernst Zündel at his second trial for denying the Holocaust. Working closely with Robert Faurisson, who was also assisting the defence, Irving contacted Warden Bill Armontrout of the Missouri State Penitentiary who recommended that Irving and Faurisson get into touch with Fred A. Leuchter, a self-described execution expert living in Boston. Irving and Faurisson then flew to Boston to meet with Leuchter, who agreed to lend his alleged technical expertise on the behalf of Zündel&#x27;s defence. Irving argued that an alleged expert on gassings like Leuchter could prove that the Holocaust was a &quot;myth&quot;. After work on the second Zündel trial, Irving declared that based on his exposure to Zündel&#x27;s and Leuchter&#x27;s theories that he was now conducting a &quot;one-man &quot;&quot;&quot; against the idea that there had been a Holocaust. Subsequently, Irving claimed to the American journalist D. D. Guttenplan in a 1999 interview that Zündel had convinced him that the Holocaust had not occurred.
In the 1988 Zündel trial, Irving repeated and defended his claim from &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot; that until October 1943 Hitler knew nothing about the actual implementation of the Final Solution. He also expressed his evolving belief that the Final Solution involved &quot;atrocities&quot;, not systematic murder: &quot;I don&#x27;t think there was any overall &quot;Reich&quot; policy to kill the Jews. If there was, they would have been killed and there would not be now so many millions of survivors. And believe me, I am glad for every survivor that there was.&quot; Similarly, Irving disputed the common held view among historians that the Wannsee Conference meeting on 20 January 1942 was when the extermination of Jews in the near future or later was discussed, he argued:
Between 22 and 26 April 1988, Irving testified for Zündel, endorsing Richard Harwood&#x27;s book &quot;Did Six Million Really Die?&quot; as &quot;over ninety percent ... factually accurate&quot;.

As to what evidence further led Irving to believe that the Holocaust never occurred, he cited &quot;The Leuchter report&quot; by Fred A. Leuchter, which claimed there was no evidence for the existence of homicidal gas chambers at the Auschwitz concentration camp. Irving said in a 1999 documentary about Leuchter: &quot;The big point [of the Leuchter report]: there is no significant residue of cyanide in the brickwork. That&#x27;s what converted me. When I read that in the report in the courtroom in Toronto, I became a hard-core disbeliever&quot;. In addition, Irving was influenced to embrace Holocaust denial by the American historian Arno J. Mayer&#x27;s 1988 book &quot;Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?&quot;, which did not deny the Holocaust, but claimed that most of those who died at Auschwitz were killed by disease: Irving saw in Mayer&#x27;s book an apparent confirmation of Leuchter&#x27;s and Zündel&#x27;s theories about no mass murder at Auschwitz.

After the trial, Irving published Leuchter&#x27;s report as &quot;Auschwitz, The End of the Line: The Leuchter Report&quot; in the United Kingdom in 1989 and wrote its foreword. Leuchter&#x27;s book had been first published in Canada by Zündel&#x27;s Samisdat Publishers in 1988 as &quot;The Leuchter Report: The End of a Myth: An Engineering Report on the Alleged Execution Gas Chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau and Majdanek&quot;. In his foreword to the British edition of Leuchter&#x27;s book, Irving wrote that &quot;Nobody likes to be swindled, still less where considerable sums of money are involved&quot;. The alleged swindle was the reparations money totalling 3 billion DM paid by the Federal Republic of Germany to Israel between 1952 and 1966 for the Holocaust. Irving described the reparations as being &quot;essentially in atonement for the &#x27;gas chambers&#x27; of Auschwitz&quot;, which Irving called a &quot;myth&quot; that would &quot;not die easily&quot;. In his foreword, Irving praised the &quot;scrupulous methods&quot; and &quot;integrity&quot; of Leuchter.

For publishing and writing the foreword to &quot;Auschwitz The End of the Line&quot;, on 20 June 1989, Irving together with Leuchter was condemned in an Early Day Motion of the House of Commons as &quot;Hitler&#x27;s heirs&quot;. The motion went on to describe Irving as a &quot;Nazi propagandist and longtime Hitler apologist&quot; and &quot;Auschwitz The End of the Line&quot; as a &quot;fascist publication&quot;. In the Motion, the House stated that they were &quot;appalled by [the Holocaust denial of] Nazi propagandist and long-time Hitler apologist David Irving&quot;. In response to the House of Commons motion, Irving in a press statement challenged the MPs who voted to condemn him, writing that: &quot;I will enter the &#x27;gas chambers&#x27; of Auschwitz and you and your friends may lob in Zyklon B in accordance with the well known procedures and conditions. I guarantee that you won&#x27;t be satisfied with the results!&quot;

In a pamphlet Irving published in London on 23 June 1989, he made the &quot;epochal announcement&quot; that there was no mass murder in the gas chambers at the Auschwitz death camp. Irving labelled the gas chambers at Auschwitz a &quot;hoax&quot;, and writing in the third person declared that he &quot;has placed himself [Irving] at the head of a growing band of historians, worldwide, who are now sceptical of the claim that at Auschwitz and other camps were &#x27;factories of death&#x27;, in which millions of innocent people were systematically gassed to death&quot;. Boasting of his role in criticising the Hitler diaries as a forgery in 1983, Irving wrote &quot;now he [Irving] is saying the same thing about the infamous &#x27;gas chambers&#x27; of Auschwitz, Treblinka and Majdanek. They did not exist – ever – except perhaps as the brainchild of Britain&#x27;s brilliant wartime Psychological Warfare Executive&quot;. Finally, Irving claimed &quot;the survivors of Auschwitz are themselves testimony to the absence of an extermination programme&quot;. Echoing the criticism of the House of Commons, a leader in &quot;The Times&quot; on 14 May 1990 described Irving as a &quot;man for whom Hitler is something of a hero and almost everything of an innocent and for whom Auschwitz is a Jewish deception&quot;.

===Holocaust denial lecture circuit===
In the early 1990s, Irving was a frequent visitor to Germany, where he spoke at neo-Nazi rallies. The chief themes of Irving&#x27;s German speeches were that the Allies and Axis states were equally culpable for war crimes, that the decision of Neville Chamberlain to declare war on Germany in 1939, and that of Winston Churchill to continue the war in 1940, had been great mistakes that set Britain on a path of decline, and the Holocaust was just a &quot;propaganda exercise&quot;. In June 1990, Irving visited East Germany on a well-publicized tour entitled &quot;An Englishman Fights for the Honour of the Germans&quot;, on which he accused the Allies of having used &quot;forged documents&quot; to &quot;humiliate&quot; the German people. Irving&#x27;s self-proclaimed mission was to guide &quot;promising young men&quot; in Germany in the &quot;right direction&quot; (Irving has often stated his belief that women exist for a &quot;certain task, which is producing us [men]&quot;, and should be &quot;subservient to men&quot;: leading, in Lipstadt&#x27;s view, to a lack of interest on Irving&#x27;s part in guiding young German women in the &quot;right direction&quot;). German nationalists found Irving, as a non-German Holocaust denier, to be particularly credible.

In January 1990, Irving gave a speech in Moers where he asserted that only 30,000 people died at Auschwitz between 1940 and 1945, all of natural causes, which was equal—so he claimed—to the typical death toll from one Bomber Command raid on German cities. Irving claimed that there were no gas chambers at the death camp, stating that the existing remains were &quot;mock-ups built by the Poles&quot;. On 21 April 1990, Irving repeated the same speech in Munich, which led to his conviction for Holocaust denial in Munich on 11 July 1991. The court fined Irving DM 7,000 (equivalent to € in ). Irving appealed against the judgement, and received a fine of DM 10,000 (€ in ) for repeating the same remarks in the courtroom on 5 May 1992. During his appeal in 1992, Irving called upon those present in the Munich courtroom to &quot;fight a battle for the German people and put an end to the blood lie of the Holocaust which has been told against this country for fifty years&quot;. Irving went on to call the Auschwitz death camp a &quot;tourist attraction&quot; whose origins Irving claimed went back to an &quot;ingenious plan&quot; devised by the British Psychological Warfare Executive in 1942 to spread anti-German propaganda that it was the policy of the German state to be &quot;using &#x27;gas chambers&#x27; to kill millions of Jews and other undesirables&quot;. During the same speech, Irving denounced the judge as a &quot;senile, alcoholic cretin&quot;. Following his conviction for Holocaust denial, Irving was banned from visiting Germany.

Expanding upon his thesis in &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot; about the lack of a written &quot;Führer&quot; order for the Holocaust, Irving argued in the 1990s that the absence of such an order meant that there was no Holocaust. In a speech delivered in Toronto in November 1990 Irving claimed that Holocaust survivors had manufactured memories of their suffering because &quot;there&#x27;s money involved and they can get a good compensation cash payment out of it&quot;. In that speech, Irving used the metaphor of a cruise ship named Holocaust, which Irving claimed had &quot;luxury wall to wall fitted carpets and a crew of thousands ... marine terminals established in now virtually every capital in the world, disguised as Holocaust memorial museums&quot;. Irving went on to assert that the &quot;ship&quot; was due for rough sailing because recently the Soviet government had allowed historians access to &quot;the index cards of all the people who passed through the gates of Auschwitz&quot;, and claimed that this would lead to &quot;a lot of people [who] are not claiming to be Auschwitz survivors anymore&quot; (Irving&#x27;s statement about the index cards was incorrect: what the Soviet government had made available in 1990 were the death books of Auschwitz, recording the weekly death tolls). Irving claimed on the basis of what he called the index books that, &quot;Because the experts can look at a tattoo and say &#x27;Oh yes, 181, 219 that means you entered Auschwitz in March 1943 and he warned Auschwitz survivors &quot;If you want to go and have a tattoo put on your arm, as a lot of them do, I am afraid to say, and claim subsequently that you were in Auschwitz, you have to make sure a) that it fits in with the month you said you went to Auschwitz and b) it is not a number which anyone used before&quot;.

On 17 January 1991, Irving told a reporter from &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; that &quot;The Jews are very foolish not to abandon the gas chamber theory while they still have time&quot;. Irving went on to say that he believed antisemitism will increase all over the world because &quot;the Jews have exploited people with the gas chamber legend&quot; and that &quot;In ten years, Israel will cease to exist and the Jews will have to return to Europe&quot;. In his 1991 revised edition of &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot;, he had removed all references to death camps and the Holocaust. In a speech given in Hamburg in 1991, Irving stated that in two years&#x27; time &quot;this myth of mass murders of Jews in the death factories of Auschwitz, Majdanek and Treblinka ... which in fact never took place&quot; will be disproved (Auschwitz, Majdanek, and Treblinka were all well established as being extermination camps). Two days later, Irving repeated the same speech in Halle before a group of neo-Nazis, and praised Rudolf Hess as &quot;that great German martyr, Rudolf Hess&quot;. At another 1991 speech, this time in Canada, Irving called the Holocaust a &quot;hoax&quot;, and again predicted that by 1993 the &quot;hoax&quot; would have been &quot;exposed&quot;. In that speech, Irving declared, &quot;Gradually the word is getting around Germany. Two years from now too, the German historians will accept that we are right. They will accept that for fifty years they have believed a lie&quot;. During that speech given in October 1991, Irving expressed his contempt and hatred for Holocaust survivors by proclaiming that:

In another 1991 speech, this time in Regina, Irving called the Holocaust &quot;a major fraud... There were no gas chambers. They were fakes and frauds&quot;.

In November 1992, Irving was to be a featured speaker at a world anti-Zionist congress in Stockholm that was cancelled by the Swedish government. Also scheduled to attend were fellow Holocaust-deniers Robert Faurisson and Fred A. Leuchter, and Louis Farrakhan, together with representatives of the militant Palestinian group Hamas, the Lebanese militant Shiite group Hezbollah, and the right-wing Russian antisemitic group Pamyat. In a 1993 speech, Irving claimed that there had been only 100,000 Jewish deaths at Auschwitz, &quot;but not from gas chambers. They died from epidemics&quot;. Irving went on to claim that most of the Jewish deaths during World War II had been caused by Allied bombing. Irving claimed that &quot;The concentration camp inmates arrived in Berlin or Leipzig or in Dresden just in time for the RAF bombers to set fire to those cities. Nobody knows how many Jews died in those air raids&quot;.

In a 1994 speech, Irving lamented that his predictions of 1991 had failed to occur, and complained of the persistence of belief in the &quot;rotting corpse&quot; of the &quot;profitable legend&quot; of the Holocaust. In another 1994 speech, Irving claimed that there was no German policy of genocide of Jews, and that only 600,000 Jews died in concentration camps in World War II, all due to either Allied bombing or disease. At the same time, Irving started to appear more frequently at the annual conferences hosted by the IHR. In a 1995 speech, Irving claimed that the Holocaust was a myth invented by a &quot;world-wide Jewish cabal&quot; to serve their own ends. Irving also spoke on other topics at the IHR gatherings. A frequent theme was the claim that Winston Churchill had advance knowledge of the Japanese plans to attack Pearl Harbor, and refused to warn the Americans, in order to bring the United States into World War II. In 1995 he stated that, &quot;We revisionists, say that gas chambers didn&#x27;t exist and that the &#x27;factories of death&#x27; didn&#x27;t exist.&quot; In 1999, Irving said during a television interview, &quot;I&#x27;m a gas chamber denier. I&#x27;m a denier that they killed hundreds of thousands of people in gas chambers, yes.&quot;

At the same time, Irving maintained an ambivalent attitude to Holocaust denial depending on his audience. In a 1993 letter, Irving lashed out against his former friend Zündel, writing that: &quot;In April 1988 I unhesitatingly agreed to aid your defence as a witness in Toronto. &quot;I would not make the same mistake again&quot;. As a penalty for having defended you then, and for having continued to aid you since, my life has come under a gradually mounting attack: I find myself the worldwide victim of mass demonstrations, violence, vituperation and persecution&quot; (emphasis in the original). Irving went on to claim his life had been wonderful until Zündel had got him involved in the Holocaust denial movement: van Pelt argues that Irving was just trying to shift responsibility for his actions in his letter. In an interview with Australian radio in July 1995, Irving claimed that at least four million Jews died in World War II, though he argued that this was due to terrible sanitary conditions inside the concentration camps as opposed to a deliberate policy of genocide in the death camps. Irving&#x27;s statement led to a very public spat with his former ally Faurisson, who insisted that no Jews were killed in the Holocaust. In 1995, Irving stated in another speech that &quot;I have to take off my hat to my adversaries and the strategies they have employed—the marketing of the very word Holocaust: I half expected to see a little TM after it&quot;. Likewise, depending on his audience, during the 1990s Irving either used the absence of a written (Führer order) for the &quot;Final Solution&quot; to argue that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust, or claimed that the absence of a written order meant there was no Holocaust at all.

==Racism and antisemitism==
Although Irving denies being a racist, he has expressed racist and antisemitic sentiments, both publicly and privately. Irving has often expressed his belief in the conspiracy theory of Jews secretly ruling the world, and that the belief in the reality of the Holocaust was manufactured as part of the same alleged conspiracy. Irving used the label &quot;traditional enemies of the truth&quot; to describe Jews, and in a 1963 article about a speech by Sir Oswald Mosley wrote that the &quot;Yellow Star did not make a showing&quot;. In 1992, Irving stated that &quot;the Jews are very foolish not to abandon the gas chamber theory while they still have time&quot; and claimed he &quot;foresees a new wave of antisemitism&quot; the world over due to Jewish &quot;exploitation of the Holocaust myth&quot;. During an interview with the American writer Ron Rosenbaum, Irving restated his belief that Jews were his &quot;traditional enemy&quot;. In one interview cited in the libel lawsuit, Irving also stated that he would be &quot;willing to put [his] signature&quot; to the &quot;fact&quot; that &quot;a great deal of control over the world is exercised by Jews&quot;.

After Irving was sacked by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; to help them with their serialisation of the Goebbels diaries, he described a group of protesters outside of his apartment as, &quot;All the scum of humanity stand outside. The homosexuals, the gypsies, the lesbians, the Jews, the criminals, the Communists...&quot;

Several of these statements were cited by the judge&#x27;s decision in Irving&#x27;s lawsuit against Penguin Books and Deborah Lipstadt, leading the judge to conclude that Irving &quot;had on many occasions spoken in terms which are plainly racist.&quot; One example brought was his diary entry for 17 September 1994, in which Irving wrote about a ditty he composed for his young daughter &quot;when half-breed children are wheeled past&quot;:

Christopher Hitchens wrote that Irving sang the rhyme to Hitchens&#x27;s wife, Carol Blue, and daughter, Antonia, in the elevator following drinks in the family&#x27;s Washington apartment.

==&quot;Persona non grata&quot;==

After Irving denied the Holocaust in two speeches given in Austria in 1989, the Austrian government issued an arrest warrant for him and barred him from entering the country. In early 1992, a German court found him guilty of Holocaust denial under the &quot;Auschwitzlüge&quot; section of the law against &quot;Volksverhetzung&quot; (a failed appeal by Irving would see the fine rise from 10,000 DM to 30,000 DM), and he was subsequently barred from entering Germany. Other governments followed suit, including Italy and Canada, where he was arrested in November 1992 and deported to the United Kingdom. In an administrative hearing surrounding those events, he was found by the hearing office to have engaged in a &quot;total fabrication&quot; in telling a story of an exit from and return to Canada which would, for technical reasons, have made the original deportation order invalid. He was also barred from entering Australia in 1992, a ban he made five unsuccessful attempts to overturn.
In 1992, Irving signed a contract with Macmillan Publishers for his biography of Joseph Goebbels titled &quot;Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich&quot;. Following charges that Irving had selectively &quot;edited&quot; a recently discovered complete edition of Goebbels&#x27;s diaries in Moscow, Macmillan cancelled the book deal. The decision by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; (who had bought the rights to serialised extracts from the diaries before Macmillan published them) in July 1992 to hire Irving as a translator of Goebbels&#x27;s diary was criticised by Austrian-British historian Peter G. J. Pulzer, who argued that Irving, because of his views about the Third Reich, was not the best man for the job. Andrew Neil, the editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, called Irving &quot;reprehensible&quot;, but defended hiring him because he was only a &quot;transcribing technician&quot;, which others criticised as a poor description of translation work.

On 27 April 1993, Irving was ordered to attend court to be examined on charges relating to the &quot;Loi Gayssot&quot; in France, making it an offence to question the existence or size of the category of crimes against humanity. The law does not extend to extradition, and Irving refused to travel to France. Then, in February 1994, Irving spent 10 days of a three-month sentence in London&#x27;s Pentonville prison for contempt of court following a legal wrangling over publishing rights.

In 1995, St. Martin&#x27;s Press of New York City agreed to publish the Goebbels biography: but after protests, they cancelled the contract, leaving Irving in a situation in which, according to D. D. Guttenplan, he was desperate for financial help, publicity, and the need to re-establish his reputation as a historian. The book was eventually self-published.

===Libel suit===

On 5 September 1996, Irving filed a libel suit against Deborah Lipstadt and her British publisher Penguin Books for publishing the British edition of Lipstadt&#x27;s book, &quot;Denying the Holocaust&quot;, which had first been published in the United States in 1993. In the book, Lipstadt called Irving a Holocaust denier, falsifier and bigot, and said that he manipulated and distorted real documents.

During the trial, Irving claimed that Hitler had not ordered the extermination of the Jews of Europe, was ignorant of the Holocaust and was a friend of the Jews.

Lipstadt hired the British solicitor Anthony Julius to present her case, while Penguin Books hired Kevin Bays and Mark Bateman, libel specialist from media firm Davenport Lyons. They briefed the libel barrister Richard Rampton QC and Penguin also briefed junior barrister Heather Rogers. The defendants (with Penguin&#x27;s insurers paying the fee) also retained Professor Richard J. Evans, historian and Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University, as an expert witness. Also working as expert witnesses were the American Holocaust historian Christopher Browning, the German historian Peter Longerich, and the Dutch architectural expert Robert Jan van Pelt. The last wrote a report attesting to the fact that the death camps were designed, built and used for the purpose of mass murder, while Browning testified for the reality of the Holocaust. Evans&#x27; report was the most comprehensive, in-depth examination of Irving&#x27;s work:

The BBC quoted Evans further:

Not only did Irving lose the case, but in light of the evidence presented at the trial a number of his works that had previously escaped serious scrutiny were brought to public attention. He was also ordered to pay all of Penguin&#x27;s trial costs, estimated to be as much as £2 million (US$3.2 million), though it is uncertain how much of these costs he would ultimately pay. When he did not meet these, Davenport Lyons moved to make him bankrupt on behalf of their client. He was declared bankrupt in 2002, and lost his home, though he has been able to travel around the world despite his financial problems.

Irving subsequently appealed to the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal. On 20 July 2001, his application for appeal was denied by Lords Justices Pill, Mantell and Buxton.

The libel suit was depicted in a 2016 film, &quot;Denial.&quot;

===Life after the libel suit===

Early in September 2004, Michael Cullen, the Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand, announced that Irving would not be permitted to visit the country, where he had been invited by the National Press Club to give a series of lectures under the heading &quot;The Problems of Writing about World War II in a Free Society&quot;. The National Press Club defended its invitation of Irving, saying that it amounted not to an endorsement of his views, but rather an opportunity to question him. A government spokeswoman said that &quot;people who have been deported from another country are refused entry&quot; to New Zealand. Irving rejected the ban and attempted to board a Qantas flight for New Zealand from Los Angeles on 17 September 2004. He was not allowed on board.

On 11 November 2005, the Austrian police in the southern state of Styria, acting under the 1989 warrant, arrested Irving. Irving pleaded guilty to the charge of &quot;trivialising, grossly playing down and denying the Holocaust&quot;. Irving stated in his plea that he had changed his opinions on the Holocaust, &quot;I said that then based on my knowledge at the time, but by 1991 when I came across the Eichmann papers, I wasn&#x27;t saying that anymore and I wouldn&#x27;t say that now. The Nazis did murder millions of Jews.&quot; Irving had obtained the papers from Hugo Byttebier, a Belgian who had served in the SS during the war and had escaped to Argentina. Irving was sentenced to three years&#x27; imprisonment in accordance with the law prohibiting Nazi activities (, &quot;Prohibition Law&quot;). Irving sat motionless as judge Peter Liebetreu asked him if he had understood the sentence, to which he replied &quot;I&#x27;m not sure I do&quot; before being escorted out of the court by Austrian police. Later, Irving said that he was shocked by the severity of the sentence. He had reportedly already purchased a plane ticket home to London.

In December 2006, Irving was released from prison and banned from ever returning to Austria. Upon Irving&#x27;s arrival in the UK he reaffirmed his position, stating that he felt &quot;no need any longer to show remorse&quot; for his Holocaust views. On 18 May 2007, he was expelled from the 52nd Warsaw International Book Fair in Poland because the books he took there were deemed by the organizers as promoting Nazism and antisemitism, which is in violation of Polish law.

Since then, Irving has continued to work as a freelance writer, despite his troubled public image. He was drawn into the controversy surrounding Bishop Richard Williamson, who in a televised interview recorded in Germany in November 2008 denied the Holocaust took place, only to see Williamson convicted for incitement in April 2010 after refusing to pay a fine of €12,000. Irving subsequently found himself beset by protesters on a book tour of the United States. He has also given lectures and tours in the UK and Europe; one tour to Poland in September 2010 which led to particular criticism included the Treblinka death camp as an itinerary stop.

Irving and Nick Griffin (then the British National Party leader) were invited to speak at a forum on free speech at the Oxford Union on 26 November 2007, along with Anne Atkins and Evan Harris. The debate took place after Oxford Union members voted in favour of it, but was disrupted by protesters. Irving was lecturing to small audiences at venues disclosed to carefully vetted ticket-holders a day or two before the event on topics, including antisemitic conspiracy theories, and at one such event, claiming to write the truth unlike &quot;conformist&quot; historians while asserting fabrications about leading Nazis, the life and death of Heinrich Himmler and the saturation bombings during World War II.

Irving established a website selling Nazi memorabilia in 2009. The items are offered by other people, with Irving receiving a commission from each sale for authenticating them. Irving stated in 2009 that the website was the only way he could make money after being bankrupted in 2002. Items sold through the website include Hitler&#x27;s walking stick and a lock of the dictator&#x27;s hair. Irving has also investigated the authenticity of bones purported to be from Hitler and Eva Braun.

During an interview with Johann Hari, Irving said that in the 1970s, Erwin Giesing, one of Hitler&#x27;s doctors, had quoted Hitler to him thus: &quot;One day, an Englishman will come along and write my biography. But it cannot be an English man of the present generation. They won&#x27;t to be objective. It will have to be an Englishman of the next generation, and one who is totally familiar with all the German archives.&quot; Irving said that Giesing had identified him as the objective Englishman that Hitler had spoken of.

During the same interview, Irving claimed that various Nazis hid what was happening to the Jews from Hitler because he was &quot;the best friend the Jews had in the Third Reich&quot;.

=== 2009 Norwegian Festival of Literature ===
In October 2008, controversy arose in Norway over Irving&#x27;s invitation to speak at the 2009 Norwegian Festival of Literature. Several of Norway&#x27;s most distinguished authors protested against the invitation. The leader of the board for the festival, Jesper Holte, defended the invitation by stating: &quot;Our agenda is to invite a liar and a falsifier of history to a festival about truth. And confront him with this. Irving has been invited to discuss his concept of truth in light of his activity as a writer of historical books and the many accusations he has been exposed to as a consequence of this.&quot; Although Irving was introduced in the festival&#x27;s webpages as &quot;historian and writer&quot;, the board chair leader defended the more aggressive language being used to characterise Irving in connection with the controversy that had arisen. Lars Saabye Christensen and Roy Jacobsen were two authors who had threatened to boycott the festival on account of Irving&#x27;s invitation, and Anne B. Ragde stated that Sigrid Undset would have turned in her grave. As the festival has as its subsidiary name &quot;Sigrid Undset Days&quot;, a representative of Undset&#x27;s family had requested that the name of the Nobel laureate be removed in connection with the festival. Also, the Norwegian free speech organization Fritt Ord was critical of letting Irving speak at the festival and had requested that its logo be removed. In addition, Edvard Hoem announced that he would not attend the 2009 festival with Irving taking part. Per Edgar Kokkvold, leader of the Norwegian Press Confederation, advocated cancelling Irving&#x27;s invitation.

Days after the controversy had started, the invitation was rescinded. This led to the resignation of Stig Sæterbakken from his position as content director as he was the person who had invited Irving to the event. The head of the Norwegian Festival of Literature, Randi Skeie, deplored what had taken place: &quot;Everything is fine as long as everyone agrees, but things get more difficult when one doesn&#x27;t like the views being put forward.&quot; Sæterbakken called his colleagues &quot;damned cowards&quot;, arguing that they were walking in lockstep.

According to editor-in-chief Sven Egil Omdal of , the opposition to Irving&#x27;s participation at the festival appeared as a concerted effort. He suggested that campaign journalism from two of Norway&#x27;s largest newspapers, &quot;Dagbladet&quot; and &quot;Aftenposten&quot;, and Norway&#x27;s public service broadcaster NRK was behind the controversy.

David Irving commented that he had not been told that the festival was going to present him as a liar, and that he was preparing a lecture about the real history of what took place in Norway during World War II, contrary to what official historians have presented. Irving stated that he had thought the Norwegian people to be &quot;made of tougher stuff.&quot;

Only days after the cancellation Irving announced that he would go to Lillehammer during the literature festival and deliver his two-hour lecture from a hotel room.

==Reception by historians==

Irving, once held in regard for his expert knowledge of German military archives, was a controversial figure from the start. His interpretations of the war were widely regarded as unduly favourable to the German side. At first this was seen as personal opinion, unpopular but consistent with full respectability as a historian.

By 1988, however, Irving had begun to reject the status of the Holocaust as a systematic and deliberate genocide. He soon became the main proponent of Holocaust denial. This, along with his association with far-right circles, dented his standing as a historian. A marked change in Irving&#x27;s reputation can be seen in the surveys of the historiography of the Third Reich produced by Ian Kershaw. In the first edition of Kershaw&#x27;s book &quot;The Nazi Dictatorship&quot; in 1985, Irving was called a &quot;maverick&quot; historian working outside the mainstream of the historical profession. By the time of the fourth edition of &quot;The Nazi Dictatorship&quot; in 2000, Irving was described only as a historical writer who had in the 1970s engaged in &quot;provocations&quot; intended to provide an &quot;exculpation of Hitler&#x27;s role in the Final Solution&quot;. Other critical responses to his work tend to follow this pattern.

The description of Irving as a historian, rather than an author writing about history, is controversial, with some publications since the libel trial continuing to refer to him as a &quot;historian&quot; or &quot;disgraced historian&quot;, while others insist he is not a historian, and have adopted alternatives such as &quot;author&quot;
or &quot;historical writer&quot;.
The military historian John Keegan praised Irving for his &quot;extraordinary ability to describe and analyse Hitler&#x27;s conduct of military operations, which was his main occupation during the Second World War&quot;. Donald Cameron Watt, Emeritus Professor of Modern History at the London School of Economics, wrote that he admires some of Irving&#x27;s work as a historian, though he rejects his conclusions about the Holocaust. At the libel proceedings against Irving, Watt declined Irving&#x27;s request to testify, appearing only after a subpoena was ordered. He testified that Irving had written a &quot;very, very effective piece of historical scholarship&quot; in the 1960s, which was unrelated to his controversial work. He also said that Irving was &quot;not in the top class&quot; of military historians.

==Personal life==
In 1961, while living in Spain, Irving met and married a Spaniard, María del Pilar Stuyck. They have four children. They divorced in 1981. In 1992, Irving began a relationship with a Danish model, Bente Hogh. They have a daughter, born in 1994.

Irving&#x27;s daughter Josephine suffered from schizophrenia. She was involved in a car crash in 1996 which resulted in her having to have both of her legs amputated. In September 1999, at the age of 32, she died by suicide by throwing herself out of a window of her central London flat. One of the wreaths sent to her funeral contained a card which stated, &quot;Truly a merciful death, Philipp Bouhler and friends&quot;. The reference to Bouhler was a reference to the Nazi who was in charge of Hitler&#x27;s euthanasia programme. Irving described it as a &quot;very cruel taunt&quot;.
===Illness===
In February 2024, Irving&#x27;s family announced that he had fallen ill while in Florida in October 2023 and &quot;has been in declining health ever since&quot;, had been hospitalised for two months, and has returned to England but requires &quot;round-the-clock care&quot;. The statement also says &quot;It is with sadness that we must accept that David is now unable to engage in his life’s work&quot;.

<text>Savoie (; Arpitan: &quot;Savouè&quot; or &quot;Savouè-d&#x27;Avâl&quot;; English: &quot;Savoy&quot; ) is a department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, Southeastern France. Located in the French Alps, its prefecture is Chambéry. In 2019, Savoie had a population of 436,434.

Together with Haute-Savoie, it is one of the two departments of the historical region of Savoy; the Duchy of Savoy was annexed by France in 1860, following the signature of the Treaty of Turin. The area is known for its numerous ski resorts and contribution to French cuisine, with culinary specialities such as fondue savoyarde, tartiflette, génépi, as well as various sorts of saucisson.

==History==
It is widely accepted that Savoie takes its name from the Latin &quot;Sapaudia&quot; or &quot;Sabaudia&quot;, meaning land covered in fir trees. Savoie was long part of the states of Savoy; though beginning in the 16th century, it was occupied by France several times. It was integrated into the Mont-Blanc department from 1792 to 1815 (and partially into the Léman department from 1798 to 1814). The province was annexed by France in 1860. The former Duchy of Savoy became the two departments of Savoie and Haute-Savoie.

Moûtiers, capital of the former province of Tarentaise Valley (French: &quot;Vallée de la Tarentaise&quot;), ceased to be a subprefecture following a law that took effect on 10 September 1926.

Savoie hosted the 1992 Winter Olympics, based in Albertville with ski events at Tarentaise and Beaufortain. The coat of arms for Savoie was used as a pattern for the flames in the official emblem of the games.

The other main alpine valley is the Maurienne, connected to the Tarentaise valley by two passes, the col de la Madeleine and the highest pass in Europe, the col de l&#x27;Iseran. The Maurienne valley was through the col du Mont Cenis, the major commercial route between France and Italy. It is one of the longest intra-alpine valleys in the Alps.

==Geography==
Savoie is part of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region established on 1 January 2016. It was previously part of Rhône-Alpes. It borders the departments of Haute-Savoie, Ain, Isère and Hautes-Alpes in addition to the Aosta Valley and the Metropolitan City of Turin in Italy.

Much of Savoie is covered by mountains:
*Mont Blanc Massif
*Belledonne Massif
*Lauzière massif
*Aiguilles d&#x27;Arves Massif
*Massif des Cerces
*Aravis Range
*Mont Cenis Massif
*Bauges Massif
*Chartreuse Massif
*Vanoise Massif
*Beaufortain Massif

The department is crossed by the Isère river, which has its source in the Iseran pass. Its two main lakes are Lac du Bourget (the largest and deepest lake entirely in France) and Lac d&#x27;Aiguebelette, one of the least polluted in France due to a 1976 law forbidding any use of motorboats on the lake.

===Climate===
Most of the department features an alpine climate or a subalpine climate. At lower altitudes and in the valleys, the climate is humid continental (Köppen: Dfb) or even oceanic in the frontcounrty and lake Bourget area (Köppen: Cfb), using the isotherm.

==Economy==
According to the Chambéry chamber of commerce, close to 50% of the department&#x27;s wealth comes from tourism. Each year, Savoie hosts over 30 million visitor-nights of tourists. Savoie also profits from its natural resources with particular strengths in ore processing and hydroelectric power.

Savoie had an exceptionally high export/import ratio of 214% in 2005. Its exports rose to €1.768 billion and €825 million in imports. Its leading exports were steel, aluminum, and electric and electronic components.

===Agriculture===
Savoie is famous for its cows, which produce numerous cheeses, some of them are:
*Beaufort
*Savoie gruyère
*Reblochon
*Abbaye de Tamié
*Tome des Bauges
*Tomme de Savoie

Numerous wine grapes are also grown in Savoie. The most famous wines are made of Gamay, Pinot noir and Mondeuse grapes. Fruit production is the third largest component of agriculture in Savoie.

Apples and pears are also produced in the region and are well known for their qualities.

==Demographics==

Residents of Savoie are known as &quot;Savoyards&quot;, though they can also be called &quot;Savoisiens&quot; (the historical name) or &quot;Savoyens&quot;.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Chambéry, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 8 communes with more than 7,000 inhabitants:

The &quot;average&quot; (see arithmetic mean) population density is not a good indicator: the valleys tend to be much more densely populated, whereas the mountains tend to be near-completely uninhabited.

===Religion===
The Catholic Church in Savoie is divided into three dioceses: Chambéry, Maurienne, and Tarentaise. Together, they form an archdiocese, in which the bishop of Chambéry is the archbishop.

==Politics==
===Departmental Council of Savoie===

The Departmental Council of Savoie has 38 seats. 30 councillors are part of the J&#x27;aime la Savoie (&quot;I love Savoie&quot;) right-wing group; 8 councillors are part of the Savoie pour Tous (&quot;Savoie for All&quot;) left-wing group. Hervé Gaymard (The Republicans) has been President of the Departmental Council since 2008. Thierry Repentin (Socialist Party) has been Opposition Leader since 1998.

===Members of the National Assembly===

Savoie elected the following members of the National Assembly during the 2017 legislative election:

===Senators===

Savoie is represented by two Senators in Parliament. Jean-Pierre Vial and Martine Berthet have served since 1995 and 2017 respectively. Both are members of The Republicans (LR).

==Tourism==
Tourism, which is quite important to Savoie, began to develop towards the end of the 19th century, mostly summer oriented. The increase in the popularity of skiing in the 20th century made Savoie home to the largest number of ski hills in France, including many famous ones:
*Val-d&#x27;Isère
*Tignes
*Les Arcs
*La Plagne
*Courchevel
*Méribel
*Valmorel
*Les Menuires
*Val Thorens
*Les Saisies
*Savoie Grand Revard
*Bramans
*Bessans 
*Valloire

Hydrotherapy, practised in the region since antiquity, is also quite developed. There are four locations that are still active:
*Aix-les-Bains
*Challes-les-Eaux
*Brides-les-Bains
*La Léchère

His work utilizes guitar and laptop computers to blend melody with treated samples and glitch production. He lives and works in Vienna, and currently records on the UK label Touch.

Fennesz first received widespread recognition for his 2001 album &quot;Endless Summer&quot;, released on the Austrian label Mego. He has collaborated with a number of artists, including Ryuichi Sakamoto, Jim O&#x27;Rourke, Ulver, David Sylvian, and King Midas Sound.

== Biography ==
Fennesz was born and raised in Austria and studied music formally in art school. He started playing guitar around the age of 8 or 9. He initially performed as a member of the Austrian experimental rock band Maische before signing to electronic music label Mego as a solo artist. The influence of techno led him to begin composing with a laptop. In 1995 he released his first EP &quot;Instrument&quot;, which explored electro-acoustic and ambient stylings.

In 1997, Fennesz released his debut full-length album &quot;Hotel Paral.lel&quot;, which saw him delve more explicitly into laptop production and early glitch aesthetics. He followed with the 1998 single &quot;Plays&quot;, which contained near-unrecognizable covers of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Paint It Black&quot; and the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)&quot;. In the following years, he collaborated with a variety of artists, including Peter &quot;Pita&quot; Rehberg and Jim O&#x27;Rourke as part of Fenn O&#x27;Berg. In 2001, he released his third studio album &quot;Endless Summer&quot; to widespread critical praise and recognition. He collaborated with figures such as David Sylvian, Keith Rowe, eRikm, Ryuichi Sakamoto in the following years, and released the albums &quot;Venice&quot; (2004) and &quot;Black Sea&quot; (2007) to further critical praise.

In 2009 Fennesz teamed up with Mark Linkous (Sparklehorse) to create In the Fishtank 15. The following year Fennesz released &quot;Szampler&quot;, a cassette containing his sample collection on the Tapeworm label. This release was later remixed by Stefan Goldmann and released as &quot;Goldmann vs. Fennesz: Remiksz&quot;. In 2011, he appeared on the live Ulver release &quot;The Norwegian National Opera&quot;, contributing guitar and effects to &quot;Not Saved.&quot; In November 2013, Fennesz played the final holiday camp edition of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in Camber Sands, England. In 2014, he released the studio album &quot;Bécs&quot;. In 2015, he collaborated with UK group King Midas Sound on the album &quot;Editions 1&quot;.

==Recording techniques==
Since the 1990s, Fennesz has worked with the programming software Max/MSP and the free patch Ppooll, which he runs in conjunction with the workstation Logic 9. In both studio and live settings, he routes his guitar through effects pedals (including a custom distortion box) and into his computer. There, it is processed and combined with Ppooll software plugins and tools such as samplers, synthesizers, effects, and MIDI controllers.

<text>Thomas Bertram Costain (May 8, 1885 – October 8, 1965) was a Canadian-American journalist who became a best-selling author of historical novels at the age of 57.

==Life==

Costain was born in Brantford, Ontario to John Herbert Costain and Mary Schultz. He attended high school there at the Brantford Collegiate Institute. Before graduating from high school, he had written four novels, one of which was a 70,000 word romance about Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange. These early novels were rejected by publishers.

His first writing success came in 1902 when the &quot;Brantford Courier&quot; accepted a mystery story from him, and he became a reporter there (for five dollars a week). He was an editor at the Guelph &quot;Daily Mercury&quot; between 1908 and 1910. He married Ida Randolph Spragge (1888–1975) in York Township, Ontario on January 12, 1910. The couple had two children, Molly (Mrs. Howard Haycraft) and Dora (Mrs. Henry Darlington Steinmetz). in 1910, Costain joined the Maclean Publishing Group where he edited three trade journals. Beginning in 1914, he was a staff writer for and, from 1917, editor of the Toronto-based &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine. His success there brought him to the attention of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in New York City where he was fiction editor for fourteen years.

In 1920, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He also worked for Doubleday Books as an editor 1939-1946. He was the head of 20th Century Fox&#x27;s bureau of literary development (story department) from 1934 to 1942.

In 1940, he wrote four short novels but was &quot;enough of an editor not to send them out&quot;. He next planned to write six books in a series he called &quot;The Stepchildren of History&quot;. He would write about six interesting but unknown historical figures. For his first, he wrote about the seventeenth-century pirate John Ward aka Jack Ward. In 1942, he realized his longtime dream when this first novel &quot;For My Great Folly&quot; was published, and it became a bestseller with over 132,000 copies sold. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer stated at the end of the review &quot;there will be no romantic-adventure lover left unsatisfied.&quot; In January 1946 he &quot;retired&quot; to spend the rest of his life writing, at a rate of about 3,000 words a day.

Raised as a Baptist, he was reported in the 1953 &quot;Current Biography&quot; to be an attendant of the Protestant Episcopal Church. He was described as a handsome, tall, broad-shouldered man with a pink and white complexion, clear blue eyes, and a slight Canadian accent. He was white-haired by the time he began to write novels. He loved animals and could not even kill a bug (but he also loved bridge, and he did not extend the same policy to his partners). He also loved movies and the theatre (he met his future wife when she was performing Ruth in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;).

Costain&#x27;s work is a mixture of commercial history (such as &quot;The White and The Gold&quot;, a history of New France to around 1720) and fiction that relies heavily on historic events (one review stated it was hard to tell where history leaves off and apocrypha begins). His most popular novel was &quot;The Black Rose&quot; (1945), centred in the time and actions of Bayan of the Baarin also known as Bayan of the Hundred Eyes. Costain noted in his foreword that he initially intended the book to be about Bayan and Edward I, but became caught up in the legend of Thomas Becket&#x27;s parents: an English knight married to an Eastern girl. The book was a selection of the Literary Guild with a first printing of 650,000 copies and sold over two million copies in its first year. In 1950, it was made into a successful film starring Orson Welles as Bayan and Tyrone Power as Walter.

His research led him to believe that Richard III was a great monarch tarred by conspiracies, after his death, with the murder of the princes in the tower. Costain supported his theories with documentation, suggesting that the real murderer was Henry VII.

Costain died in 1965 at his New York City home of a heart attack at the age of 80. He is buried in the Farringdon Independent Church Cemetery in Brantford.

==Awards and honours==

He received a Doctor of Letters (D. Litt) degree from the University of Western Ontario in May 1952 and he received a gold medallion from the Canadian Club of New York in June 1965. The Thomas B. Costain public elementary school (1953) and the Thomas B. Costain – S.C. Johnson Community Centre (2002) in Brantford are named in his honour.

His daughter Molly Costain Haycraft became a writer of historical novels.

==Influence==
George R. R. Martin has cited Costain&#x27;s non-fiction books on the Plantagenet dynasty as an influence on his book &quot;Fire and Blood&quot;, part of Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series.

<doc id="87595" wikidata="Q726239" url="?curid=87595" title="Noise music">
<text>Noise music is a genre of music that is characterised by the expressive use of noise. This type of music tends to challenge the distinction that is made in conventional musical practices between musical and non-musical sound. Noise music includes a wide range of musical styles and sound-based creative practices that feature noise as a primary aspect.

Noise music can feature acoustically or electronically generated noise, and both traditional and unconventional musical instruments. It may incorporate live machine sounds, non-musical vocal techniques, physically manipulated audio media, processed sound recordings, field recording, computer-generated noise, stochastic process, and other randomly produced electronic signals such as distortion, feedback, static, hiss and hum. There may also be emphasis on high volume levels and lengthy, continuous pieces. More generally noise music may contain aspects such as improvisation, extended technique, cacophony and indeterminacy. In many instances, conventional use of melody, harmony, rhythm or pulse is dispensed with.

The Futurist art movement (with most notably Luigi Russolo&#x27;s Intonarumori and &quot;L&#x27;Arte dei Rumori&quot; (&quot;The Art of Noises&quot;) manifesto) was important for the development of the noise aesthetic, as was the Dada art movement (a prime example being the &quot;Antisymphony&quot; concert performed on April 30, 1919, in Berlin). In the 1920s, the French composer Edgard Varèse, when New York Dada associated via Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia&#x27;s magazine &quot;391&quot;, conceived of the elements of his music in terms of sound-masses; writing in the first half of the 1920s, &quot;Offrandes&quot;, &quot;Hyperprism&quot;, &quot;Octandre&quot;, and &quot;Intégrales&quot;. Varèse thought that &quot;to stubbornly conditioned ears, anything new in music has always been called noise&quot;, and he posed the question: &quot;what is music but organized noises?&quot;

Pierre Schaeffer&#x27;s &quot;musique concrète&quot; 1948 compositions &quot;Cinq études de bruits&quot; (&quot;Five Noise Studies&quot;), that began with (&quot;Railway Study&quot;) are key to this history. consisted of a set of recordings made at the train station Gare des Batignolles in Paris that included six steam locomotives whistling and trains accelerating and moving over the tracks. The piece was derived entirely from recorded noise sounds that were not musical, thus a realization of Russolo&#x27;s conviction that noise could be an acceptable source of music. &quot;Cinq études de bruits&quot; premiered via a radio broadcast on October 5, 1948, called (&quot;Noise Concert&quot;).

Later in the 1960s, the Fluxus art movement played an important role, specifically the Fluxus artists Joe Jones, Yasunao Tone, George Brecht, Robert Watts, Wolf Vostell, Dieter Roth, Yoko Ono, Nam June Paik, Walter De Maria&#x27;s &quot;Ocean Music&quot;, Milan Knížák&#x27;s &quot;Broken Music Composition&quot;, early La Monte Young, Takehisa Kosugi, and the &quot;Analog #1 (Noise Study)&quot; (1961) by Fluxus-related composer James Tenney.

Contemporary noise music is often associated with extreme volume and distortion. Notable genres that exploit such techniques include noise rock and no wave, industrial music, Japanoise, and postdigital music such as glitch. In the domain of experimental rock, examples include Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; and Sonic Youth. Other notable examples of composers and bands that feature noise based materials include works by Iannis Xenakis, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Helmut Lachenmann, Cornelius Cardew, Theatre of Eternal Music, Glenn Branca, Rhys Chatham, Ryoji Ikeda, Survival Research Laboratories, Whitehouse, Coil, Merzbow, Cabaret Voltaire, Psychic TV, Jean Tinguely&#x27;s recordings of his sound sculpture (specifically &quot;Bascule VII&quot;), the music of Hermann Nitsch&#x27;s &quot;Orgien Mysterien Theater&quot;, and La Monte Young&#x27;s bowed gong works from the late 1960s.

==Definitions==
According to Danish noise and music theorist Torben Sangild, one single definition of noise in music is not possible. Sangild instead provides three basic definitions of noise: a musical acoustics definition, a second communicative definition based on distortion or disturbance of a communicative signal, and a third definition based in subjectivity (what is noise to one person can be meaningful to another; what was considered unpleasant sound yesterday is not today).

According to Murray Schafer there are four types of noise: unwanted noise, unmusical sound, any loud sound, and a disturbance in any signaling system (such as static on a telephone). Definitions regarding what is considered noise, relative to music, have changed over time. Ben Watson, in his article &quot;Noise as Permanent Revolution&quot;, points out that Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Grosse Fuge&quot; (1825) &quot;sounded like noise&quot; to his audience at the time. Indeed, Beethoven&#x27;s publishers persuaded him to remove it from its original setting as the last movement of a string quartet. He did so, replacing it with a sparkling &quot;Allegro&quot;. They subsequently published it separately.

In attempting to define noise music and its value, Paul Hegarty (2007) cites the work of noted cultural critics Jean Baudrillard, Georges Bataille and Theodor Adorno and through their work traces the history of &quot;noise&quot;. He defines noise at different times as &quot;intrusive, unwanted&quot;, &quot;lacking skill, not being appropriate&quot; and &quot;a threatening emptiness&quot;. He traces these trends starting with 18th-century concert hall music. Hegarty contends that it is John Cage&#x27;s composition &quot;4&#x27;33&quot;&quot;, in which an audience sits through four and a half minutes of &quot;silence&quot; (Cage 1973), that represents the beginning of noise music proper. For Hegarty, &quot;noise music&quot;, as with &quot;4&#x27;33&quot;&quot;, is that music made up of incidental sounds that represent perfectly the tension between &quot;desirable&quot; sound (properly played musical notes) and undesirable &quot;noise&quot; that make up all noise music from Erik Satie to NON to Glenn Branca. Writing about Japanese noise music, Hegarty suggests that &quot;it is not a genre, but it is also a genre that is multiple, and characterized by this very multiplicity ... Japanese noise music can come in all styles, referring to all other genres ... but crucially asks the question of genre—what does it mean to be categorized, categorizable, definable?&quot; (Hegarty 2007:133).

Writer Douglas Kahn, in his work &quot;Noise, Water, Meat: A History of Sound in the Arts&quot; (1999), discusses the use of noise as a medium and explores the ideas of Antonin Artaud, George Brecht, William Burroughs, Sergei Eisenstein, Fluxus, Allan Kaprow, Michael McClure, Yoko Ono, Jackson Pollock, Luigi Russolo, and Dziga Vertov.

In &quot;&quot; (1985), Jacques Attali explores the relationship between noise music and the future of society by considering noise music as not merely reflective of, but importantly pre-figurative of social transformations. He indicates that noise in music is a predictor of social change and demonstrates how noise acts as the subconscious of society—validating and testing new social and political realities. His alternative view of the standard history of music, with his emphasis on noise, theorized culture in a way that influenced many noise music theoretical studies to follow, such as Brandon LaBelle&#x27;s &quot;Background Noise: Perspectives on Sound Art&quot; (2006), Alan Licht&#x27;s &quot;Sound Art: Beyond Music, between Categories&quot; (2007), Thomas Bey William Bailey&#x27;s &quot;Micro Bionic: Radical Electronic Music and Sound Art in the 21st Century&quot; (2009), Caleb Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Cracked Media: The Sound of Malfunction&quot; (2009), Joseph Nechvatal&#x27;s &quot;Immersion Into Noise&quot; (2011), and Mark Delaere&#x27;s &quot;Noise as a Constructive Element in Music Theoretical and Music-Analytical Perspectives&quot; (2022).

==Characteristics==
Like much of modern and contemporary art, noise music takes characteristics of the perceived negative traits of noise mentioned below and uses them in aesthetic and imaginative ways.
In common use, the word noise means unwanted sound or noise pollution.
In electronics noise can refer to the electronic signal corresponding to acoustic noise (in an audio system) or the electronic signal corresponding to the (visual) noise commonly seen as &#x27;snow&#x27; on a degraded television or video image. In signal processing or computing it can be considered data without meaning; that is, data that is not being used to transmit a signal, but is simply produced as an unwanted by-product of other activities. Noise can block, distort, or change the meaning of a message in both human and electronic communication.
White noise is a random signal (or process) with a flat power spectral density. In other words, the signal contains equal power within a fixed bandwidth at any center frequency. White noise is considered analogous to white light which contains all frequencies.

In much the same way the early modernists were inspired by naïve art, some contemporary digital art noise musicians are excited by the archaic audio technologies such as wire-recorders, the 8-track cartridge, and vinyl records. Many artists not only build their own noise-generating devices, but even their own specialized recording equipment and custom software (for example, the C++ software used in creating the &quot;viral symphOny&quot; by Joseph Nechvatal).

==1910s–1960s==
===Origins===
In &quot;Futurism and Musical Notes&quot;, Daniele Lombardi discussed the French composer Carol-Bérard; a pupil of Isaac Albéniz, who composed a &quot;Symphony of Mechanical Force&quot;s in 1910, wrote on the problems of the instrumentation of noise music, and developed a notation system.
In 1913 Futurist artist Luigi Russolo wrote his manifesto, &quot;L&#x27;Arte dei Rumori&quot;, translated as &quot;The Art of Noises&quot;, stating that the industrial revolution had given modern men a greater capacity to appreciate more complex sounds. Russolo found traditional melodic music confining and envisioned noise music as its future replacement. He designed and constructed a number of noise-generating devices called &quot;intonarumori&quot; and assembled a noise orchestra to perform with them. Works entitled &quot;Risveglio di una città&quot; (Awakening of a City) and &quot;Convegno d&#x27;aeroplani e d&#x27;automobili&quot; (The Meeting of Aeroplanes and Automobiles) were both performed for the first time in 1914.

A performance of his &quot;Gran Concerto Futuristico&quot; (1917) was met with strong disapproval and violence from the audience, as Russolo himself had predicted. None of his intoning devices have survived, though recently some have been reconstructed and used in performances. Although Russolo&#x27;s works bear little resemblance to contemporary noise music such as Japanoise, his efforts helped to introduce noise as a musical aesthetic and broaden the perception of sound as an artistic medium.

Antonio Russolo, Luigi&#x27;s brother and fellow Italian Futurist composer, produced a recording of two works featuring the original &quot;intonarumori&quot;. The 1921 made phonograph with works entitled &quot;Corale&quot; and &quot;Serenata&quot;, combined conventional orchestral music set against the famous noise machines and is the only surviving sound recording.

An early Dada-related work from 1916 by Marcel Duchamp also worked with noise, but in an almost silent way. One of the found object Readymades of Marcel Duchamp, &quot;A Bruit Secret&quot; (With Hidden Noise), was a collaborative work that created a noise instrument that Duchamp accomplished with Walter Arensberg. What rattles inside when &quot;A Bruit Secret&quot; is shaken remains a mystery.

===Found sound===
In the same period the utilisation of found sound as a musical resource was starting to be explored. An early example is &quot;Parade&quot;, a performance produced at the Chatelet Theatre, Paris, on May 18, 1917, that was conceived by Jean Cocteau, with design by Pablo Picasso, choreography by Leonid Massine, and music by Eric Satie. The extra-musical materials used in the production were referred to as &quot;trompe l&#x27;oreille&quot; sounds by Cocteau and included a dynamo, Morse code machine, sirens, steam engine, airplane motor, and typewriters. Arseny Avraamov&#x27;s composition &quot;Symphony of Factory Sirens&quot; involved navy ship sirens and whistles, bus and car horns, factory sirens, cannons, foghorns, artillery guns, machine guns, hydro-airplanes, a specially designed steam-whistle machine creating noisy renderings of &quot;Internationale&quot; and &quot;Marseillaise&quot; for a piece conducted by a team using flags and pistols when performed in the city of Baku in 1922. In 1923, Arthur Honegger created &quot;Pacific 231&quot;, a modernist musical composition that imitates the sound of a steam locomotive. Another example is Ottorino Respighi&#x27;s 1924 orchestral piece &quot;Pines of Rome&quot;, which included the phonographic playback of a nightingale recording. Also in 1924, George Antheil created a work titled Ballet Mécanique with instrumentation that included 16 pianos, 3 airplane propellers, and 7 electric bells. The work was originally conceived as music for the Dada film of the same name, by Dudley Murphy and Fernand Léger, but in 1926 it premiered independently as a concert piece.

In 1930 Paul Hindemith and Ernst Toch recycled records to create sound montages and in 1936 Edgard Varèse experimented with records, playing them backwards, and at varying speeds. Varese had earlier used sirens to create what he called a &quot;continuous flowing curve&quot; of sound that he could not achieve with acoustic instruments. In 1931, Varese&#x27;s &quot;Ionisation&quot; for 13 players featured 2 sirens, a lion&#x27;s roar, and used 37 percussion instruments to create a repertoire of unpitched sounds making it the first musical work to be organized solely on the basis of noise. In remarking on Varese&#x27;s contributions the American composer John Cage stated that Varese had &quot;established the present nature of music&quot; and that he had &quot;moved into the field of sound itself while others were still discriminating &#x27;musical tones&#x27; from noises&quot;.

In an essay written in 1937, Cage expressed an interest in using extra-musical materials and came to distinguish between found sounds, which he called noise, and musical sounds, examples of which included: rain, static between radio channels, and &quot;a truck at fifty miles per hour&quot;. Essentially, Cage made no distinction, in his view all sounds have the potential to be used creatively. His aim was to capture and control elements of the sonic environment and employ a method of sound organisation, a term borrowed from Varese, to bring meaning to the sound materials. Cage began in 1939 to create a series of works that explored his stated aims, the first being &quot;Imaginary Landscape #1&quot; for instruments including two variable speed turntables with frequency recordings.

In 1961, James Tenney composed &quot;Analogue #1: Noise Study&quot; (for tape) using computer synthesized noise and &quot;Collage No.1 (Blue Suede)&quot; (for tape) by sampling and manipulating a famous Elvis Presley recording.

===Experimental music===
In 1932, Bauhaus artists László Moholy-Nagy, Oskar Fischinger and Paul Arma experimented with modifying the physical contents of record grooves.

Under the influence of Henry Cowell in San Francisco in the late 1940s, Lou Harrison and John Cage began composing music for &quot;junk&quot; (waste) percussion ensembles, scouring junkyards and Chinatown antique shops for appropriately tuned brake drums, flower pots, gongs, and more.

In Europe, during the late 1940s, Pierre Schaeffer coined the term &quot;musique concrète&quot; to refer to the peculiar nature of sounds on tape, separated from the source that generated them initially. Pierre Schaeffer helped form Studio d&#x27;Essai of the Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française in Paris during World War II. Initially serving the French Resistance, Studio d&#x27;Essai became a hub for musical development centered around implementing electronic devices in compositions. It was from this group that musique concrète was developed. A type of electroacoustic music, musique concrète is characterized by its use of recorded sound, electronics, tape, animate and inanimate sound sources, and various manipulation techniques. The first of Schaeffer&#x27;s &quot;Cinq études de bruits&quot; (&quot;Five Noise Etudes&quot;), called &quot;Étude aux chemins de fer&quot; (1948) consisted of transformed locomotive sounds. The last étude, &quot;Étude pathétique&quot; (1948), makes use of sounds recorded from sauce pans and canal boats. &quot;Cinq études de bruits&quot; was premiered via a radio broadcast on October 5, 1948, titled &quot;Concert de bruits&quot;.

Following musique concrète, other modernist art music composers such as Richard Maxfield, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Gottfried Michael Koenig, Pierre Henry, Iannis Xenakis, La Monte Young, and David Tudor, composed significant electronic, vocal, and instrumental works, sometimes using found sounds. In late 1947, Antonin Artaud recorded &#x27; (&quot;To Have Done with the Judgment of God&quot;), an audio piece full of the seemingly random cacophony of xylophonic sounds mixed with various percussive elements, mixed with the noise of alarming human cries, screams, grunts, onomatopoeia, and glossolalia. In 1949, Nouveau Réalisme artist Yves Klein wrote &quot;The Monotone Symphony&quot; (formally &quot;The Monotone-Silence Symphony&quot;, conceived 1947–1948), a 40-minute orchestral piece that consisted of a single 20-minute sustained chord (followed by a 20-minute silence)—showing how the sound of one drone could make music. Also in 1949, Pierre Boulez befriended John Cage, who was visiting Paris to do research on the music of Erik Satie. John Cage had been pushing music in even more startling directions during the war years, writing for prepared piano, junkyard percussion, and electronic gadgetry.

In 1951, Cage&#x27;s &quot;Imaginary Landscape #4&quot;, a work for twelve radio receivers, was premiered in New York. Performance of the composition necessitated the use of a score that contained indications for various wavelengths, durations, and dynamic levels, all of which had been determined using chance operations.
A year later in 1952, Cage applied his aleatoric methods to tape-based composition. Also in 1952, Karlheinz Stockhausen completed a modest musique concrète student piece entitled &quot;Etude&quot;. Cage&#x27;s work resulted in his famous work &quot;Williams Mix&quot;, which was made up of some six hundred tape fragments arranged according to the demands of the &quot;I Ching&quot;. Cage&#x27;s early radical phase reached its height that summer of 1952, when he unveiled the first art &quot;happening&quot; at Black Mountain College, and &quot;4&#x27;33&quot;&quot;, the so-called controversial &quot;silent piece&quot;. The premiere of &quot;4&#x27;33&quot;&quot; was performed by David Tudor. The audience saw him sit at the piano, and close the lid of the piano. Some time later, without having played any notes, he opened the lid. A while after that, again having played nothing, he closed the lid. And after a period of time, he opened the lid once more and rose from the piano. The piece had passed without a note being played, in fact without Tudor or anyone else on stage having made any deliberate sound, although he timed the lengths on a stopwatch while turning the pages of the score. Only then could the audience recognize what Cage insisted upon: that there is no such thing as silence. Noise is always happening that makes musical sound. In 1957, Edgard Varèse created on tape an extended piece of electronic music using noises created by scraping, thumping and blowing titled &quot;Poème électronique&quot;.

In 1960, John Cage completed his noise composition &quot;Cartridge Music&quot; for phono cartridges with foreign objects replacing the &#x27;stylus&#x27; and small sounds amplified by contact microphones. Also in 1960, Nam June Paik composed &quot;Fluxusobjekt&quot; for fixed tape and hand-controlled tape playback head. On May 8, 1960, six young Japanese musicians, including Takehisa Kosugi and Yasunao Tone, formed the Group Ongaku with two tape recordings of noise music: &quot;Automatism&quot; and &quot;Object&quot;. These recordings made use of a mixture of traditional musical instruments along with a vacuum cleaner, a radio, an oil drum, a doll, and a set of dishes. Moreover, the speed of the tape recording was manipulated, further distorting the sounds being recorded. Canada&#x27;s Nihilist Spasm Band, the world&#x27;s longest-running noise act, was formed in 1965 in London, Ontario, and continues to perform and record to this day, having survived to work with many of the newer generation which they themselves had influenced, such as Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth and Jojo Hiroshige of Hijokaidan. In 1967, Musica Elettronica Viva, a live acoustic/electronic improvisational group formed in Rome, made a recording titled &quot;SpaceCraft&quot; using contact microphones on such &quot;non-musical&quot; objects as panes of glass and motor oil cans that was recorded at the Akademie der Kunste in Berlin. At the end of the sixties, they took part in the collective noise action called &quot;Lo Zoo&quot; initiated by the artist Michelangelo Pistoletto.

The art critic Rosalind Krauss argued that by 1968 artists such as Robert Morris, Robert Smithson, and Richard Serra had &quot;entered a situation the logical conditions of which can no longer be described as modernist.&quot; Sound art found itself in the same condition, but with an added emphasis on distribution. Antiform process art became the terms used to describe this postmodern post-industrial culture and the process by which it is made. Serious art music responded to this conjuncture in terms of intense noise, for example the La Monte Young Fluxus composition &quot;89 VI 8 C. 1:42–1:52 AM Paris Encore&quot; from &quot;Poem For Chairs, Tables, Benches, Etc.&quot; Young&#x27;s composition &quot;Two Sounds&quot; (1960) was composed for amplified percussion and window panes and his &quot;Poem for Tables, Chairs and Benches, Etc.&quot; (1960) used the sounds of furniture scraping across the floor. AllMusic assessed 1960s English experimental group AMM as originators of electronica, free improvisation and noise music, writing that &quot;noise bands owe it to themselves to check out their primary source.&quot;

===Popular music===

&quot;Freak Out!&quot;, the 1966 debut album by the Mothers of Invention made use of avant-garde sound collage—particularly the closing track &quot;The Return of the Son of Monster Magnet&quot;. The same year, art rock group the Velvet Underground made their first recording while produced by Andy Warhol, a track entitled &quot;Noise&quot;. AllMusic assessed the Godz as an early noise band: &quot;the three squalling bits of avant-garde noise/junk they recorded from 1966–1968.

&quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; is the final track of the Beatles&#x27; 1966 studio album &quot;Revolver&quot;; credited as a Lennon–McCartney song, it was written primarily by John Lennon with major contributions to the arrangement by Paul McCartney. The track included looped tape effects. For the track, McCartney supplied a bag of -inch audio tape loops he had made at home after listening to Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot;. By disabling the erase head of a tape recorder and then spooling a continuous loop of tape through the machine while recording, the tape would constantly overdub itself, creating a saturation effect, a technique also used in musique concrète. The Beatles would continue these efforts with &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, a track produced in 1968 for &quot;The White Album&quot;. It made sole use of sound collage, credited to Lennon–McCartney, but created primarily by John Lennon with assistance from George Harrison and Yoko Ono. In 2013, post-conceptual artist Rutherford Chang released a double vinyl noise music record, in a limited edition of 800, called &quot;White Album x 100&quot; made by layering 100 copies of the Beatles’ 1968 double LP &quot;The White Album&quot; playing simultaneously.

In 1967 the Jefferson Airplane released a noisy sound collage called &quot;A Small Package Of Value Will Come To You, Shortly&quot; on their album &quot;After Bathing at Baxter&#x27;s&quot;. In 1975, Ned Lagin released an album of electronic noise music full of spacey rumblings and atmospherics filled with burps and bleeps entitled &quot;Seastones&quot; on Round Records. The album was recorded in stereo quadraphonic sound and featured guest performances by members of the Grateful Dead, including Jerry Garcia playing treated guitar and Phil Lesh playing electronic Alembic bass. David Crosby, Grace Slick and other members of the Jefferson Airplane also appear on the album.

==1970s–present==
===Noise rock and no wave===

Lou Reed&#x27;s double LP &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; (1975) is cited as containing the primary characteristics of what would in time become a genre known as noise music. The album, recorded on a three speed Uher machine and mastered/engineered by Bob Ludwig, is an early, well-known example of commercial studio noise music that the music critic Lester Bangs has sarcastically called the &quot;greatest album ever made in the history of the human eardrum&quot;. It has also been cited as one of the &quot;worst albums of all time&quot;. In 1975, RCA also released a Quadrophonic version of the &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; recording that was produced by playing the master tape back both forward and backward, and by flipping the tape over. Reed was well aware of the drone music of La Monte Young and cites him as a major influence on &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;. Young&#x27;s Theatre of Eternal Music was a proto-minimal music noise group in the mid-60s with John Cale, Marian Zazeela, Henry Flynt, Angus Maclise, Tony Conrad, and others. The Theatre of Eternal Music&#x27;s discordant sustained notes and loud amplification had influenced Cale&#x27;s subsequent contribution to the Velvet Underground in his use of both discordance and feedback. Cale and Conrad have released noise music recordings they made during the mid-sixties, such as Cale&#x27;s &quot;Inside the Dream Syndicate&quot; series (&quot;The Dream Syndicate&quot; being the alternative name given by Cale and Conrad to their collective work with Young). Krautrock bands such as Neu! and Faust would incorporate noise into their compositions. Roni Sarig, author of &quot;The Secret History of Rock&quot; called Can&#x27;s sophomore album Tago Mago &quot;as close as it ever got to avant-garde noise music.&quot;

The aptly named noise rock fuses rock to noise, usually with recognizable &quot;rock&quot; instrumentation, but with greater use of distortion and electronic effects, varying degrees of atonality, improvisation, and white noise. One notable band of this genre is Sonic Youth, who took inspiration from the No Wave composers Glenn Branca and Rhys Chatham (himself a student of La Monte Young). Marc Masters, in his book on the No Wave, points out that aggressively innovative early dark noise groups like Mars and DNA drew on punk rock, avant-garde minimalism and performance art. Important in this noise trajectory are the nine nights of noise music called &quot;Noise Fest&quot; that was organized by Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth in the NYC art space White Columns in June 1981 followed by the &quot;Speed Trials&quot; noise rock series organized by Live Skull members in May 1983.
===Industrial music===
In the 1970s, the concept of art itself expanded and groups like Survival Research Laboratories, Borbetomagus and Elliott Sharp embraced and extended the most dissonant and least approachable aspects of these musical/spatial concepts. Around the same time, the first postmodern wave of industrial noise music appeared with the Pop Group, Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, and NON (aka Boyd Rice). These cassette culture releases often featured zany tape editing, stark percussion and repetitive loops distorted to the point where they may degrade into harsh noise. In the 1970s and 1980s, industrial noise groups like Killing Joke, Throbbing Gristle, Mark Stewart &amp; the Mafia, Coil, Laibach, Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, Smegma, Nurse with Wound and Einstürzende Neubauten performed industrial noise music mixing loud metal percussion, guitars, and unconventional &quot;instruments&quot; (such as jackhammers and bones) in elaborate stage performances. These industrial artists experimented with varying degrees of noise production techniques. Interest in the use of shortwave radio also developed at this time, particularly evident in the recordings and live performances of John Duncan. Other postmodern art movements influential to post-industrial noise art are Conceptual Art and the Neo-Dada use of techniques such as assemblage, montage, bricolage, and appropriation. Bands like Test Dept, Clock DVA, Factrix, Autopsia, Nocturnal Emissions, Whitehouse, Severed Heads, Sutcliffe Jügend, and SPK soon followed.
The sudden post-industrial affordability of home cassette recording technology in the 1970s, combined with the simultaneous influence of punk rock, established the No Wave aesthetic, and instigated what is commonly referred to as noise music today.&lt;ref name=&quot;organisational autonomy / extra-musical elements&quot;&gt;Media.hyperreal.org, &quot;Prehistory of Industrial Music&quot; 1995 Brian Duguid, esp. chapter &quot;Organisational Autonomy / Extra-Musical Elements&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese noise music===
Since the early 1980s, Japan has produced a significant output of characteristically harsh artists and bands, sometimes referred to as &quot;Japanoise&quot;, with names such as Government Alpha, Alienlovers in Amagasaki and Koji Tano, and perhaps the best known being Merzbow (pseudonym for the Japanese noise artist Masami Akita who himself was inspired by the Dada artist Kurt Schwitters&#x27;s &quot;Merz&quot; art project of psychological collage). In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Akita took &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; as a point of departure and further abstracted the noise aesthetic by freeing the sound from guitar based feedback alone. According to Hegarty (2007), &quot;in many ways it only makes sense to talk of noise music since the advent of various types of noise produced in Japanese music, and in terms of quantity this is really to do with the 1990s onwards ... with the vast growth of Japanese noise, finally, noise music becomes a genre&quot;. Other key Japanese noise artists that contributed to this upsurge of activity include Hijokaidan, Boredoms, C.C.C.C., Incapacitants, KK Null, Yamazaki Maso&#x27;s Masonna, Solmania, K2, the Gerogerigegege and Hanatarash. Nick Cain of &quot;The Wire&quot; identifies the &quot;primacy of Japanese Noise artists like Merzbow, Hijokaidan and Incapacitants&quot; as one of the major developments in noise music since 1990.

<doc id="87598" wikidata="Q25292" url="?curid=87598" title="Date palm">
<text>Phoenix dactylifera, commonly known as the date palm, is a flowering-plant species in the palm family Arecaceae, cultivated for its edible sweet fruit called dates. The species is widely cultivated across northern Africa, the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, Australia, South Asia, and California. It is naturalized in many tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. &quot;P. dactylifera&quot; is the type species of genus &quot;Phoenix&quot;, which contains 12–19 species of wild date palms.

Date palms reach up to in height, growing singly or forming a clump with several stems from a single root system. Slow-growing, they can reach over 100years of age when maintained properly. Date fruits (dates) are oval-cylindrical, long, and about in diameter, with colour ranging from dark brown to bright red or yellow, depending on variety. Containing 61–68percent sugar by mass when dried, dates are consumed as sweet snacks on their own or with confections.

There is archaeological evidence of date cultivation in Arabia from the 6thmillennium BCE. Dates are &quot;emblematic of oasis agriculture and highly symbolic in Muslim, Christian, and Jewish religions&quot;.

== Description ==

Date palms reach up to in height, growing singly or forming a clump with several stems from a single root system. Slow-growing, they can reach over 100 years of age when maintained properly. The roots have pneumatodes. The leaves are long, with spines on the petiole, and pinnate, with about 150 leaflets. The leaflets are long and wide. The full span of the crown ranges from .

The date palm is dioecious, having separate male and female plants. Like all members of genus Phoenix, sex determination occurs through an XY sex-determination system, where three genes that are conserved in all males and absent in all females have been identified. They can be easily grown from seed, but only 50% of seedlings will be female and hence fruit-bearing, and dates from seedling plants are often smaller and of poorer quality. Most commercial plantations thus use cuttings of heavily cropping cultivars. Plants grown from cuttings will fruit 2–3 years earlier than seedling plants.

Dates are naturally wind-pollinated, but in traditional oasis horticulture and modern commercial orchards, they are entirely hand-pollinated. Natural pollination occurs with about an equal number of male and female plants. With assistance, one male can pollinate up to 100 females. Since the males are of value only as pollinators, they are usually pruned in favor of fruit-producing female plants. Some growers do not maintain male plants, as male flowers become available at local markets at pollination time. Manual pollination is done by skilled labourers on ladders, or by use of a wind machine. In some areas, such as Iraq, the pollinator climbs the tree using a special climbing tool that wraps around the tree trunk and the climber&#x27;s back (called in Arabic) to keep him attached to the trunk while climbing.

Date fruits are oval-cylindrical, long, and diameter, and when ripe, range from bright red to bright yellow in colour, depending on variety. Dates contain a single stone (seed) about long and thick. Three main cultivar groups exist: &quot;soft&quot; (e.g., Medjool); &quot;semi-dry&quot; (e.g., Deglet Noor), and &quot;dry&quot; (e.g., Thoory).

=== Genome ===
A draft genome of &quot;P. dactylifera&quot; (Khalas variety) was published in 2011 followed by more complete genome assemblies in 2013 and 2019. The later study used long-read sequencing technology. With the release of this improved genome assembly, the researchers were able to map genes for fruit color and sugar content. The NYU Abu Dhabi researchers had also re-sequenced the genomes of several date varieties to develop the first single nucleotide polymorphism map of the date palm genome in 2015.

== Etymology ==
The species name &quot;dactylifera&quot; &#x27;date-bearing&#x27; is Latin, and is formed with the loanword in Latin from Greek (), which means &#x27;date&#x27; (also &#x27;finger&#x27;),&lt;ref name=&quot;LSJ|da/ktulos|δάκτυλος|ref&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and with the native Latin , which means &#x27;to bear&#x27;. The fruit is known as a date. The fruit&#x27;s English name (through Old French, through Latin) comes from the Greek word for &#x27;finger&#x27;, , because of the fruit&#x27;s elongated shape.

== Distribution ==
The place of origin of the date palm is uncertain because of long cultivation. According to some sources it probably originated from the Fertile Crescent region straddling Egypt and Mesopotamia while others state that they are native to the Persian Gulf area. Fossil records show that the date palm has existed for at least 50 million years.

== Ecology ==
A major palm pest, the red palm beetle (&quot;Rhynchophorus ferrugineus&quot;), currently poses a significant threat to date production in parts of the Middle East as well as to iconic landscape specimens throughout the Mediterranean world. Another significant insect pest is &quot;Ommatissus lybicus&quot;, sometimes called the &quot;dubas bug&quot;, whose sap sucking results in sooty mould formation.

In the 1920s, eleven healthy Medjool palms were transferred from Morocco to the United States where they were tended by members of the Chemehuevi tribe in a remote region of Nevada. Nine of these survived and in 1935, cultivars were transferred to the U.S. Date Garden in Indio, California. Eventually this stock was reintroduced to Africa and led to the U.S. production of dates in Yuma, Arizona and Bard, California.

==Cultivation==
Dates are a traditional crop throughout the Middle East and North Africa. Dates (especially Medjool and Deglet Nour) are also cultivated in the southwestern United States, and in Sonora and Baja California in Mexico.

Date palms can take 4 to 8 years after planting before they will bear fruit, and start producing viable yields for commercial harvest between 7 and 10 years. Mature date palms can produce of dates per harvest season. They do not all ripen at the same time so several harvests are required. To obtain fruit of marketable quality, the bunches of dates must be thinned and bagged or covered before ripening so that the remaining fruits grow larger and are protected from weather and animals, such as birds, that also like to eat them.

Date palms require well-drained deep sandy loam soils with a pH of 8–11 (alkaline). The soil should have the ability to hold moisture and also be free of calcium carbonate.

===Agricultural history===
Dates have been cultivated in the Middle East and the Indus Valley for thousands of years, and there is archaeological evidence of date cultivation in Mehrgarh, a Neolithic civilization in western Pakistan, around 7000 BCE and in eastern Arabia between 5530 and 5320 calBC. Dates have been cultivated since ancient times from Mesopotamia to prehistoric Egypt. The ancient Egyptians used the fruits to make date wine and ate dates at harvest. Evidence of cultivation is continually found throughout later civilizations in the Indus Valley, including the Harappan period from 2600 to 1900 BCE.

One cultivar, the Judean date palm, is renowned for its long-lived orthodox seed, which successfully sprouted after accidental storage for 2,000 years. In total seven seeds about 2000 years old have sprouted and turned into trees named Methuselah, Hannah, Adam, Judith, Boaz, Jonah and Uriel. The upper survival time limit of properly stored seeds remains unknown. A genomic study from New York University Abu Dhabi Center for Genomics and Systems Biology showed that domesticated date palm varieties from North Africa, including well-known varieties such as Medjool and Deglet Nour, share large parts of their genome with Middle East date palms and the Cretan wild palms, &quot;P. theophrasti&quot;, as well as Indian wild palms, &quot;Phoenix sylvestris&quot;.

An article on date palm tree cultivation is contained in Ibn al-&#x27;Awwam&#x27;s 12th-century agricultural work, &quot;Book on Agriculture&quot;.
=== Cultivars ===

A large number of date cultivars and varieties emerged through history of its cultivation, but the exact number is difficult to assess. Hussain and El-Zeid (1975) have reported 400 varieties, while Nixon (1954) named around 250. Most of those are limited to a particular region, and only a few dozen have attained broader commercial importance. The most renowned cultivars worldwide include Deglet Noor, originally of Algeria; Yahidi and Hallawi of Iraq; Medjool of Morocco; Mazafati of Iran.

== Production ==
In 2022, world production of dates was 9.7 million tonnes, led by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Algeria accounting for 46% of the total (table).
== Nutrition ==
Date palm fruits contain 21% water, 75% carbohydrates (63% sugars and 8% dietary fiber), 2% protein, and less than 1% fat (table). In a reference amount, dates supply of food energy, and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of potassium (22% DV) and a moderate source of pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, and the dietary minerals magnesium and manganese (10–19% DV), with other micronutrients in low amounts (table).

The primary carbohydrates are monosaccharides, comprising glucose (23–30%), fructose (19–28%), and non-starch polysaccharides (7–10%) of the fruit&#x27;s total weight. The sucrose content is negligible.

The glycemic index (GI) for different varieties of the date palm fruit is in the range of 38–71, with 53 on average, indicating dates are a relatively low GI food source. The glycemic load (GL) value of date palm fruits, calculated for a serving size of three fruits (weighting 27 grams) is 9 on average, indicating that dates have low GL.

== Uses ==
=== Fruits ===
Dry or soft dates are eaten out-of-hand, or may be pitted and stuffed with fillings such as almonds, walnuts, pecans, candied orange and lemon peel, tahini, marzipan or cream cheese. Pitted dates are also referred to as &quot;stoned dates&quot;. Partially dried pitted dates may be glazed with glucose syrup for use as a snack food. Dates can also be chopped and used in a range of sweet and savory dishes, from tajines (tagines) in Morocco to puddings, &quot;ka&#x27;ak&quot; (types of Arab cookies) and other dessert items. Date nut bread, a type of cake, is very popular in the United States, especially around holidays. Dates are also processed into cubes, paste called &quot;&#x27;ajwa&quot;, spread, date syrup or &quot;honey&quot; called &quot;dibs&quot; or &quot;rub&quot; in Libya, powder (date sugar), vinegar or alcohol. Vinegar made from dates was a traditional product of the Middle East. Recent innovations include chocolate-covered dates and products such as sparkling date juice, used in some Islamic countries as a non-alcoholic version of champagne, for special occasions and religious times such as Ramadan. When Muslims break fast in the evening meal of Ramadan, it is traditional to eat a date first.

Reflecting the maritime trading heritage of Britain, imported chopped dates are added to, or form the main basis of a variety of traditional dessert recipes including sticky toffee pudding, Christmas pudding and date and walnut loaf. They are particularly available to eat whole at Christmas time. Dates are one of the ingredients of HP Sauce, a popular British condiment.

In Southeast Spain (where a large date plantation exists including UNESCO-protected Palmeral of Elche) dates (usually pitted with fried almond) are served wrapped in bacon and shallow-fried. In Palestine date syrup, termed &quot;silan&quot;, is used while cooking chicken and also for sweets and desserts, and as a honey substitute. Dates are one of the ingredients of &quot;jallab&quot;, a Middle Eastern fruit syrup. In Pakistan, a viscous, thick syrup made from the ripe fruits is used as a coating for leather bags and pipes to prevent leaking.

==== Forks ====

In the past, sticky dates were served using specialized small forks having two metal tines, called &quot;daddelgaffel&quot; in Scandinavia. Some designs were patented. These have generally been replaced by an inexpensive pale-colored knobbled plastic fork that resembles a date branch, which is traditionally included with numerous brands of prepackaged trays of dates, though this practice has declined in response to increased use of resealable packaging and calls for fewer single-use plastics.

=== Seeds ===
Date seeds are soaked and ground up for animal feed. Their oil is suitable for use in cosmetics and dermatological applications. The oil contains lauric acid (36%) and oleic acid (41%). Date palm seeds contain 0.56–5.4% lauric acid. They can also be processed chemically as a source of oxalic acid. Date seeds are also ground and used in the manner of coffee beans, or as an additive to coffee. Experimental studies have shown that feeding mice with the aqueous extract of date pits exhibit anti-genotoxic effects and reduce DNA damage induced by N-nitroso-N-methylurea.

=== Fruit clusters ===
Stripped fruit clusters are used as brooms. Recently, the floral stalks have been found to be of ornamental value in households.

=== Sap ===
Apart from &quot;P. dactylifera&quot;, wild date palms such as &quot;Phoenix sylvestris&quot; and &quot;Phoenix reclinata&quot;, depending on the region, can be also tapped for sap.

The consumption of raw date palm sap is one of the means by which the deadly Nipah virus spreads from bats to humans. The virus can be inactivated by boiling the sap down to molasses. (In Malaysia, by contrast, 
the vector was found to be factory farming of pigs.)

=== Leaves ===
In North Africa, date palm leaves are commonly used for making huts. Mature leaves are also made into mats, screens, baskets, and fans. Processed leaves can be used for insulating board. Dried leaf petioles are a source of cellulose pulp, used for walking sticks, brooms, fishing floats, and fuel. Leaf sheaths are prized for their scent, and fibre from them is also used for rope, coarse cloth, and large hats.

Young date leaves are cooked and eaten as a vegetable, as is the terminal bud or heart, though its removal kills the palm. The finely ground seeds are mixed with flour to make bread in times of scarcity. The flowers of the date palm are also edible. Traditionally the female flowers are the most available for sale and weigh . The flower buds are used in salad or ground with dried fish to make a condiment for bread.

== In culture ==
In Ancient Rome, the palm fronds used in triumphal processions to symbolize victory were most likely those of &quot;P. dactylifera&quot;. The date palm was a popular garden plant in Roman peristyle gardens, though it would not bear fruit in the more temperate climate of Italy. It is recognizable in frescoes from Pompeii and elsewhere in Italy, including a garden scene from the House of the Wedding of Alexander. In later times, traders spread dates around southwest Asia, northern Africa, and Spain. Dates were introduced into California by the Spaniards by 1769, existing by then around Mission San Diego de Alcalá, and were introduced to Mexico as early as the 16th century.

Dates are mentioned more than 50 times in the Bible and 20 times in the Quran. Date palms holds great significance in Abrahamic religions. The tree was heavily cultivated as a food source in ancient Israel where Judaism and subsequently Christianity developed. Date palm leaves are used for Palm Sunday in the Christian religion.

Many Jewish scholars believe that the &quot;honey&quot; reference in Exodus chapter 3 to &quot;a land flowing with milk and honey&quot; is actually a reference to date &quot;honey&quot;, and not honey from bees. In the Torah, palm trees are referenced as symbols of prosperity and triumph. Psalm 92:12 states that &quot;The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree.&quot; Palm branches occurred as iconography in sculpture ornamenting the Second Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, on Jewish coins, and in the sculpture of synagogues. They are also used as ornamentation in the Feast of the Tabernacles. Date palms are one of the seven species of native Israeli plants revered in Judaism. The date palm has historically been considered a symbol of Judea and the Jewish people. The leaves are used as a lulav in the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. They are also commonly used as the s&#x27;chach in the construction of a sukkah.

In the Quran, Allah instructs &quot;Maryām&quot; (the Virgin Mary) to eat dates during labour pains when she gives birth to Isa (Jesus). In Islamic culture, dates and yogurt or milk are traditionally the first foods consumed for Iftar after the sun has set during Ramadan.

In Mandaeism, the date palm (Mandaic: , which can refer to both the tree and its fruit) symbolizes the cosmic tree and is often associated with the cosmic wellspring (Mandaic: ). The date palm, associated with masculinity, and wellspring, associated with femininity, are often mentioned together as heavenly symbols in Mandaean texts.
