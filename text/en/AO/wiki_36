<text>Prince Valiant in the Days of King Arthur, often simply called Prince Valiant, is an American comic strip created by Hal Foster in 1937. It is an epic adventure that has told a continuous story during its entire history, and the full stretch of that story now totals more than 4500 Sunday strips. The strip appears weekly in more than 300 American newspapers, according to its distributor, King Features Syndicate.

As the Duke of Windsor, Edward VIII called &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; the &quot;greatest contribution to English literature in the past hundred years&quot;. Generally regarded by comics historians as one of the most impressive visual creations ever syndicated, the strip is noted for its realistically rendered panoramas and the intelligent, sometimes humorous, narrative. The format does not employ word balloons. Instead, the story is narrated in captions positioned at the bottom or sides of panels. Events depicted are taken from various time periods, from the late Roman Empire to the High Middle Ages, with a few brief scenes from modern times (commenting on the &quot;manuscript&quot;).

While drawing the &quot;Tarzan&quot; comic strip, Foster wanted to do his own original newspaper feature, and he began work on a strip he called &quot;Derek, Son of Thane&quot;, later changing the title to &quot;Prince Arn&quot;. King Features manager Joseph Connolly eventually renamed it &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;. In 1936, after extensive research, Foster pitched his concept to William Randolph Hearst, who had long wanted to distribute a strip by Foster. Hearst was so impressed that he gave Foster ownership of the strip.

&quot;Prince Valiant&quot; began in full-color tabloid sections on Saturday February 13, 1937. The first full page was strip #16, which appeared in the Sunday &quot;New Orleans Times Picayune&quot;. The internal dating changed from Saturday to Sunday with strip #66 (May 15, 1938). The full-page strip continued until 1971, when strip #1788 was not offered in full-page format—it was the last strip Foster drew. The strip continues today by other artists in a half-page format.

==Characters and story==

The setting is Arthurian. Valiant (Val) is a Nordic prince from Thule, located near present-day Trondheim on the Norwegian coast. Early in the story Valiant arrives at Camelot where he becomes friends with Sir Gawain and Sir Tristram. Earning the respect of King Arthur and Merlin, he becomes a Knight of the Round Table. On a Mediterranean island he meets the love of his life, Aleta, Queen of the Misty Isles, whom he later marries. He fights the Huns with his powerful Singing Sword, which, in a 1939 strip, a witch identifies with the legendary sword Flamberge, a magical blade apparently created by the same enchanter who forged Arthur&#x27;s Excalibur. Val travels to Africa and America and later helps his father regain his lost throne of Thule, which has been usurped by the tyrant Sligon.

When the strip starts in 1937, Val is five years old. The first episodes follow the youth through the wild Fens district of Britain with his father, the deposed King Aguar of Thule. When Val encounters the witch Horrit, she predicts he will have a life of adventure, but he will never be happy or content. Arriving home, Val discovers that his mother has died. Not long after this come encounters with Gawain, with gigantic creatures and with the glory of Camelot. Steve Donoghue comments:

Val acquires the Singing Sword in strips from 1938. The original owner of the Singing Sword is Prince Arn of Ord, Valiant&#x27;s rival for the maid Ilene. The two men put aside their differences when Ilene is kidnapped by Viking raiders on her way to Ord. Arn hands Valiant the charmed sword to help him hold back their pursuers while he himself rides ahead to free Ilene. The pair continue in their efforts to rescue Ilene, eventually discovering that she has been killed in a shipwreck. Arn gives the Singing Sword to Valiant after that adventure and the two part as friends. Later in the series it is mentioned that the Singing Sword is a sister to King Arthur&#x27;s Excalibur.

In the strips from 1939 Val is knighted by King Arthur, and the following year, he helps to restore his father as King of Thule. Moving across Britain, Europe, and the Holy Land, Val fights invading Goths, Huns and Saxons. In 1946, shortly after Val marries Aleta, she is kidnapped by the Viking raider Ulfran. Val&#x27;s pursuit takes him past the Shetland Islands, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, Newfoundland and the Saint Lawrence River, arriving at Niagara Falls 1,000 years before Columbus. Defeating Ulfran, Val is reunited with Aleta, and the couple spend that winter with friendly Native Americans.

In the strip dated August 31, 1947, Prince Arn, their first son, is born in America, and Val celebrates by getting drunk. The infant Arn is named after Val&#x27;s old friend, Prince Arn of Ord. Val and Aleta&#x27;s other children are the twins, Karen and Valeta (born 1951), Galan (1962) and Prince Nathan (1979). Agents of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian abduct Nathan shortly after his birth, and he is eventually rescued by Arn. Earlier, in strips from 1964, Arn leads an expedition to America. In strips from 1987 Val becomes a grandfather when Arn and his wife, Maeve, daughter of the traitorous Mordred, give birth to Ingrid.

==History and myth==
The historical and mythological elements of &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; were initially haphazard, but soon Foster attempted to bring the facts into order. Many elements of the story place it in the fifth century, such as the death of Attila the Hun in 453 and Geiseric&#x27;s sacking of Rome in 455, which Prince Valiant and Aleta witness. The murder of Aëtius in 454 differs from the historical version; Valiant and Gawain are blamed for the murder and must flee.

Slightly fantastic elements, like &quot;marsh monsters&quot; (a dinosaur-like creature) and witches, were present in the early years but were later downplayed (as was Merlin&#x27;s and Morgan le Fay&#x27;s use of magic), so that by 1942, the story became more realistic.

The storyline is by no means historically accurate. While obviously meant to take place during the Later Roman Empire, Foster incorporated anachronistic elements: Viking longships, knights, Muslims, alchemists and technological advances not made before the Renaissance. The fortifications, dresses, armor and armament resemble the High Middle Ages rather than the fifth century.

==Other artists==

In 1970, after tryout strips by several artists, Foster invited John Cullen Murphy to collaborate on the strip. Here is a list of the transition artists:
* #1756 Foster
* #1757 Gray Morrow
* #1758 Foster
* #1759 Foster
* #1760 Murphy
* #1761 Foster
* #1762 Wally Wood
* #1763 Foster
* #1764 Murphy
* #1765 Gray Morrow
* #1766 Murphy
* #1767 Gray Morrow
* #1768 Foster
* #1769 Murphy
* #1770 Gray Morrow
* #1771–1772 Murphy
* #1773 Foster
* #1774–1775 Murphy
* #1776 Foster
* #1777 Gray Morrow
* #1778–1779 Murphy
* #1780 Gray Morrow
* #1781–1787 Murphy
* #1788 Foster (last)
* #1789–3502 Murphy

From 1971 on, Murphy drew the strip from Foster scripts and pencil sketches. Foster continued to write the continuity until strip #2241 in 1980. Murphy then drew it solo with scripts by his son Cullen Murphy, an editor of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. Stories by Cullen Murphy included many adventures in which Val is opposed by the Emperor Justinian. John Cullen Murphy&#x27;s daughter, Mairead, did the lettering and coloring. In March 2004, Murphy retired and turned the strip over to his chosen successor, illustrator Gary Gianni. Scripting duties were passed on to Mark Schultz with Scott Roberts providing the coloring. Schultz continued as the writer when Thomas Yeates began as the strip&#x27;s artist on April 1, 2012.

==Awards==
Hal Foster was recognized for his work on the strip with the Banshees&#x27; Silver Lady award in 1952, followed by the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Reuben Award in 1957, their Story Comic Strip Award in 1964, their Special Features Award in 1966 and 1967, the Gold Key award in 1977, and the Elzie Segar Award in 1978. He was inducted into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame in 1996, and in 2005 he was inducted into the Joe Shuster Canadian Comic Book Creators Hall of Fame for his contributions to comic books. In 2006, Foster was inducted into the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame. At age 73, Foster was elected to membership in Great Britain&#x27;s Royal Society of Arts, an honor given to very few Americans.

Murphy received the National Cartoonists Society Story Comic Strip Award for his work on the strip in 1971, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1984 and 1987. In 1995, the strip was one of 20 included in the Comic Strip Classics series of commemorative postage stamps.

In 1999, &quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine named the &quot;Prince Valiant Role-playing Game&quot; as one of &quot;The Millennium&#x27;s Most Underrated Games&quot;. Editor Scott Haring commented that &quot;&quot;Prince Valiant&quot; was designed as a beginner&#x27;s introduction to roleplaying... Perhaps the subject matter&#x27;s perceived lack of &#x27;cool&#x27; killed this game, but it deserved better&quot;. In 2016, Stewart Wieck used crowdfunding platform Kickstarter to reprint the game.

==Cultural references==

* The &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; haircut, a variant of the pageboy resembling Val&#x27;s, was once popular, particularly for children.
* Harvey Kurtzman and Wally Wood satirized the strip with &quot;Prince Violent&quot; in &quot;Mad&quot; #13 (July 1954), which ends in Violent losing his page-boy haircut to &quot;the fair maid Alota&quot; in the best of all causes.
* Prince Valiant once used the guise of a demon, and that costume was an inspiration to Jack Kirby for his character Etrigan the Demon. The same panel also inspired the Italian creative team EsseGesse on their comic series &quot;Kinowa&quot;.
* Bugs Bunny parodied the strip in &quot;Prince Violent&quot; (renamed &quot;Prince Varmint&quot; for television release) with Bugs defending a castle against Viking raider Yosemite Sam.
* In the Academy Award-winning short &quot;Knighty Knight Bugs&quot;, King Arthur sends court jester Bugs to recover the Singing Sword from the Black Knight, portrayed by Yosemite Sam in black armor.
* Dave Sim did a weekly &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; parody, &quot;Silverspoon&quot;, in &quot;The Buyer&#x27;s Guide to Comics Fandom&quot;. The strip employed Foster&#x27;s illustrations-with-captions format. Sim&#x27;s comic book series &quot;Cerebus the Aardvark&quot; also contained a &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; parody with illustrations/captions.
* In &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, actor Jim J. Bullock plays Prince Valium, the consistently sleepy suitor of Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga), whom Vespa leaves at the altar.
* &quot;Valiant&quot;, the second episode in the first series of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Merlin&quot;, features a knight Valiant played by Will Mellor who dishonourably uses an enchanted shield and dies in a duel with Arthur during the tournament finale.
* Richard Marcinko in his autobiographical work &quot;Rogue Warrior&quot; notes that one of his men was given the call sign &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, or PV for short, as he had a hairstyle like the comic&#x27;s protagonist.
* Prince Valiant and Flash Gordon appear on the cover of the October 2009 Comics Revue, drawn by Mark Schultz..

<text>São Carlos (Saint Charles, in English, ; named after Saint Charles Borromeo) is a Brazilian municipality in the interior of the state of São Paulo, 254 kilometers from the city of São Paulo. With a population of 254,484 inhabitants, it is the 13th largest city in the state in terms of the number of residents, being almost in the center of the state of São Paulo. The municipality is formed by the headquarters and the districts of Água Vermelha, Bela Vista São-Carlense, Santa Eudóxia and Vila Nery.

The city is an important regional industrial center, with the economy based on industrial activities and farming, such as the production of sugar cane, orange, milk and chicken. Served by road and rail systems, São Carlos has a commercial unit of the Swiss multinational Leica Geosystems and production units of several multinational companies, including Volkswagen, Faber-Castell (the São Carlos subsidiary is the largest of the group in the world, producing 1.5 billion pencils per year), Electrolux, Tecumseh, Husqvarna, LATAM, Serasa Experian and Grupo Segurador BB-MAPFRE. Given local and, in some ways, regional needs, there is a network of commerce and services distributed in street stores, convenience stores and a mall of the Iguatemi network. In the field of research, besides the universities, two centers of technical development of Embrapa are present in the municipality. São Carlos is the first city in South America in numbers of doctors per inhabitant, according to a survey done since 2006 by UFSCar. In all, there are 1,700 PhDs, which represents one for every 135 inhabitants. In Brazil, the ratio is one PhD per 5423 inhabitants.

The city is home to several public higher education institutions, such as the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), two campi of the University of São Paulo (USP), the Federal Institute of São Paulo (IFSP) and FATEC, as well as a private higher education institution. This makes intense the university activity in the city, which affects the population count. For this reason, São Carlos has a floating population of more than twenty-nine thousand graduates and graduate students, mostly from other cities and states.

The city has several streets and avenues that pay homage to historical figures and important names for the city and Brazil. Some of the main streets with significant names include Avenida Doutor Carlos Botelho – named after Carlos Botelho, an important Brazilian physician and politician who was a relevant figure in the development of the city, and Rua Conde do Pinhal – named after the Count of Pinhal, Antônio Carlos de Arruda Botelho, one of the largest coffee producers in the region and a central figure in the history of São Carlos.

== History ==
The region started to be settled in the end of the 18th century, with the opening of a road that led to the gold mines in Cuiabá and Goiás. Leaving from Piracicaba, passing through Rio Claro, the hills, fields and by typical vegetations of the Brazilian countryside, settlers established in the region. São Carlos&#x27; history started in 1831, when the &quot;Pinhal&quot; (Pines) allotment was demarcated.

On the city&#x27;s foundation date, 4 November 1857, the population resided in some houses around the chapel and the inhabitants were mostly Arruda Botelho&#x27;s family heirs, who were the first owners of the &quot;Pinhal&quot; allotments. Between 1831 and 1857 the pioneer coffee farms were formed, starting the first economic activity in the city. The coffee crops came to the &quot;Pinhal&quot; farm in 1840 and spread throughout the fertile lands around, becoming the main export item. The city foundation is credited to Antônio Carlos de Arruda Botelho, Count of Pinhal, an influent farmer and entrepreneur.

São Carlos was elevated to village in 1865, when a &quot;Câmara&quot;, or ruling chamber, was created. In 1874, the village had 6,897 inhabitants, as a humble highlight of its fast growth and regional importance. It became a city in 1880 and in 1886, with a population of 16,104, its urban structure was settled.

The city arises on the coffee crops expansion context, which is relevant to the last two decades of the 19th century and to the first two of the 20th century. The arrival of the railway in 1884 provided an efficient system to transport the coffee production to the Santos harbor and boosted the economy of the region. The railway also contributed to the political and economic consolidation of the central area of the city.

When slavery ended, government created incentives to bring in immigrants. São Carlos had already received German nationals brought by the Count of Pinhal in 1876. Between 1880 and 1904, the city was one of the most important immigration centers in São Paulo state, the majority of them being Italians – specifically, Northern Italians. They worked in coffee plantations and in manufacturing factories, as well as trading activities.

In the beginning of the 20th century, countless cultural societies developed social activities aiming to promote literacy. Vittorio Emanuele Society in 1900 and Dante Alighieri in 1902 were but a few of them. The Italian presence was so significant that during the first half of the 20th century, the Italian government had a consulate branch in São Carlos.

With the Wall Street crash of 1929, coffee production went through a crisis, which made many immigrants leave rural areas for factories, wood artifact production, pottery, and construction.

Farmers had already applied the profits obtained with coffee in the constitution of several types of companies in São Carlos: banks, electricity, cable cars, telephones, water pumps, sewers, theaters, hospitals and schools. This established a foundation for industrialization in the city. With the arrival of immigrants from other urban centers from the 1930s – 1940s, their expertise was used to consolidate industrialization as the main economic activity in the city. Its peak years were the 1950s, when São Carlos became a manufacturing center, with relevant industrial expression in São Paulo state.

The industrial sector also developed through workshops that incorporated the coffee industry. The manufacture of processing machinery, shoes, fertilizers, hardware, furniture, pasta, cigars, as well as activities such as tailory, breweries, foundries, sawmills, weaving, pottery and pencil production expanded the economy of São Carlos in the 1930s. In the 1950s and 1960s, with the expansion of refrigeration, new factories of machinery and tractors arrived. Numerous small- and medium-sized companies which provided products and services were also established.

In the second half of the 20th century, the city received a boost of technological and higher educational development when in 1953 the Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos, or the Engineering School of the University of São Paulo, was created. In the 1970s, the Federal University of São Carlos was launched.

== Geography ==

São Carlos is located on the geographic center of the São Paulo state, approximately from the city of São Paulo. The city is the center of a microregion with 308,777 inhabitants.

Its altitude is over 856 m. Most of the year the city is windy and sunny, with hot temperatures during all the year.

The city has a total area of , which includes two districts to the north (&quot;Santa Eudóxia&quot; and &quot;Água Vermelha&quot;), one district to the west (&quot;Bela Vista São-carlense&quot;), and one district to the east (&quot;Vila Nery&quot;).

=== Geology ===
The municipality is included in the geomorphological province of the Basaltic and sandstone slopes, between the provinces of the Western Plateau (to the north) and the Paulista Periférica Depression (to the south). In São Carlos, included in the Paraná Basin, outcrops are found of the following geological formations: Bauru (Bauru Group), on the back of the slopes (Planalto de São Carlos), where the largest portion of the urban nucleus, further north; Serra Geral (São Bento Group), in the narrow region of slopes where relief occurs (slopes); Botucatu (São Bento Group), which contains the lower part of the slopes, further south, besides including the Guarani Aquifer. The soil of the municipality consists mainly of, in descending order: red-yellow latosol (LV); purple latosol (LR); deep quartz sand (AQ); dark red latosol (LE); structured purple earth (ET); only lithographic (Li); hydromorphic soil (Hi) and Podzolic soil (PV).

=== Vegetation ===
The original vegetation of the municipality, and the respective remnants, correspond respectively to: forest cerrado (cerradão, 16% and 2%); savanna (cerrado s.s., campo cerrado, campo campo) and campo (humid clean field); 27% and 2%); Atlantic Forest in the interior (semi-deciduous and riparian forests, 54% and 1%); Araucaria forest (semideciduous forest with araucaria, 1% and 0%) and capoeiras (degraded forests, 0% and 1%). Currently, much of the vegetation has been replaced by silvicultural plantations, Pastures and forestry. It should be remembered that, in the meantime, the proportions indicated above, partly obtained from interpretations of satellite images, have some uncertainty due to the difficulty of differentiating artificial grasses from natural clean fields. In a general view the savanna of Brazil.

In 2020 and 2021 the city was recognized in the international Urban Forest program &quot;Tree Cities of the World&quot; organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO/UN). According to the Ph.D. Urban Forester Daniel Caiche, this recognition promotes cities committed to planning and managing the Urban Forest.

=== Hydrography ===
The municipality is inserted between two Hydrographic Units of Water Resources Management (UGRHI): No. 9, Mogi-Guaçu, and No. 13, Tietê-Jacaré. The urban area is mainly located in the catchment area of the Monjolinho river, included, serially, in the Jacaré-Guaçu, Tietê, Paraná and La Plata river basins. The urban area is cut by the rivers Monjolinho, Gregório and Santa Maria do Leme, and the streams Tijuco Preto, Simeão, Agua Quente and Água Fria, among others. The basin of the Mojiguaçu river, which has the Quilombo river, Araras stream, Cabaceiras stream, Guabirobas stream, Jararaca stream, Água Branca stream, Brejo Grande stream or Água Vermelha stream, Matinha stream, Negro stream, Pântano stream, stream Waterfall.

The basin of the Jacaré-Guaçu river, which has the Monjolinho river, Feijão stream, Cã Cã stream, and Sour Orange stream. The basin of the Monjolinho river, which counts with the stream Santa Maria Magdalena (or stream Santa Maria do Leme), stream of the Jockey Club, stream Espraiado, stream Federal, stream Belvedere, stream Bridge of Tábua, stream Alto Monjolinho, stream Mineirinho, creek Santa Fé, Paraíso stream, Tijuco Preto stream, Gregório stream, Botafogo stream, Medeiros stream, Água Quente stream and Água Fria stream.

The Gregório stream basin, which tarts in a rural area to the east of the city in approximately 900 meters of altitude (where the Monjolinho river and the Negro river are born, important water courses of this municipality). It has as tributaries by the right bank the First Water stream near SP-310 before the Gregorio stream crosses the highway, Sorregotti stream near Educativa; Lazarini stream near Major Manuel Antonio de Matos Street, Biquinha stream in Visconde de Inhaúma Street (and on the left bank the Simeão stream in the (canalized) market region, and runs westward for approximately 7 km, where it flows into the Monjolinho river, near the shopping center.

=== Environment ===
Part of São Carlos is included in the Corumbataí Environmental Protection Area (APA). Other conservation units are nearby: Itirapina Ecological Station (EE), EE Mata do Jacaré, and EE Jataí. In rural areas, there are also fragments of important native vegetation in some private legal reserves (LR), such as Fazenda Canchim, by Embrapa. The city presents a percentage of regularized properties for LRs, above the average calculated for the state.

As for the Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs) of the rivers, many of those occurring in the urban area were irregularly occupied by marginal roads and buildings. However, little was done to compensate for the construction of these fringes, as well as to increase the minimum proportion of permeable area in adjacent plots. In addition, many rivers have been rectified or channeled, which are now considered inadequate. These factors, together, are determinant for the occurrence of floods in the city&#x27;s lowlands.

The urban afforestation of the urban road network is diverse, but in quantitative terms, the number of trees is still very low, and many have conflicts with surrounding public facilities, such as aerial wiring and paving. As for pollution, the municipality has about two dozen areas contaminated, in particular, by waste from fuel stations, and dumps and landfills

=== Climate ===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification, the city has a tropical climate Aw with dry winter and hot months

According to data from the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), since 1961 the lowest temperature recorded in São Carlos (conventional station of UFSCar) was 0,9 °C on 17 July 2000, and the highest reached 38.7 °C on 7 October 2020. The largest accumulated precipitation in 24 hours was 143.1 mm on 13 February 1980. The lowest relative air humidity index was 10%, recorded on 13 September 2010, 6 September 2011 and 16 September 2017 of that month.

== Economy ==
The city has an active industrial profile with important national and international industries and certain agricultural importance, backed by technologies developed by Embrapa, owner of two research complexes in the city. Due to its increasing number of high technology industries, the city has been proclaimed &quot;The National Capital of Technology&quot; by Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff in 2011.

The city hosts several locally-grown technology-based companies, such as Opto Eletrônicos, and factories of multinational corporations such as Faber Castell, Electrolux, Husqvarna, Tecumseh and the Brazilian plant of Volkswagen engines, and national corporations such as TAM MRO – Technology Center, Toalhas São Carlos, Tapetes São Carlos, Papel São Carlos, Prominas Brasil and Latina.

The economic basis of São Carlos is the tertiary sector. Commerce and services corresponds to 65.9% of the city&#x27;s GDP. Industry is also relevant. With 32.3% of the economy, the secondary sector has a bigger participation than the state of São Paulo&#x27;s average. The primary sector corresponds to 1.7% of the GDP.

== Culture ==
São Carlos is home to two Universidade de São Paulo campuses and the Universidade Federal de São Carlos (UFSCar), two of the most important higher learning centers in Brazil. Moreover, another minor and private university, Centro Universitário Central Paulista (UNICEP), is also based in São Carlos, and community colleges like SENAI, SESI, SESC, SENAC and the &quot;Escola Técnica Estadual Paulino Botelho&quot;. This has turned São Carlos into a university-oriented town, with an abundance of student-focused commercial establishments. It is also known for its student parties.

São Carlos&#x27; cultural life is marked by a young audience that enjoys musical concerts of Brazilian contemporary alternative artists that usually include the city in their tours. Also, São Carlos has 3 theaters and 7 commercial movie-theaters rooms.

<text>Harold Rudolf Foster, FRSA (August 16, 1892 – July 25, 1982) was a Canadian-American comic strip artist and writer best known as the creator of the comic strip &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;. His drawing style is noted for its high level of draftsmanship and attention to detail.

Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, Foster moved to the United States in 1921, and began his illustration career in Chicago, eventually becoming an American citizen. In 1928, he began one of the earliest adventure comic strips, an adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27;s &quot;Tarzan&quot;. In 1937, he created his signature strip, the weekly &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, a fantasy adventure set in medieval times. The strip featured Foster&#x27;s dexterous, detailed artwork; Foster eschewed word balloons, preferring to have narration and dialogue in captions.

==Early life==
Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Foster was a staff artist for Stovel, Commercial Art Co., W.M. Buckley Studio, and Brigdens Limited in Winnipeg. In 1919, Foster rode his bicycle to Chicago to see what the job market was like. He later moved there in 1921, and began working for the Jahn &amp; Ollier Engraving Co. Foster freely &quot;audited&quot; classes at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, a practice commonly made back then by poor students, which is confirmed by the fact that the Art Institute has no record of him taking formal classes. The illustrator J. C. Leyendecker was an early influence on Foster.

In 1925, Foster began working for the Chicago advertising studio Palenske-Young, Inc., and his clients were: Union Pacific Railroad, Johnson Outboard Motors, Wurlitzer Grand Pianos, Jelke Margarine, and the International Truck Company. In 1928, Palenske-Young was hired by Joseph Henry “Joe” Neebe, owner of &quot;Famous Books and Plays&quot;, to adapt the novel &quot;Tarzan&quot; by Edgar Rice Burroughs into a 10-week comic strip series. Foster was selected to illustrate the adaptation, which first appeared in the British weekly magazine &quot;Tit-Bits&quot; on October 20, 1928. The series was later published in the United States, beginning on January 7, 1929. Foster returned to do the &quot;Tarzan&quot; Sunday strip beginning September 27, 1931, continuing until Burne Hogarth took over the Sunday &quot;Tarzan&quot; on May 9, 1937.

==&quot;Prince Valiant&quot;==

William Randolph Hearst, who had long wanted Foster to do a comic strip for his newspapers, was so impressed with Foster&#x27;s pitch for &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; that he promised Foster a 50-50 split of the gross income on the strip, a very rare offer in those days. Prince Valiant premiered on February 13, 1937. It still continues today by other creators since the 1970s. In 1944, Foster and his wife Helen moved from Evanston, Illinois to Redding Ridge, Connecticut. In 1954, the couple was seen on television&#x27;s &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. In 1971, the Fosters retired to Spring Hill, Florida. In 1967, Woody Gelman revived some of Foster&#x27;s earlier work for his Nostalgia Press.

==Retirement and death==
In 1970, Foster was suffering from arthritis and began planning his retirement. He had several artists draw Sunday pages before choosing John Cullen Murphy as his collaborator and permanent replacement in 1971. Murphy drew the strip from Foster scripts and pencil sketches. Foster stopped illustrating (and signing) the &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; pages in 1971 – with the exception being Page #2000, on June 8, 1975, that featured reprinted vignettes of previous panels along with his signature. For nine years, Foster continued writing the strip and making fairly detailed x penciled layouts for Murphy, until he sold the strip to King Features Syndicate in 1979. Prolonged anesthesia during a hip replacement surgery in November 1979 took his memory, and he no longer remembered ever doing &quot;Tarzan&quot; or &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;.

Foster attended the Comic Art Convention in 1969, and the OrlandoCon in 1974 and 1975.

Foster was 73 when he was elected to membership in UK&#x27;s Royal Society of Arts, an honor given to very few Americans.

Foster died at a care facility in Hernando, Florida in 1982, a month before his 90th birthday.

==Influence and legacy==
Foster is a seminal figure in the history of comics, especially action-adventure strips. R.C. Harvey argues that Foster and &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; artist Alex Raymond &quot;created the visual standard by which all such comic strips would henceforth be measured.&quot;

Foster&#x27;s clear yet detailed panels, uncluttered by word balloons, were appreciated by contemporaries of his generation such as Lynd Ward, but perhaps his greatest impact was on the young artists who drove the Golden Age of Comics. Foster was a major influence on this generation, many of whom went on to become iconic and influential artists themselves. Joe Kubert called Foster, Raymond and Milton Caniff the &quot;three saints&quot; of comic art in the 1930s and 1940s. Several sources have identified early work by Joe Simon, Jack Kirby and Bob Kane as swipes from Foster, and Kirby claimed that he &quot;cannibalized&quot; Foster&#x27;s style, among others. Kirby also stated that the character design for Etrigan the Demon was an homage to Foster, taken from a &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; strip. Wally Wood was &quot;obsessed&quot; with Foster&#x27;s work, and began copying his newspaper strips at the age of two. Frank Frazetta called Foster&#x27;s work on &quot;Tarzan&quot; &quot;perfection, a landmark in American twentieth-century art that will never be surpassed.&quot; Among the many other artists who have cited Foster as an important influence are Carl Barks, Steve Ditko, Mark Schultz, William Stout, Bill Ward, and Al Williamson. Williamson, who met Foster on a few occasions, described him as &quot;a very stern gentleman, very stern, no nonsense. You could never call him Hal or Harold, it&#x27;s Mr. Foster. ... you don&#x27;t see that kind of people anymore, the ones that really command your respect.&quot;

==Awards==
Foster won The Silver Lady Award (The Artists and Writers Association, 1952); the Gold Medal Award (Parent’s Magazine, 1954); the Golden Lion Award (Burroughs Bibliophiles, 1967); the Alley Award (Academy of Comic Book Arts and Sciences, 1967, 1968 &amp; 1969); the Adamson Award (Swedish Academy of Comic Art, 1969); the Ignatz Award (OrlandoCon, 1974); the Inkpot Award (San Diego Comic-Con, 1977); and the Sondermann Award (Frankfurt Book Fair, 2008). Foster was also recognized for his work by the National Cartoonists Society with the Reuben Award in 1957, Silver T-Square Award (1975), Gold Key Award (1977), Elzie Segar Award (1978), Best Story Strip plaque (1964, 1971, 1974, 1976 &amp; 1978), and Special Feature plaque (1966 &amp; 1967), all for &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;. A rare honor came in 1965, when Foster was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA) in London, a first for any American cartoonist. More than any other cartoonist or illustrator, Foster is in five artistic Halls of Fame: The National Cartoonists Society Hall of Fame (1977), The Museum of Cartoon Art Hall of Fame (1977), The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame (1996), and the Joe Shuster Canadian Comic Book Creators Hall of Fame (First Annual, 2005, accepted on behalf of the family by writer-artist Dave Sim, a longtime admirer of Foster&#x27;s work.), and the Society of Illustrators&#x27; Hall of Fame (2006).

<text>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC, UNC-Chapel Hill, or simply Carolina) is a public research university in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States. Chartered in 1789, the university first began enrolling students in 1795, making it one of the oldest public universities in the United States. 

The university offers degrees in over 70 courses of study and is administratively divided into 13 separate professional schools and a primary unit, the College of Arts &amp; Sciences. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot; and is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU). The National Science Foundation ranked UNC–Chapel Hill ninth among American universities for research and development expenditures in 2023 with $1.5 billion.

The campus covers , encompassing the Morehead Planetarium and the many stores and shops located on Franklin Street. Students can participate in over 550 officially recognized student organizations. UNC-Chapel Hill is one of the charter members of the Atlantic Coast Conference, which was founded on June 14, 1953. The university&#x27;s athletic teams compete as the Tar Heels.

==History==

The University of North Carolina was chartered by the North Carolina General Assembly on December 11, 1789; its cornerstone was laid on October 12, 1793, at Chapel Hill, chosen because of its central location within the state. It is one of three universities that claims to be the oldest public university in the United States, and the only such institution to confer degrees in the eighteenth century as a public institution.

During the Civil War, North Carolina Governor David Lowry Swain persuaded Confederate President Jefferson Davis to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was one of the few in the Confederacy that managed to stay open. However, Chapel Hill suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during Reconstruction from December 1, 1870, until September 6, 1875. Following the reopening, enrollment was slow to increase and university administrators offered free tuition for the sons of teachers and ministers, as well as loans for those who could not afford attendance.

Following the Civil War, the university began to modernize its programs and onboard faculty with prestigious degrees. The creation of a new gymnasium, funding for a new Chemistry laboratory, and organization of the Graduate Department were accomplishments touted by UNC president Francis Venable at the 1905 &quot;University Day&quot; celebration.

Despite initial skepticism from university President Frank Porter Graham, on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group the University of North Carolina with the State College of Agriculture and Engineering and Woman&#x27;s College of the University of North Carolina to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina. In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully coeducational, although most women still attended Woman&#x27;s College for their first two years, transferring to Chapel Hill as juniors, since freshmen were required to live on campus and there was only one women&#x27;s residence hall. As a result, Woman&#x27;s College was renamed the &quot;University of North Carolina at Greensboro&quot;, and the University of North Carolina became the &quot;University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&quot;. In 1955, UNC officially desegregated its undergraduate divisions.

During World War II, UNC was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protests. Prior to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, protests about local racial segregation which began quietly in Franklin Street restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963 Speaker Ban Law prohibiting speeches by communists on state campuses in North Carolina. This stand towards the racial segregation on campus led up to the Sit-in movement. The Sit-in movement started a new era in North Carolina, which challenged colleges across the south against racial segregation of public facilities. The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor William Brantley Aycock and university President William Friday, but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965. Small amendments to allow &quot;infrequent&quot; visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university&#x27;s board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp&#x27;s decision to allow speaking invitations to Marxist speaker Herbert Aptheker and civil liberties activist Frank Wilkinson; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker&#x27;s speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened &quot;Dan Moore&#x27;s Wall&quot; by &quot;The Daily Tar Heel&quot; for Governor Dan K. Moore. A group of UNC-Chapel Hill students, led by Student Body President Paul Dickson, filed a lawsuit in U.S. federal court, and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. In 1969, campus food workers of Lenoir Hall went on strike protesting perceived racial injustices that impacted their employment, garnering the support of student groups and members of the university and Chapel Hill community and leading to state troopers in riot gear being deployed on campus and the state national guard being held on standby in Durham.

From the late 1990s and onward, UNC-Chapel Hill expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This is accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the &quot;Carolina First&quot; fundraising campaign and an endowment that increased fourfold to more than $2 billion within ten years. Professor Oliver Smithies was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2007 for his work in genetics. Additionally, Professor Aziz Sancar was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2015 for his work in understanding the molecular repair mechanisms of DNA.

In 2011, the first of several investigations found fraud and academic dishonesty at the university related to its athletic program. Following a lesser scandal that began in 2010 involving academic fraud and improper benefits with the university&#x27;s football program, two hundred questionable classes offered by the university&#x27;s African and Afro-American Studies department came to light. As a result, the university was placed on probation by its accrediting agency in 2015. It was removed from probation in 2016.

That same year, the public universities in North Carolina had to share a budget cut of $414 million, of which the Chapel Hill campus lost more than $100 million in 2011. This followed state budget cuts that trimmed university spending by $231 million since 2007; Provost Bruce Carney said more than 130 faculty members have left UNC since 2009., with poor staff retention. The Board of Trustees for UNC-CH recommended a 15.6 percent increase in tuition, a historically large increase. The budget cuts in 2011 greatly affected the university and set this increased tuition plan in motion and UNC students protested. On February 10, 2012, the UNC Board of Governors approved tuition and fee increases of 8.8 percent for in-state undergraduates across all 16 campuses.

In June 2018, the Department of Education found that the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill had violated Title IX in handling reports of sexual assault, five years after four students and an administrator filed complaints. The university was also featured in &quot;The Hunting Ground&quot;, a 2015 documentary about sexual assault on college campuses. Annie E. Clark and Andrea Pino, two students featured in the film, helped to establish the survivor advocacy organization End Rape on Campus.

In August 2018, the university came to national attention after the toppling of Silent Sam, a Confederate monument which had been erected on campus in 1913 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The statue had been dogged by controversy at various points since the 1960s, with critics claiming that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery. Many critics cited the explicitly racist views espoused in the dedication speech that local industrialist and UNC Trustee Julian Carr gave at the statue&#x27;s unveiling on June 2, 1913, and the approval with which they had been met by the crowd at the dedication. Shortly before the beginning of the 2018–2019 school year, the Silent Sam was toppled by protestors and damaged, and has been absent from campus ever since. In July 2020, the University&#x27;s Carr Hall, which was named after Julian Carr, was renamed the &quot;Student Affairs Building&quot;. Carr had supported white supremacy and also the Ku Klux Klan.

After reopening its campus in August 2020, UNC-Chapel Hill reported 135 new COVID-19 cases and four infection clusters within a week of having started in-person classes for the Fall 2020 semester. On August 10, faculty and staff from several of UNC&#x27;s constituent institutions filed a complaint against its board of governors, asking the system to default to online-only instruction for the fall. On August 17, UNC&#x27;s management announced that the university would be moving all undergraduate classes online from August 19, becoming the first university to send students home after having reopened.

Notable leaders of the university include the 26th Governor of North Carolina, David Lowry Swain (president 1835–1868); and Edwin Anderson Alderman (1896–1900), who was also president of Tulane University and the University of Virginia. On December 13, 2019, the UNC System Board of Governors unanimously voted to name Kevin Guskiewicz the university&#x27;s 12th chancellor.

In the early afternoon on August 28, 2023, the second week of the fall semester, a PhD student shot and killed associate professor Zijie Yan in Caudill Labs, a laboratory building near the center of campus.

In April 2024, UNC students joined other campuses across the United States in protests and establishing encampments against the Israel–Hamas war and the alleged genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. Student demands were transparency in investments and that UNC divest from Israel. With the administration coming down hard on the protesters, the students called for the protection of their first amendment rights. 36 arrests were made with police clearing out the encampment that was set up in Polk Place. Palestine Legal filed the federal civil rights complaint alleging that there was preferential treatment of Israeli students by UNC, and targeting of pro-Palestine students.

==Campus==

UNC-Chapel Hill&#x27;s campus covers around , including about of lawns and over of shrub beds and other ground cover. In 1999, UNC-Chapel Hill was one of sixteen recipients of the American Society of Landscape Architects Medallion Awards and was identified (in the second tier) as one of 50 college or university &quot;works of art&quot; by T.A. Gaines in his book &quot;The Campus as a Work of Art&quot;.

The oldest buildings on the campus, including the Old East building (built 1793–1795), the South Building (built 1798–1814), and the Old West building (built 1822–1823), stand around a quadrangle that runs north to Chapel Hill. This is named McCorkle Place after Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, who campaigned for the foundation of the university and was the original author of the bill requesting the university&#x27;s charter. 

A second quadrangle, Polk Place, was built in the 1920s to the south of the original campus, with the South Building on its north side, and named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President James K. Polk. The Wilson Library is at the south end of Polk Place.

McCorkle Place and Polk Place are both in what is the northern part of the campus in the 21st century, along with 
the Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Most university classrooms are located in this area, along with several undergraduate residence halls. The middle part of the campus includes Fetzer Field and Woollen Gymnasium along with the Student Recreation Center, Kenan Memorial Stadium, Irwin Belk outdoor track, Eddie Smith Field House, Boshamer Stadium, Carmichael Auditorium, Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government, School of Law, George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram&#x27;s Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls. The southern part of the campus houses the Dean Smith Center for men&#x27;s basketball, Koury Natatorium, School of Medicine, Adams School of Dentistry, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Gillings School of Global Public Health, UNC Hospitals, Kenan–Flagler Business School, and the newest student residence halls.

=== Campus features ===

Located in McCorkle Place is the Davie Poplar tree under which a popular legend says the university&#x27;s founder, William Richardson Davie, selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that as long as the tree stands, so will the university. However, the name was not associated with the tree until almost a century after the university&#x27;s foundation. A graft from the tree, named Davie Poplar Jr., was planted nearby in 1918 after the original tree was struck by lightning. A second graft, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university&#x27;s celebration in 1993. The student members of the university&#x27;s Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies are not allowed to walk on the grass of McCorkle Place out of respect for the unknown resting place of Joseph Caldwell, the university&#x27;s first president.

A symbol of the university is the Old Well, a small neoclassical rotunda at the south end of McCorkle Place based on the Temple of Love in the Gardens of Versailles, in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school. The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus&#x27;s oldest buildings, Old East, and Old West.

The historic Playmakers Theatre is located on Cameron Avenue between McCorkle Place and Polk Place. It was designed by Alexander Jackson Davis, the same architect who renovated the northern façade of Old East in 1844. The east-facing building was completed in 1851 and initially served as a library and as a ballroom. It was originally named Smith Hall after North Carolina Governor General Benjamin Smith, who was a special aide to George Washington during the American Revolutionary War and was an early benefactor to the university. When the library moved to Hill Hall in 1907, the building was transferred between the school of law and the agricultural chemistry department until it was taken over by the university theater group, the Carolina Playmakers, in 1924. It was remodeled as a theater, opening in 1925 as Playmakers Theater. Playmakers Theatre was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1973.

The Morehead–Patterson bell tower, south of the Wilson Library, was commissioned by John Motley Morehead III, the benefactor of the Morehead-Cain Scholarship. The hedge and surrounding landscape was designed by William C. Coker, botany professor and creator of the campus arboretum. Traditionally, seniors have the opportunity to climb the tower a few days prior to May commencement.

===Environment and sustainability===
The university has a goal that all new buildings meet the requirements for LEED silver certification, and the Allen Education Center at the university&#x27;s North Carolina Botanic Garden was the first building in North Carolina to receive LEED Platinum certification.

UNC-Chapel Hill&#x27;s cogeneration facility produced one-fourth of the electricity and all of the steam used on campus as of 2008.
In 2006, the university and the Town of Chapel Hill jointly agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 60% by 2050, becoming the first town-gown partnership in the country to make such an agreement.
Through these efforts, the university achieved a &quot;A−&quot; grade on the Sustainable Endowment Institute&#x27;s College Sustainability Report Card 2010.

The university was criticized in 2019 for abandoning a promise to shutter its coal-fired power plant by 2020. Initially, the university has announced plans to become carbon neutral by 2050, but in 2021, the plan was changed to 2040. In December 2019, the university was sued by the Sierra Club and the Center for Biological Diversity for violations of the Clean Air Act.

==Academics==

===Curriculum===

 UNC-Chapel Hill offered 71 bachelor&#x27;s, 107 master&#x27;s and 74 doctoral degree programs. The university enrolls students from all 100 North Carolina counties and state law requires that the percentage of students from North Carolina in each freshman class meet or exceed 82%. The student body consists of 17,981 undergraduate students and 10,935 graduate and professional students (as of Fall 2009). Racial and ethnic minorities comprise 30.8% of UNC-Chapel Hill&#x27;s undergraduate population as of 2010 and applications from international students more than doubled in five years from 702 in 2004 to 1,629 in 2009. Eighty-nine percent of enrolling first year students in 2009 reported a GPA of 4.0 or higher on a weighted 4.0 scale. The most popular majors at UNC-Chapel Hill in 2009 were biology, business administration, psychology, media and journalism, and political science. UNC-Chapel Hill also offers 300 study abroad programs in 70 countries.

At the undergraduate level, all students must fulfill a number of general education requirements as part of the Making Connections curriculum, which was introduced in 2006. English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad liberal arts education. The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen. After their second year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, nursing, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or media and journalism. Undergraduates are held to an eight-semester limit of study.

===Undergraduate admissions===
UNC-Chapel Hill&#x27;s admissions process is &quot;most selective&quot; according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. For the Class of 2025 (enrolled fall 2021), UNC-Chapel Hill received 53,776 applications and accepted 10,347 (19.2%). Of those accepted, 4,689 enrolled, a yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend the university) of 45.3%. UNC-Chapel Hill&#x27;s freshman retention rate is 96.5%, with 91.9% going on to graduate within six years.

Of the 60% of enrolled freshmen in 2021 who submitted ACT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite score was between 29 and 33. Of the 15% of the incoming freshman class who submitted SAT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite scores were 1330-1500. In the 2020–2021 academic year, 20 freshman students were National Merit Scholars. The university is need-blind for domestic applicants.

===Honor code===

The university has a longstanding honor code known as the &quot;Instrument of Student Judicial Governance&quot;, supplemented by a mostly student-run honor system to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community.

In 1974, the Judicial Reform Committee created the &quot;Instrument of Student Judicial Governance&quot;, which outlined the current honor code and its means for enforcement. The creation of the instrument and the judicial reform committee was preceded by a list of &quot;Demands by the Black Student Movement&quot; (BSM) which stated that &quot;[e]ither Black students have full jurisdiction over all offenses committed by Black students or duly elected Black Students from BSM who would represent our interests be on the present Judiciary Courts.&quot; Until 2024, most academic and conduct violations were handled by a single, student-run honor system. Prior to the student-run honor system, the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies, along with other campus organizations such as the men&#x27;s council, women&#x27;s council, and student council supported student concerns. In 2024, the university transitioned from the student-run honor system to a staff-run &quot;hearing board&quot;.

===Libraries===
UNC-Chapel Hill&#x27;s library system includes a number of individual libraries housed throughout the campus and holds more than 10 million combined print and electronic volumes. UNC-Chapel Hill&#x27;s North Carolina Collection (NCC) is the largest and most comprehensive collection of holdings about any single state nationwide. The unparalleled assemblage of literary, visual, and artifactual materials documents four centuries of North Carolina history and culture. The North Carolina Collection is housed in Wilson Library, named after Louis Round Wilson, along with the Southern Historical Collection, the Rare Books Collection, and the Southern Folklife Collection. The university is home to ibiblio, one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of freely available information including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies.

The Davis Library, situated near the Pit, is the main library and the largest academic facility and state-owned building in North Carolina. It was named after North Carolina philanthropist Walter Royal Davis and opened on February 6, 1984. The first book checked out of Davis Library was George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;1984&quot;. The R.B. House Undergraduate Library is located between the Pit area and Wilson Library. It is named after Robert B. House, the Chancellor of UNC from 1945 to 1957, and opened in 1968. In 2001, the R.B. House Undergraduate Library underwent a $9.9 million renovation that modernized the furnishings, equipment, and infrastructure of the building. Prior to the construction of Davis, Wilson Library was the university&#x27;s main library, but now Wilson hosts special events and houses special collections, rare books, and temporary exhibits.

====&quot;Documenting the American South&quot;====
The library oversees Documenting the American South, a free public access website of &quot;digitized primary materials that offer Southern perspectives on American history and culture.&quot; The project began in 1996. In 2009 the library launched the North Carolina Digital Heritage Center, a statewide digital library, in partnership with other organizations.

===Rankings and reputation===

For 2023, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked UNC-Chapel Hill 4th among the public universities and 22nd among national universities in the United States. The Wall Street Journal ranked UNC-Chapel Hill 3rd best public university behind University of Michigan and UCLA.

The university was named a Public Ivy by Richard Moll in his 1985 book &quot;The Public Ivies: A Guide to America&#x27;s Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities&quot;, and in later guides by Howard and Matthew Greene. 

The university is a large recipient of National Institute of Health grants and funds. For fiscal year 2020, the university received $509.9 million in NIH funds for research. This amount makes Chapel Hill the 10th overall recipient of research funds in the nation by the NIH.

===Scholarships===
For decades, UNC-Chapel Hill has offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the Morehead-Cain Scholarship. Recipients receive full tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead, 29 alumni of the program have been named Rhodes Scholars. Since 2001, North Carolina has also co-hosted the Robertson Scholars Leadership Program, a merit scholarship and leadership development program granting recipients full student privileges at both UNC-Chapel Hill and neighboring Duke University. Additionally, the university provides scholarships based on merit and leadership qualities, including the Carolina, Colonel Robinson, Johnston and Pogue Scholars programs.

In 2003, Chancellor James Moeser announced the Carolina Covenant, wherein UNC offers a debt free education to low-income students who are accepted to the university. The program was the first of its kind at a public university and the second overall in the nation (following Princeton University). About 80 other universities have since followed suit.
== Athletics ==
North Carolina&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Tar Heels. They compete as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level (Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) sub-level for football), primarily competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) for all sports since the 1953–54 season. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, fencing, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, fencing, field hockey, golf, gymnastics, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

The NCAA refers to UNC-Chapel Hill as the &quot;University of North Carolina&quot; for athletics. As of December 2024, the university had won 51 NCAA team championships in eight different sports, tied for 7th all-time. These include twenty two NCAA championships in women&#x27;s soccer, eleven in women&#x27;s field hockey, five in men&#x27;s lacrosse, six in men&#x27;s basketball, one in women&#x27;s basketball, one in women’s tennis, three in women’s lacrosse, and two in men&#x27;s soccer. The Men&#x27;s basketball team won its 6th NCAA basketball championship in 2017, the third for Coach Roy Williams since he took the job as head coach. UNC was also retroactively given the title of National Champion for the 1924 championship, but is typically not included in the official tally. Other recent successes include the 2011 College Cup in men&#x27;s soccer, and four consecutive College World Series appearances by the baseball team from 2006 to 2009. In 1994, the university&#x27;s athletic programs won the Sears Directors Cup &quot;all-sports national championship&quot; awarded for cumulative performance in NCAA competition. Consensus collegiate national athletes of the year from North Carolina include Rachel Dawson in field hockey; Phil Ford, Tyler Hansbrough, Antawn Jamison, Vince Carter, James Worthy and Michael Jordan in men&#x27;s basketball; and Mia Hamm (twice), Shannon Higgins, Kristine Lilly, and Tisha Venturini in women&#x27;s soccer.
===Mascot and nickname===
The university&#x27;s teams are nicknamed the &quot;Tar Heels&quot;, in reference to the state&#x27;s eighteenth-century prominence as a tar and pitch producer. The nickname&#x27;s cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the American Civil War and the American Revolution. The mascot is a live Dorset ram named Rameses, a tradition that dates back to 1924, when the team manager brought a ram to the annual game against Virginia Military Institute, inspired by the play of former football player Jack &quot;The Battering Ram&quot; Merrit. The kicker rubbed his head for good luck before a game-winning field goal, and the ram stayed. There is also an anthropomorphic ram mascot who appears at games. The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor&#x27;s hat, a reference to a United States Navy flight training program that was attached to the university during World War II.

===The Carolina Way===
Basketball coach Dean Smith was widely known for his idea of &quot;The Carolina Way&quot;, in which he challenged his players to, &quot;Play hard, play smart, play together.&quot; &quot;The Carolina Way&quot; was an idea of excellence in the classroom, as well as on the court. In Coach Smith&#x27;s book, &quot;The Carolina Way&quot;, former player Scott Williams said, regarding Dean Smith, &quot;Winning was very important at Carolina, and there was much pressure to win, but Coach cared more about our getting a sound education and turning into good citizens than he did about winning.&quot;

The October 22, 2014, release of the Wainstein Report alleged institutionalized academic fraud that involved over 3,100 students and student athletes, over an 18-year period from 1993 to 2011 that began during the final years of the Dean Smith era, challenged &quot;The Carolina Way&quot; image. The report alleged that at least 54 players during the Dean Smith era were enrolled in what came to be known as &quot;paper classes&quot;. The report noted that the questionable classes began in the spring of 1993, the year of Smith&#x27;s final championship, so those grades would not have been entered until after the championship game was played. In response to the allegations of the Wainstein report, the NCAA launched their own investigation and on June 5, 2015 the NCAA accused the institution of five major violations including: &quot;two instances of unethical conduct and failure to cooperate&quot; as well as &quot;unethical conduct and extra benefits related to student-athletes&#x27; access to and assistance in the paper courses; unethical conduct by the instructor/counselor for providing impermissible academic assistance to student-athletes; and a failure to monitor and lack of institutional control&quot;. In October 2017, the NCAA issued its findings and concluded &quot;that the only violations in this case are the department chair&#x27;s and the secretary&#x27;s failure to cooperate&quot;.

===Rivalries===
The South&#x27;s Oldest Rivalry between North Carolina and its first opponent, the University of Virginia, was prominent throughout the first third of the twentieth century. The 119th meeting in football between two of the top public universities in the east occurred in October 2014.

One of the fiercest rivalries is with Durham&#x27;s Duke University. Located only eight miles from each other, the schools regularly compete in both athletics and academics. The Carolina-Duke rivalry is most intense, however, in basketball. With a combined eleven national championships in men&#x27;s basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for the past thirty years. The rivalry has been the focus of several books, including Will Blythe&#x27;s &quot;To Hate Like This Is to Be Happy Forever&quot; and was the focus of the HBO documentary &quot;Battle for Tobacco Road: Duke vs Carolina&quot;.

Carolina holds an in-state rivalry with fellow Tobacco Road school, North Carolina State University. Since the mid-1970s, however, the Tar Heels have shifted their attention to Duke following a severe decline in NC State&#x27;s basketball program (and the resurgence of Duke&#x27;s basketball program) that reached rock bottom during Roy Williams&#x27; tenure as evidenced by their 4–36 record against the Tar Heels. The Wolfpack faithful still consider the rivalry the most bitter in the state despite the fact that it&#x27;s been decades since Tar Heel supporters have acknowledged NC State as a rival. Combined, the two schools hold eight NCAA Championships and 27 ACC Championships in basketball. Students from each school often exchange pranks before basketball and football games.

===Rushing Franklin===

While students previously held &quot;Beat Duke&quot; parades on Franklin Street before sporting events, today students and sports fans have been known to spill out of bars and residence halls upon the victory of one of Carolina&#x27;s sports teams. In most cases, a Franklin Street &quot;bonfire&quot; celebration is due to a victory by the men&#x27;s basketball team, although other Franklin Street celebrations have stemmed from wins by the women&#x27;s basketball team and women&#x27;s soccer team. The first known student celebration on Franklin Street came after the 1957 men&#x27;s basketball team capped their perfect season with a national championship victory over the Kansas Jayhawks. From then on, students have flooded the street after important victories. After a Final Four victory in 1981 and the men&#x27;s basketball team won the 1982 NCAA Championship, Franklin Street was painted blue by the fans who had rushed the street. 

===School colors===

Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school&#x27;s colors have been blue and white. The colors were chosen years before by the Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies, the oldest student organization at the university. The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the &quot;Di&quot;s were from the western part of North Carolina while the &quot;Phi&quot;s were from the eastern part of the state.
Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation. On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university. When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the Carolina football team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors.

===School songs===

Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement, convocation, and athletic games are the university fight songs &quot;I&#x27;m a Tar Heel Born&quot; and &quot;Here Comes Carolina&quot;. The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories. &quot;I&#x27;m a Tar Heel Born&quot; originated in the late 1920s as a tag to the school&#x27;s alma mater, &quot;Hark The Sound&quot;.

==Student life==

===Organizations and activities===

Most student organizations at UNC-Chapel Hill are officially recognized and provided with assistance by the Carolina Union, an administrative unit of the university. Funding is derived from the student government student activity fee, which is allocated at the discretion of the Undergraduate Senate (UGS) or the Graduate and Professional Student Government Senate (GPSG Senate).

The largest student fundraiser, the UNC Dance Marathon, involves thousands of students, faculty, and community members in raising funds for the North Carolina Children&#x27;s Hospital. The organization conducts fundraising and volunteer activities throughout the year and, , had donated $1.4 million since its inception in 1999.

The student-run newspaper &quot;The Daily Tar Heel&quot; received the 2004–5 National Pacemaker Award from the Associated Collegiate Press. Founded in 1977, WXYC 89.3 FM is UNC-Chapel Hill&#x27;s student radio station that broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Programming is left up to student DJs. WXYC typically plays little heard music from a wide range of genres and eras. On November 7, 1994, WXYC became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet. A student-run television station, STV, airs on the campus cable and throughout the Chapel Hill Spectrum system. Founded in 1948 as successor to the &quot;Carolina Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Carolina Quarterly&quot;, edited by graduate students, has published the works of numerous authors, including Wendell Berry, Raymond Carver, Don DeLillo, Annie Dillard, Joyce Carol Oates, and John Edgar Wideman. Works appearing in the &quot;Quarterly&quot; have been anthologized in &quot;Best American Short Stories&quot; and &quot;New Stories from the South&quot; and have won the Pushcart and O. Henry Prizes.

The &quot;Clef Hangers&quot; (also known as the &quot;Clefs&quot;) are the university&#x27;s oldest a cappella group, founded by Barry Saunders in 1977. The group has since won several Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards (CARAs), including Best Soloist in the song &quot;Easy&quot;, featured on the 2003 album &quot;Breeze&quot;. They have won two more CARAs for Best Male Collegiate Songs for &quot;My Love on Time Out&quot; (2008), and for &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing Wrong on Twist&quot; (2009). Members have included Brendan James, who graduated in 2002, and Anoop Desai, who graduated in 2008.

The Residence Hall Association, the school&#x27;s third-largest student-run organization, is the representative organization for students living in residence halls. Its activities include social, educational, and philanthropic programs for residents; recognizing outstanding residents and members; and helping residents develop into successful leaders. RHA is the affiliated to the National Association of College and University Residence Halls.
UNC also has a biannual naked run. On the day before final exams, students gather on the 8th floor of the Davis library, strip naked and streak through the floors, and streak back up. This is done to deal with exam stress and to increase body positivity. 

The athletic teams at the university are supported by The Marching Tar Heels, the university&#x27;s marching band. The entire 275-member volunteer band is present at every home football game, and smaller pep bands play at all home basketball games. Each member of the band is also required to play in at least one of five pep bands that play at athletic events of the 26 other sports.

UNC-Chapel Hill has a regional theater company in residence, the Playmakers Repertory Company, and hosts regular dance, drama, and music performances on campus. The school has an outdoor stone amphitheatre known as Forest Theatre used for weddings and drama productions. Forest Theatre is dedicated to Professor Frederick Koch, the founder of the Carolina Playmakers and the father American folk drama.

Many fraternities and sororities on campus belong to the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), Interfraternity Council (IFC), Greek Alliance Council, and National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC). As of spring 2010, eighteen percent of undergraduates were in fraternities or sororities (3131 out of 17,160 total). The total number of community service hours completed for the 2010 spring semester by fraternities and sororities was 51,819 hours (average of 31 hours/person). UNC-Chapel Hill also offers professional and service fraternities that do not have houses but are still recognized by the school. Some of the campus honor societies include: the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the Grail-Valkyries, the Order of the Old Well, the Order of the Bell Tower, and the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society.

===Student government===

The student government at UNC–Chapel Hill is split into undergraduate student government and graduate and professional student government. The undergraduate student government consists of an executive branch headed by the student body president and a legislative branch, the undergraduate student senate. The graduate and professional student government similarly consists of an executive (with its own president) and a legislative senate. There is also a joint governance council that approves legislation affecting both undergraduate and graduate and professional students and advises the undergraduate and graduate and professional student governments. The honor system is similarly split into two branches covering undergraduate students and graduate and professional students. The Student Supreme Court, the other part of the judicial branch, consists of four associate justices and a chief justice, which are appointed by the student body president and confirmed by a two thirds vote of the senate for their part of the student body.

===Dining===

Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 using funds from the New Deal era Public Works Administration, and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940. The building was named for General William Lenoir, the first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the university in 1790. Since its inception, Lenoir Dining Hall has remained the flagship of Carolina Dining Services and the center of dining on campus. It has been renovated twice, in 1984 and 2011, to improve seating and ease mealtime rushes.

Chase Hall was originally built in 1965 to offer South Campus dining options and honor former UNC President Harry Woodburn Chase, who served from 1919 to 1930. In 2005, the building was torn down to make way for the Student and Academic Services buildings, and was rebuilt north of the original location as the Rams Head Center (with the inner dining hall officially titled Chase Dining Hall). Due to students nicknaming the dining hall Rams Head, the university officially reinstated Chase Hall as the building name in March 2017. It includes the Chase Dining Hall, the Rams Head Market, and a conference room called the &quot;Blue Zone&quot;. Chase Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day. It continues to offer more food service options to the students living on south campus, and features extended hours including the 9 pm – 12 am period referred to as &quot;Late Night&quot;.

===Housing===
On campus, the Department of Housing and Residential Education manages thirty-two residence halls, grouped into thirteen communities. These communities range from Olde Campus Upper Quad Community which includes Old East Residence Hall, the oldest building of the university, to modern communities such as Manning West, completed in 2002. First year students are required to live in one of the eight &quot;First Year Experience&quot; residence halls, most of which are located on South Campus. In addition to residence halls, the university oversees an additional eight apartment complexes organized into three communities, Ram Village, Odum Village, and Baity Hill Student Family Housing. Along with themed housing focusing on foreign languages and substance-free living, there are also &quot;living-learning communities&quot; which have been formed for specific social, gender-related, or academic needs. An example is UNITAS, sponsored by the Department of Anthropology, where residents are assigned roommates on the basis of cultural or racial differences rather than similarities. Three apartment complexes offer housing for families, graduate students, and some upperclassmen. Along with the rest of campus, all residence halls, apartments, and their surrounding grounds are smoke-free. , 46% of all undergraduates live in university-provided housing.
== Alumni ==
With over 300,000 living former students, North Carolina has one of the largest and most active alumni groups in America. Many Tar Heels have attained local, national, and international prominence. In politics, these have included James K. Polk, who served as the 11th President of the United States from 1845 to 1849, and William R. King, the thirteenth Vice President of the United States. Tar Heels have also made a mark on pop culture, with figures including Thomas Wolfe, the author of works such as &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot; and &quot;Of Time and the River&quot;, and Andy Griffith, star of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;. Sports stars have included basketball player Michael Jordan, who played under Dean Smith while attending UNC, and Olympians April Heinrichs and Vikas Gowda. In business, alumni include Jason Kilar, former CEO of Hulu, and Howard R. Levine, former CEO and chair of Family Dollar.

<text>New London is a seaport city and a port of entry on the northeast coast of the United States, located at the outlet of the Thames River in New London County, Connecticut, which empties into Long Island Sound. The city is part of the Southeastern Connecticut Planning Region.

New London is home to the United States Coast Guard Academy, Connecticut College, Mitchell College, and The Williams School. The Coast Guard Station New London and New London Harbor is home port to both the Coast Guard&#x27;s cutter &quot;Coho&quot; and their tall ship &quot;Eagle&quot;. The city had a population of 27,367 at the 2020 census. The Norwich–New London metropolitan area includes 21 towns and 274,055 people.

==History==


===Colonial era===
The area was called Nameaug by the Pequot Indians. John Winthrop, Jr. founded the first English settlement here in 1646, making it about the 13th town settled in Connecticut. Inhabitants referred to it informally as Nameaug or as Pequot after the tribe. In the 1650s, the colonists wanted to give the town the official name of London after London, England, but the Connecticut General Assembly wanted to name it Faire Harbour. The citizens protested, declaring that they would prefer it to be called Nameaug if it could not be officially named London. The legislature relented, and the town was officially named New London on March 24, 1658.

===American Revolution===

The harbor was considered to be the best deep water harbor on Long Island Sound, and consequently New London became a base of American naval operations during the American Revolutionary War and privateers where it has been said no port took more prizes than New London with between 400–800 being credited to New London privateers including the 1781 taking of supply ship Hannah, the largest prize taken during the war. Famous New Londoners during the American Revolution include Nathan Hale, William Coit, Richard Douglass, Thomas and Nathaniel Shaw, Gen. Samuel Parsons, printer Timothy Green, and Bishop Samuel Seabury.

New London was raided and much of it burned to the ground on September 6, 1781, in the Battle of Groton Heights by Norwich native Benedict Arnold in an attempt to destroy the Patriot privateer fleet and supplies of goods and naval stores within the city. It is often noted that this raid on New London and Groton was intended to divert General George Washington and the French Army under Rochambeau from their march on Yorktown, Virginia. The main defensive fort for New London was Fort Griswold, located across the Thames River in Groton. It was well known to Arnold, who had already informed the British of this so that they could avoid its artillery fire. British and Hessian troops subsequently attacked and captured New London&#x27;s Fort Trumbull, while other forces moved in to attack Fort Griswold across the river, then held by Lieutenant-Colonel William Ledyard. The British suffered great casualties at Fort Griswold before the Americans were finally forced to surrender—whereupon Arnold&#x27;s men stormed into the fort and slaughtered most of the American troops who defended it, including Ledyard. All told, more than 52 British and 83 American soldiers were killed, and more than 142 British and 39 Americans were wounded, many mortally. New London suffered over 6 defenders killed and 24 wounded, while Arnold&#x27;s men suffered an equal amount.

Connecticut&#x27;s independent legislature made New London one of five cities simultaneously brought from &quot;de facto&quot; to formalized incorporations in its January session of 1784.

===19th century===

After the War of 1812 began, the Royal Navy established a blockade of the East Coast of the United States, including New London. During the war, American forces unsuccessfully attempted to destroy the British ship of the line HMS &quot;Ramillies&quot; while it was lying at anchor in New London&#x27;s harbor with torpedoes launched from small boats. This prompted the captain of &quot;Ramillies&quot;, Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet, to warn the Americans to cease using this &quot;cruel and unheard-of warfare&quot; or he would &quot;order every house near the shore to be destroyed&quot;. The fact that Hardy had been previously so lenient and considerate to the Americans caused them to abandon such attempts with immediate effect.

For several decades beginning in the early 19th century, New London was one of the three busiest whaling ports in the world, along with Nantucket and New Bedford, Massachusetts. The wealth that whaling brought into the city furnished the capital to fund much of the city&#x27;s present architecture. The New Haven and New London Railroad connected New London by rail to New Haven and points beyond by the 1850s. The Springfield and New London Railroad connected New London to Springfield, Massachusetts, by the 1870s.

Many distinctive structures built in the 19th century remain, but the First Church built in 1853 collapsed in January 2024.

===Military presence===

Several military installations have been part of New London&#x27;s history, including the United States Coast Guard Academy and Coast Guard Station New London. Most of these military installations have been located at Fort Trumbull. The first Fort Trumbull was an earthwork built 1775–1777 that took part in the Revolutionary War. The second Fort Trumbull was built 1839–1852 and still stands. During the Red Summer of 1919, there were a series of racial riots between white and black Navy men stationed in New London and Groton.

By 1910, the fort&#x27;s defensive function had been superseded by the new forts of the Endicott Program, primarily located on Fishers Island. The fort was given to the Revenue Cutter Service and became the Revenue Cutter Academy. The Revenue Cutter Service was merged into the United States Coast Guard in 1915, and the Academy relocated to its current site in 1932.

During World War II, the Merchant Marine Officers Training School was located at Fort Trumbull. From 1950 to 1990, Fort Trumbull was the location for the Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory, which developed sonar and related systems for US Navy submarines. In 1990, the Sound Laboratory was merged with the Naval Underwater Systems Center in Newport, Rhode Island, and the New London facility was closed in 1996.

The Naval Submarine Base New London is physically located in Groton, but submarines were stationed in New London during World War II and from 1951 to 1991. The submarine tender &quot;Fulton&quot; and Submarine Squadron 10 were based at State Pier in New London during this time. Squadron Ten was usually composed of eight to ten submarines and was the first all-nuclear submarine squadron. In the summer of 1960, peace activists from around the country gathered in New London to protest the all-nuclear submarines being based there. Participants held daily vigils and marches, handed out leaflets and talked with workers. Unable to achieve their goals by the end of the summer, some activists stayed in Connecticut and established the New England Committee for Non-Violent Action.

USS &quot;Fulton&quot; was decommissioned, after 50 years of service, in 1991 and Submarine Squadron 10 was disbanded at the same time. In the 1990s, State Pier was rebuilt as a container terminal.

===Fort Trumbull===


The neighborhood of Fort Trumbull once consisted of nearly two-dozen homes, but they were seized by the City of New London using eminent domain. This measure was supported in a 5–4 ruling in the 2005 Supreme Court case &quot;Kelo v. City of New London&quot;, and the homes were ultimately demolished by the city as part of an economic development plan. The site was slated to be redeveloped under this plan, but the chosen developer was not able to get financing and the project failed. The empty landscape of the Fort Trumbull area has been widely characterized as an example of government overreach and inefficiency.

==Geography==
In terms of land area, New London is one of the smallest cities in Connecticut. Of the whole , nearly half is water; is land.

The town and city of New London are coextensive. Sections of the original town were ceded to form newer towns between 1705 and 1801. The towns of Groton, Ledyard, Montville, and Waterford, and portions of Salem and East Lyme, now occupy what had earlier been the outlying area of New London.

New London is bounded on the west and north by the town of Waterford on the east by the Thames River and Groton and on the south by Long Island Sound.

===Principal communities===
*Downtown New London
*Ocean Beach

Other minor communities and geographic features include Bates Woods Park, Fort Trumbull, Glenwood Park, Green&#x27;s Harbor Beach, Mitchell&#x27;s Woods, Pequot Colony, Riverside Park, Old Town Mill.

===Towns created from New London===
New London originally had a larger land area when it was established. Towns set off since include:
* Stonington in 1649
** This large area ran from the Mystic River to the Pawcatuck River, including Pawcatuck, Wequetequock, and the easterly half of Mystic. It stretched inland from Long Island Sound to Lantern Hill.
** North Stonington was created from the northern half of Stonington in 1807.
* Groton in 1705
** Ledyard (originally North Groton) created from a part of Groton in 1836.
* Montville in 1786.
** Salem created from parts of Montville, Colchester, and Lyme in 1819
* Waterford in 1801.
** East Lyme created from parts of Waterford and Lyme in 1839.
* Fishers Island officially left Connecticut and became part of New York in 1879.

===Climate===

Using the Köppen climate classification New London has a warm temperate climate. This zone is defined as having a monthly mean temperature above 26.4 °F (−3 C) but below 64.4 °F (18 C) in the coldest month.

The city experiences long, hot and humid summers, and cool to cold winters with snowfall on occasion. The city averages 2,300 hours of sunshine annually (higher than the USA average). New London lies in the broad transition zone between continental climates to the north in New England and southern Canada, and the humid subtropical climates to the south along the lower East Coast.

From May to late September, the southerly flow from the Bermuda High creates hot and humid tropical weather conditions. Daytime heating produces occasional thunderstorms with heavy but brief downpours. Daytime highs in summer are normally near 80 °F, with occasional heat waves bringing high temperatures into the 90&#x27;s °F. Spring and Fall are mild in New London, with daytime highs in the 55° to 70 °F range and lows in the 40° to 50 °F range. The seaside location of the city creates a long growing season compared to areas inland. The first frost in the New London area is normally not until late October or early November, almost three weeks later than parts of northern Connecticut. Winters are cool with a mix of rainfall and snowfall, or mixed precipitation. New London normally sees fewer than 25 days annually with snow cover. In mid-winter, there can be large differences in low temperatures between areas along the coastline and areas well inland, sometimes as much as 15 °F.

Tropical cyclones (hurricanes/tropical storms) have struck Connecticut and the New London metropolitan area, although infrequently. Hurricane landfalls have occurred along the Connecticut coast in 1903, 1938, 1944, 1954 (Carol), 1960 (Donna), 1985 (Gloria). Tropical Storm Irene (2011) also caused moderate damage along the Connecticut coast, as did Hurricane Sandy (which made landfall in New Jersey) in 2012.

The Connecticut shoreline (including New London) lies within the broad transition zone where so-called &quot;subtropical indicator&quot; plants and other broadleaf evergreens can successfully be cultivated. New London averages about 90 days annually with freeze, about the same as Baltimore, Maryland. As such, many varieties of Southern Magnolia, Needle Palms, Loblolly and Longleaf Pines, Crape Myrtles, Aucuba japonica, Camellia, trunking Yucca, hardy bananas, Monkey Puzzle, copious types of evergreen Hollies, many East Asian (non-holly) broadleaf evergreen trees and shrubs, and certain varieties of figs may be grown in private and public gardens. The growing season is quite long in New London. Like much of coastal Connecticut and Long Island, NY, it averages close to 200 frost free days. The new 2023 USDA Garden Zone Map has New London in zone 7a. New London falls into the same garden zone as locations like Trenton, New Jersey, Wilmington, Delaware, or Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. By the mid-to-late 21st century, the area is expected to fall within USDA zone 8 according to some models.

==Demographics==
===Recent estimates on demographics and economic status===
According to the 2006–2008 American Community Survey, non-Hispanic whites made up 54.6% of New London&#x27;s population. Non-Hispanic blacks made up 14.0% of the population. Asians of non-Hispanic origin made up 4.6% of the city&#x27;s population. Multiracial individuals of non-Hispanic origin made up 4.3% of the population; people of mixed black and white ancestry made up 1.7% of the population. In addition, people of mixed black and Native American ancestry made up 1.0% of the population. People of mixed white and Native American ancestry made up 0.7% of the population; those of mixed white and Asian ancestry made up 0.4% of the populace. Hispanics and Latinos made up 21.9% of the population, of which 13.8% were Puerto Rican.

The top five largest European ancestral ethnicities were Italian (10.5%), Irish (9.7%), German (7.4%), English (6.8%), and Polish (5.0%)

According to the survey, 74.4% of people over the age of 5 spoke only English at home. Approximately 16.0% of the population spoke Spanish at home.

==Economy==
New London was one of the world&#x27;s three busiest whaling ports for several decades beginning in the early 19th century, along with Nantucket and New Bedford, Massachusetts. The wealth that whaling brought into the city furnished the capital to fund much of the city&#x27;s present architecture. The city subsequently became home to other shipping and manufacturing industries, but had gradually lost most of its industrial heart. The State Pier (south of the Gold Star Memorial Bridge) is being converted to support some of the offshore wind power in the United States.

==Arts and culture==
===Eugene O&#x27;Neill===
Nobel laureate and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Eugene O&#x27;Neill (1888–1953) lived in New London and wrote several plays in the city.

<doc id="89515" wikidata="Q6544141" url="?curid=89515" title="Easter in Latvia">
<text>The Christian festival of [[Easter]] is celebrated in Latvia as Lieldienas (). Lieldienas enters Holy Week with Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday, but Sunday will mark first Lieldienas. Second Lieldienas is on Monday of the following week. Each day has a special significance. Also, many pagan elements of celebrating Lieldienas have become a tradition.

== Lieldienas dates ==
Nowadays, the common date of Lieldienas is the first Sunday after the first full moon, after or during the vernal equinox. Thus, the Western Christian Church Lieldienas falls on a date between 22 March and 25 April. In Eastern Orthodox Churches, which used the Julian calendar, Lieldienas falls on a date between 4 April and 8 May in Gregorian calendar.

== Latvian customs of celebrating Lieldienas ==
Before the arrival of Christianity, Lieldienas was a spring equinox event, celebrating the victory of light over darkness.

=== Egg-related beliefs ===
Although dainas have no conclusive indication of egg painting tradition in ancient times, the majority of them mention golden, silver and white eggs. Therefore, it can be concluded that egg painting is more of a modern tradition. In order for eggs to be diverse, they were boiled with colorful cloth. In one area, grits are poured in, while in other, people added colorful birch leaves, fir needles, cells, a variety of flowers, herbs or just reel them with a colorful yarn. Every family has a different way of following this tradition.

Wizards also colored eggs in ancient times and laid them under the horse or cattle&#x27;s troughs, to cast a misfortune of cattle plague on whoever they wanted. People were afraid of such wizard&#x27;s eggs.

People believed that particular magical power was inherent even in water, which boiled eggs. They believed it helped to ward off hawks from chickens: the swishing sauna whisks were hooked between the fence poles on Lieldienas morning and were filled with water which was used to boil eggs.

While eating an egg, people watched how the eggshell separated - if it came off well, it meant the flax will grow well; if it shed badly, then it meant a bad flax harvest. Eggs also involved in a lot of other beliefs:

* Who steals a Lieldienas egg - will remain naked like an egg!
* Who eats a Lieldienas egg without salt - will lie all summer!
* Exchange eggs during Lieldienas - otherwise chickens will not lay and chicks will not hatch!
* If a girl during Lieldienas gives to a guy 2 eggs, it would imply - I don&#x27;t like you; if 3 - better than nothing; if 4 - I don&#x27;t like you, but since you&#x27;re rich, I will be with you; if 5 - I have been waiting for you for a long time, come, take me!

=== Swing-related beliefs ===
Hanging swings and selecting a place was a special honorable duty. Swings were usually made from oak or ashen poles. Swings location was chosen on the hill, between 2 oak trees. Along with the swinging occurred a great singing. Guys, who swung with girls, were gifted with eggs, and even gloves and socks. Swinging lasts for 1 week after Lieldienas, and then the swings were burned, so witches could not swing on them.

The celebration could not go on without beating eggs. Each received their egg in their hands and thought of a wish; then 2 people clapped their eggs with thin ends together. Whose egg does not break - their wish would come true. Eggs were also rolled - via a special chute.

One of the oldest performances is bird healing. Birds symbolized evil and disease. By driving them away from the fences and fields, it was believed that all evil and accidents would be dispelled.

When the sun rose on Lieldienas morning, just above the horizon, people swung 3 times on one side of a swing, and 3 times on the other side. It was caused by the habit of swinging on Lieldienas. Before swinging, people walked around the swings 3 times, singing songs, then guys threw eggs over poles, predicting their lifespan, and only then they began to swing.

In other areas, the first Lieldienas held an &quot;egg hunt&quot;. Young boys went to the neighboring houses, searching for Lieldienas eggs. Eggs were requested by the girls, which was the main reason for looting.

Several folk songs mention that people celebrated Lieldienas 4 days, some of them mention only 3. Beliefs also mention 4 days. For example, one belief says &quot;do not work for 4 days of Lieldienas - children from other houses will begin to limp&quot;. Therefore, one can think that in the past, along with Ziemassvētki, Latvians celebrated Lieldienas for 4 days. Later on, both festivals were reduced to 1 day.

===Other Lieldienas beliefs ===
* Before the sunrise, go to the barn to pick up crumbs, so that the money stays.
* Wake up as early as possible on Lieldiena morning, in order to do your job well all year, just put on a new shirt and go whip the sleep away.
* On Lieldienas morning, water from every (toward the sun&#x27;s current position) rivers is holy. Use water, which flows toward the sun, - &quot;living water&quot;- to wash mouth, so no one could harm you. It can be collected and it does not go bad all year. It can be used to bless buildings — such as barns, so that goblins and insects do not enter them.
* Trim finger nails before the sunrise, so that eyes won&#x27;t hurt. Also the rag is pulled over the pasture — to collect dew. The rag collected dew and were given to cows to drink.
* On Lieldienas, lie down on dew, in order to be healthy all year round.
* On the crossroads, where the fairies live and being vices of home, sweep rubbish before the sunrise, to chase away insects. Hence — donate to crossroads spirits, or to Māras of dark dimension (whom Greeks called Hecate, while Indians called Kali.)
* Lieldienas requires a lot of swinging - so you would not oversleep throughout the whole year!
* With a tar draw signs on the barn doors to prevent changeling. — What signs are drawn? — The Incubus cross - either with 5, or 8 lines, and 3 toads, which are considered to be a sign of wealth. Draw fire crosses — to ward off evil spirits and a few more characters.
* Judging by what drawn on new safety signs, the prohibitions are known — such as do not leave clothes outside for a night and do not give milk to strangers, so cattle are could not be enchanted. In the morning, before sunrise, go around the house 3 times with a scythe over shoulder — to chase away the evil spirits.
* In order for cows to not gallop, ride around your borders on a broom 3 times, during the sunless Lieldienas morning. If on Lieldienas night you run around house with a rowan club — that house cannot be enchanted.

<text>A sheriff is a government official, with varying duties, existing in some countries with historical ties to England where the office originated. There is an analogous, although independently developed, office in Iceland, the , which is commonly translated to English as &quot;sheriff&quot;.

==Description==
In British English, the political or legal office of a sheriff, term of office of a sheriff, or jurisdiction of a sheriff, is called a shrievalty in England and Wales, and a sheriffdom in Scotland.

In modern times, the specific combination of legal, political and ceremonial duties of a sheriff varies greatly from country to country.
* In England, Northern Ireland, or Wales, a sheriff (or high sheriff) is a ceremonial county or city official.
* In Scotland, sheriffs are judges.
* In the Republic of Ireland, in some counties and in the cities of Dublin and Cork, sheriffs are legal officials similar to bailiffs.
* In the United States, a sheriff is a sworn law enforcement officer whose duties vary across states and counties. A sheriff is generally an elected county official, with duties that typically include policing unincorporated areas, maintaining county jails, providing security to courts in the county, and (in some states) serving warrants and court papers. In addition to these policing and correction services, a sheriff is often responsible for enforcing civil law within the jurisdiction.
* In Canada, sheriffs exist in various forms, with duties and powers depending on the province. In general, the provincial sheriff services manage and transport court prisoners and serve court orders. In some provinces, sheriffs provide security for the court system, protect public officials and support investigations by local police services. In Alberta, sheriffs perform various law enforcement duties in a supplementary capacity, such as traffic enforcement and responding to 9-1-1 calls in rural areas.
* In Australia and South Africa sheriffs are legal officials similar to bailiffs. In these countries there is no link maintained between counties and sheriffs.
* In India, a sheriff is a largely ceremonial office in a few major cities.

==Europe==
===United Kingdom===

The Old English term designated a royal official, a reeve, responsible for managing a shire or county on behalf of the king. The term is a contraction of &quot;shire reeve&quot; (Old English ). 

The sheriff had a series of duties that included keeping the peace and providing men at arms to support the king in times of strife. Another important duty was the collection of taxes on behalf of the crown. This process involved each division of the county (known as the hundred) paying geld (a form of land tax). To assess how much people had to pay, a clerk and a knight were sent by the king to each county. They sat with the sheriff of the county and with a select group of local knights (two knights from each hundred). After it was determined what geld was to be paid, the knights of the hundred and the bailiff of the hundred were responsible for getting the money to the sheriff, and the sheriff was responsible for getting the money to the Exchequer.

Sheriffs loyal to certain nobles could and did sabotage the careers of knights against whom they, or a noble they were loyal to, bore a grudge. Groups of sheriffs with significant connections had more &quot;de facto&quot; power in the legal system than most English knights, despite their lack of land.

The term and duties were preserved in England even after the Norman Conquest. However, in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the role evolved over the centuries. In modern times the sheriff or high sheriff is a ceremonial county or city official. Some commercial organisations use the term to refer to High Court enforcement officers, who were known as &quot;sheriff&#x27;s officers&quot; prior to 2004.

====Scotland====

In Scotland the sheriff is a judicial office holder in the sheriff courts, and they are members of the judiciary of Scotland.

=====&quot;Sheriffs principal&quot;=====
The most senior sheriffs are the sheriffs principal, who have administrative as well as judicial authority in the six sheriffdoms, and are responsible for the effective running and administration of all the sheriff courts in their jurisdiction. Sheriffs principal also sit as appeal sheriffs in the Sheriff Appeal Court; hearing appeals against sentencing and conviction from summary trials in the sheriff courts and justice of the peace courts. The additional duties of a sheriff principal include being Commissioners of the Northern Lighthouse Board (which is the general lighthouse authority for Scotland), and chairing local criminal justice boards which bring together local representatives of procurator fiscal, Police Scotland and Community Justice Scotland, and Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service.

=====&quot;Sheriffs&quot;=====
Sheriffs deal with the majority of civil and criminal court cases in Scotland, with the power to preside in solemn proceedings with a jury of 15 for indictable offences and sitting alone in summary proceedings for summary offences. A sheriff must be legally qualified, and have been qualified as an advocate or solicitor for at least 10 years. The maximum sentencing power of sheriff in summary proceedings is 12 months imprisonment, or a fine of up to £10,000. In solemn proceedings the maximum sentence is 5 years imprisonment, or an unlimited fine.

Sheriffs also preside over fatal accident inquiries which are convened to examine the circumstances around sudden or suspicious deaths, including those who die in the course of employment, in custody, or in secure accommodation.

=====&quot;Summary sheriffs&quot;=====
Summary sheriffs hear civil cases brought under Simple Procedure and criminal cases brought under summary proceedings. Their sentencing powers are identical to a sheriff sitting in summary proceedings.

===Republic of Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, a sheriff () is appointed under section 12(3) of the Court Officers Act 1945, to perform some of the functions that would otherwise be performed by the county registrar. In practice, two types of sheriff have been appointed:

Four sheriffs (one each for Dublin city, County Dublin, Cork city, and County Cork) are full-time public officials whose responsibilities are:

* enforcing court orders of the Circuit Court, such as eviction or debt collection
* acting as returning officer in public elections
* executing tax certificates on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners

Fourteen sheriffs, colloquially called &quot;Revenue sheriffs&quot;, have only the third of the preceding functions, the others being done by the county registrar&#x27;s office. Revenue sheriffs are solicitors in private practice. Each covers a Bailiwick, which consist of one or more of the state&#x27;s remaining counties. The Bailiwicks are grouped by counties as follows: Carlow and Kildare; Cavan, Leitrim, Longford and Monaghan; Clare and Limerick; Donegal; Galway; Kerry; Kilkenny and Waterford; Laois, Offaly and Tipperary; Louth, Meath and Westmeath; Mayo; Roscommon and Sligo; and Wexford and Wicklow.

Prior to the 1922 creation of the Irish Free State, Irish law regarding sheriffs mirrored that of England, latterly with each administrative county and county borough having a ceremonial high sheriff and functional under-sheriffs responsible for enforcing court orders of the county court or quarter sessions. The Courts of Justice Act 1924 replaced these courts with a new circuit court. The Court Officers Act 1926 formally abolished high sheriffs and phased out under-sheriffs by providing that, as each retired, his functions would be transferred to the county registrar, established by the 1926 act as an officer of the circuit court. When the Dublin city under-sheriff retired in 1945, the city registrar was too overworked with other responsibilities to take over his duties, so the Court Officers Act 1945 was passed to allow a new office of sheriff to take over some or all of the under-sheriff&#x27;s functions. The four Dublin and Cork sheriffs were soon appointed, with much of the under-sheriff&#x27;s responsibilities. Revenue sheriffs were introduced for the rest of the state in the late 1980s as part of a crackdown on tax evasion. In 1993 the comptroller and auditor general expressed concern that funds collected and held in trust by sheriffs on behalf of the revenue commissioners were at risk of commingling. This was reformed in 1998 by prohibiting sheriffs from retaining the interest earned on such monies and, to compensate, increasing their retainer. Through to the 1990s the sheriff&#x27;s post was in the gift of the minister for justice, but by the 2010s it was advertised by the Public Appointments Service. A 1988 Law Reform Commission report made recommendations for updating the 1926 law on sheriffs; few of these had been implemented, and the government began a review of the role of sheriffs in state work.

Under section 12(5) of the Court Officers Act 1945, an appointee for sheriff must be either:

* A barrister who has practiced for no less than five years; or
* A solicitor who has practiced for not less than five years; or
* Have acted for not less than five years as managing clerk or principal assistant to an under-sheriff or sheriff.

==Asia==

===India===
Among cities in India, only Mumbai (Bombay), Kolkata (Calcutta) and Chennai (Madras), the three former British presidencies, have had sheriffs. First established in the 18th century based on the English high sheriffs, they were the executive arm of the judiciary, responsible for assembling jurors, bringing people to trial, supervising the gaoling (imprisonment) of prisoners and seizing and selling property. After the mid-19th century the responsibilities and powers of the role were reduced and the positions became ceremonial. The sheriffs of Mumbai and Kolkata still exist, although the post in Chennai was abolished in 1998.

In present times the sheriff has an apolitical, non-executive role, presides over various city-related functions and conferences and welcomes foreign guests. The post is second to the mayor in the protocol list.
===Philippines===
In the Philippines, a former colony of the United States, the office of sheriff also exists. The duties of a sheriff are to primarily serve all writs, execute all processes, and carry into effect all decisions and orders issued by the courts. Sheriffs execute process without attempting to determine their validity.

==Oceania==
===Australia===
A sheriff&#x27;s office exists in most Australian states and territories, with various duties.

* Before 1824, prisons in the British penal colony of New South Wales were overseen by the provost marshal. This title/position was replaced by that of sheriff when a &quot;charter of justice&quot; was proclaimed in 1824. In addition to detaining accused criminals awaiting trial, the sheriff executed death sentences and other sentences, controlled gaols, and handled prison movements, including the chain gangs that worked on Goat Island and in Sydney. In 1867, the sheriff began to be replaced by an independent prisons department, led by an inspector general, which was later renamed comptroller general. Most Australian states adopted this mode of prison oversight for many years. In New South Wales, the office of the sheriff is part of Courts and Tribunal Services. The office has more than 400 employees at 58 sheriffs&#x27; offices. In addition to enforcing writs, warrants, and property seizure orders issued by New South Wales courts and tribunals, the office of the sheriff also provides court security and administers the state&#x27;s jury service.
* In Victoria, the sheriff&#x27;s office is part of the Victoria Department of Justice and Regulation. The office enforces warrants and orders issued by Victoria courts dealing with unpaid fines (in criminal matters) and unpaid money judgments (in civil matters). The Victoria sheriff&#x27;s office has various enforcement powers against judgment debtors; they may seize and sell a debtor&#x27;s assets to satisfy a judgment, place a wheel clamp on a debtor&#x27;s car, or direct VicRoads to suspend a debtor&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license or vehicle registration.
* The Sheriff of Western Australia – also known as the Sheriff of the Supreme Court, Marshal of the Family Court and Marshal of the Federal Court in Western Australia – is an officer of those courts, as well as the District Court and the Magistrates Court. The Sheriff has two main roles.
** &quot;Enforcement services&quot;: managing the serving of court documents, including summonses, and the execution of writs, warrants and orders to recover unpaid fines or debts resulting from court judgments; as such, the Sheriff is also responsible for the appointment of bailiffs – who carry out the above services on behalf of the sheriff.
** &quot;Jury services&quot;: preparing jury books, which list people potentially available for jury duty, within 17 jury districts in Western Australia, as well as actually summoning people to act as jurors in the Supreme and District courts. The sheriff also investigates any failure by jurors to attend court and also has responsibility for the day-to-day management of juries sitting in the Perth metropolitan area.

===New Zealand===
Sheriffs in New Zealand are officers of the Superior Courts and function as the executive arm of these courts. The role of sheriff is automatically given to anyone who has gained the position of Registrar of the High Court.

==North America==
===Canada===

Every province and territory in Canada operates a sheriffs service. In most of Canada, sheriffs are almost exclusively concerned with courtroom security, post-arrest offender transfer, the serving of legal processes, and the execution of civil judgments. Regardless of their exact duties, sheriffs, sheriff&#x27;s deputies, and sheriffs officers are considered under &quot;peace officers&quot; in the Criminal Code.

====Alberta====
The Alberta Sheriffs Branch is responsible for courtroom and legislative security, offender transport, commercial vehicle safety and enforcement, and fish and wildlife enforcement. In addition to this uniquely broad mandate, the Branch operates a highway patrol, which supplements local and RCMP policing on provincial highways.

In 2019, sheriffs began to respond to 9-1-1 calls in rural areas to assist the RCMP and local police services in responding to rural crime concerns. In 2023, the province piloted a program that saw sheriffs patrol alongside municipal police officers in Calgary and Edmonton.

====British Columbia====

The British Columbia Sheriff Service is responsible for courtroom security and offender transport.

The issuance of court orders is the responsibility of court bailiffs. These services are contracted out to private civil law enforcement firms.

====Newfoundland and Labrador====

The Office of the High Sheriff of Newfoundland and Labrador provides protection and enforcement duties in support of the provincial, supreme, and appeal courts in the province. The sheriffs also assists local law enforcement agencies with additional resources to ensure public safety under the provincial Emergency Preparedness Program.

====Nova Scotia====
In Nova Scotia, the Nova Scotia Sheriff Services focuses on the safety and security of the judiciary, court staff, the public, and persons in custody. There are local sheriffs for every county in Nova Scotia, numbering over 200 in total. They work with up to 20,000 inmates and travel over 2 million kilometres in a year. Sheriffs are responsible for: court security; the transportation of prisoners to and from institutions and all levels of court; the service of some civil and criminal documents; and the execution of court orders.

==== Ontario ====
In Ontario, sheriffs are part of the Enforcement Office in the Superior Court of Justice, which was previously named (and is still sometimes referred to as) the Sheriff&#x27;s Office. They are mainly responsible for issuing and enforcing writs of the court, such as in jury selection, debt collection and evictions. Courtroom security and offender transport services are provided by local police services or, where none exists, the Ontario Provincial Police.

==== Quebec ====
Sheriffs () are responsible for the jury selection process. They handle court orders, orders, and writs while they are involved in seizure and sale of property.

Court security is the responsibility of armed provincial special constables, while offender transport is the responsibility of the province&#x27;s correction service.

===United States===
The sheriff is most often an elected county official who serves as the chief civilian law enforcement officer of their jurisdiction. The sheriff enforces court orders and mandates and may perform duties such as evictions, seizing property and assets pursuant to court orders, and serving warrants and legal papers. In some counties where urban areas have their own police departments, a sheriff may be restricted to civil procedure enforcement duties, while in other counties, the sheriff may serve as the principal police force and have jurisdiction over all of the county&#x27;s municipalities, including those that maintain their own municipal police departments. A sheriff often administers the county jails and is responsible for court security functions within their jurisdiction. The office of sheriff as county official in colonial North America is recorded from the 1640s.
In the modern United States, the scope of a sheriff varies across states and counties (which in Louisiana are called &quot;parishes&quot; and in Alaska &quot;boroughs&quot;).

==South Africa==

In South Africa, the sheriffs are officers of the court and function as the executive arm of the court. They are responsible for serving court processes like summonses and subpoenas. They play an important role in the execution of court orders like the attachments of immovable and movable property; evictions, demolitions etc.

The Sheriffs Act 90 of 1986, which came into operation on 1 March 1990, governs the profession. A sheriff is appointed by the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development in terms of Section 2 of the Act.

==Related offices==
===Norway===

In Norway until 2021 there was the office of , which in their mostly rural police districts had functions similar to those of a US sheriff, consisting of the duties of 

The was directly subordinate to the (county governor) until 1994, when the office became subordinate to the local chief of police (). In 2000, a lot of civilian duties were transferred to the regular police (), and much of the difference between the and disappeared. The office is now called (police station chief), or in some places (police unit chief).

Because the police has taken over most typical &#x27;sheriffs&#x27; duties from the year 2000 onwards, there is no longer a difference between the former rank of a &quot;sheriff&#x27;s deputy&quot; () and that of a regular police officer ().

The lensmann has been elected by the municipal council since the year 1293, but was nominated by the , the appointed governor.

===Iceland===

In Iceland, &quot;sýslumenn&quot; (singular , translated &quot;sheriff&quot;) are administrators of the state, holders of the executive power in their jurisdiction and heads of their Sheriff&#x27;s Office. Sheriffs are in charge of certain legal matters that typically involve registration of some sort and executing the orders of the court. The duties of the sheriffs differ slightly depending on their jurisdiction but they can be broadly categorised as:

* Duties of all sheriffs: marital matters (such as general registration of marital status and performing civil marriages), statutory matters, inheritance matters and more.

* Duties of all sheriffs except in Reykjavík: collection of public fees, publication of licences and permits for various personal and business purposes and more.

* Special duties of some sheriffs: in some jurisdictions the sheriff is also the commissioner of police.

There are 24 sheriffs and sheriff jurisdictions in Iceland. The jurisdictions are not defined by the administrative divisions of Iceland but are mainly a mixture of counties and municipalities.

The post of sheriff was mandated by the Old Covenant, an agreement between the Icelandic Commonwealth and the Kingdom of Norway. The agreement which was ratified between 1262 and 1264 makes the post of sheriff the oldest secular position of government still operating in Iceland.

<text>Wyandotte ( ) is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 25,058 at the 2020 census.

Wyandotte is located in southeastern Michigan, approximately south of Detroit on the Detroit River, and it is part of the collection of communities known as Downriver. Wyandotte is bounded by Southgate to the west, Lincoln Park to the northwest, Riverview to the south, Grosse Ile Township to the southeast, Ecorse to the north, and LaSalle, Ontario on the east.

Wyandotte is a sister city to Komaki, Japan. Each year delegates from Komaki come to Wyandotte to tour the city.

==History==
===18th century===
In the 18th century, this area was a small village of the Wyandot (or Wendat) called &quot;Maquaqua&quot;. Local French colonists called it &quot;Monguagon&quot;, a transliteration of its pronunciation in French.

The Wyandot were Iroquoian-speaking and part of the Huron nation from the Georgian Bay area of Canada. They generally lived peacefully with the few white French farmers, exchanging products and favors.

During the French and Indian War (part of the Seven Years&#x27; War in Europe), the Wyandot were allied with the Potawatomi and the French. English had taken control of the garrisoned Fort of Detroit. Near here, Chief Pontiac plotted his attack against the British fort in 1763 but failed.

The center of the village was nearly parallel to Biddle Avenue between Oak Street and Eureka Road near the river and its sandy beach, which was a welcome feature to the local tribesmen, as their main mode of transportation to the fort in Detroit was by birch bark canoe. The tribe was considered peaceable and friendly with the British, the remaining French in the area, and the newly arrived Americans.

===19th century===
In 1818, after the United States had gained independence and then control over this area from the British, the Wyandot signed a treaty with the U.S. government ceding this land. Some Wyandot moved to an area near Flat Rock, Michigan, then to Ohio, and Indian Territory, in Kansas and finally Oklahoma.

Most of the Wyandot moved across the Detroit River to Canada and what is now Anderdon, Windsor, Ontario. Many of their descendants live there today. The name somewhat lives on as Wyandotte County, Kansas.

The Anglo-Americans later credited Major John Biddle as the first white settler in Wyandotte, but French colonists had lived in the area for more than a century before he settled there.

After the War of 1812 and the Wyandot cession, Major Biddle purchased 2,200 acres (9 km2) of land from the federal government in 1818. He developed a farm and a summer estate. The buildings were completed around 1835, and he named his estate &quot;Wyandotte&quot; after the Indians who were still living in the area.

John S. Van Alstyne, general manager for Eber Ward of both the Eureka Iron &amp; Steel Works and the associated Wyandotte Rolling Mills, laid out the master plan for the city. This plan was frequently called the &quot;Philadelphia Plan&quot;, as streets were laid out on a north–south and east–west grid, similar to those in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. That plan was made by colonial founder William Penn.

In Wyandotte, the focal point was the Detroit River, and the first street parallel became Front Street. This street was eventually extended and renamed Van Alstyne Boulevard in 1921. Streets running parallel to Front Street were named according to numbers, from First to the extent of the territory involved. Streets running horizontal to the numbered streets were named for trees and plants.

Founded as a village of Ecorse Township in 1854, Wyandotte was incorporated as a city, and granted a charter by the State of Michigan, on December 12, 1866. It held its first city election in April 1867, making it the oldest incorporated city in Wayne County after Detroit. On April 8, 1867, the Village of Wyandotte was incorporated as a home rule city.

===20th century===
A community named New Jerusalem, consisting of immigrants from multiple nations, was founded nearby in the 1890s. It has since been absorbed by Wyandotte. It was incorporated as a village with the name of Glenwood in 1900. In 1901 a post office was established here with the name of Bacon since there was already a Glenwood post office in Wayne Township, Cass County, Michigan. Wyandotte annexed the community in 1905.

The community of Ford City was founded as a village in 1902. It was named for John B. Ford who ran the Michigan Alkali Company there. In 1922 it merged with Wyandotte. On April 14, 1924, Wyandotte annexed a large section of Ecorse Township.

Since settlement by eastern Americans, Wyandotte has been influenced by immigrants from many nations. Ethnic German, Polish, Irish and Italian communities have contributed much from their cultures. The city attracted African Americans for industrial jobs, but had a discriminatory past as a sundown town. It refused to allow them as residents.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The city is southwest of Downtown Detroit. The Detroit River forms the eastern boundary of the city, and the uninhabited Grassy Island is administered by the city. The Ecorse River also forms a small northern boundary of the city.

==Business and industry==

An early figure was Captain John Baptiste Ford, who used the salt to create soda ash, which in turn was used to create plate glass. In 1893, he created Michigan Alkali Company, which created baking soda, soda ash and lye. The company, later renamed Wyandotte Chemicals Co., went on to create a variety of soaps and cleaners, eventually becoming part of BASF and expanding into the BASF industrial complex.

Ward also help create Wyandotte&#x27;s shipbuilding role, which existed from the 1870s into the 1920s. During that time, a wide variety of boats were created along Wyandotte&#x27;s riverbank, from steamers and tugs to huge ferries. In 1873, Ward&#x27;s Wyandotte Iron Ship Building Works built the nation&#x27;s earliest steel-hulled vessel, a tugboat called the Sport. This shipbuilding industry was immortalized in 1942 in the painting of several murals which still exist today in the auditorium of Theodore Roosevelt High School.

Beginning in the 1920s Wyandotte was a major source of toy production, with the All Metal Products Company founded in 1920 and located in Wyandotte on Sycamore Street between 14th and 15th streets. From the 1920s until the 1950s the company, under the name &quot;Wyandotte Toys&quot;, was the largest manufacturer of toy guns and pistols in the US, producing a wide variety of pop guns, clicker pistols, dart guns, cap guns and a variety of plastic pistols. The company also produced a wide range of toy airplanes and other vehicles by pressing scrap metal obtained from local automobile factories. The company&#x27;s motto was &quot;Wyandotte Toys Are Good and Safe.&quot; In the early 1950s the company moved to Ohio, and it was bought out by Louis Marx and Company three years later.

Bishop Park, located on the riverfront north of downtown, once had a dock to board the Boblo Boat ferry to Boblo Island.

Today, much of the remaining industry is minor, with a notable exception being BASF Wyandotte on the city&#x27;s north riverfront.

In July 2002, three workers at an Atofina plant in neighboring Riverview were killed when a rail car leaked a colorless gas called methyl mercaptan. The gas exploded into flames and led to the emergency evacuation of 3,100 area residents, including some Wyandotte citizens.

The city is served by three newspapers: the regional &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; and &quot;The Detroit News&quot;; as well as &quot;The News-Herald&quot;, which is a more local paper serving the Downriver communities and has roots tracing back to two former newspapers that were published in Wyandotte. Wyandotte is also in the Detroit radio and television markets.

==Government and municipal services==

The mayor and City Council and other elected officials oversee the community&#x27;s governance. Wyandotte has its own community owned municipal services, called Wyandotte Municipal Services, it provides its own power through a municipal power plant and operates city-owned water and cable television services.

The Wyandotte Police Department, like that of its fellow Downriver community Woodhaven, has a Police Explorers post for youths ages 14–21 that have an interest in law enforcement.

Wyandotte&#x27;s community is served by the Bacon Memorial District Library, a member of the tri-county library system The Library Network. Built out of the Ford-Bacon House on Vinewood Street, it replaced the Wyandotte Carnegie Library in 1942; following the death of Congressman Mark R. Bacon, his widow Mary Ford-Bacon deeded the building to the city. The staff offer guided tours through the historic part of the building.

<text>Edward Elgar composed his Variations on an Original Theme, Op. 36, popularly known as the Enigma Variations, between October 1898 and February 1899. It is an orchestral work comprising fourteen variations on an original theme.

Elgar dedicated the work &quot;to my friends pictured within&quot;, each variation being a musical sketch of one of his circle of close acquaintances (see musical cryptogram). Those portrayed include Elgar&#x27;s wife Alice, his friend and publisher Augustus J. Jaeger and Elgar himself. In a programme note for a performance in 1911 Elgar wrote:

In naming his theme &quot;Enigma&quot;, Elgar posed a challenge which has generated much speculation but has never been conclusively answered. The Enigma is widely believed to involve a hidden melody.

After its 1899 London premiere the &quot;Variations&quot; achieved immediate popularity and established Elgar&#x27;s international reputation.

== History ==
Elgar described how on the evening of 21 October 1898, after a tiring day&#x27;s teaching, he sat down at the piano. A melody he played caught the attention of his wife and he began to improvise variations on it in styles which reflected the character of some of his friends. These improvisations, expanded and orchestrated, became the &quot;Enigma Variations&quot;. Elgar considered including variations portraying Arthur Sullivan and Hubert Parry, but was unable to assimilate their musical styles without pastiche and dropped the idea.

The piece was finished on 18 February 1899 and published by Novello &amp; Co. It was first performed at St James&#x27;s Hall in London on 19 June 1899, conducted by Hans Richter. Critics were at first irritated by the layer of mystification, but most praised the substance, structure and orchestration of the work. Elgar later revised the final variation, adding 96 new bars and an organ part. The new version (which is usually played today) was first heard at the Worcester Three Choirs Festival on 13 September 1899, with Elgar conducting.

The European continental premiere was performed in Düsseldorf, Germany on 7 February 1901, under Julius Buths (who would also conduct the German premiere of &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; in December 1901). The work quickly achieved many international performances, from Saint Petersburg, where it delighted Alexander Glazunov and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in 1904, to New York, where Gustav Mahler conducted it in 1910.

This masterpiece was written for Elgar&#x27;s friend, editor, and publisher, Augustus Jaeger. Elgar struggled with depression and questioned his own worth and abilities. Through the years they worked together, Jaeger was there for Elgar through depressive episodes, and reaffirming the composers&#x27; abilities.

==Orchestration==
The work is scored for an orchestra consisting of 2 flutes (one doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in B, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in F, 3 trumpets in F, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, side drum, triangle, bass drum, cymbals, organ (ad lib) and strings.

==Structure==

The theme is followed by 14 variations. The variations spring from the theme&#x27;s melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements, and the extended fourteenth variation forms a grand finale.

Elgar dedicated the piece to &quot;my friends pictured within&quot; and in the score each variation is prefaced the initials, name or nickname of the friend depicted. As was common with painted portraits of the time, Elgar&#x27;s musical portraits depict their subjects at two levels. Each movement conveys a general impression of its subject&#x27;s personality. In addition, many of them contain a musical reference to a specific characteristic or event, such as a laugh, a habit of speech or a memorable conversation. The sections of the work are as follows.

===Theme (Enigma: &quot;Andante&quot;)===
The unusual melodic contours of the G minor opening theme convey a sense of searching introspection:
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&quot; { \clef treble \time 4/4 \tempo &quot;Andante&quot; 4 = 63 \key g \minor
 r4^&quot;legato e sostenuto&quot; bes8--\p_&quot;molto espress.&quot; g-- c4( a) | r d(^&quot;ten.&quot; bes) a8-- c-- | r4 bes8--\&lt; d--\! g4(\&gt; a,\!) |
 r\pp f&#x27;\&gt;( g,)\! a8-- bes-- | r4 a8--_&quot;cresc.&quot; g-- d&#x27;4( bes)| r bes(^&quot;ten.&quot;_&quot;dim.&quot; g) a8-- g-- \bar &quot;||&quot; b4}
&lt;/score&gt;
A switch to the major key introduces a flowing motif which briefly lightens the mood before the first theme returns, now accompanied by a sustained bass line and emotionally charged counterpoints.

In a programme note for a 1912 performance of his setting of Arthur O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s ode &quot;The Music Makers&quot;, Elgar wrote of this theme (which he quoted in the later work), &quot;it expressed when written (in 1898) my sense of the loneliness of the artist as described in the first six lines of the Ode, and to me, it still embodies that sense.&quot;

Elgar&#x27;s personal identification with the theme is evidenced by his use of its opening phrase (which matches the rhythm and inflection of his name) as a signature in letters to friends.

The theme leads into Variation I without a pause.

===Variation I (&quot;L&#x27;istesso tempo&quot;) &quot;C.A.E.&quot;===
Caroline Alice Elgar, Elgar&#x27;s wife. The variation repeats a four-note melodic fragment which Elgar reportedly whistled when arriving home to his wife. After Alice&#x27;s death, Elgar wrote, &quot;The variation is really a prolongation of the theme with what I wished to be romantic and delicate additions; those who knew C.A.E. will understand this reference to one whose life was a romantic and delicate inspiration.&quot;

(In these notes Elgar&#x27;s words are quoted from his posthumous publication &quot;My Friends Pictured Within&quot; which draws on the notes he provided for the Aeolian Company&#x27;s 1929 pianola rolls edition of the &quot;Variations&quot;.)
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \key g \minor \time 4/4 \tempo &quot;L&#x27;istesso tempo.&quot; 4 = 63 r4\f^&quot;largamente&quot;_&quot;espress.&quot; \times 2/3 {d8( bes d)} c4~ c8 r8 }
&lt;/score&gt;

===Variation II (&quot;Allegro&quot;) &quot;H.D.S-P.&quot;===
Hew David Steuart-Powell. Elgar wrote, &quot;Hew David Steuart-Powell was a well-known amateur pianist and a great player of chamber music. He was associated with B.G.N. (cello) and the composer (violin) for many years in this playing. His characteristic diatonic run over the keys before beginning to play is here humorously travestied in the semiquaver passages; these should suggest a Toccata, but chromatic beyond H.D.S-P.&#x27;s liking.&quot;
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \key g \minor \time 3/8 \tempo &quot;Allegro.&quot; r16 g-.]\p_&quot;stacc.&quot; d&#x27;-.[ gis,-.] cis-.[ a-.] | c!-.[ a-.] bes-.[ g!-.] es-.[ c!-.] | cis-. d-. }
&lt;/score&gt;

===Variation III (&quot;Allegretto&quot;) &quot;R.B.T.&quot;===
Richard Baxter Townshend, Oxford don and author of the &quot;Tenderfoot&quot; series of books; brother-in-law of the W.M.B. depicted in Variation IV. This variation references R.B.T&#x27;s presentation of an old man in some amateur theatricals ‒ the low voice flying off occasionally into &quot;soprano&quot; timbre.

===Variation IV (&quot;Allegro di molto&quot;) &quot;W.M.B.&quot;===
William Meath Baker, squire of Hasfield, Gloucestershire and benefactor of several public buildings in Fenton, Stoke-on-Trent, brother-in-law of R.B.T. depicted in Variation III, and (step) uncle of Dora Penny in Variation X. He &quot;expressed himself somewhat energetically&quot;. This is the shortest of the variations.

===Variation V (&quot;Moderato&quot;) &quot;R.P.A.&quot;===
Richard Penrose Arnold, the son of the poet Matthew Arnold, and an amateur pianist. This variation leads into the next without pause.

===Variation VI (&quot;Andantino&quot;) &quot;Ysobel&quot;===
Isabel Fitton, a viola pupil of Elgar. Elgar explained, &quot;It may be noticed that the opening bar, a phrase made use of throughout the variation, is an &#x27;exercise&#x27; for crossing the strings – a difficulty for beginners; on this is built a pensive and, for a moment, romantic movement.&quot;
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 \relative c&#x27; { \clef alto \time 3/2 \key c \major \tempo &quot;Andantino.&quot; 2 = 48 g-.\p c,-. e&#x27;2~\&lt;^&quot;espress.&quot;( e4\!\&gt; d8)\! r8 }
&lt;/score&gt;

===Variation VII (&quot;Presto&quot;) &quot;Troyte&quot;===
Arthur Troyte Griffith, a Malvern architect and one of Elgar&#x27;s firmest friends. The variation, with a time signature of , good-naturedly mimics his enthusiastic incompetence on the piano. It may also refer to an occasion when Griffith and Elgar were out walking and got caught in a thunderstorm. The pair took refuge in the house of Winifred and Florence Norbury (Sherridge, Leigh Sinton, near Malvern), to which the next variation refers.

===Variation VIII (&quot;Allegretto&quot;) &quot;W.N.&quot;===
Winifred Norbury, one of the secretaries of the Worcester Philharmonic Society. &quot;Really suggested by an eighteenth-century house. The gracious personalities of the ladies are sedately shown. W.N. was more connected with the music than others of the family, and her initials head the movement; to justify this position a little suggestion of a characteristic laugh is given.&quot;

This variation is linked to the next by a single note held by the first violins.

===Variation IX (&quot;Adagio&quot;) &quot;Nimrod&quot;===
The name of the variation refers to Augustus J. Jaeger, who was employed as a music editor by the London publisher Novello &amp; Co. He was a close friend of Elgar&#x27;s, giving him useful advice but also severe criticism, something Elgar greatly appreciated. Elgar later related how Jaeger had encouraged him as an artist and had stimulated him to continue composing despite setbacks. Nimrod is described in the Old Testament as &quot;a mighty hunter before the Lord&quot;, &quot;Jäger&quot; (which can also be spelt &quot;Jaeger&quot;) being German for hunter.

&quot;Nimrod&quot; is composed as a Baroque Sarabande, a dance in 3 time, with the emphasis often on the second beat of the bar.

In 1904 Elgar told Dora Penny (&quot;Dorabella&quot;) that this variation is not really a portrait, but &quot;the story of something that happened&quot;. Once, when Elgar had been very depressed and was about to give it all up and write no more music, Jaeger had visited him and encouraged him to continue composing. He referred to Ludwig van Beethoven, who had a lot of worries, but wrote more and more beautiful music. &quot;And that is what &quot;you&quot; must do&quot;, Jaeger said, and he sang the theme of the second movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 8 &quot;Pathétique&quot;. Elgar disclosed to Dora that the opening bars of &quot;Nimrod&quot; were made to suggest that theme. &quot;Can&#x27;t you hear it at the beginning? Only a hint, not a quotation.&quot;

This variation has become popular in its own right and is sometimes used at British funerals, memorial services, and other solemn occasions. It is always played at the Cenotaph, Whitehall in London at the National Service of Remembrance. A version was also played during the Hong Kong handover ceremony in 1997, at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games, and during the 2022 BBC Proms after the season was cut short due to the death of Queen Elizabeth II. The &quot;Nimrod&quot; variation was the final orchestral composition (before the national anthem) played by the Greek National Orchestra in a televised June 2013 concert, before the 75-year-old Athenian ensemble was dissolved in the wake of severe government cutbacks to televised programming.

An adaptation of the piece appears at the ending of the 2017 film &quot;Dunkirk&quot; in the score by Hans Zimmer.

===Variation X (&quot;Intermezzo: Allegretto&quot;) &quot;Dorabella&quot;===
Dora Penny, a friend whose stutter is gently parodied by the woodwinds. Dora, later Mrs. Richard Powell, was the daughter of the Revd (later Canon) Alfred Penny. Her stepmother was the sister of William Meath Baker, the subject of Variation IV. She was the recipient of another of Elgar&#x27;s enigmas, the so-called Dorabella Cipher. She described the &quot;Friends Pictured Within&quot; and &quot;The Enigma&quot; in two chapters of her book &quot;Edward Elgar, Memories of a Variation&quot;. This variation features a melody for solo viola.
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \time 3/4 \key g \major \tempo &quot;Allegretto.&quot; 4 = 80
 r4 r4 32 \pp (&lt;c g d&gt;32 32 ) r32 r8 | &lt;d \accent b g&gt;32 (&lt;e b g&gt;32 &lt;d b g&gt;32) r32 r8 &lt;g d b&gt;16-- &lt;fis d b&gt;-. &lt;fis d b&gt;-. &lt;e d b&gt;-. }
&lt;/score&gt;

===Variation XI (&quot;Allegro di molto&quot;) &quot;G.R.S.&quot;===
George Robertson Sinclair, the energetic organist of Hereford Cathedral. In the words of Elgar: &quot;The variation, however, has nothing to do with organs or cathedrals, or, except remotely, with G.R.S. The first few bars were suggested by his great bulldog, Dan (a well-known character) falling down the steep bank into the River Wye (bar 1); his paddling upstream to find a landing place (bars 2 and 3); and his rejoicing bark on landing (second half of bar 5). G.R.S. said, &#x27;Set that to music&#x27;. I did; here it is.&quot;

===Variation XII (&quot;Andante&quot;) &quot;B.G.N.&quot;===
Basil George Nevinson, an accomplished amateur cellist who played chamber music with Elgar. The variation is introduced and concluded by a solo cello. This variation leads into the next without pause.

===Variation XIII (&quot;Romanza: Moderato&quot;) &quot; * * * &quot;===
Possibly, Lady Mary Lygon of Madresfield Court near Malvern, a sponsor of a local music festival. &quot;The asterisks take the place of the name of a lady who was, at the time of the composition, on a sea voyage. The drums suggest the distant throb of the engines of a liner, over which the clarinet quotes a phrase from Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage&quot;.&quot;
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \time 3/4 \key g \major \tempo &quot;Moderato.&quot; 4 = 76 r4^&quot;Solo&quot; r c~(\pp | c^&quot;molto espress.&quot; bes4. aes8) | aes4~ aes8 }
&lt;/score&gt;

If it is Lady Mary, Elgar may have withheld her initials because of superstition surrounding the number 13, or he may have felt uneasy about publicly associating the name of a prominent local figure with music that had taken on a powerful emotional intensity. There is credible evidence to support the view that the variation&#x27;s atmosphere of brooding melancholy and its subtitle &quot;Romanza&quot; are tokens of a covert tribute to another woman, the name most frequently mentioned in this connection being that of Helen Weaver, who had broken off her engagement to Elgar in 1884 before sailing out of his life forever aboard a ship bound for New Zealand.

===Variation XIV (&quot;Finale: Allegro&quot;) &quot;E.D.U.&quot;===
Elgar himself, nicknamed &quot;Edu&quot; by his wife, from the German &quot;Eduard&quot;. The themes from two variations are echoed: &quot;Nimrod&quot; and &quot;C.A.E.&quot;, referring to Jaeger and Elgar&#x27;s wife Alice, &quot;two great influences on the life and art of the composer&quot;, as Elgar wrote in 1927. Elgar called these references &quot;entirely fitting to the intention of the piece&quot;.

The original version of this variation is nearly 100 bars shorter than the one now usually played. In July 1899, one month after the original version was finished Jaeger urged Elgar to make the variation a little longer. After some cajoling Elgar agreed, and also added an organ part. The new version was played for the first time at the Worcester Three Choirs Festival, with Elgar himself conducting, on 13 September 1899.

==Final inscription==
At the end of the full score he inscribed the words &quot;Bramo assai, poco spero, nulla chieggio&quot;. This is a quote from Torquato Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;, Book II, Stanza 16 (1595), albeit slightly altered from third to first person. It means: &quot;I long for much, I hope for little, I ask nothing&quot;. Like Elgar&#x27;s own name, this sentence too can be fitted easily into the Enigma theme.

==The Enigma==
The word &quot;Enigma&quot;, serving as a title for the theme of the &quot;Variations&quot;, was added to the score at a late stage, after the manuscript had been delivered to the publisher. Despite a series of hints provided by Elgar, the precise nature of the implied puzzle remains unknown.

Confirmation that Enigma is the name of the theme is provided by Elgar&#x27;s 1911 programme note (&quot;... Enigma, for so the theme is called&quot;) and in a letter to Jaeger dated 30 June 1899 he associates this name specifically with what he calls the &quot;principal motive&quot; – the G minor theme heard in the work&#x27;s opening bars, which (perhaps significantly) is terminated by a double bar. Whatever the nature of the attendant puzzle, it is likely to be closely connected with this &quot;Enigma theme&quot;.

Elgar&#x27;s first public pronouncement on the Enigma appeared in Charles A. Barry&#x27;s programme note for the first performance of the &quot;Variations&quot;:

Far from clarifying matters, this utterance seems to envelop the Enigma in further mysteries. The phrase &quot;dark saying&quot; can be read straightforwardly as an archaic synonym for enigma but might equally plausibly be interpreted as a cryptic clue, while the word &quot;further&quot; seems to suggest that the &quot;larger theme&quot; is distinct from the Enigma, forming a separate component of the puzzle.

Elgar provided another clue in an interview he gave in October 1900 to the editor of the &quot;Musical Times&quot;, F. G. Edwards, who reported:

Five years later, Robert John Buckley stated in his biography of Elgar (written with the composer&#x27;s close cooperation): &quot;The theme is a counterpoint on some well-known melody which is never heard.&quot;

Attempted solutions to the Enigma commonly propose a well-known melody which is claimed to be either a counterpoint to Elgar&#x27;s theme or in some other way linked to it. Musical solutions of this sort are supported by Dora Penny and Carice Elgar&#x27;s testimony that the solution was generally understood to involve a tune, and by the evidence from an anecdote describing how Elgar encoded the solution in a numbered sequence of piano keys. A rival school of thought holds that the &quot;larger theme&quot; which &quot;goes&quot; &quot;through and over the whole set&quot; is an abstract idea rather than a musical theme. The interpretation placed on the &quot;larger theme&quot; forms the basis of the grouping of solutions in the summary that follows.

Julian Rushton has suggested that any solution should satisfy five criteria: a &quot;dark saying&quot; must be involved; the theme &quot;is not played&quot;; the theme should be &quot;well known&quot; (as Elgar stated multiple times); it should explain Elgar&#x27;s remark that Dora Penny should have been, &quot;of all people&quot;, the one to solve the Enigma; and fifthly, some musical observations in the notes Elgar provided to accompany the pianola roll edition may be part of the solution. Furthermore, the solution (if it exists) &quot;must be multivalent, must deal with musical as well as cryptographic issues, must produce workable counterpoint within Elgar&#x27;s stylistic range, and must at the same time seem obvious (and not just to its begetter)&quot;.

Elgar accepted none of the solutions proposed in his lifetime, and took the secret with him to the grave.

The prospect of gaining new insights into Elgar&#x27;s character and composition methods, and perhaps revealing new music, continues to motivate the search for a definitive solution. But Norman Del Mar expressed the view that &quot;there would be considerable loss if the solution were to be found, much of the work&#x27;s attraction lying in the impenetrability of the riddle itself&quot;, and that interest in the work would not be as strong had the Enigma been solved during Elgar&#x27;s lifetime.

===Counterpoints===
Solutions in this category suggest a well-known tune which (in the proponent&#x27;s view) forms a counterpoint to the theme of the &quot;Variations&quot;.

*After Elgar&#x27;s death in 1934 Richard Powell (husband of Dorabella) published a solution proposing &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; as the countermelody. This theory has been elaborated by Roger Fiske, Eric Sams and Derek Hudson. Elgar himself, however, is on record as stating &quot;&quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; won&#x27;t do&quot;. Ernest Tomlinson revived the idea in 1976, providing his &quot;proof&quot; in the form of his set of variations &quot;Fantasia on Auld Lang Syne&quot;.
*Reviewing published Enigma solutions in 1939, Ernest Newman failed to identify any that met what he considered to be the required musical standard.
*A competition organized by the American magazine &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; in 1953 yielded one proposed counterpoint – the aria &quot;Una bella serenata&quot; from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (transposed to the minor key).
*In 1993 Brian Trowell, surmising that Elgar conceived the theme in E minor, proposed a simple counterpoint consisting of repeated semibreve E&#x27;s doubled at the octave – a device occasionally used by Elgar as a signature.
*In 1999 Julian Rushton reviewed solutions based on counterpoints with melodies including &quot;Home, Sweet Home&quot;, &quot;Loch Lomond&quot;, a theme from Brahms&#x27;s fourth symphony, the &quot;Meditation&quot; from Elgar&#x27;s oratorio &quot;The Light of Life&quot; and God Save the Queen – the last being Troyte Griffith&#x27;s suggestion from 1924, which Elgar had dismissed with the words &quot;Of course not, but it is so well-known that it is extraordinary no-one has found it&quot;.
*In 2009, composer Robert Padgett proposed Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;Ein feste Burg&quot; as a solution, which was later described as &quot;[lying] at the bottom of a rabbit hole of anagrams, cryptography, the poet Longfellow, the composer Mendelssohn, the Shroud of Turin, and Jesus, all of which he believes he found hiding in plain sight in the music.&quot;
*In 2021, architectural acoustician Zackery Belanger proposed Elgar&#x27;s own &quot;Like to the Damask Rose&quot; as a solution, claiming that the fourteen deaths described in the song align with the fourteen variations. Belanger arrived at this conclusion in his attempt to solve Elgar&#x27;s Dorabella Cipher, which he proposes has a rose-shaped key assembled from the cipher&#x27;s symbols.

A few more solutions of this type have been published in recent years. In the following three examples the counterpoints involve complete renditions of both the Enigma theme and the proposed &quot;larger theme&quot;, and the associated texts have obvious &quot;dark&quot; connotations.

*In his book on the &quot;Variations&quot; Patrick Turner advanced a solution based on a counterpoint with a minor key version the nursery rhyme &quot;Twinkle, twinkle, little star&quot;.
*Clive McClelland has proposed a counterpoint with Sabine Baring-Gould&#x27;s tune for the hymn &quot;Now the Day Is Over&quot; (also transposed to the minor).
*&quot;Tallis&#x27;s canon&quot;, the tune for the hymn &quot;Glory to Thee, my God, this night&quot;, features as a cantus firmus in a solution which interprets the Enigma as a puzzle canon. This reading is suggested by the words &quot;for fuga&quot;, which appear among Elgar&#x27;s annotations to his sketch of the theme.

Another theory has been published in 2007 by Hans Westgeest. He has argued that the real theme of the work consists of only nine notes: G–E–A–F–B–F–F–A–G. The rhythm of this theme (in time, with a crotchet rest on the first beat of each bar) is based on the rhythm of Edward Elgar&#x27;s own name (&quot;Edward Elgar&quot;: short-short-long-long, then reversed long-long-short-short and a final note). Elgar meaningfully composed this short &quot;Elgar theme&quot; as a countermelody to the beginning of the hidden &quot;principal Theme&quot; of the piece, i.e. the theme of the slow movement of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Pathétique&quot; sonata, a melody which indeed is &quot;larger&quot; and &quot;well-known&quot;.
When the two themes are combined each note of (the first part of) the Beethoven theme is followed by the same note in the Elgar theme. So musically Elgar &quot;follows&quot; Beethoven closely, as Jaeger told him to do (see above, Var. IX) and, by doing so, in the vigorous, optimistic Finale the artist triumphs over his sadness and loneliness, expressed in the minor melody from the beginning. The whole piece is based on this &quot;Elgar theme&quot;, in which the Beethoven theme is hidden (and so the latter &quot;goes through and over the whole set, but is not played&quot;). Dora Penny could not solve the enigma. Elgar had expected she would: &quot;I&#x27;m surprised. I thought that you of all people would guess it.&quot; Even later she could not when Elgar had told her in private about the Beethoven story and the &quot;Pathétique&quot; theme behind the Jaeger/Nimrod-variation (see above, Var. IX) because she did not see the connection between this and the enigma.

===Other musical themes===
If Robert John Buckley&#x27;s statement about the theme being &quot;a counterpoint to some well-known melody&quot; (which is endorsed by what Elgar himself disclosed to F. G. Edwards in 1900) is disregarded or discounted the field opens up to admit other kinds of connection with well-known themes.

*Entries in this category submitted to the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; competition included the suggestions: &quot;When I am laid in earth&quot; from Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;, the Agnus Dei from Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor, the song &quot;None shall part us&quot; from &quot;Iolanthe&quot; and the theme from the slow movement of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Pathétique&quot; sonata. Elgar himself affirmed that this Beethoven theme is alluded to in variation IX.
*In 1985 Marshall Portnoy suggested that the key to the Enigma is Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;. Contrapunctus XIV of that work contains the BACH motif (in English notation, B–A–C–B) which, in Portnoy&#x27;s view, can also be found in the &quot;Variations&quot;. Moreover, the Art of Fugue consists of 14 individual fugues on the same subject (just as the Enigma variations are 14 variations on the same subject), and Bach signed his name &quot;B-A-C-H&quot; within the 14th fugue (just as Elgar signed his name &quot;EDU&quot; on the 14th variation), as well as other clues.
*Theodore van Houten proposed in 1975 &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; as the hidden melody on the strength of a resemblance between one of its phrases and the opening of the Enigma theme. The word which is sung to this phrase – a thrice-repeated &quot;never&quot; – appears twice in Elgar&#x27;s programme note, and the figure of Britannia on the penny coin provides a link with Dora Penny. The credibility of the hypothesis has received a boost from a report that it was endorsed by Elgar himself.
*Ed Newton-Rex superimposed the enigma theme on Pergolesi&#x27;s &quot;Stabat Mater&quot;, showing a clear contrapuntal relationship. He claims that the theme being written on top of existing music is the logical way of theme being created, so that is the approach to be used in solving the enigma. It is also worth noting the double barline which encloses the area based on the Stabat Mater.
*Other tunes which have been suggested on the basis of a postulated melodic or harmonic connection to Elgar&#x27;s theme include Chopin&#x27;s Nocturne in G minor, John Dunstable&#x27;s &quot;Ave Maris Stella&quot;, the Benedictus from Stanford&#x27;s Requiem, &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;, Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Four Serious Songs&quot;, William Boyce&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Oak&quot; (transposed to the minor), the Dies irae plainchant and Gounod&#x27;s &quot;March to Calvary&quot;.

===Non-musical themes===
*Ian Parrott wrote in his book on Elgar that the &quot;dark saying&quot;, and possibly the whole of the Enigma, had a biblical source, 1 Corinthians 13:12, which in the Authorised Version reads, &quot;For now we see through a glass, darkly (&quot;enigmate&quot; in the Latin of the Vulgate); but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.&quot; The verse is from St. Paul&#x27;s essay on love. Elgar was a practising Roman Catholic and on 12 February 1899, eight days before the completion of the &quot;Variations&quot;, he attended a Mass at which this verse was read.
*Edmund Green suggested that the &quot;larger theme&quot; is Shakespeare&#x27;s sixty-sixth sonnet and that the word &quot;Enigma&quot; stands for the real name of the Dark Lady of the Sonnets.
*Andrew Moodie, casting doubt on the idea of a hidden melody, postulated that Elgar constructed the Enigma theme using a cipher based on the name of his daughter, Carice.
*In 2010 Charles and Matthew Santa argued that the enigma was based on pi, following the misguided attempt by the Indiana House of Representatives to legislate the value of pi in 1897. Elgar created an original melody containing three references to Pi based on this humorous incident. The first four notes are scale degree 3–1–4–2, decimal pi, and fractional pi is hidden in the &quot;two drops of a seventh&quot; following the first 11 notes leading to × 11 = , fractional pi. His &quot;dark saying&quot; is a pun set off by an unexplained double bar after the first 24 notes (all black notes)...&quot;Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie (pi)&quot;. Shortly before his death, Elgar wrote three sentences about the variations and each sentence contains a hint at pi.
*Some writers have argued that the &quot;larger theme&quot; is friendship, or an aspect of Elgar&#x27;s personality, or that the Enigma is a private joke with little or no substance. 
*Inspector Mark Pitt has recently suggested (as reported by the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;) that the larger theme is &#x27;Prudentia&#x27; which in turn is related to the initials from the variation titles which then forms the Principal &#x27;Enigma&#x27; Variations theme.

==Subsequent history==
Elgar himself quoted many of his own works, including &quot;Nimrod&quot; (Variation IX), in his choral piece of 1912, &quot;The Music Makers&quot;. On 24 May 1912 Elgar conducted a performance of the &quot;Variations&quot; at a Memorial Concert in aid of the family survivors of musicians who had been lost in the Titanic disaster.

There is some speculation that the Enigma machine employed extensively by Nazi Germany during World War II was named after Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Enigma Variations&quot;.

Frederick Ashton&#x27;s ballet &quot;Enigma Variations (My Friends Pictured Within)&quot; is choreographed to Elgar&#x27;s score with the exception of the finale, which uses Elgar&#x27;s original shorter ending (see above), transcribed from the manuscript by John Lanchbery. The ballet, which depicts the friends and Elgar as he awaits Richter&#x27;s decision about conducting the premiere, received its first performance on 25 October 1968 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London.

The acclaimed 1974 television play &quot;Penda&#x27;s Fen&quot; includes a scene where the young protagonist has a vision of an aged Elgar who whispers to him the &quot;solution&quot; to the Enigma, occasioning astonishment on the face of the recipient. A solution to the Enigma also features in Peter Sutton&#x27;s 2007 play &quot;Elgar and Alice&quot;.

Elgar suggested that in case the &quot;Variations&quot; were to be a ballet the Enigma would have to be represented by &quot;a veiled dancer&quot;. Elgar&#x27;s remark suggested that the Enigma in fact pictured &quot;a friend&quot;, just like the variations. His use of the word &quot;veiled&quot; possibly indicates that it was a female character.

The &quot;Enigma Variations&quot; inspired a drama in the form of a dialogue – original title &quot;Variations Énigmatiques&quot; (1996) – by the French dramatist Éric-Emmanuel Schmitt.

The 2017 film &quot;Dunkirk&quot; features adapted versions of Elgar&#x27;s Variation IX (Nimrod), the primary adaptation given the name &quot;Variation 15&quot; on the soundtrack in honor of its inspiration.

== Recordings ==

There have been more than sixty recordings of the &quot;Variations&quot; since Elgar&#x27;s first recording, made by the acoustic process in 1924. Elgar himself conducted the Royal Albert Hall Orchestra for its first electrical recording in 1926 on the HMV label. That recording has been remastered for compact disc; the EMI CD couples it with Elgar&#x27;s Violin Concerto conducted by the composer with Yehudi Menuhin as the soloist. Sixty years later, Menuhin took the baton to conduct the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in the Variations for Philips, as a coupling to the Cello Concerto with Julian Lloyd Webber. Other conductors who have recorded the work include Arturo Toscanini, Sir John Barbirolli, Daniel Barenboim, Sir Georg Solti, Leonard Bernstein, Giuseppe Sinopoli, Leopold Stokowski, Eugene Ormandy, Pierre Monteux, William Steinberg and André Previn, as well as leading English conductors from Sir Henry Wood and Sir Adrian Boult to Sir Simon Rattle.

<text>Plato&#x27;s allegory of the cave is an allegory presented by the Greek philosopher Plato in his work &quot;Republic&quot; (514a–520a, Book VII) to compare &quot;the effect of education () and the lack of it on our nature&quot;. It is written as a dialogue between Plato&#x27;s brother Glaucon and his mentor Socrates and is narrated by the latter. The allegory is presented after the analogy of the Sun (508b–509c) and the analogy of the divided line (509d–511e).

In the allegory, Plato describes people who have spent their entire lives chained by their necks and ankles in front of an inner wall with a view of the empty outer wall of the cave. They observe the shadows projected onto the outer wall by objects carried behind the inner wall by people who are invisible to the chained “prisoners” and who walk along the inner wall with a fire behind them, creating the shadows on the inner wall in front of the prisoners. The &quot;sign bearers&quot; pronounce the names of the objects, the sounds of which are reflected near the shadows and are understood by the prisoners as if they were coming from the shadows themselves.

Only the shadows and sounds are the prisoners&#x27; reality, which are not accurate representations of the real world. The shadows represent distorted and blurred copies of reality we can perceive through our senses, while the objects under the Sun represent the true forms of objects that we can only perceive through reason. Three higher levels exist: natural science; deductive mathematics, geometry, and logic; and the theory of forms.

Socrates explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall are not the direct source of the images seen. A philosopher aims to understand and perceive the higher levels of reality. However, the other inmates of the cave do not even desire to leave their prison, for they know no better life.

Socrates remarks that this allegory can be paired with previous writings, namely the analogy of the Sun and the analogy of the divided line.

== Summary ==
=== Imprisonment in the cave ===
Plato begins by having Socrates ask Glaucon to imagine a cave where people have been imprisoned from childhood. These prisoners are chained so that their legs and necks are fixed, forcing them to gaze at the wall in front of them and not to look around at the cave, each other, or themselves (514a–b). Behind the prisoners is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners is a raised walkway with a low wall, behind which people walk carrying objects or puppets &quot;of men and other living things&quot; (514b).

The people walk behind the wall so their bodies do not cast shadows for the prisoners to see, but the objects they carry do (&quot;just as puppet showmen have screens in front of them at which they work their puppets&quot;) (514a). The prisoners cannot see any of what is happening behind them; they are only able to see the shadows cast upon the cave wall in front of them. The sounds of the people talking echo off the walls; the prisoners believe these sounds come from the shadows (514c).

Socrates suggests that the shadows are reality for the prisoners because they have never seen anything else; they do not realize that what they see are shadows of objects in front of a fire, much less that these objects are inspired by real things outside the cave which they do not see (514b–515a).

===Departure from the cave===
Socrates then supposes that the prisoners are released. A freed prisoner would look around and see the fire. The light would hurt his eyes and make it difficult for him to see the objects casting the shadows. If he were told that what he is seeing is &quot;real&quot; instead of the other version of reality he sees on the wall, he would not believe it. In his pain, Socrates continues, the freed prisoner would turn away and run back to what he is accustomed to (that is, the shadows of the carried objects). The light &quot;... would hurt his eyes, and he would escape by turning away to the things which he was able to look at, and these he would believe to be clearer than what was being shown to him&quot;.

Socrates continues: &quot;Suppose... that someone should drag him... by force, up the rough ascent, the steep way up, and never stop until he could drag him out into the light of the sun&quot;. The prisoner would be angry and in pain, and this would only worsen when the radiant light of the sun overwhelms his eyes and blinds him.

&quot;Slowly, his eyes adjust to the light of the sun. First he can see only shadows. Gradually he can see the reflections of people and things in water and then later see the people and things themselves. Eventually, he is able to look at the stars and moon at night until finally he can look upon the sun itself (516a)&quot;. Only after he can look straight at the sun &quot;is he able to reason about it&quot; and what it is (516b). (See also Plato&#x27;s analogy of the Sun, which occurs near the end of &quot;The Republic&quot;, Book VI.)

===Return to the cave===
Socrates continues, saying that the free prisoner would think that the world outside the cave was superior to the world he experienced in the cave and attempt to share this with the prisoners remaining in the cave attempting to bring them onto the journey he had just endured; &quot;he would bless himself for the change, and pity [the other prisoners]&quot; and would want to bring his fellow cave dwellers out of the cave and into the sunlight (516c).

The returning prisoner, whose eyes have become accustomed to the sunlight, would be blind when he re-entered the cave, just as he was when he was first exposed to the sun (516e). The prisoners who remained, according to the dialogue, would infer from the returning man&#x27;s blindness that the journey out of the cave had harmed him and that they should not undertake a similar journey. Socrates concludes that the prisoners, if they were able, would therefore reach out and kill anyone who attempted to drag them out of the cave (517a).

==Themes in the allegory appearing elsewhere in Plato&#x27;s work==
The allegory is related to Plato&#x27;s theory of Forms, according to which the &quot;Forms&quot; (or &quot;Ideas&quot;), and not the material world known to us through sensation, possess the highest and most fundamental kind of reality. Knowledge of the Forms constitutes real knowledge or what Socrates considers &quot;the Good&quot;. Socrates informs Glaucon that the most excellent people must follow the highest of all studies, which is to behold the Good. Those who have ascended to this highest level, however, must not remain there but must return to the cave and dwell with the prisoners, sharing in their labors and honors.

Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo&quot; contains similar imagery to that of the allegory of the cave; a philosopher recognizes that before philosophy, his soul was &quot;a veritable prisoner fast bound within his body... and that instead of investigating reality of itself and in itself is compelled to peer through the bars of a prison&quot;.

==Scholarly discussion==
Scholars debate the possible interpretations of the allegory of the cave, either looking at it from an epistemological standpoint—one based on the study of how Plato believes we come to know things—or through a political (politeia) lens. Much of the scholarship on the allegory falls between these two perspectives, with some completely independent of either. The epistemological view and the political view, prominently represented by Richard Lewis Nettleship and A. S. Ferguson, respectively, tend to be discussed most frequently.

Nettleship interprets the allegory of the cave as representative of our innate intellectual incapacity, in order to contrast our lesser understanding with that of the philosopher, as well as an allegory about people who are unable or unwilling to seek truth and wisdom. Ferguson, on the other hand, bases his interpretation of the allegory on the claim that the cave is an allegory of human nature and that it symbolizes the opposition between the philosopher and the corruption of the prevailing political condition.

Cleavages have emerged within these respective camps of thought, however. Much of the modern scholarly debate surrounding the allegory has emerged from Martin Heidegger&#x27;s exploration of the allegory, and philosophy as a whole, through the lens of human freedom in his book &quot;The Essence of Human Freedom: An Introduction to Philosophy and The Essence of Truth: On Plato&#x27;s Cave Allegory and Theaetetus&quot;. In response, Hannah Arendt, an advocate of the political interpretation of the allegory, suggests that through the allegory, Plato &quot;wanted to apply his own theory of ideas to politics&quot;. Conversely, Heidegger argues that the essence of truth is a way of being and not an object. Arendt criticised Heidegger&#x27;s interpretation of the allegory, writing that &quot;Heidegger... is off base in using the cave simile to interpret and &#x27;criticize&#x27; Plato&#x27;s theory of ideas&quot;.

Various scholars also debate the possibility of a connection between the work in the allegory and the cave and the work done by Plato considering the analogy of the divided line and the analogy of the Sun. The divided line is a theory presented to us in Plato&#x27;s work the &quot;Republic&quot;. This is displayed through a dialogue given between Socrates and Glaucon in which they explore the possibility of a visible and intelligible world, with the visible world consisting of items such as shadows and reflections (displayed as AB) then elevating to the physical item itself (displayed as BC) while the intelligible world consists of mathematical reasoning (displayed by CD) and philosophical understanding (displayed by DE).

Many see this as an explanation for the way in which the prisoner in the allegory of the cave goes through the journey, first in the visible world with shadows such as those on the wall, then the realization of the physical with the understanding of concepts such as the tree being separate from its shadow. It enters the intelligible world as the prisoner looks at the sun.


The Analogy of the Sun refers to the moment in book six in which Socrates, after being urged by Glaucon to define goodness, proposes instead an analogy through a &quot;child of goodness&quot;. Socrates reveals this &quot;child of goodness&quot; to be the Sun, proposing that just as the Sun illuminates, bestowing the ability to see and be seen by the eye with its light, so the idea of goodness illumines the intelligible with truth, leading some scholars to believe this forms a connection of the Sun and the intelligible world within the realm of the allegory of the cave.

==Influence==
The themes and imagery of Plato&#x27;s cave has influenced civil thought and culture. For instance:

* Francis Bacon used the term &quot;Idols of the Cave&quot; to refer to errors of reason arising from the idiosyncratic biases and preoccupations of individuals.
* In his 1658 discourse, &quot;Urn Burial&quot;, Thomas Browne states: &quot;A Dialogue between two Infants in the womb concerning the state of this world, might handsomely illustrate our ignorance of the next, whereof methinks we yet discourse in Platoes denne, and are but Embryon Philosophers&quot;.
* Evolutionary biologist Jeremy Griffith&#x27;s book &quot;A Species In Denial&quot; includes the chapter &quot;Deciphering Plato&#x27;s Cave Allegory&quot;.

=== In fiction and popular media ===
* The films &quot;The Conformist&quot; (1970), &quot;Cube&quot; (1997), &quot;Dark City&quot; (1998), &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (1998), &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999), &quot;The Thirteenth Floor (1999)&quot;, &quot;City of Ember&quot; (2008), &quot;Us&quot; (2019), and &quot;An Urban Allegory&quot; (2024) model Plato&#x27;s allegory of the cave, as does the TV series &quot;1899&quot;.
* &quot;The Cave&quot; by José Saramago culminates in the discovery of Plato&#x27;s Cave underneath the center, &quot;an immense complex fusing the functions of an office tower, a shopping mall and a condominium&quot;.
* Ray Bradbury&#x27;s novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (1953) explores the themes of reality and perception explored in Plato&#x27;s allegory of the cave and Bradbury references Plato&#x27;s work in the novel.
* Orphaned Land&#x27;s 2018 release &quot;Unsung Prophets &amp; Dead Messiahs&quot; is a concept album based on the allegory. Calling Plato an &quot;unsung prophet&quot;, frontman Kobi Farhi explains that the &quot;protest album&quot; describes how humanity embraces the darkness and that the people are afraid to break their chains and embrace the light.

<text>The Viking 2 mission was part of the American Viking program to Mars, and consisted of an orbiter and a lander essentially identical to that of the &quot;Viking 1&quot; mission. &quot;Viking 2&quot; was operational on Mars for sols ( days; ). The &quot;Viking 2&quot; lander operated on the surface for days, or sols, and was turned off on April 12, 1980, when its batteries eventually failed. The orbiter worked until July 25, 1978, returning almost 16,000 images in 706 orbits around Mars.

==Mission profile==
The craft was launched on September 9, 1975. Following launch using a Titan/Centaur launch vehicle and a 333-day cruise to Mars, the &quot;Viking 2&quot; Orbiter began returning global images of Mars prior to orbit insertion. The orbiter was inserted into a 1,500 x 33,000 km, 24.6 h Mars orbit on August 7, 1976, and trimmed to a 27.3 h site certification orbit with a periapsis of 1,499 km and an inclination of 55.2 degrees on August 9. The orbiter then began taking photographs of candidate landing sites, which were used to select the final landing site.

The lander separated from the orbiter on September 3, 1976, at 22:37:50 UT and landed at Utopia Planitia. The normal procedure called for the structure connecting the orbiter and lander (the bioshield) to be ejected after separation. However, due to problems with the separation process, the bioshield remained attached to the orbiter. The orbit inclination was raised to 75 degrees on September 30, 1976.

===Orbiter===
The orbiter&#x27;s primary mission ended on October 5, 1976, at the beginning of solar conjunction. The extended mission commenced on December 14, 1976, after the solar conjunction. On December 20, 1976, the periapsis was lowered to 778 km, and the inclination raised to 80 degrees.

Operations included close approaches to Deimos in October 1977, and the periapsis was lowered to 300 km and the period changed to 24 hours on October 23, 1977. The orbiter developed a leak in its propulsion system that vented its attitude control gas. It was placed in a 302 × 33,176 km orbit and turned off on July 25, 1978, after returning almost 16,000 images in about 700–706 orbits around Mars.

===Lander===

The lander and its aeroshell separated from the orbiter on September 3, 1976, at 19:39:59 UT. At the time of separation, the lander was orbiting at about 4 km/s. After separation, rockets fired to begin lander deorbit. After a few hours, at about 300 km attitude, the lander was reoriented for entry. The aeroshell with its ablative heat shield slowed the craft as it plunged through the atmosphere.

The &quot;Viking 2&quot; lander touched down about 200 km west of the crater Mie in Utopia Planitia at at an altitude of -4.23 km relative to a reference ellipsoid with an equatorial radius of 3,397.2 km and a flattening of 0.0105 ( planetographic longitude) at 22:58:20 UT (9:49:05 a.m. local Mars time).

Approximately of propellants were left at landing. Due to radar misidentification of a rock or highly reflective surface, the thrusters fired an extra time 0.4 seconds before landing, cracking the surface and raising dust. The lander settled down with one leg on a rock, tilted at 8.2 degrees. The cameras began taking images immediately after landing.

The &quot;Viking 2&quot; lander was powered by radioisotope generators and operated on the surface until its batteries failed on April 12, 1980.

In July 2001, the &quot;Viking 2&quot; lander was renamed the Gerald Soffen Memorial Station after Gerald Soffen (1926–2000), the project scientist of the &quot;Viking&quot; program.

==Results from the &quot;Viking 2&quot; mission==

===Landing site soil analysis===
The regolith, referred to often as &quot;soil,&quot; resembled those produced from the weathering of basaltic lavas. The tested soil contained abundant silicon and iron, along with significant amounts of magnesium, aluminum, sulfur, calcium, and titanium. Trace elements, strontium and yttrium, were detected.

The amount of potassium was one-fifth of the average for the Earth&#x27;s crust. Some chemicals in the soil contained sulfur and chlorine that were like those remaining after the evaporation of seawater. Sulfur was more concentrated in the crust on top of the soil than in the bulk soil beneath.

The sulfur may be present as sulfates of sodium, magnesium, calcium, or iron. A sulfide of iron is also possible. The &quot;Spirit&quot; rover and the &quot;Opportunity&quot; rover both found sulfates on Mars.

Minerals typical weathering products of mafic igneous rocks were found. All samples heated in the gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GCMS) gave off water.

However, the way the samples were handled prohibited an exact measurement of the amount of water. But, it was around 1%. Studies with magnets aboard the landers indicated that the soil is between 3 and 7 percent magnetic materials by weight. The magnetic chemicals could be magnetite and maghemite, which could come from the weathering of basalt rock. Subsequent experiments carried out by the Mars &quot;Spirit&quot; rover (landed in 2004) suggest that magnetite could explain the magnetic nature of the dust and soil on Mars.
===Search for life===
&quot;Viking 2&quot; carried a biology experiment whose purpose was to look for life. The &quot;Viking 2&quot; biology experiment weighed and consisted of three subsystems: the Pyrolytic Release experiment (PR), the Labeled Release experiment (LR), and the Gas Exchange experiment (GEX). In addition, independent of the biology experiments, &quot;Viking 2&quot; carried a Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GCMS) that could measure the composition and abundance of organic compounds in the Martian soil.

The results were Unusual and conflicting: the GCMS and GEX gave negative results, while the PR and LR gave positive results. Viking scientist Patricia Straat stated in 2009, &quot;Our (LR) experiment was a definite positive response for life, but a lot of people have claimed that it was a false positive for a variety of reasons.&quot;

Many scientists believe that the data results were attributed to inorganic chemical reactions in the soil. However, this view may be changing due to a variety of discoveries and studies since Viking. These include the discovery of near-surface ice near the Viking landing zone, the possibility of perchlorate destruction of organic matter, and the reanalysis of GCMS data by scientists in 2018. Some scientists still believe the results were due to living reactions. The formal declaration at the time of the mission was that the discovery of organic chemicals was inconclusive.

Mars has almost no ozone layer, unlike the Earth, so UV light sterilizes the surface and produces highly reactive chemicals such as peroxides that would oxidize any organic chemicals. The &quot;Phoenix&quot; Lander discovered the chemical perchlorate in the Martian soil. Perchlorate is a powerful oxidizing agent, which could have eradicated any organic material on the surface. Perchlorate is now considered widespread on Mars, making it hard to detect any organic compounds on the Martian surface.

===Viking program===

The Viking Orbiters led to significant discoveries about the presence of water on Mars. Huge river valleys were found in many areas. They showed that water floods carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of kilometers. In the southern hemisphere, the presence of branched stream areas suggests that there was once rainfall.

<doc id="89529" wikidata="Q623169" url="?curid=89529" title="Wallaby">
<text>A wallaby () is a small or middle-sized macropod native to Australia and New Guinea, with introduced populations in New Zealand, Hawaii, the United Kingdom and other countries. They belong to the same taxonomic family as kangaroos and sometimes the same genus, but kangaroos are specifically categorised into the four largest species of the family. The term &quot;wallaby&quot; is an informal designation generally used for any macropod that is smaller than a kangaroo or a wallaroo that has not been designated otherwise.
There are nine species (eight extant and one extinct) of the brush wallaby (genus &quot;Notamacropus&quot;). Their head and body length is and the tail is long. The 19 known species of rock-wallabies (genus &quot;Petrogale&quot;) live among rocks, usually near water; two species in this genus are endangered. The two living species of hare-wallabies (genus &quot;Lagorchestes&quot;; two other species in this genus are extinct) are small animals that have the movements and some of the habits of hares. The three species (two extant and one extinct) of nail-tail wallabies (genus &quot;Onychogalea&quot;) have one notable feature: a horny spur at the tip of the tail; its function is unknown. The seven species of pademelons or scrub wallabies (genus &quot;Thylogale&quot;) of New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, and Tasmania are small and stocky, with short hind limbs and pointed noses. The swamp wallaby (genus &quot;Wallabia&quot;) is the only species in its genus.
Another wallaby that is monotypic is the quokka or short-tailed scrub wallaby (genus &quot;Setonix&quot;); this species is now restricted to two offshore islands of Western Australia which are free of introduced predators. The seven species of dorcopsises or forest wallabies (genera &quot;Dorcopsis&quot; (four species, with a fifth as yet undescribed) and &quot;Dorcopsulus&quot; (two species)) are all native to the island of New Guinea.

One of the brush wallaby species, the dwarf wallaby (&quot;Notamacropus dorcopsulus&quot;), also native to New Guinea, is the smallest known wallaby species and one of the smallest known macropods. Its length is about from the nose to the end of the tail, and it weighs about .

Wallabies are hunted for meat and fur.

==Etymology and terminology==
The name &quot;wallaby&quot; comes from Dharug &quot;walabi&quot; or &quot;waliba&quot;. Another early name for the wallaby, in use from at least 1802, was the &quot;brush-kangaroo&quot;.

Young wallabies are referred to as &quot;joeys&quot;, like many other marsupials. Adult male wallabies are referred to as &quot;bucks&quot;, &quot;boomers&quot;, or &quot;jacks&quot;. Adult female wallabies are referred to as &quot;does&quot;, &quot;flyers&quot;, or &quot;jills&quot;. A group of wallabies is called a &quot;mob&quot;, &quot;court&quot;, or &quot;troupe&quot;. Scrub-dwelling and forest-dwelling wallabies are known as &quot;pademelons&quot; (genus &quot;Thylogale&quot;) and &quot;dorcopsises&quot; (genera &quot;Dorcopsis&quot; and &quot;Dorcopsulus&quot;), respectively.

==General description==

Although members of most wallaby species are small, some can grow up to approximately two metres in length (from the head to the end of the tail). Their powerful hind legs are not only used for bounding at high speeds and jumping great heights, but also to administer vigorous kicks to fend off potential predators. The tammar wallaby (&quot;Notamacropus eugenii&quot;) has elastic storage in the ankle extensor tendons, without which the animal&#x27;s metabolic rate might be 30–50% greater. It has also been found that the design of spring-like tendon energy savings and economical muscle force generation is key for the two distal muscle–tendon units of the tammar wallaby (&quot;Macropus-Eugenii&quot;). Wallabies also have a powerful tail that is used mostly for balance and support.

==Diet==

Wallabies are herbivores whose diet consists of a wide range of grasses, vegetables, leaves and other foliage. Due to recent urbanization, many wallabies now feed in rural and urban areas. Wallabies cover vast distances for food and water, which is often scarce in their environment. Mobs of wallabies often congregate around the same water hole during the dry season.

==Threats==

Wallabies face several threats. Dingoes, domestic and feral dogs, feral cats, and red foxes are among their predators. Humans also pose a significant threat to wallabies due to increased interaction (wallabies can defend themselves with hard kicks and biting). Many wallabies have been involved in vehicular accidents, as they often feed near roads and urban areas.

==Classification==
Wallabies are not a distinct genetic group. Nevertheless, they fall into several broad categories. Brush wallabies of the genus &quot;Notamacropus&quot;, like the agile wallaby (&quot;Notamacropus agilis&quot;) and the red-necked wallaby (&quot;Notamacropus rufogriseus&quot;), are most closely related to the kangaroos and wallaroos and, aside from their size, look very similar. These are the ones most frequently seen, particularly in the southern states.
Rock-wallabies (genus &quot;Petrogale&quot;), rather like the goats of the Northern Hemisphere, specialise in rugged terrain and have modified feet adapted to grip rock with skin friction rather than dig into soil with large claws. There are at least 19 species and the relationship between several of them is still poorly understood. Several species are endangered. Captive rock-wallaby breeding programs, like the one at Healesville Sanctuary, have had some success and a small number have recently been released into the wild.

The banded hare-wallaby (&quot;Lagostrophus fasciatus&quot;) is thought to be the last remaining member of the once numerous subfamily Sthenurinae, and although once common across southern Australia, it is now restricted to two islands off the Western Australian coast which are free of introduced predators. It is not as closely related to the other hare-wallabies (genus &quot;Lagorchestes&quot;) as the hare-wallabies are to the other wallabies.

New Guinea, which was, until fairly recent geological times, part of mainland Australia, has at least five species of wallabies.

==Natural range and habitat==
Wallabies are widely distributed across Australia, particularly in more remote, heavily timbered, or rugged areas, less so on the great semi-arid plains that are better suited to the larger, leaner, and more fleet-footed kangaroos. They also can be found on the island of New Guinea.

==Introduced populations==
Wallabies of several species have been introduced to other parts of the world, and there are a number of successfully breeding introduced populations, including:
* Kawau Island in New Zealand is home to large numbers of tammar, Parma, swamp and brush-tailed rock-wallabies from introductions made around 1870. They are considered pests on the island, but a programme to re-introduce them to Australia has met with only limited success.
* The Lake Tarawera area of New Zealand has a large tammar wallaby population.
* The South Canterbury district of New Zealand has a large population of Bennett&#x27;s wallabies.
* On the Isle of Man in the Ballaugh Curraghs area, there is a population of around 560 red-necked wallabies, descended from a pair that escaped from the nearby Curraghs Wildlife Park in 1970.
* Hawaii has a small non-native population of wallabies in the upper regions of Kalihi Valley on the island of Oahu arising from an escape of zoo specimens of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby (&quot;Petrogale penicillata&quot;) in 1916.
* In the Peak District of England, a population was established around 1940 by five escapees from a local zoo, and as of September 2017, sightings were still being made in the area. At its peak in 1975, the population numbered around 60 individuals.
* The island of Inchconnachan in Loch Lomond, Scotland, has a population of around 28 red-necked wallabies introduced by Lady Colquhoun in the 1920s. Eradication to protect the native capercaillie has been proposed.
* There is also a small population on Lambay Island off the eastern coast of Ireland. Initially introduced in the 1950s and 1960s, more were introduced in the 1980s after a sudden population explosion at the Dublin Zoo.
* Populations in the United Kingdom that, for some periods, bred successfully included one near Teignmouth, Devon, another in the Ashdown Forest, East Sussex, Cornwall and one on the islands of Bute and Lundy. It has recently been reported by walkers in the Lickey Hills Country Park area of Birmingham that a pair of wallabies have been released or are loose there (East Tunnock Rambling Club Meeting, December 2010).
* In France, in the southern part of the Forest of Rambouillet, about west of Paris, there is a wild group of around 30 Bennett&#x27;s wallabies. This population has been present since the 1970s, when some individuals escaped from the zoological park of Émancé after a storm.

<text>Harold Pinter (; 10 October 1930 – 24 December 2008) was a British playwright, screenwriter, director and actor. A Nobel Prize winner, Pinter was one of the most influential modern British dramatists with a writing career that spanned more than 50 years. His best-known plays include &quot;The Birthday Party&quot; (1957), &quot;The Homecoming&quot; (1964) and &quot;Betrayal&quot; (1978), each of which he adapted for the screen. His screenplay adaptations of others&#x27; works include &quot;The Servant&quot; (1963), &quot;The Go-Between&quot; (1971), &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1981), &quot;The Trial&quot; (1993) and &quot;Sleuth&quot; (2007). He also directed or acted in radio, stage, television and film productions of his own and others&#x27; works.

Pinter was born and raised in Hackney, east London, and educated at Hackney Downs School. He was a sprinter and a keen cricket player, acting in school plays and writing poetry. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art but did not complete the course. He was fined for refusing national service as a conscientious objector. Subsequently, he continued training at the Central School of Speech and Drama and worked in repertory theatre in Ireland and England. In 1956 he married actress Vivien Merchant and had a son, Daniel, born in 1958. He left Merchant in 1975 and married author Lady Antonia Fraser in 1980.

Pinter&#x27;s career as a playwright began with a production of &quot;The Room&quot; in 1957. His second play, &quot;The Birthday Party&quot;, closed after eight performances but was enthusiastically reviewed by critic Harold Hobson. His early works were described by critics as &quot;comedy of menace&quot;. Later plays such as &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (1975) and &quot;Betrayal&quot; (1978) became known as &quot;memory plays&quot;. He appeared as an actor in productions of his own work on radio and film, and directed nearly 50 productions for stage, theatre and screen. Pinter received over 50 awards, prizes and other honours, including the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2005 and the French Légion d&#x27;honneur in 2007.

Despite frail health after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in December 2001, Pinter continued to act on stage and screen, last performing the title role of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s one-act monologue &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot;, for the 50th anniversary season of the Royal Court Theatre, in October 2006. He died from liver cancer on 24 December 2008.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Pinter was born on 10 October 1930, in Hackney, east London, the only child of British Jewish parents of Eastern European descent: his father, Hyman &quot;Jack&quot; Pinter (1902–1997) was a ladies&#x27; tailor; his mother, Frances (née Moskowitz; 1904–1992), a housewife. Pinter believed an aunt&#x27;s erroneous view that the family was Sephardic and had fled the Spanish Inquisition; thus, for his early poems, Pinter used the pseudonym &quot;Pinta&quot; and at other times used variations such as &quot;da Pinto&quot;. Later research by Lady Antonia Fraser, Pinter&#x27;s second wife, revealed the legend to be apocryphal; three of Pinter&#x27;s grandparents came from Poland and the fourth from Odesa, so the family was Ashkenazic.

Pinter&#x27;s family home in London is described by his official biographer Michael Billington as &quot;a solid, red-brick, three-storey villa just off the noisy, bustling, traffic-ridden thoroughfare of the Lower Clapton Road&quot;. In 1940 and 1941, after the Blitz, Pinter was evacuated from their house in London to Cornwall and Reading. Billington states that the &quot;life-and-death intensity of daily experience&quot; before and during the Blitz left Pinter with profound memories &quot;of loneliness, bewilderment, separation and loss: themes that are in all his works.&quot;

Pinter discovered his social potential as a student at Hackney Downs School, a London grammar school, between 1944 and 1948. &quot;Partly through the school and partly through the social life of Hackney Boys&#x27; Club ... he formed an almost belief in the power of male friendship. The friends he made in those days – most particularly Henry Woolf, Michael (Mick) Goldstein and Morris (Moishe) Wernick – have always been a vital part of the emotional texture of his life.&quot; A major influence on Pinter was his inspirational English teacher Joseph Brearley, who directed him in school plays and with whom he took long walks, talking about literature. According to Billington, under Brearley&#x27;s instruction, &quot;Pinter shone at English, wrote for the school magazine and discovered a gift for acting.&quot; In 1947 and 1948, he played Romeo and Macbeth in productions directed by Brearley.

At the age of 12, Pinter began writing poetry, and in spring 1947, his poetry was first published in the &quot;Hackney Downs School Magazine&quot;. In 1950 his poetry was first published outside the school magazine, in &quot;Poetry London&quot;, some of it under the pseudonym &quot;Harold Pinta&quot;.

Pinter was an atheist.

===Sport and friendship===
Pinter enjoyed running and broke the Hackney Downs School sprinting record.
He was a cricket enthusiast, taking his bat with him when evacuated during the Blitz. In 1971, he told Mel Gussow: &quot;one of my main obsessions in life is the game of cricket—I play and watch and read about it all the time.&quot; He was chairman of the Gaieties Cricket Club, a supporter of Yorkshire Cricket Club, and devoted a section of his official website to the sport. One wall of his study was dominated by a portrait of himself as a young man playing cricket, which was described by Sarah Lyall, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;The painted Mr. Pinter, poised to swing his bat, has a wicked glint in his eye; testosterone all but flies off the canvas.&quot; Pinter approved of the &quot;urban and exacting idea of cricket as a bold theatre of aggression.&quot; After his death, several of his school contemporaries recalled his achievements in sports, especially cricket and running. The BBC Radio 4 memorial tribute included an essay on Pinter and cricket.

Other interests that Pinter mentioned to interviewers are family, love and sex, drinking, writing, and reading. According to Billington, &quot;If the notion of male loyalty, competitive rivalry and fear of betrayal forms a constant thread in Pinter&#x27;s work from &quot;The Dwarfs&quot; onwards, its origins can be found in his teenage Hackney years. Pinter adores women, enjoys flirting with them, and worships their resilience and strength. But, in his early work especially, they are often seen as disruptive influences on some pure and Platonic ideal of male friendship: one of the most crucial of all Pinter&#x27;s lost Edens.&quot;

===Early theatrical training and stage experience===

Beginning in late 1948, Pinter attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art for two terms, but hating the school, missed most of his classes, feigned a nervous breakdown, and dropped out in 1949. In 1948 he was called up for National Service. He was initially refused registration as a conscientious objector, leading to his twice being prosecuted, and fined, for refusing to accept a medical examination, before his CO registration was ultimately agreed. He had a small part in the Christmas pantomime &quot;Dick Whittington and His Cat&quot; at the Chesterfield Hippodrome in 1949 to 1950. From January to July 1951, he attended the Central School of Speech and Drama.

From 1951 to 1952, he toured Ireland with the Anew McMaster repertory company, playing over a dozen roles. In 1952, he began acting in regional English repertory productions; from 1953 to 1954, he worked for the Donald Wolfit Company, at the King&#x27;s Theatre, Hammersmith, performing eight roles. From 1954 until 1959, Pinter acted under the stage name David Baron. In all, Pinter played over 20 roles under that name. To supplement his income from acting, Pinter worked as a waiter, a postman, a bouncer, and a snow-clearer, meanwhile, according to Mark Batty, &quot;harbouring ambitions as a poet and writer.&quot; In October 1989 Pinter recalled: &quot;I was in English rep as an actor for about 12 years. My favourite roles were undoubtedly the sinister ones. They&#x27;re something to get your teeth into.&quot; During that period, he also performed occasional roles in his own and others&#x27; works for radio, TV, and film, as he continued to do throughout his career.

===Marriages and family life===

From 1956 until 1980, Pinter was married to Vivien Merchant, an actress whom he met on tour, perhaps best known for her performance in the 1966 film &quot;Alfie&quot;. Their son Daniel was born in 1958. Through the early 1970s, Merchant appeared in many of Pinter&#x27;s works, including &quot;The Homecoming&quot; on stage (1965) and screen (1973), but the marriage was turbulent. For seven years, from 1962 to 1969, Pinter was engaged in a clandestine affair with BBC-TV presenter and journalist Joan Bakewell, which inspired his 1978 play &quot;Betrayal&quot;, and also throughout that period and beyond he had an affair with an American socialite, whom he nicknamed &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. This relationship was another secret he kept from both his wife and Bakewell. Initially, &quot;Betrayal&quot; was thought to be a response to his later affair with historian Antonia Fraser, the wife of Hugh Fraser, and Pinter&#x27;s &quot;marital crack-up&quot;.

Pinter and Merchant had both met Antonia Fraser in 1969, when all three worked together on a National Gallery programme about Mary, Queen of Scots; several years later, on 8–9 January 1975, Pinter and Fraser became romantically involved. That meeting initiated their five-year extramarital love affair. After hiding the relationship from Merchant for two and a half months, on 21 March 1975, Pinter finally told her &quot;I&#x27;ve met somebody&quot;. After that, &quot;Life in Hanover Terrace gradually became impossible&quot;, and Pinter moved out of their house on 28 April 1975, five days after the première of &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;.

In mid-August 1977, after Pinter and Fraser had spent two years living in borrowed and rented quarters, they moved into her former family home in Holland Park, where Pinter began writing &quot;Betrayal&quot;. He reworked it later, while on holiday at the Grand Hotel in Eastbourne, in early January 1978. After the Frasers&#x27; divorce had become final in 1977 and the Pinters&#x27; in 1980, Pinter married Fraser on 27 November 1980. Because of a two-week delay in Merchant&#x27;s signing the divorce papers, however, the reception had to precede the actual ceremony, originally scheduled to occur on his 50th birthday. Vivien Merchant died of acute alcoholism in the first week of October 1982, at the age of 53. Billington writes that Pinter &quot;did everything possible to support&quot; her and regretted that he ultimately became estranged from their son, Daniel, after their separation, Pinter&#x27;s remarriage, and Merchant&#x27;s death.

A reclusive gifted musician and writer, Daniel changed his surname from Pinter to Brand, the maiden name of his maternal grandmother, before Pinter and Fraser became romantically involved; while according to Fraser, his father could not understand it, she says that she could: &quot;Pinter is such a distinctive name that he must have got tired of being asked, &#x27;Any relation? Michael Billington wrote that Pinter saw Daniel&#x27;s name change as &quot;a largely pragmatic move on Daniel&#x27;s part designed to keep the press ... at bay.&quot; Fraser told Billington that Daniel &quot;was very nice to me at a time when it would have been only too easy for him to have turned on me ... simply because he had been the sole focus of his father&#x27;s love and now manifestly wasn&#x27;t.&quot; Still unreconciled at the time of his father&#x27;s death, Daniel Brand did not attend Pinter&#x27;s funeral.

Billington observes that &quot;The break-up with Vivien and the new life with Antonia was to have a profound effect on Pinter&#x27;s personality and his work,&quot; though he adds that Fraser herself did not claim to have influence over Pinter or his writing. In her own contemporaneous diary entry dated 15 January 1993, Fraser described herself more as Pinter&#x27;s literary midwife. Indeed, she told Billington that &quot;other people [such as Peggy Ashcroft, among others] had a shaping influence on [Pinter&#x27;s] politics&quot; and attributed changes in his writing and political views to a change from &quot;an unhappy, complicated personal life ... to a happy, uncomplicated personal life&quot;, so that &quot;a side of Harold which had always been there was somehow released. I think you can see that in his work after &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; [1975], which was a very bleak play.&quot;

Pinter was content in his second marriage and enjoyed family life with his six adult stepchildren and 17 step-grandchildren. Even after battling cancer for several years, he considered himself &quot;a very lucky man in every respect&quot;. Sarah Lyall notes in her 2007 interview with Pinter in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that his &quot;latest work, a slim pamphlet called &#x27;Six Poems for A.&#x27;, comprises poems written over 32 years, with &quot;A&quot; of course being Lady Antonia. The first of the poems was written in Paris, where she and Mr. Pinter traveled soon after they met. More than three decades later the two are rarely apart, and Mr. Pinter turns soft, even cozy, when he talks about his wife.&quot; In that interview Pinter &quot;acknowledged that his plays—full of infidelity, cruelty, inhumanity, the lot—seem at odds with his domestic contentment. &#x27;How can you write a happy play?&#x27; he said. &#x27;Drama is about conflict and degrees of perturbation, disarray. I&#x27;ve never been able to write a happy play, but I&#x27;ve been able to enjoy a happy life. After his death, Fraser told &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;He was a great man, and it was a privilege to live with him for over 33 years. He will never be forgotten.&quot;

== Civic activities and political activism ==

In 1948–49, when he was 18, Pinter opposed the politics of the Cold War, leading to his decision to become a conscientious objector and to refuse to comply with National Service in the British military. However, he told interviewers that, if he had been old enough at the time, he would have fought against the Nazis in World War II. He seemed to express ambivalence, both indifference and hostility, towards political structures and politicians in his Fall 1966 &quot;Paris Review&quot; interview conducted by Lawrence M. Bensky. Yet, he had been an early member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and also had supported the British Anti-Apartheid Movement (1959–1994), participating in British artists&#x27; refusal to permit professional productions of their work in South Africa in 1963 and in subsequent related campaigns. In &quot;A Play and Its Politics&quot;, a 1985 interview with Nicholas Hern, Pinter described his earlier plays retrospectively from the perspective of the politics of power and the dynamics of oppression.

In his last 25 years, Pinter increasingly focused his essays, interviews and public appearances directly on political issues. He was an officer in International PEN, travelling with American playwright Arthur Miller to Turkey in 1985 on a mission co-sponsored with a Helsinki Watch committee to investigate and protest against the torture of imprisoned writers. There he met victims of political oppression and their families. Pinter&#x27;s experiences in Turkey and his knowledge of the Turkish suppression of the Kurdish language inspired his 1988 play &quot;Mountain Language.&quot; He was also an active member of the Cuba Solidarity Campaign, an organisation that &quot;campaigns in the UK against the US blockade of Cuba&quot;. In 2001, Pinter joined the International Committee to Defend Slobodan Milošević (ICDSM), which appealed for a fair trial and for the freedom of Slobodan Milošević, signing a related &quot;Artists&#x27; Appeal for Milošević&quot; in 2004.

Pinter strongly opposed the 1991 Gulf War, the 1999 NATO bombing campaign in FR Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War, the United States&#x27; 2001 War in Afghanistan, and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Among his provocative political statements, Pinter called Prime Minister Tony Blair a &quot;deluded idiot&quot; and compared the administration of President George W. Bush to Nazi Germany. He stated that the United States &quot;was charging towards world domination while the American public and Britain&#x27;s &#x27;mass-murdering&#x27; prime minister sat back and watched.&quot; He was very active in the antiwar movement in the United Kingdom, speaking at rallies held by the Stop the War Coalition and frequently criticising American aggression, as when he asked rhetorically, in his acceptance speech for the Wilfred Owen Award for Poetry on 18 March 2007: &quot;What would Wilfred Owen make of the invasion of Iraq? A bandit act, an act of blatant state terrorism, demonstrating absolute contempt for the conception of international law.&quot;

Pinter earned a reputation for being pugnacious, enigmatic, taciturn, terse, prickly, explosive and forbidding. Pinter&#x27;s blunt political statements, and the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature, elicited strong criticism and even, at times, provoked ridicule and personal attacks. The historian Geoffrey Alderman, author of the official history of Hackney Downs School, expressed his own &quot;Jewish View&quot; of Harold Pinter: &quot;Whatever his merit as a writer, actor and director, on an ethical plane Harold Pinter seems to me to have been intensely flawed, and his moral compass deeply fractured.&quot; David Edgar, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, defended Pinter against what he termed Pinter&#x27;s &quot;being berated by the belligerati&quot; like Johann Hari, who felt that he did not &quot;deserve&quot; to win the Nobel Prize. Later Pinter continued to campaign against the Iraq War and on behalf of other political causes that he supported.

Pinter signed the mission statement of Jews for Justice for Palestinians in 2005 and its full-page advertisement, &quot;What Is Israel Doing? A Call by Jews in Britain&quot;, published in &quot;The Times&quot; on 6 July 2006, and he was a patron of the Palestine Festival of Literature. In April 2008, Pinter signed the statement &quot;We&#x27;re not celebrating Israel&#x27;s anniversary&quot;. The statement noted: &quot;We cannot celebrate the birthday of a state founded on terrorism, massacres and the dispossession of another people from their land.&quot;, &quot;We will celebrate when Arab and Jew live as equals in a peaceful Middle East&quot;

==Career==

===As actor===
Pinter&#x27;s acting career spanned over 50 years and, although he often played villains, included a wide range of roles on stage and in radio, film, and television. In addition to roles in radio and television adaptations of his own plays and dramatic sketches, early in his screenwriting career he made several cameo appearances in films based on his own screenplays; for example, as a society man in &quot;The Servant&quot; (1963) and as Mr. Bell in &quot;Accident&quot; (1967), both directed by Joseph Losey; and as a bookshop customer in his later film &quot;Turtle Diary&quot; (1985), starring Michael Gambon, Glenda Jackson, and Ben Kingsley.

Pinter&#x27;s notable film and television roles included the lawyer Saul Abrahams opposite Peter O&#x27;Toole in &quot;Rogue Male&quot;, BBC TV&#x27;s 1976 adaptation of Geoffrey Household&#x27;s 1939 novel, and a drunk Irish journalist in &quot;Langrishe, Go Down&quot; (starring Judi Dench and Jeremy Irons) distributed on BBC Two in 1978 and released in movie theatres in 2002. Pinter&#x27;s later film roles included the criminal Sam Ross in &quot;Mojo&quot; (1997), written and directed by Jez Butterworth, based on Butterworth&#x27;s play of the same name; Sir Thomas Bertram (his most substantial feature-film role) in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; (1998), a character that Pinter described as &quot;a very civilised man ... a man of great sensibility but in fact, he&#x27;s upholding and sustaining a totally brutal system [the slave trade] from which he derives his money&quot;; and Uncle Benny, opposite Pierce Brosnan and Geoffrey Rush, in &quot;The Tailor of Panama&quot; (2001). In television films, he played Mr. Bearing, the father of ovarian cancer patient Vivian Bearing, played by Emma Thompson in Mike Nichols&#x27;s HBO film of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;Wit&quot; (2001); and the Director opposite John Gielgud (Gielgud&#x27;s last role) and Rebecca Pidgeon in &quot;Catastrophe&quot;, by Samuel Beckett, directed by David Mamet as part of &quot;Beckett on Film&quot; (2001).

===As director===
Pinter began to direct more frequently during the 1970s, becoming an associate director of the National Theatre (NT) in 1973. He directed almost 50 productions of his own and others&#x27; plays for stage, film, and television, including 10 productions of works by Simon Gray: the stage and/or film premières of &quot;Butley&quot; (stage, 1971; film, 1974), &quot;Otherwise Engaged&quot; (1975), &quot;The Rear Column&quot; (stage, 1978; TV, 1980), &quot;Close of Play&quot; (NT, 1979), &quot;Quartermaine&#x27;s Terms&quot; (1981), &quot;Life Support&quot; (1997), &quot;The Late Middle Classes&quot; (1999), and &quot;The Old Masters&quot; (2004). Several of those productions starred Alan Bates (1934–2003), who originated the stage and screen roles of not only Butley but also Mick in Pinter&#x27;s first major commercial success, &quot;The Caretaker&quot; (stage, 1960; film, 1964); and in Pinter&#x27;s double-bill produced at the Lyric Hammersmith in 1984, he played Nicolas in &quot;One for the Road&quot; and the cab driver in &quot;Victoria Station&quot;. Among over 35 plays that Pinter directed were &quot;Next of Kin&quot; (1974), by John Hopkins; &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; (1976), by Noël Coward; &quot;The Innocents&quot; (1976), by William Archibald; &quot;Circe and Bravo&quot; (1986), by Donald Freed; &quot;Taking Sides&quot; (1995), by Ronald Harwood; and &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot; (1996), by Reginald Rose.

===As playwright===
Pinter was the author of 29 plays and 15 dramatic sketches and the co-author of two works for stage and radio. He was considered to have been one of the most influential modern British dramatists, Along with the 1967 Tony Award for Best Play for &quot;The Homecoming&quot; and several other American awards and award nominations, he and his plays received many awards in the UK and elsewhere throughout the world. His style has entered the English language as an adjective, &quot;Pinteresque&quot;, although Pinter himself disliked the term and found it meaningless.

====&quot;Comedies of menace&quot; (1957–1968)====

Pinter&#x27;s first play, &quot;The Room&quot;, written and first performed in 1957, was a student production at the University of Bristol, directed by his good friend, actor Henry Woolf, who also originated the role of Mr. Kidd (which he reprised in 2001 and 2007). After Pinter mentioned that he had an idea for a play, Woolf asked him to write it so that he could direct it to fulfill a requirement for his postgraduate work. Pinter wrote it in three days. The production was described by Billington as &quot;a staggeringly confident debut which attracted the attention of a young producer, Michael Codron, who decided to present Pinter&#x27;s next play, &quot;The Birthday Party&quot;, at the Lyric Hammersmith, in 1958.&quot;

Written in 1957 and produced in 1958, Pinter&#x27;s second play, &quot;The Birthday Party&quot;, one of his best-known works, was initially both a commercial and critical disaster, despite an enthusiastic review in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; by its influential drama critic Harold Hobson, which appeared only after the production had closed and could not be reprieved. Critical accounts often quote Hobson:

Pinter himself and later critics generally credited Hobson as bolstering him and perhaps even rescuing his career.

In a review published in 1958, borrowing from the subtitle of &quot;The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace&quot;, a play by David Campton, critic Irving Wardle called Pinter&#x27;s early plays &quot;comedy of menace&quot;—a label that people have applied repeatedly to his work. Such plays begin with an apparently innocent situation that becomes both threatening and &quot;absurd&quot; as Pinter&#x27;s characters behave in ways often perceived as inexplicable by his audiences and one another. Pinter acknowledges the influence of Samuel Beckett, particularly on his early work; they became friends, sending each other drafts of their works in progress for comments.

Pinter wrote &quot;The Hothouse&quot; in 1958, which he shelved for over 20 years (See &quot;Overtly political plays and sketches&quot; below). Next he wrote &quot;The Dumb Waiter&quot; (1959), which premièred in Germany and was then produced in a double bill with &quot;The Room&quot; at the Hampstead Theatre Club, in London, in 1960. It was then not produced often until the 1980s, and it has been revived more frequently since 2000, including the West End Trafalgar Studios production in 2007. The first production of &quot;The Caretaker&quot;, at the Arts Theatre Club, in London, in 1960, established Pinter&#x27;s theatrical reputation. The play transferred to the Duchess Theatre in May 1960 and ran for 444 performances, receiving an Evening Standard Award for best play of 1960. Large radio and television audiences for his one-act play &quot;A Night Out&quot;, along with the popularity of his revue sketches, propelled him to further critical attention. In 1964, &quot;The Birthday Party&quot; was revived both on television (with Pinter himself in the role of Goldberg) and on stage (directed by Pinter at the Aldwych Theatre) and was well received.

By the time Peter Hall&#x27;s London production of &quot;The Homecoming&quot; (1964) reached Broadway in 1967, Pinter had become a celebrity playwright, and the play garnered four Tony Awards, among other awards. During this period, Pinter also wrote the radio play &quot;A Slight Ache&quot;, first broadcast on the BBC Third Programme in 1959 and then adapted to the stage and performed at the Arts Theatre Club in 1961. &quot;A Night Out&quot; (1960) was broadcast to a large audience on ABC Weekend TV&#x27;s television show &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;, after being transmitted on BBC Radio 3, also in 1960. His play &quot;Night School&quot; was first televised in 1960 on Associated Rediffusion. &quot;The Collection&quot; premièred at the Aldwych Theatre in 1962, and &quot;The Dwarfs&quot;, adapted from Pinter&#x27;s then unpublished novel of the same title, was first broadcast on radio in 1960, then adapted for the stage (also at the Arts Theatre Club) in a double bill with &quot;The Lover&quot;, which had previously been televised by Associated Rediffusion in 1963; and &quot;Tea Party&quot;, a play that Pinter developed from his 1963 short story, first broadcast on BBC TV in 1965.

Working as both a screenwriter and as a playwright, Pinter composed a script called &quot;The Compartment&quot; (1966), for a trilogy of films to be contributed by Samuel Beckett, Eugène Ionesco, and Pinter, of which only Beckett&#x27;s film, titled &quot;Film&quot;, was actually produced. Then Pinter turned his unfilmed script into a television play, which was produced as &quot;The Basement&quot;, both on BBC 2 and also on stage in 1968.

====&quot;Memory plays&quot; (1968–1982)====

From the late 1960s through the early 1980s, Pinter wrote a series of plays and sketches that explore complex ambiguities, elegiac mysteries, comic vagaries, and other &quot;quicksand-like&quot; characteristics of memory and which critics sometimes classify as Pinter&#x27;s &quot;memory plays&quot;. These include &quot;Landscape&quot; (1968), &quot;Silence&quot; (1969), &quot;Night&quot; (1969), &quot;Old Times&quot; (1971), &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (1975), &quot;The Proust Screenplay&quot; (1977), &quot;Betrayal&quot; (1978), &quot;Family Voices&quot; (1981), &quot;Victoria Station&quot; (1982), and &quot;A Kind of Alaska&quot; (1982). Some of Pinter&#x27;s later plays, including &quot;Party Time&quot; (1991), &quot;Moonlight&quot; (1993), &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; (1996), and &quot;Celebration&quot; (2000), draw upon some features of his &quot;memory&quot; dramaturgy in their focus on the past in the present, but they have personal and political resonances and other tonal differences from these earlier memory plays.

====Overtly political plays and sketches (1980–2000)====
Following a three-year period of creative drought in the early 1980s after his marriage to Antonia Fraser and the death of Vivien Merchant, Pinter&#x27;s plays tended to become shorter and more overtly political, serving as critiques of oppression, torture, and other abuses of human rights, linked by the apparent &quot;invulnerability of power.&quot; Just before this hiatus, in 1979, Pinter re-discovered his manuscript of &quot;The Hothouse&quot;, which he had written in 1958 but had set aside; he revised it and then directed its first production himself at Hampstead Theatre in London, in 1980. Like his plays of the 1980s, &quot;The Hothouse&quot; concerns authoritarianism and the abuses of power politics, but it is also a comedy, like his earlier comedies of menace. Pinter played the major role of Roote in a 1995 revival at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester.

Pinter&#x27;s brief dramatic sketch &quot;Precisely&quot; (1983) is a duologue between two bureaucrats exploring the absurd power politics of mutual nuclear annihilation and deterrence. His first overtly political one-act play is &quot;One for the Road&quot; (1984). In 1985 Pinter stated that whereas his earlier plays presented metaphors for power and powerlessness, the later ones present literal realities of power and its abuse. Pinter&#x27;s &quot;political theatre dramatizes the interplay and conflict of the opposing poles of involvement and disengagement.&quot; &quot;Mountain Language&quot; (1988) is about the Turkish suppression of the Kurdish language. The dramatic sketch &quot;The New World Order&quot; (1991) provides what Robert Cushman, writing in &quot;The Independent&quot; described as &quot;10 nerve-wracking minutes&quot; of two men threatening to torture a third man who is blindfolded, gagged and bound in a chair; Pinter directed the British première at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs, where it opened on 9 July 1991, and the production then transferred to Washington, D.C., where it was revived in 1994. Pinter&#x27;s longer political satire &quot;Party Time&quot; (1991) premièred at the Almeida Theatre in London, in a double-bill with &quot;Mountain Language&quot;. Pinter adapted it as a screenplay for television in 1992, directing that production, first broadcast in the UK on Channel 4 on 17 November 1992.

Intertwining political and personal concerns, his next full-length plays, &quot;Moonlight&quot; (1993) and &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; (1996) are set in domestic households and focus on dying and death; in their personal conversations in &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, Devlin and Rebecca allude to unspecified atrocities relating to the Holocaust. After experiencing the deaths of first his mother (1992) and then his father (1997), again merging the personal and the political, Pinter wrote the poems &quot;Death&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Disappeared&quot; (1998).

Pinter&#x27;s last stage play, &quot;Celebration&quot; (2000), is a social satire set in an opulent restaurant, which lampoons The Ivy, a fashionable venue in London&#x27;s West End theatre district, and its patrons who &quot;have just come from performances of either the ballet or the opera. Not that they can remember a darn thing about what they saw, including the titles. [These] gilded, foul-mouthed souls are just as myopic when it comes to their own table mates (and for that matter, their food), with conversations that usually connect only on the surface, if there.&quot; On its surface the play may appear to have fewer overtly political resonances than some of the plays from the 1980s and 1990s; but its central male characters, brothers named Lambert and Matt, are members of the elite (like the men in charge in &quot;Party Time&quot;), who describe themselves as &quot;peaceful strategy consultants [because] we don&#x27;t carry guns.&quot; At the next table, Russell, a banker, describes himself as a &quot;totally disordered personality ... a psychopath&quot;, while Lambert &quot;vows to be reincarnated as &#x27;[a] more civilised, [a] gentler person, [a] nicer person&#x27;.&quot; These characters&#x27; deceptively smooth exteriors mask their extreme viciousness. &quot;Celebration&quot; evokes familiar Pinteresque political contexts: &quot;The ritzy loudmouths in &#x27;Celebration&#x27; ... and the quieter working-class mumblers of &#x27;The Room&#x27; ... have everything in common beneath the surface&quot;. &quot;Money remains in the service of entrenched power, and the brothers in the play are &#x27;strategy consultants&#x27; whose jobs involve force and violence ... It is tempting but inaccurate to equate the comic power inversions of the social behaviour in &quot;Celebration&quot; with lasting change in larger political structures&quot;, according to Grimes, for whom the play indicates Pinter&#x27;s pessimism about the possibility of changing the status quo. Yet, as the Waiter&#x27;s often comically unbelievable reminiscences about his grandfather demonstrate in &quot;Celebration&quot;, Pinter&#x27;s final stage plays also extend some expressionistic aspects of his earlier &quot;memory plays&quot;, while harking back to his &quot;comedies of menace&quot;, as illustrated in the characters and in the Waiter&#x27;s final speech:
During 2000–2001, there were also simultaneous productions of &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;, Pinter&#x27;s stage adaptation of his unpublished &quot;Proust Screenplay&quot;, written in collaboration with and directed by Di Trevis, at the Royal National Theatre, and a revival of &quot;The Caretaker&quot; directed by Patrick Marber and starring Michael Gambon, Rupert Graves, and Douglas Hodge, at the Comedy Theatre.

Like &quot;Celebration&quot;, Pinter&#x27;s penultimate sketch, &quot;Press Conference&quot; (2002), &quot;invokes both torture and the fragile, circumscribed existence of dissent&quot;. In its première in the National Theatre&#x27;s two-part production of &quot;Sketches&quot;, despite undergoing chemotherapy at the time, Pinter played the ruthless Minister willing to murder little children for the benefit of &quot;The State&quot;.

===As screenwriter===
Pinter composed 27 screenplays and film scripts for cinema and television, many of which were filmed, or adapted as stage plays. His fame as a screenwriter began with his three screenplays written for films directed by Joseph Losey, leading to their close friendship: &quot;The Servant&quot; (1963), based on the novel by Robin Maugham; &quot;Accident&quot; (1967), adapted from the novel by Nicholas Mosley; and &quot;The Go-Between&quot; (1971), based on the novel by L. P. Hartley. Films based on Pinter&#x27;s adaptations of his own stage plays are: &quot;The Caretaker&quot; (1963), directed by Clive Donner; &quot;The Birthday Party&quot; (1968), directed by William Friedkin; &quot;The Homecoming&quot; (1973), directed by Peter Hall; and &quot;Betrayal&quot; (1983), directed by David Jones.

Pinter also adapted other writers&#x27; novels to screenplays, including &quot;The Pumpkin Eater&quot; (1964), based on the novel by Penelope Mortimer, directed by Jack Clayton; &quot;The Quiller Memorandum&quot; (1966), from the 1965 spy novel &quot;The Berlin Memorandum&quot;, by Elleston Trevor, directed by Michael Anderson; &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot; (1976), from the unfinished novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, directed by Elia Kazan; &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1981), from the novel by John Fowles, directed by Karel Reisz; &quot;Turtle Diary&quot; (1985), based on the novel by Russell Hoban; &quot;The Heat of the Day&quot; (1988), a television film, from the 1949 novel by Elizabeth Bowen; &quot;The Comfort of Strangers&quot; (1990), from the novel by Ian McEwan, directed by Paul Schrader; and &quot;The Trial&quot; (1993), from the novel by Franz Kafka, directed by David Jones.

His commissioned screenplays of others&#x27; works for the films &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1990), &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; (1990), and &quot;Lolita&quot; (1997), remain unpublished and in the case of the latter two films, uncredited, though several scenes from or aspects of his scripts were used in these finished films. His screenplays &quot;The Proust Screenplay&quot; (1972), &quot;Victory&quot; (1982), and &quot;The Dreaming Child&quot; (1997) and his unpublished screenplay &quot;The Tragedy of King Lear&quot; (2000) have not been filmed. A section of Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Proust Screenplay&quot; was, however, released as the 1984 film &quot;Swann in Love&quot; (&quot;Un amour de Swann&quot;), directed by Volker Schlöndorff, and it was also adapted by Michael Bakewell as a two-hour radio drama broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in 1995, before Pinter and director Di Trevis collaborated to adapt it for the 2000 National Theatre production.

Pinter&#x27;s last filmed screenplay was an adaptation of the 1970 Tony Award-winning play &quot;Sleuth&quot;, by Anthony Shaffer, which was commissioned by Jude Law, one of the film&#x27;s producers. It is the basis for the 2007 film &quot;Sleuth&quot;, directed by Kenneth Branagh. Pinter&#x27;s screenplays for &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; and &quot;Betrayal&quot; were nominated for Academy Awards in 1981 and 1983, respectively.

===2001–2008===

From 16 to 31 July 2001, a Harold Pinter Festival celebrating his work, curated by Michael Colgan, artistic director of the Gate Theatre, Dublin, was held as part of the annual Lincoln Center Festival at Lincoln Center in New York City. Pinter participated both as an actor, as Nicolas in &quot;One for the Road&quot;, and as a director of a double bill pairing his last play, &quot;Celebration&quot;, with his first play, &quot;The Room&quot;. As part of a two-week &quot;Harold Pinter Homage&quot; at the World Leaders Festival of Creative Genius, held from 24 September to 30 October 2001, at the Harbourfront Centre, in Toronto, Canada, Pinter presented a dramatic reading of &quot;Celebration&quot; (2000) and also participated in a public interview as part of the International Festival of Authors.

In December 2001, Pinter was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer, for which, in 2002, he underwent an operation and chemotherapy. During the course of his treatment, he directed a production of his play &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, and wrote and performed in a new sketch, &quot;Press Conference&quot;, for a production of his dramatic sketches at the National Theatre, and from 2002 on he was increasingly active in political causes, writing and presenting politically charged poetry, essays, speeches, as well as involved in developing his final two screenplay adaptations, &quot;The Tragedy of King Lear&quot; and &quot;Sleuth&quot;, whose drafts are in the British Library&#x27;s Harold Pinter Archive (Add MS 88880/2).

From 9 to 25 January 2003, the Manitoba Theatre Centre, in Manitoba, Canada, held a nearly month-long &quot;PinterFest&quot;, in which over 130 performances of twelve of Pinter&#x27;s plays were performed by a dozen different theatre companies. Productions during the Festival included: &quot;The Hothouse&quot;, &quot;Night School&quot;, &quot;The Lover&quot;, &quot;The Dumb Waiter&quot;, &quot;The Homecoming&quot;, &quot;The Birthday Party&quot;, &quot;Monologue&quot;, &quot;One for the Road&quot;, &quot;The Caretaker&quot;, &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, &quot;Celebration&quot;, and &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;.

In 2005, Pinter stated that he had stopped writing plays and that he would be devoting his efforts more to his political activism and writing poetry: &quot;I think I&#x27;ve written 29 plays. I think it&#x27;s enough for me ... My energies are going in different directions—over the last few years I&#x27;ve made a number of political speeches at various locations and ceremonies ... I&#x27;m using a lot of energy more specifically about political states of affairs, which I think are very, very worrying as things stand.&quot; Some of this later poetry included &quot;The &#x27;Special Relationship&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Laughter&quot;, and &quot;The Watcher&quot;.

From 2005, Pinter experienced ill health, including a rare skin disease called pemphigus and &quot;a form of septicaemia that afflict[ed] his feet and made it difficult for him to walk.&quot; Yet, he completed his screenplay for the film of &quot;Sleuth&quot; in 2005. His last dramatic work for radio, &quot;Voices&quot; (2005), a collaboration with composer James Clarke, adapting selected works by Pinter to music, premièred on BBC Radio 3 on his 75th birthday on 10 October 2005. Three days later, it was announced that he had won the 2005 Nobel Prize in Literature.

In an interview with Pinter in 2006, conducted by critic Michael Billington as part of the cultural programme of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, Pinter confirmed that he would continue to write poetry but not plays. In response, the audience shouted &quot;No&quot; in unison, urging him to keep writing. Along with the international symposium on Pinter: Passion, Poetry, Politics, curated by Billington, the 2006 Europe Theatre Prize theatrical events celebrating Pinter included new productions (in French) of &quot;Precisely&quot; (1983), &quot;One for the Road&quot; (1984), &quot;Mountain Language&quot; (1988), &quot;The New World Order&quot; (1991), &quot;Party Time&quot; (1991), and &quot;Press Conference&quot; (2002) (French versions by Jean Pavans); and &quot;Pinter Plays, Poetry &amp; Prose&quot;, an evening of dramatic readings, directed by Alan Stanford, of the Gate Theatre, Dublin. In June 2006, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) hosted a celebration of Pinter&#x27;s films curated by his friend, the playwright David Hare. Hare introduced the selection of film clips by saying: &quot;To jump back into the world of Pinter&#x27;s movies ... is to remind yourself of a literate mainstream cinema, focused as much as Bergman&#x27;s is on the human face, in which tension is maintained by a carefully crafted mix of image and dialogue.&quot;

After returning to London from the Edinburgh International Book Festival, in September 2006, Pinter began rehearsing for his performance of the role of Krapp in Samuel Beckett&#x27;s one-act monologue &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot;, which he performed from a motorised wheelchair in a limited run the following month at the Royal Court Theatre to sold-out audiences and &quot;ecstatic&quot; critical reviews. The production ran for only nine performances, as part of the 50th-anniversary celebration season of the Royal Court Theatre; it sold out within minutes of the opening of the box office and tickets commanded large sums from ticket resellers. One performance was filmed and broadcast on BBC Four on 21 June 2007, and also screened later, as part of the memorial PEN Tribute to Pinter, in New York, on 2 May 2009.

In October and November 2006, Sheffield Theatres hosted Pinter: A Celebration. It featured productions of seven of Pinter&#x27;s plays: &quot;The Caretaker&quot;, &quot;Voices&quot;, &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, &quot;Family Voices&quot;, &quot;Tea Party&quot;, &quot;The Room&quot;, &quot;One for the Road&quot;, and &quot;The Dumb Waiter&quot;; and films (most his screenplays; some in which Pinter appears as an actor).

In February and March 2007, a 50th anniversary of &quot;The Dumb Waiter&quot;, was produced at the Trafalgar Studios. Later in February 2007, John Crowley&#x27;s film version of Pinter&#x27;s play &quot;Celebration&quot; (2000) was shown on &quot;More4&quot; (Channel 4, UK). On 18 March 2007, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a new radio production of &quot;The Homecoming&quot;, directed by Thea Sharrock and produced by Martin J. Smith, with Pinter performing the role of Max (for the first time; he had previously played Lenny on stage in 1964). A revival of &quot;The Hothouse&quot; opened at the National Theatre, in London, in July 2007, concurrently with a revival of &quot;Betrayal&quot; at the Donmar Warehouse, directed by Roger Michell.
Revivals in 2008 included the 40th-anniversary production of the American première of &quot;The Homecoming&quot; on Broadway, directed by Daniel J. Sullivan. From 8 to 24 May 2008, the Lyric Hammersmith celebrated the 50th anniversary of &quot;The Birthday Party&quot; with a revival and related events, including a gala performance and reception hosted by Harold Pinter on 19 May 2008, exactly 50 years after its London première there. The final revival during Pinter&#x27;s lifetime was a production of &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, directed by Rupert Goold, opening at the Gate Theatre, Dublin, in August 2008, and then transferring to the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre, London, where it played until 3 January 2009. On the Monday before Christmas 2008, Pinter was admitted to Hammersmith Hospital, where he died on Christmas Eve from liver cancer, aged 78.

On 26 December 2008, when &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; reopened at the Duke of York&#x27;s, the actors paid tribute to Pinter from the stage, with Michael Gambon reading Hirst&#x27;s monologue about his &quot;photograph album&quot; from Act Two that Pinter had asked him to read at his funeral, ending with a standing ovation from the audience, many of whom were in tears:
==Posthumous events==
===Funeral===

Pinter&#x27;s funeral was a private, half-hour secular ceremony conducted at the graveside at Kensal Green Cemetery, 31 December 2008. The eight readings selected in advance by Pinter included passages from seven of his own writings and from the story &quot;The Dead&quot;, by James Joyce, which was read by actress Penelope Wilton. Michael Gambon read the &quot;photo album&quot; speech from &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; and three other readings, including Pinter&#x27;s poem &quot;Death&quot; (1997). Other readings honoured Pinter&#x27;s widow and his love of cricket. The ceremony was attended by many notable theatre people, including Tom Stoppard, but not by Pinter&#x27;s son, Daniel Brand. At its end, Pinter&#x27;s widow, Antonia Fraser, stepped forward to his grave and quoted from Horatio&#x27;s speech after the death of Hamlet: &quot;Goodnight, sweet prince, / And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.&quot;

===Memorial tributes===
The night before Pinter&#x27;s burial, theatre marquees on Broadway dimmed their lights for a minute in tribute, and on the final night of &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre on 3 January 2009, all of the Ambassador Theatre Group in the West End dimmed their lights for an hour to honour the playwright. 

Diane Abbott, the Member of Parliament for Hackney North &amp; Stoke Newington proposed an early day motion in the House of Commons to support a residents&#x27; campaign to restore the Clapton Cinematograph Theatre, established in Lower Clapton Road in 1910, and to turn it into a memorial to Pinter &quot;to honour this Hackney boy turned literary great.&quot; On 2 May 2009, a free public memorial tribute was held at The Graduate Center of The City University of New York. It was part of the 5th Annual PEN World Voices Festival of International Literature, taking place in New York City. Another memorial celebration, held in the Olivier Theatre, at the Royal National Theatre, in London, on the evening of 7 June 2009, consisted of excerpts and readings from Pinter&#x27;s writings by nearly three dozen actors, many of whom were his friends and associates, including: Eileen Atkins, David Bradley, Colin Firth, Henry Goodman, Sheila Hancock, Alan Rickman, Penelope Wilton, Susan Wooldridge, and Henry Woolf; and a troupe of students from the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, directed by Ian Rickson.

On 16 June 2009, Antonia Fraser officially opened a commemorative room at the Hackney Empire. The theatre also established a writer&#x27;s residency in Pinter&#x27;s name. Most of issue number 28 of Craig Raine&#x27;s Arts Tri-Quarterly &quot;Areté&quot; was devoted to pieces remembering Pinter, beginning with Pinter&#x27;s 1987 unpublished love poem dedicated &quot;To Antonia&quot; and his poem &quot;Paris&quot;, written in 1975 (the year in which he and Fraser began living together), followed by brief memoirs by some of Pinter&#x27;s associates and friends, including Patrick Marber, Nina Raine, Tom Stoppard, Peter Nichols, Susanna Gross, Richard Eyre, and David Hare.

A memorial cricket match at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground between the Gaieties Cricket Club and the Lord&#x27;s Taverners, followed by performances of Pinter&#x27;s poems and excerpts from his plays, took place on 27 September 2009.

In 2009, English PEN established the PEN Pinter Prize, which is awarded annually to a British writer or a writer resident in Britain who, in the words of Pinter&#x27;s Nobel speech, casts an &#x27;unflinching, unswerving&#x27; gaze upon the world, and shows a &#x27;fierce intellectual determination ... to define the real truth of our lives and our societies&#x27;. The prize is shared with an international writer of courage. The inaugural winners of the prize were Tony Harrison and the Burmese poet and comedian Maung Thura (a.k.a. Zarganar).

===&quot;Being Harold Pinter&quot;===
In January 2011 &quot;Being Harold Pinter&quot;, a theatrical collage of excerpts from Pinter&#x27;s dramatic works, his Nobel Lecture, and letters of Belarusian prisoners, created and performed by the Belarus Free Theatre, evoked a great deal of attention in the public media. The Free Theatre&#x27;s members had to be smuggled out of Minsk, owing to a government crackdown on dissident artists, to perform their production in a two-week sold-out engagement at La MaMa in New York as part of the 2011 Under the Radar Festival. In an additional sold-out benefit performance at the Public Theater, co-hosted by playwrights Tony Kushner and Tom Stoppard, the prisoner&#x27;s letters were read by ten guest performers: Mandy Patinkin, Kevin Kline, Olympia Dukakis, Lily Rabe, Linda Emond, Josh Hamilton, Stephen Spinella, Lou Reed, Laurie Anderson, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. In solidarity with the Belarus Free Theatre, collaborations of actors and theatre companies joined in offering additional benefit readings of &quot;Being Harold Pinter&quot; across the United States.

===The Harold Pinter Theatre, London===
In September 2011, British Theatre owners, Ambassador Theatre Group (ATG) announced it was renaming its &quot;Comedy Theatre&quot;, Panton Street, London to become &quot;The Harold Pinter Theatre&quot;. Howard Panter, Joint CEO and Creative Director of ATG told the BBC, &quot;The work of Pinter has become an integral part of the history of the Comedy Theatre. The re-naming of one of our most successful West End theatres is a fitting tribute to a man who made such a mark on British theatre who, over his 50 year career, became recognised as one of the most influential modern British dramatists.&quot;

==Honours==

An Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and an Honorary Fellow of the Modern Language Association of America (1970), Pinter was appointed CBE in 1966 and became a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 2002, having declined a knighthood in 1996. In 1995, he accepted the David Cohen Prize, in recognition of a lifetime of literary achievement. In 1996, he received a Laurence Olivier Special Award for lifetime achievement in the theatre. In 1997 he became a BAFTA Fellow. He received the World Leaders Award for &quot;Creative Genius&quot; as the subject of a week-long &quot;Homage&quot; in Toronto, in October 2001. In 2004, he received the Wilfred Owen Award for Poetry for his &quot;lifelong contribution to literature, &#x27;and specifically for his collection of poetry entitled &quot;War&quot;, published in 2003&#x27;&quot;. In March 2006, he was awarded the Europe Theatre Prize in recognition of lifetime achievements pertaining to drama and theatre. In conjunction with that award, the critic Michael Billington coordinated an international conference on Pinter: Passion, Poetry, Politics, including scholars and critics from Europe and the Americas, held in Turin, Italy, from 10 to 14 March 2006.

In October 2008, the Central School of Speech and Drama announced that Pinter had agreed to become its president and awarded him an honorary fellowship at its graduation ceremony. On his appointment, Pinter commented: &quot;I was a student at Central in 1950–51. I enjoyed my time there very much and I am delighted to become president of a remarkable institution.&quot; But he had to receive that honorary degree, his 20th, in absentia owing to ill health. His presidency of the school was brief; he died just two weeks after the graduation ceremony, on 24 December 2008.

In 2013, he was posthumously awarded the Sretenje Order of Serbia.

===Nobel Prize in Literature===
===Légion d&#x27;honneur===
On 18 January 2007, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin presented Pinter with France&#x27;s highest civil honour, the Légion d&#x27;honneur, at a ceremony at the French embassy in London. De Villepin praised Pinter&#x27;s poem &quot;American Football&quot; (1991) stating: &quot;With its violence and its cruelty, it is for me one of the most accurate images of war, one of the most telling metaphors of the temptation of imperialism and violence.&quot; In response, Pinter praised France&#x27;s opposition to the war in Iraq. M. de Villepin concluded: &quot;The poet stands still and observes what doesn&#x27;t deserve other men&#x27;s attention. Poetry teaches us how to live and you, Harold Pinter, teach us how to live.&quot; He said that Pinter received the award particularly &quot;because in seeking to capture all the facets of the human spirit, [Pinter&#x27;s] works respond to the aspirations of the French public, and its taste for an understanding of man and of what is truly universal&quot;. Lawrence Pollard observed that &quot;the award for the great playwright underlines how much Mr Pinter is admired in countries like France as a model of the uncompromising radical intellectual&quot;.

==Scholarly response==

Some scholars and critics challenge the validity of Pinter&#x27;s critiques of what he terms &quot;the modes of thinking of those in power&quot; or dissent from his retrospective viewpoints on his own work. In 1985, Pinter recalled that his early act of conscientious objection resulted from being &quot;terribly disturbed as a young man by the Cold War. And McCarthyism ... A profound hypocrisy. &#x27;They&#x27; the monsters, &#x27;we&#x27; the good. In 1948, the Russian suppression of Eastern Europe was an obvious and brutal fact, but I felt very strongly then and feel as strongly now that we have an obligation to subject our own actions and attitudes to an equivalent critical and moral scrutiny.&quot; Scholars agree that Pinter&#x27;s dramatic rendering of power relations results from this scrutiny.

Pinter&#x27;s aversion to any censorship by &quot;the authorities&quot; is epitomised in Petey&#x27;s line at the end of &quot;The Birthday Party&quot;. As the broken-down and reconstituted Stanley is being carted off by the figures of authority Goldberg and McCann, Petey calls after him, &quot;Stan, don&#x27;t let them tell you what to do!&quot; Pinter told Gussow in 1988, &quot;I&#x27;ve lived that line all my damn life. Never more than now.&quot; The example of Pinter&#x27;s stalwart opposition to what he termed &quot;the modes of thinking of those in power&quot;—the &quot;brick wall&quot; of the &quot;minds&quot; perpetuating the &quot;status quo&quot;—infused the &quot;vast political pessimism&quot; that some academic critics may perceive in his artistic work, its &quot;drowning landscape&quot; of harsh contemporary realities, with some residual &quot;hope for restoring the dignity of man.&quot;

As Pinter&#x27;s long-time friend David Jones reminded analytically inclined scholars and dramatic critics, Pinter was one of the &quot;great comic writers&quot;: His dramatic conflicts present serious implications for his characters and his audiences, leading to sustained inquiry about &quot;the point&quot; of his work and multiple &quot;critical strategies&quot; for developing interpretations and stylistic analyses of it.

<text>In metaphysics, identity (from , &quot;sameness&quot;) is the relation each thing bears only to itself. The notion of identity gives rise to many philosophical problems, including the identity of indiscernibles (if &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; share all their properties, are they one and the same thing?), and questions about change and personal identity over time (what has to be the case for a person &quot;x&quot; at one time and a person &quot;y&quot; at a later time to be one and the same person?). It is important to distinguish between &quot;qualitative identity&quot; and &quot;numerical identity&quot;. For example, consider two children with identical bicycles engaged in a race while their mother is watching. The two children have the &quot;same&quot; bicycle in one sense (&quot;qualitative identity&quot;) and the &quot;same&quot; mother in another sense (&quot;numerical identity&quot;). This article is mainly concerned with &quot;numerical identity&quot;, which is the stricter notion.

The philosophical concept of identity is distinct from the better-known notion of identity in use in psychology and the social sciences. The philosophical concept concerns a &quot;relation&quot;, specifically, a relation that &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; stand in if, and only if they are one and the same thing, or &quot;identical to&quot; each other (i.e. if, and only if &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot;). The sociological notion of identity, by contrast, has to do with a person&#x27;s self-conception, social presentation, and more generally, the aspects of a person that make them unique, or qualitatively different from others (e.g. cultural identity, gender identity, national identity, online identity, and processes of identity formation). Lately, identity has been conceptualized considering humans’ position within the ecological web of life; this combination of sociocultural and ecological identification is known as ecocultural identity.

==Metaphysics of identity==

Metaphysicians and philosophers of language and mind ask other questions:
* What does it mean for an object to be the same as itself?
* If x and y are identical (are the same thing), must they always be identical? Are they &quot;necessarily&quot; identical?
* What does it mean for an object to be the same, if it changes over time? (Is apple&quot;t&quot; the same as apple&quot;t&quot;+1?)
* If an object&#x27;s parts are entirely replaced over time, as in the Ship of Theseus example, in what way is it the same?
The law of identity originates from classical antiquity. The modern formulation of identity is that of Gottfried Leibniz, who held that &quot;x&quot; is the same as &quot;y&quot; if and only if every predicate true of &quot;x&quot; is true of &quot;y&quot; as well.

Leibniz&#x27;s ideas have taken root in the philosophy of mathematics, where they have influenced the development of the predicate calculus as Leibniz&#x27;s law. Mathematicians sometimes distinguish identity from equality. More mundanely, an &quot;identity&quot; in mathematics may be an &quot;equation&quot; that holds true for all values of a variable. Hegel argued that things are inherently self-contradictory and that the notion of something being self-identical only made sense if it were not also not-identical or different from itself and did not also imply the latter. In Hegel&#x27;s words, &quot;Identity is the identity of identity and non-identity.&quot; More recent metaphysicians have discussed trans-world identity—the notion that there can be the same object in different possible worlds. An alternative to trans-world identity is the counterpart relation in counterpart theory. It is a similarity relation that rejects trans-world individuals and instead defends an object&#x27;s counterpartthe most similar object.

Some philosophers have denied that there is such a relation as identity. Thus Ludwig Wittgenstein writes (&quot;Tractatus&quot; 5.5301): &quot;That identity is not a relation between objects is obvious.&quot; At 5.5303 he elaborates: &quot;Roughly speaking: to say of two things that they are identical is nonsense, and to say of one thing that it is identical with itself is to say nothing.&quot; Bertrand Russell had earlier voiced a worry that seems to be motivating Wittgenstein&#x27;s point (&quot;The Principles of Mathematics&quot; §64): &quot;[I]dentity, an objector may urge, cannot be anything at all: two terms plainly are not identical, and one term cannot be, for what is it identical with?&quot; Even before Russell, Gottlob Frege, at the beginning of &quot;On Sense and Reference,&quot; expressed a worry with regard to identity as a relation: &quot;Equality gives rise to challenging questions which are not altogether easy to answer. Is it a relation?&quot; More recently, C. J. F. Williams has suggested that identity should be viewed as a second-order relation, rather than a relation between objects, and Kai Wehmeier has argued that appealing to a binary relation that every object bears to itself, and to no others, is both logically unnecessary and metaphysically suspect.

==Identity statements==
Kind-terms, or sortals give a criterion of identity and non-identity among items of their kind.

<text>Interstate 30 (I-30) is a major Interstate Highway in the southern states of Texas and Arkansas in the United States. I-30 travels 366.76 miles from I-20 west of Fort Worth, Texas, northeast via Dallas, and Texarkana, Texas, to I-40 in North Little Rock, Arkansas. The highway parallels U.S. Route 67 (US 67) except for the portion west of downtown Dallas (which was once part of I-20). Between the termini, I-30 has interchanges with I-35W, I-35E, and I-45. I-30 is known as the Tom Landry Freeway between I-35W and I-35E, within the core of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.

==Route description==
|TX || 
|AR || 
|Total || 

The largest metropolitan areas that I-30 travels through include the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, the Texarkana metropolitan area, and the Little Rock metropolitan area.

===Texas===
The western end and zero mile point of I-30 in Texas is at its intersection with I-20 in Parker County near Aledo. It then travels near downtown Fort Worth on a new routing further south than the now removed Lancaster Elevated section of the freeway. The section of I-30 between Dallas and Fort Worth is designated the Tom Landry Highway in honor of the longtime Dallas Cowboys coach. This section was previously known as the Dallas–Fort Worth Turnpike, which preceded the Interstate System. The section from downtown Dallas to Arlington was widened to over 16 lanes in some sections by 2010.

In Dallas, I-30 is known as East R.L. Thornton Freeway between downtown Dallas and the eastern suburb of Mesquite. I-30 picks up the name from I-35E south at the Mixmaster interchange. The Mixmaster is scheduled to be reconstructed as part of the Horseshoe project, derived from the larger Pegasus Project. The section from downtown Dallas to State Highway Loop 12 (Loop 12, Buckner Boulevard) is eight lanes plus an HOV lane. This section will be reconstructed under the East Corridor project to 12 lanes by 2025–2030. From Rockwall to a point past Sulphur Springs, I-30 runs concurrent with US 67. Through the city of Greenville, I-30 is known as Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway. I-30 continues northeasterly through East Texas until a few miles from the Oklahoma state line, when the route turns east toward Arkansas.

===Arkansas===
I-30 enters southwestern Arkansas at Texarkana. I-30 intersects I-49, after which it travels northeast. I-30 then passes through Hope, Prescott, Gurdon, Arkadelphia, and Malvern. At Malvern, drivers can use US 70 or US 270 to travel into historic Hot Springs or beyond into Ouachita National Forest. There, US 70 and US 67 join I-30 and stay with the Interstate into the Little Rock city limits. Northeast of Malvern, I-30 passes through Benton before reaching the Little Rock city limits. From Benton to its end at I-40, I-30 is a six-lane highway with up to 85,000 vehicles per day. As I-30 enters Little Rock, I-430 leaves its parent route to create a western bypass of the city. Just south of downtown, I-30 meets the western terminus of I-440 and the northern terminus of another auxiliary route in I-530. I-530 travels south to Pine Bluff. At this three-way junction of Interstates, I-30 turns due north for the final few miles of its route. Here, I-30 passes through the capitol district of Little Rock. I-30 also creates one final auxiliary route in I-630, or the Wilbur D. Mills Freeway, which splits downtown Little Rock in an east–west direction before coming to its other end at I-430 just west of downtown. After passing I-630, I-30 crosses the Arkansas River into North Little Rock and comes to its eastern terminus, despite facing north, at I-40. At its end, I-30 is joined by US 65, US 67, and US 167. US 65 joins I-40 westbound, while US 67 and US 167 join I-40 eastbound from I-30&#x27;s eastern terminus.

==History==

The very first fully controlled-access part of what is now I-30 was the Dallas–Fort Worth Turnpike, a controlled-access tollway in the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex. Completed by 1957, it operated as a toll road between 1957 and 1977, afterward becoming a nondescript part of I-20 and then I-30. The road, three lanes in each direction but later widened, is the only direct connection between downtown Fort Worth and downtown Dallas, Texas. In October 2001, the former turnpike was named the Tom Landry Highway, after the late Dallas Cowboys coach.

The proposed expressway was studied as early as 1944 but was turned down by the state engineer due to the expense. However, in 1953, the state legislature created the Texas Turnpike Authority, which, in 1955, raised $58.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) to build the project. Construction started later that year. On August 27, 1957, the highway was open to traffic, but the official opening came a week later on September 5. The turnpike&#x27;s presence stimulated growth in Arlington and Grand Prairie and facilitated construction of Six Flags Over Texas. At the end of 1977, the bonds were paid off, and the freeway was handed over to the state Department of Transportation, toll collection ceased, and the tollbooths were removed in the first week of 1978.

The existing US 67 route was already in heavy use in the early 1950s, at which point it was twinned from just east of Dallas to Rockwall and also a rural section near Greenville and a few miles in Hopkins County. There were still a few at-grade crossings on these two sections into the 1980s. The twinned US 67 routes were upgraded to Interstate Highway standards beginning in 1961, forming the R.L. Thornton Freeway. By the mid-1960s, much of I-30 was under construction outside the metroplex as well. The majority of the route was completed by 1965, but a stretch through rural areas built on a new alignment well away from US 67 between Mount Pleasant and New Boston remained unfinished. This remaining segment was finally built and opened to traffic in 1971, completing I-30.

Originally, the west end of I-30 was at the current intersection of I-30 and US 80 near the border of Mesquite and Dallas. I-20 went into downtown Dallas and across the former turnpike through downtown Fort Worth and to points west. Later, I-20 took its current southerly route around Dallas and Fort Worth, and I-30 assumed the former I-20 route from US 80 to western Fort Worth, and later to the current intersection with I-20 near Aledo.
I-30 was proposed to be extended along the US 67 freeway from Little Rock. However, this conflicted with the Missouri Department of Transportation&#x27;s plan to extend I-57, which is also planned to use US 67. In April 2016, a provision designating US 67 from North Little Rock to Walnut Ridge, Arkansas, as &quot;Future I-57&quot; was added to the federal fiscal year 2017 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development funding bill. The provision would also give Arkansas the ability to request any segment of the road built to Interstate Highway standards be officially added to the Interstate Highway System as I-57. Had I-30 been extended.
===Interstate 730===

There were plans to upgrade Arkansas Highway 226 (AR 226) to Interstate standards and designate it as &quot;Interstate 730&quot;. This would eventually become part of US 78 in 2023

===Interstate 130===

I-130 was a proposed auxiliary route of I-30 that was planned to be concurrent with I-49. Once the eastern segment of the Texarkana Loop had been upgraded to Interstate standards, I-130 was to have been signed; however, it is now part of I-49.



==Future==
TxDOT is currently upgrading a section of I-30 between exit 62 in Garland, Texas to exit 77 at the Rockwall-Hunt County line. The work will widen the interstate from six to eight lanes, rebuild bridges, including the bridge over Lake Ray Hubbard, and reconstruct interchanges. Full completion of the project is expected by the end of 2027.

==Exit list==



































































==Business routes==
I-30 formerly had two business routes, both of which were in Arkansas. There are currently no business routes of I-30.

===Benton===
Interstate 30 Business (I-30 Bus.) was a business route in Benton, Arkansas. It ran from exit 116 to exit 118 on I-30 from approximately 1960 to 1975, concurrently with US 70C.

===Little Rock===
Interstate 30 Business (I-30 Bus.) was a business route in Little Rock, Arkansas. The route started at exit 132 on I-30 and followed US 70B nearly its entire route. In North Little Rock, the route remained concurrent with US 70 and terminated at exit 141B on I-30.

<text>Interstate 35 (I-35) is a major Interstate Highway in the central United States. As with most primary Interstates that end in a five, it is a major cross-country, north–south route. It stretches from Laredo, Texas, near the Mexican border to Duluth, Minnesota, at Minnesota State Highway 61 (MN 61, London Road) and 26th Avenue East. The highway splits into I-35E and I-35W in two separate places, the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex in Texas and at the Minnesota twin cities of Minneapolis–Saint Paul.

At , I-35 is the ninth-longest Interstate Highway following I-94, and it is the third-longest north–south Interstate Highway, following I-75 and I-95. Even though the route is generally considered to be a border-to-border highway, this highway does not directly connect to either international border. I-35&#x27;s southern terminus is the traffic signal at Hidalgo Street in Laredo, Texas, just short of the Mexican border. Travelers going south can take one of two toll bridges across the Rio Grande and the border, either straight ahead into the Juárez–Lincoln International Bridge, or via Business Interstate 35-A (Bus. I-35-A) through downtown Laredo into the Gateway to the Americas International Bridge. To the north, I-35 terminates in Duluth, Minnesota, with connections to Canada from the Interstate&#x27;s terminus via MN 61 to Grand Portage, or north to the border at International Falls, Minnesota, via U.S. Route 53 (US 53) in Duluth.

In addition to the Dallas–Fort Worth and Minneapolis–Saint Paul areas, the major cities that I-35 also connects to include (from south to north) San Antonio, Texas; Austin, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Wichita, Kansas; Kansas City, Missouri; and Des Moines, Iowa.

===Texas===


I-35 northbound begins at a traffic-signaled intersection with Bus. I-35-A in Laredo, Texas, just north of the Rio Grande and the international border between Mexico and the US. It has a concurrency with US 83. Through Webb, La Salle, and Frio counties, it has a mostly north-northeastern course, turning more northeasterly around Moore. It then cuts across the corners of Medina and Atascosa counties before entering Bexar County and San Antonio.

I-35 is named the Pan Am Expressway in San Antonio. There, it has brief concurrencies with I-10 (with it US 87) and I-410, and it serves as the northern terminus of I-37. I-35 heads northeast out of the city toward the state capital, Austin.

In Austin, I-35 is the Interregional Highway and has a concurrency with US 290 through Downtown Austin. Throughout Austin, elevated express lanes were constructed on either side of the original freeway. Prior to this expansion, this section included an at-grade railroad crossing, which is extremely unusual for a freeway. From Austin, I-35 goes through Round Rock, Temple, Pflugerville, and Waco. In Belton, south of Temple, it serves as the current eastern terminus for I-14. In Waco, I-35 is known as the Jack Kultgen Freeway, and begins its concurrency with US 77. The campuses of both the University of Texas at Austin and Baylor University are located adjacent to I-35.

I-35 then heads to Hillsboro, where it splits into I-35W and I-35E and runs through the Dallas–Fort Worth area. The official milemarkers, along with the route of US 77, follow I-35E through Dallas—I-35W, which is in length, carries its own mileage from Hillsboro to Denton, as though it were an I-35 loop. In Dallas, I-35E is the R.L. Thornton Freeway south of I-30, which picks up the name heading east. North of I-30, it is the Stemmons Freeway.

After passing through Dallas and Fort Worth, I-35&#x27;s two forks rejoin each other in Denton near the University of North Texas campus. The unified Interstate then continues north to Gainesville before crossing the Red River into Oklahoma.

===Oklahoma===

In Oklahoma, I-35 runs from the Red River at the Texas border to the Kansas state line near Braman. It passes through or adjacent to many of the state&#x27;s major cities. From south to north, these cities include Ardmore, Pauls Valley, Purcell, Norman, Moore, Oklahoma City, and Edmond. In Downtown Oklahoma City, I-35 has a major junction with I-40 and spurs into I-235 through the north central inner city as heavy traffic follows through the city into the northern area of the state.

===Kansas===

Between the Oklahoma state line and Emporia, I-35 is part of the Kansas Turnpike. This section of Interstate serves Wichita and passes through the Flint Hills area. At Emporia, I-35 branches off on its own alignment. This free section of I-35 provides access to Ottawa before entering the Kansas City Metropolitan Area, where it serves Johnson County and Kansas City, Kansas.

Of note on the route, at several points between Cassoday and Emporia in the Flint Hills, dirt driveways that provide direct access without a ramp, for cattle trucks, may be found in either direction along the highway.

BETO Junction is a highway intersection in Coffey County, Kansas, that is the intersection of US 75 and I-35. It derives its name from the four major cities nearest the intersection: Burlington, Emporia, Topeka, and Ottawa. It is located north of Burlington at exit 155. Historically, the intersection referred to as &quot;BETO Junction&quot; before I-35 was constructed was located on the old US 75 alignments south and east, near Waverly, Kansas.

=== Missouri ===

I-35 enters Missouri southwest of Kansas City&#x27;s Central Business District as a six-lane highway. After merging with Southwest Trafficway and Broadway, it becomes eight lanes and continues north to downtown Kansas City, where it serves as the west and north legs of the downtown freeway loop. Along the north edge of the loop, I-35 joins with I-70 immediately west of Broadway and carries six lanes of traffic with a speed limit of . Upon leaving the loop, I-29 begins, concurrent with I-35. The two Interstates cross the Missouri River together on the Bond Bridge.

After crossing the river, I-29 and I-35 split. I-35 heads north to Cameron, Missouri, and then continues northward to the Iowa state line.

===Iowa===

In the southern sections of the state, I-35 is parallel to US 69 for much of its course.

In Des Moines, I-35 has a overlap with I-80. The concurrency takes place northwest of the downtown district of the city. At exit 127 of I-80, the overlap turns east and terminates at exit 137 via an interchange with I-235.

North of Des Moines, I-35 is mainly parallel with US 69, traversing a vast and rural area of Iowa.

I-35 is part of the Avenue of the Saints between Clear Lake and St. Paul, Minnesota. A four-lane link has been completed between Clear Lake and I-380 in Waterloo, Iowa.

===Minnesota===


At Medford, Minnesota, the on- and offramps lead to roundabouts rather than standard cross intersections. This is the first site in the state linked to a major highway to use roundabouts.

I-35 splits again into I-35W and I-35E in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area. The mile- and exit-numbering sequence continues along I-35E. At one sharp turn in I-35W near the junction with I-94, drivers are advised to slow to (although many drivers are able to maintain the speed limit of ). It is not possible to go from westbound I-94 to northbound I-35W, from southbound I-35W to eastbound I-94, and vice versa, without resorting to surface streets.

On I-35E in Minnesota between MN 5 and I-94, in both directions, trucks weighing more than are banned from the freeway, and the speed limit drops to . This section was not completed until the late 1980s (although the route was cleared and graded earlier) due to opposition from the historic Crocus Hill neighborhood, which sits only a few hundred feet from the alignment. The four-lane alignment, &quot;parkway&quot; design was a compromise. The truck bypass for this section is signed on I-494 and I-694 to the east of Saint Paul.

I-35 has an interchange with I-535/US 53 in Duluth, Minnesota, known locally as the &quot;Can of Worms&quot;. This junction features a pair of left exits from I-35, a stoplight, and lane drops over the I-35 bridge.

The national northern terminus of I-35 is at an intersection in eastern Duluth. Drivers&#x27; options include merging with London Road/MN 61 northbound, proceeding through the stop lights onto 26th Avenue East, or turning left onto London Road southbound.

==History==
Some portions of I-35 in Oklahoma City were already built in 1953, before the Interstate system was created. Through Norman, Oklahoma, the Interstate opened in June 1959. In Moore, it opened in two parts: the northern half, connecting Moore to Oklahoma City, opened in January 1960. The southern half, linking it to Norman, was opened to traffic in June 1967.

I-35 through Oklahoma largely parallels US 77. This is in large part due to efforts of the towns of Wynnewood, Paoli, and Wayne, which fought to keep I-35 as close as possible to US 77. This was successful due to a threat from Governor Henry Bellmon to build a toll road rather than I-35, and legislation preventing state funds for the Interstate from being spent if it were more than from the U.S. Route.

I-35 was completed in Oklahoma in 1971, when parts of the Interstate running through Carter Co. and Murray Co. were opened to traffic.

The final segment of I-35 (as originally planned) to open was in north-central Iowa, between Mason City and US 20 near Iowa Falls. This segment was delayed due to some controversy. Originally, I-35 was to follow the alignment of US 69 from Des Moines to the Minnesota border, but Mason City&#x27;s business community lobbied for the route to be moved closer to their city. On September 1, 1965, the alignment was changed to instead parallel US 65 through northern Iowa, which brought the highway much closer to Mason City. This created a long diagonal section through Wright and Franklin counties. Local farmers objected to their farms being bisected into triangular pieces, and resulting litigation delayed I-35 for several years. A November 1972 ruling rejected a lawsuit filed by the farmers, and the final segment of I-35 was allowed to proceed, eventually opening in 1975.

The Paseo Bridge over the Missouri River in Kansas City, Missouri, was replaced by the dual-span cable-stayed Christopher S. Bond Bridge in December 2010.

===&quot;NAFTA Superhighway&quot; controversy===

The proposed Trans-Texas Corridor toll-road project included one proposal (TTC-35) to primarily parallel I-35 from the Mexican border up to the Oklahoma border. There are major disagreements as to what impact this parallel route would have on I-35 in terms of traffic, maintenance, and commerce.

The Trans-Texas Corridor was first proposed by Texas Governor Rick Perry in 2002. It consisted of a wide highway that also carried utilities such as electricity, petroleum, and water as well as railway track and fiberoptic cables. In July 2007, US Representative Duncan Hunter successfully offered an amendment to House Resolution 3074, the FY2008 Transportation Appropriations Act, prohibiting the use of federal funds for Department of Transportation participation in the activities of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP). Hunter stated that: &quot;Unfortunately, very little is known about the NAFTA Super Highway. This amendment will provide Congress the opportunity to exercise oversight of the highway, which remains a subject of question and uncertainty, and ensure that our safety and security will not be compromised in order to promote the business interests of our neighbors.&quot; Fellow Republican Congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul brought the issue to mainstream prominence during the December 2007 CNN–YouTube GOP debate, where he rejected the concept and also called it the NAFTA Superhighway after the North American Free Trade Agreement and, like Hunter, framed it within the ultimate goal of creating a North American Union.

In 2011, the Texas Legislature formally repealed its authority for the establishment and operation of the Trans-Texas Corridor with the passage of HB 1201.

<text>Interstate 37 (I-37) is a Interstate Highway located within the southern portion of the US state of Texas. The highway was first designated in 1959 as a route between Corpus Christi and San Antonio. Construction in the urban areas of Corpus Christi and San Antonio began in the 1960s, and the segments of the Interstate Highway in rural areas were completed by the 1980s. Prior to I-37, the route between Corpus Christi and San Antonio was served by a combination of State Highway 9 (SH 9) from Corpus Christi to Three Rivers and US Highway 281 (US 281) from Three Rivers to San Antonio. As a result of the construction of I-37, SH 9 was removed from the State Highway System (the designation would be reinstated to another highway in 2014).

The highway begins in Corpus Christi at US 181 and SH 35 and heads north to San Antonio, where it ends at I-35. Beyond I-35, the freeway continues as US 281 to northern San Antonio as a major freeway. In Corpus Christi, the highway provides access to the downtown area, the Port of Corpus Christi, and Corpus Christi International Airport. In San Antonio, it provides access to Downtown San Antonio, Brooks City-Base, the Alamodome, the Tower of the Americas, the San Antonio River Walk, the Alamo, and, by extension via US 281, San Antonio International Airport. The route provides an important connection between I-35 and the Texas Gulf Coast as well as one of the few limited-access hurricane evacuation routes away from the southern Texas coast.

==Route description==
I-37 starts near the Gulf Coast in Corpus Christi and heads northwest toward San Antonio. It links South Texas to the northern parts of the state via I-69E, US 77, and US 281. The highway functions as one of the few freeway hurricane evacuation routes for the southern Texas coast. It roughly parallels US 181, which both begins and ends at I-37, and US 281.
Unofficially, I-37 begins at an intersection with Shoreline Boulevard on the edge of Corpus Christi Bay. It then heads west as a surface street for three blocks where it becomes entrance and exit ramps which connect to the freeway. I-37 begins officially at the gore point for these ramps, which is part of an interchange complex that also represents the southern ends of US 181 and SH 35.

It heads west from US 181 through Corpus Christi and intersects two freeways, SH 286 (the Crosstown Expressway) at exit 1C and SH 358 (Padre Island Drive) at exit 4A. The highway turns toward the northwest after the SH 358 interchange roughly parallel to the south of the Nueces River. Just prior to leaving the Corpus Christi city limits, it intersects and has a short concurrency with US 77 (future I-69E). US 77 (future I-69E) merges with I-37 as a freeway from the south at exit 14A northbound and exit 14 southbound; the two continue to the north and split after crossing the Nueces River. The Interstate continues to the northwest as US 77 (future I-69E) continues to the northeast at exit 17.

I-37 transitions to a rural setting once outside of the Corpus Christi city limits on its way to Mathis and Lake Corpus Christi. It continues on to the northwest and intersects US 59 (future I-69W) east of George West at exit 56. It begins paralleling US 281 to the east before the two intersect at exit 72 and have a concurrency north of Three Rivers near Choke Canyon Reservoir. Alternate US 281 (Alt. US 281) splits off from I-37 near Sunniland at exit 76 and parallels I-37 before rejoining north of Campbellton at exit 92 southbound. The two routes remain concurrent until US 281 splits off at exit 104 northbound to head to Pleasanton, while I-37 bypasses the city to the east. After US 281 leaves toward the northwest, I-37 turns to the north toward San Antonio.
As I-37 enters the San Antonio city limits, it intersects the northern terminus of US 181 at exit 132 southbound (this is according to the Texas Department of Transportation, or TxDOT; the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, or AASHTO, extends US 181 northward to the northern terminus of I-37). Continuing to the north, it intersects I-410, the inner loop around San Antonio, at exit 133 at a stack interchange. At this junction, the Interstate once again runs concurrently with US 281 which had been concurrent with I-410. Heading north through the south side of San Antonio, I-37 provides access to Brooks City-Base (formerly Brooks Air Force Base). After exit 135, a cloverleaf interchange at Loop 13, the freeway turns toward the northwest. The highway intersects I-10, which is concurrent with US 90 and US 87, at exit 139 at a stack interchange on the southeastern corner of Downtown San Antonio. After the interchange, it once again heads north on the east side of downtown. It passes near the Alamodome, Tower of the Americas, San Antonio River Walk, and Alamo. I-37 ends at the northeastern corner of downtown at exits 142A and 142B at a junction with I-35. US 281 continues to the north as a freeway and provides access to San Antonio International Airport and later far north central Texas.

From I-410 to I-10 in San Antonio, I-37 is designated the Lucian Adams Freeway, after the World War II veteran. Adams is a native of Port Arthur and received the Medal of Honor for his service in France, along with the Bronze Star Medal and Purple Heart, for his gallantry during the Battle of Monte Cassino. From I-10 to its northern terminus at I-35, it is designated the Staff Sergeant William J. Bordelon Freeway. Bordelon was the first San Antonio native to receive the Medal of Honor after being killed in action during WWII.

==History==
Prior to I-37, the routing between Corpus Christi and San Antonio was covered by SH 9 from Corpus Christi to Three Rivers and US 281 from Three Rivers to San Antonio. Beginning in 1971, sections of SH 9 were officially removed from the State Highway System as I-37 was completed. No sections of US 281 were removed from the State Highway System as a result of the construction of I-37, but the two do share the same alignment at two different points between San Antonio and Three Rivers. Also, US 281 was rerouted onto I-37 in San Antonio in 1978.

I-37 was first designated in 1959 to provide a route between San Antonio and Corpus Christi, and construction began in the 1960s. The $11-million (equivalent to $ in ) project to construct the interchange with I-10 was at the time the largest single contract in the history of the state highway commission. The route was completed by the 1980s. The first sections of the freeway completed were in Corpus Christi. The freeway was completed from its southern terminus to to the west at the Port Avenue overpass to include the SH 286 interchange in 1963. In 1964, the freeway was extended another westward with the completion of the overpasses at Nueces Bay and Buddy Lawrence boulevards. By 1965, the freeway had been extended west to Navigation Boulevard. In 1966, the interchange at SH 358 was complete, as were the mainlanes to Corn Products Road, west of the SH 358 interchange. By 1968, the freeway had been completed an additional further west to Callicoatte Road. The southbound I-37 bridge over the Nueces River was built in 1933 for US 77 (future I-69E) when it was first routed through Corpus Christi. The northbound bridge was built in 1958 with the expansion of US 77 (future I-69E) to four lanes.
Construction in San Antonio also began in the 1960s and was completed in 1972. The first sections were completed in 1967 to include the portion just south of I-410 at the US 181 interchange. The section from Steves Avenue north to Florida Street to include the I-10 interchange was also complete in 1967. In 1968, the section south of I-410 was extended south to Loop 1604. In 1969, the two sections were connected with the completion of overpasses at Goliad Road, Pecan Valley Drive, Fair Avenue, and Hackberry Street as well as the completion of the interchanges at I-410 and Loop 13. The last sections left were on the eastside of downtown. The downtown overpasses at Durango Boulevard, Commerce Street, and the overpass stretching from Houston Street to Jones Avenue were all completed in 1972. The last portion completed in San Antonio was the stack interchange at I-35 (also known as the San Antonio &quot;Downtown Mixer&quot;), near the Pearl Brewery. With the completion of the interchange in 1972, the city had a complete freeway loop in conjunction with I-10 and I-35 around the central business district of the city. At the time construction began in July 1969, the I-35 interchange was the largest highway construction project in state history at $11 million (equivalent to $ in ).
The rural sections of the freeway were completed later than those in the urban areas. Construction of the highway in Corpus Christi and Nueces County continued north over the Nueces River into San Patrico County. The interchange at US 77 (future I-69E) was completed in 1969. The road that was already in existence along this stretch, SH 9, would be utilized as a frontage road as many of the bridges along this stretch were from when SH 9 was built in the 1930s. The mainlanes were extended northward to SH 234 in 1969. By 1970, the freeway had been extended as far north as SH 188. In 1971, I-37 reached Farm to Market Road 888 (FM 888) and service to the city of Mathis. During the mid-1970s, the southern section and northern section were both being extended. The southern section was extended northward in Live Oak County to US 59 (future I-69W) in 1975 and FM 799 in 1976. The northern section saw completion in Atascosa County to FM 541 in 1975 and FM 1099 in 1976. By the early 1980s, the freeway was nearly complete. In 1980, the interchange at US 281 southeast of Pleasanton was complete. With the completion of the interchange at SH 72 and other bridges in the Pleasanton area in 1981, I-37 was complete.

<doc id="89541" wikidata="Q641346" url="?curid=89541" title="A Better Tomorrow">
<text>A Better Tomorrow () is a 1986 Hong Kong action film directed, co-written and co-produced by John Woo, co-produced by Tsui Hark, and starring Ti Lung, Leslie Cheung and Chow Yun-fat. The film had a profound influence on Hong Kong action cinema, and has been recognised as a landmark film credited with setting the template for the heroic bloodshed genre, with considerable influence on both the Hong Kong film industry and Hollywood.

Produced with a tight budget and released with virtually no advertising, &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; broke Hong Kong&#x27;s box office record and went on to become a blockbuster in Asia. It is regarded as one of the greatest Chinese-language films ever made, ranking #2 on the Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures list in 2005. Its success led to a sequel, &quot;A Better Tomorrow II&quot;, also directed by Woo, and &quot;A Better Tomorrow 3: Love &amp; Death in Saigon&quot;, a prequel directed by Hark. It has been remade several times.

The film was Chow Yun-fat&#x27;s breakout role and launched him as one of the top superstars in the Hong Kong film industry. Chow&#x27;s character &quot;Mark Lee&quot; has been imitated by many fans even decades after the film&#x27;s release. Following this film, Chow went on to make several more notable films with Woo.

==Plot==
Sung Tse-Ho is a senior member of a powerful Hong Kong triad, managing a lucrative printing and distributing operation that produces counterfeit American bank notes. Ho is a respected member of the organization, entrusted with the most important transactions. Mark Lee is his best friend, bodyguard, and business partner. The prologue follows a day in the life of Ho and Mark as they watch a fresh batch of counterfeit notes being printed and meet with foreign clients to trade their product for counterfeit Hong Kong dollar notes.

Meanwhile, Ho&#x27;s younger brother, Kit, has just graduated high school and is currently training to join the police. Ho hides his criminal life from his brother and encourages Kit&#x27;s career choice, while their ailing father pleads for Ho to leave his life of crime. Ho agrees, deciding that he will retire from the triad after his next deal in Taiwan. Shing, a low-ranking triad member, joins Ho after he agrees to mentor him. However, they are ambushed by the Taiwanese triads, leading to a shootout in which Ho and Shing flee into a sewage tunnel entrance, pursued by local law enforcement. Ho tells Shing to run and surrenders to the police in order to buy time for him to escape, leading to a three-year prison sentence.

After learning of the deal, the triads attempt to kidnap Ho&#x27;s father as leverage to ensure Ho&#x27;s silence in prison; Ho&#x27;s father is fatally stabbed before Kit and his girlfriend Jackie manage to subdue the attacker. With his dying breath, he pleads Kit to forgive his brother for his criminal actions, and an enraged Kit blames Ho for their father&#x27;s death. Later, Mark travels to Taiwan to get answers from the Taiwanese triad. He visits a restaurant where the gangster who planned the ambush is dining and kills him following a shootout with his bodyguards. However, Mark&#x27;s leg is injured in the process, leaving him crippled and requiring a leg brace.

After Ho is released from prison, he is approached by a corrupt policeman, who offers to take him back to triad headquarters so he can rejoin his old organization. Ho, determined to start a new life, declines the offer and instead begins working for a taxi company run by another ex-con named Ken. During one of his shifts, Ho encounters Mark, and he discovers that his old friend is now a bitter, broken shell of his former self after Shing stripped him of his position in the triad and cast him aside in his rise to power. When they reunite, Mark urges Ho to confront Shing, but Ho refuses. Ho then seeks out Kit, now a police officer, in hopes of reconciling.

However, Ho is harshly rebuffed by Kit, who still blames Ho for their father&#x27;s death and because his relation to Ho is preventing him from advancing his career. In an effort to prove himself and further distance himself from his brother, Kit becomes obsessed with bringing down Shing, despite Ho&#x27;s warnings. Shing, hearing of Ho&#x27;s return to Hong Kong, tries to persuade him to return and help expand their triad into drug trafficking, but Ho refuses. Shing then has his men attack the taxi company, severely beat Mark, and lure Kit into a trap that leaves him critically wounded. Though Ho is still hesitant to take action, Mark is eventually able to persuade Ho to retaliate.

Mark steals a computer tape containing printing plate data from the counterfeiting business and they then discover that it was Shing who set up the ambush three years prior. Meanwhile, Shing sets up triad leader Yie and shoots him dead; the witnesses are told to lie to the police that Ho was the killer. Ho and Mark then use the tape to blackmail Shing in exchange for money and an escape boat. Ho ensures that the tape is passed to Kit as proof of Shing&#x27;s crimes. Using Shing as a hostage, Ho and Mark take the money to a pier, where Shing&#x27;s men await. There, Ho implores Mark to escape by himself in the boat, and Mark hesitantly agrees.

After Mark&#x27;s departure, Kit arrives on the scene intending to arrest Shing, but ends up being taken hostage. A deal is made to exchange Shing for Kit, but the negotiation spirals into first a standoff and eventually a shootout. Ho and Kit work together against Shing&#x27;s men, and are overwhelmed. Mark, hearing the sounds of gunfire, quickly returns to the scene. Ho, Kit and Mark kill several of Shing&#x27;s henchmen, but also suffer injuries in the process. During a lull in the gunfight, Ho attempts to make peace with Kit but is rebuffed again. Mark then reprimands Kit, telling him that Ho&#x27;s present actions have atoned for the past. As the three are distracted however, Mark is fatally shot in the back by Shing.

As the police approach, Shing mocks Ho and Kit, proclaiming that once he enters police custody, his money and power will ensure his swift release. Kit then hands Ho his gun, allowing him to fatally shoot Shing. As Kit watches Shing&#x27;s body fall to the ground, Ho suddenly handcuffs himself to Kit. The two brothers then begin walking together towards the gathered crowd of police.

==Cast==
== Production ==
The film is an uncredited remake of the 1967 film &quot;The Story of a Discharged Prisoner&quot;. It was also partially inspired by &quot;The Brothers&quot;, a 1979 Hong Kong crime film, plot elements of which were reimagined for &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;. &quot;The Brothers&quot; had a similar plot about two brothers on opposing sides of the law, the elder brother a mobster and the younger brother a cop. In turn, &quot;The Brothers&quot; was a remake of &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975), an Indian crime drama written by Salim–Javed.

The scene in which Mark Lee tells the story of being forced to drink urine is apparently based on a real incident involving Chow Yun-fat and director Ringo Lam. This scene was recreated in Woo&#x27;s &quot;Bullet in the Head,&quot; which was originally scripted as a prequel to &quot;A Better Tomorrow,&quot; before being changed to a standalone film.

The English title likely originates from the song Tomorrow Will Be Better, written by Lo Ta-yu, which is traditionally sung during New Year&#x27;s Eve, and is featured in the film.

While Woo had experienced success with a number lighter comedic films, Woo had long aspired to direct a gangster film similar to those made by Jean-Pierre Melville. Tsui Hark and his then spouse Nansun Shi had started their own film production company Film Workshop and as Hark had been friends with Woo and knew he was experiencing frustration and battling alcoholism, having lost enthusiasm for making the films he was expected to, Hark invited him to write and direct a film for his company which would end up being &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;. The relationship between Woo and Hark during production was contentious due to Hark&#x27;s hands-on producing style and Woo&#x27;s independent directing process.

* Taichung Correctional Center, Taichung

== Music ==

* During the nightclub scene, the song being played in the background (幾許風雨, &quot;How Much Wind and Rain&quot;) is the Cantonese version of a classic South Korean song called &#x27;Hee Na Ree&#x27; (희나리) sung originally by Goo Chang-mo in 1985. The Cantonese version in the movie was sung by Roman Tam, considered the &quot;godfather&quot; of Cantopop.
* Also heard in the soundtrack is &quot;Sparrowfall 1&quot;, a track from Brian Eno&#x27;s 1978 album, &quot;Music for Films&quot;.
* The film also contains &quot;Birdy&#x27;s Flight&quot; (from the film &quot;Birdy&quot;) by Peter Gabriel incorporated into the soundtrack.
* In the scene where Ho meets Jackie back stage of the music recital to tell her he is leaving, the children&#x27;s choir is singing &quot;Tomorrow Will Be Better&quot;, written by Lo Ta-yu. This is likely the origin of the film&#x27;s English title.

== Reception ==
&quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; grossed $34,651,324 HKD at the Hong Kong box office.

In 2009, &quot;Empire Magazine&quot; named it #20 in a poll of the 20 Greatest Gangster Movies You&#x27;ve Never Seen* (*Probably)

=== Awards and nominations ===
== Sequels and remakes ==
The success of &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; spawned two follow-ups. A direct sequel, &quot;A Better Tomorrow 2&quot;, was released the following year. John Woo returned to direct, as did most of the main cast, with Chow Yun-fat playing Mark&#x27;s hitherto-unmentioned twin brother Ken. A prequel, &quot;A Better Tomorrow III: Love &amp; Death in Saigon&quot;, was released in 1989, with Chow returning to play Mark. Woo was not involved in the prequel, due to a falling-out with Tsui Hark, so Hark directed the film himself. Woo&#x27;s unproduced screenplay draft was later made as &quot;Bullet in the Head&quot; (1990).

The film has two official remakes. &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; (2010) was produced in South Korea, directed by Song Hae-sung, with John Woo serving as executive producer. &quot;A Better Tomorrow 2018&quot; (2018) was produced in Mainland China, directed by Ding Sheng.

==Cultural impact==
* After the film, teenage boys in Hong Kong wore long dusters in emulation of Chow&#x27;s character even though the climate was sub-tropical. In fact, in colloquial Cantonese, trench coats are called &quot;Mark Gor Lau&quot; (literally, Brother Mark&#x27;s coat).
* The storyline (including dialogs and costumes) was made into a Thai film &quot;Diamond Kingdom&quot; (&quot;Phet Payak Kharat&quot;; ) in 1988 with many Thai performers involved. Sombat Metanee as Tanong (Sung Tse Ho in original version), Sorapong Chatree as Chat (Mark Lee in original version), Chairat Chittham as Ruj (Sung Tse Kit in original version), with Pumpuang Duangjan as Pen (Tanong&#x27;s lover not in original version). It was created without copyright.
* The Wu-Tang Clan has a song named after the film on their 1997 album &quot;Wu-Tang Forever.&quot;
* The Wu-Tang Clan 20th anniversary album also shares the name &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;.
*The anime series &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; has many references to the film series, including the last fight between Spike and Vicious in the episode &quot;The Real Folk Blues (Part 2)&quot; which parallels the final shoot out in &quot;A Better Tomorrow 2&quot;.
*The character Mr. Chang from &quot;Black Lagoon&quot; is closely patterned after Chow&#x27;s character Mark in both visual design and characterisation. 
*Chow wore Alain Delon sunglasses model 707A in the movie. After the movie, Hong Kong was sold out of Alain Delon&#x27;s sunglasses. Delon sent Chow a personal thank you note.
* The 1994 Bollywood film &quot;&quot; (1994), directed by Sanjay Gupta, was an unofficial remake combining elements of both the Bollywood classic &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975) and John Woo&#x27;s &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;. The film starred Sanjay Dutt, Atul Agnihotri, Aditya Pancholi and Shakti Kapoor.
*The theme song was covered in 2016 by Louis Koo and Leo Ku in memoriam of Leslie Cheung.
*A CGI animation of a beaver cosplaying and reenacting as Mark from a scene in the movie became an internet meme.
*In Japan, this film was adapted into a musical called &quot;&quot; in June 2024.

<text>Interstate 39 (I-39) is a north–south Interstate Highway in Illinois and Wisconsin that runs from an interchange at I-55 in Normal, Illinois, to State Trunk Highway 29 (WIS 29) approximately south of Wausau, Wisconsin. In total, Interstate 39 is long. In Illinois, the route has a total length of ; in Wisconsin, I-39 has a distance of .

Among the newest Interstate Highways in Illinois, I-39 was completed in 1992. Designed to replace U.S. Route 51 (US 51) with an Interstate-grade freeway, the highway runs concurrently with US 20 in Rockford before joining I-90. From Rockford to Portage, Wisconsin, I-39 and I-90 run concurrently. From Madison to Portage, I-94 joins the two; at , the three-way concurrency is the longest in the country. From Portage northward, US 51 rejoins I-39, and the Interstate uses its mileposts northward. 

== Route description ==
=== Illinois ===

In Illinois, I-39 begins at I-55 north of Bloomington–Normal, Illinois, less than one mile east from the intersection of I-74 and I-55 that runs around the city of Normal. US 51 splits from I-55, joining I-39; exit 2 marks the northern terminus of the US 51 business route. From Normal northward, I-39 runs northward largely through rural areas. At exit 8, the route forms the southern terminus of Illinois Route 251 (IL 251), which was derived from the original routing of US 51.

In Oglesby in central LaSalle County, I-39 passes next to Starved Rock State Park, the busiest state park in Illinois. North of the park, it crosses the Illinois River over the Abraham Lincoln Memorial Bridge; at long, it is the longest bridge in the state. Just north of the river, I-39 passes between the cities of LaSalle and Peru; as it intersects I-80 and US 6, it makes its southernmost connections with the Chicago region. North of I-80, the wind turbines of the Mendota Hills Wind Farm (the first commercial wind farm in Illinois) can be seen from milepost 72 at Mendota north to near Paw Paw. As I-39 continues northward, I-39 also intersects US 52 and US 30.

In Ogle County, I-39 intersects with I-88 (IL 110), connecting I-39 to both Chicago and the Quad Cities regions. As it intersects IL 38, IL 64, and IL 72, I-39 connects with the DeKalb–Sycamore region and far west suburbs of the Chicago area.

As I-39 crosses into Winnebago County, the Baxter Road exit (exit 115) is the final exit before I-39 joins the US 20 freeway bypass in Rockford. Approximately a mile east of the Alpine Road/US 20 interchange, I-39 joins US 20, moving from nearly entirely farmland to medium-density populated areas.

After heading northeast for approximately , US 20 splits from I-39/US 51; a mile northward, I-39/US 51 runs concurrently with I-90 (Jane Addams Memorial Tollway). Though signed as I-39/I-90, the concurrency follows the mileposts of I-90. Though I-39 itself is not tolled, the Illinois Tollway collects tolls on the I-90 portion, including two ramp interchanges and an open-road toll plaza between Rockton and South Beloit.

At exit 1 (IL 75) in South Beloit, US 51 splits from I-39 to join IL 75; westward, it continues the route of IL 251 into Wisconsin. For all but one mile that I-39 is in Illinois, it runs concurrently with US 51.

=== Wisconsin ===
I-39 enters Wisconsin in Rock County, concurrently with I-90. Bypassing Beloit to the east, it passes underneath the County Trunk Highway P bridge (CTH-P, Stateline Road). The tri-stack exit 185 provides access to Beloit through WIS 81 and serves as the southern terminus of I-43 (accessing Milwaukee and Green Bay). The northernmost interchange serving the Beloit region is CTH-S (Shopiere Road) at exit 183. About north of the I-43 interchange, I-39/I-90 is joined by WIS 11 for as it bypasses Janesville. In addition to the northern interchange that holds WIS 11, Janesville is also accessed by US 14 and WIS 26 (Milton Avenue). After crossing the Rock River, I-39/I-90 has an interchange with WIS 59, connecting it with Edgerton (to the west) and Milton (to the southeast).

I-39 enters Dane County north of WIS 59, passing west of Lake Koshkonong. For approximately , US 51 rejoins the Interstate (from mile 160 to 156) before it heads west through Stoughton. I-39/I-90 changes direction north of Utica, gradually turning northwest. At exit 142, the highway turns returns north as it meets US 12/US 18 in Madison, forming the eastern terminus of the Madison Beltline Highway; for approximately , northbound I-39 is reduced to two lanes (for the first time since Cherry Valley, Illinois). North of the Beltline, I-39 accesses Madison through an interchange with WIS 30 and I-94 (routed from Milwaukee); the interchange is known as the Badger Interchange. further north, the highway has an interchange with US 151 (splitting Madison and Sun Prairie); the northernmost Madison-area I-39 interchanges are US 51 (Madison and DeForest) and WIS 19 (Sun Prairie and Waunakee); CTH-V (West North Street) for DeForest serves as the last Dane County exit.

I-39/I-90/I-94 enters Columbia County north-northwest of CTH-V. From the county line northward, the highway returns to rural surroundings. after crossing the Wisconsin River, exit 108 (Wisconsin Dells) splits I-90/I-94 from I-39. For the first time since the US 20 Bypass in Rockford–Cherry Valley, I-39 is four lanes instead of six or eight. I-39 continues northward from WIS 78 (which terminates at the interchange), routed towards Portage. I-39 connects with Portage through WIS 33, crosses the Wisconsin River a second time, connects with WIS 16; a third interchange rejoins I-39 with US 51. I-39 takes on the mileposts of the latter.

After taking on US 51, I-39 continues northward, with few directional changes through Marquette County and Waushara County. In Portage County, the highway continues its northward direction until it reaches the Stevens Point region, where it bypasses the city to the east and north; four interchanges connect with the city (CTH-HH, US 10/WIS 66, Stanley Street, and Bus. US 51).

From Stevens Point northward, I-39 largely parallels the path of the Wisconsin River and Lake DuBay. Following its entrance into Marathon County, WIS 153 connects to I-39 in Mosinee, adjacent to the Central Wisconsin Airport. The final north-south interchange of I-39 is exit 185 (Bus. US 51) in Rothschild, just before I-39 crosses the Wisconsin River.

I-39 ends with exit 187, as WIS 29 merges with US 51 (for approximately ); the latter highway continues north to its terminus at US 2 at the Wisconsin–Michigan border.

== History ==
=== Illinois ===
When the Interstate Highway System was first being planned, Illinois made a request for a north–south highway from South Beloit to Salem. The project was deemed a low priority and was shelved. US 51, which ran mostly down the middle of the state, became a heavily traveled two-lane arterial road, experiencing many crashes and earning the nickname &quot;Killer 51&quot;.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a major supplemental freeway system plan was proposed, with the goal of providing Illinois residents access to freeways within 30 minutes or less. One of the proposed routes, FAP 412, was a route that would extend from US 20 in Rockford to I-57 just north of Salem, similar to the earlier requested route. Due to traffic counts, only the portion between Rockford and Decatur was prioritized.

Over the course of the 1970s, planning for the US 51 supplemental freeway took place in earnest. However, debate ensued over what type of highway should be built. The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) wanted the entire highway built to Interstate Highway standards, but a transportation committee established to review the proposed supplemental freeway system recommended only Interstate construction between Rockford and I-80. The highway from Oglesby south to Decatur was recommended to be an at-grade expressway, utilizing the existing road where possible. After a decade of lobbying by interest groups, it was announced in 1986 that US 51 would be rebuilt to Interstate standards from Oglesby to Normal. However, due to funding concerns and local opposition, it was decided that the Bloomington to Decatur segment would not be built to Interstate standards; this segment was made a four-lane expressway.

The first segment of the freeway opened 1984 from IL 5 (now I-88) in Rochelle, to US 20 in Rockford. When the freeway was completed south from IL 5 to I-80 in 1986, IDOT officially requested an Interstate designation for the new highway, and I-39 was officially designated. By December 1987, construction on the section of I-39 between I-80 and IL 251 was finished. The next section, between IL 251 and I-55 in Bloomington–Normal, was completed by 1992, although this stretch of the highway was opened in several phases as completed. In December 1989, the section from Bloomington–Normal to Hudson opened, a distance of about . In early September 1992, another segment opened from IL 116 north to IL 17.

=== Wisconsin ===
In Wisconsin, the highway was officially designated in 1992. In October 1993, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) established part of I-39 in its northern section between Rockford and Rib Mountain, Wisconsin, then designated I-39 along existing portions of I-90, I-94, and US 51. However, this part of the highway was not marked as I-39 for another four years, primarily because the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) had to reconstruct the interchange connecting I-90 and I-94 with WIS 78 near Portage. Signs denoting I-39 were placed along the highway in Wisconsin until 1996, when the section between Portage and Rib Mountain (near Wausau) received its signs. This occurred after then–Governor Tommy Thompson designated the stretch between Portage and Wausau in 1996 after a five-year push to get the Interstate designation approved. The remaining segment along I-90/I-94 was not signed for I-39 until late 1998. The section between the I-90/I-94 interchange and US 51&#x27;s interchange in Portage was previously a part of WIS 78. That route was truncated back to its current terminus when the Interstate&#x27;s designation went into effect. The designation of I-39 violated Wisconsin&#x27;s rule of not having any state trunk highway number duplicated—Interstate, US, or state—as WIS 39 already existed.

<text>A teen idol is a celebrity with a large teenage fan base. Teen idols are generally young but are not necessarily teenagers themselves. An idol&#x27;s popularity may be limited to teens, or may extend to all age groups.

== By region ==
=== Asia ===


East Asia possesses a robust fan culture centered around idols, one that spans both genders and generates broad appeal. East Asian idol culture, which first began in Japan in the 1960s, would spread to neighboring countries in later decades: in South Korea and Taiwan, for example, it took root in the 1990s, and in China the 2010s. Idols are also not limited to singing, and may take part in more explicitly image-focused venues such as pin-up photography (gravure idols) and pornography (AV idols).

There are many different idols and idol groups spread across many countries. In Japan, there are pop stars Ayumi Hamasaki and Namie Amuro as well as Kana Nishino and music groups such as Momoiro Clover Z, Morning Musume, AKB48, and Perfume and Johnny &amp; Associates boy bands Arashi, NEWS, KAT-TUN, and Hey! Say! JUMP among others. In Taiwan, there are pop icons such as Jay Chou, Jolin Tsai, music groups Mayday, F4, and S.H.E. In South Korea, notable K-pop personalities include singers BoA and Rain and groups BTS, Blackpink, Twice, Exo, TVXQ, 2PM, 2AM, Beast, Shinee, Super Junior, 2NE1, Big Bang, Wonder Girls, T-ara, Kara and Girls&#x27; Generation. In Vietnam, there are the singers WanBi Tuấn Anh, Sơn Tùng M-TP, Đông Nhi, Bảo Thy and Tóc Tiên. 
=== Europe ===

European teen idols include German popstar Bill Kaulitz of the pop-rock band Tokio Hotel and the members of the Anglo-Irish pop boy band One Direction, and Girls Aloud, another Anglo-Irish band. In Spain, La Oreja de Van Gogh, Miguel Bosé, Mecano, and Hombres G all enjoyed teen-idol status. In the Balkans, the late Macedonian singer Toše Proeski was considered a teen idol. 
=== Latin America ===
In Latin America, idols ranges from Mexican pop stars Timbiriche (including their members, Paulina Rubio and Thalía), Lynda Thomas, Magneto, Puerto Rican born Mexican Luis Miguel, Colombian Shakira and the popular Puerto Rican boy band Menudo in the 1980s and 1990s, and Paty Cantú, Anahí, Belinda, and RBD in the 2000s and 2010s. Besides, former Menudo member Ricky Martin, their chief rivals Los Chicos and former member Chayanne, Venezuelan actor and singer Guillermo Davila and more, to Argentina, where telenovela, &quot;Chiquititas&quot;, ushered in a new era of teen-idols for that country, including actors Benjamin Rojas, Felipe Colombo, Luisana Lopilato, and Camila Bordonaba, who went on to form teen band Erreway, precursors to Mexican band RBD. &quot;Quinceañera&quot; (1987), starring by Thalía and Adela Noriega became the first &quot;telenovela&quot; made for teenagers. 


=== North America ===
Often teen idols are actors or musicians. Some teen idols began their careers as child actors, such as Britney Spears, Hilary Duff, Raven-Symoné and Miley Cyrus. There were teen idols before there were teen magazines, but idols have always been a permanent feature in magazines such as &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;16&quot;, &quot;Tiger Beat&quot; and &quot;Right On!&quot; in the United States, and in similar magazines elsewhere. With the advent of television, teen idols were also promoted through programs such as &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;Soul Train&quot;. Today&#x27;s teen idols have spawned an entire industry of gossip magazines, television shows, YouTube, social media, and whole television channels such as E!.
== By era ==
=== Early teen idols ===

The first known person to have been treated as a teen idol was Franz Liszt, the Hungarian pianist who, in the 1840s, drew such a following among teen girls that the term &quot;Lisztomania&quot; soon came to describe the phenomenon. The kind of idolizing following Liszt drew in Europe would not be followed for several decades. American-born Roger Wolfe Kahn became, arguably, America&#x27;s first modern-day teen idol, when, in 1924 at the age of sixteen he launched his first jazz band. Throughout his teens, he became dubbed the &#x27;Millionaire Maestro.&#x27; Geraldine Farrar, American opera singer, had a large following of young women nicknamed &quot;Gerry-flappers&quot; in the early 20th century. Rudy Vallée, who became a major success in 1929 with hits like &quot;Honey&quot; and &quot;Deep Night&quot;, may have been the first American popular singer to have been idolised by hundreds of teen-aged girls at sold-out concerts. He was also possibly the first popular singer to have a star vehicle created for him: &quot;The Vagabond Lover&quot;.Frank Sinatra, whose early career in the 1940s is often linked to his appeal to bobby soxers, who got that name because they were forced to dance in their bobby socks so that their shoes would not damage the dance floor, is also regarded as having been amongst the first teen idols.
===1950s–1960s===

Although he had only three major movie roles, James Dean earned two Oscar nominations. He also had the image of a rebellious youth, something that was popular among girls and young women. His performance in &quot;Rebel Without A Cause&quot; (1955) and his untimely death in a road collision in 1955 cemented his status as an icon. Contemporary teenagers still wear white T-shirts and jeans in his style.

Selected by Walt Disney in 1955 for his new show &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, Annette Funicello became popular among viewers by the end of the first season. Elvis Presley made his debut in the mid-1950s and became a sensation. Deemed too dangerous to be filmed except from the waist up because of his sexually suggestive dance moves, he became popular among teenagers. The success of young rock stars like Presley, film stars like Marlon Brando, Paul Newman, James Dean, Tab Hunter, and Sal Mineo in the 1950s, as well as the wider emergence of youth subcultures, led promoters to the deliberate creation of teen idols such as singers Frankie Avalon, Frankie Valli, Frankie Lymon, Fabian Forte, Bobby Rydell and Connie Stevens. Even crooners like Frank Sinatra were still considered idols and rather handsome. Actors Edd Byrnes and Troy Donahue and other artists deliberately cultivated a (safer) idol image, like Canadian musician Paul Anka.


Post-war teens were able to buy relatively inexpensive phonographs — including portable models that could be carried to friends&#x27; houses — and the new 45-rpm singles. Rock music played on 45s became the soundtrack to the 1960s as people bought what they heard on the radio. The great majority of the music being marketed to 1950s teens was being written by adults, but 1960s teens were increasingly appreciating and emulating artists closer to their own age, to teen fashion, and to lyrics which addressed their own concerns. Their parents worried about their attraction to artists (and DJs) who were edgy and rebellious. Faces on magazines fed fans; fans buy records, see films, watch TV and buy fashions.
Some marketers turned to film and TV for fresh, &#x27;safe&#x27; faces. Tommy Sands&#x27;s debut in a television film about the phenomenon, &quot;The Idol&quot;, made a teen idol out of Sands himself.

Teen idol Ricky Nelson rose to stardom on the hit show &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot; and the show was successfully used to promote his songs, making him one of the biggest stars in music. His wholesome image was a stark contrast to the uproar caused by Elvis Presley, with parents often approving of Nelson. 

Rick’s popularity continued to grow as Elvis and the Everly Brothers were in the military, Chuck Berry was imprisoned, and Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens died. However his popularity declined as the British Invasion hit the United States. when the Beatles arrived in 1964. They had already been famous in the United Kingdom. But after making their debut in the U.S. on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on February 9, 1964, the Beatles soon became the most successful and influential band in modern musical history, staying at the top of Billboard charts for a grand total of 58 weeks between 1964 and 1970. Adolescent hysteria was so loud that the band had trouble performing at concerts. The level of stardom they achieved in the U.S.—dubbed Beatlemania—was never before seen in that country, not even during the heyday of Elvis Presley. Many teenage girls waited outside the hotels the Beatles were staying at, hoping to catch a glimpse of their favorite musicians. It is believed that a part of their success in the U.S. was because they brought hope and joy to a nation that was still recovering from the shock of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Another possible reason was that the Beatles were young, energetic, good-looking, and witty, which made it easy for them to become famous in the age of television.

Some young TV stars were being hustled into studios to make recordings; for example, ex-Mousketeer Annette Funicello became one of the first big female idols as well as the Lennon Sisters whom had cut out dolls and were always on the covers of the gossip magazines; another, Johnny Crawford of &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, had five Top-40 hits. In 1963, Luke Halpin made a big splash as a teen idol in the television program &quot;Flipper&quot;. After &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; was released in 1963, Bobby Rydell became an instant teen idol.

In the 1960s as situation comedies and dramas on television using child actors became more popular, actors Paul Petersen, Patty Petersen, and Shelley Fabares from &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, Dwayne Hickman from &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, Sally Field of &quot;Gidget&quot;, Jon Provost of &quot;Lassie&quot;, Jay North from &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, and Keith and Kevin Schultz known as the &quot;Schultz Twins&quot; on &quot;The Monroes&quot; all became younger preteen idols and grew into being teen idols.

Herman&#x27;s Hermits, the Rolling Stones, and the Beach Boys were teen idols, especially during the earlier part of their careers, although they quickly grew out of that status. The Rolling Stones did it through a more rebellious image, the Beatles did it through their more developed (or &quot;grown up&quot;) music. Similarly, Neil Sedaka had two distinct eras of his career, with about a decade in between: one as a teen idol in the 1960s, and a later career in adult contemporary music. Roy Orbison was known for his songs &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman,&quot; &quot;Only the Lonely,&quot; and &quot;Crying.&quot; From the family band the Cowsills, Susan Cowsill, John Cowsill and Barry Cowsill became teen idols. Many of the teen idols of the era were the sons of older, established stars; Dino, Desi &amp; Billy were active as teen idols during the mid-sixties. The group included Dean Paul Martin (son of singer Dean Martin), and Billy Hinsche (a mutual friend whose parents were not famous). Gary Lewis, son of comedian Jerry Lewis, fronted the Playboys during this era.

All of the Monkees became instant teen idols in the late 1960s after their TV show became an overnight success, especially for Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones. The British-born Monkee Davy Jones was regularly featured in teen fan magazines. In 2008, &quot;Yahoo Music&quot; named Jones the number one teen idol of all time, and in 2009 he was ranked second in a list compiled by &quot;Fox News&quot;.

Teen fan magazine &quot;TeenSet&quot; began publishing in 1964, focusing on youthful bands and musicians. &quot;Tiger Beat&quot; magazine began competing for the same audience in 1965.

===1970s===
After Davy Jones came Bobby Sherman and David Cassidy, who held the title of Teen Idols from the late 1960s until the mid-1970s. Both Sherman and Cassidy were actors on television and chart topping musicians in the pop-rock category at the time; with David Cassidy in particular enjoying immense international fame and success. Sherman was on hit TV shows &quot;Shindig!&quot; and &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot; among many others. Musical series such as Cassidy&#x27;s &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, the animated series &quot;The Archie Show&quot;, and (to a lesser extent) &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; integrated television and teen-pop music to significant success during this time frame. The Brady Bunch&#x27;s Barry Williams and Christopher Knight, as was tennis pro/actor Vincent Van Patten all were constantly in the fan magazines at the time. Popular actors such as John Moulder Brown, Leonard Whiting, Ray Lovelock (Raymond Lovelock), Leif Garrett, Mark Hamill, Mark Lester, Jan-Michael Vincent and Jack Wild were the talk of the teenagers in the 1970s as well. Musical group the Hudson Brothers were on many teen magazine covers for a number of years as teen idols. They had two shows on TV during the 1970s and recorded many albums.

One of the features of many teen idols is that their fans (and, in some cases, the musicians themselves) tended to develop a hate for the music once they became adults, and it is not much listened to by adults, except for nostalgia: the legacy of bubblegum pop. Teen idol performers in this category would include Shaun Cassidy, Leif Garrett, the Osmond Brothers (particularly Donny Osmond and their teen idol sister Marie Osmond), Andy Gibb, Tony DeFranco of the Canadian band the DeFranco Family, and the Bay City Rollers (UK). Even modern classic hits and oldies outlets, which cover this time period, rarely play cuts from the teen idols of the era. A notable exception is Michael Jackson of the Jackson Five, who began his career as a teen idol along with his brothers, but whose individual career eventually evolved far beyond the limitations of that description and into superstardom.

The Jackson Five were the first African-American music group to become national teen idols, appearing along with famous white idols in magazines such as &quot;16&quot; and &quot;Tiger Beat&quot;. In addition, the charismatic appeal, showmanship and flurry of fans towards lead Michael Jackson made him a teen idol and heartthrob amongst teens; his success as a soloist continued into the 1980s.

===1980s===
In 1985, actress Alyssa Milano from &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; became a major teen idol. In the mid-1980s there was a group of young actors called the Brat Pack; the whole group collectively and separately became teen idols. They were Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy. They starred in many coming of age films together in some fashion and became very popular without being musicians. Molly Ringwald entered the limelight with the films &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; and &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;.

Actors Corey Feldman and Corey Haim also became teen idols during the later part of the 1980s with films &quot;The Goonies&quot; and together &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;, &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot; and &quot;License to Drive&quot; among other films. They were dubbed &quot;the two Coreys&quot;. Before Corey Haim&#x27;s death in 2010, they did a reality TV show for two seasons (2007–08) on A&amp;E named &quot;The Two Coreys&quot; after their 1980s moniker. Actor River Phoenix during his teen years became a teen idol during the later part of the 1980s, as did Christian Slater. Australian singer-actor Rick Springfield was regarded as the teen idol in the 1980s with such hits as &quot;Jessie&#x27;s Girl&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk to Strangers&quot;. The Grammy Award-winning musician Springfield was known for playing Dr. Noah Drake on the daytime drama &quot;General Hospital&quot;. He originated the character from 1981 to 1983. He left acting after his music career took off.

During this decade, Puerto Rican boy band Menudo, caused a sensation in Latin America compared to Beatles&#x27; Beatlemania. At the end of the 1980s, actor Kirk Cameron became a major teen idol. Cameron was best known for his role as Mike Seaver on the television situation comedy &quot;Growing Pains&quot; from 1985 to 1992. Also Scott Baio and Willie Aames of &quot;Charles in Charge&quot; fame found themselves regulars in teen magazines. One of the most popular female singers of the 1980s, with teen idol status was Madonna, especially among youth female audience which was later named Madonna wannabes.

In popular music, the late 1980s was the boom of teenagers dominating the music charts. Debbie Gibson became the youngest person to write, perform and produce a number-one single, &quot;Foolish Beat&quot;, and also had many hits from her first two albums. Tiffany, another teen icon, became a pop sensation at 15 years old thanks to an aggressive marketing strategy. She promoted her debut album in shopping malls of the US. She is also the youngest person to have a debut album hit number one and have multiple number one singles from that album (&quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot; and &quot;Could&#x27;ve Been&quot;). Having become a household name, she had then-unknown band New Kids on the Block as an opening act for her shows. However, the sudden popularity of the New Kids caused their roles to be reversed. Gibson and Tiffany&#x27;s careers had stalled by the early 1990s; so had NKOTB by the mid-nineties. The other boy band from Boston, New Edition, was popular with the teen set by the end of the 1980s.

=== 1990s ===

The manufacturing of teen idols has been marketed more aggressively and with greater sophistication since the 1980s. Many of the major teen idols in the 1990s were bands and musical acts. The rise of MTV in the 1980s and the success of the boy bands and girl groups during the 1990s and 2000s continued to fuel the phenomenon. Besides a combination of good, clean-cut looks and a ubiquitous marketing campaign, such bands typically include a variety of personality types (e.g. &quot;the shy one&quot;, &quot;the smart one&quot;, etc.) These idols were often found on the covers and pages of teen magazines during the 1990s as teen idols as well. Classic examples of boy bands include Menudo, New Kids on the Block, Take That, Backstreet Boys, and NSYNC, all becoming the best-selling pop groups of the decade. Hanson was initially marketed as such a band, but eventually outgrew this label to become a successful indie band. Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Lopez, Mandy Moore, Jessica Simpson, and Britney Spears, along with female bands such as the Spice Girls, TLC, and Destiny&#x27;s Child, also became very popular at the end of the decade. Even though the Spice Girls split in 2000, they remain fairly popular in England.

During this decade, the Latin artist Shakira was described as a &quot;teen idol&quot;, her songs reached number 1 on Latin radio, her videos were among the most viewed, while her hair and clothing style was emulated by girls and young women. from the continent identifying with their songs, this was called &quot;Shakiramía&quot; or &quot;Shakira Fever&quot;

The Backstreet Boys&#x27; popularity grew in 1997 with &quot;Everybody (Backstreet&#x27;s Back),&quot; a song produced by Max Martin. Opting against joining a girl band, Britney Spears released the music video &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; in 1998 on MTV, which pushed her into the public consciousness. Her first album of the same name made its debut at the top of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s charts, and became the world&#x27;s best-selling album by a teenage solo artist. Before she turned 20 years, Spears was also recognized by the Guinness World Records as the best-selling teenage artist. Spears and Billie Piper also became the youngest artists to have accumulated more number-one songs in the UK singles chart.

After the movie &quot;Clueless&quot; (1995), Alicia Silverstone became a teen idol. The 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot; made Leonardo DiCaprio a teen idol; during &quot;Leo-Mania&quot; his face appeared on many teen magazines. Fraternal twin sisters and actresses Ashley Olsen and Mary-Kate Olsen were major tween idols and as they grew up they later became teen idols during the 1990s.

=== 2000s ===

The 2000s would be a decade of transition due to increasing amount of media platforms coming from TV and the internet, though Hollywood would still be a spring board for many names in the early years of the decade. Actors such as Josh Hartnett, Heath Ledger and Ashton Kutcher would dominate the teen idol scene for the early 2000s. Hartnett become the most prominent face of the young Hollywood actors entering the 2000s. He appeared on dozens of major magazine covers and was the subject of a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; cover story remarking on his meteoric rise to fame. The intense attention he received during this time period caused him to turn down high-profile roles, including a reported $100 million offer to play Superman, before temporarily leaving Hollywood.

The Walt Disney Company and its numerous outlets (e.g. Disney Channel, Radio Disney and Walt Disney Pictures) were the first to successfully develop a new generation of teen idols in this period, starting with the careers of actresses and singers Hilary Duff and Lindsay Lohan, initially targeting youth and female teen audiences. While still teenagers, Duff became famous for her starring titular character in the Disney Channel teen sitcom &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; and her multi-Platinum second studio album &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; (2003), with which she became one of the youngest artists to reach the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and Lohan became famous for her starring roles in many successful teen movies, including &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; (2003), &quot;Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen&quot; (2004), &quot;Mean Girls&quot; (2004) and &quot;&quot; (2005), and her platinum debut studio album &quot;Speak&quot; (2004). The success of this marketing led to further development of the genre, including new teen idols such as Raven-Symoné, Dylan and Cole Sprouse, Zac Efron, Aly &amp; AJ, Jesse McCartney, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, Corbin Bleu, Brenda Song, Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers. Disney has also used another one of its own TV channels, Freeform, to develop shows and stars popular among teen girls. &quot;Mean Girls&quot;, a well-known comedy written by Tina Fey, also saw the performances of Rachel McAdams and Amanda Seyfried (in her first role).

Raven-Symoné had already gained popularity as a child actor for her roles on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; (1989-1992) and &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot; (1993-1997) along with appearing in the &quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot; films, but became a household name from being the titular character on the extremely popular and successful Disney Channel show &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; (2003-2007) as well as being a part of The Cheetah Girls and the films (2003-2006). She also had a supporting role in &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot; (2004), a leading role in &quot;College Road Trip&quot; (2008) and voiceover roles in &quot;Kim Possible&quot; and &quot;Tinker Bell.&quot;

Miley Cyrus claimed her fame by playing a fictionalized version of herself on the television show &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; (2006-2011). Her 2009 singles &quot;The Climb&quot; and &quot;Party in the U.S.A&quot; were both mega hits. However, as she began metamorphosizing into something more mature, her popularity fell as parents considered her new materials inappropriate for their children.

Selena Gomez made her debut by starring in the Disney situational comedy &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot; (2007-2012) and released her first album &quot;Kiss &amp; Tell&quot; in 2009. She became an icon for adolescent girls and women, yet details of her personal life put her under public scrutiny.
ViacomCBS-owned Nickelodeon, a competitor to Disney Channel, has also developed its own slate of stars for its television shows, including Amanda Bynes, Drake Bell, Josh Peck, Emma Roberts, Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Nathan Kress, Jamie Lynn Spears (sister of Britney Spears), Ariana Grande, Victoria Justice, Elizabeth Gillies, and groups the Naked Brothers Band and Big Time Rush, many of whom have not only starred in TV shows, but recorded songs as well. Many of the modern-day teen idols are females marketed as &quot;role models&quot; to teen and tween girls, a departure from the traditional role of the male teen idol marketed as the idolized teen &quot;heartthrob&quot;. Actress Mischa Barton became a teen idol through her role on &quot;The O.C.&quot;, with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; naming her character Marissa Cooper “It Girl&quot; of 2003.

In 2002, Canadian singer Avril Lavigne dominated the music scene and eventually became a worldwide teen idol. Listed at #4 on Yahoo!&#x27;s Top 25 Teen Idols of all-time.

During the popularity of her sister Jessica Simpson&#x27;s MTV reality television series &quot;&quot; with then-husband Nick Lachey, &quot;7th Heaven&quot; actress Ashlee Simpson developed a music career through her own MTV spin-off reality series &quot;The Ashlee Simpson Show&quot; in 2004, and soon became a teen idol.

American musician Taylor Swift entered the scene at age 16 by co-writing the song &quot;Tim McGraw&quot; with Liz Rose in 2005, after which she became a well-known and successful artist as well as a teen idol.

Before reaching the age of 20, Ariana Grande had already been popular among secondary schoolchildren by starring in the teen comedy show &quot;Victorious&quot; (2010-2013)&quot;.&quot; She left acting for singing, and although her singing career got off to a rocky start, she did capture the attention of producer and songwriter Max Martin, who had worked with many successful artists before.

Teen idols were also popular in the R&amp;B and Hip-Hop realm throughout this decade, including Chris Brown, JoJo, Bow Wow, 3LW, Ciara, Mario, B2K, and Rihanna, among others.

In the late 2000s, bands like Lillix, KSM, Everlife, and Clique Girlz became teen pop idols and have a teenage fanbase.

Discovered on YouTube by media entrepreneur Scooter Braun at the age of 13, Justin Bieber was ushered into fame with his 2009 album &quot;My World&quot;.

=== 2010s ===
In Japan, more and more Japanese idol groups have appeared. In Japanese culture, persons called &quot;idols&quot; are media personalities in their teens and early twenties who are considered particularly attractive or cute and who will, for a period ranging from several months to a few years, regularly appear in the mass media, e.g. as singers for pop groups, bit-part actors, TV personalities, models in photo spreads published in magazines, advertisements, etc. One of the most successful groups is Momoiro Clover Z. Their performances incorporate elements of ballet, gymnastics, and action movies. During 2014, about 486,000 people attended their live concerts, which was the highest record of all female musicians in Japan. Momoiro Clover Z has been ranked as one of the most popular female idol groups from 2013 to 2017.

In the late 2010s, many young actors developed large followings amongst teenagers after portraying famous contemporary literary characters. The most notable among these were Ansel Elgort (Augustus Waters), Timothée Chalamet (Elio Perlman), and Nick Robinson (Simon Spier). These actors were referred to by the media and general public as &quot;White Boys of the Month&quot;, with the term becoming a popular meme since. Noah Centineo became popular among teenagers and young adults following the release of &quot;To All the Boys I&#x27;ve Loved Before&quot;, having amassed over 15 million Instagram followers within eight weeks of the film&#x27;s release; he was dubbed an &quot;internet boyfriend&quot; by the media.

Although the future members of the boy band One Direction got elimated as solo acts on the third season of &quot;The X Factor&quot;, guest judge Nicole Scherzinger suggested that they form a group together. The result was much fame and fortune for the band, who burst onto the scene in 2012. The group went on indefinite hiatus in 2016, and since 2017, its members have been pursuing solo projects.

Kylie Jenner rising to prominence in the mid-2010s can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, her appearances on her family&#x27;s hit TV series &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&quot; gave her a platform to showcase her unique personality and relatable experiences. Additionally, her bold and ever-changing sense of fashion, coupled with her flawless makeup looks, made her a style icon for many teenagers. Moreover, her active presence on social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat allowed her to connect with her fan base on a more personal level, giving them a glimpse into her glamorous lifestyle. In 2014 &amp; 2015 she was named among &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 most influential people in the world citing her considerable influence among youth on social media. Kylie&#x27;s influence in the beauty industry with her lip kits and cosmetics brand Kylie Cosmetics also contributed to her teen idol status.

Similarly, in 2016 the Cuban-born American singer Camila Cabello left the girl group Fifth Harmony, which went on indefinite hiatus in 2018, in order to pursue a solo career. She makes use of her Latin American heritage in her rhythms. At age 18, American musician Billie Eilish won four Grammy Awards in 2020, and was commissioned to perform the theme song for the James Bond movie &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (2021). The song topped the charts in February 2020. She wrote it with her brother, Finneas, becoming the youngest artist to do so. She has tens of millions of followers on social media, and is well known for her lyrics concerning mental health such as depression and anxiety. Millie Bobby Brown rose to fame from her role as Eleven in the Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;. Her co-stars Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, and Sadie Sink have also achieved fame from their roles in the series.

=== 2020s ===
American artist Olivia Rodrigo had previously worked as a child actress on the Disney comedy series &quot;Bizaardvark&quot; (2016–19) and starred in the first three seasons of &quot;High School Musical: The Musical: The Series&quot; (2019–present). In January 2021, she released her debut single, &quot;Drivers License&quot;, which went on to become one of the most streamed songs on Spotify at the time and spent eight weeks on top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. She sings with profanities in an emotionally charged manner of the struggles of an adolescent and commands a large following on social media networks, including TikTok, where she has many teen-aged supporters. Some sources consider Rodrigo to be a representative of Generation Z.

Italian rock band Måneskin was ushered into international attention after winning the Eurovision Song Contest 2021, with their winning track &quot;Zitti e buoni&quot; as well as &quot;I Wanna Be Your Slave&quot; and their cover of The Four Seasons&#x27; &quot;Beggin&#x27;&quot; reaching the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Global Excl. U.S. chart, supported by a growing following on TikTok and other social media platforms. Prior to their Eurovision win, the band finished as runner-up in the eleventh season of the Italian &quot;X Factor&quot; in 2017. Måneskin are credited as one of the first rock bands to heavily appeal to Generation Z.
== Impact and influence ==
In the West, the Beatles, Bob Dylan, and the Rolling Stones were extremely popular among the Baby Boomers when they were growing up. Parents, by contrast, saw their influence greatly diminished. In the United Kingdom, for instance, a combination of the Lady Chatterley trial (1959) and the first long-play of the Beatles, &quot;Please Please Me&quot; (1963) triggered a change public perception of human mating, a cause subsequently taken up by young people seeking sexual liberation.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the music industry made a fortune selling rock records to people between the ages of fourteen and twenty-five. This era was home to many youthful stars—people like Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones or Jimi Hendrix—who had lifestyles that all but guaranteed early deaths. The death of a (former) teen idol can have a serious impact on fans, leading to outbursts of emotions. This was certainly the case when people like Davy Jones or Michael Jackson died. And if an artist who reached fame at a young age were to die prematurely, he or she could spark conversations about the cost of fame. This has been a recurring theme following the deaths of Amy Winehouse (at age 27), Avicii (at 28), or Liam Payne (aged 31). These stars lacked a stable home environment, had an extremely busy and stressful schedule, were exposed to an adult environment as a teenager, face frequent and intense public scrutiny, and were prone to alcoholism or substance abuse. Their deaths also fuel the myth that such endings are common among talented musicians, an idea that could be traced back to the antique world. In the fourth century B.C., Greek playwright Menander claimed, &quot;Whom the Gods love die young.&quot; But the myth that they die at the age of 27 is a modern phenomenon. Statistical analysis has debunked this myth; there is no peak risk of dying at around age 27 for famous individuals, even if those who die at this specific age may garner more attention. However, famous young artists face an elevated risk of dying in their 20s and 30s relative to the general population. In the United Kingdom, the risk is two to three times higher. 

But even as their fans age, the audience of idols does not necessarily shrink, as the fans who became parents can introduce their children to their music. People tend to be nostalgic about music from their youth. In the twenty-first century, (former) teen idols can continue to be highly successful years after they made their debut as can be seen from the number of streams, digital downloads, CDs, cassettes, and vinyl records shipped. To-date, the Beatles remain one of the best-selling bands of all times. Their success is unlikely to be replicated in the twenty-first century because trends have much shorter lifetimes and musical genres have splintered.

The charm and charisma manifested by American actor James Dean onscreen proved strongly appealing to the audience, and his persona of youthful rebellion provided a template for succeeding generations of youth to model themselves on. Various artists, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Buddy Holly, and David Bowie, cited Dean as an influence. Musician Taylor Swift referenced him in &quot;Style&quot; (2014). Meanwhile, wearing white T-shirts and jeans remains iconic among young people today.

The K-pop band Girls&#x27; Generation has generally been considered as a cultural icon of not just South Korea, but also a part of the Korean Wave, the rising popularity of Korean culture on the international stage. As of 2019, another K-pop band, BTS, was reportedly worth more than US$4.65 billion, or 0.3 percent of the GDP of their home country. They attracted one in every 13 foreign visitors to South Korea and were cited as one of the key acts in boosting global music sales to US$19 billion in 2018. Data from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) shows that BTS became the best-selling artists of 2020 worldwide, ahead of Taylor Swift, Drake, the Weeknd, and Billie Eilish.

A 2023 report by the Federal Reserve estimated that Taylor Swift&#x27;s Eras Tour was responsible for $4.6 billion of consumer spending in the United States alone; local economies were significantly boosted by her presence. Besides the Fed, various state and local authorities have credited Swift with increasing demand for their tourism and hospitality industries, despite the slow recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic. During the early 2020s, a number of American universities offered courses pertaining to Taylor Swift, her music, and her cultural impact. Taylor Swift is also seen as a positive role model for young people on prosocial behavior and on dealing with body-image issues and unrealistic cultural expectations.

<text>Water vapor, water vapour or aqueous vapor is the gaseous phase of water. It is one state of water within the hydrosphere. Water vapor can be produced from the evaporation or boiling of liquid water or from the sublimation of ice. Water vapor is transparent, like most constituents of the atmosphere. Under typical atmospheric conditions, water vapor is continuously generated by evaporation and removed by condensation. It is less dense than most of the other constituents of air and triggers convection currents that can lead to clouds and fog.

Being a component of Earth&#x27;s hydrosphere and hydrologic cycle, it is particularly abundant in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, where it acts as a greenhouse gas and warming feedback, contributing more to total greenhouse effect than non-condensable gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Use of water vapor, as steam, has been important for cooking, and as a major component in energy production and transport systems since the industrial revolution.

Water vapor is a relatively common atmospheric constituent, present even in the solar atmosphere as well as every planet in the Solar System and many astronomical objects including natural satellites, comets and even large asteroids. Likewise the detection of extrasolar water vapor would indicate a similar distribution in other planetary systems. Water vapor can also be indirect evidence supporting the presence of extraterrestrial liquid water in the case of some planetary mass objects.

Water vapor, which reacts to temperature changes, is referred to as a &#x27;feedback&#x27;, because it amplifies the effect of forces that initially cause the warming. Therefore, it is a greenhouse gas.

== Properties ==

=== Evaporation ===
Whenever a water molecule leaves a surface and diffuses into a surrounding gas, it is said to have evaporated. Each individual water molecule which transitions between a more associated (liquid) and a less associated (vapor/gas) state does so through the absorption or release of kinetic energy. The aggregate measurement of this kinetic energy transfer is defined as thermal energy and occurs only when there is differential in the temperature of the water molecules. Liquid water that becomes water vapor takes a parcel of heat with it, in a process called evaporative cooling. The amount of water vapor in the air determines how frequently molecules will return to the surface. When a net evaporation occurs, the body of water will undergo a net cooling directly related to the loss of water.

In the US, the National Weather Service measures the actual rate of evaporation from a standardized &quot;pan&quot; open water surface outdoors, at various locations nationwide. Others do likewise around the world. The US data is collected and compiled into an annual evaporation map. The measurements range from under 30 to over 120 inches per year. Formulas can be used for calculating the rate of evaporation from a water surface such as a swimming pool. In some countries, the evaporation rate far exceeds the precipitation rate.

Evaporative cooling is restricted by atmospheric conditions. Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. The vapor content of air is measured with devices known as hygrometers. The measurements are usually expressed as specific humidity or percent relative humidity. The temperatures of the atmosphere and the water surface determine the equilibrium vapor pressure; 100% relative humidity occurs when the partial pressure of water vapor is equal to the equilibrium vapor pressure. This condition is often referred to as complete saturation. Humidity ranges from 0 grams per cubic metre in dry air to 30 grams per cubic metre (0.03 ounce per cubic foot) when the vapor is saturated at 30 °C.

=== Sublimation ===

Sublimation is the process by which water molecules directly leave the surface of ice without first becoming liquid water. Sublimation accounts for the slow mid-winter disappearance of ice and snow at temperatures too low to cause melting. Antarctica shows this effect to a unique degree because it is by far the continent with the lowest rate of precipitation on Earth. As a result, there are large areas where millennial layers of snow have sublimed, leaving behind whatever non-volatile materials they had contained. This is extremely valuable to certain scientific disciplines, a dramatic example being the collection of meteorites that are left exposed in unparalleled numbers and excellent states of preservation.

Sublimation is important in the preparation of certain classes of biological specimens for scanning electron microscopy. Typically the specimens are prepared by cryofixation and freeze-fracture, after which the broken surface is freeze-etched, being eroded by exposure to vacuum until it shows the required level of detail. This technique can display protein molecules, organelle structures and lipid bilayers with very low degrees of distortion.

=== Condensation ===
Water vapor will only condense onto another surface when that surface is cooler than the dew point temperature, or when the water vapor equilibrium in air has been exceeded. When water vapor condenses onto a surface, a net warming occurs on that surface. The water molecule brings heat energy with it. In turn, the temperature of the atmosphere drops slightly. In the atmosphere, condensation produces clouds, fog and precipitation (usually only when facilitated by cloud condensation nuclei). The dew point of an air parcel is the temperature to which it must cool before water vapor in the air begins to condense. Condensation in the atmosphere forms cloud droplets.

Also, a net condensation of water vapor occurs on surfaces when the temperature of the surface is at or below the dew point temperature of the atmosphere. Deposition is a phase transition separate from condensation which leads to the direct formation of ice from water vapor. Frost and snow are examples of deposition.

There are several mechanisms of cooling by which condensation occurs:
1) Direct loss of heat by conduction or radiation.
2) Cooling from the drop in air pressure which occurs with uplift of air, also known as adiabatic cooling.
Air can be lifted by mountains, which deflect the air upward, by convection, and by cold and warm fronts. 
3) Advective cooling - cooling due to horizontal movement of air.

=== Importance and Uses ===
* Provides water for plants and animals: Water vapour gets converted to rain and snow that serve as a natural source of water for plants and animals.
* Controls evaporation: Excess water vapor in the air decreases the rate of evaporation.
* Determines climatic conditions: Excess water vapor in the air produces rain, fog, snow etc. Hence, it determines climatic conditions.

=== Chemical reactions ===
A number of chemical reactions have water as a product. If the reactions take place at temperatures higher than the dew point of the surrounding air the water will be formed as vapor and increase the local humidity, if below the dew point local condensation will occur. Typical reactions that result in water formation are the burning of hydrogen or hydrocarbons in air or other oxygen containing gas mixtures, or as a result of reactions with oxidizers.

In a similar fashion other chemical or physical reactions can take place in the presence of water vapor resulting in new chemicals forming such as rust on iron or steel, polymerization occurring (certain polyurethane foams and cyanoacrylate glues cure with exposure to atmospheric humidity) or forms changing such as where anhydrous chemicals may absorb enough vapor to form a crystalline structure or alter an existing one, sometimes resulting in characteristic color changes that can be used for measurement.

=== Measurement ===
Measuring the quantity of water vapor in a medium can be done directly or remotely with varying degrees of accuracy. Remote methods such electromagnetic absorption are possible from satellites above planetary atmospheres. Direct methods may use electronic transducers, moistened thermometers or hygroscopic materials measuring changes in physical properties or dimensions.

=== Impact on air density ===
Water vapor is lighter or less dense than dry air. At equivalent temperatures it is buoyant with respect to dry air, whereby the density of dry air at standard temperature and pressure (273.15 K, 101.325 kPa) is 1.27 g/L and water vapor at standard temperature has a vapor pressure of 0.6 kPa and the much lower density of 0.0048 g/L.

==== Calculations ====
Water vapor and dry air density calculations at 0 °C:
* The molar mass of water is , as calculated from the sum of the atomic masses of its constituent atoms.
* The average molar mass of air (approx. 78% nitrogen, N2; 21% oxygen, O2; 1% other gases) is at standard temperature and pressure (STP).
* Obeying Avogadro&#x27;s Law and the ideal gas law, moist air will have a lower density than dry air. At max. saturation (i. e. rel. humidity = 100% at 0 °C) the density will go down to 28.51 g/mol.
* STP conditions imply a temperature of 0 °C, at which the ability of water to become vapor is very restricted. Its concentration in air is very low at 0 °C. The red line on the chart to the right is the maximum concentration of water vapor expected for a given temperature. The water vapor concentration increases significantly as the temperature rises, approaching 100% (steam, pure water vapor) at 100 °C. However the difference in densities between air and water vapor would still exist (0.598 vs. 1.27 g/L).

==== At equal temperatures ====
At the same temperature, a column of dry air will be denser or heavier than a column of air containing any water vapor, the molar mass of diatomic nitrogen and diatomic oxygen both being greater than the molar mass of water. Thus, any volume of dry air will sink if placed in a larger volume of moist air. Also, a volume of moist air will rise or be buoyant if placed in a larger region of dry air. As the temperature rises the proportion of water vapor in the air increases, and its buoyancy will increase. The increase in buoyancy can have a significant atmospheric impact, giving rise to powerful, moisture rich, upward air currents when the air temperature and sea temperature reaches 25 °C or above. This phenomenon provides a significant driving force for cyclonic and anticyclonic weather systems (typhoons and hurricanes).

=== Respiration and breathing ===
Water vapor is a by-product of respiration in plants and animals. Its contribution to the pressure, increases as its concentration increases. Its partial pressure contribution to air pressure increases, lowering the partial pressure contribution of the other atmospheric gases (Dalton&#x27;s Law). The total air pressure must remain constant. The presence of water vapor in the air naturally dilutes or displaces the other air components as its concentration increases.

This can have an effect on respiration. In very warm air (35 °C) the proportion of water vapor is large enough to give rise to the stuffiness that can be experienced in humid jungle conditions or in poorly ventilated buildings.

=== Lifting gas ===
Water vapor has lower density than that of air and is therefore buoyant in air but has lower vapor pressure than that of air. When water vapor is used as a lifting gas by a thermal airship the water vapor is heated to form steam so that its vapor pressure is greater than the surrounding air pressure in order to maintain the shape of a theoretical &quot;steam balloon&quot;, which yields approximately 60% the lift of helium and twice that of hot air.

=== General discussion ===
The amount of water vapor in an atmosphere is constrained by the restrictions of partial pressures and temperature. Dew point temperature and relative humidity act as guidelines for the process of water vapor in the water cycle. Energy input, such as sunlight, can trigger more evaporation on an ocean surface or more sublimation on a chunk of ice on top of a mountain. The &quot;balance&quot; between condensation and evaporation gives the quantity called vapor partial pressure.

The maximum partial pressure (&quot;saturation pressure&quot;) of water vapor in air varies with temperature of the air and water vapor mixture. A variety of empirical formulas exist for this quantity; the most used reference formula is the Goff-Gratch equation for the SVP over liquid water below zero degrees Celsius:

:formula_1

where , temperature of the moist air, is given in units of kelvin, and is given in units of millibars (hectopascals).

The formula is valid from about −50 to 102 °C; however there are a very limited number of measurements of the vapor pressure of water over supercooled liquid water. There are a number of other formulae which can be used.

Under certain conditions, such as when the boiling temperature of water is reached, a net evaporation will always occur during standard atmospheric conditions regardless of the percent of relative humidity. This immediate process will dispel massive amounts of water vapor into a cooler atmosphere.

Exhaled air is almost fully at equilibrium with water vapor at the body temperature. In the cold air the exhaled vapor quickly condenses, thus showing up as a fog or mist of water droplets and as condensation or frost on surfaces. Forcibly condensing these water droplets from exhaled breath is the basis of exhaled breath condensate, an evolving medical diagnostic test.

Controlling water vapor in air is a key concern in the heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) industry. Thermal comfort depends on the moist air conditions. Non-human comfort situations are called refrigeration, and also are affected by water vapor. For example, many food stores, like supermarkets, utilize open chiller cabinets, or &quot;food cases&quot;, which can significantly lower the water vapor pressure (lowering humidity). This practice delivers several benefits as well as problems.

== In Earth&#x27;s atmosphere ==

Gaseous water represents a small but environmentally significant constituent of the atmosphere. The percentage of water vapor in surface air varies from 0.01% at -42 °C (-44 °F) to 4.24% when the dew point is 30 °C (86 °F). Over 99% of atmospheric water is in the form of vapour, rather than liquid water or ice, and approximately 99.13% of the water vapour is contained in the troposphere. The condensation of water vapor to the liquid or ice phase is responsible for clouds, rain, snow, and other precipitation, all of which count among the most significant elements of what we experience as weather. Less obviously, the latent heat of vaporization, which is released to the atmosphere whenever condensation occurs, is one of the most important terms in the atmospheric energy budget on both local and global scales. For example, latent heat release in atmospheric convection is directly responsible for powering destructive storms such as tropical cyclones and severe thunderstorms. Water vapor is an important greenhouse gas owing to the presence of the hydroxyl bond which strongly absorbs in the infra-red.

Water vapor is the &quot;working medium&quot; of the atmospheric thermodynamic engine which transforms heat energy from sun irradiation into mechanical energy in the form of winds. Transforming thermal energy into mechanical energy requires an upper and a lower temperature level, as well as a working medium which shuttles forth and back between both. The upper temperature level is given by the soil or water surface of the Earth, which absorbs the incoming sun radiation and warms up, evaporating water. The moist and warm air at the ground is lighter than its surroundings and rises up to the upper limit of the troposphere. There the water molecules radiate their thermal energy into outer space, cooling down the surrounding air. The upper atmosphere constitutes the lower temperature level of the atmospheric thermodynamic engine. The water vapor in the now cold air condenses out and falls down to the ground in the form of rain or snow. The now heavier cold and dry air sinks down to ground as well; the atmospheric thermodynamic engine thus establishes a vertical convection, which transports heat from the ground into the upper atmosphere, where the water molecules can radiate it to outer space. Due to the Earth&#x27;s rotation and the resulting Coriolis forces, this vertical atmospheric convection is also converted into a horizontal convection, in the form of cyclones and anticyclones, which transport the water evaporated over the oceans into the interior of the continents, enabling vegetation to grow.

Water in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is not merely below its boiling point (100 °C), but at altitude it goes below its freezing point (0 °C), due to water&#x27;s highly polar attraction. When combined with its quantity, water vapor then has a relevant dew point and frost point, unlike e. g., carbon dioxide and methane. Water vapor thus has a scale height a fraction of that of the bulk atmosphere, as the water condenses and exits, primarily in the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide () and methane, being well-mixed in the atmosphere, tend to rise above water vapour. The absorption and emission of both compounds contribute to Earth&#x27;s emission to space, and thus the planetary greenhouse effect. This greenhouse forcing is directly observable, via distinct spectral features versus water vapor, and observed to be rising with rising levels. Conversely, adding water vapor at high altitudes has a disproportionate impact, which is why jet traffic has a disproportionately high warming effect. Oxidation of methane is also a major source of water vapour in the stratosphere, and adds about 15% to methane&#x27;s global warming effect.

In the absence of other greenhouse gases, Earth&#x27;s water vapor would condense to the surface; this has likely happened, possibly more than once. Scientists thus distinguish between non-condensable (driving) and condensable (driven) greenhouse gases, i.e., the above water vapor feedback.

Fog and clouds form through condensation around cloud condensation nuclei. In the absence of nuclei, condensation will only occur at much lower temperatures. Under persistent condensation or deposition, cloud droplets or snowflakes form, which precipitate when they reach a critical mass.

Atmospheric concentration of water vapour is highly variable between locations and times, from 10 ppmv in the coldest air to 5% (50 000 ppmv) in humid tropical air, and can be measured with a combination of land observations, weather balloons and satellites. The water content of the atmosphere as a whole is constantly depleted by precipitation. At the same time it is constantly replenished by evaporation, most prominently from oceans, lakes, rivers, and moist earth. Other sources of atmospheric water include combustion, respiration, volcanic eruptions, the transpiration of plants, and various other biological and geological processes. At any given time there is about 1.29 x 1016 litres (3.4 x 1015 gal.) of water in the atmosphere. The atmosphere holds 1 part in 2500 of the fresh water, and 1 part in 100,000 of the total water on Earth. The mean global content of water vapor in the atmosphere is roughly sufficient to cover the surface of the planet with a layer of liquid water about 25 mm deep. The mean annual precipitation for the planet is about 1 metre, a comparison which implies a rapid turnover of water in the air – on average, the residence time of a water molecule in the troposphere is about 9 to 10 days.
Global mean water vapour is about 0.25% of the atmosphere by mass and also varies seasonally, in terms of contribution to atmospheric pressure between 2.62 hPa in July and 2.33 hPa in December. IPCC AR6 expresses medium confidence in increase of total water vapour at about 1-2% per decade; it is expected to increase by around 7% per °C of warming.

Episodes of surface geothermal activity, such as volcanic eruptions and geysers, release variable amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere. Such eruptions may be large in human terms, and major explosive eruptions may inject exceptionally large masses of water exceptionally high into the atmosphere, but as a percentage of total atmospheric water, the role of such processes is trivial. The relative concentrations of the various gases emitted by volcanoes varies considerably according to the site and according to the particular event at any one site. However, water vapor is consistently the commonest volcanic gas; as a rule, it comprises more than 60% of total emissions during a subaerial eruption.

Atmospheric water vapor content is expressed using various measures. These include vapor pressure, specific humidity, mixing ratio, dew point temperature, and relative humidity.

=== Radar and satellite imaging ===

Because water molecules absorb microwaves and other radio wave frequencies, water in the atmosphere attenuates radar signals. In addition, atmospheric water will reflect and refract signals to an extent that depends on whether it is vapor, liquid or solid.

Generally, radar signals lose strength progressively the farther they travel through the troposphere. Different frequencies attenuate at different rates, such that some components of air are opaque to some frequencies and transparent to others. Radio waves used for broadcasting and other communication experience the same effect.

Water vapor reflects radar to a lesser extent than do water&#x27;s other two phases. In the form of drops and ice crystals, water acts as a prism, which it does not do as an individual molecule; however, the existence of water vapor in the atmosphere causes the atmosphere to act as a giant prism.

A comparison of GOES-12 satellite images shows the distribution of atmospheric water vapor relative to the oceans, clouds and continents of the Earth. Vapor surrounds the planet but is unevenly distributed. The image loop on the right shows monthly average of water vapor content with the units are given in centimeters, which is the precipitable water or equivalent amount of water that could be produced if all the water vapor in the column were to condense. The lowest amounts of water vapor (0 centimeters) appear in yellow, and the highest amounts (6 centimeters) appear in dark blue. Areas of missing data appear in shades of gray. The maps are based on data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on NASA&#x27;s Aqua satellite. The most noticeable pattern in the time series is the influence of seasonal temperature changes and incoming sunlight on water vapor. In the tropics, a band of extremely humid air wobbles north and south of the equator as the seasons change. This band of humidity is part of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where the easterly trade winds from each hemisphere converge and produce near-daily thunderstorms and clouds. Farther from the equator, water vapor concentrations are high in the hemisphere experiencing summer and low in the one experiencing winter. Another pattern that shows up in the time series is that water vapor amounts over land areas decrease more in winter months than adjacent ocean areas do. This is largely because air temperatures over land drop more in the winter than temperatures over the ocean. Water vapor condenses more rapidly in colder air.

As water vapor absorbs light in the visible spectral range, its absorption can be used in spectroscopic applications (such as DOAS) to determine the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. This is done operationally, e.g. from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) spectrometers on ERS (GOME) and MetOp (GOME-2). The weaker water vapor absorption lines in the blue spectral range and further into the UV up to its dissociation limit around 243 nm are mostly based on quantum mechanical calculations and are only partly confirmed by experiments.

=== Lightning generation ===
Water vapor plays a key role in lightning production in the atmosphere. From cloud physics, usually clouds are the real generators of static charge as found in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The ability of clouds to hold massive amounts of electrical energy is directly related to the amount of water vapor present in the local system.

The amount of water vapor directly controls the permittivity of the air. During times of low humidity, static discharge is quick and easy. During times of higher humidity, fewer static discharges occur. Permittivity and capacitance work hand in hand to produce the megawatt outputs of lightning.

After a cloud, for instance, has started its way to becoming a lightning generator, atmospheric water vapor acts as a substance (or insulator) that decreases the ability of the cloud to discharge its electrical energy. Over a certain amount of time, if the cloud continues to generate and store more static electricity, the barrier that was created by the atmospheric water vapor will ultimately break down from the stored electrical potential energy. This energy will be released to a local oppositely charged region, in the form of lightning. The strength of each discharge is directly related to the atmospheric permittivity, capacitance, and the source&#x27;s charge generating ability.

== Extraterrestrial ==
Water vapor is common in the Solar System and by extension, other planetary systems. Its signature has been detected in the atmospheres of the Sun, occurring in sunspots. The presence of water vapor has been detected in the atmospheres of all seven extraterrestrial planets in the Solar System, the Earth&#x27;s Moon, and the moons of other planets, although typically in only trace amounts.

Geological formations such as cryogeysers are thought to exist on the surface of several icy moons ejecting water vapor due to tidal heating and may indicate the presence of substantial quantities of subsurface water. Plumes of water vapor have been detected on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa and are similar to plumes of water vapor detected on Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus. Traces of water vapor have also been detected in the stratosphere of Titan. Water vapor has been found to be a major constituent of the atmosphere of dwarf planet, Ceres, largest object in the asteroid belt The detection was made by using the far-infrared abilities of the Herschel Space Observatory. The finding is unexpected because comets, not asteroids, are typically considered to &quot;sprout jets and plumes.&quot; According to one of the scientists, &quot;The lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids.&quot; Scientists studying Mars hypothesize that if water moves about the planet, it does so as vapor.

The brilliance of comet tails comes largely from water vapor. On approach to the Sun, the ice many comets carry sublimes to vapor. Knowing a comet&#x27;s distance from the sun, astronomers may deduce the comet&#x27;s water content from its brilliance.

Water vapor has also been confirmed outside the Solar System. Spectroscopic analysis of HD 209458 b, an extrasolar planet in the constellation Pegasus, provides the first evidence of atmospheric water vapor beyond the Solar System. A star called CW Leonis was found to have a ring of vast quantities of water vapor circling the aging, massive star. A NASA satellite designed to study chemicals in interstellar gas clouds, made the discovery with an onboard spectrometer. Most likely, &quot;the water vapor was vaporized from the surfaces of orbiting comets.&quot; Other exoplanets with evidence of water vapor include HAT-P-11b and K2-18b.

<text>Interstate 40 (I-40) is a major east–west transcontinental Interstate Highway in the southeastern and southwestern portions of the United States. At a length of , it is the third-longest Interstate Highway in the country, after I-90 and I-80. From west to east, it passes through California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina. Its western terminus is at I-15 in Barstow, California, while its eastern terminus is at a concurrency with U.S. Route 117 (US 117) and North Carolina Highway 132 (NC 132) in Wilmington, North Carolina. Major cities served by the interstate include Flagstaff, Arizona; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Amarillo, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Little Rock, Arkansas; Memphis, Nashville, and Knoxville in Tennessee; and Asheville, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Durham, Raleigh, and Wilmington in North Carolina.

I-40 begins in the Mojave Desert in California, and then proceeds through the Colorado Plateau in Arizona and the southern tip of the Rocky Mountains in New Mexico. It then traverses the Great Plains through the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma, and passes south of the Ozarks in Arkansas. The freeway crosses the Appalachian Mountains in Tennessee and North Carolina, before terminating in the Atlantic Coastal Plain near the Atlantic Ocean.

Much of the western part of I-40, from Barstow to Oklahoma City, parallels or overlays the historic U.S. Route 66. East of Oklahoma City, the route generally parallels US 64 and US 70. I-40 was established by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, and the numbering was subsequently approved on August 14, 1957, along with most of the rest of the system. The eastern terminus was initially planned to be located at I-85 in Greensboro, but the Federal Highway Administration later approved extending the route to its current eastern terminus in Wilmington. As a result, this was the last segment of I-40 to be completed upon its dedication in 1990.

I-40 is the third-longest freeway in the United States, spanning across the southern half of the country. The longest stretch of the highway is in Tennessee, and the shortest is in California. The busiest stretch of I-40 is in Knoxville, concurrent with I-75, which has an annual average daily traffic volume of more than 210,000 vehicles. The lowest traffic volumes are found on rural stretches in New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma, where the freeway carries fewer than 15,000 vehicles per day.

===California===
I-40 in California crosses through the lightly populated northern part of the Inland Empire region of the state. Its western end is in Barstow, California. Known as the Needles Freeway, it heads east from Barstow across the Mojave Desert in San Bernardino County to Needles, before it crosses the Colorado River into Arizona southwest of Kingman. I-40 covers in California. Some signs show the control city for I-40 westbound to be Los Angeles, where drivers would follow I-15 south from its western terminus in Barstow. The highway is four lanes for the entirety of its length in the state.

A sign in California showing the distance to Wilmington, North Carolina, has been stolen several times.

===Arizona===
I-40 is a main route to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, with the exits leading into Grand Canyon National Park in Williams and Flagstaff. I-40 covers in Arizona. Just west of exit 190, west of Flagstaff, is its highest elevation along I-40 in the US, as the road crosses just over at the Arizona Divide near milepost 190. I-40 also passes through the Navajo Nation, the largest Indian reservation in the US. Like California&#x27;s segment, the highway is four lanes for the entirety of its length in the state.

===New Mexico===

I-40 covers in New Mexico. As in other states it parallels or overrides the post 1937 Route 66 route through the state. Notable cities along I-40 include Gallup, Grants, Albuquerque, Santa Rosa, and Tucumcari. I-40 also travels through several Indian reservations in the western half of the state. It reaches its highest point in the state of at the Continental Divide (Campbell Pass) in western New Mexico between Gallup and Grants. The last place that I-40 tops is at the head of Tijeras Canyon east of Albuquerque at approximately .

Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas are the five states where I-40 has a speed limit of instead of the limit in California, Tennessee, and North Carolina.

===Texas===
In the west Texas panhandle area, there are several ranch roads connected directly to the Interstate. The only major city in Texas that is directly served by I-40 is Amarillo, which connects with I-27 that runs south toward Lubbock. I-40 also connects to US 287 that runs southeast to Dallas–Fort Worth and US 87/US 287 north to Dumas and then on into Oklahoma. I-40 has only one welcome center in the state, which is located in Amarillo at the exit for Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport, serving both sides of the Interstate.

===Oklahoma===

I-40 goes through the heart of the state, passing through many Oklahoma cities and towns, including Erick, Sayre, Elk City, Clinton, Weatherford, El Reno, Yukon, Oklahoma City, Del City, Midwest City, Shawnee, Okemah, Henryetta, Checotah, Sallisaw, and Roland. I-40 covers in Oklahoma.

In Downtown Oklahoma City, I-40 was rerouted south of its former alignment and a 10-lane (five in each direction) facility replaced the former I-40 Crosstown Bridge; the former I-40 alignment will be replaced with an urban boulevard currently designated as Oklahoma City Boulevard.

===Arkansas===
I-40 enters the west-central part of the state and runs for in Arkansas. The route passes through Van Buren, where it intersects the southbound I-540/US 71 to Fort Smith. The route continues east to Alma to intersect I-49 north to Fayetteville, Arkansas. Running through the Ozark Mountains, I-40 serves Ozark, Clarksville, Russellville, Morrilton, and Conway. The route turns south after Conway and enters North Little Rock, which brings high volume interchanges with I-430, I-30/US 65/US 67/US 167, and I-440/Highway 440 (AR 440). The Interstate continues east through Lonoke, Brinkley, and West Memphis on the eastside. I-40 briefly overlaps I-55 in West Memphis before it crosses the Mississippi River on the Hernando de Soto Bridge and enters Memphis, Tennessee.

===Tennessee===
The State of Tennessee has the longest segment of I-40 at . The Interstate goes through all of the three Grand Divisions of Tennessee and its three largest cities: Memphis, Nashville, and Knoxville. Jackson, Lebanon, Cookeville, Crossville, and Newport are other notable cities through which I-40 passes. Before leaving the state, I-40 enters the Great Smoky Mountains toward North Carolina.

The section of I-40 which runs between Memphis and Nashville is often referred to as the Music Highway. During reconstruction, a short section of I-40 through downtown Knoxville near the central Malfunction Junction was completely closed to traffic from May 1, 2008, and not reopened until June 12, 2009, with all traffic redirected via I-640, the northern bypass route. The redesigned section now has additional lanes in each direction, is less congested, and has fewer accidents.

===North Carolina===

In North Carolina, I-40 travels . It enters the state as a winding mountain freeway through the Great Smoky Mountains, which frequently closes due to landslides and weather conditions. It enters the state on a mostly north–south alignment, turning to a more east–west alignment upon merging with US 74 at the eastern terminus of the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway. From there, the highway passes through Asheville, Hickory, and Statesville before reaching the Piedmont Triad. Just east of the Triad City of Greensboro, North Carolina, it merges with I-85, and the two roads split again just west of the Research Triangle area, passing through Durham and Raleigh. From the Triangle to its eastern terminus in Wilmington, it once again takes a more north–south alignment.

A standard distance sign existed near the start of the westbound section of I-40 in Wilmington that indicated the distance to Barstow, California, as . In 2009, NCDOT said it would not be replaced after frequent thefts.
==History==
===Predecessors and planning===

During the colonial and westward expansion eras, a number of Native American trails existed within the vicinity of what is now Interstate 40. In 1857, an expedition led by Edward Fitzgerald Beale was tasked with establishing a trade route along the 35th parallel north from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Los Angeles. This route, which became known as Beale&#x27;s Wagon Road, was constructed by a team of about 100 men and 22 camels led by Lt. Edward Fitzgerald Beale. Completed in 1859, it is generally considered the first federal highway in the Southwestern United States. 

In the early 20th century, a number of auto trails were established by private organizations to aid motorists in traveling between major cities. Among these was the National Old Trails Road, which roughly followed the western part of present-day I-40 to Albuquerque, and the Lee Highway, which followed much of the eastern portion of the route. When the state governments established the United States Numbered Highway System in 1926, two of these most important highways, US 66 and US 70 were established within the present-day I-40 corridor. 

US 66, which followed the route from its western terminus to Oklahoma City, became arguably the most famous highway in the United States and has been recognized multiple times in popular culture. US 70, which roughly follows the remainder of the Interstate, was also one of the most important highways for east−west travelers, and was considered part of the &quot;Broadway of America&quot; highway between California and New York.

An east−west trans-continental freeway to serve the south-central United States was proposed in multiple plans throughout the 1930s and 1940s for what later became the Interstate Highway System. The general alignment for the highway that became I-40 was included in a plan released on August 2, 1947, by the Public Roads Administration of the now-defunct Federal Works Agency. The Interstate was officially authorized between Barstow and Greensboro by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which created the Interstate Highway System. The numbering was subsequently approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) on August 14, 1957, along with most of the system. 

In 1957, the California Department of Highways, the predecessor agency to the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), proposed that the route be renumbered to I-30 instead because of the already existing US 40 in the state. This route was decommissioned in the state in 1964 as a part of a major revamping of California&#x27;s overall highway numbering system. The California state government also submitted State Route 58 (SR 58) between Barstow and Bakersfield for I-40 extension potential in 1956 and 1968, but both of these requests were rejected.

From 1963 to 1966, the US government considered a plan, part of Project Plowshare, to use atomic bombs to excavate a path for I-40 through California. The project was canceled largely due to the cost of developing the explosives and due to the unavailability of a &quot;clean bomb&quot;.

===Construction===
The first sections of I-40 reused freeways that had been constructed prior to the Interstate Highway System or were under construction at the time of the authorization of the system. The first stretch in Tennessee reused a short freeway in Knoxville called the Magnolia Avenue Expressway, which was opened in two segments in 1952 and 1955. The first stretches in North Carolina were a short controlled-access sections of US 421 in Winston-Salem, and from Kernersville, constructed between 1955 and 1958. By 1957, most states had begun construction on the first sections of I-40. The stretch between Memphis and Nashville, completed on July 24, 1966, was the first major stretch of interstate highway completed in Tennessee.

On June 30, 1972, the final stretch of I-40 entirely within Arkansas, located between Clarksville and Ozark was opened; the last section to open in the state was the Hernando de Soto Bridge, which opened on August 2, 1973. The last segment in California to be completed was a short stretch in Needles, opened on August 13, 1973. The last original planned stretch of the highway in Tennessee, located east of Knoxville, was partially opened on December 20, 1974, and fully opened on September 12, 1975. The last section of I-40 in Oklahoma, a stretch near Erick near the western end of the state, opened on June 2, 1975.

In 1971, the North Carolina State Highway Commission approved a plan to extend I-40 from Research Triangle Park to I-95, a distance of , at a cost of $75 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Most of the highway would be four lanes, though six lanes were likely near Raleigh, where I-40 would extend the Beltline. Several routes were being considered, but, at the time, the most likely route would have ended north of Smithfield. When the last portion of I-40, connecting Wilmington to Raleigh, was dedicated on June 29, 1990, CBS journalist Charles Kuralt stated:

===Controversies===
In Memphis, I-40 was originally planned to pass through the city&#x27;s Overton Park, a public park. Following a public announcement of the routing, a group of community activists opposed to the routing founded an organization called Citizens to Preserve Overton Park in 1957, and collected 10,000 signatures in their support. After Secretary of Transportation John Volpe authorized the state to solicit bids for the construction of the interstate through the park in 1969, the organization filed a lawsuit, which culminated in the landmark Supreme Court ruling of &quot;Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe&quot; in 1971, which ruled that the state highway department had not adequately explored alternative routes for the interstate. This case is considered to have established the modern process of judicial review of infrastructural projects, and eventually resulted in the state rerouting the alignment of I-40 through the park onto a section of I-240 in 1981.

===Major projects===
Between May 1980 and March 1982, a major project was conducted on I-40 in Knoxville that widened the route, eliminated several interchanges, added frontage roads, and reconstructed the congestion-prone cloverleaf interchange with I-75, which had earned the nickname &quot;Malfunction Junction&quot;, into a three-level stack interchange. This was conducted as part of a larger $250 million (equivalent to $ in ) road improvement project in the Knoxville area in preparation for the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair.

Originally, I-40 was constructed through downtown Winston-Salem, and it continued to follow that route until a new urban bypass route was built. After the bypass was completed around 1992, I-40 was relocated to the new freeway. The old highway was then redesignated as Interstate 40 Business (I-40 Bus.), establishing a business route that was actually an expressway for its entire length, a rarity among business routes. Following a reconstruction, the expressway was renamed Salem Parkway and redesignated as part of US 421.

The &quot;Big I&quot; interchange in Albuquerque between I-40 and I-25 was reconstructed between 2000 and 2002 in a project that eliminated left-hand entrance ramps and added lanes. This project was given an honorable mention by the United States Department of Transportation and the FHWA for excellence in urban highway design in 2002.

The Oklahoma City Crosstown Expressway was relocated and replaced with a new wider alignment in two phases between May 2002 and October 2012. The old alignment was replaced with Oklahoma City Boulevard, and at-grade thoroughfare.

In Memphis, the cancellation of the Overton Park stretch of I-240, along with increased traffic volumes and safety hazards, rendered both interchanges with I-240 unable to effectively handle unplanned traffic patterns, thus necessitating their reconstruction. This was accomplished in three phases between January 2001 and December 2016.

A $203.7 million two-phase project dubbed &quot;SmartFix 40&quot; resulted in a complete closure of a short stretch of I-40 through Knoxville between May 1, 2008, and June 12, 2009. This was done in order to accelerate the construction timeline, and during this time, through traffic was required to use I-640. Both phases of the project won an America&#x27;s Transportation Award from AASHTO in 2008 and 2010, respectively.

===Geological difficulties===
Landslides are common in the Pigeon River Gorge section along the Tennessee and North Carolina border. Here, the roadway was cut into the slopes of several steep mountains. Accidents on the winding road are also common especially during bad weather. On October 25, 2009, I-40 was closed at the North Carolina and Tennessee border due to a landslide at milemarker 2.6 just east of the Tennessee state line. All traffic was detoured via I-26 and I-81, and non-heavy-load traffic via US 25 and US 70. The roadway was reopened on April 25, 2010, with some remaining limitations on westbound traffic.

===Major incidents===

On December 23, 1988, a tanker truck hauling liquefied propane overturned on a ramp in the interchange between I-40 and I-240 in the Midtown neighborhood of Memphis, rupturing a small hole in the front of the tank. The leaking gas ignited in a massive fireball, and the tank was propelled from the crash site into a nearby duplex apartment. The incident killed six motorists and three occupants of nearby structures, and provided momentum for the eventual reconstruction of the interchange.

The I-40 bridge disaster occurred on May 26, 2002, when a barge collided with a bridge foundation member near Webbers Falls, Oklahoma, causing a section of the I-40 bridge to plunge into the Arkansas River. Automobiles and semitrailers fell into the water, killing 14 people.

On May 11, 2021, the Hernando de Soto Bridge carrying I-40 over the Mississippi River was closed when inspectors discovered a crack on a tie girder. A subsequent investigation revealed that the crack had existed since at least May 2019, and reports later surfaced that the crack had likely existed since August 2016. An emergency contract to repair the beam was awarded six days after the closure, and the bridge reopened on July 31, 2021, to eastbound traffic, and to westbound traffic on August 2, 2021.

The highway was badly damaged during Hurricane Helene in September 2024, with the road closed in multiple locations across western North Carolina due to landslides. The worst damage was seen near North Carolina&#x27;s border with Tennessee, where a large portion of the highway was washed into the Pigeon River following a mudslide, resulting in it being indefinitely closed in both directions. On November 5, it was announced that the highway could reopen as early as the beginning of 2025.

In Oklahoma City, the designation I-440 had been given to a stretch of Interstate Highway from I-240 to US 66. It was a part of Grand Boulevard that had been built in compliance with Interstate Highway standards. In 1982, as part of Oklahoma&#x27;s &quot;Diamond Jubilee&quot;, I-44&#x27;s western terminus was moved from the I-35/I-44 junction to the Texas–Oklahoma state line via the Belle Isle Freeway (connecting I-440 with I-35); I-440, the H. E. Bailey Turnpike; and the turnpike connector road on the eastern edge of Lawton, Oklahoma. The I-440 number was dropped at the time.

<doc id="89555" wikidata="Q208320" url="?curid=89555" title="Gong">
<text>A gong is a percussion instrument originating from Southeast Asia, and used widely in Southeast Asian and East Asian musical traditions. Gongs are made of metal and are circular and flat or bowl-like in shape, and can come in various sizes. They are typically struck with a mallet. They can be played alone, giving a characteristic &quot;crashing&quot; sound, or played as part of a tuned set that produce bell-like sounds.

The earliest possible depictions of gongs is from the details on the surface of the Ngọc Lũ I bronze drum () from the Dong Son culture of northern Vietnam. It depicts what looks like seven-gong ensembles along with other instruments (including cymbals/bells and the bronze drums themselves). The oldest undisputed historical mention of gongs can be found in sixth century AD Chinese records, which mentioned it as a foreign instrument that came from a country between Tibet and Burma. The term &quot;gong&quot; () originated in the Indonesian island of Java. Scientific and archaeological research has established that Annam, Java, Burma, and Southern China were the four main gong manufacturing centres of the ancient world. The gong found its way into the Western World in the 18th century, when it was also used in the percussion section of a Western-style symphony orchestra. A form of bronze cauldron gong known as a resting bell was widely used in ancient Greece and Rome: for instance in the famous Oracle of Dodona, where disc gongs were also used.

Gongs generally fall into three types: Suspended gongs are more or less flat, circular discs of metal suspended vertically by means of a cord passed through holes near to the top rim. Bossed or nipple gongs have a raised centre boss or knob and are often suspended and played horizontally. Bowl gongs are bowl-shaped and rest on cushions. The latter may be considered a member of the bell category. Gongs are made mainly from bronze or brass, though there are many other alloys in use.

Gongs produce two distinct types of sound. A gong with a substantially flat surface vibrates in multiple modes, giving a &quot;crash&quot; rather than a tuned note. This category of gong is sometimes called a tam-tam, to distinguish it from the bossed gongs that give a tuned note. In Indonesian gamelan ensembles, some bossed gongs are deliberately made to generate an additional beat note in the range from about 1 to 5 Hz. The use of the term &quot;gong&quot; for both these types of instrument is common.

==Types==
Suspended gongs are played with hammers and are of two main types: flat faced discs, either with or without a turned edge and gongs with a raised centre boss. In general, the larger the gong, the larger and softer the hammer. In Western symphonic music, the flat faced gongs are generally referred to as tam-tams to distinguish them from their bossed counterparts. Here, the term &quot;gong&quot; is reserved for the bossed type only. The gong has been a Chinese instrument for millennia. Its first use may have been to signal peasant workers in from the fields, because some gongs are loud enough to be heard from up to away.

Large flat gongs may be &#x27;primed&#x27; by lightly hitting them before the main stroke, greatly enhancing the sound and causing the instrument to &quot;speak&quot; sooner, with a shorter delay for the sound to &quot;bloom&quot;. Keeping this priming stroke inaudible calls for a great deal of skill. The smallest suspended gongs are played with bamboo sticks or even western-style drumsticks. Contemporary and avant-garde music, where different sounds are sought, will often use friction mallets (producing squeals and harmonics), bass bows (producing long tones and high overtones), and various striking implements (wood/plastic/metal) to produce the desired tones.

Rock gongs are large stones struck with smaller stones to create a metallic resonating sound.

== Traditional suspended gongs ==

=== Chau gong (tam-tam) ===

By far the most familiar to most Westerners is the &quot;chau gong&quot; or &quot;bullseye gong&quot;. Large chau gongs, called &quot;tam-tams&quot; have become part of the symphony orchestra. Sometimes a chau gong is referred to as a &quot;Chinese gong&quot;, but in fact, it is only one of many types of suspended gongs that are associated with China. A chau gong is made of copper-based alloy, bronze, or brass. It is almost flat except for the rim, which is turned up to make a shallow cylinder. On a gong, for example, the rim extends about perpendicular to the surface. The main surface is slightly concave when viewed from the direction to which the rim is turned. The centre spot and rim of a chau gong are left coated on both sides with the black copper oxide that forms during manufacture; the rest is polished to remove this coating. Chau gongs range in size from in diameter.
====History====

The earliest Chau gong is from a tomb discovered at the Guixian site in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China. It dates from the early Western Han dynasty. Gongs are depicted in Chinese visual art as of the 6th century CE, and were known for their very intense and spiritual drumming in rituals and tribal meetings. Traditionally, chau gongs were used to clear the way for important officials and processions, much like a police siren today. Sometimes the number of strokes was used to indicate the seniority of the official. In this way, two officials meeting unexpectedly on the road would know before the meeting which of them should bow down before the other.

==== Use in symphony orchestras ====
The tam-tam was first introduced as an orchestral instrument by François-Joseph Gossec in 1790, and it was also taken up by Gaspare Spontini and Jean-François Le Sueur. Hector Berlioz deployed the instrument throughout his compositional career, and in his &quot;Treatise on Instrumentation&quot; he recommended its use &quot;for scenes of mourning or for the dramatic depiction of extreme horror.&quot; Other composers who adopted the tam-tam in the opera house included Gioachino Rossini, Vincenzo Bellini, and Richard Wagner: Rossini in the final of act 3 of &quot;Armida&quot; (1817), Bellini in &quot;Norma&quot; (1831) and Wagner in &quot;Rienzi&quot; (1842). Within a few decades the tam-tam became an important member of the percussion section of a modern symphony orchestra. It figures prominently in the symphonies of Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Gustav Mahler, Dmitri Shostakovich and, to a lesser extent, Sergei Rachmaninov and Sergei Prokofiev. Giacomo Puccini used gongs and tam-tams in his operas. Igor Stravinsky greatly expanded the playing techniques of the tam-tam in his The Rite Of Spring to include short, quickly damped notes, quick crescendos, and a triangle beater scraped across the front of the instrument. Karlheinz Stockhausen used a 60&quot; Paiste tam-tam in his &quot;Momente&quot;.

=== Dora ===
A dora is one of the Japanese Percussion instruments and an idiophone. It is made of bronze, brass or iron, and is suspended onto a dora stand. It is widely used in Buddhist memorial services, hayashi performances, kabuki music, and ship departure signals.

=== Nipple gong ===
A nipple gong has a central raised boss or nipple, often made of different metals than other gongs with varying degrees of quality and resonance. They have a tone with less shimmer than other gongs, and two distinct sounds depending on whether they are struck on the boss or next to it. They are most often but not always tuned to various pitches.

Nipple gongs range in size from or larger. Sets of smaller, tuned nipple gongs can be used to play a melody.

Nipple gongs are used in Chinese temples for worship and Buddhist temples in Southeast Asia.

These are the primary gong in the traditional Philippine music of kulintang.

In Indonesian gamelan ensembles, instruments that are organologically gongs come in various sizes with different functions and different names. For example, in the central Javanese gamelan, the largest gong is called &quot;gong ageng&quot;, ranges in size up to 1 meter in diameter, has the deepest pitch and is played least often; the next smaller gong is the &quot;gong suwukan&quot; or &quot;siyem&quot;, has a slightly higher pitch and replaces the &quot;gong ageng&quot; in pieces where gong strokes are close together; the &quot;kempul&quot; is smaller still, has a higher pitch, and is played more frequently. The &quot;gong ageng&quot; and some &quot;gong suwukan&quot; have a beat note.

=== Opera gongs ===

An essential part of the orchestra for Chinese opera is a pair of gongs, the larger with a descending tone, the smaller with a rising tone. The larger gong is used to announce the entrance of major players or men and to identify points of drama and consequence. The smaller gong is used to announce the entry of lesser players or women and to identify points of humour.

Opera gongs range in size from , with the larger of a pair larger than the smaller.

=== Pasi gongs ===
A Pasi gong is a medium-size gong in size, with a loud crashing sound. It is used traditionally to announce the start of a performance, play or magic. Construction varies, some having nipples and some not, so this type is named more for its function than for its structure or even its sound.

Pasi gongs without nipples have found favour with adventurous middle-of-the-road kit drummers.

=== Tiger gong ===
A tiger gong is a slightly descending or less commonly ascending gong, larger than an opera gong and with a less pronounced pitch shift. Most commonly but available down to .

=== Shueng Kwong ===
A Shueng Kwong gong is a medium to large gong with a sharp staccato sound.

=== Wind gong ===
Wind gongs (also known as Feng or Lion Gongs) are flat bronze discs, with little fundamental pitch, heavy tuned overtones, and long sustain. They are most commonly made of B20 bronze, but can also be made of M63 brass or NS12 nickel-silver. Traditionally, a wind gong is played with a large soft mallet, which gives it a roaring crash to match their namesake. They are lathed on both sides and are medium to large in size, typically but sizes from are available. The size is most popular due to its portability and large sound.

They are commonly used by drummers in rock music. Played with a nylon tip drumstick they sound rather like the coil chimes in a mantle clock. Some have holes in the centre, but they are mounted like all suspended gongs by other holes near the rim. The smaller sizes, , have a more bell-like tone due to their thickness and small diameter.

=== Sculptural gongs ===

Sculptural gongs (also known as Gong Sculptures) are gongs which serve the dual purpose of being a musical instrument and a work of visual art. They are generally not disc shaped, but instead take more complex, even abstract forms. Sculptural gongs were pioneered in the early 1990s by Welsh percussionist and metal crafter, Steve Hubback, who was partially inspired by the work of the French Sound Sculptors, Francois and Bernard Baschet.

Hubback&#x27;s works have been used by many musicians including solo percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie and rock drummer Carl Palmer.

English gong and cymbal maker, Matt Nolan, partially inspired by the work of Hubback, also creates sculptural gongs of his own design or to private commission.

UK based sculptor Barry Mason makes gongs in titanium and other elemental metals.

== Other uses ==
In older Javanese usage and in modern Balinese usage, gong is used to identify an ensemble of instruments. In contemporary central Javanese usage, the term gamelan is preferred and the term gong is reserved for the gong ageng, the largest instrument of the type, or for surrogate instruments such as the &quot;gong komodong&quot; or &quot;gong bumbung&quot; (blown gong) which fill the same musical function in ensembles lacking the large gong. In Balinese usage, gong refers to Gamelan Gong Kebyar.

== Gong manufacturers ==

Besides many traditional and centuries old manufacturers all around China, including Tibet, as well as Burma, Java and Annam gongs have also been made in Europe and America since the 20th century.

Paiste is the largest non-Asian manufacturer of gongs. This Swiss company of Estonian lineage makes gongs at their German factory. Also in Germany, Oetken Gongs, founded in 2011 by Broder Oetken-former Paiste gong master-offers his own range of gongs. He also built the first generation of Symphonic and Planetary gongs for Meinl . Italian company UFIP make a range of gongs at their factory in Pistoia. Michael Paiste, outside of the larger family business, makes gongs independently in Lucerne, Switzerland. Other independent gong manufacturers in Europe include Welshman Steve Hubback, currently based in the Netherlands; Matt Nolan and Michal Milas in the UK; Barry Mason in the UK; and Joao Pais-Filipe in Portugal.

In North America, Sabian make a small number of gongs and Zildjian sell Zildjian-branded gongs which have in the past been made by Zildjian, but current production looks to be Chinese in origin. Ryan Shelledy is an independent gong maker based in the Midwestern United States.

Some of the smaller Turkish cymbal companies have also been seen to dabble in gongs but very much as a sideline to their core business of hand-hammered cymbals.

== Materials and size ==

Gongs vary in diameter from about . They are made of a bronze alloy composed of a maximum of 22 parts tin to 78 parts copper, but in many cases the proportion of tin is considerably less. This alloy is excessively brittle when cast and allowed to cool slowly, but it can be tempered and annealed in a peculiar manner to alleviate this. When suddenly cooled from red heat, the alloy becomes so soft that it can be hammered and worked on the lathe then hardened by reheating. Afterwards, the gong has all of the qualities and timbre of the Chinese instruments. The composition of the alloy of bronze used for making gongs is stated to be as follows: 76.52% Cu, 22.43% Sn, 0.26% Pb, 0.23% Zn, 0.81% Fe. In Turkish Cymbal making there is also sulfur and silicon in the alloy.

Turkish Cymbals and Gamelan Gongs share beta phase bronze as a metallurgical roots. Tin and copper mix phase transition graphs show a very narrow up-down triangle at 21–24% tin content and symbolized by β. This is the secret of all past bronze instrument making. When bronze is mixed and heated, it glows orange-red which indicates it has been heated to the beta phase borders where the metal needs to be submerged in cold water to lock the alloy in the beta phase for cymbal making. The gong is then beaten with a round, hard, leather-covered pad that is fitted on a short stick or handle. It emits a peculiarly sonorous sound which can be varied by particular ways of striking the disk. Its complex vibrations burst into a wave-like succession of tones that can be either shrill or deep. In China and Japan gongs are used in religious ceremonies, state processions, marriages and other festivals.

==Orchestral usage==
The gong has been used in the orchestra to intensify the impression of fear and horror in melodramatic scenes and usually, but not exclusively, players interpret the term to call for a tam-tam, as noted above. The tam-tam was first introduced into a western orchestra by François-Joseph Gossec in the funeral march composed at the death of Mirabeau in 1791. Gaspare Spontini used the tam-tam in &quot;La Vestale&#x27;s&quot; (1807) Act II finale. Berlioz called for four tam-tams in his &quot;Grande Messe des morts&quot; of 1837. The tam-tam was also used in the funeral music played when the remains of Napoleon were brought back to France in 1840. Meyerbeer made use of the instrument in the scene of the resurrection of the three nuns in &quot;Robert le diable.&quot; Four tam-tams are used at Bayreuth in &quot;Parsifal&quot; to reinforce the bell instruments although there is no indication given in the score. In more modern music, the tam-tam has been used by composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen in &quot;Mikrophonie I&quot; (1964–65) and by George Crumb. In &quot;Makrokosmos III: Music For A Summer Evening&quot; (1974), Crumb expanded the timbral range of the tam-tam by giving performance directions such as using a &quot;well-rosined contrabass bow&quot; to bow the tam-tam. This produced an eerie harmonic sound. Stockhausen created more interesting sounds using hand-held microphones and a wide range of scraping, tapping, rubbing, and beating techniques with unconventional implements such as plastic dishes, egg timers, and cardboard tubes. Gongs can also be immersed into a tub of water after being struck. This is called &quot;water gong&quot; and is called for in several orchestral pieces.

Tuned gongs have also been used with the symphony orchestra, e.g. sets of differently tuned gongs used by Messiaen in pieces such as &quot;Des canyons aux étoiles&quot; and &quot;Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum&quot;.

== Signal gongs ==
Gongs are also used as signal devices in a number of applications.

=== Boxing (sport) ===
A bowl-shaped, center mounted, electrically controlled gong is standard equipment in a boxing ring. Commonly referred to as &quot;the gong&quot;, it is struck with a hammer to signal the start and end of each round.

=== Dinner gong ===

During the Victorian and Edwardian eras, it was often the custom in hotels, on ships and in large, upper-class houses to sound a &quot;dinner gong&quot; to announce a meal was about to be served.

=== Rail crossing ===
A railroad crossing with a flashing traffic signal or wigwag will also typically have a warning bell. Mechanical bells, known in some places as a gong, are struck by an electric-powered hammer to audibly warn motorists and pedestrians of an oncoming train. Many railroad crossing gongs are now being replaced by electronic devices with no moving parts.

=== Railcar mounted ===
Gongs are present on rail vehicles, such as trams, streetcars, trains, cable cars or light rail trains, in the form of a bowl-shaped signal bell typically mounted on the front of the leading car. It was designed to be sounded to act as a warning in areas where whistles and horns are prohibited, and the &quot;&quot;clang&quot; of the trolley&quot; refers to this sound. Traditionally, the gong was operated by a foot pedal, but is nowadays controlled by a button mounted on the driving panel. Early trams had a smaller gong with a bell pull mounted by the rear door of these railcars. This was operated by the conductor to notify the driver that it is safe to proceed.

=== Shipping ===
A vessel over in length must carry a gong in addition to a bell and whistle, the volume of which is defined in the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. A vessel at anchor or aground sounds the gong in the stern immediately after ringing a bell in her bows so as to indicate her length.

=== Theater ===
Electromechanical, electromagnetic or electronic devices producing the sound of gongs have been installed in theatres (particularly those in the Czech Republic) to gather the audience from the lounge to the auditorium before the show begins or proceeds after interlude.

=== Time signal ===
German radio stations use a gong sound for the time signal.

=== Vehicle mounted ===
In the Commonwealth, emergency vehicles were fitted with electric, manual, or vacuum operated Winkworth bell gongs in the time before Martin&#x27;s horns became available or rotary sirens came into use

<text>Amon Adonai Santos de Araújo Tobin (; born February 7, 1972) is a Brazilian electronic musician, composer and producer. He is noted for his unusual methodology in sound design and music production. He has released eight major studio albums under the London-based Ninja Tune record label. He has also released two albums under the alias Two Fingers with collaborator Doubleclick. His latest release, &quot;Nomark Selects V.1&quot;, was released on April 28, 2023.

His music has been used in numerous major motion pictures including &quot;The Italian Job&quot; and &quot;21&quot;. Tobin has created songs for several independent films, including the 2006 Hungarian film &quot;Taxidermia&quot;, and had his music used in other independent films, including the 2002 &quot;Cannes Palme d&#x27;Or–&quot;nominated &quot;Divine Intervention&quot;. A selection of his tracks were featured in commercial bumps on Toonami and in the 2005 anime &quot;IGPX&quot;, and he produced the musical scores to critically acclaimed video games &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory&quot; by Ubisoft in 2005, and Sucker Punch&#x27;s &quot;Infamous&quot; in 2009.

==Biography==
===Early career (1995–1997)===
Tobin was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Tobin&#x27;s father is Irish. At the age of 2, he and his family left Brazil to live in Morocco, the Netherlands, London, Portugal and Madeira. Tobin settled in Brighton, England as a teenager which remained his permanent residence until 2002. There he began producing electronic music in his bedroom with samplers and other audio equipment including an Amstrad Studio 100 4-track, although he was &quot;not really involved in the [music] scene&quot; at that time. While taking an editorial photography class at a university in Brighton, he responded to a magazine promotion for the London-based Ninebar record label asking artists to send in demos of their songs. Ninebar signed Tobin to the label in 1996 after hearing his early work, and he traveled between his home in Brighton and the studios in London to produce his first official works.

Under his original moniker Cujo (in Portuguese, the word for &quot;whose&quot;), he released a series of original compositions on 12-inch vinyl. AllMusic called them &quot;head-turning&quot; in a review. Many of those tracks were later included on his first full-length album &quot;Adventures in Foam&quot;, originally released in 1996 by Ninebar to a limited release of 5,000 copies.

The larger Ninja Tune record label had been growing in the United Kingdom at the time with help from artists DJ Food, Funki Porcini, The Herbaliser, and Coldcut. DJ Food and Funki Porcini noticed Tobin&#x27;s work on &quot;Adventures in Foam&quot; and prompted the label to approach him. Ninja Tune signed Tobin in late 1996, this time under his abbreviated name &quot;Amon Tobin&quot;. The official Ninja Tune website has said that &quot;Adventures in Foam&quot; had been re-released without permission by the US-based Shadow Records that same year and that this unauthorized version, labeled the &quot;US release&quot;, included only 7 of the original songs, different cover art, and that some tracks were titled incorrectly. In 1997 Ninja Tune acquired the proper licenses from Ninebar and re-released the album themselves. This version included the original album in its entirety, and a second disc containing previously unreleased material. , copies of Shadow Record&#x27;s &quot;US version&quot; are sold by online retailer Amazon.com. Over the course of its production, &quot;Adventures in Foam&quot; has been reviewed favorably. Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork Media said that its break-beat style &quot;got totally out of hand&quot;, but that it &quot;never fails to let the listener know who&#x27;s in charge.&quot; The album was released for a fourth time in 2002, again by Ninja Tune.

===&quot;Bricolage&quot;, &quot;Permutation&quot; and &quot;Supermodified&quot; (1997–2002)===
Over the next several years, Tobin released three albums. &quot;Bricolage&quot;, released in 1997, was the culmination of two projects Tobin had started after his debut album earlier that year. His third album &quot;Permutation&quot; was released in 1998. In the late 1990s, sample-based music was becoming more popular with a wide range of emerging and developing genres, but Tobin himself was still largely unknown. Tobin&#x27;s style of music was not seen as definitively belonging to one genre or another. The critics that commented on &quot;Bricolage&quot; and &quot;Permutation&quot; gave them positive reviews and they are often mentioned, by later reviewers and interviewers, as classic albums of the time. Pitchfork acclaimed the use of jazz instrument samples, comparing him to famous composers Quincy Jones and Miles Davis. In a 1999 review, they awarded &quot;Bricolage&quot; a very rare 10/10 and said that it was &quot;one of the most inventive records of the decade.&quot;

Tobin released his fourth album, &quot;Supermodified&quot; in 2000. The album is regarded as his most commercial album to date. Critic reviews were generally positive, with Pitchfork rating the album 9.1/10, and Stylus Magazine saying, &quot;Not many studio-bound electronic musicians could put forward such a vivid and dynamic statement or make it as entertaining and downright funky as &quot;Supermodified&quot; has managed to do.&quot;

===&quot;Out From Out Where&quot;, &quot;Chaos Theory&quot; and &quot;Foley Room&quot; (2002–2008)===

In 2002, Tobin relocated to Montreal, Quebec, Canada where he had spent time previously at Ninja Tune&#x27;s North American Headquarters. Tobin lived in the industrial area of Old Montreal to avoid noise complaints from neighbors after dark. There he produced his fifth album &quot;Out From Out Where&quot; released that same year. This was his first album created primarily in a professional studio. He later released a single, &quot;Verbal&quot;, taken from Out From Out Where. Otis Hart of &quot;Dusted Magazine&quot; said that Tobin&#x27;s style of producing had come into its own. He acclaimed Tobin&#x27;s &quot;refined sense of tempo&quot;.

In January 2004, Tobin was contracted by video game company Ubisoft Montreal to compose the soundtrack for the third installment of their critically successful Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell series, &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory&quot;. To facilitate using the music in a video game, where the level of action or plot can change in real-time, each track was broken down by Tobin into four distinct but similar parts based on their level of intensity. The game&#x27;s developers could then use each section to provide music based on the actions of the player. Despite not being an official album in Tobin&#x27;s discography, it was considered a ground breaking work in the world of video game sound tracks described as &quot;an entirely new era of media&quot; by Tiny Mix Tapes.

The album continued the trend Tobin started with &quot;Out From Out Where&quot;, as he used more field recordings during production. In addition to being included with the game, Ninja Tune released the score as an individual album in 2005, titled &quot;Chaos Theory – Splinter Cell 3 Soundtrack&quot;, several months before the game&#x27;s release. It was received well, benefiting from a wider audience of reviewers in both the music and gaming industries. Ben Hogwood of MusicOMH.com applauded Tobin&#x27;s use of melody and texture, adding that he controlled the sounds with the &quot;clarity of a classical orchestrator.&quot; He later recorded a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound version of the album with audio engineer Bobby Azinsky in a dedicated Solid State Logic studio in Los Angeles.

Tobin&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Foley Room&quot;, was released in 2007. The title alludes to the &quot;Foley rooms&quot; used by recording engineers and Foley artists to record sound effects in the movie industry. On this album, Tobin concluded his transition away from prerecorded source material that started with &quot;Out From Out Where&quot;. All of the samples used for production were recorded by himself using an omnidirectional microphone. Recorded primarily in Montreal, San Francisco, and Seattle, the samples came from a wide range of sources including motorbikes, tigers, insects, and water falling from a tap. Also contributing to the album were the string quartet Kronos Quartet, drummer Stefan Schneider, and harpist Sarah Pagé. &quot;Foley Room&quot;″s use of field-recordings was used to help promote the album, including two official pre-release trailers posted to YouTube. Nate Dorr of PopMatters.com called it a &quot;smooth, natural progression&quot; from his work on &quot;Supermodified&quot;. The first single, &quot;Bloodstone&quot;, was released to the iTunes Music Store months before the rest of the album. Ninja Tune also published a DVD titled &quot;Foley Room: Found Footage&quot; which documented the recording process.

=== &quot;ISAM&quot; and Two Fingers (2009–2018) ===
In 2006, Tobin began collaborating on a hip-hop oriented project with British drum-and-bass producer Doubleclick and a number of guest vocalists. As Two Fingers, the pair have released several singles, followed by their self-titled debut album in 2009. The eponymous release came out in 2009 on Paper Bag Records in North America and Big Dada in the United Kingdom. The two producers, who first met when Tobin was living in Brighton, U.K., got together in Montreal in 2007 over a series of tracks that were partially an extension of their previous collaborations — exemplified by the dense, pummeling 2003 track &quot;Ownage&quot; — but in general, a fundamentally new and dynamic direction incorporating visceral elements of dancehall, dubstep, and grime. Following the singles &quot;That Girl&quot; and &quot;What You Know,&quot; the group&#x27;s self-titled debut was released in spring 2009, featuring vocals from dancehall star Ce&#x27;Cile, Ms. Jade, and, on seven of the album&#x27;s 12 tracks, British rapper Sway. In 2009, Tobin also collaborated with the UK drum-and-bass artist Dom &amp; Roland on a track titled “Sylo” for the album &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;.

In 2008, Tobin announced he was working on a new video game soundtrack for an &quot;undisclosed PS3 title&quot;. This was later revealed to be the PlayStation 3 exclusive game, &quot;inFamous&quot;, and in 2010, Tobin announced that he would be working on the music for &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Conviction&quot;. Recent works include &quot;Hey Mr. Tree&quot; as a &#x27;Bonus Joint&#x27; to accompany his earlier &#x27;Monthly Joint&#x27; collection, a remix of Noisia&#x27;s &quot;Machine Gun&quot; released alongside remixes by 16 Bit and Spor, and a collaboration with ESKMO dubbed Eskamon. Eskamon has released a single &quot;Fine Objects&quot;.

In January 2011, his artist page was updated on Ninja Tune website, announcing a new album entitled &quot;ISAM&quot;, as well as a &quot;Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory&quot; remix album. After being leaked by a journalist, &quot;ISAM&quot; was released on April 20, 2011. As its extension, in May 2012, Tobin released the &quot;Boxset&quot;, prominent of its form of a mechanical press. As a set of 15 different physical carriers, it contains remixes, cover versions and re-interpretations of tracks from &quot;ISAM&quot;, along with Tobin&#x27;s earliest audio experiments, film and television scores, as well as deleted bootlegs.

The second album under Two Fingers, &quot;Stunt Rhythms&quot;, was a solo effort by Amon Tobin and was designed by Inventory Studio and released worldwide by Big Dada Recordings in 2012.

On April 18, 2015, Amon Tobin announced &quot;Dark Jovian,&quot; an EP, and his first release under his name in four years.

=== Nomark Records and new aliases (2019–present) ===
In February 2019, Amon Tobin&#x27;s website announced a new album, &quot;Fear in a Handful of Dust&quot;, to be released in April 2019 on a new label, Nomark Records. The album&#x27;s release on April 26, 2019, marked the end of a 8 year long hiatus in new studio LP album releases under Tobin&#x27;s name (his previous release being ISAM in 2011). Throughout the remainder of 2019, Tobin would also release three singles under his Two Fingers alias: &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Down&quot;, &quot;296 Rhythm&quot;, and &quot;LED Moon Rhythm.&quot; On July 26, 2019, Tobin released the album &quot;Time to Run&quot; under a new alias known as Only Child Tyrant.

In September 2019, Tobin announced the Nomark Club, an annual subscription service that grants access to all of Tobin&#x27;s material as it is released, including some member-exclusive content (the material is delivered via Bandcamp&#x27;s subscription service). A supporter-exclusive extended play album titled &quot;Fine Strips of Violence&quot; was released in tandem with the announcement. &quot;Long Stories,&quot; which arrived October 2019, was made in parallel with &quot;Fear in a Handful of Dust&quot; and features prominent use of a broken Omnichord. In December 2019, Tobin released a two-track Nomark Club-exclusive album titled &quot;Nine Bars Back&quot; under the alias of Cujo—one that had not been used since the release of &quot;Adventures in Foam&quot; in 1996.

Tobin released &quot;The World As We Know It&quot; in July 2020 under the alias Figueroa, which marked a departure in Tobin&#x27;s usual instrumental style, as it was his first major release to feature prominent vocal work. The album&#x27;s lyrics were performed by Tobin himself with technical guidance from producer Sylvia Massy. Tobin describes the lyrics as being rather ambiguous, stating in an interview that &quot;I want the feeling of the songs to be the priority, rather than the specific meaning.&quot; &quot;West Coast Love Stories&quot;, the debut album by new alias Stone Giants, &quot;celebrates the relationship between voice and machine from an altogether different perspective - humans and electronics pooling resources to explore themes of love and being none the wiser for it.&quot;

The &quot;cinematic and apocalyptic&quot; &quot;How Do You Live&quot;, released under Tobin&#x27;s name, arrived in September 2021. In February 2021, Tobin was announced to be involved in the soundtracking of the Meow Wolf Omega Mart installation, along with Beach House, Brian Eno, Santigold, and others. Tobin&#x27;s soundtrack to the installation, &quot;A Living Room (Music from Meow Wolf&#x27;s Omega Mart)&quot; was released on September 23, 2022, on his Nomark Records label as a single-sided vinyl record with an etching on the reverse. As Two Fingers, a trio of collaborative singles with the German producer Muadeep came out in 2022: &quot;Blood Moon, Banished,&quot; and &quot;Lost Gods&quot;, leading to the trio&#x27;s album &quot;Cronos&quot;. Also in 2022, the Only Child Tyrant alias released a pair of singles: &quot;HoneyCup Troll&quot; and &quot;Make Better Friends&quot;. In 2023, the Nomark Records label released the &quot;Nomark Selects V.1&quot; compilation album, an album that contained singles hand-picked by the Nomark Club members.

==Musical style and influences==
Tobin is best known for his use of audio manipulation techniques, where any given source material is transformed to produce a new sound. His use of this technique has changed over the course of his career. On his original singles under Ninebar and his first three albums, Tobin acquired all of the sound sources to produce music from his personal collection of vinyl records. He manipulates the sounds with a combination of audio hardware and software including Cubase, often leaving the original source unrecognizable in its new context. The majority of his early work focused on reordering the break beats from jazz and blues music into faster more complex patterns. Guido Farnell of InTheMix.com, wrote about his use of this technique, saying that Tobin has &quot;taken the art to new and dizzying heights.&quot;

His fifth album &quot;Out From Out Where&quot; began the gradual shift away from prerecorded material by incorporating original guitar samples. His techniques began branching into technical sound design, taking break beats or single instruments, modifying specific frequencies, and producing new sounds. This trend continued through his video game score &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory Soundtrack&quot;, and by his sixth album, &quot;Foley Room&quot;, all of the source material was recorded in the field by himself. Speaking about the creativity of sample-based music compared to traditional instruments, he says that &quot;creative input is not determined by your source material but in how you edit and manipulate the sounds.&quot;

Tobin experimented with various instruments. He does not come from a music family, nor has he had any formal training in music theory. About his music in general, Tobin says that he sees it as a &quot;genuine&quot; expression of the time he lives in, as he says that by contrast, blues, jazz, and Brazilian genres were &quot;genuine&quot; expressions of the 1960s.

Despite his indirect connection with Brazilian genres, Tobin collaborated with a number of artists on Bebel Gilberto&#x27;s 2000 bossa nova album &quot;Tanto Tempo&quot;. Tobin&#x27;s albums are often compared to soundtracks, and he says that movies by David Lynch have influenced him. In addition, he has stated to like films by the Coen brothers, Dario Argento, and Roman Polanski.

==Live performances==
Tobin began performing live shows in clubs with other Ninja Tune artists after releasing his second album, &quot;Bricolage&quot;. His shows generally contained music that he had produced during his career, mixed with modified songs from drum and bass, hip-hop, or other genres. Because his music was entirely produced in a studio with electronics, Tobin was not interested in adapting his music to suit a Live PA incorporating musicians. He instead used turntables which he felt had more in common with his approach to music production. He is known for building Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound speaker systems for his performances.

In 2011, Tobin developed a live show in support of the album ISAM, fitting his criteria for a performance that is both live and purely electronic. He told Wired Magazine &quot;The idea was to integrate myself, quite literally, into an audio and visual presentation of the album,&quot;. It incorporates the use of new video mapping techniques that are projected onto a large cubic structure from which Tobin performs. The show has been met with international acclaim described by Vice Magazine&#x27;s Creators Project as &quot;revolutionizing the live music experience&quot;.

Tobin has performed individual shows in many countries including tours in Europe, Australia, Japan, and the United States. His 2003 live performance in Melbourne, Australia was used for the fourth album in Ninja Tune&#x27;s Solid Steel series because Tobin was not available to record a studio mix at the time. Many songs from the original recording were omitted because of copyright issues with the original artists, including the R&amp;B group Destiny&#x27;s Child.

A second Solid Steel album &quot;Foley Room Recorded Live in Brussels&quot; was recorded in Brussels at the Ancienne Belgique in 2007, and was released for free in November 2008. According to Tobin&#x27;s official website, &quot;After months of back and forth and despite everyone&#x27;s best efforts the mix was in danger of being edited into the ground to accommodate big labels and publishers. Rather than release a compromised version commercially, the decision was made to give it away for free instead.&quot;

== Film work and soundtracks ==
Amon Tobin&#x27;s sounds and samples are frequently used in the British car-based TV show &quot;Top Gear&quot;, and his song &quot;Four Ton Mantis&quot; has been used in advertisements for Nissan Qashqai and Juke. Tobin&#x27;s music also appeared in several major motion pictures including &quot;The Italian Job&quot;, &quot;Tideline (Littoral)&quot; and &quot;21&quot;. He has also produced tracks for a number of independent films, including &quot;The Last Minute&quot;, and has created production music for the BMG Zomba commercial library which is used in various films. In 2006, he scored the soundtrack for the Hungarian horror film &quot;Taxidermia&quot; which was made available on his website. He also produced the score for the 2009 documentary &quot;Pax Americana and the Weaponization of Space&quot;.

In April 2010, Tobin composed and produced a small body of work for the video game &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Conviction&quot; which was available for streaming on his website. In 2013, Two Fingers composed the theme music for the BBC America/Space original series &quot;Orphan Black&quot;.
