<text>Sven-Göran Eriksson (; 5 February 1948 – 26 August 2024) was a Swedish football player and manager.

After a playing career as a right-back, Eriksson went on to experience major success in club management between 1977 and 2001, winning 18 trophies with a variety of league clubs in Sweden, Portugal, and Italy. In European competition, he won the UEFA Cup, the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup (the last edition of that trophy before its abolition), the UEFA Super Cup, and reached the final of the European Cup.

Eriksson later managed the national teams of England, Mexico, the Philippines and the Ivory Coast, as well as Manchester City and Leicester City in England. Eriksson coached in ten countries: Sweden, Portugal, Italy, England, Mexico, Ivory Coast, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, China and the Philippines.

==Early life==
Sven-Göran Eriksson was born on 5 February 1948 in Sunne and raised in Torsby, both in Värmland, Sweden. His father, also named Sven (born 1928), was a bus conductor whilst his mother, Ulla (1926–2011), worked in a textile store. He was nicknamed &quot;Svennis&quot; after his younger brother Lars-Erik&#x27;s attempt to pronounce his name; Eriksson went on to become known, and is generally referred to in Sweden mononymously, by this nickname.

==Playing career==
Eriksson made his debut for Swedish football Division 4 team Torsby IF at the age of 16. He switched clubs to SK Sifhälla after moving to Säffle to study economics. In 1972, he joined Swedish football Division 2 team KB Karlskoga, where he also worked as a physical education teacher in Örebro.

Eriksson was heavily influenced by Karlskoga&#x27;s player-manager, Tord Grip, who favoured the English style of play that Bob Houghton and Roy Hodgson had brought to the country. Eriksson retired from playing in 1975 at the age of 27, after giving up on his dream of playing professional football; he summed up his brief playing career by saying: &quot;I was looked upon as a distinctly average defender, but someone who rarely made mistakes&quot;.

==Managerial career==

===Degerfors IF===
Having retired as a player, Eriksson received an offer to become Tord Grip&#x27;s assistant at Degerfors IF. A year later, Grip was appointed assistant manager of the Sweden national team, and Eriksson became Degerfors&#x27; manager. His stint as manager lasted from 1 January 1977 to 31 December 1978. He led the team to the playoffs in 1977 and 1978, winning the latter and promotion to Swedish Football Division 2.

===IFK Göteborg===
Eriksson&#x27;s success with assistant manager Tom Chadney by his side attracted the attention of much larger clubs, and Eriksson was appointed manager of IFK Göteborg on 1 January 1979. The move was such a surprise that many of the players had never even heard of him.

IFK finished second in the Allsvenskan and won the Svenska Cupen for the first time in the club&#x27;s history, defeating Åtvidabergs FF 6–1 in the final. Although results had improved, the team&#x27;s style did not make him popular. He put results ahead of flair, emphasised tactical awareness and work rate, and he reined in the team&#x27;s old cavalier style.

As a consequence, the average attendance fell by 3,000 to 13,320. Like Grip, he was influenced by Houghton and Hodgson and played a 4–4–2 with zonal marking and heavy pressing. IFK finished third in the 1980 season and second again in 1981. The following season, they won the treble. The team won the League and subsequent playoff, the Svenska Cupen, defeating Östers IF 3–2 in the final.

Eriksson&#x27;s international breakthrough came during the spring of 1982, when he led IFK to the first ever UEFA Cup for a Swedish club, defeating Valencia in the quarter-finals and Kaiserslautern in the semi-finals. In the final they played Hamburger SV over two legs. In the first leg at home, IFK managed to score a late deciding goal, and took a 1–0 score with them to the away fixture. In Hamburg, they won 3–0 and thus won the 1981–82 UEFA Cup by an aggregate score of 4–0.

===Benfica===
Eriksson&#x27;s European success led to him being recruited by Portuguese club Benfica, which he joined in end of June. Eriksson&#x27;s influence was immediate, winning the Primeira Divisão, the Taça de Portugal and finishing runners-up in the 1982–83 UEFA Cup to Anderlecht. After winning a second consecutive league title, Eriksson then moved on to Italy, becoming manager of Roma.

===Roma===
Eriksson joined Roma on 1 July 1984. He was not as immediately successful at the &quot;Giallorossi&quot; as he had been before, but nonetheless still won a Coppa Italia with the club in 1986. Eriksson left the club on 6 May 1987.

===Fiorentina and return to Benfica===
Eriksson was manager of Fiorentina from 1 July 1987. Eriksson&#x27;s stint with the club was trophyless, and he moved back to Benfica for a second stint in 1989. Eriksson led the Portuguese side to the final of the 1989–90 European Cup (losing to Milan 1–0) in 1990, and another Primeira Divisão title in 1991.

===Sampdoria===
In July 1992, Eriksson returned to Italy to lead Sampdoria, where he managed to win another Coppa Italia in 1994. In contrast to his predecessor, Vujadin Boškov, he introduced a defensive system which was based on zonal marking rather than man-marking. He left in June 1997.

===Lazio===
In December 1996, Eriksson agreed to leave Sampdoria at the end of the season to manage Blackburn Rovers. In February 1997, however, he went back on his word, and opted to stay in Italy and become the new manager at Lazio, beginning on 1 July 1997. Eriksson stated family reasons for wanting to stay in Italy, and Rovers would go on to appoint Roy Hodgson.

Eriksson employed fellow Swede Tord Grip as his assistant. Eriksson won the Coppa Italia and the Supercoppa Italiana in both 1998 and 2000, the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup (1999, its final edition), the 1999 UEFA Super Cup against recently treble-winning Manchester United, and the Serie A title (the &quot;Scudetto&quot;) in 2000 – only the second time that the Roman club had won the Italian championship in their history.

Eriksson had signed in October 2000 to be the new manager of the England national football team from June 2001, but was asked to resign by Lazio president Sergio Cragnotti in January 2001, with the club eleven points behind their capital city rivals Roma. His last game was an unexpected 2–1 home loss to Napoli, and he was succeeded by Dino Zoff.

===England national football team===
Following the resignation of England manager Kevin Keegan after a home loss to Germany in October 2000, The Football Association (FA) pursued Eriksson as his replacement. He was the first foreign manager of England. His debut on 28 February 2001 was a 3–0 friendly win over Spain at Villa Park, with the opening goal by Nick Barmby and the other two by substitutes Emile Heskey and Ugo Ehiogu; substitute goalkeeper Nigel Martyn also saved a penalty from Javi Moreno.

On 1 September 2001, Eriksson&#x27;s team won 5–1 away to Germany in Munich; Germany had only ever lost one home game in World Cup qualification before, and had led the game after six minutes. On 6 October, a late free-kick equaliser by David Beckham ensured a 2–2 draw with Greece at Old Trafford, sending England directly to the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

====2002 World Cup====
At the finals, England drew with Sweden, defeated Argentina 1–0, and drew with Nigeria to qualify in second place from the four-team group. They went on to defeat Denmark 3–0 in the Round of 16, before losing 2–1 to ten-man Brazil, who went on to win the tournament.

====UEFA Euro 2004====
After winning their first qualifying match in Slovakia, England drew at home with Macedonia and were then booed off by their fans after losing a friendly to Australia. England, however, won their next five qualifiers and, needing a point from the last game to qualify, drew 0–0 in Turkey to top the group.

In their first match in the finals, England were winning 1–0 against France after 90 minutes, but lost after Zinedine Zidane scored twice in injury time. A 3–0 victory over Switzerland and a 4–2 victory over Croatia, however, meant England still qualified for a quarter-final against the hosts Portugal. There, Michael Owen gave England an early lead only for Hélder Postiga to equalize. England then had a Sol Campbell goal disallowed before ultimately losing on penalties.

====2006 World Cup====
In March 2004, Eriksson&#x27;s contract was extended by two years to cover UEFA Euro 2008. He said that he would have wanted to wait until after Euro 2004 to sign it, but it was necessary in order to counter rumours that he would leave for Chelsea. The FA did not confirm or deny rumours that the new contract included a clause allowing him to quit after the 2006 FIFA World Cup. 

On 7 September 2005, Eriksson&#x27;s England team lost a World Cup qualifying match against Northern Ireland 1–0. This was the first time that England had lost to these opponents since 1972, and the first time in Belfast since 1927. Although it was England&#x27;s first-ever defeat in a World Cup or European Championship qualifying match under Eriksson, it brought his position under pressure and he was criticised, both by some fans and by commentators from the BBC, for his alleged lack of charisma and tactical awareness. 

In January 2006, Eriksson was recorded saying he would be willing to leave England to manage Aston Villa if England won the World Cup, after being duped into believing that a wealthy Arab would buy the club, and wanted him as manager. The wealthy &quot;Arab&quot; was in fact the &quot;Fake Sheikh&quot; Mazher Mahmood, an undercover &quot;News of the World&quot; reporter. On 23 January, The FA announced that Eriksson would leave his job after the 2006 World Cup, and it was thought that the &quot;News of the World&quot; allegations played a part in this decision. 

In March 2006, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that South Africa became the first potential employer publicly to register its interest in Eriksson. 

England finished top of Group B at the finals, beating Paraguay and Trinidad and Tobago, before a 2–2 draw with Sweden, although the English press considered their performances far from satisfactory. After defeating Ecuador by a single Beckham free kick in the last 16, England were again eliminated on penalties by Portugal in the quarter-finals.

BBC Sport pundit Phil McNulty wrote a scathing review of Eriksson&#x27;s period in charge, writing that he was unable to change games after England went behind, refused to drop Beckham and could not combine Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard in midfield. McNulty added that Eriksson had chosen Theo Walcott for the 2006 World Cup without watching him play, and never fielded the Arsenal player, who had been chosen ahead of Jermain Defoe. Reflecting that Eriksson had taken over £20 million in salary, McNulty wrote &quot;he will be remembered as a failure and a mighty pricey one at that&quot;.

Eriksson improved England&#x27;s FIFA World Rankings place from seventeenth place in January 2001 to fifth in July 2006, reaching fourth during the 2006 World Cup, and was rated in 2007 by The FA as England&#x27;s second most successful manager after Alf Ramsey. Under Eriksson, England achieved the highest point percentage in major tournament matches of all time for an England manager, losing only three competitive games (excluding extra time), and achieved top qualifying place in all three international tournaments.

In July 2006, after his final match with England, ESPN reported that he had turned down the chance to manage Jamaica, as well as an unknown participating club in the UEFA Champions League. In October 2006, it was rumoured he was in talks to manage Newcastle United, which his agent denied.

===Manchester City===
On 6 July 2007, virtually a year to the day that he left the England job, Eriksson was confirmed as the new manager of Manchester City after signing a three-year contract worth £2 million per year, plus bonuses. He was City&#x27;s first manager from outside the United Kingdom and the first Swedish manager in the Premier League. Before the season started, he signed striker Rolando Bianchi, along with midfielders Gélson Fernandes, Geovanni, Martin Petrov and Elano; and defenders Vedran Ćorluka and Javier Garrido.

On 19 August, Manchester City beat reigning Premier League champions Manchester United to go top of the 2007–08 Premier League after three games without conceding a goal. Eriksson received the Premier League&#x27;s Manager of the Month award for August. The club stayed in the top six throughout the rest of 2007, and were third throughout October and November, but fell to seventh on 12 January 2008 after winning only one of their previous five games.

In Spring 2008, owner Thaksin Shinawatra said that he would replace Eriksson after only one full season due to an &quot;avalanche of very poor results which is unacceptable at this level&quot;. In the last game of the season, Manchester City suffered an 8–1 loss to Middlesbrough, the biggest defeat of Eriksson&#x27;s career.

Manchester City ended in ninth place in the league, one place away from the UEFA Cup 2008–09 qualifying positions. Manchester City subsequently qualified through the extra place awarded to the Premier League for finishing as the highest placed team who had not already qualified for a European competition in the UEFA Fair Play League for 2007–08. Eriksson became the first Manchester City manager since 1969–70 to win both league derby games against Manchester United and also achieved the club&#x27;s then joint highest Premier League point total, 55.

On 2 June 2008, Manchester City confirmed by club statement that they had parted company with Eriksson by &quot;mutual consent&quot;, with Eriksson still having two years left on his contract.

===Mexico national team===
On 3 June 2008, Eriksson was officially signed to become manager of the Mexico national team. He formally started the role after Mexico&#x27;s World Cup qualifier against Belize on 21 June. On 20 August 2008, he debuted as manager of Mexico in a CONCACAF World Cup qualifier versus Honduras. Mexico went on to win 2–1. During the next few matches, some results were poor, as Mexico drew with Canada and lost to Jamaica and Honduras.

On 11 February 2009, Eriksson was put under further pressure as his side lost 2–0 to the United States. Calls for him to quit or be sacked were heard from the fans while English club Portsmouth were rumoured to be interested in making him their new manager. This link was strengthened by reports of members from the Portsmouth board flying to Mexico City to discuss contract offers with Eriksson and a possible compensation settlement with the Mexican Football Federation.

On 3 March 2009, Eriksson continued to deny that he would leave Mexico and return to manage Portsmouth, insisting that he would remain and help Mexico qualify for the World Cup. After a 3–1 World Cup qualifying loss at Honduras, Eriksson was removed as national team coach. Eriksson had only won one of his last seven non-friendly games as manager.

===Notts County===
On 22 July 2009, Eriksson was appointed as director of football at English League Two team Notts County following that club&#x27;s takeover by Middle East consortium Munto Finance with Eriksson getting a reported, but unconfirmed, £2 million per year deal.

Eriksson later said that he was attracted by the consortium&#x27;s plans to take the world&#x27;s oldest league club to the top of the Premier League, and believed that they had the finance and commitment to do that. Large-scale investment in new facilities were promised, and Sol Campbell and Kasper Schmeichel joined the club from Premier League teams. Campbell, however, played only one game before departing and Schmeichel was released at the end of the season.

County&#x27;s large debts, including an unpaid tax bill, emerged in November 2009. On 11 February 2010, Eriksson resigned as director of football following the club&#x27;s takeover by former Lincoln City chairman Ray Trew. Eriksson waived a multi-million payoff in order to assist the takeover, which chairman Trew described as the act of an &quot;absolute gentleman&quot;. Notts County were promoted as League Two champions at the end of the season.

=== Ivory Coast ===
On 28 March 2010, Eriksson became the manager of the Ivory Coast national team. Disclosure of the amount of money Eriksson&#x27;s contract was worth has never been confirmed, but it has been reported that he received £270,000 for accepting the job. On 15 June, Ivory Coast played an ill-tempered 0–0 draw against Portugal in their opening game in Group G of the 2010 World Cup finals, followed by a 3–1 loss against Brazil on 20 June.

Despite defeating North Korea in the final group game 3–0, Ivory Coast failed to qualify for the knockout stage, along with their opponent. Prior to the match against Brazil, Brazilian coach Dunga commented, &quot;With Eriksson, Ivory Coast has great balance. We used to see them play and they didn&#x27;t have this type of organisation that they have now.&quot;

As there were no reported negotiations of an extension to Eriksson&#x27;s contract between his agent and the Ivorian Football Federation, his contract ended on 25 June.

===Leicester City===
Eriksson was appointed manager of Leicester City on 3 October 2010, as the Foxes sat in the relegation zone of the Championship. His first league game in charge resulted in a 1–1 draw against Hull City, managed by Nigel Pearson who had managed Leicester for the previous two seasons. This was quickly followed by Leicester&#x27;s first victory under Eriksson, beating Leeds United 2–1 at Elland Road.

In December 2010, Eriksson denied that he had been in talks for becoming the new manager for Blackburn Rovers, following the exit of Sam Allardyce, stating he was happy managing Leicester.

Boosted by the loan signings of players such as Kyle Naughton and later Yakubu, results steadily improved under Eriksson as Leicester gradually began to climb the table, until a good run of form in the new year saw Leicester win seven of their first eight league games of 2011, and also take Premier League title challengers and eventual cup winners Manchester City to a replay in the FA Cup.

On 18 February 2011, after an injury time winner from Martyn Waghorn at home to Bristol City, Leicester had climbed to seventh in the table, and just one point off a play-off place. Leicester&#x27;s form, however, began to stutter as they won just two out of their following eleven games. The Foxes ended up finishing the season in 10th position.

Eriksson spent big in a bid for promotion in the summer of 2011, including multimillion-pound transfer fees on Matt Mills and Jermaine Beckford. making them pre season promotion favourites. After thirteen league matches, however, Eriksson left the club by mutual consent on 25 October 2011, with the Foxes sitting in the thirteenth position in the league, two points from a relegation play-off position.

Three players who were signed by Eriksson – Kasper Schmeichel, David Nugent and Paul Konchesky – were part of the Leicester team that won the 2013–14 Championship and survived relegation from the 2014–15 Premier League under Nigel Pearson. Nugent credited Eriksson for his improved form at the club. Of the three, Schmeichel was a key member of the first team that won the 2015–16 Premier League.

===2012–2013===
In an interview with Yorkshire Radio on 8 February 2012, the chairman of Football League Championship club Leeds United, Ken Bates, revealed that Eriksson had applied for the vacant managerial position at the club after the dismissal of Simon Grayson. Bates went on to state that his application was unsuccessful. On 3 September 2012, Eriksson was unveiled as the technical director of BEC Tero Sasana, a team in the Thai League 1.

On 17 November 2012, Norwegian media reported that Eriksson was in talks with Vålerenga, about the possibility of taking over the soon to be available manager job for the Oslo-based club. A meeting between the two parties was held on 21 November in Oslo, but no deal was made. In December, negotiations between Eriksson and the Football Federation of Ukraine, who had offered him the position of head coach of the Ukraine national team, did not bear fruit.

On 15 January 2013, it was announced that Eriksson would be joining German 2. Bundesliga side 1860 Munich as assistant to Alexander Schmidt. On 18 January 2013, the club however reported, that Eriksson declined the offer to join 1860.

On 21 January 2013, Eriksson became technical director of Dubai-based club Al Nasr in the UAE Pro League.

===China===

On 4 June 2013, Guangzhou R&amp;F of the Chinese Super League announced Eriksson as their new head coach, on a nineteen-month contract lasting until December 2014. He was believed to be paid around £2 million a year for the job. He came up against former Italy manager Marcello Lippi in the city&#x27;s derby matches, as the World Cup winner was manager of local rival Guangzhou Evergrande. Under Eriksson, Guangzhou R&amp;F finished third in the league in 2014, and therefore qualified for the AFC Champions League for the first time. He left Guangzhou R&amp;F on 10 November 2014, after a disagreement in negotiations for extending his contract.

Eriksson signed a two-year contract with fellow Chinese Super League side Shanghai SIPG on 18 November 2014. He led Shanghai SIPG to finish runners up in the season of 2015, and qualified for the AFC Champions League for the first time.

Under Eriksson, Shanghai SIPG advanced to the quarter-finals in their debut in the AFC Champions League, and secured a seat in the 2017 AFC Champions League by finishing third in the 2016 season. However, Eriksson was criticized for his tactical play and failure to give chances to young talents throughout his term at SIPG. He was replaced by André Villas-Boas on 4 November 2016.

On 5 December 2016, Eriksson became the manager of China League One side Shenzhen, replacing Clarence Seedorf. He won his first six matches of the season of 2017, including five league matches and a FA Cup match. However, Eriksson was sacked on 14 June 2017, following a nine-game run without a win.

===Philippines national team===
On 27 October 2018, Eriksson returned to international football after he was appointed head coach of the Philippines national team on a six-month contract. He was recommended to the position by interim coach Scott Cooper, who took over after Terry Butcher&#x27;s resignation in August; Eriksson and Cooper previously worked together for English club Leicester City.

In October 2018, Eriksson met with the Filipino players during their training camp in Qatar. The 2018 AFF Championship was his first tournament leading the Philippines. With wins over Singapore and Timor-Leste, and draws with Thailand and Indonesia, the Philippines ended second place in Group B. However, the Philippines were defeated by eventual champions Vietnam on 4–2 aggregate in the two-legged semi-finals.

Eriksson was then tasked to lead the Philippines in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup—the team&#x27;s first appearance in the tournament. They lost their first group match 1–0 to South Korea. This was followed by a 3–0 loss to China, which was coached by Eriksson&#x27;s friend Marcello Lippi. Philippines ended their Asian Cup campaign in a 3–1 loss to Kyrgyzstan, where Stephan Schröck&#x27;s consolation goal was the Philippines&#x27; only goal in the tournament.

After the Philippines&#x27; winless Asian Cup debut, Eriksson ended his tenure as head coach of the national team. However, he continued to serve as a consultant for quite some time.

==Style of management==
Considered to be one of the greatest managers of all time, tactically, Eriksson was initially inspired by the style of his former teammate and manager Tord Grip early into his coaching career, who was in turn influenced by that of English managers Bob Houghton and Roy Hodgson, who introduced an innovative 4–4–2 formation into Swedish football, which made use of zonal marking and heavy pressing. While Eriksson&#x27;s style was successful at IFK Göteborg, he also drew criticism from the fans for being overly pragmatic as a coach, with a focus on getting results over playing with flair, and placing a particular emphasis on the tactical awareness and work-rate of his teams.

During his time at Lazio, he also used a fluid 4–5–1 formation at times, in particular during the 1999–2000 season, which could become a 4–2–3–1, a 4–3–3, a 4–1–4–1, or a 4–4–2 throughout the course of a match. The team&#x27;s gameplay was primarily based on creating a numerical advantage in the opposing half rather than controlling the ball, and through looking to attack and score as quickly as possible, while minimising risk. During the opening of matches, the team often played a vertical passing game, making use of long balls out from the back in an attempt to stretch their opponents, and create spaces for the team&#x27;s more creative players to exploit. If this was done successfully, throughout the course of the match, the team would then play a series of many quick short passes in a more organised manner to build attacks. Eriksson also utilised the flanks offensively. He also placed significant importance on the physical and mental qualities of his players. Defensively, his team still made use of pressing further up the pitch, and the team&#x27;s formation would transform into an organised and compact 4–1–4–1 with little distance between the lines. At times, the team&#x27;s defensive set-up made them vulnerable to counter-attacks or one-twos if their opponents broke through the first line, however, which allowed teams to play through them on occasion. In the first third of the pitch, Lazio would drop deeper to defend. While Eriksson used a zonal marking system in Sweden, at Lazio, he instead used a strategy which resembled the &quot;zona mista&quot;, which was a cross between zonal marking and man-to-man marking systems. Eriksson often rotated his players at Lazio. He alternated Giuseppe Pancaro or Giuseppe Favalli at left-back, who would overlap and join the attack, with Paolo Negro as the full-back on the right side of the team&#x27;s four-man defence. He also successfully converted Siniša Mihajlović – formerly a left winger, second striker, or left-back – into a ball-playing centre-back or sweeper, alongside fellow ball-playing centre-back Alessandro Nesta. During the 1999–2000 &quot;scudetto&quot;-winning season, he often deployed either Roberto Sensini or Matías Almeyda alongside Diego Simeone in midfield, to help cover for the team defensively. On the flanks, he often alternated Pavel Nedvěd, Roberto Mancini, or Alen Bokšić on the left, and one of Sérgio Conceição, Attilio Lombardo or Dejan Stanković on the right. All the team&#x27;s midfielders were given the freedom to switch positions, to help give the team a numerical advantage in midfield when in possession, except for the deepest defensive midfielder, and the right winger; the latter was expected to push up the flank, take on opponents in one on one situations, and provide crosses into the box. The left winger, depending on the team selection, would often drift into the centre, either to support the midfield or the main striker, or make runs off the ball to get on the end of passes; he would also drop back into midfield to assist the team defensively off the ball, and cover for the full-backs. Eriksson was also praised for using Juan Sebastián Verón in a deeper playmaking role in midfield at Lazio behind the forwards, rather than in the more advanced role he had played at Parma, which had a positive impact on his performances. The team were also known for their effectiveness from set-pieces. Eriksson initially fielded two strikers – Marcelo Salas and Simone Inzaghi – before abandoning this system early into the 1999–2000 season, alternating one of them up-front as a lone centre-forward; Inzaghi would provide depth to the team with his runs, or get onto the end of passes and score, while Salas would look to get onto the end of crosses and long balls, or drop deep to link-up with the midfield and hold up the ball.

During his time as England&#x27;s manager, however, Eriksson did come under criticism from pundits and the public for fielding Paul Scholes out of position, seemingly as a left midfielder, at Euro 2004, rather than in the centre, in order to accommodate Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard in midfield; Eriksson defended this decision, however, stating that other players were not as adept in that role, and that he wanted to field his four strongest midfielders. He elaborated that Scholes was also given the freedom to move into the centre to help the midfield and receive the ball, something which Scholes himself confirmed, likening it to a role he had also played successfully under his Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson. 

In addition to his success and tactical prowess, Eriksson was also known for his positive leadership style as a manager, which also influenced Carlo Ancelotti&#x27;s coaching style during their time together at Roma in the 1980s. His coaching style at Lazio influenced his former Lazio players Simone Inzaghi, Diego Simeone, Roberto Mancini, and Matías Almeyda, who also went on to pursue coaching careers.

==Personal life==

Eriksson was married to Ann-Christine Pettersson from July 1977 until their divorce in 1994. They had two children, Lina and Johan. In May 1998, Eriksson was introduced to lawyer Nancy Dell&#x27;Olio, and they began a relationship six months later. In 2001, they relocated to London. In early 2002, Eriksson had an affair with television presenter Ulrika Jonsson, but he returned to Dell&#x27;Olio. In August 2004, he had an affair with secretary Faria Alam. 

In 2002, Eriksson endorsed the PlayStation games &quot;Sven-Göran Eriksson&#x27;s World Cup Challenge&quot; and &quot;Sven-Göran Eriksson&#x27;s World Cup Manager&quot;.

Eriksson&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;My Story&quot;, was published in November 2013.

In October 2016, Eriksson announced he was to take legal action against Mazher Mahmood, on the basis that the January 2006 &quot;News of the World&quot; story had cost him the England coaching job.

==Illness and death==
In January 2024, Eriksson announced that he had been diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and had &quot;at best about a year to live&quot;. In March 2024, he was invited to manage the Liverpool Legends for a charity match against Ajax; Eriksson was a lifelong fan of Liverpool and had always aspired to manage the club. Eriksson was, after that, honoured by his former clubs Benfica, IFK Göteborg, Sampdoria, Lazio, Degerfors IF, and Torsby IF at their respective stadiums. 

Eriksson died at his home in Björkefors near Sunne, Sweden on the morning of 26 August 2024, at the age of 76. The world of football paid many tributes to Eriksson. His former England captain David Beckham said &quot;Sven, thank you for always being the person you have always been – passionate, caring, calm and a true gentleman. I will be forever grateful for you making me your captain but I will forever hold these last memories of this day with you and your family... Thank you Sven and in your last words to me &#x27;It will be ok&#x27;.&quot; His funeral took place on 13 September 2024 at Fryksände church in Torsby, Sweden. Many football people attended, among them David Beckham, Tord Grip and Thomas Nordahl, son of the Swedish former footballer Gunnar Nordahl.

<doc id="88259" wikidata="Q1642255" url="?curid=88259" title="Splashdown">
<text>Splashdown is the method of landing a spacecraft or launch vehicle in a body of water, usually by parachute. This has been the primary recovery method of American capsules including NASA’s Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and Orion along with the private SpaceX Dragon. It is also possible for the Boeing Starliner, Russian Soyuz, and the Chinese Shenzhou crewed capsules to land in water in case of contingency. NASA recovered the Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters (SRBs) via splashdown, as is done for Rocket Lab&#x27;s Electron first stage.

As the name suggests, the vehicle parachutes into an ocean or other large body of water. Due to its low density and viscosity, water cushions the spacecraft enough that there is no need for a braking rocket to slow the final descent as is the case with Russian and Chinese crewed space capsules or airbags as is the case with the Starliner.

The American practice came in part because American launch sites are on the coastline and launch primarily over water. Russian launch sites such as Baikonur Cosmodrome are far inland, and most early launch aborts would descend on land.

==History==

The splashdown method of landing was used for Mercury, Gemini and Apollo (including Skylab, which used Apollo capsules). Soyuz 23 unintentionally landed on a freezing lake with slushy patches of ice during a snowstorm.

On early Mercury flights, a helicopter attached a cable to the capsule, lifted it from the water and delivered it to a nearby ship. This was changed after the sinking of &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot;. All later Mercury, Gemini and Apollo capsules had a flotation collar (similar to a rubber life raft) attached to the spacecraft to increase their buoyancy. The spacecraft would then be brought alongside a ship and lifted onto deck by crane.

After the flotation collar is attached, a hatch on the spacecraft is usually opened. At that time, some astronauts decide to be hoisted aboard a helicopter for a ride to the recovery ship and some decided to stay with the spacecraft and be lifted aboard ship via crane. All Gemini and Apollo flights (Apollos 7 to 17) used the former, while Mercury missions from Mercury 6 to Mercury 9, as well as all Skylab missions and Apollo-Soyuz used the latter, especially the Skylab flights as to preserve all medical data. During the Gemini and Apollo programs, NASA used for the astronauts to practice water egress.

Apollo 11 was America&#x27;s first Moon landing mission and marked the first time that humans walked on the surface of another planetary body. The possibility of the astronauts bringing pathogens from the Moon back to Earth was remote, but not ruled out. To contain any possible contaminants at the scene of the splashdown, the astronauts donned special Biological Isolation Garments and the outside of the suits were scrubbed prior to the astronauts being hoisted aboard and escorted safely inside a Mobile Quarantine Facility.

Both the SpaceX Dragon 1 and Dragon 2 capsules were designed to use the splashdown method of landing. The original cargo Dragon splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Baja California. At the request of NASA, both the crew and cargo variations of the Dragon 2 capsule splash down off the coast of Florida, either in the Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico.

The early design concept for Orion (then known as the Crew Exploration Vehicle) featured recovery on land using a combination of parachutes and airbags, although it was also designed to make a contingency splashdown if needed. Due to weight considerations, the airbag design concept was dropped for Orion, and it conducts landings via splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.

==Disadvantages==
Perhaps the most dangerous aspect is the possibility of the spacecraft flooding and sinking. For example, when the hatch of Gus Grissom&#x27;s &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; capsule blew prematurely, the capsule sank and Grissom almost drowned. Since the spacecraft&#x27;s flooding will occur from a location in its hull where it ruptures first, it is important to determine the location on the hull that experiences the highest loading. This location along the impacting side is determined by the surrounding `air cushion&#x27; layer, which deforms the water surface before the moment of impact, and results in a non-trivial geometry of the liquid surface during first touch-down. Soyuz 23 was dragged under a frozen lake by its parachutes. The crew became incapacitated by carbon dioxide and were rescued after a nine-hour recovery operation.

If the capsule comes down far from any recovery forces, the crew may be stranded at sea for an extended period of time. As an example, Scott Carpenter in &quot;Aurora 7&quot; overshot the assigned landing zone by . These recovery operation mishaps can be mitigated by placing several vessels on standby in different locations, but this can be an expensive option.

Exposure to salt water can have adverse effects on vehicles intended for reuse, such as Dragon.

Some reusable launch vehicles recover components via splashdown. This was first seen with the Space Shuttle SRBs, with STS-1 launching in 1981. Out of 135 launches, NASA recovered all but two sets of SRBs.

SpaceX has conducted propulsive splashdowns of the Falcon 9 first stage, Super Heavy booster, and Starship spacecraft. These vehicles are designed to land on land or modified barges and do not always survive intact after tipping over in the water; SpaceX has mainly conducted propulsive splashdowns for development flights. After the launch of CRS-16, the booster experienced a control issue and splashed down in the ocean instead of making an intended landing at Landing Zone 1.

Rocket Lab intended to catch the first stage of their Electron rocket with a helicopter as it descended under parachute, but abandoned this idea in favor of parachute splashdown. In 2020, Rocket Lab made their first booster recovery.

<text>Tony Alexander Adams (born 10 October 1966) is an English former football manager and player. Adams played for Arsenal and England, captaining both teams. Known as Mr. Arsenal, he spent his entire playing career of 19 years as a centre-back there, making 672 total appearances and winning four English league titles. He is considered one of Arsenal&#x27;s greatest ever players, and is also included in the Football League 100 Legends.

With Arsenal, he won four top flight division titles, uniquely captaining a title-winning team in three different decades, three FA Cups, two Football League Cups, a UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and two FA Community Shields. Adams is one of six people honoured with a statue outside the Emirates Stadium, Arsenal&#x27;s home ground. He won 66 caps for England between 1987 and 2000, and played at four major tournaments.

When his playing career finished, Adams went into football management, spending periods in charge of Wycombe Wanderers, Portsmouth, Azerbaijani side Gabala and Spanish side Granada.

From early in his career Adams was an alcoholic off the field, and after crashing his car was sentenced to four months in prison for driving while four times over the limit for blood alcohol. From 1996 he recovered completely, and became involved in helping sportspeople with drink, drug or gambling addictions, founding the Sporting Chance Clinic.

==Early life==
Born in Romford, Adams grew up in Dagenham and was a pupil at Hunters Hall Primary School from 1971 to 1978 and then Eastbrook Comprehensive School from 1978 to 1983. His cousin is fellow professional footballer Steve MacKenzie.

==Club career==

=== 1983–1989: Early career and Anfield title ===
Adams signed for Arsenal as a schoolboy in 1980, and made his first-team debut on 5 November 1983 against Sunderland, aged 17. He accidentally put his shorts on back-to-front before the match. Then, with virtually his first touch of the ball during the game, he gave it away, leading to Sunderland&#x27;s opening goal. He put the ball into the opponents&#x27; net, but the goal was disallowed. Adams became a regular player in the 1986–87 season, winning his first major trophy that season when playing in the Football League Cup Final win over Liverpool at Wembley.

On 1 January 1988, he became Arsenal captain at the age of 21, remaining as club captain for the next 14 years until his retirement.

Adams&#x27;s strong discipline of the defence was considered a factor in Arsenal winning the League Cup in 1986–87 and then the First Division championship twice; the first in 1988–89 after a win over Liverpool in the final game of the season; the second in 1990–91, losing once all season.

=== 1989–1996: Arsenal&#x27;s famous back four ===
Together with Lee Dixon, Nigel Winterburn and Steve Bould, Adams was part of the &quot;famous back four&quot; that lined up in Arsenal&#x27;s defence, which under George Graham was renowned for its well-disciplined use of the offside trap. The backline achieved legendary status with its unyielding resilience, remaining formidable for over a decade. Arsenal notably conceded just 18 goals during their title-winning 1990–91 league season, and the four players amassed over 2,000 appearances for the club.

In 1992–93 Adams was the captain of the first English side to win the League Cup and FA Cup double. In 1994, Adams led Arsenal to their first European trophy in 24 years by defeating favourites Parma 1–0 in the 1994 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final in Copenhagen.

Despite this success, alcoholism increasingly blighted his life from the mid-1980s. He was reportedly often involved in fights in nightclubs, and on 6 May 1990 crashed his car into a wall in Rayleigh; his blood alcohol level was found to be more than four times the legal drink-drive limit. On 19 December that year, at Southend Crown Court, he was sentenced to four months in prison, and freed after half of his sentence on 15 February 1991, but continued drinking for another six years. Adams in a 2024 interview said that in early 1996, aged 29, he was in a very dark period, not wanting to live when not playing football, unable to &quot;do life&quot;. He was injured that February, removing football. One Sunday evening he drank seven bottles of chablis, so his (first) mother-in-law took the children.

From mid-1996, with help from a man he named only as &quot;James W&quot;, he became one of the most high-profile recovering alcoholics in the UK; his battle with alcohol is detailed in his autobiography, &quot;Addicted&quot;, which was released in May 1998 to critical acclaim. &quot;BBC News&quot; reported in 2001 that he had become tee-total.

=== 1996–2002: Wenger&#x27;s arrival and retirement ===

Six weeks into Adams&#x27;s sobriety, Arsène Wenger arrived as Arsenal manager in October 1996. Adams reflected in 2020 that Wenger understood his psychology, and knew of the dangers of alcohol, as his parents ran a pub. Adams rewarded his manager&#x27;s understanding handsomely, captaining the club to two Premiership and FA Cup Doubles, in 1997–98 and 2001–02.

In August 2002, just before the start of the 2002–03 season, Adams retired from professional football after a career spanning almost 20 years, his last match being the 2002 FA Cup Final. He played 674 matches for Arsenal (only David O&#x27;Leary has played more) and was the most successful captain in the club&#x27;s history. The number 6 shirt that Adams wore when playing was not used again until the 2006–07 season, when it was assigned to Philippe Senderos.

Just before his retirement as a player, Adams had applied to become manager of Brentford (who had just missed out on promotion to Division One) after the resignation of Steve Coppell, but his application was rejected.

Nicknamed &quot;Mr Arsenal&quot;, he was honoured by Arsenal with a testimonial game against Celtic in May 2002 with many Arsenal legends playing, including Ian Wright, John Lukic and Adams&#x27;s fellow back four stalwarts, Dixon, Winterburn and Bould. The game finished 1–1 with Lee Dixon, in his final appearance for the Gunners, getting their goal. In March 2003, just seven months after his retirement and with Arsenal BBC Sport named Adams as the former Arsenal player that the club would most benefit from returning.

In 2004, Adams was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in recognition of his impact on the English game, and in 2008 he was placed third in the 50 Greatest Gunners poll on the club&#x27;s website.

A statue of Adams was placed outside Emirates Stadium in celebration of the club&#x27;s 125th anniversary on 9 December 2011. Manager Herbert Chapman and Arsenal&#x27;s all-time top goal scorer Thierry Henry, and later Dennis Bergkamp, were also immortalised with statues outside the ground.

==International career==

Adams made his debut for England against Spain in 1987, and played in UEFA Euro 1988. England lost all three games, but Adams scored one of England&#x27;s two goals in the tournament in a 3–1 defeat to the Soviet Union. He was the first player to represent England who had been born after the 1966 World Cup win.

After a highly promising start to his international career, Adams suffered a series of setbacks during the early 1990s. He was surprisingly left out of the 1990 FIFA World Cup squad by manager Bobby Robson, missed UEFA Euro 1992 due to injury, whilst England failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. England reached the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 1996, before losing on penalties to Germany.

Adams appeared at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Later that year, he made headlines for several statements in his autobiography &quot;Addicted&quot;, criticising manager Glenn Hoddle for his management of David Beckham and Paul Gascoigne, and for making Alan Shearer captain instead of Adams; he also called Gascoigne an alcoholic, which was denied by the player&#x27;s representatives. Hoddle told the press that he had no problems with Adams&#x27;s opinions from the book.

His international swansong was England&#x27;s unsuccessful UEFA Euro 2000 campaign. With Shearer retiring from international football after the tournament, Adams regained the captaincy. However, within months, England lost a World Cup qualifier to Germany in October 2000, the match being the last to be staged at Wembley Stadium, before the stadium was torn down for rebuilding. That match was Adams&#x27;s 60th Wembley appearance, a record. With Sven-Göran Eriksson eventually taking the helm and under increasing pressure for his place from the emerging and improving Rio Ferdinand, Adams retired from international football, having made 66 appearances, before Eriksson picked his first squad. He was the last England player to score at the old Wembley Stadium when he scored England&#x27;s second goal in a 2–0 friendly win over Ukraine on 31 May 2000. This was also his first goal since he scored in a friendly against Saudi Arabia in November 1988, thus making the record for the longest gap between goals for England.

Adams was the first, and remains to date the only, England player to make tournament appearances in three separate decades.

==Style of play==
Described as a &quot;stopper&quot; (or man–marking defender) by Tom Sheen of &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2014, Adams played as a centre-back. A tall, brave, rugged, physical, and committed defender, his main traits were his leadership, aerial prowess, and his ability to read the game and time his tackles. While initially he was not known to be the most gifted player on the ball from a technical standpoint, he developed this aspect of his game under Wenger, and he later excelled as a ball-playing centre-back, in which he became known for his ability to carry the ball out from the back, as well as his penchant for undertaking individual runs. However, he was also known for his lack of pace.

==Managerial and coaching career==
After starting a sports science degree at Brunel University, Adams became the manager of Wycombe Wanderers on 5 November 2003. He took over the team that were in last place in the Football League Second Division (third tier). On his debut three days later, he won 4–1 at home to Swindon Town in the first round of the FA Cup. After a 2–1 loss at Tranmere Rovers on 12 April 2004 left the Chairboys 12 points inside the relegation zone with four games remaining, Adams said that his team would carry on fighting; unbeknown to the club, they were already relegated as two teams above them still had to play each other.

Wycombe began 2004–05 in the fourth tier, renamed League Two. Although the club were top of the table in August 2004, a loss of form saw them fall down the table. Adams resigned from Wycombe on 9 November 2004, with the club in 17th, citing personal reasons.

In July 2005, Adams accepted a trainee coaching role with Dutch side Feyenoord with special responsibility for its Jong team, which is a reserve/junior side. Adams later had a short spell seconded to Utrecht as a first team trainee coach in January and February 2006. While at Feyenoord he also worked part-time as a scout for Arsenal, watching games in Italy, France and the Netherlands.

Adams joined Portsmouth as assistant manager to Harry Redknapp in June 2006, a position left vacant by the departure of Kevin Bond. In his first season as assistant, Portsmouth finished ninth in the Premier League – their highest standing since the 1950s and won the 2007–08 FA Cup. Adams was appointed caretaker manager of Portsmouth in October 2008, alongside Joe Jordan, following the departure of Harry Redknapp to Tottenham Hotspur. He was subsequently appointed full-time manager. He was sacked in February 2009 after just 16 games in charge in which Portsmouth picked up only 10 points.

In May 2010, Adams signed a three-year contract to manage Azerbaijani club FC Gabala of the Azerbaijan Premier League. He departed as coach of Gabala due on 16 November 2011, before the end of the 2011–12 season.

In October 2012, Adams returned to Gabala in the capacity of Sporting Director.

Whilst sporting director at Gabala, Adams suffered from acute chest pain whilst exercising. At the Baku Medical Plaza he was diagnosed with a severely blocked vein and underwent a successful angioplasty. After disclosing the surgery, Adams said the minor heart operation saved his life.

On 10 April 2017, Adams was named as manager of La Liga strugglers Granada CF until the end of the 2016–17 season. At the end of the season, Granada were relegated from La Liga ending their six-year stay in the top division. Adams lost all seven games as manager and was subsequently sacked.

==Outside football==
Adams married Jane Shea in 1992, after they met at a nightclub in Islington; the couple had two children together, a son and a daughter. They divorced in 1997 amid the couple&#x27;s substance abuse. Following his recovery from alcoholism, Adams married Poppy Teacher in 2004 and had three children together. Poppy is a fifth-generation descendent of whisky firm founder William Teacher.

In September 2000, as a result of his own experiences with alcoholism and drug addiction, Adams founded the Sporting Chance Clinic, a charitable foundation aimed at providing treatment, counselling and support for sports men and women suffering from drink, drug or gambling addictions. The clinic is modelled on the substance-abuse rehabilitation facility Crossroads Centre, founded by music artist Eric Clapton. The registered charity is supported by Elton John, Kate Hoey, Lee Dixon, Tony Smith, Tony McCoy, and Kelly Holmes. Adams&#x27; Arsenal testimonial match in May 2002 also raised £500,000 for the foundation.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Adams founded Six Mental Health Solutions (SIX MHS), an organisation that provides mental health and addiction services to employees across a range of partnered businesses. SIX MHS has since formed partnerships with several organisations, including the building materials company Jewson in 2021, and the Football Writers&#x27; Association in 2024. He is also a patron of the National Association for Children of Alcoholics (NACOA UK), The Forward Trust, School-Home Support (SHS), and Saving Faces, a facial surgery research foundation.

In December 2018, Adams was named as the 29th President of the Rugby Football League, replacing politician Andy Burnham; he was succeeded in the honorary role by broadcaster Clare Balding a year later. Adams also took part as a celebrity contestant in the twentieth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in 2022&quot;.&quot; After partnering with dance professional Katya Jones, the duo placed ninth after Adams was forced to withdraw due to injury.

<text>The Shankill Butchers were an Ulster loyalist paramilitary gang – many of whom were members of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) – that was active between 1975 and 1982 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It was based in the Shankill area and was responsible for the deaths of at least 23 people, most of whom were killed in sectarian attacks.

The gang kidnapped, tortured and murdered random civilians suspected of being Catholics; each was beaten ferociously and had their throat slashed with a butcher&#x27;s knife. Some were also tortured and attacked with a hatchet. The gang also killed six Ulster Protestants over personal disputes and two other Protestants mistaken for Catholics.

Most of the gang were eventually caught and, in February 1979, received the longest combined prison sentences in United Kingdom legal history. However, gang leader Lenny Murphy and his two chief &quot;lieutenants&quot; escaped prosecution. Murphy was killed in November 1982 by the Provisional IRA, likely acting with loyalist paramilitaries who perceived him as a threat. The Butchers brought a new level of paramilitary violence to a country already hardened by death and destruction. The judge who oversaw the 1979 trial described their crimes as &quot;a lasting monument to blind sectarian bigotry&quot;.

==Timeline==
===Background===

Much of what is known about the Butchers comes from Martin Dillon&#x27;s &quot;The Shankill Butchers: A Case Study of Mass Murder&quot; (1989 and 1998). In compiling this detailed work, Dillon was reportedly given unlimited access to the case files of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), who eventually caught the gang. The commander of the Shankill Butchers was Lenny Murphy. Murphy was the youngest of three sons of Joyce (née Thompson) and William Murphy from the loyalist Shankill Road area of Belfast. At school, he was a known bully and would threaten other boys with a knife or with retribution from his two older brothers. Soon after leaving school at 16, he joined the UVF. Murphy often attended the trials of people accused of paramilitary crimes to become well acquainted with the laws of evidence and police procedure.

On 28 September 1972, Murphy (aged 20) shot and killed William Edward &quot;Ted&quot; Pavis (32) at his home in East Belfast. Pavis was a Protestant who the UVF accused of selling weapons to the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA). Murphy and an accomplice, Mervyn Connor, were arrested and held on remand in Belfast&#x27;s Crumlin Road prison. After a visit by police to Connor, fellow inmates suspected that he might cut a deal with the authorities. On 22 April 1973, Connor died by ingesting a large dose of cyanide. Before he died, he wrote a confession to the Pavis murder, reportedly under duress from Murphy. Murphy was brought to trial for the Pavis murder in June 1973. The court heard evidence from two witnesses who had seen Murphy pull the trigger and had later picked him out of an identification parade. The jury acquitted him due in part to Murphy&#x27;s disruption of the line-up. Murphy&#x27;s freedom was short-lived as he was re-arrested immediately for a number of escape attempts and imprisoned, then interned, for three years.

===Formation===

In May 1975, Murphy was released from prison, where he had married Margaret Gillespie. During his imprisonment, a daughter had been born to the couple. He spent much of his time frequenting pubs on the Shankill Road, assembling a paramilitary team that would enable him to act with some freedom from the UVF leadership (Brigade Staff). Murphy&#x27;s inner circle consisted of two people whom Dillon was unable to name for legal reasons but whom he called Murphy&#x27;s &quot;personal friends&quot;. These were a &quot;Mr. A&quot; and John Murphy, one of Lenny Murphy&#x27;s brothers (referred to as &quot;Mr. B&quot;). Further down the chain of command were Lenny Murphy&#x27;s &quot;sergeants&quot; William Moore and Bobby &quot;Basher&quot; Bates, a UVF member and former prisoner.

Moore, formerly a worker in a meat-processing factory, had stolen several large knives and meat-cleavers from his old workplace, tools that would later be used in more murders. Another prominent figure was Sam McAllister, who used his physical presence to intimidate others. On 2 October 1975, the gang raided a drinks premises in nearby Millfield. On finding that its four employees (two females and two males) were Catholics, Murphy shot three of them dead and ordered an accomplice to kill the fourth. By then, Murphy was using the upper floor of the Brown Bear pub at the corner of Mountjoy Street and the Shankill Road near his home as an occasional meeting-place for his unit.

===Cut-throat killings===
On 24–25 November 1975, using the city&#x27;s sectarian geography to identify likely targets, Murphy roamed the areas nearest the Catholic New Lodge in the hope of finding someone likely to be Catholic to abduct. Francis Crossin (34), a Catholic man and father of two, was walking down Library Street towards the city centre at approximately 12:40 when four of the Butchers, in Moore&#x27;s taxi, spotted him. As the taxi pulled alongside Crossin, Murphy jumped out and hit him on the right side of the head with a wheel brace to disorient him. He was dragged into the taxi by Benjamin Edwards and Archie Waller, two of Murphy&#x27;s gang. As the taxi returned to the safety of the nearby Shankill area, Crossin suffered a ferocious beating. He was subjected to a high level of violence, including a beer glass being shoved into his head. Murphy repeatedly told Crossin: &quot;I&#x27;m going to kill you, you bastard&quot;, before the taxi stopped at an entry off Wimbledon Street. Crossin was dragged into an alleyway and Murphy, brandishing a butcher&#x27;s knife, cut his throat almost through to the spine. The gang dispersed. Crossin, whose body was found the next morning by an elderly woman, was the first of three Catholics to be killed by Murphy in this &quot;horrific and brutal manner&quot;. &quot;Slaughter in back alley&quot; was the headline in the city&#x27;s major afternoon newspaper that day. A relative of Crossin said that his family was unable to have an open coffin at his wake because the body was so badly mutilated.
A few days later, on 30 November 1975, an internal feud led to the deaths of two members of a rival UVF company on the Shankill and to that of Archibald Waller, who had been involved in the Crossin murder. On 14 October of that year, Waller had killed Stewart Robinson in a punishment shooting gone wrong. With the sanction of the UVF Brigade Staff, he in turn was gunned down by one of Robinson&#x27;s comrades in the UVF team based in the Windsor Bar, a quarter of a mile from the Brown Bear pub. Enraged, Murphy had the gunman, former loyalist prisoner Noel &quot;Nogi&quot; Shaw, brought before a kangaroo court in the Lawnbrook Club, one of his Shankill drinking dens. After pistol whipping Shaw, Murphy shot him in front of his whole unit of about twenty men and returned to finish his drink at the bar. John Murphy and William Moore put Shaw&#x27;s body in a laundry basket, and Moore dumped it half a mile away.

Murphy&#x27;s other cut-throat victims were Thomas Quinn (55) and Francis Rice (24). Both were abducted late at night, on the weekend, in the same area as Crossin. Quinn was murdered in the Glencairn district of the Upper Shankill in the early hours of 7 February 1976 and Rice a few streets from Murphy&#x27;s home at about 1:30 on 22 February 1976, after a butcher&#x27;s knife had been collected from a loyalist club. Quinn&#x27;s body was not found until mid-evening, after a phone call to a Belfast newspaper, while Rice&#x27;s was found about six hours after his murder. Murphy&#x27;s main accomplices on both occasions were Moore and Bates, while Edwards was party to the killing of Quinn. Another man and two women, whom Dillon did not name, were accessories to Murphy in the murder of Rice.

By this time the expression &quot;the Butchers&quot; had appeared in media coverage of these killings, and many Catholics lived in fear of the gang. Detective Chief Inspector Jimmy Nesbitt, head of the CID Murder Squad in Tennent Street RUC base and the man charged with tracking down the Butchers, was in no doubt that the murders of Crossin, Quinn and Rice were the work of the same people. Other than that he had little information, although a lead was provided by the woman who found Rice&#x27;s body. The previous night she had heard voices in the entry where the body was later found and what she thought might have been a local taxi (those in Belfast being ex-London type black cabs). This had led to William Moore&#x27;s taxi being examined for evidence, as were all other Shankill taxis; however, the Butchers had cleaned the vehicle thoroughly and nothing incriminating was found. Under Murphy&#x27;s orders, Moore destroyed the taxi and bought a yellow Ford Cortina, which was to be used in subsequent murders.

Early on 11 March 1976, Murphy tried to kill a Catholic woman in a drive-by shooting; arrested later that day, he was put on remand on an attempted murder charge. Shortly after Murphy&#x27;s arrest, he began to receive visits from &quot;Mr. A&quot; and &quot;Mr. B&quot;. He told &quot;Mr. A&quot; that the cut-throat murders should continue in due course, partly to divert suspicion from himself. In a subsequent plea bargain, Murphy pleaded guilty to a firearms charge and was sentenced on 11 October 1977 to twelve years&#x27; imprisonment. Another Catholic man killed by the gang was Cornelius &quot;Con&quot; Neeson (49), attacked with a hatchet by Moore and McAllister on the Cliftonville Road late on 1 August 1976. He died a few hours later. One of Neeson&#x27;s brothers, speaking in 1994, declared: &quot;I saw the state of my brother&#x27;s body after he was butchered on the street. I said, &#x27;That is not my brother&#x27;. Even our mother would not have recognised him&quot;.

Later that year &quot;Mr. A&quot; informed Moore, now the Butchers&#x27; &quot;de facto&quot; commander, of Murphy&#x27;s orders to resume the throat-slashings. Three more Catholic men from North Belfast were subsequently kidnapped, tortured and hacked to death in the same way as before. The victims were Stephen McCann (20), a Queen&#x27;s University student murdered on 30 October 1976; Joseph Morrissey (52), killed on 3 February 1977; and Francis Cassidy (43), a dock-worker who was killed on 30 March 1977. Moore proved himself an able deputy to Murphy, committing the throat-cuttings himself and encouraging the gang to use extreme violence on the victims beforehand. In particular, Arthur McClay attacked Morrissey with a hatchet; Moore had promoted McClay after Murphy had been jailed. The three victims were dumped in various parts of the greater Shankill area. The other gang members involved in one or more of these cut-throat murders were McAllister, John Townsley, David Bell and Norman Waugh. &quot;Mr. A&quot; played a prominent part in the planning of Moore&#x27;s activities.

After his arrest in 1977, William Moore was portrayed in subsequent police accounts as having been in effective control of the Butchers gang during Murphy&#x27;s incarceration. However, a 2017 book on the UVF, citing an unnamed source, argued that John, an older brother of Murphy who escaped prosecution, had been directing the activities of the Butchers during that time.

===Capture and imprisonment===

Late on Tuesday, 10 May 1977, Gerard McLaverty, a young Belfast man whose family had recently left the city, was walking down the Cliftonville Road. Two members of the Butchers approached him and, posing as policemen, forced him into a car where two of their comrades were seated. The gang, who had spent the day drinking, drove McLaverty to a disused doctor&#x27;s surgery on the corner of Emerson Street and the Shankill Road where he was beaten with sticks. He was stabbed, had his wrists slashed a number of times by Moore and McAllister, using a smallish knife, and was dumped in a back entry. Uncharacteristically, he had been left for dead by the gang but survived until early morning, when a woman heard his cries for help and called the police. In compliance with previous orders, news of the assault was given to Inspector Nesbitt. At first he did not attribute particular significance to this message, as the Butchers had left no one alive before; but on discovering the nature of the assault and the use of a knife, he came up with an idea that was to permanently change the course of his inquiries.

Taking advantage of the aftermath of a loyalist paramilitary strike and local elections, Nesbitt had the recovered McLaverty disguised and driven by police around the Shankill area on Wednesday 18 May to see if he could spot the men who had abducted or attacked him. Within a short time he identified McAllister and Edwards, and Nesbitt had a breakthrough that enabled him to widen his net. The next morning he initiated a large arrest operation and many of McAllister&#x27;s associates, including Moore, were taken into custody. At first under intense interrogation, the suspects admitted only to their involvement in the McLaverty abduction but Nesbitt, seizing on McAllister&#x27;s references to the size of a knife used on McLaverty, had his team of detectives press the case, and eventually most of the gang admitted their part in the activities of the Butchers. Further arrests followed and the overall picture became clearer. The salient point emerging was that Murphy, the commander of the unit, was the driving force behind the cut-throat murders and other criminal activities. A number of the Butchers implicated him and his close associates &quot;Mr. A&quot; and &quot;Mr. B&quot; (John Murphy) in numerous paramilitary activities but later retracted these claims for fear of retribution from the UVF Brigade Staff. Lenny Murphy, in prison, and Messrs &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; were interviewed several times in connection with the Butchers&#x27; inquiry but revealed nothing during interviews. Without corroborative or forensic evidence, the state prosecution service decided that they would not face charges.

The rest of the Butchers came to trial during 1978 and early 1979. On 20 February 1979, eleven men were convicted of a total of 19 murders, and the 42 life sentences handed out were the most ever in a single trial in British criminal history. Moore pleaded guilty to 11 counts of murder and Bates to 10. The trial judge, Lord Justice O&#x27;Donnell, said that he did not wish to be cast as &quot;public avenger&quot; but felt obliged to sentence the two to life imprisonment with no chance of release. However, Bates was freed two years after the paramilitary ceasefires of 1994, and Moore released under the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Martin Dillon&#x27;s own investigations suggest that a number of other individuals (whom he was unable to name for legal reasons) escaped prosecution for participation in the crimes of the Butchers and that the gang were responsible for a total of at least 30 murders. In summing-up, O&#x27;Donnell LJ stated that their crimes, &quot;a catalogue of horror&quot;, were &quot;a lasting monument to blind sectarian bigotry&quot;. After the trial, Jimmy Nesbitt&#x27;s comment was: &quot;The big fish got away&quot;, a reference to Murphy (referred to in court as &quot;Mr. X&quot; or the &quot;Master Butcher&quot;) and to Messrs &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. At this time McLaverty lived under police protection in Dublin, where he had been given a covername.

===Murphy&#x27;s release and death===
His sentence for the firearms conviction complete, Murphy was released from prison on 16 July 1982. One day later, his killing spree resumed when he beat to death a local Protestant man with a learning disability in the Loyalist Club in Rumford Street. His body was dumped in a back alley over a mile away. Murphy began to assemble a new gang. On 29 August 1982, Murphy killed Jim Galway (33), a part-time Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldier from the Lower Shankill area, who had been passing information to the UVF and was involved with its Ballymena units. When suspicions of being an informer fell upon Galway, Murphy decided to kill him. Galway was shot in the head at a building site in the village of Broughshane near Ballymena and buried on the spot. His decayed body was not found until November 1983. The location of the body was pointed out in 1983 by a person in custody for other charges. On 5 September, Murphy killed a former UVF prisoner, Brian Smyth (30), in a dispute over money owed for a car. Murphy poisoned the man in a Shankill club before shooting him from the rear of a passing motorcycle as he sat in a car driven by Murphy&#x27;s friend, and leading Red Hand Commando member, Sam &quot;Mambo&quot; Carroll.
Early on Friday 22 October, UDR soldier Thomas Cochrane was kidnapped by the IRA. The next evening, although he had been warned by the UVF Brigade Staff against abducting anyone, Murphy decided to kidnap a Catholic, ostensibly to demand Cochrane&#x27;s release in exchange for the Catholic hostage. He hijacked a black taxi, which one of his men drove to the Falls Road. Joseph Donegan, a middle-aged Catholic on his way home, hailed the vehicle and got in. Murphy immediately attacked the man as the taxi was driven back to the safety of the Shankill area. At a house owned by Murphy in Brookmount Street, Donegan was tortured sadistically by Murphy, who according to Dillon, pulled out all but three of his teeth with pliers. Murphy&#x27;s associate, Tommy Stewart, battered Donegan to death with a shovel. &quot;Mr. A&quot; was party to these events. Murphy telephoned a prominent Catholic politician, Cormac Boomer, to demand that Cochrane be set free. Murphy ordered that Donegan&#x27;s body be removed from his house, but the plan was disturbed by passers-by and the victim had to be dumped in an entry behind the house. After discovery of the body on the morning of Monday 25 October, Murphy and two others were arrested; but without evidence that Murphy had been party to this crime, it was not possible to charge him. Cochrane&#x27;s body was found a week later.

Murphy was assassinated by a Provisional IRA hit squad early in the evening of Tuesday 16 November 1982 outside the back of his girlfriend&#x27;s house in the Glencairn estate (where four of the Butchers&#x27; cut-throat victims had been dumped). No sooner had he parked his car than two gunmen emerged from a van that had been following him and fired a hail of more than twenty bullets, killing him instantly. After several days&#x27; speculation as to those responsible for the shooting, the IRA issued a statement claiming responsibility for what it termed Murphy&#x27;s &quot;execution&quot;:

Lenny Murphy (master butcher) has been responsible for the horrific murders of over 20 innocent Nationalists in the Belfast area and a number of Protestants. The IRA has been aware for some time that since his release recently from prison, Murphy was attempting to re-establish a similar murder gang to that which he led in the mid-1970s and, in fact, he was responsible for a number of the recent sectarian murders in the Belfast area. The IRA takes this opportunity to restate its policy of non-sectarian attacks, while retaining its right to take unequivocal action against those who direct or motivate sectarian slaughter against the Nationalist population.

The location of the murder, in a loyalist stronghold, and the timing of the shooting to coincide with Murphy&#x27;s movements suggested the IRA received help from UVF members who deemed Murphy &quot;out of control&quot; or, equally plausibly, that information had been given by an enemy of Murphy. Dillon suggests that Jim Craig, a leading Ulster Defence Association (UDA) commander whose protection rackets had made him rich and feared in equal measure, fit the description. He was known to have clashed with Murphy on the latter&#x27;s release from prison earlier that year and may have wanted him out of the picture. In support of this theory, Craig was later executed by his UDA colleagues for &quot;treason&quot;, an inquiry having found some evidence of his part in the murder of other top loyalists by republicans.

Murphy&#x27;s family denied he had had a violent nature or was involved with the Butchers: &quot;My Lenny could not have killed a fly&quot;, said his mother Joyce. She accused the police of continual harassment of her son since his recent release from prison and said that he was planning to leave the country as soon as his divorce came through. The UVF gave Murphy a paramilitary funeral attended by thousands of loyalists and several unionist politicians, at which &quot;Mr. A&quot; and John Murphy played leading roles. On his gravestone in Carnmoney cemetery were inscribed the words: &quot;Here Lies a Soldier&quot;. Baroness Blood, a Shankill Road community representative, said: &quot;My father was a soldier. My father fought in two World Wars. They were real heroes. Lenny Murphy wasn&#x27;t a hero; he was a murdering thug&quot;. Murphy&#x27;s headstone was smashed in 1989 and had to be replaced.

==Other activities==
Moore, Bates, and McAllister shot and wounded a member of the Windsor Bar UVF unit a few hours after the murder of Noel Shaw in November 1975. Murphy and Moore shot dead Edward McQuaid, a Catholic man, on the Cliftonville Road on 10 January 1976. On 9 February 1976, Murphy and three of his gang shot and killed two Protestant men, Archibald Hanna and Raymond Carlisle, wrongly believing that they were Catholics on their way to work across the Shankill. Bates was involved in a gun attack on a bar in Smithfield, not far from the Shankill, that killed several people, both Catholics and Protestants, on 5 June 1976. Other Protestants who met their deaths at the hands of the gang included two UDA men. The first was Thomas Easton, who made the mistake of becoming involved in an argument with McAllister, and was ambushed by McAllister at the end of the evening and killed with a breeze block to the head on 21 December 1976. McAllister&#x27;s guilty plea to a manslaughter charge was accepted by the Crown. The second was James Moorehead, a former police reservist, beaten to death by McAllister, Bates and Moore in the toilets of the Windsor Bar on 29 January 1977. McAllister received a minor punishment shooting for the murder of Easton.

Members of the gang also carried out a bombing mission on the Falls Road that killed a 10-year-old Catholic boy on 10 April 1977. Murphy&#x27;s brother John was heavily involved in the latter incident, along with &quot;Mr. A&quot;. The gang used the services of the UVF&#x27;s leading bomb expert James &quot;Tonto&quot; Watt to plant the device, although Watt was not a member of the Brown Bear platoon. Several of the Butchers, including John Murphy, were questioned about a serious assault in April 1977 in Union Street, near Belfast city centre, on a man they believed wrongly was a Catholic. John Murphy received three years&#x27; imprisonment for his part in this incident.

==Aftermath==
Several sources indicate that Mid-Ulster UVF&#x27;s brigade commander, Robin &quot;The Jackal&quot; Jackson from Donaghcloney contacted members of the gang in the Shankill, &quot;Mr. A&quot; in particular, and had them make an attempt on the life of journalist Jim Campbell, northern editor of the &quot;Sunday World&quot; newspaper, in May 1984. Campbell, whose investigations put the spotlight on Jackson&#x27;s activities, was seriously wounded but survived.

All members of the Butchers gang have been released. The first to be freed was John Townsley, who had been only 14 when he became involved with the gang and 16 when arrested. In October 1996, Bates was released; he had reportedly &quot;found religion&quot; behind bars. Bates was shot and killed in the upper Shankill area on 11 June 1997 by the son of the UDA man he had killed in the Windsor Bar. &quot;Mr. B&quot;, John Murphy, died in a car accident in Belfast in August 1998. In July 2000, Sam McAllister was injured in an attack during a loyalist feud.

William Moore was the final member of the gang to be released from prison in August 1998, after over twenty-one years behind bars. He died on 17 May 2009, from a suspected heart attack at his home and was given a paramilitary funeral by the UVF. With Moore now deceased, the only senior figure still alive is &quot;Mr. A&quot;.

In November 2004, the Serious Crime Review Team in Belfast said they were looking into the unsolved death of Rosaleen O&#x27;Kane, aged 33 at the time of her death, who was found dead in her home in September 1976. Her family and authorities believe the Shankill Butchers may have been involved in her death.

McIlwaine, who survived a republican assassination attempt in 1991, has retained his links to the Orange Order and UVF.

==List of victims==
The following is a list of known and suspected victims of the Shankill Butchers.
==Song==
Colin Meloy, lead singer and guitarist for the indie folk rock band The Decemberists, wrote a song titled &quot;Shankill Butchers&quot; recounting the faction&#x27;s grisly exploits.

<text>Odds Ballklubb, commonly known as Odd, is a Norwegian professional football club from Skien. Originally the football section of a multi-sports club, founded in 1894 nine years after the club&#x27;s founding. Most sports other than football and gymnastics were discontinued and the club became dedicated primarily to football. Odd plays in the Norwegian First Division, the second tier of the Norwegian football league system, and holds the record of winning the Norwegian Football Cup the most times with twelve wins, the last coming in 2000. The club was known as Odd Grenland between 1994 and 2012. Founded in 1894, Odd is the oldest football club in Norway. As of 13 May 2017 the club was granted a membership in Club of Pioneers. It then became the first Nordic football club to be granted this membership.

== History ==
IF Odd was founded in 1885, and is thus one of the older sports clubs in Norway still in existence. The name derives from Viktor Rydberg&#x27;s novel &quot;Seierssverdet&quot;, where one of the main characters was a Norwegian athlete called Orvar Odd.

In the beginning, IF Odd was mainly focused on gymnastics, and also had a department for Nordic skiing and track and field. A department for football, named Odds BK, was founded on 31 March 1894. This was the club&#x27;s second effort to do so, some time after English workers at nearby Skotfoss brought the game of football to Skien, and the city decided to buy a football. Odd is counted as Norway&#x27;s oldest football team still in existence.

Odd started a cooperation with the local club Pors in 1994, and changed their names to Odd Grenland and Pors Grenland, in an effort to represent the district of Grenland. In conjunction with the name change, a public limited company named Grenland Fotball was founded. Pors Grenland withdrew from the cooperation in December 2009, and in January 2013 Odd Grenland decided to change its name back to Odds BK because they wanted to be a club for the entire county of Telemark.

Odd won the Norwegian Football Cup in 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906, 1913, 1915, 1919, 1922, 1924, 1926, 1931 and 2000, more than any other team in Norway. In the late 20th century, the men&#x27;s team struggled in the lower divisions for many years, but made it back to the Tippeligaen in 1999 and stayed there until they were relegated in 2007. The team had survived relegation twice; first in 2005 after a dreadful start of the campaign, then in 2006 when the team only survived relegation by beating Bryne in the relegation play-offs. In 2007 the team was relegated to the 1. divisjon after being beaten by Bodø/Glimt in the relegation play-offs. In 2008, with three games still to play, Odd secured the promotion back to the Tippeligaen after winning 4–0 at home against Hødd.

On 25 September 2011, Odd player Jone Samuelsen scored what is claimed to be the longest headed goal ever scored in a match, in a match against Tromsø, when he headed the ball from within his own half of the pitch into Tromsø&#x27;s open goal, the goalkeeper having come forward for a late corner in the match. Norwegian police were invited to measure the distance, and calculated the length as to be 58.13 metres.

==Home ground==
Club&#x27;s home ground is Skagerak Arena (capacity 12,000), has seen the largest crowd (approx 12,500 people) at the 1984 Cup semi-final against Viking, though the official number is 8854. Officially, the highest attendance is 12.436, achieved in the 2015 Europa League play-off against Borussia Dortmund. The stadium was rebuilt to hold a capacity of between 13,000 and 14,000, and was finished in 2008. It is named Skagerak Arena after local sponsor Skagerak Energi.

<doc id="88269" wikidata="Q1141919" url="?curid=88269" title="Crucifix (band)">
<text>Crucifix was an American hardcore punk band from the San Francisco Bay Area, active from 1980 to 1984. They were among the most popular acts of the San Francisco punk scene of the early 1980s. Fronted by Cambodian-born singer Sothira Pheng, Crucifix were distinct among American underground bands for their strong D-beat musical characteristics and anarchist lyrical content and graphic design. The band&#x27;s debut 1983 full-length album &quot;Dehumanization&quot; on Crass Records‘ offshoot Corpus Christi Records, is considered by many critics and fans to be a cornerstone of political punk music. After their breakup, Crucifix’s members went on to form the bands Loudspeaker and Proudflesh.

==Band history==
Crucifix was formed by three members of Subsidized Mess, a short-lived band from Berkeley, California comprising vocalist Christopher Douglas, guitarist Matt Borruso, and Cambodian-born bassist Sothira Pheng. His family had fled their homeland when the Khmer Rouge seized power. The band reconfigured themselves and changed their name to Crucifix with Pheng switching to vocals, Douglas taking over the drums, and Borruso sticking to guitar for the time being while Bryce Kanights joined on bass guitar. This lineup recorded the band’s eponymous five-song debut 12” EP, released by Berkeley-based label Universal Records in 1981.

By the following year, Kanights departed from the band and with the addition of Francis “Jimmy Crucifix” Schmidt on guitar, Borruso moved over to playing bass for the recording of the band’s second EP, a three-song 7” entitled &quot;nineteen eighty-four,&quot; released in 1982 on Crucifix’s own label, Freak Records.

Schmidt then parted ways with Crucifix to be replaced by guitarist Jake Smith for the recording of what would be the band&#x27;s only full-length LP, &quot;Dehumanization&quot;, released by Crass Records imprint Corpus Christi Records in 1983. This album proved a landmark effort for the band and is widely regarded to be their definitive work as well as a cornerstone of American political punk.

After &quot;Dehumanization’s&quot; release, Smith left the band and was replaced by former America&#x27;s Hardcore guitarist Drew Bernstein. After lengthy tours of the United States, Canada, and Europe, Crucifix called it quits on July 13, 1984. A posthumous compilation album of singles and live tracks entitled &quot;Exhibit A&quot; would later be released on Kustomized Records in 1997. When Corpus Christi eventually folded, their album &quot;Dehumanization&quot; was reissued on CD by Southern Records and later Kustomized on LP, CD, and streaming formats.

==Post-Crucifix projects==
Matt Borruso and Christopher Douglas (appearing in credits as Christopher Faith) launched an industrial music project called Loudspeaker and released a 12” single on Flux of Pink Indians’ One Little Indian record label in the UK. The duo later moved to New York City and reconfigured as a noise rock band with various musicians who had played in Pussy Galore, Boss Hog, The Normals, Chrome Cranks, Circle X, Dustdevils, Drunk Tank, and Walldrug. Loudspeaker released several more recordings between 1990 and 1996 through Sympathy for the Record Industry and other labels.

Sothira Pheng picked up the bass again and did double-duty as vocalist in San Francisco punk/hard rock trio Proudflesh with ex-Crucifix guitarist Francis “Jimmy Crucifix” Schmidt. Proudflesh released the three-song &quot;Power Broker&quot; EP in 1988, which would later be included on the compilation &quot;The Rise and Fall&quot; along with all of Crucifix’s early material. Two decades later Proudflesh released their sole full-length album, a self-titled 2006 CD on Wired Gnome Records.

==Legacy==

&quot;Annihilation&quot;, the opening track from Crucifix’s &quot;Dehumanization&quot; LP, has been adopted by several other musicians in the years since the album’s release. Brazilian death metal band Sepultura covered the song and featured it a bonus track on their album &quot;Nation&quot; in 2001. The song was also recorded in 2004 by A Perfect Circle for their third LP, &quot;eMOTIVe&quot;, and the band Orbital used vocal samples from “Annihilation“ for their own song, &quot;Choice&quot;.

<text>The silent majority is an unspecified large group of people in a country or group who do not express their opinions publicly. The term was popularized by U.S. President Richard Nixon in a televised address on November 3, 1969, in which he said, &quot;And so tonight—to you, the great silent majority of my fellow Americans—I ask for your support.&quot; In this usage it referred to those Americans who did not join in the large demonstrations against the Vietnam War at the time, who did not join in the counterculture, and who did not participate in public discourse. Nixon, along with many others, saw this group of Middle Americans as being overshadowed in the media by the more vocal minority.

Preceding Nixon by half a century, it was employed in 1919 by Calvin Coolidge&#x27;s campaign for the 1920 presidential nomination. Before that, the phrase was used in the 19th century as a euphemism referring to all the people who have died, and others have used it before and after Nixon to refer to groups of voters in various nations of the world.

==Early meanings==
=== Euphemism for the dead ===
&quot;The majority&quot; or &quot;the silent majority&quot; can be traced back to the Roman writer Petronius, who wrote &quot;abiit ad plures&quot; (he is gone to the majority) to describe deceased people, since the dead outnumber the living. (In 2023 there were approximately 14.6 dead for every living person.). The phrase was used for much of the 19th century to refer to the dead. Phrases such as &quot;gone to a better world&quot;, &quot;gone before&quot;, and &quot;joined the silent majority&quot; served as euphemisms for &quot;died&quot;. In 1902, Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan employed this sense of the phrase, saying in a speech that &quot;great captains on both sides of our Civil War have long ago passed over to the silent majority, leaving the memory of their splendid courage.&quot;

=== Groups of voters ===
In May 1831, the expression &quot;silent majority&quot; was spoken by Churchill C. Cambreleng, representative of New York state, before 400 members of the Tammany Society. Cambreleng complained to his audience about a U.S federal bill that had been rejected without full examination by the United States House of Representatives. Cambreleng&#x27;s &quot;silent majority&quot; referred to other representatives who voted as a bloc:

In 1883, an anonymous author calling himself &quot;A German&quot; wrote a memorial to Léon Gambetta, published in &quot;The Contemporary Review&quot;, a British quarterly. Describing French Conservatives of the 1870s, the writer opined that &quot;their mistake was, not in appealing to the country, but in appealing to it in behalf of a Monarchy which had yet to be defined, instead of a Republic which existed; for in the latter case they would have had the whole of that silent majority with them.&quot;

In 1919, Madison Avenue advertising executive and Republican Party supporter Bruce Barton employed the term to bolster Calvin Coolidge&#x27;s campaign for the 1920 Republican Presidential nomination. In &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine, Barton portrayed Coolidge as the everyman candidate: &quot;It sometimes seems as if this great &quot;silent majority&quot; had no spokesman. But Coolidge belongs with that crowd: he lives like them, he works like them, and understands.&quot;

Referring to Charles I of England, historian Veronica Wedgwood wrote this sentence in her 1955 book &quot;The King&#x27;s Peace, 1637–1641&quot;: &quot;The King in his natural optimism still believed that a silent majority in Scotland were in his favour.&quot;

== Richard Nixon ==
While Nixon was serving in 1955 as vice-president to Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and his research assistants wrote in Kennedy&#x27;s book &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;, &quot;Some of them may have been representing the actual sentiments of the silent majority of their constituents in opposition to the screams of a vocal minority...&quot; In January 1956, Kennedy gave Nixon an autographed copy of the book. Nixon wrote back the next day to thank him: &quot;My time for reading has been rather limited recently, but your book is first on my list and I am looking forward to reading it with great pleasure and interest.&quot; Nixon wrote &quot;Six Crises&quot;, some say his response to Kennedy&#x27;s book, after visiting Kennedy at the White House in April 1961.

In 1967, labor leader George Meany asserted that those labor unionists (such as himself) who supported the Vietnam War were &quot;the vast, silent majority in the nation.&quot; Meany&#x27;s statement may have provided Nixon&#x27;s speechwriters with the specific turn of phrase.

Barbara Ehrenreich and Jay Caspian Kang later argued that awareness by the media and politicians that there actually might be a silent majority opposed to the anti-war movement was heightened during the August 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, especially in reaction to the widely broadcast violence by police against protesters and media there. The media reacted indignantly &quot;against the police and the mayor&quot; after journalists and protesters were attacked and beaten by the police, but were stunned to find that a poll showed 56% of those surveyed &quot;sympathized with the police&quot;. &quot;Overnight the press abandoned its protest&quot;, awaking &quot;to the disturbing possibility that they had grown estranged from a sizable segment of the public.&quot;

In the months leading up to Nixon&#x27;s 1969 speech, his vice-president Spiro T. Agnew said on May 9, &quot;It is time for America&#x27;s silent majority to stand up for its rights, and let us remember the American majority includes every minority. America&#x27;s silent majority is bewildered by irrational protest...&quot; Soon thereafter, journalist Theodore H. White analyzed the previous year&#x27;s elections, writing &quot;Never have America&#x27;s leading cultural media, its university thinkers, its influence makers been more intrigued by experiment and change; but in no election have the mute masses more completely separated themselves from such leadership and thinking. Mr. Nixon&#x27;s problem is to interpret what the silent people think, and govern the country against the grain of what its more important thinkers think.&quot;

On October 15, 1969, the first Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam demonstrations were held, attracting thousands of protesters. Feeling very much besieged, Nixon went on national television to deliver a rebuttal speech on November 3, 1969, where he outlined &quot;my plan to end the war&quot; in Vietnam. In his speech Nixon stated his policy of Vietnamization would lower American losses as the South Vietnamese Army would take on the burden of fighting the war; announced his willingness to compromise provided that North Vietnam recognized South Vietnam; and finally promised he would take &quot;strong and effective measures&quot; against North Vietnam if the war continued. Nixon also implicitly conceded to the anti-war movement that South Vietnam was really not very important as he maintained that the real issue was the global credibility of the United States, as he stated his belief that all of America&#x27;s allies would lose faith in American promises if the United States were to abandon South Vietnam. Nixon ended his speech by saying all of this would take time, and asked for the public to support his policy of winning &quot;peace with honor&quot; in Vietnam as he concluded: &quot;And so tonight, to you, the great silent majority of my fellow Americans—I ask for your support. Let us be united for peace. Let us be united against defeat. Because let us understand: North Vietnam cannot defeat or humiliate the United States. Only Americans can do that&quot;. The public reaction to the &quot;silent majority speech&quot; was very favorable at the time and the White House phone lines were overwhelmed with thousands of phone calls in the hours afterward as too many people called to congratulate the president for his speech.

Thirty-five years later, Nixon speechwriter Pat Buchanan recalled using the phrase in a memo to the president. He explained how Nixon singled out the phrase and went on to make use of it in his speech: &quot;We [had] used &#x27;forgotten Americans&#x27; and &#x27;quiet Americans&#x27; and other phrases. And in one memo I mentioned twice the phrase &#x27;silent majority&#x27;, and it&#x27;s double-underlined by Richard Nixon, and it would pop up in 1969 in that great speech that basically made his presidency.&quot; Buchanan noted that while he had written the memo that contained the phrase, &quot;Nixon wrote that speech entirely by himself.&quot;

=== Nixon&#x27;s constituency ===
Nixon&#x27;s silent majority referred mainly to the older generation (those World War II veterans in all parts of the U.S.) but it also described many young people in the Midwest, West and in the South, many of whom eventually served in Vietnam. The Silent Majority was mostly populated by blue collar white people who did not take an active part in politics: suburban, exurban and rural middle class voters. They did, in some cases, support the conservative policies of many politicians. According to columnist Kenneth Crawford, &quot;Nixon&#x27;s forgotten men should not be confused with Roosevelt&#x27;s&quot;, adding that &quot;Nixon&#x27;s are comfortable, housed, clad and fed, who constitute the middle stratum of society. But they aspire to more and feel menaced by those who have less.&quot;

In his famous speech, Nixon contrasted his international strategy of political realism with the &quot;idealism&quot; of a &quot;vocal minority.&quot; He stated that following the radical minority&#x27;s demands to withdraw all troops immediately from Vietnam would bring defeat and be disastrous for world peace. Appealing to the silent majority, Nixon asked for united support &quot;to end the war in a way that we could win the peace.&quot; The speech was one of the first to codify the Nixon Doctrine, according to which, &quot;the defense of freedom is everybody&#x27;s business—not just America&#x27;s business.&quot; After giving the speech, Nixon&#x27;s approval ratings which had been hovering around 50% shot up to 81% in the nation and 86% in the South.

In January 1970, &quot;Time&quot; put on their cover an abstract image of a man and a woman representing &quot;Middle America&quot; as a replacement for their annual &quot;Man of the Year&quot; award. Publisher Roy E. Larsen wrote that &quot;the events of 1969 transcended specific individuals. In a time of dissent and &#x27;confrontation&#x27;, the most striking new factor was the emergence of the Silent Majority as a powerfully assertive force in U.S. society.&quot; Larsen described how the silent majority had elected Nixon, had put a man on the moon, and how this demographic felt threatened by &quot;attacks on traditional values&quot;.

The silent majority theme has been a contentious issue amongst journalists since Nixon used the phrase. Some thought Nixon used it as part of the Southern strategy; others claim it was Nixon&#x27;s way of dismissing the obvious protests going on around the country, and Nixon&#x27;s attempt to get other Americans not to listen to the protests. Whatever the rationale, Nixon won a landslide victory in
1972, taking 49 of 50 states, vindicating his &quot;silent majority&quot;. The opposition vote was split successfully, with 80% of George Wallace supporters voting for Nixon rather than George McGovern, unlike Wallace himself.

Nixon&#x27;s use of the phrase was part of his strategy to divide Americans and to polarize them into two groups. He used &quot;divide and conquer&quot; tactics to win his political battles, and in 1971 he directed Agnew to speak about &quot;positive polarization&quot; of the electorate. The &quot;silent majority&quot; shared Nixon&#x27;s anxieties and fears that normalcy was being eroded by changes in society. The other group was composed of intellectuals, cosmopolitans, professionals and liberals, those willing to &quot;live and let live.&quot; Both groups saw themselves as the higher patriots. According to Republican pollster Frank Luntz, &quot;silent majority&quot; is but one of many labels which have been applied to the same group of voters. According to him, past labels used by the media include &quot;silent majority&quot; in the 1960s, &quot;forgotten middle class&quot; in the 1970s, &quot;angry white males&quot; in the 1980s, &quot;soccer moms&quot; in the 1990s, and &quot;NASCAR dads&quot; in the 2000s.

== Later use ==

&quot;Silent majority&quot; was the name of a movement (officially called Anticommunist City Committee) active in Milan, Italy, from 1971 to 1974 and headed by the former monarchist partisan Adamo Degli Occhi, that expressed the hostility of the middle class to the 1968 movement. At the beginning it was of conservative tendency; later it moved more and more to the right, and in 1974 Degli Occhi was arrested because of his relationships with the terroristic movement &quot;Movimento di Azione Rivoluzionaria&quot; (MAR).

In 1975, in Portugal, then president António de Spínola used the term in confronting the more radical forces of post-revolutionary Portugal.

The phrase &quot;silent majority&quot; has also been used in the political campaigns of Ronald Reagan during the 1970s and 1980s, the Republican Revolution in the 1994 elections, and the victories of Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg. The phrase was also used by Quebec Premier Jean Charest during the 2012 Student Strike to refer to what he perceived as the majority of the Quebec voters supporting the tuition hikes.

The term was used by British Prime Minister David Cameron during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum; Cameron expressed his belief that most Scots opposed independence, while implicitly conceding they may not be as vocal as the people who support it.

During Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign, he said at a campaign rally on July 11, 2015, in Phoenix, Arizona, that &quot;the silent majority is back, and we&#x27;re going to take our country back&quot;. He also referred to the silent majority in subsequent speeches and advertisement, as did the press when describing those who voted for his election as President in 2016. In the midst of the George Floyd protests, he once again invoked the silent majority. CNN analyst Harry Enten described that Trump&#x27;s support fits better with the term &quot;loud minority&quot;, based on the fact that neither did he win the popular vote in 2016 nor did he hit 50% in any live interview opinion poll throughout his first presidency. Jay Caspian Kang argues that some politicians and analysts (Jim Clyburn, Chuck Rocha) feel the unexpected increase in support for Donald Trump among blacks and Latinos in the 2020 election reflects a new silent majority (including some non-whites) reacting against calls for defunding the police and the arrogance of &quot;woke white consultants&quot;.

In 2019, the Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, acknowledged the quiet Australians in his federal election victory speech.

In the face of rising opposition, the Hong Kong government often claims there is a silent majority that is too afraid to voice their support, and a group called &quot;Silent Majority for Hong Kong&quot; was set up in 2013 to counteract the Occupy Central with Love and Peace movement. In 2019, when the democratic movement became increasingly violent, the Carrie Lam administration and Beijing authorities appealed to the &quot;silent majority&quot; to dissociate themselves from the radical activists and to vote for the pro-government camp in the District Council elections, which were seen as a &quot;de facto&quot; referendum on the protests. However, with a record turnout of over 70%, the pro-democracy camp won 80% of overall seats and controlled 17 out of the 18 District Councils. A commentator of The &quot;New Statesman&quot; deduced that Hong Kong&#x27;s true silent majority stood on the side of the democratic cause. &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; stated that Beijing had been confident of a huge pro-government victory as a result of a delusion created by its own propaganda.

<text>Edward St. John Gorey (February 22, 1925 – April 15, 2000) was an American writer, Tony Award-winning costume designer, and artist, noted for his own illustrated books as well as cover art and illustration for books by other writers. His characteristic pen-and-ink drawings often depict vaguely unsettling narrative scenes in Victorian and Edwardian settings.

== Early life ==
Gorey was born in Chicago. His parents, Helen Dunham (née Garvey) and Edward Leo Gorey, divorced in 1936 when he was 11. His father remarried in 1952 when he was 27. His stepmother was Corinna Mura (1910–1965), a cabaret singer who had a small role in &quot;Casablanca&quot; as the woman playing the guitar while singing &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; at Rick&#x27;s Café Américain. His father was briefly a journalist. Gorey&#x27;s maternal great-grandmother, Helen St. John Garvey, was a nineteenth-century greeting card illustrator, from whom he claimed to have inherited his talents.

From 1934 to 1937, Gorey attended public school in the Chicago suburb of Wilmette, Illinois, where his classmates included Charlton Heston, Warren MacKenzie, and Joan Mitchell. Some of his earliest preserved work appears in the Stolp School yearbook for 1937. Afterward, he attended the Francis W. Parker School in Chicago. He spent 1944 to 1946 in the Army at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. He then attended Harvard University, beginning in 1946 and graduating in the class of 1950; he studied French and roomed with poet Frank O&#x27;Hara. Starting in 1951, Gorey illustrated poetry books by Merrill Moore for Twayne Publishers including &quot;Case Record from a Sonnetorium&quot; (many illustrations by Gorey, 1951), and &quot;More Clinical Sonnets&quot; (1953).

In the early 1950s, Gorey, with a group of recent Harvard and Radcliffe alumni including Alison Lurie (1947), John Ashbery (1949), Donald Hall (1951), and O&#x27;Hara (1950), amongst others, founded the Poets&#x27; Theatre in Cambridge, which was supported by Harvard faculty members John Ciardi and Thornton Wilder.

He frequently stated that his formal art training was &quot;negligible&quot;; Gorey studied art for one semester at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1943.

== Career ==

From 1953 to 1960, he lived in Manhattan and worked for the Art Department of Doubleday Anchor, where he illustrated book covers, added illustrations to text, and provided typographic design. He illustrated works as diverse as Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;, H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, and T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Old Possum&#x27;s Book of Practical Cats&quot;. Throughout his career, he illustrated over 200 book covers for Doubleday Anchor, Random House&#x27;s Looking Glass Library, Bobbs-Merrill, and as a freelance artist. In later years he produced cover illustrations and interior artwork for many children&#x27;s books by John Bellairs, as well as books begun by Bellairs and continued by Brad Strickland after Bellairs&#x27; death.

His first independent work, &quot;The Unstrung Harp&quot;, was published in 1953. He also published under various pen names, some of which were anagrams of his first and last names, such as Ogdred Weary, Dogear Wryde, Ms. Regera Dowdy, and dozens more. His books also feature the names Eduard Blutig (&quot;Edward Gory&quot;), a German-language pun on his own name, and O. Müde (German for O. Weary).

At the prompting of Harry Stanton, an editor and vice president at Addison-Wesley, Gorey collaborated on a number of works (and continued a lifelong correspondence) with Peter F. Neumeyer.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; credits bookstore owner Andreas Brown and his store, the Gotham Book Mart, with launching Gorey&#x27;s career: &quot;It became the central clearing house for Mr. Gorey, presenting exhibitions of his work in the store&#x27;s gallery and eventually turning him into an international celebrity.&quot;

Gorey&#x27;s illustrated (and sometimes wordless) books, with their vaguely ominous air and ostensibly Victorian and Edwardian settings, have long had a cult following. He made a notable impact on the world of theater with his designs for the 1977 Broadway revival of &quot;Dracula&quot;, for which he won the Tony Award for Best Costume Design and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Scenic Design. In 1980, Gorey became particularly well known for his animated introduction to the PBS series &quot;Mystery!&quot; In the introduction of each &quot;Mystery!&quot; episode, host Vincent Price would welcome viewers to &quot;Gorey Mansion&quot;.
Because of the settings and style of Gorey&#x27;s work, many people have assumed he was British; in fact, he only left the U.S. once, for a visit to the Scottish Hebrides. In later years, he lived year-round in Yarmouth Port, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, where he wrote and directed numerous evening-length entertainments, often featuring his own papier-mâché puppets, an ensemble known as Le Theatricule Stoique. The first of these productions, &quot;Lost Shoelaces&quot;, premiered in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, on August 13, 1987. The last was &quot;The White Canoe: an Opera Seria for Hand Puppets&quot;, for which Gorey wrote the libretto, with a score by the composer Daniel James Wolf. The opera, which was based on Thomas Moore&#x27;s poem &quot;The Lake of the Dismal Swamp&quot;, was performed under the direction of Carol Verburg, a close friend and neighbor of the artist, after Gorey passed away. Herbert Senn and Helen Pond, two renowned set designers, created a puppet stage for the opera. In the early 1970s, Gorey wrote an unproduced screenplay for a silent film, &quot;The Black Doll&quot;.

After Gorey&#x27;s death, one of his executors, Andreas Brown, turned up a large cache of unpublished work, both complete and incomplete. Brown described the find as &quot;ample material for many future books and for plays based on his work&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Gorey was noted for his love of the New York City Ballet. He attended every performance and some rehearsals for 25 years.

Critic David Ehrenstein, writing in &quot;Gay City News&quot;, asserts that Gorey was discreet about his sexuality in the &quot;Don’t Ask/Don’t Tell era&quot; of the 1950s. &quot;Stonewall changed all that—making gay a discussable mainstream topic,&quot; writes Ehrenstein. &quot;But it didn&#x27;t change things for Gorey. To those in the know, his sensibility was clearly gay, but his sexual life was as covert as his self was overt.&quot; By contrast, the critic Gabrielle Bellot argues that Gorey, &quot;when pressed by interviewers about his sexuality ... declined to give clear answers, except during a 1980 conversation with Lisa Solod, wherein he claimed to be asexual—making Gorey one of few openly asexual writers even today.&quot; (Gorey himself did not use the term asexual in the Solod interview.)

Alexander Theroux states that when Gorey was pressed on the matter of his sexual orientation by &quot;a rude &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reporter,&quot; he replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t even know.&quot; Theroux is referring to Lisa Solod&#x27;s September 1980 &quot;Boston&quot; magazine interview with Gorey (&quot;Edward Gorey: The Cape&#x27;s master teller of macabre tales discusses death, decadence, and homosexuality&quot;). Gorey&#x27;s exact words were rather: &quot;Well, I&#x27;m neither one thing nor the other particularly. I suppose I&#x27;m gay. But I don&#x27;t really identify with it much. I am fortunate in that I am apparently reasonably undersexed or something. I do not spend my life picking up people on the streets. I was always reluctant to go to the movies with one of my friends because I always expected the police to come and haul him out of the loo at one point or the other. I know people who lead really &quot;outrageous&quot; lives. I&#x27;ve never said I was gay, and I&#x27;ve never said I wasn&#x27;t. A lot of people would say that I wasn&#x27;t because I never do anything about it.&quot; Shortly thereafter, he says, &quot;What I&#x27;m trying to say is that I am a person before I am anything else.&quot;

Gorey&#x27;s remark &quot;I suppose I&#x27;m gay&quot; from the Solod interview was omitted when the interview appeared in &quot;Ascending Peculiarity&quot;, a collection of interviews with Gorey edited by the art critic Karen Wilkin.

From 1995 to his death in April 2000, Gorey was the subject of a &quot;cinéma vérité&quot;–style documentary directed by Christopher Seufert. (As of 2024 the finished film and accompanying book are in post-production.) He was once interviewed on &quot;Tribute to Edward Gorey,&quot; a community, public-access television cable show produced by artist and friend Joyce Kenney. Gorey served as a volunteer camera-person and master control operator at that same public access station, where he designed community bulletin graphics. His house, in Yarmouthport, Cape Cod, is the subject of a photography book entitled &quot;Elephant House: Or, the Home of Edward Gorey,&quot; with photographs and text by Kevin McDermott. The house is now the Edward Gorey House Museum.

Gorey left the bulk of his estate to a charitable trust benefiting cats and dogs, as well as other species, including bats and insects.

== Style ==
Gorey is typically described as an illustrator. His books may be found in the humor and cartoon sections of major bookstores, but books such as &quot;The Object Lesson&quot; have earned serious critical respect as works of surrealist art. His experimentation—creating books that were wordless, books that were literally matchbox-sized, pop-up books, books entirely populated by inanimate objects—complicates matters still further. As Gorey told Lisa Solod of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;Ideally, if anything were any good, it would be indescribable.&quot; Gorey classified his own work as literary nonsense, the genre made most famous by Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear.

In response to being called gothic, he stated, &quot;If you&#x27;re doing nonsense it has to be rather awful, because there&#x27;d be no point. I&#x27;m trying to think if there&#x27;s sunny nonsense. Sunny, funny nonsense for children—oh, how boring, boring, boring. As Schubert said, there is no happy music. And that&#x27;s true, there really isn&#x27;t. And there&#x27;s probably no happy nonsense, either.&quot;

== Bibliography ==
The exact number of books that Edward Gorey illustrated for other authors is unknown and estimated to be over 500. A few of the authors Gorey illustrated were Merrill Moore, Samuel Beckett, Edward Lear, John Bellairs, H. G. Wells, Alain-Fournier, Charles Dickens, T. S. Eliot, Hilaire Belloc, Muriel Spark, Florence Parry Heide, John Updike, John Ciardi, Felicia Lamport and Joan Aiken.

Gorey was very fond of word games, particularly anagrams. He wrote many of his books under pseudonyms that usually were anagrams of his own name (most famously Ogdred Weary). Some of them are listed below, with the corresponding book title(s). Eduard Blutig is also a word game: &quot;Blutig&quot; is German (the language from which these two books purportedly were translated) for &quot;bloody&quot; or &quot;gory&quot;.

* Ogdred Weary &quot;The Curious Sofa&quot;, &quot;The Beastly Baby&quot;
* Mrs. Regera Dowdy &quot;The Pious Infant&quot;, &quot;The Izzard Book&quot;

* Raddory Gewe &quot;The Eleventh Episode&quot;
* Dogear Wryde &quot;The Broken Spoke/Cycling Cards&quot;

== Legacy ==
Gorey has become an iconic figure in the goth subculture. Events themed on his works and decorated in his characteristic style are common in the more Victorian-styled elements of the subculture, notably the Edwardian costume balls held annually in San Francisco and Los Angeles, which include performances based on his works. The &quot;Edwardian&quot; in this case refers less to the Edwardian period of history than to Gorey, whose characters are depicted as wearing fashion styles ranging from the mid-nineteenth century to the 1930s.

Among the authors influenced by Gorey&#x27;s work is Daniel Handler, who, under the pseudonym &quot;Lemony Snicket&quot;, wrote the gothic children&#x27;s book series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;. Shortly before Gorey&#x27;s death, Handler sent a copy of the series&#x27;s first two novels to him, with a letter &quot;saying how much I admired his work, and how much I hoped that he would forgive what I&#x27;d stolen from him.&quot;

Director Mark Romanek&#x27;s music video for the Nine Inch Nails song &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot; was designed specifically to resemble a Gorey book, with familiar Gorey elements including oversized urns, topiary plants, and glum, pale characters in full Edwardian costume. Also, Caitlín R. Kiernan has published a short story entitled &quot;A Story for Edward Gorey&quot; (&quot;Tales of Pain and Wonder&quot;, 2000), which features Gorey&#x27;s black doll.

A more direct link to Gorey&#x27;s influence on the music world is evident in &quot;The Gorey End&quot;, an album recorded in 2003 by The Tiger Lillies and the Kronos Quartet. This album was a collaboration with Gorey, who liked previous work by The Tiger Lillies so much that he sent them a large box of his unpublished works, which were then adapted and turned into songs. Gorey died before hearing the finished album.

In 1976, jazz composer Michael Mantler recorded an album called &quot;The Hapless Child&quot; (Watt/ECM) with Robert Wyatt, Terje Rypdal, Carla Bley, and Jack DeJohnette. It contains musical adaptations of &quot;The Sinking Spell&quot;, &quot;The Object Lesson&quot;, &quot;The Insect God&quot;, &quot;The Doubtful Guest&quot;, &quot;The Remembered Visit&quot;, and &quot;The Hapless Child&quot;. The last three songs also have been published on his 1987 &quot;Live&quot; album with Jack Bruce, Rick Fenn, and Nick Mason.

The opening titles of the PBS series &quot;Mystery!&quot; was original art by Gorey, in an animated sequence co-directed by Derek Lamb.

In the last few decades of his life, Gorey merchandise became quite popular, with stuffed dolls, cups, stickers, posters, and other items available at malls around the United States. In 2002, a book of his interviews entitled &quot;Ascending Peculiarity: Edward Gorey on Edward Gorey&quot; was released by author Karen Wilkin.

In 2007, The Jim Henson Company announced plans to produce a feature film based on &quot;The Doubtful Guest&quot; to be directed by Brad Peyton. No release date was given and there has been no further information since the announcement. The project was later announced again in 2021, with it now also being produced by Amblin Entertainment.

The online journal &quot;Goreyesque&quot; publishes artwork, stories, and poems in the spirit of Edward Gorey&#x27;s work. The journal is co-sponsored by the Department of Creative Writing at Columbia College Chicago and Loyola University Chicago. &quot;Goreyesque&quot; was launched in tandem with the Chicago debut of two Gorey collections: &quot;Elegant Enigmas: The Art of Edward Gorey&quot; and &quot;G is for Gorey&quot;. The collections were shown at the Loyola University Museum of Art (LUMA) in Chicago, Illinois from February 15 to June 15, 2014. &quot;Goreyesque&quot; features the work of both emerging talents and seasoned professionals, such as writers Sam Weller and Joe Meno.

<doc id="88277" wikidata="Q5113910" url="?curid=88277" title="Chromosome 15q trisomy">
<text>Chromosome 15q duplication is an extremely rare genetic disorder in which there is an excess copy of a segment of DNA found on the long (&quot;q&quot;) arm of human chromosome 15. As a result, affected cells contain a total of 3 copies of the duplicated bases, instead of the usual 2 copies - one inherited from the mother and one from the father - found in a normal human diploid genome.

==Signs and symptoms==
The disorder is primarily characterized by growth abnormalities, which range from growth retardation to accelerated growth, intellectual disability, and distinctive malformations of the head and face. Additional abnormalities may involve malformation of the skeleton, spine and neck; fingers and/or toes; genitals (particularly in males); and, in some cases, heart problems and seizures.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of partial trisomy 15q can be made prenatally or postnatally.

The method used for precise diagnosis depends on a number of factors, including the size of the segment of duplicated material, its location, its orientation (inverted), and others.

==Treatment==
The condition is incurable and treatment is based on alleviating symptoms.

==Epidemiology==
C15 trisomy affects twice as many males as females. Fewer than 50 cases have been reported.

<text>Hautes-Pyrénées (; Gascon/Occitan: &quot;Nauts Pirenèus / Hauts Pirenèus&quot; [&#x27;awts piɾeˈnɛʊs]; ; [&#x27;alts piɾiˈneʊs]; ) is a department in the region of Occitania, southwestern France. The department is bordered by Pyrénées-Atlantiques to the west, Gers to the north, Haute-Garonne to the east, as well by the Spanish province of Huesca in the autonomous community of Aragon to the south. In 2019, its population was 229,567; its prefecture is Tarbes. It is named after the Pyrenees mountain range.

==History==
Historically the area broadly covered by the &quot;département&quot; known as Bigorre, a territory at times independent but later part of Gascony province. Large parts of the area were held by the English after the Treaty of Brétigny, 1360. In the 16th century, it was part of the Huguenot domain of the monarchs of Navarre, brought to France by Henri IV. For its early history, see Bigorre and Gascony.

The &quot;département&quot; of Hautes-Pyrénées was created at the time of the French Revolution, on 4 March 1790, through the influence of French politician Bertrand Barère, a member of the Convention.

==Geography==

Hautes-Pyrénées consists of several distinct geographical areas. The southern portion, along the border with Spain, consists of mountains such as the Vignemale, the Pic du Midi de Bigorre, and the Neouvielle and Arbizon ranges. A second area consists of low-altitude rolling hills. The northern part of the &quot;département&quot; consists of largely flat agricultural land. Hautes-Pyrénées has two small territorial exclaves—a remnant from the Middle Ages—located within the neighboring &quot;département&quot; of Pyrénées-Atlantiques. The southern part of the department is sparsely populated and typically have higher elevations while the northern part of the department is highly urbanised and typically have lower elevations than the southern part.

===Principal towns===

The greater Tarbes area is the economic and administrative focus of the &quot;département&quot;, while Lourdes, the second-biggest city in Hautes-Pyrénées, is dedicated almost exclusively to the religious pilgrimage industry. As of 2019, there are 7 communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants:
== Demographics ==
Population development since 1801:

==Politics==

The president of the Departmental Council is Michel Pélieu, first elected in 2011.

===Current National Assembly Representatives===

== Tourism ==
The Western Pyrenees National Park covers a significant area, and includes well-known attractions such as the Cirque de Gavarnie and the Pont d&#x27;Espagne. The entire area is a favorite destination of hikers and mountain enthusiasts.

The area has been known perhaps since Antiquity for its hot springs, and several towns were built around these, most notably Cauterets, Luz-Saint-Sauveur and Bagnères-de-Bigorre.

A notable lake in the area is Lac Bleu d&#x27;Ilhéou, southwest of Cauterets.

There are a number of popular ski resorts in Hautes-Pyrénées such as Barèges-La Mongie, Gavarnie, Luz-Ardiden, Cauterets, Hautacam, Piau-Engaly and Saint-Lary-Soulan.

The area is a nearly-permanent fixture on the Tour de France&#x27;s itinerary, with significantly difficult passes such as the Tourmalet, the Aubisque and the Soulor.

A jazz festival is held each year in Luz-Saint-Sauveur: Jazz a Luz. Tarbes hosts an annual horse festival, Equestria, and a Tango festival, Tarbes en Tango.

<text>The &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition of 1872–1876 was a scientific programme that made many discoveries to lay the foundation of oceanography. The expedition was named after the naval vessel that undertook the trip, .

The expedition, initiated by William Benjamin Carpenter, was placed under the scientific supervision of Sir Charles Wyville Thomson—of the University of Edinburgh and Merchiston Castle School—assisted by five other scientists, including Sir John Murray, a secretary-artist and a photographer. The Royal Society of London obtained the use of &quot;Challenger&quot; from the Royal Navy and in 1872 modified the ship for scientific tasks at Sheerness, equipping it with separate laboratories for natural history and chemistry. The expedition, led by Captain George Nares, sailed from Portsmouth, England, on 21 December 1872. Other naval officers included Commander John Maclear.

Under the scientific supervision of Thomson himself, the ship traveled approximately 68,890 nautical miles (79,280 miles; 127,580 kilometres) surveying and exploring. The result was the &quot;Report of the Scientific Results of the Exploring Voyage of H.M.S. Challenger during the years 1873–76&quot; which, among many other discoveries, catalogued over 4,000 previously unknown species. John Murray, who supervised the publication, described the report as &quot;the greatest advance in the knowledge of our planet since the celebrated discoveries of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries&quot;. The report is available online as the Report of the Voyage of HMS Challenger. &quot;Challenger&quot; sailed close to Antarctica, but not within sight of it. However, it was the first scientific expedition to take pictures of icebergs.

The expedition, which circumnavigated the Earth, collected data by lowering sounding lines to the bottom of the ocean floor to measure its depth and collect sediment samples, by collecting marine organisms by means of dredges lowered to the ocean floor and trawls lowered into the water at different depths, by measuring temperature at various depths and by collecting samples of seawater at standard depths for chemical analysis. They collected plankton samples and recorded the speed and direction of ocean surface currents. Samples were preserved in brine or alcohol, or dried, then brought to Europe and distributed to various experts to analyze.

== Preparations ==
To enable it to probe the depths, 15 of &quot;Challenger&quot; 17 guns were removed and its spars reduced to make more space available. Laboratories, extra cabins and a special dredging platform were installed. &quot;Challenger&quot; used mainly sail power during the expedition; the steam engine was used only for dragging the dredge, station-keeping while taking soundings, and entering and leaving ports. It was loaded with specimen jars, filled with alcohol for preservation of samples, microscopes and chemical apparatus, trawls and dredges, thermometers, barometers, water sampling bottles, sounding leads, devices to collect sediment from the sea bed and great lengths of rope with which to suspend the equipment into the ocean depths.

Because of the novelty of the expedition, some of the equipment was invented or specially modified for the occasion. It carried of Italian hemp rope for sounding.

== Expedition ==

On its landmark journey circumnavigating the globe, 492 deep sea soundings, 133 bottom dredges, 151 open water trawls and 263 serial water temperature observations were taken. About 4,700 new species of marine life were discovered.

The scientific work was conducted by Wyville Thomson, John Murray, John Young Buchanan, Henry Nottidge Moseley, and Rudolf von Willemoes-Suhm. Frank Evers Bed was appointed prosector. The official expedition artist was John James Wild. As well as Nares and Maclear, others that were part of the naval crew included Pelham Aldrich, George Granville Campbell, and Andrew Francis Balfour (one of the sons of Scottish botanist John Hutton Balfour). Also among the officers was Thomas Henry Tizard, who had carried out important hydrographic observations on previous voyages. Though he was not among the civilian scientific staff, Tizard would later help write the official account of the expedition, and also become a Fellow of the Royal Society.

The original ship&#x27;s complement included 21 officers and around 216 crew members. By the end of the voyage, this had been reduced to 144 due to deaths, desertions, personnel being left ashore due to illness, and planned departures.

&quot;Challenger&quot; reached Hong Kong in December 1874, at which point Nares and Aldrich left the ship to take part in the British Arctic Expedition. The new captain was Frank Tourle Thomson. The second-in-command, and the most senior officer present throughout the entire expedition, was Commander John Maclear. Willemoes-Suhm died and was buried at sea on the voyage to Tahiti. Lords Campbell and Balfour left the ship in Valparaiso, Chile, after being promoted.
The first leg of the expedition took the ship from Portsmouth (December 1872) south to Lisbon (January 1873) and then on to Gibraltar. The next stops were Madeira and the Canary Islands (both February 1873). The period from February to July 1873 was spent crossing the Atlantic westwards from the Canary Islands to the Virgin Islands, then heading north to the North Atlantic archipelago and Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda (home base of the North America and West Indies Station), east to the Azores, back to Madeira, and then south to the Cape Verde Islands. During this period, there was a detour in April and May 1873, sailing from Bermuda north to Halifax and back, crossing the Gulf Stream twice with the reverse journey crossing further to the east.

After leaving the Cape Verde Islands in August 1873, the expedition initially sailed south-east and then headed west to reach St Paul&#x27;s Rocks. From here, the route went south across the equator to Fernando de Noronha during September 1873, and onwards that same month to Bahia (now called Salvador) in Brazil. The period from September to October 1873 was spent crossing the Atlantic from Bahia to the Cape of Good Hope, touching at Tristan da Cunha on the way.
December 1873 to February 1874 was spent sailing on a roughly south-eastern track from the Cape of Good Hope to the parallel of 60 degrees south. The islands visited during this period were the Prince Edward Islands, the Crozet Islands, the Kerguelen Islands, and Heard Island. February 1874 was spent travelling south and then generally eastwards in the vicinity of the Antarctic Circle, with sightings of icebergs, pack ice and whales. The route then took the ship north-eastward and away from the ice regions in March 1874, with the expedition reaching Melbourne in Australia later that month. The journey eastward along the coast from Melbourne to Sydney took place in April 1874, passing by Wilsons Promontory and Cape Howe.
When the voyage resumed in June 1874, the route went east from Sydney to Wellington in New Zealand, followed by a large loop north into the Pacific calling at Tonga and Fiji, and then back westward to Cape York in Australia by the end of August. The ship arrived in New Zealand in late June and left in early July. Before reaching Wellington (on New Zealand&#x27;s North Island), brief stops were made at Port Hardy (on d&#x27;Urville Island) and Queen Charlotte Sound and &quot;Challenger&quot; passed through the Cook Strait to reach Wellington.

The route from Wellington to Tonga went along the east coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, and then north and east into the open Pacific, passing by the Kermadec Islands en route to Tongatabu, the main island of the Tonga archipelago (then known as the Friendly Islands). The waters around the Fijian islands, a short distance to the north-west of Tonga, were surveyed during late July and early August 1874. The ship&#x27;s course was then set westward, reaching Raine Island—on the outer edge of the Great Barrier Reef—at the end of August and thence arriving at Cape York, at the tip of Australia&#x27;s Cape York Peninsula.

Over the following three months, from September to November 1874, the expedition visited several islands and island groups while sailing from Cape York to China and Hong Kong (then a British colony). The first part of the route passed north and west over the Arafura Sea, with New Guinea to the north-east and the Australian mainland to the south-west. The first islands visited were the Aru Islands, followed by the nearby Kai Islands. The ship then crossed the Banda Sea touching at the Banda Islands, to reach Amboina (Ambon Island) in October 1874, and then continuing to Ternate Island. At the time, all these islands were part of Netherlands East-Indies and are since 1949 part of Indonesia.

From Ternate, the route went north-westward towards the Philippines, passing east of Celebes (Sulawesi) into the Celebes Sea. The expedition called at Samboangan (Zamboanga) on Mindanao, and then Iloilo on the island of Panay, before navigating within the interior of the archipelago en route to the bay and harbour of Manila on the island of Luzon. The crossing north-westward from Manila to Hong Kong took place in November 1874.

After several weeks in Hong Kong, the expedition departed in early January 1875 to retrace their route south-east towards New Guinea. The first stop on this outward leg of the journey was Manila. From there, they continued on to Samboangan, but took a different route through the interior of the Philippines, this time touching at the island of Zebu. From Samboangan the ship diverged from the inward route, this time passing south of Mindanao—in early-February 1875.

&quot;Challenger&quot; then headed east into the open sea, before turning to the south-east and making landfall at Humboldt Bay (now Yos Sudarso Bay) on the north coast of New Guinea. By March 1875, the expedition had reached the Admiralty Islands north-east of New Guinea. The final stage of the voyage on this side of the Pacific was a long journey across the open ocean to the north, passing mostly west of the Caroline Islands and the Mariana Islands, reaching port in Yokohama, Japan, in April 1875.
&quot;Challenger&quot; departed Japan in mid-June 1875, heading east across the Pacific to a point due north of the Sandwich Islands (Hawaiʻi), and then turning south, making landfall at the end of July at Honolulu on the Hawaiian island of Oʻahu. A couple of weeks later, in mid-August, the ship departed south-eastward, anchoring at Hilo Bay off Hawaiʻi Island, before continuing to the south and reaching Tahiti in mid-September.

The expedition left Tahiti in early October, swinging to the west and south of the Tubuai Islands and then heading to the south-east before turning east towards the South American coast. The route touched at the Juan Fernández Islands in mid-November 1875, with &quot;Challenger&quot; reaching the port of Valparaiso in Chile a few days later. The next stage of the journey commenced the following month, with the route taking the ship south-westward back out into the Pacific, past the Juan Fernández Islands, before turning to the south-east and back towards South America, reaching Port Otway in the Gulf of Penas on 31 December 1875.

Most of January 1876 was spent navigating around the southern tip of South America, surveying and touching at many of the bays and islands of the Patagonian archipelago, the Strait of Magellan, and Tierra del Fuego. Locations visited here include Hale Cove, Gray Harbour, Port Grappler, Tom Bay, all in the vicinity of Wellington Island; Puerta Bueno, near Hanover Island; Isthmus Bay, near the Queen Adelaide Archipelago; and Port Churruca, near Santa Ines Island.

The final stops, before heading out into the Atlantic, were Port Famine, Sandy Point, and Elizabeth Island. &quot;Challenger&quot; reached the Falkland Islands towards the end of January, calling at Port Stanley and then continuing northward, reaching Montevideo in Uruguay in mid-February 1876. The ship left Montevideo at the end of February, heading first due east and then due north, arriving at Ascension Island at the end of March 1876.

The period from early- to mid-April was spent sailing from Ascension Island to the Cape Verde Islands. From here, the route taken in late April and early May 1876 was a westward loop to the north out into the mid-Atlantic, eventually turning due east towards Europe to touch land at Vigo in Spain towards the end of May. The final stage of the voyage took the ship and its crew north-eastward from Vigo, skirting the Bay of Biscay to make landfall in England. &quot;Challenger&quot; returned to Spithead, Hampshire, on 24 May 1876, having spent 713 days out of the intervening 1,250 at sea.

== Scientific objectives ==
The Royal Society stated the voyage&#x27;s scientific goals were:
# To investigate the physical conditions of the deep sea in the great ocean basins—as far as the neighborhood of the Great Southern Ice Barrier—in regard to depth, temperature, circulation, specific gravity and penetration of light.
# To determine the chemical composition of seawater at various depths from the surface to the bottom, the organic matter in solution and the particles in suspension.
# To ascertain the physical and chemical character of deep-sea deposits and the sources of these deposits.
# To investigate the distribution of organic life at different depths and on the deep seafloor.
One of the goals of the physical measurements for HMS Challenger was to be able to verify the hypothesis put forward by Carpenter on the link between temperature mapping and global ocean circulation in order to provide some answers on the phenomena involved in the major oceanic mixing. This study is a continuation of the preliminary exploratory missions of HMS Lightning (1823) and HMS Porcupine (1844). These results are important for Carpenter because his explanation differed from that of another renowned oceanographer at the time, the American Matthew Fontaine Maury. All these results of physical measurements were synthesized by John James Wild (i.e. the expedition&#x27;s secretary-artist) in his doctoral thesis at the University of Zurich.

A second important issue concerning the collection of different kinds of physical data on the ocean floor was the laying of submarine telegraph cables. Many transoceanic cables were being laid in the 1860s and 1870s and their efficient laying and operation were matters of great strategic and commercial importance.

At each of the 360 stations the crew measured the bottom depth and temperature at different depths, observed weather and surface ocean conditions, and collected seafloor, water, and biota samples. &quot;Challenger&quot; crew used methods that were developed in prior small-scale expeditions to make observations. To measure depth, they would lower a line with a weight attached to it until it reached the sea floor. The line was marked in intervals with flags denoting depth. Because of this, the depth measurements from &quot;Challenger&quot; were, at best, accurate to the nearest demarcation. The sinker often had a small container attached to it that would allow for the collection of bottom sediment samples.

The crew used a variety of dredges and trawls to collect biological samples. The dredges consisted of metal nets attached to a wooden plank and dragged across the sea floor. Mop heads attached to the wooden plank would sweep across the sea floor and release organisms from the ocean bottom to be caught in the nets. Trawls were large metal nets towed behind the ship to collect organisms at different depths of water. Upon the retrieval of a dredge or trawl, &quot;Challenger&quot; crew would sort, rinse, and store the specimens for examination upon return. The specimens were often preserved in either brine or alcohol. Manganese nodules and sediment, which was later found to contain micrometeorites, was collected from the ocean floor. 

The primary thermometer used throughout the &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition was the Miller–Casella thermometer, which contained two markers within a curved mercury tube to record the maximum and minimum temperature through which the instrument traveled. Several of these thermometers would be lowered at various depths for recording. However, this design assumed that the water closer to the surface of the ocean was always warmer than that below. During the voyage, &quot;Challenger&quot;″s crew tested the reversing thermometer, which could measure temperature at specified depths. Afterwards, this type of thermometer was used extensively until the second half of the 20th century. After the return of the Challenger, C.W. Thomson asked Peter Tait to solve a thorny and important question: to evaluate the error in the measurement of the temperature of deep waters caused by the high pressures to which the thermometers were subjected. Tait solved this question and continued his work with a more fundamental study on the compressibility of liquids leading to his famous Tait equation. William Dittmar of Glasgow University established the composition of seawater. Murray and Alphonse François Renard mapped oceanic sediments.

Thomson believed, as did many adherents of the then-recent theory of evolution, that the deep sea would be home to &quot;living fossils&quot; long extinct in shallower waters, examples of &quot;missing links&quot;. They believed that the conditions of constant cold temperature, darkness, and lack of currents, waves, or seismic events provided such a stable environment that evolution would slow or stop entirely. Louis Agassiz believed that in the deeps &quot;we should expect to find representatives of earlier geological periods.&quot; Thomas Huxley stated that he expected to see &quot;zoological antiquities which in the tranquil and little changed depths of the ocean have escaped the causes of destruction at work in the shallows and represent the predominant population of a past age.&quot; Nothing of the sort came to pass, however; though a few organisms previously regarded as extinct were found and cataloged among the many new discoveries, the harvest was typical of what might be found in exploring any equivalent extent of new territory. Furthermore, in the process of preserving specimens in alcohol, Thomson and chemist John Young Buchanan realized that he had inadvertently debunked Huxley&#x27;s prior report of &quot;Bathybius haeckelii&quot;, an acellular protoplasm covering the sea bottoms, which was purported to be the link between non-living matter and living cells. The net effect was a setback for the proponents of evolution.

== Challenger Deep ==
On 23 March 1875, at sample station number 225 located in the southwest Pacific Ocean between Guam and Palau, the crew recorded a sounding of , which was confirmed by a second sounding. As shown by later expeditions using modern equipment, this area represents the southern end of the Mariana Trench and is one of the deepest known places on the ocean floor.

Modern soundings to have since been found near the site of the &quot;Challenger&quot;″s original sounding. &quot;Challenger&quot;″s discovery of this depth was a key finding of the expedition in broadening oceanographic knowledge about the ocean&#x27;s depth and extent; the depression, the Challenger Deep, now bears the name of the vessel and its successor, HMS &quot;Challenger&quot; II, which in 1951 identified a depth of 5,944 fathoms nearby. Thomas Gaskell, the Chief Scientist on HMS &quot;Challenger&quot; II, observed that the later measurementwas not more than 50 miles from the spot where the nineteenth-century &quot;Challenger&quot; found her deepest depth [...] and it may be thought fitting that a ship with the name &quot;Challenger&quot; should put the seal on the work of that great pioneering expedition of oceanography.The expedition also verified the existence of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge extending from the southern hemisphere to the northern one.

== Legacy ==
Findings from the &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition continued to be published until 1895, 19 years after the completion of its journey, by the Challenger Office, Edinburgh, established for that purpose. The report contained 50 volumes and was over 29,500 pages in length. Specimens brought back by &quot;Challenger&quot; were distributed to the world&#x27;s foremost experts for examination, which greatly increased the expenses and time required to finalize the report. The report and specimens were displayed at the British Natural History Museum from January to July, 2023. Some specimens, many of which were the first discovered of their kind, are still examined by scientists today.

A large number of scientists worked on categorizing the material brought back from the expedition including the paleontologist Gabriel Warton Lee. George Albert Boulenger, herpetologist at the Natural History Museum, named a species of lizard, &quot;Saproscincus challengeri&quot;, after &quot;Challenger&quot;.

Before the &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition, oceanography had been mainly speculative. As the first true oceanographic cruise, the &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition laid the groundwork for an entire academic and research discipline. &quot;Challenger&quot; was applied to such varied phenomena as the Challenger Society for Marine Science, the oceanographic and marine geological survey ship , and the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;.

<doc id="88290" wikidata="Q1196752" url="?curid=88290" title="Traditional pop">
<text>Traditional pop (also known as vocal pop or pre-rock and roll pop) is Western pop music that generally pre-dates the advent of rock and roll in the mid-1950s. The most popular and enduring songs from this era of music are known as pop standards or American standards. The works of these songwriters and composers are usually considered part of the canon known as the &quot;Great American Songbook&quot;. More generally, the term &quot;standard&quot; can be applied to any popular song that has become very widely known within mainstream culture and recorded by many artists.

AllMusic defines traditional pop as &quot;post-big band and pre-rock &amp; roll pop music&quot;.

==Origins==
Classic pop includes the song output of the Broadway, Tin Pan Alley, and Hollywood show tune writers from approximately World War I to the 1950s, such as Irving Berlin, Frederick Loewe, Victor Herbert, Harry Warren, Harold Arlen, Jerome Kern, George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, Oscar Hammerstein, Johnny Mercer, Dorothy Fields, Hoagy Carmichael, and Cole Porter.

==Mid-1940s to mid-1950s: height of popularity==

The swing era made stars of many popular singers including the young Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Jo Stafford, Perry Como, Peggy Lee, Patti Page, David Whitfield, and Bing Crosby. Two notable innovations were the addition of string sections and orchestral arrangements and more emphasis on the vocal performance. The addition of lush strings can be heard in much of the popular music throughout the 1940s and 1950s. 

==Late 1950s to 1960s: decline==
In the late 1950s, rock became a popular and prominent musical style. However, some pop singers who had been popular during the swing era or traditional pop music period were still big stars such as Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, Ella Fitzgerald, Dinah Shore, Dean Martin, and Bing Crosby.

Some of these vocalists faded with traditional pop music, while many vocalists became involved in 1960s vocal jazz and the rebirth of &quot;swing music&quot;; the swing music of the 1960s is sometimes referred to as easy listening and was, in essence, a revival of popularity of the &quot;sweet&quot; bands that had been popular during the swing era, but with more emphasis on the vocalist. Like the swing era, it too featured many songs of the Great American Songbook. Much of this music was made popular by Nelson Riddle and television-friendly singers like Rosemary Clooney, Dean Martin, and the cast of &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;.

Many artists made their mark with pop standards, particularly entertainer, vocal jazz and pop singers such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Doris Day, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Louis Armstrong, Nat King Cole (originally known as a jazz pianist), Lena Horne, Vic Damone, Johnny Mathis, Bobby Darin, Ella Fitzgerald, Carmen McRae, Barbra Streisand, Peggy Lee, Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Andy Williams, Frankie Laine, Nancy Wilson, Rita Reys, Liza Minnelli and Cleo Laine. 

The diverging tastes between the baby boomers and older Americans of the 1960s led to one of the earliest schisms in music radio. Whereas rock dominated contemporary hit radio (top 40), traditional pop formed the basis of middle of the road (MOR). In terms of 21st century radio formats, the top-40 hits of the 1950s and 1960s are played on oldies stations while the traditional pop hits are the province of adult standards (with some exceptions); due to aging demographics, both formats are fading in popularity in favor of classic hits and gold-based adult contemporary, respectively.

==Advent of rock and roll==
With the growing popularity of rock and roll in the 1950s, much of what baby boomers considered to be their parents&#x27; music, traditional pop, was pushed aside. Popular music sung by such performers as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee and their contemporaries was relegated in the 1960s and 1970s to television, where they remained very popular, and to Las Vegas club acts and elevator music. Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra continued to have many hit singles and albums until the late 1960s, however. Nashville country music borrowed heavily from traditional pop sounds in the late 1950s as Music Row sought to limit the growing influence of rock and roll on the genre; it remained popular until both the British Invasion, the deaths of two of Nashville&#x27;s biggest country stars (Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves) in separate airplane crashes, and the growing influence of West Coast country music pushed it aside beginning in 1964.

In 1983, Linda Ronstadt, a popular female vocalist of the rock era, elected to change direction. She collaborated with legendary arranger-conductor Nelson Riddle and released a successful album of standards from the 1940s and 1950s, &quot;What&#x27;s New&quot;. It reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart, won a Grammy, and inspired Ronstadt to team up with Riddle for two more albums: 1984&#x27;s &quot;Lush Life&quot; and 1986&#x27;s &quot;For Sentimental Reasons&quot;. The gamble paid off, as all three albums became hits, the international concert tours were a success and Riddle picked up a few more Grammys in the process. Ronstadt&#x27;s determination to produce these albums exposed a new generation to the sounds of the pre-swing and swing eras.

Since then, other rock/pop stars have occasionally found success recording traditional pop music. Notable albums include Rod Stewart&#x27;s &quot;It Had to Be You: The Great American Songbook&quot;, Willie Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Stardust&quot;, Chaka Khan&#x27;s &quot;Echoes of an Era&quot; and Carly Simon&#x27;s &quot;Torch&quot;.

<doc id="88291" wikidata="Q230626" url="?curid=88291" title="Wendy Hiller">
<text>Dame Wendy Margaret Hiller (15 August 1912 – 14 May 2003) was an English film and stage actress who enjoyed a varied acting career that spanned nearly 60 years. Writer Joel Hirschorn, in his 1984 compilation &quot;Rating the Movie Stars&quot;, described her as &quot;a no-nonsense actress who literally took command of the screen whenever she appeared on film&quot;. Despite many notable film performances, Hiller chose to remain primarily a stage actress.

Hiller won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in &quot;Separate Tables&quot; (1958). Her performance as Eliza Doolittle in &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (1938) earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

==Early life==
Born in Bramhall, Cheshire, the daughter of Frank Watkin Hiller, a Manchester cotton manufacturer, and Marie Stone, she was educated at Winceby House School and Oriel Bank High School and at age 18 joined the Manchester Repertory Company, for which she acted and stage-managed for several years. She first found success as slum dweller Sally Hardcastle in the stage version of &quot;Love on the Dole&quot; in 1934. The play was an enormous success and toured the regional stages of Britain, including Hiller&#x27;s West End debut in 1935 at the Garrick Theatre. In 1937, she married the play&#x27;s author Ronald Gow, 15 years her senior. That same year, she made her film debut in &quot;Lancashire Luck&quot;, scripted by Gow.

==Career==

=== Stage ===
The huge popularity of &quot;Love on the Dole&quot; took the production to New York in 1936, where Hiller&#x27;s performance attracted the attention of George Bernard Shaw. Shaw recognised a spirited radiance in the young actress, which was ideally suited for playing his heroines. Shaw cast her in several of his plays, including &quot;Saint Joan&quot;, &quot;Pygmalion&quot; and &quot;Major Barbara&quot;, and his influence on her early career is clearly apparent. She was reputed to be Shaw&#x27;s favourite actress of the time. Unlike other stage actresses of her generation, she performed in relatively few Shakespeare productions, preferring the more modern dramatists such as Henrik Ibsen and new plays adapted from the novels of Henry James and Thomas Hardy, among others.

In the course of her stage career, Hiller won popular and critical acclaim in both London and New York. She excelled at rather plain but strong-willed characters. After touring Britain as Viola in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (1943), she returned to the West End to be directed by John Gielgud as Sister Joanna in &quot;The Cradle Song&quot; (Apollo, 1944). The string of notable successes continued as Princess Charlotte in &quot;The First Gentleman&quot; (Savoy, 1945) opposite Robert Morley as the Prince Regent, Pegeen in &quot;Playboy of the Western World&quot; (Bristol Old Vic, 1946) and &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; (Bristol Old Vic, 1946, transferring to the Piccadilly Theatre in the West End in 1947), which was adapted for the stage by her husband.

In 1947, Hiller originated the role of Catherine Sloper, the painfully shy, vulnerable spinster in &quot;The Heiress&quot; on Broadway. The play, based on the Henry James novel &quot;Washington Square&quot;, also featured Basil Rathbone as her emotionally abusive father. The production enjoyed a year-long run at the Biltmore Theatre in New York and would prove to be her greatest triumph on Broadway. On returning to London, Hiller again played the role in the West End production in 1950.

Her stage work remained a priority and continued with &quot;Ann Veronica&quot; (Piccadilly, 1949), which was adapted by Gow from the novel by H. G. Wells with his wife in the leading role. She performed in a two-year run of N. C. Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Waters of the Moon&quot; (Haymarket, 1951–53) alongside Sybil Thorndike and Edith Evans. At the Old Vic for the 1955–56 season, Hiller contributed a notable performance as Portia in &quot;Julius Caesar,&quot; among others, including as Helen of Troy in &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;. Other stage work at this time included &quot;The Night of the Ball&quot; (New Theatre, 1955), the new Robert Bolt play &quot;Flowering Cherry&quot; (Haymarket, 1958, Broadway, 1959), &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; (Piccadilly, 1960), &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot; (Lyric, 1963), &quot;A Measure of Cruelty&quot; (Birmingham Repertory, 1965), &quot;A Present for the Past&quot; (Edinburgh, 1966), &quot;The Sacred Flame&quot; (Duke of York&#x27;s, 1967) with Gladys Cooper, &quot;The Battle of Shrivings&quot; (Lyric, 1970) with John Gielgud and &quot;Lies&quot; (Albery, 1975).

In 1957, Hiller returned to New York to star as Josie Hogan in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;A Moon for the Misbegotten&quot;, a performance that gained her a Tony Award nomination as Best Dramatic Actress. The production also featured Cyril Cusack and Franchot Tone. Her final appearance on Broadway was as Miss Tina in the 1962 production of Michael Redgrave&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Aspern Papers&quot; from the Henry James novella.

As Hiller matured, she demonstrated a strong affinity for the plays of Henrik Ibsen, as Irene in &quot;When We Dead Awaken&quot; (Cambridge, 1968), as Mrs. Alving in &quot;Ghosts&quot; (Edinburgh, 1972), Ase in &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; (BBC, 1972) and as Gunhild in &quot;John Gabriel Borkman&quot; (National Theatre Company, Old Vic, 1975), in which she appeared with Ralph Richardson and Peggy Ashcroft. Later West End successes such as Queen Mary in &quot;Crown Matrimonial&quot; (Haymarket, 1972) proved that she was not limited to playing dejected, emotionally deprived women. She later revisited some earlier plays playing older characters, as in West End revivals of &quot;Waters of the Moon&quot; (Chichester, 1977, Haymarket, 1978) with Ingrid Bergman and &quot;The Aspern Papers&quot; (Haymarket, 1984) with Vanessa Redgrave. She was scheduled to return to the American stage in a 1982 revival of &quot;Anastasia&quot; with Natalie Wood, but Wood died just weeks before rehearsals. Hiller made her final West End performance in the title role in &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; (Apollo, 1988).

===Film===

At Shaw&#x27;s insistence, she starred as Eliza Doolittle in the film &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (1938) with Leslie Howard as Professor Higgins. This performance earned Hiller her first Oscar nomination, a first for a British actress in a British film, and became one of her best-remembered roles. She was also the first actress to utter the word &quot;bloody&quot; in a British film, when Eliza utters the line &quot;Not bloody likely, I&#x27;m going in a taxi!&quot;

Hiller followed up this success with another Shaw adaptation, &quot;Major Barbara&quot; (1941) with Rex Harrison and Robert Morley. Powell and Pressburger signed her for &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; (1943), but her second pregnancy forced her to bow out in favor of Deborah Kerr. Determined to work with Hiller, the filmmakers later cast her with Roger Livesey again for &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;m Going!&quot; (1945), another classic of British cinema.

Despite her early film success and offers from Hollywood, she returned to the stage full-time after 1945 and only occasionally accepted film roles. With her return to film in the 1950s, she portrayed an abused colonial wife in Carol Reed&#x27;s &quot;Outcast of the Islands&quot; (1952), but had already transitioned into mature, supporting roles with &quot;Sailor of the King&quot; (1953) and as a memorable victim of the Mau Mau uprising in &quot;Something of Value&quot; (1957). She won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 1959 for the film &quot;Separate Tables&quot; (1958) as a lonely hotel manager and mistress of Burt Lancaster. She remained uncompromising in her indifference to film stardom, as evidenced by her surprising reaction to her Oscar win: &quot;Never mind the honour, cold hard cash is what it means to me.&quot; She received a BAFTA nomination as Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of the domineering, possessive mother in &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; (1960). She reprised her London stage role in the Southern Gothic &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; (1963), which earned her a Golden Globe nomination as the elder spinster sister in a film that also stars Dean Martin and Geraldine Page.

Hiller received a third Oscar nomination for her performance as the simple, unrefined but dignified Lady Alice More, opposite Paul Scofield as Thomas More, in &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1966). Her role as the grand Russian princess in a great commercial success, &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974), won her international acclaim and the Evening Standard British Film Award as Best Actress. Other notable roles included a Jewish refugee fleeing Nazi Germany with her dying husband in &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (1976), the formidable London Hospital matron in &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1980) and Maggie Smith&#x27;s emotionally cold and demanding aunt in &quot;The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne&quot; (1987).

=== Television ===
Hiller made numerous television appearances, in both Britain and the United States. In the 1950s and 1960s, she performed in episodes of American drama series such as &quot;Studio One&quot; and &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; among others. In 1965, she starred in an episode of the acclaimed dramatic series &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; (1965), in which she played Anne Hutchinson, a free-thinking woman charged with heresy in Colonial America. In Britain during the 1960s, Hiller gained critical acclaim for a guest appearance in a 1964 episode of the police drama &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, appeared in the drama series &quot;Play of the Month&quot;, and in 1965 was the narrator for five episodes of the BBC children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Jackanory&quot;, reading the stories of Alison Uttley.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, she appeared in many television films including a memorable Duchess of York in the BBC Television Shakespeare production of &quot;Richard II&quot; (1978), the irascible Edwardian Oxford academic in &quot;Miss Morison&#x27;s Ghosts&quot; (1981) and the BBC dramatisations of Julian Gloag&#x27;s &quot;Only Yesterday&quot; (1986) and the Vita Sackville-West novel &quot;All Passion Spent&quot; (1986), in which she was the quietly defiant Lady Slane. This performance earned her a BAFTA nomination as Best Actress. Her last appearance before retiring from acting was the title role in &quot;The Countess Alice&quot; (1992), a BBC/WGBH-Boston television film with Zoë Wanamaker.

==Personal life==

In the early 1940s, Hiller and husband Ronald Gow moved to Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, where they brought up two children, Ann (1939–2006) and Anthony (b. 1942), and lived together in the house called &quot;Spindles&quot; (now demolished). Ronald Gow died in 1993, but Hiller continued living at their home until her death a decade later. When not performing on stage or screen, she lived a completely private domestic life, insisting on being referred to as Mrs. Gow rather than by her stage name.

Regarded as one of Britain&#x27;s great dramatic talents, she was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1971 and raised to Dame Commander (DBE) in 1975.

In 1984 she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Manchester. In 1996, Hiller was honoured by the London Film Critics Circle with the Dilys Powell Award for excellence in British film. Her style was disciplined and unpretentious, and she disliked personal publicity. The writer Sheridan Morley described Hiller as being remarkable in her &quot;extreme untheatricality until the house lights went down, whereupon she would deliver a performance of breathtaking reality and expertise.&quot;

Despite a busy professional career, throughout her life she continually took an active interest in aspiring young actors by supporting local amateur drama societies, as well as being the president of the Chiltern Shakespeare Company until her death. Chronic ill health necessitated her eventual retirement from acting in 1992. She spent the last decade of her life in quiet retirement at her home in Beaconsfield, where she died of natural causes at the age of 90.

<text>Separate Tables is the collective name of two one-act plays by Terence Rattigan, both taking place in the Beauregard Private Hotel, Bournemouth, on the south coast of England. The first play, titled &quot;Table by the Window&quot;, focuses on the troubled relationship between a disgraced Labour politician and his ex-wife. The second play, &quot;Table Number Seven&quot;, is set about 18 months after the events of the previous play, and deals with the touching friendship between a repressed spinster and Major Pollock, a kindly but bogus man posing as an upper-class retired army officer. The two main roles in both plays are written to be played by the same performers. The secondary characters – permanent residents, the hotel&#x27;s manager, and members of the staff – appear in both plays.

== Synopses==
In &quot;Table by the Window&quot;, Martin, a once-rising politician now turned to drink, is dining with his ex-wife. Earlier he was sent to prison for beating her. She, having remarried, is now divorced a second time, and seeks a reconciliation with Martin. Miss Cooper, the manager of the hotel is his mistress. Still, after an off-stage confrontation with the ex-wife, Miss Cooper helps, with great generosity, to bring about a cautious reunion of the formerly married couple.

In &quot;Table Number Seven&quot;, Major Pollock tries to conceal from his fellow guests a report in the local newspaper of his sexual harassment of women at a local cinema. A repressed and hysterical young woman, under the thumb of her formidable mother, takes his side and falls in love with him. Again Miss Cooper encourages her guests to examine their feelings honestly and face their futures bravely. In an early draft of the play, Rattigan had Major Pollock&#x27;s misdemeanour not as harassment of women but homosexual importuning; the critic Kenneth Tynan commented at the time of the premiere that the version used then was &quot;as good a handling of sexual abnormality as English playgoers will tolerate.&quot;

Tynan also wrote that both plays are about people who are driven by loneliness into a state of desperation.

==Original productions==
The play premiered at the Opera House in Manchester, &quot;Separate Tables&quot; then moved to the St James&#x27;s Theatre in London on 22 September 1954, with the following cast:
* Mrs Shankland and Miss Railton-Bell – Margaret Leighton
* Mr Martin and Major Pollock – Eric Portman
* Mrs Railton-Bell – Phyllis Neilson-Terry
* Miss Cooper – Beryl Measor
* Mabel – Marion Fawcett
* Lady Matheson – Jane Eccles
* Miss Meacham – May Hallatt
* Mr Fowler – Aubrey Mather
* Mr Stratton – Basil Henson
* Miss Tanner – Patricia Rayne

The play was directed by Peter Glenville, with sets by Michael Weight. It opened to good reviews; Harold Hobson called the second play in the double-bill, &quot;one of Rattigan&#x27;s masterpieces, in which he shows in superlative degree his pathos, his humour and his astounding mastery over [the] English language...&quot;. The production was a commercial success, running for 726 performances.

&quot;Separate Tables&quot; was presented at the Music Box Theatre in New York on 25 October 1956. It was a transfer of the London production with the same principal players and many of the supporting cast. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Brooks Atkinson wrote &quot;Since Terence Rattigan has written a particularly fine play, it is only fair that it should be wonderfully well acted.&quot; The production won one Tony award (for Leighton as best dramatic actress) and was nominated for five more: for the play, the direction, and for three of the supporting cast, Neilson-Terry, Measor and William Podmore (as Fowler).

==Revivals==
Among stage revivals of the piece are Peter Hall&#x27;s production at the Albery in London in 1993 with Patricia Hodge and Peter Bowles in the principal roles, and one by the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester in 2006 using the text of Rattigan&#x27;s alternative draft, with the Major&#x27;s lapse as a homosexual one.

==Adaptations==

The 1958 film, with a few extra parts, was adapted for the screen by Rattigan. It starred Rita Hayworth, Deborah Kerr, David Niven, Burt Lancaster and Wendy Hiller. John Schlesinger directed a television film version in 1983, with Julie Christie and Alan Bates as the two couples, with Claire Bloom as Miss Cooper and Irene Worth as Mrs Railton-Bell.

The plays were adapted for television in 1970 as part of the BBC Play of the Month anthology series by Hugh Whitemore. It starred Geraldine McEwan as Sibyl Railton Bell and Anne Shankland, Eric Porter as Major Pollock and John Malcolm and Annette Crosbie as Pat Cooper. Cathleen Nesbitt, who played the role of Lady Matheson in the 1958 film adaptation, resumed the role in this adaptation as well.

<text>Mary Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Cass (May 21, 1924 – March 8, 1999) was an American actress, comedian, game show panelist, and announcer.

As an actress, Cass is best known for originating the role of Agnes Gooch in the 1956 stage and 1958 film versions of &quot;Auntie Mame&quot;, for which she won a Tony Award and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. As a television personality, Cass is best known as one of the resident panelists on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; from 1962 to 1968 when hosted by Bud Collyer, 1969 to 1978 when hosted by Garry Moore and his successors Bill Cullen and Joe Garagiola, and 1990 when hosted by Gordon Elliott. 

==Early life==
Peggy Cass received acting training at HB Studio in New York City and eventually landed the lead role of Billie Dawn in a traveling production of &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;.

==Stage and film==
Cass made her Broadway debut in 1949 with the play &quot;Touch and Go&quot;. She portrayed Agnes Gooch in &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; on Broadway and in the film version (1958), a role for which she won the Tony Award for Best Supporting Actress, and received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. 

She was cast as &quot;First Woman&quot; in the nine-member ensemble of the 1960 Broadway revue &quot;A Thurber Carnival&quot;, adapted by James Thurber from his own works. She played several characters throughout the performance, including: the mother in &quot;The Wolf at the Door&quot;, the narrator of &quot;The Little Girl and the Wolf&quot;, a nameless American tourist (who insisted &quot;Macbeth&quot; was a murder mystery), Miss Alma Winege in &quot;File and Forget&quot; (who wanted to ship to Mr. Thurber 36 copies of &quot;Grandma Was a Nudist&quot;, which he did not order), Mrs. Preble in &quot;Mr. Preble Gets Rid of His Wife&quot;, Lou in &quot;Take Her Up Tenderly&quot; (who was helping to make old poetry more cheerful), and Walter Mitty&#x27;s wife.

In 1961, she played Mitzi Stewart in the movie &quot;Gidget Goes Hawaiian&quot;. In 1964, she starred as First Lady Martha Dinwiddie Butterfield in the mock-biographical novel &quot;First Lady: My Thirty Days in the White House&quot;. The book, written by &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; author Patrick Dennis, included photographs by Cris Alexander of Cass, Dody Goodman, Kaye Ballard and others who portrayed the novel&#x27;s characters.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Cass succeeded other actresses in &quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Water&quot; (as Marion Hollander) and in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Plaza Suite&quot;, and played Mollie Malloy in two revival runs of &quot;The Front Page&quot;. She also appeared in the 1969 film comedy &quot;If It&#x27;s Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium&quot;. In the 1980s, she returned to the stage in &quot;42nd Street&quot; and in the 1985 run of &quot;The Octette Bridge Club&quot;.

==Television and stage==

One of Cass&#x27;s earliest television roles was as Elinore Hathaway in &quot;The Hathaways&quot;, a 26-episode situation comedy that aired on ABC from October 6, 1961, to March 30, 1962. She starred with Jack Weston as suburban Los Angeles &quot;parents&quot; to a trio of performing chimpanzees. Weston portrayed Walter Hathaway, a real estate agent, and Cass was his zany wife, &quot;mother&quot; and booking agent for the Marquis Chimps, named Candy, Charlie and Enoch.

Cass filled in as announcer on Jack Paar&#x27;s late night talk show that aired in the 1970s on ABC.

In addition to her work with Paar, Cass&#x27;s notable television work includes appearances on many game shows, on shows based mainly in New York City. She was a regular panelist on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; from 1960 through its 1990 revival, appearing in most episodes in the 1960s and 1970s. She was also a panelist on the pilot of the 1960s version of &quot;Match Game&quot;.

On &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; and other series, she often displayed near-encyclopedic knowledge of various topics and would occasionally question the logic of some of the &quot;facts&quot; presented on the program. Cass appeared on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; in 1963, and made several appearances on the &quot;$10,000 &amp; $20,000 Pyramid&quot; hosted by Dick Clark from 1973 to 1980, as well as the nighttime version, which was titled &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot; (1974–1979), hosted by her friend Bill Cullen. All three of these versions were taped in New York City. She also appeared in the late 1970s on &quot;Shoot for the Stars&quot; hosted by Geoff Edwards, which was another game show that partnered contestants with celebrities, also filmed in New York City.

In 1983, she appeared in the New Amsterdam Theatre Company&#x27;s concert staging of Kurt Weill and Ogden Nash&#x27;s &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot; as Mrs. Kramer, with Susan Lucci as her daughter, as well as Lee Roy Reams, Ron Raines, and Paige O&#x27;Hara as the titular Venus. In the spring of 1991, she participated in a concert staging of Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Fifty Million Frenchmen&quot; at New York City&#x27;s French Institute Alliance Française as Mrs. Gladys Carroll, singing Porter&#x27;s &quot;The Queen of Terre Haute&quot;.

In 1987, Cass was featured in the early Fox sitcom &quot;Women in Prison&quot;. Aside from sitcoms, she played the role of H. Sweeney on the NBC afternoon soap opera, &quot;The Doctors&quot; from 1978 to 1979.

Cass appeared on the pilot episode of&quot; Major Dad&quot; on September 17, 1989. She portrayed Esther Nettleton, a civilian secretary working on the Marine base for Maj. John &quot;Mac&quot; MacGillis.

==Personal life and death==
On March 8, 1999, Cass died of heart failure in New York City at age 74 at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.

<text>The golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) is a bird of prey living in the Northern Hemisphere. It is the most widely distributed species of eagle. Like all eagles, it belongs to the family Accipitridae. They are one of the best-known birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere. These birds are dark brown, with lighter golden-brown plumage on their napes. Immature eagles of this species typically have white on the tail and often have white markings on the wings. Golden eagles use their agility and speed combined with powerful feet and large, sharp talons to hunt a variety of prey, mainly hares, rabbits, and marmots and other ground squirrels.
Golden eagles maintain home ranges or territories that may be as large as . They build large nests in cliffs and other high places to which they may return for several breeding years. Most breeding activities take place in the spring; they are monogamous and may remain together for several years or possibly for life. Females lay up to four eggs, and then incubate them for six weeks. Typically, one or two young survive to fledge in about three months. These juvenile golden eagles usually attain full independence in the fall, after which they wander widely until establishing a territory for themselves in four to five years.

Once widespread across the Holarctic, it has disappeared from many areas that are heavily populated by humans. Despite being extirpated from or uncommon in some of its former range, the species is still widespread, being present in sizeable stretches of Eurasia, North America, and parts of North Africa. It is the largest and least populous of the five species of true accipitrid to occur as a breeding species in both the Palearctic and the Nearctic.

For centuries, this species has been one of the most highly regarded birds used in falconry. Because of its hunting prowess, the golden eagle is regarded with great mystic reverence in some ancient, tribal cultures. It is one of the most extensively studied species of raptor in the world in some parts of its range, such as the Western United States and the Western Palearctic.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
This species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Falco chrysaetos&quot;. Since birds were grouped largely on superficial characteristics at that time, many species were grouped by Linnaeus into the genus &quot;Falco&quot;. The type locality was given simply as &quot;Europa&quot;; it was later restricted to Sweden. It was moved to the new genus &quot;Aquila&quot; by French ornithologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. &quot;Aquila&quot; is Latin for &quot;eagle&quot;, possibly derived from &quot;aquilus&quot;, &quot;dark in colour&quot; and &quot;chrysaetos&quot; is Ancient Greek for the golden eagle from &quot;khrusos&quot;, &quot;gold&quot; and &quot;aetos&quot;, &quot;eagle&quot;.

The golden eagle is part of a broad group of raptors called &quot;booted eagles&quot; which are defined by the feature that all species have feathering over their tarsus, unlike many other accipitrids which have bare legs. Included in this group are all species described as &quot;hawk eagles&quot; including the genera &quot;Spizaetus&quot; and &quot;Nisaetus&quot;, as well as assorted monotypical genera such as &quot;Oroaetus&quot;, &quot;Lophaetus&quot;, &quot;Stephanoaetus&quot;, &quot;Polemaetus&quot;, &quot;Lophotriorchis&quot; and &quot;Ictinaetus&quot;.

The genus &quot;Aquila&quot; is distributed across every continent but for South America and Antarctica. Up to 20 species have been classified in the genus, but more recently the taxonomic placement of some of the traditional species has been questioned. Traditionally, the &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles have been grouped superficially as largish, mainly brownish or dark-colored booted eagles that vary little in transition from their juvenile to their adult plumages. Genetic research has recently indicated the golden eagle is included in a clade with Verreaux&#x27;s eagle in Africa as well as the Gurney&#x27;s eagle (&quot;A. gurneyi&quot;) and the wedge-tailed eagle (clearly part of an Australasian radiation of the lineage). This identification of this particular clade has long been suspected based on similar morphological characteristics amongst these large-bodied species. More surprisingly, the smaller, much paler-bellied sister species Bonelli&#x27;s eagle (&quot;A. fasciatus&quot;) and African hawk-eagle (&quot;A. spilogaster&quot;), previously included in the genus &quot;Hieraaetus&quot;, have been revealed to be genetically much closer to the Verreaux&#x27;s and golden eagle lineage than to other species traditionally included in the genus &quot;Aquila&quot;. Other largish &quot;Aquila&quot; species, the eastern imperial, the Spanish imperial, the tawny and the steppe eagles, are now thought to be separate, close-knit clade, which attained some similar characteristics to the prior clade via convergent evolution.

Genetically, the &quot;spotted eagles&quot; (&quot;A. pomarina, hastata and clanga&quot;), have been discovered to be more closely related to the long-crested eagle (&quot;Lophaetus occipitalis&quot;) and the black eagle (&quot;Ictinaetus malayensis&quot;), and many generic reassignments have been advocated. The genus &quot;Hieraaetus&quot;, including the booted eagle (&quot;H. pennatus&quot;), little eagle (&quot;H. morphnoides&quot;) and Ayres&#x27;s hawk-eagle (&quot;H. ayresii&quot;), consists of much smaller species, that are in fact smallest birds called eagles outside of the unrelated &quot;Spilornis&quot; serpent-eagle genus. This genus has recently been eliminated by many authorities and is now occasionally also included in &quot;Aquila&quot;, although not all ornithological unions have followed this suit in this re-classification. The small-bodied Wahlberg&#x27;s eagle (&quot;H. wahlbergi&quot;) has been traditionally considered a &quot;Aquila&quot; species due to its lack of change from juvenile to adult plumage and brownish color but it is actually genetically aligned to the &quot;Hieraaetus&quot; lineage. Cassin&#x27;s hawk-eagle (&quot;H. africanus&quot;) is also probably closely related to the &quot;Hieraaetus&quot; group rather than the &quot;Spizaetus/Nisaetus&quot; &quot;hawk-eagle&quot; group (in which it was previously classified) which is not known to have radiated to Africa.

=== Subspecies and distribution ===
There are six extant subspecies of golden eagle that differ slightly in size and plumage. Individuals of any of the subspecies are somewhat variable and the differences between the subspecies are clinal, especially in terms of body size. Other than these characteristics, there is little variation across the range of the species. Some recent studies have gone so far as to propose that only two subspecies be recognized based on genetic markers: &quot;Aquila chrysaetos chrysaetos&quot; (including &quot;A. c. homeyeri&quot;) and &quot;A. c. canadensis&quot; (including &quot;A. c. japonica&quot;, &quot;A. c. daphanea&quot; and &quot;A. c. kamtschatica&quot;).
* &quot;Aquila chrysaetos chrysaetos&quot; – sometimes referred to as the European golden eagle. This is the nominate subspecies. This subspecies is found almost throughout Europe, including the British Isles (mainly in Scotland), the majority of Scandinavia, southern and northernmost France, Italy and Austria. In Eastern Europe, it is found from Estonia to Romania, Greece, Serbia and Bulgaria in southeastern Europe. It is also distributed through European Russia, reportedly reaching its eastern limit around the Yenisei River in Russia, also ranging south at a similar longitude into western Kazakhstan and northern Iran. Male wing length is from , averaging , and female wing length is from , averaging . Males weigh from , averaging , and females weigh from , averaging . The male of this subspecies has a wingspan of , with an average of , with the female&#x27;s typical wingspan range is , with an average of . This is a medium-sized subspecies and is the palest. As opposed to golden eagles found further east in Eurasia, the adults of this subspecies are a tawny golden-brown on the upperside. The nape patch is often gleaming golden in color and the feathers here are exceptionally long.
* &quot;Aquila chrysaetos homeyeri&quot; – commonly known as the Iberian golden eagle. This subspecies occurs in almost the entirety of the Iberian Peninsula as well as the island of Crete, though it is absent from the rest of continental Europe. It also ranges in North Africa in a narrow sub-coastal strip from Morocco to Tunisia. A completely isolated population of golden eagles is found in Ethiopia&#x27;s Bale Mountains, at the southern limit of the species&#x27; range worldwide. Although this latter population has not been formally assigned to a subspecies, there is a high probability that it belongs with &quot;A. c. homeyeri&quot;. This subspecies also ranges in much of Asia Minor, mainly Turkey, spottily through the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula into northern Yemen and Oman to its eastern limits throughout the Caucasus, much of Iran and north to southwestern Kazakhstan. Male wing length is from , averaging , and female wing length is from , averaging . Weight is from with no known reports of average masses. This subspecies is slightly smaller and darker plumaged than the nominate subspecies, but it is not as dark as the golden eagles found further to the east. The forehead and crown are dark brownish, with the nape patch being short-feathered and a relatively light rusty color.
* &quot;Aquila chrysaetos daphanea&quot; – known variously as the Asian golden eagle, Himalayan golden eagle or berkut. This subspecies is distributed in central Kazakhstan, eastern Iran, and the easternmost Caucasus, distributed to Manchuria and central China and along the Himalayas from northern Pakistan to Bhutan and discontinuing in northeastern Myanmar (rarely ranging over into northernmost India). This subspecies is the largest on average. Male wing length is from , averaging , and female wing length is from , averaging . No range of body weights are known, but males will weigh approximately and females . Although the wingspan of this subspecies reportedly averages , some individuals can have much longer wings. One female berkut had an authenticated wingspan of , although she was a captive specimen. It is generally the second-darkest subspecies, being blackish on the back. The forehead and crown are dark with a blackish cap near the end of the crown. The feathers of the nape and top-neck are rich brown-red. The nape feathers are slightly shorter than in the nominate subspecies and are similar in length to &quot;A. c. homeyeri&quot;.
* &quot;Aquila chrysaetos japonica&quot; – commonly known as the Japanese golden eagle. This subspecies is found in northern Japan (the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido and discontinuously in Kyushu) and undefined parts of Korea. Male wing length is from , averaging , and female wing length is from , averaging . No range of body weights are known, but males will weigh approximately and females . This is, by far, the smallest-bodied subspecies. It is also the darkest, with even adults being a slaty-grayish black on the back and crown and juveniles being similar, but with darker black plumage contrasting with brownish color and white scaling on the wings, flank and tail. This subspecies has bright rufous nape feathers that are quite loose and long. Adult Japanese golden eagles often maintain extensive white mottling on the inner-webs of the tail that tend to be more typical of juvenile eagles in other subspecies.
* &quot;Aquila chrysaetos canadensis&quot; – commonly known as the North American golden eagle. Occupies the species&#x27; entire range in North America, which comprises the great majority of Alaska, western Canada, Western United States and Mexico. The species is found breeding occasionally in all Canadian provinces but for Nova Scotia. It is currently absent in the Eastern United States as breeding species east of a line from North Dakota down through westernmost Nebraska and Oklahoma to West Texas. The southern limits of its range are in central Mexico, from the Guadalajara area in the west to the Tampico area in the east; it is the &quot;Mexican eagle&quot; featured on the coat of arms of Mexico. It is the subspecies with the largest breeding range and is probably the most numerous subspecies, especially if &quot;A. c. kamtschatica&quot; is included. Male wing length is from , averaging , and female wing length is from , averaging . The average wingspan in both sexes is about . Males weigh from , averaging , and females typically weigh from , averaging . The subspecies does not appear to follow Bergmann&#x27;s rule (the rule that widely distributed organisms are larger-bodied further away from the Equator), as specimens of both sexes from Idaho had a mean weight of and where slightly heavier than those from Alaska, with a mean weight of . It is medium-sized, being generally intermediate in size between the nominate and &quot;A. c. homeyeri&quot;, but with much overlap. It is blackish to dark brown on the back. The long feathers of the nape and top-neck are rusty-reddish and slightly narrower and darker than in the nominate subspecies.
* &quot;Aquila chrysaetos kamtschatica&quot; – sometimes referred to as the Siberian golden eagle or the Kamchatkan golden eagle. This subspecies ranges from Western Siberia (where overlap with &quot;A. c. chrysaetos&quot; is probable), across most of Russia, including the Altay (spilling over into Northern Mongolia), to the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Anadyrsky District. This subspecies is often included in &quot;A. c. canadensis&quot;. Male wing length is from , averaging , and female wing length is from , averaging . No weights are known in this subspecies. The coloration of these eagles is almost exactly the same as in &quot;A. c. canadensis&quot;. The main difference is that this subspecies is much larger in size, being nearly the equal of &quot;A. c. daphanea&quot; if going on wing-length.

The larger Middle Pleistocene golden eagles of France (and possibly elsewhere) are referred to a paleosubspecies &quot;Aquila chrysaetos bonifacti&quot;, and the huge specimens of the Late Pleistocene of Liko Cave (Crete) have been named &quot;Aquila chrysaetos simurgh&quot; (Weesie, 1988). Similarly, an ancestral golden eagle, with a heavier, broader skull, larger wings and shorter legs when compared to modern birds, has been found in the La Brea Tar Pits of southern California.

== Description ==
===Size===

The golden eagle is a very large raptor, in length. Its wings are broad and the wingspan is . The wingspan of golden eagles is the fifth largest among living eagle species. Females are larger than males, with a bigger difference in larger subspecies. Females of the large Himalayan golden eagles are about 37% heavier than males and have nearly 9% longer wings, whereas in the smaller Japanese golden eagles, females are only 26% heavier with around 6% longer wings. In the largest subspecies (&quot;A. c. daphanea&quot;), males and females weigh typically , respectively. In the smallest subspecies, &quot;A. c. japonica&quot;, males weigh and females . In the species overall, males average around and females around . The maximum size of golden eagles is debated. Large subspecies are the heaviest representatives of the genus &quot;Aquila&quot; and this species is on average the seventh-heaviest living eagle species. The golden eagle is the second heaviest breeding eagle in North America, Europe and Africa and the fourth heaviest in Asia. For some time, the largest known mass authenticated for a wild female was the specimen from the &quot;A. c. chrysaetos&quot; subspecies which weighed around and spanned across the wings. American golden eagles are typically somewhat smaller than the large Eurasian species, but a massive female that was banded and released in 2006 around Wyoming&#x27;s Bridger-Teton National Forest became the heaviest wild golden eagle on record, at . Captive birds have been measured with a wingspan of and a mass of , though this mass was for an eagle bred for falconry, which tend to be unnaturally heavy.

The standard measurements of the species include a wing chord length of , a tail length of and a tarsus length of . The culmen (upper ridge of beak) reportedly averages around , with a range of . The bill length from the gape measures around . The long, straight and powerful hallux-claw (hind claw) can range from , about one centimetre longer than in a bald eagle and a little more than one centimetre less than a harpy eagle.

===Colour===
Adults of both sexes have similar plumage and are primarily dark brown, with some grey on the inner wing and tail, and a paler, typically golden colour on the back of the crown and nape that gives the species its common name. Unlike other &quot;Aquila&quot; species, where the tarsal feathers are typically similar in colour to the rest of the plumage, the tarsal feathers of golden eagles tend to be paler, ranging from light golden to white. In addition, some full-grown birds (especially in North America) have white &quot;epaulettes&quot; on the upper part of each scapular feather tract. The bill is dark at the tip, fading to a lighter horn colour, with a yellow cere. As in many accipitrids, the bare portion of the feet is yellow. There are subtle differences in colouration among subspecies, described below.

Juvenile golden eagles are similar to adults but tend to be darker, appearing black on the back especially in East Asia. They have a less faded colour. Young birds are white for about two-thirds of their tail length, ending with a broad, black band. Occasionally, juvenile eagles have white patches on the remiges at the bases of the inner primaries and the outer secondaries, forming a crescent marking on the wings which tends to be divided by darker feathers. Rarely, juvenile birds may have only traces of white on the tail. Compared to the relatively consistently white tail, the white patches on the wing are extremely variable; some juveniles have almost no white visible. Juveniles of less than 12 months of age tend to have the most white in their plumage. By their second summer, the white underwing coverts are usually replaced by a characteristic rusty brown colour. By the third summer, the upper-wing coverts are largely replaced by dark brown feathers, although not all feathers moult at once which leaves many juvenile birds with a grizzled pattern. The tail follows a similar pattern of maturation to the wings. Due to the variability between individuals, juvenile eagles cannot be reliably aged by sight alone. Many golden eagles still have white on the tail during their first attempt at nesting. The final adult plumage is not fully attained until the birds are between and years old.

===Moulting===

This species moults gradually beginning in March or April until September or October each year. Moulting usually decreases in winter. Moult of the contour feathers begins on the head and neck region and progresses along the feather tracts in a general front-to-back direction. Feathers on head, neck, back and scapulars may be replaced annually. With large feathers of the wing and tail, moult begins with the innermost feathers and proceeds outwards in a straightforward manner known as &quot;descendant&quot; moult.

=== Vocalisations ===
While many accipitrids are not known for their strong voices, golden eagles have a particular tendency for silence, even while breeding. That being said, some vocalization has been recorded, usually centering around the nesting period. The voice of the golden eagle is considered weak, high, and shrill, has been called &quot;quite pathetic&quot; and &quot;puppy-like&quot;, and seems incongruous with the formidable size and nature of the species. Most known vocalisations seem to function as contact calls between eagles, sometimes adults to their offspring, occasionally territorial birds to intruders and rarely between a breeding pair. In western Montana, nine distinct calls were noted: a &quot;chirp&quot;, a , a , a , a &quot;cluck&quot;, a &quot;wonk&quot;, a &quot;honk&quot; and a &quot;hiss&quot;.

=== Flight ===

Golden eagles are sometimes considered the best fliers among eagles and perhaps among all raptorial birds. They are equipped with broad, long wings with somewhat finger-like indentations on the tips of the wing. Golden eagles are unique among their genus in that they often fly in a slight dihedral, which means the wings are often held in a slight, upturned V-shape. When they need to flap, golden eagles appear at their most laboured, but this is less common than soaring or gliding––. Flapping flight usually consists of 6–8 deep wing-beats, interspersed with 2–3 second glides. While soaring, the wings and tail are held in one plane with the primary tips often spread. A typical, unhurried soaring speed in golden eagles is around . When hunting or displaying, the golden eagle can glide very fast, reaching speeds of up to . When stooping (diving) in the direction of prey or during territorial displays, the eagle holds its legs up against its tail, and holds its wings tight and partially closed against its body. When diving after prey, a golden eagle can reach . Although less agile and manoeuvrable, the golden eagle is apparently quite the equal and possibly even the superior of the peregrine falcon&#x27;s stooping and gliding speeds. This makes the golden eagle one of the two fastest living animals. Although most flight in golden eagles has a clear purpose (e.g., territoriality, hunting), some flights, such as those by solitary birds or between well-established breeding pairs, seem to be play.

=== Distinguishing from other species ===

Size readily distinguishes this species from most other raptors when it is seen well. Most other raptors are considerably smaller. &quot;Buteo&quot; hawks, which are perhaps most similar to the golden eagle in structure among the species outside of the &quot;booted eagle&quot; group, are often counted among the larger very common raptors. However, a mid-sized &quot;Buteo&quot; is dwarfed by a golden eagle, as an adult female eagle has about double the wingspan and about five times the weight. &quot;Buteos&quot; are also usually distinctly paler below, although some species occur in dark morphs which can be darker than a golden eagle. Among raptorial birds that share the golden eagle&#x27;s range, only some Old World vultures and the California condor are distinctly larger, with longer, broader wings, typically held more evenly in a slower, less forceful flight; they often have dramatically different colour patterns. In North America, the golden eagle may be confused with the turkey vulture from a great distance, as it is a large species that, like the golden eagle, often flies with a pronounced dihedral. The turkey vulture can be distinguished by its less controlled, forceful flying style (they frequently rock back and forth unsteadily in even moderate winds) and its smaller, thinner body, much smaller head and, at closer range, its slaty black-brown colour and silvery wing secondaries. Compared to &quot;Haliaeetus&quot; eagles, the golden eagle has wings that are only somewhat more slender but are more hawk-like and lack the flat, plank-like wing positioning seen in the other genus. Large northern &quot;Haliaeetus&quot; species usually have a larger bill and larger head which protrudes more distinctly than a golden eagle&#x27;s in flight. The tail of the golden eagle is longer on average than those of &quot;Haliaeetus&quot; eagles, appearing to be two or three times the length of the head in soaring flight, whereas in the other eagles the head is often more than twice the length of the tail. Confusion is most likely between juvenile &quot;Haliaeetus&quot; and golden eagles, as the adult golden has a more solidly golden-brown coloration and all &quot;Haliaeetus&quot; eagles have obvious distinctive plumages as adults. &quot;Haliaeetus&quot; eagles are often heavily streaked in their juvenile phase. Juvenile golden eagles can have large patches of white on their wings and tail that are quite different from the random, sometimes large and splotchy-looking distribution of white typical of juvenile &quot;Haliaeetus&quot;.

Distinguishing the golden eagle from other &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles in Eurasia is more difficult. Identification may rely on the golden eagle&#x27;s relatively long tail and patterns of white or grey on the wings and tail. Unlike golden eagles, other &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles do not generally fly in a pronounced dihedral. At close range, the golden to rufous nape-shawl of the golden eagle is distinctive from other &quot;Aquila&quot;. Most other &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles have darker plumage, although the smaller tawny eagle is often paler than the golden eagle (the overlap in range is verified only in Bale Mountains, Ethiopia). Among Eurasian &quot;Aquila&quot;, the adult eastern imperial and Spanish imperial eagle come closest to reaching the size of golden eagles, but both are distinguished by their longer necks, flatter wings in flight, white markings on their shoulder forewing-coverts, paler cream-straw coloured nape patch and generally darker colouration. Juvenile imperial eagles are much paler overall (caramel-cream in the Spanish; cream and tawny streaks in the eastern) and are not likely to be confused. Steppe eagles can also approach golden eagles in size but are more compact and smaller headed with little colour variation to their dark earth-brown plumage, apart from juvenile birds which have distinctive cream-coloured bands running through their coverts and secondaries. Verreaux&#x27;s eagles are most similar in size and body shape to the golden, the body of the Verreaux&#x27;s eagle being slightly longer overall but marginally less heavy and long-winged than the golden eagle&#x27;s. The plumage is very distinctly different, however, as Verreaux&#x27;s eagles are almost entirely jet-black except for some striking, contrasting white on the wing primaries, shoulders and upper-wing. This closely related species is known to co-occur with the golden eagle only in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia. Other booted eagles in the golden eagle&#x27;s range are unlikely to be confused due to differences in size and form. The only species in the genus &quot;Aquila&quot; that exceeds the golden eagle in average wingspan and length is the wedge-tailed eagle of Australasia; however, the wedge-tailed eagle is a slightly less heavy bird.

== Habitat and distribution ==


Golden eagles are fairly adaptable in habitat but often reside in areas with a few shared ecological characteristics. They are best suited to hunting in open or semi-open areas and search them out year-around. Native vegetation seems to be attractive to them and they typically avoid developed areas of any type from urban to agricultural as well as heavily forested regions. In desolate areas (e.g., the southern Yukon), they can occur regularly at roadkills and garbage dumps. The largest numbers of golden eagles are found in mountainous regions today, with many eagles doing a majority of their hunting and nesting on rock formations. However, they are not solely tied to high elevations and can breed in lowlands if the local habitats are suitable. Below are more detailed descriptions of habitats occupied by golden eagles in both continents where they occur.

=== Eurasia ===

In the Arctic fringe of Eurasia, golden eagles occur along the edge of the tundra and the taiga from the Kola peninsula to Anadyr in eastern Siberia, nesting in forests and hunting over nearby arctic heathland. Typical vegetation is stunted, fragmented larch woodland merging into low birch-willow scrub and various heathland. In the rocky, wet, windy maritime climate of Scotland, Ireland, and western Scandinavia, the golden eagle dwells in mountains. These areas include upland grasslands, blanket bog, and sub-Arctic heaths but also fragmented woodland and woodland edge, including boreal forests. In Western Europe, golden eagle habitat is dominated by open, rough grassland, heath and bogs, and rocky ridges, spurs, crags, scree, slopes and grand plateaux. In Sweden, Finland, the Baltic States, Belarus and almost the entire distribution in Russia all the way to the Pacific Ocean, golden eagles occur sparsely in lowland taiga forest. These areas are dominated by stands of evergreens such as pine, larch and spruce, occasionally supplemented by birch and alder stands in southern Scandinavia and the Baltic States. This is largely marginal country for golden eagles and they occur where tree cover is thin and abuts open habitat. Golden eagle taiga habitat usually consists of extensive peatland formations caused by poorly drained soils. 

In central Europe, golden eagles today occur almost exclusively in the major mountain ranges, such as the Pyrenees, Alps, Carpathians, and the Caucasus. Here, the species nests near the tree line and hunt subalpine and alpine pastures, grassland and heath above. Golden eagles also occur in moderately mountainous habitat along the Mediterranean Sea, from the Iberian Peninsula and the Atlas Mountains in Morocco, to Greece, Turkey and Iraq. This area is characterized by low mountains, Mediterranean maquis vegetation, and sub-temperate open woodland. The local pine-oak vegetation, with a variety of Sclerophyllous shrubs are well-adapted to prolonged summer droughts. From Turkey and the southern Caspian Sea to the foothills of the Hindu Kush Mountains in Afghanistan, the typical golden eagle habitat is temperate desert-like mountain ranges surrounded by steppe landscapes interspersed with forest. Here the climate is colder and more continental than around the Mediterranean. 

Golden eagles occupy the alpine ranges from the Altai Mountains and the Pamir Mountains to Tibet, in the great Himalayan massif, and Xinjiang, China, where they occupy the Tien Shan range. In these mountain ranges, the species often lives at very high elevations, living above tree line at more than , often nesting in rocky scree and hunting in adjacent meadows. In Tibet, golden eagles inhabit high ridges and passes in the Lhasa River watershed, where they regularly join groups of soaring Himalayan vultures (&quot;Gyps himalayensis&quot;). One golden eagle was recorded circling at above sea-level in Khumbu in May 1975. In the mountains of Japan and Korea, the golden eagle occupies deciduous scrub woodland and carpet-like stands of Siberian dwarf pine (&quot;Pinus pumila&quot;) that merge into grasslands and alpine heathland. 

The golden eagle occurs in mountains from the Adrar Plateau in Mauritania to northern Yemen and Oman where the desert habitat is largely bereft of vegetation but offers many rocky plateaus to support both the eagles and their prey. In Israel, their habitat is mainly rocky slopes and wide wadi areas, chiefly in desert and to a lesser extent in semi-desert and Mediterranean climates, extending to open areas. In Northeastern Africa, the habitat is often of a sparse, desert-like character and is quite similar to the habitat in Middle East and the Arabian peninsula. In Ethiopia&#x27;s Bale Mountains, where the vegetation is more lush and the climate is clearly less arid than in Northeastern Africa, the golden eagle occupies verdant mountains.

=== North America ===
The biomes occupied by golden eagles are roughly concurrent with those of Eurasia. In western and northern Alaska and northern Canada to the Ungava Peninsula in Quebec, the eagles occupy the Arctic fringe of North America (the species does not range into the true high Arctic tundra), where open canopy gives way to dwarf-shrub heathland with cottongrass and tussock tundra. In land-locked areas of the sub-Arctic, golden eagles are by far the largest raptor. From the Alaska Range to Washington and Oregon, it is often found in high mountains above the tree line or on bluffs and cliffs along river valleys below the tree line. In Washington state, golden eagles can be found in clear-cut sections of otherwise dense coniferous forest zones with relatively little annual precipitation. From east of the Canadian Rocky Mountains to the mountains of Labrador, the golden eagle is found in small numbers in boreal forest peatlands and similar mixed woodland areas. In the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in the United States are plains and prairies where golden eagles are widespread, especially where there is a low human presence. Here, grassland on low rolling hills and flat plains are typical, interrupted only by cottonwood stands around river valleys and wetlands where the eagles may build their nests. 

Golden eagles also occupy the desert-like Great Basin from southern Idaho to northern Arizona and New Mexico. In this habitat, trees are generally absent other than junipers with vegetation being dominated by sagebrush (&quot;Artemisia&quot;) and other low shrub species. Although the vegetation varies a bit more, similar habitat is occupied by golden eagles in Mexico. However, golden eagles are typically absent in North America from true deserts, like the Sonora Desert, where annual precipitation is less than . Golden eagles occupy the mountains and coastal areas of California and Baja California in Mexico where hot, dry summers and moist winters are typical. The golden eagles here often nest in chaparral and oak woodland, oak savanna and grassland amongst low rolling hill typified by diverse vegetation. In the Eastern United States, the species once bred widely in the Appalachian Plateau near burns, open marshes, meadows, bogs and lakes. In Eastern North America, the species still breeds on the Gaspe Peninsula, Quebec. Until 1999, a pair of golden eagles were still known to nest in Maine but they are now believed to be absent as a breeding bird from the Eastern United States. The golden eagles who breed in eastern Canada winter on montane grass and heath fields in the Appalachian Plateau region, especially in Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia, Maryland and Virginia. Most sightings in the Eastern United States recently are concentrated within or along southwestern border of the Appalachian Plateau (30% of records) and within the Coastal Plain physiographic region (33% of records).

Though they do regularly nest in the marsh-like peatland of the boreal forest, golden eagles are not generally associated with wetlands and, in fact, they can be found near some of the most arid spots on earth. In the wintering population of Eastern United States, however, they are often associated with steep river valleys, reservoirs, and marshes in inland areas as well as estuarine marshlands, barrier islands, managed wetlands, sounds, and mouths of major river systems in coastal areas. These wetlands are attractive due to a dominance of open vegetation, large concentrations of prey, and the general absence of human disturbance. In the midwestern United States, they are not uncommon during winter near reservoirs and wildlife refuges that provide foraging opportunities at waterfowl concentrations.

== Feeding ==
Golden eagles usually hunt during daylight hours, but were recorded hunting from one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset during the breeding season in southwestern Idaho. The hunting success rate of golden eagles was calculated in Idaho, showing that, out of 115 hunting attempts, 20% were successful in procuring prey. A fully-grown golden eagle requires about of food per day but in the life of most eagles there are cycles of feast and famine, and eagles have been known to go without food for up to a week and then gorge on up to at one sitting.

The diet of golden eagles is composed primarily of small mammals such as rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, prairie dogs, and marmots. They also eat other birds (usually of medium size, such as gamebirds), reptiles, and fish in smaller numbers. Golden eagles occasionally capture large prey, including seals, ungulates, coyotes, and badgers. They have also been known to capture large flying birds such as geese or cranes. They have also been known to prey on other raptors, including owls and falcons.

== Activity and movements ==

Despite the dramatic ways in which they attain food and interact with raptors of their own and other species, the daily life of golden eagles is often rather uneventful. In Idaho, adult male golden eagles were observed to sit awake on a perch for an average of 78% of daylight, whereas adult females sat on nest or perched for an average of 85% of the day. During the peak of summer in Utah, hunting and territorial flights occurred mostly between 9:00 and 11:00 am and 4:00 and 6:00 pm, with the remaining 15 or so hours of daylight spent perching or resting. Golden Eagles visit water sources for drinking, bathing, and preening, particularly during summer months. When conditions are heavily anticyclonic, there is less soaring during the day. During winter in Scotland, golden eagles soar frequently in order to scan the environment for carrion. In the more wooded environments of Norway during autumn and winter, much less aerial activity is reported, since the eagles tend to avoid detection by actively contour-hunting rather than looking for carrion. Golden eagles are believed to sleep through much of the night. Although usually highly solitary outside of the bond between breeding pairs, exceptionally cold weather in winter may cause eagles to put their usual guard down and perch together. The largest known congregation of golden eagles was observed on an extremely cold winter&#x27;s night in eastern Idaho when 124 individuals were observed perched closely along a line of 85 power poles.

=== Migration ===
Most populations of golden eagles are sedentary, but the species is actually a partial migrant. Golden eagles are very hardy species, being well adapted to cold climates, however they cannot abide declining available food sources in the northern stretches of their range. Eagles raised at latitudes greater than 60° N are usually migratory, though a short migration may be untaken by those who breed or hatch at about 50° N. During migration, they often use soaring-gliding flight, rather than powered flight. In Finland, most banded juveniles move between due south, whereas adults stay locally through winter. Further east, conditions are too harsh for even wintering territorial adults. Golden eagles that breed from the Kola peninsula to Anadyr in the Russian Far East migrate south to winter on the Russian and Mongolian steppes, and the North China Plains. The flat, relatively open landscapes in these regions hold relatively few resident breeding golden eagles. Similarly the entire population of golden eagles from northern and central Alaska and northern Canada migrates south. At Mount Lorette in Alberta, approximately 4,000 golden eagles may pass during the fall, the largest recorded migration of golden eagles on earth. Here the mountain ranges are relatively moderate and consistent, thus being reliable for thermals and updrafts which made long-distance migrating feasible. Birds hatched in Denali National Park in Alaska traveled from to their winter ranges in western North America. These western migrants may winter anywhere from southern Alberta and Montana to New Mexico and Arizona and from inland California to Nebraska. Adults who bred in northeastern Hudson Bay area of Canada reached their wintering grounds, which range from central Michigan to southern Pennsylvania to northeastern Alabama, in 26 to 40 days, with arrival dates from November to early December. The departure dates from wintering grounds are variable. In southwestern Canada, they leave their wintering grounds by 6 April to 8 May (the mean being 21 April); in southwestern Idaho, wintering birds leave from 20 March to 13 April (mean of 29 March); and in the Southwestern United States, wintering birds may depart by early March. Elsewhere in the species&#x27; breeding range, golden eagles (i.e., those who breed in the contiguous Western United States, all of Europe but for Northern Scandinavia, North Africa and all of Asia but for Northern Russia) are non-migratory and tend to remain within striking distance of their breeding territories throughout the year. In Scotland, among all recovered, banded golden eagles (36 out of 1000, the rest mostly died or disappeared) the average distance between ringing and recovery was , averaging in juveniles and in older birds. In the dry Southwestern United States, golden eagles tend to move to higher elevations once the breeding season is complete. In North Africa, populations breeding at lower latitudes, like Morocco, are mostly sedentary, although some occasionally disperse after breeding to areas outside of the normal breeding range.

=== Territoriality ===

Territoriality is believed to be the primary cause of interactions and confrontations between non-paired golden eagles. Golden eagles maintain some of the largest known home ranges (or territories) of any bird species but there is much variation of home range size across the range, possibly dictated by food abundance and habitat preference. Home ranges in most of the range can vary from . In San Diego County in California, the home ranges varied from , with an average of . However, some home ranges have been much smaller, such as in southwestern Idaho where, possibly due to an abundance of jackrabbits, home ranges as small as are maintained. The smallest known home ranges on record for golden eagles are in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia, where they range from . 46% of undulating displays in Montana occurred shortly after the juvenile eagles left their parents range, suggesting that some residents defend and maintain territories year-round. Elsewhere it is stated that home ranges are less strictly maintained during winter but hunting grounds are basically exclusive. In Israel and Scotland, aggressive encounters peaked from winter until just before egg-laying and were less common during the nesting season. Threat displays include undulating flight and aggressive direct flapping flight with exaggerated downstrokes. Most displays by mature golden eagles (67% for males and 76% for females) occur, rather than around the nest, at the edge of their home ranges. In Western Norway, most recorded undulating flight displays occur during the pre-laying period in late winter/early spring. Display flights seem to be triggered by the presence of other golden eagles. The use of display flights has a clear benefit in that it lessens the need for physical confrontations, which can be fatal. Usually, non-breeding birds are treated aggressively by the golden eagle maintaining their home range, normally being chased to the apparent limit of the range but with no actual physical contact. The territorial flight of the adult golden eagle is sometimes preceded or followed by intense bouts of undulating displays. The invader often responds by rolling over and presenting talons to the aggressor. Rarely, the two eagles will lock talons and tumble through the air; sometimes fall several revolutions and in some cases even tumble to the ground before releasing their grip. In some parts of the Alps, the golden eagle population has reached the saturation point in appropriate habitat and apparently violent confrontations are more common than in other parts of the range. Golden eagles may express their aggression via body language while perched, typically the adult female when confronted by an intruding eagle: the head and body are upright, feathers on head and neck are erect; the wings may be slightly spread and beak open; often accompanied by intense gaze. They then often engage in a similar posture with wings spread wide and oriented toward the threat; sometimes rocking back on tail and even flopping over onto the back with talons extended upward as defense. Such behavior may be accompanied by wing slap against the threatening intruder. When approached by an intruder, the defending eagle turns away, partially spreads tail, lowers head, and remains still; adults on the nest may lower head and &quot;freeze&quot; when approached by a person or a helicopter. Females in Israel displayed more than males and mostly against interspecific intruders; males apparently displayed primarily as part of courtship. Five of 7 aggressive encounters at carcasses during winter in Norway were won by females; in 15 of 21 conflicts, the younger bird dominated an older conspecific. However, obvious juvenile eagles (apparent to the adult eagles due to the amount of white on their wings and tail) are sometimes allowed to penetrate deeply into a pair&#x27;s home range and all parties commonly ignore each other. In North Dakota, it was verified that parent eagles were not aggressive towards their own young after the nesting period and some juveniles stayed on their parents territory until their 2nd spring and then left by their own accord.

== Reproduction ==

Golden eagles usually mate for life. A breeding pair is formed in a courtship display. This courtship includes undulating displays by both in the pair, with the male bird picking up a piece of rock or a small stick, and dropping it only to enter into a steep dive and catch it in mid-air, repeating the maneuver 3 or more times. The female takes a clump of earth and drops and catches it in the same fashion. Golden eagles typically build several eyries within their territory (preferring cliffs) and use them alternately for several years. Their nesting areas are characterized by the extreme regularity of the nest spacing. Mating and egg-laying timing for golden eagle is variable depending on the locality. Copulation normally lasts 10–20 seconds. Mating seems to occur around 40–46 days before the initial egg-laying. The golden eagle chick may be heard from within the egg 15 hours before it begins hatching. After the first chip is broken off of the egg, there is no activity for around 27 hours. Hatching activity accelerates and the shell is broken apart in 35 hours. The chick is completely free in 37 hours.

In the first 10 days, chicks mainly lie down on the nest substrate. They are capable of preening on their second day but their parents keep them warm until around 20 days. They grow considerably, weighing around . They also start sitting up more. Around 20 days of age, the chicks generally start standing, which becomes the main position over the course of the next 40 days. The whitish down continues until around 25 days of age, at which point it is gradually replaced by dark contour feathers that eclipse the down and the birds attain a general piebald appearance. After hatching, 80% of food items and 90% of food biomass is captured and brought to the nest by the adult male. Fledging occurs at 66 to 75 days of age in Idaho and 70 to 81 days in Scotland. The first attempted flight departure after fledging can be abrupt, with the young jumping off and using a series of short, stiff wing-beats to glide downward or being blown out of nest while wing-flapping. 18 to 20 days after first fledging, the young eagles will take their first circling flight, but they cannot gain height as efficiently as their parents until approximately 60 days after fledging. In Cumbria, young golden eagles were first seen hunting large prey 59 days after fledging. 75 to 85 days after fledging, the young were largely independent of parents. Generally, breeding success seems to be greatest where prey is available in abundance.

== Longevity ==
Golden eagles are fairly long-living birds in natural conditions if they survive their first few years. The survival rate of raptorial birds tends to increase with larger body size, with a 30–50% annual loss of population rate in small falcons/accipiters, a 15–25% loss of population rate in medium-sized hawks (e.g., &quot;Buteo&quot;s or kites) and a 5% or less rate of loss in eagles and vultures. The oldest known wild golden eagle was a bird banded in Sweden which was recovered 32 years later. The longest-lived known wild golden eagle in North America was 31 years and 8 months. The longest-lived known captive golden eagle, a specimen in Europe, survived to 46 years of age. The estimated adult annual survival rate on the Isle of Skye in Scotland is around 97.5%. When this extrapolated into an estimated lifespan this results in years as the average for adult golden eagles in this area, which is probably far too high an estimate. Survival rates are usually much lower in juvenile eagles than in adult eagles. In the western Rocky Mountains, 50% of golden eagles banded in the nest died by the time they were years and an estimated 75% died by the time they were 5 years old. Near a wind turbine facility in west-central California, estimated survival rates, based on conventional telemetry of 257 individuals, were 84% for first-year eagles, 79% for 1- to 3-year-olds and adult floaters and 91% for breeders; with no difference in survival rates between sexes. Survival rates may be lower for migrating populations of golden eagles. A 19–34% survival rate was estimated for juvenile eagles from Denali National Park in their first 11 months. The average life expectancy of golden eagles in Germany is 13 years, extrapolated from a reported mere 92.5% survival rate.

=== Natural mortality ===
Natural sources of mortality are largely reported in anecdotes. On rare occasions, golden eagles have been killed by competing predators or by hunting mammalian carnivores, including the aforementioned wolverine, snow leopard, cougar, brown bear and white-tailed eagle attacks. Most competitive attacks resulting in death probably occur at the talons of other golden eagles. Nestlings and fledglings are more likely to be killed by another predator than free-flying juveniles and adults. It has been suspected that golden eagle nests may be predated more frequently by other predators (especially birds, which are often the only other large animals that can access a golden eagle nest without the assistance of man-made climbing equipment) in areas where golden eagles are regularly disturbed at the nest by humans. Jeff Watson believed that common raven occasionally eats golden eagle eggs but only in situations where the parent eagles have abandoned their nesting attempt. However, there are no confirmed accounts of predation by other bird species on golden eagle nests. Occasionally, golden eagles may be killed by their prey in self-defense. There is an account of a golden eagle dying from the quills of a North American porcupine (&quot;Erethizon dorsatum&quot;) it had attempted to hunt. On the Isle of Rùm in Scotland, there are a few cases of red deer trampling golden eagles to death, probably the result of a doe having intercepted a bird that was trying to kill a fawn. Although usually well out-matched by the predator, occasionally other large birds can put up a formidable fight against a golden eagle. An attempted capture of a great blue heron by a golden eagle resulted in the death of both birds from wounds sustained in the ensuing fight. There is at least one case in Scotland of a golden eagle dying after being &quot;oiled&quot; by a northern fulmar, a bird whose primary defense against predators is to disgorge an oily secretion which may inhibit the predator&#x27;s ability to fly. Of natural sources of death, starvation is probably under-reported. 11 of 16 dead juvenile eagles which had hatched in Denali National Park had died of starvation. Of 36 deaths of golden eagles in Idaho, 55% were possibly attributable to natural causes, specifically 8 (26%) from unknown trauma, 3 (10%) from disease and 6 (19%) from unknown causes. Of 266 golden eagle deaths in Spain, only 6% were from unknown causes that could not be directly attributed to human activities. Avian cholera caused by bacteria (&quot;Pasteurella multocida&quot;) infects eagles that eat waterfowl that have died from the disease. The protozoan &quot;Trichomonas&quot; sp. caused the deaths of four fledglings in a study of wild golden eagles in Idaho. Several further diseases that contribute to golden eagle deaths have been examined in Japan. A captive eagle died from two malignant tumors – one in the liver and one in the kidney.

==Killing permits==
In December 2016, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed allowing wind-turbine electric generation companies to kill golden eagles without penalty, so long as &quot;companies take steps to minimize the losses&quot;. If issued, the permits would last 30 years, six times the current 5-year permits.

== In human culture ==

Human beings have been fascinated by the golden eagle as early as the beginning of recorded history. Most early-recorded cultures regarded the golden eagle with reverence. In pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica, the eagle was a major Mexica (Aztec) symbol: the tribal and sun god, Huitzilopochtli, had told his people that when they saw the sun (i.e., Huitzilopochtli) in the form of an eagle perched on a cactus whose fruit was red and shaped like a human heart, there they should build their city, Tenochtitlan. The scene—shown on a well-known sculpture, in early manuscripts, and on the present-day Mexican flag—surely had astronomical and geomantic, as well as mythological meaning.

It was only after the Industrial Revolution, when sport-hunting became widespread and commercial stock farming became internationally common, that humans started to widely regard golden eagles as a threat to their livelihoods. This period also brought about the firearm and industrialized poisons, which made it easy for humans to kill the evasive and powerful birds.

In 2017 the French Army trained golden eagles to catch drones. The golden eagle is officially Utah&#x27;s state bird of prey.

== Status and conservation ==

At one time, the golden eagle lived in a great majority of temperate Europe, North Asia, North America, North Africa, and Japan. Although widespread and quite secure in some areas, in many parts of the range golden eagles have experienced sharp population declines and have even been extirpated from some areas. The number of golden eagles from around the range is estimated to be between 170,000 and 250,000 while the estimates of breeding pairs are from 60,000 to 100,000. It has the largest known range of any member of its family, with a range estimated at 140 million square kilometers. If its taxonomic order is considered, it is the second most wide-ranging species after only the osprey (&quot;Pandion haliaetus&quot;). Few other eagle species are as numerous, though some species like the tawny eagle, wedge-tailed eagle and bald eagle have total estimated populations of a similar size to the golden eagle&#x27;s despite their more restricted distributions. The world&#x27;s most populous eagle may be the African fish eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus vocifer&quot;), which has a stable total population estimated at 300,000 and is found solely in Africa. On a global scale, the golden eagle is not considered threatened by the IUCN.

<doc id="88298" wikidata="Q6245302" url="?curid=88298" title="John Lott">
<text>John Richard Lott Jr. (born May 8, 1958) is an American economist, political commentator, and gun rights advocate. Lott was formerly employed at various academic institutions and at the American Enterprise Institute conservative think tank. He is the former president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, a nonprofit he founded in 2013. He worked in the Office of Justice Programs within the U.S. Department of Justice under the Donald Trump administration from October 2020 to January 2021. Lott holds a Ph.D. in economics from UCLA.

He has written for both academic and popular publications. He has authored books such as &quot;More Guns, Less Crime&quot;, &quot;The Bias Against Guns&quot;, and &quot;Freedomnomics&quot;. He is best known as a gun rights advocate and has argued against restrictions on owning and carrying guns. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;The Trace&quot; have said &quot;no one has had greater influence&quot; in the scientific debate over firearms while &quot;Newsweek&quot; referred to Lott as &quot;The Gun Crowd&#x27;s Guru.&quot;

==Academic career==

John Lott studied economics at UCLA, receiving his B.A. in 1980, M.A. in 1982, and Ph.D. in 1984. Lott has held positions in law and economics at several institutions, including the Yale Law School, the Hoover Institution, UCLA, the Wharton Business School, Texas A&amp;M University, and Rice University. Lott was the chief economist at the United States Sentencing Commission (1988–1989). He spent five years at the University of Chicago, as a visiting professor from 1994 to 1995 and as a John M. Olin fellow from 1995 to 1999. Lott was a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute from 2001 to 2006. He left AEI for SUNY Binghamton. From July 2007 to 2010, Lott was a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland Foundation at the University of Maryland, College Park and lectured on law and economics.

Lott has written op-eds for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. Since 2008, he has been a columnist for Fox News, initially weekly.

== Research on guns ==

===Concealed weapons and crime rate===

In a 1997 article written with David B. Mustard and Lott&#x27;s subsequent books &quot;More Guns, Less Crime&quot; and &quot;The Bias Against Guns&quot;, Lott argued that allowing adults to carry concealed weapons significantly reduces crime in America. In 2004, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) National Research Council (NRC) conducted a review of current research and data on firearms and violent crime, including Lott&#x27;s work, and concluded &quot;that with the current evidence it is not possible to determine that there is a causal link between the passage of right-to-carry laws and crime rates.&quot; The NAS report wrote of Lott&#x27;s work, &quot;The initial model specification, when extended to new data, does not show evidence that passage of right-to-carry laws reduces crime. The estimated effects are highly sensitive to seemingly minor changes in the model specification and control variables.&quot; The criminologist James Q. Wilson was the only member on the 18-member NAS panel who dissented from this conclusion. For similar reasons as highlighted by the NAS, as well as &quot;multiple serious problems with data and methodology&quot;, a 2020 comprehensive review of existing research on concealed-carry by the RAND Corporation discounted Lott&#x27;s studies.

Other reviews said that there were problems with Lott&#x27;s model. A replication by Dan A. Black and Daniel Nagin found that minor adjustments to Lott and Mustard&#x27;s model led to the disappearance of the findings. In the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot;, David Hemenway argued that Lott failed to account for several key variables, including drug consumption. Ian Ayres and John J. Donohue said that the model used by Lott contained significant coding errors and systemic bias. In the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot;, Daniel Webster et al. also raised concerns about flaws in the study, such as misclassification of laws and endogeneity of predictor variables, which they said rendered the study&#x27;s conclusions &quot;insupportable&quot;. Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck considered it unlikely that such a large decrease in violent crime could be explained by a relatively modest increase in concealed carry. A 1998 study by Jens Ludwig that said it &quot;more effectively control[ed] for unobserved variables that may vary over time&quot; than the Lott and Mustard study concluded that &quot;shall-issue laws have resulted, if anything, in an increase in adult homicide rates.&quot; A 2001 study in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; by University of Chicago economist Mark Duggan did robustness checks of Lott and Mustard&#x27;s study and found that the findings of the Lott and Mustard study were inaccurate.

Other academics praised Lott&#x27;s methodology, including Florida State University economist Bruce Benson, Cardozo School of Law professor John O. McGinnis, College of William and Mary professor Carlisle Moody, University of Mississippi professor William F. Shughart, and SUNY economist Florenz Plassmann and University of Adelaide economist John Whitley.

Referring to the research done on the topic, &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; wrote in 2003 that &quot;Mr. Lott&#x27;s research has convinced his peers of at least one point: No scholars now claim that legalizing concealed weapons causes a major increase in crime.&quot; As Lott critics Ian Ayres and John J. Donohue III pointed out, &quot;Lott and Mustard have made an important scholarly contribution in establishing that these laws have not led to the massive bloodbath of death and injury that some of their opponents feared. On the other hand, we find that the statistical evidence that these laws have reduced crime is limited, sporadic, and extraordinarily fragile.&quot; A 2008 article in &quot;Econ Journal Watch&quot; surveyed peer-reviewed empirical academic studies, and found that 10 supported the proposition that right-to-carry reduces crime, 8 supported no significant effect and none supported an increase. The article was rebutted by Ian Ayres and John J. Donohue in the same journal in 2009.

In 2013, Lott founded the nonprofit organization Crime Prevention Research Center to study the relationship between gun laws and crime. As of July 2015, he was also the organization&#x27;s president. The board of directors for the organization includes guitarist Ted Nugent, conservative talkshow host Lars Larson and former sheriff David Clarke. In 2020, Lott left the organization to take a position in the Trump administration.

===Defensive gun use===

Lott argues in both &quot;More Guns, Less Crime&quot; and &quot;The Bias Against Guns&quot; that defensive gun use (DGU) is underreported, noting that in general, only shootings ending in fatalities are discussed in news stories. In &quot;More Guns, Less Crime&quot;, Lott writes that &quot;[s]ince in many defensive cases a handgun is simply brandished, and no one is harmed, many defensive uses are never even reported to the police.&quot; In May 1998, Lott wrote that &quot;national surveys&quot; suggested that &quot;98 percent of the time that people use guns defensively, they merely have to brandish a weapon to break off an attack.&quot; Lott cited similar figures in op-eds in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

In 2002, he said that brandishing a weapon was sufficient to stop an attack 95% of the time. Other researchers criticized his methodology. A study in &quot;Public Opinion Quarterly&quot; said that his sample size of 1,015 respondents was too small for the study to be accurate and that the majority of similar studies suggest a value between 70 and 80 percent. According to Lott, Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz&#x27;s 1994 estimate rises to 92 percent when brandishing and warning shots are added together. Lott said that the lower rates found by others was at least in part due to the different questions that were asked.

=== Defamation suit ===
On April 10, 2006, John Lott filed suit for defamation against Steven Levitt and HarperCollins Publishers over the book &quot;Freakonomics&quot; and against Levitt over a series of emails to John McCall. In the book &quot;Freakonomics&quot;, Levitt and coauthor Stephen J. Dubner claimed that the results of Lott&#x27;s research in &quot;More Guns, Less Crime&quot; had not been replicated by other academics. In the emails to economist John McCall, who had pointed to a number of papers in different academic publications that had replicated Lott&#x27;s work, Levitt wrote that the work by several authors supporting Lott in a special 2001 issue of the &quot;Journal of Law and Economics&quot; had not been peer-reviewed, Lott had paid the University of Chicago Press to publish the papers, and that papers with results opposite of Lott&#x27;s had been blocked from publication in that issue. A federal judge found that Levitt&#x27;s replication claim in &quot;Freakonomics&quot; was not defamation but found merit in Lott&#x27;s complaint over the email claims. The dismissal was affirmed by a three-judge panel of The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on February 11, 2009.

A settlement was reached over the claims made by Levitt in the emails to McCall whereby Levitt did not have to issue a formal apology but rather send a letter of clarification to John McCall that the issue of the &quot;Journal of Law and Economics&quot; was peer-reviewed, and that Lott had not improperly influenced the editors. The &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; characterized Levitt&#x27;s letter as offering &quot;a doozy of a concession.&quot;

===Disputed survey===
In the course of a dispute with Otis Dudley Duncan in 1999–2000, Lott claimed to have undertaken a national survey of 2,424 respondents in 1997, the results of which were the source for claims he had made beginning in 1997. However, in 2000 Lott was unable to produce the data or any records showing that the survey had been undertaken. He said the 1997 hard drive crash that had affected several projects with co-authors had destroyed his survey data set, the original tally sheets had been abandoned with other personal property in his move from Chicago to Yale, and he could not recall the names of any of the students who he said had worked on it. Critics questioned whether the survey had ever taken place, but Lott defends the survey&#x27;s existence and accuracy.

=== Mary Rosh persona ===
In response to the dispute surrounding the missing survey, Lott used a sock puppet by the name of &quot;Mary Rosh&quot; to defend his own works on Usenet and elsewhere. After investigative work by libertarian blogger Julian Sanchez, Lott admitted to using the Mary Rosh persona.

Further accusations claimed that Lott praised himself while posing as one of his former students and that &quot;Rosh&quot; was used to post a favorable review of &quot;More Guns, Less Crime&quot; on Amazon.com. Lott has claimed that the review was written by his son and wife. &quot;I probably shouldn&#x27;t have done it—I know I shouldn&#x27;t have done it—but it&#x27;s hard to think of any big advantage I got except to be able to comment fictitiously,&quot; Lott told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2003.

===Safe storage gun laws===

In a 2001 study, Lott and John E. Whitley reported that safe-storage gun laws not only did not reduce juvenile suicides or accidental gun deaths, but that they also increased rates of violent and property crime. The study was criticized by Webster et al. in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; for using Tobit regression despite the fact that the data used in the study on youth suicides was &quot;highly skewed and heteroskedastic&quot;, and because the vast majority of crimes that Lott and Whitley claimed increased due to safe-storage laws occurred outside the home. Webster and Carroll also wrote in &quot;Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law&quot; that the Lott and Whitley study&#x27;s findings with respect to crime were inconsistent with prior research.

==Other research and events==
In a study published in 2000, Lott concluded that most of the large recent increases in campaign spending for state and federal offices can be explained by higher government spending. Lott also supports the conclusion that higher quality judges, measured by their output once they are on the court (e.g., number of citations to their opinions or number of published opinions), take longer to get confirmed.

=== Lost Bush votes in the 2000 presidential election ===
In 2000, Lott argued, using a regression analysis, that George W. Bush lost at least 10,000 votes in Florida after the media incorrectly called the state for Al Gore while voting was still ongoing in the more conservative parts of the state. Lott&#x27;s argument is used in the influential social science methodology textbook &quot;Rethinking Social Inquiry&quot; (edited by Henry Brady and David Collier) as an example of poor methodology. Contrary to Lott&#x27;s study, they show that the number of lost Bush votes ranged from 28 to 56.

=== Abortion and crime ===
With John Whitley at the University of Adelaide, Lott published a study that argued that liberalization of abortion laws led to higher murder rates. In a review of the literature on the relationship between abortion and crime, Theodore Joyce, an economist at Baruch College and the National Bureau of Economic Research, praised Lott and Whitley for gathering additional data on abortion but criticized the methodology that they used.

=== Illegal immigration and crime ===
Lott has non-peer-reviewed research that purports to show that undocumented immigrants are more crime-prone than U.S. citizens. In doing so, Lott lumped together both legal and illegal immigrants in prison into a category for illegal immigrants, leading to an elevated crime rate for illegal immigrants. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; fact-checker wrote that this was a &quot;significant flaw in Lott&#x27;s study that undercuts his conclusion. Lott says the overall thrust of his study still holds, but the issue muddles his research and invites guesswork as to the actual crime rate for the undocumented immigrant population in Arizona.&quot;

Lott&#x27;s claims were heavily promoted by the Trump administration to justify its anti-immigration policies, in particular their attempts to end DACA.

=== Women&#x27;s suffrage and government growth ===
According to a study by Lott and Larry Kenny, &quot;women&#x27;s suffrage coincided with immediate increases in state government expenditures and revenue and more liberal voting patterns for federal representatives, and these effects continued growing over time as more women took advantage of the franchise.&quot;

=== Affirmative action in police departments ===
Lott published a study arguing that affirmative action in the hiring of police reduced the overall quality of all officers and increased crime. The most adverse effects of these hiring policies have occurred in the most heavily black-populated cities. There is no consistent evidence that crime rates rise when standards for hiring women are changed.

=== Environmental regulations ===
Together with John Karpoff and Eric Wehrly at the University of Washington, Lott has worked to show the importance of government regulations through both legal and regulatory penalties and the weaknesses of reputational penalties in reducing pollution. Firms violating environmental laws suffer statistically significant losses in the market value of firm equity. The losses are of similar magnitudes to the legal penalties imposed; and in the cross section, the market value loss is related to the size of the legal penalty.

=== Voter fraud claims ===
In October 2020, Lott was appointed as a senior adviser for research and statistics at the Office of Justice Programs within the U.S. Department of Justice in the Donald Trump administration. Lott resigned from the DoJ on January 16, 2021. Lott has claimed there was voter fraud in the 2020 United States presidential election. He argued there was &quot;irregularities&quot; in the absentee ballots in Missoula County, and later wrote a paper claiming there was evidence of fraud in the absentee ballots in Georgia and Pennsylvania. A 2021 &quot;PNAS&quot; study by political scientists at Stanford University and the University of Chicago rebutted Lott&#x27;s paper as being not even remotely convincing, writing that his analysis was &quot;entirely dependent on the completely arbitrary order in which pairs of precincts in other counties are entered in the dataset&quot; and that his conclusions about voter fraud were &quot;utterly baseless.&quot;

=== 2021 &quot;graduation address&quot; event ===
On June 4, 2021, two parents of a child killed in the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School invited Lott and David Keene to deliver what they falsely said was a dress rehearsal for a 2021 graduation address for a fictitious school called &quot;the James Madison Academy&quot;. The space for the audience contained 3,044 empty folding chairs. Lott first realized that the event was a staged attempt to call attention to school shootings, and not a genuine commencement address dress rehearsal, when news media asked him to comment on segments of video of the &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; that the organizers posted on the internet. They said that the empty chairs were intended to represent the victims of school shootings who would never graduate from high school. In a local Las Vegas news interview, Lott said that he is not opposed to all forms of background checks but simply believes that background checks broadly discriminate against persons of color, primarily black and Hispanic, among potential gun buyers.

<text>Interstate 70 (I-70) is a major east–west Interstate Highway in the United States that runs from I-15 near Cove Fort, Utah, to I-695 and Maryland Route 570 (MD 570) in Woodlawn, just outside Baltimore, Maryland. 

I-70 approximately traces the path of U.S. Route 40 (US 40; the old National Road) east of the Rocky Mountains. West of the Rocky Mountains, the route of I-70 was derived from multiple sources. The Interstate runs through or near many major U.S. cities, including Denver, Topeka, Kansas City, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Columbus, Pittsburgh, and Baltimore. The sections of the Interstate in Missouri and Kansas have laid claim to be the first Interstate in the United States. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has claimed the section of I-70 through Glenwood Canyon in Colorado, completed in 1992, to be the last piece of the Interstate Highway System, as originally planned, to open to traffic. 

The construction of I-70 in Colorado and Utah is considered an engineering marvel, as the route passes through the Eisenhower Tunnel, Glenwood Canyon, and the San Rafael Swell. The Eisenhower Tunnel is the highest point along the Interstate Highway System, with an elevation of .

===Utah===

I-70 begins at an interchange with I-15 near Cove Fort. Heading east, I-70 crosses between the Tushar and Pahvant ranges via Clear Creek Canyon and descends into the Sevier Valley, where I-70 serves Richfield, one of two towns of more than a few hundred people along I-70&#x27;s path in Utah. The second town with more than a few hundred people served by I-70 is Salina. Upon leaving the valley near Salina, I-70 crosses the Salina Summit and then crosses a large geologic formation called the San Rafael Swell.

Prior to the construction of I-70, the swell was inaccessible via paved roads and relatively undiscovered. Once this section was opened to traffic in 1970, it became the longest stretch of Interstate Highway with no services and the first highway in the U.S. built over a completely new route since the Alaska Highway. It also became the longest piece of Interstate Highway to be opened at one time. Although opened in 1970, this section was not formally complete until 1990, when a second steel arch bridge spanning Eagle Canyon was opened to traffic.

Since I-70&#x27;s construction, the swell has been noted for its desolate beauty. The swell has since been nominated for national park or national monument status on multiple occasions. If the swell is granted this status, it arguably would be the first time a national park owes its existence to an Interstate Highway. Most of the exits in this span are rest areas, brake check areas, and runaway truck ramps with few traditional freeway exits.

I-70 exits the swell near Green River. From Green River to the Colorado state line, I-70 follows the southern edge of the Book Cliffs.

===Colorado===

Entering from Utah, I-70 descends into the Grand Valley, where it meets the Colorado River, which provides its path up the western slope of the Rocky Mountains. Here, I-70 serves the Grand Junction metropolitan area before traversing more mountainous terrain.

The last section of I-70 to be completed was the Glenwood Canyon. This stretch was completed in 1992 and was an engineering marvel due to the extremely difficult terrain and narrow space in the canyon, which requires corners that are sharper than normal Interstate standards. Construction was delayed for many years due to environmental concerns. The difficulties in building the road in the canyon were compounded by the fact the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad occupied the south bank, and many temporary construction projects took place to keep US 6 open, at the time the only east–west road in the area. Much of the highway is elevated above the Colorado River. The speed limit in this section is due to the limited sight distance and sharp corners.

The Eisenhower Tunnel, the highest vehicular tunnel in North America and the longest tunnel built under the Interstate program, passes through the Continental Divide.

 Because of the rugged and narrow terrain of the Rocky Mountains, I-70 is one of few roads connecting Colorado&#x27;s ski resorts with Denver.

Descending through the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains, one can see the Denver skyline on a clear day. This can fool truckers and other unsuspecting drivers because one must still traverse of steep grade road before reaching the city. A series of signs warns truckers of the steep grade. As I-70 leaves the foothills, it goes through Denver and intersects I-25, serving as the central east–west artery through the city. Leaving Denver, I-70 levels out and traverses the wide plains through eastern Colorado. East of Denver, I-70 makes a broad turn to the south-southeast for , before reaching Limon and resuming its eastward journey toward Kansas.

===Kansas===

Coming from Colorado, I-70 enters the prairie, farmlands, and rolling hills of Kansas. This portion of I-70 was the first segment to start being paved and to be completed in the Interstate Highway System. It is given the nickname &quot;Main Street of Kansas&quot;, as the Interstate extends from the western border to the eastern border of the state, covering and passing through most of the state&#x27;s principal cities in the process.
In Salina, I-70 intersects with the north terminus of I-135. In Topeka, I-70 intersects I-470, twice. At the eastern intersection, the Kansas Turnpike merges, with I-70 becoming a toll road. This is one of only two sections of I-70 that are tolled. (The other is part of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.) I-70 carries this designation from Topeka to Kansas City, the eastern terminus of the turnpike. About halfway between Topeka and Kansas City, I-70 passes through Lawrence (home to the University of Kansas). The tolled portion of the turnpike ends near Bonner Springs, just west of Kansas City. There is also a third auxiliary route in Topeka, I-335, which runs from I-470 south to meet up with I-35 in the Flint Hills town of Emporia. Just past the Bonner Springs Toll Plaza, I-70 crosses I-435 for the first time, which allows travelers to bypass the downtown traffic via I-435, which encircles the Kansas City metropolitan area. Further down the highway in Kansas City, approximately before the 18th Street Expressway, I-70 is intersected again by another auxiliary route. This route, I-635, runs from I-35 at its southern terminus up to I-29, just about across the Missouri River, at its northern terminus. From I-635 to just past the US 169 (7th Street) exit, I-70 runs adjacent Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Armourdale Yard. Here, I-670 (also designated &quot;Alternate 70&quot; on some signs) diverges, providing a more direct route that rejoins I-70 proper a few miles east in Missouri. The highway passes over the former stockyards and railyard when it crosses the Kansas River on the Intercity Viaduct into Downtown Kansas City, Missouri.

===Missouri===
After crossing the Intercity Viaduct, I-70 enters Missouri. It encounters a loop of freeways, called the Downtown Loop, which contains I-70 as well as I-35, I-670, US 24, US 40, US 71, and US 169. In the southern part of this loop, I-670 cuts directly through the downtown while I-70 bypasses the taller buildings a few blocks north near the Missouri River. Westbound I-670 is also designated Alternate I-70. Most of the Interstates in this loop are in their second mile, so all exits (no matter which Interstate the road carries) are numbered 2 and suffixed with every letter of the alphabet except for I, O, and Z, leading to the loop&#x27;s nickname, the Alphabet Loop.

The section of I-70 in Downtown Kansas City is approximately the southern city limits of &quot;City of Kansas&quot; when it was incorporated in 1853. The first two auto bridges in Missouri mark the city&#x27;s original boundaries with the Buck O&#x27;Neil Bridge (US 169) being the west boundary while the Heart of America Bridge (Route 9) is the east boundary. Another intersection of note is the second traverse of I-435. This is primarily notable because it immediately precedes the Truman Sports Complex (home of both Arrowhead and Kauffman stadiums) and also because the entrance ramps from I-435 northbound onto I-70 eastbound also serve as the exit ramps from I-70 into the Truman Sports Complex parking lots. This section of the Interstate is marked as the &quot;George Brett Super Highway&quot;, named after the Kansas City Royals third-base player who played the entirety of his career (1973–1993) at Kauffman Stadium. The last Interstate intersection in the immediate Kansas City metro area is with I-470 in Independence.

After passing Kansas City, I-70 traverses the length of Missouri, west to east. It passes through the largest city between Kansas City and St. Louis, Columbia, which is about halfway between the two major cities and the home of the University of Missouri. The terrain is rolling with some hills and bluffs near rivers. I-70 also crosses the Missouri River twice (as did the original US 40)—at Rocheport, about west of Columbia, and at St. Charles, about northwest of St. Louis. Most of the highway on this stretch is four lanes. Various proposals have been made to widen it (at an estimated cost of $3.5 billion) including turning it into a toll road. I-70 eventually gets into Greater St. Louis, and US 40 splits to the south, along with US 61, which does not have a concurrency with I-70. In late 2009, the intersecting road was upgraded to Interstate standards along with the completion of the overhaul of I-64. After this interchange, I-70 intersects two auxiliary routes, I-270 and I-170. After passing several bedroom communities in north St. Louis County, I-70 enters the city limits of St. Louis. It turns east to cross the Mississippi River on the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge, connecting with an extension of I-44, which takes the former I-70 route through Downtown St. Louis to meet I-55 at its connection to the Poplar Street Bridge.

The 1985 World Series between the Kansas City Royals and St. Louis Cardinals was nicknamed the &quot;I-70 Series&quot; because St. Louis and Kansas City are the two endpoints of I-70 in Missouri, and the highway passes within sight of both the Royals&#x27; Kauffman Stadium and, at the time, the Cardinals&#x27; Busch Stadium.

===Illinois===

After crossing the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge, I-70 merges with I-55, while I-64 splits off I-55. When the routes intersect I-270, I-55 stays on its own pavement using the mileposts from the Poplar Street Bridge, while I-70 heads east on I-270&#x27;s pavement using I-270&#x27;s mileposts. Because of this arrangement, when I-55/I-70 intersects I-270 from the southeast, the exit number is 20 and, in the opposite direction, it is exit 15.

I-70 was rerouted from the Poplar Street Bridge to the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge north of Downtown St. Louis, which opened in February 2014.

I-70 passes through numerous county seats in Illinois, among them Vandalia, the state capital from 1818 to 1839. It runs concurrently with I-57 around Effingham and then proceeds east toward Indiana.

===Indiana===

I-70 enters Indiana just to the west of Terre Haute and then crosses the Wabash River before skirting the city&#x27;s south side. After passing through miles of gently rolling terrain in rural west-central Indiana, the freeway approaches the major Indianapolis metropolitan area.

The main entrance to Indianapolis International Airport was relocated to I-70&#x27;s exit 68 on November 11, 2008. Upon nearing the central business district of Indiana&#x27;s capital city, the visages of Lucas Oil Stadium and the JW Marriott Indianapolis hotel, with the city&#x27;s skyline as their backdrop, now dominate the view to the north from the freeway. After passing just to the south of the world headquarters for Eli Lilly and Company, I-70 and I-65 have a brief concurrency through the eastern side of Downtown Indianapolis. The junction points of these two major routes are known locally as the &quot;South Split&quot; and &quot;North Split&quot;, respectively.

The I-465 beltway provides access to Fishers via Interstate 69, which is concurrent with I-465 at the eastern interchange with I-70. I-74 meets I-70 at the western interchange with I-465, eastern access to I-74 can take place via its concurrency around the southern portion of the I-465 loop.

After passing through much of the near northeast side of Indianapolis, I-70 again encounters the I-465 beltway, which carries a multitude of unsigned U.S. Highways and Indiana state roads. I-70 continues on nearly due east from this point, first traveling through suburban Indianapolis and then transitioning into rural east central Indiana, where it passes just to the south of New Castle. Upon reaching the Richmond area, US 35 joins I-70 just before both routes leave Indiana together and enter Ohio.

===Ohio===

I-70 enters Ohio just east of the interchange with US 40 at Richmond, Indiana. Immediately to the east of this border, travelers notice a unique teal-blue arch that spans the width of the freeway, with a &quot;Welcome to Ohio&quot; greeting sign above the eastbound lanes. A sign thanking travelers for visiting Ohio is mounted on the other side of the arch for westbound travelers. Continuing eastbound, I-70 intersects I-75 north of Dayton, followed by I-675 on the east side of Dayton. Springfield is the next city, the site of Buck Creek State Park.
I-70 then encounters Columbus. Columbus is bounded by I-270 and is roughly centered on the intersection of I-70 and I-71, which share the same asphalt through a notoriously congested stretch locally known as the &quot;South Innerbelt&quot; or, more commonly, &quot;The Split&quot;. This stretch has I-71 concurrent with I-70, where I-71 enters and exits from opposite sides of I-70, causing traffic getting on I-70 from I-71 northbound to have to cross four lanes of I-70 traffic to continue on I-71. A similar issue is present for southbound I-71 traffic as well. The Split is being reconstructed ($1.4 billion) and is scheduled to be completed by mid-2026. I-670 connects John Glenn Columbus International Airport with I-270, I-71, and I-70. East of Columbus, I-70 passes through Zanesville and on to Cambridge, where it intersects I-77. Continuing on toward West Virginia, I-70 intersects I-470 just east of St. Clairsville. I-470 is primarily used for through traffic and to avoid The Winter Festival of Lights traffic during the Christmas season from Oglebay Park. In March 1995, a hole (from a former coal mine) opened up on the eastbound side of I-70 in Guernsey County near Old Washington and caused traffic to be rerouted onto US 40 between Old Washington and Cambridge for several months.

===West Virginia===
The portion of I-70 in West Virginia crosses the Ohio River at Wheeling and runs through the Wheeling Tunnel. I-70 has only one throughlane in each direction at the tunnel. A major interchange was planned but never completed on the east side of the Wheeling Tunnel. Upon merging with I-470, I-70 goes uphill toward Dallas Pike. This part of the road is called &quot;Two Mile Hill&quot;, which is known locally for the many accidents at the bottom of the hill. I-70 has brought major development in Ohio County, the only county the route passes through in West Virginia, in the past few years. On the north side of the highway, a former strip mine was developed into a retail area called The Highlands. This stretch of I-70 is the shortest that I-70 is in any state, traveling only from the Ohio River to the Pennsylvania border.

===Pennsylvania===

I-70 was initially envisioned to go through Downtown Pittsburgh but now goes south of it. Its originally planned route was later incorporated into I-376, as well as parts of I-76 and I-79. I-70 also overlaps I-79 near the Pittsburgh suburb of Washington for .

The of I-70 between Washington and New Stanton is a substandard section of the highway. This section of I-70 used to be Pennsylvania Route 71 (PA 71). It is characterized by sharp curves, limited sight distance, narrow shoulders, and lack of merge lanes at interchanges. Traffic on cloverleaf ramps must weave in the right throughlane of traffic due to the lack of a third lane for entering and exiting traffic. Other on- and offramps effectively function as right-in/right-out interchanges, forcing vehicles to weave in and out of the exit lane. The speed limit on this stretch is .

From New Stanton to Breezewood, I-70 overlaps I-76 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike. This is one of only two tolled sections of I-70 (the other is in Kansas, where the portion of the Kansas Turnpike east of Topeka is signed I-70).

Drivers on I-70 near Breezewood have to leave the freeway and travel a few blocks on US 30 past several traffic-lights before returning to the freeway. This stretch of I-70 is one of the few gaps on the Interstate Highway System.

I-70 continues on almost due south to the Maryland border after leaving I-76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) at Breezewood. This section is posted at and is heavily patrolled. After the border, it meets I-68&#x27;s eastern end and turns east toward Baltimore and Washington DC.

===Maryland===
In Maryland, I-70 runs from the Pennsylvania state line near Hancock east across the central portion of the state toward Baltimore, following the route of the National Road, now known as US 40. It is a major east–west highway in the state, serving the cities of Hagerstown and Frederick and bypassing Ellicott City. East of Frederick, the route was originally designated Interstate 70N (I-70N). The highway serves Washington DC, via I-270, which was once designated Interstate 70S (I-70S). Uniquely, I-70 indirectly serves a branch of the Washington Metro at Shady Grove station via I-370, which only connects to I-270.

I-70 was planned to end at I-95 in Baltimore, but, due to local opposition, it was only built to MD 122. The section east of I-695 is now MD 570.

==History==
Besides being the first Interstate to receive a contract for pavement, other oddities happened with I-70 as well.
As first proposed, the western terminus of I-70 was to be Denver. Utah and Colorado, however, pressured the federal government to extend the planned freeway farther west, arguing a direct link between Denver and Salt Lake City was vital for an effective highway system. The proposal was to follow what is now US 6 west and connect to I-15 at Spanish Fork, Utah. Federal planners, influenced by the military, agreed to extend the proposed route of I-70, but not to serve Salt Lake City; the military wanted to better connect Southern California with the Northeastern U.S. This led to I-70&#x27;s constructed route through the San Rafael Swell terminating at Cove Fort. Many motorists include I-70 as part of their cross-country drives between New York City and Los Angeles (which are accessible to I-70 via other Interstates).

Completed in 1992, the freeway through Glenwood Canyon Colorado was the last major section of freeway on I-70 to be completed and widely heralded as an environmental and engineering success.
As a result of freeway revolts in the Baltimore area, I-70 was not completed east of MD 122 to its planned terminus at I-95 within the city of Baltimore, and it now ends at a four-way symmetrical stack interchange with I-695, the Baltimore Beltway. Until November 2014, I-70 ended at a park-and-ride lot at MD 122 as the freeway enters the city of Baltimore at exit 94. Commuters park on the pavement where high-speed freeway lanes were to be. The former freeway from I-695 to MD 122 is being converted into a two-lane parkway to be renamed Cooks Boulevard, maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration.

The highway gave its name to the I-70 killer, a serial killer who committed a string of murders within a few miles of it in several Midwestern states in the early 1990s. No suspect has ever been apprehended despite the widespread publicity the murders generated, including their being featured several times on the television show &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; and &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;.

John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo, the duo responsible for the DC sniper attacks, were apprehended at a rest stop on I-70 near Myersville, Maryland, in 2002.

The 1985 World Series was a contest between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Kansas City Royals and won by the Royals. As these cities are primarily connected by I-70, the media has often called the series and the two teams&#x27; interleague rivalry the I-70 Series.

==Auxiliary routes==
I-70 has one of the closest distances between two distinct auxiliary Interstates with the same child Interstate number. I-470 near Topeka, Kansas, and I-470 on the east side of Kansas City, Missouri, are approximately apart. This record is surpassed by I-291 around Hartford, Connecticut, and I-291 near Springfield, Massachusetts, which are unrelated but are apart.

A breakdown of I-70&#x27;s auxiliary routes follows:
* I-270 is a short connector between I-70 and I-25 in Denver, Colorado. It also carries US 36 along its entire length.
* I-470 is a loop around the south side of Topeka, Kansas.
* I-670 is an alternate route of I-70 in Kansas City, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri.
* I-470 is a connector between I-70 and I-435 in southeastern Kansas City and Independence, Missouri.
* I-170 is a connector between I-64 and I-270 in St. Louis County, Missouri.
* I-270 loops around the city and county of St. Louis, Missouri. It is supplemented by I-255 to the east.
* I-270 is a beltway around Columbus, Ohio.
* I-670 is a highway beginning at I-70 west of Downtown Columbus, Ohio, and terminating at I-270 in eastern Columbus that also provides direct access to John Glenn Columbus International Airport from downtown.
* I-470 is a southern bypass around Wheeling, West Virginia.
* I-270 is a spur to Washington DC. It was formerly designated I-70S.
* I-370 is a spur to Gaithersburg and Rockville, Maryland, from I-270. It never connects to I-70.
* I-170 was to have been a spur into downtown Baltimore, Maryland, but the short part that opened never connected to I-70 or to any other Interstate Highway. It was decommissioned in 1989, and US 40 is the current designation for the freeway.

<text>Carl Olof Larsson (; 28 May 1853 – 22 January 1919) was a Swedish painter representative of the Arts and Crafts movement. His many paintings include oils, watercolors, and frescoes. He is principally known for his watercolors of idyllic family life. He considered his finest work to be &quot;Midvinterblot&quot; (&quot;Midwinter Sacrifice&quot;), a large painting now displayed inside the Swedish National Museum of Fine Arts.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Larsson was born on 28 May 1853, in the Gamla stan neighborhood of Stockholm, Sweden. His parents were extremely poor, and his childhood was not happy.

Renate Puvogel, in her book &quot;Carl Larsson&quot; (Cologne: Taschen; 1994), gives detailed information about Larsson&#x27;s life: &quot;His mother was thrown out of the house, together with Carl and his brother Johan; after enduring a series of temporary dwellings, the family moved into Grev Magnigränd No. 7 (later No. 5) in what was then Ladugårdsplan, present-day Östermalm&quot;. As a rule, each room was home to three families; &quot;penury, filth and vice thrived there, leisurely seethed and smouldered, eaten-away and rotten bodies and souls. Such an environment is the natural breeding ground for cholera&quot;, he wrote in his autobiographical novel &quot;Jag&quot;.

Larsson&#x27;s father worked as a casual laborer, sailed as a stoker on a ship headed for Scandinavia, and lost the lease to a nearby mill, only to work there later as a mere grain carrier. Larsson portrays him as a loveless man lacking self-control; he drank, ranted and raved, and incurred the lifelong anger of his son after an outburst in which he declared, &quot;I curse the day you were born&quot;. In contrast, Carl&#x27;s mother worked long hours as a laundress to provide for her family.

However, at the age of thirteen, his teacher at the school for poor children urged him to apply to the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts, and he was admitted. During his first years there, Larsson felt socially inferior, confused, and shy. In 1869, at the age of sixteen, he was promoted to the &quot;antique school&quot; of the same academy. There Larsson gained confidence, and even became a central figure in student life. Carl earned his first medal in nude drawing. In the meantime, Larsson worked as a caricaturist for the humorous paper &quot;Kasper&quot; and as a graphic artist for the newspaper &quot; Ny Illustrerad Tidning&quot;. His annual wages were sufficient to allow him to help support his parents financially.

=== Career ===
After several years working as an illustrator of books, magazines, and newspapers, Larsson moved to Paris in 1877, where he spent several frustrating years as a hardworking artist without any success. Larsson was not eager to establish contact with the French progressive Impressionists; instead, along with other Swedish artists, he cut himself off from the radical movement of change.

After spending two summers in Barbizon, the refuge of the plein-air painters, he settled down with his Swedish painter colleagues in 1882, in Grez-sur-Loing at a Scandinavian artists&#x27; colony outside Paris. It was there that he met the artist Karin Bergöö (1859–1928), who soon became his wife. This was to be a turning point in Larsson&#x27;s life. In Grez, Larsson painted some of his most important works, now in watercolour and very different from the oil painting technique he had previously employed.
Carl and Karin Larsson had eight children: Suzanne (b. 1884), Ulf (b. 1887), Pontus (b. 1888), Lisbeth (b. 1891), Brita (b. 1893), Mats (b. 1894), Kersti (b. 1896) and Esbjörn (b. 1900). His family became Larsson&#x27;s favourite models. Many of the interiors depicted were the work of Karin Larsson, who also worked as an interior designer.

In 1888, the young family was given a small house named Lilla Hyttnäs at Sundborn just outside Falun in Dalarna by Karin&#x27;s father Adolf Bergöö (1828–1890). Carl and Karin decorated and furnished this house according to their particular artistic taste and also for the needs of the growing family. Through his paintings and books, Little Hyttnäs has become one of the most famous artist&#x27;s homes in the world, transmitting the artistic taste of its creators and making it a major line in Swedish interior design. The descendants of Carl and Karin Larsson now own this house, now known as Carl Larsson-gården, and keep it open for tourists each summer from May until October.

In his later years he suffered from bouts of depression. While working on &quot;Midvinterblot&quot; (1915), a large decoration for the vestibule of the Nationalmuseum, Larsson experienced the onset of an eye problem and a worsening of his frequent headaches. After suffering a mild stroke in January 1919, he spent his remaining time completing his memoirs. He died later that month in Falun and was buried in the cemetery of Sundborn Church (&quot;Sundborns kyrka&quot;).

== Paintings ==
Larsson&#x27;s popularity increased considerably with the development of colour reproduction technology in the 1890s, when the Swedish publisher Bonnier published books written and illustrated by Larsson and containing full colour reproductions of his watercolours, titled &quot;A Home&quot;. However, the print runs of these rather expensive albums did not come close to that produced in 1909 by the German publisher Karl Robert Langewiesche (1874–1931). Langewiesche&#x27;s choice of watercolours, drawings and text by Carl Larsson, titled &quot;Das Haus in der Sonne&quot; (Königstein, Verlag Karl Robert Langewiesche. 1909), immediately became one of the German publishing industry&#x27;s best-sellers of the year—40,000 copies sold in three months, and more than 40 print runs have been produced up to 2001. Carl and Karin Larsson declared themselves overwhelmed by such success.

Carl Larsson considered his monumental works, such as his frescos in schools, museums and other public buildings, to be his most important works. His last monumental work, &quot;Midvinterblot&quot; (&quot;Midwinter Sacrifice&quot;), a oil painting completed in 1915, had been commissioned for a wall in the National Museum in Stockholm (which already had several of his frescos adorning its walls). However, upon completion, it was rejected by the board of the museum. The fresco depicts the blót of King Domalde at the Temple of Uppsala. Decades later, the painting was purchased and placed in the National Museum.

=== &quot;Midvinterblot&quot; ===
In his memoirs &quot;Jag&quot; (Stockholm: Albert Bonniers förlag, 1931) – published after Larsson&#x27;s death – he declared his bitterness and disappointment over this rejection of the painting he himself considered to be his greatest achievement: &quot;The fate of &quot;Midvinterblot&quot; broke me! This I admit with a dark anger. And still, it was probably the best thing that could have happened, because my intuition tells me – once again! – that this painting, with all its weaknesses, will one day, when I&#x27;m gone, be honoured with a far better placement.&quot; Larsson admitted, however, in the same memoirs that the pictures of his family and home &quot;became the most immediate and lasting part of my life&#x27;s work. For these pictures are of course a very genuine expression of my personality, of my deepest feelings, of all my limitless love for my wife and children.&quot;

Fights between different schools of Swedish artists caused the &quot;Midvinterblot&quot; controversy to continue for many years. In 1987 the museum was even offered the monumental painting for free, provided it would adorn the empty wall for which it had been intended, but the museum declined the offer, so the painting was sold to the Japanese collector Hiroshi Ishizuka. In 1992, he agreed to lend it to the museum for its major Carl Larsson exhibition, where it was hung in the intended place. Public appreciation changed the experts&#x27; view of the painting, and with the help of private donations the museum was able to buy it from Ishizuka in 1997 and permanently display it in the location for which it was intended.

<text>Folkestone ( ) is a coastal town on the English Channel, in Kent, south-east England. The town lies on the southern edge of the North Downs at a valley between two cliffs. It was an important harbour, shipping port, and fashionable coastal resort for most of the 19th and mid-20th centuries.

This location has had a settlement since the Mesolithic era. A nunnery was founded by Eanswith, granddaughter of Æthelberht of Kent in the 7th century, who is still commemorated as part of the town&#x27;s culture. During the 13th century, it developed into a seaport, and the harbour developed during the early 19th century to defend against a French invasion. Folkestone expanded further west after the arrival of the railway in 1843 as an elegant coastal resort, thanks to the investment of the Earl of Radnor under the urban plan of Decimus Burton.

In its heyday – during the Edwardian era – Folkestone was considered the most fashionable resort of the time, visited by royalty – amongst them Queen Victoria and Edward VII and other members of the English aristocracy. The town&#x27;s architecture, especially in the West End part, is a testimony of this period, with many impressive buildings, townhouses, villas, private squares, and large hotels built to accommodate the gentry. After two world wars and the boom of the overseas holiday package, the town quickly declined. The harbour&#x27;s trade diminished following the opening of the nearby Channel Tunnel and the ending of ferry services from Folkestone, but it still remains in active use.

==Toponymy==

Although Kent was the first part of the British mainland to be conquered and settled by the invading Angles, Saxons and Jutes from the middle of the 5th century AD, after the departure of the Romans, the name &quot;Folcanstan&quot; did not appear until the late 7th century. There is general agreement that this means &quot;Folca&#x27;s stone&quot;, the stone possibly marking the meeting place of the local hundred. It was not until the mid 19th century that the spelling of &quot;Folkestone&quot; was fixed as such, with the Earl of Radnor requesting that the town&#x27;s name be standardized (although this tendency towards standardisation in the 19th century is true of English place names generally). Folkestone is often misspelled with variants including Folkston, Folkstone &amp; Folkestone.

==History==

The area of Folkestone has been occupied since at least the Mesolithic era. In 2010, worked flints were discovered below the remains of the Folkestone Roman Villa. The East Cliff area was excavated in 1924 and most recently from 2010 to 2011, producing artifacts from the Mesolithic period through to the Roman era. On the East Cliff, an extensive Iron Age oppidum existed, which produced quern-stones on an almost industrial scale. Those quern-stones, which were used for grinding cereals into flour, were traded for continental exports such as pottery and wine. A modest Roman-style villa was constructed over the Iron Age settlement sometime during the 1st century AD, followed by a more luxurious one in about 200 AD. The villa was abandoned during the 3rd or 4th century for unknown reasons.

In 597 AD, monks, led by Augustine of Canterbury, arrived at Ebbsfleet on the Isle of Thanet, on a mission from Pope Gregory to re-Christianise Britain. He was greeted by the Anglo-Saxon pagan King of Kent, Æthelberht, and his Christian Queen, Bertha. Augustine was granted land in Canterbury, where he built his church and, outside the walls, founded the monastery of St Peter &amp; St Paul, now known as St Augustine&#x27;s. Æthelberht was succeeded as Anglo-Saxon king of Kent by his son Eadbald, whose daughter Eanswythe refused all offers of marriage. In 630, Eanswythe founded a nunnery on the site of her father&#x27;s castle near Folkestone by the present parish church of St Mary &amp; St Eanswythe.
Eanswythe died around 640 and was quickly made a saint. Her remains were moved into the chancel of the current church on 12 September 1138, which has since been commemorated as the Feast of St Eanswythe. They became the focus of prayer and pilgrimage, so Eanswythe was quickly adopted as the town&#x27;s patron. The religious community grew and developed into a monastery until it was dissolved by Henry VIII, and St Eanswythe&#x27;s remains disappeared. They were rediscovered in June 1885 when workmen, carrying out alterations to the high altar, found a battered lead casket immured in a niche in the north wall of the chancel. Examination by archaeologists at the time, and again in 1981, confirmed that the casket was of Anglo-Saxon origin and the few bone fragments were those of a woman in her early thirties. The relics are still housed in the church, close to where they were discovered, flanked by a pair of small brass candlesticks. St Eanswythe also appears on the town&#x27;s seal, along with William Harvey, the Folkestone-born 17th-century physician who discovered the blood circulation. 

A Norman knight held a Barony of Folkestone, which led to its entry as a part of the Cinque Ports in the thirteenth century and, with that, the privilege of being a wealthy trading port. At the start of the Tudor period, it had become a town in its own right. Wars with France meant that defenses had to be built, and a harbor was built, though the coming of the railways in 1843 had a greater impact on its development.

Dover Hill, the highest point in Folkestone, was a sighting point for the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790), which measured the precise distance between the Royal Greenwich Observatory and the Paris Observatory. The hill provided a sight-line to the east along the line of the Folkestone Turnpike to Dover Castle, one of the two principal cross-channel observation points, the other being Fairlight Down in Sussex.

===Folkestone Harbour===
Until the 19th century, Folkestone remained a small fishing community with a seafront continually battered by storms and encroaching shingles, making it hard to land boats. In 1807, an act of Parliament, the Folkestone Pier and Harbour Act 1807 (47 Geo. 3 Sess. 2. c. ii), was passed to build a pier and harbour, which was built by Thomas Telford in 1809. By 1820 a harbour area of had been enclosed. Folkestone&#x27;s trade and population grew slightly, but development was still hampered by sand and silt from the Pent Stream. The Folkestone Harbour Company invested heavily in removing the silt but with little success. 1842, the company went bankrupt, and the government put the derelict harbour up for sale. It was bought by the South Eastern Railway (SER), which was then building the London to Dover railway line. George Turnbull was responsible in 1844 for building the Horn pier. Dredging the harbour, and the construction of a rail route down to it, began almost immediately. The town soon became the SER&#x27;s principal packet station for the Continental traffic to Boulogne. The last ferry ran in 2001.

The Harbour Arm, formerly used solely for port activities, has been extensively restored and developed as a recreational space and promenade to which the public has access, including bars and restaurants, with entertainment at weekends and on some evenings. The former railway station and harbour viaduct have been reconstructed as a successful public walkway and promenade following the full closure of the branch railway in 2014.

==Governance==
The governance of Folkestone lies in both national and local government. Insofar as the national government is concerned, Folkestone is part of the constituency of Folkestone and Hythe, which is currently (2024) represented by Tony Vaughan (Labour). Before Brexit in 2020, Folkestone was part of the South East England constituency in the European Parliament.

The local government consists of three tiers. In the first tier, Kent County Council, Folkestone is divided into two divisions each returning one County Councillor. Folkestone West is represented by Dylan Jeffrey (Conservative). Folkestone East is represented by Jackie Meade (Labour).

The second tier of local government is the non-metropolitan district. Folkestone forms a part of Folkestone and Hythe district, which was first established by the Local Government Act 1972 as Shepway. Folkestone elects 10 of Folkestone and Hythe District Council&#x27;s 30 Councillors.

The third and lowest tier was established as the civil parish: in Folkestone&#x27;s case, because it held a Town Charter, and when the then Folkestone Borough Council was abolished, councillors elected to represent Folkestone&#x27;s wards were designated as the Town&#x27;s Charter Trustees, responsible for electing a Town Mayor. This role has since passed to Folkestone Town Council which is based at Folkestone Town Hall.

Folkestone Town Council was established in 2004, comprising the area of the former Borough of Folkestone less Folkestone Sandgate ward, which was separately parished. Folkestone Town Council comprises eight wards: Cheriton; Morehall; Park; Harvey West; Harvey Central; Harbour; East; and Foord. Each ward returns two or three members, for a total of 18 councillors elected to four-year terms. Each year, Folkestone Town Councillors attend the Annual General Meeting and Mayor-making ceremony to appoint both a Town Mayor and a Deputy Mayor from their number for the coming year.

==Geography==

Folkestone is located where the southern edge of the North Downs escarpment meets the sea. In contrast to the white cliffs at Dover further to the east, the cliffs at Folkestone are composed of greensand belonging to the Folkestone Formation and gault clay. A small stream, Pent Brook, cuts through the cliffs at this point, and provided the original haven for fishermen and cross-channel boats. The cliffs are constantly under attack from the sea, and the original headlands, which once protected the port, long ago ceased to do so. Artificial protection, in the form of breakwaters and piers, have been necessary since the 17th century.

The town is now built on both sides of the original valley: the West Cliff and &quot;The Bayle&quot; to the West, and the East Cliff on the other side of the stream. The Pent Stream now runs through a culvert from the fire station, at the junction of Radnor Park Road, Park Farm and Pavilion Road, until it reaches the inner harbour. Remains of a quay, dating to the 17th century, were discovered under what is now a public car park, between the Old High Street and the railway viaduct, adjacent to the current harbour. Included in the town is Cheriton, where the Channel Tunnel&#x27;s northern exit is located; Newington; and Peene.

In August 1996 a one-in-600-years storm left homes and businesses in Black Bull Road, in the Foord Valley, under two metres of water. Heavy rainfall combined with inadequacies in the Pent Stream and local drainage caused the flooding. A crowd of 2,332 saw Folkestone Invicta play hosts to West Ham United in a benefit football match following the flood.

==Economy==
Folkestone was at one stage a resort town with a developed shipping trade. With the decline of those industries others have filled the gap. The Dormobile works, car conversion manufacturers were based in the town. Church and Dwight, the US company famous for Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda-based consumer products, has its UK headquarters in the town. Silver Spring Mineral Water Company, was the largest independently-owned soft drinks manufacturer in Britain, based in Park Farm, but closed down in 2013.

During the 1980s and 1990s the construction of the Channel Tunnel provided employment, as well as bringing many people to the area, and on completion the running of services still provides work for many. Several insurance firms are based in Folkestone. Some of them used to be involved in the shipping trade but have since diversified into other fields. Saga plc has its headquarters in Folkestone.

Along with other Kent seaside towns, there has been a resurgence in domestic tourism linked to a growing arts scene.

==Main sights==
The major landmark in Folkestone, apart from the harbour, is The Leas, the cliffs above the beach. Located in the west part of the town, it is a unique promenade designed in the mid-1800s by Decimus Burton who also worked on Regent&#x27;s Park, London and St Leonards-on-Sea. The promenade along the sea includes many crescents, hotels, private parks and alleys.

A Martello Tower (No 3) stands on the cliff above Copt Point. Built in 1806 as a defence against Napoleon, it has also been a Coast Guard lookout, a family home, a golf clubhouse and a Second World War Naval mine control post. It now houses a visitor centre. The Folkestone White Horse is carved on Cheriton Hill above the Channel Tunnel terminal.

The Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty includes part of the town area. The nearby Brockhill Country Park, to the west, with footpaths around a lake and in a valley, links with the Royal Military Canal at Hythe.

Folkestone is near to two important Battle of Britain landmarks – the Battle of Britain Memorial, Capel-le-Ferne and the Kent Battle of Britain Museum.





The Old High Street is an ancient route connecting the Bayle with the Harbour, and is now at the heart of Folkestone&#x27;s Creative Quarter. The narrow, cobbled slope was one of Charles Dickens&#x27; favourite streets. Together with Rendezvous Street, this part of Folkestone is now thriving, with independent businesses and restaurants surrounded by colourful restored buildings.

==Transport==
Folkestone developed because of its transport links. With France visible across the Strait of Dover, the town became an important transit point for those travelling from the UK to the Continent. Plans to restore ferry traffic to Boulogne, following termination in 2001, were discussed in 2005, but they did not come to fruition. The Channel Tunnel northern entrance is located at Cheriton.

===Rail===
The railway reached Folkestone on 28 June 1843 and a temporary railway station was built while the construction of the line to Dover continued. This started with the Foord viaduct, designed by Sir William Cubitt, completed in 1844. Folkestone Junction railway station was then opened and construction through the cliffs between Dover and Folkestone commenced. Once the line was opened to Dover, the town began to prosper (which meant growth westwards), further stations were opened at Folkestone West (originally named &quot;Shorncliffe Camp&quot;) in 1863, and Folkestone Central in 1884. Folkestone Harbour station was used to transfer passengers from specific trains; the line from the junction was very steep and needed much additional locomotive help. A local group, the Remembrance Line Association, is actively seeking to retain the harbour branch as a tourist/heritage railway operation, though as at 2019 the future was uncertain. Today the domestic services from Folkestone use the Central and West stations on the South Eastern Main Line. Venice-Simplon Orient Express passengers now change at Folkestone West for road coaches and the onward journey through the Channel Tunnel.

High Speed 1 (HS1) is a high speed railway built to French &#x27;LGV&#x27; (Ligne à Grande Vitesse) standards, connecting the Channel Tunnel to London. Since December 2009, high speed commuter services from Dover have called at Folkestone and then, using the South Eastern Main Line to Ashford International, the services join HS1 for the journey to Ebbsfleet, Stratford International and London St Pancras. The journey time to London via this route has been reduced to under 1 hour; some trains from Folkestone West take as little as 52 minutes to reach the capital by High Speed Train.

The Eurotunnel Shuttle terminal, for car transport to Calais by train using the Channel Tunnel, is in the Folkestone suburb of Cheriton.

The Leas Lift, a Victorian water lift that opened in 1885, connects the Leas with the beach. There were two other lifts on the Leas in Folkestone history: the Metropole Lift (closed in 1940) and the Sandgate Hill Lift, which closed in 1918.

===Roads===
The town is located at the eastern end of the M20 which provides fast access to Ashford, Maidstone, London and also to the M25. The A20 is motorway-standard to Dover and runs locally towards Ashford and London, following the M20 but runs locally via Sellindge, Ashford, Lenham, Maidstone, Aylesford, Wrotham and Swanley where the A20, M20 and M25 meet and the A20 continues through Sidcup and Lewisham to Central London. Folkestone marks the eastern end of the A259 although this is no longer part of the South Coast Trunk Road east of Brenzett, although it remains a primary route. The road gives access to the Romney Marsh, Hastings, Eastbourne and beyond. To the north, roads connect Folkestone to Canterbury and the nearby villages of Elham and Lyminge.

Stagecoach in East Kent operates local buses from the town. It is served by The Link services to Canterbury, The Wave service to Dover, Romney Marsh and Hastings. Other bus routes run to Hythe, Ashford and Maidstone.

National Express runs coaches to Ashford, Dover, Hythe, Maidstone and London.

==Education==

Schools and colleges in Folkestone include Folkestone Academy (formed by the merger of Hillside School for Boys and Holywell School for Girls in the early 1970s, and formerly known as Wyndgate Secondary School in the 1970s, the Channel High School in the 1980s, and the Channel School in the 1990s); and Turner Free School (opened in 2018 on the site of Pent Valley Technology College, formerly Pent Valley Secondary Modern, formed by the merger of Harcourt Secondary School for Girls and Morehall Secondary School for Boys in the 1970s).

There are two selective state secondary schools – Folkestone School for Girls (formed by the merger of Folkestone Technical High School for Girls and Folkestone Grammar School for Girls in the 1980s) and the Harvey Grammar School for boys; the latter was founded in 1674. These two schools have a common sixth form timetable.

East Kent College have a Folkestone campus providing a variety of courses including Apprenticeships, Hairdressing and Construction.

There are a number of primary schools in the town. State primaries include Folkestone Primary, Sandgate Primary, Morehall Academy and Martello Grove Academy, a new academy that opened in September 2015. Martello Grove Academy moved to new buildings on its campus in Warren Way in autumn 2016.

Footballer and army officer Walter Tull attended the town&#x27;s Mundella Primary School when it was North Board School.

==Leisure==
The town is situated at the foot of the North Downs, with views of the surrounding countryside and the coast of France, away. The area is a magnet for passing migrating birds and the Warren (woodlands adjoining Wear Bay) and the cliffs above are of particular interest during the spring and autumn periods.
These are now part of East Cliff and Warren Country Park.

Folkestone Parks and Pleasure Grounds Charities are lands which were donated to the people of Folkestone for perpetual recreational use by the Earls of Radnor during the 19th century. The lands are administered by Shepway District Council, with the Cabinet members forming the Board of Trustees. Previously, the Charter Trustees were also Trustees of the Charities, but that arrangement lapsed upon the parishing of the Folkestone and Sandgate area. Negotiations are ongoing regarding the transfer of the lands to Folkestone Town Council and Sandgate Parish Council.

There are two major long distance footpaths through the town. The North Downs Way, starting its course in Surrey, reaches the coast at Folkestone and continues through Capel-le-Ferne, and to its end at Dover, some away. The Saxon Shore Way starts at Gravesend, Kent and traces the Kent coast as it was in Roman times, via Folkestone, as far as Hastings, East Sussex, 163 miles (262 km) in total.

Nearby places of interest include the Kent Battle of Britain Museum and the Battle of Britain Memorial, Capel-le-Ferne.

==Culture==
Folkestone has been home to many galleries over the years. The long-established Metropole Galleries, located in the one-time Metropole Hotel on the Leas, staged year round exhibitions until it closed in 2008. Its place has been largely taken by the Creative Foundation. The Foundation has opened a medium scale theatre, conference and music venue in the heart of the Creative Quarter named Quarterhouse. It offers a year-round programme of live music, comedy, film, talks, theatre and children&#x27;s entertainment. George&#x27;s House Gallery and Googie&#x27;s Art Cafe hold frequent exhibitions by local artists and the Folkestone Art Society, established in 1928, holds three annual art exhibitions and publishes an annual art review of work by local artists. Leas Cliff Hall is the biggest entertainment and function venue in Folkestone with a large choice of concerts, comedy and theatre.

The first Folkestone Triennial art event took place between June and September 2008 with artists such as Christian Boltanski and Tracey Emin making site specific work for a wide variety of locations around the town. Many of the commissioned works remain permanently in the town. The 2011 Triennial &#x27;A Million Miles From Home&#x27; was launched on 24 September 2010 and commissioned 19 international artists to develop new works for Folkestone&#x27;s streets, squares, beaches and historic buildings.

Folkestone has an annual Chamber Music Festival each May curated by the Sacconi Quartet.

<text>Geirröðr (also Geirröd) is a jötunn in Norse mythology. He is the father of the Gjálp and Greip, who are killed by the thunder-god Thor.

Geirröðr is mentioned in the skaldic poem &quot;Þórsdrápa&quot;, written by Eilíf Godrúnarson (late 10th c. AD), itself cited in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (early 13th c.) where it is preceded by Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s account of the myth, and in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; by Saxo Grammaticus (early 13th c.).

Saturn&#x27;s moon Geirrod is named after him.

== Name ==
The Old Norse name &quot;Geirröðr&quot; has been translated as &#x27;spear-reddener&#x27;. It stems from the Old Norse masculine noun &quot;geirr&quot; (&#x27;spear&#x27;), ultimately from the Proto-Germanic &quot;*gaizaz&quot; (&#x27;spear, tip&#x27;).

An unrelated figure also bears the name &quot;Geirröðr&quot; in the eddic poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot;.

== Attestations ==

===Prose Edda===
In &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (The Language of Poetry; early 13th c.), Loki is flying in Frigg’s hawk coat to Geirrödargardar, the abode of the giant Geirröðr, when he is captured by the latter and locked in a chest for three months. To redeem his life, Loki agrees to bring Thor to Geirröðr&#x27;s place without his power belt and hammer. On their way to Geirrödargardar, Thor and Loki (or Thjálfi in &quot;Thórsdrápa&quot;) stop at the home of the giantess Gríðr. She warns Thor about Geirröðr&#x27;s plan and equips him with a belt of strength, an iron glove, and a staff named &quot;Grídarvöl&quot; (Gríd’s-staff). Arriving at Geirrödargardar, Thor is eventually challenged to a game by Geirröðr. The giant throws a piece of red-hot iron at him, but Thor is able to catch it with the iron glove. As Geirröðr tries to hide behind a pillar, Thor throws the piece of iron through the column and kills him.

=== Viking Age ===
The story is mentioned in &quot;Þórsdrápa&quot; (late 10th c. AD), cited in the later &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;.
=== Other texts ===
In &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (early 13th c.), Thorkillus and his companions notice the pierced body of an old man and three dead women with their backs broken as they visit the vile hall of the dead Geruthus (Geirrøth). Thorkillus tells them that Thor had driven a hot ingot through Geruthus and killed his daughters with thunderbolts.

In &quot;Thorsteins þáttr baejarmagns&quot;, Thor&#x27;s deeds have been reworked and transferred to a hero named Thorstein, involved in a sporting event at the hall of the giant-king Geirröd where a heavy red-hot seal’s head is thrown between the contestants.

== Theories ==
According to scholar John Lindow, the myth of Geirröðr &quot;shows several characteristics of Thor stories—the dangerous journey to the otherworld, the special enmity of female giantesses, and the killing of a male giant—and it also introduces notions of smithing that sometimes seem to lurk behind Thor.&quot;

<text>Gjálp (Old Norse: ; or Gialp) and Greip (Old Norse: Greip) are two jötnar in Norse mythology and the daughters of the Geirröðr. They are killed by the thunder god Thor for trying to kill him.

== Names ==
The Old Norse name &quot;Gjálp&quot; has been variously translated as &#x27;screamer&#x27;, &#x27;yelper&#x27;. It is related to the Icelandic &quot;gjálp&quot; (&#x27;roar; sea, wave&#x27;), and to the Old Norse &quot;gjalpa&quot; (&#x27;to brag&#x27;).

&quot;Greip&quot; is translated as (&#x27;gripper, grasper&#x27;). It derives from the Old Norse &quot;greip&quot; (&#x27;hand [with spread thumbs], handle&#x27;).

== Attestations ==

=== Prose Edda ===

In &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (The Language of Poetry), Thor meets Gjálp as he is trying to wade across the Vimur River; she is causing the river to swell with what appears to be her urine or menstrual fluids as she is standing &quot;astride the river&quot;.
Thor eventually reaches Geirrödargardar, the abode of the Geirröðr. He sits on a chair that is lifted up against the roof by Gjálp and Greip as they are trying to kill him.
=== Viking Age ===
The same myth is told in &quot;Þórsdrápa&quot; by Eilífr Goðrúnarson (late 10th c. AD), which is cited by Snorri Sturluson in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, although the are not named in the poem.
=== &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; ===
&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (Deeds of the Danes) relates a similar story as Thorkillus (Thokil) and his companions are visiting the hall of the dead Geruthus (Geirröðr) when they notice the pierced body of an old man and three dead women with their backs broken. Thokil tells them that the god Thor &quot;has driven a burning ingot though the vitals of Geirrœth&quot; and that the &quot;women have been struck by the force of Thor’s thunderbolt and have paid the penalty for attacking his divinity by having their bodies broken&quot;. 

=== Other texts ===
In &quot;Völuspá hin skamma&quot; , Gjálp and Greip are listed among the Nine Mothers of Heimdallr.&#x27; Gjálp is also mentioned in the þulur and in kennings of skaldic poetry.&#x27; Greip on her side is not mentioned in &quot;Nafnaþulur&quot; and found only once in the skaldic kenning.

In &quot;Haustlöng&quot;, Þjazi is called &quot;the son of the suitor of Greip&quot;. Greip may be used there as a generic name and the kenning may mean simply &quot;&quot;.

In a lausavísa composed by Vetrliði Sumarliðason and quoted in Skáldskaparmál, Gjálp is mentioned as being killed by Thor.

<text>Interstate 75 (I-75) is a major north–south Interstate Highway in the Great Lakes and Southeastern regions of the United States. As with most Interstates that end in 5, it is a major cross-country, north–south route, traveling from State Road 826 (SR 826, Palmetto Expressway) and SR 924 (Gratigny Parkway) on the Hialeah–Miami Lakes border (northwest of Miami, Florida) to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, at the Canadian border. It is the second-longest north–south Interstate Highway (after I-95) and the seventh-longest Interstate Highway overall.

I-75 passes through six different states. The highway runs the length of the Florida peninsula from the Miami area and up the Gulf Coast through Tampa. Farther north in Georgia, I-75 continues on through Macon and Atlanta before running through Chattanooga and Knoxville and the Cumberland Mountains in Tennessee. I-75 crosses Kentucky, passing through Lexington before crossing the Ohio River into Cincinnati, Ohio. In Ohio, the highway runs up the western side through Dayton and Lima before crossing into Michigan north of Toledo. I-75 runs northeasterly along the Lake Erie shoreline and Detroit River into the city of Detroit before turning northwesterly and northward to the Mackinac Bridge where the freeway crosses the strait between Lakes Huron and Michigan. Farther north, I-75 approaches the Canadian border at Sault Ste. Marie, downriver from Lake Superior, from its origins near the subtropical Atlantic Ocean.

===Florida===

I-75 starts at an interchange with SR 924 and SR 826 on the Hialeah–Miami Lakes border in suburban Miami. After an intersection with the Homestead Extension of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike and an interchange with I-595 and the Sawgrass Expressway (SR 869), the Interstate leaves the Miami metropolitan area and turns westward to travel through the Everglades along the tolled Alligator Alley, which brings the highway to the Gulf Coast and Naples, where it again heads north. Passing through Bonita Springs, Fort Myers, and Sarasota, I-75 is six lanes all the way to Georgia. The freeway enters the Tampa Bay area before the interchange with I-275 northbound, which handles St. Petersburg-bound traffic. Within the Tampa metro are three more major junctions: one with the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway which carries traffic into Downtown Tampa, one with I-4 (a turbine interchange) which carries traffic across the center of the state to the East Coast, and another as I-275 traffic defaults back onto northbound. The freeway proceeds to enter suburban portions of Pasco, Hernando, and Sumter counties on its way to Ocala and Gainesville. At Lake City, Florida, I-10, intersects with I-75. Afterward, the northmost stretch of I-75 in Florida exits the Sunshine State into southern Georgia.

===Georgia===

I-75 enters Georgia near Lake Park, and it continues northward through the towns of Valdosta, Tifton, and Cordele until it reaches the Macon area, where it intersects with I-16 eastbound toward I-75&#x27;s route. After Macon, it passes the small town of Forsyth. The freeway reaches no major junctions again until in the Atlanta metropolitan area. The first metropolitan freeway met is I-675, then followed by I-285, Atlanta&#x27;s only beltway dubbed as the Perimeter Beltway. It crosses inside the I-285 beltway and heads north several miles toward Downtown Atlanta. I-75 then runs concurrently with I-85 due north over the Downtown Connector through the central business district of Atlanta, where it intersects with I-20. The areas where I-85 and I-75 run concurrently are some of the most traffic-prone Interstate Highways in the nation. After the two Interstates split, I-75 diverts from I-85 and heads toward the northwest suburbs of Atlanta, with the major cities being Marietta and Kennesaw that it bypasses. To the northwest of Marietta, the highway runs concurrently with I-575. After the interchange with I-575, the highway leaves the Atlanta metro area and traverses the Blue Ridge Mountains in the north Georgia region as it heads toward Chattanooga.

===Tennessee===

The freeway enters Tennessee directly in the Chattanooga metropolitan area, where it intersects with I-24. Exiting Chattanooga to the northeast, I-75 passes through an area known for dense fog. Twelve people were killed and 42 were injured in a 1990 I-75 fog disaster on that stretch of I-75 in heavy fog on December 11, 1990. I-75 does not meet any other freeways until it overlaps I-40 near Farragut and heads eastbound. Together, they enter the outskirts of Knoxville, where I-75 overlaps itself with a different road, this time I-640, but only for a short time. When the two meet I-275, I-75 encounters some of its highest points of elevation through the Cumberland Mountains, cutting through the uppermost peaks and ridges.

===Kentucky===

I-75 continues northbound through the hilly terrain of the Cumberland Plateau region of Kentucky, passing through London and Richmond and eventually reaching Lexington, where it briefly runs concurrently with I-64 before splitting off in the direction of Georgetown. Afterward, the route heads in the direction of Ohio. Near Walton, I-71 runs concurrently with I-75 for the next or so and heads toward Cincinnati. The two concurrent Interstates then make an interchange with I-275, the Cincinnati beltway. After passing through Covington, the I-71/I-75 highway traverses the Ohio River via the lower level of the Brent Spence Bridge and continues into Downtown Cincinnati.

===Ohio===

Immediately after entering Cincinnati, I-75 diverges from I-71, remaining generally due north through the Cincinnati metro area while I-71 curves more to the east and northeast through downtown Cincinnati and its surrounding suburbs. I-74, Ohio State Route 562, and Ohio State Route 126 all intersect the freeway as it makes its way northward. After another interchange with the I-275 beltway, the freeway continues within the metro area, passing through Middletown and heading toward Dayton, where I-675, I-70, and U.S. Route 35 have interchanges with I-75. The interchange of I-75 with I-70 is known as the Freedom Veterans Crossroads. After exiting the city of Dayton, I-75 makes its way northbound through Ohio, passing through smaller cities of Troy, Sidney, Wapakoneta, Lima, Findlay and Bowling Green before finally reaching Toledo located on the western shore of Lake Erie and the border of Michigan. I-75 meets the I-475 interchange in the southern suburbs of Toledo in Perrysburg and then I-80, I-90, and the Ohio Turnpike. As the interstate highway passes through downtown Toledo, I-475 meets with I-75 again just north of the downtown area of Toledo. It then continues through some industrial areas as it progresses north before approaching I-280, which is the last major junction in Ohio. I-75 then passes by the Lake Erie neighborhoods of Shoreland and Point Place, just before entering the US state of Michigan with the sign welcoming motorists to Michigan.

===Michigan===
Upon entering Michigan, I-75 follows the northwestern shore of Lake Erie, passing through the residential neighborhoods of Toledo and Luna Pier until about Monroe in which it then heads northeast to enter Detroit. The freeway makes an interchange with I-275 in northern Monroe County. On a further note, it does not meet with any major junctions until in Downtown Detroit. Once near downtown, I-75 meets several interchanges: an interchange that leads into Canada via the Ambassador Bridge (international bridge border crossing) to Windsor, Ontario; an interchange with I-375; I-94; I-96; M-10; M-8. I-696 also intersects I-75 in the northern metro area. When the freeway reaches Pontiac, there is a junction with M-59 and in Flint further northward. It meets I-475 and I-69 and overlaps U.S. Route 23 (US 23). The Interstate then heads north toward Saginaw where I-675 acts as a spur route into the city. Further north in Bay City, US 10 provides access to Midland as well as downtown Bay City. When it nears Standish, US 23 diverts from I-75 to Lake Huron, where it heads further north. The last major interchange in the state of Michigan before it crosses the international border into Canada is at 4 Mile Road just south of Grayling where US 127 ends with traffic merging onto northbound I-75 and southbound taking drivers through the center of the state. At Mackinaw City, I-75 makes an interchange with US 31 and US 23 before crossing the Mackinac Bridge to reach the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I-75 is the only Interstate located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and it continues until it crosses the Canadian border via the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge.

==History==
This limited access highway that was planned in the 1950s roughly follows the general route of many older at-grade highways, including US 2, US 27, US 25, and US 41, among others. Some of these older US Highways (several of which are still in existence) previously had replaced the eastern route of the old Dixie Highway.

I-75 was planned to end in Tampa, Florida, in the original plan for of Interstate Highways. However, beginning in the 1960s, there was a huge growth in the population of Southwest Florida (Sarasota, Fort Myers, Naples, Cape Coral, etc.), hence the need for new highways, especially a north–south freeway, as well as one connecting Florida&#x27;s Gulf Coast to South Florida. At first, Florida state legislators proposed a toll in the new highway, and, by 1968, it was decided that the federal government would pay 90 percent toward the extension of I-75 to southwestern and southeastern Florida. This included subsuming a toll highway from Naples to the Fort Lauderdale area, the Alligator Alley, and furthermore to connect this expressway with I-95 in North Miami—though due to some local opposition, I-75 presently ends a few miles short of I-95.

I-75 was completed in Kentucky in 1970. The last segment in Michigan opened to traffic on November 1, 1973. The last section of I-75 in Tennessee was completed on December 20, 1974. On December 21, 1977, I-75 was completed from Tampa to Sault Ste. Marie with its final segment opening between northern Marietta, Georgia, and Cartersville, Georgia. It was estimated to have cost $3.5 billion in 1977 dollars (equivalent to $ in ) to build the original section. The final stretch of I-75 in South Florida was completed in 1986 in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, and the last stretch to receive the signs for I-75 was the reconstructed (rebuilt and widened) Alligator Alley on November 25, 1992.

On September 7, 2024, the Interstate 75 Kentucky Shooting occurred near London, Kentucky in which multiple shots were fired at cars passing by, injuring 5.

<text>In Norse mythology, Gerðr (Old Norse: ; &quot;fenced-in&quot;) is a jötunn, goddess, and the wife of the god Freyr. Gerðr is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in the poetry of skalds. &quot;Gerðr&quot; is sometimes modernly anglicized as Gerd or Gerth.

In both the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Freyr sees Gerðr from a distance, becomes deeply lovesick at the sight of her shimmering beauty, and has his servant Skírnir go to Jötunheimr (where Gerðr and her father Gymir reside) to gain her love. In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; Gerðr initially refuses, yet after a series of threats by Skírnir she is forced to yield. In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, no mention of threats is made. In both sources, Gerðr agrees to meet Freyr at a fixed time at the location of Barri and, after Skírnir returns with Gerðr&#x27;s response, Freyr laments that the meeting could not occur sooner. In both the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Gerðr is described as the daughter of Gymir and the jötunn Aurboða.

In &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, Gerðr is recorded as the wife of Freyr, euhemerized as having been a beloved king of Sweden. In the same source, the couple are the founders of the Yngling dynasty and produced a son, Fjölnir, who rose to kinghood after Freyr&#x27;s passing and continued their line. Gerðr is commonly theorized to be a goddess associated with the earth. Gerðr inspired works of art and literature.

==Attestations==

Gerðr is attested in two poems in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, in two books of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, and in two books in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;.

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Skírnismál&quot;, the god Freyr sat on the high seat Hlidskjalf and looked into all worlds. Freyr saw a beautiful girl walking from the hall of her father to a storehouse. Freyr became heartsick for the girl. Freyr has a page named Skírnir. Freyr&#x27;s father Njörðr and, in verse, the goddess Skaði tells Skírnir to find out what troubles Freyr. An exchange occurs between Freyr and Skírnir in verse, where Freyr tells Skírnir that he has seen a wondrous girl with shining arms at the home of (her father) Gymir, yet that the gods and elves do not wish for the two to be together:

Skírnir requests that Freyr give him a horse and Freyr&#x27;s sword; a sword which fights jötnar by itself. Under the cover of darkness, Skírnir rides the horse over nations and dew-covered mountains until he reaches Jötunheimr, the home of the jötnar, and proceeds to Gymir&#x27;s courts. Ferocious dogs are tied before the wooden fence that surrounds Gerðr&#x27;s hall. Skírnir rides out to a herdsman (unnamed) sitting on a mound, greets him, and asks the herdsman how he may speak to the maiden beyond Gymir&#x27;s dogs. An exchange occurs between the herdsman and Skírnir, during which the herdsman tells Skírnir that he will never speak to the girl.

Hearing a terrible noise in her dwellings, Gerðr asks where it is coming from, noting that the earth trembles and that all of Gymir&#x27;s courts shake. A serving maid (unnamed) notes that outside a man has dismounted his horse and has let it graze. Gerðr tells the serving maid to invite the man to come into their hall and to partake of some of their &quot;famous mead,&quot; yet Gerðr expresses fear that the man outside may be her &quot;brother&#x27;s slayer&quot;.
Gerðr asks the stranger if he is of the elves, Æsir, or the Vanir, and why he comes alone &quot;over the wild fire&quot; to seek their company. Skírnir responds that he is of none of these groups, yet that he has indeed sought her out. Skírnir offers Gerðr 11 golden apples (or apples of eternal life, in a common emendation) to gain her favor. Gerðr rejects the apples—no matter who offers them—and adds that neither will she and Freyr be together as long as they live. Skírnir offers Gerðr a ring, here unnamed (Draupnir), that produces eight more gold rings every ninth night and &quot;was burned with Odin&#x27;s young son&quot;. Gerðr responds that she is not interested in the ring, for she shares her father&#x27;s property, and Gymir has no lack of gold.

====Threats====
Skírnir turns to threats; he points out to Gerðr that he holds a sword in his hand and he threatens to cut her head from her neck unless she agrees. Gerðr refuses; she says that she will not endure the coercion of any man, and says that if Gymir encounters Skírnir then a battle can be expected. Skírnir again reminds Gerðr of his blade and predicts that Gerðr&#x27;s jötunn father will meet his doom with it. Skírnir warns Gerðr that he will strike her with his Gambanteinn, a wand, that it will tame her to his desires, and says that she will never again be seen by &quot;the sons of men&quot;. From early morning, Gerðr will sit on an eagle&#x27;s mound, looking outward to the world, facing Hel, and that &quot;food shall be more hateful to you than to every man is the shining serpent among men&quot;.

Skírnir declares that when Gerðr comes out she will be a spectacle; Hrímgrímnir will &quot;glare&quot; at her, &quot;everything&quot; will stare at her, she will become more famous than the watchman of the gods, and that she will &quot;gape through the bars&quot;. Gerðr will experience &quot;madness and howling, tearing affliction and unbearable desire&quot; and that, in grief, tears will flow from her. Skírnir tells Gerðr to sit down, for her fate will be even worse yet. She will be harassed by fiends all her weary days. From the court of jötnar to the halls of the hrimthurs, Gerðr shall everyday crawl without choice, nor hope of choice. Gerðr will weep rather than feel joy, suffering tearfully. She will live the rest of her life in misery with a three-headed thurs or otherwise be without a man altogether. Skírnir commands for Gerðr&#x27;s mind to be seized, that she may waste away with pining, and that she be as the thistle at the end of the harvest; crushed.

Skírnir says that he has been to a wood to get a &quot;potent branch&quot;, which he found. He declares that the gods Odin and Thor are angry with Gerðr, and that Freyr will hate her; she has &quot;brought down the potent wrath of the gods&quot;. Skírnir declares to the hrimthursar, thursar, the sons of Suttungr, and the &quot;troops of the Æsir&quot; that he has denied both pleasure and benefit from men to Gerðr. Skírnir details that the thurs&#x27;s name who will own her below the gates of Nágrind is Hrímgrímnir and that there, at the roots of the world, the finest thing Gerðr will be given to drink is the urine of goats. He carves &quot;thurs&quot; (the runic character *thurisaz) on Gerðr and three runes (unnamed) symbolizing lewdness, frenzy, and unbearable desire, and comments that he can rub them off just as he has carved them—if he wishes.

Gerðr responds with a welcome to Skírnir and tells him to take a crystal cup containing ancient mead, noting that she thought she would never love one of the Vanir. Skírnir asks her when she will meet with Freyr. Gerðr says that they shall meet at a tranquil location called Barri, and that after nine nights she will there grant Freyr her love:

Skírnir rides home. Standing outside, Freyr immediately greets Skírnir and asks for news. Skírnir tells him that Gerðr says she will meet with him at Barri. Freyr, impatient, comments that one night is long, as is two nights, and questions how he will bear three, noting that frequently a month seemed shorter than half a night before being with Gerðr.

A stanza in the poem &quot;Lokasenna&quot; refers to Gerðr. In the poem, Loki accuses the god Freyr of having purchased Gymir&#x27;s daughter (Gerðr) with gold and comments that, in the process, Freyr gave away his sword. Referring to Freyr as a &quot;wretch&quot;, Loki then posits how Freyr intends to fight when the Sons of Muspell ride over the wood Myrkviðr (an event during Ragnarök). Freyr&#x27;s servant, Byggvir, interjects and the poem continues.

In the poem &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;, Óttar&#x27;s ancestry is recounted and information is provided about the gods. One stanza that actually belongs to &quot;Völuspá hin skamma&quot; relates that Freyr and Gerðr were married, that Gerðr is the daughter of the jötunn Gymir, that Gerðr&#x27;s mother is Aurboða, and that they are related to Þjazi (the nature of the kinship is not specified)—father of the goddess and jötunn Skaði.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
In chapter 37 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Gerðr is introduced by the enthroned figure of High as the daughter of Gymir and the mountain jötunn Aurboða, and is described as &quot;the most beautiful of all women&quot;. High reports that Freyr went into Hlidskjalf and looked over all worlds. When Freyr looked to the north he saw a distant homestead with a large and magnificent building. A woman went to the building, and when she lifted her arms and opened the door to the building &quot;light was shed from her arms over both sky and sea, and all worlds were made bright by her&quot;. In punishment for &quot;his great presumption&quot; in having sat in the holy seat, Freyr went away filled with grief.

Freyr arrives home and neither sleeps nor drinks, remaining in silence. No one dares speak to him. The god Njörðr sends Freyr&#x27;s servant Skírnir to speak to Freyr. Freyr tells Skírnir that he saw a beautiful woman, so beautiful that he was filled with grief and that he would soon die if he could not have her. Freyr tells Skírnir that he must go gain her hand on his behalf—whether the woman&#x27;s father agrees or not—and he will be rewarded. Skírnir replies that he accepts the mission but only in exchange for Freyr&#x27;s sword, which can fight on its own. Freyr gives him the sword and Skírnir sets off. Skírnir asks for the woman&#x27;s hand for Freyr and receives her promise. Nine nights later she is to meet with Freyr at a location called Barey. Skírnir delivers the news to Freyr and Freyr responds with the final stanza from the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Skírnismál&quot;, lamenting that he must wait.

At the beginning of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, eight goddesses are listed as attending a feast held by Ægir on the island of Hlesey (now Læsø, Denmark), including Gerðr. In chapter 19, different ways of referring to the goddess Frigg are provided. One of these names is &quot;rival of Gerðr&quot;; however, this is probably a scribal error (see &quot;Theories&quot; section below). In chapter 57, various goddesses are listed, including Gerðr (between Snotra and Gefjon).

===&quot;Heimskringla&quot;===
In chapter 12 of &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; (as collected in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;), a euhemerized prose account relates that Freyr was a much loved king in what is now Sweden. Freyr&#x27;s wife was Gerðr and their son was Fjölnir. Gerðr&#x27;s fate is not provided, but after Freyr&#x27;s death their son goes on to become king and their family line, the Ynglings, continues. In a verse stanza found in chapter 16 of &quot;Haralds saga Gráfeldar&quot;, Gerðr is mentioned in a kenning for &quot;woman&quot; (&quot;Gerðr-of-gold-rings&quot;).

==Archaeological record==

Small pieces of gold foil featuring engravings dating from the Migration Period into the early Viking Age (known as &quot;gullgubber&quot;) have been discovered in various locations in Scandinavia, almost 2,500 at one location. The foil pieces have been found largely at sites of buildings, only rarely in graves. The figures are sometimes single, occasionally an animal, sometimes a man and a woman with a leafy bough between them, facing or embracing one another. The human figures are almost always clothed and are sometimes depicted with their knees bent. Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson says that it has been suggested that the figures are partaking in a dance, and that they may have been connected with weddings, as well as linked to the Vanir group of gods, representing the notion of a divine marriage, such as in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Skírnismál&quot;; the coming together of Gerðr and Freyr.

==Theories==
===&quot;Rival of Frigg&quot;===
In chapter 19 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Gerðr is listed among &quot;rivals&quot; of the goddess Frigg, a list of sexual partners of Frigg&#x27;s husband, Odin. Instead of &quot;Gerðr&quot;, the jötunn Gríðr, mother of Odin&#x27;s son Víðarr according to the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, was probably intended. One manuscript has Gríðr corrected to Gerðr. Andy Orchard notes that it may nonetheless be an intentional inclusion in view of &quot;Odin&#x27;s notorious appetites&quot;.

===Earth and fertility===
Scholar John Lindow comments that Gerðr&#x27;s name has been etymologically associated with the earth and enclosures and that the wedding of Gerðr and Freyr is commonly seen as &quot;the divine coupling of sky and earth or at least fertility god and representative of the soil.&quot; Lindow adds that, at the same time, the situation can be read as simply the gods getting what they want from the jötnar.

Hilda Ellis Davidson comments that Gerðr&#x27;s role in &quot;Skírnismál&quot; has parallels with the goddess Persephone from Greek mythology, &quot;since it is made clear that if [Gerðr] remains below in the dark kingdom of the underworld there will be nothing to hope for but sterility and famine. She does not become the bride of the underworld, however; her bridal is to be in the upper world when she consents to meet Freyr at Barri.&quot;

==Modern influence==
Gerðr has inspired works of art and literature. The Danish poet Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger wrote a series of poems referencing Gerðr as collected in (1819) &quot;Nordens Guder&quot;. Esaias Tegnér&#x27;s (1782–1846) unfinished epic poem &quot;Gerda&quot; also references the goddess. K. Ehrenberg depicted the goddess in his illustration (1883) &quot;Freyr und Gerda, Skade und Niurd&quot;. Her story was retold in free verse by the Icelandic poet Gerður Kristný in her &quot;Blóðhófnir&quot;, a feminist retelling of &quot;Skírnismál&quot; that won the 2010 Icelandic Literature Award.
Saturn&#x27;s moon Gerd is named after her.

<doc id="88314" wikidata="Q39420" url="?curid=88314" title="Sochi">
<text>Sochi (, from  – &quot;seaside&quot;) is the largest resort city in Russia. The city is situated on the Sochi River, along the Black Sea in the North Caucasus of Southern Russia, with a population of 466,078 residents, and up to 600,000 residents in the urban area. The city covers an area of , while the Greater Sochi Area covers over . Sochi stretches across , and is the longest city in Europe, the fifth-largest city in the Southern Federal District, the second-largest city in Krasnodar Krai, and the sixth-largest city on the Black Sea.

Sochi hosted the XXII Olympic Winter Games and XI Paralympic Winter Games in 2014. It hosted the alpine and Nordic Olympic events at the nearby ski resort of Rosa Khutor in Krasnaya Polyana. It also hosted the Formula 1 Russian Grand Prix from 2014 until 2021. It was also one of the host cities for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

== Etymology ==
The general consensus (also recognized by the city&#x27;s own website) is that the name &quot;Sochi&quot; () is the Russified form of the Circassian &quot;Ş̂açə&quot; () which in turn is of Ubykh-Circassian origin, coming from the Ubykh name &quot;Ş̂uaça&quot; (). It is a compound made up from the two Ubykh words &quot;шъуа&quot; (sea) and &quot;ча&quot; (side) and roughly translates to &quot;Seaside/coast&quot;. There are other claims and theories, according to Georgian sources, the word comes from the Georgian word for the fir tree, &quot;soch&#x27;i&quot; ().

==History==

=== Early history ===
Before the whole area was conquered by Cimmerian, Scythian and Sarmatian invaders, the Zygii (Proto-Adyghe) people lived in Lesser Abkhazia under the Kingdom of Pontus, then the Roman Empire&#x27;s influence in antiquity. From the 6th to the 11th centuries, the area successively belonged to the Georgian kingdoms of Lazica and Abkhazia, who built a dozen churches within the city boundaries, the later was unified under the single Georgian monarchy in 11th-century, forming one of the Saeristavo, known as Tskhumi extending its possessions up to Nicopsis. The Christian settlements along the coast were destroyed by the invading Alans, Khazars, Mongols and other nomadic empires whose control of the region was slight. The northern wall of an 11th-century Byzantine basilica still stands in the Loo Microdistrict.

Between the 13th and 15th centuries, the Republic of Genoa had the monopoly of the trade on the shores of the Black Sea, and established colonies and trading posts in the region of the present-day Sochi, the large ones were Layso and Costa.

From the 14th to the 19th centuries, the region was dominated by the Abkhaz, Ubykh, Abazin and Adyghe tribes, the current location of the city of Sochi (Ş̂açə) known as Ubykhia was part of historical Circassia, and was controlled by the native people of the local mountaineer clans of the north-west Caucasus, nominally under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, which was their principal trading partner in the Islamic world.

=== Russian Empire ===
The coastline was occupied by Russia in 1829 as a result of the Russo-Circassian War and the Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829; however, the Circassians did not accept the Russian control over Circassia and kept resisting the newly established Russian outposts along the Circassian coast (). Provision of weapons and ammunition from abroad to the Circassians caused a diplomatic conflict between the Russian Empire and the British Empire that occurred in 1836 over the mission of the &quot;Vixen&quot;.

The Russians had no detailed knowledge of the area until Baron Feodor Tornau investigated the coastal route from Gelendzhik to Gagra, and across the mountains to Kabarda, in the 1830s. In 1838, the fort of Alexandria, renamed Navaginsky a year later, was founded at the mouth of the Sochi River as part of the Black Sea coastal line, a chain of seventeen fortifications set up to protect the area from recurring Circassian resistance. At the outbreak of the Crimean War, the garrison was evacuated from Navaginsky to prevent its capture by the Turks, who effected a landing on Cape Adler soon after.

The last battle of the Russo-Circassian War, the Battle of Qbaada, took place in 1864, and the Dakhovsky fort was established on the site of the Navaginsky fort. The end of the Caucasian War was proclaimed at Qbaada tract (modern Krasnaya Polyana) on June 2 (21 May O.S.), 1864, by the manifesto of Emperor Alexander II, read aloud by Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia. The city was the administrative capital of the Sochinsky Okrug.

==== Circassian genocide ====

By the end of Russo-Circassian War, the Russian Empire aimed to systematically destroy the native Circassian people in the region and several atrocities were committed by the Russian forces. As a result, almost all Ubykhs and a major part of the Circassians who lived on the territory of modern Sochi, were either killed or expelled to the Ottoman Empire in the Circassian genocide. According to Russian sources, Sochi&#x27;s population fell from roughly 100,000, to 98.

Starting in 1866 the coast was actively colonized by Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Greeks, Germans, Georgians and other people from inner Russia. Additionally in the late 1860s, the Adyghe, mostly of the Shapsug and Khakuchi tribes, who were hiding in the mountains started resettling on the coast.

In 1874–1891, the first Russian Orthodox church, St. Michael&#x27;s Church, was constructed, and the Dakhovsky settlement was renamed &quot;Dakhovsky&quot; Posad on April 13, 1874 (O.S.). In February 1890, the Sochi Lighthouse was constructed. In 1896, the Dakhovsky Posad was renamed &quot;Sochi&quot; Posad (after the name of local river) and incorporated into the newly formed Black Sea Governorate. In 1900–1910, Sochi burgeoned into a sea resort. The first resort, &quot;Kavkazskaya Riviera&quot;, opened on June 14, 1909 (O.S.). Sochi was granted town status in 1917.

=== Soviet time===
During the Russian Civil War, the littoral area saw sporadic armed clashes involving the Red Army, White movement forces, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia. As a result of the war Sochi has become Russian territory. In 1923, Sochi acquired one of its most distinctive features, a railway which runs from Tuapse to Georgia within a kilometer or two of the coastline. Although this branch of the Northern Caucasus Railway may appear somewhat incongruous in the setting of beaches and sanatoriums, it is still operational and vital to the region&#x27;s transportation infrastructure.

Sochi was established as a fashionable resort area under Joseph Stalin, who had his favorite dacha built in the city. Stalin&#x27;s study, complete with a wax statue of the leader, is now open to the public. During Stalin&#x27;s reign the coast became dotted with imposing Neoclassical buildings, exemplified by the opulent Rodina and Ordzhonikidze sanatoriums. The centerpiece of this early period is Shchusev&#x27;s Constructivist Institute of Rheumatology (1927–1931). The area was continuously developed until the demise of the Soviet Union.

=== Modern Russia ===
Following Russia&#x27;s loss of the traditionally popular resorts of the Crimean Peninsula (transferred from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev), Sochi emerged as the unofficial summer capital of the country. In 1961, Soviet officials decided to expand the city limits by forming a &quot;Greater Sochi&quot; which extended for 140 kilometers from the southern parts of Tuapse to Adler. In July 2005, Russia submitted a successful bid for hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics in the city, spending around $51 billion in the process.

In 2019, an area in the Imereti Lowlands was separated from Adlersky city district to form a new urban-type settlement named Sirius. It was later designated as a federal territory.

On January 11, 2025 there were 2 earthquakes in Sochi.

== Geography ==
Greater Sochi is elongated along the Black Sea coast for . Sochi is approximately from Moscow.

The city of Sochi borders with Tuapsinsky District in the northwest, with Apsheronsky District and with Maykopsky District of the Republic of Adygea in the north, with Mostovsky District in the northeast, and with Georgia/Abkhazia in the southeast. From the southwest, it is bordered by the Black Sea.

The vast majority of the population of Sochi lives in a narrow strip along the coast and is organized in independent microdistricts (formerly settlements). The biggest of these microdistricts, from the northwest to the southeast, are Lazarevskoye, Loo, Dagomys, central Sochi (Tsentralny city district), Khosta, Matsesta, and Adler. The whole city is located on the slopes of the Western Caucasus which descend to the Black Sea and are cut by the rivers. The biggest rivers in Sochi are the Mzymta and the Shakhe. Other rivers include the Ashe, the Psezuapse, the Sochi, the Khosta, and the Matsesta. The Psou River makes the border with Abkhazia.

The northeastern part of the city belongs to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve which is a World Heritage Site spanning areas in Krasnodar Krai and Adygea. Almost the whole area of the Greater Sochi, with the exception of the coast and of the area which belong to the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, are included into Sochi National Park.

Sochi has a humid subtropical climate with mild winters (average during the day and at night) in the period from December to March and warm summers (average during the day and at night) in the period from May to October.

=== Layout and landmarks ===
Sochi is unique among larger Russian cities as having some aspects of a subtropical resort. About two million people visited Greater Sochi each summer as of 2014, when the city is home to the annual film festival &quot;Kinotavr&quot; and a getaway for Russia&#x27;s elite.

A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Caucasus Nature Reserve, lies just north from the city. Sochi also has the region&#x27;s most northerly tea plantations.

=== Climate ===

Sochi has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;), at the lower elevations. Its average annual temperature is during the day and at night. In the coldest months—January and February—the average temperature is about during the day, above at night and the average sea temperature is about . In the warmest months—July and August—the temperature typically ranges from during the day, about at night and the average sea temperature is about .

Yearly sunshine hours are around 2,200. Generally, the summer season lasts three months, from June to September. Two months—April and November—are transitional; sometimes temperatures reach , with an average temperature of around during the day and at night. December, January, February and March are the coldest months, with an average temperature (for these four months) of during the day and at night. Average annual precipitation is about .

Sochi is situated on the same latitude as Nice but strong cold winds from the south make winters less warm. In fact, temperatures drop below freezing every winter. The highest temperature recorded was , on July 30, 2000, and the lowest temperature recorded was on January 25, 1892. Sochi lies at 8b/9a hardiness zone, so the city supports different types of palm trees.


==Administrative and municipal status and city divisions==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one urban-type settlement (Krasnaya Polyana) and seventy-nine rural localities, incorporated as the City of Sochi—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Sochi is incorporated as Sochi Urban Okrug.

Sochi is administratively subdivided into four city districts: Tsentralny city district, Lazarevsky city district, Khostinsky city district, and Adlersky city district. Tsentralny city district, comprising the central portion of, is by far the smallest out of four in terms of the area, and the other three have comparable areas, with Lazarevsky city district being the biggest. In terms of the population, Tsentralny city district is approximately twice as big as each of the other three city districts.


===Tsentralny city district===

Tsentralny city district, or central Sochi, covers an area of and, as of the 2010 Census, has a population of 137,677. The highlights include:
*Michael Archangel Cathedral, a diminutive church built in 1873–1891 to Kaminsky&#x27;s designs in order to commemorate the victorious conclusion of the Caucasian War.
*The red-granite Archangel Column, erected in 2006 in memory of the Russian soldiers fallen in Sochi during the Caucasian War. It is capped by a 7-metre bronze statue of Sochi&#x27;s patron saint, Michael the Archangel.
*Sochi Arboretum, a large botanical garden with tropical trees from many countries, and the Mayors Alleé—a landscape avenue of palm trees planted by mayors from cities around the world.
*The Tree of Friendship, a hybrid citrus tree planted in 1934 in the Subtropical Botanic Garden. Since 1940 numerous citrus cultivars from foreign countries have been grafted onto this tree as a token of friendship and peace. The associated Friendship Tree Garden Museum has a collection of 20,000 commemorative presents from around the world.

===Lazarevsky city district===

Lazarevsky city district lies to the northwest from the city center; the 2010 Census showed the population of 63,894 people. It is the largest city district by area, covering some and comprising several microdistricts:
*Lazarevskoye, from the city center, contains a delphinarium, an old church (1903), and a new church (1999). The settlement was founded as a Russian military outpost in 1839 and was named after Admiral Mikhail Lazarev.
*Loo, from the city center, was once owned by Princes Loov, a noble Abkhazian family. The district contains the ruins of a medieval church, founded in the 8th century, rebuilt in the 11th century, and converted into a fortress in the Late Middle Ages.
*Dagomys, from the city center, has been noted for its botanical garden, established by order of Nicholas II, as well as tea plantations and factories. A sprawling hotel complex was opened there in 1982. Dagomys adjoins Bocharov Ruchey, a dacha built for Kliment Voroshilov in the 1950s, but later upgraded into a country residence of the President of Russia, where he normally spends his vacations and often confers with leaders of other states.
*Golovinka is a historic location at the mouth of the Shakhe River. Formerly marking the border between the Ubykhs and the Shapsugs, the settlement was noted by Italian travelers of the 17th century as Abbasa. On May 3, 1838, it was the site of the Subashi landing of the Russians, who proceeded to construct Fort Golovinsky where many convicted Decembrists used to serve. The fort was intentionally destroyed by Russian forces at the beginning of the Crimean War, so as to avoid its capture by the enemy.
*Fort Godlik, of which little remains, had a turbulent history. It was built at the mouth of the Godlik River in the Byzantine period (5th to 8th centuries), was destroyed by the Khazars and revived by the Genoese in the High Middle Ages.

===Khostinsky city district===

Khostinsky city district, sprawling to the southeast from the city center, occupies approximately , with a population of 65,229 as of the 2010 Census. The district is traversed by many rivulets which give their names to the microdistricts of Matsesta (&quot;flame-colored river&quot;), Kudepsta, and Khosta (&quot;the river of boars&quot;).

===Adlersky city district===
Adlersky city district, with an area of and a population of 76,534 people as of the 2010 Census, is the southernmost district of the city, located just north of the border with Abkhazia. Until the establishment of Greater Sochi in 1961, it was administered as a separate town, which had its origin in an ancient Sadz village and a medieval Genoese trading post.

Among the natural wonders of the district is the Akhshtyr Gorge with a 160-meter-long cave that contains traces of human habitation. The upland part of the district includes a network of remote mountain villages (auls), the Estonian colony at Estosadok, and the ski resort of Krasnaya Polyana which hosted the events (Alpine and Nordic) of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Also located here is a trout fishery and a breeding nursery for great apes.

==Demographics==
Sochi has an ethnic Russian majority (~70%). The city is home to a sizable Armenian minority (~20%), which is especially notable in the Adlersky City District where they compose more than half of the total population. Most of Sochi&#x27;s Armenian community are descendants of Hamshen Armenians from Turkey&#x27;s northeastern Black Sea coast, who began arriving in the late 19th century. The rest are Armenians from Georgia (particularly from Abkhazia and Samtskhe-Javakheti) and Armenia (especially from Shirak Province due to the 1988 earthquake).

===Religion===

The Byzantine Empire brought Christianity to the Sochi region in the Middle Ages. The region was relatively isolated before 1829. In the North, a few hundred Sunni Muslim Shapsugs, a part of the Circassian nation, lived around Tkhagapsh, near Lazarevskoye. The Circassians (also known as Adyghe) converted to Islam from Christianity in the 17th century. In the nineteenth century, Islam spread to the region.

Currently, Sochi is a large predominantly Christian city, though there are thought to be around 20,000 Muslims (5% of inhabitants) living there now (the majority are Adyghe) plus other Eastern Caucasians, Turks, Tatars, and other smaller Muslim groups.

A mosque was built in 2008 by United Arab Emirates in the central area of Bytkha, in addition to the old mosque being around north of the city center in the Adyghe &quot;aul&quot; of Tkhagapsh.

There are around thirty Russian Orthodox churches, the largest being St. Michael&#x27;s, and two monasteries, plus two Catholic churches, one in the center of Sochi and the other in Lazarevskoye. The Armenian community gathers in about ten churches.

=== Sports facilities ===

A local tennis school spawned the careers of such players as Grand Slam champions Maria Sharapova and Yevgeny Kafelnikov (Kafelnikov spent much of his childhood here, while Sharapova relocated to Florida at the age of seven). In late 2005, the Russian Football Union announced that it was planning to establish a year-round training center for the country&#x27;s national teams in Sochi. The city&#x27;s warm climate was cited as one of the main incentives. Sochi is also the home for the football team PFC Sochi which plays in the Russian Premier League and for the ice hockey team HC Sochi which plays in the Kontinental Hockey League.

===2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics===
The nearby ski resort of Roza Khutor at Krasnaya Polyana was the location of the alpine and Nordic events for the 2014 Winter Olympics.

In June 2006, the International Olympic Committee announced that Sochi had been selected as a finalist city to host the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics. On July 4, 2007, Sochi was announced as the host city of the 2014 Winter Games, edging out Pyeongchang, South Korea and Salzburg, Austria.

This was Russia&#x27;s first time hosting the Winter Olympic Games, and its first time hosting the Paralympic Games. The site of a training centre for aspiring Olympic athletes, in 2008, the city had no world-class level athletic facilities fit for international competition. Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history; with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials, and Allison Stewart of the Saïd Business School at Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, various factors caused the budget to expand to US$51 billion, surpassing the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, this cost will not boost Russia&#x27;s national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.

The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi saw concern and controversy following a new federal law approved in Russia in June 2013 that bans &quot;homosexual propaganda to minors&quot;. There were also concerns over Islamist militants.

====Construction work====

The state-controlled RAO UES announced in July 2007 that it might spend 30 billion roubles (about US$1.2 billion) on upgrading the electrical power system in the Sochi area by 2014. The power generating companies Inter RAO UES and RusHydro would have to build or modernize four thermal power plants and four hydroelectric plants—and the federal grid company FGC UES has to replace the Central-Shepsi electricity transmission line, which reportedly often fails in bad weather. The new power line would run partly on power towers and partly across the bottom of the Black Sea. By 2011, the power supply of the resort area would increase by 1129 MW—of which 300 MW would be used for Olympic sports facilities. &quot;The cost of the work is estimated at 83.6 billion rubles (about US $3.26 billion), of which 50 billion rubles (about US$2 billion) will go to investments in the electricity grid,&quot; the power companies announced. They did not say how much of the bill the state would foot. In February 2007, when UES had planned to spend 48.8 billion rubles (about US$1.9 billion) on the Sochi area, the share the state had been ready to pay 38 billion roubles (about US$1.48 billion) of that.

===Other sports events===
The Silk Way Rally which is part of Dakar series took place in Sochi in 2010 for the last stage between the capital of the Republic of Adygea Maykop to the city of Sochi through Pseshwap.

President Vladimir Putin had reached a deal with Bernie Ecclestone for the city to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix from 2014. However, because of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sochi is not allowed to host future races.

The World Robot Olympiad took place in the Adler Arena Skating Center on November 21–23, 2014.

The 2014 World Chess Championship between Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen was played in Sochi in November 2014, with Carlsen emerging as the winner.

The Fisht Olympic Stadium was also used to host 2018 FIFA World Cup football matches.

Since 2014, the city has hosted HC Sochi, who play at the Bolshoy Ice Dome in the Kontinental Hockey League.

== Transportation ==
Public transport is represented mainly by bus and taxi. Sochi is served by the Adler-Sochi International Airport. Types of non-mass public transport include two funiculars (at the Central military sanatorium and Ordzhonikidze resort) and three cable cars (at arboretum sanatorium &quot;Dawn&quot; and pension &quot;Neva&quot;) also has several cableways in Krasnaya Polyana.

The Sochi Port terminal building was built in 1955 by Karo Alabyan and Leonid Karlik in Stalinist architecture. It is topped with a 71-meter steepled tower. Sculptures embodying seasons and cardinal points are set above the tower&#x27;s three tiers.

Five of the railway stations of Sochi were renovated for the 2014 Winter Olympics. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta and Khosta railway stations. In Adler city district of Sochi, the original railway station was preserved and new railway station was built near it. Another new railway station was built in Estosadok, close to Krasnaya Polyana.

At some point, plans to construct the light metro network to serve the Olympics were considered; however, the Sochi Light Metro plan was abandoned in favor of the reconstruction of the railway.

<text>In Norse mythology, Glaðsheimr (Old Norse &quot;bright home&quot;) is a realm in Asgard where Odin&#x27;s hall of Valhalla is located according to &quot;Grímnismál&quot;.

Snorri states in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; that Glaðsheimr is a meeting hall containing thirteen high seats where the male Æsir hold council, located in Iðavöllr in Asgard, near the hall of Vingólf where the Ásynjur goddesses gathered.

<text>A glen is a valley, typically one that is long and bounded by gently sloped concave sides, unlike a ravine, which is deep and bounded by steep slopes. The word is Goidelic in origin: &quot;gleann&quot; in Irish and Scottish Gaelic, &quot;glion&quot; in Manx. The designation &quot;glen&quot; also occurs often in place names. Glens are appreciated by tourists for their tranquility and scenery.

== Etymology ==

The word is Goidelic in origin: &quot;gleann&quot; in Irish and Scottish Gaelic, &quot;glion&quot; in Manx. In Manx, &quot;glan&quot; is also to be found meaning glen. It is cognate with Welsh &quot;glyn&quot;. Whittow defines it as a &quot;Scottish term for a deep valley in the Highlands&quot; that is &quot;narrower than a strath&quot;.

Examples in Northern England, such as Glenridding, Westmorland, or Glendue, near Haltwhistle, Northumberland, are thought to derive from the aforementioned Cumbric cognate, or another Brythonic equivalent. This likely underlies some examples in Southern Scotland.

As the name of a river, it is thought to derive from the Irish word &quot;glan&quot; meaning clean, or the Welsh word &quot;gleindid&quot; meaning purity. An example is the Glens of Antrim in Northern Ireland where nine glens radiate out from the Antrim plateau to the sea along the coast between Ballycastle and Larne.

== Places ==
The designation &quot;glen&quot; also occurs often in place names such as Great Glen and Glenrothes in Scotland; Glendalough, Glenswilly, Glen of Aherlow, Glen of Imaal and the Glens of Antrim in Ireland; Glenn Norman in Canada; Glendale, Glen Ellen and Klamath Glen in California, Glenview and Homer Glen in Illinois, and Glenrock in Wyoming; Glenview, Glen Waverley, Glen Eira, Glengowrie, Glen Huntly and Glen Forrest in Australia; and Glenorchy, Glendowie, Glen Eden, Glenledi, Glenomaru, Glen Massey, Glen Murray, Glenleith, Glendhu Bay, Glenbrook, and Glen Innes in New Zealand.

In the Finger Lakes region of New York State, the southern ends of Seneca Lake and Cayuga Lake in particular are etched with glens, although in this region the term &quot;glen&quot; refers most frequently to a narrow gorge, as opposed to a wider valley or strath. The steep hills surrounding these lakes are filled with loose shale from glacial moraines. This material has eroded over the past 10,000 years to produce rocky glens (e.g., Watkins Glen, Fillmore Glen State Park and Treman State Parks) and waterfalls (e.g., Taughannock Falls) as rainwater has flowed down toward the lakes below.

=== Scotland ===
Many place-names in Scotland with &quot;glen&quot; derive from the Gaelic &quot;gleann&quot; (&quot;deep valley&quot;), with some being from the cognates in the Brittonic languages Cumbric and Pictish or from the Gaelic loanword &quot;glen&quot; in Scots.
* Glenalmond, Perthshire
* Glen Affric, Inverness-shire
* Glenbarton, Dumfriesshire - from Gaelic &quot; *gleann-Breatann&quot;, or else Brittonic &quot;glyn-Brython&quot; (&quot;Briton valley&quot;).
* Glencairn, Dumfriesshire
* Glen Coe, Argyll
* Glencortas, Fife - from Gaelic &quot;gleann&quot; + possibly &quot;coirthe&quot; (&quot;standing stone&quot;) + &quot;as&quot; (locational suffix).
* Glendevon, Perthsihire 
* Glendevon, Lanarkshire
* Glendivan, Dumfriesshire
* Glendow, Dumfriesshire - from Middle Irish &quot;glenn-dubh&quot; or Brittonic &quot;glyn-du&quot; (&quot;dark valley&quot;).
* Glen Doll, Perthshire
* Glenduckie, Fife - from Gaelic &quot;gleann&quot; + possibly &quot;duaigh&quot; (&quot;evil&quot;) + &quot;-in&quot; (suffix).
* Glen Etive, Argyll 
* Glengaber, Dumfriesshire 
* Glenkens, Kirkcudbrightshire - Brittonic &quot;glyn&quot; + &quot;Ken&quot; (river name).
* Glenlochar, Kirkcudbrighshire 
* Glen Ogle, Perthshire
* Glenrothes, Fife - from Scots &quot;glen&quot; + Rothes.
* Glensax, Peeblesshire
* Glensaxon, Dumfriesshire
* Glen Shiel, Ross and Cromarty
* Glentanner, Selkirkshire
* Glentenmont, Dumfriesshire
* Glenturk, Wigtownshire
* Glenturret, Perthshire
* Glen Vale, Fife - from Gaelic &quot;gleann-a’-bhealaich&quot; (&quot;glen of the pass&quot;).

=== England ===
Some place-names in England contain the element &quot;Glen&quot;. Many of these are derived from Brittonic cognates of Gaelic &quot;gleann&quot; (Welsh &quot;glyn&quot;).
* Glencoyne, Cumberland - Brittonic &quot;glyn&quot; or Middle Irish &quot;glenn&quot; + possibly a river name.
* Glendinning, Cumberland - Brittonic &quot;glyn&quot; or Middle Irish &quot;glen&quot; + Brittonic &quot;din&quot; (&quot;fort&quot;) + &quot;an&quot;/&quot;in&quot; (suffix).
* Glendon, Devon - possibly a hybrid of Cornish &quot;glyn&quot; and Old English &quot;dun&quot; (&quot;hill&quot;).
* Glendowlin, Westmorland - Brittonic &quot;glyn&quot; or Middle Irish &quot;glenn&quot; + earlier Brittonic &quot;du&quot; (&quot;black&quot;) + &quot;llyn&quot; (&quot;pool&quot;).
* Glendue, Northumberland
* Glendurgan, Cornwall - from Cornish &quot;glynn&quot; (&quot;deep valley&quot;) + &quot;dowrgeun&quot; (&quot;otters&quot;).
* Glenridding, Westmorland - equivalent to Old Welsh &quot;glinnredin&quot; (&quot;bracken valley&quot;).
* Glyn Morlas, Shropshire
* Glynn Kenyel, Cornwall - from Cornish &quot;glynn&quot; (&quot;deep valley&quot;) + &quot;ken&quot; (&quot;meeting, confluence&quot;) + &quot;yel&quot; (adjectival suffix).
Note that some place-names in England with &quot;Glen&quot;, such as Glen Parva in Leicestershire, are actually more likely to derive from river-names named with Brittonic &quot;glan&quot; (&quot;shining&quot;).

=== Wales ===
Some place-names in Wales contain the element &quot;glyn&quot; (&quot;valley&quot;).
* Emlyn, Pembrokshire, from &quot;am-glyn&quot; (&quot;at the valley&quot;)
* Glynceiriog, Denbighshire
* Glyncorrwg, Glamorgan
* Glynneath, Glamorgan
* Glynrhonwy, Carnarfonshire
* Glyn Tarell, Brecknockshire

=== Isle of Man ===
* Glen Maye, Glenfaba
* Glen Wyllin, Kirk Michael
* Silverdale Glen, Malhew
* Tholt-y-Will Glen, Lezayre - also known as Sulby Glen

<text>In Norse mythology, Sköll (Old Norse: , &quot;Treachery&quot; or &quot;Mockery&quot;) is a wolf that, according to Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, chases the Sun (personified as a goddess, Sól) riding her chariot across the sky. Hati Hróðvitnisson chases the Moon (personified, as Máni) during the night. Skӧll and Hati are the sons of the wolf Fenrir, and an unnamed giantess. It is foretold the wolves will chase the Sun and Moon across the skies until Ragnarök, at which point the wolves catch up and devour the celestial beings.

In Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, the mention of Sköll appears when describing the story of Sol, who drives the chariot of the Sun in Norse Mythology. The wolf is seen chasing her after she receives her chariot to carry the Sun. &quot;[Sun] goes at a great pace; her pursuer is close behind her and there is nothing she can do but flee. … There are two wolves and the one pursuing her is called Skoll [Treachery] is the one she fears; he will catch her [at the end of the world].&quot;

According to Rudolf Simek, it is possible that Sköll is another name for Fenrir, and, if so, &quot;there could be a nature-mythological interpretation in the case of Sköll and Hati (who pursues the moon). Such an interpretation suggests the wolves may be intended to describe the phenomenon of parhelia and paraselenae or Sun dogs and Moon dogs, as these are called &#x27;sun-wolf&#x27; in Scandinavian languages (Norwegian , Swedish ).&quot; Rudolf Simek theorizes that Sköll, Hati, and Fenrir are one and the same, deriving from the Hyades star cluster found in the constellation Taurus. The stars form a &quot;V&quot; shape that could have easily been interpreted as the mouth of a wolf.

<text>In Norse mythology Mundilfari (Old Norse: ; rendered variously &quot;Mundilfari&quot;, &quot;Mundilföri&quot; and &quot;Mundilfœri&quot;) (Old Norse, possibly &quot;the one moving according to particular times&quot;) is the father of Sól, goddess associated with the Sun, and Máni, associated with the Moon. Mundilfari is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot; stanza 23, and in chapter 11 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name appears in various forms in attestations for the figure, some of them significantly different, and various theories have been proposed for the name. John Lindow states that if the first element, &quot;mundil-&quot; is related to &quot;mund&quot;, meaning &quot;period of time,&quot; then the name may be a kenning for the Moon, as Rudolf Simek theorizes.

<doc id="88323" wikidata="Q259182" url="?curid=88323" title="Hati Hróðvitnisson">
<text>In Norse mythology, Hati Hróðvitnisson (first name meaning &quot;He Who Hates&quot;, or &quot;Enemy&quot;) is a warg; a wolf that, according to Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, chases Máni, the Moon, across the night sky, just as the wolf Sköll chases Sól, the Sun, during the day, until the time of Ragnarök, when they will swallow these heavenly bodies. Snorri also gives another name for a wolf who swallows the Moon, Mánagarmr (, &quot;Moon-Hound&quot;, or &quot;Moon&#x27;s Dog&quot;).

Hati&#x27;s patronymic &quot;Hróðvitnisson&quot;, attested in both the Eddic poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot; and the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; section of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, indicates that he is the son of Fenrir, for whom Hróðvitnir (&quot;Famous Wolf&quot;) is an alternate name. According to Snorri, Hati&#x27;s mother is the giantess, not named but mentioned in the Eddic poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, who dwells to the east of Midgard in the forest of Járnviðr (&quot;Ironwood&quot;) and &quot;fosters Fenrir&#x27;s kin&quot;. Snorri states that this giantess and witch bears many giants for sons, all in the form of wolves, including Hati and Sköll, who is thus implied to be Hati&#x27;s brother. In two verses of &quot;Völuspá&quot; that Snorri cites, an unnamed son of this giantess is prophesied to snatch the Moon, and also eat the flesh of the dead, spattering the heavens with blood. In contrast the Eddic poem &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot; states that Fenrir himself will destroy the sun.

==Mánagarmr==
Snorri also names a wolf named Mánagarmr (&quot;Moon-Hound&quot;, or &quot;Moon&#x27;s Dog&quot;) as the most powerful of the giantess&#x27;s progeny, and goes on to say that he will swallow the Moon and gorge on the dead. This is presumably an alternate name for Hati or Sköll that Snorri took from folklore. It can be anglicized as &quot;Managarm&quot;, &quot;Manegarm&quot;, &quot;Mánagarm&quot; or &quot;Managarmr&quot;.

<doc id="88324" wikidata="Q622946" url="?curid=88324" title="Aqua Teen Hunger Force">
<text>Aqua Teen Hunger Force (also branded with different alternative titles for seasons 8-11), is an American adult animated television series created by Dave Willis and Matt Maiellaro for Cartoon Network&#x27;s late night programming block Adult Swim. It is about the surreal adventures and antics of three anthropomorphic fast food items: Master Shake, Meatwad, and Frylock, who live together as roommates and frequently interact with their human next-door neighbor, Carl. 

The pilot episode aired as a preview on December 30, 2000. On September 9, 2001, it debuted as an official Adult Swim series. Every episode was directed and written by Willis and Maiellaro, who also provided several voices. Seasons 8–11 were each given a different title, accompanied by different theme music, as a running joke. The series initially concluded on August 30, 2015, after 139 episodes throughout 11 seasons.

&quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters&quot;, a film adaptation of the series, was released in theaters on April 13, 2007, the first adaptation of an Adult Swim series into a feature-length film. A direct-to-video stand-alone sequel, &quot;Aqua Teen Forever: Plantasm&quot;, was released on November 8, 2022. A spin-off series of shorts, &quot;Aquadonk Side Pieces&quot;, was announced the same week, and ran on the network&#x27;s official YouTube channel from April 18 to April 28, 2022. The series airs in broadcast syndication outside the United States and has been released on various DVD sets and other forms of home media, including video on demand streaming. It was the longest-running Adult Swim series until it was surpassed by &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; in 2020; a twelfth season consisting of five episodes was announced in January 2023 and premiered on November 26, 2023, making it the longest-running Adult Swim series yet again.

==Premise==
The series centers on the surreal adventures and antics of three anthropomorphic fast food items: Master Shake, a selfish, pathologically lying milkshake; Frylock, a calm and intelligent box of French fries; and Meatwad, a shapeshifting, childlike ball of ground meat. They live together like relatives and rarely get along with their human neighbor Carl, a middle-aged, boorish, lecherous sports fanatic. The protagonists also encounter new antagonists in most episodes. Some episodes feature cameos from celebrities appearing as fictionalized versions of themselves.

The Mooninites are two aliens from the Moon who frequently appear, serving as primary antagonists and wreaking havoc through a series of illegal or destructive actions. The Mooninites appear more than most characters outside the main cast. Other recurring characters have made several appearances, including Oglethorpe and Emory, MC Pee Pants, Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future, and Markula. Episodes often end with the non-canonical deaths or injuries of major characters, or destruction to their property, only to be restored without explanation in the following episode.

In the show&#x27;s first seven seasons, the protagonists live in a suburban neighborhood in South New Jersey. During the eighth season, the location was changed to Seattle, Washington. The Seattle setting appears entirely identical to the Jersey setting. As of the ninth season, the same neighborhood is identified as &quot;Seattle, New Jersey&quot;.

===Cold openings===
During the first two seasons, episodes cold-opened with a glimpse into the laboratory of Dr. Weird. He and his assistant Steve use the first several seconds of the show to create monsters, disasters, and various things. In earlier episodes of the first season, the monsters or creations usually form the basis of the plot, but as the crime-fighting element of the program disappeared, the Dr. Weird segment became a non sequitur opening gag.

In the third season, the Dr. Weird openings were replaced with segments from the pilot episode of &quot;Spacecataz&quot;, an unaired spin-off created by Willis and Maiellaro. Six episodes were planned for production, but Adult Swim felt there was little that could be made into five more episodes since all the characters were destroyed at the end of the pilot, despite the parent series being predominantly not canonical. These segments featured the Mooninites and Plutonians trading insults, gestures, and practical jokes. The full &quot;Spacecataz&quot; pilot is available as a special feature on the Volume Four DVD box set. The Mooninites appear to outsmart the Plutonians for much of the series including tagging the Plutonians&#x27; ship and reversing a prank that involved 50 million large pizzas.

Cold openings were eliminated starting with the fourth-season premiere, &quot;Dirtfoot&quot;. A one-off cold opening featuring Dr. Weird and Steve was used once again in the season eight premiere &quot;Allen Part One&quot;.

==Production==
===Development===
The three main characters—Master Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad—were originally created for an episode of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; called &quot;Baffler Meal&quot;, where they were the corporate mascots for the fictional fast-food chain &quot;Burger Trench&quot;. The original versions of the trio were prototypes that resembled the future characters, but both Master Shake and Frylock differed in appearance, personality, and voice from their ultimate design. The original name &quot;Teen Hunger Force&quot; refers to the squad&#x27;s mission to conquer hunger in teens.

&quot;Baffler Meal&quot; went through a number of drafts but was not animated or produced until after the series became popular. Instead, the &quot;Space Ghost&quot; episode was initially rewritten as &quot;Kentucky Nightmare&quot;, while the trio, along with Carl, debuted in &quot;Rabbot&quot;, the pilot episode of &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;. A full season consisting of 16 episodes, including &quot;Rabbot&quot;, was put into production shortly thereafter. The series was one of Adult Swim&#x27;s most popular shows.

In early episodes, the trio was identified by Master Shake as the Aqua Teen Hunger Force, which solved crimes for money. After a few episodes, this premise and the characters&#x27; use of the name were dropped. The premise was a trick that had been added to appease Cartoon Network executives, who &quot;didn&#x27;t want to air a show about food just going around and doing random things&quot;. In the show, Frylock says they stopped fighting crime because &quot;that wasn&#x27;t making us a whole lot of money&quot;.

===Writing and direction===
Every episode of &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; was written and directed by series creators Dave Willis and Matt Maiellaro and produced by Williams Street. Much of the dialogue was supplemented with ad-libs and improvisation by the voice talent. The show was fully scripted but ad-libs are included in the final recordings and the shows are animated to include this improvisation. Many of the crew and cast members formerly worked on &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;.

===Voice actors===
The main cast of the series consists of Dana Snyder as Master Shake, Carey Means as Frylock, and series co-creator Dave Willis as both Meatwad and Carl, as well as Ignignokt. In addition to the main cast series co-creator Matt Maiellaro voices Err, Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future, Satan and Markula. Members of the main cast and Maiellaro also voice several minor and one-time characters in addition to their primary roles. All three main characters appear in almost every episode. They are all absent from the season five episode &quot;Sirens&quot; and the season ten episode &quot;Spacecadeuce&quot;. In the season five episode &quot;Robots Everywhere&quot;, Frylock and Master Shake only make brief unseen speaking cameos, while Meatwad is completely absent.

Voiceover artist George Lowe has made several appearances throughout the series. Lowe previously starred as Space Ghost in &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; and the original incarnation of &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot;, from which several cast and crew members moved on to work for &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;. Lowe made his first appearance in &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; in the season one episode &quot;Mail Order Bride&quot; and went on to make several other cameos. He had a prominent appearance as himself in the season four episode &quot;Antenna&quot;, and reprised his role as Space Ghost for a quick appearance in &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters&quot;. Lowe was later considered a member of the main cast in 2011 during &quot;Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1&quot;; he announced the title of each episode and continued to make cameos. Lowe later made another prominent appearance in the &quot;Aqua Something You Know Whatever&quot; episode &quot;Rocket Horse and Jet Chicken&quot;.

Series animator C. Martin Croker, known for his interpretation of Zorak in various shows and specials, provided the voices of both Dr. Weird and Steve during the cold openings for the first two seasons and &quot;Allen Part One&quot;. Croker also voiced several birds in the season seven episode &quot;Eggball&quot;. Andy Merrill has portrayed Oglethorpe alongside Mike Schatz as Emory in several episodes. Merrill is also well known for his interpretation of Brak in several shows and specials and provided the voice of Merle in &quot;Escape from Leprechaupolis&quot; and &quot;The Last One&quot;. MC Chris, who has a history of voicing characters on Adult Swim programs, has provided the voice of MC Pee Pants in several episodes. Chris also provided the voice of eight-year-old Carl in &quot;Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future&quot; and returned for a musical role in the season seven episode &quot;One Hundred&quot; after a long absence. Tommy Blacha joined the recurring cast with the introduction of his character Wongburger in the season four episode &quot;Dickesode&quot;. With the exception of Tommy Blacha, the entire recurring cast reprised their roles in &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters&quot;.

Various comedians, athletes, and other celebrities have made guest appearances, usually credited under pseudonyms due to the series originally using non-union voice talent.

The twelfth season featured Eric Bauza, Brian Cox, Maurice LaMarche, Dan Fogler and Gary Anthony Williams. Unlike the first eleven seasons, the twelfth season is unionized under SAG-AFTRA.

===Alternative titles===
In 2011, for the eighth season, the series&#x27; title was changed to &quot;Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1&quot;; Maiellaro later explained that he and Willis were getting bored with the former title and wanted to &quot;come up with a new fresh open and a whole new show, just to try it out&quot;. Despite the title change there were virtually no changes to the show&#x27;s characters or tone. In 2012 Maiellaro announced that each subsequent season would have a different series title, making it a running gag. Willis later said the alternate titles were just an unsuccessful stunt to generate buzz.

Each season that is branded under an alternate title features a different opening sequence and theme music written by different artists. On most television listings and digital download sites, the alternatively titled episodes are formally listed under their alternative titles, not as episodes of &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;. On most legal digital downloading sites that feature the series, the first 7 seasons are presented as &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; while the alternatively titled seasons are listed separately and treated as if they were each a completely different, one-season series.

===Theme music===
Rapper Schoolly D performed the &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; theme song used in the first seven seasons. An extended remix version of the theme was used in the 2007 film adaptation and in the soundtrack for the 2011 video game &quot;Saints Row: The Third&quot;. After a multi-year absence, Schoolly D returned for the season seven episode &quot;Rabbot Redux&quot;, performing a different theme song used exclusively in that episode. The special intro to &quot;Rabbot Redux&quot; featured the exact animation used in the regular intro. Each subsequent season featured a different theme song by a different artist with a different animated intro. The eighth season was written and performed by Joshua Homme and Alain Johannes. Schoolly D returned for the season nine intro for &quot;Aqua Something You Know Whatever&quot;, writing and performing it with Mariachi El Bronx. The season 10 theme song was produced by Flying Lotus, an artist with a long history of being featured in Adult Swim&#x27;s bumps. Every episode features an opening sequence, with the rare exceptions of the season two episode &quot;The Last One&quot;, the season nine episode &quot;The Granite Family&quot;, and the season ten episode &quot;Spacecadeuce&quot;.

===2015 cancellation===
In 2015, it was announced that Adult Swim had cancelled &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;. The cancellation went against the wishes of Willis and Maiellaro, who first learned about it from the animation studio, Awesome Inc., halfway through the production of the 11th season. Willis said that Adult Swim president Mike Lazzo made the decision to end the series because &quot;he was ready to move on from it&quot;. The double-length episode &quot;The Last One Forever and Ever (For Real This Time) (We Fucking Mean It)&quot; was falsely promoted as the series finale and aired on August 23, 2015. The actual series finale, &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;, was quietly released early online on August 26 before airing four days later, with virtually no advertisement. At the time of its conclusion, &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; was Adult Swim&#x27;s longest-running original series.

===Revival===
During an interview about the series&#x27; cancellation, Maiellaro said there are no plans to revive &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, but that it could return someday. In 2017, Adult Swim was asked why they don&#x27;t make more episodes, to which they responded &quot;we might&quot; via a bump.

In April 2022, Adult Swim began uploading &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; shorts under the name &quot;Aquadonk Side Pieces&quot; to their YouTube channel. These shorts are often less than four minutes and center around the villains in the show, with all original voice actors reprising their roles. In December 2022, Maiellaro announced in an interview that he and Dave Willis were working on five new Aqua Teen scripts. A month later, Adult Swim officially announced the five episodes as the show&#x27;s twelfth season. 

The first 11 seasons were created using Adobe Photoshop images, animated using Adobe After Effects, and edited using Apple&#x27;s Final Cut Pro. Beginning with season 12, the series is animated by Floyd County Productions.

In a May 2024 tweet, Matt Maiellaro indicated that future seasons were unlikely for the time being, describing the show as &quot;cancelled.&quot;

==Films==
===&quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters&quot; (2007)===
A feature film based on the show, &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force: Movie Film for Theaters&quot;, was released on April 13, 2007. The movie follows the origins of the Aqua Teens, which includes an exercise machine, Neil Peart of the band Rush, a watermelon slice named Walter Melon, and an appearance by a heavy metal band Mastodon in the opening sequence. The film also introduces a fourth Aqua Teen, a chicken nugget named Chicken Bittle (voiced by Bruce Campbell). The Plutonians and the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future, recurring characters, both make appearances in the movie, as well as the Mooninites, Dr. Weird and MC Pee Pants (this being his last appearance in the series).

===&quot;Aqua Teen Forever: Plantasm&quot; (2022)===
In a 2010 interview, staff members of Radical Axis stated that a sequel entitled &quot;Death Fighter&quot; was in production, and mentioned the possibility that the film might be made in 3-D. When asked if the film was designed for a theatrical release, a Radical Axis staff member responded yes, but stated: &quot;We&#x27;re not sure if we have a distributor yet&quot;, though this was then followed by the statement that &quot;Adult Swim will never make another movie ever again&quot;.

By 2014, the script for &quot;Death Fighter&quot; had been completed and approved; however, Willis indirectly stated that the project was scrapped, soon after announcing the show&#x27;s cancellation. He later mentioned on Reddit that it would cost $3.4 million to produce, and expressed interest in doing a Kickstarter to fund it. A new film was confirmed to be in production in May 2021, no other details have been confirmed other than it will be a direct-to-video film.

On May 12, 2021, Adult Swim confirmed the production of three new original films, including a new &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; film to make exclusive debuts on HBO Max following a physical/VOD release.

On November 14, 2021, it was announced the film would be released in 2022.

On May 18, 2022, it was revealed the film would be titled &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force: Plantasm&quot;. It was changed to &quot;Aqua Teen Forever: Plantasm&quot;. The film was released on Blu-ray, 4K Ultra HD and digital on November 8, 2022.

==Broadcast==
The pilot episode &quot;Rabbot&quot; originally aired on Cartoon Network on December 30, 2000, as part of a special preview of upcoming Adult Swim shows. Other shows in the preview block included &quot;Sealab 2021&quot;, &quot;The Brak Show&quot;, and &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;. &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; later made its official debut on September 9, 2001, on Adult Swim, where the series has since aired exclusively, in the United States. The final episode &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; made its television debut on August 30, 2015, after having been quietly released online four days earlier.

===International broadcast===
In Canada, &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; previously aired on Teletoon&#x27;s Teletoon at Night block and later G4&#x27;s Adult Digital Distraction block. The series currently airs on the Canadian version of Adult Swim.

In Australia, it began airing on SBS2 starting April 2013, but ceased airing, and returned in July 2016 as part of a version of Adult Swim on 9Go!, with the series airing from the beginning.

==Merchandise==
Several pieces of merchandise have been made for the series, including T-shirts, caps, wristbands, patches, and buttons featuring characters in the series. Master Shake and Carl Halloween costumes for adults were also available. There was also a series of collectible action figures and plush toys available along with car decals. Several pieces of custom merchandise were available on the Adult Swim Shop before the site quietly shut down in March 2012. &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters Colon the Soundtrack&quot;, the soundtrack to the film, was released in stores on April 10, 2007. On November 3, 2009, a Christmas album sung by characters from the show was released entitled &quot;Have Yourself a Meaty Little Christmas&quot; was released in stores.

In September 2010, Adult Swim Shop introduced a full scale, functioning hot air balloon in the likeness of Meatwad at a cost of $70,000. The purchase includes a piloted, one-hour ride anywhere in the continental United States, and the buyer got to keep it although a pilot&#x27;s license would be required to actually fly it. The balloon was the most expensive item on Adult Swim Shop, surpassing the &quot;Metalocalypse&quot; &quot;Dethklok Fountain&quot; fountain, which was released early in 2010 for $40,000. The hot air balloon is no longer available.

===Home releases===
The first eight seasons have been released and distributed on DVD in volumes by Warner Home Video. Each set was also released in Region 2 and by Madman Entertainment in Region 4. The movie was released on a DVD set titled &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters for DVD&quot;, with the season four episode &quot;Deleted Scenes&quot; included as a special feature on August 17, 2007. The season five episode &quot;Robots Everywhere&quot; was also released as a special feature on the &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am&quot; video game on November 5, 2007, months prior to its official television debut on January 20, 2008. The first eleven seasons with the exception of the episodes &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;Shake Like Me&quot; and the film &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters&quot; were released in a 20-disc DVD collection on September 20, 2022, as &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force: The Baffler Meal Complete Collection&quot;. It was the first time that seasons 9-11 have been released on DVD. The episode &quot;Shake Like Me&quot; is not included on the DVD due to its use of blackface, similar to its removal from rerun rotations and HBO Max. A second movie, &quot;Aqua Teen Forever: Plantasm&quot;, was released on Blu-ray and 4K on November 20, 2022.

With the exception of the season four episode &quot;Deleted Scenes&quot;, episodes of &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; are also available on iTunes, the Xbox Live Marketplace, and Amazon Video, with seasons five and up available in HD on iTunes and the Xbox Live Marketplace, and with seasons six up on Amazon Video. The movie is also available in HD and SD on the Xbox Live Marketplace. The season five episode &quot;Boston&quot; has never been released in any form of home media.

The series has been made available for on-demand streaming on Hulu Plus, as part of a deal made with Hulu and Turner Broadcasting. Every episode from all seasons is available for streaming at Hulu. As of May 27, 2020, the series is also available on HBO Max, with the exception of the episodes &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;Shake Like Me&quot;.
===Video games===
There have also been video games created based on the series. &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force: Destruct-O-Thon&quot;, a mobile game based on the series, was published and released by Macrospace games in 2004. In 2005 Oberon Games released &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force: Studio Shakedown&quot; for PC. &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am&quot;, a golfing/kart racing/fighting game, was developed by Creat Studios and published by Midway Games, and released for the PlayStation 2 on November 5, 2007. An online Flash game based on the series entitled &quot;The Worst Game Ever&quot; was released, but was eventually taken down. A game entitled &quot;Carl&#x27;s Freaking Strip Poker&quot; was also available on Adult Swim Games, but was eventually taken down.

==Reception, influence, and legacy==
In January 2009, IGN listed the series as the 39th best in the Top 100 Best Animated TV Shows. The series was nominated for Teen Choice Awards in 2007 and 2008. In 2011 Willis and Maiellaro received Annie Award nominations for writing in the season eight episode, &quot;The Creditor&quot;. In 2019, IGN placed &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; 25th on their list of Top 25 Animated series for adults.

James Rolfe, best known for creating the &quot;Angry Video Game Nerd&quot;, has cited the show as an influence on &quot;Nerd&quot; as well as shaping his sense of humor. YouTuber Jason Gastrow, better known as Videogamedunkey, has also cited the show as a comedic influence.

===2007 Boston bomb scare===

The series received national attention in 2007 because of a publicity stunt that became known as the Boston bomb scare. On January 31, 2007, as part of a national guerrilla marketing campaign for the series, Peter Berdovsky and Sean Stevens installed Lite-Brite-like LED displays depicting the Mooninites in eleven different cities: Boston, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle, Portland, Denver, Austin, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. In Boston, the authorities considered the LEDs suspicious, prompting the closure of major roads and waterways for investigation. Turner Broadcasting System later admitted to placing the LEDs and apologized for the misunderstanding.

Berdovsky and Stevens faced charges for &quot;placing a hoax device and disorderly conduct&quot;; in spite of the uproar, the two mocked the media and critics in interviews. All criminal charges were dropped in exchange for Berdovsky and Stevens apologizing during their court date and accepting a plea bargain that consisted of community service at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Center. Turner Broadcasting paid the Boston Police Department $1 million to cover the investigation&#x27;s cost and an additional $1 million for good will. This was designed to settle criminal and civil claims, while the general manager of Cartoon Network stepped down because of the incident. Of the eleven cities in which the displays were placed, only Boston saw them as a matter of concern. The installations had been up for weeks before the panic.

An &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; episode from season five, &quot;Boston&quot;, was produced as the series creators&#x27; response to the bomb scare, but Adult Swim pulled it to avoid further controversy. The episode has never aired or been formally released to the public legally in any format, though an unfinished version of it was illegally leaked online in January 2015.

The film stars Matthew Broderick, Mia Sara, and Alan Ruck, with supporting roles from Jennifer Grey, Jeffrey Jones, Cindy Pickett, Edie McClurg, Lyman Ward, and Charlie Sheen. It tells the story of a charismatic high school slacker, Ferris, who skips school with his best friend Cameron and his girlfriend Sloane for a day in Chicago, regularly breaking the fourth wall to explain his techniques and inner thoughts.

Hughes wrote the screenplay in less than a week. Filming began in September 1985 and finished in November, featuring many Chicago landmarks including the Sears Tower, Wrigley Field, and the Art Institute of Chicago. The film was Hughes&#x27;s love letter to Chicago: &quot;I really wanted to capture as much of Chicago as I could. Not just in the architecture and landscape, but the spirit.&quot;

Released by Paramount Pictures on June 11, 1986, the film became the tenth-highest-grossing film of 1986 in the United States, grossing $70 million over a $5 million budget. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, who praised Broderick&#x27;s performance, and the film&#x27;s humor and tone.

In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film was followed by a television series, starring Charlie Schlatter as the title character. A spin-off film titled &quot;Sam &amp; Victor&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, focusing on the two valets who took Cameron&#x27;s father&#x27;s Ferrari on a joy ride, is in development for Paramount+.

==Plot==
On a warm and sunny spring day in a Chicago suburb, high school senior Ferris Bueller fakes illness to stay home from school, regularly breaking the fourth wall. His parents, Katie and Tom, believe he is ill, though his sister, Jeanie, does not. After learning Ferris is absent from school for the ninth time that semester, the school&#x27;s dean, Edward Rooney, becomes determined to expose Ferris&#x27;s chronic truancy; Ferris has changed his attendance records by hacking into the school&#x27;s computer system, making it appear as if he attends school regularly.

Ferris persuades his hypochondriac best friend Cameron Frye to help excuse Ferris&#x27;s girlfriend Sloane Peterson from school by claiming that her grandmother has died. Cameron calls the school, pretending to be Sloane&#x27;s father. Knowing Sloane is dating Ferris, Rooney is suspicious. Ferris also calls the school during Cameron&#x27;s phone call to confirm his absence, thereby fooling Rooney. To complete the ruse that Sloane&#x27;s father is picking her up from school, Ferris borrows the prized possession of Cameron&#x27;s father, a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder. Fearing his father&#x27;s wrath, Cameron is dismayed when Ferris takes the car on a day trip into Chicago. Ferris promises they will return the car as it was, including preserving the original odometer mileage.

Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane leave the car with two parking attendants, who promptly take it on a long joyride. The trio eat lunch at an upscale restaurant, visit the Art Institute of Chicago, go to a Chicago Cubs baseball game, and attend the Von Steuben Day Parade, where Ferris jumps on a float and lip syncs to &quot;Danke Schoen&quot; by Wayne Newton and &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; by The Beatles.

Rooney prowls the Bueller home for Ferris, becoming victim to several pratfalls. Jeanie skips class and returns home to confront Ferris, but finds Rooney instead. Shocked by his appearance, she knocks him unconscious and calls the police. Rooney regains consciousness and leaves. The police arrest Jeanie, believing she prank called the police station. While detained, she meets another delinquent who advises her to worry less about Ferris&#x27;s exploits and more about her own life.

Upon collecting the Ferrari and heading home, Ferris and Cameron discover that the car&#x27;s mileage has significantly increased. Cameron becomes semi-catatonic from shock, later almost drowning in a pool before a worried Ferris helps him. At Cameron&#x27;s house, Ferris jacks up the car and runs it in reverse to rewind the odometer. However, this attempt fails and Cameron destroys the car out of anger toward his domineering father. Ferris offers to take the blame, but Cameron decides to tell the truth and stand up to his father.

After walking Sloane home, Ferris remembers his parents will be returning soon. He runs through the neighborhood, but is nearly hit by Jeanie&#x27;s car as Jeanie and Katie are driving home. Katie fails to notice Ferris, though Jeanie does. Ferris makes it home first, but Rooney confronts him before he can get back inside. Seeing the two through the window, Jeanie has a change of heart and allows Ferris to come inside, claiming that Ferris was at the hospital for his illness. She also shows Rooney his wallet that had fallen from his pocket in the kitchen earlier, tosses it into a nearby puddle, and shuts the back door loud enough to wake up the family&#x27;s pet Rottweiler. As Rooney flees the house, Ferris rushes back to his bedroom to await his parents. They find him in bed and believe he has been at home all day.

In a scene that plays during the credits, a humiliated, disheveled, and injured Rooney reluctantly accepts a ride on a school bus filled with students who act derisively toward him. In a post-credits scene, Ferris looks into the camera and says, &quot;You&#x27;re still here? It&#x27;s over! Go home! Go.&quot;

==Cast==

John Hughes made his final on-screen appearance in a cameo role as a man running between the cabs, but was uncredited.

==Production==
===Writing===
As he was writing the film in 1985, John Hughes kept track of his progress in a spiral-bound logbook. He noted that the basic storyline was developed on February 25 and was successfully pitched the following day to Paramount Studios chief Ned Tanen. Tanen was intrigued by the concept, but wary that the Writers Guild of America was hours away from picketing the studio. Hughes wrote the screenplay in less than a week.

Editor Paul Hirsch explained that Hughes had a trance-like concentration to his script-writing process, working for hours on end, and would later shoot the film on essentially what was his first draft of the script. &quot;The first cut of &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; ended up at two hours, 45 minutes. The shortening of the script had to come in the cutting room&quot;, said Hirsch. &quot;Having the story episodic and taking place in one daymeant the characters were wearing the same clothes. I suspect that Hughes writes his scripts with few, if any costume changes just so he can have that kind of freedom in the editing.&quot;

Hughes intended to focus more on the characters rather than the plot. &quot;I know how the movie begins, I know how it ends&quot;, said Hughes. &quot;I don&#x27;t ever know the rest, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. It&#x27;s not the events that are important, it&#x27;s the characters going through the event. Therefore, I make them as full and real as I can. This time around, I wanted to create a character who could handle everyone and everything.&quot;

Edward McNally was rumored as the inspiration for the character Ferris Bueller. McNally grew up on the same street as Hughes, had a best friend named &quot;Buehler&quot;, and was relentlessly pursued by the school dean over his truancy, which amounted to 27 days&#x27; absence, compared to Bueller&#x27;s nine in the film.

===Casting===
Hughes said that he had Broderick in mind when he wrote the screenplay, saying Broderick was the only actor he could think of who could pull off the role, calling him clever and charming. &quot;Certain guys would have played Ferris and you would have thought, &#x27;Where&#x27;s my wallet? Hughes said. &quot;I had to have that look; that charm had to come through. Jimmy Stewart could have played Ferris at 15...I needed Matthew.&quot; Anthony Michael Hall, who had worked with Hughes on three previous films, was offered the part but turned it down as he was busy with other projects. Other actors who were considered for the role included Jim Carrey, John Cusack, Johnny Depp, George Clooney, Tom Cruise, and Michael J. Fox.

Sara surprised Hughes when she auditioned for the role of Sloane Peterson. &quot;It was funny,&quot; she said. &quot;He didn&#x27;t know how old I was and said he wanted an older girl to play the 17-year-old. He said it would take someone older to give her the kind of dignity she needed. He almost fell out of his chair when I told him I was only 18.&quot; Molly Ringwald, who had also wanted to play Sloane, said, &quot;John wouldn&#x27;t let me do it: he said that the part wasn&#x27;t big enough for me.&quot;

Ruck had auditioned for the role of Bender in &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; that went to Judd Nelson, but Hughes remembered Ruck and cast him as the 17-year-old Cameron Frye. Hughes based the character of Cameron on a friend of his in high school: &quot;He was sort of a lost person. His family neglected him, so he took that as license to really pamper himself. When he was legitimately sick, he actually felt good, because it was difficult and tiring to have to invent diseases but when he actually had something, he was relaxed.&quot; Ruck said the role of Cameron had been offered to Emilio Estevez, who turned it down. &quot;Every time I see Emilio, I want to kiss him,&quot; said Ruck. &quot;Thank you!&quot;

Ruck, then 29, worried about the age difference (he was only 6 years younger than Hughes). &quot;I was worried that I&#x27;d be 10 years out of step, and I wouldn&#x27;t know anything about what was cool, what was hip, all that junk. But when I was going to high school, I didn&#x27;t know any of that stuff then, either. So I just thought, well, hell—I&#x27;ll just be me. The character, he&#x27;s such a loner that he really wouldn&#x27;t give a damn about that stuff anyway. He&#x27;d feel guilty that he didn&#x27;t know it, but that&#x27;s it.&quot; Ruck was not surprised to find himself cast young. &quot;No, because, really, when I was 18, I sort of looked 12,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe it&#x27;s a genetic imbalance.&quot;

Ruck and Broderick had previously acted together in the Broadway production of &quot;Biloxi Blues&quot;. Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Peterson&quot; voice was an in-joke imitation of their former director Gene Saks. Ruck felt at ease working with Broderick, often sleeping in his trailer. &quot;We didn&#x27;t have to invent an instant friendship like you often have to do in a movie,&quot; said Ruck. &quot;We &quot;were&quot; friends.&quot;

Jones was cast as Rooney based on his role in &quot;Amadeus&quot;, where he played the emperor; Hughes thought that character&#x27;s modern equivalent was Rooney. &quot;My part was actually quite small in the script, but what seemed to be the important part to me was that I was the only one who wasn&#x27;t swept along by Ferris,&quot; recalls Jones. &quot;So I was the only one in opposition, which presented a lot of opportunities, some of which weren&#x27;t even in the script or were expanded on. John was receptive to anything I had to offer, and indeed got ideas along the way himself. So that was fun, working with him.&quot; &quot;Hughes told me at the time—and I thought he was just blowing his own horn—he said, &#x27;You are going to be known for this for the rest of your life.&#x27; And I thought, &#x27;Sure&#x27;... but he was right.&quot; To help Jones study for the part, Hughes took him to meet his old vice principal. &quot;This is the guy I want you to pay close attention to,&quot; Jones explained to Hughes&#x27;s biographer Kirk Honeycutt. While meeting him, the VP&#x27;s coat momentarily flew open revealing a holster and gun attached to the man&#x27;s belt. This made Jones realize what Hughes had envisioned. &quot;The guy was &#x27;Sign up for the Army quick before I kill you! Jones exclaimed.

Stein says he got the role of Bueller&#x27;s Economics teacher through six degrees of separation. &quot;Richard Nixon introduced me to a man named Bill Safire, who&#x27;s a &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist. He introduced me to a guy who&#x27;s an executive at Warner Brothers. He introduced me to a guy who&#x27;s a casting director. He introduced me to John Hughes. John Hughes and I are among the only Republicans in the picture business, and John Hughes put me in the movie,&quot; Stein said. Hughes said that Stein was an easy and early choice for the role of the teacher: &quot;He wasn&#x27;t a professional actor. He had a flat voice, he looked like a teacher.&quot;

===Filming===

&quot;Chicago is what I am,&quot; said Hughes. &quot;A lot of &quot;Ferris&quot; is sort of my love letter to the city. And the more people who get upset with the fact that I film there, the more I&#x27;ll make sure that&#x27;s exactly where I film. It&#x27;s funny—nobody ever says anything to Woody Allen about always filming in New York. America has this great reverence for New York. I look at it as this decaying horror pit. So let the people in Chicago enjoy &quot;Ferris Bueller&quot;.&quot;

For the film, Hughes got the chance to take a more expansive look at the city he grew up in. &quot;We took a helicopter up the Chicago River. This is the first chance I&#x27;d really had to get outside while making a movie. Up to this point, the pictures had been pretty small. I really wanted to capture as much of Chicago as I could, not just the architecture and the landscape, but the spirit.&quot; Shooting began in Chicago on September 9, 1985. In late October 1985, the production moved to Los Angeles, and shooting ended on November 22. The Von Steuben Day Parade scene was filmed on September 28. Scenes were filmed at several locations in downtown Chicago and Winnetka (Ferris&#x27;s home, his mother&#x27;s real estate office, etc.). Many of the other scenes were filmed in Northbrook, Illinois, including at Glenbrook North High School. The exterior of Ferris&#x27;s house is located at 4160 Country Club Drive, Long Beach, California, which, at the time of filming, was the childhood home of Judge Thad Balkman.

The modernist house of Cameron Frye is located in Highland Park, Illinois. Known as the Ben Rose House, it was designed by architects A. James Speyer, who designed the main building in 1954, and David Haid, who designed the pavilion in 1974. It was once owned by photographer Ben Rose, who had a car collection in the pavilion. In the film, Cameron&#x27;s father is portrayed as owning a Ferrari 250 GT California in the same pavilion. According to Lake Forest College art professor Franz Shulze, during the filming of the scene where the Ferrari crashes out of the window, Haid explained to Hughes that he could prevent the car from damaging the rest of the pavilion. Haid fixed connections in the wall and the building remained intact. Haid said to Hughes afterward, &quot;You owe me $25,000,&quot; and which Hughes paid. In the DVD commentary for the film, Hughes mentions that they had to remove every pane of glass from the house to film the car crash scene, since every pane was weakened by age and had acquired a similar tint, hence replacement panels would be obvious. Hughes added that they were able to use the house because producer Ned Tanen knew the owner because they were both Ferrari collectors.

According to Hughes, the scene at the Art Institute of Chicago was &quot;a self-indulgent scene of mine—which was a place of refuge for me, I went there quite a bit, I loved it. I knew all the paintings, the building. This was a chance for me to go back into this building and show the paintings that were my favorite.&quot; The museum had not been shot in, until the producers of the film approached them. &quot;I remember Hughes saying, &#x27;There are going to be more works of art in this movie than there have ever been before,&#x27;&quot; recalled Jennifer Grey. Among notable works featured in this scene include &quot;A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte&quot; (Georges Seurat, 1884), during which Cameron struggles to find his identity in the face of one of the children in the painting, and &quot;America Windows&quot; (Marc Chagall, 1977), in front of which Ferris and Sloane have a romantic moment.

A passionate Beatles fan, Hughes makes multiple references to them and John Lennon in the script. While filming, Hughes listened to their self-titled 1968 album every single day for 56 days. Hughes also pays tribute to his childhood hero Gordie Howe with Cameron&#x27;s Detroit Red Wings jersey. &quot;I sent them the jersey,&quot; said Howe. &quot;It was nice seeing the No. 9 on the big screen.&quot;

====Car====

In the film, Ferris convinces Cameron to borrow his father&#x27;s rare 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder. &quot;The insert shots of the Ferrari were of the real 250 GT California,&quot; Hughes explains in the DVD commentary. &quot;The cars we used in the wide shots were obviously reproductions. There were only 100 of these cars, so it was way too expensive to destroy. We had a number of replicas made. They were pretty good, but for the tight shots I needed a real one, so we brought one in to the stage and shot the inserts with it.&quot;

Prior to filming, Hughes learned about Modena Design and Development that produced the Modena Spyder California, a replica of the Ferrari 250 GT. Hughes saw a mention of the company in a car magazine and decided to research them. Neil Glassmoyer recalls the day Hughes contacted him to ask about seeing the Modena Spyder:

Automobile restorationist Mark Goyette designed the kits for three reproductions used in the film and chronicled the whereabouts of the cars today:
# &quot;Built by Goyette and leased to Paramount for the filming. It&#x27;s the one that jumps over the camera, and is used in almost every shot. At the end of filming, Paramount returned it to Goyette, with the exhaust crushed and cracks in the body. &quot;There was quite a bit of superficial damage, but it held up amazingly well,&quot; he said. He rebuilt it, and sold it to a young couple in California. The husband later ran it off the road, and Goyette rebuilt the front end for him. That owner sold it in the mid-90s, and it turned up again around 2000, but hasn&#x27;t emerged since.&quot;
# &quot;Sold to Paramount as a kit for them to assemble as their stunt car, they did such a poor job that it was basically unusable, aside from going backwards out the window of Cameron&#x27;s house. Rebuilt, it ended up at Planet Hollywood in Minneapolis and was moved to Planet Hollywood in Cancun when this one was closed.&quot;
# &quot;Another kit, supposed to be built as a shell for the out the window scene, it was never completed at all, and disappeared after the film was completed. Goyette thinks he once heard it was eventually completed and sold off, but it could also still be in a back lot at Paramount.&quot;

One of the &quot;replicars&quot; was sold by Bonhams on April 19, 2010, at the Royal Air Force Museum at Hendon, United Kingdom for . Another &quot;replicar&quot; used in the movie, serial number 001, referenced as the &quot;hero car&quot; that Goyette stated &quot;hasn&#x27;t emerged since&quot; was sold at the 2020 Scottsdale Barrett-Jackson Collector Car Auction on January 18, 2020, for .

The &quot;replicar&quot; was &quot;universally hated by the crew,&quot; said Ruck. &quot;It didn&#x27;t work right.&quot; The scene in which Ferris turns off the car to leave it with the garage attendant had to be shot a dozen times because it would not start. The car was built with a real wheel base, but used a Ford V8 engine instead of a V12. At the time of filming, the original 250 GT California model was worth $350,000. Since the release of the film, it has become one of the most expensive cars ever sold, going at auction in 2008 for and more recently in 2015 for . The vanity plate of Cameron&#x27;s dad&#x27;s Ferrari spells NRVOUS and the other plates seen in the film are homages to Hughes&#x27;s earlier works, VCTN (&quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;), TBC (&quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;), MMOM (&quot;Mr. Mom&quot;), as well as 4FBDO (&quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;).

====Economics lecture====
Ben Stein&#x27;s famous monotonous lecture about the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act was not originally in Hughes&#x27;s script. Stein, by happenstance, was lecturing off-camera to the amusement of the student cast. &quot;I was just going to do it off camera, but the student extras laughed so hard when they heard my voice that (Hughes) said do it on camera, improvise, something you know a lot about. When I gave the lecture about supply-side economics, I thought they were applauding. Everybody on the set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had learned something about supply-side economics. But they were applauding because they thought I was boring. ... It was the best day of my life,&quot; Stein said.

====Parade scene====
The parade scene took multiple days of filming; Broderick spent some time practicing the dance moves. &quot;I was very scared,&quot; Broderick said. &quot;Fortunately, the sequence was carefully choreographed beforehand. We worked out all the moves by rehearsing in a little studio. It was shot on two Saturdays in the heart of downtown Chicago. The first day was during a real parade, and John got some very long shots. Then radio stations carried announcements inviting people to take part in &#x27;a John Hughes movie&#x27;. The word got around fast and 10,000 people showed up! For the final shot, I turned around and saw a river of people. I put my hands up at the end of the number and heard this huge roar. I can understand how rock stars feel. That kind of reaction feeds you.&quot;

Broderick&#x27;s moves were choreographed by Kenny Ortega (who later choreographed &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;). Much of it had to be scrapped, though, for Broderick had injured his knee badly during the scenes of running through neighbors&#x27; backyards. &quot;I was pretty sore&quot;, Broderick said. &quot;I got well enough to do what you see in the parade there, but I couldn&#x27;t do most of Kenny Ortega&#x27;s knee spins and things like that that we had worked on. When we did shoot it, we had all this choreography and I remember John would yell with a megaphone, &#x27;Okay, do it again, but don&#x27;t do any of the choreography&#x27;, because he wanted it to be a total mess.&quot; &quot;Danke Schoen&quot; was somewhat choreographed but for &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, Broderick said, &quot;we were just making everything up.&quot; Hughes explained that much of the scene was spontaneously filmed. &quot;It just happened that this was an actual parade, which we put our float into—unbeknownst to anybody, all the people on the reviewing stand. Nobody knew what it was, including the governor.&quot;

====Wrigley Field====

Wrigley Field is featured in two interwoven and consecutive scenes. In the first scene, Rooney is looking for Ferris at a pizza joint while Harry Caray&#x27;s voice announces the action of a ballgame that is being shown on TV. From the play-by-play descriptions, the uniforms, and the player numbers, this game has been identified as the June 5, 1985, game between the Atlanta Braves and the Chicago Cubs.

In the next scene, Sloane, Cameron, and Ferris are in the left field stands inside Wrigley. Ferris flexes his hand in pain after supposedly catching the foul ball. During this scene, the characters enjoy the game and joke about what they would be doing if they had played by the rules. All these &quot;in the park&quot; shots, including the one from the previous scene where Ferris catches the foul ball on TV, were filmed on September 24, 1985, at a game between the Montreal Expos and the Cubs. During the 1985 season, the Braves and the Expos both wore powder blue uniforms during their road games so, with seamless editing by Hirsch, it is difficult to distinguish that the game being seen and described in the pizza joint is not only a different game but also a different Cubs&#x27; opponent than the one filmed inside the stadium. On October 1, 2011, Wrigley Field celebrated the 25th anniversary of the film by showing it on three giant screens on the infield.

==Post-production==
===Editing===
According to editor Paul Hirsch, in the original cut, the museum scene fared poorly at test screenings until he switched sequences around and Hughes changed the soundtrack.

The music used for the final version of the museum sequence is an instrumental cover version of The Smiths&#x27; &quot;Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want&quot;, performed by The Dream Academy.

===Deleted scenes===
Several scenes were cut from the final film; one lost scene titled &quot;The Isles of Langerhans&quot; has the three teenagers trying to order in the French restaurant, shocked to discover pancreas on the menu (although in the finished film, Ferris still says, &quot;We ate pancreas&quot;, while recapping the day). This is featured on the &quot;Bueller, Bueller&quot; Edition DVD. Other scenes were never made available on any DVD version. These scenes included additional screen time with Jeanie in a locker room, Ferris&#x27;s younger brother and sister (both of whom were completely removed from the film), and additional lines of dialogue throughout the film, all of which can be seen in the original theatrical trailer. Hughes had also wanted to film a scene where Ferris, Sloane, and Cameron go to a strip club. Paramount executives told him there were only so many shooting days left, so the scene was scrapped.

According to former vice president of production for Paramount Pictures Lindsay Doran, an earlier version of the film included a line by Sloane to Cameron during the parade scene when they are discussing their future that resulted in very low scores from young female viewers during test screenings. In the scene, Sloane said, &quot;A girl can always bail out and have a baby and get some guy to support her.&quot; &quot;Girls hated that line,&quot; Doran recalls. &quot;It was meant as an ironic criticism of gender politics,&quot; explained producer Tom Jacobson. &quot;But it went over the heads of the audience and they thought maybe she was espousing them.&quot; After cutting the line, Doran said young female test scores skyrocketed approximately 40 points, which was the most dramatic test screening improvement through cutting a single line that she had ever seen.

The script also included more dialogue that would have explained Charlie Sheen&#x27;s character and provided more context to his scene. Though Sheen&#x27;s character was not named in the film, the script identified him as Garth Volbeck, a friend of Ferris from middle school with a difficult home life. Early in the script, Ferris spoke about how he tried to help Garth turn his life around, but was ultimately unsuccessful as Garth threw his life away due to his substance abuse. This ultimately led to Sheen&#x27;s appearance in the police station, where he reveals that he is Garth. The scene provided extra context to why Ferris&#x27;s motivation as to why he wanted to show Cameron a memorable day – Garth represented Cameron&#x27;s future if Ferris did not get involved. The backstory would have also given additional context as to why Garth was so complimentary towards Ferris in the scene with Jeanie – he still felt loyalty to Ferris from his time when they were friends.

==Music==

===Limited edition fan club soundtrack===
An official soundtrack was not originally released for the film, since director John Hughes felt the songs would not work well together as a continuous album. However, according to an interview with &quot;Lollipop&quot; Magazine, Hughes noted that he had sent 100,000 7&quot; vinyl singles containing two songs featured in the film to members of his fan mailing list. Hughes gave further details about his refusal to release a soundtrack in the &quot;Lollipop&quot; interview:

===Songs in the film===

&quot;Danke Schoen&quot; is one of the recurring motifs in the film and is sung by Ferris, Ed Rooney, and Jeanie. Hughes called it the &quot;most awful song of my youth. Every time it came on, I just wanted to scream, claw my face. I was taking German in high school—which meant that we listened to it in school. I couldn&#x27;t get away from it.&quot; According to Broderick, Ferris&#x27;s singing &quot;Danke Schoen&quot; in the shower was his idea. &quot;Although it&#x27;s only because of the brilliance of John&#x27;s deciding that I should sing &quot;Danke Schoen&quot; on the float in the parade. I had never heard the song before. I was learning it for the parade scene. So we&#x27;re doing the shower scene and I thought, &#x27;Well, I can do a little rehearsal.&#x27; And I did something with my hair to make that Mohawk. And you know what good directors do: they say; &#x27;Stop! Wait until we roll.&#x27; And John put that stuff in.&quot;

Wayne Newton told the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; he was thrilled to have his song featured in the film. &quot;It was really cool because I thought, okay, &#x27;Danke Schoen&#x27; had run its gamut. When I saw [Broderick] doing an impression, lip syncing to my version of the song, I thought that was the coolest thing I had ever seen.&quot; &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; propelled the Beatles&#x27; 1963 recording of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; back onto the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, where it peaked at No. 23 on September 27, 1986, 22 years after its original issue in the US.

===2016 soundtrack===
The soundtrack for the film, limited to 5,000 copies, was released on September 13, 2016, by La-La Land Records. The album includes new wave and pop songs featured in the film, as well as Ira Newborn&#x27;s complete score, including unused cues. Due to licensing restrictions, &quot;Twist and Shout,&quot; &quot;Taking The Day Off,&quot; and &quot;March of the Swivelheads&quot; were not included, but are available elsewhere. The Flowerpot Men&#x27;s &quot;Beat City&quot; makes its first official release on CD with a new mix done by The Flowerpot Men&#x27;s Ben Watkins and Adam Peters that differs from the original 7&quot; fan club release.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film largely received positive reviews from critics. Roger Ebert gave it three out of four stars, calling it &quot;one of the most innocent movies in a long time,&quot; and &quot;a sweet, warm-hearted comedy.&quot; Richard Roeper called the film: Roeper pays homage to the film with a license plate that reads &quot;SVFRRIS&quot;.

Essayist Steve Almond called &quot;Ferris&quot; &quot;the most sophisticated teen movie [he] had ever seen,&quot; adding that while Hughes had made a lot of good movies, &quot;Ferris&quot; was the &quot;one film [he] would consider true art, [the] only one that reaches toward the ecstatic power of teendom and, at the same time, exposes the true, piercing woe of that age.&quot; Almond also applauded Ruck&#x27;s performance, going so far as saying he deserved the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor of 1986: &quot;His performance is what elevates the film, allows it to assume the power of a modern parable.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Nina Darnton criticized Mia Sara&#x27;s portrayal of Sloane for lacking &quot;the specific detail that characterized the adolescent characters in Hughes&#x27;s other films,&quot; asserting she &quot;created a basically stable but forgettable character.&quot; Conversely, Darnton praised Ruck and Grey&#x27;s performances: 

Co-star Ben Stein was exceptionally moved by the film, calling it &quot;the most life-affirming movie possibly of the entire post-war period.&quot; &quot;This is to comedies what &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is to epics,&quot; Stein added. 

&quot;National Review&quot; writer Mark Hemingway lauded the film&#x27;s celebration of liberty. 

Others were less enamored of &quot;Ferris&quot;, many taking issue with the film&#x27;s &quot;rebel without a cause&quot; hedonism. David Denby of &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, called the film &quot;a nauseating distillation of the slack, greedy side of Reaganism.&quot; Author Christina Lee agreed, adding it was a &quot;splendidly ridiculous exercise in unadulterated indulgence,&quot; and the film &quot;encapsulated the Reagan era&#x27;s near solipsist worldview and insatiable appetite for immediate gratification—of living in and for the moment...&quot; Gene Siskel panned the film from a Chicago-centric perspective, saying: &quot;Ferris Bueller doesn&#x27;t do anything much fun ... [t]hey don&#x27;t even sit in the bleachers where all the kids like to sit when they go to Cubs games.&quot; Siskel did enjoy the chemistry between Jennifer Grey and Charlie Sheen. Ebert thought Siskel was too eager to find flaws in the film&#x27;s view of Chicago.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 82% based on 77 critics&#x27; reviews, with an average rating of 7.80/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Matthew Broderick charms in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, a light and irrepressibly fun movie about being young and having fun.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 61 based on 13 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Accolades===
Broderick was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 1987 for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.

===Box office===
The film opened in 1,330 theaters in the United States, and had a total weekend gross of $6,275,647 . Opening at No. 2. &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; total gross in the United States was approximately $70,136,369, making it a box office success. It subsequently became the 10th-highest-grossing film of 1986.

===Rankings===
As an influential and popular film, &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; has been included in many film rating lists. The film is number 54 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;, came 26th in the British &quot;50 Greatest Comedy Films&quot; and ranked number 10 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&#x27;s&quot; list of the &quot;50 Best High School Movies&quot;.

==Cultural influence==
John Hughes said of Bueller, &quot;That kid will either become President of the United States or go to prison.&quot; U.S. President Ronald Reagan viewed the film at Camp David on June 21, 1986. First Lady Barbara Bush paraphrased the film in her 1990 commencement address at Wellesley College: &quot;Find the joy in life, because as Ferris Bueller said on his day off, &#x27;Life moves pretty fast; if you don&#x27;t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it!&#x27;&quot; Responding to the audience&#x27;s enthusiastic applause, she added &quot;I&#x27;m not going to tell George you clapped more for Ferris than you clapped for George.&quot;

Other phrases from &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; such as Stein&#x27;s monotone-voiced &quot;Bueller? ...Bueller? ...Bueller?&quot; (while taking roll call in class), and &quot;Anyone? Anyone?&quot; (trying to probe the students for answers) as well as Kristy Swanson&#x27;s cheerful &quot;No problem whatsoever!&quot; also permeated popular culture. In fact, Stein&#x27;s monotone performance launched his acting career. In 2016, Stein reprised the attendance scene in a campaign ad for Iowa Senator Charles Grassley; Stein intoned the last name of Grassley&#x27;s opponent (Patty Judge), to silence, while facts about her missed votes and absences from state board meetings were listed. Stein then calls out &quot;Grassley,&quot; which gets a response; Stein mutters, &quot;He&#x27;s always here.&quot;

Broderick said of the Bueller role, &quot;It eclipsed everything, I should admit, and to some degree it still does.&quot; Later at the 2010 Oscar tribute to Hughes, he said, &quot;For the past 25 years, nearly every day someone comes up to me, taps me on the shoulder and says, &#x27;Hey, Ferris, is this your day off?&#x27;&quot; In a 2023 interview, Broderick stated that the 1990s &quot;were hard&quot; after starring in the film. Matthew Broderick reprises his role of Bueller in the end credits for &quot;She&#x27;s Having a Baby&quot;. He is among the people that pitch the names of Jake and Kristy&#x27;s baby son.

Ruck says that with Cameron Frye, Hughes gave him &quot;the best part I ever had in a movie, and any success that I&#x27;ve had since 1985 is because he took a big chance on me. I&#x27;ll be forever grateful.&quot; &quot;While we were making the movie, I just knew I had a really good part&quot;, Ruck says. &quot;My realization of John&#x27;s impact on the teen-comedy genre crept in sometime later. Teen comedies tend to dwell on the ridiculous, as a rule. It&#x27;s always the preoccupation with sex and the self-involvement, and we kind of hold the kids up for ridicule in a way. Hughes added this element of dignity. He was an advocate for teenagers as complete human beings, and he honored their hopes and their dreams. That&#x27;s what you see in his movies.&quot;

Broderick starred in a television advertisement prepared by Honda promoting its CR-V for the 2012 Super Bowl XLVI. The ad pays homage to &quot;Ferris Bueller&quot;, featuring Broderick (as himself) faking illness to skip out of work to enjoy sightseeing around Los Angeles. Several elements, such as the use of the song &quot;Oh Yeah&quot;, and a valet monotonously calling for &quot;Broderick... Broderick...&quot;, appear in the ad. A teaser for the ad had appeared two weeks prior to the Super Bowl, which had created rumors of a possible film sequel. It was produced by Santa Monica-based RPA and directed by Todd Phillips. AdWeek&#x27;s Tim Nudd called the ad &quot;a great homage to the original 1986 film, with Broderick this time calling in sick to a film shoot and enjoying another day of slacking.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;Jalopnik&quot;″s Matt Hardigree called the spot &quot;sacrilegious&quot;.

The film has been parodied in television series, with characters taking a day off from their normal routine to have a day of adventure. Examples include the episodes &quot;Barry&#x27;s Day Off&quot; from &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, &quot;Brian Finch&#x27;s Black Op&quot; from &quot;Limitless&quot;, and &quot;Turner&#x27;s and Brenda&#x27;s Day Off&quot; from South Side. In March 2017, Domino&#x27;s Pizza began an advertising campaign parodying the film, featuring actor Joe Keery in the lead role. Early in 2020, internet personality Zach King released a short film parody on his YouTube channel. In September 2020, LiftMaster released a commercial where two young boys attempt to drive a 1966 Jaguar E-Type owned by the father of one of the boys. The commercial, advertising the Liftmaster Secure View, a security system built into the device, features Alan Ruck as an older Cameron Frye, who warns the boys after catching them on camera. He then speaks to the audience &quot;Been there, done that.&quot;

===Music===
The film&#x27;s influence in popular culture extends beyond the film itself to how musical elements of the film have been received as well, for example, Yello&#x27;s song &quot;Oh Yeah&quot;. As Jonathan Bernstein explains, &quot;Never a hit, this slice of Swiss-made tomfoolery with its varispeed vocal effects and driving percussion was first used by John Hughes to illustrate the mouthwatering must-haveness of Cameron&#x27;s dad&#x27;s Ferrari. Since then, it has become synonymous with avarice. Every time a movie, TV show or commercial wants to underline the jaw-dropping impact of a hot babe or sleek auto, that synth-drum starts popping and that deep voice rumbles, &#x27;Oh yeah . . .&#x27;&quot; Yello was unheard of in the United States at the time, but the inclusion of their song in &quot;Ferris Bueller&quot; and &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot; the following year sparked great interest in the song, where it reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and US Dance charts in 1987. It often became referred to as &quot;the Ferris Bueller song&quot; due to its attachment with the movie. Dieter Meier of Yello was able to use the licensing fees from &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; appearance in &quot;Ferris Bueller&quot; and other films to start a series of investments and amassed a large fortune.
Concerning the influence of another song used in the film, Roz Kaveney writes that some &quot;of the finest moments in later teen film draw on Ferris&#x27;s blithe Dionysian fervour — the elaborate courtship by song in &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; (1999) draws usefully on the &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; sequence in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;&quot;. &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; charted again, 16 years after the Beatles broke up, as a result of its prominent appearance in both this film and &quot;Back to School&quot; (where Rodney Dangerfield performs a cover version) which was released the same weekend as &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. The re-released single reached No. 23 in the U.S; a US-only compilation album containing the track &quot;The Early Beatles&quot;, re-entered the album charts at No. 197. The version heard in the film includes brass overdubbed onto the Beatles&#x27; original recording, which did not go down well with Paul McCartney. &quot;I liked [the] film but they overdubbed some lousy brass on the stuff! If it had needed brass, we&#x27;d had stuck it on ourselves!&quot; Upon hearing McCartney&#x27;s reaction, Hughes felt bad for &quot;offend[ing] a Beatle. But it wasn&#x27;t really part of the song. We saw a band [onscreen] and we needed to hear the instruments.&quot; The bands Save Ferris and Rooney were named in allusion to &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. Kanye West and Jay-Z mention the character in the song &quot;Gotta Have It&quot; from their collaboration album &quot;Watch the Throne&quot;. West raps, &quot;I&#x27;ma need a day off, think I&#x27;ll call Ferris up&quot;.

==Academic analysis==
Many scholars have discussed at length the film&#x27;s depiction of academia and youth culture. For Martin Morse Wooster, the film &quot;portrayed teachers as humorless buffoons whose only function was to prevent teenagers from having a good time.&quot;
Regarding not specifically teachers, but rather a type of adult characterization in general, Art Silverblatt asserts that the &quot;adults in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; are irrelevant and impotent. Ferris&#x27;s nemesis, the school disciplinarian, Mr. Rooney, is obsessed with &#x27;getting Bueller.&#x27; His obsession emerges from envy. Strangely, Ferris serves as Rooney&#x27;s role model, as he clearly possesses the imagination and power that Rooney lacks. ... By capturing and disempowering Ferris, Rooney hopes to ... reduce Ferris&#x27;s influence over other students, which would reestablish adults, that is, Rooney, as traditional authority figures.&quot;

Nevertheless, Silverblatt concludes that &quot;Rooney is essentially a comedic figure, whose bumbling attempts to discipline Ferris are a primary source of humor in the film.&quot; Thomas Patrick Doherty writes that &quot;the adult villains in teenpics such as ... &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; (1986) are overdrawn caricatures, no real threat; they&#x27;re played for laughs.&quot; Yet Silverblatt also remarks that casting &quot;the principal as a comic figure questions the competence of adults to provide young people with effective direction—indeed, the value of adulthood itself.&quot;

Adults are not the stars or main characters of the film, and Roz Kaveney notes that what &quot;&quot;Ferris Bueller&quot; brings to the teen genre, ultimately, is a sense of how it is possible to be cool and popular without being rich or a sports hero. Unlike the heroes of &quot;Weird Science&quot;, Ferris is computer savvy without being a nerd or a geek—it is a skill he has taken the trouble to learn.&quot; In 2010, English comedian Dan Willis performed his show &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Way Of...&quot; at the Edinburgh Festival, delving into the philosophy of the movie and looking for life answers within.

==Home media and other releases==

The film has been released on DVD three times; including on October 19, 1999, on January 10, 2006, as the &quot;Bueller... Bueller&quot; edition, and the &quot;I Love the &#x27;80s&quot; edition August 19, 2008. The original DVD, like most Paramount Pictures films released on DVD for the first time, has very few bonus features, but it does feature a commentary by Hughes. Though this is no longer available for sale, the director&#x27;s commentary is available.

The &quot;Bueller... Bueller&quot; DVD re-release has several more bonus features, but does not contain the commentary track of the original DVD release. The edition was released in the United States on January 10, 2006, Sweden on April 12, 2006, Spain on April 18, 2006, and the United Kingdom on May 29, 2006. The &quot;I Love the &#x27;80s&quot; edition is identical to the first DVD release (no features aside from commentary), but includes a bonus CD with songs from the 1980s. The songs are not featured in the film. The &quot;Bueller... Bueller&quot; edition has multiple bonus features such as interviews with the cast and crew, along with a clip of Stein&#x27;s commentaries on the film&#x27;s philosophy and impact.

On October 18, 2004, &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; was issued as part of a UK Digipack DVD collection by Paramount Pictures named &quot;I Love 80s Movies: John Hughes Classic 80s&quot;, which also included &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; (1986), &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot; (1987), and &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot; (1987). It was later part of the United States Warner Bros. DVD set &quot;5 Film Collection: 80&#x27;s Comedy&quot;, issued on September 30, 2014, and also including &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot;, &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot; (1988), &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980), and &quot;Police Academy&quot; (1984). On October 3, 2017, it was released in the United States as part of the DVD collection &quot;5 Iconic Films of the 80s&quot; that also included &quot;The Naked Gun&quot;, &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot;, &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; (1986), and &quot;Harlem Nights&quot; (1989). The film also appeared on two Blu-ray collections: Australia&#x27;s &quot;Films That Define A Decade – 80s Collection&quot; released on April 12, 2017, and France&#x27;s &quot;Pop Culture Anthology 20 Films Cultes Blu-ray&quot; issued on October 17, 2018.

In the United Kingdom, an &quot;80s Collection&quot; edition with new artwork was released on DVD in 2018 with the same six bonus features as the 2006 issue. In 2016 Paramount, Turner Classic Movies, and Fathom Events re-released the film and &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; to celebrate their 30th anniversary. The film was released in 4K to the Ultra HD Blu-ray format on August 1, 2023. This disc includes John Hughes&#x27; commentary track that was first found on the 1999 DVD release.

==Follow-ups==
Broderick and Hughes stayed in touch for a while after production. &quot;We thought about a sequel to &quot;Ferris Bueller&quot;, where he&#x27;d be in college or at his first job, and the same kind of things would happen again,&quot; said Broderick in a 2010 interview. &quot;But neither of us found a very exciting hook to that. The movie is about a singular time in your life.&quot; &quot;&quot;Ferris Bueller&quot; is about the week before you leave school, it&#x27;s about the end of school— in some way, it doesn&#x27;t have a sequel. It&#x27;s a little moment and it&#x27;s a lightning flash in your life. I mean, you could try to repeat it in college or something but it&#x27;s a time that you don&#x27;t keep. So that&#x27;s partly why I think we couldn&#x27;t think of another,&quot; Broderick added.

&quot;But just for fun,&quot; said Ruck, &quot;I used to think why don&#x27;t they wait until Matthew and I are in our seventies and do &quot;Ferris Bueller Returns&quot; and have Cameron be in a nursing home. He doesn&#x27;t really need to be there, but he just decided his life is over, so he committed himself to a nursing home. And Ferris comes and breaks him out. And they go to, like, a titty bar and all this ridiculous stuff happens. And then, at the end of the movie, Cameron dies.&quot;

===Spin-off===
In August 2022, a spin-off film entitled &quot;Sam &amp; Victor&#x27;s Day Off&quot; was announced to be in development for the streaming service Paramount+. Taking place during the events of &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; and focusing on the two titular valets who took Cameron&#x27;s father&#x27;s 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder on a joy ride (originally portrayed in the film by Richard Edson and Larry &quot;Flash&quot; Jenkins), the film would be produced by Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg, and Josh Heald, and written by Bill Posley.

===Television series===

In 1990, a television series titled &quot;Ferris Bueller&quot; started airing on NBC. It starred Charlie Schlatter as Ferris Bueller and Jennifer Aniston as Jeannie Bueller. Jennifer Aniston and Jennifer Grey would subsequently appear together in one episode of the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, their characters (Rachel and Mindy) being the former and current fiancée of Barry Farber. Mindy returns in one further episode but played by another actress.

<text>A tell in poker is a change in a player&#x27;s behavior or demeanor that is claimed by some to give clues to that player&#x27;s assessment of their hand. A player gains an advantage if they observe and understand the meaning of another player&#x27;s tell, particularly if the tell is unconscious and reliable. Sometimes a player may fake a tell, hoping to induce their opponents to make poor judgments in response to the false tell. More often, people try to avoid giving out a tell, by maintaining a poker face regardless of how strong or weak their hand is.

==Examples==
A tell may be common to a class of players or unique to a single player. Some possible tells include leaning forward or back, placing chips with more or less force, fidgeting, doing chip tricks, displaying nervous tics or making any changes in one&#x27;s breathing, tone of voice, facial expressions, direction of gaze or in one&#x27;s actions with the cards, chips, cigarettes or drinks. 

An underlying rule to many tells is: &quot;weak means strong, strong means weak.&quot; Players who hold weak poker hands attempt to convince other players at the table that they are strong: staring down an opponent, throwing chips down forcefully into the pot in an effort to discourage others from calling. Players who hold strong hands tend to try to disguise their hand as being weak. They attempt to fly under the radar by being a passive player at the table - not making direct eye contact, softly tossing the chips in, being friendly and talkative. They are deliberately trying not to come across as intimidating, so as to entice a call.

==Online tells==
Non-physical tells exist in both casino and online poker, but tells like speed of play, betting patterns, the quantity of chips that a player plays with, and player chat can be particularly revealing online.

==Reliability==
A tell can only convey what the player thinks about the strength of his hand and what he thinks the other players have. Thus, perceiving a tell is useful only to the extent that the perceiver can pick up on enough of that information to come to a well-informed decision.

Being human, other players act in nervous or technologically incompetent ways that may make their competitors imagine a tell where none exists, such as dropping chips seemingly expressively, out of clumsiness, or betting the wrong amount by forgetting which chip is which or accidentally clicking on the wrong thing online.

<text>Chatham University is a private university in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Originally founded as a women&#x27;s college, it began enrolling men in undergraduate programs in 2015. It enrolls about 2,110 students, including 1,002 undergraduate students and 1,108 graduate students. 

The university grants certificates and degrees including bachelor, master, first-professional, and doctorate degrees in the School of Arts, Science &amp; Business, the School of Health Sciences, and the Falk School of Sustainability &amp; Environment.

==History==
Founded as the Pennsylvania Female College on December 11, 1869, by Reverend William Trimble Beatty (the father of renowned operatic contralto Louise Homer), it was located in the Berry mansion on Woodland Road off Fifth Avenue in the neighborhood of Shadyside. Shadyside Campus today is composed of buildings and grounds from a number of former private mansions. The college was renamed Pennsylvania College for Women in 1890, and Chatham College in 1955. The latter name was to honor William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, after whom the city of Pittsburgh is named. The school gained university status from the Pennsylvania Department of Education on April 23, 2007, and publicly announced its new status on May 1, 2007, changing its name to Chatham University.

With elements designed for the original Andrew Mellon estate by the Olmsted Brothers, the Shadyside Campus was designated an arboretum in 1998 by the American Association of Botanical Gardens and Arboreta.

In 2005 the university expanded its programs to include online advanced degree programs (bachelors, masters, doctoral) through the School of Continuing Education, now the School for Continuing and Professional Studies. Two years later, Chatham&#x27;s MFA in Creative Writing program was named one of the top five Innovative/Unique Programs by &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;.

Chatham received some national attention in 2014 when it announced that it was engaging in a period of study &quot;considering admitting men for the first time in that college&#x27;s history,&quot; resulting in &quot;reactions of surprise and anger&quot; from its alumnae. Undergraduate men began attending in 2015. The current president of Chatham University is Rhonda Phillips. Phillips is the 10th woman to serve as the university&#x27;s president across its 154-year history.

==Campuses==
Chatham&#x27;s original Shadyside Campus is part of historic Woodland Road. The Shadyside Campus now also includes the Chatham Eastside building, which serves as the home for the health science and interior architecture programs. 
The university&#x27;s new Eden Hall Campus is located north of the city of Pittsburgh in Richland Township, Pennsylvania; it is the home of Chatham&#x27;s Falk School of Sustainability &amp; Environment. Programs at Eden Hall Campus include a Bachelors in Sustainability, a Masters of Sustainability, an MA in Food Studies, and dual degrees in Masters of Sustainability or MA in Food Studies + Masters in Business Administration. The Eden Hall Campus was donated to Chatham University by the Eden Hall Foundation on May 1, 2008. In 2011, the university engaged the architectural team of Berkebile Nelson Immenschuh McDowell (BNIM) of Kansas City, Mo. and the landscape design firm Andropogon Associates of Philadelphia to lead the master planning process. The first phase of development was designed by the firm Mithun, was completed in 2016, and won an award for sustainable development.

In 2013, the Falk Foundation made its largest and final grant to the School of Sustainability &amp; the Environment for the completion of the Eden Hall Campus. The grant was also the largest grant in the history of Chatham University. The School of Sustainability &amp; the Environment was renamed the &quot;Falk School of Sustainability&quot;. The Falk Foundation made its first grant to Chatham in 1952 with the funding of Chatham&#x27;s Falk Hall, named in honor of Laura Falk, wife of foundation founder Maurice Falk.
== Accreditation ==
Chatham University is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

==Athletics==
Chatham University teams, also known as the Cougars, participate as a member of the NCAA Division III. The Cougars are a member of the Presidents&#x27; Athletic Conference (PAC). Chatham has both Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s varsity teams in basketball, cross country, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, squash, swimming &amp; diving, track &amp; field, volleyball, and Co-ed sideline cheerleading. Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey play in the United Collegiate Hockey Conference. 

The women&#x27;s ice hockey team was the first NCAA women&#x27;s ice hockey team in Pennsylvania.

Chatham athletics announced in November 2024 that they will be adding a Co-ed competitive cheerleading team for the 2025-2026 season.

The college mascot was previously Pennsy the Seal. The cougar mascot was adopted in 1992 and was named Carson in honor of alumna Rachel Carson in 2011. In 2023, 55.6% of students participating in a non-binding referendum held by the student government voted to reinstate Pennsy the Seal as the college mascot. The vote did not affect the college mascot.

<doc id="88335" wikidata="Q1324152" url="?curid=88335" title="Gullveig">
<text>Gullveig (Old Norse: ) is a female figure in Norse mythology associated with the legendary conflict between the Æsir and Vanir. In the poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, she came to the hall of Odin (Hár) where she is speared by the Æsir, burnt three times, and yet thrice reborn. Upon her third rebirth, she began practicing seiðr and took the name Heiðr.

Gullveig/Heiðr is solely attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material. Scholars have variously proposed that Gullveig/Heiðr is the same figure as the goddess Freyja, that Gullveig&#x27;s death may have been connected to corruption by way of gold among the Æsir, and/or that Gullveig&#x27;s treatment by the Æsir may have led to the Æsir–Vanir War.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the Old Norse name &quot;Gullveig&quot; remains uncertain. It is a compound formed with the Old Norse word for &#x27;gold&#x27; (&quot;gull&quot;), yet the second element–found in other personal names like &quot;Rannveig&quot;, &quot;Sölveig&quot;, or &quot;Thórveig&quot;–remains obscure. It could have meant &#x27;power, strength&#x27; (cf. Icelandic &quot;veig&quot;, Faroese &quot;veiggj&quot;), &#x27;intoxicating drink&#x27; (cf. Norwegian &quot;veigja&quot;), possibly &#x27;lady&#x27; (cf. Norw. &quot;veiga&quot;) or even &#x27;gold, gold thread&#x27; (cf. Old English &quot;wāg&quot;, Old Saxon &quot;wēg&quot;). The name has been variously translated as &#x27;Gold-drink&#x27;, &#x27;Gold-drunk&#x27;, or as &#x27;Gold-draught&#x27;.&#x27; &quot;Gullveig&quot; is sometimes held to be a personification of gold itself, purified through repeated smelting.&#x27;

The name &quot;Heiðr&quot;, which in adjectival form means &#x27;bright, clear&#x27;, is semantically related. Scholar Rudolf Simek comments that although Gullveig&#x27;s name changes to &quot;Heiðr&quot;, the meaning still remains basically the same.

==Attestations==
Gullveig is solely attested in a stanza of &quot;Völuspá&quot; (Prophecy of the Völva) immediately preceding the story of the Æsir–Vanir War&quot;.&quot; A völva (seeress) recalls that Gullveig was pierced by spears before being burnt three times in the hall of Hárr (one of Odin&#x27;s names), and yet was three times reborn. Presumably after her burning, Gullveig became known as &quot;Heiðr&quot;, a knowledgeable völva who could perform great feats:


==Theories==
Starting with scholar Gabriel Turville-Petre, many scholars such as Rudolf Simek and John Lindow have theorized that Gullveig/Heiðr is the same figure as Freyja. Lindow notes that &quot;since &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; says that Freyja first brought &quot;seid&quot; to the æsir, it is not impossible that Gullveig is Freyja, and that she brought &quot;seid&quot; to the æsir in the first instance either as a strategy in the war, or that her bringing of seid started the war.&quot; Orchard further mentions that Freyja, like Gullveig, is associated with gold and with the form of magic known as &quot;seid&quot;.&quot;&quot;

<text>Counted-thread embroidery is any embroidery in which the number of warp and weft yarns in a fabric are methodically counted for each stitch, resulting in uniform-length stitches and a precise, uniform embroidery pattern. Even-weave fabric is typically used, producing a symmetrical image, as both warp and weft yarns are evenly spaced.

The opposite of counted-thread embroidery is free embroidery.

==Types of counted-thread embroidery==
Among the counted-thread embroidery techniques are:

*Assisi
*Bargello, or Florentine work
*Blackwork
*Canvas work
*Cross-stitch
*Hardanger
*Needlepoint
*Drawn thread work
*Tatreez
