<text>Sir Nigel Barnard Hawthorne (5 April 1929 – 26 December 2001) was a British actor. He is known for his stage acting and his portrayal of Sir Humphrey Appleby, the permanent secretary in the 1980s sitcom &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and the Cabinet Secretary in its sequel, &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;. For this role, he won four BAFTA TV Awards for Best Light Entertainment Performance.

He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for portraying King George III in &quot;The Madness of King George&quot; (1994), having previously won an Olivier Award for the stage version. He later won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actor, for the 1996 series &quot;The Fragile Heart&quot;. He was also an Olivier Award and Tony Award winner for his work in theatre.

==Early life==
Hawthorne was born on 5 April 1929 in Coventry, Warwickshire, the second of four children of Agnes Rosemary (née Rice) and Charles Barnard Hawthorne, a physician.

When Hawthorne was 3 years old, the family moved to Cape Town, South Africa, where his father had bought a practice. Initially they lived in the Gardens and then moved to a newly built house near Camps Bay.

He attended St George&#x27;s Grammar School, Cape Town, and, although the family was not Catholic, at a now-defunct Christian Brothers College, where he played in the rugby team. He described his time at the latter as not being a particularly happy experience.

He enrolled at the University of Cape Town, where he met and sometimes acted in plays with Theo Aronson (later a well-known biographer), but withdrew and returned to the United Kingdom in the 1950s to pursue a career in acting.

==Career==
Hawthorne made his professional stage debut in 1950, playing Archie Fellows in a Cape Town production of &quot;The Shop at Sly Corner&quot;. Unhappy in South Africa, he decided to move to London, where he performed in various small parts including a 1969 appearance in Series 3 Episode 1 of the classic TV comedy series &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; before becoming recognised as a great character actor.

Finding success in London, Hawthorne decided to try his luck in New York City and eventually got a part in a 1974 production of &quot;As You Like It&quot; on Broadway. Around this time, he was persuaded by Ian McKellen and Judi Dench to join the Royal Shakespeare Company. He also supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements, including one for Mackeson Stout, and in the early 1990s starred alongside Tom Conti in a long-running series of commercials for Vauxhall.

He returned to the New York stage in 1990 in &quot;Shadowlands&quot; and won the 1991 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.

Although Hawthorne had appeared in small roles in various British television series since the late 1950s, his most famous role was as Sir Humphrey Appleby, the Permanent Secretary of the fictional Department of Administrative Affairs in the television series &quot;Yes Minister&quot; (and Cabinet Secretary in its sequel, &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;), for which he won four BAFTA awards during the 1980s. He became a household name throughout the United Kingdom, which finally opened the doors to film roles. In 1982, Hawthorne appeared in Richard Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;Gandhi&quot;, alongside a distinguished international cast including Martin Sheen, John Mills, Candice Bergen, John Gielgud, Ian Charleson and Ben Kingsley. That same year, he starred opposite Clint Eastwood in the Cold War thriller &quot;Firefox&quot;, where he played a dissident Russian scientist.

Other film roles during this time included &quot;Demolition Man&quot;, which he detested for being &quot;brainless&quot; and a &quot;cheap picture&quot;. However, it led to his most famous role: that of King George III in Alan Bennett&#x27;s stage play &quot;The Madness of George III&quot; (for which he won a Best Actor Olivier Award) and then the film adaptation entitled &quot;The Madness of King George&quot;, for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and won the BAFTA Film Award for Best Actor. (The title was changed lest US audiences misunderstand ‘III’.)

After this success his friend Ian McKellen asked him to play his doomed brother, Clarence, in &quot;Richard III&quot;, and Steven Spielberg asked him to play lame-duck president Martin Van Buren in &quot;Amistad&quot;. He won a sixth BAFTA for the 1996 TV mini-series &quot;The Fragile Heart&quot;. He also drew praise for his role of Georgie Pillson in the London Weekend Television series &quot;Mapp and Lucia&quot;.

Hawthorne was also a voice actor and lent his voice to two Disney films: Fflewddur Fflam in &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; (1985) and Professor Porter in &quot;Tarzan&quot; (1999). He also voiced Captain Campion in the animated film adaptation of &quot;Watership Down&quot; (1978).

==Personal life==
An intensely private person, he was annoyed at having been outed as gay in 1995 in the publicity surrounding the Academy Awards, but he did attend the ceremony with his long-time partner, Trevor Bentham, and afterwards he spoke openly about being gay in interviews and in his autobiography, &quot;Straight Face&quot;, which was published posthumously.

Hawthorne met Bentham in 1968 when the latter was stage-managing the Royal Court Theatre. From 1979 until Hawthorne&#x27;s death in 2001 they lived together in Radwell and then at Thundridge, both in Hertfordshire. The two of them became fund-raisers for the North Hertfordshire hospice and other local charities.

==Death==
Hawthorne died from a heart attack at his home on 26 December 2001, aged 72. He had recently undergone several operations for pancreatic cancer, which he was diagnosed with in mid-2000, but had been discharged from hospital for the Christmas holidays. He was survived by Bentham, and his funeral service was held at St Mary&#x27;s, the parish church of Thundridge near Ware, Hertfordshire, following which he was cremated at Stevenage Crematorium. His funeral was attended by Derek Fowlds, who had played Bernard in &quot;Yes, Minister&quot; and &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;, Maureen Lipman, Charles Dance, Loretta Swit and Frederick Forsyth along with friends and local people. The service was led by the Right Reverend Christopher Herbert, the Bishop of St Albans. The coffin had a wreath of white lilies and orchids and Bentham was one of the pallbearers.

On hearing of Hawthorne&#x27;s death Alan Bennett described him in his diary: &quot;Courteous, grand, a man of the world and superb at what he did, with his technique never so obvious as to become familiar as, say, Olivier&#x27;s did or Alec Guinness&#x27;s.&quot;

==Honours==
He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1987 New Years Honours List and was knighted in the 1999 New Years Honours List &quot;for services to the Theatre, Film and Television.&quot;

<doc id="93755" wikidata="Q192907" url="?curid=93755" title="Financial statement">
<text>Financial statements (or financial reports) are formal records of the financial activities and position of a business, person, or other entity.

Relevant financial information is presented in a structured manner and in a form which is easy to understand. They typically include four basic financial statements accompanied by a management discussion and analysis:

# A balance sheet reports on a company&#x27;s assets, liabilities, and owners equity at a given point in time.
# An income statement reports on a company&#x27;s income, expenses, and profits over a stated period. A profit and loss statement provides information on the operation of the enterprise. These include sales and the various expenses incurred during the stated period. 
# A statement of changes in equity reports on the changes in equity of the company over a stated period.
# A cash flow statement reports on a company&#x27;s cash flow activities, particularly its operating, investing and financing activities over a stated period.
Notably, a balance sheet represents a snapshot in time, whereas the income statement, the statement of changes in equity, and the cash flow statement each represent activities over an accounting period. By understanding the key functional statements within the balance sheet, business owners and financial professionals can make informed decisions that drive growth and stability.
==Purpose for financial statements==
&quot;The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, performance and changes in financial position of an enterprise that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic decisions.&quot; 
Financial statements should be understandable, relevant, reliable and comparable. Reported assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses are directly related to an organization&#x27;s financial position. 

Financial statements are intended to be understandable by readers who have &quot;a reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and accounting and who are willing to study the information diligently.&quot; Financial statements may be used by users for different purposes:

*Owners and managers require financial statements to make important business decisions that affect its continued operations. Financial analysis is then performed on these statements to provide management with a more detailed understanding of the figures. These statements are also used as part of management&#x27;s annual report to the stockholders.
*Employees also need these reports in making collective bargaining agreements (CBA) with the management, in the case of labor unions or for individuals in discussing their compensation, promotion and rankings.
*Prospective investors make use of financial statements to assess the viability of investing in a business. Financial analyses are often used by investors and are prepared by professionals (financial analysts), thus providing them with the basis for making investment decisions.
*Financial institutions (banks and other lending companies) use them to decide whether to grant a company with fresh working capital or extend debt securities (such as a long-term bank loan or debentures) to finance expansion and other significant expenditures.
*Stockholders may from time to time request insight into how share capital is managed, which may be made available via financial statements (or stock statements), as it lies in the financial interest of shareowners in affirming that capital stock is handled viably and mindfully with duly care.

==Consolidated==
Consolidated financial statements are defined as &quot;Financial statements of a group in which the assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent (company) and its subsidiaries are presented as those of a single economic entity&quot;, according to International Accounting Standard 27 &quot;Consolidated and separate financial statements&quot;, and International Financial Reporting Standard 10 &quot;Consolidated financial statements&quot;.

==Standards and regulations==
Different countries have developed their own accounting principles over time, making international comparisons of companies difficult. To ensure uniformity and comparability between financial statements prepared by different companies, a set of guidelines and rules are used. Commonly referred to as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), these set of guidelines provide the basis in the preparation of financial statements, although many companies voluntarily disclose information beyond the scope of such requirements.

Recently there has been a push towards standardizing accounting rules made by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). IASB develops International Financial Reporting Standards that have been adopted by Australia, Canada and the European Union (for publicly quoted companies only), are under consideration in South Africa and other countries. The United States Financial Accounting Standards Board has made a commitment to converge the U.S. GAAP and IFRS over time.

==Management discussion and analysis==
Management discussion and analysis or MD&amp;A is an integrated part of a company&#x27;s annual financial statements. The purpose of the MD&amp;A is to provide a narrative explanation, through the eyes of management, of how an entity has performed in the past, its financial condition, and its future prospects. In so doing, the MD&amp;A attempt to provide investors with complete, fair, and balanced information to help them decide whether to invest or continue to invest in an entity.

The section contains a description of the year gone by and some of the key factors that influenced the business of the company in that year, as well as a fair and unbiased overview of the company&#x27;s past, present, and future.

MD&amp;A typically describes the corporation&#x27;s liquidity position, capital resources, results of its operations, underlying causes of material changes in financial statement items (such as asset impairment and restructuring charges), events of unusual or infrequent nature (such as mergers and acquisitions or share buybacks), positive and negative trends, effects of inflation, domestic and international market risks, and significant uncertainties.

<doc id="93759" wikidata="Q194419" url="?curid=93759" title="Richard Branson">
<text>Sir Richard Charles Nicholas Branson (born 18 July 1950) is an English business magnate who co-founded the Virgin Group in 1970, and controlled 5 companies remaining of once more than 400.

Branson expressed his desire to become an entrepreneur at a young age. His first business venture, at the age of 16, was a magazine called &quot;Student&quot;. In 1970, he set up a mail-order record business. He opened a chain of record stores, Virgin Records—later known as Virgin Megastores—in 1972. Branson&#x27;s Virgin brand grew rapidly during the 1980s, as he started the Virgin Atlantic airline and expanded the Virgin Records music label. In 1997, Branson founded the Virgin Rail Group to bid for passenger rail franchises during the privatisation of British Rail. The Virgin Trains brand operated the InterCity West Coast franchise from 1997 to 2019, the InterCity CrossCountry franchise from 1997 to 2007, and the InterCity East Coast franchise from 2015 to 2018. In 2004, he founded spaceflight corporation Virgin Galactic, based at Mojave Air and Space Port in California, noted for the SpaceShipTwo suborbital spaceplane designed for space tourism.

In March 2000, Branson was knighted at Buckingham Palace for &quot;services to entrepreneurship&quot;. Due to his work in retail, music, and transport, his taste for adventure, and for his humanitarian work, he has become a prominent global figure. In 2007, he was placed in the &quot;Time&quot; 100 Most Influential People in the World list. In June 2023, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed Branson&#x27;s estimated net worth at US$3 billion.

On 11 July 2021, Branson travelled as a passenger onboard Virgin Galactic Unity 22 at the edge of space, a suborbital test flight for his spaceflight company Virgin Galactic. The mission lasted approximately one hour, reaching a peak altitude of . At 70, Branson became the third oldest person to fly to space.

==Early life==
Richard Charles Nicholas Branson was born on 18 July 1950 in Blackheath, Royal Borough of Greenwich, London, the son of Edward James Branson (1918–2011), a barrister, and his wife Evette Huntley Branson (; 1924–2021), a former ballet dancer and air hostess. He has two younger sisters, Lindy and Vanessa. His grandfather, Sir George Arthur Harwin Branson, was a judge of the High Court of Justice and a Privy Councillor.

Branson&#x27;s great-great-great-grandfather, John Edward Branson, left England for India in 1793; John Edward&#x27;s father, Harry Wilkins Branson, later joined his son in Madras. Starting from 1793, four generations of Branson&#x27;s family lived in India, mostly at Cuddalore, in modern-day Tamil Nadu. On the show &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, Branson was shown to have 3.9% South Asian (Indian) DNA, likely through intermarriage. Later, he stated that one of his great-great-great-grandmothers was an Indian named Ariya.

Branson was educated at Scaitcliffe School, a prep school in Surrey, before briefly attending Cliff View House School in Sussex. He attended Stowe School, a private school in Buckinghamshire until the age of sixteen.

Branson has dyslexia, and had poor academic performance; on his last day at school, his headmaster, Robert Drayson, told him he would either end up in prison or become a millionaire. Branson has also talked openly about having ADHD. Branson&#x27;s parents were supportive of his endeavours from an early age. His mother was an entrepreneur; one of her most successful ventures was building and selling wooden tissue boxes and wastepaper bins. In London, he started off squatting from 1967 to 1968.

Branson is an atheist. He said in a 2011 interview with CNN&#x27;s Piers Morgan that he believes in evolution and the importance of humanitarian efforts but not in the existence of God. &quot;I would love to believe,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s very comforting to believe&quot;.

== Early business career ==
After failed attempts to grow and sell both Christmas trees and budgerigars, Branson launched a magazine named &quot;Student&quot; in 1966 with Nik Powell. The first issue of &quot;Student&quot; appeared in January 1968, and a year later, Branson&#x27;s net worth was estimated at £50,000. The office for the venture was situated in the crypt of St. John&#x27;s Church, off Bayswater Road, in London. Though not initially as successful as he hoped, the magazine later became a vital component of the mail-order record business Branson started from the same church he used for &quot;Student&quot;. Branson used the magazine to advertise popular albums, driving his record sales. He interviewed several prominent personalities of the late 1960s for the magazine including Mick Jagger and R. D. Laing. Branson took over full direction of &quot;Student&quot; after successfully lying to Powell that the workers at the magazine opposed Powell&#x27;s plans to turn the magazine into a cooperative.

His business sold records for considerably less than the &quot;High Street&quot; outlets, especially the chain WHSmith. Branson once said, &quot;There is no point in starting your own business unless you do it out of a sense of frustration.&quot; At the time, many products were sold under restrictive marketing agreements that limited discounting, despite efforts in the 1950s and 1960s to limit retail price maintenance.

Branson eventually started a record shop in Oxford Street in London. In 1971, he was questioned in connection with the selling of records declared export stock. The matter was never brought before a court because Branson agreed to repay any unpaid purchase tax of 33% and a £70,000 fine. His parents re-mortgaged the family home to help pay the settlement.

==Virgin==
===1972–1980: Founding of Virgin Records===

In 1972, using money earned from his record store, Branson launched the record label Virgin Records with Nik Powell. The name &quot;Virgin&quot; was suggested by one of Branson&#x27;s early employees because they were all new at business. Branson bought a country estate north of Oxford in which he installed a residential recording studio, The Manor Studio. He leased studio time to fledgling artists, including multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield, whose debut album &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; (1973) was the first release for Virgin Records and became a chart-topping best-seller.

Virgin signed controversial bands such as the Sex Pistols, which other companies were reluctant to sign. Virgin Records would go on to sign other artists including the Rolling Stones, Peter Gabriel, XTC, Japan, UB40, Steve Winwood and Paula Abdul, and to become the world&#x27;s largest independent record label. It also won praise for exposing the public to such lesser known avant-garde music as Faust and Can. Virgin Records also introduced Culture Club to the music world.

Branson&#x27;s net worth was estimated at £5 million by 1979, and a year later, Virgin Records went international.

=== 1981–1987: Package holiday industries, compilation albums, and Virgin Atlantic ===

Branson&#x27;s first successful entry into the airline industry was during a trip to Puerto Rico. His flight was cancelled, so he decided to charter his own plane the rest of the way and offered a ride to the rest of the stranded passengers for a small fee to cover the cost.

In 1982, Virgin purchased the gay bar Heaven. In 1991, in a consortium with David Frost, Branson made an unsuccessful bid for three ITV franchises under the CPV-TV name. The early 1980s also saw his only attempt as a producer—on the novelty record &quot;Baa, Baa, Black Sheep&quot;, by The Singing Sheep in association with Doug McLean and Grace McDonald, on which he was credited as &quot;Jeff Mutton&quot;. The track consisted of samples of animal noises recorded at his aunt Claire Hoares&#x27; farm in Norfolk, set to a drum-machine-produced track and reached number 42 in the UK charts in 1982.

In 1983, &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music!&quot; emerged from Virgin Records offices as a unique compilation series, distinct in its originality. Collaborating with EMI, Peter Jamieson orchestrated the partnership on Richard Branson&#x27;s boat, leading to the concise and impactful title &quot;&quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music!&quot;,&quot; inspired by a Danish Bacon poster gifted to Simon Draper. Richard Branson&#x27;s introduction to the antique shop owned by Joan Templeman, played a pivotal role in his growing fascination with old signs and advertisements, ultimately shaping the collection.

Branson formed Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Cargo in 1984. He formed Virgin Holidays in 1985.

=== 1988–2000: Telecoms ventures, railways, and worldwide impact ===

In 1992, to keep his airline company afloat, Branson sold the Virgin label to EMI for £500 million. Branson said that he wept when the sale was completed because the record business had been the very start of the Virgin empire. He created V2 Records in 1996 to re-enter the music business, owning 5% himself. Virgin also acquired European short-haul airline Euro Belgian Airlines and renamed it Virgin Express. In 1997, Branson took what many saw as being one of his riskier business exploits by entering into the railway business during the privatisation of British Rail in the late 1990s. Virgin Rail Group won the InterCity CrossCountry and InterCity West Coast franchises, beginning operations in January and March 1997 respectively. Both franchises were scheduled to run for 15 years.

A series of disputes in the early 1990s caused tension between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways, which viewed Virgin as an emerging competitor. Virgin subsequently accused British Airways of poaching its passengers, hacking its computers, and leaking stories to the press that portrayed Virgin negatively. After the so-called campaign of &quot;dirty tricks&quot;, British Airways settled the case, giving £500,000 to Branson, a further £110,000 to his airline, and had to pay legal fees of up to £3 million. Branson distributed his compensation (the so-called &quot;BA bonus&quot;) among his staff.

Branson launched Virgin Mobile in 1999, and airline Virgin Blue in Australia in 2000.

=== 2001–2007: Entry into space travel and Virgin Media ===

On 25 September 2004, Branson announced the signing of a deal under which a new space tourism company, Virgin Galactic, will license the technology behind SpaceShipOne—funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and designed by aeronautical engineer Burt Rutan—to take paying passengers into suborbital outer space. Virgin Galactic plans to make flights available to the public with tickets priced at US$200,000 using the Scaled Composites White Knight Two. The spacecraft, SpaceShipTwo, is manufactured by The Spaceship Company, which was founded by Branson and Rutan and is now solely owned by Virgin Galactic. In 2013, Branson said that he planned to take his two children, 31-year-old Holly and 28-year-old Sam, on a trip to outer space when they ride the SpaceShipTwo rocket plane on its first public flight, then planned for 2014. As part of his promotion of the firm, Branson has added a variation of the Virgin Galactic livery to his personal business jet, the Dassault Falcon 900EX &quot;Galactic Girl&quot; (G-GALX).

He was ninth in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Rich List 2006 of the wealthiest people or families in the UK, worth slightly more than £3 billion. Branson wrote in his autobiography of the decision to start an airline.

In 2006, through a merger with SN Brussels Airlines, Virgin Airlines formed Brussels Airlines, while retaining its separate listing. It also started a national airline based in Nigeria, called Virgin Nigeria, which ceased operations in 2009. Another airline, Virgin America, began flying out of San Francisco International Airport in August 2007.

Branson&#x27;s next venture with the Virgin group was Virgin Fuels, which was set up to respond to global warming and exploit the recent spike in fuel costs by offering a revolutionary, cheaper fuel for automobiles and, in the near future, aircraft. Branson has stated that he was formerly a global warming sceptic and was influenced in his decision by a breakfast meeting with Al Gore.

On 21 September 2006, Branson pledged to invest the profits of Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Trains in research for environmentally-friendly fuels. The investment is estimated to be worth $3 billion.

On 4 July 2006, Branson sold his Virgin Mobile company to UK cable TV, broadband, and telephone company NTL:Telewest for £900 million. A new company was launched with much fanfare and publicity on 8 February 2007, under the name Virgin Media. The decision to merge his Virgin Media Company with NTL was made in order to integrate compatible areas of the two businesses. Whilst Branson had owned three-quarters of Virgin Mobile, he would now get paid £8.5 million per annum for the use of the Virgin brand name. He does not own any part of Virgin Media.

In 2006, Branson formed Virgin Comics and Virgin Animation, an entertainment company focused on creating new stories and characters for a global audience. The company was founded with author Deepak Chopra, filmmaker Shekhar Kapur, and entrepreneurs Sharad Devarajan and Gotham Chopra. Branson also launched the Virgin Health Bank on 1 February 2007, offering parents-to-be the opportunity to store their baby&#x27;s umbilical cord blood stem cells in private and public stem-cell banks.

In June 2006, a tip-off from Virgin Atlantic led both UK and US competition authorities to investigate price-fixing attempts between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways. In August 2007, British Airways was fined £271 million over the allegations. Virgin Atlantic was given immunity for tipping off the authorities and received no fine—a controversial decision the Office of Fair Trading defended as being in the public interest.
On 9 February 2007, Branson announced the setting up of a new global science and technology prize—The Virgin Earth Challenge—in the belief that history has shown that prizes of this nature encourage technological advancements for the good of mankind. The Virgin Earth Challenge was to award $25 million to the individual or group who are able to demonstrate a commercially viable design that will result in the net removal of anthropogenic, atmospheric greenhouse gases each year for at least ten years without countervailing harmful effects. This removal must have long-term effects and contribute materially to the stability of the Earth&#x27;s climate. Branson also announced that he would be joined in the adjudication of the prize by a panel of five judges, all world authorities in their respective fields: Al Gore, Sir Crispin Tickell, Tim Flannery, James E. Hansen, and James Lovelock.

In July 2007, Branson purchased his Australian home, Makepeace Island, in Noosa. In August 2007, Branson announced that he had bought a 20-per cent stake in Malaysia&#x27;s AirAsia X.

On 13 October 2007, Branson&#x27;s Virgin Group sought to add Northern Rock to its empire after submitting an offer that would result in Branson personally owning 30% of the company and changing the company&#x27;s name from Northern Rock to Virgin Money. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; ran a campaign against his bid; Vince Cable, financial spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, suggested in the House of Commons that Branson&#x27;s criminal conviction for tax evasion might be felt by some as a good enough reason not to trust him with public money.

In September 2023, Branson declared his decision against injecting additional funds into Virgin Galactic, his space travel company experiencing financial losses. He highlighted that his business empire no longer possesses extensive financial resources, indicating constraints on further investment.

=== 2008–2019: Hotels, healthcare and charitable influence ===
On 9 January 2008, Virgin Healthcare announced that it would open a chain of health care clinics that would offer conventional medical care alongside homeopathic and complementary therapies, a development that was welcomed by Ben Bradshaw, the UK&#x27;s health minister.

Plans where GPs could be paid for referring National Health Service (NHS) patients to private Virgin services were abandoned in June 2008. The BMA warned the plan would &quot;damage clinical objectivity&quot;, there would be a financial incentive for GPs to push patients toward the Virgin services at the centre. Plans to take over an NHS Practice in Swindon were abandoned in late September 2008.
In February 2009, Branson&#x27;s Virgin organization was reported as bidding to buy the former Honda Formula One team. Branson later stated an interest in Formula One, but claimed that, before the Virgin brand became involved with Honda or any other team, Formula One would have to develop a more economically efficient and environmentally responsible image. At the start of the 2009 Formula One season on 28 March, it was announced that Virgin would be sponsoring the new Brawn GP team, with discussions also under way about introducing a less &quot;dirty&quot; fuel in the medium term. After the end of the season and the subsequent purchase of Brawn GP by Mercedes-Benz, Branson invested in an 80% buyout of Manor Grand Prix, with the team being renamed Virgin Racing.

In August 2012, when re-tendered the InterCity West Coast franchise was awarded to FirstGroup after a competitive tender process overseen by the Department for Transport. Branson had expressed his concerns about the tender process and questioned the validity of the business plan submitted by FirstGroup. When Virgin Rail lost the contract, Branson said he was convinced the civil servants had &quot;got their maths wrong&quot;. In October, after an investigation into the bidding process, the deal was scrapped. The Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced there were &quot;significant technical flaws&quot; in the process and mistakes had been made by transport staff. Virgin Rail continued to operate the West Coast line until 7 December 2019, when it was replaced by Avanti West Coast.

In September 2014, Branson announced his investment in drone company 3D Robotics stating, &quot;It&#x27;s amazing to see what a little flying object with a GoPro attached can do. Before they came along the alternative was an expensive helicopter and crew. I&#x27;m really excited about the potential 3D Robotics sees in drones. They can do a lot of good in the world, and I hope this affordable technology will give many more people the chance to see our beautiful planet from such a powerful perspective.&quot;

In 2014, Branson launched the &quot;Foodpreneur&quot; food and drink-focused start-up competition. Winners were provided with mentorship from Branson, legal support, and brand counseling.

In September 2018, Branson took part in his fourth Virgin Strive Challenge, where he and a core team travelled more than 2,000 km from Cagliari in Sardinia to the summit of Mont Blanc entirely under human and sail power. It was a gruelling month-long challenge where they hiked, biked and kayaked across Europe and had a near-miss on Mont Blanc when a rockfall rained down on them as they crossed the perilous Gouter Couloir. They raised more than £1m for Holly and Sam Branson&#x27;s charity Big Change, which supports young people.

In February 2019, Branson helped organise an international benefit concert, Venezuela Aid Live, to bring worldwide attention to the humanitarian crisis and raise funds for humanitarian aid. The concert took place on 22 February in Cúcuta, Colombia, on the Venezuelan border.

=== 2020–present: COVID-19 difficulties ===
In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic which saw a dramatic decline in international air travel of around 60% globally, Branson and Virgin attracted criticism by asking staff to take eight weeks&#x27; unpaid leave. In response to the global pandemic, Branson put his luxury Necker Island up as collateral for a commercial loan to save Virgin Atlantic from going bust. Branson said: &quot;Over the five decades I have been in business, this is the most challenging time we have ever faced... From a business perspective, the damage to many is unprecedented and the length of the disruption remains worryingly unknown.&quot; On 5 May 2020, it was announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the airline would lay off 3000 staff, reduce the fleet size to 35 by the summer of 2022, retire the Boeing 747-400s and would not resume operations from Gatwick following the pandemic.

On 11 July 2021, Richard Branson took a flight with Beth Moses, Sirisha Bandla and Colin Bennett and reached edge of space (86 kilometers or 53 miles) on a Virgin Galactic spacecraft called VSS &quot;Unity&quot;.

== Failed business ventures ==
Branson has been involved in a number of failed business ventures, such as Virgin Cola, Virgin Cars, Virgin Publishing, Virgin Clothing and Virgin Brides. However, Branson holds an optimistic view of failure. He has written: &quot;I suppose the secret to bouncing back is not only to be unafraid of failures but to use them as motivational and learning tools... There&#x27;s nothing wrong with making mistakes as long as you don&#x27;t make the same ones over and over again.&quot;

==World record attempts==
Branson made several world record-breaking attempts after 1985, when in the spirit of the Blue Riband he attempted the fastest Atlantic Ocean crossing by ship. His first attempt in the Virgin Atlantic Challenger led to the boat capsizing in British waters and a rescue by Royal Navy helicopter, which received wide media coverage. Some newspapers called for Branson to reimburse the government for the rescue cost. In 1986, in his Virgin Atlantic Challenger II, he beat the record by two hours with sailing expert Daniel McCarthy. A year later his hot air balloon Virgin Atlantic Flyer crossed the Atlantic.

In January 1991, Branson crossed the Pacific from Japan to Arctic Canada, , in a balloon of . This broke the record, with a speed of .

Between 1995 and 1998, Branson, Per Lindstrand, Vladimir Dzhanibekov, Larry Newman, and Steve Fossett made attempts to circumnavigate the globe by balloon. In late 1998, they made a record-breaking flight from Morocco to Hawaii but were unable to complete a global flight before Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones in &quot;Breitling Orbiter 3&quot; in March 1999.

In March 2004, Branson set a record by travelling from Dover to Calais in a Gibbs Aquada in 1 hour, 40 minutes and 6 seconds, the fastest crossing of the English Channel in an amphibious vehicle. The previous record of six hours was set by two Frenchmen.
The cast of &quot;Top Gear&quot;, Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, attempted to break this record in 2007 with an amphibious vehicle which they had constructed and, while successfully crossing the channel, did not break Branson&#x27;s record. After being intercepted by the Coast Guard and asked what their intentions were, Clarkson remarked &quot;...our intentions are to go across the Channel faster than &#x27;Beardy&#x27; Branson!&quot;. The Coast Guard wished them &#x27;Good luck and Bon Voyage&#x27;.

In September 2008, Branson and his children made an unsuccessful attempt at an eastbound record crossing of the Atlantic Ocean under sail in the sloop &quot;Virgin Money&quot;. The boat, also known as &quot;Speedboat&quot;, is owned by NYYC member Alex Jackson, who was a co-skipper on this passage, with Branson and Mike Sanderson. After two days, four hours, winds of force 7 to 9 (strong gale), and seas of , a &#x27;monster wave&#x27; destroyed the spinnaker, washed a ten-man life raft overboard and severely ripped the mainsail. The sloop eventually continued to St. George&#x27;s, Bermuda.

==Television, film and print==

Branson has guest starred, usually playing himself, on several television shows, including &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Baywatch&quot;, &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;, &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, &quot;The Day Today&quot;, a special episode of the comedy &quot;Goodness Gracious Me&quot; and &quot;Tripping Over&quot;. Branson made several appearances during the 1990s on the BBC Saturday morning show &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot;, where he was referred to as &#x27;the pickle man&#x27; by comedy act Trev and Simon (in reference to Branston Pickle).

Branson also appears in a cameo early in XTC&#x27;s &quot;Generals and Majors&quot; video. He was also the star of a reality television show on Fox called &quot;The Rebel Billionaire: Branson&#x27;s Quest for the Best&quot; (2004), in which sixteen contestants were tested for their entrepreneurship and sense of adventure and only lasted one season.

His high public profile often leaves him open as a figure of satire—the 2000 AD series &quot;Zenith&quot; features a parody of Branson as a supervillain, as the comic&#x27;s publisher and favoured distributor and the Virgin group were in competition at the time. He is also caricatured in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Monty Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; as the tycoon Arthur Fortune, as the ballooning megalomaniac Richard Chutney (a pun on Branson, as in Branston Pickle) in &quot;Believe Nothing&quot;, and voiced himself in &quot;The Princess Guide&quot;. The character Grandson Richard 39 in Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Wings is modelled on Branson.

He has a cameo appearance in several films: &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (2004), where he played a hot-air balloon operator, and &quot;Superman Returns&quot; (2006), where he was credited as a &#x27;Shuttle Engineer&#x27; and appeared alongside his son, Sam, with a Virgin Galactic-style commercial suborbital shuttle at the centre of his storyline. He also has a cameo in the James Bond film &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006). Here, he is seen as a passenger going through Miami Airport security check-in and being frisked – several Virgin Atlantic planes appear soon after. British Airways edited out Branson&#x27;s cameo in their in-flight screening of the movie. He makes a number of brief and disjointed appearances in the documentary &quot;Derek and Clive Get the Horn&quot; (1979), which follows the exploits of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore recording their final comedy album. Branson and his mother were also featured in the documentary film &quot;Lemonade Stories&quot;. On the TV series &quot;Rove Live&quot; in early 2006, Rove McManus and Sir Richard pushed each other into a swimming pool fully clothed live on TV during a &quot;Live at your house&quot; episode.

Branson is a &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan and named his new spaceship VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot; in honour of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; spaceships, and in 2006, reportedly offered actor William Shatner a ride on the inaugural space launch of Virgin Galactic. In an interview in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, published on 10 August 2009, Shatner claimed that Branson approached him asking how much he would pay for a ride on the spaceship. In response, Shatner asked &quot;how much would you pay &quot;me&quot; to do it?&quot;

In August 2007, Branson announced on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; that he had named a new aircraft Air Colbert. He later doused political satirist and talk show host Stephen Colbert with water from his mug. Branson subsequently took a retaliatory splash from Colbert. The interview quickly ended, with both laughing as shown on the episode aired on Comedy Central on 22 August 2007. The interview was promoted on &quot;The Report&quot; as the &quot;Colbert-Branson Interview Trainwreck&quot;. Branson then made a cameo appearance in &quot;The Soup&quot;, playing an intern working under Joel McHale who had been warned against getting into water fights with Stephen Colbert, and being subsequently fired.

In March 2008, he launched Virgin Mobile in India; during that period, he made a cameo appearance in Bollywood film &quot;London Dreams&quot;. In July 2010, Branson narrated Australian sailor Jessica Watson&#x27;s documentary about her solo sailing trip around the world.

In April 2011, Branson appeared on CNN&#x27;s Mainsail with Kate Winslet. Together they re-enacted a famous scene from the 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot; for the cameras. On 17 August 2011, he was featured in the premiere episode of Hulu&#x27;s first long-form original production entitled, &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;.

At the 2012 Pride of Britain Awards on ITV on 30 October, Branson, along with Michael Caine, Elton John, Simon Cowell and Stephen Fry, recited Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;If—&quot; in tribute to the 2012 British Olympic and Paralympics athletes.

In 1998, Branson released his autobiography, titled &quot;Losing My Virginity&quot;, an international best-seller. Branson was deeply saddened by the disappearance of fellow adventurer Steve Fossett in September 2007; the following month he wrote an article for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, titled &quot;My Friend, Steve Fossett&quot;.

==Humanitarian initiatives==

In the late 1990s, Branson and musician Peter Gabriel discussed with Nelson Mandela their idea of a small group of leaders working to solve difficult global conflicts. On 18 July 2007, in Johannesburg, South Africa, Mandela announced the formation of a new group, The Elders. Kofi Annan served as Chair of The Elders and Gro Harlem Brundtland as deputy chair. The Elders is funded by a group of donors, including Branson and Gabriel.
In 1999, Branson became a founding sponsor of the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (&quot;ICMEC&quot;), the goal of which is to help find missing children, and to stop the exploitation of children, as his mother Eve became a founding member of ICMEC&#x27;s board of directors.

Through the Carbon War Room, founded in 2009, the entrepreneur sought solutions for global warming and the energy crisis. &quot;We all have a part to play, but I believe entrepreneurs will have a really significant role to play in bringing investment and commercial skills to help develop the new technologies needed to grow a post-carbon economy&quot;, he said in his interview with &quot;Vision&quot;. Through Carbon War Room initiative he has focused efforts on finding sustainable alternatives for three industry sectors: shipping, energy efficiency and aviation and renewable jet fuels.

He also launched Virgin Startup, an official delivery partner for the UK&#x27;s Start Up Loans programme. Through this new organisation, he provided loans to entrepreneurs between the ages of 18 and 30 UK-wide. A pilot of the scheme, which ran over 11 months, injected £600,000 into 100 businesses.

Branson&#x27;s other work in South Africa includes the Branson School of Entrepreneurship, set up in 2005 as a partnership between Virgin Unite, the non-profit foundation of Virgin, and entrepreneur Taddy Blecher, the founder of CIDA City Campus, a university in Johannesburg. The school aims to improve economic growth in South Africa by supporting start-ups and micro-enterprises with skills, mentors, services, networks and finance arrangements. Fundraising activity to support the school is achieved by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Fast Track 100, sponsored by Virgin Group, at its yearly event, where places to join Richard Branson on trips to South Africa to provide coaching and mentoring to students are auctioned to attendees. In 2009, Jason Luckhurst and Boyd Kershaw of Practicus, Martin Ainscough of the Ainscough Group and Matthew Riley of Daisy Communications helped raise £150,000 through the auction.

In March 2008, Branson hosted an environmental gathering at his private island, Necker Island, in the Caribbean with several entrepreneurs, celebrities, and world leaders. They discussed global warming-related problems, hoping that the meeting would be a precursor to future discussions regarding similar problems. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, and Larry Page of Google were in attendance.

On 8 May 2009, Branson took over Mia Farrow&#x27;s hunger strike for three days in protest of the Sudanese government expulsion of aid groups from the Darfur region. In 2010, he and the Nduna Foundation (founded by Amy Robbins), and Humanity United (an organization backed by Pam Omidyar, the wife of eBay founder Pierre Omidyar) founded Enterprise Zimbabwe.

In December 2013, Branson urged companies to boycott Uganda because of its &quot;anti-homosexuality bill&quot;. Branson stated that it would be &quot;against my conscience to support this country...governments must realize that people should be able to love whoever they want.&quot;

In 2014, Branson joined forces with African Wildlife Foundation and partner WildAid for the &quot;Say No&quot; Campaign, an initiative to bring public awareness to the issues of wildlife poaching and trafficking.

Branson is an opponent of the death penalty, stating: &quot;the death penalty is always cruel, barbaric and inhumane. It has no place in the world.&quot; In 2015, Branson released a letter in support of American inmate Richard Glossip on the day he was due to be executed, and in 2021 Branson was among the public figures who called on Singapore to halt the execution of Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam, a Malaysian drug trafficker who was convicted and sentenced to Singapore&#x27;s death row for heroin trafficking. After Nagaenthran was executed by hanging at Changi Prison, Branson expressed disappointment in Singapore for its &quot;relentless machinery of death&quot; since it left &quot;no room for decency, dignity, compassion, or mercy&quot;. In October 2022, the Singapore Ministry of Home Affairs invited Branson to Singapore for a live televised debate on Singapore&#x27;s approach towards drugs and the death penalty with K Shanmugam, Singapore&#x27;s Minister for Home Affairs and Law. Branson rejected the offer. In 2023, Branson once again spoke up against Singapore&#x27;s stance of capital punishment when he protested against the upcoming execution of Tangaraju Suppiah, a 46-year-old Singaporean who was found guilty of trafficking 1 kg of marijuana and scheduled to hang on 26 April 2023, and Branson claimed that Tangaraju was &quot;innocent&quot; of the crime he was convicted for. Before the execution of Saridewi Djamani on 28 July 2023, Branson also appealed for mercy on Saridewi&#x27;s behalf; Saridewi was the first female offender to be executed in Singapore, 19 years after the hanging of Yen May Woen in 2004. 

In February 2025, Branson used his social media accounts to draw attention to the case of Alabama death row prisoner Toforest Johnson. Branson wrote on Instagram that &quot;[a]n innocent man has been on Alabama&#x27;s death row for over 26 years, but there is still time to fix this tragic mistake.&quot; Branson&#x27;s post encouraged his followers to listen to the podcast &quot;Earwitness&quot;, which tells Johnson&#x27;s story.

In October 2018, Branson spoke out for Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who was killed by Saudi authorities in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey by suspending his advisory role from Saudi Arabia&#x27;s biggest Red Sea tourism project. He issued a statement saying, &quot;The disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, if proved true, would clearly change the ability of any of us in the West to do business with the Saudi Government.&quot;

On 1 December 2020 Virgin Orbit launched The Patti Grace Smith Fellowship, designed to offer paid work experience and mentorship in the aerospace industry for &#x27;extraordinary Black students.&#x27;

===Climate change pledge===

In 2006, Branson made a high-profile pledge to invest $3 billion toward addressing global warming over the course of the following decade. However, author and activist Naomi Klein has criticised Branson for contributing &quot;well under $300 million&quot; as of 2014, far below the originally stated goal. Additionally, Klein says Virgin airlines&#x27; greenhouse gas emissions increased considerably in the years following his pledge.

=== B Team ===
Branson is the co-founder of the B Team, a global nonprofit organization that was founded in 2013 by a group of business leaders who are committed to using their influence to drive positive change and promote sustainable business practice. The B Team has several focus areas, including climate action, human rights, and responsible tax practices. The organisation also advocates for gender equality and diversity and inclusion in the workplace, recognizing that these issues are critical to achieving sustainable business practices.

==Politics==
In the 1980s, Branson was briefly given the post of &quot;litter Tsar&quot; by Margaret Thatcher—charged with &quot;keeping Britain tidy&quot;. During the BBC Coverage of the 1997 UK General Election, Branson was interviewed at the Labour Party celebrations at the Royal Festival Hall. In 2005, he declared that there were only negligible differences between the two main parties on economic matters. He was suggested as a candidate for Mayor of London before the first 2000 election, with polls indicating he would be a viable candidate, but he did not express interest.

In March 2015, Branson said that almost all drug use should be decriminalised in the UK, following the example of Portugal.

Branson supported continuing British membership of the European Union and was opposed to the 2016 referendum. On 28 June 2016, interviewed for ITV&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;, he said that his company had lost a third of its value as a result of the referendum result and that a planned venture, employing more than 3,000 people, which he had announced before the referendum, had been shelved. He gave his backing for a second referendum. Branson endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 US presidential election.

Branson openly criticised the Philippine drug war marred by allegations of extrajudicial killings. In September 2016, he, along with former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour and former Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, wrote a letter to then-Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte calling on his government to halt the killings and develop evidence-based policies to address the Philippines&#x27; drug situation.

After expressing his opposition to the death penalty for crimes such as drug trafficking, in October 2022, Branson was invited by Singapore&#x27;s government to participate in a live television debate regarding this country&#x27;s approach to drugs and the death penalty. However, Branson declined this invitation, stating that such debates often focus on the personalities rather than the issue itself.

==Tax evasion==
In 1971 Branson was convicted for tax evasion and was briefly jailed, for one night, having fraudulently obtained export documents for records to be sold on the domestic market to avoid paying Purchase Tax. Customs officials caught onto the scheme and executed a sting operation, marking records bought for the international market with invisible ink and subsequently buying them on the domestic market. Branson was advised of the sting by an anonymous tip-off and attempted to dispose of the evidence, but this was unsuccessful.

Branson&#x27;s business empire is owned by a complicated series of offshore trusts and companies. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; stated that his wealth is calculated at £3 billion; if he were to retire to his Caribbean island and liquidate all of this, he would pay relatively little in tax. Branson has been criticised for his business strategy, and has been accused of being a carpetbagger. Branson responded that he is living on Necker for health rather than tax reasons.

In 2013, Branson described himself as a &quot;tax exile&quot;, having saved millions in tax by ending his mainland British residency and living in the British Virgin Islands. This was echoed by the then Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, Labour&#x27;s John McDonnell, in 2016, amid calls for his knighthood to be revoked.

==Personal life==
Branson married Kristen Tomassi in 1972 and divorced her in 1979. They had no children together. In 1976, Branson met Joan Templeman and later began a relationship with her. Three children were born during the course of the relationship: daughter Clare Sarah (b. 1979) who died only four days after birth; another daughter Holly (b. 1981) and a son Sam (b. 1985). In 1989, Branson and Templeman married on Necker Island.

In 2017, Branson&#x27;s Necker Island home was left uninhabitable after Hurricane Irma. It was the second time the Necker Island home had been severely damaged, after the building caught fire when it was struck by lightning caused by Hurricane Irene in 2011. Branson&#x27;s mother Eve died from COVID-19 complications in January 2021 at the age of 96. A celebration of her life was posted online by her son.

In 2007, Branson was ordained as a minister by the Universal Life Church Monastery to conduct an on-flight wedding as part of a marketing effort for domestic flights in the USA on Virgin America airline. From 2013 to 2017, he served as President of the Old Stoic Society of Stowe School.

In November 2017, singer Antonia Jenae, a backing singer for Joss Stone, claimed Branson sexually assaulted her at Necker Island by &quot;putting his head between her cleavage and making boat engine noises&quot;, a practice that, when performed consensually, is known as motorboating. A spokesperson for Branson confirmed to &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper that members of the band had been invited for a party on the island in 2010, but that he and friends and family in attendance had &quot;no recollection&quot; of the events and that &quot;there would never have been any intention to offend or make anyone feel uncomfortable. Richard apologises if anyone felt that way.&quot;

Branson is an experienced kitesurfer, and set two world records in the sport. The first was as the oldest person to kitesurf across the English Channel. Then in 2014 he broke the Guinness World Record for most people riding a surfboard by kiting with three women attached to him, including professional kiteboarder Susi Mai and entrepreneur Alison Di Spaltro. Also an avid cyclist, in August 2016 he was injured while riding his bicycle in the British Virgin Islands, resulting in torn ligaments and a cracked cheek.

==Influences==
Branson has stated in a number of interviews that he has been much influenced by non-fiction books. He most commonly mentions Nelson Mandela&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Long Walk to Freedom&quot;, explaining that Mandela was &quot;one of the most inspiring men I have ever met and had the honour to call my friend.&quot; Owing to his interest in humanitarian and ecological issues, Branson also lists Al Gore&#x27;s best-selling book, &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;, and &quot;The Revenge of Gaia&quot; by James Lovelock among his favourites. According to Branson&#x27;s book, &quot;Screw It, Let&#x27;s Do It: Lessons in Life&quot;, he is also a fan of Jung Chang&#x27;s &quot;Wild Swans&quot; and Antony Beevor&#x27;s &quot;Stalingrad&quot;. In fiction, Branson has long admired the character Peter Pan, and in 2006, he founded Virgin Comics LLC, stating that Virgin Comics will give &quot;a whole generation of young, creative thinkers a voice&quot;.

<text>Showgirls is a 1995 erotic drama film directed by Paul Verhoeven, written by Joe Eszterhas, starring Elizabeth Berkley, Kyle MacLachlan, Gina Gershon, Glenn Plummer, Robert Davi, Alan Rachins, and Gina Ravera. An ambitious young woman hitches a ride to Vegas to pursue her dreams of being a professional dancer and showgirl.

Produced on a then-sizable budget of around $45 million, significant controversy and hype surrounding the amounts of sex and nudity in the film preceded its theatrical release. In the United States, it was rated NC-17 for &quot;nudity and erotic sexuality throughout, some graphic language, and sexual violence.&quot; &quot;Showgirls&quot; was the first (and to date only) NC-17 film to be given a wide release in mainstream theaters. Distributor Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) dispatched several hundred staffers to theaters across North America playing &quot;Showgirls&quot; to ensure that patrons would not sneak into the theater from other films, and to make sure filmgoers were over the age of 17. Audience restriction due to the NC-17 rating, coupled with poor reviews, resulted in the film becoming a box-office bomb, grossing just $37.8 million against a budget of $45 million.

Despite a negative theatrical and critical consensus, &quot;Showgirls&quot; enjoyed success on the home video/VHS market, generating more than $100 million from rentals alone, allowing the film to turn a profit. Since its video release, &quot;Showgirls&quot; has gone on to become one of MGM&#x27;s top twenty all-time bestsellers. For its home video release, Verhoeven prepared an R-rated edition for rental outlets that could not (or would not) carry NC-17 films. The R-rated edit runs about 3 minutes shorter, omitting some footage deemed to be more graphic. This version was later also available on television networks, such as HBO and In Demand (Pay Per View).

&quot;Showgirls&quot; was universally panned upon its cinematic release, and is still consistently ranked as one of the worst films of all time. Despite this, in the 21st century, it has come to be regarded as a cult film, with a dedicated fanbase; &quot;Showgirls&quot; has also been subject to critical re-evaluation, with some notable directors and critics considering it a serious satire worthy of praise.

== Plot ==
Young drifter Nomi Malone hitchhikes to Las Vegas, where she aspires to make it as a showgirl. After being robbed by a man who picked her up, Nomi meets Molly Abrams, a young professional in the Las Vegas entertainment industry; Molly ultimately takes Nomi in as a roommate. To make ends meet, Nomi begins poledancing and stripping at Cheetah&#x27;s Gentleman&#x27;s Club, run by Al Torres. Molly invites Nomi to visit her at work, backstage at the Stardust Resort and Casino, where she is a seamstress and costume designer for &quot;Goddess&quot;, the Stardust&#x27;s traditional Vegas-style, topless dance revue. While there, Nomi meets Cristal Connors, the lead female of the &quot;Goddess&quot; cast. While making smalltalk, Nomi mentions to Cristal that she dances at Cheetah&#x27;s; upon hearing this, Cristal derisively tells Nomi that what she does is akin to &quot;prostitution&quot;. Upset, Nomi refuses to go to work at Cheetah&#x27;s that night; she and Molly go dancing at the Crave Club. Nomi then starts a fight with James Smith, a bouncer at Crave, and is subsequently arrested. Later, she pays James little mind when he bails her out of jail.

Cristal and her boyfriend, Zack Carey (the entertainment director at the Stardust Casino), visit Cheetah&#x27;s to see what Nomi does, with the two requesting a lap dance from her. Although the bisexual Cristal is attracted to her, the lap dance request is based more on a desire to humiliate Nomi, by insinuating that she truly does engage in a form of prostitution. Reluctantly, after Cristal offers her $500, Nomi performs the requested lap dance. James, the bouncer at Crave, and who happens to be at Cheetah&#x27;s that night, gets a peek at Nomi&#x27;s lap dance; the next day, he visits Nomi&#x27;s trailer, suggesting, yet again, that what she is doing is no different than prostitution. James choreographs a new dance routine for Nomi, but then wants to have sex with her in-exchange; when Nomi refuses, James gives the role to Pennya former co-worker of Nomi&#x27;s.

Later, Cristal arranges for Nomi to audition for the chorus line of &quot;Goddess&quot;. Tony Moss, the show&#x27;s director, humiliates Nomi, asking her to rub ice cubes on her nipples to harden them for the topless audition. Furious, Nomi abruptly leaves the audition after scattering ice everywhere, in a fit. Despite her audition, Nomi gets the job and subsequently quits Cheetah&#x27;s. Cristal then further humiliates Nomi, suggesting that she should make a &#x27;goodwill appearance&#x27; at a boat &#x27;trade show&#x27;, which turns out to be a thinly-disguised prostitution/sex trafficking set-up. The chance to be Cristal&#x27;s understudy comes up after she hurts herself. Undeterred, Nomi sets out for revenge against Cristal by claiming her role in &quot;Goddess&quot;. She seduces Cristal&#x27;s boyfriend, Zack, who then secures an audition for Nomi to be Cristal&#x27;s understudy. Nomi wins the role, but when Cristal threatens legal action against the Stardust, the offer is rescinded. After Cristal taunts her even more, Nomi snaps, and pushes Cristal down a flight of stairs, causing her to break her hip. Only after the injury is Cristal officially replaced by Nomi as the show&#x27;s lead. Despite having finally secured the fame she sought, Nomi is disillusioned. She further alienates her roommate and friend Molly, who realizes Nomi caused the hip injury.

Molly later relents, attending Nomi&#x27;s opening-night celebration at a lavish hotel, where she meets her idol, musician Andrew Carver. Carver lures her to a room, where he brutally beats her before he and his two security-guard friends proceed to gang-rape her to the point of hospitalization. Nomi finds out and immediately wants to call the police. Zack explains that the Stardust will bribe Molly with hush money to protect Carver (one of their star performers), before then explaining about Nomi&#x27;s &#x27;sordid&#x27; past: Zack discovered that &quot;Nomi&quot; was born Polly Ann Costello in San Francisco, from which she ran-away at age 15 to work as a prostitute after her parents&#x27; murder–suicide in 1989. After escaping from a foster home in nearby Oakland, California, the following year, Polly changed her name several times. She was also, Zack says, arrested several times, in several states, for various crimes ranging from drug possession and exchanging sex for money to assault with a deadly weapon. Zack blackmails Polly (Nomi), vowing to conceal her past as long as she agrees to not report the rape and assault.

Unable to obtain justice for Molly without exposing her own dubious past, Nomi decides to take matters into her own hands. After brutally attacking Carver alone in his hotel room, Nomi then makes two hospital visits: the first being to inform a semi-conscious, but recovering, Molly that Carver&#x27;s actions did not go unpunished, and the second, to Cristal, apologizing for pushing her down the stairs and injuring her. As Cristal was not pressing charges against Nomi, and her lawyers had secured her a large cash settlement, she forgives Nomi. Cristal admits that she attempted a similar stunt, years earlier; they exchange a reconciliatory, slightly romantic kiss. Nomi leaves Las Vegas and hitches a ride to Los Angeles, ironically with the same man who previously robbed her on her way to Vegas; she subsequently holds him at knifepoint demanding the return of her suitcase.

== Production ==

=== Writing ===
Joe Eszterhas came up with the idea for &quot;Showgirls&quot; while on vacation at his home in Maui, Hawaii. During lunch in Beverly Hills, Paul Verhoeven told Eszterhas that he had always loved &quot;big MGM musicals&quot;, and wanted to make one; Eszterhas suggested the setting of Las Vegas. Based on the idea he scribbled on a napkin, Eszterhas was advanced $2 million to write the script and picked up an additional $1.7 million when the studio produced it into a film. This, along with the scripts for both Verhoeven&#x27;s previous film &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992) and &quot;Sliver&quot; (1993, also an erotic thriller starring Sharon Stone), made Eszterhas the highest-paid screenwriter in Hollywood history. Because of conflicts with the MPAA over the rating of &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, which he made cuts to in order to secure an R rating, Verhoeven planned for &quot;Showgirls&quot; to be rated NC-17. Verhoeven deferred 70% of his $6 million director&#x27;s fee depending on if the film turned a profit.

At the time the script deal was announced, Eszterhas was quoted as saying the story for the film &quot;begins in the world of erotic dancers, lap dancers, table dancers, strippers and sleaze. It moves into the world of big hotel showgirls, billboards and glamor. It examines the sleaze and glamor and asks the audience at the end to make its own moral conclusions.&quot;

Eszterhas completed the script in the later half of 1993. He later said, &quot;I wrote &quot;Showgirls&quot; at the single most turbulent moment of my life,&quot; referring to the dissolution of his first marriage. &quot;The stuff I&#x27;ve done since then has more warmth, more humor, is more upbeat.&quot;

Eszterhas and Verhoeven interviewed over 200 Las Vegas strippers and incorporated parts of their stories into the screenplay to show the amount of exploitation of strippers in Vegas.

Prince was reported to be writing songs for the film.

=== Casting ===
Before Elizabeth Berkley was cast as Nomi Malone, a long list of actresses were considered for the role, including Pamela Anderson, Drew Barrymore, Angelina Jolie, Vanessa Marcil, Jenny McCarthy, Denise Richards, Jennifer Lopez, and Charlize Theron. On the role of Nomi, Verhoeven said, &quot;One of the main concerns, next to acting, was the dancing and nudity – both of those elements being extreme. The actress would have to be able to dance. And she also had to be willing to show full-frontal throughout the film. These elements, especially the nudity, are extremely difficult for American actresses to accept. And Elizabeth Berkley was the only actress that combined all three.&quot;

Madonna and Sharon Stone were considered for the part of Cristal Connors before Gina Gershon was cast.

Kyle MacLachlan said Dylan McDermott was the first choice for the character of Zack Carey, but he declined and MacLachlan was then cast. MacLachlan recalled: &quot;That was a decision that was sort of a tough one to make, but I was enchanted with Paul Verhoeven. Particularly &quot;RoboCop&quot;, which I loved ... It was Verhoeven and Eszterhas, and it seemed like it was going to be kind of dark and edgy and disturbing and real.&quot;

=== Filming ===
Verhoeven asked Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics to not only compose the film&#x27;s score, but to also write the music for the big Stardust hotel shows. &quot;The idea was to make the same loud, sleazy, bad music that you hear in those Vegas shows, because that&#x27;s how it actually is,&quot; said Verhoeven.

Gina Ravera said the filming of the rape scene was traumatic. &quot;When you do a scene like that, your body doesn&#x27;t know it&#x27;s not real,&quot; Ravera said of the sequence, which took over nine hours to film.

==Music==
The soundtrack of the film featured songs specially composed for the film, including an early version of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot;, and a song of Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; &quot;New Skin&quot; recorded near Prague in June 1995. It also includes songs by Killing Joke and Scylla (a then-new band featuring Curve&#x27;s singer Toni Halliday). The Young Gods&#x27; song &quot;Kissing the Sun&quot; only appeared on the US edition of the soundtrack and did not feature on the European and Japanese releases. The soundtrack album was released on September 26, 1995.

== Marketing ==
The NC-17 rating limited the film&#x27;s marketing opportunities in traditional outlets: of the major American broadcast television networks, ABC, CBS, and Fox did not air ads for the film before 10:00 p.m., and many NBC stations did not advertise it at all. As a consequence, MGM/UA largely relied on the controversy over the rating itself to generate audience hype, and mounted a promotional blitz that capitalized on the film&#x27;s potentially lurid subject matter. Ads bore the tagline &quot;leave your inhibitions at the door.&quot; The promotion included billboards in Times Square and Venice Beach, an interactive adults-only website, and circulation of a &quot;sneak preview&quot; videotape at rental stores, which featured eight minutes of explicit footage not shown in theatrical trailers. The studio said they distributed 300,000 preview tapes, though it was not carried in Blockbuster stores, as the preview was also rated NC-17.

Emphasizing the film&#x27;s sexual content, MGM/UA targeted young men as a key audience, placing ads for the film in the sports sections of newspapers. Eszterhas objected to this tactic, and took out a full-page advertisement in &quot;Variety&quot; where he insisted the film was a morality tale. The ad said, &quot;The movie shows that dancers in Vegas are often victimized, humiliated, used, verbally and physically raped by the men who are at the power centers of that world.&quot; Eszterhas, who believed the film&#x27;s message to be about the moral costs of the pursuit of stardom, urged teens under the age of 17 to sneak into the theater by using fake IDs, prompting censure from MPAA president Jack Valenti.

The film&#x27;s stark poster was adapted from a photograph by Tono Stano. The photo had originally been featured on the cover of the 1994 book &quot;The Body: Photographs of the Human Form&quot;.

The film was released to 1,388 theaters in North America on September 22, 1995. Two theater chains in the South, Texas&#x27; Cinemark and Georgia&#x27;s Carmike, declined to screen the film. On its opening weekend, the film made $8,112,627 and opened in the number 2 spot behind &quot;Seven&quot;. In the second week, it slipped to the fifth spot and grosses fell 60%. Its total domestic take was $20,350,754, less than half of its $45 million budget.

While the film&#x27;s theatrical run was underwhelming and did not recoup its budget, it went on to gross over $100 million in the home-video and rentals markets, and as of 2014, the film is still one of MGM&#x27;s highest-selling movies.

To date, &quot;Showgirls&quot; is the second highest-grossing NC-17 production (after &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;), earning $20,350,754 at the North American box office.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Showgirls&quot; performed much better on VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray, becoming one of MGM&#x27;s top 20 best-sellers, grossing over $100 million in the US home media market alone. Though initially reluctant to edit the film for video release, Verhoeven had agreed to recut &quot;Showgirls&quot; as an R-rated version, which allowed MGM to recoup its budget through video sales and rentals. On January 2, 1996, &quot;Showgirls&quot; was released on VHS in two versions: A director&#x27;s R-rated version for rental outlets (including Blockbuster and Hollywood Video), and an NC-17-rated version. The NC-17 version was also released on LaserDisc that year.

&quot;Showgirls&quot; was released on DVD for the first time on April 25, 2000. In 2004, MGM released the &quot;V.I.P. Edition&quot; on DVD in a special boxed set containing two shot glasses, movie cards with drinking games on the back, a deck of playing cards, and a nude poster of Berkley with a pair of suction-cup pasties so viewers can play &quot;pin the pasties on the showgirl&quot;. In 2007, MGM re-released the V.I.P. Edition DVD without the physical extras, as the &quot;Fully Exposed Edition&quot;.

On June 15, 2010, MGM released a 15th Anniversary &quot;Sinsational Edition&quot; in a two-disc dual-format Blu-ray/DVD edition.

In 2016, &quot;Showgirls&quot; was restored in 4K from the original negative. The image restoration was carried out by the Technicolor laboratory and the sound restoration by the L.E. Diapason laboratory, under the supervision of Paul Verhoeven and Pathé. The restored version was released on Blu-ray following a theatrical run.

The film was released in Germany on Ultra HD Blu-ray by Capelight Pictures in 2020, based on Pathé&#x27;s restoration, which was noted for having high noise reduction. It was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray in the United States by Vinegar Syndrome in 2023, which received a stronger review for picture quality by &quot;High-Def Digest&quot;. Vinegar Syndrome launched a disc replacement program shortly after discovering sync issues in the film&#x27;s 5.1 audio track.

== Reception ==
The film was universally panned on its initial release. Critics bemoaned the film&#x27;s lack of eroticism and described the film&#x27;s heavy degree of nudity as exploitative and demeaning to women. In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Kenneth Turan wrote the film &quot;has somehow managed to make extensive nudity exquisitely boring&quot; and &quot;descends into incoherent tedium.&quot; He added, &quot;Though the filmmakers&#x27; incessant talk about vision, artistry and honest self-expression lead one to expect a sexually explicit biopic about the Dalai Lama, what is in fact provided is depressing and disappointing as well as dehumanizing.&quot;

Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; wrote, &quot;Eszterhas must be great at pitching stories, because the screenwriting craft eludes him. A mild gag here--the mispronouncing of Gianni Versace&#x27;s name--is tortured into an endless motif. Nomi has a clouded past, but that doesn&#x27;t explain why she is such a gratingly annoying creature.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;The exploitative heart of &quot;Showgirls&quot; is that Eszterhas and Verhoeven effectively dissolve the line between the way men in the strip world treat women and the way the movie treats them. Most of the male characters are misogynistic louts, and even the few sympathetic ones are borderline ridiculous.&quot;

The character of Nomi was widely panned as unsympathetic and &quot;irritating&quot;. Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Like the bimbo she plays, Berkley&#x27;s minimal acting talent limits her choice of roles. That makes the filmmakers little better than the club owners who prostitute their employees. They&#x27;re selling women&#x27;s bodies, and &#x27;Showgirls&#x27; is an overcoat movie for men who don&#x27;t want to be seen going into a porno theater.&quot;

In a review that awarded the film 2 stars out of 4, Roger Ebert lambasted the film&#x27;s over-the-top nudity and &quot;juvenile&quot; script, maintaining that the movie &quot;contains no true eroticism&quot;. However, he wrote &quot;the production values are first-rate, and the lead performance by newcomer Elizabeth Berkley has a fierce energy that&#x27;s always interesting.&quot; He also found some of the plot lines concerning the backstabbing between the dancers entertaining, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s trash, yes, but not boring&quot;. In a 1998 review, he stated the film received &quot;some bad reviews, but it wasn&#x27;t completely terrible&quot;.

In her review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote, &quot;the strain of trying to make America&#x27;s dirtiest big-studio movie has led Mr. Verhoeven and Mr. Ezsterhas to create an instant camp classic&quot;. Writing for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Edward Guthmann noted, &quot;From all the bad press that &#x27;Showgirls&#x27; has gotten, you&#x27;d think the nation&#x27;s critics had never witnessed high-gloss trash before. Granted, Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s tale of a Las Vegas lap dancer is one of Hollywood&#x27;s all-time stinkers, but it does come from a long and healthy tradition – the trashy, backstage show-biz epic&quot;, referring to films like &quot;The Oscar&quot; and &quot;Valley of the Dolls.&quot;

Stanley Kauffmann was one of the few critics to give a positive review in &quot;The New Republic&quot;. He commented, &quot;What matters much more than the story or the Spicy Stuff is the dancing, the show-biz dancing. It&#x27;s electric. Exciting.&quot; Kauffman praised Berkley&#x27;s performance and commented, &quot;Besides her dancing sizzle, she does what she can with the mechanically viperous character she was given to play. Sarah Bernhardt couldn&#x27;t have done much more with this robotic part, and couldn&#x27;t have done the dancing.&quot; He also complimented Ravera and Gershon. He concluded the film shows &quot;that: (a) under the glitz, Las Vegas is a tacky, tricky place; and (b) Las Vegas is a microcosm of American values at their shabbiest. If you don&#x27;t think you can survive the shock of these insights, be warned.&quot; In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Anthony Lane said, &quot;Berkley&#x27;s acting début is a joy, if you can call it acting: she jumps up and down a lot to indicate excitement. Watching this picture is like surfing the soaps for a couple of hours. There&#x27;s no use being offended, so you might as well have a good laugh.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 23% based on 79 reviews, with an average rating of 3.7/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Vile, contemptible, garish, and misogynistic – and that might just be exactly &quot;Showgirls&quot;″ point.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 20 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

MacLachlan recalled seeing the film for the first time at the premiere:
I was absolutely gobsmacked. I said, &quot;This is horrible. Horrible!&quot; And it&#x27;s a very slow, sinking feeling when you&#x27;re watching the movie, and the first scene comes out, and you&#x27;re like, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s a really bad scene.&quot; But you say, &quot;Well, that&#x27;s okay, the next one&#x27;ll be better.&quot; And you somehow try to convince yourself that it&#x27;s going to get better… and it just gets worse. And I was like, &quot;Wow. That was crazy.&quot; I mean, I really didn&#x27;t see that coming. So at that point, I distanced myself from the movie. Now, of course, it has a whole other life as a sort of inadvertent… satire. No, &quot;satire&quot; isn&#x27;t the right word. But it&#x27;s inadvertently funny. So it&#x27;s found its place. It provides entertainment, though not in the way I think it was originally intended. It was just… maybe the wrong material with the wrong director and the wrong cast.

Due to &quot;Showgirls&quot;″ poor reception, &quot;Striptease&quot;, a 1996 film about nude dancers starring Demi Moore, was distanced from &quot;Showgirls&quot; in advertisements. Elizabeth Berkley was dropped by her agent Mike Menchel following the film&#x27;s release. Other agents refused to take her telephone calls. In 2013, she also said the film&#x27;s critical reception made her stop dancing.

In 1997, Eszterhas said:
Clearly we made mistakes. Clearly it was one of the biggest failures of our time. It failed commercially, critically, it failed on videotape, it failed internationally. ... In retrospect, part of it was that Paul and I were coming off of &quot;Basic&quot;, which defied the critics and was a huge success. Maybe there was a certain hubris involved: &quot;We can do what we want to do, go as far out there as we want.&quot; That rape scene was a god-awful mistake. In retrospect, a terrible mistake. And musically it was eminently forgettable. And in casting mistakes were made.

== Awards ==
The film was the winner of a then-record seven 1995 Golden Raspberry Awards (from a record 13 nominations, a record that still stands) including Worst Picture, Worst Actress (Elizabeth Berkley), Worst Director (Paul Verhoeven), Worst Screenplay (Joe Eszterhas), Worst New Star (Elizabeth Berkley), Worst Screen Couple (&quot;any combination of two people (or two body parts)&quot;) and Worst Original Song (&quot;Walk Into the Wind&quot; originally written by David A. Stewart and Terry Hall in 1992, covered in the film by main antagonist Andrew Carver). Verhoeven appeared in person at the Razzies ceremony to accept his award for Worst Director.

&quot;Showgirls&quot; would later win an eighth Razzie Award for Worst Picture of the Last Decade in 2000. It was soon tied with &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; for winning the most Razzies in a single year, a record broken in 2008 when &quot;I Know Who Killed Me&quot; won eight trophies and again in 2012 when &quot;Jack and Jill&quot; won 10 awards.

At the 1995 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film received three nominations: Worst Picture, Worst Actor for MacLachlan, and Worst Actress for Berkley. Of the three, its only win was for Worst Picture.

== Cult status ==
&quot;Showgirls&quot; has achieved cult status. According to writer Naomi Klein, ironic enjoyment of the film initially arose among those with the video before MGM capitalized on the idea. MGM noticed the video was performing well because &quot;trendy twenty-somethings were throwing &quot;Showgirls&quot; irony parties, laughing sardonically at the implausibly poor screenplay and shrieking with horror at the aerobic sexual encounters&quot;. The film was heavily embraced by the LGBT community, who would host midnight movie-type screenings that became an ongoing tradition. Movie screenings and viewing parties were hosted by performers such as Betty Buckley, Peaches Christ, and David Schmader. The screenings were akin to midnight shows of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, with audiences being given instructions to interact or sing along with scenes. To coincide with the film&#x27;s video release and its popularity in the gay community, MGM recruited drag performers to host midnight screenings in New York City in 1996, and later held screenings in Los Angeles. Home video rentals would go on to generate more than $100 million, making &quot;Showgirls&quot; one of MGM&#x27;s top 20 all-time bestsellers.

Verhoeven accepted the film&#x27;s unexpected cult status, saying &quot;Maybe this kind of ritualistic cult popularity isn&#x27;t what I intended, but it&#x27;s like a resurrection after the crucifixion.&quot; Eszterhas, however, maintains that the humor was intentional: &quot;What Paul [Verhoeven] and I had in mind was something darkly funny. We went through the script line by line, and we were really laughing at some of it. I defy people to tell me that a line like, &#x27;How does it feel not to have anybody coming on you anymore&#x27; isn&#x27;t meant to be funny.&quot;

The term &quot;&quot;Showgirls&quot;-bad&quot; has been adopted by film critics and fans to refer to films considered guilty pleasures, or &quot;so-bad-they&#x27;re-good&quot;, and the film has been heralded as a camp classic in the vein of films like &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls.&quot;

In Ireland, the film was banned on November 8, 1995. The Irish Film Censor Board chair Sheamus Smith provided no explanation for the ban, but it had been speculated that the ban was owed to the film&#x27;s rape scene. In fact, Smith banned the film upon initial release because of the line, &quot;I got bigger tits than the fuckin&#x27; Virgin Mary and I got a bigger mouth, too.&quot; Smith&#x27;s objection was specifically to the diction &quot;fuckin&#x27; Virgin Mary&quot;. The film was passed uncut for its video release on October 23, 2017.

The rights to show the film on television were eventually purchased by the VH1 network. Because of the film&#x27;s frequent nudity, though, a censored version was created with black bras and panties digitally rendered to hide all exposed breasts and genitalia. Also, several scenes were removed entirely, shortening the movie by at least 45 minutes. Berkley refused to redub her lines because MGM refused to pay her fee of $250, so a noticeably different actress&#x27;s voice can be heard on the soundtrack.

In 2003, the film was ranked number 36 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s &#x27;The Top 50 Cult Movies&#x27; list.

The film was mentioned a few times on hit network TV shows in the late 1990s, with a mix of affection and sarcasm. On NBC&#x27;s &quot;NewsRadio&quot;, a running joke where billionaire WNYX owner Jimmy James has a running list of potential wives made a reference to &quot;Showgirls&quot; when James is asked by station manager Dave Nelson about the wives&#x27; list. James then says it is one number shorter than previously noted because &quot;You know that nice girl who was on &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;? She went and made a dirty movie!&quot; In a Season 11 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Homer and Marge go out on a date night to see the film after Bart becomes well-behaved from taking Focusyn. The scene playing was a fictional scene where a redheaded man tells Nomi that she&#x27;s wasting her talent as a showgirl, with Nomi snapping, &quot;Screw you! Screw everybody!&quot; and takes her top off when the stage manager calls for showtime. Marge also comments that she enjoys the friendship between &quot;showgirl [Nomi] and that seamstress [Molly]&quot;.

Australian rapper Iggy Azalea paid homage to the film in the music video for her 2013 song &quot;Change Your Life&quot; featuring T.I. Many visuals and costumes were recreated or inspired by the film, including the Cheetah&#x27;s club setting.

In 2019, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Nomi&quot;, a documentary re-examining the film&#x27;s legacy, was released.

On March 20, 2024, the Academy Museum held a screening of &quot;Showgirls&quot; in Los Angeles, with an introduction by Berkley who received three standing ovations by the sold out audience.

=== Critical re-evaluation ===
Critics such as Jonathan Rosenbaum and J. Hoberman, as well as filmmakers Jim Jarmusch, Adam McKay and Jacques Rivette, have gone on the record defending &quot;Showgirls&quot; as a serious satire. In a 1998 interview, Rivette called it &quot;one of the great American films of the last few years&quot;, though &quot;very unpleasant: it&#x27;s about surviving in a world populated by assholes, and that&#x27;s Verhoeven&#x27;s philosophy&quot;. Quentin Tarantino has stated that he enjoyed &quot;Showgirls&quot;, referring to it in 1996 as the &quot;only ... other time in the last twenty years [that] a major studio made a full-on, gigantic, big-budget exploitation movie&quot;, comparing it to &quot;Mandingo&quot;.

&quot;Showgirls&quot; has been compared to the 1950 film &quot;All About Eve&quot; as a remake, update, or rip-off of that film. For Rosenbaum, &quot;&quot;Showgirls&quot; has to be one of the most vitriolic allegories about Hollywood and selling out ever made&quot;. &quot;Verhoeven may be the bravest and most assured satirist in Hollywood, insofar as he succeeds in making big genre movies no one knows whether to take seriously or not&quot;, wrote Michael Atkinson.

In &quot;Slant&quot;″s four-out-of-four-star review, Eric Henderson rejected the &quot;so-bad-it&#x27;s-good&quot; interpretation and lauds the film as &quot;one of the most honest satires of recent years&quot;, stating that the film targets Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;morally bankrupt star-is-born tales.&quot; Henderson drew from a 2003 round-table discussion in &quot;Film Quarterly&quot; in which others argued its merits. Noël Burch attests that the film &quot;takes mass culture seriously, as a site of both fascination and struggle&quot; and uses melodrama as &quot;an excellent vehicle for social criticism.&quot; In the same round-table, Chon Noriega suggests that the film has been misinterpreted and the satire overlooked because &quot;the film lacks the usual coordinates and signposts for a critique of human vice and folly provided by sarcasm, irony, and caustic wit.&quot;

Berkley&#x27;s performance, which was heavily criticized as out of sync with the rest of the film&#x27;s tone, was also reappraised. In 2015, Verhoeven said Berkley had unfairly taken on the bulk of criticism against the film and claimed responsibility for her performance. &quot;Good or not good, I was the one who asked her to exaggerate everything – every move – because that was the element of style that I thought would work for the movie,&quot; he said. In 2020, Hugh Montgomery of the BBC described Berkley&#x27;s portrayal as &quot;the definition of a star turn: absolutely singular, and charged with a haywire electricity&quot;, adding, &quot;It benefits from the meta-authenticity that comes from a young entertainer pulling out all the stops for her shot at the big time, playing a young entertainer pulling out all the stops for her shot at the big time. But above and beyond that, it is an exhilaratingly surreal and abrasive performance, in which gestures and expressions are exaggerated to an inhuman level&quot;. Critic Catherine Bray said, &quot;You can&#x27;t criticise the performance for not being realistic. That&#x27;s like looking at an Andy Warhol and going &#x27;well those colours aren&#x27;t true to life. It&#x27;s a pop-art caricature&#x27;&quot;.

The violence of the gang rape scene has generated criticism and debate, with some describing it as being in poor taste and unnecessarily brutal because it happens to the film&#x27;s prominent woman of color and serves mainly as a catalyst for Nomi&#x27;s moral arc. Jeffrey McHale, the director of &quot;You Don&#x27;t Nomi&quot;, opined, &quot;It&#x27;s completely offensive. I think it&#x27;s not really necessary… [Verhoeven] used Molly&#x27;s brutalisation as a way for Nomi to find herself and I think that&#x27;s disgusting.&quot;

The film continues to generate critical discussion about its themes and commentary on patriarchal culture, the American dream, and the nature of sex work, with some contending that the film&#x27;s many exaggerated aspectsits gaudy dance numbers, excessive nudity, laughable dialogue, and over-the-top actingare all deliberately part of the film&#x27;s intent. In 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented: &quot;With &quot;Showgirls&quot;, the target was the American dream itself – and the dishonest &#x27;star is born&#x27; narratives churned out to sustain it.&quot;

== Legacy ==
=== Sequel ===
Verhoeven said a sequel had been in development before &quot;Showgirls&quot; was released, with the film&#x27;s final scene of a sign for Los Angeles hinting at a plot where Nomi takes on Hollywood. However, these plans were dropped when the film did poorly at the box office.

A sequel focusing on minor character Penny was released in 2011. Titled &quot;Showgirls 2: Penny&#x27;s from Heaven&quot;, it was written, produced, edited, directed by and starred Rena Riffel, who was the only character returning, apart from cameos by Glenn Plummer and Greg Travis.

=== Musical adaptation ===
In 2013, an off-off-Broadway parody called &quot;Showgirls! The Musical&quot; was mounted by Bob and Tobly McSmith of Medium Face Productions. Originating at the Kraine Theater in New York City, critical and audience response was overwhelmingly positive. It was moved to a 200-seat off-Broadway theater, XL Nightclub. The production continued to be successful; its original run was extended through July 15, 2013. Actress Rena Riffel reprised her role in the film as Penny for one month of the production.

The musical closely mimics the film&#x27;s plot and often directly incorporates dialog. The original off-Broadway production was critically lauded for April Kidwell&#x27;s performance as Nomi and for staying true to the source&#x27;s campy nature. Andy Webster of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated: &quot;The coltish April Kidwell, as Nomi, is a wonder. Amid an exhausting onslaught of often obvious ribaldry, she is tireless, fearless, and performing circles around Elizabeth Berkley&#x27;s portrayal in the movie. Her vibrant physicality and knowing humor are a potent riposte to the story&#x27;s rabid misogyny.&quot;

It takes several characters and condenses them for the stage. The characters of Marty and Gaye have been combined to one character, simply called &#x27;Gay&#x27;. The characters of Molly and James are both portrayed by actor Marcus Deison. Zack Carey is simply called Kyle MacLachlan. With sexually explicit language and nudity throughout, the tagline is &quot;Singing. Dancing. Tits&quot;.

The original cast featured Kidwell as Nomi, Rori Nogee as Cristal, John E. Elliott as Kyle McLachlan, Marcus Deison as Molly and James, Philip McLeod as Gay and Amanda Nicholas, Natalie Wagner and Israel Vinas as the ensemble.

;Original cast recording
On June 11, 2013, a cast recording was released with eight tracks.

<text>Delia Salter Bacon (February 2, 1811 – September 2, 1859) was an American writer of plays and short stories and Shakespeare scholar. She is best known for her work on the authorship of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, which she attributed to social reformers including Francis Bacon (to whom she was unrelated), Sir Walter Raleigh and others.

Bacon&#x27;s research in Boston, New York, and London led to the publication of her major work on the subject, &quot;The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakspere Unfolded.&quot; Her admirers included authors Harriet Beecher Stowe, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Ralph Waldo Emerson, the last of whom called her &quot;America&#x27;s greatest literary producer of the past ten years&quot; at the time of her death.

==Biography==
Bacon was born in a frontier log cabin in Tallmadge, Ohio, the youngest daughter of Congregational minister David Bacon, who in pursuit of a vision, had abandoned New Haven for the wilds of Ohio. The venture quickly collapsed, and the family returned to New England, where her father died soon after. The impoverished state of their finances permitted only her elder brother Leonard to receive a tertiary education, at Yale, while her own formal education ended when she was fourteen. She became a teacher in schools in Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York, and then, until about 1852, became a distinguished professional lecturer, conducting, in various cities in the eastern United States, classes for women in history and literature by methods she devised. At age 20, in 1831, she published her first book, &quot;Tales of the Puritans&quot; anonymously, consisting of three long stories on colonial life. In 1832, she beat Edgar Allan Poe to win a short-story contest sponsored by the Philadelphia &quot;Saturday Courier&quot;.

In 1836, Bacon moved to New York, and became an avid theatre-goer. She met the leading Shakespearean actress Ellen Tree soon after, and persuaded her to take the lead role in a play she was writing, partly in blank verse, entitled &quot;The Bride of Fort Edward&quot;, based on her award-winning story, &quot;Love&#x27;s Martyr,&quot; about Jane M&#x27;Crea. The play, however, was never performed, due in part to Bacon&#x27;s health and the harsh criticisms of her brother. It was published anonymously in 1839 (with a note claiming it was &quot;not a play&quot;). The text was reviewed favorably by the &quot;Saturday Courier&quot; and Edgar Allan Poe, but proved to be a commercial flop.

Returning to New Haven, Bacon met Yale-educated minister Alexander MacWhorter in 1846. Time in each other&#x27;s company and a trip to Northampton convinced many of the impropriety of their relationship. MacWhorter was brought to ecclesiastical trial by Bacon&#x27;s brother Leonard for &quot;dishonorable conduct,&quot; but was acquitted in a 12–11 vote. Public opinion compelled Bacon to leave New Haven for Ohio, while Catharine Beecher wrote a book defending her conduct.

Bacon died in 1859, having in 1858 been placed by her family in the care of a lunatic asylum at Hartford, Connecticut. According to her nephew, Theodore Bacon, she had been seized by a &quot;violent mania&quot; while in England, and had been &quot;removed to an excellent private asylum for a small number of insane persons&quot; at Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, before being brought back to America.

==Shakespeare authorship theory==
Delia Bacon withdrew from public life and lecturing in early 1845, and began to research intensively a theory she was developing over the authorship of Shakespeare&#x27;s works, which she mapped out by October of that year. However a decade was to pass before her book &quot;The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakespeare Unfolded&quot; (1857) was to see print. During these years she was befriended by Nathaniel Hawthorne and Ralph Waldo Emerson, and, after securing sponsorship to travel for research to England, in May 1853, met Thomas Carlyle, who though intrigued, shrieked loudly as he heard her exposition.

This was the heyday of higher criticism, which was claiming to have uncovered the multiple authorship of the Bible and positing the composite nature of masterpieces like those attributed to Homer. It was also a period of rising bardolatry, the deification of Shakespeare&#x27;s genius, and a widespread, almost hyperbolic veneration for the philosophical genius of Francis Bacon. Delia Bacon was influenced by these currents. Like many of her time, she approached Shakespearean drama as philosophical masterpieces written for a closed aristocratic society of courtiers and monarchs, and found it difficult to believe they were written either with commercial intent or for a popular audience. Puzzled by the gap between the bare facts of William Shakespeare&#x27;s life and his vast literary output, she intended to prove that the plays attributed to Shakespeare were written by a coterie of men, including Francis Bacon, Sir Walter Raleigh and Edmund Spenser, for the purpose of inculcating a philosophic system, for which they felt that they themselves could not afford to assume the responsibility. This system she set out to discover beneath the superficial text of the plays. From her friendship with Samuel Morse, an authority on codes, and encryption for the telegraph, she learned of Bacon&#x27;s interest in secret ciphers, and this prompted her own approach to the authorship question.

Her theory proposed that the missing fourth part of Francis Bacon&#x27;s unfinished magnum opus, the &quot;Instauratio Magna&quot; had in fact survived in the form of the plays attributed to Shakespeare. Delia Bacon argued that the great plays were the collective effort of a:
little clique of disappointed and defeated politicians who undertook to head and organize popular opposition against the government, and were compelled to retreat from that enterprise.. .Driven from one field, they showed themselves in another. Driven from the open field, they fought in secret.
The cenacle opposing the &#x27;despotism&#x27; of Queen Elizabeth I and King James, like the knights of King Arthur&#x27;s Round Table consisted of Francis Bacon, Walter Ralegh, and perhaps Edmund Spenser, Lord Buckhurst and the Earl of Oxford, all putatively employing playwriting to speak to both rulers and the ruled as committed republicans vindicating that cause against tyranny. She had, in James S. Shapiro&#x27;s reading, a &quot;revolutionary agenda&quot; that consisted in upturning the myths of America&#x27;s founding fathers and the Puritan heritage.

Bacon&#x27;s skeptical attitude towards the orthodox view of Shakespearean authorship invoked contempt of many, such as Richard Grant White. However, Emerson assisted her in publishing her first essay on the Shakespearean question in the January 1856 issue of &quot;Putnam&#x27;s Magazine&quot;:

 How can we undertake to account for the literary miracles of antiquity, while this great myth of the modern ages still lies at our own door, unquestioned? This vast, magical, unexplained phenomenon which our own times have proceed under our own eyes, appears to be, indeed, the only thing which our modern rationalism is not to be permitted to meddle with. For, here the critics themselves still veil their faces, filling the air with mystic utterances which seem to say, that to this shrine at least, for the footstep of the common reason and the common sense, there is yet no admittance. 
Emerson, who greatly admired Bacon, and who was skeptical of her claim, wrote that she would need &quot;enchanted instruments, nay alchemy itself, to melt into one identity these two reputations&quot;, and retrospectively remarked that America had only two &quot;producers&quot; during the 1850s, &quot;Our wild Whitman, with real inspiration but checked by [a] titanic abdomen; and Delia Bacon, with genius, but mad and clinging like a tortoise to English soil.&quot; Though he was intrigued by her insights into the plays, he grew skeptical of the &#x27;magical cipher&#x27; of which Bacon wrote without ever producing evidence for it.

According to Walt Whitman, himself among the most outspoken of 19th century anti-Stratfordians, she was &quot;the sweetest, eloquentist, grandest woman…that America has so far produced….and, of course, very unworldly, just in all ways such a woman as was calculated to bring the whole literary pack down on her, the orthodox, cruel, stately, dainty, over-fed literary pack – worshipping tradition, unconscious of this day’s honest sunlight.&quot;

James Shapiro interprets her theory both in terms of the cultural tensions of her historical milieu, and as consequential on an intellectual and emotional crisis that unfolded as she both broke with her Puritan upbringing and developed a deep confidential relationship with a fellow lodger, Alexander MacWhorter, a young theology graduate from Yale, which was subsequently interrupted by her brother. MacWhorter was absolved of culpability in a subsequent ecclesiastical trial, whose verdict led to a rift between Delia and her fellow congregationalists.

==Legacy==

One recent assessment echoes the favorable view of Bacon held by Emerson, Hawthorne, and Whitman: 

For too long critics have depicted [her] as a tragicomic figure, blindly pursuing a fantastic mission in obscurity and isolation, only to end in silence and madness….this is not to say that the stereotype is without basis. On the contrary, her sad story established an archetype for the story of the Shakespeare authorship at large – or at least one element of it: an otherworldly pursuit of truth that produces gifts for a world that is indifferent or hostile to them. 

James S. Shapiro argues that her political reading of the plays, and her insistence on collaborative authorship, anticipated modern approaches by a century and a half.
Had she limited her argument to these points instead of conjoining it to an argument about how Shakespeare couldn&#x27;t have written them, there is little doubt that, instead of being dismissed as a crank and a madwoman, she would be hailed today as the precursor of the New Historicists, and the first to argue that the plays anticipated the political upheavals England experienced in the mid-seventeenth century. But Delia Bacon couldn&#x27;t stop at that point. Nor could she concede that the republican ideas she located in the plays circulated widely at the time and were as available to William Shakespeare as they were to Walter Raleigh or Francis Bacon.

Her nephew, Theodore Bacon, wrote a biography of her entitled &quot;Delia Bacon: A Sketch&quot; (Boston, 1888), and Nathaniel Hawthorne included an appreciative chapter, &quot;Recollections of a Gifted Woman&quot;, in his book &quot;Our Old Home&quot; (Boston, 1863). 

She died in Hartford, Connecticut. She is interred in Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven, Connecticut.

Bacon and her theories are featured heavily in Jennifer Lee Carrell&#x27;s novel &quot;Interred with Their Bones&quot;.

<text>Quetta (; , &quot;ko&#x27;eṭa&quot;, , ) is the capital and largest city of the Pakistani province of Balochistan. It is the ninth largest city in Pakistan, with an estimated population of over 1.6 million in 2024. It is situated in the south-west of the country, lying in a valley surrounded by mountains on all sides. Quetta is at an average elevation of above sea level, making it Pakistan&#x27;s highest altitude major city. The city is known as the &quot;Fruit Garden of Pakistan&quot; due to the numerous fruit orchards in and around it and the large variety of fresh and dried fruits produced there.

Located in northern Balochistan near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and the road across to Kandahar, Quetta is a trade and communication centre between the two countries. The city is near the Bolan Pass, which was on a major gateway from Central Asia to South Asia.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Quetta&quot; is a variation of the Pashto word &quot;Kwatkōṭ&quot;, or &quot;kōta&quot; meaning &quot;fortress&quot;. Quetta was formerly known as Shalkot ()

=== Foundation ===

In 1876, Quetta was occupied by the British and subsequently incorporated into British India. In 1856, British General John Jacob had urged his government to occupy Quetta given its strategic position on the western frontier.

<text>Virgin Atlantic, a trading name of Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited and Virgin Atlantic International Limited, is a British airline with its head office in Crawley, West Sussex, England. The airline was established in 1984 as British Atlantic Airways, and was originally planned by its co-founders Randolph Fields and Alan Hellary to fly between London and the Falkland Islands. Soon after changing the name to Virgin Atlantic Airways, Fields sold his shares in the company to Richard Branson in return for unlimited free travel. The maiden flight from London–Gatwick to Newark took place on 22 June 1984.

The airline along with Virgin Holidays is controlled by a holding company, Virgin Atlantic Limited, which is 51% owned by the Virgin Group and 49% by Delta Air Lines. It is administratively separate from other Virgin-branded airlines. Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited and Virgin Atlantic International Limited both hold Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Type A Operating Licences (AOC numbers 534 and 2435 respectively), both of which permit these airlines, operating as Virgin Atlantic Airways, to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.

Virgin Atlantic uses a mixed fleet of Airbus and Boeing wide-body aircraft and operates to destinations in North America, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia from its main hub at London–Heathrow and its secondary hub at Manchester. The airline also operates seasonal services from Edinburgh. Virgin Atlantic aircraft consist of three cabins: Economy, Premium (formerly Premium economy) and Upper Class (business).

In July 2017, Virgin Atlantic announced its intention to form a joint venture with Air France-KLM, but in December 2019, it was announced that the joint venture would not include a stake in the company.

On 5 May 2020, it was announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the airline would lay off 3,000 staff, reduce the fleet size to 35 by the summer of 2022, retire the Boeing 747-400s and would not resume operations from Gatwick following the pandemic.

Virgin Atlantic filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in New York on 4 August 2020 as part of a £1.2 billion private refinancing package. The airline joined the SkyTeam airline alliance in March 2023.

==History==
===Origins===

Virgin Atlantic has its origins in a joint endeavour by Randolph Fields, an American-born lawyer, and Alan Hellary, a former chief pilot for British private airline Laker Airways. Following the collapse of Laker Airways in 1982, Fields and Hellary decided to establish a new company, initially named &quot;British Atlantic Airways&quot;, as a successor. Reportedly, Fields had formed a concept for an airline that would operate between London and the Falkland Islands during June 1982, when the Falklands War had just finished. Fields sought out expertise in the field and contacted Hellary, who had already been considering options for establishing a regular commercial service to the Falklands. In turn, Hellary was in contact with several out-of-work colleagues from the collapse of Laker Airways; as such, the pair decided to refine their ambitions.

However, it was soon determined that the short runway at Port Stanley Airport, and the time it would take to improve it, would render a route to the Falklands commercially unviable; thus, the idea of such a service was dropped. In its place, Hellary and Fields commenced efforts to secure a licence to operate a route between Gatwick Airport, London and John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City. During May 1983, a three-day inquiry was conducted, which chose to reject the application following objections from British Airways, British Caledonian and BAA.

Hellary and Fields then applied for a licence between Gatwick and Newark, New Jersey, using a 380-seat McDonnell Douglas DC-10. However, faced with the prospect of direct competition from rival operator PEOPLExpress, a post-deregulation &quot;no frills&quot; discount airline based at Newark Liberty, they decided to secure more funding before proceeding. Fields met British entrepreneur Richard Branson at a party in London during which he proposed a business partnership. After protracted and testy negotiations, Fields agreed to a reduced stake of 25% in the airline (which was renamed &quot;Virgin Atlantic&quot;) and became its first chairman. Following disagreements over operations, Fields agreed to be bought out for an initial sum of £1 million with further payment on Virgin Atlantic&#x27;s first dividend. As a result of a High Court action, this additional payment was received shortly before Fields died in 1997.

===Formative years===

On 22 June 1984, Virgin Atlantic operated its inaugural scheduled service, flown between Gatwick and Newark using a leased Boeing 747-200 (registration ), christened &quot;Maiden Voyager&quot;, which had been formerly operated by Aerolíneas Argentinas. From the onset, its activities were augmented by leveraging existing Virgin Group resources, such as tickets being sold at Virgin Megastores record shops.

Part of Richard Branson&#x27;s declared approach to business is to either succeed within the first year or exit the market; this ethos includes a one-year limit on everything associated with starting up operations. Virgin Atlantic became profitable within the first 12 months, aided by sister company Virgin Records&#x27; ability to finance the lease of a secondhand Boeing 747. The firm had timed its operations to take advantage of a full summer, from June to September, typically the most profitable period of the year.

In November 1984, the airline launched a service between Gatwick Airport and Maastricht Aachen Airport in the Netherlands using a chartered BAC One-Eleven.

In 1986, the airline added another Boeing 747 to its fleet and started a scheduled route from Gatwick to Miami. Additional aircraft were quickly acquired, and new routes were launched from Gatwick, such as to New York JFK in 1988, Tokyo Narita in 1989, Los Angeles in 1990, Boston in 1991, and Orlando in 1992. In 1987, Virgin Atlantic launched a service between Luton and Dublin using secondhand Vickers Viscount turboprop aircraft, but this route was withdrawn around 1990. The airline also operated a Viscount service between Maastricht and London Luton Airport in 1989. During 1988, Club Air operated two Boeing 727 jet aircraft on behalf of Virgin Atlantic; these served the Luton-to-Dublin route until about 1990.

===Competition===

In 1991, Virgin Atlantic was given permission to operate from Heathrow following the abolition of the London Air Traffic Distribution Rules (TDRs), which had governed the distribution of traffic between Heathrow and Gatwick airports since 1978, primarily to bolster the profitability of Gatwick. Airlines without an international scheduled service from Heathrow prior to 1 April 1977 were obliged to operate from Gatwick. However, airlines that did not already operate at Heathrow were still able to begin domestic scheduled services there provided BAA, which then ran both Heathrow and Gatwick on behalf of the UK government, and the Secretary of State for Transport, granted permission.

The Civil Aviation Authority also transferred two pairs of unused landing slots that British Airways held at Tokyo&#x27;s Narita Airport to Virgin Atlantic, allowing it to increase frequency between Heathrow and Tokyo from four to six weekly round trips, making it easier to compete against British Airways. The then-chairman of BA, Lord King, called the CAA&#x27;s decision, which the government had endorsed, &quot;a confiscation of his company&#x27;s property&quot;.

In the year to October 1993, Virgin Atlantic declared a loss of £9.3 million. The decision to abolish the London TDRs and to let Virgin Atlantic operate at Heathrow, in competition with British Airways, became the trigger for BA&#x27;s so-called &quot;dirty tricks&quot; campaign against the company. During 1993, BA&#x27;s public relations director, David Burnside, published an article in &quot;BA News&quot;, British Airways&#x27; internal magazine, which argued that Branson&#x27;s protests against British Airways were a publicity stunt. Branson sued British Airways for libel, using the services of George Carman QC. BA settled out of court when its lawyers discovered the lengths to which the company had gone in trying to kill off Virgin Atlantic. British Airways had to pay a legal bill of up to £3 million, damages to Branson of £500,000, and a further £110,000 to his airline. Branson reportedly donated the proceeds from the case to Virgin Atlantic staff.

During the late 1990s, Virgin Atlantic jets were painted with &quot;No Way BA/AA&quot; as a declaration of its opposition to the attempted merger between British Airways and American Airlines. In 1997, following British Airways&#x27; announcement that it was to remove the Union Flag from its tailfins in favour of world images, Virgin Atlantic introduced a Union Flag design on the winglets of its aircraft and changed the red dress on the &quot;Scarlet Lady&quot; on the nose of aircraft to the union flag with the tag line &quot;Britain&#x27;s Flag Carrier&quot;. This was a tongue-in-cheek challenge to BA&#x27;s traditional role as the UK&#x27;s flag carrier.

In June 2006, US and UK competition authorities investigated alleged price fixing between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways over passenger fuel surcharges. In August 2007, BA was fined £271 million by the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and the US Department of Justice. However, the Chief Executive of Virgin Atlantic, Steve Ridgway, was forced to admit that the company had been a party to the agreement, had been aware of the price-fixing and had taken no steps whatsoever to stop the price-fixing. The company escaped a similar fine to that levied on British Airways only by virtue of the immunity it had earlier negotiated with the regulators.

In April 2010, a tip-off from Cathay Pacific led to an Office of Fair Trading (OFT) investigation of alleged price-fixing between Virgin Atlantic and Cathay Pacific on flights to Hong Kong between 2002 and 2006. Cathay Pacific received immunity from prosecution for reporting the alleged offence. A maximum fine, if found guilty, was 10% of turnover, which, based on the £2.5 billion in sales for the year to February 2009, would have been £250 million. At the time, the OFT stressed that it should not be assumed that the parties involved had broken the law. The OFT cleared both airlines in December 2012, concluding there were &quot;no grounds for action&quot;.

===Recent years===

In May 2014, Virgin Atlantic ended flights to Sydney. In September 2014, Virgin Atlantic announced plans to scrap flights to Tokyo, Mumbai, Vancouver, and Cape Town, and to codeshare transatlantic flights with Delta Air Lines; the company was also reported to be considering axing its new Little Red domestic airline after suffering heavy losses.

On 6 October 2014, Virgin Atlantic confirmed that Little Red services between London and Manchester would end in March 2015, and that the Scottish routes would be terminated in September 2015. Passengers used the routes from point to point as opposed to using it as a connection for longer haul Virgin Atlantic flights. The former BMI routes continued with rival airline British Airways.

In June 2015, Richard Branson stated that Virgin Atlantic had needed the aforementioned deal with Delta to survive, after losses of £233 million between 2010 and 2013. In the same month, the airline announced it would cut 500 jobs to establish a more efficient management structure.

In July 2017, Air France-KLM nearly acquired a 31% stake in Virgin Atlantic for £220 million. This deal however never went through.

In 2019, Virgin Atlantic began to allow its female flight attendants to not wear makeup and have a choice to wear trousers rather than a skirt. In September 2019, it was announced Virgin Atlantic had outlined plans to expand. A key part of these plans would have been acquiring Flybe, with a plan to rebrand it as &quot;Virgin Connect&quot; from early 2020; however, the plans fell through when Flybe filed for administration and ceased operations in March 2020. In December 2019, Branson announced that he would be scrapping the sale of a 31% stake in the airline to Air France-KLM and that Virgin Group would retain its 51% shareholding. In the same year, Virgin Atlantic stopped flying to Dubai, a major aviation and tourism hub owing to COVID and issues related to competition.

In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Richard Branson and Virgin Atlantic attracted criticism by asking employees to take eight weeks&#x27; unpaid leave. However, this was before the UK Government announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, and employees were subsequently furloughed instead. Whilst furloughed, many staff volunteered with the NHS, answering 999 calls, and at NHS Trusts in London and the South East. On 27 March, it was reported that Virgin Atlantic was expected to seek a government bailout, which was on 1 April reportedly backed by Rolls-Royce, Airbus and Heathrow.

In May 2020, Virgin Atlantic announced over 3,000 jobs losses in the UK and an imminent end to operations at Gatwick Airport. On June 7, Virgin Atlantic commenced cargo-only flights between Brussels Airport and London Heathrow, feeding the high demand for European cargo into its network via LHR. As of 2022 the flights still continue on a daily basis, using all aircraft types within the fleet. On 4 August, Virgin Atlantic filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors in the US as part of a recapitalisation and debt restructuring plan. On August 25, 2020, creditors approved the £1.2bn (€1.3bn) rescue package and debt restructuring. On September 4, 2020, Virgin Atlantic announced a second round of job cuts, totalling 1,150 across all departments. Since the start of 2020, the company halved its workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Chief executive Shai Weiss said that &quot;further reducing the number of people we employ is heartbreaking but essential.&quot;

As of February 2022, during Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, Virgin Atlantic, along with the other UK carriers, observed a ban from travelling in Russian airspace that was a retaliatory measure for the UK&#x27;s ban on Russia&#x27;s main carrier, Aeroflot and all other Russian private jets and carriers from using UK airspace. Virgin Atlantic said that avoiding Russia would add between 15 minutes and an hour to flight journeys between the UK and India and Pakistan.

On 27 September 2022, Virgin Atlantic announced that the airline would join SkyTeam airline alliance in early 2023. It was first time that a British airline joined an airline alliance since British Midland International joined Star Alliance in 2002 and British Airways of Oneworld in 1999. In February 2023, the airline stated that it would officially be a part of SkyTeam on March 2, 2023.

In November 2023, the airlines announced plans to resume its flights to Dubai after four years of ceasing operations in the emirate. Also in November 2023, the airline announced plans to operate a flight on November 28 between London Heathrow and New York City using 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel. The flight will be operated on the airlines&#x27; Boeing 787-9. The flight was successful and made it to New York from London on November 28, 2023. Because it was a test flight, there were no fare-paying passengers.

On May 19 it was reported that approximately 200 ex cabin crew were suing Virgin Atlantic for unfair dismissal during the redundancy process following COVID-19 pandemic. It was reported that they protected over 350 new hires who has only completed approximately 1 weeks training out of 6 rather than keep experienced older staff who had been with the airline for over 20 years. This was despite CEO Shai Weis taking the biggest bonus of any airline CEO in Europe.

==Corporate affairs==

===Offices===

Virgin Atlantic&#x27;s head office, known as &quot;The VHQ&quot;, is located on a business park in Crawley, England, near Gatwick Airport and also houses the corporate offices of Virgin Holidays. The company operates several offices and call centres around the United Kingdom, including a large office in Swansea, Wales, which is a base for reservations, sales, baggage claims and tracing, &#x27;live chat&#x27; web support and a customer relations department.

International offices are located at Atlanta, Barbados, Greater Delhi, Johannesburg, Lagos and Shanghai.

===Ownership===
Virgin Group sold a 49% stake in the airline to Singapore Airlines in 1999 for £600 million. On 14 May 2008, Singapore Airlines formally announced an invitation for offers for its Virgin Atlantic stake, and publicly acknowledged that its stake in the airline had &quot;underperformed&quot;.

In November 2010, it was reported that Virgin Atlantic had appointed Deutsche Bank to begin a strategic review of options for the airline following the tie-up between British Airways and American Airlines. By February 2011, it was confirmed that SkyTeam members Air France–KLM and Delta Air Lines had appointed Goldman Sachs to advise them on a joint potential approach for Virgin Atlantic. Etihad Airways was also reported to be considering a deal, and Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, stated that they would be interested in the airline, but only for the lucrative take-off and landing slots it holds at Heathrow Airport.

On 11 December 2012, Delta Air Lines confirmed the purchase of Singapore Airlines&#x27; 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic for £224 million, with plans to develop a transatlantic joint venture. Regulatory approval from the United States and European Union was granted on 20 June 2013, and the purchase was completed on 24 June. In December 2012, International Airlines Group CEO, Willie Walsh, suggested that the loss-making company would be history within five years. &quot;I can&#x27;t see Delta wanting to operate the Virgin brand because if they do what does that say about the Delta brand? I just don&#x27;t see that the guy [Branson] has anything that stands out in terms of what he has achieved in the industry.&quot;

In July 2017, Virgin Group agreed to sell a 31% stake in the airline to Air France-KLM for £220 million, leaving it with a 20% holding. The deal fell through in late 2019.

===Service concept===

Virgin Atlantic aircraft operate with a three-class cabin configuration: Economy, Premium (formerly Premium Economy), and Upper Class - the business class product. Premium has a separate check-in area, priority boarding and a wider seat with more legroom. Upper Class features a seat that converts into a fully flat bed and access to a private check in area (called the Upper Class Wing at London Heathrow). Virgin Atlantic was the first airline to offer personal entertainment for all passengers in all classes.

The airline&#x27;s frequent-flyer program is styled &#x27;the Flying Club&#x27;.

Virgin Atlantic operate five airport lounges branded as &#x27;Clubhouses&#x27; at London Heathrow, John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C., San Francisco International Airport and O. R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg. It also operates a &#x27;Revivals&#x27; arrival lounge in London Heathrow. They are accessible for passengers travelling in Upper Class and Flying Club Gold tier members. Where applicable, Upper Class passengers are also welcome to use Delta Sky Clubs prior to departure. Virgin Atlantic gives passengers a pack of Love Hearts at the end of every flight.

===Little Red===
British Midland International provided domestic and European feeder traffic into Heathrow Airport in partnership with Virgin until it was purchased by British Airways&#x27; parent company International Airlines Group in 2011. The Lufthansa-owned airline had faced heavy annual losses of more than £100 million. Under the terms of the takeover, IAG had to relinquish some former BMI domestic slots at Heathrow. Virgin Atlantic purchased enough slots in 2012 to enable it to launch a domestic service on 31 March 2013, under the Little Red brand, operating a total of 12 daily services from London to Aberdeen (three), Edinburgh (six), and Manchester (three). The airline wet-leased four Airbus Airbus A320-200s from Aer Lingus, operating with Virgin Atlantic livery, under a three-year contract.

In September 2014, it was reported that Virgin Atlantic was considering closing its domestic brand after suffering heavy losses, with Civil Aviation Authority figures confirming an average seat occupancy level of just 37.6% in 2013. The 12 daily pairs of take-off and landing slots at Heathrow cannot be sold to be used for long-haul routes.

On 6 October 2014, Virgin Atlantic confirmed that the Little Red service would cease; flights to Manchester ended on 28 March 2015 and flights to Edinburgh and Aberdeen ended on 26 September 2015.

===Virgin Atlantic International Limited===
On 13 April 2015, Virgin Atlantic incorporated a new subsidiary – Virgin Atlantic International Limited. In November 2015, the subsidiary obtained its own Air Operators Certificate and Operating Licence, and commenced operations with two former Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited operated Airbus A330-300 aircraft taking over routes previously operated by Virgin Atlantic Limited between London Gatwick and Barbados, St Lucia, Antigua, Grenada and Tobago. These flights are operated on behalf of Virgin Atlantic.

Upon incorporation as an AOC holder, the majority of Virgin Atlantic&#x27;s landing slots at London Heathrow Airport were transferred to Virgin Atlantic International Limited, allowing Virgin Atlantic to access the value of the carriers&#x27; slots by &#x27;mortgaging&#x27; them through open investment from capital markets.

===Flybe takeover bid===
On 11 January 2019, Virgin Atlantic formed the Connect Airways consortium with Stobart Aviation and Cyrus Capital, to make a takeover bid for Flybe. The deal would see the consortium combine Flybe and Stobart Air with Virgin Atlantic to create an integrated carrier operating under the Virgin Atlantic brand. Flybe and Stobart Air would however retain their own Air Operator Certificates. On 15 January 2019, Connect Airways announced an increased offer, which Flybe&#x27;s board accepted. On 21 February 2019, the Flybe Group confirmed that its operating assets, including the airline and the website, had indeed been transferred to Connect Airways, despite a last-minute rival bid. However, despite the investment of £135 million from Connect Airways into Flybe, the airline filed for administration and ceased operations with immediate effect in March 2020, following reduced demand that Virgin Atlantic attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and the UK government failing to grant a £100 million loan.

===Gender-neutral ticketing and uniforms===

In September 2022, Virgin Atlantic announced the introduction of two new sets of uniforms, designed by Vivienne Westwood, as well as a new policy to embrace the concept of gender neutrality. She worked closely with Richard Branson to design a uniform comprises a bright red skirt suit and high-heeled shoes, and the other a burgundy-coloured trouser suit with a grey waistcoat, red tie and flat black shoes. Staff will be allowed to choose either uniform, and may also choose to wear a badge indicating their preferred pronoun of address. The new uniforms are for crew, pilots and ground staff.

At the same time, the company is making changes to its ticketing systems to allow those holding passports which indicate gender-neutrality to be entered as “U” or “X”, as well as offering a new title of address, “Mx”, on their reservations. At this time, not all countries offer this option on passports; those that do include the United States, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Australia, Canada, Argentina, Colombia, Germany, Ireland, and Iceland.

==Fleet==

Virgin Atlantic operates a fleet consisting entirely of widebody aircraft from both Airbus and Boeing.

Airbus A330-300

The A330-300 is an Airbus wide-body airliner. The oldest model in the fleet, the first was delivered in April 2011, and currently Virgin Atlantic operates 8 as of 2024.

Airbus A330-900

The A330-900, part of the A330neo family, is a newer, more efficient version of the original A330. The latest purchase by Virgin, the first was delivered in October 2022, and operate 7 as of November 2024.

Airbus A350-1000

The A350-1000 is a wide-body airliner manufactured by Airbus. Virgin Atlantic first took delivery of one in August 2019, and they operate 12 of these aircraft as of June 2024.

Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner

The 787-9 Dreamliner is also a wide-body airliner made by Boeing. The only Boeing aircraft in the fleet, Virgin&#x27;s first one arrived in October 2014, and they operate 17 of these aircraft as of 2023.

==Livery==
Virgin Atlantic&#x27;s first aircraft were painted with a &quot;Eurowhite&quot; design with a red stripe through the centre of the main deck windows. The engines were metallic silver and the tail red with the logo in white. In the 1990s, the refreshed design was introduced, removing the centre red stripe through the windows, engines were painted red, the Virgin Atlantic titles in grey were added along the main fuselage, and the &#x27;Flying Lady&#x27; was introduced to the nose area.

In October 2006, with the delivery of G-VRED, Virgin Atlantic introduced a new design, with the fuselage painted in metallic silver and a revised tail fin, with red and purple features and the logo. Near the nose of each aircraft is a pin-up girl, the &quot;Scarlet Lady&quot;, carrying a Union flag, which was designed by British artist Ken White, who modelled the motif on the World War II pin-ups of Alberto Vargas – hence the naming one of the fleet &quot;Varga Girl&quot; (in this case, an A340-600 registered G-VGAS).

Each aircraft has a name, usually feminine, such as &quot;Ladybird&quot;, &quot;Island Lady&quot;, and &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot;, but some are linked to registrations (e.g. G-VFIZ became &quot;Bubbles&quot;). A couple are commemorative names (e.g. G-VEIL—&quot;Queen of the Skies&quot;—which was named by Queen Elizabeth II on 7 April 2004, marking the centenary of the Entente Cordiale; this frame exited the fleet in April 2016. In January 2023, a new airframe — an Airbus A330-900 registered G-VEII — was christened &quot;Queen of the Skies&quot; in honor of the late monarch). An exception is &quot;Spirit of Sir Freddie&quot;. An early Boeing 747, it was named in honour of Freddie Laker of Laker Airways, who helped Virgin Atlantic following the demise of his own airline. G-VFAB—&quot;Lady Penelope&quot;—gained a special livery to celebrate Virgin Atlantic&#x27;s 21st birthday. G-VFAB, &quot;Lady Penelope&quot;, exited the fleet in September 2015 after 21 years of service and was subsequently parted out. In 2006, the airline ran an eBay auction to name an Airbus A340-600, registered G-VYOU. The winner named it &quot;Emmeline Heaney&quot; after his newborn daughter, and the name adorned the aircraft for the remainder of its operating service until the aircraft was retired in October 2019. In 2018, a previously stored Airbus A340-600 registered G-VNAP was returned to active use by Virgin Atlantic, and was renamed from &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; to &quot;Sleeping Beauty Rejuvenated&quot;. It additionally received a special &quot;thank you&quot; livery dedicated to its 9,000 employees. In 2019, one of the airline&#x27;s Boeing 747-400 aircraft (Registration G-VROS) was renamed from &quot;English Rose&quot; to &quot;Forever Young&quot; in honour of lost colleagues.

The current livery dates from 2010 and returns to the &quot;Eurowhite&quot; design featuring purple billboard titles on the fuselage, slight changes to the Scarlet Lady, and new red metallic paint for the aircraft&#x27;s tail and engines. On aircraft that have winglets, the wingtips are red, with the logo on the inside facing passengers on board. The Virgin Atlantic logo was also added in purple billboard titles to the underside of the aircraft.

In anticipation of the Airbus A350-1000&#x27;s introduction to the airline&#x27;s fleet, Virgin Atlantic announced in April 2019 that its Flying Lady mascot to be adorned on the A350&#x27;s nose would be replaced by illustrations referred to as &quot;Flying Icons&quot;, consisting of a range of five individual characters in an effort to represent modern Britain. Each of the characters, separately named Daley, Meera, Oscar, Ray, and Zadie, were styled and posed with Union flags similarly to the Flying Lady. Originally portraying the characters in leotards, the illustrations were later revised by designer Toby Tinsley to instead portray the characters wearing more clothing and revealing less skin, prior to their application on Virgin Atlantic&#x27;s first A350. Meera, one of the first five characters, was also at some point changed to or replaced by Mei, a new character portraying a Chinese woman. Reasons for the changes or revisions were not provided by Virgin Atlantic or anyone involved in the branding. At least one additional Flying Icon was unveiled to complement the initial five, including an icon portraying an Indian woman, named Aria.

==Incidents and accidents==
Virgin Atlantic is considered to have a strong safety reputation. Since the airline&#x27;s founding in 1984, it has never suffered a complete hull-loss incident or a passenger fatality.

* On 5 November 1997, after numerous attempts to shake free the jammed main landing gear of an Airbus A340-300 (G-VSKY) failed, the aircraft en route from Los Angeles to Heathrow made an emergency landing at Heathrow Airport. The aircraft sustained major damage to the undersides of engines one, two, and four, which made contact with the runway surface during landing. The runway surface was also damaged and several runway lights were broken as the right main landing gear wheels broke up during the deceleration. The aircraft was evacuated safely. Two crew members and five passengers sustained minor injuries during the evacuation. The damaged aircraft was repaired after the incident and was retired from the Virgin Atlantic fleet in 2003.
* On 8 February 2005, on board an Airbus A340-600 aircraft (G-VATL) en route from Hong Kong to Heathrow, the fuel control computer system caused a loss of automatic fuel transfer between tanks. The pilots diverted to Amsterdam and landed safely. The interim accident report made four safety recommendations addressed to the primary certification bodies for large transport category aircraft (EASA and the FAA), advising on the need for a low-fuel warning system for large aircraft.
* On 11 August 2011, Virgin Atlantic flight VS52, a Boeing 747-400 (G-VXLG) operating from Tobago-A.N.R. Robinson International Airport to London Gatwick Airport sustained minor damage in a taxiing incident. The aeroplane was taxiing out towards the departure runway at Tobago-A.N.R. Robinson International Airport when it entered a taxiway that was closed for construction activity. One of the wheels partly sank through the concrete. This resulted in the Boeing 747-400 becoming stuck.
* On 29 December 2014, a Boeing 747-400 (G-VROM) operating a flight from London Gatwick Airport to McCarran International Airport (now Harry Reid International Airport) in Las Vegas, Nevada, as Virgin Atlantic Flight 43, returned to Gatwick following an indication that the far right main landing gear was stuck inside the aircraft. The Boeing 747-400 landed safely on runway 26L at Gatwick without further incident. Investigators found that an actuator in the landing gear was installed inverted, sticking the landing gear leg sideways and could not be extended. There were no injuries to the 465 people on board and the aircraft returned to service on 11 January 2015.
* On 15 March 2021, Virgin Atlantic flight 453 operated by a Boeing 787-9 en route to Tel Aviv from Heathrow was forced to return to Heathrow after the aircraft was subject to a laser attack from the ground during take-off. The flight crew issued an emergency &quot;Pan&quot; call whilst flying over Paris after the captain lost sight in one eye. No other injuries were reported.
* On 2 May 2022, Virgin Atlantic flight VS3, callsign VIR3N operated by an Airbus A330-343 (G-VWAG) was bound for New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy Airport from London Heathrow Airport when it was forced to turn around over Ireland approximately 35 minutes after takeoff. This was due to a rostering error leading to the First Officer operating the flight before they had fully completed their company training. The CAA confirmed that the First Officer in question is a fully qualified pilot and no risk to safety or wrongdoing took place. Virgin confirmed it was an internal training incident and swiftly replaced the first officer to allow the flight to resume shortly after.
* On 6 April 2024, there was a ground collision involving a British Airways plane with 121 passengers on board and a Boeing 787 plane. Heathrow said there were no injuries and no delays but both aircraft suffered wing damage.

<doc id="93767" wikidata="Q203059" url="?curid=93767" title="Virgin Records">
<text>Virgin Records is a British record label owned by Universal Music Group. They were originally founded as a British independent record label in 1972 by entrepreneurs Richard Branson, Simon Draper, Nik Powell, and musician Tom Newman. They grew to be a worldwide success over time, with the success of platinum performers Paula Abdul, Janet Jackson, Devo, Tangerine Dream, Genesis, Phil Collins, OMD, the Human League, Culture Club, Simple Minds, the Spice Girls, Lenny Kravitz, the Sex Pistols, and Mike Oldfield among others, meaning that by the time it was sold, it was regarded as a major label, alongside other large international independents such as A&amp;M and Island Records.

Virgin Records was sold to Thorn EMI in 1992. EMI would later be acquired by Universal Music Group (UMG) in 2012 with UMG creating the Virgin EMI Records division. The Virgin Records name continues to be used by UMG in certain markets such as Germany and Japan.

== Virgin Records America ==
Virgin Records America, Inc. was the company&#x27;s North American operations founded in 1986. They are no longer active and were headquartered in Hollywood, California, and operated under the Capitol Music Group imprint, now also owned by UMG, since 2012. The US operations had also taken on the name Virgin Records. A minor number of artists remained on Virgin Records America&#x27;s roster, which was mostly occupied with European artists such as Bastille, Barbara Pravi, Circa Waves, Corinne Bailey Rae, Ella Eyre, Grizfolk, Walking on Cars, Seinabo Sey, and Prides; American artists include Knox Hamilton, L&#x27;Tric, Loren Gray, and Rise Against.

== Virgin Classics ==
Virgin Classics was founded in 1988 as part of Virgin Records. Along with EMI Classics, it too was acquired by UMG in 2012 as part of the takeover of the EMI Group. But the terms of the European Commission&#x27;s approval of the takeover required divestment of the two classical labels. Accordingly, both were sold in February the following year to Warner Music Group, and this transaction was approved by the European Union that May. Warner placed the Virgin Classics artist roster and catalogue in its Erato Records division, and the &quot;Virgin Classics&quot; name, along with &quot;EMI Classics,&quot; disappeared.

==History==

Branson and Powell had initially run a small record shop called &quot;Virgin Records and Tapes&quot; on Notting Hill Gate, London, specializing in krautrock imports, and offering bean bags and free vegetarian food for the benefit of customers listening to the music on offer. The first real store was above a shoe shop at the Tottenham Court Road end of Oxford Street.

After making the shop into a success, they turned their business into a fully fledged record label. The name Virgin, according to Branson (in his autobiography), arose from Tessa Watts, a colleague of his, when they were brainstorming business ideas. She suggested Virgin – as they were all new to business – like &quot;virgins&quot;. The original Virgin logo (known to fans as the &quot;Gemini&quot; or &quot;Twins&quot; logo) was designed by English artist and illustrator Roger Dean: a young naked woman in mirror image with a large long-tailed lizard and the word &quot;Virgin&quot; in Dean&#x27;s familiar script. A variation on the logo was used for the spin-off Caroline Records label.

The first release on the label was the progressive rock album &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; by multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield, who was discovered by Tom Newman and brought to Simon Draper – who eventually persuaded Richard and Nik to present it as their first release 
in 1973, produced by Tom Newman, for which the fledgling label garnered unprecedented acclaim. This was soon followed by some notable krautrock releases, including electronic breakthrough album &quot;Phaedra&quot; by Tangerine Dream (which went Top 20), and &quot;The Faust Tapes&quot; and &quot;Faust IV&quot; by Faust. &quot;The Faust Tapes&quot; album retailed for 49p (the price of a 7&quot; single) and as a result allowed this relatively unknown band a massive audience as the album sold over 60,000 copies and also reached number 12 in the charts, though it was later redacted its spot on the grounds of the cover price. Other early albums include Gong&#x27;s &quot;Flying Teapot (Radio Gnome Invisible, Pt. 1)&quot;, which Daevid Allen has been quoted as having never been paid for.
The first single release for the label was Kevin Coyne&#x27;s &quot;Marlene&quot; (b/w &quot;Everybody Says&quot;), taken from his album &quot;Marjory Razorblade&quot; and released in August 1973. Coyne was the second artist signed to the label after Oldfield. 

===Rebranding===
Although Virgin was initially one of the key labels of English and European progressive rock, the 1977 signing of the Sex Pistols (who had already been signed and then dropped by both EMI and A&amp;M) reinvented the label PM in a new-wave outpost, a move that plunged the record company into the mainstream of the punk rock era. Under the guidance of Tessa Watts, Virgin&#x27;s Head of Publicity (and later, also Director of Production), the Pistols rocketed the label to success. Shortly afterwards, the Nottingham record shop was raided by police for having a window display of the Sex Pistols&#x27; album &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot; in the window. Afterwards they signed other new wave groups: Public Image Ltd, Boxer, Culture Club, Fingerprintz, Gillan, Holly and the Italians, The Human League (whose &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot; was the label&#x27;s first chart-topping single, in 1981), Magazine, Skids, the Motors, Penetration, the Ruts, Shooting Star, Simple Minds, and XTC.

After modified versions of the twins label came the red, white and blue design introduced in 1975, which coincided with the height of punk and new wave. The current Virgin logo (known informally as &quot;the scrawl&quot;) was created in 1978, commissioned by Simon Draper, then managing director of Virgin Records Limited. Brian Cooke of Cooke Key Associates commissioned a graphic designer to produce a stylised signature. The logo was first used on Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Incantations&quot; album in 1978 and by the Virgin Records label exclusively until gradually other parts of the Virgin Group adopted it, including Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Mobile and Virgin Money.

===Purchase by Thorn EMI===
Virgin Records was sold by Branson to Thorn EMI in June 1992 for a reported US$1 billion (around £560 million) (), with a special non-competition clause that would prevent Branson from founding another recording company during the five years following the agreement (see the final paragraph in EU Merger Decision IV/M202 of 27 April 1992). It now faces competition from Branson&#x27;s new label: V2 Records. Branson sold Virgin Records to fund Virgin Atlantic which at that time was coming under intense anti-competitive pressure from British Airways. In 1993, BA settled a libel action brought by Branson over BA&#x27;s &quot;dirty tricks&quot; campaign, giving him £500,000 and a further £110,000 to his airline.

After being acquired by Thorn EMI, Virgin launched several subsidiaries like Realworld Records, Innocent Records, blues speciality label Point Blank Records, and indie music label Hut Recordings, and continued signing new and established artists like Korn, A Fine Frenzy, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Tina Turner, Beenie Man, The Rolling Stones, Spice Girls, The Smashing Pumpkins, We Are Scientists, The Kooks, dcTalk (mainstream releases, contract ended in 2000), Belinda Carlisle, Meat Loaf, Placebo, Janet Jackson (contract ended in 2006), Daft Punk (contract ended in 2008), My Favorite Highway, Does It Offend You, Yeah?, The Future Sound of London, The Chemical Brothers, Brooke Allison, The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, The Almost, Mariah Carey (contract ended in 2002), N.E.R.D, Laura Marling, Swami, RBD, Thalía and Priscilla Renea.

Because business models increasingly diverged, Thorn EMI shareholders voted in favour of demerger proposals on 16 August 1996. The resulting media company became the EMI Group. In 1997, Virgin absorbed the remainder of EMI USA, which earlier consolidated EMI America Records and Manhattan Records, with Capitol Records acquiring EMI&#x27;s other American operations, and in 1998, opened a country music division called Virgin Records Nashville, of which record producer Scott Hendricks was president. The label&#x27;s signees comprised Julie Reeves, Jerry Kilgore, Roy D. Mercer, Tom Mabe, Chris Cagle, Clay Davidson, and River Road. In 2001, Virgin Nashville closed and its roster was folded into Capitol Records&#x27; Nashville division.

===Further mergers===

Capitol Records and Virgin Records America merged in 2007 to form Capitol Music Group after a massive restructuring of EMI Group Ltd. Stepping down as chief executive of Capitol Records was Andy Slater, with Jason Flom, former executive of Virgin, taking the reins as chairman and CEO of the newly created company.

Universal Music Group (UMG) purchased EMI in 2012, thus acquiring Virgin. UMG absorbed Virgin&#x27;s UK operations to create Virgin EMI Records in March 2013.

On 16 June 2020, Universal rebranded Virgin EMI Records as EMI Records and named Rebecca Allen (former president of UMG&#x27;s Decca label) as the label&#x27;s president, with Virgin Records now operating as an imprint of latter label.

In February 2021, the Universal Music Group announced that it will rebrand the Caroline Music Group as Virgin Music Label &amp; Artist Services, the name change was &quot;inspired and influenced by the spirit and ethos of the iconic Virgin Records label&quot;. In September 2022, UMG consolidated Virgin Music Label &amp; Artist Services, Ingrooves Music Group, and the recently acquired mtheory Artist Partnerships as part of the newly launched division Virgin Music Group. UMG also appointed mtheory founders JT Myers and Nat Pastor as Co-CEOs of the new division.

==American editions==

The Virgin label was distributed in the US by Atlantic from 1973 to 1975. During this period, 14 albums were issued. All had been previously issued in the UK on Virgin, although one album, &quot;Marjory Razorblade&quot; by Kevin Coyne, was truncated from a 20-song double album to an 11-song single album.

Beginning with Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Ommadawn&quot; album in 1975, American distribution switched to CBS Records/Columbia Records. CBS/Columbia was unwilling to release all Virgin artists, and so many were licensed to other labels: 
*Epic (the sister company of Columbia): (Mike Oldfield (1980s releases), Captain Beefheart (1982&#x27;s Ice Cream For Crow), Culture Club (1982–1986), Holly and the Italians, some XTC (1982&#x27;s English Settlement) and Shooting Star)
*Atlantic: (Julian Lennon, Genesis (previously on Charisma Records), Phil Collins)
*A&amp;M: (UB40, The Human League, Simple Minds, Breathe, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and The Blue Nile)
*Warner Bros.: (Sex Pistols, Scritti Politti, Devo)
*Geffen (XTC – 1983 on)
*MCA: (Tangerine Dream, Belinda Carlisle, Loose Ends, 52nd Street, &quot;Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence&quot; by Ryuichi Sakamoto)
*RCA: (&quot;1984 (For the Love of Big Brother)&quot; by Eurythmics; the band were signed to RCA, but produced the soundtrack on commission from Virgin)
*Arista: (Heaven 17, Jermaine Stewart)
Some of these records had a small Virgin logo added to the regular company design on the label. One of Virgin&#x27;s and Epic&#x27;s biggest acts of the 1980s was Culture Club.

In 1978, Virgin set up US operations first in New York on Perry Street, with distribution from Atlantic Records. Virgin Records soon moved operations to New Jersey along with a short-lived subdivision called Virgin International, handled by independent New Jersey–based distributor Jem Records. Virgin International was used mainly for progressive rock artists and reissues of earlier Virgin / Atlantic albums such as &quot;Hergest Ridge&quot; by Mike Oldfield, and &quot;Fish Rising&quot; by Steve Hillage, which Columbia chose not to reissue. Virgin International also issued albums by some of Virgin&#x27;s reggae artists, including Gregory Isaacs. At the same time, Virgin releases distributed by Columbia continued, distribution returning to Atlantic (later WEA) in 1980, at which time Virgin International ceased operations.

In 1986, Virgin Records opened up another American division, Virgin Records America. Its first release was the debut album by Cutting Crew which included the hit single &quot;(I Just) Died in Your Arms&quot;. Other Virgin America signings included Camper Van Beethoven, Bob Mould, Warren Zevon, Paula Abdul, T&#x27;pau, Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers, Redhead Kingpin &amp; The F.B.I., Neneh Cherry, Steve Winwood, Hindsight and, after her MCA contract ran out in 1991, Belinda Carlisle. Virgin Records America&#x27;s releases were distributed through WEA again by Atlantic Records until 1992. The label was then acquired by EMI-Capitol Special Markets. In 1996, Virgin Records offered Janet Jackson one of the best and highest deals at the time estimating an $80 million deal. The agreement also required Virgin to allocate about $25 million in video production, marketing and promotion costs – a much larger sum than most deals. Virgin Records America was founded by the executive team of Jordan Harris, Jeff Ayeroff and Phil Quartararo.

Another American company called Caroline Records co-existed during this time. Caroline records rarely mentioned a connection with Virgin, and some UK and European Virgin albums that were distributed internationally (instead of being manufactured in each country) named Caroline as their American distributor. Some Caroline records bore the label name Caroline Blue Plate, which was mainly used for reissuing on CD many early progressive rock albums and artists from Virgin and Caroline&#x27;s UK branches.

==Canadian editions==
The first Canadian editions were distributed by WEA, and were parallel issues of the same early 14 albums issued in the US by Virgin/Atlantic.

In 1975, distribution transferred to Columbia (as it had in the US), but the following year distribution was transferred again to Polydor Records (which changed its name to PolyGram by 1980), and issued a different and larger selection of records from what was being issued in the US. Canadian editions of the Dindisc label were issued as Dindisc/Virgin. Virgin&#x27;s Canadian division arranged to have Canadian artists Martha &amp; the Muffins and Nash the Slash signed to Dindisc in the UK as well; both artists had releases in Canada and the UK on Dindisc.

In 1983, an independent Virgin Records Canada Inc. company was created, three years before a similar move occurred in the US. From this time onward, Virgin Canada used unique label designs not seen in other countries: a red label with five horizontal bars across the top and an extra-large &quot;scrawl&quot; logo from 1983 to 1985, followed by a purple label with round logo up to 1992 when Virgin was acquired internationally.

==Virgin Music Publishers==
Soon after Virgin Records was founded, the label created a music publisher for its artists, who also served as songwriters. Starting in the 1980s, Virgin Music signed songwriters from other record labels. After Virgin was acquired by EMI, the publisher was folded into EMI Music Publishing as EMI Virgin Music.

In 2012, a consortium led by Sony/ATV Music Publishing acquired EMI Music Publishing for $2.2 billion. However, the European Union ruled that Sony/ATV would represent over half of all the charting hits in the United Kingdom, and required the company to auction off Virgin Music and Famous Music UK, as well as twelve unrelated authors.

In December 2012, BMG Rights Management acquired the Virgin and Famous publishers, and concluded the deal in May 2013. Virgin Music was renamed BMG VM Music, while Famous Music became BMG FM Music.

Before its demise, Virgin Music&#x27;s songwriters included Iggy Pop, Texas, Ozzy Osbourne, Cannibal Corpse, Nirvana, Winger, Wax, Tears for Fears, The Prodigy, Goo Goo Dolls, Tool, The Crystal Method, Terence Trent D&#x27;Arby, Lenny Kravitz, Ben Harper, Warrant, Mark Ronson, Devo, Culture Club, Take That, Bullet for My Valentine, Robbie Williams, Wayne Hector, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and XTC.

==Subsidiary labels==
*In 1983 Virgin purchased Charisma Records, renaming it Charisma/Virgin, then later Virgin/Charisma, before folding the label in 1986 and transferring its remaining artists to Virgin. In the process they acquired Genesis and comedy group Monty Python. The Charisma label was reactivated in the US in 1990 and enjoyed success with signings such as Maxi Priest, 38 Special and Enigma. When this Charisma label was retired in 1992, most of its artists were, as before, transferred to Virgin.
*In 1987, Venture Records was created for new age and modern classical artists including Klaus Schulze, who had been associated with Virgin since the early 1970s. (Virgin had distributed UK editions of his German albums since 1974, and he had almost been signed as a Virgin artist in 1976, but the deal was cancelled after a conflict between Virgin and his German label.)
*10 Records was sometimes branded as Ten, and was part of AVL (Associated Virgin Labels Limited – a marketing company owned by Virgin Records Ltd).
*Siren Records was another 1980s label which became part of AVL. 
*Circa Records was another 1980s AVL label, though one which became Virgin&#x27;s &#x27;strategic marketing&#x27; division making TV-advertised compilations such as &quot;The Best...Album in the World...Ever!&quot; collections under the label name Virgin TV or EMI/Virgin TV.
*Immortal Records
*Caroline Records was a budget label used from 1973 to 1977. The name and logo were later used for some American editions of Virgin records in the 1980s and 1990s. Caroline was primarily used for independent distribution until the label was reactivated in 2013. Today, Caroline Records acts as an independent label taking the place of EMI Label Services, after Virgin&#x27;s former parent company EMI was purchased by Universal Music Group. 
*Front Line Records (or Virgin&#x27;s Front Line) was a label for issuing Jamaican and English reggae music from 1978 to approximately 1987. It became an actual label name in 1978 when it succeeded a category of Virgin albums and singles marketed as &quot;The Front line Series&quot; which went back to 1976, when a reggae compilation album titled &quot;The Front Line&quot; was issued on Virgin. Front Line artists included U-Roy, U Brown, Mighty Diamonds, Keith Hudson, Althea &amp; Donna, Jah Lloyd, Johnny Clarke, The Gladiators, Peter Tosh, I-Roy, Tapper Zukie, Sly Dunbar, Twinkle Brothers, Prince Far I, Big Youth, The Abyssinians, Culture, Gregory Isaacs and Linton Kwesi Johnson.
*A short-lived associated label, Dindisc, had Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and The Monochrome Set during its brief existence (1980–1981), after which its recordings became part of Virgin&#x27;s catalogue.
*Noo Trybe Records was a hip hop record label that existed from 1994 to 1999. The label consisted of mostly West Coast hip hop artists such as the Luniz. The label also became the distributor for releases under Rap-A-Lot Records after they switched distribution from Virgin&#x27;s sister label under EMI, Priority Records in 1994. Noo Trybe also became the home of East Coast rappers AZ and Gang Starr after their respective labels EMI and Chrysalis were folded in early 1997.
*Delabel was one of the main imprints of the French division of EMI, along with Virgin Music, Hostille, Blue Note France and Labels. Delabel had a publishing company and a record label, it existed until 2012 when EMI broke up, and EMI Music France was sold to Warner Music Group (along with Parlophone and other EMI divisions) and renamed Parlophone Music France. The publishing company of Delabel, is now owned by Sony/ATV Music Publishing (which acquired EMI Music Publishing), meanwhile, the label catalogue now belongs to the new division Parlophone Music France, from Warner Music Group. It signed with Mathieu Chedid, Daft Punk, Tonton David and others, It also distributed The Prodigy&#x27;s releases in France from 1993 to 2006.

==Virgin Music international companies==
*EMI Records (formerly Virgin EMI Records) is Universal&#x27;s main label in the United Kingdom after Mercury Records UK has been reduced to a local Universal imprint and its artist moved to the new Virgin EMI label. In 2020, Virgin EMI was rebranded as EMI Records, but the Virgin brand will remain as an imprint of the newly rebranded unit.
*Virgin Schallplatten GmbH was the German subsidiary of Virgin Records. It was consolidated into EMI Germany (which is now part of Universal Music Germany).
*The Dutch branch of Virgin became independent from (then) parent company Ariola in 1984, although Ariola kept distributing and marketing Virgin&#x27;s output until it was taken over by EMI in the early 1990s (which also meant the end of Virgin&#x27;s independent status in the Netherlands). In the late 1990s Virgin launched the Top Notch label which became famous for its Dutch hip hop and rap artists. With Universal&#x27;s acquisition of EMI in 2012, Virgin became part of the Universal Music Group Netherlands.
*Virgin France SA was founded in 1980 and It was the first international division of Virgin Records, in 2002 it merged with EMI Music France and continued as an imprint, until it was consolidated into EMI France, which has been renamed Parlophone and sold to Warner Music Group, just like the divisions in Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Slovakia and Sweden. Universal (who retained Virgin&#x27;s trademark in France) would later revive Virgin France as an imprint of Mercury Records&#x27; French division in 2016; its first artist, Etienne Daho, was one of Virgin France&#x27;s biggest artists before Warner&#x27;s acquisition.

*Virgin Japan has had three incarnations:
**The first was founded in 1987, Virgin Japan, as a wholly owned Virgin subsidiary. In 1989, following the investment by the Fujisankei Communications Group in Virgin Records, a new Virgin Japan company was established focused on domestic repertoire and run by Pony Canyon, the record company of Fujisankei. After EMI&#x27;s purchase of Virgin in 1992, this incarnation of Virgin Japan was renamed Media Remoras, and it closed in 1997.
** The second incarnation was part of Toshiba-EMI, and had three sublabels: Virgin Domestic, Virgin Tokyo, and Virgin DCT (exclusive to releases from the band Dreams Come True). All three were folded in 2004 into the label Virgin Music, which was folded into EMI Records Japan in 2013 after its merger with Universal. It should, however, be noted that international Virgin releases were previously handled in Japan by Toshiba-EMI themselves prior to the 1987 establishment of the first incarnation of Virgin Japan.
** The third incarnation, Virgin Music (JPN), was established as a sublabel in 2014 following the merge of EMI R and Delicious Deli Records. Delicious Deli later became an imprint of Virgin Music alongside a new imprint, Virgin Records. In 2017, both imprints ceased operations and all artists under the two imprints were placed under the main Virgin Music label.
* The Brazilian division of Virgin started in 1996 by EMI Music Brasil with artistic direction by Rick Bonadio, with artists like Surto, Charlie Brown Jr. and Tihuana, and existed from 1996 to 2001, when it was absorbed by EMI, and in 2012 by Universal.

<text>A government bond or sovereign bond is a form of bond issued by a government to support public spending. It generally includes a commitment to pay periodic interest, called coupon payments&quot;,&quot; and to repay the face value on the maturity date.

For example, a bondholder invests $20,000, called face value or principal, into a 10-year government bond with a 10% annual coupon; the government would pay the bondholder 10% interest ($2000 in this case) each year and repay the $20,000 original face value at the date of maturity (i.e. after 10 years).

Government bonds can be denominated in a foreign currency or the government&#x27;s domestic currency. Countries with less stable economies tend to denominate their bonds in the currency of a country with a more stable economy (i.e. a hard currency). All bonds carry default risk; that is, the possibility that the government will be unable to pay bondholders. Bonds from countries with less stable economies are usually considered to be higher risk. International credit rating agencies provide ratings for each country&#x27;s bonds. Bondholders generally demand higher yields from riskier bonds. For instance, on May 24, 2016, 10-year government bonds issued by the Canadian government offered a yield of 1.34%, while 10-year government bonds issued by the Brazilian government offered a yield of 12.84%.

Governments close to a default are sometimes referred to as being in a sovereign debt crisis.

==History==

The Dutch Republic became the first state to finance its debt through bonds when it assumed bonds issued by the city of Amsterdam in 1517. The average interest rate at that time fluctuated around 20%.

The first official government bond issued by a national government was issued by the Bank of England in 1694 to raise money to fund a war against France. The form of these bonds was both lottery and annuity. The Bank of England and government bonds were introduced in England by William III of England (also called William of Orange), who financed England&#x27;s war efforts by copying the approach of issuing bonds and raising government debt from the Seven Dutch Provinces, where he ruled as a stadtholder.

Later, governments in Europe started following the trend and issuing perpetual bonds (bonds with no maturity date) to fund wars and other government spending. The use of perpetual bonds ceased in the 20th century, and currently governments issue bonds of limited term to maturity.

During the American Revolution, in order to raise money, the U.S. government started to issue bonds - called loan certificates. The total amount generated by bonds was $27 million and helped finance the war.

==Risks==

===Credit risk===
A government bond in a country&#x27;s own currency is strictly speaking a risk-free bond, because the government can if necessary create additional currency in order to redeem the bond at maturity. For most governments, this is possible only through the issue of new bonds, as the governments have no possibility to create currency. (The issue of bonds which are then bought by the central bank with newly created currency in the process of &quot;quantitative easing&quot; may be regarded as de facto direct state financing from the central bank, which is outlawed officially for independent central banks.) There have been instances where a government has chosen to default on its domestic currency debt rather than create additional currency, such as Russia in 1998 (the &quot;ruble crisis&quot;) (see national bankruptcy).

Investors may use rating agencies to assess credit risk. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has designated ten rating agencies as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.

===Currency risk===
Currency risk is the risk that the value of the currency a bond pays out will decline compared to the holder&#x27;s reference currency. For example, a German investor would consider United States bonds to have more currency risk than German bonds (since the dollar may go down relative to the euro); similarly, a United States investor would consider German bonds to have more currency risk than United States bonds (since the euro may go down relative to the dollar). A bond paying in a currency that does not have a history of keeping its value may not be a good deal even if a high interest rate is offered. The currency risk is determined by the fluctuation of exchange rates.

===Inflation risk===

Inflation risk is the risk that the value of the currency a bond pays out will decline over time. Investors expect some amount of inflation, so the risk is that the inflation rate will be higher than expected. Many governments issue inflation-indexed bonds, which protect investors against inflation risk by linking both interest payments and maturity payments to a consumer price index. In the UK these bonds are called Index-linked bonds. In the US these bonds are called Series I bonds.

===Interest rate risk===

Also referred to as market risk, all bonds are subject to interest rate risk.
Interest rate changes can affect the value of a bond. If the interest rates fall, then the bond prices rise and if the interest rates rise, bond prices fall. When interest rates rise, bonds are more attractive because investors can earn higher coupon rate, thereby holding period risk may occur. Interest rate and bond price have negative correlation. Lower fixed-rate bond coupon rates meaning higher interest rate risk and higher fixed-rate bond coupon rates meaning lower interest rate risk. Maturity of a bond also has an impact on the interest rate risk. Indeed, longer maturity meaning higher interest rate risk and shorter maturity meaning lower interest rate risk.

==Money supply==

If a central bank purchases a government security, such as a bond or treasury bill, it increases the money supply because a Central Bank injects liquidity (cash) into the economy. Doing this lowers the government bond&#x27;s yield. On the contrary, when a Central Bank is fighting against inflation then a Central Bank decreases the money supply.

These actions of increasing or decreasing the amount of money in the banking system are called monetary policy.

==United Kingdom==
In the UK, government bonds are called gilts. Older issues have names such as &quot;Treasury Stock&quot; and newer issues are called &quot;Treasury Gilt&quot;. Inflation-indexed gilts are called &quot;Index-linked gilts&quot;., which means the value of the gilt rises with inflation.
They are fixed-interest securities issued by the British government in order to raise money. The issuance of gilts is managed by the UK Debt Management Office, an executive agency of HM Treasury. Prior to April 1998, gilts were issued by the Bank of England. Purchase and sales services are managed by Computershare.

UK gilts have maturities stretching much further into the future than other European government bonds, which has influenced the development of pension and life insurance markets in the respective countries.

A conventional UK gilt might look like this – &quot;Treasury stock 3% 2020&quot;. On the 27 of April 2019 the United Kingdom 10Y Government Bond had a 1.145% yield. Central Bank Rate is 0.10% and the United Kingdom rating is AA, according to Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s.

== United States ==

The U.S. Treasury offered several types of bonds with various maturities. Certain bonds may pay interest, others not. These bonds could be:

* Savings bonds: they are considered one of the safest investments.
* Treasury notes (T-notes): maturity of these bonds is two, three, five or 10 years, they provided fixed coupon payments every six months and have face value of $1,000.
* Treasury bonds (T-bonds or long bonds): are the treasury bonds with the longest maturity, from twenty years to thirty years. They also have a coupon payment every six months.
* Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS): are the inflation-indexed bond issued by the U.S. Treasury. The principal of these bonds is adjusted to the Consumer Price Index. In other words, the principal increases with inflation and decreases with deflation.

The principal argument for investors to hold U.S. government bonds is that the bonds are exempt from state and local taxes.

The bonds are sold through an auction system by the government. The bonds are buying and selling on the secondary market, the financial market in which financial instruments such as stock, bond, option and futures are traded.

TreasuryDirect is the official website where investors can purchase treasury securities directly from the U.S. government. This online system allow investors to save money on commissions and fees taken with traditional channels. Investors can use banks or brokers to hold a bond.

<text>PKZIP is a file archiving computer program, notable for introducing the popular ZIP file format. PKZIP was first introduced for MS-DOS on the IBM-PC compatible platform in 1989. Since then versions have been released for a number of other architectures and operating systems. PKZIP was originally written by Phil Katz and marketed by his company PKWARE, Inc starting in 1986. The company bears his initials: &quot;PK&quot;.

==History==

By the 1970s, file archiving programs were distributed as standard utilities with operating systems. They include the Unix utilities ar, shar, and tar. These utilities were designed to gather a number of separate files into a single archive file for easier copying and distribution. These archives could optionally be passed through a stream compressor utility, such as compress and others.

Other archivers also appeared during the 1980s, including ARC by System Enhancement Associates, Inc. (SEA), Rahul Dhesi&#x27;s ZOO, Dean W. Cooper&#x27;s DWC, LHarc by Haruhiko Okomura and Haruyasu Yoshizaki and ARJ which stands for &quot;Archived by Robert Jung&quot;.

The development of PKZIP was first announced in the file SOFTDEV.DOC from within the PKPAK 3.61 package, stating it would develop a new and yet unnamed compression program. The announcement had been made following the lawsuit between SEA and PKWARE, Inc. Although SEA won the suit, it lost the compression war, as the user base migrated to PKZIP as the compressor of choice. Led by some BBS sysops who refused to accept or offer files compressed as .ARC files, users began recompressing any old archives that were currently stored in .ARC format into .ZIP files.

The first version was released in 1989, as a DOS command-line tool, distributed under shareware model with a US$25 registration fee (US$47 with manual).

==.ZIP file format==
To help ensure the interoperability of the ZIP format, Phil Katz published the original .ZIP File Format Specification in the APPNOTE.TXT documentation file. PKWARE continued to maintain this document and periodically published updates. Originally only bundled with registered versions of PKZIP, it was later available on the PKWARE site.

The specification has its own version number, which does not necessarily correspond to the PKZIP version numbers, especially with PKZIP 6 or later. At various times, PKWARE adds preliminary features that allows PKZIP products to extract archives using advanced features, but PKZIP products that create such archives won&#x27;t be available until the next major release.

==Compatibility==
Although popular at the time, ZIP archives using PKZIP 1.0 compression methods are now rare, and many unzip tools such as 7-Zip are able to read and write several other archive formats.

==Patents==
Shrinking uses dynamic LZW, on which Unisys held patents. A patent for the Reduce Algorithm had also been filed on June 19, 1984, long before PKZIP was produced.

<text>Compassion International is an American child sponsorship and Christian humanitarian aid organization headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, that aims to positively influence the long-term development of children globally who live in poverty.

A 2013 independent research report, in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot;, concluded that as of that time, Compassion International had large and statistically significant impacts on participants&#x27; years of school completion, the probability of later employment, and the quality of that employment, in part as a consequence of improved self-esteem and expectations in participating children.

==History==
The Everett Swanson Evangelistic Association was founded in 1952 by the Rev. Everett Swanson (member of Converge) to help children orphaned by war in South Korea. Swanson had traveled there to preach the gospel to the US Army troops, but during his visit he was deeply moved by the plight of the scores of abandoned children he saw. In 1953, he began to raise funds, and the next year he developed sponsorship programs to help support orphans for a few dollars a month. The name of the association changed to Compassion, Inc., in 1963, inspired by Jesus&#x27; words &quot;I have compassion on the multitude. I will not send them away hungry&quot; (Matthew 15.32). In 2022, it would be present in 27 countries. For example, see Compassion Suisse and Compassion Espagna

==Leadership==
As of November 2019, the board chair of the organization was Judy Golz, and the president and CEO was Santiago Mellado. In 2019, Mellado&#x27;s annual compensation was $419,184 according to the organization&#x27;s IRS filings.

==Programs==
Compassion helps those in impoverished areas, using a holistic approach to child development. This approach goes well beyond simply providing food and medical aid, involving education and training to prepare the individuals for contributing back to their communities.

The organization also helps in emergency situations and in the funding of health centers.

===Child sponsorship===
Children in the child sponsorship program are provided food and clean water, medical care, education, life-skills training, and spiritual guidance through a direct sponsorship. Sponsored children are selected by the sponsors from lists provided by the ministry, and two-way communication is encouraged between the sponsored child and the sponsor. the cost to sponsor a child through Compassion was US$43 (£32) per month, and globally there were over two million babies, children, and young adults in its programs.

Sponsors are able to visit their sponsored children through trips planned by Compassion International. Compassion&#x27;s goal is to provide a trip to each country every other year. Compassion coordinates every aspect of the trip, including travel, meals, tips and gratuities, fees related to the travel, and sightseeing fares.

==Evaluations==

Compassion International is a charter member of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability. , it held a grade of &quot;A&quot; from CharityWatch. , it had met the &quot;20 Standards for Charity Accountability&quot; from the Better Business Bureau&#x27;s Wise Giving Alliance.

In 2013, a primary research report in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; provided evidence in support of the conclusion that child sponsorship via Compassion International resulted in significant positive outcomes for the children in the study set. The research, by Bruce Wydick, Paul Glewwe, and Laine Rutledge, evaluated Compassion efforts in six countries, with 10,144 children studied, reporting &quot;large, statistically significant impacts on years of schooling; primary, secondary, and tertiary school completion; and the probability and quality of employment.&quot; They went on to note that the evidence, while early, &quot;suggest[ed] that these impacts are due, in part, to increases in children’s aspirations.&quot;

Through 2015, Compassion International had received Charity Navigator&#x27;s highest rating for 15 consecutive years, thereby receiving special recognition on their &quot;10 Charities with the Most Consecutive 4-Star Ratings&quot; list. However, Charity Navigator changed its rating system in 2016, and Compassion International&#x27;s 2016 overall rating dropped to three stars out of four, for its accountability and transparency.

In 2016, Compassion was ranked the 15th-largest charity organization in the US by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, with $799 million in private donations received.

===Shutdown in India===
Compassion operated in India for 48 years, with $45 million in transfers annually, making it India&#x27;s largest single foreign donor. Compassion provided services under its Child Sponsor Program to 145,000 Indian children. In 2015, Compassion affiliates&#x27; offices were raided by tax investigators seeking evidence on whether it was funding religious conversions. Compassion said that attempts were made to force the ministry to divert funding to non-Christian Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh groups. Compassion refused to do so as it would be a misuse of funds entrusted to them by donors all around the world. After talks back and forth, in 2017 the BJP-led Indian government barred Compassion from transferring funds into India, forcing the group to close its operations in that country. The Ministry of External Affairs later stated that the ban had nothing to do with the ideology of Compassion International.

===Lack of Financial Transparency===
Since 2019, Compassion stopped releasing a public Form 990 after reclassifying itself as a religious organization, or &quot;an association of churches.&quot; Reclassification has been noted by several Christian ministry watchdogs as a growing trend among large Christian ministries. As a result, Compassion&#x27;s Donor Confidence Score fell from 97 to 73 on MinistryWatch, and the organization is no longer rated on Charity Navigator due to the lack of Accountability &amp; Finance beacon.

<doc id="93771" wikidata="Q2964544" url="?curid=93771" title="Morvan's syndrome">
<text>Morvan&#x27;s syndrome is a rare, life-threatening autoimmune disease named after the nineteenth century French physician Augustin Marie Morvan. &quot;La chorée fibrillaire&quot; was first coined by Morvan in 1890 when describing patients with multiple, irregular contractions of the long muscles, cramping, weakness, pruritus, hyperhidrosis, insomnia and delirium.
It normally presents with a slow insidious onset over months to years.
Approximately 90% of cases spontaneously go into remission, while the other 10% of cases lead to death.

In 1890, Morvan described a patient with myokymia (muscle twitching) associated with muscle pain, excessive sweating, and disordered sleep.
This rare disorder is characterized by severe insomnia, amounting to no less than complete lack of sleep (agrypnia) for weeks or months in a row, and associated with autonomic alterations consisting of profuse perspiration with characteristic skin miliaria (also known as sweat rash), tachycardia, increased body temperature, and hypertension. Patients display a remarkable hallucinatory behavior, and peculiar motor disturbances, which Morvan reported under the term “fibrillary chorea” but which are best described in modern terms as neuromyotonic discharges.

The association of the disease with thymoma, tumour, autoimmune diseases, and autoantibodies suggests an autoimmune or paraneoplastic aetiology. Besides an immune-mediated etiology, it is also believed to occur in gold, mercury, or manganese poisoning.

==Signs and symptoms==

In one of the few reported cases, the subject presented with muscle weakness and fatigue, muscle twitching, excessive sweating and salivation, small joint pain, itching and weight loss. The subject also developed confusional episodes with spatial and temporal disorientation, visual and auditory hallucinations, complex behavior during sleep and progressive nocturnal insomnia associated with diurnal drowsiness. There was also severe constipation, urinary incontinence, and excessive lacrimation. When left alone, the subject would slowly lapse into a stuporous state with dreamlike episodes characterized by complex and quasi-purposeful gestures and movements (enacted dreams). Marked hyperhidrosis and excessive salivation were evident. Neurological examination disclosed diffuse muscle twitching and spontaneous and reflex myoclonus, slight muscle atrophy in the limbs, absence of tendon reflexes in the lower limbs and diffuse erythema especially on the trunk with scratching lesions of the skin.
Compulsive behaviours, stereotypies and reduplicative paramnesias can be part of the CNS spectrum.

===Insomnia===
In all of the reported cases, the need for sleep was severely reduced and in some cases not necessary. The duration of sleep in one case decreased to about 2–4 hours per 24-hour period. Clinical features pertaining to insomnia include daytime drowsiness associated with a loss of ability to sleep, intermingled with confusional oneiric status, and the emergence of atypical REM sleep from wakefulness. The polysomnogram (PSG) picture of this disease is characterized by an inability to generate physiological sleep (key features are the suppression of the hallmarks of stage 2 non-REM sleep: spindles and K complexes) and by the emergence of REM sleep without atonia. The involvement of the thalamus and connected limbic structures in the pathology indicate the prominent role that the limbic thalamus plays in the pathophysiology of sleep. In a case documented in 1974, PSG findings documented the sustained absence of all sleep rhythms for up to a period of 4 months.

Electroencephalography (EEG) in one case was dominated by &quot;wakefulness&quot; and “subwakefulness” states alternating or intermingled with short (&lt; 1 min) atypical REM sleep phases, characterized by a loss of muscle atonia. The “subwakefulness” state was characterized by 4–6 Hz theta activity intermingled with fast activity and desynchronized lower voltage theta activity, behaviourally associated with sleep-like somatic and autonomic behavior. The subject was said to have “agrypnia excitata”, which consists of severe total insomnia of long duration associated with decreased vigilance, mental confusion, hallucinations, motor agitation, and complex motor behavior mimicking dreams, and autonomic activation. CNS and autonomic symptoms were caused by impaired corticolimbic control of the subcortical structures regulating the sleep-wake and autonomic functions.

===Neuromyotonia===
Neuromyotonia refers to muscle twitching and cramping at rest that is exacerbated with exercise. It is caused by sustained or repetitive spontaneous muscle activity of peripheral nerve origin. Myokymia, or spontaneous rippling and twitching movements of muscles, is a visible component of neuromyotonia. Electromyography (EMG) discloses spontaneous, repetitive motor unit or single fiber discharges firing in irregular rhythmic bursts at high intraburst frequencies. Some of the muscles exhibiting twitching include the bilateral gastrocnemii, quadriceps femoris, biceps brachii, and right masseter. In vivo electrophysiological studies suggest at least some dysfunction of the muscle cell membrane. In the examined muscles, no abnormal insertional activity or fibrillation potentials were noted. Nerve conduction studies were normal.

===Other symptoms===
Breathing difficulties can occur, resulting from neuromyotonic activity of the laryngeal muscles. Laryngeal spasm possibly resulting from neuromyotonia has been described previously, and this highlights that, in patients with unexplained laryngospasm, neuromytonia should be added to the list of differential diagnoses.

Studies have shown subtly decreased metabolism on positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in the left inferior frontal and left temporal lobes. and or basal ganglia hypermetabolism. Ancillary laboratory tests including MRI and brain biopsy have confirmed temporal lobe involvement. Cranial MRI shows increased signal in the hippocampus.

Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) shows normal protein, glucose, white blood cell, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, but there are weak oligoclonal bands, which are absent in the blood serum. Marked changes in circadian serum levels of neurohormones and increased levels of peripheral neurotransmitters were also observed. The absence of morphological alterations of the brain pathology, the suggestion of diffusion of IgG into the thalamus and striatum, more marked than in the cortex (consistent with effects on the thalamolimbic system) the oligoclonal bands in the CSF and the amelioration after PE all strongly support an antibody-mediated basis for the condition. Raised CSF IgG concentrations and oligoclonal bands have been reported in patients with psychosis. Anti-acetylcholine receptors (anti-AChR) antibodies have also been detected in patients with thymoma, but without clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis. There have also been reports of non-paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis associated with raised serum VGKC suggesting that these antibodies may give rise to a spectrum of neurological disease presenting with symptoms arising peripherally, centrally, or both. Yet, in two cases, oligoclonal bands were absent in the CSF and serum, and CSF immunoglobulin profiles were unremarkable.

===Comorbid conditions===
In one case, a patient was diagnosed with both Morvan&#x27;s syndrome and pulmonary hyalinizing granulomas (PHG). PHG are rare fibrosing lesions of the lung, which have central whorled deposits of lamellar collagen. How these two diseases relate to one another is still unclear.

Thymoma, prostate adenoma, and in situ carcinoma of the sigmoid colon have also been found in patients with Morvan&#x27;s Syndrome.

==Mechanism==
Antibodies against voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKC), which are detectable in about 40% of patients with acquired neuromytonia, have been implicated in Morvan&#x27;s pathophysiology. Raised serum levels of antibodies to VGKCs have been reported in three patients with Morvan&#x27;s Syndrome. Binding of serum from a patient with Morvan&#x27;s Syndrome to the hippocampus in a similar pattern of antibodies to known VGKC suggest that these antibodies can also cause CNS dysfunction. Additional antibodies against neuromuscular junction channels and receptors have also been described. Experimental evidence exists that these anti-VGKC antibodies cause nerve hyperexcitability by suppression of voltage gated K+ outward currents, whereas other, yet undefined humoral factors have been implicated in anti-VGKC antibody negative neuromyotonia. It is believed that antibodies to the Shaker-type K+ channels (the Kv1 family) are the type of potassium channel most strongly associated with acquired neuromyotonia and Morvan&#x27;s Syndrome.

Whether VGKC antibodies play a pathogenic role in the encephalopathy as they do in the peripheral nervous system is as yet unclear. It has been suggested that the VGKC antibodies may cross the blood–brain barrier and act centrally, binding predominantly to thalamic and striatal neurons causing encephalopathic and autonomic features.

==Differential diagnosis==
The symptoms of Morvan&#x27;s Syndrome have been noted to bear a striking similarity to limbic encephalitis (LE). These include the CNS symptoms consisting of insomnia, hallucinations, and disorientation, as well as dementia and psychosis. Both entities can be paraneoplastic and associated with thymoma. Recently, VGKC antibodies were found in patients with LE, strengthening the hypothesis that LE and Morvan&#x27;s Syndrome may be closely connected. Varying symptoms may be used to determine which of the two diseases the subject has. Amnesia, seizures, and mesial temporal lobe structural abnormalities are features of LE, whereas myokymia, hyperhydrosis, and insomnia favor Morvan&#x27;s Syndrome.

==Treatment==
In most of the reported cases, the treatment options were very similar. Plasmapheresis alone or in combination with steroids, sometimes also with thymectomy and azathioprine, have been the most frequently used therapeutic approach in treating Morvan&#x27;s Syndrome. However, this does not always work, as failed response to steroids and to subsequently added plasmapheresis have been reported. Intravenous immunoglobulin was effective in one case.

In one case, the dramatic response to high-dose oral prednisolone together with pulse methylprednisolone with almost complete disappearance of the symptoms within a short period should induce consideration of corticosteroids.

In another case, the subject was treated with haloperidol (6 mg/day) with some improvement in the psychomotor agitation and hallucinations, but even high doses of carbamazepine given to the subject failed to improve the spontaneous muscle activity. Plasma Exchange (PE) was initiated, and after the third such session, the itching, sweating, mental disturbances, and complex nocturnal behavior improved and these symptoms completely disappeared after the sixth session, with improvement in insomnia and reduced muscle twitching. However, one month after the sixth PE session, there was a progressive worsening of insomnia and diurnal drowsiness, which promptly disappeared after another two PE sessions.

In one case, high dose steroid treatment resulted in a transient improvement, but aggressive immuno-suppressive therapy with cyclophosphamide was necessary to control the disease and result in a dramatic clinical improvement.

In another case, the subject was treated with prednisolone (1 mg/kg body weight) with carbamazepine, propranolol, and amitriptyline. After two weeks, improvement with decreased stiffness and spontaneous muscle activity and improved sleep was observed. After another 7–10 days, the abnormal sleep behavior disappeared completely.

In another case, symptomatic improvement with plasmapheresis, thymectomy, and chronic immunosuppression provide further support for an autoimmune or paraneoplastic basis.

Although thymectomy is believed to be a key element in the proposed treatment, there is a reported case of Morvan&#x27;s Syndrome presenting itself post-thymectomy.

==Epidemiology==
There are only about 14 reported cases of Morvan&#x27;s syndrome in the English literature. With only a limited number of reported cases, the complete spectrum of the central nervous system (CNS) symptomatology has not been well established. The natural history of Morvan&#x27;s is highly variable. Two cases have been reported to remit spontaneously. Others have required a combination of plasmapheresis and long term immunosuppression, although in one of these cases the patient died shortly after receiving plasma exchange (PE). Other fatalities without remission have been described by, amongst others, Morvan himself.

<text>Martinus Bernardus &quot;Tinus&quot; Osendarp (; 21 May 1916 – 20 June 2002) was a Dutch sprint runner.

==Sporting career==
Osendarp was a football player and started training in sprint for fun. His first international success came at the 1934 European Championships where he won bronze medals in the 200 m and 4 × 100 m relay. Osendarp won the British AAA Championships title in the 220 yards event and finished second behind Arthur Sweeney in the 100 yards event at the 1935 AAA Championships. The following July he won the 100 yards event at the 1936 AAA Championships.

He won another two bronze medals at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, in the 100 m and 200 m sprint events. The games were held in Nazi Germany and Osendarp gained some fame as the fastest white sprinter behind the black Americans. A possible third medal was lost when Osendarp dropped the baton in the final of the 4 × 100 m relay while fighting for second place. Contested on the second day of the games, drenching rain made the track soggy and slow for the running of the 100 metre dash semi-finals. Despite the unfavorable conditions Osendarp still managed a time of 10.6 s, right behind American Ralph Metcalfe. In the 100 metres final he ran 10.5 s, behind Americans Jesse Owens 10.3 s, and Ralph Metcalfe 10.4 s. Upon his return home Osendarp was called &quot;the best white sprinter&quot; by the Dutch press.

The basis for his future involvement in National Socialism was laid in Berlin, where he first came under the influence of SS propaganda.

In 1938 Osendarp won two European titles in the 100 m and 200 m, equalling the 1934 performance of his compatriot Chris Berger. He also won anotehr British AAA title at the 1938 AAA Championships.

==Later life==
When Germany occupied the Netherlands in World War II, Osendarp, who was by then a Dutch police officer, became a member of the German Security Service. He later joined the Dutch national socialist NSB party and the SS. When the Wehrmacht marched into Holland in 1940 Osendarp became a member of the volunteer SS and an employee of the Nazi Security Police, helping in the deportation of Dutch Jews.

In 1948, Osendarp was sentenced to 12 years in jail for acts he committed during the war. He was released early in 1953 and moved to Limburg to work in the mines. In 1958 he also became athletics coach at Kimbria in Maastricht, and from 1972 he was a coach at Achilles-Top in Kerkrade. He died in 2002 at the age of 86 in Heerlen.

<doc id="93781" wikidata="Q253764" url="?curid=93781" title="Gates McFadden">
<text>Cheryl Gates McFadden (born March 2, 1949) is an American actress and choreographer. She is usually credited as Cheryl McFadden when working as a choreographer and Gates McFadden when working as an actress. She played Dr. Beverly Crusher in the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, its four subsequent films, the sequel series &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot;.

==Early life==

McFadden was born in Akron, Ohio, and grew up in the nearby suburb of Silver Lake. She graduated high school from Old Trail School in 1966. She attended Brandeis University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (&quot;cum laude&quot;) in the theatre arts, before moving to Paris, where she studied theatre with actor Jacques Lecoq at his school of physical theatre. McFadden is of Lithuanian descent on her mother&#x27;s side.

==Career==
===Early work===

In the 1970s, McFadden spent time teaching in post-secondary theater and dance departments, including those of the University of Pittsburgh, Harvard University, and George Washington University. During this period she formed a theatrical company, The New York Theatre Commotion, and in 1975 toured an all-female clown act, &quot;Commedia Dell Pinky&quot;.

McFadden worked at The Jim Henson Company as the director of choreography and puppet movement for &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;, and uncredited work on &quot;Dreamchild&quot;. As a way of distinguishing her acting work from her choreography, she is usually credited as &quot;Gates McFadden&quot; as an actress and &quot;Cheryl McFadden&quot; as a choreographer. However, she was credited as &quot;Cheryl McFadden&quot; in the Troma movie &quot;When Nature Calls&quot; (1985) and in the season-three episode of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, &quot;Cliff&#x27;s 50th Birthday&quot;.

===&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;===
====Season 1====
In 1987, McFadden was cast as Dr. Beverly Crusher on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. The Crusher character was slated to be Captain Jean-Luc Picard&#x27;s love interest; another important aspect of the character was being a widow balancing motherhood and a career. McFadden clashed with Maurice Hurley, head writer and showrunner, about the characterization of Dr. Crusher; she later stated, &quot;I definitely pissed off Hurley. Because I kept saying &#x27;Why is it that I&#x27;ve raised this genius kid...and yet every time there&#x27;s anything serious it&#x27;s only the male characters who talk to him?&#x27;&quot; She was also highly critical of the episode &quot;Angel One&quot;, labeling it sexist. At Hurley&#x27;s demand, McFadden&#x27;s contract was not renewed at the end of the season. In her place, Diana Muldaur joined the production as the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s new chief medical officer, Dr. Katherine Pulaski, for the second season.

====Seasons 3–7====

Series creator Gene Roddenberry admitted that the Dr. Pulaski character did not develop a chemistry with the other characters, so McFadden was approached to return as Dr. Crusher for the third season. She was hesitant, but after a phone call from co-star Patrick Stewart, and numerous fan letters, McFadden was persuaded to return to the role, which she then played through the remainder of the series.

Highlights for her character included &quot;The High Ground&quot;, where she is kidnapped by terrorists; &quot;Remember Me&quot;, where she becomes trapped in a warp bubble created by her son, Wesley, plunging her into an alternate reality where everyone begins to vanish; &quot;The Host&quot;, which features a romance between the doctor and an alien composed of two symbiotic organisms; &quot;Suspicions&quot;, in which she risks her career to solve the murder of a scientist; &quot;Descent&quot; where Crusher takes command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;; &quot;Sub Rosa&quot;, where she becomes the victim of a seductive &quot;ghost&quot;; and &quot;Attached&quot;, where Picard and Crusher become telepathically linked as prisoners and learn their true feelings for one another.

McFadden reprised her role for all four &quot;TNG&quot; movies and also provided her voice for PC games &quot;Star Trek: A Final Unity&quot; and &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;. McFadden directed the seventh season episode &quot;Genesis&quot; (her only directing credit) in which an infection causes the crew to de-evolve into primitive forms of life, and choreographed the dance routine in the fourth season&#x27;s &quot;Data&#x27;s Day&quot;.

===After &quot;The Next Generation&quot;===

McFadden co-starred in the 1990 comedy &quot;Taking Care of Business&quot; with James Belushi, and fellow &quot;Next Generation&quot; alumnus John de Lancie (Q). That same year she appeared in &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; as Jack Ryan&#x27;s wife, Catherine. In 1992, she appeared alongside fellow cast members Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, and Colm Meaney in a production of &quot;Every Good Boy Deserves Favour&quot;, which was performed in four cities. She also starred in the 1995 television series &quot;Marker&quot; with Richard Grieco and appeared in the made-for-television movie &quot;Crowned and Dangerous&quot; with Yasmine Bleeth in 1997. Additional television work was the role of Allison Rourke, Paul Buchman&#x27;s boss, in four episodes of the sitcom &quot;Mad About You&quot;. In the spring of 2006, McFadden appeared in a series of television commercials for Microsoft.
She has taught at several universities (American Academy of Dramatic Arts, Brandeis, Harvard, Purdue, Temple, the Stella Academy in Hamburg, and the University of Pittsburgh). As of August 2010, she was listed as an adjunct faculty member in the School of Theater at the University of Southern California. She was the artistic director of the Ensemble Studio Theatre/Los Angeles from January 2009 to October 2014. During her tenure, she spearheaded the building of the Atwater Village Theatre Collective, a new two-theater space in Los Angeles.

McFadden has lent her voice as narrator in several audio books. In 2010, she was the narrator of &quot;Confessor&quot; (&quot;METAtropolis: Cascadia&quot;).

McFadden was initially nervous to attend fan conventions, due to a stalking issue early in her teaching career prior to her Star Trek tenure. However her concerns have not come to pass and she has since found conventions to be a positive experience.

McFadden narrated the multi-part documentary series &quot;The Center Seat: 55 Years of Star Trek&quot;, which aired on the cable channel History in 2021. She was also one of the executive producers.

In 2021 McFadden launched &quot;Gates McFadden InvestiGates: Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, a podcast for Brian Volk-Weiss&#x27;s Nacelle Company, interviewing close friends and former co-stars.

She has since reprised the role of Crusher on &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;&#x27;s third season as well as in the video game &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;.

==Personal life==
McFadden became a mother in 1991. Her pregnancy was not written into the fourth season of &quot;TNG&quot;; instead, her character wore a laboratory coat over her uniform to conceal it. &quot;Next Generation&quot; co-star Brent Spiner is her son&#x27;s godfather.

<text>Arvo Pärt (; born 11 September 1935) is an Estonian composer of contemporary classical music. Since the late 1970s, Pärt has worked in a minimalist style that employs tintinnabuli, a compositional technique he invented. Pärt&#x27;s music is in part inspired by Gregorian chant. His most performed works include &quot;Fratres&quot; (1977), &quot;Spiegel im Spiegel&quot; (1978), and &quot;Für Alina&quot; (1976). From 2011 to 2018, and again in 2022, Pärt was the most performed living composer in the world, and the second most performed in 2019, after John Williams. The Arvo Pärt Centre, in Laulasmaa, was opened to the public in 2018.

== Early life, family and education ==
Pärt was born in Paide, Järva County, Estonia, and was raised by his mother and stepfather in Rakvere in northern Estonia. He began to experiment with the top and bottom notes of the family&#x27;s piano as the middle register was damaged.

Pärt&#x27;s musical education began at the age of seven when he began attending music school in Rakvere. By his early teenage years, Pärt was writing his own compositions. His first serious study came in 1954 at the Tallinn Music Middle School, but less than a year later he temporarily abandoned it to fulfill military service, playing oboe and percussion in the army band. After his military service he attended the Tallinn Conservatory, where he studied composition with Heino Eller and it was said of him, &quot;he just seemed to shake his sleeves and the notes would fall out&quot;. During the 1950s, he also completed his first vocal composition, the cantata &quot;Meie aed&quot; (&#x27;Our Garden&#x27;) for children&#x27;s choir and orchestra. He graduated in 1963.

==Career==
As a student, Pärt composed music for film and the stage, creating scores for over fifty movies. Although filmmaking and film music were not primary sources of inspiration for him, these compositions provided a medium for exploring serial and tonal techniques—an amalgamation that would later influence his collage works of the 1960s. From 1957 to 1967, he worked as a sound producer for the Estonian public radio broadcaster Eesti Rahvusringhääling.

Tikhon Khrennikov criticized Pärt in 1962 for employing serialism in &quot;Nekrolog&quot; (1960), the first 12-tone music written in Estonia, which exhibited his &quot;susceptibility to foreign influences&quot;. But nine months later Pärt won First Prize in a competition of 1,200 works, awarded by the all-&quot;Union Society of Composers&quot;, indicating the Soviet regime&#x27;s inability to agree on what was permissible. His first overtly sacred piece, &quot;Credo&quot; (1968), was a turning point in his career and life; on a personal level he had reached a creative crisis that led him to renounce the techniques and means of expression used so far; on a social level the religious nature of this piece resulted in him being unofficially censured and his music disappearing from concert halls. For the next eight years he composed very little, focusing instead on study of medieval and Renaissance music to find his new musical language. In 1972 he converted from Lutheranism to Orthodox Christianity.

Pärt reemerged as a composer in 1976 with music in his new compositional style and technique, tintinnabuli.

On 10 December 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Pärt a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture for a five-year renewable term.

In 2014 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described Pärt as possibly &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest living composer&quot; and &quot;by a long way, Estonia&#x27;s most celebrated export&quot;. When asked how Estonian he felt his music to be, Pärt replied: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what is Estonian... I don&#x27;t think about these things.&quot; Unlike many of his fellow Estonian composers, Pärt never found inspiration in the country&#x27;s epic poem, &quot;Kalevipoeg&quot;, even in his early works. Pärt said, &quot;My &quot;Kalevipoeg&quot; is Jesus Christ.&quot;

==Music==
===Overview===
Familiar works by Pärt are &quot;Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten&quot; for string orchestra and bell (1977) and the string quintet &quot;Fratres I&quot; (1977, revised 1983), which he transcribed for string orchestra and percussion, the solo violin &quot;Fratres II&quot; and the cello ensemble &quot;Fratres III&quot; (both 1980).

Pärt is often identified with the school of minimalism and, more specifically, that of mystic minimalism or holy minimalism. He is considered a pioneer of the latter style, along with contemporaries Henryk Górecki and John Tavener. Although his fame initially rested on instrumental works such as &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot; and &quot;Spiegel im Spiegel&quot;, his choral works have also come to be widely appreciated.

In this period of Estonian history, Pärt was unable to encounter many musical influences from outside the Soviet Union except for a few illegal tapes and scores. Although Estonia had been an independent state at the time of Pärt&#x27;s birth, the Soviet Union occupied it in 1940 as a result of the Soviet–Nazi Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact; and the country would then remain under Soviet domination—except for the three-year period of German wartime occupation—for the next 51 years.

===Development===

Pärt&#x27;s works are generally divided into two periods. He composed his early works using a range of neo-classical styles influenced by Shostakovich, Prokofiev, and Bartók. He then began to compose using Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone technique and serialism. This, however, not only earned the ire of the Soviet establishment but also proved to be a creative dead-end. When Soviet censors banned early works, Pärt entered the first of several periods of contemplative silence, during which he studied choral music from the 14th to 16th centuries. In this context, Pärt&#x27;s biographer, Paul Hillier, observed that &quot;he had reached a position of complete despair in which the composition of music appeared to be the most futile of gestures, and he lacked the musical faith and willpower to write even a single note.&quot;

In his work &quot;Credo&quot; (1968), written for solo piano, orchestra, and chorus, he employed avant-garde techniques. This work differed in its forms and context from his earlier atonal and tintinnabula works. Inspired by 14th and 16th century liturgical music, he used a poly-stylistic compositional technique to express his faith in God while incorporating avant-garde techniques of the 20th century. By definition, a credo expresses beliefs and guides religious action, and in his work it represents his faith in God. The Soviets eventually banned the work due to its clear religious context, even though it incorporated avant-garde and a constructivist procedure.

The spirit of early European polyphony informed the composition of Pärt&#x27;s transitional Third Symphony (1971); after that, he immersed himself in early music, reinvestigating the roots of Western music. He studied plainsong, Gregorian chant, and the emergence of polyphony in the European Renaissance.

The music that began to emerge after this period was radically different. This period of new compositions included the 1977 works &quot;Fratres&quot;, &quot;Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten&quot; and &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;. Pärt describes the music of this period as &quot;tintinnabuli&quot;—like the ringing of bells. &quot;Spiegel im Spiegel&quot; (1978) is a well-known example used in many films. The music is characterised by simple harmonies, often single unadorned notes, or triads, which form the basis of Western harmony. These are reminiscent of ringing bells. Tintinnabuli works are rhythmically simple and do not change tempo. In this technique, each syllable of a word is assigned to a pitch and a duration. Once two or three words have been connected, a phrase has been made. Another characteristic of Pärt&#x27;s later works is that they are frequently settings for sacred texts, although he mostly chooses Latin or the Church Slavonic language used in Orthodox liturgy instead of his native Estonian language. Large-scale works inspired by religious texts include &quot;Berliner Messe&quot;, &quot;St. John Passion&quot; and &quot;Te Deum&quot;; the author of the famous text of &quot;Litany&quot; is the 4th-century theologian John Chrysostom. Choral works from this period include &quot;Magnificat&quot; and &quot;The Beatitudes&quot;.

== Reception and later compositions ==

Pärt was the most performed living composer in the world from 2011 to 2018, but then the second-most performed composer, after John Williams. In 2022, Arvo was back to the top in Bachtrack. Of Pärt&#x27;s popularity, Steve Reich has written:

Pärt&#x27;s music came to public attention in the West largely thanks to Manfred Eicher who recorded several of Pärt&#x27;s compositions for ECM Records starting in 1984. Pärt wrote &quot;Cecilia, vergine romana&quot; on an Italian text about life and martyrdom of Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of music, for choir and orchestra on a commission for the Great Jubilee in Rome, where it was performed, close to her feast day on 22 November, by the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia conducted by Myung-whun Chung.

Invited by Walter Fink, Pärt was the 15th composer featured in the annual Komponistenporträt of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 2005 in four concerts. Chamber music included &quot;Für Alina&quot; for piano, played by himself, &quot;Spiegel im Spiegel&quot; and &quot;Psalom&quot; for string quartet. The chamber orchestra of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra played his &quot;Trisagion&quot;, &quot;Fratres&quot; and &quot;Cantus&quot; along with works of J.S. Bach. The Windsbach Boys Choir and soloists Sibylla Rubens, Ingeborg Danz, Markus Schäfer and Klaus Mertens performed &quot;Magnificat&quot; and &quot;Collage über B-A-C-H&quot; together with two Bach cantatas and one by Mendelssohn. The Hilliard Ensemble, organist Christopher Bowers-Broadbent, the Rostock Motet Choir and the Hilliard instrumental ensemble, conducted by , performed a program of Pärt&#x27;s organ music and works for voices (some &quot;a cappella&quot;), including &quot;Pari intervallo&quot;, De profundis, and Miserere.

A composition, &quot;Für Lennart&quot;, written for the memory of the Estonian President, Lennart Meri, was played at Meri&#x27;s funeral service on 26 March 2006.
In response to the murder of the Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya in Moscow on 7 October 2006, Pärt declared that all of his works performed in 2006 and 2007 would be in honour of her death, issuing the following statement: &quot;Anna Politkovskaya staked her entire talent, energy and—in the end—even her life on saving people who had become victims of the abuses prevailing in Russia.&quot;

Pärt was honoured as the featured composer of the 2008 Raidió Teilifís Éireann Living Music Festival in Dublin, Ireland. He was also commissioned by Louth Contemporary Music Society to compose a new choral work based on &quot;Saint Patrick&#x27;s Breastplate&quot;, which premiered in 2008 in Louth, Ireland. The new work, &quot;The Deer&#x27;s Cry&quot;, is his first Irish commission, and received its debut in Drogheda and Dundalk in February 2008.

Pärt&#x27;s 2008 Fourth Symphony is named &quot;Los Angeles&quot; and was dedicated to Mikhail Khodorkovsky. It was Pärt&#x27;s first symphony written since his Third Symphony of 1971. It premiered in Los Angeles, California, at the Walt Disney Concert Hall on 10 January 2009, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition in 2010.

On 26 January 2014, Tõnu Kaljuste, conducting the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir, the Sinfonietta Riga, the Tallinn Chamber Orchestra, the Latvian Radio Choir and the Vox Clamantis ensemble, won a Grammy for Best Choral Performance for a performance of Pärt&#x27;s &quot;Adam&#x27;s Lament&quot;. Describing aspects of Pärt&#x27;s music as &quot;glocal&quot; in approach, Estonian musicologist Kerri Kotta noted that the composer &quot;has been able to translate something very human into sound that crosses the borders normally separating people.&quot;

==Personal life==
He converted to Orthodox Christianity in 1972 upon marrying his second wife, Nora.

In 1980, after a prolonged struggle with Soviet officials, he was allowed to emigrate with his wife and their two sons. He lived first in Vienna, where he took Austrian citizenship, and then relocated to Berlin in 1981. He returned to Estonia around the turn of the 21st century and for a while lived alternately in Berlin and Tallinn. He now resides in Laulasmaa, about from Tallinn. He speaks fluent German as a result of living in Germany from 1981.

In 2010, the Pärt family established the Arvo Pärt Centre, an institution responsible for maintaining his personal archive, in the village of Laulasmaa. A new building of the centre opened to the visitors on 17 October 2018, containing a concert hall, a library, and research facilities. The centre also offers educational programmes for children and operates as an international information centre on Pärt&#x27;s life and work.

In April 2020, although Pärt rarely gives interviews, he spoke to the Spanish newspaper &quot;ABC&quot; about the COVID-19 pandemic, stating that it was a &quot;mega fast&quot; and reminded him to follow the example of John Updike, who &quot;once said that he tried to work with the same calm as the masters of the Middle Ages, who carved the church pews in places where it was impossible to see them&quot;.

<text>Brent Jay Spiner (; born February 2, 1949) is an American actor best known for his role as the android Data on the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (19871994), four subsequent films (19942002), and &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; (20202023). In 1997, he won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Data in &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, and was nominated in the same category for portraying Dr. Brackish Okun in &quot;Independence Day&quot;, a role he reprised in &quot;Independence Day: Resurgence&quot;. Spiner has also enjoyed a career in the theater and as a musician. He is also known for voicing The Joker in the animated series &quot;Young Justice&quot; (20112022).

== Early life ==
Brent Jay Spiner was born on February 2, 1949, in Houston, Texas, to Jewish parents Sylvia (&quot;née&quot; Schwartz) and Jack Spiner, who owned a furniture store. When Spiner was ten months old, Jack Spiner died of kidney failure at age 29. Subsequently, he was adopted by his mother&#x27;s second husband, Sol Mintz, whose surname he used between 1955 and 1975.

Spiner attended Bellaire High School in Bellaire, Texas. He became active on the Bellaire speech team, winning the national championship in dramatic interpretation. He attended the University of Houston, where he performed in local theater. In 1968, he worked as a performer at Six Flags Astroworld, first as a gunfighter, then in Dr. Featherflowers&#x27; Medicine Show with his friend Trey Wilson, with whom he alternated as Dr. Featherflowers. Spiner also performed the role in the 1968 TV special &quot;The Pied Piper of Astroworld&quot;.

== Career ==
=== Early work ===
Spiner moved to New York City in the early 1970s, where he became a stage actor, performing in several Broadway and off-Broadway plays, including &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot;. As Brent Mintz, he appeared as an imposter on a 1972 episode of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. He had a brief non-speaking role in the film &quot;Stardust Memories&quot;, credited as Fan in Lobby, the one with a Polaroid. He can also be seen as a passenger on the train full of misfits that the Allen character is trapped on in one of the films-within-the-film.

Spiner appeared as a media technician in &quot;The Advocates&quot;, a second-season episode of the Showtime cable series &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;. In 1984, he moved to Los Angeles, where he appeared in several pilots and television films. He played a recurring character on &quot;Night Court&quot;, Bob Wheeler, patriarch of a rural family. In 1986, he played a condemned soul in &quot;Dead Run&quot;, an episode of the revival of Rod Serling&#x27;s series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; on CBS. He made two appearances in season three (1986) of the situation comedy &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, as two different characters. His first and only starring film role was in &quot;Rent Control&quot; (1984). In the &quot;Cheers&quot; episode &quot;Never Love a Goalie, Part II&quot;, he played acquitted murder suspect Bill Grand. He also appeared in the &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot; episode &quot;A Case of the Stubborns&quot; as a preacher, and portrayed Jim Stevens in the television film &quot;Manhunt for Claude Dallas&quot;.

Spiner guest-starred in &quot;Friends&quot; as James Campbell, a man who interviews Rachel Green for Gucci.

=== &quot;Star Trek&quot; ===
In 1987, Spiner was cast as android Starfleet officer Lieutenant Commander Data on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, which spanned seven seasons and four feature films. He appeared as Data in all but one of the series&#x27; 178 episodes, and reprised his role in the spin-off films &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; (1994), &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; (1996), &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; (1998), and &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; (2002). Although billed as the final &quot;Trek&quot; film for the &quot;TNG&quot; cast, the ambiguous ending of &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; suggested a possible avenue for the return of Data. However, Spiner felt he was too old to continue playing the part, as Data does not age. He also played Lore, Data&#x27;s evil android brother, in several &quot;Next Generation&quot; episodes; and B-4, another brother android with a less developed mind, in &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; (2002).

In 2004, Spiner returned to &quot;Star Trek&quot; as Dr. Arik Soong, an ancestor of Data&#x27;s creator Dr. Noonien Soong, whom he also played in a three-episode story arc of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;: &quot;Borderland&quot;, &quot;Cold Station 12&quot;, and &quot;The Augments&quot;.

Spiner also recorded dialogue as Data that was heard in the final episode of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, &quot;These Are the Voyages...&quot;, which aired in 2005.

Eighteen years after last appearing as Data, he reprised the role in the 2020 &quot;Star Trek&quot; series &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; as well as that of Dr. Altan Inigo Soong, the son of Data&#x27;s creator. Spiner said that he does not intend to play Data again, though he might be open to playing Altan Soong. In Season 2, he plays another of Noonien Soong&#x27;s ancestors, Dr. Adam Soong. In Season 3 of &quot;Picard&quot;, he simultaneously played Noonien Soong, B4, Lore, and a version of Data that was designed to feel emotions and naturally use verbal contractions, which the original Data could not do.

In addition to the series and films, Spiner voiced his character in several &quot;Star Trek&quot; video games, including &quot;Star Trek: Generations&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation – A Final Unity&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Hidden Evil&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Away Team&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: Bridge Commander&quot;.

=== Music and stage ===
In 1991, Spiner recorded an album of 1940s pop standards, &quot;Ol&#x27; Yellow Eyes Is Back,&quot; the title of which was a play on the yellow contact lenses Spiner wore as Data, and the title of a Frank Sinatra record, &quot;Ol&#x27; Blue Eyes Is Back&quot;. In 1997, he returned to Broadway as John Adams in the Roundabout Theater Company revival of the musical &quot;1776,&quot; whose production was nominated for a Tony Award. A cast recording was released.

=== After &quot;Star Trek&quot; ===
Spiner has appeared in many television series, including &quot;Deadly Games&quot;, &quot;The Blacklist&quot;, &quot;Dream On&quot;, &quot;Gargoyles&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, &quot;Mad About You&quot; and &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. In the series &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; and &quot;Joey&quot;, he appeared as himself. He has acted in the films &quot;The Aviator&quot;; &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Car?&quot;; &quot;I Am Sam&quot;; &quot;Independence Day&quot;; &quot;Independence Day: Resurgence&quot;; &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot;; &quot;Out to Sea&quot;; &quot;Phenomenon&quot;; &quot;The Ponder Heart&quot;; and &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut&quot;. His television-film appearances during this period include the 2000 musical &quot;Geppetto&quot; and the role of Dorothy Dandridge&#x27;s manager and confidant, Earl Mills, in the HBO production &quot;Introducing Dorothy Dandridge&quot;.

In 2005, Spiner appeared in a short-lived science-fiction television series &quot;Threshold&quot;, which was canceled in November of that year after 13 episodes. In 2006, he appeared in a feature film comedy, &quot;Material Girls&quot;, with Hilary and Haylie Duff.

In the &quot;Frasier&quot; episode &quot;Lilith Needs a Favor&quot;, Spiner made two brief cameos as a fellow airline passenger with Frasier Crane&#x27;s ex-wife, Lilith Sternin.

In March 2008, Spiner performed alongside Maude Maggart in a radio show/musical, &quot;Dreamland&quot;, which was released as a CD album.

In 2008, Spiner played Dr. Strom in the feature film parody &quot;Superhero Movie&quot;. In February 2009, he played William Quint in &quot;The Juror #6 Job&quot;, an episode of the drama series &quot;Leverage&quot; directed by his &quot;Next Generation&quot; co-star Jonathan Frakes. That same year, he voiced himself in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Not All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot;.
On January 13, 2010, Spiner and fellow &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; actor LeVar Burton appeared on TWiT.tv&#x27;s coverage of the Consumer Electronics Show.

In April 2011, Spiner began starring in &quot;Fresh Hell&quot;, a comic webseries in which he plays a version of himself, attempting to put his career back together after falling out of the limelight.

Spiner appeared as Dr. Kern in the September 12, 2011, episode of the Syfy channel program &quot;Alphas&quot; entitled &quot;Blind Spot&quot;. In October 2011, he appeared as himself in the episode &quot;The Russian Rocket Reaction&quot; of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. The day after his guest appearance, it was announced that Spiner would guest-star in the &quot;Young Justice&quot; episode &quot;Revelation&quot;, providing the voice of the Joker. Spiner has also guest-starred on the Syfy program &quot;Warehouse 13&quot; as Brother Adrian in the third and fourth seasons.

In March 2024, Spiner reprised his role of the eternally downtrodden Bob Wheeler, in the 11th episode of the second season of &quot;Night Court.&quot;

== Book ==
In October 2021, Spiner released &quot;Fan Fiction: A Mem-Noir: Inspired by True Events&quot;, a mixture of memoir (taking place during the filming of the fourth season of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;) and a fictitious noir detective story about Spiner dealing with a crazed, murderous fan who claims to be the fictitious Lal, the android daughter of Data in the third-season TNG episode &quot;The Offspring&quot;. The audiobook version, primarily narrated by Spiner, featured vocal cameos from Spiner&#x27;s TNG co-stars, Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Michael Dorn, LeVar Burton, Marina Sirtis, and Gates McFadden.

<doc id="93787" wikidata="Q3814867" url="?curid=93787" title="Kevyn Aucoin">
<text>Kevyn James Aucoin (; February 14, 1962 – May 7, 2002) was an American make-up artist, photographer and author. He authored several books with makeup techniques including facial contouring, which was relatively unknown in popular culture at the time, but pioneered and used in drag culture and stage makeup for decades prior.

==Early life==
Aucoin was born in Shreveport, Louisiana and grew up in Lafayette, Louisiana. Born to a teenage single mother, he was adopted as an infant by Isidore Adrian Aucoin and Thelma (née Melancon) Aucoin. His three siblings, Carla, Kim, and Keith, were adopted as well.

Aucoin was interested in makeup from the time he was a child, and frequently did his sisters&#x27; makeup and photographed the results with a Polaroid camera—something he&#x27;d do throughout his career. Afraid to buy makeup, he would shoplift it. The guilt of stealing and fear of getting caught made him stop.

He realized he was gay at age six. His parents were unaware of their son&#x27;s sexual orientation; his mother later said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think Kevyn was a sissy; I just thought he was a gentle child.&quot; Years later, his parents became staunch advocates for LBGTQ rights, and started a chapter of P-FLAG in Lafayette.

Aucoin was relentlessly bullied in school. In one instance, a teacher spanked his bare buttocks in class, which Aucoin later regarded as sexual abuse. The bullying escalated in high school. When he was chased by some classmates in a truck, he dropped out. He then enrolled in cosmetology school to take a makeup class. Instead, his self-taught skills resulted in his becoming the instructor at age 18.

Aucoin then worked in a small corner of an exclusive women&#x27;s store in Lafayette. But women were uncomfortable with a man doing their makeup. His mother Thelma recalled, &quot;It was $30 for a makeup lesson, and these were women who paid $3,000 for a dress, but they&#x27;d never let him.&quot;

In 1982, Aucoin moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, thinking a larger city could help build his career as a makeup artist. He soon experienced the homophobia he&#x27;d endured in Lafayette. Kevyn and two male friends went to Godchaux&#x27;s, a local department store, to browse the newest makeup. A security guard approached them and said &quot;upstairs or downtown&quot;—meaning they could be taken to the store&#x27;s security office or be arrested. All three men opted for the security office, where they were beaten by security personnel. Fearing for his life if he stayed in Louisiana, he moved to New York City with his then-boyfriend Jed Root, who sometimes posed as his manager.

==Career==
The first year he was in New York, Aucoin did makeup on test models for free to build up his portfolio. He and Root were broke, living in an apartment that often had no heat. Word of his makeup skills began circulating, and he was contacted by &quot;Vogue&quot;. For the next year and a half, he worked daily with Vogue photographer Steven Meisel. In the three years following his first &quot;Vogue&quot; shoot, he did a total of 18 more. In 1984, he collaborated on Revlon&#x27;s Nakeds line, the first line based solely on skin tones. However, his &quot;Vogue&quot; cover shoot with emerging supermodel Cindy Crawford in 1986 skyrocketed his career. During 1987–89, he did nine &quot;Vogue&quot; covers in a row, and an additional seven &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; covers. He became one of the best-paid celebrity makeup artists in history. Unlike most makeup artists at the time, he would refuse to do makeup on models he felt were too young.

Aucoin&#x27;s philosophy was that every woman is beautiful within, and makeup was simply his tool for helping her discover that beauty. He wrote a regular column about this philosophy for &quot;Allure.&quot; A comment he made in a 2000 column, calling members of the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) &quot;morons&quot;, drew a record amount of mail and a few death threats.

In 1983, Revlon hired Aucoin, at the age of 21, as Creative Director for their prestige Ultima II line of cosmetics. A year later, Aucoin would launch &quot;The New Nakeds&quot; (later renamed &quot;The Nakeds&quot;), a cosmetics line that was a strong counterpoint to those available at the time. Linda Wells, editor of &quot;Allure&quot; magazine, said of the line: &quot;It may not seem like it, but it was a powerful moment. Before, there were makeup lines for white women and others for black women. But he worked to design makeup for all skin tones. The idea was to empower a woman by revealing her natural beauty, and not to cover her up with layers of product.&quot;

The New Nakeds embraced a radically different aesthetic than the norm of the time: foundations that featured a yellow undertone, instead of pink or peach; eyeshadows, lipstick and blushes were brown-based, neutral tones that were free of the pastel, vivid, or sparkly colors. Although Ultima II (and all of Revlon&#x27;s beauty divisions) were in a decline at the time, the New Nakeds resuscitated interest in the brand and helped re-establish Ultima II as a viable competitor in the prestige arena.

The colors, textures and finishes Aucoin created in the New Nakeds would serve as the most influential direction of the latter part of the century, and visible as brands MAC, Bobbi Brown, and Laura Mercier all launched with their version of the products Aucoin created years earlier.

===Inoui cosmetics===
Later, Aucoin would work with Japanese cosmetics giant Shiseido on their Inoui line.

==Celebrity work, writing, and appearances==
Aucoin worked with hundreds of celebrities, including Madonna, Whitney Houston, Cher, Tori Amos, Jewel, Julianne Moore, Sharon Stone, Brooke Shields, Christina Ricci, Isabella Rossellini, Winona Ryder, Demi Moore, Kim Basinger, Liza Minnelli, Janet Jackson Tina Turner, Gwyneth Paltrow, Lisa Marie Presley, Courtney Love, and Vanessa L. Williams.

He began publishing his creations in books: &quot;The Art of Makeup&quot;, &quot;Making Faces&quot;, and &quot;Face Forward&quot;, two of which became &quot;Time&quot; magazine best sellers; &quot;Making Faces&quot; debuted at number one. &quot;Face Forward&quot; was widely noted for introducing makeup sculpting and contouring to the general public for the first time.

In 1999 he received an honorary diploma from Harvey Milk High School for his support of gay and transgender youth.

== Personal life ==
Aucoin eventually found his birth parents, and was able to personally meet them and his half-siblings.

He was in a long-term relationship with Eric Sakas, who remained a close friend after their breakup. Sakas later became president and creative director of Kevyn Aucoin Beauty.

Aucoin began dating Jeremy Antunes in 1999. They married in Hawaii in 2000, in an unofficial ceremony since same-sex marriage was not legally recognized at the time. Aucoin&#x27;s 15-year-old niece, Samantha, lived with them after Aucoin obtained legal guardianship.

==Death==
In September 2001, after increasing amounts of back pain and headaches, Aucoin was diagnosed with a rare pituitary tumor. He had been suffering from acromegaly resulting from the tumor for much of his life, but it had gone undiagnosed. He underwent a successful surgery and had the tumor removed, but continued to experience pain.

Aucoin began taking increasing amounts of prescription and non-prescription painkillers to ease his physical and mental suffering. Antunes implored Aucoin to get help, and Aucoin made many attempts to recover, but could not stop the drug use entirely. Antunes went to Paris for a week to be alone. That same week, Aucoin&#x27;s health rapidly declined and he was hospitalized. Antunes&#x27; leaving Aucoin for what became the last week of his life created animosity between Aucoin&#x27;s family and Antunes, resulting in Antunes being locked out of the home he shared with Aucoin.

Aucoin died on May 7, 2002, at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla, New York of kidney and liver failure due to acetaminophen toxicity, caused by prescription painkillers. His mother Thelma died soon afterwards in October 2002, ostensibly from grief. Despite his instructions that his ashes be scattered in Hawaii, at the site where he and Antunes married, Aucoin&#x27;s ashes are interred with his mother in Louisiana. The Kevyn Aucoin Beauty brand has remained in business since his death.

==Posthumous media ==
&quot;Kevyn Aucoin: A Beautiful Life—The Success, Struggles, and Beauty Secrets of a Legendary Makeup Artist&quot; was published in 2003 by Atria Books and Simon and Schuster. The book was edited by Kerry Diamond and reviewed Aucoin&#x27;s career through celebrity interviews, his beauty tips and techniques, and over 250 photographs.

&quot;Kevyn Aucoin: Beauty &amp; The Beast In Me&quot;, a documentary directed by Lori Kaye, features Aucoin&#x27;s own personal videos taken throughout his life. It premiered as the documentary centerpiece at Outfest in July 2017 and had its TV debut on Logo TV on September 14, 2017. The film was also featured in the 125th anniversary (September 2017) issue of Vogue Magazine.

&quot;Larger Than Life: The Kevyn Aucoin Story&quot; is feature-length documentary directed by Tiffany Bartok.&quot;&quot; The film focuses on the rise his career and the legacy he left behind. The film also highlights Aucoin&#x27;s LGBTQ activism, from his struggle to live openly as a young gay man in his hometown, to marrying his partner and creating a family of his own. It also addresses the issues behind Aucoin&#x27;s untimely death. It premiered at the 25th Hamptons International Film Festival in October 2017, and its New York City premiere was featured in Doc NYC in November 2017. Aucoin&#x27;s former partner, Eric Sakas, is an associate producer of the film.

==In popular culture==
The Tori Amos song &quot;Taxi Ride&quot; from her 2002 album &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; is a partial homage to Aucoin. He made a cameo appearance in a fourth season episode (Episode 2: &quot;The Real Me&quot;) of the long-running HBO series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. He was a major fan of the Comedy Central show &quot;Strangers With Candy&quot; and appeared in an episode alongside Amy Sedaris and Stephen Colbert as a funeral makeup artist (Season 2, Episode 4: The Goodbye Guy). In the show &quot;Fat Actress&quot; debut episode &quot;Big Butts&quot;, Kirstie Alley&#x27;s female hair and makeup artist goes by the name Kevyn after her inspiration Kevyn Aucoin.

<text>William Joseph Martin (born May 25, 1967), formerly Poppy Z. Brite, is an American author. He initially achieved fame in the gothic horror genre of literature in the early 1990s by publishing a string of successful novels and short story collections. He is best known for his novels &quot;Lost Souls&quot; (1992), &quot;Drawing Blood&quot; (1993), and &quot;Exquisite Corpse&quot; (1996). His later work moved into the genre of dark comedy, with many stories set in the New Orleans restaurant world. Martin&#x27;s novels are typically standalone books but may feature recurring characters from previous novels and short stories. Much of his work features openly bisexual and gay characters.

== Career ==
Martin is best known for writing gothic and horror novels and short stories. His trademarks include featuring gay men as main characters, graphic sexual descriptions, and an often wry treatment of gruesome events. Some of Martin&#x27;s better known novels include &quot;Lost Souls&quot; (1992), &quot;Drawing Blood&quot; (1993), and the controversial serial killer novel &quot;Exquisite Corpse&quot; (1996); he has also released the short fiction collections &quot;Wormwood&quot; (originally published as &quot;Swamp Foetus&quot;; 1993), &quot;Are You Loathsome Tonight?&quot; (also published as &quot;Self-Made Man&quot;; 1998), &quot;Wrong Things&quot; (with Caitlín R. Kiernan; 2001), and &quot;The Devil You Know&quot; (2003). His &quot;Calcutta: Lord of Nerves&quot; was selected to represent the year 1992 in the story anthology &quot;The Century&#x27;s Best Horror Fiction&quot;.

In a 1998 interview, in response to a comment that &quot;Growing up in the American South [shaped him] as a writer&quot;, Martin mentioned that Southern writers Carson McCullers, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, Flannery O&#x27;Connor, Harper Lee, Thomas Wolfe and William Faulkner also influenced his writing. Answering a follow-up question about his literary influences, he also included &quot;Bradbury, Nabokov, W.S. Burroughs, Stephen King, Ramsey Campbell, Shirley Jackson, Thomas Ligotti, Kathe Koja, Dennis Cooper, Dorothy Parker, Dylan Thomas, Harlan Ellison, Peter Straub, Paul Theroux, Baudelaire, Poe, Lovecraft, John Lennon... I could rattle off ten or twenty more easily; they&#x27;re all in there somewhere.&quot;

Martin wrote &quot;Courtney Love: The Real Story&quot; (1997), a biography of singer Courtney Love. It was officially &quot;unauthorized&quot;, but he acknowledged that the work was done at Love&#x27;s suggestion and with her cooperation, including access to her personal journal and letters.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Martin moved away from horror fiction and gothic themes while still writing about gay characters. The critically acclaimed &quot;Liquor&quot; novels—&quot;Liquor&quot; (2004), &quot;Prime&quot; (2005), and &quot;Soul Kitchen&quot; (2006)—are dark comedies set in the New Orleans restaurant world. &quot;The Value of X&quot; (2002) depicts the beginning of the careers of the protagonists of the &quot;Liquor&quot; series—Gary &quot;G-Man&quot; Stubbs and John &quot;Rickey&quot; Rickey; other stories, including several in his most recent collection &quot;The Devil You Know&quot; (2003) and the novella &quot;D*U*C*K&quot;, chronicle events in the lives of the extended Stubbs family, a Catholic clan whose roots are sunk deep in the traditional culture of New Orleans. Martin hopes to eventually write three more novels in the &quot;Liquor&quot; series, tentatively titled &quot;Dead Shrimp Blues&quot;, &quot;Hurricane Stew&quot;, and &quot;Double Shot&quot;. However, in late 2006, he ceased publishing with Three Rivers Press, the trade paperback division of Random House that published the first three &quot;Liquor&quot; novels, and is currently taking a hiatus from fiction writing. He has described &quot;Antediluvian Tales&quot;, a short story collection published by Subterranean Press in November 2007, as &quot;if not my last book ever, then my last one for some time.&quot; He still writes short non-fiction pieces, including guest editorials for the New Orleans &quot;Times-Picayune&quot; and a food article for &quot;Chile Pepper Magazine&quot;.

Martin has often stated that, while he will allow some of his work to be optioned for film under the right circumstances, he has little interest in movies and is not overly eager to see his work filmed. In 1999, his short story &quot;The Sixth Sentinel&quot; (filmed as &quot;The Dream Sentinel&quot;) made up one segment of episode 209 of &quot;The Hunger&quot;, a short-lived horror anthology series on Showtime.

Critical essays on Martin&#x27;s fiction appear in &quot;Supernatural Fiction Writers: Contemporary Fantasy and Horror&quot; (2003) by Brian Stableford and &quot;The Evolution of the Weird Tale&quot; (2004) by S. T. Joshi.

On June 9, 2010, Martin officially stated that he was retired from writing, in a post entitled &quot;I&#x27;m Basically Retired (For Now)&quot; on his Livejournal. He stated that he had &quot;completely lost the ability to interact with [his] body of work&quot; and then went on to state that business issues were a partial cause. He also specifically mentioned being unable to disconnect from aspects of his life relating to Hurricane Katrina. He ended his statement by saying that he missed having relationships with his characters and that he did not feel the need to write for publication. Martin has since created a series of artworks themed on New Orleans and voodoo.

In 2018, Martin announced he had returned to writing with a non-fiction project entitled &quot;Water If God Wills It: Religion and Spirituality in the Work of Stephen King&quot;.

In August 2023, Martin announced on his own Facebook page that he was writing fiction again, but that it would be a long time until it would be published.

== Personal life ==
Martin was born in Bowling Green, Warren County, Kentucky, at Western University Hospital. He is a trans man and has written and talked extensively about transgender issues and his own gender dysphoria. He is gay, and has said, &quot;Ever since I was old enough to know what gay men were, I&#x27;ve considered myself a gay man that happens to have been born in a female body, and that&#x27;s the perspective I&#x27;m coming from.&quot; In 2003, Martin wrote that, while gender theorists like Kate Bornstein would call him a &quot;nonoperative transsexual&quot;, Martin would not insist on a label, writing &quot;I&#x27;m just me&quot;. In 2010, he began hormone therapy, and in 2011 expressed that he would prefer to be referred to by male pronouns.

On January 6, 2009, Martin was arrested at Our Lady of Good Counsel Church in New Orleans as part of a peaceful demonstration in which churches in the Uptown area of the city were occupied to protest their closings. In August 2009, New Orleans&#x27;s &quot;Gambit&quot; publication published reader-poll results naming Martin in second place as an ever-popular &quot;Best Local Author&quot;.

Martin married his husband, photographer and artist Grey Anatoli Cross, in 2019. The couple first met in 2011.

<doc id="93791" wikidata="Q232301" url="?curid=93791" title="Roseanne Barr">
<text>Roseanne Cherrie Barr (born November 3, 1952), also known mononymously as Roseanne, is an American actress, comedian, writer, and producer. She began her career in stand-up comedy before gaining acclaim in the television sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot; (1988–1997; 2018). She won an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her work on the show.
&quot;Roseanne&quot; was revived in 2018 on ABC. A ratings success, it was renewed for an additional season but was canceled after Barr made a tweet condemned as racist by many commentators. She referred to the tweet as a &quot;bad joke&quot;. In 2022, she announced a comeback comedy special which was released on Fox Nation in 2023.

==Early life==
Barr was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, to a Jewish family. She is the oldest of four children born to Helen (née Davis), a bookkeeper and cashier, and Jerome Hershel &quot;Jerry&quot; Barr, a salesman. Her father&#x27;s family were Jewish emigrants from the Russian Empire, and her maternal grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Austria-Hungary and Lithuania. Her paternal grandfather changed his surname from &quot;Borisofsky&quot; to &quot;Barr&quot; upon entering the United States. Barr&#x27;s great-grandparents were murdered during the Holocaust.

Her Jewish upbringing was influenced by her devoutly Orthodox Jewish maternal grandmother. Barr&#x27;s parents kept their Jewish heritage secret from their neighbors and were partially involved in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Barr has stated, &quot;Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning I was a Jew; Sunday afternoon, Tuesday afternoon, and Wednesday afternoon we were Mormons.&quot;

When Barr was three, she was afflicted with Bell&#x27;s palsy on the left side of her face. She said, &quot;[so] my mother called in a rabbi to pray for me, but nothing happened. Then my mother got a Mormon preacher, he prayed, and I was miraculously cured&quot;. Years later, she learned that Bell&#x27;s palsy was usually temporary and that the Mormon elder came &quot;exactly at the right time&quot;.

Barr has stated that she is on the autism spectrum. At six years old, she discovered her first public stage by lecturing at LDS churches around Utah and was elected president of a Mormon youth group.

She attended East High School. At age 16, however, Barr was hit by a car, and the car&#x27;s hood ornament impaled her skull; the incident left her with a traumatic brain injury. Her behavior changed so radically that she was institutionalized for eight months at Utah State Hospital. 

In 1970, when Barr was 18, she moved out by informing her parents that she was going to visit a friend in Colorado for two weeks, and never returned.

The following year, Barr had a baby, whom she put up for adoption. She and her daughter amicably reunited 17 years later.

==Career==

===Stand-up comedian: 1980–1986===
While in Colorado, Barr began doing stand-up gigs in clubs in Denver and other Colorado towns. She later tried out at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles, and went on to appear on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in 1985.

In 1986, she performed on a Rodney Dangerfield special and on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, and the following year had her own HBO special called &quot;The Roseanne Barr Show&quot;, which earned her an American Comedy Award for the funniest female performer in a television special.

Barr was offered the role of Peg Bundy in &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, but turned it down. In her routine she popularized the phrase &quot;domestic goddess&quot; to refer to a homemaker or housewife. The success of her act led to her own series on ABC, called &quot;Roseanne&quot;.

===&quot;Roseanne&quot; sitcom, film, books, and talk show: 1987–2004===

In 1987, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; executive producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner wanted to bring a &quot;no-perks family comedy&quot; to television. They hired &quot;Cosby&quot; writer Matt Williams to write a script about factory workers and signed Barr to play Roseanne Conner.

The show premiered on October 18, 1988, and was watched by 21.4 million households, making it the highest-rated debut of that season.

Barr became outraged when she watched the first episode of &quot;Roseanne&quot; and noticed that in the credits, Williams was listed as creator. She told Tanner Stransky of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;We built the show around my actual life and my kids. The &#x27;domestic goddess&#x27;, the whole thing.&quot; In the same interview, Werner said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think Roseanne, to this day, understands that this is something legislated by the Writers Guild, and it&#x27;s part of what every show has to deal with. They&#x27;re the final arbiters.&quot;

During the first season, Barr sought more creative control over the show, opposing Williams&#x27; authority. Barr refused to say certain lines and eventually walked off set. She threatened to quit the show if Williams did not leave. ABC let Williams go after the thirteenth episode. Barr gave Amy Sherman-Palladino and Joss Whedon their first writing jobs on &quot;Roseanne&quot;.

&quot;Roseanne&quot; ran for nine seasons from 1988 to 1997. Barr won an Emmy, a Golden Globe, a Kids&#x27; Choice Award, and three American Comedy Awards for her part in the show. Barr had crafted a &quot;fierce working-class domestic goddess&quot; persona in the eight years preceding her sitcom and wanted to do a realistic show about a strong mother &quot;who was not a victim of patriarchal consumerism.&quot;

For the final two seasons, Barr earned $40 million, making her the second-highest-paid woman in show business at the time, after Oprah Winfrey.

On July 25, 1990, Barr performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; off-key before a baseball game between the San Diego Padres and Cincinnati Reds at Jack Murphy Stadium. She later said she was singing as loudly as possible to hear herself over the public-address system, so her rendition of the song sounded &quot;screechy&quot;. Following her rendition, she mimicked the often-seen actions of players by spitting and grabbing her crotch as if adjusting a protective cup. Barr later said that the Padres had suggested she &quot;bring humor to the song&quot;, but many criticized the episode, including President George H. W. Bush, who called her rendition &quot;disgraceful&quot;.
Barbara Ehrenreich called Barr a working-class spokesperson representing &quot;the hopeless underclass of the female sex: polyester-clad, overweight occupants of the slow track; fast-food waitresses, factory workers, housewives, members of the invisible pink-collar army; the despised, the jilted, the underpaid&quot;, but a master of &quot;the kind of class-militant populism that the Democrats, most of them anyway, never seem to get right.&quot; Barr reportedly refused to use the term &quot;blue collar&quot; because she felt it masks the issue of class.

During &quot;Roseanne&quot;″s final season, Barr was in negotiations between Carsey-Werner Productions and ABC executives to continue playing Roseanne Conner in a spin-off. After failed discussions with ABC as well as CBS and Fox, Carsey-Werner and Barr agreed not to continue the negotiations.

She released her autobiography in 1989, titled &quot;Roseanne—My Life As a Woman&quot;. That same year, she made her film debut in &quot;She-Devil&quot;, playing a scorned housewife, Ruth. Film critic Roger Ebert gave her a positive review saying, &quot;Barr could have made an easy, predictable and dumb comedy at any point in the last couple of years. Instead, she took her chances with an ambitious project—a real movie. It pays off, in that Barr demonstrates that there is a core of reality inside her TV persona, a core of identifiable human feelings like jealousy and pride, and they provide a sound foundation for her comic acting.&quot;

In 1991, she voiced the baby Julie in &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Too&quot;. She was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress.

She appeared three times on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1991 to 1994, co-hosting with then-husband Tom Arnold in 1992.

In 1994, she released a second book, &quot;My Lives&quot;. That same year, Barr became the first female comedian to host the MTV Video Music Awards on her own. She remained the only one to have done so until comedian Chelsea Handler hosted in 2010. In 1997, she made guest appearances on &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; and &quot;The Nanny&quot;.

In 1998, she portrayed the Wicked Witch of the West in a production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; at Madison Square Garden. That same year, Barr hosted her own talk show, &quot;The Roseanne Show&quot;, which ran for two years before it was canceled in 2000.

In the summer of 2003, she took on the dual role of hosting a cooking show called &quot;Domestic Goddess&quot; and starring in a reality show called &quot;The Real Roseanne Show&quot; about hosting a cooking show. Although 13 episodes were in production, a hysterectomy brought a premature end to both projects.

In 2004, she voiced Maggie, one of the main characters in the animated film &quot;Home on the Range&quot;.

===Return to stand-up, television guest appearances, and radio: 2005–2010===
In 2005, she returned to stand-up comedy with a world tour.

In February 2006, Barr performed her first-ever live dates in Europe as part of the Leicester Comedy Festival in Leicester, England. The shows took place at De Montfort Hall. She released her first children&#x27;s DVD, &quot;Rockin&#x27; with Roseanne: Calling All Kids&quot;, that month.

Barr&#x27;s return to the stage culminated in an HBO Comedy Special &quot;Roseanne Barr: Blonde N Bitchin&quot;&#x27;, which aired November 2006, on HBO. Two nights earlier, Barr had returned to primetime network TV with a guest spot on NBC&#x27;s &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot;, playing a crazy trailer park manager.

In April 2007, Barr hosted season three of &quot;The Search for the Funniest Mom in America&quot; on Nick at Nite.

In March 2008, she headlined an act at the Sahara Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.

From 2009 to 2010, she hosted a politically themed radio show on KPFK.

Since 2008, she and partner Johnny Argent have hosted a weekly radio show on Sundays, on KCAA in the Los Angeles area, called &quot;The Roseanne and Johnny Show&quot;.

On April 15, 2009, Barr made an appearance on Bravo&#x27;s 2nd Annual A-List Awards in the opening scenes. She played Kathy Griffin&#x27;s fairy godmother, granting her wish to be on the A-List for one night only.

In February 2010, Barr headlined the inaugural Traverse City Comedy Arts Festival in a project of the Traverse City Film Festival, founded by filmmaker Michael Moore. Moore developed the comedy fest with comedian Jeff Garlin.

In 2010, Barr appeared in Jordan Brady&#x27;s documentary about stand-up comedy, &quot;I Am Comic&quot;.

===Reality television, &quot;Roseanne&quot; revival and new comedy special: 2011–present===

In January 2011, Barr released her third book, &quot;Roseannearchy: Dispatches from the Nut Farm&quot;.

In 2011, she appeared in a Super Bowl XLV commercial for Snickers along with comedian Richard Lewis. It was the most popular ad, based on the number of TiVo users rewinding and watching it over.

On July 13, 2011, &quot;Roseanne&#x27;s Nuts&quot;, a reality show featuring Barr, boyfriend Johnny Argent, and son Jake as they run a macadamia nut and livestock farm in Big Island, Hawaii was premiered on Lifetime, but was canceled in September of that year.

In August 2011, it was reported that Barr was working on a new sitcom with 20th Century Fox Television titled &quot;Downwardly Mobile&quot;. Eric Gilliland was attached as co-creator, writer and executive producer; Gilliland was also a writer on &quot;Roseanne&quot;. In October 2011, NBC picked up the show but later dropped it. A pilot was filmed but initially ended up being shelved by the network. Barr called her progressive politics the sole reason behind the pilot&#x27;s rejection. She said she was notified that the show would not be picked up due to its being labeled &quot;too polarizing&quot; by network executives.

Barr was roasted by Comedy Central in August 2012. After stating that he would not, Barr&#x27;s former spouse Tom Arnold appeared on the roast.

In the summer of 2014 Barr joined Keenen Ivory Wayans and Russell Peters as a judge on &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot; on NBC.

On November 28, 2014, Barr&#x27;s series, &quot;Momsters: When Moms Go Bad&quot; debuted on the Investigation Discovery cable network, a network that she says she&#x27;s a &quot;little obsessed with&quot;. Barr hosts the show as herself.

On March 27, 2018, the revived, 10th season of &quot;Roseanne&quot; with the original cast premiered on ABC to high ratings. On March 30, 2018, ABC renewed the series for an 11th season, with thirteen episodes. On May 29, 2018, the series was canceled by ABC in the aftermath of a tweet widely considered to be racist. Barr and Tom Werner later came to an agreement on relinquishing her producer&#x27;s stake in a spin-off titled &quot;The Conners&quot;, which ABC ordered for the fall season soon after.

In September 2022, it was announced that Barr would appear in a new comedy special, titled &quot;Cancel This!&quot; It was released on the streaming service Fox Nation on February 13, 2023.

On November 30, 2023, it was announced that Barr would star in an adult animated comedy series for &quot;The Daily Wire&quot;, titled &quot;Mr Birchum&quot;. It is scheduled to debut in early 2024.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and children===
Barr has been married three times and has five children. In 1970, when she was 17, she had a child, Brandi Ann Brown, whom she placed for adoption; they were later reunited. On February 4, 1974, Barr married Bill Pentland, a motel clerk she met while in Colorado. They had three children: Jessica, Jennifer, and Jake. They divorced on January 16, 1990. Four days later, on January 20, 1990, Barr married fellow comedian Tom Arnold and became known as Roseanne Arnold during the marriage. Barr had met Arnold in 1983 in Minneapolis, where he opened for her stand-up comedy act. In 1988, Barr brought Arnold onto her sitcom, &quot;Roseanne&quot;, as a writer.

Barr filed for divorce from Arnold on April 18, 1994 in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, citing irreconcilable differences. Their efforts to have children were unsuccessful.

On February 14, 1995, Barr married Ben Thomas, her one-time personal security guard, at Caesars Tahoe with a reception at Planet Hollywood. In November 1994, she became pregnant through in vitro fertilization and they had a son named Buck. The couple stayed together until 2002.

In 2002, Barr met Johnny Argent online after running a writing competition on her blog and began dating him in 2003, after a year of phone conversations. They live on a macadamia nut farm on the Big Island of Hawaii, which Barr purchased in 2007 for $1.78 million. Barr has studied Kabbalah at the Kabbalah Centre and frequently comments on the discipline.

===Family conflicts===
Barr&#x27;s sister Geraldine is a lesbian and her brother Ben is gay. Barr has said that this inspired her to introduce gay characters into her sitcom and to support same-sex marriage.

Geraldine worked as Barr&#x27;s manager during the early part of her career and clashed with Barr&#x27;s second husband, Tom Arnold. Barr fired Geraldine, leading Geraldine to file a $70.3 million breach of contract lawsuit in Superior Court of Los Angeles County on December 18, 1991. She said Barr promised her half the earnings from the &quot;Roseanne&quot; show as recompense for helping invent the &quot;domestic goddess&quot; character in 1981, and for serving as &quot;writer, organizer, accountant, bookkeeper and confidante&quot;. Since the statute of limitations had expired, the suit was thrown out.

In a 1991 interview with &quot;People&quot;, Barr described herself as an incest survivor, accusing both of her parents of physical and sexual abuse, claims which they and Geraldine publicly denied. Melvin Belli, her parents&#x27; lawyer, said they had passed a polygraph test &quot;with flying colors&quot;. Barr was part of an incest recovery group, something she said her parents knew about but for which they were &quot;in denial&quot;.

On February 14, 2011, Barr and Geraldine appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; where Barr admitted the word &quot;incest&quot; could have been the wrong word to use and that she should have waited until her therapy was over before revealing the &quot;darkest time&quot; in her life. She told Oprah Winfrey, &quot;I was in a very unhappy relationship and I was prescribed numerous psychiatric drugs ... to deal with the fact that I had some mental illness ... I totally lost touch with reality ... (and) I didn&#x27;t know what the truth was ... I just wanted to drop a bomb on my family&quot;. She added that not everything was &quot;made up&quot;, saying, &quot;Nobody accuses their parents of abusing them without justification&quot;. Geraldine said they had not spoken for 12 years, but had reconciled.

===Health problems===
In the mid-1990s, Barr had multiple cosmetic surgeries performed, such as a breast reduction, tummy tuck, and a nose job. During the late 1990s, she had gastric bypass surgery.

In 1994, Roseanne announced that she had dissociative identity disorder caused by childhood abuse. She had personalities named Baby, Cindy, Evangelina, Fucker, Heather, Joey, Kevin, Nobody, Somebody, and Susan as well as her main personality, Roseanne. By 2001, she claimed the personalities had mostly fused into one after 10 years of therapy.

In 2015, Barr revealed she had been diagnosed with both macular degeneration and glaucoma, and thus was gradually losing her eyesight and expected to eventually go blind. She consumed medical marijuana to decrease her high intraocular pressure (a feature of the diseases). Barr later revealed that she was misdiagnosed and that her vision problem is really due to a mole resting behind her eye, which could be corrected through surgery. In November 2018, Barr was said to have had a heart attack, but she later stated on social media that she was not experiencing any medical issues.

==Controversies==
===Hitler photoshoot===
Barr elicited criticism in July 2009 when she posed as Adolf Hitler in a feature for the satirical Jewish publication &quot;Heeb&quot; magazine called &quot;That Oven Feelin. The Nazi theme was her suggestion, and featured her with a Hitler mustache and swastika arm-band, holding a tray of burnt gingerbread man cookies the article referred to as &quot;burnt Jew cookies&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s publisher, Josh Neuman, said the photos were taken for satire and were not done for shock value. Barr, who is Jewish, said she was &quot;making fun of Hitler, not his victims&quot;. Fox News TV host Bill O&#x27;Reilly was highly critical of her for &quot;mocking the Holocaust&quot; and &quot;Extra&quot;&#x27;s Mario Lopez stated &quot;Come on, Roseanne. Hitler jokes are never funny.&quot; The revival of her show in March 2018 caused the photos to resurface on social media and renewed mentions of the incident in the Jewish magazine &quot;The Forward&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, among others.

===Zimmerman and Parkland shooting tweets===
In 2014, the parents of George Zimmerman, the man known for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin, filed a lawsuit against Barr for tweeting their home address and phone number in 2012. Zimmerman&#x27;s parents alleged that Barr sought to &quot;cause a lynch mob to descend&quot; on their home. In August 2015, summary judgment was granted in favor of Barr.

In late March 2018, Barr tweeted about a conspiracy theory involving David Hogg, a survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida. The conspiracy theory falsely claimed that Hogg gave a Nazi salute at a March for Our Lives rally on March 24. Barr later deleted her tweet.

===Valerie Jarrett tweet and &quot;Roseanne&quot; cancellation===

On May 29, 2018, Barr responded to a thread on Twitter about Valerie Jarrett, a senior advisor to former President Obama. It reads &quot;muslim brotherhood &amp; planet of the apes had a baby=vj&quot;. The tweet was widely criticized as being racist about Jarrett (&quot;vj&quot;). Barr was initially defensive, but later posted an apology &quot;for making a bad joke about [Jarrett&#x27;s] politics and her looks.&quot; She disputed allegations of racism, tweeting she believed Jarrett was Saudi, Jewish, and Persian, and released a video where she claims she &quot;thought the bitch was white&quot;, and that she was being labelled a racist for having voted for Donald Trump. Barr also said she made the tweet, which she called wrong and indefensible, at 2:00 a.m. while on Ambien, a sedative. Sanofi, which manufactures Ambien, responded by tweeting that &quot;racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication&quot;, though noted Ambien had been linked to reduced inhibitions. Later that day, ABC canceled &quot;Roseanne&quot; and removed the show&#x27;s content from the network website. Reruns of the original &quot;Roseanne&quot; were also removed from the Katz Broadcasting-owned diginet Laff. The cancellation announcement from ABC president Channing Dungey, the first African-American woman to head the network, called Barr&#x27;s remark &quot;abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values.&quot; Within three weeks, the television show was revived as spinoff &quot;The Conners&quot;, with mostly the same cast and crew, minus Barr. In a later interview with Sean Hannity, Barr said that her tweet was intended to be a political statement rather than a racial one.

===George Soros===
Barr claimed that George Soros helped Nazis to round up Jews to be sent to concentration camps. In reality, his assimilated father entrusted him to a Hungarian official with whom the 14-year-old Soros went to inventory a Jewish property. Soros said he need not feel guilt, since, if he had not have been there, &quot;somebody else would ... be taking it away anyhow&quot;. In response to a tweet about Soros by Chelsea Clinton, Barr tweeted using a clip from &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview of Soros and misquoted him. She later apologized for her comments.

===Theo Von podcast===
In 2023, Barr appeared on Theo Von&#x27;s podcast &quot;This Past Weekend&quot;, where she and Von discussed former President Donald Trump&#x27;s claims of election fraud, and she said, &quot;that&#x27;s all a lie, the election was not rigged [...] thirty-six counties have 81 million people in them. That&#x27;s the truth and don&#x27;t you dare say anything against it or you&#x27;ll be off YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and all the other ones. Because there&#x27;s such a thing as the truth and facts and we have to stick to it.&quot; She then appeared to deny the Holocaust, declaring, &quot;six million Jews should die right now, because they cause all the problems in the world&quot;, in what she said was sarcasm. Within the same podcast, she discussed her Jewish faith, and in response to Von&#x27;s comment that &quot;Hollywood is a Jewish business&quot;, she replied, &quot;people should be glad that it&#x27;s Jewish, too, because if Jews were not controlling Hollywood all you&#x27;d have was fucking fishing shows&quot;. The segment in which she talked about the Holocaust was subsequently spread on Twitter, misleadingly edited to remove the context which made it clear that her remarks were sarcastic, sparking controversy. Twitter subsequently added a &quot;context&quot; message to the tweet containing the edited video, which states, &quot;this is a deceptively edited clip from a comedy podcast. Roseanne is Jewish, and this was part of a satirical rant about censorship on YouTube. She was not actually denying the Holocaust, or wishing death upon Jews.&quot; In response to the controversy over her remarks, she stated that she had lost family members in the Holocaust, clarifying, &quot;I was raised in an apartment building with Holocaust survivors, so of course I don&#x27;t believe the Holocaust never happened and I actually am [a religious Jew]&quot;. Jonathan Greenblatt, Director and CEO of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), tweeted in response to the clip, &quot;sarcasm or not, Roseanne Barr&#x27;s comments about Jews and the Holocaust are reprehensible and irresponsible. This isn&#x27;t funny.&quot; The Simon Wiesenthal Center reviewed the interview and concluded that she had been taken out of context. The podcast episode was subsequently removed from YouTube for violating the site&#x27;s hate speech policies.

==Political activities==

===2012 presidential campaign===
On August 5, 2011, Barr appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and announced her candidacy for president in the 2012 presidential election, running on the self-created &quot;Green Tea Party&quot; ticket. Her candidacy called attention to economics, personal health, and meditation.

She also stated she would run for Prime Minister of Israel. In an interview with &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward,&quot; she invoked tikkun olam in her support of bringing women into politics and religion.

On September 19, she appeared at the Occupy Wall Street protests and spoke in support of the protestors. &quot;She stated any &#x27;guilty&#x27; Wall Street bankers should be forced to give up any income over $100 million, and if they are unable to live on that, be sent to re-education camps, and if that doesn&#x27;t help be beheaded&quot;.

Barr filed with the Federal Election Commission as a Green Party presidential candidate in January 2012. She formally announced her candidacy for the party&#x27;s presidential nomination on February 2. On July 14, she came in second in the 2012 Green Party presidential primaries and subsequent convention roll call, losing the nomination to Jill Stein. Stein chose Cheri Honkala as her running-mate after campaign manager Ben Manski said Barr was shortlisted for the job.

Barr was given a prime speaking role at the Green Party National Convention in Baltimore, Maryland, but decided to instead send a surrogate (Farheen Hakeem) to speak on her behalf. Barr&#x27;s surrogate reportedly chided the party for not respecting Barr&#x27;s candidacy. A shouting match in a hallway reportedly ensued.

Barr repeatedly criticized Jill Stein after losing the Green Party nomination, and used alleged transphobic words in statements about Stein on Twitter.

Shortly after losing the Green Party nomination, on August 4, 2012, Barr won the presidential nomination of the Peace and Freedom Party with activist Cindy Sheehan as her running mate.

Sheehan immediately had disagreements with Barr&#x27;s views on policy, desire to campaign only online, and treatment of Green Party nominee Jill Stein, leading Sheehan to request that her name be taken off the Peace and Freedom Party ticket. Sheehan was told it was too late to have her name removed, so she instead announced that she would be leaving the campaign.

Barr appeared on the ballot in California, Colorado, and Florida. She did not appear on the ballot in her home state of Hawaii (which did not allow write-in votes). She ended up voting for President Obama. She received 67,326 votes nationwide, placing sixth overall with 0.05% of the popular vote; Stein, who appeared on the ballot of thirty-six states and the District of Columbia, placed far ahead of her in fourth place with 0.36% of the popular vote and 469,627 votes.

Barr was followed by a film crew throughout her entire campaign, with documentarian Eric Weinrib directing, leading to questions about the sincerity of her campaign. Over 300 hours were filmed and were released as a film called &quot;Roseanne for President!&quot; Despite questions of her sincerity regarding her campaign, Barr and her family have insisted her desire to run for president was &quot;very real.&quot;

====Endorsements====
*Green Party Black Caucus
*National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws
*Cynthia McKinney, 2008 Green Party nominee

===Support for Donald Trump===
Barr voiced her support for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in a June 2016 &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; interview. &quot;I think we would be so lucky if Trump won. Because then it wouldn&#x27;t be Hillary.&quot;

A July 2016 CNN story reported she did not endorse Trump as she only supports herself for president—&quot;I will be writing myself in in every election from now until I win.&quot;

In March 2018, Barr retweeted a false claim by QAnon conspiracy theorist Liz Crokin that Trump had saved hundreds of children from sex traffickers during his first month in office, as well as similar misinformation about child trafficking. Barr later deleted her tweets. In May 2018, Barr defended her support for Trump on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;.

In December 2023, Barr spoke at the Turning Point USA hosted America Fest.

Barr is featured in rapper Tom MacDonald&#x27;s single &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home&quot;, released on January 17, 2025; the song&#x27;s name references the second inauguration of Donald Trump. Barr&#x27;s solo verse in the song includes the lyrics &quot;Screw Eminem&quot; and &quot;Why they trying to turn Becky into Dan?&quot;, the latter referencing the characters in her shows.

<text>Christopher Moore (born January 1, 1957) is an American writer.

==Early life==
Christopher Moore was born in Toledo, Ohio and grew up in Mansfield, Ohio. 

An only child, Moore learned to amuse himself with his imagination. He loved reading and his father brought him plenty of books from the library every week. He started writing around the age of twelve and realized that this was his talent by the time he was 16, and he began to consider making it his career.

Moore attended Ohio State University and Brooks Institute of Photography in Santa Barbara, California.

==Writing career==
Moore&#x27;s novels typically involve conflicted everyman characters struggling through supernatural or extraordinary circumstances. With the possible exceptions of &quot;Fool&quot;, &quot;The Serpent of Venice&quot;, &quot;Sacré Bleu&quot;, and &quot;Shakespeare for Squirrels: A Novel&quot;, all his books take place in the same universe and some characters recur from novel to novel.

According to his interview in the June 2007 issue of &quot;Writer&#x27;s Digest&quot;, the film rights to Moore&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Practical Demonkeeping&quot; (1992), were purchased by Disney even before the book had a publisher. In answer to repeated questions from fans over the years, Moore stated that all of his books have been optioned or sold for films, but that as yet &quot;none of them are in any danger of being made into a movie.&quot;

Moore has named Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, John Steinbeck, Tom Robbins, Richard Brautigan, Robert Bloch, Richard Matheson, Jules Verne, Ray Bradbury, H. P. Lovecraft, Edgar Allan Poe and Ian Fleming as key influences on his writing.

==Personal life==
As of June 2006, Moore lives in San Francisco, after a few years on the island of Kauai, Hawaii.

==Bibliography==

=== Novels ===
Moore&#x27;s novels typically take place in the same fictional universe since characters from one book frequently turn up as minor characters or have cameos in other books. Some novels with a common protagonist or setting can be grouped into series; however, with the exception of the vampire books and the Death Merchant Chronicles, they can all be read as stand-alone novels.

<doc id="93801" wikidata="Q575373" url="?curid=93801" title="Roseanne">
<text>Roseanne is an American television sitcom created by Matt Williams that originally aired on ABC from October 18, 1988, to May 20, 1997, and briefly revived from March 27, 2018, to May 22, 2018. The show stars Roseanne Barr as Roseanne Conner and revolves around her family in the fictional town of Lanford, Illinois. Receiving generally positive reviews for its realistic portrayal of a working-class American family, the series reached No. 1 in the Nielsen ratings from 1989 to 1990 in its second season.

During the initial run, the series remained in the top four for six of the nine seasons, and in the top 20 for eight. During the short-lived revival, the series reached No. 3, with an average of 18 million viewers per episode within the span of its nine episodes. In 1993, the episode &quot;A Stash from the Past&quot; was ranked No. 21 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time. In 2002, &quot;Roseanne&quot; was ranked No. 35 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 2013, it was ranked No. 32 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 60 Best Series of All Time.

On May 16, 2017, ABC announced it had greenlit a revived, 10th season of &quot;Roseanne&quot; as a mid-season replacement in 2018, with the original cast returning. In November 2017, ABC requested an additional episode, bringing the total to nine. It premiered on March 27, 2018, to an initial audience of 18.44 million, which grew to 27.26 million total viewers following 7 days of delayed viewing. On March 30, 2018, following the success of its premiere, &quot;Roseanne&quot; was renewed for an 11th season of 13 episodes.

ABC, however, reversed its renewal decision and canceled &quot;Roseanne&quot; on May 29, 2018, after Barr likened former Obama administration official Valerie Jarrett to &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, in a series of comments on Twitter that were described by the network&#x27;s president as &quot;abhorrent, repugnant, and inconsistent with our values&quot;. On June 21, 2018, ABC announced plans to re-tool the show as a spin-off continuation involving the Conner family without Roseanne, titled &quot;The Conners&quot;, which premiered in October 2018. A ratings success for the network, the series began its sixth season on February 7, 2024, after strike-related delays.

==Production history==
In coming up with ideas for new shows, Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner of Carsey-Werner Productions decided to look into the concept of the working mother as a central voice. Up until that point, there had been countless shows with working mothers, but few treated them as anything other than an adjunct to the father in the family. Werner had suggested that they take a chance on Barr whom they had seen on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. This was because he saw the unique &quot;in your face&quot; voice that they were looking for and he contacted her agent and offered her the role. Barr&#x27;s act at the time was the persona of the &quot;domestic goddess&quot;, but as Carsey and Werner explains, she had the distinctive voice and attitude for the character and she was able to transform herself into the working-class heroine they envisioned. Many early scripts were written by women: Grace McKeaney, Lauren Eve Anderson, and Laurie Gelman (the first female writer-producer to work on Roseanne), and directed by Ellen Gittelsohn.&lt;ref name=&quot;wga.org/101-written-series/roseanne&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Barr maintained that the characters of &quot;Roseanne&quot; and her family were based heavily on Roseanne herself and her own children and lived experience. Matt Williams, the original showrunner hired by Carsey and Werner, maintained that the show had been created before Barr&#x27;s involvement, based on his own family experiences. Under Writers Guild of America regulations, only someone who wrote a series&#x27; pilot episode can receive creator credit on that series; consequently, Williams (who was the sole writer of the pilot) received on-screen credit as the show&#x27;s sole creator. A subsidiary credit noted that the work was based on Barr&#x27;s stand-up comedy.

In 1993, it was made public that Barr would refer to each of her 19 writers by a number rather than their name. The writers would wear shirts with their assigned number.

==Premise==
The series is centered on the Conners, an American working-class family struggling to get by on a limited household income. Dan, Roseanne, and their three young children, Becky, Darlene, and D.J. live at 714 Delaware Street in the drab fictional mid-state exurb of Lanford, in Kane County, Illinois. Although initially nominally located in Fulton County,&lt;ref name=&quot;epguides/Roseanne&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tvmaze/60820&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; more than three hours away from Chicago, later on-air references over the years suggested the town is in the vicinity of Aurora and Elgin, which are less than one hour away from Chicago, and DeKalb, just over one hour away. In a 2018 interview, Barr stated that the series setting was based on Elgin. The family consisted of outspoken Roseanne, married to husband Dan, and their three children: Becky, Darlene, and DJ. Later in the series, Roseanne and Dan have their fourth child, Jerry Garcia Conner.

Many critics considered the show notable as one of the first sitcoms to realistically portray a blue-collar American family with two parents working outside the home, as well as lead characters who were noticeably overweight without their weight being the target of jokes.

Establishing shots were photographed in Evansville, Indiana, the hometown of first-season producer Matt Williams. Exterior shots of the Conner household were based on a real home located in Evansville, located at 619 S. Runnymeade Avenue, a few blocks from Williams&#x27; alma mater, the University of Evansville. Interior shots primarily feature an octagonal kitchen table, used in the introductory title sequence&lt;ref name=&quot;csmonitor/1989/0718/pgar18&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and a living room sofa draped with a crocheted granny square afghan blanket.&lt;ref name=&quot;browbeat/2015/07/06/Blanket&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Barr&#x27;s real-life brother and sister are gay, which inspired her to push for introducing gay characters and issues into the show. &quot;My show seeks to portray various slices of life, and homosexuals are a reality,&quot; said Barr. Provocative storylines have been an integral part of the series throughout its existence; Barr has stated that they were issues that working-class Americans experience in their everyday lives and that very few scripted programs ever address them.

== Cast and characters ==

== Episodes ==

== Original series ==

=== Season 1 ===
Roseanne (Roseanne Barr) is a line worker at Wellman Plastics, along with her sister Jackie (Laurie Metcalf) and friend Crystal (Natalie West). Jackie has a brief relationship with Booker (George Clooney), the foreman at Wellman. Roseanne&#x27;s husband Dan (John Goodman) finds sporadic work as a construction contractor. Dan has a strained relationship with his divorced father, Ed (Ned Beatty), a traveling salesman who was often absent during Dan&#x27;s childhood. Roseanne and Jackie&#x27;s meddlesome parents Beverly (Estelle Parsons) and Al (John Randolph), consider moving to Lanford, panicking both sisters, although this is quickly dismissed as just an &quot;idea&quot;.

Middle Conner child Darlene (Sara Gilbert), a tomboy, often struggles with her femininity as she enters puberty and gets her first period. Eldest child Becky (Lecy Goranson) faces dating problems with her first boyfriend Chip (Jared Rushton), who is introduced in the &quot;Lover&#x27;s Lane&quot; episode. Youngest child David Jacob, known as &quot;D.J.&quot;, has to work hard to be noticed amid all the family&#x27;s activities. Season one also finds the Conners experiencing, and surviving, a tornado. In the &quot;Death and Stuff&quot; episode a door-to-door salesman dies in the Conners&#x27; kitchen, and in the season finale Roseanne stands up to the new abusive foreman (Fred Thompson) when she leads Jackie, Crystal, and other coworkers as they quit Wellman Plastics. D.J. is played by Sal Barone in the pilot episode, then by Michael Fishman for the remainder of the series. This season includes a running gag where the word &quot;corn&quot; is used in every episode.

Notable Season 1 guest stars include Bill Sadler as Dan&#x27;s friend Dwight, Robert Harper as Chip&#x27;s father, Andrea Walters as Chip&#x27;s mother, and Tony Crane as Becky&#x27;s love interest &quot;The Tongue Bandit&quot;. Bill Pentland, Roseanne Barr&#x27;s first husband, made a cameo as one of Dan&#x27;s friends in the &quot;Saturday&quot; episode.

=== Season 2 ===
After quitting Wellman Plastics, Roseanne and Jackie must find new jobs. Jackie becomes a police officer. Roseanne cycles through numerous menial jobs including telemarketer, secretary for Dan&#x27;s boss, bartender, a fast-food restaurant cashier, and, finally, sweeping floors at a beauty parlor. At home, Dan&#x27;s poker buddy Arnie (Tom Arnold) makes a startling debut when he plants a kiss on Roseanne. The Conners celebrate an outrageous Halloween that becomes an annual series feature. Roseanne wants ten relaxing minutes to herself in the bathtub; this turns into a bizarre dream sequence that has the entire cast singing parodies of songs from musical comedies. Later, at Thanksgiving dinner, Roseanne unexpectedly discovers a budding romance between Dan&#x27;s father, Ed, and Crystal. Jackie gets serious with her new boyfriend, Gary (Brian Kerwin). Becky grows rebellious against Roseanne and Dan&#x27;s parental authority, staying out late and breaking into the liquor cabinet and getting drunk with her friend, Dana. When old biker buddy, Ziggy (Jay O. Sanders) reappears, it reminds Roseanne and Dan of their own rebellious past. Darlene shows writing talent after receiving recognition for her poem. Roseanne&#x27;s own writing aspirations are given a boost after Dan builds her an office in the basement. This is the first season Roseanne is heard thinking out loud.

Other notable guest stars during the season include Stephen Dorff as Becky&#x27;s boyfriend Jimmy, Jenny Lewis as Becky&#x27;s friend Diane, Stephen Root as Roseanne&#x27;s lawyer Peter, and Bert Parks as a judge. Ann Wedgeworth played Dan Conner&#x27;s mother in the Thanksgiving episode.

=== Season 3 ===
The season opens with the Conner family confronting Roseanne&#x27;s possible pregnancy. The pregnancy turns up negative. Roseanne takes a waitress job in the luncheonette at Rodbell&#x27;s Department Store, working with her boss, Leon (Martin Mull), and co-worker, Bonnie (Bonnie Sheridan). Jackie is injured on the job, resulting in her leaving the police force and breaking up with Gary. Becky begins dating Mark Healy (Glenn Quinn); when her parents forbid her to see him, she temporarily moves in with Jackie. Dan is floored to learn his father, Ed and Crystal plan to marry; Crystal is pregnant with Ed&#x27;s baby.

Roseanne locks horns with snooty new neighbor Kathy Bowman (Meagen Fay). Bev&#x27;s mother, Nana Mary (Shelley Winters) makes her first appearance at a family barbecue. In the season finale, Ziggy reappears, proposing to open a motorcycle repair shop with Dan. While they attempt to procure a loan for business, Ziggy backs out and leaves town, not wanting Dan and Roseanne to risk their house if the business fails. However, he leaves enough money behind for Dan to open it by himself. He is never heard about again.

Other notable guest stars during the season include Dann Florek as Principal Hiller, Leonardo DiCaprio as Darlene&#x27;s classmate, Brad Garrett as Doug, Judy Gold as Amy, Alyson Hannigan as Becky&#x27;s friend Jan, and Tobey Maguire as Jeff.

=== Season 4 ===
The opening credits of Season 4 change from Season 3 and now shows &quot;Roseanne Arnold&quot; instead of &quot;Roseanne Barr&quot;.

Becky stuns Roseanne by asking for birth-control pills. Dan and Roseanne open their new motorcycle repair shop business, Lanford Custom Cycle, while Roseanne continues working at Rodbell&#x27;s luncheonette. Darlene meets David Healy (Johnny Galecki), Mark&#x27;s younger brother (in his first appearance, the character was named Kevin). After a brief stint working at Rodbell&#x27;s perfume counter, Jackie enrolls in truck driver school. Nancy (Sandra Bernhard) is introduced as Arnie&#x27;s fiancée. After a night of heavy drinking, Jackie wakes up in her bed with the newly engaged Arnie. Darlene&#x27;s personality shifts into a sullen goth teen. Jackie&#x27;s former boyfriend, Booker, makes a surprise appearance at a Halloween party. Roseanne&#x27;s neighbors, Kathy and Jerry Bowman, move back to Chicago. Roseanne gets breast reduction surgery. Crystal gives birth to Dan&#x27;s new half-brother, &quot;Little Ed&quot;. Roseanne and Dan accompany Arnie and Nancy to their wedding in Las Vegas. At the end of the season, Lanford Custom Cycle fails, and Rodbell&#x27;s Luncheonette closes. Nancy is single again after Arnie leaves her and claims he was &quot;abducted by aliens&quot;.

Notable guest stars during the season include Bob Hope, Wayne Newton as himself, David Crosby as Duke, Bonnie Sheridan as Roseanne&#x27;s coworker Bonnie, Neil Patrick Harris as Dr. Doogie Howser, and Rick Dees as Ken.

=== Season 5 ===
After Dan&#x27;s bike shop closes, Mark accepts a job in Minnesota. Becky secretly decides to go with him, and they elope. Jackie and Roseanne each receive $10,000 from their mother, Bev, after she divorces their father. They, along with Nancy, decide to open a diner but can only get the additional money they need from Bev, who becomes a partner. Nancy comes out as a lesbian. The Tildens, a single father, and his two teen daughters (Wings Hauser, Mara Hobel, Danielle Harris), move in next door. Jackie dates Fisher (Matt Roth), a much younger man she quickly moves in with. When Roseanne discovers Fisher physically abused Jackie, Dan beats him up (never shown onscreen) and is arrested. Roseanne and Jackie&#x27;s father dies, and Roseanne confronts his longtime secret mistress only to discover her father blamed his daughters for his abusive behavior. Roseanne&#x27;s rich, estranged cousin Ronnie (Joan Collins) visits and encourages Darlene to get her GED and apply to arts colleges. David applies as well. Darlene wants David to move in when his mother is moving to a new town. Roseanne and Dan initially refuse, but Roseanne relents after witnessing Mrs. Healey&#x27;s abusive behavior, a decision partially based on her own father&#x27;s abusiveness. Roger (Tim Curry) recruits Dan to renovate and sell a small fixer-upper house, then skips town, leaving Dan with a looming debt; Jackie buys the house, saving the Conners from financial ruin. David is rejected from the Chicago arts college that he and Darlene applied to, while Darlene is accepted. Roseanne refuses to let Darlene attend before finishing high school. She fears Darlene might run away to Chicago, but Darlene decides to decline because David was rejected. Roseanne wants Darlene to go after learning David threatened to break up, though Darlene&#x27;s real reason is fear she will fail. During this season, there is a running gag in which each of the Conners (save Becky) appears in a different scene in the same long-sleeved, egg-printed shirt with a large chicken on the front.

Notable guest stars during the season include Wings Hauser as Ty Tilden, Danielle Harris as Molly Tilden, Mara Hobel as Charlotte Tilden, Loretta Lynn as herself, Morgan Fairchild as Nancy&#x27;s girlfriend Marla, Bill Maher as Bob, Ed Begley Jr. as Principal Alexander, Blake Clark as Vic, Red Buttons as Bev&#x27;s lover Jake, Sally Kirkland as Mark and David&#x27;s mother Barbara, Tim Curry as Nancy&#x27;s lover Roger, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as DJ&#x27;s annoying wannabe friend George, Joan Collins as Roseanne and Jackie&#x27;s cousin Ronnie, Matt Roth as Jackie&#x27;s boyfriend Fisher, Steve Jones as a threatening diner patron, and in a very brief cameo, Chris Farley as a customer trying on a too-small leather jacket.

=== Season 6 ===
After Roseanne and Jackie force Bev into being a silent partner in the diner, Bev retaliates by selling her share to Roseanne&#x27;s annoying former boss, Leon. David proposes marriage to Darlene, but she refuses. Roseanne discovers a marijuana stash in the basement, believing it is David&#x27;s. After realizing it is her and Dan&#x27;s old pot, they and Jackie get high. Roseanne&#x27;s past as a child abuse victim arises when she reacts violently after DJ joyrides and wrecks her car. She is left concerned she may be continuing the cycle. Becky (now played by Sarah Chalke) and Mark return to Lanford and move into the Conners&#x27; house. Dan and Roseanne surprise Becky with tuition money to start college but are furious when Becky instead uses it for Mark to attend trade school, though he soon flunks out. Jackie becomes pregnant after a one-night stand with Fred (Michael O&#x27;Keefe), Dan&#x27;s co-worker at the city garage. Though Jackie is initially resistant, she and Fred gradually develop a relationship. Roseanne discovers David secretly living with Darlene in Chicago. She brings him back to Lanford, but when Dan finds out the truth, he throws David out, but soon allows him to return. Roseanne visits a gay bar with Nancy, where she receives an unwanted kiss from Nancy&#x27;s girlfriend. Jackie gives birth to a son, Andy. Dan, who always blamed his father, Ed, for his mother&#x27;s problems, is forced to confront her mental illness. The season concludes with Fred and Jackie&#x27;s wedding.

Notable guest stars during the season include Michael O&#x27;Keefe as Fred, the father of Jackie&#x27;s baby; Sandra Bernhard as Nancy, Roseanne and Jackie&#x27;s co-worker; Mariel Hemingway as Sharon, Nancy&#x27;s girlfriend; Vicki Lawrence as Phyllis, Dan&#x27;s old high school flame; Florence Henderson as Flo, a woman with whom Roseanne networks at a women&#x27;s business club meeting; Genie Francis and Anthony Geary as &quot;General Hospital&quot;&#x27;s Luke and Laura Spencer; Ahmet Zappa as Roy, Mark&#x27;s handsome laconic roommate; and Fabio as himself.

=== Season 7 ===
The opening credits of Season 7 change from previous seasons in that the show now stars &quot;Roseanne&quot; instead of &quot;Roseanne Arnold&quot;.
On the September 21, 1994, Season 7 premiere, in acknowledging Roseanne&#x27;s divorce and dropping her last name, all credits (opening and closing) included the cast and crew&#x27;s first names only (except for creator Matt Williams, whose complete name was shown). This was the only time this occurred in an episode during its run.

Season seven begins with Roseanne&#x27;s pregnancy and goes on to tackle such issues as abortion, alcoholism, drug abuse, sexual dysfunction, and racial prejudice. Darlene and David break up after briefly maintaining an open relationship when Darlene begins dating Jimmy. This leads to some awkwardness for Roseanne and Dan as they deal with their daughter&#x27;s ex-boyfriend living with them. David also dates other girls, but eventually, he and Darlene reunite. Mark and Becky move into a shabby trailer. D.J. plays a bigger role this season, most notably in an episode wherein he refuses to kiss a black girl in his school play. Episode 19 is a special hour-long broadcast that recounts all the previous seasons with Roseanne being &quot;welcomed&quot; by other sitcom moms.

Notable guest stars during the season include Sharon Stone as a trailer-park resident, Ellen DeGeneres as Jackie and Fred&#x27;s marriage counselor, Danny Masterson as Darlene&#x27;s boyfriend Jimmy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as DJ&#x27;s friend George, and Traci Lords as Lanford Lunch Box busperson Stacy. In the season finale, a tribute is made to TV producer Sherwood Schwartz. Uncredited appearances at the end of the &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; episode features former cast members playing Roseanne characters. These include Dawn Wells, Bob Denver, Tina Louise, and Russell Johnson, as well as Sherwood Schwartz. Also, Isabel Sanford, Alley Mills, Barbara Billingsley, June Lockhart, and Pat Crowley appear as themselves in another episode.

=== Season 8 ===
Season eight addresses Roseanne&#x27;s pregnancy and subsequent arrival of her and Dan&#x27;s son, Jerry Garcia Conner. (In a continuity change, the baby had been revealed to be a girl in season seven. Roseanne, in an after-credits out of character scene, explains that &quot;the amnio was wrong&quot;). The season starts with Dan deciding to leave his secure city job and rejoin his old construction crew to drywall the new prison being built outside of Lanford. With the pension money and final check Dan receives when leaving his job, he and Roseanne decide to take the entire family on vacation to Walt Disney World.

It is later revealed that while the clan was at Disney World, Darlene got pregnant. Darlene intends to have the baby and she and David become engaged. The season climaxes with the couple&#x27;s rushed wedding. During the reception, Dan suffers a heart attack. In the next episode, it is revealed that he survived, with D.J. having saved his life by administering CPR. The season concludes with Dan and Roseanne having a bitter fight after Dan abandons his diet and exercise plan, rehashing many buried personality clashes and resentments of the entire series. They end up wrecking their living room in the process. The credits fade as Roseanne walks out on Dan.

Lecy Goranson returns in the role of Becky. Sarah Chalke filled in as Becky for several episodes when Goranson had a scheduling conflict due to her academic studies. Notable guest stars during the season include Fred Willard as Leon&#x27;s husband, Scott, Ed McMahon as himself, John Popper (with Blues Traveler) as an old friend of Dan&#x27;s, Pat Harrington Jr. as himself, Jenna Elfman as hitchhiker Garland, Shecky Greene as Bar Mitzvah guest Uncle Saul, Norm Crosby as Reverend Crosley, June Lockhart as Leon&#x27;s mother, Milton Berle as a transvestite, the cast of Stomp as Lanford Lunch Box patrons, Eric Dane as a Disney World bellhop, and Tony Curtis as ballroom-dance instructor Hal.

=== Season 9 ===
The opening titles of Season 9 still list the star as &quot;Roseanne&quot;, but the first episode credits her as &quot;Roseanne Barr Pentland Arnold Thomas&quot;.

The ninth (and originally final) season features many changes. In previous seasons, the original theme song was played on saxophone, accompanied by drums and other instruments. For this final season, the theme was re-recorded and performed by Blues Traveler with a distorted harmonica—one of the band&#x27;s staples—playing in place of the saxophone. Lyrics were also added and sung into the theme by the band&#x27;s lead vocalist, John Popper. Episodes in this season exhibit a much more surreal style. Additionally, the &#x27;daily struggle&#x27; theme of previous episodes is abandoned, and the season focuses primarily on bringing the characters full circle emotionally. Sarah Chalke returns in the role of Becky so Lecy Goranson could resume her college studies.

The Conners win the Illinois state lottery jackpot of $108 million; Dan ponders the meaning of life, Jackie meets her (real-life) prince, DJ finds love, and Darlene, after pre-natal medical issues, gives birth to a daughter. John Goodman is absent for most of the season, as he was busy filming &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;; in later episodes, Goodman resembles his &quot;Lebowski&quot; character Walter Sobchak.

In the season&#x27;s final episode, Roseanne reveals the entire series itself is actually a fictional story written by Roseanne Conner, inspired by her real life. To cope, Roseanne twisted major elements of her life for the story, which the audience does not discover until the final moments of the season. In reality, Dan&#x27;s heart attack near the end of Season 8 was fatal and the Conner family did not win the lottery. A story arc running through the final season that Dan betrayed Roseanne by having an affair is revealed to be false; Dan&#x27;s betrayal was not having an affair, but dying.

Roseanne could always take the worst life could throw at her with a laugh, but she was unable to cope with Dan&#x27;s death. Also, Jackie is a lesbian and Beverly is straight. Scott is a probate lawyer whom Roseanne befriended, and set up with Leon—whom she claims is not as hip as the way she had written him; this seems a tad tongue in cheek. Becky is dating David and Darlene is with Mark.

Guest stars during the season include Edward Asner as Lou Grant, Heather Matarazzo as D.J.&#x27;s girlfriend, Dann Florek as Doctor Rudmen, Jim Varney as Jackie&#x27;s boyfriend Prince Carlos, Tammy Faye Bakker as Roseanne&#x27;s makeup consultant, Dina Merrill as Doris, Joanna Lumley as Patsy Stone and Jennifer Saunders as Edina Monsoon (reprising their roles from &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;), Arianna Huffington as Estree, Marlo Thomas as Tina, James Brolin as Roseanne&#x27;s business partner/love interest Edgar Wellman, Jr., and Ann Wedgeworth and Debbie Reynolds as Dan&#x27;s mother Audrey, as well as Hugh Hefner, Milton Berle, Robin Leach, Todd Oldham, Moon Unit and Ahmet Zappa, Tony Robbins, Kathleen Sullivan, Steven Seagal, and Jerry Springer as themselves.

== Revival ==
During the show&#x27;s final season, Barr was in negotiations with Carsey-Werner Productions and ABC executives to continue playing Roseanne Conner in a spin-off. However, ABC withdrew from negotiations with Carsey-Werner and Barr after failed discussions with CBS and Fox. Barr and Carsey-Werner agreed to discontinue the negotiations.

In the fall of 2008, Barr commented on what the current whereabouts of the Conners would be. &quot;I&#x27;ve always said now that if they were on TV, DJ would have been killed in Iraq and the Conners would have lost their house&quot;. When asked for more details on where the rest of the Conners would be, Barr responded: &quot;Your question is intellectual property that may be developed later, so I don&#x27;t want to get into that&quot;. She added, &quot;No preview, absolutely not&quot;.

On December 20, 2009, Barr posted an entry on her website regarding what a possible &quot;Roseanne&quot; reunion would be like, which includes: Mark being published, DJ dying in Iraq; David leaving Darlene for a woman half his age, Darlene coming out of the closet and meeting a woman and having a test tube baby with her, Becky working at Walmart, Roseanne and Jackie opening the first medical marijuana dispensary in Lanford, Arnie becoming the best friend of the Governor of Illinois and remarrying Nancy, Bev selling a painting for $10,000, Jerry and the grandsons forming a music group similar to the Jonas Brothers, Dan reappearing alive after faking his death, and Bonnie being arrested for selling crack.

=== Season 10 ===

On April 28, 2017, television trade publications reported an 8-episode revival of the series, being shopped to multiple networks including ABC and Netflix. Barr, Goodman, and Gilbert were attached to reprise their roles, while Metcalf was considered likely to return. Barr, Tom Werner, Bruce Helford would produce the series, alongside Gilbert, who would serve as an executive producer while Helford and Whitney Cummings would be handling day-to-day oversight of the show. Original writer Norm Macdonald stated he had written for eight of the episodes.

In May 2017, it was announced the series was greenlit and would air on ABC mid–season in 2018. Laurie Metcalf, Michael Fishman, Lecy Goranson, and Sarah Chalke were all announced to return. Chalke, who played the character Becky in later seasons, was cast as Andrea, a married woman who hires Becky to be her surrogate. Glenn Quinn, who played Becky&#x27;s husband, Mark, died in December 2002 of a heroin overdose at the age of 32. On December 1, 2017, it was announced that Johnny Galecki would be reprising his role of David Healy for one episode.

Production of nine new episodes began in the fall of 2017 and wrapped in mid-December. The revival features the original cast from the previous nine seasons. New characters include David and Darlene&#x27;s two children as well as D.J.&#x27;s daughter. Sarah Chalke also appears as a new character, Andrea. The sets of the Conner house were replicated at the same studio where the show was filmed for its original run. Season 10 was scheduled as a mid-season replacement to premiere on March 27, 2018. On September 21, 2017, it was revealed that Emma Kenney would be portraying Harris Conner Healy, Darlene&#x27;s eldest child who was born in Season 9. On December 7, 2017, it was confirmed that Estelle Parsons and Sandra Bernhard would return to the series. Parsons would appear in two episodes while Bernhard would appear in one.

On February 25, 2018, it was revealed on the show&#x27;s official Twitter account that the trailer for the revival season would premiere during the 90th Academy Awards on March 4, 2018. To promote the show, ABC sponsored the NASCAR Xfinity Series race at Auto Club Speedway by naming it the Roseanne 300. In March 2018, ABC opened a pop-up restaurant during South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, that recreated the &quot;Lanford Lunch Box&quot; alongside a replica of the series&#x27; living room to promote the show. On March 26, 2018, Sara Gilbert revealed on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; that her sketch with John Goodman on &quot;The Talk&quot; (which Gilbert created and co-hosts) as their &quot;Roseanne&quot; characters, and Goodman&#x27;s willingness to do a reboot, inspired Gilbert to reach out to her cast mates to revive the show. On March 28, 2018, Roseanne Barr echoed Gilbert&#x27;s statements on &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot; and also confirmed that Gilbert&#x27;s sketch on &quot;The Talk&quot; went viral on the internet citing a demand for a reboot.

&quot;Roseanne&quot;″s tenth and final season premiered on March 27, 2018, with two back-to-back episodes on ABC. The premiere begins 20 years after the previous episode, with Season 9 and the final episode being almost completely retconned out of existence as both a dream of and a story by Roseanne – namely Dan&#x27;s death, when he is actually alive. A now separated and unemployed Darlene moves back into the Conner household with her two children, Harris (whose existence is the only surviving element from Season 9, although the character is several years younger) and Mark (whose gender presentation is cause for conflict).

Roseanne and Dan have lost weight but are now on medication. DJ has served a tour in the Army and now has a daughter named Mary (with DJ&#x27;s wife still serving abroad) and Jerry works in Alaska on a fishing boat. When the first episode begins, Roseanne and Jackie have not spoken since the 2016 presidential election (Roseanne having voted for Donald Trump while Jackie voted for Jill Stein despite her having no idea who Stein was, describing her as &quot;some doctor&quot;). The two are reconciled after intervention by Darlene. Meanwhile, desperate for money, Becky, who has struggled financially after her husband Mark&#x27;s death, agrees to act as a surrogate mother for a woman named Andrea (Sarah Chalke). Both Dan and Roseanne opposed this since Becky&#x27;s eggs will be used for the pregnancy.

==== Critical response ====
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, season 10 holds an approval rating of 69% based on 80 reviews, with an average rating of 6.72/10. The website consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Roseanne&quot;″s return finds the show&#x27;s classic format, original cast, and timely humor intact, even if the latest batch of episodes suffers from sporadically uneven execution.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the season a score of 69 out of 100 based on 31 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Actor Tom Arnold, Roseanne&#x27;s ex-husband, reviewed the revival positively, specifically praising Metcalf&#x27;s performance.

U.S. president Donald Trump, whom Roseanne Barr has publicly supported, phoned to congratulate her on the success of the premiere. Barr described the call as being &quot;pretty exciting&quot;, stating in an interview on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; that Trump &quot;really knows ratings and how they measure things&quot;. She commented that the show would continue to address current U.S. issues, hoping that it would &quot;[open] up civil conversation between people instead of just mudslinging.&quot;

=== Renewal, cancellation and firing of Barr ===
On March 30, 2018, &quot;Roseanne&quot; was renewed for an eleventh season of 13 episodes, following the success of the revival&#x27;s premiere night.

On May 29, 2018, Barr was terminated from the show after she posted a message on Twitter reading &quot;muslim brotherhood &amp; planet of the apes had a baby=vj.&quot; The tweet referred to Valerie Jarrett, an African-American woman who served as Senior Advisor to former U.S. president Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017. The &quot;ape&quot; tweet was widely criticized as racially insensitive. Series executive producer/showrunner Bruce Helford said he was &quot;personally horrified and saddened&quot; by Barr&#x27;s remarks, and show co-star/executive producer Sara Gilbert called them &quot;abhorrent&quot; and &quot;not reflective of the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show&quot;.

Barr&#x27;s behavior on Twitter had been considered a concern among ABC executives during the lead-up to the revival&#x27;s premiere, as she had a history of posting support for ideas such as QAnon and Pizzagate. The Jarrett posting was the culmination of several controversial tweets she had made that same morning, involving conspiracy theories about George Soros, including the factually inaccurate claim that Chelsea Clinton&#x27;s husband, Marc Mezvinsky, is a nephew of Soros, and that Soros wanted to &quot;overthrow the U.S. constitutional republic&quot; by backing district attorney candidates that would &quot;ignore US law &amp; favor &#x27;feelings&#x27; instead-and call everyone who is alarmed by that &#x27;racist, and claiming Soros, a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust, had been a Nazi in his youth. Barr&#x27;s ex-husband and original series recurring cast member Tom Arnold claimed he had notified ABC of Barr&#x27;s frequent controversial tweets similar to those she had made during the morning of May 29 that led to the network reversing its decision to renew the show.

In the wake of the posting, consulting producer/writer Wanda Sykes announced that she would no longer be involved with the program. Barr defended the tweet as being a &quot;joke&quot;, and stated in a subsequent post, &quot;ISLAM is not a RACE, lefties. Islam includes EVERY RACE of people&quot;. Barr later deleted the &quot;ape&quot; tweet and posted an apology, stating that she was &quot;truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks.&quot; In July 2018, Barr posted a video on her YouTube Channel attempting to explain the tweet by stating: &quot;I&#x27;m trying to talk about—Valerie Jarrett wrote the Iran deal! That&#x27;s what my tweet was about. I thought the bitch was white! Goddammit! I thought the bitch was white! Fuck!&quot;

ABC announced later in the day that it had reversed the renewal decision and canceled &quot;Roseanne&quot;; network president Channing Dungey stated that Barr&#x27;s remarks were &quot;abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values.&quot; ABC pulled a rerun that was scheduled to air that night, replacing it with an episode of &quot;The Middle&quot;, and suspended its campaign for the series to be considered for nomination at the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards.

Hulu announced it would remove all episodes of the original and revival series from its library; Viacom-owned cable channels Paramount Network, TV Land and CMT dropped the series from their lineups effective the following day, while digital multicast network Laff pulled reruns from its schedule effective immediately. In a tweet, co-star Emma Kenney revealed she was contacting her agent asking to quit the revival when she heard about the show&#x27;s cancellation, remarking that she felt &quot;empowered by @iamwandasykes, Channing Dungey and those at ABC standing up against abuse of power and lack of values. Bullies do not win. Ever.&quot;

The remarks also sparked a divide among conservatives who made up a substantial segment of the revival&#x27;s viewer base. Many deemed the cancellation an act of political correctness and an infringement of Barr&#x27;s rights to freedom of speech, while others (including Rick Wilson, Bret Baier, Tomi Lahren and Sean Hannity) condemned the remarks with some pointing out that none of her First Amendment rights were violated. ABC had heavily emphasized the success of &quot;Roseanne&quot; during its upfront presentations for the 2018–19 television season, leading to questions over possible repercussions for the network due to the loss of potential advertising revenue, and its plans for what would have been &quot;Roseanne&quot;″s time slot on the fall schedule.

Shortly before the cancellation was announced by ABC, Barr – who attributed the tweet about Jarrett and others made earlier that day to side effects from the sleep aid Ambien, a claim derided by many critics as well as by the drug&#x27;s manufacturer, Sanofi, in a public statement responding to Barr&#x27;s reasoning – apologized for the remarks, saying, &quot;I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans. I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me – my joke was in bad taste.&quot; Hours after the cancellation announcement, &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; later released a longer apology to Jarrett, the network and her show&#x27;s cast and crew: &quot;I deeply regret my comments from late last night on Twitter. Above all, I want to apologize to Valerie Jarrett, as well as to ABC and the cast and crew of the &quot;Roseanne&quot; show. I am sorry for making a thoughtless joke that does not reflect my values — I love all people and am very sorry. Today my words caused hundreds of hardworking people to lose their jobs. I also sincerely apologize to the audience that has embraced my work for decades. I apologize from the bottom of my heart and hope that you can find it in your hearts to forgive me.&quot; However, she would later retweet posts defending her, as well as another concerning the conspiracy theory of Soros being a Nazi collaborator.

=== &quot;The Conners&quot; ===

Some time after the cancellation was confirmed, some news sources announced that the show could possibly be re-tooled as a spin-off focusing on Sara Gilbert&#x27;s character of Darlene.

Around June 15, 2018, ABC was close to making a deal to indeed continue production as a Darlene-centric show, though it was also possible that it would be titled &quot;The Conners&quot; and star the whole family. The spin-off could only go forward assuming Barr signed a deal to give up rights to the show, meaning she wouldn&#x27;t be involved creatively or financially. Barr would likely receive a one-time payment in return. It was stated that, if the show returned, Barr&#x27;s racism scandal would be addressed on the show.

On June 21, 2018, ABC officially ordered a 10-episode spin-off titled &quot;The Conners&quot; (at first tentatively titled that, then officially), and that it would involve every original cast member except Barr. On August 28, 2018, this extended to Emma Kenney, Ames McNamara, and Jayden Rey from the tenth season, as they were all confirmed to return for the spinoff. Returning characters such as Beverly Harris (Estelle Parsons), David Healy (Johnny Galecki), Chuck Mitchell (James Pickens Jr.), and Crystal Anderson (Natalie West) were later confirmed. The series premiered on October 16, 2018.

== Ratings ==
&quot;Roseanne&quot; was successful from its beginning, ranking No. 1 in the Nielsen ratings during its second season (1989–90), narrowly beating out &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. Each of the series&#x27; first six seasons landed in the Nielsen ratings&#x27; top five. Ratings slowly started slipping after season six, though the show stayed within the top 10 through season seven, falling to the top 20 during season eight. &quot;Roseanne&quot; dropped to 35th place during the ninth and final season of its original run.

The premiere of the revival (season 10) set records for Nielsen&#x27;s delayed viewing metrics; it was seen by 18.45 million live and same day viewers, but gained an additional 6.59 viewers via Live+3 metrics—the largest-ever increase in total viewership from three days of delayed viewing since the 2014 premiere of fellow ABC series &quot;How to Get Away with Murder&quot;. 2.2 million additional viewers were added over the following four days (totaling 27.26 million viewers overall), resulting in a net increase of 8.81 million viewers in the week since the premiere broadcast. This established a record for the largest ratings gain from Live+7 viewership, previously set by the premiere of fellow ABC series &quot;The Good Doctor&quot; in September 2017. The tenth and final season ranked in the top 5 in the Nelson ratings.

== Syndication ==
&quot;Roseanne&quot; was put into off-network syndication beginning in September 1992.

TBS aired reruns of &quot;Roseanne&quot; from 1998 through 2003. Cable channel Nick at Nite aired reruns of the show from the fall of 2003 until 2009; it has since moved to TV Land&#x27;s &quot;TV Land Prime&quot; schedule. Oxygen aired reruns between 2003 and 2012; Carsey-Werner held an ownership stake in the channel before its 2007 acquisition by NBCUniversal. The show returned to Nick at Nite&#x27;s lineup on October 5, 2009, replacing &quot;Family Matters&quot; and &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; in its late-night timeslot. &quot;Roseanne&quot; left Nick at Nite on January 1, 2010. In Australia, the show aired on Network Ten and was later reran on 111 Hits and Eleven. In the UK, it aired on Channel 4 until 1999, and was also shown on The Paramount Channel.

WE tv and CMT both began airing the series in September 2012. The show also was carried by Nick at Nite/CMT sister network Logo TV, and over-the-air on Laff.

Viacom pulled the series from its networks in May 2018, concurrently with ABC&#x27;s cancellation, along with Laff. The series returned to CMT, Paramount Network and TV Land in October 2018 alongside the release of &quot;The Conners&quot; on ABC. It is available through Amazon Prime Video, Hoopla, and Pluto TV. Cozi TV premiered the show in January 2020, less than two years after the controversy.

== Awards and nominations ==
In 1993, Roseanne Barr and Laurie Metcalf both won Emmy Awards for their performances in the series, Barr for Outstanding Lead Actress and Metcalf for Outstanding Supporting Actress. Metcalf also won in 1992 and 1994. The series was nominated for 27 Emmys overall (including the revival), but, despite high critical praise and ratings throughout most of its run, it was never nominated for Best Comedy Series.

In 1993, Roseanne Barr and John Goodman both won Golden Globe Awards, Barr for Best Actress and Goodman for Best Actor. The series won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy.

The series won a Peabody Award in 1992 and a People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite New Television Comedy Program in 1989. Barr won five additional People&#x27;s Choice Awards for Favorite Female Performer in a New TV Program (1989), Favorite Female All Around Entertainer (1990), and Favorite Female TV Performer (1990, 1994, and 1995).

In 2008, the entire cast (except for Metcalf) reunited at the TV Land Awards to receive the Innovator Award. In their acceptance speech, they honored late cast member Glenn Quinn.

==Home media==
Anchor Bay Entertainment (later named Starz Home Entertainment, as shown on the DVD packaging for seasons 7–9) released all nine seasons on DVD in Region 1 (2005–2007) and Region 2. The first season was issued with shorter, syndicated versions of the episodes because Anchor Bay was unable to obtain permission to release the original broadcasts. This issue was rectified upon release of the first season DVD, and Anchor Bay went on to release seasons 2–7 in their original uncut form. However, for the eighth and ninth season DVDs, some scenes have been altered to avoid disputes over music rights, including substituting some closing credit scenes with a black screen, including the Patty Duke parody from Season 8, Episode 1.

On May 4, 2011, Mill Creek Entertainment announced that they had acquired the rights to re-release the series uncut on DVD in Region 1. They have subsequently re-released all nine seasons and a complete series set with the first seven seasons in their uncut form. Seasons 8 and 9 are still edited; while most of the music references were retained, some of the credit scenes are still missing.

In Germany, Universum Film has released the entire series on DVD, and released a complete series box set on July 3, 2009. Unlike the Anchor Bay releases, these were mostly unedited. Footage from &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; is excluded from an eighth-season episode, for unknown reasons.

In Australia and New Zealand, Magna Pacific has released all nine seasons on DVD in Region 4. Unlike the Anchor Bay releases, Magna Pacific&#x27;s first season DVDs include the full-length original broadcast episodes.

<text>Bêl (; from ) is a title signifying &#x27;lord&#x27; or &#x27;master&#x27; applied to various gods in the Mesopotamian religion of Akkad, Assyria, and Babylonia. The feminine form is &quot;Bêlit&quot; (&#x27;Lady, Mistress&#x27;) in Akkadian. &quot;Bel&quot; is represented in Greek as Belos and in Latin as Belus. &quot;Belit&quot; appears in Greek form as Beltis (Βελτις). Linguistically, &quot;Bel&quot; is an East Semitic form cognate with the Northwest Semitic Baal with the same meaning.

&quot;Bel&quot; was especially used for the Babylonian god Marduk in Assyrian and neo-Babylonian personal names or mentioned in inscriptions in a Mesopotamian context. Similarly, &quot;Bêlit&quot; mostly refers to Marduk&#x27;s spouse Sarpanit. Marduk&#x27;s mother, the Sumerian goddess often referred to in the Sumerian language as Ninhursag, Damkina, and Ninmah, was often known as &quot;Belit-ili&quot; (&#x27;Lady of the Gods&#x27;) in Akkadian.

Other gods called &quot;Lord&quot; were sometimes identified totally or in part with Bel Marduk. The god Malak-bel of Palmyra is an example, attested as a messenger of Bel but existing as a deity separate to Bel/Marduk. Similarly, Zeus Belus mentioned by Sanchuniathon as born to Cronus/El in Peraea is unlikely to be Marduk. Early translators of Akkadian believed that the ideogram for the god called &quot;Enlil&quot; in Sumerian was to be read as &quot;Bel&quot; in Akkadian. Current scholarship holds this as incorrect, but &quot;Bel&quot; is used in referring to Enlil in older translations and discussions.

In Mandaean cosmology, the name for Jupiter is &quot;Bil&quot; (), which is derived from the name Bel.

== Bel of Palmyra, Syria ==
A god named Bel was the chief-god of Palmyra, Syria in pre-Hellenistic times; the deity was worshipped alongside the gods Aglibol and Yarhibol. He was originally known as Bol, after the Northwestern Semitic word Ba&#x27;al (usually used to refer to the god Hadad), until the cult of Bel-Marduk spread to Palmyra; by 213 BC, Bol was renamed to Bel. The Temple of Bel in Palmrya, Syria was dedicated to this god. The temple has since been destroyed by ISIS.

<doc id="93806" wikidata="Q332088" url="?curid=93806" title="Miguel Hernández">
<text>Miguel Hernández Gilabert (30 October 1910 – 28 March 1942) was a 20th-century Spanish-language poet and playwright associated with the Generation of &#x27;27 and the Generation of &#x27;36 movements. Born and raised in a family of low resources, he was self-taught in what refers to literature, and struggled against an unfavourable environment to build up his intellectual education, such as a father who physically abused him for spending time with books instead of working, and who took him out of school as soon as he finished his primary education. At school, he became a friend of Ramón Sijé, a well-educated boy who lent and recommended books to Hernández, and whose death would inspire his most famous poem, &quot;Elegy&quot;.

Hernández died of tuberculosis, imprisoned due to his active participation on the Republican side of the civil war. His last book, &quot;Cancionero y romancero de ausencias&quot;, was published after his death, and is a collection of the poems he wrote in prison, some written in rudimentary pieces of toilet paper, others preserved in letters to his wife, is considered one of the finest pieces of Spanish poetry of the 20th century.

==Biography==
Hernández was born in Orihuela, Alicante, to a poor family and received little formal education; he published his first book of poetry at 23, and gained considerable fame before his death. He spent his childhood as a goatherd and farmhand, and was, for the most part, self-taught, although he did receive basic education from state schools and the Jesuits. He was introduced to literature by friend Ramón Sijé. As a youth, Hernández greatly admired the Spanish Baroque lyric poet Luis de Góngora, who was an influence in his early works. Shaped by both Golden Age writers such as Francisco de Quevedo and, like many Spanish poets of his era, by European vanguard movements, notably by surrealism, he joined a generation of socially conscious Spanish authors concerned with workers rights. Though Hernández employed novel images and concepts in his verses, he never abandoned classical, popular rhythms and rhymes. A member of the Communist Party of Spain, Hernández was a member of the Fifth Regiment at the start of the Spanish Civil War and served in the 11th Division during the Battle of Teruel. He campaigned for the Republic during the war, writing poetry and addressing troops deployed to the front.

During the Civil War, on the 9 March 1937, he married Josefina Manresa Marhuenda, whom he had met in 1933 in Orihuela. His wife inspired him to write most of his romantic work. Their first son, Manuel Ramón, was born on 19 December 1937 but died in infancy on 19 October 1938. Months later came their second son, Manuel Miguel (4 January 1939 – 1984). Josefina died on 18 February 1987 at age 71 in Elche, Alicante.

Unlike others, he could not escape Spain after the Republican surrender and was arrested multiple times after the war for his anti-fascist sympathies. He was tried in 1939, along with Eduardo de Guzmán and 27 others, accused of being a communist commissar and of writing poems harmful to the Francoist cause. He was eventually sentenced to death. His death sentence, however, was commuted to a prison term of 30 years, leading to incarceration in multiple jails under extraordinarily harsh conditions. He suffered pneumonia in Palencia prison, bronchitis in Ocaña prison and eventually succumbed to typhus and tuberculosis in 1942 in Alicante gaol. Just before his death, Hernández scrawled his last verse on the wall of the hospital: &quot;Goodbye, brothers, comrades, friends: let me take my leave of the sun and the fields.&quot; Some of his verses were kept by his jailers.

While in prison, Hernández produced an extraordinary amount of poetry, much of it in the form of simple songs, which the poet collected in his papers and sent to his wife and others. These poems are now known as his &quot;Cancionero y romancero de ausencia&quot; (&quot;Songs and Ballads of Absence&quot;). In these works, the poet writes not only of the tragedy of the Spanish Civil War and his own incarceration, but also of the death of an infant son and the struggle of his wife and another son to survive in poverty. The intensity and simplicity of the poems, combined with the extraordinary situation of the poet, give them remarkable power.

Perhaps Hernández&#x27;s best known poem is &quot;Nanas de la cebolla&quot; (&quot;Onion Lullaby&quot;), a reply in verse to a letter from his wife in which she informed him that she was surviving on bread and onions. In the poem, the poet envisions his son breastfeeding on his mother&#x27;s onion blood (&quot;sangre de cebolla&quot;), and uses the child&#x27;s laughter as a counterpoint to the mother&#x27;s desperation. In this as in other poems, the poet turns his wife&#x27;s body into a mythic symbol of desperation and hope, of regenerative power desperately needed in a broken Spain.

In July 2010 the poet&#x27;s family filed a lawsuit in the Spanish Supreme Court in which they asked for his guilty verdict (for his supposed crime of left wing sympathies), to be annulled. In 1939 he had been condemned to death as &quot;an extremely dangerous and despicable element to all good Spaniards.&quot; Franco later reduced the sentence so that he would not become an international martyr, as García Lorca did. In March 2010 the family had a posthumous &quot;declaration of reparation&quot; from the Spanish government, but, his daughter-in-law Lucía Izquierdo said: &quot;We want something more, that they void the death sentence.. that they hand down a ruling of innocent&quot;. Lawyers for the poet&#x27;s family had new evidence, a 1939 letter from a fascist military official, Juan Bellod, testifying to his innocence. &quot;I have known Miguel Hernández since he was a boy&quot;, the letter began. &quot;He is a person with an impeccable past, generous sentiments and deep religious and humanist training, but whose excessive sensitivity and poetic temperament have led him to act in accordance with the passion of the moment rather than calm, firm will. I fully guarantee his behaviour and his patriotic and religious fervour. I do not believe that he is, at heart, an enemy of our Glorious Movement&quot;.

<doc id="93807" wikidata="Q746478" url="?curid=93807" title="Synchronous dynamic random-access memory">
<text>Synchronous dynamic random-access memory (synchronous dynamic RAM or SDRAM) is any DRAM where the operation of its external pin interface is coordinated by an externally supplied clock signal.

DRAM integrated circuits (ICs) produced from the early 1970s to the early 1990s used an &quot;asynchronous&quot; interface, in which input control signals have a direct effect on internal functions delayed only by the trip across its semiconductor pathways. SDRAM has a &quot;synchronous&quot; interface, whereby changes on control inputs are recognised after a rising edge of its clock input. In SDRAM families standardized by JEDEC, the clock signal controls the stepping of an internal finite-state machine that responds to incoming commands. These commands can be pipelined to improve performance, with previously started operations completing while new commands are received. The memory is divided into several equally sized but independent sections called &quot;banks&quot;, allowing the device to operate on a memory access command in each bank simultaneously and speed up access in an interleaved fashion. This allows SDRAMs to achieve greater concurrency and higher data transfer rates than asynchronous DRAMs could.

Pipelining means that the chip can accept a new command before it has finished processing the previous one. For a pipelined write, the write command can be immediately followed by another command without waiting for the data to be written into the memory array. For a pipelined read, the requested data appears a fixed number of clock cycles (latency) after the read command, during which additional commands can be sent.

== History ==
The earliest DRAMs were often synchronized with the CPU clock (clocked) and were used with early microprocessors. In the mid-1970s, DRAMs moved to the asynchronous design, but in the 1990s returned to synchronous operation.

In the late 1980s IBM invented DDR SDRAM, they built a dual-edge clocking RAM and presented their results at the International Solid-State Circuits Convention in 1990. In 1998, Samsung released a double data rate SDRAM, known as DDR SDRAM, chip (64Mbit) followed soon after by Hyundai Electronics (now SK Hynix) the same year and mass-produced in 1993. By 2000, SDRAM had replaced virtually all other types of DRAM in modern computers, because of its greater performance.

SDRAM latency is not inherently lower (faster access times) than asynchronous DRAM. Indeed, early SDRAM was somewhat slower than contemporaneous burst EDO DRAM due to the additional logic. The benefits of SDRAM&#x27;s internal buffering come from its ability to interleave operations to multiple banks of memory, thereby increasing effective bandwidth.

Today, virtually all SDRAM is manufactured in compliance with standards established by JEDEC, an electronics industry association that adopts open standards to facilitate interoperability of electronic components. JEDEC formally adopted its first SDRAM standard in 1993 and subsequently adopted other SDRAM standards, including those for DDR, DDR2 and DDR3 SDRAM.

SDRAM is also available in registered varieties, for systems that require greater scalability such as servers and workstations.

Today, the world&#x27;s largest manufacturers of SDRAM include Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, Micron Technology, and Nanya Technology.

== Timing ==
There are several limits on DRAM performance. Most noted is the read cycle time, the time between successive read operations to an open row. This time decreased from 10 ns for 100 MHz SDRAM (1 MHz = formula_1 Hz) to 5 ns for DDR-400, but remained relatively unchanged through DDR2-800 and DDR3-1600 generations. However, by operating the interface circuitry at increasingly higher multiples of the fundamental read rate, the achievable bandwidth has increased rapidly.

Another limit is the CAS latency, the time between supplying a column address and receiving the corresponding data. Again, this has remained relatively constant at 10–15 ns through the last few generations of DDR SDRAM.

In operation, CAS latency is a specific number of clock cycles programmed into the SDRAM&#x27;s mode register and expected by the DRAM controller. Any value may be programmed, but the SDRAM will not operate correctly if it is too low. At higher clock rates, the useful CAS latency in clock cycles naturally increases. 10–15 ns is 2–3 cycles (CL2–3) of the 200 MHz clock of DDR-400 SDRAM, CL4-6 for DDR2-800, and CL8-12 for DDR3-1600. Slower clock cycles will naturally allow lower numbers of CAS latency cycles.

SDRAM modules have their own timing specifications, which may be slower than those of the chips on the module. When 100 MHz SDRAM chips first appeared, some manufacturers sold &quot;100 MHz&quot; modules that could not reliably operate at that clock rate. In response, Intel published the PC100 standard, which outlines requirements and guidelines for producing a memory module that can operate reliably at 100 MHz. This standard was widely influential, and the term &quot;PC100&quot; quickly became a common identifier for 100 MHz SDRAM modules, and modules are now commonly designated with &quot;PC&quot;-prefixed numbers (PC66, PC100 or PC133 - although the actual meaning of the numbers has changed).

== Control signals ==
All commands are timed relative to the rising edge of a clock signal. In addition to the clock, there are six control signals, mostly active low, which are sampled on the rising edge of the clock:
* CKE clock enable. When this signal is low, the chip behaves as if the clock has stopped. No commands are interpreted and command latency times do not elapse. The state of other control lines is not relevant. The effect of this signal is actually delayed by one clock cycle. That is, the current clock cycle proceeds as usual, but the following clock cycle is ignored, except for testing the CKE input again. Normal operations resume on the rising edge of the clock after the one where CKE is sampled high. Put another way, all other chip operations are timed relative to the rising edge of a masked clock. The masked clock is the logical AND of the input clock and the state of the CKE signal during the previous rising edge of the input clock.
* chip select. When this signal is high, the chip ignores all other inputs (except for CKE), and acts as if a NOP command is received.
* DQM data mask. (The letter &quot;Q&quot; appears because, following digital logic conventions, the data lines are known as &quot;DQ&quot; lines.) When high, these signals suppress data I/O. When accompanying write data, the data is not actually written to the DRAM. When asserted high two cycles before a read cycle, the read data is not output from the chip. There is one DQM line per 8 bits on a x16 memory chip or DIMM.

=== Command signals ===
* , row address strobe. Despite the name, this is &quot;not&quot; a strobe, but rather simply a command bit. Along with and , this selects one of eight commands.
* , column address strobe. This is also not a strobe, rather a command bit. Along with and , this selects one of eight commands.
* , write enable. Along with and , this selects one of eight commands. It generally distinguishes read-like commands from write-like commands.

=== Bank selection (BAn) ===
SDRAM devices are internally divided into either two, four or eight independent internal data banks. One to three bank address inputs (BA0, BA1 and BA2) are used to select which bank a command is directed toward.

=== Addressing (A10/An) ===
Many commands also use an address presented on the address input pins. Some commands, which either do not use an address, or present a column address, also use A10 to select variants.

=== Commands ===
The SDR SDRAM commands are defined as follows:

All SDRAM generations (SDR and DDRx) use essentially the same commands, with the changes being:
* Additional address bits to support larger devices
* Additional bank select bits
* Wider mode registers (DDR2 and up use 13 bits, A0–A12)
* Additional extended mode registers (selected by the bank address bits)
* DDR2 deletes the burst terminate command; DDR3 reassigns it as &quot;ZQ calibration&quot;
* DDR3 and DDR4 use A12 during read and write command to indicate &quot;burst chop&quot;, half-length data transfer
* DDR4 changes the encoding of the activate command. A new signal controls it, during which the other control lines are used as row address bits 16, 15 and 14. When is high, other commands are the same as above.

== Construction and operation==

As an example, a 512 MB SDRAM DIMM (which contains 512 MB), might be made of eight or nine SDRAM chips, each containing 512 Mbit of storage, and each one contributing 8 bits to the DIMM&#x27;s 64- or 72-bit width. A typical 512 Mbit SDRAM &quot;chip&quot; internally contains four independent 16 MB memory banks. Each bank is an array of 8,192 rows of 16,384 bits each. (2048 8-bit columns). A bank is either idle, active, or changing from one to the other.

The &quot;active&quot; command activates an idle bank. It presents a two-bit bank address (BA0–BA1) and a 13-bit row address (A0–A12), and causes a read of that row into the bank&#x27;s array of all 16,384 column sense amplifiers. This is also known as &quot;opening&quot; the row. This operation has the side effect of refreshing the dynamic (capacitive) memory storage cells of that row.

Once the row has been activated or &quot;opened&quot;, &quot;read&quot; and &quot;write&quot; commands are possible to that row. Activation requires a minimum amount of time, called the row-to-column delay, or tRCD before reads or writes to it may occur. This time, rounded up to the next multiple of the clock period, specifies the minimum number of wait cycles between an &quot;active&quot; command, and a &quot;read&quot; or &quot;write&quot; command. During these wait cycles, additional commands may be sent to other banks; because each bank operates completely independently.

Both &quot;read&quot; and &quot;write&quot; commands require a column address. Because each chip accesses eight bits of data at a time, there are 2,048 possible column addresses thus requiring only 11 address lines (A0–A9, A11).

When a &quot;read&quot; command is issued, the SDRAM will produce the corresponding output data on the DQ lines in time for the rising edge of the clock a few clock cycles later, depending on the configured CAS latency. Subsequent words of the burst will be produced in time for subsequent rising clock edges.

A &quot;write&quot; command is accompanied by the data to be written driven on to the DQ lines during the same rising clock edge. It is the duty of the memory controller to ensure that the SDRAM is not driving read data on to the DQ lines at the same time that it needs to drive write data on to those lines. This can be done by waiting until a read burst has finished, by terminating a read burst, or by using the DQM control line.

When the memory controller needs to access a different row, it must first return that bank&#x27;s sense amplifiers to an idle state, ready to sense the next row. This is known as a &quot;precharge&quot; operation, or &quot;closing&quot; the row. A precharge may be commanded explicitly, or it may be performed automatically at the conclusion of a read or write operation. Again, there is a minimum time, the row precharge delay, tRP, which must elapse before that row is fully &quot;closed&quot; and so the bank is idle in order to receive another activate command on that bank.

Although refreshing a row is an automatic side effect of activating it, there is a minimum time for this to happen, which requires a minimum row access time tRAS delay between an &quot;active&quot; command opening a row, and the corresponding precharge command closing it. This limit is usually dwarfed by desired read and write commands to the row, so its value has little effect on typical performance.

== Command interactions ==
The no operation command is always permitted, while the load mode register command requires that all banks be idle, and a delay afterward for the changes to take effect. The auto refresh command also requires that all banks be idle, and takes a refresh cycle time tRFC to return the chip to the idle state. (This time is usually equal to tRCD+tRP.) The only other command that is permitted on an idle bank is the active command. This takes, as mentioned above, tRCD before the row is fully open and can accept read and write commands.

When a bank is open, there are four commands permitted: read, write, burst terminate, and precharge. Read and write commands begin bursts, which can be interrupted by following commands.

=== Interrupting a read burst ===
A read, burst terminate, or precharge command may be issued at any time after a read command, and will interrupt the read burst after the configured CAS latency. So if a read command is issued on cycle 0, another read command is issued on cycle 2, and the CAS latency is 3, then the first read command will begin bursting data out during cycles 3 and 4, then the results from the second read command will appear beginning with cycle 5.

If the command issued on cycle 2 were burst terminate, or a precharge of the active bank, then no output would be generated during cycle 5.

Although the interrupting read may be to any active bank, a precharge command will only interrupt the read burst if it is to the same bank or all banks; a precharge command to a different bank will not interrupt a read burst.

Interrupting a read burst by a write command is possible, but more difficult. It can be done if the DQM signal is used to suppress output from the SDRAM so that the memory controller may drive data over the DQ lines to the SDRAM in time for the write operation. Because the effects of DQM on read data are delayed by two cycles, but the effects of DQM on write data are immediate, DQM must be raised (to mask the read data) beginning at least two cycles before write command but must be lowered for the cycle of the write command (assuming the write command is intended to have an effect).

Doing this in only two clock cycles requires careful coordination between the time the SDRAM takes to turn off its output on a clock edge and the time the data must be supplied as input to the SDRAM for the write on the following clock edge. If the clock frequency is too high to allow sufficient time, three cycles may be required.

If the read command includes auto-precharge, the precharge begins the same cycle as the interrupting command.

== Burst ordering ==
A modern microprocessor with a cache will generally access memory in units of cache lines. To transfer a 64-byte cache line requires eight consecutive accesses to a 64-bit DIMM, which can all be triggered by a single read or write command by configuring the SDRAM chips, using the mode register, to perform eight-word bursts. A cache line fetch is typically triggered by a read from a particular address, and SDRAM allows the &quot;critical word&quot; of the cache line to be transferred first. (&quot;Word&quot; here refers to the width of the SDRAM chip or DIMM, which is 64 bits for a typical DIMM.) SDRAM chips support two possible conventions for the ordering of the remaining words in the cache line.

Bursts always access an aligned block of BL consecutive words beginning on a multiple of BL. So, for example, a four-word burst access to any column address from four to seven will return words four to seven. The ordering, however, depends on the requested address, and the configured burst type option: sequential or interleaved. Typically, a memory controller will require one or the other. When the burst length is one or two, the burst type does not matter. For a burst length of one, the requested word is the only word accessed. For a burst length of two, the requested word is accessed first, and the other word in the aligned block is accessed second. This is the following word if an even address was specified, and the previous word if an odd address was specified.

For the sequential burst mode, later words are accessed in increasing address order, wrapping back to the start of the block when the end is reached. So, for example, for a burst length of four, and a requested column address of five, the words would be accessed in the order 5-6-7-4. If the burst length were eight, the access order would be 5-6-7-0-1-2-3-4. This is done by adding a counter to the column address, and ignoring carries past the burst length. The interleaved burst mode computes the address using an exclusive or operation between the counter and the address. Using the same starting address of five, a four-word burst would return words in the order 5-4-7-6. An eight-word burst would be 5-4-7-6-1-0-3-2. Although more confusing to humans, this can be easier to implement in hardware, and is preferred by Intel for its microprocessors.

If the requested column address is at the start of a block, both burst modes (sequential and interleaved) return data in the same sequential sequence 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7. The difference only matters if fetching a cache line from memory in critical-word-first order.

== Mode register ==
Single data rate SDRAM has a single 10-bit programmable mode register. Later double-data-rate SDRAM standards add additional mode registers, addressed using the bank address pins. For SDR SDRAM, the bank address pins and address lines A10 and above are ignored, but should be zero during a mode register write.

The bits are M9 through M0, presented on address lines A9 through A0 during a load mode register cycle.
* M9: Write burst mode. If 0, writes use the read burst length and mode. If 1, all writes are non-burst (single location).
* M8, M7: Operating mode. Reserved, and must be 00.
* M6, M5, M4: CAS latency. Generally only 010 (CL2) and 011 (CL3) are legal. Specifies the number of cycles between a read command and data output from the chip. The chip has a fundamental limit on this value in nanoseconds; during initialization, the memory controller must use its knowledge of the clock frequency to translate that limit into cycles.
* M3: Burst type. 0 - requests sequential burst ordering, while 1 requests interleaved burst ordering.
* M2, M1, M0: Burst length. Values of 000, 001, 010 and 011 specify a burst size of 1, 2, 4 or 8 words, respectively. Each read (and write, if M9 is 0) will perform that many accesses, unless interrupted by a burst stop or other command. A value of 111 specifies a full-row burst. The burst will continue until interrupted. Full-row bursts are only permitted with the sequential burst type.

Later (double data rate) SDRAM standards use more mode register bits, and provide additional mode registers called &quot;extended mode registers&quot;. The register number is encoded on the bank address pins during the load mode register command. For example, DDR2 SDRAM has a 13-bit mode register, a 13-bit extended mode register No. 1 (EMR1), and a 5-bit extended mode register No. 2 (EMR2).

== Auto refresh ==
It is possible to refresh a RAM chip by opening and closing (activating and precharging) each row in each bank. However, to simplify the memory controller, SDRAM chips support an &quot;auto refresh&quot; command, which performs these operations to one row in each bank simultaneously. The SDRAM also maintains an internal counter, which iterates over all possible rows. The memory controller must simply issue a sufficient number of auto refresh commands (one per row, 8192 in the example we have been using) every refresh interval (tREF = 64 ms is a common value). All banks must be idle (closed, precharged) when this command is issued.

== Low power modes ==
As mentioned, the clock enable (CKE) input can be used to effectively stop the clock to an SDRAM. The CKE input is sampled each rising edge of the clock, and if it is low, the following rising edge of the clock is ignored for all purposes other than checking CKE. As long as CKE is low, it is permissible to change the clock rate, or even stop the clock entirely.

If CKE is lowered while the SDRAM is performing operations, it simply &quot;freezes&quot; in place until CKE is raised again.

If the SDRAM is idle (all banks precharged, no commands in progress) when CKE is lowered, the SDRAM automatically enters power-down mode, consuming minimal power until CKE is raised again. This must not last longer than the maximum refresh interval tREF, or memory contents may be lost. It is legal to stop the clock entirely during this time for additional power savings.

Finally, if CKE is lowered at the same time as an auto-refresh command is sent to the SDRAM, the SDRAM enters self-refresh mode. This is like power down, but the SDRAM uses an on-chip timer to generate internal refresh cycles as necessary. The clock may be stopped during this time. While self-refresh mode consumes slightly more power than power-down mode, it allows the memory controller to be disabled entirely, which commonly more than makes up the difference.

SDRAM designed for battery-powered devices offers some additional power-saving options. One is temperature-dependent refresh; an on-chip temperature sensor reduces the refresh rate at lower temperatures, rather than always running it at the worst-case rate. Another is selective refresh, which limits self-refresh to a portion of the DRAM array. The fraction which is refreshed is configured using an extended mode register. The third, implemented in Mobile DDR (LPDDR) and LPDDR2 is &quot;deep power down&quot; mode, which invalidates the memory and requires a full reinitialization to exit from. This is activated by sending a &quot;burst terminate&quot; command while lowering CKE.

== DDR SDRAM prefetch architecture==
DDR SDRAM employs prefetch architecture to allow quick and easy access to multiple data words located on a common physical row in the memory.

The prefetch architecture takes advantage of the specific characteristics of memory accesses to DRAM. Typical DRAM memory operations involve three phases: bitline precharge, row access, column access. Row access is the heart of a read operation, as it involves the careful sensing of the tiny signals in DRAM memory cells; it is the slowest phase of memory operation. However, once a row is read, subsequent column accesses to that same row can be very quick, as the sense amplifiers also act as latches. For reference, a row of a 1 Gbit DDR3 device is 2,048 bits wide, so internally 2,048 bits are read into 2,048 separate sense amplifiers during the row access phase. Row accesses might take 50 ns, depending on the speed of the DRAM, whereas column accesses off an open row are less than 10 ns.

Traditional DRAM architectures have long supported fast column access to bits on an open row. For an 8-bit-wide memory chip with a 2,048 bit wide row, accesses to any of the 256 datawords (2048/8) on the row can be very quick, provided no intervening accesses to other rows occur.

The drawback of the older fast column access method was that a new column address had to be sent for each additional dataword on the row. The address bus had to operate at the same frequency as the data bus. Prefetch architecture simplifies this process by allowing a single address request to result in multiple data words.

In a prefetch buffer architecture, when a memory access occurs to a row the buffer grabs a set of adjacent data words on the row and reads them out (&quot;bursts&quot; them) in rapid-fire sequence on the IO pins, without the need for individual column address requests. This assumes the CPU wants adjacent datawords in memory, which in practice is very often the case. For instance, in DDR1, two adjacent data words will be read from each chip in the same clock cycle and placed in the pre-fetch buffer. Each word will then be transmitted on consecutive rising and falling edges of the clock cycle. Similarly, in DDR2 with a 4n pre-fetch buffer, four consecutive data words are read and placed in buffer while a clock, which is twice faster than the internal clock of DDR, transmits each of the word in consecutive rising and falling edge of the faster external clock 

The prefetch buffer depth can also be thought of as the ratio between the core memory frequency and the IO frequency. In an 8n prefetch architecture (such as DDR3), the IOs will operate 8 times faster than the memory core (each memory access results in a burst of 8 datawords on the IOs). Thus, a 200 MHz memory core is combined with IOs that each operate eight times faster (1600 megabits per second). If the memory has 16 IOs, the total read bandwidth would be 200 MHz x 8 datawords/access x 16 IOs = 25.6 gigabits per second (Gbit/s) or 3.2 gigabytes per second (GB/s). Modules with multiple DRAM chips can provide correspondingly higher bandwidth.

Each generation of SDRAM has a different prefetch buffer size:

* DDR SDRAM&#x27;s prefetch buffer size is 2n (two datawords per memory access)
* DDR2 SDRAM&#x27;s prefetch buffer size is 4n (four datawords per memory access)
* DDR3 SDRAM&#x27;s prefetch buffer size is 8n (eight datawords per memory access)
* DDR4 SDRAM&#x27;s prefetch buffer size is 8n (eight datawords per memory access)
* DDR5 SDRAM&#x27;s prefetch buffer size is 8n; there is an additional mode of 16n

== Generations ==
=== SDR ===
Originally simply known as &quot;SDRAM&quot;, single data rate SDRAM can accept one command and transfer one word of data per clock cycle. Chips are made with a variety of data bus sizes (most commonly 4, 8 or 16 bits), but chips are generally assembled into 168-pin DIMMs that read or write 64 (non-ECC) or 72 (ECC) bits at a time.

Use of the data bus is intricate and thus requires a complex DRAM controller circuit. This is because data written to the DRAM must be presented in the same cycle as the write command, but reads produce output 2 or 3 cycles after the read command. The DRAM controller must ensure that the data bus is never required for a read and a write at the same time.

Typical SDR SDRAM clock rates are 66, 100, and 133 MHz (periods of 15, 10, and 7.5 ns), respectively denoted PC66, PC100, and PC133. Clock rates up to 200 MHz were available. It operates at a voltage of 3.3 V.

This type of SDRAM is slower than the DDR variants, because only one word of data is transmitted per clock cycle (single data rate). But this type is also faster than its predecessors extended data out DRAM (EDO-RAM) and fast page mode DRAM (FPM-RAM) which took typically two or three clocks to transfer one word of data.

==== PC66 ====
PC66 refers to internal removable computer memory standard defined by the JEDEC. PC66 is Synchronous DRAM operating at a clock frequency of 66.66 MHz, on a 64-bit bus, at a voltage of 3.3 V. PC66 is available in 168-pin DIMM and 144-pin SO-DIMM form factors. The theoretical bandwidth is 533 MB/s. (1 MB/s = one million bytes per second)

This standard was used by Intel Pentium and AMD K6-based PCs. It also features in the Beige Power Mac G3, early iBooks and PowerBook G3s. It is also used in many early Intel Celeron systems with a 66 MHz FSB. It was superseded by the PC100 and PC133 standards.

==== PC100 ====
PC100 is a standard for internal removable computer random-access memory, defined by the JEDEC. PC100 refers to Synchronous DRAM operating at a clock frequency of 100 MHz, on a 64-bit-wide bus, at a voltage of 3.3 V. PC100 is available in 168-pin DIMM and 144-pin SO-DIMM form factors. PC100 is backward compatible with PC66 and was superseded by the PC133 standard.

A module built out of 100 MHz SDRAM chips is not necessarily capable of operating at 100 MHz. The PC100 standard specifies the capabilities of the memory module as a whole. PC100 is used in many older computers; PCs around the late 1990s were the most common computers with PC100 memory.

==== PC133 ====
PC133 is a computer memory standard defined by the JEDEC. PC133 refers to SDR SDRAM operating at a clock frequency of 133 MHz, on a 64-bit-wide bus, at a voltage of 3.3 V. PC133 is available in 168-pin DIMM and 144-pin SO-DIMM form factors. PC133 is the fastest and final SDR SDRAM standard ever approved by the JEDEC, and delivers a bandwidth of 1.066 GB per second ([133.33 MHz * 64/8]=1.066 GB/s). (1 GB/s = one billion bytes per second) PC133 is backward compatible with PC100 and PC66.

=== DDR ===
While the access latency of DRAM is fundamentally limited by the DRAM array, DRAM has very high potential bandwidth because each internal read is actually a row of many thousands of bits. To make more of this bandwidth available to users, a double data rate interface was developed. This uses the same commands, accepted once per cycle, but reads or writes two words of data per clock cycle. The DDR interface accomplishes this by reading and writing data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal. In addition, some minor changes to the SDR interface timing were made in hindsight, and the supply voltage was reduced from 3.3 to 2.5 V. As a result, DDR SDRAM is not backwards compatible with SDR SDRAM.

DDR SDRAM (sometimes called &quot;DDR1&quot; for greater clarity) doubles the minimum read or write unit; every access refers to at least two consecutive words.

Typical DDR SDRAM clock rates are 133, 166 and 200 MHz (7.5, 6, and 5 ns/cycle), generally described as DDR-266, DDR-333 and DDR-400 (3.75, 3, and 2.5 ns per beat). Corresponding 184-pin DIMMs are known as PC-2100, PC-2700 and PC-3200. Performance up to DDR-550 (PC-4400) is available.

=== DDR2 ===
DDR2 SDRAM is very similar to DDR SDRAM, but doubles the minimum read or write unit again, to four consecutive words. The bus protocol was also simplified to allow higher performance operation. (In particular, the &quot;burst terminate&quot; command is deleted.) This allows the bus rate of the SDRAM to be doubled without increasing the clock rate of internal RAM operations; instead, internal operations are performed in units four times as wide as SDRAM. Also, an extra bank address pin (BA2) was added to allow eight banks on large RAM chips.

Typical DDR2 SDRAM clock rates are 200, 266, 333 or 400 MHz (periods of 5, 3.75, 3 and 2.5 ns), generally described as DDR2-400, DDR2-533, DDR2-667 and DDR2-800 (periods of 2.5, 1.875, 1.5 and 1.25 ns). Corresponding 240-pin DIMMs are known as PC2-3200 through PC2-6400. DDR2 SDRAM is now available at a clock rate of 533 MHz generally described as DDR2-1066 and the corresponding DIMMs are known as PC2-8500 (also named PC2-8600 depending on the manufacturer). Performance up to DDR2-1250 (PC2-10000) is available.

Note that because internal operations are at 1/2 the clock rate, DDR2-400 memory (internal clock rate 100 MHz) has somewhat higher latency than DDR-400 (internal clock rate 200 MHz).

=== DDR3 ===
DDR3 continues the trend, doubling the minimum read or write unit to eight consecutive words. This allows another doubling of bandwidth and external bus rate without having to change the clock rate of internal operations, just the width. To maintain 800–1600 M transfers/s (both edges of a 400–800 MHz clock), the internal RAM array has to perform 100–200 M fetches per second.

Again, with every doubling, the downside is the increased latency. As with all DDR SDRAM generations, commands are still restricted to one clock edge and command latencies are given in terms of clock cycles, which are half the speed of the usually quoted transfer rate (a CAS latency of 8 with DDR3-800 is 8/(400 MHz) = 20 ns, exactly the same latency of CAS2 on PC100 SDR SDRAM).

DDR3 memory chips are being made commercially, and computer systems using them were available from the second half of 2007, with significant usage from 2008 onwards. Initial clock rates were 400 and 533 MHz, which are described as DDR3-800 and DDR3-1066 (PC3-6400 and PC3-8500 modules), but 667 and 800 MHz, described as DDR3-1333 and DDR3-1600 (PC3-10600 and PC3-12800 modules) are now common. Performance up to DDR3-2800 (PC3 22400 modules) are available.

=== DDR4 ===
DDR4 SDRAM is the successor to DDR3 SDRAM. It was revealed at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco in 2008, and was due to be released to market during 2011. The timing varied considerably during its development - it was originally expected to be released in 2012, and later (during 2010) expected to be released in 2015, before samples were announced in early 2011 and manufacturers began to announce that commercial production and release to market was anticipated in 2012. DDR4 reached mass market adoption around 2015, which is comparable with the approximately five years taken for DDR3 to achieve mass market transition over DDR2.

The DDR4 chips run at 1.2 V or less, compared to the 1.5 V of DDR3 chips, and have in excess of 2 billion data transfers per second. They were expected to be introduced at frequency rates of 2133 MHz, estimated to rise to a potential 4266 MHz and lowered voltage of 1.05 V by 2013.

DDR4 did &quot;not&quot; double the internal prefetch width again, but uses the same 8&quot;n&quot; prefetch as DDR3. Thus, it will be necessary to interleave reads from several banks to keep the data bus busy.

In February 2009, Samsung validated 40 nm DRAM chips, considered a &quot;significant step&quot; towards DDR4 development since, as of 2009, current DRAM chips were only beginning to migrate to a 50 nm process. In January 2011, Samsung announced the completion and release for testing of a 30 nm 2048 MB DDR4 DRAM module. It has a maximum bandwidth of 2.13 Gbit/s at 1.2 V, uses pseudo open drain technology and draws 40% less power than an equivalent DDR3 module.

=== DDR5 ===
In March 2017, JEDEC announced a DDR5 standard is under development, but provided no details except for the goals of doubling the bandwidth of DDR4, reducing power consumption, and publishing the standard in 2018. The standard was released on 14 July 2020.

== Failed successors ==
In addition to DDR, there were several other proposed memory technologies to succeed SDR SDRAM.

=== Rambus DRAM (RDRAM) ===
RDRAM was a proprietary technology that competed against DDR. Its relatively high price and disappointing performance (resulting from high latencies and a narrow 16-bit data channel versus DDR&#x27;s 64 bit channel) caused it to lose the race to succeed SDR SDRAM.

=== Synchronous-link DRAM (SLDRAM) ===
SLDRAM boasted higher performance and competed against RDRAM. It was developed during the late 1990s by the SLDRAM Consortium. The SLDRAM Consortium consisted of about 20 major DRAM and computer industry manufacturers. (The SLDRAM Consortium became incorporated as SLDRAM Inc. and then changed its name to Advanced Memory International, Inc.) SLDRAM was an open standard and did not require licensing fees. The specifications called for a 64-bit bus running at a 200, 300 or 400 MHz clock frequency. This is achieved by all signals being on the same line and thereby avoiding the synchronization time of multiple lines. Like DDR SDRAM, SLDRAM uses a double-pumped bus, giving it an effective speed of 400, 600, or 800 MT/s. (1 MT/s = 1000^2 transfers per second)

SLDRAM used an 11-bit command bus (10 command bits CA9:0 plus one start-of-command FLAG line) to transmit 40-bit command packets on 4 consecutive edges of a differential command clock (CCLK/CCLK#). Unlike SDRAM, there were no per-chip select signals; each chip was assigned an ID when reset, and the command contained the ID of the chip that should process it. Data was transferred in 4- or 8-word bursts across an 18-bit (per chip) data bus, using one of two differential data clocks (DCLK0/DCLK0# and DCLK1/DCLK1#). Unlike standard SDRAM, the clock was generated by the data source (the SLDRAM chip in the case of a read operation) and transmitted in the same direction as the data, greatly reducing data skew. To avoid the need for a pause when the source of the DCLK changes, each command specified which DCLK pair it would use.

The basic read/write command consisted of (beginning with CA9 of the first word):
* 9 bits of device ID
* 6 bits of command
* 3 bits of bank address
* 10 or 11 bits of row address
* 5 or 4 bits spare for row or column expansion
* 7 bits of column address

Individual devices had 8-bit IDs. The 9th bit of the ID sent in commands was used to address multiple devices. Any aligned power-of-2 sized group could be addressed. If the transmitted msbit was set, all least-significant bits up to and including the least-significant 0 bit of the transmitted address were ignored for &quot;is this addressed to me?&quot; purposes. (If the ID8 bit is actually considered less significant than ID0, the unicast address matching becomes a special case of this pattern.)

A read/write command had the msbit clear:
* CMD5=0
* CMD4=1 to open (activate) the specified row; CMD4=0 to use the currently open row
* CMD3=1 to transfer an 8-word burst; CMD3=0 for a 4-word burst
* CMD2=1 for a write, CMD2=0 for a read
* CMD1=1 to close the row after this access; CMD1=0 to leave it open
* CMD0 selects the DCLK pair to use (DCLK1 or DCLK0)

A notable omission from the specification was per-byte write enables; it was designed for systems with caches and ECC memory, which always write in multiples of a cache line.

Additional commands (with CMD5 set) opened and closed rows without a data transfer, performed refresh operations, read or wrote configuration registers, and performed other maintenance operations. Most of these commands supported an additional 4-bit sub-ID (sent as 5 bits, using the same multiple-destination encoding as the primary ID) which could be used to distinguish devices that were assigned the same primary ID because they were connected in parallel and always read/written at the same time.

There were a number of 8-bit control registers and 32-bit status registers to control various device timing parameters.

=== Virtual channel memory (VCM) SDRAM ===
VCM was a proprietary type of SDRAM that was designed by NEC, but released as an open standard with no licensing fees. It is pin-compatible with standard SDRAM, but the commands are different. The technology was a potential competitor of RDRAM because VCM was not nearly as expensive as RDRAM was. A Virtual Channel Memory (VCM) module is mechanically and electrically compatible with standard SDRAM, so support for both depends only on the capabilities of the memory controller. In the late 1990s, a number of PC northbridge chipsets (such as the popular VIA KX133 and KT133) included VCSDRAM support.

VCM inserts an SRAM cache of 16 &quot;channel&quot; buffers, each 1/4 row &quot;segment&quot; in size, between DRAM banks&#x27; sense amplifier rows and the data I/O pins. &quot;Prefetch&quot; and &quot;restore&quot; commands, unique to VCSDRAM, copy data between the DRAM&#x27;s sense amplifier row and the channel buffers, while the equivalent of SDRAM&#x27;s read and write commands specify a channel number to access. Reads and writes may thus be performed independent of the currently active state of the DRAM array, with the equivalent of four full DRAM rows being &quot;open&quot; for access at a time. This is an improvement over the two open rows possible in a standard two-bank SDRAM. (There is actually a 17th &quot;dummy channel&quot; used for some operations.)

To read from VCSDRAM, after the active command, a &quot;prefetch&quot; command is required to copy data from the sense amplifier array to the channel SDRAM. This command specifies a bank, two bits of column address (to select the segment of the row), and four bits of channel number. Once this is performed, the DRAM array may be precharged while read commands to the channel buffer continue. To write, first the data is written to a channel buffer (typically previous initialized using a Prefetch command), then a restore command, with the same parameters as the prefetch command, copies a segment of data from the channel to the sense amplifier array.

Unlike a normal SDRAM write, which must be performed to an active (open) row, the VCSDRAM bank must be precharged (closed) when the restore command is issued. An active command immediately after the restore command specifies the DRAM row completes the write to the DRAM array. There is, in addition, a 17th &quot;dummy channel&quot; which allows writes to the currently open row. It may not be read from, but may be prefetched to, written to, and restored to the sense amplifier array.

Although normally a segment is restored to the same memory address as it was prefetched from, the channel buffers may also be used for very efficient copying or clearing of large, aligned memory blocks. (The use of quarter-row segments is driven by the fact that DRAM cells are narrower than SRAM cells.) The SRAM bits are designed to be four DRAM bits wide, and are conveniently connected to one of the four DRAM bits they straddle.) Additional commands prefetch a pair of segments to a pair of channels, and an optional command combines prefetch, read, and precharge to reduce the overhead of random reads.

The above are the JEDEC-standardized commands. Earlier chips did not support the dummy channel or pair prefetch, and use a different encoding for precharge.

A 13-bit address bus, as illustrated here, is suitable for a device up to 128 Mbit. It has two banks, each containing 8,192 rows and 8,192 columns. Thus, row addresses are 13 bits, segment addresses are two bits, and eight column address bits are required to select one byte from the 2,048 bits (256 bytes) in a segment.

== Synchronous Graphics RAM (SGRAM) ==
Synchronous graphics RAM (SGRAM) is a specialized form of SDRAM for graphics adaptors. It is designed for graphics-related tasks such as texture memory and framebuffers, found on video cards. It adds functions such as bit masking (writing to a specified bit plane without affecting the others) and block write (filling a block of memory with a single colour). Unlike VRAM and WRAM, SGRAM is single-ported. However, it can open two memory pages at once, which simulates the dual-port nature of other video RAM technologies.

The earliest known SGRAM memory are 8Mbit chips dating back to 1994: the Hitachi HM5283206, introduced in November 1994, and the NEC μPD481850, introduced in December 1994. The earliest known commercial device to use SGRAM is Sony&#x27;s PlayStation (PS) video game console, starting with the Japanese SCPH-5000 model released in December 1995, using the NEC μPD481850 chip.

=== Graphics double data rate SDRAM (GDDR SDRAM) ===
Graphics double data rate SDRAM (GDDR SDRAM) is a type of specialized DDR SDRAM designed to be used as the main memory of graphics processing units (GPUs). GDDR SDRAM is distinct from commodity types of DDR SDRAM such as DDR3, although they share some core technologies. Their primary characteristics are higher clock frequencies for both the DRAM core and I/O interface, which provides greater memory bandwidth for GPUs. As of 2025, there are nine successive generations of GDDR: GDDR2, GDDR3, GDDR4, GDDR5, GDDR5X, GDDR6, GDDR6X, GDDR6W, and GDDR7.

GDDR was initially known as DDR SGRAM. It was commercially introduced as a 16Mbit memory chip by Samsung Electronics in 1998.

== High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) ==
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is a high-performance RAM interface for 3D-stacked SDRAM from Samsung, AMD and SK Hynix. It is designed to be used in conjunction with high-performance graphics accelerators and network devices. The first HBM memory chip was produced by SK Hynix in 2013.

<doc id="93809" wikidata="Q185101" url="?curid=93809" title="Hamilcar Barca">
<text>Hamilcar Barca or Barcas (; – 228BC) was a Carthaginian general and statesman, leader of the Barcid family, and father of Hannibal, Hasdrubal and Mago. He was also father-in-law to Hasdrubal the Fair.

Hamilcar commanded the Carthaginian land forces in Sicily from 247BC to 241BC, during the latter stages of the First Punic War. He kept his army intact and led a successful guerrilla war against the Romans in Sicily. Hamilcar retired to Carthage after the peace treaty in 241BC, following the defeat of Carthage. When the Mercenary War broke out in 239BC, Hamilcar was recalled to command and was instrumental in concluding that conflict successfully. Hamilcar commanded the Carthaginian expedition to Spain in 237BC, and for eight years expanded the territory of Carthage in Spain before dying in battle in 228 BC. He may have been responsible for creating the strategy which his son Hannibal implemented in the Second Punic War to bring the Roman Republic close to defeat.

==Name==

Hamilcar is the latinization of &quot;Hamílkas&quot; (), the hellenized form of the common Semitic Phoenician-Carthaginian masculine given name () or (), meaning &quot;Melqart&#x27;s brother&quot;.

The cognomen or epithet  () means &quot;thunderbolt&quot; or &quot;shining&quot;. It is cognate with the Arabic name Barq, Maltese word Berqa, the Assyrian Neo-Aramaic name Barkho, and the Hebrew name Barak and equivalent to the Greek &quot;Keraunos&quot;, which was borne by many commanders contemporary with Hamilcar and his son Hannibal.

==Early life==
Little is known about the origins or history of the Barca family prior to the Punic Wars. According to the Dictionary of African Biography, it has been suggested that the Barca family originally came from Cyrene, i.e., modern-day Libya. Lance Serge states that Hamilcar&#x27;s family was part of the landed aristocracy of Carthage. Hamilcar was 28 when he received the Sicilian command in 247 BC. By this time he had three daughters, and his son Hannibal was born during the same year.

===Situation in Sicily===
The war, which had started in 264 BC, continued after the Romans abandoned Africa; neither side gained a decisive advantage until 249 BC. The Romans rebuilt their fleet after losing 364 ships in a storm in 255 BC, added 220 new ships, and captured Panormus (modern Palermo) in 254 BC; 150 ships were lost in another storm in 253 BC. The Romans had occupied most of Sicily by 249 BC and they besieged the last two Carthaginian strongholdsin the extreme west. The situation changed when the surprise attack on the Carthaginian fleet met defeat at the Battle of Drepana and the following Carthaginian victory at the Battle of Phintias; the Romans were all but swept from the sea. It was to be seven years before Rome again attempted to field a substantial fleet.

The Carthaginians had gained command of the sea after their victories in 249 BC, but they only held two cities in Sicily: Lilybaeum and Drepanum by the time Hamilcar took up command. The Carthaginian state was led by the landed aristocracy at the time, and they preferred to expand across northern Africa instead of pursuing an aggressive policy in Sicily. Hanno &quot;The Great&quot; was in charge of operations in Africa since 248 BC and had conquered considerable territory by 241 BC. Carthage did not take advantage of their naval supremacy and carry the war to Italy other than launching a few raids.

Carthage at this time was feeling the strain of the prolonged conflict. In addition to maintaining a fleet and soldiers in Sicily, they were also fighting the Libyans and Numidians in northern Africa. As a result, Hamilcar was given a fairly small army and the Carthaginian fleet was gradually withdrawn; Carthage put most of its ships into reserve to save money and free up manpower, so by 242 BC, Carthage had no ships to speak of in Sicily.

==Hamilcar in Sicily==

The Carthaginian leadership probably thought Rome had been defeated and invested little manpower in Sicily. With a small force and no money to hire new troops, Hamilcar&#x27;s strategic goal probably was to maintain a stalemate, as he had neither the resources to win the war nor the authority to peacefully settle it. Hamilcar was in command of a mercenary army composed of multiple nationalities and his ability to successfully lead this force demonstrates his skill as field commander. He employed combined arms tactics, like Alexander and Pyrrhus, and his strategy was similar to the one employed by Fabius Maximus during the Second Punic War, ironically against Hannibal, Hamilcar&#x27;s eldest son. The difference was that Fabius commanded a numerically superior army to his opponent, had no supply problems, and had room to manoeuvre, while Hamilcar was mostly static, had a far smaller army than the Romans and was dependent on seaborne supplies from Carthage.

=== Panormus 247 BC – 244 BC ===
Hamilcar, upon taking command in the summer of 247 BC, punished the rebellious mercenaries (who had revolted because of overdue payments) by murdering some of them at night and drowning the rest at sea, and dismissing many to different parts of northern Africa. With a reduced army and fleet, Hamilcar commenced his operations. The Romans had divided their forces: Consul Lucius Caelius Metellus was near Lilybaeum, while Numerius Fabius Buteo was besieging Drepanum at that time. Hamilcar probably fought an inconclusive battle at Drepanum, but there is cause to doubt this.

Hamilcar next raided Locri in Bruttium and the area around Brindisi in 247 BC. On his return he seized a strong position on Mount Ercte (Monte Pellegrino, just north of Palermo or Mt. Castellacio, 7 miles north-west of Palermo), and not only maintained himself against all attacks, but carried on with his seaborne raids ranging from Catana in Sicily to as far as Cumae in central Italy. He also set about improving the spirit of the army, and succeeded in creating a highly disciplined and versatile force. While Hamilcar won no large-scale battle or recaptured any cities lost to the Romans, he waged a relentless campaign against the enemy, and caused a constant drain on Roman resources. However, if Hamilcar had hoped to recapture Panormus, he failed in his strategy. Roman forces led by the consuls Manius Otacilius Crassus and Marcus Fabius Licinus achieved little against Hamilcar in 246 BC, and the consuls of 245 BC, Marcus Fabius Buteo and Atilius Bulbus, fared no better.

=== Eryx 244 BC – 241 BC ===

In 244 BC, Hamilcar transferred his army at night by sea to a similar position on the slopes of Mt. Eryx (Monte San Giuliano), from which he was able to lend support to the besieged garrison in the neighbouring town of Drepanum (Trapani). Hamilcar seized the town of Eryx, captured by the Romans in 249 BC, after destroying the Roman garrison, and positioned his army between the Roman forces stationed at the summit and their camp at the base of the mountain. He removed the population to Drepana. Hamilcar continued his activities unhindered from his position for another two years, being supplied by road from Drepana, although Carthaginian ships had been withdrawn from Sicily by this time and no naval raids were launched. During one of the raids, when troops under a subordinate commander named Bodostor engaged in plunder against the orders of Hamilcar and suffered severe casualties when the Romans caught up to them, Hamilcar requested a truce to bury his dead. Roman consul Fundanius (243/2 BC) arrogantly replied that Hamilcar should request a truce to save his living and denied the request. Hamilcar managed to inflict severe casualties on the Romans soon after, and when the Roman consul requested a truce to bury his dead, Hamilcar replied that his quarrel was with the living only and the dead had already settled their dues, and granted the truce.

The actions of Hamilcar, and his immunity to defeat, plus the stalemate at the siege of Lilybaeum caused the Romans to start building a fleet in 243 BC to seek a decision at sea. However, the constant skirmishing without ultimate victory may have caused the morale of some of Hamilcar&#x27;s troops to crack and 1,000 Celtic mercenaries tried to betray the Punic camp to the Romans, which was foiled. Hamilcar had to promise considerable rewards to keep the morale of his army up, which was to produce near fatal problems for Carthage later on.

==== Roman response: privately funded fleet ====
The Roman Republic was nearly bankrupt and had to borrow money from wealthy citizens to fund the construction of a fleet of 200 quinqueremes, which blockaded Carthaginian positions in Sicily in 242 BC by seizing the harbour of Drepana and anchorages at Lilybaeum, while Roman soldiers built siege works around Drepanum. The better-trained Roman fleet defeated a hastily raised, undermanned and ill-trained Punic fleet at battle of the Aegates Islands in 241 BC, cutting Sicily off from Carthage. Carthaginian leadership requested terms to the victorious Roman commander, Gaius Lutatius Catulus and authorised Hamilcar Barca to open negotiations, probably to avoid the responsibility of the defeat. Hamilcar in turn nominated Gisco, the Carthaginian commander of Lilybaeum, to conduct the talks. Carthage often hauled defeated generals and admirals before the Tribunal of 100 and had them crucified, so Hamilcar probably distanced himself from the possibility of prosecution if the Roman terms turned out to be harsh enough for Carthaginian authorities to seek a scapegoat.

=== Peace of Lutatius terms of the treaty ===

This treaty replaced all previous treaties between the two powers. The initial conditions laid out by Lutatius to Gisco were:

* The Carthaginians will evacuate all Sicily.
* Carthage should not make war on Syracuse and their allies.
* Carthage would pay Rome 2,200 Euboean silver talents (56 tons) over a 20-year period as reparations.
* The Carthaginian army would surrender their weapons and all Roman deserters immediately.

Hamilcar Barca refused the demand to surrender Roman deserters or disarm Carthaginian soldiers, despite being threatened by Lutatius to have the Punic army pass under the yoke. Lutatius did not press the issue further, and the Carthaginian soldiers were later allowed to leave Sicily under arms with their honor intact, and without any token of submission – a rare gesture granted by the Romans to a defeated enemy. Roman deserters may have been surrendered on a later date.

Lutatius did not have the authority to ratify the agreement he made with Hamilcar, so he forwarded them to the Comitia Centuriata in Rome. The Romans rejected these terms and appointed ten commissioners, led by Quantius Lutatius Cerco, brother of the consul and himself consul in 240 BC, to reexamine the conditions. They added some conditions and amended some of the ones given by Lutatius:

* Carthage would evacuate all islands between Italy and Sicily – probably the Aegates Islands in addition to the Aeolian Islands. This meant Roman acknowledgement of Carthaginian control over Malta, Pantelleria, Sardinia and Corsica.
* Carthage would pay 2,200 silver talents in 10 year installments, and 1,000 talents immediately; a total of 3,200 talents as war reparations.
* Carthage will ransom all Punic prisoners, while all Roman prisoners would be freed without payment of ransom.
* Carthaginian warships were forbidden to sail along Italian shores or those of their allies.
* Neither side should make war on the other&#x27;s allies, or seek to change their allegiance by allying with them directly or interfering with their internal affairs. Neither side would seek to recruit soldiers, levy tribute or build public buildings on the other power&#x27;s territories.

The last condition is mentioned by Polybius in place of the one regarding not making war on Syracuse. It is possible that Hamilcar Barca secured the last clause after the initial conditions, which were more favorable to Carthage, was altered by Rome with a harsher one. Hamilcar Barca gathered the Carthaginian soldiers from Drepana and Eryx at Lilybaeum, surrendered his command, returned to Carthage and retired to private life, leaving Gisco and the Carthaginian government to pay off his soldiers. Whatever was the motivation behind this act, it was resented by the mercenaries left behind in Sicily.

== Truceless War ==

The &quot;Undefeated&quot; army now created a unique problem for Carthage. Had Hamilcar suffered a decisive defeat, casualties and prisoners would have diminished their numbers and Carthage would have had an excuse not to pay anything. But now the 20,000 man army had to be paid their full due.

Gisco sensibly sent the troops to Carthage in small groups with intervals in between so the government could pay them off without trouble. However, the Carthaginian authorities waited until the whole army had gathered at Carthage, probably by the summer of 241 BC. As the strain on the Punic population increased, Carthaginian authorities then sent them off to Sicca, planning to plead with the whole army to forgo their unpaid wages by pointing out the dire financial situation of Carthage. Hamilcar&#x27;s former soldiers, who had been kept together only by his personal authority and by the promise of good pay, broke out into open mutiny once Hanno the Great tried to impose this, and marched on Carthage and encamped at Tunis. The soldiers refused to accept Hamilcar as an arbitrator, angered by his refusal to accompany his army from Sicily and retiring to Carthage as soon as the treaty with Rome was formalized, and although Carthage at this point conceded to all their demands, things soon boiled over and started the conflict known as the Mercenary War. The rebels, under Spendius and Matho, were joined by 70,000 African subjects of Carthage. The rebels divided their forces: detachments were sent to besiege Utica and Hippo, while others cut Carthage off from the mainland, probably in the winter of 241 BC or spring of 240 BC.

===Hamilcar recalled===

Hanno the Great was given command of the Punic army, which was raised from Carthaginian citizens and mercenaries recruited from abroad, plus cavalry squadrons and 100 elephants. Hanno sailed to Utica in the spring of 241 BC, obtained siege equipment from the city and overran the rebel camp, the rebels fleeing before the charging Punic elephants. Hanno, accustomed to fighting Libyans and Numidians, did not anticipate any further trouble and left his army for Utica. However, the rebels regrouped, and observing lax discipline among the Punic troops, launched a surprise sortie and routed the Punic army while Hanno was absent, driving the survivors to Utica and capturing all the baggage. Hanno marshaled his soldiers, but twice failed to engage the rebels under favorable conditions and twice failed to surprise them on other occasions. The Carthaginian government then raised an army of 10,000 soldiers and 70 elephants and put Hamilcar Barca in command. This army was small for leading a sortie against the stronger rebel forces, especially to lead into a pitched battle. The Carthaginians needed to gain the far side of the Bagradas, so they could manoeuvre freely, but lacked the strength to force a crossing against the superior rebel force guarding against this. Hanno posted his army near Hippo Acra, where Matho&#x27;s army was besieging the town.

====Battle of Macar River====

The rebels held the hills to the west of Carthage and the only bridge across the Bagradas river leading to Utica. Hamilcar observed that wind blowing from a certain direction uncovered a sandbar at the river mouth that was fordable and, under cover of night, the Punic army left Carthage and crossed the river. Hamilcar aimed to attack the small rebel band holding the bridge, but Spendius led the rebel force besieging Utica to confront Hamilcar. The Carthaginian army was caught in a pincer movement; Hamilcar pretended to retreat, and Spendius likely attempted to trap the outnumbered Carthaginians against the river with his two forces, pinning them with one and out-flanking them with the other. When his troops rushed towards the retreating Carthaginians, Spendius was either unable to control them or believed that the Carthaginians were fleeing and encouraged his forces&#x27; pursuit. Hamilcar had managed to train his new recruits in some drill and basic battlefield maneuvers before they left Carthage. As the two rebel forces came into clear sight the Carthaginians wheeled, and marched away. The Carthaginians were marching in good order so they could perform a pre-planned manoeuvre which they had practiced in Carthage, but the rebels, many of whom were inexperienced soldiers, believed that the Carthaginians were running away. Shouting encouragement to each other they broke into a run to pursue. Hamilcar unleashed his trap as the disorderly rebels closed on his formation. As the cavalry and then the elephants came closer to the infantry Hamilcar ordered each in turn to also wheel about to face the rebels. The modern historian Dexter Hoyos stresses that &quot;[s]uch manoeuvres were about the simplest that any army could learn, once it mastered the absolute basics of marching in formation&quot;.

It is not exactly known how Hamilcar managed to outwit the rebels. According to one line of thought, the Carthaginian army order of march had the War Elephants leading the column, with the light troops and cavalry behind the elephants. Heavy infantry formed the rearguard, and the whole army marched in a single file in battle formation.
According to another line of thought, Hamilcar’s army marched in three separate columns, with the war elephants placed nearest the rebel army. The cavalry and light infantry were in the middle, while the heavy infantry was posted furthest from the rebel army.

Through brilliant maneuvering, Hamilcar inflicted a heavy defeat on the rebel forces, leading to the killing of 8,000 mercenaries and the capturing of 2,000 men. Hamilcar occupied the bridge, then established control over the surrounding region. Some of the surviving rebels fled towards Utica; others, after being driven from their camp near the bridge, fled to Tunis.

===Hamilcar trapped===
Hamilcar&#x27;s victory opened communication with Utica, and gave Hamilcar the chance to bring nearby towns under Carthaginian control by force or negotiations. He made no attempt to join Hanno near Utica. Spendius rallied his forces, was reinforced by a detachment largely made of Gauls under Autaritus and shadowed Hamilcar as he advanced south east, keeping to the high ground to avoid Carthaginian elephants and cavalry and harassing their enemy at every possible opportunity. These &quot;Fabian tactics&quot; continued until Hamilcar encamped in a valley, probably near Nepheris, and the rebels trapped his army, with the Libyans blocking the exit, Spendius and his troops camping near the Punic army and the Numidians covering Hamilcar&#x27;s rear. Hamilcar&#x27;s army was saved by pure luck – a Numidian chieftain, Naravas, who would later marry Hamilcar&#x27;s third daughter, defected with 2,000 horsemen. Hamilcar exited the valley and, after a hard-fought battle, defeated the army of Spendius. The rebel loss was 8,000 dead with 4,000 captured. Hamilcar offered the prisoners a choice – to join his army, or leave Africa with the condition never to take up arms against Carthage. The new joiners were armed with equipment captured from the rebels. By winter of 240 BC, the situation had improved for Carthage.

====Beginning of atrocities====
Rebel leaders feared mass desertions might result because of Hamilcar&#x27;s policy towards prisoners. To forestall any such event, rebels committed an act of cruelty unpardonable by Carthage. Autaritus spread the rumor that Carthaginian prisoners led by Gisco were plotting to escape. Rebels opposing this were stoned and Gisco and his fellow prisoners were tortured to death. Autaritus announced that he would do the same with all Punic prisoners that fell into rebel hands in future. Hamilcar killed his prisoners and announced a policy of equal measure toward future rebel prisoners, thus ending any chance of desertion from the rebel army and the truceless war began in earnest.

===Triple trouble and revival===
Carthage was hit by a series of disasters in 239 BC: her fleet and supply flotilla bringing supplies from Empoia was sunk in a storm, the mercenaries in Sardinia rebelled and the cities of Utica and Hippo Acra killed their Punic garrisons and defected to the rebels. Carthage sent an expedition to Sardinia under Hanno, but this force killed their officers and joined the rebels. Furthermore, Hamilcar had invited Hanno the Great to join forces and try to end the rebellion as quickly as possible, but the generals failed to cooperate.

The gloomy situation changed when first Syracuse and then Rome came to the aid of Carthage. Syracuse redoubled the volume of supplies sent to Carthage. Rome forbade Italian traders to trade with rebels and encouraged trade with Carthage, freed Punic prisoners without ransom, and allowed Carthage to recruit mercenaries from Roman territories and flatly refused the invitation from Utica, Hippo and Sardinia to occupy these areas. Finally, when the Carthaginian Senate was unable to decide between Hamilcar and Hanno, the people&#x27;s assembly left it to the army to decide on their Commander in Chief, and Hamilcar Barca was elected to sole command. The people&#x27;s assembly chose Hannibal of Paropos, son of another Hamilcar and a veteran of the First Punic War as Hamilcar&#x27;s deputy.

===Carthage blockaded===
While Carthage was busy settling state affairs, Spendius and Matho decided to blockade the city from the landward side. However, as the rebels had no navy, Carthage could draw supplies from the sea and so did not face the threat of starvation. But the rebels would sally out from their camp at Tunis and approach the city walls to cause terror inside the city. In response, Hamilcar began to harass the rebel supply lines and soon the rebels were placed in a state of siege. Spendius and Matho were joined by a force commanded by a Libyan chief named Zarzas, and the 50,000 strong army under Spendius moved away from Carthage. Using tactics later made famous by Q. Fabius against Hannibal, Hamilcar&#x27;s eldest son, the rebels shadowed Hamilcar&#x27;s army, while moving south, harassing his soldiers and keeping to the high ground to avoid Carthaginian elephants and cavalry. After weeks of maneuvering, Hamilcar finally managed to trap about 40,000 rebels in a valley surrounded on three sides by mountains.

====The Gorge of the Saw====

The exact location of this valley has never been conclusively identified. It was probably some distance from Carthage because, while Hamilcar blockaded the valley exits and waited for the rebels to starve, Matho&#x27;s army at Tunis did not intervene although the trapped rebels held out awaiting his arrival. After the trapped rebels ran out of food, pack animals and cavalry horses and finally resorted to cannibalism, Spendius, Autaritus and Zarzas, accompanied by seven others, went to Hamilcar&#x27;s camp to seek terms. Hamilcar offered to allow all the rebels to depart freely with a single garment, but retained the right to detain 10 persons. When the rebel leaders agreed to the terms, Hamilcar detained the rebel delegation. Deprived of leadership, and unaware of the pact, the mercenaries suspected treachery; the Libyans were the first to attack Hamilcar&#x27;s positions. The rebel army was slaughtered, with the elephants trampling most to death.

===Setback in Tunis===

Hamilcar next moved to confront the army of Matho at Tunis. He divided his army: Hannibal took half of the soldiers and camped to the north of Tunis, while Hamilcar camped to the south, thus hemming in Matho&#x27;s army in Tunis. Hamilcar crucified Spendius and other rebel hostages outside Tunis to terrorize Matho, but this backfired when the rebels were able to surprise and defeat Hannibal&#x27;s army due to their lax discipline. Punic survivors fled, and all their baggage was captured along with Hannibal and thirty Carthaginian senators. Hamilcar retreated north near the mouth of the Bagradas River, while Matho crucified his prisoners on the same crosses Hamilcar had used to crucify the rebel leaders, then retreated out of Tunis and moved south.

At this point, the Carthaginian senate reinstated Hanno and forced Hamilcar to share command. The Punic generals pursued Matho&#x27;s army and won several small-scale engagements. After mustering their forces, a decisive battle was fought probably near the town of Leptis Minor. The Carthaginians destroyed the rebel army, after which the Libyan towns submitted to Carthage. When Utica and Hippo Acra held out, Hanno and Hamilcar besieged them, eventually receiving their surrender on terms. By the winter of 238 BC, the Mercenary revolt was over. Hanno and Hamilcar unleashed reprisals against the Numidian tribes that had sided with the rebels, and the generals probably extended Carthaginian territory in Africa at the same time. Carthage now began to fit out an expedition to recover Sardinia, with Hamilcar commanding Punic forces.

====Sardinia====
Punic Mercenaries stationed in Sardinia had rebelled in 239 BC, besieged Boaster and all Carthaginians in a citadel and later executed them after the fort fell. They managed to take over all Punic territories in Sardinia. Carthage sent a mercenary force under Hanno to retake the island in 239 BC, but this group also rebelled, killing Hanno and their Carthaginian officers and joining the rebels in Sardinia. The rebels requested Rome to take over Sardinia, which was turned down. Their heavy handedness with Sardinian natives caused native Sardinians to attack and expel the mercenaries by 237 BC. The expelled mercenaries took refuge in Italy and again requested Rome to take over Sardinia.

Rome, which had dealt with Carthage with all due honor and courtesy during the crisis, going as far as to release all Punic prisoners without ransom and refuse to accept offers from Utica and Rebels mercenaries based in Sardinia to incorporate these territories into the Roman domain, seized Sardinia and Corsica and forced Carthage to pay 1,200 talents for her initial refusal to renounce her claim over the islands. This probably dealt a fatal blow to any chance of permanent peace between Rome and Carthage and is one of the causes of the Second Punic War and held as the motivation of the subsequent military and political activities of Hamilcar.

==Punic politics==

The aristocratic party had dominated Carthaginian politics since 248 BC. Hanno the Great was aligned with them and they espoused peaceful relations with Rome, even at the cost of abandoning overseas territories. Their choice to minimize the Sicilian operations while Hamilcar was in command, reduce the navy and support Hanno the Great&#x27;s conquests in Africa, all of which were causes for the ultimate defeat of Carthage in the First Punic War. They had remained in power throughout the Mercenary War and had advocated Hanno&#x27;s position over Hamilcar&#x27;s more than once.

Their opponents probably had the support of people who had wanted to continue the war even after the defeat at Aegates Island. The Mercantile Class, whose interests were hurt by the war, and would be marginalized by the abandonment of overseas operations, also supported this faction. People disenfranchised by the ruin of the navy and disruption of trade might have thrown in their lot with this group and eventually Hasdrubal the Fair emerged as the leader. Hamilcar, furious that Sicily had been given up too soon, while he had been undefeated, could rely on support from this party.

There is no clear record of the political activity in Carthage at this time. The political clout of the incumbent leaders was probably weakened by the defeat in the First Punic War, their mismanagement of the Mercenary troops and finally the Sardinia Affair. In an effort to reestablish their position, they decided to make a scapegoat of Hamilcar Barca.

==Hamilcar supreme in Carthage==
Hamilcar Barca was blamed by the Carthaginian Leaders for causing the Mercenary War by making unrealistic promises to his soldiers, especially the Celts, during his command in Sicily. This event may have taken place as early as 241 BC or more likely in 237 BC. The influence Hamilcar enjoyed among the people and the opposition party enabled him to avoid standing trial. Furthermore, Hamilcar allied with Hasdrubal the Fair, his future son in law, to restrict the power of the aristocracy, which was led by Hanno the Great, as well as gain immunity from prosecution. Hamilcar&#x27;s faction gained enough clout, if not supreme power in Carthage, for Hamilcar to implement his next agenda. Hamilcar&#x27;s first priority, probably, was to ensure that the war indemnity was paid regularly so the Romans had no excuse to interfere in Carthaginian affairs. His second was to implement his strategy for preparing Carthage for any future conflict with Rome, or enable Carthage to defend itself against any aggression.

===Operations in North Africa===
Hamilcar obtained permission from the Carthaginian Senate for recruiting and training a new army, with the immediate goal of securing the African domain of Carthage. As this was in line with the goal of the &quot;Peace Party&quot; of Hanno the Great, probably no serious opposition was offered. Training for the army was obtained in some Numidian forays, then Hamilcar marched the army westwards to the Pillars of Hercules. Hasdrubal the Fair commanded the fleet carrying supplies and elephants along the coast, keeping pace with the army.

Hamilcar, on his own responsibility and without the consent of the Carthaginian government, ferried the army across to Gades to start an expedition into Hispania (236 BC), where he hoped to gain a new empire to compensate Carthage for the loss of Sicily and Sardinia. Iberia would also serve as a base for any future conflicts against the Romans which would be independent of political interference from Carthage, and the campaigns would enhance the reputation of Hamilcar Barca. Hamilcar&#x27;s political clout in Carthage may have been enough to stifle any opposition in Carthage against his Iberian venture, or he did face stiff opposition and had used the booty from his Iberian campaigns to buy his way out. Whatever the case, Hamilcar enjoyed uninterrupted command in Iberia during his stay there.

==Barcid Spain==
Hamilcar&#x27;s army either crossed the Straits of Gibraltar into Iberia from West Africa or, having returned to Carthage after the African activities, sailed along the African coast to Gades. Hasdrubal the Fair and Hannibal, then a child of nine, accompanied Hamilcar; it is not known who led Hamilcar&#x27;s supporters in Carthage in the absence of Hamilcar and Hasdrubal. Prior to his departure from Carthage, Hamilcar made sacrifices to obtain favorable omens and Hannibal swore never to be a &quot;Friend of Rome&quot; and &quot;Never to show goodwill to the Romans&quot;. Several modern historians have interpreted this as Hannibal swearing to be a lifelong enemy of Rome bent on revenge, while others hold that this interpretation is a distortion.

===Iberian political situation===
Hamilcar probably landed at Gades in the summer of 237 BC. Whatever direct territorial control Carthage had had in the past in Iberia, this had been mostly lost by this time as Hamilcar was &quot;re-establishing Carthaginian authority in Iberia&quot;. Phoenician colonies were strung along the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of southwestern Spain and exercised some degree of control over their immediate areas, but only had trading contacts, not direct control, over the tribes of Iberia at that time. Iberian and Celtiberian tribes were not under any unified leadership at this time and were warlike, although some had absorbed varying degrees of Greek and Punic cultural influence.

====Ancient rivals: Punics and Phocaeans====
Carthage&#x27;s failure to prevent the establishment of Massalia by Phocaean Greeks in 600 BC had created a rival that eventually came to dominate trade in Gaul and to plant colonies in Catalonia, at Mainke near Málaga, three colonies near the mouth of Sucro, and at Alalia in Corsica. Greek piracy had forced Carthage to team up with the Etruscans to drive the Greeks from Corsica, and destroy the colony at Mainke in Iberia. By 490 BC, Massalia had managed to defeat Carthage twice, and a boundary along Cape Nao in Iberia was agreed upon, while Carthage had closed the Straits of Gibraltar to foreign shipping. Massalia had become friendly with Rome over the years, if not an outright ally by 237 BC, and this connection would become a significant factor in the power politics of the region.

===Securing the silver supply===
Hamilcar&#x27;s immediate objective was to secure access to the gold and silver mines of Sierra Morena, either by direct and indirect control. Negotiations with the &quot;Tartessian&quot; tribes were successfully concluded, but Hamilcar faced hostility from the Turdetani or Turduli tribe, near the foothills of modern Seville and Córdoba. The Iberians had support from Celtiberian tribes and were under the command of two chieftains, Istolatios and his brother. Hamilcar defeated the confederates, killed the leaders and several of their soldiers, while he released a number of prisoners and incorporated 3,000 of the enemy into his army. The Turdetani surrendered. Hamilcar then fought a 50,000 strong army under a chieftain named Indortes. The Iberian army fled before the battle was joined. Hamilcar besieged Indortes, tortured and crucified him after his surrender but allowed 10,000 of the captured enemy soldiers to go home.

Having secured control over the mines, and the river routes of Guadalquivir and Guadalete giving access to the mining area, Gades began to mint silver coins from 237 BC. Carthaginians may have taken control of the mining operations and introduced new technologies to increase production. Hamilcar now had the means to pay for his mercenary army and also to ship silver ore to Carthage to help pay off the war indemnity. Hamilcar was in a secure enough position in Iberia to send Hasdrubal the Fair with an army to Africa to quell a Numidian rebellion in 236 BC. Hasdrubal defeated the rebels, killing 8,000 and taking 2,000 prisoners before returning to Iberia.

===Expanding eastward 235 BC – 231 BC===

Hamilcar, after subduing Turdetania next moved east from Gades towards Cape Nao. He met fierce resistance from the Iberia tribes, even the friendly Bastetani offered battle. Four years of constant campaigns, details of which are not known, saw Hamilcar subdue the area between Gades and Cape Nao. In the process, Hamilcar created a professional army of Iberians, Africans, Numidians and other mercenaries that Hasdrubal the Fair would inherit and Hannibal would later lead across the Alps to immortality. By 231 BC, Hamilcar Barca had consolidated his Iberian territorial gains and established the city of Akra Leuke (Alicante), probably in 235 BC, to guard Punic holdings, and possibly took over the area of Massalian colonies near the mouth of Sucro River. Massalia, probably alarmed by the Carthaginian advance towards their area of influence, mentioned this expansion to the Romans, who decided to investigate the matter.

===Rome takes a look===
While Hamilcar campaigned in Iberia, Rome was entangled in Sardinia, Corsica and Liguria, where the natives had put up stiff resistance against Roman occupation – campaigns had been fought in these areas between 236 – 231 BC to retain and expand Roman dominion. Rome suspected Carthage of aiding the natives, and had sent embassies to Carthage in 236, 235, 233 and 230 BC to accuse and threaten the Punic state. Nothing had come of these supposed episodes and some scholars doubt their authenticity. In 231 BC, a Roman embassy visited Hamilcar in Spain to inquire about his activities. Hamilcar simply replied that he was fighting to gather enough booty to pay off the war indemnity. The Romans withdrew and did not bother the Carthaginians in Spain until 226 BC.

===Final campaigns 231 BC – 228 BC===
After the establishment of Akra Leuke, Hamilcar began to move northwest but no records of his campaigns exist. Hamilcar had split his forces in the winter of 228 BC, Hasdrubal the Fair was sent on a separate campaign, while Hamilcar besieged an Iberian town, then sent the bulk of his troops to winter quarters at Akra Leuke. Hamilcar&#x27;s sons, Hannibal and Hasdrubal, had accompanied him. The town, called Helike, is commonly identified with Elche, but given that it is situated close to Hamilcar&#x27;s base at Akra Leuke from which he could readily draw reinforcement, it cannot be the place where the following events unfolded. It is possible that Hamilcar died battling the Vettoni, who lived across the Tagus west of Toledo and to the north of Turduli and northwest of Oretani territory.

=== Death of Hamilcar ===
Orissus, chieftain of the Oretani tribe, came to the assistance of the besieged town. There are several versions to what happened next: Orissus offered to aid Hamilcar, then attacked the Punic army, and Hamilcar drowned during a retreat across the Jucar river; the Oretani sent ox-driven carts to the Carthaginian position, then set them on fire and Hamilcar died in the resulting melee; Hamilcar accepted an offer to parley, then led the enemy in one direction while Hannibal and Hasdrubal Barca fled in the opposite direction. According to Appian, Hamilcar was thrown from his horse and drowned in a river, but Polybius says he fell in battle in an unknown corner of Iberia against an unnamed tribe.

===Family===
Hamilcar had at least three daughters and at least three sons.

His first daughter was married to Bomilcar, who was a suffete of Carthage and may have commanded the Punic fleet in the Second Punic war. His grandson, Hanno, was an important commander in the army of his son Hannibal.

The second daughter was married to Hasdrubal the Fair.

His third daughter married the Berber ally Naravas, a Numidian chieftain whose defection had saved Hamilcar and his army during the mercenary war.

Hamilcar had three sons, Hannibal, Hasdrubal and Mago, who were all to have distinguished military careers. An unnamed fourth son is often referred to, but details are lacking.

== Legacy ==
According to legend, Hamilcar founded the port of Barcino, deriving its name from the Barca family, which became the modern city of Barcelona. However, despite this similarity, it is usually accepted that the origin of Barcelona is the Iberian name &quot;Barkeno&quot; instead.

=== The Grand Strategy ===
Hamilcar stood out far above the Carthaginians of his age in military and diplomatic skill and in strength of patriotism; in these qualities he was surpassed only by his son Hannibal, whom he may have imbued with his own deep suspicion of Rome and trained to be his successor in the conflict. One historian commented that had he not been the father of Hannibal, Hamilcar&#x27;s Sicilian front might have received scant notice. Hamilcar is thought to be the best commander of the First Punic War and as a man, Cato placed Hamilcar a cut above most leaders, including most Romans. By the power of his personal influence among the mercenaries and the surrounding African peoples, superior strategy and some luck, as well as cooperation, if unenthusiastic, from Hanno the Great, Hamilcar crushed the revolt by 237 BC amid a war marked with cruel atrocities from both sides.

===Enemy of Rome===
The milder terms Rome had given to Carthage in the aftermath of the First Punic War, and the friendly conduct of Rome during the mercenary war might have raised the possibility of a long period of peace between the two powers, but the seizure of Sardinia destroyed any real chance of peace among equals. According to Polybius, the causes of the Second Punic war were as follows:
* Hamilcar felt that Carthage had given up on Sicily too soon in the First Punic War. Hamilcar had been undefeated and was forced to make peace. The subsequent Mercenary War showed that Carthage was capable of further military effort.
* Roman occupation of Sardinia, and then Corsica, indicated the untrustworthiness of Romans and their willingness to meddle when they saw fit regardless of treaties between the powers. This is the second and most important cause of the Second Punic War. This had aroused resentment among many Punic citizens, and Carthage had no hope of resisting Rome at their weakened condition.
* The success of Hamilcar and his family in Spain, which rebuilt Carthaginian finances and created a standing army, giving Carthage the means to resist Rome.

Based on this, and Hannibal&#x27;s oath, some historians infer that Hamilcar&#x27;s post-Mercenary War activities were aimed at eventual war with Rome, which was inherited by his sons, and some further suggested that Hamilcar devised the strategy of invading Italy by crossing the Alps as well as Hannibal&#x27;s battle tactics. Without Punic records to cross reference, these remain mere supposition.

<text>A broad-gauge railway is a railway with a track gauge (the distance between the rails) broader than the used by standard-gauge railways.

Broad gauge of , more known as Russian gauge, is the dominant track gauge in former Soviet Union countries (CIS states, Baltic states, Georgia, Ukraine) and Mongolia. Broad gauge of , commonly known as five foot gauge, is mainly used in Finland. Broad gauge of , commonly known as Irish gauge, is the dominant track gauge in Ireland, the Australian state of Victoria and Adelaide in South Australia and passenger trains of Brazil.

Broad gauge of , commonly known as Iberian gauge, is the dominant track gauge in Spain and Portugal.

Broad gauge of , commonly known as Indian gauge, is the dominant track gauge in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Argentina, Chile, and on BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) in the San Francisco Bay Area. This is the widest gauge in common use anywhere in the world. It is possible for trains on both Iberian gauge and Indian gauge to travel on each other&#x27;s tracks with no modifications in the vast majority of cases.

== History ==

In Great Britain, broad gauge was first used in Scotland for the Dundee and Arbroath Railway (1836–1847) and the Arbroath and Forfar Railway (1838–1848). Both short and isolated lines, they were built in . The lines were subsequently converted to standard gauge and connected to the emerging Scottish rail network.

The Great Western Railway was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1838 with a gauge of , and retained this gauge until 1892. Some harbours also used railways of this gauge for construction and maintenance. These included Portland Harbour and Holyhead Breakwater, which used a locomotive for working sidings. As it was not connected to the national network, this broad-gauge operation continued until the locomotive wore out in 1913. The gauge initially proposed by Brunel was exactly but this was soon increased by to to accommodate clearance problems identified during early testing. George Stephenson was to add an extra half inch to his original gauge for the same reason.

While the parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was initially prepared to authorise lines built to the broad gauge of , it was eventually rejected by the Gauge Commission in favour of all new railways in England, Wales and Scotland being built to standard gauge of , this being the gauge with the greatest mileage. Railways which had already received their enabling Act would continue at the 7 ft gauge. Ireland, using the same criteria, was allocated a different standard gauge, the Irish gauge, of which is also used in the Australian states of South Australia and Victoria. Broad-gauge lines in Britain were gradually converted to dual gauge or standard gauge from 1864 and finally the last of Brunel&#x27;s broad gauge was converted over a weekend in 1892.

In 1839, the Netherlands started its railway system with two broad-gauge railways. The chosen gauge of was applied between 1839 and 1866 by the &quot;Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij&quot; (HSM) for its Amsterdam–The Hague–Rotterdam line and between 1842 and 1855, firstly by the Dutch state, but soon by the &quot;Nederlandsche Rhijnspoorweg-Maatschappij&quot; (NRS), for its Amsterdam–Utrecht–Arnhem line. But the neighbouring countries Prussia and Belgium already used standard gauge, so the two companies had to regauge their first lines. In 1855, NRS regauged its line and shortly afterwards connected to the Prussian railways. The HSM followed in 1866. There are replicas of one broad-gauge 2-2-2 locomotive (&quot;De Arend&quot;) and three carriages in the &quot;Nederlands Spoorwegmuseum&quot; (Dutch Railway Museum) in Utrecht. These replicas were built for the 100th anniversary of the Dutch Railways in 1938–39.

The erstwhile Great Indian Peninsula Railway introduced a broad gauge of for the first passenger railway line in India, between Bori Bunder and Thane. This was later adopted as the standard throughout the country, as it was thought to be safer in areas prone to cyclones and flooding. The gauge is now commonly referred to as Indian gauge. While some initial freight railway lines in India were built using standard gauge, most of the standard and narrow gauge railways have since been dismantled and relaid in broad gauge.

Ireland and some states in Australia and Brazil have a gauge of but Luas, the Dublin light rail system, is built to standard gauge. Russia and the other former Soviet Republics use a (originally ) gauge while Finland continues to use the gauge inherited from the Russian Empire (the two standards are close enough to allow full interoperability between Finland and Russia). Portugal and the Spanish &quot;Renfe&quot; system use a gauge of called &quot;Ancho Ibérico&quot; in Spanish or &quot;Bitola Ibérica&quot; in Portuguese (see Iberian gauge); though there are plans to convert to standard gauge.

In Toronto, Canada, the gauge for TTC subways and streetcars was chosen in 1861. Toronto adopted a unique Toronto gauge of , an &quot;overgauge&quot; originally stated to &quot;allow horse-drawn wagons to use the rails&quot; on the horse-drawn streetcar lines of the day but with the practical effect of precluding the use of standard-gauge equipment in the street. The Toronto Transit Commission still operates the Toronto streetcar system and three heavy-rail subway lines using this unique gauge. The light metro Scarborough RT and two light rail lines under construction (Eglinton Crosstown line and Finch West) use standard gauge.

In 1851, the broad gauge was officially adopted as the standard gauge for the Province of Canada, becoming known as the &quot;Provincial gauge&quot; and government subsidies were unavailable for railways that chose other gauges. This caused problems in interchanging freight cars with northern United States railroads, most of which were built to standard gauge or a gauge similar to it. In the 1870s (mainly between 1872 and 1874), Canadian broad-gauge lines were changed to standard gauge to facilitate interchange and the exchange of rolling stock with American railroads. Today, almost all Canadian railways are standard-gauge.

In the early days of rail transport in the US, railways tended to be built out from coastal cities into the hinterland, and systems did not initially connect. Each builder was free to choose its own gauge, although the availability of British-built locomotives encouraged some railways to be built to standard gauge. As a general rule, southern railways were built to one or another broad gauge, mostly , while northern railroads that were not standard gauge tended to be narrow gauge. Most of the original track in Ohio was built in , and special &quot;compromise cars&quot; were able to run on both this track and standard-gauge track. In 1848, Ohio passed a law stating &quot;The width of the track or gauge of all roads under this act, shall be four feet ten inches between the rails.&quot; When American railroads&#x27; track extended to the point that they began to interconnect, it became clear that a single nationwide gauge was desirable.

Six-foot-gauge railroads () had developed a large regional following in New York State in the first part of the 19th century, due to the influence of the New York and Erie, one of the early pioneering railroads in America, chartered in 1832, with its first section opening in 1841. The builders and promoters decided that a six-foot track gauge would be needed for locomotives to be larger and more powerful than were in general use at the time, for pulling very large trains. Also the six-foot gauge provided greater stability, and the New York and Erie would operate passenger cars up to wide. Building westward from the Hudson River, it eventually reached Lake Erie, establishing a mainline longer than providing a shortcut to the American Midwest region from the New York City vicinity, and helping spawn a regional network of six-foot-gauge railroads almost exclusively within New York State.

Many early New York railways were Erie railroad-built branch lines, while others were independent railroads that wanted to partner and interchange with the Erie. These included the Walkill Valley, the Albany and Susquehanna (later part of the Delaware and Hudson); the Elmira, Jefferson &amp; Canandaigua (later the Northern Central, becoming part of the Pennsylvania Railroad); the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western mainline (which also had a significant amount of trackage in Pennsylvania); predecessor lines of the New York and Oswego Midland (later the New York, Ontario, and Western); and the Canandaigua and Niagara Falls (later becoming part of the New York Central railroad&#x27;s &quot;Peanut Route&quot; along the shoreline of Lake Ontario). However, by the late 1870s, the trend was inevitable, and conversion to standard gauge began, some lines first becoming &quot;dual-gauged&quot; with the addition of a third running rail. Between 1876 and 1880, most of the remaining six-foot–gauge trackage was converted.

In 1886, the railways in the Southern United States agreed to coordinate changing gauge on all their tracks. After considerable debate and planning, most of the southern rail network was converted from gauge to gauge, nearly the standard of the Pennsylvania Railroad, over two days beginning on 31 May 1886. Over a period of 36 hours, tens of thousands of workers pulled the spikes from the west rail of all the broad-gauge lines in the South, moved them east and spiked them back in place. The new gauge was close enough that standard-gauge equipment could run on it without difficulty. By June 1886, all major railroads in North America were using approximately the same gauge. The final conversion to true standard gauge took place gradually as track was maintained.

Some North American tram (streetcar) lines intentionally deviated from standard gauge. This may have been to make the tram companies less tempting targets for takeovers by the steam railways (or competing tram companies), which would be unable to run their trains over the tram tracks.

Pennsylvania trolley gauge of , is still used on the streetcars in New Orleans, and the Pittsburgh Light Rail system. This gauge was also used for the now defunct Pittsburgh Railways, West Penn Railways, and trams in Cincinnati. Similar gauge is used in Philadelphia on SEPTA routes, 15, the Media–Sharon Hill Line, the Subway–Surface Trolleys and the Market–Frankford Line. 

Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system in the San Francisco Bay Area was opened in 1972 with gauge. The system has been extended multiple times since then, using new railcars custom built with this non-standard gauge.

The use of a non-standard gauge precludes interoperability of rolling stock on railway networks. On the British Great Western Railway the gauge was supposed to allow high speed, but the company had difficulty with locomotive design in the early years, losing much of the advantage, and rapid advances in railway track and suspension technology allowed standard-gauge speeds to approach broad-gauge speeds within a decade or two. On the and gauges, the extra width allowed bigger inside cylinders and greater power, a problem solvable by using outside cylinders and higher steam pressure on standard gauge. In the end, the most powerful engines on standard gauge in North America and Scandinavia far exceeded the power of any early broad-gauge locomotive, but then met limits set by other factors such as the capacity of manual stoking, the axle (and total) locomotive weight that would trigger upgrades to the rails and bridges, the maximum wheelbase and/or boiler length compatible with an individual route&#x27;s curves.

In the 1930s German engineering studies focused on a Breitspurbahn system of railways of three-meter gauge to serve Hitler&#x27;s future German Empire.

=== High-speed rail ===
Spain uses standard-gauge track for its high-speed railways in order to provide cross-border services with France and the rest of Western Europe, but runs high-speed trains on its legacy broad-gauge network at and are developing trains to travel at speeds in excess of . Russia uses a modified Siemens Velaro high-speed train on its flagship St Petersburg to Moscow service at and can run at on dedicated track. The country is planning to build its portion of the Beijing to Moscow high-speed railway in broad gauge. Finland and Russia used a modified Alstom Pendolino on the Allegro service between Saint Petersburg and Helsinki at . Uzbekistan uses a modified Talgo 250 on the Tashkent–Bukhara high-speed rail line at .

South Asia primarily uses the broad gauge for its passenger rail services and the fastest broad-gauge train presently in the region is the Indian Railways&#x27; Vande Bharat Express (a.k.a. Train 18). During one of the trial runs, the Vande Bharat Express achieved a peak speed of . The sustained speeds of this train is considerably lower, with a peak operational speed of 160 km/h and an average speed of 95 km/h, due to track limitations. Indian Railways has plans to introduce a higher speed Vande Bharat sleeper train that is capable of 200 km/h, but the project has encountered delays stemming from bids for rolling-stocks with poor local sourcing. A number of semi-high-speed railway projects using broad-gauge tracks are being planned or built in the region, with sustained speeds of 200 km/h with future-proofing for 250 km/h. India&#x27;s current high-speed railway project is being built on the standard gauge due to limitations imposed by the Japanese consortium funding the project, however the feasibility reports by both the French and German consultants preferred a broad-gauge high-speed railway. These European reports stated that the additional costs of train procurement, due to the essential modifications of the rolling-stock for the broad gauge, from European rolling-stock manufacturers such as Alstom or Siemens would be softened through a large minimum order size of at least thirty train sets. A considerable debate has continued about the suitability of the high-speed rail on standard gauge for the Indian travel demands and the possible exclusion of the existing rail network in India. The recent discussions around the Kerala semi-high–speed rail has highlighted the limitations of high-speed rail on broad gauge. Since most of the global high-speed rail infrastructure is built using the standard gauge, the cost benefits of using off-the-shelf rolling-stocks with minimal customizations and the availability of extensive, well proven technical know-how, are significant factors in favor of the high-speed rail on the standard gauge over the broad gauge, for cost sensitive rail markets in South Asia, especially in India.

== Gauges ==

=== 4 ft in gauge ===

This gauge is used by the Toronto streetcar system and the Toronto subway

=== 5 ft and 1520 mm gauge ===

This gauge was first used in the United Kingdom and the United States before it became the standard gauge for most railways in the former Soviet Union.

Russian gauge or CIS gauge is the second most widely used gauge in the world, and spans the whole of the former Soviet Union/CIS bloc including the Baltic states and Mongolia. Finland uses . The difference is clearly lower than the tolerance margin, so through running is feasible. Care must be taken when servicing international trains because the wear profile of the wheels differs from that of trains that run on domestic tracks only.

When the Finnish rail network was founded in 1862, Finland was the Grand Duchy of Finland, an autonomic state ruled by the Imperial Russia. The first border crossing railway to Russia was opened in 1870, while the first to Sweden was not until 1919, so railways were built to the broad Russian track gauge of . In Russia, this gauge was re-standardized to during the 1960s. Finland retained the original gauge with no re-standardisation.

=== Pennsylvania trolley gauges ===
 and are commonly known as Pennsylvania trolley gauge because it was originally used by railroad lines in the state of Pennsylvania. Unlike other broad gauges, it remains in use in a number of urban rail transit systems.

* New Orleans streetcars
* SEPTA (Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority)
** Media–Sharon Hill Line suburban light rail line
* Pittsburgh Light Rail
* Streetcars in Cincinnati (1859–1951; standard gauge 2016–present)
* West Penn Railways (1904–1952 defunct)

* SEPTA (Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority)
** Market–Frankford Line
** Subway–surface trolley lines and Route 15 surface trolley line

=== 5 ft 3 in gauge ===

As part of the railway gauge standardisation considered by the United Kingdom Parliamentary Gauge Commission, Ireland was allocated its own gauge, Irish gauge. Ireland then had three gauges, and the new standard would be a fourth. 

The Irish gauge of is used in Ireland and parts of Australia and Brazil. A problem with the Irish Gauge in Australia is that it is only wider than the standard gauge used in other parts of Australia, principally New South Wales. Therefore, it is not considered advisable to use a third rail to allow dual-gauge operation on mainline sections of track, because of the danger of material lodging between the two rails.
There has been argument for well over a century about the practicability of third rail operation, and numerous devices have been promoted to overcome the problem, especially at turnouts, including the &quot;Brennan Switch&quot;.

=== 5 ft in ===

This gauge was once used by the United Railways and Electric Company and the MTA Maryland and is now used only by the Baltimore Streetcar Museum.

=== Iberian gauge ===

As finally established, the Iberian gauge of is a compromise between the similar, but slightly different, gauges first adopted as respective national standards in Spain and Portugal in the mid-19th century. The main railway networks of Spain were initially constructed to a gauge of six Castilian feet. Those of Portugal were initially built in standard gauge, but by 1864 were all converted to a gauge of five Portuguese feet – close enough to allow interoperability in practice. The new high-speed network in Spain and Portugal uses standard gauge. The dual-gauge high-speed train RENFE Class 130 can change gauge at low speed without stopping.

=== 5 ft 6 in gauge ===
The gauge was first used in Great Britain in Scotland for two short, isolated lines, the Dundee and Arbroath Railway (1836-1847) and the Arbroath and Forfar Railway (1838- ). Both the lines were subsequently converted to standard gauge and connected to the Scottish rail network.

Later this gauge was adopted as a standard for many British colonies such as Province of Canada and British India.

In 1851, the broad gauge was officially adopted as the standard gauge for the Province of Canada, becoming known as the &quot;Provincial gauge&quot;, and government subsidies were unavailable for railways that chose other gauges. In the 1870s, mainly between 1872 and 1874, Canadian broad-gauge lines were changed to standard gauge to facilitate interchange and the exchange of rolling stock with American railways. Today, all Canadian railways are standard-gauge.

In US, this gauge was adopted for many lines, but soon fell out in favour of standard gauge. Today, only California&#x27;s Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) uses this gauge.

In British India, some standard gauge freight railways were built in initial period, though they were dismantled later. Later, in the 1850s, the gauge of was adopted as standard for the nationwide network. Attempts to economize on the cost of construction led to the adoption of gauge and then and narrow gauges for many secondary and branch lines. In the later part of the 20th century, due to interchangeability and maintenance issue, the railways in each of the countries in the Indian Subcontinent began to convert all metre-gauge and narrow-gauge lines to this gauge. Today, the nationwide rail network in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal is entirely on this gauge, whereas India, under Project Unigauge, and Bangladesh are still undergoing gauge conversion.

This gauge is the widest gauge in regular passenger use in the world.

=== Broader gauges ===

Some railways in the United States were laid with a gauge of . The Gualala River Railroad operated tracks for a logging railroad.

Some industrial uses require still broader gauges, such as:

* Large telescopes and telescope arrays.
* Launch pads – The European Space Agency, Roscosmos, NASA and SpaceX use double-track railway to move rockets and supporting equipment at launch sites (with exceptions such as the rocket launches from Kennedy Space Center, which use caterpillar tracks on a river stone roadbed because other solutions cannot support the loads required).
* Gantry crane for unloading cargo from ships, loading cargo onto ships and for constructing ships.
* Funiculars, Incline elevator and Canal inclined plane, for transportation on sloped way.

These applications might use double track of the country&#x27;s usual gauge to provide the necessary stability and axle load. These applications may also use much heavier than normal rails, the heaviest rails for trains being about . Vehicles on these gauges generally operate at very low speeds.

<text>Bakunin (; masculine) or Bakunina (; feminine) is a Russian last name.

There are two theories regarding the origins of this last name. According to the first one, it is a variety of the last name Abakumov, which is derived from a patronymic, itself derived from various forms of the Christian male first name Avvakum. However, it is also possible that this last name is related to the last name Bakulin, both of which derive from dialectal Russian words &quot;&quot; (&quot;bakunya&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;bakulya&quot;), meaning, depending on the dialect, &quot;chatterbox&quot;, &quot;talkative person&quot; or &quot;agile, business-like person&quot;.

<doc id="93813" wikidata="Q222744" url="?curid=93813" title="César Vallejo">
<text>César Abraham Vallejo Mendoza (March 16, 1892 – April 15, 1938) was a Peruvian poet, writer, playwright, and journalist. Although he published only two books of poetry during his lifetime, he is considered one of the great poetic innovators of the 20th century in any language. Thomas Merton called him &quot;the greatest universal poet since Dante&quot;. The late British poet, critic and biographer Martin Seymour-Smith, a leading authority on world literature, called Vallejo &quot;the greatest twentieth-century poet in &quot;any&quot; language.&quot; He was a member of the intellectual community called North Group formed in the Peruvian north coastal city of Trujillo.

Clayton Eshleman and José Rubia Barcia&#x27;s translation of &quot;The Complete Posthumous Poetry of César Vallejo&quot; won the National Book Award for translation in 1979.

Some of his poems have been set to music by the Indonesian composer and pianist Ananda Sukarlan, premiered by the Peruvian baritone Rudi-Fernandez Cardenas with the composer himself on the piano, and have since entered the repertoire of vocal music for baritone and piano.

==Biography==

César Vallejo was born to Francisco de Paula Vallejo Benítez and María de los Santos Mendoza Gurrionero in Santiago de Chuco, a remote village in the Peruvian Andes. He was the youngest of eleven children. His grandfathers were both Spanish priests, and his grandmothers were both indigenous Peruvians.

Lack of funds forced him to withdraw from his studies for a time and work at a sugar plantation, the Roma , where he witnessed the exploitation of agrarian workers firsthand, an experience which would have an important impact on his politics and aesthetics. Vallejo received a BA in Spanish literature in 1915, the same year that he became acquainted with the bohemia of Trujillo, in particular with APRA co-founders Antenor Orrego and Victor Raul Haya de la Torre.

In 1911 Vallejo moved to Lima, where he studied at National University of San Marcos; read, worked as a schoolteacher, and came into contact with the artistic and political avant-garde. While in Lima, he also produced his first poetry collection, &quot;Los heraldos negros.&quot; Despite its stated publication year of 1918, the book was actually published a year later. It is also heavily influenced by the poetry and other writings of fellow Peruvian Manuel González Prada, who had only recently died. Vallejo then suffered a number of calamities over the next few years: he refused to marry a woman with whom he had an affair; and he had lost his teaching post.

His mother died in 1918. In May 1920, homesickness drove him to return to Santiago de Chuco. On the first of August, the house belonging to the Santa María Calderón family, who transported merchandise and alcohol by pack animals from the coast, was looted and set on fire. Vallejo was unjustly accused as both a participant and instigator of the act. He hid but was discovered, arrested, and thrown in a Trujillo jail where he would remain for 112 days (From November 6, 1920 until February 26, 1921). On December 24, 1920 he won second place (first place was declared void) from the city hall of Trujillo for the poem, &quot;Fabla de gesta (Tribute to Marqués de Torre Tagle)&quot;. Vallejo competed by hiding his identity with a pseudonym in an attempt to give impartiality to the competition.

In the work, &quot;Vallejo en los infiernos&quot;, the author, a practicing lawyer, Eduardo González Viaña revealed key pieces of judicial documentation against the poet and showed deliberate fabrications by the judge and his enemies to imprison him. It indicted the victims but excluded prosecution to those criminally involved. They invented testimonies and attributed them to people who subsequently declared that they had never been to Santiago de Chuco, the place of the crime. Finally, the material author was escorted to Trujillo to testify before the Supreme Court. However, on the long journey, the gendarmes, French police officers, that guarded him, shot and killed him under the pretext that he had attempted to escape. Moreover, the author has investigated the other actions of the judge ad hoc. In truth, he was a lawyer for the large reed business &quot;Casagrande&quot; and of the &quot;Quiruvilca&quot; mine where the employees operated without a schedule and were victims of horrific working conditions. All of this highlights the political character of the criminal proceedings. With Vallejo it had tried to mock his generation, university students that attempted to rise up against the injustice and embraced anarchism and socialism, utopias of the century.

The judicial process was never closed. The poet left jail on behalf of a temporary release. Years later in Europe, he knew that he could never return to his home country. Jail and the &quot;hells&quot; revealed in this novel awaited him with an open door.

In 2007 the Judiciary of Peru vindicated Vallejo&#x27;s memory in a ceremony calling to the poet &quot;unfairly accused&quot;. Nonetheless, 1922 he published his second volume of poetry, &quot;Trilce,&quot; which is still considered one of the most radically avant-garde poetry collections in the Spanish language. After publishing the short story collections &quot;Escalas melografiadas&quot; and &quot;Fabla salvaje&quot; in 1923, Vallejo emigrated to Europe under the threat of further incarceration and remained there until his death in Paris in 1938.
His European years found him living in dire poverty in Paris, with the exception of three trips to the USSR and a couple of years in the early 1930s spent in exile in Spain. In those years he shared the poverty with Pablo Picasso. In 1926 he met his first French lover, Henriette Maisse, with whom he lived until their breakup in October 1928. In 1927 he had formally met Georgette Marie Philippart Travers (see Georgette Vallejo), whom he had seen when she was 17 and lived in his neighborhood. This was also the year of his first trip to Russia. They eventually became lovers, much to the dismay of her mother. Georgette traveled with him to Spain at the end of December 1930 and returned in January 1932. In 1930 the Spanish government awarded him a modest author&#x27;s grant. Vallejo became increasingly politically active in the early 1930s, joining the Peruvian Communist Party in 1931. When he returned to Paris, he also went on to Russia to participate in the International Congress of Writers&#x27; Solidarity towards the Soviet Regime (not to be confused with the First Congress of Soviet Writers of 1934, which solidified the parameters for Socialist Realism). Back in Paris, Vallejo married Georgette Philippart in 1934. His wife remained a controversial figure concerning the publication of Vallejo&#x27;s works for many years after his death.

A regular cultural contributor to weeklies in Lima, Vallejo also sent sporadic articles to newspapers and magazines in other parts of Latin America, Spain, Italy, and France. His USSR trips also led to two books of reportage he was able to get published early in the 1930s. Vallejo also prepared several theatrical works never performed during his lifetime, among them his drama &quot;Colacho Hermanos o Los Presidentes de America&quot; which shares content with another work he completed during this period, the socialist-realist novel &quot;El Tungsteno.&quot; He even wrote a children&#x27;s book, Paco Yunque. After becoming emotionally and intellectually involved in the Spanish Civil War, Vallejo had a final burst of poetic activity in the late 1930s, producing two books of poetry (both published posthumously) whose titles and proper organization remain a matter of debate: they were published as &quot;Poemas humanos&quot; and &quot;España, aparta de mí este cáliz.&quot;

===Death===
At the beginning of 1938, he worked as a language and literature professor in Paris, but in March he suffered from physical exhaustion. On March 24 he was hospitalized for an unknown disease (it was later understood that it was the reactivation of a kind of malaria, which he had suffered as a child), and on April 7 and 8 he became critically ill. He died a week later, on April 15, a holy, rainy Friday in Paris. It was not a Thursday, as he seemed to have predicted in his poem «&quot;Black Stone on a White Stone&quot;». His death was fictionalized in Roberto Bolaño&#x27;s novel &quot;Monsieur Pain.&quot; He was embalmed. His funeral eulogy was written by the French writer Louis Aragon. On April 19, his remains were transferred to the Mansion of Culture, and later to the Montrouge cemetery.

On April 3, 1970, his widow, Georgette Vallejo, had his remains moved and reinterred in the Montparnasse cemetery.

==Works==

===Los Heraldos Negros (1919)===
&quot;Los Heraldos Negros&quot; (The Black Messengers) was completed in 1918, but not published until 1919. In the 1993 edited volume &quot;Neruda and Vallejo: Selected Poems&quot;, Robert Bly describes this collection as &quot;a staggering book, sensual, prophetic, affectionate, wild,&quot; and as &quot;the greatest single collection of poems I have ever read.&quot; The title is likely suggestive of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, as the book touches on topics of religiosity, life and death.

* Poem: &quot;The Black Heralds&quot; 

:There are blows in life, so powerful . . . I don&#x27;t know!
:Blows as from God&#x27;s hatred; as if before them,
:the backlash of everything suffered
:were to dam up in the soul . . . I don&#x27;t know!

:They are few; but they are . . . They open dark furrows
:in the fiercest face and in the strongest side.
:Maybe they could be the horses of barbarous Attilas;
:or the black heralds Death sends us.

:They are the deep abysses of the soul&#x27;s Christs,
:of some revered faith Destiny blasphemes.
:Those gory blows are the cracklings of a bread
:that burns-up on us at the oven&#x27;s door.

:And man . . . Poor . . . poor! He turns his eyes,
:as when a slap on the shoulder calls us;
:he turns his crazed eyes, and everything lived
:is dammed up, like a pond of guilt, in his gaze.
:There are blows in life, so powerful . . . I don&#x27;t know!

===Trilce (1922)===
&quot;Trilce&quot;, published in 1922, anticipated much of the avant-garde movement that would develop in the 1920s and 1930s. Vallejo&#x27;s book takes language to a radical extreme, inventing words, stretching syntax, using automatic writing and other techniques now known as &quot;surrealist&quot; (though he did this &quot;before&quot; the Surrealist movement began). The book put Latin America at the center of the Avant-garde. Like James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake,&quot; &quot;Trilce&quot; borders on inaccessibility.

===España, Aparta de Mí Este Cáliz (1939)===
In &quot;España, aparta de mí este cáliz&quot; (Spain, Take This Chalice from Me), Vallejo takes the Spanish Civil War (1936–39) as a living representation of a struggle between good and evil forces, where he advocates for the triumph of mankind. This is symbolised in the salvation of the Second Spanish Republic (1931–39) that was being attacked by fascist allied forces led by General Franco. In 1994 Harold Bloom included &quot;España, Aparta de Mí Este Cáliz&quot; in his list of influential works of the Western Canon.

===Poemas Humanos (1939)===
&quot;Poemas Humanos&quot; &quot;(Human Poems)&quot;, published by the poet&#x27;s wife after his death, is a leftist work of political, socially oriented poetry. Although a few of these poems appeared in magazines during Vallejo&#x27;s lifetime, almost all of them were published posthumously. The poet never specified a title for this grouping, but while reading his body of work, his widow found that he had planned a book of &quot;human poems&quot;, which is why his editors decided on this title. Of this last written work, it was said&quot;... after a long silence, as if the presentiment of death might have urged him, he wrote in a few months the &quot;Poemas humanos&quot;.&quot;

===Plays===
Vallejo wrote five plays, none of which was staged or published during his lifetime.

&quot;Mampar&quot; is the subject of a critical letter from French actor and theatre director Louis Jouvet which says, in summary, &quot;Interesting, but terminally flawed&quot;. It deals with the conflict between a man and his mother-in-law. The text itself is lost, assumed to have been destroyed by Vallejo.

&quot;Lock-Out&quot; (1930, written in French; a Spanish translation by Vallejo himself is lost) deals with a labour struggle in a foundry.

&quot;Entre las dos orillas corre el río&quot; (1930s) was the product of a long and difficult birth. Titles of earlier versions include &quot;Varona Polianova&quot;, &quot;Moscú contra Moscú&quot;, &quot;El juego del amor, del odio y de la muerte&quot; and several variations on this latter title.

&quot;Colacho hermanos o Presidentes de América&quot; (1934). Satire displaying Peruvian democracy as a bourgeois farce under pressure from international companies and diplomacy.

&quot;La piedra cansada&quot; (1937), a poetic drama set in the Inca period and influenced by Greek tragedy.

===Essay===
Vallejo published a chronicles book entitled &quot;Russia in 1931. Reflections at the foot of the Kremlin&quot; (Madrid, 1931) and prepared another similar book for the presses titled &quot;Russia before the second five-year plan&quot; (finished in 1932 but was later published in 1965).

Also, he organized two prose books about essay and reflection: &quot;Against Professional Secrecy&quot; (written, according to Georgette, between 1923 and 1929), and &quot;Art and Revolution&quot; (written between 1929 and 1931), which bring together diverse articles, some which were published in magazines and newspapers during the lifetime of the author. No Spanish editorial wanted to publish these books because of their Marxist and revolutionary character. They would later be published in 1973.

===Novels===
&quot;El tungsteno&quot; (1931). A social realist novel depicting the oppression of native Peruvian miners and their communities by a foreign-owned tungsten mine.

&quot;Towards the kingdom of the Sciris&quot; (1928) is a historic short story dealing with the Incan theme.

&quot;Fabla Salvaje&quot; (1924) Literally &#x27;Wild Language&#x27;, is a short novel which follows the insanity of a character who lives in the Andes.

The children&#x27;s book, &quot;Paco Yunque&quot;, was rejected in Spain in 1930 for being too violent for children. But after it was published in Peru in the 1960s, it became mandatory reading in the elementary schools in Peru.

===Non-fiction===
&quot;Rusia en 1931, reflexiones al pie del Kremlin&quot; (&quot;Russia in 1931, reflections at the foot of the Kremlin&quot;), first published in 1931, is a journalistic work describing Vallejo&#x27;s impressions of the new socialist society that he saw being built in Soviet Russia.

&quot;Rusia ante el II Plan Quinquenal&quot; is a second work of Vallejo&#x27;s chronicles of his travels in Soviet Russia, focusing on Joseph Stalin&#x27;s second Five Year Plan. The book, originally written in 1931, was not published until 1965.

<text>Athanasius Kircher (2 May 1602 – 27 November 1680) was a German Jesuit scholar and polymath who published around 40 major works of comparative religion, geology, and medicine. Kircher has been compared to fellow Jesuit Roger Joseph Boscovich and to Leonardo da Vinci for his vast range of interests, and has been honoured with the title &quot;Master of a Hundred Arts&quot;. He taught for more than 40 years at the Roman College, where he set up a wunderkammer or cabinet of curiosities. A resurgence of interest in Kircher has occurred within the scholarly community in recent decades.

Kircher claimed to have deciphered the hieroglyphic writing of the ancient Egyptian language, but most of his assumptions and translations in the field turned out to be wrong. He did, however, correctly establish the link between the ancient Egyptian and the Coptic languages, and some commentators regard him as the founder of Egyptology. Kircher was also fascinated with Sinology and wrote an encyclopedia of China, where he revealed the early presence of Nestorian Christians while also attempting to establish links with Egypt and Christianity.

Kircher&#x27;s work in geology included studies of volcanoes and fossils. One of the first researchers to observe microbes through a microscope, Kircher was ahead of his time in proposing that the plague was caused by an infectious microorganism and in suggesting effective measures to prevent its spread. Kircher also displayed a keen interest in technology and mechanical inventions; inventions attributed to him include a magnetic clock, various automatons and the first megaphone. The invention of the magic lantern has been misattributed to Kircher, although he conducted a study of the principles involved in his &quot;Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae&quot;.

A scientific star in his day, towards the end of his life he was eclipsed by the rationalism of René Descartes and others. In the late 20th century, however, the aesthetic qualities of his work again began to be appreciated. One modern scholar, Alan Cutler, described Kircher as &quot;a giant among seventeenth-century scholars&quot;, and &quot;one of the last thinkers who could rightfully claim all knowledge as his domain&quot;. Another scholar, Edward W. Schmidt, referred to Kircher as &quot;the last Renaissance man&quot;. In &quot;A Man of Misconceptions,&quot; his 2012 book about Kircher, John Glassie wrote &quot;many of Kircher&#x27;s actual ideas today seem wildly off-base, if not simply bizarre,&quot; but he was &quot;a champion of wonder, a man of awe-inspiring erudition and inventiveness,&quot; whose work was read &quot;by the smartest minds of the time.&quot;

==Life==
Kircher was born on 2 May in either 1601 or 1602 (he himself did not know) in Geisa, Buchonia, near Fulda (Thuringia, Germany). From his birthplace, he took the epithets &quot;Bucho, Buchonius&quot; and &quot;Fuldensis&quot; which he sometimes added to his name. He attended the Jesuit College in Fulda from 1614 to 1618, when he entered the novitiate of the Society.

The youngest of nine children, Kircher studied volcanoes owing to his passion for rocks and eruptions. He was taught Hebrew by a rabbi in addition to his studies at school. He studied philosophy and theology at Paderborn, but fled to Cologne in 1622 to escape advancing Protestant forces. On the journey, he narrowly escaped death after falling through the ice crossing the frozen Rhine — one of several occasions on which his life was endangered. Later, traveling to Heiligenstadt, he was caught and nearly hanged by a party of Protestant soldiers. 

From 1622 to 1624 Kircher was sent to begin his regency period in Koblenz as a teacher. This was followed by assignment to Heiligenstadt, where he taught mathematics, Hebrew and Syriac, and produced a show of fireworks and moving scenery for the visiting Elector Archbishop of Mainz, showing early evidence of his interest in mechanical devices. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1628 and became professor of ethics and mathematics at the University of Würzburg, where he also taught Hebrew and Syriac. Beginning in 1628, he began to show an interest in Egyptian hieroglyphs.

In 1631, while still at Würzburg, Kircher allegedly had a prophetic vision of bright light and armed men with horses in the city. Würzburg was attacked shortly afterwards and captured, leading to Kircher being accorded respect for predicting the disaster via astrology, though Kircher privately insisted that he had not relied on it. This was the year that Kircher published his first book (the &quot;Ars Magnesia&quot;, reporting his research on magnetism), but having been caught up in the Thirty Years&#x27; War he was driven to the papal University of Avignon in France. In 1633 he was called to Vienna by the emperor to succeed Kepler as Mathematician to the Habsburg court. On the intervention of Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc, the order was rescinded, and he was sent instead to Rome to continue with his scholarly work, but he had already embarked for Vienna.

On the way, his ship was blown off course and he arrived in Rome before he knew of the changed destination. He based himself in the city for the rest of his life, and from 1634 he taught mathematics, physics and Oriental languages at the Collegio Romano (now the Pontifical Gregorian University) for several years before being released to devote himself to research. He studied malaria and the plague, amassing a collection of antiquities, which he exhibited along with devices of his own creation in the Museum Kircherianum.

In 1661, Kircher discovered the ruins of a church said to have been constructed by Constantine on the site of Saint Eustace&#x27;s vision of a crucifix in a stag&#x27;s horns. He raised money to pay for the church&#x27;s reconstruction as the &quot;,&quot; and his heart was buried in the church upon his death. 

==Works==

Kircher published many substantial books on a wide variety of subjects such as Egyptology, geology, and music theory. His syncretic approach disregarded conventional boundaries between disciplines: his &quot;Magnes&quot;, for example, ostensibly discussed magnetism, but also explored other modes of attraction such as gravity and love. Perhaps Kircher&#x27;s best-known work is &quot;Oedipus Aegyptiacus&quot; (1652–54), a vast study of Egyptology and comparative religion.

His books, written in Latin, were widely circulated in the 17th century, and contributed to the wide dissemination of scientific information. Kircher is not considered to have made any significant original contributions, although some discoveries and inventions (e.g., the magic lantern) have sometimes been mistakenly attributed to him.

In his foreword to &quot;Ars Magna Sciendi Sive Combinatoria&quot; (The Great Art of Knowledge, or the Combinatorial Art), the inscription reads:
===Linguistic and cultural studies===
====Egyptology====

The last known example of Egyptian hieroglyphics dates from AD 394, after which all knowledge of hieroglyphics was lost. Until Thomas Young and Jean-François Champollion found the key to hieroglyphics in the 19th century, the main authority was the 4th-century Greek grammarian Horapollon, whose chief contribution was the misconception that hieroglyphics were &quot;picture writing&quot; and that future translators should look for symbolic meaning in the pictures.

The first modern study of hieroglyphics came with Piero Valeriano Bolzani&#x27;s &quot;Hieroglyphica&quot; (1556). Kircher was the most famous of the &quot;decipherers&quot; between ancient and modern times and the most famous Egyptologist of his day. In his &quot;Lingua Aegyptiaca Restituta&quot; (1643), Kircher called hieroglyphics &quot;this language hitherto unknown in Europe, in which there are as many pictures as letters, as many riddles as sounds, in short as many mazes to be escaped from as mountains to be climbed&quot;. While some of his notions are long discredited, portions of his work have been valuable to later scholars, and Kircher helped pioneer Egyptology as a field of serious study.

Kircher&#x27;s interest in Egyptology began in 1628 when he became intrigued by a collection of hieroglyphs in the library at Speyer. He learned Coptic in 1633 and published its first grammar in 1636, the &quot;Prodromus coptus sive aegyptiacus&quot;. Kircher then broke with Horapollon&#x27;s interpretation of hieroglyphs with his &quot;Lingua aegyptiaca restituta&quot;. Kircher argued that Coptic preserved the last development of ancient Egyptian. For this Kircher has been considered the true &quot;founder of Egyptology&quot;, because his work was conducted &quot;before the discovery of the Rosetta Stone rendered Egyptian hieroglyphics comprehensible to scholars&quot;. He also recognized the relationship between hieratic and hieroglyphic scripts.

Between 1650 and 1654, Kircher published four volumes of &quot;translations&quot; of hieroglyphs in the context of his Coptic studies. However, according to Steven Frimmer, &quot;none of them even remotely fitted the original texts&quot;. In &quot;Oedipus Aegyptiacus&quot;, Kircher argued under the impression of the &quot;Hieroglyphica&quot; that ancient Egyptian was the language spoken by Adam and Eve, that Hermes Trismegistus was Moses, and that hieroglyphs were occult symbols which &quot;cannot be translated by words, but expressed only by marks, characters and figures.&quot; This led him to translate the simple hieroglyphic text &quot;ḏd Wsr&quot; (&quot;Osiris says&quot;) as &quot;The treachery of Typhon ends at the throne of Isis; the moisture of nature is guarded by the vigilance of Anubis&quot;

Egyptologist E. A. Wallis Budge mentioned Kircher as the foremost of writers who &quot;pretended to have found the key to the hieroglyphics&quot; and called his translations in &quot;Oedipus Aegyptiacus&quot; &quot;utter nonsense, but as they were put forth in a learned tongue many people at the time believed they were correct.&quot; Although Kircher&#x27;s approach to deciphering texts was based on a fundamental misconception, some modern commentators have described Kircher as the pioneer of the serious study of hieroglyphs. The data which he collected were later consulted by Champollion in his successful efforts to decode the script. According to Joseph MacDonnell, it was &quot;because of Kircher&#x27;s work that scientists knew what to look for when interpreting the Rosetta stone&quot;. Another scholar of ancient Egypt, Erik Iversen, concluded:
Kircher was also actively involved in the erection of the Pamphilj obelisk, and added &quot;hieroglyphs&quot; of his design in the blank areas. Rowland 2002 concluded that Kircher made use of Pythagorean principles to read hieroglyphs of the Pamphili Obelisk, and used the same form of interpretation when reading scripture.

====Sinology====

Kircher had an early interest in China, telling his superior in 1629 that he wished to become a missionary to that country. In 1667 he published a treatise whose full title was &quot;China monumentis, qua sacris qua profanis, nec non variis naturae &amp; artis spectaculis, aliarumque rerum memorabilium argumentis illustrata&quot;, and which is commonly known simply as &quot;China Illustrata&quot;, i.e. &quot;China Illustrated&quot;. It was a work of encyclopedic breadth, combining material of unequal quality, from accurate cartography to mythical elements, such as a study of dragons. The work drew heavily on the reports of Jesuits working in China, in particular Michael Boym and Martino Martini.

&quot;China Illustrata&quot; emphasized the Christian elements of Chinese history, both real and imagined: the book noted the early presence of Nestorian Christians (with a Latin translation of the Nestorian Stele of Xi&#x27;an provided by Boym and his Chinese collaborator, Andrew Zheng), but also claimed that the Chinese were descended from the sons of Ham, that Confucius was Hermes Trismegistus/Moses and that the Chinese characters were abstracted hieroglyphs.

In Kircher&#x27;s system, ideograms were inferior to hieroglyphs because they referred to specific ideas rather than to mysterious complexes of ideas, while the signs of the Maya and Aztecs were yet lower pictograms which referred only to objects. Umberto Eco comments that this idea reflected and supported the ethnocentric European attitude toward Chinese and native American civilizations:

&quot;China was presented not as an unknown barbarian to be defeated but as a prodigal son who should return to the home of the common father&quot;. (p. 69)

====Biblical studies and exegesis====
In 1675, he published &quot;Arca Noë&quot;, the results of his research on the biblical Ark of Noah — following the Counter-Reformation, allegorical interpretation was giving way to the study of the Old Testament as literal truth among Scriptural scholars. Kircher analyzed the dimensions of the Ark; based on the number of species known to him (excluding insects and other forms thought to arise spontaneously), he calculated that overcrowding would not have been a problem. He also discussed the logistics of the Ark voyage, speculating on whether extra livestock was brought to feed carnivores and what the daily schedule of feeding and caring for animals must have been.

====Other cultural work====
Kircher was sent the Voynich Manuscript in 1666 by Johannes Marcus Marci in the hope of Kircher being able to decipher it. The manuscript remained in the Collegio Romano until Victor Emmanuel II of Italy annexed the Papal States in 1870, though scepticism as to the authenticity of the story and of the origin of the manuscript itself exists. In his &quot;Polygraphia Nova&quot; (1663), Kircher proposed an artificial universal language.

===Physical sciences===
====Geology====
On a visit to southern Italy in 1638, the ever-curious Kircher was lowered into the crater of Vesuvius, then on the brink of eruption, to examine its interior. He was also intrigued by the subterranean rumbling which he heard at the Strait of Messina. His geological and geographical investigations culminated in his &quot;Mundus Subterraneus&quot; of 1664, in which he suggested that the tides were caused by water moving to and from a subterranean ocean.

Kircher was also puzzled by fossils. He understood that fossils were the remains of animals. He ascribed large bones to giant races of humans. Not all the objects which he was attempting to explain were in fact fossils, hence the diversity of explanations. He interpreted mountain ranges as the Earth&#x27;s skeletal structures exposed by weathering.

&quot;Mundus Subterraneus&quot; includes several pages about the legendary island of Atlantis including a map with the Latin caption &quot;Situs Insulae Atlantidis, a Mari olim absorpte ex mente Egyptiorum et Platonis Description,&quot; translating as &quot;Site of the island of Atlantis, in the sea, from Egyptian sources and Plato&#x27;s description.&quot;

====Biology====
In his book &quot;Arca Noë&quot;, Kircher argued that after the Flood new species were transformed as they moved into different environments, for example, when a deer moved into a colder climate, it became a reindeer. He wrote that many species were hybrids of other species, for example, armadillos from a combination of turtles and porcupines. He also advocated the theory of spontaneous generation. Because of such hypotheses, some historians have held that Kircher was a proto-evolutionist.

====Medicine====
Kircher took a modern approach to the study of diseases as early as 1646 by using a microscope to investigate the blood of plague victims. In his &quot;Scrutinium Pestis&quot; of 1658, he observed the presence of &quot;little worms&quot; or &quot;animalcules&quot; in the blood and concluded that the disease was caused by microorganisms. That was correct, although it is likely that what he saw were red or white blood cells and not the plague agent, &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;. He also proposed hygienic measures to prevent the spread of disease, such as isolation, quarantine, burning clothes worn by the infected and wearing facemasks to prevent the inhalation of germs.

===Technology===
In 1646, Kircher published &quot;Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae&quot;, concerning the display of images on a screen using an apparatus similar to the magic lantern developed by Christiaan Huygens and others. Kircher described the construction of a &quot;catoptric lamp&quot; that used reflection to project images on the wall of a darkened room. Although Kircher did not invent the device, he improved it and suggested methods by which exhibitors could use his device. Much of the significance of his work arises from Kircher&#x27;s rational approach towards the demystification of projected images.

Previously, such images had been used in Europe to mimic supernatural appearances (Kircher himself cites the use of displayed images by the rabbis in the court of King Solomon). Kircher stressed that exhibitors should take great care to inform spectators that such images were purely naturalistic, and not magical.

Kircher constructed a magnetic clock, which he explained in his &quot;Magnes&quot; (1641). The clock had been invented by another Jesuit, Fr. Linus of Liege, and was described by an acquaintance of Line&#x27;s in 1634. Kircher&#x27;s patron Peiresc had claimed that the clock&#x27;s motion supported the Copernican cosmological model, arguing that the magnetic sphere in the clock rotated by the magnetic force of the sun.

Kircher&#x27;s model disproved that hypothesis, showing that the motion could be produced by a water clock in the base of the device. Although Kircher disputed the Copernican model in his &quot;Magnes&quot;, supporting instead that of Tycho Brahe, his later &quot;Itinerarium exstaticum&quot; (1656, revised 1671), presented several systems — including the Copernican — as distinct possibilities. The clock has been reconstructed by Caroline Bouguereau in collaboration with Michael John Gorman and is on display at the Green Library at Stanford University.

The &quot;Musurgia Universalis&quot; (1650) sets out Kircher&#x27;s views on music: he believed that the harmony of music reflected the proportions of the universe. The book includes plans for constructing water-powered automatic organs, notations of birdsong and diagrams of musical instruments. One illustration shows the differences between the ears of humans and other animals. In &quot;Phonurgia Nova&quot; (1673) Kircher considered the possibilities of transmitting music to remote places.

Other machines designed by Kircher include an aeolian harp, automatons such as a statue which spoke and listened via a speaking tube, a perpetual motion machine, and a Katzenklavier (&quot;cat piano&quot;). The Katzenklavier would have driven spikes into the tails of cats, which would yowl to specified pitches but was never constructed.

In &quot;Phonurgia Nova&quot;, literally &quot;new methods of sound production&quot;, Kircher examined acoustic phenomena. He explored the use of horns and cones in amplifying sound for architectural applications. He also examined echoes in rooms using domes of different shapes, including the muffling effect of an elliptical dome from Heidelberg. In one section he explored the therapeutic effects of music in tarantism, a theme from southern Italy.

===Combinatorics===
Although Kircher&#x27;s work was not mathematically based, he did develop systems for generating and counting all combinations of a finite collection of objects (i.e., a finite set), based on the previous work of Ramon Llull. His methods and diagrams are discussed in &quot;Ars Magna Sciendi, sive Combinatoria&quot;, 1669. They include what may be the first recorded drawings of complete bipartite graphs, extending a similar technique used by Llull to visualize complete graphs. Kircher also employed combinatorics in his Arca Musarithmica, an aleatoric music device capable of composing millions of church hymns by combining randomly selected musical phrases.

==Legacy==
===Scholarly influence===
For most of his professional life, Kircher was one of the scientific stars of his world: according to historian Paula Findlen, he was &quot;the first scholar with a global reputation&quot;. His importance was twofold: to the results of his own experiments and research he added information gleaned from his correspondence with over 760 scientists, physicians and above all his fellow Jesuits in all parts of the globe. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; calls him a &quot;one-man intellectual clearing house&quot;. His works, illustrated by his orders, were extremely popular, and he was the first scientist to be able to support himself through the sale of his books. His near-exact contemporary, the English philosopher-physician, Sir Thomas Browne (1605–82) collected his books avidly while his eldest son Edward Browne in 1665 visited the Jesuit priest resident at Rome. Towards the end of Kircher&#x27;s life, however, his stock fell, as the rationalist Cartesian approach began to dominate (Descartes himself described Kircher as &quot;more quacksalver than savant&quot;).

===Cultural legacy===
Kircher was largely neglected until the late 20th century. One writer attributes his rediscovery to the similarities between his eclectic approach and postmodernism.

As few of Kircher&#x27;s works have been translated, the contemporary emphasis has been on their aesthetic qualities rather than their actual content, and a succession of exhibitions have highlighted the beauty of their illustrations. Historian Anthony Grafton has said that &quot;the staggeringly strange dark continent of Kircher&#x27;s work [is] the setting for a Borges story that was never written&quot;, while Umberto Eco has written about Kircher in his novel &quot;The Island of the Day Before&quot;, as well as in his non-fiction works &quot;The Search for the Perfect Language&quot; and &quot;Serendipities&quot;. In the historical novel Imprimatur by Monaldi &amp; Sorti (2002), Kircher plays a major role. Shortly after his death, some travellers are locked up in a hotel in Baroque Rome by the papal health authorities because of an epidemic of plague. Kircher&#x27;s theory about the healing power of music is remembered by the protagonists in various flashbacks and finally provides the key to the puzzle. In &quot;Where Tigers Are At Home&quot;, by Jean-Marie Blas de Roblès, the protagonist works on a translation of a bogus 17th-century biography of Kircher. The contemporary artist Cybèle Varela has paid tribute to Kircher in her exhibition &quot;Ad Sidera per Athanasius Kircher&quot;, held in the , in the same place where the Museum Kircherianum was.

The Museum of Jurassic Technology in Los Angeles has a hall dedicated to the life of Kircher. His ethnographic collection is in the Pigorini National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography in Rome.

John Glassie&#x27;s book, &quot;A Man of Misconceptions,&quot; traces connections between Kircher and figures such as Gianlorenzo Bernini, René Descartes, and Isaac Newton. It also suggests influences on Edgar Allan Poe, Franz Anton Mesmer, Jules Verne, and Marcel Duchamp.

In the end, Glassie writes, Kircher should be acknowledged “for his effort to know everything and to share everything he knew, for asking a thousand questions about the world around him, and for getting so many others to ask questions about his answers; for stimulating, as well as confounding and inadvertently amusing, so many minds; for having been a source of so many ideas—right, wrong, half-right, half-baked, ridiculous, beautiful, and all-encompassing.”

==In popular culture==
Kircher&#x27;s life and research are central to the plot of James Rollin&#x27;s 2015 novel &quot;The Bone Labyrinth&quot;.

He is also mentioned in &quot;The Book of Life&quot;, the third book in the All Souls Trilogy by Deborah Harkness.

He further appears in two separate episodes in Daniel Kehlmann&#x27;s novel &quot;Tyll&quot; (2017).

The permanent exhibition &quot;The World Is Bound with Secret Knots&quot; at the Museum of Jurassic Technology is based on the life and work of Kircher and uses elaborate 3D technology to highlight the magical quality of many of his ideas and images.

He is also a character (though largely off-stage, he is often mentioned by other characters) in the &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; alternate history series (published by Baen). In it, he was sent back to Germany in the early 1630s, where he became the unofficial pastor of the Catholic church in the temporally transplanted town of Grantville, Thuringia-Franconia.

Kircher features as a favourite author of Father Chmielowski in Olga Tokarczuk&#x27;s &quot;The Books of Jacob&quot;.

<text>Criticism of globalization is skepticism of the claimed benefits of globalization. Many of these views are held by the anti-globalization movement. Globalization has created much global and internal unrest in many countries. While the dynamics of capitalism are changing and each country is unique in its political makeup, globalization is a set-in-stone &quot;program&quot; that is difficult to implement without political unrest. Globalization can be partly responsible for the current global economic crisis. Case studies of Thailand and the Arab nations&#x27; view of globalization show that globalization is a threat to culture and religion, and it harms indigenous people groups while multinational corporations profit from it. Although globalization has promised an improved standard of living and economic development, it has been heavily criticized for its production of negative effects. Globalization is not simply an economic project, but it also heavily influences the country environmentally, politically, and socially as well.

== Economic impacts ==
=== Global Economic Crisis ===
The Global Economic Crisis, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, can be partially attributed to globalization. Although globalization promised an improved standard of living, it has actually worsened the financial situation of many homes and has made the financial crisis global through the influences of international financial institutions such as the World Bank. Globalization limits development and civilization to a path that only leads to a Western and capitalistic system. Because of the political and structural differences in countries, the implementation of globalization has been detrimental for many countries.

=== Wage Inequality ===

Research has indicated that throughout the 1990s, there was an increase in both globalization and economic inequality. As a result of this change, which is linked to globalization, an increasing number of people are criticizing globalization as a whole.

=== Unemployment ===
There is also debate over how globalization affects employment. There is less domestic manufacture of everyday products as a result of globalization. When buyers search for a product, they will usually choose the least expensive option, and occasionally US-made items cannot compete with the pricing of goods manufactured elsewhere.

It was found in a study done in 2013 that the Chinese import competition led to a loss of employment for 548,000 workers between 1990 and 2000. There is a dearth of industrial and production activity in many nations, particularly in recent times, which has left many people jobless. The decrease in jobs, according to many who oppose globalization, is the result of numerous rivals, particularly foreign ones. In general, domestic laborers and businesses have a considerably harder time thriving while overseas pricing continue to be lower and far more competitive.

== Political impacts ==
=== Globalization as American hegemony ===
English Philosopher John Gray described globalization as post-Cold War American triumphalism, and stated &quot;global laissez-faire is an American project&quot;. Gray points out that the American system of Globalization is past its prime and is no longer sustainable in the modern world. Globalization in the United States began with the common goal of forming a global collective that facilitates a steady stream of trade, internationalism, and collaboration in various sectors to promote peace and prosperity. Some scholars and critics say the Washington Consensus played a role in solidifying the United States as one of the core nation-states at the heart of the system of global capitalism in the post-Cold War era. However, this system has been openly criticized by some, mainly by examination of the United States today. In the United States, there are high levels of economic and social inequalities feeding an ever-growing disparity between the upper and lower class. Furthermore, the United States has the single highest rate of incarcerations, one of the highest GINI scores of income inequality, and a great deal of economic uncertainty sweeping the nation.

One of the many criticisms that follows is that the influence of the American system on other countries may reproduce these negative effects. Other critics argue that globalization is hurting the domestic economy rather than foreign states under its influence. Namely, former United States President Donald Trump, who announced he felt that America had lost its former high regard and had become a laughing stock on the world stage. He openly voiced these opinions during a U.N. General Assembly stating &quot;We reject globalism and embrace the doctrine of patriotism”. This was the intro to a tirade on globalization&#x27;s harmful effects and a defense on the withdrawal of the United States from various U.N. councils. More broadly, many Americans have a feeling of being forgotten or swept up by globalization and its lasting effects, according to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center. According to the survey, these feelings were brought on by the rising cost of living, culture shifts, industry decline, and the rising influence of multinational corporations.

=== Power of transnational corporations ===
In the process of implementing globalization in developing countries, the selection of winners and losers is often predetermined. Multinational corporations often benefit from globalization, while poor indigenous locals are negatively affected and often exploited. The power of transnational companies inflicts a major threat for indigenous tribes and other small colonies residing in larger nations opting towards globalization. Transnational companies exploit the local land and resources of the families belonging to these tribes for their businesses. An example of this occurring is large palm oil companies receiving land to develop from the government that is occupied by the indigenous tribes. This has led to massive deforestation and a silent human rights crisis. Globalization can be seen as a new form of colonization or imperialism, as economic inequality and the rise in unemployment have followed with its implementation. Globalization has been criticized for benefiting those who are already large and in power at the cost of endangering the countries’ indigenous population. Furthermore, globalization is non-democratic, as it is enforced through top-down methods. In the name of free markets and with the promise of an improved standard of living, local authorities give up some of their political and social powers to international organizations. Thus, globalization causes the greater empowerment of these international organizations and the diminishing influence of local state institutions.

== Environmental impacts ==

=== Case study of Thailand’s Pak Mun River ===
In the late 1970s and 1980s, hydropower dam projects were conducted in order to recreate Thailand&#x27;s economy into an export-oriented economy. The projects were funded by loans from the World Bank and was part of globalization efforts. The local villagers whom the project would directly affect were not notified, and the World Bank disregarded their concerns. As a result of the building of the dams, villages that heavily depended on the river lost their livelihood and their means of economic gains (i.e., fishing). The projects contaminated the river, which made the river unfit for villagers to drink, bathe, and do laundry without experiencing negative health conditions such as rashes. Furthermore, the projects resulted in the extinction of 40 edible plant species, 45 mushroom species, and 10 bamboo species, all of which the income of the local markets were dependent on, some of which were important for medical usage. The decline in fish population exterminated fishermen&#x27;s ways of life, as 169 different fish species were affected and 56 species became extinct. The globalization efforts in Thailand resulted in environmental impacts that affected the social and economic welfare of indigenous populations.

=== Decreased Biodiversity ===
Human activities largely attribute to the world&#x27;s expanding decrease in biodiversity; human impact on ecosystems can be measured by biological diversity. Harmful effects from globalization are visible from reduced genetic diversity in agriculture from the loss of crop varieties and livestock breeds, loss of biological species, increase of &quot;exotic species&quot; which live outside their natural geographic range, pollution in Earth&#x27;s natural elements such as air, water, soil, rapid climate change, exhaustion of resources, and social or spiritual disruption.

Agricultural effects have been documented for all food plants from vegetables, grains, and tree tops. Since 1970, over a thousand independent seed companies have been purchased by pharmaceutical, petrochemical, and other transnational corporations. As transnationals drop all but the profitable seed varieties there is a significant loss of germ plasm. The Garden Seed Inventory has listed all commercially available, non-hybrid vegetable varieties in the United States and Canada, and shows that beet roots, cabbage, and broccoli will diminish as a result of globalization faster than per capita income increases.

Loss of domestic livestock including the ever-diminishing Haiti Creole Pigs also demonstrates the pressures of globalization. They were nearly killed off due to a disease control effort to &quot;integrate Haiti into the hemispheric economy.&quot; There were efforts to try replacing the pigs with those from Iowa from the United States, but the costly project was a failure since the pigs needs could not be met, leading to Haiti suffering a US$600 million loss.

=== Animal Livelihood Threats ===
Extinction rates exceed usual rates in the 21st century than ever in evolutionary history. In the second half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st, global trade and expansion was growing rapidly; however, this increase in new technology and exploitation of natural areas has led to a species lost comparable to the great extinctions of early geological times. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warns that corporations have prioritized high-output breeds over gene pools that could ensure future food security; about 20 percent of domestic animals are near-extinction, with a breed lost each month. Of the 7,600 FAO breeds logged in the farm animal genetics resources, 190 have gone extinct in the past 15 years with another 1,500 species at risk of extinction. Globalization of livestock markets is one of the largest factor affecting animal livelihood.

The factors resulting in habitat destruction can be narrowed down to: exploitations of populations and natural areas for production or trade, increased housing, agriculture, overfishing, road building, mining, and dam construction. There are also subtle effects of globalization on wild species, expansions of ecotourism-based industries, changes in land-use practice, and competition for resources has increased contact between wildlife and humans. It has also introduced human-pathogens to wild species such as &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; in mongooses of Botswana. The resulting mortality in mongooses has been near-extinction threatening.

=== Increased Emissions ===
Globalization is criticized for its role in increasing carbon dioxide emissions. The increased volume of international trade increases energy consumption as seen in a 2001 study revealing a relationship between economic globalization and trade openness leads to energy consumption and emissions. International trade relies on various means of transportation including trains, trucks, planes, boats, and ships, each emitting a large quantity of emissions. The development of the transportation sector has greatly contributed to the rise of greenhouse gas; the transportation sector in the United States alone emits 1.9 billion tons of annually. The farther a good travels, the more fuel is burned, releasing . These emissions contribute to climate change, ocean acidification, and decreased biodiversity.

Moreover, the good being traded is created using electricity and intermediate goods, which are oftentimes products from international trading. In 2018, countries under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (China, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and ten countries of ASEAN) accounted for 39.1% of global emissions. Through globalization, trade partnerships have been created to facilitate easy international trade for intermediate goods. This ease allows for more goods to be traded internationally for a cheaper export price, encouraging foreign countries to continue transporting goods, and thus increasing emissions.

=== Invasive Species ===
Globalization intensifies the spread of invasive species through the increase of trade transportation. Today, the development of trading has open trade routes and markets across the globe. The increased methods of transportation allows living organisms to latch on to the shipping containers and travel to a new location where it can grow invasive without the checks and balances present in its natural environment. Rising volumes of air and ship transport are identified as the main source of marine invasions.

Invasive species contribute to economic harm by altering the ecosystem, causing native biodiversity loss, and preventing native plant growth. Scientists say that invasive species creates lasting effects on the environment. A 2006 study found that the invader garlic mustard virtually eliminated all mycorrhizal fungi colonization, which dramatically damaged the ability for native canopy species to regenerate. The invader&#x27;s antifungal effects reduced the seeding growth of mycorrhizal fungi-dependent plants, and the effects of the garlic mustard were still recorded 2 years after its removal.

=== Decreased Renewable Resources ===
Globalization promotes the transportation of materials from one country to another, allowing more finite resources to be used up. The need for coal in the world is seen through the trade and transportation of the material across the globe. Coal is most desired due to its cheap extraction price, local availability, and necessity in basic items such as steel, concrete, and electricity. In fact, 23% of all electricity in the United States is generated by coal, demonstrating reliance on the resource.

China joined the world trade organization in December 2001 with an average of 2.5 billion tons of coal being supplied each year, and by 2011, their coal usage nearly doubled to 4 billion metric tons. Further examples of increased coal usage due to international trading include India, the United States, and Indonesia. However, coal is not an infinite source of energy. The U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated in 2020 that the recoverable coal reserves will last 470 years, and the coal produced from mines will last 25 years. As a result of globalization, more resources are being used up in a faster period of time, which will eventually lead to the demise of resources.

== Social impacts ==

=== Prejudice ===
Professor Conor Gearty, of the London School of Economics, has suggested that global freedom of movement, brought on by globalization, has increased the scope for prejudice within societies.

=== Education ===
Globalization creates an incentive for nations to produce individuals who are competitive and marketable. In many countries educational policy and administration has shifted to emphasize efficiency and marketability instead of traditional &#x27;soft&#x27; skills. Education is being restructured on market principles - thus, in the realm of higher education, knowledge production and dissemination is becoming commodified. As knowledge management is coming to outweigh labor on the global stage, there is an increasing prevalence of neoliberal economic ideologies. A direct result of this change is the mass privatization of institutions of higher education. Because of privatization and corporatization, public universities are coming to run like for-profit businesses. Thus, universities must find alternative sources of funding, leading to a reliance on the market. Though globalization has increased access to education, in many places it has also made it more unequal in quality.

== Psychological impacts ==
=== Identity ===
The collision between global and local cultures has created challenges in adapting to and reconciling the two. Globalization and the introduction of the Western culture in different countries have shown to produce bicultural identities, identity confusion, and self-selected cultures.

Bicultural identity is defined as one adapting to the global culture while simultaneously being familiar with local traditions. As a result, two identities are formed: global identity and local identity. One&#x27;s global identity allows one to participate and succeed globally by being able to relate to those outside of one&#x27;s local sphere. One&#x27;s local identity allows one to still be relevant to family and friends nearby. Often, those experiencing globalization in their country are seen to develop a &quot;hybrid identity&quot; in which their global and local identities are merged. This can also be seen with immigrants.

However, adapting to both cultures may be difficult, especially if the distance between the two cultures is great. In these cases, globalization may cause identity confusion, preventing the proper development of identity and self (Erikson&#x27;s theory of identity formation). Similarly, globalization may create a crisis which John Berry calls marginalization, in which one is unable to identify with local culture due to the heavy exposure of globalization and Western influences; however one is also excluded from the global culture as well.

The implementation of globalization requires a certain degree of culture shedding, as global culture alters and disrupts the pre-existing local culture. This also leads to identity confusion, primarily in adolescents.

== Cultural impacts ==
=== Urban and adolescent issues ===
Many times, in countries where globalization is introduced, problems that arise among adolescents are often blamed to the intrusion of Western culture and ideals through globalization. Adolescents are most vulnerable and receptive to the introduction of new cultures. Developing countries where Western values and technology have been introduced are more aware of current events taking place in other countries, and adolescents and youths can be seen copying American fashion and music styles. Therefore, Western media is blamed for the rise in premarital sex and teenage pregnancies that follow when globalization is introduced.

Globalization claims to have improved countries’ global status. However, companies attempting to compete globally have exploited workers, and global competition has been achieved through poor working conditions. Furthermore, due to global influences, juvenile crimes have increased because of the disruption of traditional norms.

=== Arab and Muslim countries ===
The Arab and Islamic countries see globalization as an attempt to instill Western superiority and a threat to the preservation of their cultural identity. Although differing views of globalization exist among Arab nations, a large percentage of Muslims see it to be imperialistic and a cultural invasion that attempts to destroy their heritage and cultural beliefs.

Despite the differing opinions of globalization, almost all acknowledge and believe that globalization is simply Americanism— the implementation of American cultures and ideals into other countries.

Globalization is especially threatening to Arab nations because Islam is not simply a religious practice, but it dominates laws and social norms such as marriages and spending habits. Since globalization is seen to be a way of secularizing a nation, Muslims also see it as a cultural and religious invasion, requiring the separation of religion and daily life. Radicalists see it as a perversion of pure Islamic doctrine, as globalization is seen to merge the domain of Islam (Dar al-Islam) and the domain of infidelity (Dar-al-Kufr).

The Western influence on media is also unwelcome. The Western control of media is viewed as a way to brainwash young Muslims to strip them of their nationality and cultural heritage. They also oppose the creation of a new, global, hegemonic culture, referencing Quran 49:13 which states that God has purposefully divided mankind into different nations and tribes. Arab intellectuals have stated that globalization rids the earth of human cultural diversity and civilizations’ peculiarities, which many see as barbaric. Authors and publishers have expressed fear of Western ideals penetrating their nations.

=== Language death ===
Globalization has been identified as one of the main factors behind language death. Globalization forces languages into unequal interactions with each other where languages of developing countries with many speakers dominate those with fewer speakers and of developing or undeveloped areas. Speakers of minority languages are pressured economically and socially to abandon their languages in favor of global ones such as English, which results in decline and eventual disappearance of numerous cultures and languages worldwide.

Despite the fact that more languages are now declining or dying than ever before, there is a common belief that a reduction in the number of spoken languages can be beneficial to humanity, or that language death should be allowed to take place as a natural process. This belief is rejected by most linguists, such as David Crystal and Martin J. Ball. Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o denounces the view that language death is either beneficial or necessary as an example of Social Darwinism and cultural colonialism, as language loss leads to breakdown of social bonds, and a loss of one&#x27;s cultural autonomy, self-identity and connection to one&#x27;s land and ancestors. According to Max Weber, language establishes a connection to and perception of the material reality of its speaker. Language is a way of &quot;mastering reality&quot;, providing intimacy and familitarity with the environment and the surrounding world, and enabling participation in the local community. Therefore, Weber argues that language loss causes a displacement of an entire culture, depriving the affected peoples of their community and way of life. 

Salikoko Mufwene argues that the progressing language loss is not natural, but artificial - the severity of current language loss exceeds the limits of natural language shift. Additionally, natural processes of language shift have been found to progress towards larger amounts of languages, not fewer. Mufwene also notes that language loss is caused by political, economic and social pressures of the dominant language, rather than any natural process. Many regimes had pursued a &quot;one-language policy&quot; that teaches pupils the dominant language only, while discouraging or penalizing the usage of minority or regional languages; examples of such policy include the dialect card in Japan and &quot;vergonha&quot; in France. Speakers of minority languages experience economic or social discrimination, which only ceases once they abandon their language in favour of the dominant one. Therefore, speakers of a language are pressured into abandoning it, rather than voluntarily doing so. 

David Crystal argues that a global language will fail to bring about peace or global solidarity, listing Vietnam, Cambodia, Rwanda, and Burundi as examples of overwhelmingly monolingual nations that nevertheless experienced frequent wars. He also argues that language is an example of human capital that allows individuals to increase the value of their productivity; being multilingual creates an industry on its own and brings both financial as well as non-financial benefits, such as wider horizons and social acceptance. Crystal also notes that languages strongly influence economy, and are vital to the economic success of many communities; local languages are crucial to tourism industry, arts and local manufacturing. Language is also vital in regards to community cohesion, cultural pride and community self-confidence. Language revitalization can also lead to the revival of the local industry, and Crystal considers languages &quot;the lubricant of trade&quot;.

The need to maintain language diversity in face of globalization has also been analysed from the perspective of biodiversity, and many linguists working with endangered languages have adopted an ecological perspective. Crystal argues that since the strongest ecosystems are those which are most diverse, the humanity was able to expand so widely because it developed &quot;diverse cultures which suit all kinds of environments&quot;. Therefore language death diminishes the ability to adapt, as the pool of knowledge from which one can draw is reduced. The view that language diversity is just as important as genetic one has been endorsed by the Linguistic Society of America, with a statement from 1994 saying: &quot;The loss to humankind of genetic diversity in the linguistic world is . . . arguably greater than even the loss of genetic diversity in the biological world, given that the structure of human language represents a considerable testimony to human intellectual achievement.&quot; Peter Trudgill sustains that languages as partial barriers to communication are beneficial, as dominant cultures are unable to penetrate smaller so easily. Every language provides a unique way to describe the world, and retains information regarding the &quot;earlier states of mind of its speakers, and the kinds of cultural contact they had&quot; through preserved idioms and ways of speech. Michael E. Krauss equates language death with extinction of a species:

A study of Zayse language in Southern Ethiopia has also established a link between language preservation and biodiversity - language loss has been found to negatively impact the biodiversity conservation. Abayneh Unasho argues that &quot;linguistic diversity and biodiversity cannot be seen in isolation, and should be conserved simultaneously in order to guarantee sustainable bicultural diversity.&quot; The language and culture of native peoples promotes a respectful and conservationist attitude towards nature and biodiversity; the fire ecology of Native Americans had created a landscape that European colonists considered &quot;untouched, pristine&quot;, unaware that it was the effect of Native American environmental preservation. The land management and the traditional knowledge of the Indigenous peoples is now an important basis for current re-engagement with the landscape and is critical for the correct interpretation of the ecological basis for vegetation distribution.

Cultures and communities, especially indigenous ones, that have lost their language experience heightened negative mental health effects, such as substance abuse, trauma, and depression. A study conducted on Aboriginal youth suicide rates in Canada found that Indigenous communities in which a majority of members speak the traditional language exhibit low suicide rates. Contrary, suicide rates were six times higher in groups where less than half of its members communicate in their ancestral language. Language revitalisation has also been found to spur economic growth, increasing both consumer growth and employment; additionally, Indigenous communities in Australia and Canada whose ancestral language has been revitalised report better quality of life.

Globalization drives nations to adopt monoligual practices and pressure speakers of minority or marginalized languages to speak the majority language instead. Because globalization entails dominant cultural groups imposing their ways of social, economic and political organization on weaker cultures, Salikoko Mufwene considers it a product of colonization.

<text>In computer science and computer programming, a data type (or simply type) is a collection or grouping of data values, usually specified by a set of possible values, a set of allowed operations on these values, and/or a representation of these values as machine types. A data type specification in a program constrains the possible values that an expression, such as a variable or a function call, might take. On literal data, it tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. Most programming languages support basic data types of integer numbers (of varying sizes), floating-point numbers (which approximate real numbers), characters and Booleans.

== Concept ==

A data type may be specified for many reasons: similarity, convenience, or to focus the attention. It is frequently a matter of good organization
that aids the understanding of complex definitions. Almost all programming languages explicitly include the notion of data type, though the possible data types are often restricted by considerations of simplicity, computability, or regularity. An explicit data type declaration typically allows the compiler to choose an efficient machine representation, but the conceptual organization offered by data types should not be discounted.

Different languages may use different data types or similar types with different semantics. For example, in the Python programming language, codice_1 represents an arbitrary-precision integer which has the traditional numeric operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. However, in the Java programming language, the type codice_1 represents the set of 32-bit integers ranging in value from −2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647, with arithmetic operations that wrap on overflow. In Rust this 32-bit integer type is denoted codice_3 and panics on overflow in debug mode.

Most programming languages also allow the programmer to define additional data types, usually by combining multiple elements of other types and defining the valid operations of the new data type. For example, a programmer might create a new data type named &quot;complex number&quot; that would include real and imaginary parts, or a color data type represented by three bytes denoting the amounts each of red, green, and blue, and a string representing the color&#x27;s name.

Data types are used within type systems, which offer various ways of defining, implementing, and using them. In a type system, a data type represents a constraint placed upon the interpretation of data, describing representation, interpretation and structure of values or objects stored in computer memory. The type system uses data type information to check correctness of computer programs that access or manipulate the data. A compiler may use the static type of a value to optimize the storage it needs and the choice of algorithms for operations on the value. In many C compilers the data type, for example, is represented in 32 bits, in accord with the IEEE specification for single-precision floating point numbers. They will thus use floating-point-specific microprocessor operations on those values (floating-point addition, multiplication, etc.).

==Definition==

 identified five definitions of a &quot;type&quot; that were used—sometimes implicitly—in the literature:
; Syntactic: A type is a purely syntactic label associated with a variable when it is declared. Although useful for advanced type systems such as substructural type systems, such definitions provide no intuitive meaning of the types.
; Representation: A type is defined in terms of a composition of more primitive types—often machine types.
; Representation and behaviour: A type is defined as its representation and a set of operators manipulating these representations.
; Value space: A type is a set of possible values which a variable can possess. Such definitions make it possible to speak about (disjoint) unions or Cartesian products of types.
; Value space and behaviour: A type is a set of values which a variable can possess and a set of functions that one can apply to these values.

The definition in terms of a representation was often done in imperative languages such as ALGOL and Pascal, while the definition in terms of a value space and behaviour was used in higher-level languages such as Simula and CLU. Types including behavior align more closely with object-oriented models, whereas a structured programming model would tend to not include code, and are called plain old data structures.

==Classification==

Data types may be categorized according to several factors:

* &quot;Primitive data types&quot; or &quot;built-in data types&quot; are types that are built-in to a language implementation. &quot;User-defined data types&quot; are non-primitive types. For example, Java&#x27;s numeric types are primitive, while classes are user-defined.
* A value of an &quot;atomic type&quot; is a single data item that cannot be broken into component parts. A value of a &quot;composite type&quot; or &quot;aggregate type&quot; is a collection of data items that can be accessed individually. For example, an integer is generally considered atomic, although it consists of a sequence of bits, while an array of integers is certainly composite.
* &quot;Basic data types&quot; or &quot;fundamental data types&quot; are defined axiomatically from fundamental notions or by enumeration of their elements. &quot;Generated data types&quot; or &quot;derived data types&quot; are specified, and partly defined, in terms of other data types. All basic types are atomic. For example, integers are a basic type defined in mathematics, while an array of integers is the result of applying an array type generator to the integer type.

The terminology varies - in the literature, primitive, built-in, basic, atomic, and fundamental may be used interchangeably.

==Examples==

=== Machine data types ===

All data in computers based on digital electronics is represented as bits (alternatives 0 and 1) on the lowest level. The smallest addressable unit of data is usually a group of bits called a byte (usually an octet, which is 8 bits). The unit processed by machine code instructions is called a word (, typically 32 or 64 bits).

Machine data types &quot;expose&quot; or make available fine-grained control over hardware, but this can also expose implementation details that make code less portable. Hence machine types are mainly used in systems programming or low-level programming languages. In higher-level languages most data types are &quot;abstracted&quot; in that they do not have a language-defined machine representation. The C programming language, for instance, supplies types such as Booleans, integers, floating-point numbers, etc., but the precise bit representations of these types are implementation-defined. The only C type with a precise machine representation is the codice_4 type that represents a byte.

===Boolean type===
The Boolean type represents the values true and false. Although only two values are possible, they are more often represented as a byte or word rather as a single bit as it requires more machine instructions to store and retrieve an individual bit. Many programming languages do not have an explicit Boolean type, instead using an integer type and interpreting (for instance) 0 as false and other values as true.
Boolean data refers to the logical structure of how the language is interpreted to the machine language. In this case a Boolean 0 refers to the logic False. True is always a non zero, especially a one which is known as Boolean 1.

===Numeric types===

Almost all programming languages supply one or more integer data types. They may either supply a small number of predefined subtypes restricted to certain ranges (such as codice_5 and codice_6 and their corresponding codice_7 variants in C/C++); or allow users to freely define subranges such as 1..12 (e.g. Pascal/Ada). If a corresponding native type does not exist on the target platform, the compiler will break them down into code using types that do exist. For instance, if a 32-bit integer is requested on a 16 bit platform, the compiler will tacitly treat it as an array of two 16 bit integers.

Floating point data types represent certain fractional values (rational numbers, mathematically). Although they have predefined limits on both their maximum values and their precision, they are sometimes misleadingly called reals (evocative of mathematical real numbers). They are typically stored internally in the form (where and are integers), but displayed in familiar decimal form.

Fixed point data types are convenient for representing monetary values. They are often implemented internally as integers, leading to predefined limits.

For independence from architecture details, a Bignum or arbitrary precision codice_8 type might be supplied. This represents an integer or rational to a precision limited only by the available memory and computational resources on the system. Bignum implementations of arithmetic operations on machine-sized values are significantly slower than the corresponding machine operations.

===Enumerations===
The enumerated type has distinct values, which can be compared and assigned, but which do not necessarily have any particular concrete representation in the computer&#x27;s memory; compilers and interpreters can represent them arbitrarily. For example, the four suits in a deck of playing cards may be four enumerators named &quot;CLUB&quot;, &quot;DIAMOND&quot;, &quot;HEART&quot;, &quot;SPADE&quot;, belonging to an enumerated type named &quot;suit&quot;. If a variable &quot;V&quot; is declared having &quot;suit&quot; as its data type, one can assign any of those four values to it. Some implementations allow programmers to assign integer values to the enumeration values, or even treat them as type-equivalent to integers.

=== String and text types ===

Strings are a sequence of characters used to store words or plain text, most often textual markup languages representing formatted text. Characters may be a letter of some alphabet, a digit, a blank space, a punctuation mark, etc. Characters are drawn from a character set such as ASCII or Unicode. Character and string types can have different subtypes according to the character encoding. The original 7-bit wide ASCII was found to be limited, and superseded by 8, 16 and 32-bit sets, which can encode a wide variety of non-Latin alphabets (such as Hebrew and Chinese) and other symbols. Strings may be of either variable length or fixed length, and some programming languages have both types. They may also be subtyped by their maximum size.

Since most character sets include the digits, it is possible to have a numeric string, such as codice_9. These numeric strings are usually considered distinct from numeric values such as codice_10, although some languages automatically convert between them.

=== Union types ===
A union type definition will specify which of a number of permitted subtypes may be stored in its instances, e.g. &quot;float or long integer&quot;. In contrast with a record, which could be defined to contain a float &quot;and&quot; an integer, a union may only contain one subtype at a time.

A tagged union (also called a variant, variant record, discriminated union, or disjoint union) contains an additional field indicating its current type for enhanced type safety.

=== Algebraic data types ===
An algebraic data type (ADT) is a possibly recursive sum type of product types. A value of an ADT consists of a constructor tag together with zero or more field values, with the number and type of the field values fixed by the constructor. The set of all possible values of an ADT is the set-theoretic disjoint union (sum), of the sets of all possible values of its variants (product of fields). Values of algebraic types are analyzed with pattern matching, which identifies a value&#x27;s constructor and extracts the fields it contains.

If there is only one constructor, then the ADT corresponds to a product type similar to a tuple or record. A constructor with no fields corresponds to the empty product (unit type). If all constructors have no fields then the ADT corresponds to an enumerated type.

One common ADT is the option type, defined in Haskell as .

===Data structures ===

Some types are very useful for storing and retrieving data and are called data structures. Common data structures include:

* An array (also called vector, list, or sequence) stores a number of elements and provides random access to individual elements. The elements of an array are typically (but not in all contexts) required to be of the same type. Arrays may be fixed-length or expandable. Indices into an array are typically required to be integers (if not, one may stress this relaxation by speaking about an associative array) from a specific range (if not all indices in that range correspond to elements, it may be a sparse array).
* Record (also called tuple or struct) Records are among the simplest data structures. A record is a value that contains other values, typically in fixed number and sequence and typically indexed by names. The elements of records are usually called &quot;fields&quot; or &quot;members&quot;.
* An object contains a number of data fields, like a record, and also offers a number of subroutines for accessing or modifying them, called methods.
* the singly linked list, which can be used to implement a queue and is defined in Haskell as the ADT , and 
* the binary tree, which allows fast searching, and can be defined in Haskell as the ADT 

===Abstract data types===

An abstract data type is a data type that does not specify the concrete representation of the data. Instead, a formal &quot;specification&quot; based on the data type&#x27;s operations is used to describe it. Any &quot;implementation&quot; of a specification must fulfill the rules given. For example, a stack has push/pop operations that follow a Last-In-First-Out rule, and can be concretely implemented using either a list or an array. Abstract data types are used in formal semantics and program verification and, less strictly, in design.

===Pointers and references===

The main non-composite, derived type is the pointer, a data type whose value refers directly to (or &quot;points to&quot;) another value stored elsewhere in the computer memory using its address. It is a primitive kind of reference. (In everyday terms, a page number in a book could be considered a piece of data that refers to another one). Pointers are often stored in a format similar to an integer; however, attempting to dereference or &quot;look up&quot; a pointer whose value was never a valid memory address would cause a program to crash. To ameliorate this potential problem, a pointer type is typically considered distinct from the corresponding integer type, even if the underlying representation is the same.

===Function types===
Functional programming languages treat functions as a distinct datatype and allow values of this type to be stored in variables and passed to functions. Some multi-paradigm languages such as JavaScript also have mechanisms for treating functions as data. Most contemporary type systems go beyond JavaScript&#x27;s simple type &quot;function object&quot; and have a family of function types differentiated by argument and return types, such as the type codice_11 denoting functions taking an integer and returning a Boolean. In C, a function is not a first-class data type but function pointers can be manipulated by the program. Java and C++ originally did not have function values but have added them in C++11 and Java 8.

===Type constructors===
A type constructor builds new types from old ones, and can be thought of as an operator taking zero or more types as arguments and producing a type. Product types, function types, power types and list types can be made into type constructors.

===Quantified types ===

Universally-quantified and existentially-quantified types are based on predicate logic. Universal quantification is written as formula_1 or codice_12 and is the intersection over all types codice_13 of the body codice_14, i.e. the value is of type codice_14 for every codice_13. Existential quantification written as formula_2 or codice_17 and is the union over all types codice_13 of the body codice_14, i.e. the value is of type codice_14 for some codice_13.

In Haskell, universal quantification is commonly used, but existential types must be encoded by transforming codice_22 to codice_23 or a similar type.

===Refinement types===

A refinement type is a type endowed with a predicate which is assumed to hold for any element of the refined type. For instance, the type of natural numbers greater than 5 may be written as formula_3

===Dependent types===

A dependent type is a type whose definition depends on a value. Two common examples of dependent types are dependent functions and dependent pairs. The return type of a dependent function may depend on the value (not just type) of one of its arguments. A dependent pair may have a second value of which the type depends on the first value.

===Intersection types===

An intersection type is a type containing those values that are members of two specified types. For example, in Java the class implements both the and the interfaces. Therefore, an object of type is a member of the type . Considering types as sets of values, the intersection type formula_4 is the set-theoretic intersection of formula_5 and formula_6. It is also possible to define a dependent intersection type, denoted formula_7, where the type formula_6 may depend on the term variable formula_9.

===Meta types===
Some programming languages represent the type information as data, enabling type introspection and reflective programming (reflection). In contrast, higher order type systems, while allowing types to be constructed from other types and passed to functions as values, typically avoid basing computational decisions on them.

===Convenience types===
For convenience, high-level languages and databases may supply ready-made &quot;real world&quot; data types, for instance times, dates, and monetary values (currency). These may be built-in to the language or implemented as composite types in a library.
