<text>County Clare () is a county in the province of Munster in the Southern part of Ireland, bordered on the west by the Atlantic Ocean. Clare County Council is the local authority. The county had a population of 127,938 at the 2022 census. The county seat and largest settlement is Ennis.

==Geography and subdivisions==
Clare is north-west of the River Shannon covering a total area of . Clare is the seventh largest of Ireland&#x27;s 32 traditional counties in area and the 19th largest in terms of population. It is bordered by two counties in Munster and one county in Connacht: County Limerick to the south, County Tipperary to the east, and County Galway to the north. Clare&#x27;s nickname is &quot;the Banner County&quot;.

===Baronies, parishes and townlands===

The county is divided into the baronies of Bunratty Lower, Bunratty Upper, Burren, Clonderalaw, Corcomroe, Ibrickan, Inchiquin, Islands, Moyarta, Tulla Lower and Tulla Upper. These in turn are divided into civil parishes, which are divided into townlands. These divisions are cadastral, defining land boundaries and ownership, rather than administrative.

===Physical geography===

Bodies of water define much of the physical boundaries of Clare. To the south-east is the River Shannon, Ireland&#x27;s longest river, and to the south is the Shannon Estuary. The border to the north-east is defined by Lough Derg which is the third-largest lake in Ireland. To the west is the Atlantic Ocean, and to the north is Galway Bay. Loop Head (Irish: Ceann Léime, meaning &#x27;leap head&#x27;) is the county&#x27;s westernmost point of land.

County Clare contains The Burren, a unique karst region, which contains rare flowers and fauna. At the western edge of The Burren, facing the Atlantic Ocean, are the Cliffs of Moher. The highest point in County Clare is Moylussa, , in the Slieve Bernagh range in the east of the county.

The following islands lie off the coast of the county:
* Aughinish
* Inishmore (or Deer) Island
* Inishloe
* Mutton Island
* Scattery Island

==History==

County Clare hosts the oldest-known evidence of human activity in Ireland. The patella of a bear, which was subject to butchering close to the time of death, was found in the Alice and Gwendoline Cave, near Edenvale House, Clarecastle. The bone features a number of linear-cut marks, and has been dated to circa 10,500 BC, from the Paleolithic era. This discovery, publicized in 2017, pushed back Ireland&#x27;s occupation by 2,500 years—what was previously regarded as the oldest site of occupation was the Mesolithic site of Mount Sandel, County Londonderry. This bear bone was discovered in 1903 during an archaeological excavation but was not studied until over a century later.

There was a Neolithic civilization in the Clare area—the name of the peoples is unknown, but the Prehistoric peoples left evidence behind in the form of ancient dolmen: single-chamber megalithic tombs, usually consisting of three or more upright stones. Clare is one of the richest places in Ireland for these tombs. The most noted one is in The Burren area; it is known as &quot;Poulnabrone dolmen&quot;, which translates to &quot;hole of sorrows&quot;. The remains of the people inside the tomb have been excavated and dated to 3800 BC.

Ptolemy created a map of Ireland in his &quot;Geographia&quot; with information dating from 100 AD; it is the oldest written account of the island that includes geographical features. Within his map, Ptolemy names the Gaelic tribes inhabiting it and the areas in which they resided; in the area of Clare, he identified a tribe known as the &quot;Gangani&quot;. Historians have found the tribes on the west of Ireland the most difficult to identify with known peoples; however, historians William Camden and Charles O&#x27;Conor speculated a possible connection between the Gangani and the &quot;Concani&quot;, one of the eleven tribes in the confederacy of the Cantabri in the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula.
During the Early Middle Ages, the area was part of the Kingdom of Connacht ruled by the Uí Fiachrach Aidhne. In the Middle Ages, it was annexed to the Kingdom of Munster to be settled by the Dalcassians. It was renamed Thomond, meaning North Munster. Brian Boru became a leader from here during this period, perhaps the most noted High King of Ireland.

From 1118 onwards the Kingdom of Thomond was in place as its own petty kingdom, ruled by the O&#x27;Brien clan. After the Norman invasion of Ireland, Thomas de Clare established a short-lived Norman lordship of Thomond, extinguished at the Battle of Dysert O&#x27;Dea in 1318 during Edward Bruce&#x27;s invasion.

There are two main hypotheses for the origins of the county name &quot;Clare&quot;. One is that the name is derived from Thomas de Clare who was deeply embroiled in local politics and fighting in the 1270s and 1280s. An alternative hypothesis is that the county name &quot;Clare&quot; comes from the settlement of Clare (now Clarecastle), whose Irish name (plank bridge) refers to a crossing over the River Fergus.

===English colonization===

In 1543, during the Tudor conquest of Ireland, Murrough O&#x27;Brien, by surrender and regrant to Henry VIII, became Earl of Thomond within Henry&#x27;s Kingdom of Ireland. Henry Sidney as Lord Deputy of Ireland responded to the Desmond Rebellion by creating the presidency of Connaught in 1569 and presidency of Munster in 1570. He transferred Thomond from Munster to Connaught, which he shired, Thomond becoming County Clare.

About 1600, Clare was removed from the presidency of Connaught and made a presidency in its own right under the Earl of Thomond. When Henry O&#x27;Brien, 5th Earl of Thomond died in 1639, Lord Deputy Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford decreed Clare should return to the presidency of Munster, but the Wars of the Three Kingdoms delayed this until the Restoration of 1660.

Clare&#x27;s county nickname is the &quot;Banner County&quot;, for which various origins have been suggested: the banners captured by Clare&#x27;s Dragoons at the Battle of Ramillies; or the banner of Catholic emancipation raised by Daniel O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s victory in an 1828 by-election for County Clare that led to Parliament passing the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829.

Scattery Island, in the Mouth of the Shannon off the Clare coast, was transferred to Limerick Corporation and the county of the city of Limerick after the dissolution of the monasteries in the mid-16th century. It was assigned to County Clare after the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840. Under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, part of the judicial county of Galway (Drummaan, Inishcaltra North and Mountshannon electoral divisions) was transferred to county Clare. This area contains the village of Mountshannon on the north-western shore of Lough Derg.

==Governance and politics==
===Local government===

The local authority for the county is Clare County Council.

Fianna Fáil lost its overall majority on the council in 2004. As of the 2009 local election, Fianna Fáil is the largest party, with 13 of the 28 seats.

The county seat is at Ennis, which also serves as a major regional hub for County Clare. Among its emergency services, it contains the Ennis Hospital, the HQ of the Clare Divisional Garda, the Clare Fire Brigade and Civil Defence.

The council has two representatives on the Southern Regional Assembly, where it is part of the Mid-West strategic planning area.

===Former districts===
Prior to 2014, there were four town councils in Clare: Ennis, Kilrush, Kilkee and Shannon. All town councils in Ireland were abolished under the Local Government Reform Act 2014.

===National politics===
Since 1921, County Clare has been represented in Dáil Éireann by the constituency of Clare, which currently has four Teachtaí Dála (TDs). Since 2020, the whole of the county has been in the constituency. At various times, portions of County Clare have been in other constituencies: Clare–South Galway (1969–77), Galway West (1977–81), Limerick East (1992–2011) and Limerick City (2011–20).

The constituency was historically a Fianna Fáil stronghold. Prominent former TDs for Clare include Éamon de Valera, who became Taoiseach and President and former president Patrick Hillery.

It is part of the European Parliament constituency of South (5 seats).

==Demography==

The population of Clare was 127,419 people at the 2022 census. The main urban areas are Ennis with a population of 27,923 and Shannon with 10,256.

The demographic profile for Clare in general is fairly young: 22% are under age 14, while 12% are over 65, compared to the national average of 20% and 11%, respectively. There is a slightly higher percentage of males with 50.5%, while females number 49.5%.

English is the main language spoken in Clare. The vast majority of the population are Irish people, accounting for 86%. Most immigrants are Europeans, totalling an additional 7,520; there is also a small African minority of 1,124 people, while other ethnic groups are very small in number.

In addition, Clare had a large diaspora due to vast emigration during the 19th century. There are millions of people around the world who can trace their family background to Clare; such descendants are found mostly in North America, Great Britain, Australia, South Africa, Argentina and New Zealand. Many people from the Irish diaspora visit the Clare area to trace their family roots and background.

Most of the names in Clare are derived from sept members of the Dalcassian race of Gaels or septs of Thomond. Some of the most common examples are O&#x27;Brien, O&#x27;Gorman, O&#x27;Dea, McMahon, McInerney, McNamara, McGarry, Moloney, O&#x27;Grady, Hogan, Considine, Griffey/Griffin and Lynch. Names of assimilated Norman origin include Burke, Dalton, and Comyn.

==Religion==

The great majority of the population follow Christianity; at least 92% of the people in the area polled as part of the Ireland Census 2006 identified as Christians. There are numerous abbeys and priories in Clare. Some of the ruins of such structures, such as Scattery Island, Bishop&#x27;s Island, and Drumcliff monasteries, are ancient, dating to the sixth century when Christianity was first introduced to Ireland. The former was founded by Saint Senan, who was born locally near Kilrush in 488 and is counted amongst the Twelve Apostles of Ireland.

Numerous other saints came from Clare, such as Flannan, Mochulleus, Moula, Caimin, Maccreiche, Munchin and more. In the present day, the Catholic Church still commands a large majority, with 88% of the populace declaring themselves as followers of the religion. This percentage is slightly higher than the national average.
Most of Clare falls under the Catholic Diocese of Killaloe, which is part of the ecclesiastical province of Cashel and Emly. The Bishop of Killaloe is seated at the St Peter and Paul Cathedral in Ennis. A small portion of the north-western part of Clare falls under the Diocese of Galway, Kilmacduagh and Kilfenora.

As part of the local council&#x27;s architectural conservation project, around eighty Christian churches have been designated as protected structures. Among the more notable structures are the ruins of Corcomroe Abbey, Quin Abbey and Dysert O&#x27;Dea Monastery.

The largest religious minority is the Church of Ireland, which is part of the Anglican Communion. It has just under 2,000 adherents in Clare. The county is part of the Diocese of Limerick and Killaloe, one of the three cathedrals of the diocese being St Flannan&#x27;s Cathedral in Killaloe. Other religious communities in Clare are very small in comparison. In 2016, about 11% of the population reported no religion. Up from 5% in 2011

==Gaeltacht==
West Clare and some pockets in East Clare were recognised as part of the Gaeltacht, or Irish-speaking area, by the Irish Free State government in the original &quot;Coimisiún na Gaeltachta&quot; in 1926. The most prominent of these areas with native Irish language speakers were west of Ennis in Kilmihil, Kilrush, Doonbeg, Doolin, Ennistimon, Carrigaholt, Lisdoonvarna and Ballyvaughan. 

The last remaining native speaker in Stonehall, next to Shannon, was alive in the 1930s; in the 1870s, the region had been entirely Irish speaking.

By the time of the second &quot;Coimisiún na Gaeltachta&quot; in 1956, the decline in the number of Gaelic speakers had been such that West Clare was removed from the list. It remained covered by the Gaeltacht (Housing) Acts until 2001.

Close geographic proximity to the Aran Islands (which were once part of Thomond) and local trade with fishermen from there meant that the language was used by residents of Fanore, Murroogh, Doolin and Quilty more than in other places. The last native Clare Irish speaker, the &quot;seanchaí&quot; Paddy Pháraic Mhíchíl Ó Sionáin (Shannon) of Fisherstreet, Doolin, died in the early 1990s.

In the early 21st century, the pressure group &quot;Coiste Forbartha Gaeltachta Chontae an Chláir&quot; sought to restore the official status of West Clare as a Gaeltacht area. They are encouraging immersion classes to revive use of the language.

==Music==

County Clare has a strong history of Traditional music. It is the home of the Kilfenora Céilí Band, the Tulla Céilí Band, Stockton&#x27;s Wing, Elizabeth Crotty, Sharon Shannon, Noel Hill, Peadar O&#x27;Loughlin, Martin Hayes and legendary tin-whistler Micho Russell. Ennis in County Clare is also the birthplace of Grammy-nominated singer Maura O&#x27;Connell whose grandmother started a fish market in the town. The county has many traditional music festivals and one of the most well known is the Willie Clancy Summer School, which is held every July in the town of Milltown Malbay in memory of the renowned uilleann piper, Willie Clancy.

Andy Irvine has written two songs celebrating County Clare: one is &quot;West Coast of Clare&quot; (recorded with Planxty in 1973), in which he mentions Spanish Point and Milltown Malbay. The other is &quot;My Heart&#x27;s Tonight in Ireland&quot; (recorded on his solo album &quot;Rain on the Roof&quot; in 1996, and again on &quot;Changing Trains&quot; in 2005), in which he mentions several towns and villages in County Clare: Milltown Malbay, Scariff, Kilrush, Sixmilebridge, Kilkishen, Lahinch, Ennistymon, Liscannor and Kilkee, and also makes two references to the music of Willie Clancy:
&lt;poem&gt;In the town of Scarriff the sun was shining in the sky
When Willie Clancy played his pipes and the tears welled in my eyes
Many years have passed and gone since the time we had there
But my heart&#x27;s tonight in Ireland in the sweet County Clare.
Lahinch and Ennistymon, Liscannor and Kilkee
But best of all was Milltown when the music flowed so free
Willie Clancy and the County Clare I&#x27;m ever in your debt
For the sights and sounds of yesterday are shining memories yet.&lt;/poem&gt;

Milltown Malbay is home to Oidhreacht an Chlair, an institute for higher education in all aspects of Irish tradition, history and literature.

==Sport==
The Clare hurling team has one of the best records of success in the country in recent years with many cups such as the Liam MacCarthy Cup having been won in 1914, 1995, 1997, 2013, and 2024, and also finalists in 2002. Clare won the Munster Final in football in 1992 beating Kerry. There is a strong Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) presence in County Clare with the founder of the GAA, Michael Cusack, having been born in Carron which is situated in the heart of The Burren in North Clare. Irish rugby internationals from Clare include Keith Wood, Anthony Foley &amp; Marcus Horan.

==Transport==

Clare is served by two national primary roads—a classification referring to the major routes between major urban centres in Ireland. This includes the N18 connecting Limerick to Galway, which passes through Ennis and by route of the N19—Shannon. These two roads are part of the wider Western and Southern Corridor connecting many of the major settlements right across the island in these areas. There are also some significant national secondary roads—across the coast, stretching from Ballyvaughan, through Ennistymon and Kilkee, before arriving at Kilrush is the N67. In addition to this the N68 connects Kilrush to Ennis, while Ennis is connected to Ennistymon via the N85.

Mainland public transport is mostly limited to buses ran by Irish Government owned company Bus Éireann; there are around 25 buses running frequent routes which pass through the majority of large settlements in Clare. Clare Bus, runs a limited number of &quot;accessible buslines&quot;. The Ennis railway station operated by government-owned Iarnród Éireann is the most significant railway station in Clare today; it was opened on 2 July 1859. By route of Limerick the trains run from Ennis to Dublin and it generally takes 3 hours to complete the journey. There was previously a far more extensive local railway network in Clare, laid while part of the United Kingdom, the West Clare Railway was in existence from its opening in 1887 by Charles Stewart Parnell until 1961 covering much of the county. It was quite inefficient, however, leading Percy French to write the song &quot;Are Ye Right There Michael?&quot; about his experience. Much of it was dug up and dismantled by the Irish government from the 1950s to the 1970s after being deemed uneconomic; however, there remains local advocacy groups who wish to conserve and restore parts of it.

The third-busiest airport in Ireland is located in Clare with the Shannon Airport, which officially opened in 1945. Along with Dublin Airport and Cork Airport it is one of the three primary airports in the country, handling 3.62 million passengers in 2007. Shannon was the first airport in Ireland to receive transatlantic flights. Ryanair is the main airline handling flights with Great Britain and Continental European countries such as Spain, France and Germany as the primary destinations. Much traffic from the United States is received, which Aer Lingus mostly handles; it is sometimes used as a military stopover which has caused some controversy in the country, but nonetheless has generated significant revenue for the airport. There are some local ferry services as much of the county is surrounded by water; there is one from Killimer to Tarbert Island in Kerry and also from Doolin to the Aran Islands of Inisheer and Inishmore.

<text>In chemistry, iron(III) or ferric refers to the element iron in its +3 oxidation state. &quot;Ferric chloride&quot; is an alternative name for iron(III) chloride (). The adjective &quot;ferrous&quot; is used instead for iron(II) salts, containing the cation Fe2+. The word &quot;&quot; is derived from the Latin word , meaning &quot;iron&quot;. 

Although often abbreviated as Fe3+, that naked ion does not exist except under extreme conditions. Iron(III) centres are found in many compounds and coordination complexes, where Fe(III) is bonded to several ligands. A molecular ferric complex is the anion ferrioxalate, , with three bidentate oxalate ions surrounding the Fe core. Relative to lower oxidation states, ferric is less common in organoiron chemistry, but the ferrocenium cation is well known.

==Iron(III) in biology==
All known forms of life require iron, which usually exists in Fe(II) or Fe(III) oxidation states. Many proteins in living beings contain iron(III) centers. Examples of such metalloproteins include oxyhemoglobin, ferredoxin, and the cytochromes. Many organisms, from bacteria to humans, store iron as microscopic crystals (3 to 8 nm in diameter) of iron(III) oxide hydroxide, inside a shell of the protein ferritin, from which it can be recovered as needed. 

Insufficient iron in the human diet causes anemia. Animals and humans can obtain the necessary iron from foods that contain it in assimilable form, such as meat. Other organisms must obtain their iron from the environment. However, iron tends to form highly insoluble iron(III) oxides/hydroxides in aerobic (oxygenated) environment, especially in calcareous soils. Bacteria and grasses can thrive in such environments by secreting compounds called siderophores that form soluble complexes with iron(III), that can be reabsorbed into the cell. (The other plants instead encourage the growth around their roots of certain bacteria that reduce iron(III) to the more soluble iron(II).) 

The insolubility of iron(III) compounds is also responsible for the low levels of iron in seawater, which is often the limiting factor for the growth of the microscopic plants (phytoplankton) that are the basis of the marine food web.

==Iron(III) salts and complexes==
Typically iron(III) salts, like the &quot;chloride&quot; are aquo complexes with the formulas . Iron(III) nitrate and iron(III) perchlorate are thought to initially dissolve in water to give ions. In these complexes, the protons are acidic. Eventually these complexes hydrolyze producing iron(III) hydroxides that continue to react, in part via the process called olation. These hydroxides precipitate out of the solution or form colloids. These reactions liberate hydrogen ions lowering the pH of its solutions. The equilibria are elaborate: 
: 

The aquo ligands on iron(III) complexes are labile. This behavior is visualized by the color change brought about by reaction with thiocyanate to give a deep red thiocyanate complex.

===Iron(III) with organic ligands===
In the presence chelating ligands, the complex hydrolysis reactions are avoided. One of these ligands is EDTA, which is often used to dissolve iron deposits or added to fertilizers to make iron in the soil available (soluble) to plants. Citrate also solubilizes ferric ion at neutral pH, although its complexes are less stable than those of EDTA. Many chelating ligands - the siderophores - are produced naturally to dissolve iron(III) oxides.

Iron(III) complexes with [2,2&#x27;-Bipyridine|1,10-phenanthrolinebipyridine]] is soluble and can sustain reduction to it iron(II) derivative:
==Iron(III) minerals and other solids==
Iron(III) is found in many minerals and solids, e.g., oxide (hematite) and iron(III) oxide-hydroxide are extremely insoluble reflecting their polymeric structure. Rust is a mixture of iron(III) oxide and oxide-hydroxide that usually forms when iron metal is exposed to humid air. Unlike the passivating oxide layers that are formed by other metals, like chromium and aluminum, rust flakes off, because it is bulkier than the metal that formed it. Therefore, unprotected iron objects will in time be completely turned into rust.

==Bonding==

Iron(III) is a d5 center, meaning that the metal has five &quot;valence&quot; electrons in the 3d orbital shell. The number and type of ligands bound to iron(III) determine how these electrons arrange themselves. With so-called &quot;strong field ligands&quot; such as cyanide, the five electrons pair up as best they can. Thus ferricyanide ( has only one unpaired electron. It is low-spin. With so-called &quot;weak field ligands&quot; such as water, the five electrons are unpaired. Thus aquo complex ( has only five unpaired electrons. It is high-spin. With chloride, iron(III) forms tetrahedral complexes, e.g. (. Tetrahedral complexes are high spin. The magnetism of ferric complexes can show when they are high or low spin.

<text>In chemistry, iron(II) refers to the element iron in its +2 oxidation state. The adjective ferrous or the prefix ferro- is often used to specify such compounds, as in &quot;ferrous chloride&quot; for iron(II) chloride (). The adjective &quot;ferric&quot; is used instead for iron(III) salts, containing the cation Fe3+. The word &quot;&quot; is derived from the Latin word , meaning &quot;iron&quot;.

In ionic compounds (salts), such an atom may occur as a separate cation (positive ion) abbreviated as Fe2+, although more precise descriptions include other ligands such as water and halides. Iron(II) centres occur in coordination complexes, such as in the anion ferrocyanide, , where six cyanide ligands are bound the metal centre; or, in organometallic compounds, such as the ferrocene , where two cyclopentadienyl anions are bound to the FeII centre.

==Ferrous ions in biology==

All known forms of life require iron. Many proteins in living beings contain iron(II) centers. Examples of such metalloproteins include hemoglobin, ferredoxin, and the cytochromes. In many of these proteins, Fe(II) converts reversibly to Fe(III).

Insufficient iron in the human diet causes anemia. Animals and humans can obtain the necessary iron from foods that contain it in assimilable form, such as meat. Other organisms must obtain their iron from the environment. However, iron tends to form highly insoluble iron(III) oxides/hydroxides in aerobic (oxygenated) environment, especially in calcareous soils. Bacteria and grasses can thrive in such environments by secreting compounds called siderophores that form soluble complexes with iron(III), that can be reabsorbed into the cell. (The other plants instead encourage the growth around their roots of certain bacteria that reduce iron(III) to the more soluble iron(II).)In contrast to iron(III) aquo complexes, iron(II) aquo complexes are soluble in water near neutral pH. Ferrous iron is, however, oxidized by the oxygen in air, converting to iron(III).

==Ferrous salts and complexes==
Typically iron(II) salts, like the &quot;chloride&quot; are aquo complexes with the formulas , as found in Mohr&#x27;s salt. 

The aquo ligands on iron(II) complexes are labile. It reacts with 1,10-phenanthroline to give the blue iron(II) derivative:

When metallic iron (oxidation state 0) is placed in a solution of hydrochloric acid, iron(II) chloride is formed, with release of hydrogen gas, by the reaction

Iron(II) is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to iron(III), forming a hydroxyl radical and a hydroxide ion in the process. This is the Fenton reaction. Iron(III) is then reduced back to iron(II) by another molecule of hydrogen peroxide, forming a hydroperoxyl radical and a proton. The net effect is a disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide to create two different oxygen-radical species, with water (H+ + OH−) as a byproduct. 


The free radicals generated by this process engage in secondary reactions, which can degrade many organic and biochemical compounds.

==Ferrous minerals and other solids==
Iron(II) is found in many minerals and solids. Examples include the sulfide and oxide, FeS and FeO. These formulas are deceptively simple because these sulfides and oxides are often nonstoichiometric. For example, &quot;ferrous sulfide&quot; can refer to the 1:1 species (mineral name troilite) or a host of Fe-deficient derivatives (pyrrhotite). The mineral magnetite (&quot;lode stone&quot;) is a mixed-valence compound with both Fe(II) and Fe(III), Fe3O4.

==Bonding==
Iron(II) is a d6 center, meaning that the metal has six &quot;valence&quot; electrons in the 3d orbital shell. The number and type of ligands bound to iron(II) determine how these electrons arrange themselves. With the so-called &quot;strong field ligands&quot; such as cyanide, the six electrons pair up. Thus ferrocyanide ( has no unpaired electrons, meaning it is a low-spin complex. With so-called &quot;weak field ligands&quot; such as water, four of the six electrons are unpaired, meaning it is a high-spin complex. Thus aquo complex is paramagnetic. With chloride, iron(II) forms tetrahedral complexes, e.g. . Tetrahedral complexes are high-spin complexes.

<text>A hemeprotein (or haemprotein; also hemoprotein or haemoprotein), or heme protein, is a protein that contains a heme prosthetic group. They are a very large class of metalloproteins. The heme group confers functionality, which can include oxygen carrying, oxygen reduction, electron transfer, and other processes. Heme is bound to the protein either covalently or noncovalently or both.

The heme consists of iron cation bound at the center of the conjugate base of the porphyrin, as well as other ligands attached to the &quot;axial sites&quot; of the iron. The porphyrin ring is a planar dianionic, tetradentate ligand. The iron is typically Fe2+ or Fe3+. One or two ligands are attached at the axial sites. The porphyrin ring has 4 nitrogen atoms that bind to the iron, leaving two other coordination positions of the iron available for bonding to the histidine of the protein and a divalent atom.

Hemeproteins probably evolved to incorporate the iron atom contained within the protoporphyrin IX ring of heme into proteins. As it makes hemeproteins responsive to molecules that can bind divalent iron, this strategy has been maintained throughout evolution as it plays crucial physiological functions. The serum iron pool maintains iron in soluble form, making it more accessible for cells. Oxygen (O2), nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) bind to the iron atom in heme proteins. Once bound to the prosthetic heme groups, these molecules can modulate the activity/function of those hemeproteins, affording signal transduction. Therefore, when produced in biologic systems (cells), these gaseous molecules are referred to as gasotransmitters.
Because of their diverse biological functions and widespread abundance, hemeproteins are among the most studied biomolecules. Data on heme protein structure and function has been aggregated into The Heme Protein Database (HPD), a secondary database to the Protein Data Bank.

==Roles==
Hemeproteins have diverse biological functions including oxygen transport, which is completed via hemeproteins including hemoglobin, hemocyanin, myoglobin, neuroglobin, cytoglobin, and leghemoglobin.

Some hemeproteins—cytochrome P450s, cytochrome c oxidase, ligninases, catalase, and peroxidases—are enzymes. They often activate O2 for oxidation or hydroxylation.

Hemeproteins also enable electron transfer as they form part of the electron transport chain. Cytochrome a, cytochrome b, and cytochrome c have such electron transfer functions. It is now known that cytochrome a and cytochrome a3 make up one protein and was deemed the name cytochrome aa3. The sensory system also relies on some hemeproteins including FixL, an oxygen sensor, CooA, a carbon monoxide sensor, and soluble guanylyl cyclase.

==Hemoglobin and myoglobin==
Hemoglobin and myoglobin are examples of hemeproteins that respectively transport and store of oxygen in mammals and in some fish. Hemoglobin is a quaternary protein that occurs in the red blood cell, whereas, myoglobin is a tertiary protein found in the muscle cells of mammals. Although they might differ in location and size, their function are similar. Being hemeproteins, they both contain a heme prosthetic group.

His-F8 of the myoglobin, also known as the proximal histidine, is covalently bonded to the 5th coordination position of the iron. Oxygen interacts with the distal His by way of a hydrogen bond, not a covalent one. It binds to the 6th coordination position of the iron, His-E7 of the myoglobin binds to the oxygen that is now covalently bonded to the iron. The same is true for hemoglobin; however, being a protein with four subunits, hemoglobin contains four heme units in total, allowing four oxygen molecules in total to bind to the protein.

Myoglobin and hemoglobin are globular proteins that serve to bind and deliver oxygen using a prosthetic group. These globins dramatically improve the concentration of molecular oxygen that can be carried in the biological fluids of vertebrates and some invertebrates.

Differences occur in ligand binding and allosteric regulation.

===Myoglobin===

Myoglobin is found in vertebrate muscle cells and is a water-soluble globular protein. Muscle cells, when put into action, can quickly require a large amount of oxygen for respiration due to their energy requirements. Therefore, muscle cells use myoglobin to accelerate oxygen diffusion and act as localized oxygen reserves for times of intense respiration. Myoglobin also stores the required amount of oxygen and makes it available for the muscle cell mitochondria.

===Hemoglobin===

In vertebrates, hemoglobin is found in the cytosol of red blood cells. Hemoglobin is sometimes referred to as the oxygen transport protein, in order to contrast it with myoglobin, which is stationary.

In vertebrates, oxygen is taken into the body by the tissues of the lungs, and passed to the red blood cells in the bloodstream where it&#x27;s used in aerobic metabolic pathways. Oxygen is then distributed to all of the tissues in the body and offloaded from the red blood cells to respiring cells. The hemoglobin then picks up carbon dioxide to be returned to the lungs. Thus, hemoglobin binds and off-loads both oxygen and carbon dioxide at the appropriate tissues, serving to deliver the oxygen needed for cellular metabolism and removing the resulting waste product, CO2.

=== Neuroglobin ===
Found in neurons, neuroglobin is responsible for driving nitric oxide to promote neuron cell survival Neuroglobin is believed to increase the oxygen supply for neurons, sustaining ATP production, but they also function as storage proteins.

=== Peroxidases and catalases ===
Almost all human peroxidases are hemoproteins, except glutathione peroxidase. They use hydrogen peroxide as a substrate. Metalloenzymes catalyze reactions using peroxide as an oxidant.
Catalases are hemoproteins responsible for the catalysis of converting hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. They are made up of 4 subunits, each subunit having a Fe3+ heme group. They have an average molecular weight of ~240,000 g/mol.

Haloperoxidases involved in the innate immune system also contain a heme prosthetic group.

=== Electron transport chain and other redox catalysts ===
Cytochromes, cytochrome c oxidase, and coenzyme Q – cytochrome c reductase are heme-containing proteins or protein subunits embedded in the inner membrane of mitochondria which play an essential role in cellular respiration.

Sulfite oxidase, a molybdenum-dependent cytochrome, oxidizes sulfite to sulfate.

=== Nitric oxide synthase ===
==Designed heme proteins==

Due to the diverse functions of the heme molecule: as an electron transporter, an oxygen carrier, and as an enzyme cofactor, heme binding proteins have consistently attracted the attention of protein designers. Initial design attempts focused on α-helical heme binding proteins, in part, due to the relative simplicity of designing self-assembling helical bundles. Heme binding sites were designed inside the inter-helical hydrophobic grooves. Examples of such designs include:
* Helichrome
* Globin-1
* Cy-AA-EK
* Peptides IIa/IId
* α2
* Transmembrane helical designs

Later design attempts focused on creating functional heme binding helical bundles, such as:
* Oxidoreductases
* Peroxidases
* Electron transport proteins
* Oxygen transport proteins
* Photosensitive proteins

Design techniques have matured to such an extent that it is now possible to generate entire libraries of heme binding helical proteins.

Recent design attempts have focused on creating all-beta heme binding proteins, whose novel topology is very rare in nature. Such designs include:
* Pincer-1
* β-hairpin peptides
* β-sheet miniproteins
* Multi-stranded β-sheet peptides
Some methodologies attempt to incorporate cofactors into the hemoproteins who typically endure harsh conditions. In order to incorporate a synthetic cofactor, what must first occur is the denaturing of the holoprotein to remove the heme. The apoprotein is then rebuilt with the cofactor.

<text>An intelligent transportation system (ITS) is an advanced application that aims to provide services relating to different modes of transport and traffic management and enable users to be better informed and make safer, more coordinated, and &#x27;smarter&#x27; use of transport networks.

Some of these technologies include calling for emergency services when an accident occurs, using cameras to enforce traffic laws or signs that mark speed limit changes depending on conditions.

Although ITS may refer to all modes of transport, the directive of the European Union 2010/40/EU, made on July 7, 2010, defined ITS as systems in which information and communication technologies are applied in the field of road transport, including infrastructure, vehicles and users, and in traffic management and mobility management, as well as for interfaces with other modes of transport. ITS may be used to improve the efficiency and safety of transport in many situations, i.e. road transport, traffic management, mobility, etc. ITS technology is being adopted across the world to increase the capacity of busy roads, reduce journey times and enable the collection of information on unsuspecting road users.

==Background==
Governmental activity in the area of ITS is further motivated by an increasing focus on homeland security. Many of the proposed ITS systems also involve surveillance of the roadways, which is a priority of homeland security. Funding of many systems comes either directly through homeland security organisations or with their approval. Further, ITS can play a role in the rapid mass evacuation of people in urban centres after large casualty events such as a result of a natural disaster or threat. Much of the infrastructure and planning involved with ITS parallels the need for homeland security systems.

In the developing world, the migration from rural to urbanized habitats has progressed differently. Many areas of the developing world have urbanised without significant motorisation and the formation of suburbs. A small portion of the population can afford automobiles, but the automobiles greatly increase congestion in these multimodal transportation systems. They also produce considerable air pollution, pose a significant safety risk, and exacerbate feelings of inequities in the society. High population density could be supported by a multimodal system of walking, bicycle transportation, motorcycles, buses, and trains.

Other parts of the developing world, such as China, India and Brazil remain largely rural but are rapidly urbanising and industrialising. In these areas a motorised infrastructure is being developed alongside motorisation of the population. Great disparity of wealth means that only a fraction of the population can motorise, and therefore the highly dense multimodal transportation system for the poor is cross-cut by the highly motorised transportation system for the rich.

==Intelligent transportation technologies==
Intelligent transport systems vary in technologies applied, from basic management systems such as car navigation; traffic signal control systems; container management systems; variable message signs; automatic number plate recognition or speed cameras to monitor applications, such as security CCTV systems, and automatic incident detection or stopped vehicle detection systems; to more advanced applications that integrate live data and feedback from a number of other sources, such as parking guidance and information systems; weather information; bridge de-icing (US deicing) systems; and the like. Additionally, predictive techniques are being developed to allow advanced modelling and comparison with historical baseline data. Some of these technologies are described in the following sections.

==Wireless communications==

Various forms of wireless communications technologies have been proposed for intelligent transportation systems.
Radio modem communication on UHF and VHF frequencies are widely used for short and long-range communication within ITS.

Short-range communications of 350 m can be accomplished using IEEE 802.11 protocols, specifically 802.11p (WAVE) or the dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) 802.11bd standard being promoted by the Intelligent Transportation Society of America and the United States Department of Transportation. Theoretically, the range of these protocols can be extended using mobile ad hoc networks or mesh networking.

Longer-range communications use infrastructure networks. Long-range communications using these methods are well established, but, unlike the short-range protocols, these methods require extensive and very expensive infrastructure deployment.

===Computational technologies===
Recent advances in vehicle electronics have led to a move towards fewer, more capable computer processors on a vehicle. A typical vehicle in the early 2000s would have between 20 and 100 individual networked microcontroller/programmable logic controller modules with non-real-time operating systems. The current trend is toward fewer, more costly microprocessor modules with hardware memory management and real-time operating systems. The new embedded system platforms allow for more sophisticated software applications to be implemented, including model-based process control, artificial intelligence, and ubiquitous computing. Perhaps the most important of these for intelligent transportation systems is artificial intelligence.

===Floating car data/floating cellular data===

&quot;Floating car&quot; or &quot;probe&quot; data collected other transport routes. Broadly speaking, four methods have been used to obtain the raw data: 
* Triangulation method. In developed countries a high proportion of cars contain one or more mobile phones. The phones periodically transmit their presence information to the mobile phone network, even when no voice connection is established. In the mid-2000s, attempts were made to use mobile phones as anonymous traffic probes. As a car moves, so does the signal of any mobile phones that are inside the vehicle. By measuring and analysing network data using triangulation, pattern matching or cell-sector statistics (in an anonymous format), the data was converted into traffic flow information. With more congestion, there are more cars, more phones, and thus, more probes.
In metropolitan areas, the distance between antennas is shorter and in theory accuracy increases. An advantage of this method is that no infrastructure needs to be built along the road; only the mobile phone network is leveraged. But in practice the triangulation method can be complicated, especially in areas where the same mobile phone towers serve two or more parallel routes (such as a motorway (freeway) with a frontage road, a motorway (freeway) and a commuter rail line, two or more parallel streets, or a street that is also a bus line). By the early 2010s, the popularity of the triangulation method was declining.
* Vehicle re-identification. Vehicle re-identification methods require sets of detectors mounted along the road. In this technique, a unique serial number for a device in the vehicle is detected at one location and then detected again (re-identified) further down the road. Travel times and speed are calculated by comparing the time at which a specific device is detected by pairs of sensors. This can be done using the MAC addresses from Bluetooth or other devices, or using the RFID serial numbers from electronic toll collection (ETC) transponders (also called &quot;toll tags&quot;).
* GPS based methods. An increasing number of vehicles are equipped with in-vehicle satnav/GPS (satellite navigation) systems that have two-way communication with a traffic data provider. Position readings from these vehicles are used to compute vehicle speeds. Modern methods may not use dedicated hardware but instead Smartphone based solutions using so called Telematics 2.0 approaches.
* Smartphone-based rich monitoring. Smartphones having various sensors can be used to track traffic speed and density. The accelerometer data from smartphones used by car drivers is monitored to find out traffic speed and road quality. Audio data and GPS tagging of smartphones enables identification of traffic density and possible traffic jams. This was implemented in Bangalore, India as a part of a research experimental system Nericell.

Floating car data technology provides advantages over other methods of traffic measurement: 
* Less expensive than sensors or cameras
* More coverage (potentially including all locations and streets)
* Faster to set up and less maintenance
* Works in all weather conditions, including heavy rain

===Sensing ===

Technological advances in telecommunications and information technology, coupled with ultramodern/state-of-the-art microchip, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), and inexpensive intelligent beacon sensing technologies, have enhanced the technical capabilities that will facilitate motorist safety benefits for intelligent transportation systems globally. Sensing systems for ITS are vehicle- and infrastructure-based networked systems, i.e., intelligent vehicle technologies. Infrastructure sensors are indestructible (such as in-road reflectors) devices that are installed or embedded in the road or surrounding the road (e.g., on buildings, posts, and signs), as required, and may be manually disseminated during preventive road construction maintenance or by sensor injection machinery for rapid deployment. Vehicle-sensing systems include deployment of infrastructure-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure electronic beacons for identification communications and may also employ video automatic number plate recognition or vehicle magnetic signature detection technologies at desired intervals to increase sustained monitoring of vehicles operating in critical zones of world.

====Inductive loop detection====
Inductive loops can be placed in a roadbed to detect vehicles as they pass through the loop&#x27;s magnetic field. The simplest detectors simply count the number of vehicles during a unit of time (typically 60 seconds in the United States) that pass over the loop, while more sophisticated sensors estimate the speed, length, and class of vehicles and the distance between them. Loops can be placed in a single lane or across multiple lanes, and they work with very slow or stopped vehicles as well as vehicles moving at high speed.

====Video vehicle detection====
Traffic-flow measurement and automatic incident detection using video cameras is another form of vehicle detection. Since video detection systems such as those used in automatic number plate recognition do not involve installing any components directly into the road surface or roadbed, this type of system is known as a &quot;non-intrusive&quot; method of traffic detection. Video from cameras is fed into processors that analyse the changing characteristics of the video image as vehicles pass. The cameras are typically mounted on poles or structures above or adjacent to the roadway. Most video detection systems require some initial configuration to &quot;teach&quot; the processor the baseline background image. This usually involves inputting known measurements such as the distance between lane lines or the height of the camera above the roadway. A single video detection processor can detect traffic simultaneously from one to eight cameras, depending on the brand and model. The typical output from a video detection system is lane-by-lane vehicle speeds, counts, and lane occupancy readings. Some systems provide additional outputs including gap, headway, stopped-vehicle detection, and wrong-way vehicle alarms.

====Bluetooth detection====
Bluetooth is an accurate and inexpensive way to transmit position from a vehicle in motion. Bluetooth devices in passing vehicles are detected by sensing devices along the road. If these sensors are interconnected they are able to calculate travel time and provide data for origin and destination matrices.
Compared to other traffic measurement technologies, Bluetooth measurement has some differences:
* Accurate measurement points with absolute confirmation to provide to the second travel times.
* Is non-intrusive, which can lead to lower-cost installations for both permanent and temporary sites.
* Is limited to how many Bluetooth devices are broadcasting in a vehicle so counting and other applications are limited. 
* Systems are generally quick to set up with little to no calibration needed.

Since Bluetooth devices become more prevalent on board vehicles and with more portable electronics broadcasting, the amount of data collected over time becomes more accurate and valuable for travel time and estimation purposes, more information can be found in.

It is also possible to measure traffic density on a road using the audio signal that consists of the cumulative sound from tyre noise, engine noise, engine-idling noise, honks and air turbulence noise. A roadside-installed microphone picks up the audio that comprises the various vehicle noise and audio signal processing techniques can be used to estimate the traffic state. The accuracy of such a system compares well with the other methods described above.

====Radar detection====
Radars are mounted on the side of the road to measure traffic flow and for stopped and stranded vehicle detection purposes. Like video systems, radar learns its environment during set up so can distinguish between vehicles and other objects. It can also operate in conditions of low visibility.
Traffic flow radar uses a &quot;side-fire&quot; technique to look across all traffic lanes in a narrow band to count the number of passing vehicles and estimate traffic density.
For stopped vehicle detection (SVD) and automatic incident detection, 360-degree radar systems are used as they scan all lanes along large stretches of road. Radar is reported to have better performance over longer ranges than other technologies. SVD radar will be installed on all Smart motorways in the UK.

====Information fusion from multiple traffic sensing modalities====
The data from the different sensing technologies can be combined in intelligent ways to determine the traffic state accurately. A data fusion based approach that utilizes the roadside collected acoustic, image and sensor data has been shown to combine the advantages of the different individual methods.

==Intelligent transportation applications==
===Emergency vehicle notification systems===
In 2015, the EU passed a law required automobile manufacturers to equip all new cars with eCall, a European initiative that assists motorists in the case of a collision. The in-vehicle eCall is generated either manually by the vehicle occupants or automatically via activation of in-vehicle sensors after an accident. When activated, the in-vehicle eCall device will establish an emergency call carrying both voice and data directly to the nearest emergency point (normally the nearest E1-1-2 public safety answering point, PSAP). The voice call enables the vehicle occupant to communicate with the trained eCall operator. At the same time, a minimum set of data will be sent to the eCall operator receiving the voice call.

The minimum set of data contains information about the incident, including time, precise location, the direction the vehicle was travelling, and vehicle identification. The pan-European eCall aims to be operative for all new type-approved vehicles as a standard option. Depending on the manufacturer of the eCall system, it could be mobile phone-based (Bluetooth connection to an in-vehicle interface), an integrated eCall device, or a functionality of a broader system like navigation, Telematics device, or tolling device. eCall is expected to be offered, at earliest, by the end of 2010, pending standardization by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute and commitment from large EU member states such as France and the United Kingdom.

The EC-funded project SafeTRIP is developing an open ITS system that will improve road safety and provide a resilient communication through the use of S-band satellite communication. Such a platform will allow for greater coverage of the Emergency Call Service within the EU.

===Automatic road enforcement===

A traffic enforcement camera system, consisting of a camera and a vehicle-monitoring device, is used to detect and identify vehicles disobeying a speed limit or some other road legal requirement and automatically ticket offenders based on the license plate number. Traffic tickets are sent by mail. Applications include:

* Speed cameras that identify vehicles travelling over the legal speed limit. Many such devices use radar to detect a vehicle&#x27;s speed or electromagnetic loops buried in each lane of the road.
* Red light cameras that detect vehicles that cross a stop line or designated stopping place while a red traffic light is showing.
* Bus lane cameras that identify vehicles traveling in lanes reserved for buses. In some jurisdictions, bus lanes can also be used by taxis or vehicles engaged in carpooling.
* Level crossing cameras that identify vehicles crossing railways at grade illegally.
* Double white line cameras that identify vehicles crossing these lines.
* High-occupancy vehicle lane cameras that identify vehicles violating HOV requirements.

===Variable speed limits===

Recently some jurisdictions have begun experimenting with variable speed limits that change with road congestion and other factors. Typically such speed limits only change to decline during poor conditions, rather than being improved in good ones. One example is on Britain&#x27;s M25 motorway, which circumnavigates London. On the most heavily travelled section (junction 10 to 16) of the M25 variable speed limits combined with automated enforcement have been in force since 1995. Initial results indicated savings in journey times, smoother-flowing traffic, and a fall in the number of accidents, so the implementation was made permanent in 1997. Further trials on the M25 have been thus far proven inconclusive.

===Collision avoidance systems===
Japan has installed sensors on its highways to notify motorists that a car is stalled ahead.

==Cooperative systems on the road==
Communication cooperation on the road includes car-to-car, car-to-infrastructure, and vice versa. Data available from vehicles are acquired and transmitted to a server for central fusion and processing. These data can be used to detect events such as rain (wiper activity) and congestion (frequent braking activities). The server processes a driving recommendation dedicated to a single or a specific group of drivers and transmits it wirelessly to vehicles. The goal of cooperative systems is to use and plan communication and sensor infrastructure to increase road safety.
The definition of cooperative systems in road traffic is according to the European Commission: 
:&quot;Road operators, infrastructure, vehicles, their drivers and other road users will cooperate to deliver the most efficient, safe, secure and comfortable journey. The vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-infrastructure co-operative systems will contribute to these objectives beyond the improvements achievable with stand-alone systems.&quot;

World Congress on Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS World Congress) is an annual trade show to promote ITS technologies. ERTICO– ITS Europe, ITS America and ITS AsiaPacific sponsor the annual ITS World Congress and exhibition. Each year the event takes place in a different region (Europe, Americas or Asia-Pacific). The first ITS World Congress was held in Paris in 1994.

== Smart transportation – new business models ==
New mobility and smart transportation models are emerging globally. Bike sharing, car sharing and scooter sharing schemes like Lime or Bird are continuing to gain popularity; electric vehicle charging schemes are taking off in many cities; the connected car is a growing market segment; while new, smart parking solutions are being used by commuters and shoppers all over the world. All these new models provide opportunities for solving last-mile issues in urban areas.

=== ITS in the connected world ===
Mobile operators are becoming a significant player in these value chains (beyond providing just connectivity). Dedicated apps can be used to take mobile payments, provide data insights and navigation tools, offer incentives and discounts, and act as a digital commerce medium.

=== Payments and billing flexibility ===
These new mobility models call for high monetization agility and partner management capabilities. A flexible settlements and billing platform enables revenues to be shared quickly and easily and provides an overall better customer experience. As well as a better service, users can also be rewarded by discounts, loyalty points and rewards, and engaged via direct marketing.

==Europe==
The Network of National ITS Associations is a grouping of national ITS interests. It was officially announced 7 October 2004 in London. The secretariat is at ERTICO – ITS Europe.

ERTICO – ITS Europe is a public/private partnership promoting the development and deployment of ITS. They connect public authorities, industry players, infrastructure operators, users, national ITS associations and other organisations together. The ERTICO work programme focuses on initiatives to improve transport safety, security and network efficiency whilst taking into account measures to reduce environmental impact.

==United States==
In the United States, each state has an ITS chapter that holds a yearly conference to promote and showcase ITS technologies and ideas. Representatives from each Department of Transportation (state, cities, towns, and counties) within the state attend this conference.

==Latin America==
===Colombia===
In the intermediate cities of Colombia, where the Strategic Public Transportation Systems are implemented, the urban transportation networks must operate under parameters that improve the quality of service provision. Several of the challenges faced by the transportation systems in these cities are aimed at increasing the number of passengers transported in the system and the technological adoption that must be integrated for the management and control of public transportation fleets. Achieving this requires strategic systems to integrate solutions based on intelligent transportation systems and information and communication technologies to optimize fleet control and management, electronic fare collection, road safety, and the delivery of information to users. The functionalities to be covered by the technology in these transportation systems include: fleet scheduling; vehicle location and traceability; cloud storage of operational data; interoperability with other information systems; centralization of operations; passenger counting; data control and visualization.

<doc id="92531" wikidata="Q192820" url="?curid=92531" title="River Shannon">
<text>The River Shannon ( or archaic &quot;&quot;) is the major river on the island of Ireland, and at in length, is the longest river in the British Isles. It drains the Shannon River Basin, which has an area of , – approximately one fifth of the area of Ireland.

Known as an important waterway since antiquity, the Shannon first appeared in maps by the Graeco-Egyptian geographer Ptolemy ( 100 –  170 AD). The river flows generally southwards from the Shannon Pot in County Cavan before turning west and emptying into the Atlantic Ocean through the long Shannon Estuary. Limerick city stands at the point where the river water meets the sea water of the estuary. The Shannon is tidal east of Limerick as far as the base of the Ardnacrusha dam. The Shannon divides the west of Ireland (principally the province of Connacht) from the east and south (Leinster and most of Munster; County Clare, being west of the Shannon but part of the province of Munster, is the major exception.) The river represents a major physical barrier between east and west, with fewer than thirty-five crossing points between the village of Dowra in the north and Limerick city in the south.

==Course==
By tradition the Shannon is said to rise in the Shannon Pot, a small pool in the townland of Derrylahan on the slopes of Cuilcagh Mountain in County Cavan, Republic of Ireland, from where the young river appears as a small trout stream. Surveys have defined a immediate pot catchment area covering the slopes of Cuilcagh. This area includes Garvah Lough, Cavan, to the northeast, drained by &quot;Pollnaowen&quot;. Further sinks that source the pot include Pollboy and, through Shannon Cave, Pollahune in Cavan and Polltullyard and Tullynakeeragh in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. The highest point in the catchment is a spring at Tiltinbane on the western end of the Cuilcagh mountain ridge.

From the Shannon Pot, the river subsumes a number of tributaries before replenishing Lough Allen at its head. The river runs through or between 11 of Ireland&#x27;s counties, subsuming the tributary rivers Boyle, Inny, Suck, Mulkear and Brosna, among others, before reaching the Shannon Estuary at Limerick.
Many different values have been given for the length of the Shannon. A traditional value is . An official Irish source gives a total length of (being fresh and tidal). Some Irish guides now give . Some academic sources give , although most will refuse to give a number. The reason is that there is no particular end to a river that empties into an estuary. The 344 km length relates to the distance between Shannon Pot and a line between Kerry Head and Loop Head, the furthest reaches of the land. (It also assumes the current shipping route via Ardnacrusha, which takes off the distance.) The 280 km distance finishes where the Shannon estuary joins the estuary of the River Fergus, close to Shannon Airport. Longer claimed lengths emerged before the use of modern surveying instruments.

At a total length of , it is the longest river in Ireland. That the Shannon is the longest river in the British Isles was evidently known in the 12th century, although a map of the time showed this river as flowing out of the south of Ireland.

There are some tributaries within the Shannon River Basin which have headwaters that are further in length (from source to mouth) than the Shannon Pot source&#x27;s length of , such as the Owenmore River, total length in County Cavan and the Boyle River, total length with its source in County Mayo.

The River Shannon is a traditional freshwater river for about 45% of its total length. Excluding the tidal estuary from its total length of , if one also excludes the lakes (L. Derg , L. Ree , L. Allen plus L. Boderg, L. Bofin, L. Forbes, L. Corry) from the Shannon&#x27;s freshwater flow of , the Shannon, as a freshwater river, is only about long.

Apart from being Ireland&#x27;s longest river, the Shannon is also, by far, Ireland&#x27;s largest river by flow. It has a long-term average flow rate of (at Limerick). This is double the flow rate of Ireland&#x27;s second highest-volume river, the short River Corrib (. If the discharges from all of the rivers and streams into the Shannon Estuary (including the rivers Feale , Maigue , Fergus , and Deel ) are added to the discharge at Limerick, the total discharge of the River Shannon at its mouth at Loop Head reaches . Indeed, the Shannon is a major river by the time it leaves Lough Ree with an average flow rate (at Athlone weir) of , larger than any of the other Irish rivers&#x27; total flow (apart from the River Corrib at Galway).

===Distributaries===
The main flow of the river is affected by some distributaries along its course, many of which rejoin it downstream. The Abbey River flows around the northeastern, eastern, and southern shores of King&#x27;s Island, Limerick before rejoining the Shannon at &quot;Hellsgate Island&quot;.

==Protected areas==
The Shannon Callows, areas of lowland along the river, are classified as a Special Area of Conservation.

==Settlements==
Settlements along the river (going upriver) include Kilrush, Tarbert, Glin, Foynes, Askeaton, Shannon Town, Limerick, Castletroy, Castleconnell, O&#x27;Briensbridge, Montpelier, Killaloe, Ballina, Portumna, Banagher, Athlone, Lanesborough, Carrick-on-Shannon, Leitrim village and Dowra.

==Historical aspects==
The river began flowing along its present course after the end of the last glacial period.

Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; (2nd century AD) described a river called Σηνος (&quot;Sēnos&quot;) from PIE *&quot;sai&quot;-/&quot;sei&quot;- &#x27;to bind&#x27;, the root of English &quot;sinew&quot; and Irish ‘’, referring to the long and sinuous estuary leading up to Limerick.

Vikings settled in the region in the 10th century and used the river to raid the rich monasteries deep inland. In 937 the Limerick Vikings clashed with those of Dublin on Lough Ree and were defeated.

In the 17th century, the Shannon was of major strategic importance in military campaigns in Ireland, as it formed a physical boundary between the east and west of the country. In the Irish Confederate Wars of 1641–53, the Irish retreated behind the Shannon in 1650 and held out for two further years against English Parliamentarian forces. In preparing a land settlement, or plantation after his conquest of Ireland Oliver Cromwell reputedly said the remaining Irish landowners would go to &quot;Hell or Connacht&quot;, referring to their choice of forced migration west across the river Shannon, or death, thus freeing up the eastern landholdings for the incoming English settlers.

In the Williamite War in Ireland (1689–91), the Jacobites also retreated behind the Shannon after their defeat at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. Athlone and Limerick, cities commanding bridges over the river, saw bloody sieges. (See Sieges of Limerick and Siege of Athlone.)

As late as 1916, the leaders of the Easter Rising planned to have their forces in the west &quot;hold the line of the Shannon&quot;. However, in the event, the rebels were neither well enough armed nor equipped to attempt such an ambitious policy.

==Navigation==
===1755 to 1820===
Though the Shannon has always been important for navigation in Ireland, there is a fall of only in its first . Consequently, it has always been shallow, with depths in various places. The first serious attempt to improve navigability came in 1755 when the Commissioners of Inland Navigation ordered Thomas Omer, a new immigrant from England, possibly of Dutch origin, to commence work. He worked at four places between Lough Derg and Lough Ree where natural navigation was obstructed, by installing lateral canals and either pound locks or flash locks. He then continued north of Lough Ree and made several similar improvements, most notably by creating the first Jamestown Canal which cut out a loop of the river between Jamestown and Drumsna, as well as lateral canals at Roosky and Lanesborough.

The lower Shannon between Killaloe and Limerick had a topography quite different from the long upper reaches. Here the river falls by in only . William Ockenden, also from England, was placed in charge of works on this stretch in 1757 and spent £12,000 over the next four years, without fully completing the task. In 1771 parliament handed over responsibility to the Limerick Navigation Company, with a grant of £6,000 to add to their subscriptions of £10,000. A lateral canal, long with six locks, was started but the company needed more funds to complete it. In 1791, William Chapman was brought in to advise and discovered a sorry state of affairs – all the locks had been built to different dimensions and he spent the next three years supervising the rebuilding of most of them. The navigation was finally opened in 1799, when over of corn came down to Limerick, as well as slates and turf. But even then, there were no tow paths in the river sections and there were still shoals in the summer months, as well as a lack of harbour facilities at Limerick, and boats were limited to load, often less.

With the approaching opening of the Grand Canal, the Grand Canal Company obtained permission from the Directors General of Inland Navigation, and asked John Brownrigg to do a survey which found that much of Omer&#x27;s work had deteriorated badly, so they started repairs. After protracted negotiations on costs and conditions, the work was completed by 1810, so that boats drawing could pass from Athlone to Killaloe. Improvements on the lower levels were also undertaken, being completed by 1814.

When the Royal Canal was completed in 1817 there was pressure to improve the navigation above Lough Ree. The Jamestown Canal was repaired, harbours built and John Killaly designed a canal alongside the river from Battlebridge to Lough Allen, which was opened in 1820.

===1820s to Independence===
In the latter part of the 1820s, trade increased dramatically with the arrival of paddle-wheeled steamers on the river which carried passengers and goods. By 1831 14,600 passengers and of freight were being carried. This put new pressure on the navigation and a commission was set up resulting in the Shannon Navigation Improvement Act 1835 (5 &amp; 6 Will. 4. c. 67) appointing five commissioners for the improvement of navigation and drainage who took possession of the whole navigation. Over the next 15 years, many improvements were made but in 1849 a railway was opened from Dublin to Limerick and the number of passengers fell dramatically. Freight, which had risen to over per year, was also halved.

But the work the commissioners carried out failed to solve the problems of flooding and there were disastrous floods in the early 1860s. Given the flat nature of most of the riverbank, this was not easily addressed and nothing much was done till the twentieth century.

===Ardnacrusha and passenger use===
One of the first projects of the Irish Free State in the 1920s was the Shannon hydroelectric scheme which established the Ardnacrusha power station on the lower Shannon above Limerick. The old Killaloe to Limerick canal with its five locks was abandoned and the head race constructed from Lough Derg also served for navigation. A double lock was provided at the dam.

In the 1950s traffic began to fall and low fixed bridges would have replaced opening bridges but for the actions of the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland which persuaded the Tánaiste to encourage passenger launches, which kept the bridges high enough for navigation. Since then the leisure trade has steadily increased, becoming a great success story.

==Canals==
There are also many canals connecting with the River Shannon. The Royal Canal and the Grand Canal connect the Shannon to Dublin and the Irish Sea. It is linked to the River Erne and Lough Erne by the Shannon–Erne Waterway.

Ballinasloe is linked to the Shannon via the River Suck and canal, while Boyle is connected via the Boyle canal, the river Boyle and Lough Key. There is also the Ardnacrusha canal connected with the Ardnacrusha dam south of Lough Derg. Near Limerick, a short canal connects Plassey with the Abbey River, allowing boats to bypass the Curraghower Falls, a major obstacle to navigation. Lecarrow village in County Roscommon is connected to Lough Ree via the Lecarrow canal. Jamestown Canal and the Albert Lock form a link between the River Shannon, from south of Jamestown, to Lough Nanoge to the south of Drumsna.

==Etymology and folklore==
===Sionnann===

According to Irish mythology, the river was named after a woman (in many sources a member of the Tuatha de Danaan) named Sionann (older spelling forms: Sínann or Sínand), the granddaughter of Manannán mac Lir. She went to Connla&#x27;s Well to find wisdom, despite having been warned not to approach it. In some sources she, like Fionn mac Cumhaill, caught and ate the Salmon of Wisdom who swam there, becoming the wisest being on Earth, in others, she merely drank from the well. At any rate, the waters of the well are said to have burst forth, drowning Sionann, and carrying her out to sea. Notably, a similar tale is told of Boann and the River Boyne. It is said that Sionann thus became the goddess of the river. Patricia Monaghan notes that &quot;The drowning of a goddess in a river is common in Irish mythology and typically represents the dissolving of her divine power into the water, which then gives life to the land&quot;.

A small myth about Sionann tells that the legendary hunter-warrior Fionn mac Cumhaill was attacked by a number of other warriors at Ballyleague, near north Lough Ree. It is said that when Fionn was near to defeat, Sionnan rescued him, and he arrived with the Stone of Sionann, threw the stone, and the warriors were immediately killed. It further says that Fionn was afraid of the power of the stone and threw it into the river, where it remains at a low ford, and that if a woman named Be Thuinne finds it, then the world&#x27;s end is near.

===Creatures===
The Shannon reputedly hosts a river monster named Cata, the first known mention being in the medieval Book of Lismore. In this manuscript, we are told that Senán, patron saint of County Clare, defeated the monster at Inis Cathaigh. Cata is described as a large creature with a horse&#x27;s mane, gleaming eyes, thick feet, nails of iron, and a whale&#x27;s tail. Another story has an oilliphéist flee its home in the Shannon, upon hearing that Saint Patrick has arrived to remove its kind from Ireland.

==Economics==

Despite being long, it rises only above sea level, so the river is easily navigable, with only a few locks along its length. There is a hydroelectric generation plant at Ardnacrusha belonging to the ESB.

Shipping in the Shannon estuary was developed extensively during the 1980s, with over IR£2 billion (€2.5 billion) investment. A tanker terminal at Foynes and an oil jetty at Shannon Airport were built. In 1982 a large-scale alumina extraction plant was built at Aughinish. 60,000-tonne cargo vessels now carry raw bauxite from West African mines to the plant, where it is refined to alumina. This is then exported to Canada where it is further refined to aluminium. 1985 saw the opening of a 915 MW coal-fired electricity plant at Moneypoint, fed by regular visits by 150,000-tonne bulk carriers.

==Flora and fauna==
===Shannon eel management programme===
A trap and transport scheme is in force on the Shannon as part of an eel management programme following the discovery of a reduced eel population. This scheme ensures safe passage for young eels between Lough Derg and the Shannon estuary.

==Fishing==
Though the Shannon estuary fishing industry is now depleted, at one time it employed hundreds of men along its length. At Limerick, fishermen based on Clancy&#x27;s Strand used the Gandelow to catch Salmon. The Abbey Fishermen used a net and a boat type known as a Breacaun to fish between Limerick City and Plassey until 1929. In 1929, the construction of a dam at Ardnacrusha severely impacted salmon breeding and that, and the introduction of quotas, had by the 1950s caused salmon fishing to cease. However, recreational fishing still goes on. Further down the Shannon Estuary at Kilrush the Currach was used to catch herring as well as drift netting for salmon.

==Water extraction==

Dublin City Council published a plan in 2011 to supply up to 350 million litres of water a day from Lough Derg to Dublin city and region. In 2016 the Parteen Basin to the south of lough was chosen as the proposed site of extraction. Water would be pumped to a break pressure tank Knockanacree near Cloughjordan in County Tipperary and gravity fed from there by pipeline to Dublin.

<text>Peroxidases or peroxide reductases (EC number 1.11.1.x) are a large group of enzymes which play a role in various biological processes. They are named after the fact that they commonly break up peroxides, and should not be confused with other enzymes that &quot;produce&quot; peroxide, which are often oxidases.

==Functionality==
Peroxidases typically catalyze a reaction of the form:

:&lt;chem&gt;ROOR&#x27; + \overset{electron\atop donor}{2e^-} + 2H+ -&gt;[\ce{Peroxidase}] {ROH} + R&#x27;OH&lt;/chem&gt;

===Optimal substrates===
For many of these enzymes the optimal substrate is hydrogen peroxide, but others are more active with organic hydroperoxides such as lipid peroxides. Peroxidases can contain a heme cofactor in their active sites, or alternately redox-active cysteine or selenocysteine residues.

The nature of the electron donor is very dependent on the structure of the enzyme.
* For example, horseradish peroxidase can use a variety of organic compounds as electron donors and acceptors. Horseradish peroxidase has an accessible active site, and many compounds can reach the site of the reaction.
* On the other hand, for an enzyme such as cytochrome c peroxidase, the compounds that donate electrons are very specific, due to a very narrow active site.

=== Classification ===
Protein families that serve as peroxidases include:

* Haem-using
** haem peroxidase and the related animal heme-dependent peroxidases
** DyP-type peroxidase family
** Catalase
** some haloperoxidase
** Di-haem cytochrome c peroxidase
* Non-heme
** Thiol: glutathione peroxidase, peroxiredoxin
** vanadium bromoperoxidase
** Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase
** Manganese peroxidase
** NADH peroxidase

==Characterization==
The glutathione peroxidase family consists of 8 known human isoforms. Glutathione peroxidases use glutathione as an electron donor and are active with both hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxide substrates. Gpx1, Gpx2, Gpx3, and Gpx4 have been shown to be selenium-containing enzymes, whereas Gpx6 is a selenoprotein in humans with cysteine-containing homologues in rodents.

Amyloid beta, when bound to heme, has been shown to have peroxidase activity.

A typical group of peroxidases are the haloperoxidases. This group is able to form reactive halogen species and, as a result, natural organohalogen substances.

A majority of peroxidase protein sequences can be found in the PeroxiBase database.

==Pathogenic resistance==
While the exact mechanisms have yet to be determined, peroxidases are known to play a part in increasing a plant&#x27;s defenses against pathogens. Many members of the Solanaceae, notably &quot;Solanum melongena&quot; (eggplant/aubergine) and &quot;Capsicum chinense&quot; (the habanero/Scotch bonnet varieties of chili peppers) use Guaiacol and the enzyme guaiacol peroxidase as a defense against bacterial parasites such as &quot;Ralstonia solanacearum&quot;: the gene expression for this enzyme commences within minutes of bacterial attack.

==Applications==
Peroxidase can be used for treatment of industrial waste waters. For example, phenols, which are important pollutants, can be removed by enzyme-catalyzed polymerization using horseradish peroxidase. Thus phenols are oxidized to phenoxy radicals, which participate in reactions where polymers and oligomers are produced that are less toxic than phenols. It also can be used to convert toxic materials into less harmful substances.

There are many investigations about the use of peroxidase in many manufacturing processes like adhesives, computer chips, car parts, and linings of drums and cans. Other studies have shown that peroxidases may be used successfully to polymerize anilines and phenols in organic solvent matrices.

Peroxidases are sometimes used as histological markers. Cytochrome c peroxidase is used as a soluble, easily purified model for cytochrome c oxidase.

<doc id="92534" wikidata="Q94839" url="?curid=92534" title="Mohammed Deif">
<text>Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri (; 12 August 1965 – 13 July 2024), better known as Mohammed Deif (), was a Palestinian militant and the head of the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Palestinian nationalist Sunni Islamist organization Hamas.

Deif was born around 1965 in the Khan Yunis Refugee Camp in the Gaza Strip, to a family that fled or were expelled during the 1948 Palestine war. He reportedly left school temporarily to support his low-income family, later graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry from the Islamic University of Gaza in 1988, where he had established a theater group.

Deif joined Hamas in 1987, weeks after it was established during the First Intifada against the Israeli occupation, and later became known as Mohammed Deif, meaning &#x27;guest&#x27; in Arabic, possibly in reference to the nomadic lifestyle he adopted to avoid being targeted. During the 1990s and early 2000s, he planned several suicide bombing attacks, including the 1996 Jaffa Road bus bombings. He became the head of the al-Qassam Brigades in 2002 and developed the group&#x27;s capabilities, transforming it from a cluster of amateur cells to organized military units. He masterminded the group&#x27;s strategy of combining rocket attacks on Israel with tunnel warfare, and was central to planning the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel that initiated the Gaza war.

Deif had been on the Israeli military&#x27;s most wanted list since 1995 for killing Israeli soldiers and civilians. He was detained by the Palestinian Authority at Israel&#x27;s request in 2000 before escaping months later. He had been targeted in multiple Israeli assassination attempts since 2001, surviving at least seven attempts on his life. His wife, infant son, and 3-year-old daughter were killed in an Israeli airstrike in 2014. The United States and the European Union added Deif to their terrorism lists in 2015 and 2023 respectively. In May 2024, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) applied for arrest warrants for Deif and several other Hamas and Israeli leaders for their war conduct.

Israel assassinated Deif in an airstrike in al-Mawasi on 13 July 2024. After denying for over five months that Deif died in the airstrike, Hamas eventually confirmed his death on 30 January 2025.

==Early life==
Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri was born on 12 August 1965 in the Khan Younis refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip. His family originates from al-Qubeiba, a former town near Ramleh in Mandatory Palestine, but fled or were expelled during the 1948 Palestine war. According to the Shin Bet, either his father or his uncle had participated in sporadic raids into Israel conducted by Palestinian fedayeen in the 1950s.

Although not much is known about the details of his early life and upbringing, he reportedly had to temporarily drop out of school to support his low-income family, working with his father in upholstery and later starting a small poultry farm. It is understood that he studied chemistry at the Islamic University of Gaza, from which he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1988.

During his years at the university, he had a passion for theatre, establishing a theatre group called &quot;The Returners&quot;, in reference to Palestinian refugees longing to return to the lands they lived on before the Nakba. He played a number of roles, including those of historical figures.

== Early militant career ==
Deif joined Hamas in 1987, weeks after its establishment during the First Intifada against the Israeli occupation. He was arrested by Israeli authorities in 1989 for his involvement with the organization. After 16 months of detention, he was released in a prisoner exchange. Soon after his release, he helped establish the Ezzedeen al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas.

Deif was close to Emad Akel and Yahya Ayyash, who were assassinated by Israel in 1993 and 1996 respectively. He trained with, and learnt bombmaking from, Ayyash. After Ayyash&#x27;s assassination, Deif reduced his profile to avoid being targeted. During the 1990s and early 2000s, he was behind a number of suicide bombing attacks, including the 1996 Jaffa Road bus bombings. He also oversaw the kidnappings and later killings of Israeli soldiers Shahar Simani, Aryeh Frankenthal, and Nachshon Wachsman in the 1990s.

In May 2000, Deif was arrested at Israel&#x27;s request by the Palestinian National Authority, but he escaped in December with assistance from some of his guards.

According to Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman, Deif&#x27;s campaign of massive retaliation and the failure of Israeli intelligence services to prevent it, was one of the factors that led to the defeat of Prime Minister Shimon Peres and the Israeli Labor Party in the 1996 Israeli general election and the victory of the right-wing Likud party of Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposed the Oslo peace process:

At the beginning of February, Peres was up twenty points in the polls over his opposition, the conservative hawk Benjamin &quot;Bibi&quot; Netanyahu. By the middle of March, Netanyahu had closed the gap significantly, and Peres led by only five percentage points. On May 29, Netanyahu won by 1 percent of the vote. This was all due to the terror attacks, which Peres simply couldn&#x27;t stop. Yahya Ayyash&#x27;s disciples had ensured the right wing&#x27;s victory and &quot;derailed the peace process,&quot; in the words of the deputy head of the Shin Bet, Yisrael Hasson.After Netanyahu got elected, attacks stopped, with some asserting that this was because Yasser Arafat clamped down on Hamas members, but Bergman insisting that the halt was because the short-term goal of the attacks was to stop the Oslo peace process, and Netanyahu was now working towards the same goal.

== Head of the al-Qassam Brigades ==
Deif became the head of the al-Qassam Brigades after Israel assassinated Salah Shehade in July 2002. Between July 2006 and November 2012, effective command was exercised by Deif&#x27;s deputy, Ahmed Jabari, after Deif was seriously wounded in an Israeli assassination attempt.

As the overall commander of the al-Qassam Brigades, he is thought to be the main organizer of the raid into Israel that killed two IDF soldiers and captured Gilad Shalit in June 2006, as well as the five-year operations to deceive Mossad and Shin Bet about Shalit&#x27;s location in Gaza. He was also in charge of the al-Qassam Brigades&#x27; procurement of weapons from abroad, overseeing the transfer and manufacturing of Iranian Fajr-5 rocket components into Gaza, and maintained correspondence with Iranian Quds Force commander Esmail Qaani and his predecessor Qasem Soleimani. In a letter, Soleimani had called Deif a &quot;dear brother&quot; and a &quot;living martyr&quot;.

In September 2015, the US Department of State added Deif and three other Hamas leaders to the American list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists. In December 2023, the European Union added him to their terror blacklist in 2023.

=== Shadow Unit ===
Deif also created the &quot;Shadow Unit&quot; within the al-Qassam Brigades. Among the unit&#x27;s duties are &quot;to guard enemy captives held by the al-Qassam Brigades, to hide them and to thwart enemy attempts to find them.&quot; An al-Qassam video said that the unit &quot;treats enemy captives honorably, in line with the rules of Islam, and provides for their needs, taking into account the treatment given to the prisoners of the resistance in the hands of the enemy.&quot;

=== Strategy ===

Deif has been credited with transforming the al-Qassam Brigades from a cluster of amateur cells to organized military units, described as an &#x27;army,&#x27; that are capable of invading Israel. His military strategy has been dubbed the &#x27;above and below&#x27; strategy, built on attacking Israeli territory with rockets and constructing underground tunnels to be used in infiltrating the border with Israel.

=== Israel–Hamas war ===
As the highest-ranking leader of the al-Qassam Brigades, Deif was involved in orchestrating the surprise attack on Israel that commenced the Israel–Hamas war, which, according to a source close to Hamas, he began planning in the lead up to the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, motivated by scenes of Israeli forces storming al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramadan. According to France 24, he was the mastermind behind the attack on 7 October. The decision to launch the attack was taken jointly by Deif and Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

After the attack, a Reuters report stated that over the previous two years, Deif deceived Israel into believing Hamas was not interested in another round of conflict. This deception campaign involved a decision not to participate in the clashes between Israel and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in August 2022 and May 2023, putting Israel under the impression that Hamas &quot;was not ready for a fight&quot; and could be contained by providing economic incentives to Gazan workers.

On the day of the attack, Deif gave an audio address, his first since 2021, justifying it as a response to the &quot;desecration&quot; of the al-Aqsa Mosque and the killing and wounding of hundreds of Palestinians in 2023. He called on Palestinians and Arab Israelis to &quot;expel the occupiers and demolish the walls&quot;. Announcing the start of &quot;Operation Al-Aqsa Storm,&quot; Deif said that &quot;In light of the continuing crimes against our people, in light of the orgy of occupation and its denial of international laws and resolutions, and in light of American and western support, we&#x27;ve decided to put an end to all this so that the enemy understands that he can no longer revel without being held to account.&quot;

On 20 May 2024, a request for an arrest warrant against Deif and four other Palestinian and Israeli leaders was filed by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on several counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, as part of its investigation in Palestine. The effort continued into September 2024, with the prosecutor saying that he was gathering information about Deif&#x27;s &quot;reported death.&quot; On 21 November, the court officially indicted Deif for war crimes, stating that he bore responsibility for mass killings, hostage taking and rape during the 7 October attacks. The ICC argued that it was &quot;not in a position to determine whether [Deif] has been killed or remains alive&quot; following reports that Deif was killed in an Israeli airstrike on 13 July 2024.

On 3 September 2024, the United States Department of Justice announced criminal charges against Deif and other Hamas officials for their roles in the 7 October attack on Israel. The charges, which were filed under seal in February 2024, include conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, conspiracy to murder U.S. nationals, and conspiracy to finance terrorism.

== Unsuccessful assassination attempts ==
The Israeli military and security forces have killed numerous members of Deif&#x27;s family in failed attempts to kill Deif, who was on top of Israel&#x27;s &#x27;most wanted list&#x27; since 1995, and other airstrikes. Deif&#x27;s survival earned him the nickname &#x27;the cat with nine lives&#x27; among his Israeli adversaries. He survived at least seven Israeli assassination attempts.

As of December 2023, Israeli military and security forces have killed Deif&#x27;s brother, his nephew, his niece, his wife, his 3-year-old daughter, and his 7-month-old son.

=== Early attempts (2001 to 2006) ===
The first attempt on his life was by an airstrike in 2001, before he assumed the leadership of the al-Qassam Brigades. Israel tried again to kill Deif in September 2002 by a strike on his car. Video footage from that attempt show Deif covered in blood as a man drags him away.

In 2003 and in July 2006, Israel tried again by striking a house that hosted a meeting of the Hamas leadership. It is also said that the July 2006 attempt was an airstrike on the house of one of Deif&#x27;s lecturers in university when Deif was visiting him.

=== Impact on health ===
After the 2006 assassination attempt, Deif spent three months in Egypt for treatment of his skull after shrapnel lodged in it, and he continued to take daily tranquillizers to treat headaches.

It was believed that the seven assassination attempts had lost Deif an eye and limbs. Hamas did not confirm or deny these claims and did not comment on his health. Footage obtained by the Israeli military in December 2023 showed Deif using both hands and walking on his own two feet, though with a slight limp and occasionally with the aid of a wheelchair.

=== 2014 Gaza war ===

In August 2014, during the 2014 Gaza War, the Israeli air force attempted to assassinate him with an airstrike on the Deif family home in Sheikh Radwan in Gaza City. Hamas denied that Deif was killed, and his survival was confirmed by Israeli intelligence in 2015.

=== Two failed attempts in one week (2021) ===
In May 2021, during the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, the Israel military tried to kill Deif twice in one week, but both attempts proved unsuccessful.

=== October 2023 attack on father&#x27;s house ===
In October 2023, during the Israel–Hamas war, Deif&#x27;s father&#x27;s house was hit by an Israeli airstrike, killing Deif&#x27;s brother, nephew, and niece. It was unclear whether or not the airstrike targeted Deif.

==Assassination==
On 13 July 2024, he was targeted in an Israeli strike in the al-Mawasi neighborhood of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip. According to reports from the Gaza Ministry of Health, at least 90 Palestinians were killed and over 300 injured as a result of the attack. The IDF reported that one of Deif&#x27;s associates and a mastermind of the 7 October attack, the Khan Yunis Brigade commander Rafa Salama, was among the dead. In relation to Deif, the IDF stated that there were signs that he too had been killed, but they were unable to officially confirm that. Reportedly, a dead body suspected to belong to Deif was recovered from the site but was too badly disfigured to be identified. On 1 August 2024, the IDF announced it had confirmed that Deif died in the 13 July strike. Two weeks after the IDF announced its confirmation, Hamas denied that Deif was killed, with senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan stating in an interview with the Associated Press that Deif was still alive.

In October 2024, Hamas again called Deif&#x27;s death a lie, while issuing a statement denying the death of Yahya Sinwar. The next day Hamas acknowledged Sinwar&#x27;s death without making any additional comments about Deif&#x27;s status. In early November, the London-based Saudi newspaper &quot;Asharq Al-Awsat&quot; reported that Hamas has privately acknowledged Deif&#x27;s death, but Hamas released a statement denying the newspaper&#x27;s report.

On November 21, 2024 the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Mohammed Deif, arguing that it was unable to determine whether Deif had been killed and that the warrant would be withdrawn upon confirmation of his death.

On December 4, 2024, Israeli news channel Kan 11, citing Palestinian sources, reported that Hamas had located Deif&#x27;s body and buried it in secret. According to the report, Hamas maintained secrecy over Deif&#x27;s death due to fears that confirming it would lower the morale of its fighters, and buried him in an undisclosed location due to fears that if Israel discovered the location of his grave, the IDF would dig it up and take his body to use as a bargaining chip in a hostage deal.

On January 30, 2025, the Qassam Brigades, through their spokesperson Abu Ubeida, confirmed that Mohammed Deif, along with six other senior Hamas commanders, died as a result of the Israel–Hamas war. Along with the confirmation, Hamas also officially released a photo of Deif for the first time, as his photo had previously been classified.

== Public image ==
Deif, the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; that Mohammed al-Masri took, means &#x27;guest&#x27; in Arabic. This is said to refer to Deif staying in a different house each night as a precaution against Israeli attacks. Another explanation said that the name comes from a theatre role he played in his earlier years. He is also known by his &quot;kunya&quot; Abu Khaled.

Prior to the Israel–Hamas war, only two photos of Deif&#x27;s face were known to publicly exist, with the most recent one having been taken in the year 2000. He never appears in public, and he rarely gives recorded audio addresses. His whereabouts are unknown, but it is likely that he has stayed in the underground tunnel networks in Gaza. In January 2024, the IDF released a photo of Deif holding a cup of juice in one hand and a stack of U.S. dollars in the other hand. The photo was found in a computer that Israel seized from Hamas.

In spite of his elusiveness, he is highly popular amongst Palestinians for his hardline stance against Israel. He has become a &#x27;folk hero&#x27; for his survival of many assassination attempts and has been nicknamed &#x27;the mastermind&#x27; by Palestinians. As a sign of his popularity, his name has been featured in protest slogans such as: &quot;Put the sword before the sword, we are the men of Mohammed Deif.&quot; His position as a military leader rather than a political one has shielded him from criticism of the Hamas administration of the Gaza Strip.

After acknowledging his death, Hamas began using photos of Deif at ceremonies for the release of the hostages to the custody of the Red Cross as part of the 2025 Gaza war ceasefire agreement.

== Personal life ==
Deif married Widad Asfoura in 2007. Widad, their infant son Ali, and their three-year-old daughter Sarah were killed in the 2014 assassination attempt. They had two other children: Omar, who was injured, and Hala, who was missing for more than two days. Deif had two other sons, Bahaa and Khaled.

Deif&#x27;s mother died in 2011, and his father in 2022.
His family came to the Gaza Strip from further away than most members of Hamas; before 1948 his family lived in al-Qubayba in Central Palestine.

<doc id="92536" wikidata="Q2121742" url="?curid=92536" title="Underground comix">
<text>Underground comix are small press or self-published comic books that are often socially relevant or satirical in nature. They differ from mainstream comics in depicting content forbidden to mainstream publications by the Comics Code Authority, including explicit drug use, sexuality, and violence. They were most popular in the United States in the late 1960s and 1970s, and in the United Kingdom in the 1960s and 1970s.

Robert Crumb, Gilbert Shelton, Barbara &quot;Willy&quot; Mendes, Trina Robbins and numerous other cartoonists created underground titles that were popular with readers within the counterculture scene. Punk had its own comic artists like Gary Panter. Long after their heyday, underground comix gained prominence with films and television shows influenced by the movement and with mainstream comic books, but their legacy is most obvious with alternative comics.

==History==
===United States===
The United States underground comics scene emerged in the 1960s, focusing on subjects dear to the counterculture: recreational drug use, politics, rock music, and free love. The underground comix scene had its strongest success in the United States between 1968 and 1975, with titles initially distributed primarily through head shops. Underground comix often featured covers intended to appeal to the drug culture, and imitated LSD-inspired posters to increase sales.

These titles were termed &quot;comix&quot; in order to differentiate them from mainstream publications. The &quot;X&quot; also emphasized the X-rated contents of the publications. Many of the common aspects of the underground comix scene were in response to the strong restrictions forced upon mainstream publications by the Comics Code Authority, which refused publications featuring depictions of violence, sexuality, drug use, and socially relevant content, all of which appeared in greater levels in underground comix. Robert Crumb stated that the appeal of underground comix was their lack of censorship: &quot;People forget that that was what it was all about. That was why we did it. We didn&#x27;t have anybody standing over us saying &#x27;No, you can&#x27;t draw this&#x27; or &#x27;You can&#x27;t show that&#x27;. We could do whatever we wanted&quot;.

====Antecedents====
Between the late 1920s and late 1940s, anonymous underground artists produced counterfeit pornographic comic books featuring unauthorized depictions of popular comic strip characters engaging in sexual activities. Often referred to as Tijuana bibles, these books are often considered the predecessors of the underground comix scene.

American comix were strongly influenced by 1950s EC Comics and especially magazines edited by Harvey Kurtzman, including &quot;Mad&quot; (which first appeared in 1952). Kurtzman&#x27;s &quot;Help!&quot; magazine, published from 1960 to 1965, featured the works of artists who would later become well known in the underground comix scene, including R. Crumb and Gilbert Shelton. Other artists published work in college magazines before becoming known in the underground scene.

====1962–1968: Early history====
Early underground comix appeared sporadically in the early- and mid-1960s, but did not begin to appear frequently until after 1967. The first underground comix were personal works produced for friends of the artists. Perhaps the earliest of the underground comic strips was Frank Stack&#x27;s (under the pseudonym Foolbert Sturgeon) &quot;The Adventures of Jesus&quot;, begun in 1962 and compiled in photocopied zine form by Gilbert Shelton in 1964. It has been credited as the first underground comic. Shelton&#x27;s own Wonder Wart-Hog appeared in the college humor magazine &quot;Bacchanal&quot; #1-2 in 1962. Jack Jackson&#x27;s &quot;God Nose&quot;, published in Texas in 1964, has also been given that title. One guide lists two other underground comix from that year, Vaughn Bodē&#x27;s &quot;Das Kampf&quot; and Charles Plymell&#x27;s &quot;Robert Ronnie Branaman&quot;.

Joel Beck began contributing a full-page comic each week to the underground newspaper the &quot;Berkeley Barb&quot; and his full-length comic &quot;Lenny of Laredo&quot; was published in 1965. Another underground paper, the &quot;East Village Other&quot;, was an important precursor to the underground comix movement, featuring comic strips by artists including Crumb, Shelton, Kim Deitch, Trina Robbins, Spain Rodriguez, and Art Spiegelman before true underground comix emerged from San Francisco with the first issue of &quot;Zap Comix&quot;. &quot;Zap&quot; and many of the first true underground comix publications began with reprints of comic strip pages which first appeared in underground papers like the &quot;East Village Other&quot;, the &quot;Berkeley Barb&quot;, and &quot;Yarrowstalks&quot;.

====1968–1972: Underground&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age&quot;====
In February 1968, in San Francisco, Robert Crumb published (with the help of poet Charles Plymell and Don Donahue of Apex Novelties) his first solo comic, &quot;Zap Comix&quot;. The title was financially successful and almost single-handedly developed a market for underground comix.

Within a few issues, &quot;Zap&quot; began to feature other cartoonists — including S. Clay Wilson, Robert Williams, Spain Rodriguez, and Gilbert Shelton — and Crumb launched a series of solo titles, including &quot;Despair&quot;, &quot;Uneeda&quot; (both published by Print Mint in 1969), &quot;Big Ass Comics&quot;, &quot;R. Crumb&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;, &quot;Motor City Comics&quot; (all published by Rip Off Press in 1969), &quot;Home Grown Funnies&quot; (Kitchen Sink Press, 1971) and &quot;Hytone Comix&quot; (Apex Novelties, 1971), in addition to founding the pornographic anthologies &quot;Jiz&quot; and &quot;Snatch&quot; (both Apex Novelties, 1969).

The San Francisco Bay Area was an epicenter of the underground comix movement; Crumb and many other underground cartoonists lived in San Francisco&#x27;s Haight-Ashbury neighborhood in the mid-to-late 1960s. Just as importantly, the major underground publishers were all based in the area: Don Donahue&#x27;s Apex Novelties, Gary Arlington&#x27;s San Francisco Comic Book Company, and Rip Off Press were all headquartered in the city, with Ron Turner&#x27;s Last Gasp and the Print Mint based in Berkeley. Last Gasp later moved to San Francisco.

By the end of the 1960s, there was recognition of the movement by a major American museum when the Corcoran Gallery of Art staged an exhibition, &quot;The Phonus Balonus Show&quot; (May 20-June 15, 1969). Curated by Bhob Stewart for famed museum director Walter Hopps, it included work by Crumb, Shelton, Vaughn Bodé, Kim Deitch, Jay Lynch and others.

Crumb&#x27;s best known underground features included &quot;Whiteman&quot;, &quot;Angelfood McSpade&quot;, &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Natural&quot;. Crumb also drew himself as a character, caricaturing himself as a self-loathing, sex-obsessed intellectual. While Crumb&#x27;s work was often praised for its social commentary, he was also criticized for the misogyny that appeared within his comics. Trina Robbins said: &quot;It&#x27;s weird to me how willing people are to overlook the hideous darkness in Crumb&#x27;s work... What the hell is funny about rape and murder?&quot; Because of his popularity, many underground cartoonists tried to imitate Crumb&#x27;s work. While &quot;Zap&quot; was the best-known anthology of the scene, other anthologies appeared, including &quot;Bijou Funnies&quot;, a Chicago publication edited by Jay Lynch and heavily influenced by &quot;Mad&quot;. The San Francisco anthology &quot;Young Lust&quot; (Company &amp; Sons, 1970), which parodied the 1950s romance genre, featured works by Bill Griffith and Art Spiegelman. Another anthology, &quot;Bizarre Sex&quot; (Kitchen Sink, 1972), was influenced by science fiction comics and included art by Denis Kitchen and Richard &quot;Grass&quot; Green, one of the few African-American comix creators.

Other important underground cartoonists of the era included Shelton, Wilson, Deitch, Rodriguez, Skip Williamson, Rick Griffin, George Metzger, and Victor Moscoso. Shelton became famous for his characters Wonder Wart-Hog, a superhero parody, and The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers, a strip about a trio of &quot;freaks&quot; whose time is spent attempting to acquire drugs and avoid the police, both of which first appeared in the self-published &quot;Feds &#x27;N&#x27; Heads&quot; in 1968. Wilson&#x27;s work is permeated by shocking violence and ugly sex; he contributed to &quot;Zap&quot; and created the infamous The Checkered Demon, a portly, shirtless being who is frequently called upon to kill the various demented bikers, pirates, and rapists who populate Wilson&#x27;s universe. Spain worked for the &quot;East Village Other&quot; before becoming known within underground comix for Trashman and his solo titles &quot;Zodiac Mindwarp&quot; and &quot;Subvert&quot;. Williamson created his character Snappy Sammy Smoot, appearing in several titles.

Underground horror comics also became popular, with titles such as &quot;Skull&quot; (Rip Off Press, 1970), &quot;Bogeyman&quot; (San Francisco Comic Book Company, 1969), &quot;Fantagor&quot; (Richard Corben, 1970), &quot;Insect Fear&quot; (Print Mint, 1970), &quot;Up From the Deep&quot; (Rip Off Press, 1971), &quot;Death Rattle&quot; (Kitchen Sink, 1972), &quot;Gory Stories&quot; (Shroud, 1972), &quot;Deviant Slice&quot; (Print Mint, 1972) and &quot;Two Fisted Zombies&quot; (Last Gasp, 1973). Many of these were strongly influenced by 1950s EC Comics like &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;.

The male-dominated scene produced many blatantly misogynistic works, but female underground cartoonists made strong marks as well. Edited by Trina Robbins, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me, Babe&quot;, published by Last Gasp in 1970, was the first all-female underground comic; followed in 1972 by &quot;Wimmen&#x27;s Comix&quot; (Last Gasp), an anthology series founded by cartoonist that featured (among others) Melinda Gebbie, Lynda Barry, Aline Kominsky, and Shary Flenniken. Joyce Farmer and Lyn Chevli&#x27;s &quot;Tits &amp; Clits Comix&quot; all-female anthology debuted in 1972 as well.

====1972–1975: Controversy and recognition====
By 1972–1973, the city&#x27;s Mission District was &quot;underground headquarters&quot;: living and operating out of The Mission in that period were Gary Arlington, Roger Brand, Kim Deitch, Don Donahue, Shary Flenniken, Justin Green, Bill Griffith &amp; Diane Noomin, Rory Hayes, Jay Kinney, Bobby London, Ted Richards, Trina Robbins, Joe Schenkman, Larry Todd, Patricia Moodian and Art Spiegelman.

Mainstream publications such as &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;National Lampoon&quot; began to publish comics and art similar to that of underground comix. The underground movement also prompted older professional comic book artists to try their hand in the alternate press. Wally Wood published &quot;witzend&quot; in 1966, soon passing the title on to artist-editor Bill Pearson. In 1969, Wood created &quot;Heroes, Inc. Presents Cannon&quot;, intended for distribution to armed forces bases. Steve Ditko gave full vent to his Ayn Rand-inspired philosophy in &quot;Mr. A&quot; and &quot;Avenging World&quot; (1973). In 1975, Flo Steinberg, Stan Lee&#x27;s former secretary at Marvel Comics, published &quot;Big Apple Comix&quot;, featuring underground work by ostensibly &quot;mainstream&quot; artists she knew from Marvel.

Film and television began to reflect the influence of underground comix in the 1970s, starting with the release of Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s Crumb adaptation, &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;, the first animated film to receive an X rating from the MPAA. Further adult-oriented animated films based on or influenced by underground comix followed, including &quot;The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat&quot; and &quot;Down and Dirty Duck&quot;. The influence of underground comix has also been attributed to films such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1978) and &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; (1980). The animation sequences – created by &quot;Help!&quot; contributor Terry Gilliam – and surrealistic humor of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; have also been partly attributed to the influence of the underground comix scene.

Despite the form&#x27;s influence on the culture at large, however, by 1972, only four major underground publishers remained in operation: the Print Mint, Rip Off Press, Last Gasp, and Krupp Comic Works (Kitchen Sink Press). For much of the 1970s, Rip Off Press operated a syndication service, managed by cartoonist and co-owner Gilbert Shelton, that sold weekly comix content to alternative newspapers and student publications. Each Friday, the company sent out a distribution sheet with the strips it was selling, by such cartoonists as Shelton, Joel Beck, Dave Sheridan, Ted Richards, Bill Griffith, and Harry Driggs (as R. Diggs). The syndicate petered out by 1979; much of the material produced for it was eventually published in the company&#x27;s long-running anthology &quot;Rip Off Comix&quot;, which had debuted in 1977. Griffith&#x27;s strip, &quot;Zippy&quot;, which had debuted in 1976 as a weekly strip with the syndicate, was eventually picked up for daily syndication by King Features Syndicate in 1986.

Critics of the underground comix scene claimed that the publications were socially irresponsible, and glorified violence, sex and drug use. In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court, in &quot;Miller v. California&quot;, ruled that local communities could decide their own First Amendment standards with reference to obscenity. In the mid-1970s, sale of drug paraphernalia was outlawed in many places, and the distribution network for these comics (and the underground newspapers) dried up, leaving mail order as the only commercial outlet for underground titles.

In 1974, Marvel launched &quot;Comix Book&quot;, requesting that underground artists submit significantly less explicit work appropriate for newsstands sales. A number of underground artists agreed to contribute work, including Spiegelman, Robbins and S. Clay Wilson, but &quot;Comix Book&quot; did not sell well and lasted only five issues. In 1976, Marvel achieved success with &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;, a satirical comic aimed at adult audiences that was inspired by the underground comix scene. While it did not depict the explicit content that was often featured in underground comix, it was more socially relevant than anything Marvel had previously published.

By the mid-1970s, independent publishers began to release book-length collections of underground comics. Quick Fox/Links Books released two important collections, &quot;The Apex Treasury of Underground Comics&quot;, published in 1974, and &quot;The Best of Bijou Funnies&quot;, released in 1975. The &quot;Apex Treasury&quot; featured work by Crumb, Deitch, Griffith, Spain, Shelton, Spiegelman, Lynch, Shary Flenniken, Justin Green, Bobby London, and Willy Murphy; while the &quot;Bijou Funnies&quot; book highlighted comics by Lynch, Green, Crumb, Shelton, Spiegelman, Deitch, Skip Williamson, Jay Kinney, Evert Geradts, Rory Hayes, Dan Clyne, and Jim Osborne. Similarly, and around this time, the publishing cooperative And/Or Press published &quot;The Young Lust Reader&quot; (1974), a &quot;best-of&quot; collection from Griffith and Kinney&#x27;s &quot;Young Lust&quot; anthology, and Dave Sheridan and Fred Schrier&#x27;s &quot;The Overland Vegetable Stagecoach presents Mindwarp: An Anthology&quot; (1975). And/Or Press later published the first paperback collections of Griffith&#x27;s Zippy the Pinhead comics.

====1975–1982: The underground era comes to a close====
By this time, some artists, including Art Spiegelman, felt that the underground comix scene had become less creative than it had been in the past. According to Spiegelman: &quot;What had seemed like a revolution simply deflated into a lifestyle. Underground comics were stereotyped as dealing only with Sex, Dope and Cheap Thrills. They got stuffed back into the closet, along with bong pipes and love beads, as Things Started To Get Uglier&quot;.

One of the last major underground titles was &quot;&quot;, co-edited by Spiegelman and Bill Griffith. With the underground movement encountering a slowdown, Spiegelman and Griffith conceived of &quot;Arcade&quot; as a &quot;safe berth&quot;, featuring contributions from such major underground figures as Robert Armstrong, Robert Crumb, Justin Green, Aline Kominsky, Jay Lynch, Spain Rodriguez, Gilbert Shelton, and S. Clay Wilson (as well as Griffith and Spiegelman). &quot;Arcade&quot; stood out from similar publications by having an editorial plan, in which Spiegelman and Griffith attempted to show how comics connected to the broader realms of artistic and literary culture. &quot;Arcade&quot; lasted seven issues, from 1975 to 1976.

Autobiographical comics began to come into prominence in 1976, with the premiere of Harvey Pekar&#x27;s self-published comic &quot;American Splendor&quot;, which featured art by several cartoonists associated with the underground, including Crumb. Comics critic Jared Gardner asserts that, while underground comix was associated with countercultural iconoclasm, the movement&#x27;s most enduring legacy was to be autobiography.

In the late 1970s, Marvel and DC Comics agreed to sell their comics on a no-return basis with large discounts to comic book retailers; this led to later deals that helped underground publishers. During this period, underground titles focusing on feminist and Gay Liberation themes began to appear, as well as comics associated with the environmental movement. &quot;Anarchy Comics&quot; focused on left-wing politics, while Barney Steel&#x27;s &quot;Armageddon&quot; focused on anarcho-capitalism. British underground cartoonists also created political titles, but they did not sell as well as American political comics.

Artists influenced by the underground comix scene, who were unable to get work published by better-known underground publications, began self-publishing their own small press, photocopied comic books, known as minicomics. The punk subculture began to influence underground comix.

====1982–present====
In 1982, the distribution of underground comix changed through the emergence of specialty stores.

In response to attempts by mainstream publishers to appeal to adult audiences, alternative comics emerged, focusing on many of the same themes as underground comix, as well as publishing experimental work. Artists formally in the underground comix scene began to associate themselves with alternative comics, including Crumb, Deitch, Griffith, Lynda Barry, and Justin Green.

In the 1980s, sexual comics came into prominence, integrating sex into storylines rather than utilizing sexual explicitness for shock value. The first of these features was &quot;Omaha the Cat Dancer&quot;, which made its first appearance in an issue of the zine &quot;Vootie&quot;. Inspired by &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;, &quot;Omaha the Cat Dancer&quot; focused on an anthropomorphic feline stripper. Other comix with a sexual focus included &quot;Melody&quot;, based on the life story of Sylvie Rancourt and &quot;Cherry&quot;, a comedic sex comic featuring art similar in style to that of &quot;Archie Comics&quot;.

In 1985, Griffith&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Zippy the Pinhead&quot; — which originally appeared in underground titles — was syndicated as a daily feature by King Features. Between 1980 and 1991 Spiegelman&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Maus&quot; was serialized in &quot;Raw&quot;, and published in two volumes in 1986 and 1991. It was followed by an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art and a Pulitzer Prize for Spiegelman in 1992. The novel originated from a three-page story first published in an underground comic, &quot;Funny Aminals&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;], (Apex Novelties, 1972).

Alternative cartoonist Peter Bagge was strongly influenced by underground comics, and was reciprocally admired by Crumb, for whom Bagge edited &quot;Weirdo&quot; magazine in the 1980s; he could be considered part of a &quot;second generation&quot; of underground-type cartoonists, including such notables as Mike Diana, Johnny Ryan, Bob Fingerman, David Heatley, Danny Hellman, Julie Doucet, Jim Woodring, Ivan Brunetti, Gary Leib, Doug Allen, and Ed Piskor. Many of these artists were published by Fantagraphics Books, which was founded in 1977 and through the 1980s and &#x27;90s became a major publisher of alternative and underground cartoonists&#x27; work.

As of the 2010s, reprints of early underground comix continue to sell alongside modern underground publications.

The 2010s &quot;Foreskin Man&quot;, a comic book published to protest against circumcision, has been referred to as &quot;comix&quot; by some reviewers.

===United Kingdom===

British cartoonists were introduced in the underground publications &quot;International Times&quot; (&quot;IT&quot;), founded in 1966, and &quot;Oz&quot; founded in 1967, which reprinted some American material. During a visit to London, American comics artist Larry Hama created original material for &quot;IT&quot;.

The first UK comix mag was &quot;Cyclops&quot;, started in July 1970 by &quot;IT&quot; staff members. In a bid to alleviate its ongoing financial problems, &quot;IT&quot; brought out &quot;Nasty Tales&quot; (1971), which was soon prosecuted for obscenity. Despite appearing before the censorious Old Bailey Judge Alan King-Hamilton, the publishers were acquitted by the jury.

In the wake of its own high-profile obscenity trial, &quot;Oz&quot; launched &quot;cOZmic Comics&quot; in 1972, printing a mixture of new British underground strips and old American work. When &quot;Oz&quot; closed down the following year &quot;cOZmic Comics&quot; was continued by fledgling media tycoon Felix Dennis and his company, Cozmic Comics/H. Bunch Associates, which published from 1972 to 1975.

While the American underground comix scene was beginning to decline, the British scene came into prominence between 1973 and 1974, but soon faced the same kind of criticism that American underground comix received. UK-based underground cartoonists included Chris Welch, Edward Barker, Michael J. Weller, Malcolm Livingstone, William Rankin (aka Wyndham Raine), Dave Gibbons, Joe Petagno, Bryan Talbot, and the team of Martin Sudden, Jay Jeff Jones and Brian Bolland.

The last UK underground comix series of note was &quot;Brainstorm Comix&quot; (1975–1978), which featured only original British strips (mostly by Bryan Talbot).

Hassle Free Press was founded in London in 1975 by Tony and Carol Bennett as a publisher and distributor of underground books and comics. Now known as Knockabout Comics, the company has a long-standing relationship with underground comix pioneers Gilbert Shelton and Robert Crumb, as well as British creators like Hunt Emerson and Bryan Talbot. Knockabout has frequently suffered from prosecutions from UK customs, who have seized work by creators such as Crumb and Melinda Gebbie, claiming it to be obscene.

The 1990s witnessed a renaissance in the genre in the United Kingdom, through titles like &quot;Brain Damage&quot;, &quot;Viz&quot;, and others.

==Archives==
After the death of King Features Syndicate editor Jay Kennedy, his personal underground comix collection was acquired by the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum in Ohio.

The University of California, Berkeley&#x27;s Bancroft Library has a large underground comix collection, especially related to Bay Area publications; much of it was built by a deposit account at Gary Arlington&#x27;s San Francisco Comic Book Store. The collection also includes titles from New York, Los Angeles, and elsewhere.

The Rhode Island School of Design&#x27;s Fleet Library acquired a thousand-item collection of underground comix through a donation by Bill Adler in 2021.

<doc id="92539" wikidata="Q1440194" url="?curid=92539" title="Three Coins in the Fountain (film)">
<text>Three Coins in the Fountain is a 1954 American romantic comedy drama film directed by Jean Negulesco from a screenplay by John Patrick, based on the 1952 novel &quot;Coins in the Fountain&quot; by John H. Secondari. It stars Clifton Webb, Dorothy McGuire, Jean Peters, Louis Jourdan, and Maggie McNamara, with Rossano Brazzi, Howard St. John, Kathryn Givney, and Cathleen Nesbitt. The film follows three American women working in Rome who dream of finding romance in the Eternal City. It was originally titled &quot;We Believe in Love&quot;.

The film&#x27;s main title song &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot;, sung by an uncredited Frank Sinatra, went on to become an enduring standard. The film was made in Italy during the &quot;Hollywood on the Tiber&quot; era.

At the 27th Academy Awards in 1955, the film received two Academy Awards—for Best Cinematography and Best Song—and was nominated for Best Picture.

==Plot==

Young American secretary Maria Williams arrives in Rome and is greeted by Anita Hutchins, the woman whom she is replacing at the United States Distribution Agency. They drive to the Villa Eden, which Anita shares with Frances, the longtime secretary of American author John Frederick Shadwell, an expatriate living in Rome. On their way into town, the three women stop at the Trevi Fountain. Frances and Anita tell Maria that according to legend, if she throws a coin in the fountain and makes a wish to return to Rome, she will. Maria and Frances throw in their coins, while Anita, who is planning to return to the United States to marry, declines.

Anita takes Maria to the agency and introduces her to Giorgio Bianchi, a translator. Maria senses that Anita and Giorgio are attracted to each other, though Anita states that the agency forbids its American and Italian employees to fraternize. Later that evening at a party, Maria becomes smitten with the handsome Prince Dino di Cessi, despite being warned by Frances and Anita of his reputation as a womanizer who is notorious for taking his girlfriends to Venice for romantic trysts. Dino charms Maria, telling her to ignore what she has heard about him.

Walking home after the party, Anita confesses to Maria that she has no fiancé but believes she has a better chance of finding a husband in the United States, since wealthy Italian men are not interested in mere secretaries, and the men who are interested are too poor. They later encounter Giorgio, who invites Anita to attend a celebration with him at his family&#x27;s country farm the next day. Anita reluctantly agrees.

The next morning, as Giorgio picks Anita up in his cousin&#x27;s dilapidated truck, they are spotted by her boss, Burgoyne. On Giorgio&#x27;s family farm, Giorgio tells Anita that he hopes to become a lawyer, despite his poverty. The couple later give in to their attraction and they kiss. Meanwhile, back at the apartment, Dino asks if Maria will accompany him to Venice. Desiring to see Venice but not wanting to lose Dino&#x27;s respect, Maria arranges for Frances to chaperone them—to Dino&#x27;s disappointment.

At the agency on Monday, Burgoyne questions Maria about Anita&#x27;s weekend with Giorgio, and although she maintains that Anita did nothing wrong, Burgoyne assumes Anita is having an affair with Giorgio. The following day, he fires Giorgio. Anita blames Maria for betraying her confidence and insists on moving out of their apartment. She visits Giorgio, worried that she might have ruined his chances of becoming a lawyer. Giorgio has no regrets.

Determined to win Dino&#x27;s affections, Maria collects information about his interests and preferences, including his love of modern art and his favorite food and wine. She also lies about being &quot;three-quarters Italian&quot;. Beguiled by how much he apparently has in common with Maria, Dino introduces her to his mother, the Principessa, who expresses her approval. When Dino confides in Maria that his mother is the only woman whom he has ever completely trusted, she confesses her subterfuge, showing Dino her notebook listing his interests. He angrily takes her home.

Frances meets Anita, who admits that she and Giorgio are in love but will not marry because he is too poor. Frances returns home to comfort the guilt-stricken Maria, who also plans to leave Rome because Dino has not contacted her since her admission. The next morning, Frances suddenly announces to Shadwell that she is returning to the United States, not wanting to end up as an old maid in a foreign country. Shadwell, unaware that Frances has been in love with him for 15 years, offers her a marriage of convenience based on mutual respect, which she accepts.

The next day, Shadwell learns that he is terminally ill and has less than a year to live unless he goes to the US for experimental treatment. Shadwell returns to his villa and coldly ends his engagement to Frances. After learning from Shadwell&#x27;s doctor the truth about his condition, Frances follows him to a café, where they drown their sorrows while bickering about whether he should pursue treatment. After taking an intoxicated Frances back to the villa, Shadwell visits Dino and informs him that he is leaving for the United States, where he will marry Frances. Shadwell uses reverse psychology to convince Dino that he loves Maria.

After Anita and Maria are packed and ready to leave, Frances telephones and asks to meet them at the Trevi Fountain. There, Maria and Anita are disappointed to see the fountain emptied for cleaning. When they are joined by Frances, however, the water springs up again, much to the women&#x27;s excitement. Dino and Giorgio arrive, and as the men embrace their respective girlfriends, Frances is joined by Shadwell, and they happily admire the fountain.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Upon its theatrical release, the film received generally positive reviews, particularly for its color and CinemaScope widescreen cinematography of Italian filming locations. In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther wrote, &quot;&quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot; is quite clearly a film in which the locale comes first. However, the nonsense of its fable tumbles nicely within the picture frame.&quot; Crowther underscored the film&#x27;s visual appeal to the audiences of his time.
&quot;Variety&quot; noted that the film &quot;has warmth, humor, a rich dose of romance and almost incredible pictorial appeal.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 60% based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9 out of 10.

==Awards and nominations==
The film was recognized by the American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2002: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – Nominated
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot; (song) – Nominated

==Remakes==
Three other films based on the same novel have been released. The first was the 1964 musical &quot;The Pleasure Seekers&quot; starring Ann-Margret, Carol Lynley and Pamela Tiffin, directed by Jean Negulesco. The second was a 1966 20th Century Fox pilot for an unsold television series, which was directed by Hal Kanter, written by Kanter and Melville Shavelson and starred Cynthia Pepper, Yvonne Craig and Joanna Moore. The television film was finally broadcast in 1970. Sergio Franchi sang the title song. The third was the 1990 television film &quot;Coins in the Fountain&quot; starring Loni Anderson.

&quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot; also inspired the 2010 film &quot;When in Rome&quot;, which tells the story of a woman who takes coins from a love fountain in Rome and finds unwanted love.

<doc id="92540" wikidata="Q714941" url="?curid=92540" title="Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing (film)">
<text>Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing is a 1955 Deluxe color American drama-romance film in CinemaScope. Set in 1949–50 in Hong Kong, it tells the story of a married, but separated, American reporter Mark Elliot (played by William Holden), who falls in love with a Eurasian doctor originally from China, Han Suyin (played by Jennifer Jones), only to encounter prejudice from her family and from Hong Kong society.

The film was adapted by John Patrick from the 1952 autobiographical novel &quot;A Many-Splendoured Thing&quot; by Han Suyin. The film was directed by Henry King.

The film later inspired a television soap opera in 1967, though without the hyphen in the show&#x27;s title.

==Plot==
A widowed Eurasian doctor Han Suyin (Jones) falls in love with a married-but-separated American correspondent Mark Elliott (Holden) in Hong Kong, during the period of China&#x27;s Civil War in the late 1940s. Although they find brief happiness together, she is ostracized by the greater Chinese community. After losing her position at the hospital, Suyin and her adopted daughter go to live with a friend while Mark is on an assignment during the Korean War. They write to each other constantly. She receives word that Mark was killed and she goes to visit their favorite hilltop meeting place. In his last letter, which she receives that same day, he reminds her to be grateful, no matter what happens to him, because they got to experience “that many-splendored thing” which many people never do.

==Cast==

* William Holden as Mark Elliott
* Jennifer Jones as Dr. Han Suyin
* Torin Thatcher as Humphrey Palmer-Jones
* Isobel Elsom as Adeline Palmer-Jones
* Murray Matheson as Dr. John Keith
* Virginia Gregg as Anne Richards
* Richard Loo as Robert Hung
* Soo Yong as Nora Hung
* Philip Ahn as Third Uncle
* Jorja Curtright as Suzanne
* Donna Martell as Suchen, Suyin&#x27;s sister
* James Hong (uncredited)
* Keye Luke (uncredited)
* J. Cabin Joe (uncredited)

==Production==
The rights to the novel were bought by David Brown of 20th Century Fox for the producer Sol C. Siegel. However, when he left the company the project was given to Buddy Adler. The screenplay struggled to get Motion Picture Production Code approval because of its themes of adultery and miscegenation.

Parts of the film were shot on location in Hong Kong by second-unit director Otto Lang, which was unusual for its time. Two weeks of location filming in Hong Kong had been completed before the final screenplay had been finished by screenwriter John Patrick. He then had to adapt the screenplay to include as many of the shots as possible.

Despite the film&#x27;s romantic subject and their chemistry on the screen, Holden and Jones could barely stand each other on set. Holden was turned off by Jones&#x27;s obsessive involvement with her character and complaints about her makeup (which she said made her &quot;look old&quot;), about her costumes and about her dialogue. Soon, they were barely speaking to one another. According to Holden&#x27;s biography, Jones was also generally rude and abrasive to everyone involved in the production.
Their relationship was also not helped by Jones&#x27;s worries about Holden&#x27;s reputation as a womanizer. Holden claimed that she chewed garlic before her love scenes, which she may have done to discourage him. Once, Holden tried to make peace, offering Jones a bouquet of white roses, which she tossed back in his face.

The film was completed on time, within the planned three-months schedule. Indonesian director, J. Cabin Joe, made an uncredited role in the film where he appeared along with Holden.

* The former colonial-style Repulse Bay Hotel, demolished in 1982, and now the site of The Repulse Bay apartment building.
* The Tai Pak Floating Restaurant, now part of the Jumbo Kingdom.
* The famous hill-top meeting place where the lovers used to meet was filmed in rural California at Fox Ranch Malibu, and the backdrop was filmed in Repulse Bay, Hong Kong.

==Reception==
&quot;Variety&quot; characterized it as &quot;beautiful, absorbing.&quot;

The film earned rentals of $4 million in the United States of America and Canada.

In Ireland and the Canadian province of Quebec, local censors did not like the suggestions of divorce and cut the film to make it appear that Holden was single.

==Awards and nominations==
* In 2002, the film ranked #85 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Passions.

==Soundtrack==

The music was commissioned from Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster as background music. It was extensively developed and woven into the film&#x27;s orchestral score by Alfred Newman and his choral director Ken Darby. To make it eligible for the Best Original Song category of the Academy Awards lyrics were subsequently added. The original lyrics were rejected by the studio so new ones were written. The resulting sentimental and upbeat song, &quot;Love is a Many-Splendored Thing&quot; was one of the first songs written for a movie to reach No. 1 in the charts in the same year.

The song was subsequently recorded by The Four Aces and also by Jerry Vale, Nat King Cole, Danny Williams, and Frank Sinatra, among others. Italian-language versions were recorded by Nancy Cuomo, Neil Sedaka, and Connie Francis. Francis also recorded the song with its original English lyrics, and a German-language version, &quot;Sag, weißt du denn, was Liebe ist&quot;.

The song&#x27;s lyrics relate:

During the film, charged romantic moments occur on a high grassy, windswept hill in Hong Kong. In the bittersweet final scene on the hilltop, the song (heard on the sound track) recalls the earlier encounters:

The theme song won the Academy Award for Best Song, and the recording by The Four Aces went to #1 on the charts for three weeks in 1955, shortly before rock and roll became a dominant force on the charts. Newman&#x27;s orchestral score, which made heavy use of Fain&#x27;s tune, also received an Oscar.

Varèse Sarabande made the complete original soundtrack available on compact disc in 2002, limiting the pressing to 2,000 copies.

<doc id="92542" wikidata="Q2307579" url="?curid=92542" title="Camazotz">
<text>In the Late Post-Classic Maya mythology of the Popol Vuh, Camazotz ( from Mayan ) (alternate spellings Cama-Zotz, Sotz, Zotz) is a bat spirit at the service of the lords of the underworld. Camazotz means &quot;death bat&quot; in the Kʼicheʼ language. In Mesoamerica generally, the bat is often associated with night, death, and sacrifice.

==Etymology==
Camazotz is formed from the Kʼicheʼ words &quot;kame&quot;, meaning &quot;death&quot;, and &quot;sotz&quot;&#x27;, meaning &quot;bat&quot;.

==Mythology==
In the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, Camazotz are the bat-like spirits encountered by the Maya Hero Twins Hunahpu and Xbalanque during their trials in the underworld of Xibalba. The twins had to spend the night in the House of Bats, where they squeezed themselves into their own blowguns in order to defend themselves from the circling bats. Hunahpu stuck his head out of his blowgun to see if the sun had risen and Camazotz immediately snatched off his head and carried it to the ballcourt to be hung up as the ball to be used by the gods in their next ballgame.

== Classic Period (200–900 CE) ==
In Classic Maya iconography, the (leaf-nosed) bat, exhaling unhealthy vapours, is often depicted as a person&#x27;s nahual or way-spirit bringing disease over an enemy. However, the Classic bat spirit is rarely, if ever, part of a narrative context, nor does it appear to play the role assigned to it by the Popol Vuh.

<doc id="92550" wikidata="Q35900" url="?curid=92550" title="Omar Khayyam">
<text>Ghiyāth al-Dīn Abū al-Fatḥ ʿUmar ibn Ibrāhīm Nīshābūrī (18 May 1048 – 4 December 1131) (Persian: غیاث الدین ابوالفتح عمر بن ابراهیم خیام نیشابورﻯ), commonly known as Omar Khayyam (), was a polymath, known for his contributions to mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, and poetry. He was born in Nishapur, the initial capital of the Seljuk Empire, and lived during the period of the Seljuk dynasty, around the time of the First Crusade.

As a mathematician, he is most notable for his work on the classification and solution of cubic equations, where he provided a geometric formulation based on the intersection of conics. He also contributed to a deeper understanding of Euclid&#x27;s parallel axiom. As an astronomer, he calculated the duration of the solar year with remarkable precision and accuracy, and designed the Jalali calendar, a solar calendar with a very precise 33-year intercalation cycle
 which provided the basis for the Persian calendar that is still in use after nearly a millennium.

There is a tradition of attributing poetry to Omar Khayyam, written in the form of quatrains (&quot;rubāʿiyāt&quot; ). This poetry became widely known to the English-reading world in a translation by Edward FitzGerald (&quot;Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot;, 1859), which enjoyed great success in the Orientalism of the &quot;fin de siècle&quot;.

==Life==
Omar Khayyam was born in Nishapur—a metropolis in Khorasan province, of Persian stock, in 1048. In medieval Persian texts he is usually simply called &quot;Omar Khayyam&quot;. Although open to doubt, it has often been assumed that his forebears followed the trade of tent-making, since &quot;Khayyam&quot; means &#x27;tent-maker&#x27; in Arabic. The historian Bayhaqi, who was personally acquainted with Khayyam, provides the full details of his horoscope: &quot;he was Gemini, the sun and Mercury being in the ascendant[...]&quot;. This was used by modern scholars to establish his date of birth as 18 May 1048.

Khayyam&#x27;s boyhood was spent in Nishapur, a leading metropolis in the Seljuk Empire, which had earlier been a major center of the Zoroastrian religion. His full name, as it appears in Arabic sources, was &quot;Abu’l Fath Omar ibn Ibrahim al-Khayyam&quot;. His gifts were recognized by his early tutors who sent him to study under Imam Muwaffaq Nishaburi, the greatest teacher of the Khorasan region who tutored the children of the highest nobility, and Khayyam developed a firm friendship with him through the years. Khayyam might have met and studied with Bahmanyar, a disciple of Avicenna. After studying science, philosophy, mathematics and astronomy at Nishapur, about the year 1068 he traveled to the province of Bukhara, where he frequented the renowned library of the Ark. In about 1070 he moved to Samarkand, where he started to compose his famous &quot;Treatise on Algebra&quot; under the patronage of Abu Tahir Abd al-Rahman ibn ʿAlaq, the governor and chief judge of the city. Khayyam was kindly received by the Karakhanid ruler Shams al-Mulk Nasr, who according to Bayhaqi, would &quot;show him the greatest honour, so much so that he would seat [Khayyam] beside him on his throne&quot;.

In 1073–4 peace was concluded with Sultan Malik-Shah I who had made incursions into Karakhanid dominions. Khayyam entered the service of Malik-Shah in 1074 when he was invited by the Grand Vizier Nizam al-Mulk to meet Malik-Shah in the city of Marv. Khayyam was subsequently commissioned to set up an observatory in Isfahan and lead a group of scientists in carrying out precise astronomical observations aimed at the revision of the Persian calendar. The undertaking probably began with the opening of the observatory in 1074 and ended in 1079, when Omar Khayyam and his colleagues concluded their measurements of the length of the year, reporting it as 365.24219858156 days. Given that the length of the year is changing in the sixth decimal place over a person&#x27;s lifetime, this is outstandingly accurate. For comparison, the length of the year at the end of the 19th century was 365.242196 days, while today it is 365.242190 days.

After the death of Malik-Shah and his vizier (murdered, it is thought, by the Ismaili order of Assassins), Khayyam fell from favor at court, and as a result, he soon set out on his pilgrimage to Mecca. A possible ulterior motive for his pilgrimage reported by Al-Qifti, was a public demonstration of his faith with a view to allaying suspicions of skepticism and confuting the allegations of unorthodoxy (including possible sympathy or adherence to Zoroastrianism) levelled at him by a hostile clergy. He was then invited by the new Sultan Sanjar to Marv, possibly to work as a court astrologer. He was later allowed to return to Nishapur owing to his declining health. Upon his return, he seems to have lived the life of a recluse.

Omar Khayyam died at the age of 83 in his hometown of Nishapur on 4 December 1131, and he is buried in what is now the Mausoleum of Omar Khayyam. One of his disciples Nizami Aruzi relates the story that sometime during 1112–3 Khayyam was in Balkh in the company of Isfizari (one of the scientists who had collaborated with him on the Jalali calendar) when he made a prophecy that &quot;my tomb shall be in a spot where the north wind may scatter roses over it&quot;. Four years after his death, Aruzi located his tomb in a cemetery in a then large and well-known quarter of Nishapur on the road to Marv. As it had been foreseen by Khayyam, Aruzi found the tomb situated at the foot of a garden-wall over which pear trees and apricot trees had thrust their heads and dropped their flowers so that his tombstone was hidden beneath them.

==Mathematics==

Khayyam was famous during his life as a mathematician. His surviving mathematical works include 

* (i) &quot;Commentary on the Difficulties Concerning the Postulates of Euclid&#x27;s Elements&quot; (), completed in December 1077, 
* (ii) &quot;Treatise On the Division of a Quadrant of a Circle&quot; (), undated but completed prior to the &quot;Treatise on Algebra&quot;, and 
* (iii) &quot;Treatise on Algebra&quot; (), most likely completed in 1079. 

He furthermore wrote a treatise on the binomial theorem and extracting the nth root of natural numbers, which has been lost.

===Theory of parallels===
Part of Khayyam&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on the Difficulties Concerning the Postulates of Euclid&#x27;s Elements&quot; deals with the parallel axiom. The treatise of Khayyam can be considered the first treatment of the axiom not based on petitio principii, but on a more intuitive postulate. Khayyam refutes the previous attempts by other mathematicians to &quot;prove&quot; the proposition, mainly on grounds that each of them had postulated something that was by no means easier to admit than the Fifth Postulate itself. Drawing upon Aristotle&#x27;s views, he rejects the usage of movement in geometry and therefore dismisses the different attempt by Ibn al-Haytham. Unsatisfied with the failure of mathematicians to prove Euclid&#x27;s statement from his other postulates, Khayyam tried to connect the axiom with the Fourth Postulate, which states that all right angles are equal to one another.

Khayyam was the first to consider the three distinct cases of acute, obtuse, and right angle for the summit angles of a Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral. After proving a number of theorems about them, he showed that Postulate V follows from the right angle hypothesis, and refuted the obtuse and acute cases as self-contradictory. His elaborate attempt to prove the parallel postulate was significant for the further development of geometry, as it clearly shows the possibility of non-Euclidean geometries. The hypotheses of acute, obtuse, and right angles are now known to lead respectively to the non-Euclidean hyperbolic geometry of Gauss-Bolyai-Lobachevsky, to that of Riemannian geometry, and to Euclidean geometry.

Tusi&#x27;s commentaries on Khayyam&#x27;s treatment of parallels made their way to Europe. John Wallis, professor of geometry at Oxford, translated Tusi&#x27;s commentary into Latin. Jesuit geometer Girolamo Saccheri, whose work (&quot;euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus&quot;, 1733) is generally considered the first step in the eventual development of non-Euclidean geometry, was familiar with the work of Wallis. The American historian of mathematics David Eugene Smith mentions that Saccheri &quot;used the same lemma as the one of Tusi, even lettering the figure in precisely the same way and using the lemma for the same purpose&quot;. He further says that &quot;Tusi distinctly states that it is due to Omar Khayyam, and from the text, it seems clear that the latter was his inspirer.&quot;

====Real number concept====

This treatise on Euclid contains another contribution dealing with the theory of proportions and with the compounding of ratios. Khayyam discusses the relationship between the concept of ratio and the concept of number and explicitly raises various theoretical difficulties. In particular, he contributes to the theoretical study of the concept of irrational number. Displeased with Euclid&#x27;s definition of equal ratios, he redefined the concept of a number by the use of a continued fraction as the means of expressing a ratio. Youschkevitch and Rosenfeld argue that &quot;by placing irrational quantities and numbers on the same operational scale, [Khayyam] began a true revolution in the doctrine of number.&quot; Likewise, it was noted by D. J. Struik that Omar was &quot;on the road to that extension of the number concept which leads to the notion of the real number.&quot;

===Geometric algebra===
Rashed and Vahabzadeh (2000) have argued that because of his thoroughgoing geometrical approach to algebraic equations, Khayyam can be considered the precursor of Descartes in the invention of analytic geometry. In the &quot;Treatise on the Division of a Quadrant of a Circle&quot; Khayyam applied algebra to geometry. In this work, he devoted himself mainly to investigating whether it is possible to divide a circular quadrant into two parts such that the line segments projected from the dividing point to the perpendicular diameters of the circle form a specific ratio. His solution, in turn, employed several curve constructions that led to equations containing cubic and quadratic terms.

====Solution of cubic equations====

Khayyam seems to have been the first to conceive a general theory of cubic equations, and the first to geometrically solve every type of cubic equation, so far as positive roots are concerned. The &quot;Treatise on Algebra&quot; contains his work on cubic equations. It is divided into three parts: (i) equations which can be solved with compass and straight edge, (ii) equations which can be solved by means of conic sections, and (iii) equations which involve the inverse of the unknown.

Khayyam produced an exhaustive list of all possible equations involving lines, squares, and cubes. He considered three binomial equations, nine trinomial equations, and seven tetranomial equations. For the first and second degree polynomials, he provided numerical solutions by geometric construction. He concluded that there are fourteen different types of cubics that cannot be reduced to an equation of a lesser degree. For these he could not accomplish the construction of his unknown segment with compass and straight edge. He proceeded to present geometric solutions to all types of cubic equations using the properties of conic sections. The prerequisite lemmas for Khayyam&#x27;s geometrical proof include Euclid VI, Prop 13, and Apollonius II, Prop 12. The positive root of a cubic equation was determined as the abscissa of a point of intersection of two conics, for instance, the intersection of two parabolas, or the intersection of a parabola and a circle, etc. However, he acknowledged that the arithmetic problem of these cubics was still unsolved, adding that &quot;possibly someone else will come to know it after us&quot;. This task remained open until the sixteenth century, where an algebraic solution of the cubic equation was found in its generality by Cardano, Del Ferro, and Tartaglia in Renaissance Italy.

In effect, Khayyam&#x27;s work is an effort to unify algebra and geometry. This particular geometric solution of cubic equations was further investigated by M. Hachtroudi and extended to solving fourth-degree equations. Although similar methods had appeared sporadically since Menaechmus, and further developed by the 10th-century mathematician Abu al-Jud, Khayyam&#x27;s work can be considered the first systematic study and the first exact method of solving cubic equations. The mathematician Woepcke (1851) who offered translations of Khayyam&#x27;s algebra into French praised him for his &quot;power of generalization and his rigorously systematic procedure.&quot;

===Binomial theorem and extraction of roots===


In his algebraic treatise, Khayyam alludes to a book he had written on the extraction of the formula_1th root of natural numbers using a law he had discovered which did not depend on geometric figures. This book was most likely titled the &quot;Difficulties of Arithmetic&quot; (), and is not extant. Based on the context, some historians of mathematics such as D. J. Struik, believe that Omar must have known the formula for the expansion of the binomial formula_2, where is a positive integer. The case of power 2 is explicitly stated in Euclid&#x27;s elements and the case of at most power 3 had been established by Indian mathematicians. Khayyam was the mathematician who noticed the importance of a general binomial theorem. The argument supporting the claim that Khayyam had a general binomial theorem is based on his ability to extract roots. One of Khayyam&#x27;s predecessors, al-Karaji, had already discovered the triangular arrangement of the coefficients of binomial expansions that Europeans later came to know as Pascal&#x27;s triangle; Khayyam popularized this triangular array in Iran, so that it is now known as Omar Khayyam&#x27;s triangle.

==Astronomy==

In 1074–5, Omar Khayyam was commissioned by Sultan Malik-Shah to build an observatory at Isfahan and reform the Persian calendar. There was a panel of eight scholars working under the direction of Khayyam to make large-scale astronomical observations and revise the astronomical tables. Recalibrating the calendar fixed the first day of the year at the exact moment of the passing of the Sun&#x27;s center across vernal equinox. This marks the beginning of spring or Nowrūz, a day in which the Sun enters the first degree of Aries before noon. The resultant calendar was named in Malik-Shah&#x27;s honor as the Jalālī calendar, and was inaugurated on 15 March 1079. The observatory itself was disused after the death of Malik-Shah in 1092.

The Jalālī calendar was a true solar calendar where the duration of each month is equal to the time of the passage of the Sun across the corresponding sign of the Zodiac. The calendar reform introduced a unique 33-year intercalation cycle. As indicated by the works of Khazini, Khayyam&#x27;s group implemented an intercalation system based on quadrennial and quinquennial leap years. Therefore, the calendar consisted of 25 ordinary years that included 365 days, and 8 leap years that included 366 days. The calendar remained in use across Greater Iran from the 11th to the 20th centuries. In 1911 the Jalali calendar became the official national calendar of Qajar Iran. In 1925 this calendar was simplified and the names of the months were modernised, resulting in the modern Iranian calendar. The Jalali calendar is more accurate than the Gregorian calendar of 1582, with an error of one day accumulating over 5,000 years, compared to one day every 3,330 years in the Gregorian calendar. Moritz Cantor considered it the most perfect calendar ever devised.

One of his pupils Nizami Aruzi of Samarcand relates that Khayyam apparently did not have a belief in astrology and divination: &quot;I did not observe that he (&quot;scil.&quot; Omar Khayyam) had any great belief in astrological predictions, nor have I seen or heard of any of the great [scientists] who had such belief.&quot; While working for Sultan Sanjar as an astrologer he was asked to predict the weather – a job that he apparently did not do well. George Saliba explains that the term , used in various sources in which references to Khayyam&#x27;s life and work could be found, has sometimes been incorrectly translated to mean astrology. He adds: &quot;from at least the middle of the tenth century, according to Farabi&#x27;s &quot;Enumeration of the Sciences&quot;, that this science, , was already split into two parts, one dealing with astrology and the other with theoretical mathematical astronomy.&quot;

==Other works==
Khayyam has a short treatise devoted to Archimedes&#x27; principle (in full title, &quot;On the Deception of Knowing the Two Quantities of Gold and Silver in a Compound Made of the Two&quot;). For a compound of gold adulterated with silver, he describes a method to measure more exactly the weight per capacity of each element. It involves weighing the compound both in air and in water, since weights are easier to measure exactly than volumes. By repeating the same with both gold and silver one finds exactly how much heavier than water gold, silver and the compound were. This treatise was extensively examined by Eilhard Wiedemann who believed that Khayyam&#x27;s solution was more accurate and sophisticated than that of Khazini and Al-Nayrizi who also dealt with the subject elsewhere.

Another short treatise is concerned with music theory in which he discusses the connection between music and arithmetic. Khayyam&#x27;s contribution was in providing a systematic classification of musical scales, and discussing the mathematical relationship among notes, minor, major and tetrachords.

==Poetry==
The earliest allusion to Omar Khayyam&#x27;s poetry is from the historian Imad al-Din al-Isfahani, a younger contemporary of Khayyam, who explicitly identifies him as both a poet and a scientist (, 1174). One of the earliest specimens of Omar Khayyam&#x27;s Rubiyat is from Fakhr al-Din Razi. In his work (), he quotes one of his poems (corresponding to quatrain LXII of FitzGerald&#x27;s first edition). Daya in his writings (, c. 1230) quotes two quatrains, one of which is the same as the one already reported by Razi. An additional quatrain is quoted by the historian Juvayni (, c. 1226–1283). In 1340 Jajarmi includes thirteen quatrains of Khayyam in his work containing an anthology of the works of famous Persian poets (), two of which have hitherto been known from the older sources. A comparatively late manuscript is the Bodleian MS. Ouseley 140, written in Shiraz in 1460, which contains 158 quatrains on 47 folia. The manuscript belonged to William Ouseley (1767–1842) and was purchased by the Bodleian Library in 1844.

There are occasional quotes of verses attributed to Khayyam in texts attributed to authors of the 13th and 14th centuries, but these are of doubtful authenticity, so that skeptical scholars point out that the entire tradition may be pseudepigraphic. Hans Heinrich Schaeder in 1934 commented that the name of Omar Khayyam &quot;is to be struck out from the history of Persian literature&quot; due to the lack of any material that could confidently be attributed to him. De Blois presents a bibliography of the manuscript tradition, concluding pessimistically that the situation has not changed significantly since Schaeder&#x27;s time.:307

Five of the quatrains later attributed to Omar Khayyam are found as early as 30 years after his death, quoted in &quot;Sindbad-Nameh&quot;. While this establishes that these specific verses were in circulation in Omar&#x27;s time or shortly later, it does not imply that the verses must be his. De Blois concludes that at the least the process of attributing poetry to Omar Khayyam appears to have begun already in the 13th century.:305 Edward Granville Browne (1906) notes the difficulty of disentangling authentic from spurious quatrains: &quot;while it is certain that Khayyam wrote many quatrains, it is hardly possible, save in a few exceptional cases, to assert positively that he wrote any of those ascribed to him&quot;.

In addition to the Persian quatrains, there are twenty-five Arabic poems attributed to Khayyam which are attested by historians such as al-Isfahani, Shahrazuri (, c. 1201–1211), Qifti (, 1255), and Hamdallah Mustawfi (, 1339).

Boyle emphasized that there are a number of other Persian scholars who occasionally wrote quatrains, including Avicenna, Ghazali, and Tusi. They conclude that it is also possible that for Khayyam poetry was an amusement of his leisure hours: &quot;these brief poems seem often to have been the work of scholars and scientists who composed them, perhaps, in moments of relaxation to edify or amuse the inner circle of their disciples&quot;.

The poetry attributed to Omar Khayyam has contributed greatly to his popular fame in the modern period as a direct result of the extreme popularity of the translation of such verses into English by Edward FitzGerald (1859). FitzGerald&#x27;s &quot;Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot; contains loose translations of quatrains from the Bodleian manuscript. It enjoyed such success in the fin de siècle period that a bibliography compiled in 1929 listed more than 300 separate editions, and many more have been published since.:312

==Philosophy==
Khayyam considered himself intellectually to be a student of Avicenna. According to Al-Bayhaqi, he was reading the metaphysics in Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;the Book of Healing&quot; before he died. There are six philosophical papers believed to have been written by Khayyam. One of them, &quot;On existence&quot; (), was written originally in Persian and deals with the subject of existence and its relationship to universals. Another paper, titled &quot;The necessity of contradiction in the world, determinism and subsistence&quot; (), is written in Arabic and deals with free will and determinism. The titles of his other works are &quot;On being and necessity&quot; (), &quot;The Treatise on Transcendence in Existence&quot; (), &quot;On the knowledge of the universal principles of existence&quot; (), and &quot;Abridgement concerning natural phenomena&quot; ().

Khayyam himself once said:

===Religious views===

A literal reading of Khayyam&#x27;s quatrains leads to the interpretation of his philosophic attitude toward life as a combination of pessimism, nihilism, Epicureanism, fatalism, and agnosticism. This view is taken by Iranologists such as Arthur Christensen, Hans Heinrich Schaeder, John Andrew Boyle, Edward Denison Ross, Edward Henry Whinfield and George Sarton. Conversely, the Khayyamic quatrains have also been described as mystical Sufi poetry. In addition to his Persian quatrains, J. C. E. Bowen mentions that Khayyam&#x27;s Arabic poems also &quot;express a pessimistic viewpoint which is entirely consonant with the outlook of the deeply thoughtful rationalist philosopher that Khayyam is known historically to have been.&quot; Edward FitzGerald emphasized the religious skepticism he found in Khayyam. In his preface to the &quot;Rubáiyát&quot; he claimed that he &quot;was hated and dreaded by the Sufis&quot;, and denied any pretense at divine allegory: &quot;his Wine is the veritable Juice of the Grape: his Tavern, where it was to be had: his &quot;Saki&quot;, the Flesh and Blood that poured it out for him.&quot; Sadegh Hedayat is one of the most notable proponents of Khayyam&#x27;s philosophy as agnostic skepticism, and according to Jan Rypka (1934), he even considered Khayyam an atheist. Hedayat (1923) states that &quot;while Khayyam believes in the transmutation and transformation of the human body, he does not believe in a separate soul; if we are lucky, our bodily particles would be used in the making of a jug of wine.&quot; Omar Khayyam&#x27;s poetry has been cited in the context of New Atheism, such as in &quot;The Portable Atheist&quot; by Christopher Hitchens.

Al-Qifti () appears to confirm this view of Khayyam&#x27;s philosophy. In his work &quot;The History of Learned Men&quot; he reports that Khayyam&#x27;s poems were only outwardly in the Sufi style, but were written with an anti-religious agenda. He also mentions that he was at one point indicted for impiety, but went on a pilgrimage to prove he was pious. The report has it that upon returning to his native city he concealed his deepest convictions and practised a strictly religious life, going morning and evening to the place of worship. Khayyam on the Koran (quote 84):



An account of him, written in the thirteenth century, shows him as &quot;versed in all the wisdom of the Greeks,&quot; and as wont to insist on the necessity of studying science on Greek lines. Of his prose works, two, which were stand authority, dealt respectively with precious stones and climatology. Beyond question the poet-astronomer was undevout; and his astronomy doubtless helped to make him so. One contemporary writes: &quot;I did not observe that he had any great belief in astrological predictions; nor have I seen or heard of any of the great (scientists) who had such belief. He gave his adherence to no religious sect. Agnosticism, not faith, is the keynote of his works. Among the sects he saw everywhere strife and hatred in which he could have no part...&quot;

Persian novelist Sadegh Hedayat says Khayyám from &quot;his youth to his death remained a materialist, pessimist, agnostic. Khayyam looked at all religions questions with a skeptical eye&quot;, continues Hedayat, &quot;and hated the fanaticism, narrow-mindedness, and the spirit of vengeance of the mullas, the so-called religious scholars.&quot;

In the context of a piece entitled &quot;On the Knowledge of the Principles of Existence&quot;, Khayyam endorses the Sufi path. Csillik suggests the possibility that Omar Khayyam could see in Sufism an ally against orthodox religiosity. Other commentators do not accept that Khayyam&#x27;s poetry has an anti-religious agenda and interpret his references to wine and drunkenness in the conventional metaphorical sense common in Sufism. The French translator J. B. Nicolas held that Khayyam&#x27;s constant exhortations to drink wine should not be taken literally, but should be regarded rather in the light of Sufi thought where rapturous intoxication by &quot;wine&quot; is to be understood as a metaphor for the enlightened state or divine rapture of &quot;baqaa&quot;. The view of Omar Khayyam as a Sufi was defended by Bjerregaard, Idries Shah, and Dougan who attributes the reputation of hedonism to the failings of FitzGerald&#x27;s translation, arguing that Khayyam&#x27;s poetry is to be understood as &quot;deeply esoteric&quot;. On the other hand, Iranian experts such as Mohammad Ali Foroughi and Mojtaba Minovi rejected the hypothesis that Omar Khayyam was a Sufi. Foroughi stated that Khayyam&#x27;s ideas may have been consistent with that of Sufis at times but there is no evidence that he was formally a Sufi. Aminrazavi states that &quot;Sufi interpretation of Khayyam is possible only by reading into his &quot;Rubāʿīyyāt&quot; extensively and by stretching the content to fit the classical Sufi doctrine.&quot;. Furthermore, Boyle emphasizes that Khayyam was intensely disliked by a number of celebrated Sufi mystics who belonged to the same century. This includes Shams Tabrizi (spiritual guide of Rumi), Najm al-Din Daya who described Omar Khayyam as &quot;an unhappy philosopher, atheist, and materialist&quot;, and Attar who regarded him not as a fellow-mystic but a free-thinking scientist who awaited punishments hereafter.

Seyyed Hossein Nasr argues that it is &quot;reductive&quot; to use a literal interpretation of his verses (many of which are of uncertain authenticity to begin with) to establish Omar Khayyam&#x27;s philosophy. Instead, he adduces Khayyam&#x27;s interpretive translation of Avicenna&#x27;s treatise &quot;Discourse on Unity&quot; (), where he expresses orthodox views on Divine Unity in agreement with the author. The prose works believed to be Khayyam&#x27;s are written in the Peripatetic style and are explicitly theistic, dealing with subjects such as the existence of God and theodicy. As noted by Bowen these works indicate his involvement in the problems of metaphysics rather than in the subtleties of Sufism. As evidence of Khayyam&#x27;s faith and/or conformity to Islamic customs, Aminrazavi mentions that in his treatises he offers salutations and prayers, praising God and Muhammad. In most biographical extracts, he is referred to with religious honorifics such as , &quot;The Patron of Faith&quot; (), and &quot;The Evidence of Truth&quot; (). He also notes that biographers who praise his religiosity generally avoid making reference to his poetry, while the ones who mention his poetry often do not praise his religious character. For instance, Al-Bayhaqi&#x27;s account, which antedates by some years other biographical notices, speaks of Omar as a very pious man who professed orthodox views down to his last hour.

On the basis of all the existing textual and biographical evidence, the question remains somewhat open, and as a result Khayyam has received sharply conflicting appreciations and criticisms.

==Reception==

The various biographical extracts referring to Omar Khayyam describe him as unequalled in scientific knowledge and achievement during his time. Many called him by the epithet &quot;King of the Wise&quot; (). Shahrazuri (d. 1300) esteems him highly as a mathematician, and claims that he may be regarded as &quot;the successor of Avicenna in the various branches of philosophic learning&quot;. Al-Qifti (d. 1248), even though disagreeing with his views, concedes he was &quot;unrivalled in his knowledge of natural philosophy and astronomy&quot;. Despite being hailed as a poet by a number of biographers, according to John Andrew Boyle &quot;it is still possible to argue that Khayyam&#x27;s status as a poet of the first rank is a comparatively late development.&quot;

Thomas Hyde was the first European to call attention to Khayyam and to translate one of his quatrains into Latin (&quot;Historia religionis veterum Persarum eorumque magorum&quot;, 1700). Western interest in Persia grew with the Orientalism movement in the 19th century. Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall (1774–1856) translated some of Khayyam&#x27;s poems into German in 1818, and Gore Ouseley (1770–1844) into English in 1846, but Khayyam remained relatively unknown in the West until after the publication of Edward FitzGerald&#x27;s &quot;Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot; in 1859. FitzGerald&#x27;s work at first was unsuccessful but was popularised by Whitley Stokes from 1861 onward, and the work came to be greatly admired by the Pre-Raphaelites. In 1872 FitzGerald had a third edition printed which increased interest in the work in America. By the 1880s, the book was extremely well known throughout the English-speaking world, to the extent of the formation of numerous &quot;Omar Khayyam Clubs&quot; and a &quot;fin de siècle cult of the Rubaiyat&quot;. Khayyam&#x27;s poems have been translated into many languages; many of the more recent ones are more literal than that of FitzGerald.

FitzGerald&#x27;s translation was a factor in rekindling interest in Khayyam as a poet even in his native Iran. Sadegh Hedayat in his &quot;Songs of Khayyam&quot; (&quot;Taranehha-ye Khayyam&quot;, 1934) reintroduced Khayyam&#x27;s poetic legacy to modern Iran. Under the Pahlavi dynasty, a new monument of white marble, designed by the architect Houshang Seyhoun, was erected over his tomb. A statue by Abolhassan Sadighi was erected in Laleh Park, Tehran in the 1960s, and a bust by the same sculptor was placed near Khayyam&#x27;s mausoleum in Nishapur. In 2009, the state of Iran donated a pavilion to the United Nations Office in Vienna, inaugurated at Vienna International Center. In 2016, three statues of Khayyam were unveiled: one at the University of Oklahoma, one in Nishapur and one in Florence, Italy. Over 150 composers have used the &quot;Rubaiyat&quot; as their source of inspiration. The earliest such composer was Liza Lehmann.

FitzGerald rendered Khayyam&#x27;s name as &quot;Tentmaker&quot;, and the anglicized name of &quot;Omar the Tentmaker&quot; resonated in English-speaking popular culture for a while. Thus, Nathan Haskell Dole published a novel called &quot;Omar, the Tentmaker: A Romance of Old Persia&quot; in 1898. &quot;Omar the Tentmaker of Naishapur&quot; is a historical novel by John Smith Clarke, published in 1910. &quot;Omar the Tentmaker&quot; is also the title of a 1914 play by Richard Walton Tully in an oriental setting, adapted as a silent film in 1922. US General Omar Bradley was given the nickname &quot;Omar the Tent-Maker&quot; in World War II.

The diverse talents and intellectual pursuits of Khayyam captivated many Ottoman and Turkish writers throughout history. Scholars often viewed Khayyam as a means to enhance their own poetic prowess and intellectual depth, drawing inspiration and recognition from his writings. For many Muslim reformers, Khayam&#x27;s verses provided a counterpoint to the conservative norms prevalent in Islamic societies, allowing room for independent thought and a libertine lifestyle. Figures like Abdullah Cevdet, Rıza Tevfik, and Yahya Kemal utilized Khayyam&#x27;s themes to justify their progressive ideologies or to celebrate liberal aspects of their lives, portraying him as a cultural, political, and intellectual role model who demonstrated Islam&#x27;s compatibility with modern conventions. Similarly, Turkish leftist poets and intellectuals, including Nâzım Hikmet, Sabahattin Eyüboğlu, A. Kadir, and Gökçe, appropriated Khayyam to champion their socialist worldview, imbuing his voice with a humanistic tone in the vernacular. Khayyam&#x27;s resurgence in spoken Turkish since the 1980s has transformed him into a poet of the people, with numerous books and translations revitalizing his historical significance. Conversely, scholars like Dāniş, Tevfik, and Gölpınarlı advocated for source criticism and the identification of authentic quatrains to discern the genuine Khayyam amidst historical perceptions of his sociocultural image.

=== The Moving Finger quatrain ===

The quatrain by Omar Khayyam known as &quot;The Moving Finger&quot;, in the form of its translation by the English poet Edward Fitzgerald is one of the most popular quatrains in the Anglosphere. It reads:

The title of the novel &quot;The Moving Finger&quot; written by Agatha Christie and published in 1942 was inspired by this quatrain of the translation of &quot;Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot; by Edward Fitzgerald. Martin Luther King also cites this quatrain of Omar Khayyam in one of his speeches, &quot;Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence&quot;:

In one of his apologetic speeches about the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal, Bill Clinton, the 42nd president of the US, also cites this quatrain.

=== Other popular culture references ===

In 1934 Harold Lamb published a historical novel &quot;Omar Khayyam&quot;. The French-Lebanese writer Amin Maalouf based the first half of his historical fiction novel &quot;Samarkand&quot; on Khayyam&#x27;s life and the creation of his Rubaiyat. The sculptor Eduardo Chillida produced four massive iron pieces titled &quot;Mesa de Omar Khayyam&quot; (Omar Khayyam&#x27;s Table) in the 1980s.

The lunar crater Omar Khayyam was named in his honour in 1970, as was the minor planet 3095 Omarkhayyam discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravlyova in 1980.

Google has released two Google Doodles commemorating him. The first was on his 964th birthday on 18 May 2012. The second was on his 971st birthday on 18 May 2019.

<text>Mister Roberts is a 1946 novel by Thomas Heggen, based on his experiences in the South West Pacific theatre during World War II. Several characters, including the eponymous Mister Roberts, were based on real people. Lieutenant (junior grade) Roberts defends his crew against the petty tyranny of the ship&#x27;s commanding officer, while submitting transfer requests on a daily basis. Nearly all action takes place on a US Navy auxiliary cargo ship, the USS &quot;Reluctant,&quot; which sails, as written in the 1948 play adapted from the novel, &quot;from Apathy to Tedium, with occasional side trips to Monotony and Ennui.&quot; Roberts eventually wins his freedom from the “bucket” and assignment to a destroyer, with tragic consequences.

Heggen and Joshua Logan turned the novel into a Tony-award-winning hit play, which opened on Broadway in February 1948. A book dramatizing the play, co-authored by Heggen and Logan and also titled &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;, was published by Random House in 1948. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Lewis Nichols praised all three works: “As a novel &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; won a few million friends, and as one of the more highly regarded of this season&#x27;s plays it has added a few million more. Now that the printed form of the drama has come out, there is no reason to suppose its progress will be other than in the same direction“.

==Plot==
Douglas Roberts, the title character, joined the Navy expecting that he would be assigned to surface combat in a destroyer or a cruiser. He had no idea that the Navy had support ships. To his distress, he was assigned first to a tanker in the Atlantic and then to the USS &quot;Reluctant&quot;, AK-601, a general cargo freighter ferrying supplies to backwater Pacific bases. Mr. Roberts is the ship&#x27;s First Lieutenant, meaning that he is responsible for maintaining the entire ship except for the engineering spaces. He hates the ship, but he is more responsible for her than anyone aboard apart from the Captain. The irony is not lost on him.

Every month, he submits a request for transfer; every month, Captain Morton, the commanding officer of the &quot;Reluctant&quot;, forwards it, not recommending approval. Roberts is the balance wheel between the unreasonable behavior of the Captain and the frustration of the crew at being assigned to &quot;this bucket&quot;, which never goes anywhere worth going or does anything worth doing.

The novel is a series of stories set aboard the &quot;Reluctant&quot;, showing the problems of life aboard a naval auxiliary in the rear areas of the Pacific war. One chapter deals with a very new ensign finding his feet aboard a ship much more casual than a taut man-of-war. Another shows the kind of feuding that months of boredom can engender between two officers. One chapter shows what can happen when a crew that hasn&#x27;t had a liberty in more than a year is anchored off an island that has a naval hospital with nurses and no shades on their windows. Yet another recounts what happens when the &quot;Reluctant&quot; is sent with a load of cargo to the port of Elysium and Captain Morton grants liberty to half the crew. The final chapter illustrates the affection of the crew towards Mr. Roberts, when his transfer finally comes through and he leaves the ship to return to the United States for assignment to a new destroyer ... and what happens afterwards.

==Background==
Heggen based his novel on his experiences aboard the cargo ships and , in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. He had written a number of short stories, which he collected and merged into the novel. It was subsequently adapted as a 1948 play, a 1955 feature film, a 1965–66 television series, and a live 1984 television movie.

Heggen only enjoyed the initial success and profits of his creation, as his life ended in May 1949, just after turning 30. Heggen was found dead in his bathtub. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that according to the coroner, he had drowned. Many of those close to him believed that it was an accident. According to the Los Angeles Times obituary of Dr. Robert Litman, a pioneer in suicide prevention, Litman&#x27;s “interest in the subject was sparked by the death of his high school best friend, Thomas Heggen”. In 1974, John Leggett&#x27;s book, &quot;Ross and Tom: Two American Tragedies,&quot; explored the lives of “ two young novelists, just my age and no more promising in background, (who) had been published so successfully that their first books made them rich and famous. Then, at the peak of their acclaim, they died. The first, Ross Lockridge, took his own life... The second, Thomas Heggen, drowned in his bathwater—an accident, it was claimed, but it was the accident of a desperate man.”

The character Mister Roberts was based on the &quot;Rotanin&quot;″s executive officer, Donald House. Unlike the character in the book, he was not killed in action, but continued as a career Naval officer until retirement, and lived until early 1998.

The ship&#x27;s Captain portrayed in Mister Roberts, played by James Cagney, and the ensuing palm tree shenanigans, was based on the real-life captain of the , Lt. Commander Herbert Ezra Randall Sr., USNR. Captain Randall continued as a career Naval officer until retirement and lived in southern California until November 21, 1991. In 1997, the USS Virgo Association held their annual meeting in Riverside, California and conducted a graveside ceremony, plot: 28, 2693; Riverside National Cemetery, Riverside County, California, including a 21-gun salute in honor of their captain—complete with a potted palm tree placed on the grave.

In December 2011, honoring the 65th anniversary of the book&#x27;s publication, James C. Roberts, cousin of the friend for whom Heggen named his leading man, wrote a long article for the &quot;Navy Times&quot; about the background, history and significance of the novel. Roberts wrote that &quot;Like his fictional &#x27;Old Stupid&#x27; counterpart, Captain Randall did own two palm trees, and like the characters Doug Roberts and Ensign Pulver, Heggen threw them over the side.&quot;

<doc id="92556" wikidata="Q220264" url="?curid=92556" title="Popol Vuh">
<text>Popol Vuh (also Popul Vuh or Pop Vuj) is a text recounting the mythology and history of the Kʼicheʼ people of Guatemala, one of the Maya peoples who also inhabit the Mexican states of Chiapas, Campeche, Yucatan and Quintana Roo, as well as areas of Belize, Honduras and El Salvador.

The &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; is a foundational sacred narrative of the Kʼicheʼ people from long before the Spanish conquest of the Maya. It includes the Mayan creation myth, the exploits of the Hero Twins Hunahpú and Xbalanqué, and a chronicle of the Kʼicheʼ people.

The name &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; translates as &quot;Book of the Community&quot; or &quot;Book of Counsel&quot; (literally &quot;Book that pertains to the mat&quot;, since a woven mat was used as a royal throne in ancient Kʼicheʼ society and symbolised the unity of the community). It was originally preserved through oral tradition until approximately 1550, when it was recorded in writing. The documentation of the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; is credited to the 18th-century Spanish Dominican friar Francisco Ximénez, who prepared a manuscript with a transcription in Kʼicheʼ and parallel columns with translations into Spanish.

Like the &quot;Chilam Balam&quot; and similar texts, the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; is of particular importance given the scarcity of early accounts dealing with Mesoamerican mythologies. As part of the Spanish conquest, missionaries and colonists destroyed many documents.

==History==

===Francisco Ximénez&#x27;s manuscript===
In 1701, Francisco Ximénez, a Dominican priest, came to Santo Tomás Chichicastenango (also known as Santo Tomás Chuilá). This town was in the Quiché territory and is likely where Ximénez first recorded the work. Ximénez transcribed and translated the account, setting up parallel Kʼicheʼ and Spanish language columns in his manuscript. (He represented the Kʼicheʼ language phonetically with Latin and Parra characters.) In or around 1714, Ximénez incorporated the Spanish content in book one, chapters 2–21 of his &quot;Historia de la provincia de San Vicente de Chiapa y Guatemala de la orden de predicadores&quot;. Ximénez&#x27;s manuscripts were held posthumously by the Dominican Order until General Francisco Morazán expelled the clerics from Guatemala in 1829–30. At that time the Order&#x27;s documents were taken over largely by the Universidad de San Carlos.

From 1852 to 1855, Moritz Wagner and Carl Scherzer traveled in Central America, arriving in Guatemala City in early May 1854. Scherzer found Ximénez&#x27;s writings in the university library, noting that there was one particular item &quot;del mayor interés&quot; (&#x27;of the greatest interest&#x27;). With assistance from the Guatemalan historian and archivist Juan Gavarrete, Scherzer copied (or had a copy made of) the Spanish content from the last half of the manuscript, which he published upon his return to Europe. In 1855, French Abbot Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg also came across Ximénez&#x27;s manuscript in the university library. However, whereas Scherzer copied the manuscript, Brasseur apparently stole the university&#x27;s volume and took it back to France. After Brasseur&#x27;s death in 1874, the Mexico-Guatémalienne collection containing &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; passed to Alphonse Pinart, through whom it was sold to Edward E. Ayer. In 1897, Ayer decided to donate his 17,000 pieces to The Newberry Library in Chicago, a project that was not completed until 1911. Father Ximénez&#x27;s transcription-translation of &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; was among Ayer&#x27;s donated items.

Priest Ximénez&#x27;s manuscript sank into obscurity until Adrián Recinos rediscovered it at the Newberry in 1941. Recinos is generally credited with finding the manuscript and publishing the first direct edition since Scherzer. But Munro Edmonson and Carlos López attribute the first rediscovery to Walter Lehmann in 1928. Experts Allen Christenson, Néstor Quiroa, Rosa Helena Chinchilla Mazariegos, John Woodruff, and Carlos López all consider the Newberry volume to be Ximénez&#x27;s one and only &quot;original.&quot;

&#x27;Popol Vuh&#x27; is also spelled as &#x27;Popol Vuj&#x27;, its sound in Spanish use is close to German term for &#x27;book&#x27;: &#x27;buch&#x27;, in the translation of title meaning by Adrián Recinos, both phonetics and etymology connect to &#x27;People&#x27;s book&#x27;, in the line of &#x27;people&#x27; used as a synonym for the whole nation or tribe, as in &#x27;Bible, book of Lord&#x27;s people&#x27;.

===Father Ximénez&#x27;s source===

It is generally believed that Ximénez borrowed a phonetic manuscript from a parishioner for his source, although Néstor Quiroa points out that &quot;such a manuscript has never been found, and thus Ximenez&#x27;s work represents the only source for scholarly studies.&quot; This document would have been a phonetic rendering of an oral recitation performed in or around Santa Cruz del Quiché shortly following Pedro de Alvarado&#x27;s 1524 conquest. By comparing the genealogy at the end of &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; with dated colonial records, Adrián Recinos and Dennis Tedlock suggest a date between 1554 and 1558. But to the extent that the text speaks of a &quot;written&quot; document, Woodruff cautions that &quot;critics appear to have taken the text of the first folio recto too much at face value in drawing conclusions about &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;&#x27;s survival.&quot; If there was an early post-conquest document, one theory (first proposed by Rudolf Schuller) ascribes the phonetic authorship to Diego Reynoso, one of the signatories of the &quot;Título de Totonicapán&quot;. Another possible author could have been Don Cristóbal Velasco, who, also in &quot;Titulo de Totonicapán&quot;, is listed as &quot;Nim Chokoh Cavec&quot; (&#x27;Great Steward of the Kaweq&#x27;). In either case, the colonial presence is clear in &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;&#x27;s preamble: &quot;This we shall write now under the Law of God and Christianity; we shall bring it to light because now the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, as it is called, cannot be seen any more, in which was clearly seen the coming from the other side of the sea and the narration of our obscurity, and our life was clearly seen.&quot; Accordingly, the need to &quot;preserve&quot; the content presupposes an imminent disappearance of the content, and therefore, Edmonson theorized a pre-conquest glyphic codex. No evidence of such a codex has yet been found.

A minority, however, disputes the existence of pre-Ximénez texts on the same basis that is used to argue their existence. Both positions are based on two statements by Ximénez. The first of these comes from &quot;Historia de la provincia&quot; where Ximénez writes that he found various texts during his curacy of Santo Tomás Chichicastenango that were guarded with such secrecy &quot;that not even a trace of it was revealed among the elder ministers&quot; although &quot;almost all of them have it memorized.&quot; The second passage used to argue pre-Ximénez texts comes from Ximénez&#x27;s addendum to &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;. There he states that many of the natives&#x27; practices can be &quot;seen in a book that they have, something like a prophecy, from the beginning of their [pre-Christian] days, where they have all the months and signs corresponding to each day, one of which I have in my possession.&quot; Scherzer explains in a footnote that what Ximénez is referencing &quot;is only a secret calendar&quot; and that he himself had &quot;found this rustic calendar previously in various indigenous towns in the Guatemalan highlands&quot; during his travels with Wagner. This presents a contradiction because the item which Ximénez has in his possession is not &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, and a carefully guarded item is not likely to have been easily available to Ximénez. Apart from this, Woodruff surmises that because &quot;Ximenez never discloses his source, instead inviting readers to infer what they wish [. . .], it is plausible that there was no such alphabetic redaction among the Indians. The implied alternative is that he or another missionary made the first written text from an oral recitation.&quot;

==Story of Hunahpú and Xbalanqué==

Many versions of the legend of the Hero Twins Hunahpú and Xbalanqué circulated through the Maya peoples, but the story that survives was preserved by the Dominican priest Francisco Ximénez who translated the document between 1700 and 1715. Maya deities in the Post-Classic codices differ from the earlier versions described in the Early Classic period. In Mayan mythology Hunahpú and Xbalanqué are the second pair of twins out of three, preceded by Hun-Hunahpú and his brother Vucub-Hunahpú, and precursors to the third pair of twins, Hun Batz and Hun Chuen. In the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, the first set of twins, Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hanahpú were invited to the Mayan Underworld, Xibalba, to play a ballgame with the Xibalban lords. In the Underworld the twins faced many trials filled with trickery; eventually they fail and are put to death. The Hero Twins, Hunahpú and Xbalanqué, are magically conceived after the death of their father, Hun-Hunahpú, and in time they return to Xibalba to avenge the deaths of their father and uncle by defeating the Lords of the Underworld.

==Structure==
&quot;Popol Vuh&quot; encompasses a range of subjects that includes creation, ancestry, history, and cosmology. There are no content divisions in the Newberry Library&#x27;s holograph, but popular editions have adopted the organization imposed by Brasseur de Bourbourg in 1861 in order to facilitate comparative studies. Though some variation has been tested by Dennis Tedlock and Allen Christenson, editions typically take the following form:

Preamble
* Introduction to the piece that introduces Xpiyacoc and Xmucane, the purpose for writing the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, and the measuring of the earth.

Book One
* &quot;Account of the creation of living beings.&quot; Animals were created first, followed by humans. The first humans were made of earth and mud, but crumbled. The second humans were created from wood, but they did not function well and were washed away in a flood and killed by animals. Those that survived became monkeys.
* Vucub-Caquix ascends.

Book Two
* The Hero Twins plan to kill Vucub-Caquix and his sons, Zipacna and Cabracan.
* They succeed, &quot;restoring order and balance to the world.&quot;

Book Three
* The father and uncle of The Hero Twins, Hun Hunahpu and Vucub Hunahpu, sons of Xmucane and Xpiacoc, are murdered at a ball game in Xibalba.
* Hun Hunahpu&#x27;s head is placed in a calabash tree, where it spits in the hand of Xquiq, impregnating her.
* She leaves the underworld to be with her mother-in-law, Xmucane.
* Her sons then challenge the Lords who killed their father and uncle, succeeding and becoming the sun and the moon.

Book Four
* Humans are successfully created from maize.
* The gods give them morality in order to keep them loyal.
* Later, they give the humans wives to make them content.
* This book also describes the movement of the Kʼicheʼ and includes the introduction of Gucumatz.

==Modern history==

===Modern editions===
Since Brasseur&#x27;s and Scherzer&#x27;s first editions, the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; has been translated into many other languages besides its original Kʼicheʼ. The Spanish edition by Adrián Recinos is still a major reference, as is Recino&#x27;s English translation by Delia Goetz. Other English translations include those of Victor Montejo, Munro Edmonson (1985), and Dennis Tedlock (1985, 1996). Tedlock&#x27;s version is notable because it builds on commentary and interpretation by a modern Kʼicheʼ daykeeper, Andrés Xiloj. Augustín Estrada Monroy published a facsimile edition in the 1970s and Ohio State University has a digital version and transcription online. Modern translations and transcriptions of the Kʼicheʼ text have been published by, among others, Sam Colop (1999) and Allen J. Christenson (2004). In 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; named Michael Bazzett&#x27;s new translation as one of the ten best books of poetry of 2018. The tale of Hunahpu and Xbalanque has also been rendered as an hour-long animated film by Patricia Amlin.

===Contemporary culture===
The &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; continues to be an important part in the belief system of many Kʼicheʼ. Although Catholicism is generally seen as the dominant religion, some believe that many natives practice a syncretic blend of Christian and indigenous beliefs. Some stories from the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; continued to be told by modern Maya as folk legends; some stories recorded by anthropologists in the 20th century may preserve portions of the ancient tales in greater detail than the Ximénez manuscript. On August 22, 2012, the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; was declared &quot;intangible cultural heritage&quot; of Guatemala by the Guatemalan Ministry of Culture.

===Reflections in Western culture===
Since its rediscovery by Europeans in the nineteenth century, the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; has attracted the attention of many creators of cultural works.

Mexican muralist Diego Rivera produced a series of watercolors in 1931 as illustrations for the book.

In 1934, the early avant-garde Franco-American composer Edgard Varèse wrote his &quot;Ecuatorial&quot;, a setting of words from the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; for bass soloist and various instruments.

The planet of Camazotz in Madeleine L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; (1962) is named for the bat-god of the hero-twins story.

In 1969 in Munich, Germany, keyboardist Florian Fricke—at the time ensconced in Mayan myth—formed a band named Popol Vuh with synth player Frank Fiedler and percussionist Holger Trulzsch. Their 1970 debut album, &quot;Affenstunde&quot;, reflected this spiritual connection. Another band by the same name, this one of Norwegian descent, formed around the same time, its name also inspired by the Kʼicheʼ writings.

The text was used by German film director Werner Herzog as extensive narration for the first chapter of his movie &quot;Fata Morgana&quot; (1971). Herzog and Florian Fricke were life long collaborators and friends.

The Argentinian composer Alberto Ginastera began writing his symphonic work &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; in 1975, but did not complete the piece before his death in 1983.

The myths and legends included in Louis L&#x27;Amour&#x27;s novel &quot;The Haunted Mesa&quot; (1987) are largely based on the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;.

The &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; is referenced throughout Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s television show &quot;From Dusk till Dawn: The Series&quot; (2014). In particular, the show&#x27;s protagonists, the Gecko Brothers, Seth and Richie, are referred to as the embodiment of Hunahpú and Xbalanqué, the hero twins, from the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;.

In the 2024 historical novel &quot;Daughter of Fire&quot; by Sofia Robleda, the preservation of the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; is central to the plot.

Quotes from the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; are used in &quot;Live Gloriously&quot;, the main theme for the video game &quot;Civilization VII&quot;.

==Antecedents in Maya iconography==

Contemporary archaeologists (first of all Michael D. Coe) have found depictions of characters and episodes from &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; on Mayan ceramics and other art objects (e.g., the Hero Twins, Howler Monkey Gods, the shooting of Vucub-Caquix and, as many believe, the restoration of the Twins&#x27; dead father, Hun Hunahpu). The accompanying sections of hieroglyphical text could thus, theoretically, relate to passages from the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;. Richard D. Hansen found a stucco frieze depicting two floating figures that might be the Hero Twins at the site of El Mirador.

Following the Twin Hero narrative, mankind is fashioned from white and yellow corn, demonstrating the crop&#x27;s transcendent importance in Maya culture. To the Maya of the Classic period, Hun Hunahpu may have represented the maize god. Although in the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; his severed head is unequivocally stated to have become a calabash, some scholars believe the calabash to be interchangeable with a cacao pod or an ear of corn. In this line, decapitation and sacrifice correspond to harvesting corn and the sacrifices accompanying planting and harvesting. Planting and harvesting also relate to Maya astronomy and the calendar, since the cycles of the moon and sun determined the crop seasons.

<text>Xmucane () and Xpiacoc (), alternatively Xumucane and Ixpiyacoc, are the names of the divine grandparents of Maya mythology of the Kʼicheʼ people and the daykeepers of the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;. They are considered to be the oldest of all the gods of the Kʼicheʼ pantheon and are identified by a number of names throughout the text, reflecting their multiple roles throughout the Maya creation myth. They are usually mentioned together, although Xmucane seems to be alone during most of the interactions with the Maya Hero Twins, when she is referred to as simply &quot;grandmother&quot;.

The pair were invoked during the creation of the world in which the Maya gods were attempting to create humanity. Xmucane and Xpiacoc ground the maize that was used in the third, successful attempt to make people, after a first attempt with mud and a second with wood, the products of which were described as being simply mannequins and not real people. These two are also invoked, often by other powerful deities, for their powers in divination and matchmaking.

Xmucane herself also plays an integral role in the development of the Maya Hero Twins. She was at first wary of them and their mother, Xquic, and ordered them out of her house when they were yet infants, but she would come to accept them almost as her own sons, raising and caring for them.

<text>Picnic is a 1955 American Technicolor romantic comedy-drama film filmed in CinemaScope. It was adapted for the screen by Daniel Taradash from William Inge&#x27;s 1953 Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name. Joshua Logan, director of the original Broadway stage production, directed the film version, which stars William Holden, Kim Novak, and Rosalind Russell, with Susan Strasberg and Cliff Robertson in supporting roles. &quot;Picnic&quot; was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won two.

The film dramatizes 24 hours in the life of a small Kansas town in the mid-20th century during the Labor Day holiday. It is the story of an outsider whose appearance disrupts and rearranges the lives of those whom he encounters.

==Plot==
On the morning of Labor Day 1955, a freight train brings vagrant Hal Carter to a Kansas town to visit his fraternity friend Alan Benson. While he stays with kind Helen Potts, he also meets Alan&#x27;s girlfriend Madge Owens, her sister Millie, and their mother. Alan is happy to see the &quot;same old Hal&quot; and shows him his family&#x27;s sprawling grain-elevator operations. He promises Hal a steady job as a &quot;wheat scooper&quot; (though Hal would prefer to start off as an executive) and invites him to attend the town&#x27;s Labor Day picnic.

At the picnic, Hal divides his attention among Madge, Millie, and middle-aged schoolteacher Rosemary, who is accompanied by her friend Howard Bevans. As Hal dances with Madge, an intoxicated Rosemary watches. When Rosemary doesn&#x27;t like the way Hal is dancing with Madge, she interrupts them and insists he dance with her. Hal is uncomfortable and resists, and Rosemary tears his shirt. Millie gets up, claiming to be sick. As Madge tries to help her, Millie pushes her away, saying everyone always thinks &quot;Madge is the pretty one.&quot; She runs off, leaving Howard to find a bottle of alcohol she left behind, which her mother Flo inadvertently sees. When she wants to know who has been giving liquor to her underage daughter, Rosemary blames Hal. Embarrassed by the rejection, she dresses him down, telling him he&#x27;s been acting like a big shot since he got into town and that he acts young, but isn&#x27;t. She accuses him of being a fake who is just scared to act his real age, afraid of ending up in the gutter &quot;where you belong.&quot;

Madge follows Hal to Alan&#x27;s car and gets in with him. By the river, he tells her he was sent to reform school as a boy for stealing a motorcycle and that his whole life is a failure. They kiss. Outside Madge&#x27;s house, they promise to meet after she finishes work the next evening.

Hal drives back to Alan&#x27;s house to return the car, but Alan has called the police and wants him arrested. Hal flees the house in the car with the police following close behind. He shows up at Howard&#x27;s apartment, asking to spend the night there. Howard is very understanding and now has his own worries: Rosemary has begged him to marry her. Back at the Owens house, Madge and Millie cry themselves to sleep in their shared room.

The next morning, Howard comes to the Owens house, intending to tell Rosemary he wants to wait, but at the sight of him she is overjoyed, thinking he has come to take her away. He wordlessly goes along with the misunderstanding. As Howard passes Madge on the stairs, he tells her Hal is hiding in the back seat of his car. Hal is able to slip away before the other women gleefully decorate Howard&#x27;s car.

While Howard and Rosemary happily drive off to the Ozarks, Hal and Madge meet by a shed behind the house. He tells her that he loves her and asks her to meet him in Tulsa, where they can marry and he can get a job at a hotel as a bellhop and elevator operator. Mrs. Owens finds them by the shed and threatens to call the police. Madge and Hal embrace and kiss.

Hal runs to catch a passing freight train, crying out to Madge, &quot;You love me! You love me!&quot; Upstairs in their room, Millie tells Madge to &quot;do something bright&quot; for once in her life and go to Hal. Madge packs a small suitcase and, despite her mother&#x27;s tears, boards a bus for Tulsa.

==Production==

Columbia acquired the rights to the play for $350,000 in September 1953.

Harry Cohn offered the job of directing to Joshua Logan, who had directed the stage version. Logan was grateful as he had just had a manic breakdown.

===Casting===
The then 37-year old William Holden was already cast when Logan came on board. Holden was &quot;happy to finish his Columbia Pictures contract with such a prestigious project&quot; despite the film paying him $30,000 instead of the $250,000 he would have otherwise earned. In the film, Holden keeps his hair combed in an untidy fringe over his forehead and has the sleeves of his shirt rolled up throughout. He shaved his chest for the shirtless shots and was reportedly nervous about his dancing for the &quot;Moonglow&quot; scene. Logan took him to Kansas roadhouses where he practiced steps in front of jukeboxes with choreographer Miriam Nelson.

Logan said Cohn suggested that Columbia contract star Kim Novak be cast, but did not insist on it. Logan felt Novak was very close to the character she played. The &quot;blonde bombshell&quot; Novak screen tested twice and was given the part, playing it as a redhead. &quot;Picnic&quot; was one of Kim Novak&#x27;s early film roles, and this movie made her a star.

Janice Rule, who played the part on Broadway, did a screen test, but Logan said that it went poorly. Writer Daniel Taradash pushed for Carroll Baker, and who tested, but Logan felt that she was too young.

Eileen Heckart played the school teacher on Broadway, but Harry Cohn wanted a bigger name, so Rosalind Russell was cast. This was her first Hollywood movie after a big success on Broadway with her Tony Award-winning performance in &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; (1953). The film credits her with &quot;co-star&quot; status.

Paul Newman was under contract to Warner Bros and was unable to reprise his role as Alan, so Logan cast Cliff Robertson, who had been in a touring company of &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;.

Millie, the independently minded girl who memorizes Shakespeare sonnets and rebels against her older sister, was an early role for Susan Strasberg, the daughter of prominent Method drama teacher Lee Strasberg. Kim Stanley played the younger sister on stage, but Logan thought she was too old on film and cast Strasberg.

Elizabeth Wilson had a bit part as one of the smirking schoolteachers. Verna Felton, a longtime radio and TV character actor who was well-known to audiences in the 1950s, had a strong supporting role as neighbor Helen Potts.

Bomber, the paperboy, was played by Nick Adams, an actor who dated Natalie Wood and was a friend of both James Dean and Elvis Presley.

Mr. Benson was played by Raymond Bailey (without his toupee), later known on television as &quot;Beverly Hillbillies&quot; banker Milburn Drysdale.

Reta Shaw, Elizabeth Wilson and Arthur O&#x27;Connell recreated their roles from the original Broadway production.

===Locations===
The extensive use of Kansas locations highlighted the naturalistic, small-town drama. &quot;Picnic&quot; was shot mostly around Hutchinson, Kansas. Other Kansas locations include:

* Halstead&#x27;s Riverside Park is where the Labor Day picnic scenes were filmed. The park and many landmarks remained at the time of the movie&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The merry-go-round and cable suspension footbridge, which spans the Little Arkansas River, are still located there.
* Nickerson is the location of the two adjacent houses used for the Owens family home and that of Mrs. Potts. It is where Hal (William Holden) &quot;jumps a freight&quot; to go to Tulsa and where Madge boards a bus in the last scene.
* Salina, for the opening scene where Hal jumps off a train, then meets Alan (Cliff Robertson) at Alan&#x27;s father&#x27;s large house. This location is also used for the Saline River (where Madge kisses Hal) and the scene where Hal escapes from the police by running under a waterfall.
* Sterling, where the pre-picnic swim in the lake was filmed.

During filming of the picnic scenes in Halstead, Kansas, a tornado swept through the area, forcing the cast and crew to take cover. While the storm spared the set, it devastated the nearby town of Udall, Kansas, and the film crew drove their trucks and equipment there to help clean up the damage.

Heavy thunderstorms with tornado warnings repeatedly interrupted shooting of the scene on location, and it was completed on a backlot in Burbank, where Holden (according to some sources) was &quot;dead drunk&quot; to calm his nerves.

==Reception==
The film&#x27;s release was accompanied by a &quot;Time&quot; cover story. It earned theatrical rentals of $6,300,000 in the United States and Canada and $9 million worldwide.

In a contemporary review, critic Mae Tinee of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote:It is a taut two hours of masterful movie making ... The story presents a cross-section of many lives, but the telling is never hurried, the detail is impressive, and the performances are some of the finest of the year. ... The film tells a moving and human tale, and does it in superb fashion. It is one of the finest examples of superior motion picture production.&quot;Once the movie premiered at the Radio City Music Hall, film critic A. H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote:[I]t should be noted that William Inge&#x27;s distinguished comedy-drama is slightly travelworn here and there. The hearts and minds of the commonplace Kansas townsfolk that were so beautifully revealed on stage still leave a sharp, poignant and lasting impression on a moviegoer. But the new CinemaScope surroundings appear too vast an occasion for these basically intimate stories. &quot;Lebensraum&quot; apparently is not what these Plains people need. And, while the titular picnic of this sprawling dramatization is inventive, eye-catching and eye-filling, it is not particularly germane to the dramas at hand. ... In returning to film making after a long absence, Joshua Logan, who has lived with the play from the beginning, has made its characters come alive again through his directorial artistry. Although he is occasionally overwhelmed by the CinemaScope process, Mr. Inge&#x27;s principals are not. They still make &quot;Picnic&quot; a memorable and moving drama.The film was restored in the mid-1990s and brought many art-house bookings.

===Awards and nominations===
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2002: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Passions – #59
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores – Nominated

==Music==
The film&#x27;s &quot;Theme from Picnic&quot;, composed by George Duning and Steve Allen (although Allen&#x27;s lyrics were not used in the film), was released in three versions:

* &quot;Moonglow and Theme from &#x27;Picnic&#x27;&quot; by Morris Stoloff and the Columbia Pictures Orchestra reached #1 on the Billboard Top 100 and remained on the chart for 27 weeks.
* &quot;Moonglow and Theme from &#x27;Picnic&#x27;&quot; by George Cates and His Orchestra reached #4 on the Billboard Top 100 and remained on the chart for 22 weeks.
* &quot;Picnic&quot;, a vocal version by the McGuire Sisters, reached #13 on the Billboard Top 100 and remained on the chart for 20 weeks. The single was a double A-side with &quot;Delilah Jones&quot;, a #37 hit.

At one point, the three singles were in the Top 40 simultaneously, and the Stoloff and Cates versions ranked consecutively at #3 and #4 in the Top 100 chart of June 2, 1956.

The soundtrack album reached #2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart, where it remained for 56 weeks beginning in February 1956.

==Subliminal marketing hoax==
In 1957, marketing researcher James Vicary said he had included subliminal messages such as &quot;eat popcorn&quot; and &quot;drink Coca-Cola&quot; in public screenings of &quot;Picnic&quot; for six weeks, claiming sales of Coca-Cola and popcorn increased 18.1% and 57.8% respectively. However, after being unable to replicate the results, Vicary later admitted that he had falsified the data.

==Remakes==
&quot;Picnic&quot; was remade for television twice. The first was in 1986, directed by Marshall W. Mason and starring Gregory Harrison, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Michael Learned, Rue McClanahan and Dick Van Patten. The second remake was in 2000, starring Josh Brolin, Gretchen Mol, Bonnie Bedelia, Jay O. Sanders and Mary Steenburgen. The adaptation by Shelley Evans was directed by Ivan Passer.

<text>Tohil (, also spelled Tojil) is the Maya god of fire. He is a deity of the Kʼicheʼ Maya in the Late Postclassic period of Mesoamerica.

At the time of the Spanish Conquest, Tohil was the patron god of the Kʼicheʼ. He was included in the Tolteca pantheon that was influenced in the highlands Maya culture in the Postclassic Period. Tohil&#x27;s principal function was that of a fire deity and he was also both a war god, sun god and the god of rain. Tohil was also associated with mountains and he was a god of war, sacrifice and sustenance. In the Kʼicheʼ epic Popul Vuh, after the first people were created, they gathered at the mythical Tollan or Tula, the Place of the Seven Caves, to receive their language and their gods. The Kʼicheʼ, and others, there received Tohil. Tohil demanded blood sacrifice from the Kʼicheʼ and so they offered their own blood and also that of sacrificed captives taken in battle. In the Popul Vuh this consumption of blood by Tohil is likened to the suckling of an infant by its mother.

Tohil was originally part of the Tolteca pantheon and was introduced in Postclassic Maya culture. He has been compared to the same god Qʼuqʼumatz, and shared attributes of the feathered serpent with that deity, but they later diverged and each deity came to have a separate priesthood. Sculptures of a human face emerging between the jaws of a serpent were common from the end of the Classic Period through to the Late Postclassic and may represent Qʼuqʼumatz in the act of carrying Hunahpu, the youthful avatar of the sun god Tohil, across the sky. The god&#x27;s association with human sacrifice meant that Tohil was one of the first deities that the Spanish clergy tried to eradicate after the conquest of Guatemala.

Indeed, it&#x27;s known that the Kaqchikel tribe was against the human sacrifice demanded by Tohil to bring them fire. For this reason they stole the fire from the deity — Kaqchikel means “fire thieves.” This is the principal cause of enmity between the K&#x27;iche and Kaqchikel peoples.

==Attributes==
There is disagreement over the meaning of the name of the deity. It has been interpreted as meaning &quot;obsidian&quot;, as deriving from the word &quot;toh&quot; (&quot;rain&quot;) and as meaning &quot;tribute&quot; or &quot;payment&quot;. Tohil was one of a trinity of gods worshipped by the Kʼicheʼ elite, together with Awilix and Jacawitz. The concept of a triad of deities was ancient in Maya religion, dating as far back as the Late Preclassic. The triad of Kʼicheʼ gods were sometimes referred to collectively as Tohil. Tohil has been equated with the Classic Period God K. The deity also possesses attributes that suggest a link with Mixcoatl, a hunting god of the Aztecs.

Tohil was the patron deity of the Kaweq lineage of the Kʼicheʼ. He was associated with a sacred deerskin bundle that was said to embody him, and one of his titles was &quot;Qajawal Kej&quot; (&quot;Our Lord Deer&quot;). The deity was associated with thunder, lightning and the sunrise.

==Worship==

The Kaweq lineage of the Kʼicheʼ built a temple to Tohil at their first capital Jacawitz, identified as the archaeological site of Chitinamit. Jacawitz was overlooked by a shrine to the god placed on a neighbouring peak, this shrine was known as Pa Tohil. Later the Kʼicheʼ built their main temple to Tohil at Qʼumarkaj, their new capital. They made him offerings on the day &quot;Toh&quot;, one of the days of their 20-day calendar cycle. The Kʼicheʼ performed the Great Dance of Tohil in honour of the deity in the month of &quot;Tzʼikin Qʼij&quot;, prior to the maize harvest (which takes place in November). This dance took place at Qʼumarkaj and involved a gathering of all the principal lineages subject to the Kʼicheʼ Kingdom of Qʼumarkaj, and as is described in the Kʼicheʼ chronicle &quot;Título de Totonicapán&quot;, they were expected to bring tribute, slaves and sacrifices.

The priests of Tohil were known as &quot;Aj Tohil&quot; and were selected from the ruling Kaweq lineage of Qʼumarkaj. During their ceremonies to Tohil, the Kʼicheʼ would offer quetzal feathers to the god. Writing at the end of the 17th century, Francisco Ximénez described the tradition that upon the temple human sacrifices were tied before the representation of Tohil, where the priest would open the victim&#x27;s chest and cut out his heart. After sacrifice, the victim&#x27;s body was probably hurled down the front stairway of the temple where his head would be severed to be placed on a skull rack that was located in front of the temple.

Equivalents to Tohil were worshipped by other groups closely related to the Kʼicheʼ. These included Belehe Toh of the Kaqchikels and Hun Toh of the Rabinal, this last name meaning &quot;One Rain&quot;, a calendrical date. The Kaqchikel and the Rabinal did not merely think their own patrons were &quot;equivalent&quot; to Tohil, they claimed that they were the same deity under a different name. The Kʼicheʼ themselves claimed in the Popul Vuh that their patron Tohil was the same as Quetzalcoatl of the Aztecs.

===Temple of Tohil===

The Temple of Tohil at Qʼumarkaj was the tallest structure in the city. The rubble core of the building still stands but the stone facing has been looted. The temple was originally a pyramid with stairways on all four sides, the summit shrine faced towards the rising sun in the east. This form of radial pyramid temple was built by the Maya since the Late Preclassic with examples at many archaeological sites such as Tikal, Copán and Chichen Itza, among others. According to John Lloyd Stephens, who visited the site in the 1830s, the temple base measured square and it stood high. At that time the radial stairways were more-or-less intact. The temple was originally covered in painted stucco, with the decoration including the painted image of a jaguar.

==Modern worship==
Deerskins, the symbol of Tohil, are to this day venerated in many highland Maya communities and are used in dances. In the modern village of Santiago Atitlán in the Guatemalan highlands, a traditional Maya priesthood performs rites to a powerful deity addressed as &quot;King Martin, Lord of the Three Levels, Lord of Rain, Lord of Maize, and Lord of all the Mountains&quot;. This priest blesses deerskins prior them being worn, with head and antlers attached, during the Dance of Martin on November 11 prior to the maize harvest. King Martin is probably a blend of Tohil and his deerskin bundle with the Roman Catholic St Martin of Tours, whose feast falls on the same day. In Rabinal, Tohil was merged with St Paul while still retaining many of his characteristics.

<doc id="92576" wikidata="Q1219620" url="?curid=92576" title="The Rose Tattoo">
<text>The Rose Tattoo is a three-act play written by Tennessee Williams in 1949 and 1950; after its Chicago premiere on December 29, 1950, he made further revisions to the play for its Broadway premiere on February 2, 1951, and its publication by New Directions the following month. A film adaptation was released in 1955. &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; tells the story of an Italian-American widow in Mississippi who has withdrawn from the world after her husband&#x27;s death and expects her daughter to do the same.

The setting is a place in proximity to Biloxi. Jacob Adler stated that the story is disconnected from the culture of the Southern United States as the plot &quot;has almost no Southern connections&quot;.

==Background==
People originating in Sicily in real life became involved in the fruit industry in the area around New Orleans in the late 1800s, and according to Robert Rea, the playwright had a friend named Marion Black Vaccaro and that the playwright &quot;likely&quot; was aware of how the Vaccaro brothers created their fruit business via said friend.

==Productions==

The original Broadway play starred Maureen Stapleton, Phyllis Love, and Eli Wallach. Other original cast members of the 1951 Broadway play included Martin Balsam and Vivian Nathan. The original production of &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; premiered February 3, 1951, at the Martin Beck Theatre (now known as the Al Hirschfeld Theatre) and concluded October 27, 1951, with a total of 306 performances. It was produced by Cheryl Crawford, written by Tennessee Williams; incidental music by David Diamond, staged by Daniel Mann, scenic design by Boris Aronson, costumes designed by Rose Bogadnoff, lighting designed by Charles Elson, general manager John Yorke, stage manager Ralph De Launey, conductor and harpist Nettie Druzinsky, musicians: Michael Danzi, Jack Linx and Frank Kutak, production associate Bea Lawrence, and press representative Wolfe Kauffman. The play was recreated for a July 5, 1953, hour-long radio adaptation on the program &quot;Best Plays&quot;. Recordings of the radio drama exist in archives and private collections.

The play was revived in 1966, again starring Maureen Stapleton, with Maria Tucci replacing Phyllis Love in the role of Rose Delle Rose. Tucci was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play for her performance. The revival ran from November 9 to December 31 at the Billy Rose Theatre (now known as the Nederlander Theatre) with 62 performances under the direction of Milton Katselas. Scenic design was by David R. &quot;Tex&quot; Ballou, costume design by Frank Thompson, lighting designed by Peggy Clark, stage manager Ray Laine, and press representatives Arthur Cantor and Artie Solomon.

The second revival, starring Anthony LaPaglia and Mercedes Ruehl, took place in 1995 from March 23 to April 30, running for 73 performances at the Circle in the Square Theatre with casting by Stuart Howard and Amy Schecter under the direction of Robert Falls. Scenic design was by Santo Loquasto, costume design by Catherine Zuber, lighting design by Kenneth Posner, sound design by John Kilgore, hair and make-up design by Claus Lulla, wig design by John Aitchison, general manager Don Roe, management consultant Gordon G. Forbes, stage manager Peggy Peterson, assistant stage manager Wm. Hare, and dialect coach K. C. Ligon.

New Directions Publishing reissued the play in 2010 with a new introduction by playwright John Patrick Shanley.

A third Broadway revival starring Marisa Tomei and directed by Trip Cullman premiered at the American Airlines Theatre in previews on September 19, 2019, and officially on October 15.

==Sources==
For many years critics have looked for possible sources in Italian literature, suggesting such authors as Giovanni Verga or Luigi Pirandello. In 2016 an Italian critic for the first time found the undeniable inspiration for this play in Eduardo De Filippo&#x27;s 1946 play &quot;Filumena Marturano&quot;. In the play, which was staged in Rome while the playwright was living in the city in the 1940s, the main character speaks one-to-one with the Madonna of the Roses in the same way that Serafina Delle Rose does in &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot;.

==Controversy==
On May 12, 1957, the Pike Theatre in Dublin, Ireland, staged &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; with Anna Manahan as the lead and the Irish scenic artist Reginald Gray as the set designer. After a short run, the theatre was invaded by the Irish police and director Alan Simpson was arrested for producing &quot;a lewd entertainment&quot; for miming dropping a condom onto the floor. Williams&#x27; script calls for a condom to fall out of a pocket during the show but the Pike staging mimed the act, knowing it would cause conflict. An intellectual revolt against the closing of &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; came from not only Ireland but from the continent, led by playwrights Samuel Beckett, Seán O&#x27;Casey and Brendan Behan. Simpson was later released. The presiding judge, Justice O&#x27;Flynn, ruled: &quot;I can only infer that by arresting the accused, the object would be achieved of closing down the play.&quot; One of the results of this case was that any charges brought against theatre would have to be proven before the show could be forced to close.

<text>The IBM 1620 was a model of scientific minicomputer produced by IBM. It was announced on October 21, 1959, and was then marketed as an inexpensive scientific computer. After a total production of about two thousand machines, it was withdrawn on November 19, 1970. Modified versions of the 1620 were used as the CPU of the IBM 1710 and IBM 1720 Industrial Process Control Systems (making it the first digital computer considered reliable enough for real-time process control of factory equipment).

Being variable-word-length decimal, as opposed to fixed-word-length pure binary, made it an especially attractive first computer to learn on and hundreds of thousands of students had their first experiences with a computer on the IBM 1620.

Core memory cycle times were 20 microseconds for the (earlier) Model I, 10 microseconds for the Model II (about a thousand times slower than typical computer main memory in 2006). The Model II was introduced in 1962.

==Architecture==
===Memory===
The IBM 1620 Model I was a variable &quot;word&quot; length decimal (BCD) computer using core memory. The Model I core could hold 20,000 decimal digits with each digit stored in six bits. More memory could be added with the IBM 1623 Storage Unit, Model 1 which held 40,000 digits, or the 1623 Model 2 which held 60,000.

The Model II deployed the IBM 1625 core-storage memory unit, whose memory cycle time was halved by using faster cores, compared to the Model I&#x27;s (internal or 1623 memory unit): to 10 μs (i.e., the cycle speed was raised to 100 kHz).

While the five-digit addresses of either model could have addressed 100,000 decimal digits, no machine larger than 60,000 decimal digits was ever marketed.
===Memory access===
Memory was accessed two decimal digits at the same time (even-odd digit pair for numeric data or one &quot;alphameric&quot; character for text data). Each decimal digit was six bits, composed of an odd parity Check bit, a Flag bit, and four BCD bits for the value of the digit in the following format:

 C F 8 4 2 1

The Flag bit had several uses:

* In the least significant digit it was set to indicate a negative number (signed magnitude).
* It was set to mark the most significant digit of a number (&quot;wordmark&quot;).
* In the least significant digit of five-digit addresses it was set for indirect addressing (an option on the Model I, standard on the 1620 Model II). Multi-level indirection could be used (the machine could even be put into an infinite indirect addressing loop).
* In the middle three digits of five-digit addresses (on the 1620 II) they were set to select one of seven index registers.

In addition to the valid BCD digit values there were three &quot;special&quot; digit values (these could be used in calculations):

 C F 8 4 2 1
 1 0 1 0 Record Mark (right most end of record, prints as a double dagger symbol, ‡)
 1 1 0 0 Numeric Blank (blank for punched card output formatting)
 1 1 1 1 Group Mark (right most end of a group of records for disk I/O)

Instructions were fixed length (12 decimal digits), consisting of a two-digit &quot;op code&quot;, a five-digit &quot;P Address&quot; (usually the &quot;destination&quot; address), and a five-digit &quot;Q Address&quot; (usually the &quot;source&quot; address or the &quot;source&quot; immediate value). Some instructions, such as the B (branch) instruction, used only the P Address, and later smart assemblers included a &quot;B7&quot; instruction that generated a seven-digit branch instruction (op code, P address, and one extra digit because the next instruction had to start on an even-numbered digit).

Fixed-point data &quot;words&quot; could be any size from two decimal digits up to all of memory not used for other purposes.

Floating-point data &quot;words&quot; (using the hardware floating point option) could be any size from 4 decimal digits up to 102 decimal digits (2 to 100 digits for the mantissa and two digits for the exponent).

The Fortran II compiler offered limited access to this flexibility via a &quot;Source Program Control Card&quot; preceding the fortran source in a fixed format:

 *ffkks

The * in column one, &quot;ff&quot; the number of digits for the mantissa of floating-point numbers (allowing 02 to 28), &quot;kk&quot; the number of digits for fixed-point numbers (allowing 04 to 10) and &quot;s&quot; is to specify the memory size of the computer to run the code if not the current computer: 2, 4, or 6 for memories of 20,000 or 40,000 or 60,000 digits.

The machine had no programmer-accessible registers: all operations were memory to memory (including the index registers of the 1620 II).

:&quot;See Architectural difficulties section&quot;

===Character and op codes===

The table below lists Alphameric mode characters (and op codes).



The table below lists numeric mode characters.

===Invalid character===
The Model I used the Cyrillic character Ж (pronounced zh) on the typewriter as a general purpose invalid character with correct parity (invalid parity being indicated with an overstrike &quot;–&quot;). In some 1620 installations it was called a SMERSH, as used in the James Bond novels that had become popular in the late 1960s. The Model II used a new character ❚ (called &quot;pillow&quot;) as a general purpose invalid character with correct parity.

===Architectural difficulties===
Although the IBM 1620&#x27;s architecture was very popular in the scientific and engineering community, computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra pointed out several flaws in its design in EWD37, &quot;A review of the IBM 1620 data processing system&quot;. Among these are that the machine&#x27;s Branch and Transmit instruction together with Branch Back allow only one level of nested subroutine call, forcing the programmer of any code with more than one level to decide where the use of this &quot;feature&quot; would be most effective. He also showed how the machine&#x27;s paper tape reading support could not properly read tapes containing record marks, since record marks are used to terminate the characters read in storage. One effect of this is that the 1620 cannot duplicate a tape with record marks in a straightforward way: when the record mark is encountered, the punch instruction punches an EOL character instead and terminates. However this was not a crippling problem:

* the data can be copied to the end of memory and punched verbatim with a DN instruction instead of WN
* tapes were usually duplicated offline.

Most 1620 installations used the more convenient punched card input/output, rather than paper tape.

The successor to the 1620, the IBM 1130, was based on a totally different, 16-bit binary architecture. (The 1130 line retained one 1620 peripheral, the IBM 1627 drum plotter.)

==Software==

IBM supplied the following software for the 1620:

* 1620 Symbolic Programming System (SPS) (assembly language)
* FORTRAN
* FORTRAN II required 40,000 digits or more of memory

* GOTRAN simplified, interpreted version of FORTRAN for &quot;load and go&quot; operation
* Monitor I and Monitor II disk operating systems.
The Monitors provided disk based versions of 1620 SPS IId, FORTRAN IId as well as a DUP (Disk Utility Program). Both Monitor systems required 20,000 digits or more of memory and one or more 1311 disk drives.

A collection of IBM 1620 related manuals in PDF format exists at bitsavers.

==1620 non-decimal arithmetic==
Since the &quot;Model I&quot; used in-memory lookup tables for addition/subtraction, limited bases (5 to 9) unsigned number arithmetic could be performed by changing the contents of these tables, but noting that the hardware included a ten&#x27;s complementer for subtraction (and addition of oppositely signed numbers).

To do fully signed addition and subtraction in bases 2 to 4 required detailed understanding of the hardware to create a &quot;folded&quot; addition table that would fake out the complementer and carry logic.

Also the addition table would have to be reloaded for normal base 10 operation every time address calculations were required in the program, then reloaded again for the alternate base. This made the &quot;trick&quot; somewhat less than useful for any practical application.

Since the &quot;Model II&quot; had addition and subtraction fully implemented in hardware, changing the table in memory could not be used as a &quot;trick&quot; to change arithmetic bases. However an optional special feature in hardware for octal input/output, logical operations,
and base conversion to/from decimal was available.

Although bases other than 8 and 10 were not supported, this made the Model II very practical for applications that needed to manipulate data formatted in octal by other computers (e.g., the IBM 7090).

==Model I==

The IBM 1620 Model I (commonly called &quot;1620&quot; from 1959 until the 1962 introduction of the Model II) was the original. It was produced as inexpensively as possible, to keep the price low.
* It lacked conventional ALU hardware: arithmetic was done by memory table lookup. Addition and subtraction used a 100-digit table (at address 00300..00399). Multiplication used a 200-digit table (at address 00100..00299). The basic machine used software subroutines for division, although optional divide hardware could be installed that used a repeated subtraction algorithm. Floating point arithmetic instructions were an available option (if the divide option was installed).
* The first 20,000 decimal digits of magnetic-core memory were internal to the CPU itself (which reduced the floor space requirements of the basic system). Expansion to either 40,000 or 60,000 decimal digits required the addition of an IBM 1623 Memory unit. The memory cycle time was 20 μs (that is, the memory speed was 50 kHz = 1/20 of a MHz). A Memory Address Register Storage (MARS) Core memory read, clear, or write operation took 2 μs and each write operation was automatically (but not necessarily immediately) preceded by a read or clear operation of the same &quot;register(s)&quot; during the 20 μs memory cycle.
* The central processor clock speed was 1 MHz, which was divided by 20 by a 10-position ring counter to provide the system timing and control signals. Instructions took eight memory cycles (160 μs) to fetch and a variable number of memory cycles to execute. Indirect addressing added four memory cycles (80 μs) for each level of indirection.
* It weighed about .

==Model II==
The IBM 1620 Model II (commonly called simply the Model II) was a vastly improved implementation, compared to the original Model I. The Model II was introduced in 1962.

* It had basic ALU hardware for addition and subtraction, but multiplication was still done by in-core memory table lookup, using a 200-digit table (at address 00100..00299). Memory addresses at address 00300..00399 were freed by the replacement of the addition table with hardware, resulting in storage of two selectable &quot;bands&quot; of seven five-digit index registers.
* Rather than being an available option, as in the Model I, the divide hardware using a repeated subtraction algorithm, was built in. Floating-point arithmetic was an available option, as were octal input/output, logical operations, and base conversion to/from decimal instructions.
* The entire core memory was in the IBM 1625 memory unit. Memory cycle time was halved compared to the Model I&#x27;s (internal or 1623 memory unit), to 10 μs (i.e., the cycle speed was raised to 100 kHz) by using faster cores. A Memory Address Register Storage (MARS) core memory read, clear, or write operation took 1.5 μs and each write operation was automatically (but not necessarily immediately) preceded by a read or clear operation of the same &quot;register(s)&quot; during the 10 μs memory cycle.
* The processor clock speed was also doubled, to 2 MHz, which was still divided by 20 by a 10 position ring counter to provide the system timing/control signals. The fetch/execute mechanism was completely redesigned, optimizing the timing and allowing partial fetches when the P or Q fields were not needed. Instructions took either 1, 4, or 6 memory cycles (10 μs, 40 μs, or 60 μs) to fetch and a variable number of memory cycles to execute. Indirect addressing added three memory cycles (30 μs) for each level of indirection. Indexed addressing added five memory cycles (50 μs) for each level of indexing. Indirect and indexed addressing could be combined at any level of indirection or indexing.

==Models I and II consoles==
While the &quot;Lower console&quot; for both the Model 1 and the Model 2 IBM 1620 systems had the same lamps and switches, the &quot;Upper console&quot; of the pair were partly different.

===Upper console===
The balance of the &quot;Upper console&quot; was the same on both models:

* Operation Register 25 lamps
* Memory Buffer Register 30 lamps
* Memory Address Register 25 lamps
* Memory Address Register Display Selector – Rotary switch, 12 positions

===Lower console===
* Emergency Off Pull Pull switch
* Check Condition status lamps/switches 15 lamps &amp; 5 toggle switches
* Program Switches 4 toggle switches
* Console operator lights/switches 13 lights, 1 power switch, and 12 buttons

===Console typewriter===
The &quot;Model I&quot; console typewriter was a modified Model B1, interfaced by a set of relays, and it typed at only 10 characters per second.

There were a set of instructions that wrote to the typewriter, or read from it. The general RN (read numeric) and WN (write numeric) instructions had assembly language mnemonics that supplied the &quot;device&quot; code in the second address field, and the control code in the low-order digit of the second address field.

* WNTY: Write Numeric TYpewriter: each memory location contained a 6-bit character in the range of 000000 to 001001; with this instruction, each memory location was rendered as one of the characters &quot;0&quot; through &quot;9&quot;.
* WATY: Write Alphanumeric TYpewriter: each pair of memory locations contained two 6-bit digits that appeared on the typewriter as one of the 64 characters that could appear. 
* RNTY: Read Numeric TYpewriter: read a numeric value from the typewriter keyboard
* RATY: Read Alphanumeric TYpewriter: read a character from the keyboard and store as a two-digit alphanumeric character
* TBTY: TaB TYpewriter. Tabs had to be set manually, so this instruction was rarely used.
* RCTY: Return Carriage TYpewriter: Caused the typewriter to do what we now call a CR/LF sequence.

To simplify input and output, there were two instructions:
* TNS: Transmit Numeric Strip: Converts a two-digit alphanumeric representation of &quot;0&quot; to &quot;9&quot; to a single-digit representation
* TNF: Transmit Numeric Fill: Converts a single-digit representation of digits to a sequence to two-digit alphanumeric sequence that represented &quot;0&quot; through &quot;9&quot;

The &quot;Model II&quot; used a modified Selectric typewriter, which could type at 15.5 cps a 55% improvement.

==Peripherals==
Available peripherals were:
* IBM 1621 Paper tape reader
* IBM 1622 Punch card reader/punch
* IBM 1624 Paper tape punch (sat inside the 1621 on a shelf)
* IBM 1626 Plotter controller
* IBM 1627 Plotter
* IBM 1311 Disk drive: Model 3 master drive controlling up to 3–Model 2 slave drives.
* IBM 1443 Printer, flying type bar
* IBM 1405 Disk Drive available as RPQ (request price quotation)

The standard &quot;output&quot; mechanism for a program was to punch cards, which was faster than using the typewriter. These punched cards were then fed through an IBM 407 mechanical calculator which could be programmed to print two cards, thus being able to use the additional print columns available on the 407. All output was synchronous, and the processor paused while the Input/Output (I/O) device produced the output, so the typewriter output could completely dominate program running time.

A faster output option, the IBM 1443 printer was introduced May 6, 1963, and its 150–600 lines/minute capability was available for use with either model of the 1620.

It could print either 120 or 144 columns. The character width was fixed, so it was the paper size that changed; the printer printed 10 characters to the inch, so a printer could print a maximum of 12 inches or 14.4 inches of text. In addition, the printer had a buffer, so the I/O delay for the processor was reduced. However, the print instruction would block if the line had not completed.

==Operating procedures==
The &quot;operating system&quot; for the computer constituted the human operator, who would use controls on the computer console, which consisted of a front panel and typewriter, to load programs from the available bulk storage media such as decks of punched cards or rolls of paper tape that were kept in cabinets nearby. Later, the model 1311 disc storage device attached to the computer enabled a reduction in the fetch and carry of card decks or paper tape rolls, and a simple &quot;Monitor&quot; operating system could be loaded to help in selecting what to load from disc.

A standard preliminary was to clear the computer memory of any previous user&#x27;s detritus being magnetic cores, the memory retained its last state even if the power had been switched off. This was effected by using the console facilities to load a simple computer program via typing its machine code at the console typewriter, running it, and stopping it. This was not challenging as only one instruction was needed such as 160001000000, loaded at address zero and following. This meant &quot;transmit field immediate&quot; (the 16: two-digit op-codes) to address 00010 the immediate constant field having the value 00000 (five-digit operand fields, the second being from address 11 back to 7), decrementing source and destination addresses until such time as a digit with a &quot;flag&quot; was copied. This was the normal machine code means of copying a constant of up to five digits. The digit string was addressed at its low-order end and extended through lower addresses until a digit with a flag marked its end. But for this instruction, no flag would ever be found because the source digits had shortly before been overwritten by digits lacking a flag. Thus the operation would roll around memory (even overwriting itself) filling it with all zeroes until the operator grew tired of watching the roiling of the indicator lights and pressed the &quot;Instant Stop - Single Cycle Execute&quot; button. Each 20,000 digit module of memory took just under one second to clear. On the 1620 II this instruction would &quot;NOT&quot; work (due to certain optimizations in the implementation). Instead there was a button on the console called &quot;Modify&quot; which when pressed together with the &quot;Check Reset&quot; button, when the computer was in Manual mode, would set the computer in a mode that would clear all of memory in a tenth of one second regardless of how much memory you had; when you pressed &quot;Start&quot;. It also stopped automatically when memory was cleared, instead of requiring the operator to stop it.

Other than typing machine code at the console, a program could be loaded via either the paper tape reader, the card reader, or any disk drive. Loading from either tape or disk required first typing a &quot;bootstrap&quot; routine on the console typewriter.

The card reader made things easier because it had a special &quot;Load&quot; button to signify that the first card was to be read into the computer&#x27;s memory (starting at address 00000) and executed (as opposed to just starting the card reader, which then awaits commands from the computer to read cards) this is the &quot;bootstrap&quot; process that gets into the computer just enough code to read in the rest of the code (from the card reader, or disc, or...) that constitutes the loader that will read in and execute the desired program.

Programs were prepared ahead of time, offline, on paper tape or punched cards. But usually the programmers were allowed to run the programs personally, hands-on, instead of submitting them to operators as was the case with mainframe computers at that time. And the console typewriter allowed entering data and getting output in an interactive fashion, instead of just getting the normal printed output from a blind batch run on a pre-packaged data set. As well, there were four program switches on the console whose state a running program could test and so have its behavior directed by its user. The computer operator could also stop a running program (or it may come to a deliberately programmed stop) then investigate or modify the contents of memory: being decimal-based, this was quite easy; even floating-point numbers could be read at a glance. Execution could then be resumed, from any desired point. Aside from debugging, scientific programming is typically exploratory, by contrast to commercial data processing where the same work is repeated on a regular schedule.

===Console===

The most important items on the 1620&#x27;s console were a pair of buttons labeled &quot;Insert&quot; &amp; &quot;Release&quot;, and the console typewriter.
* Insert – Pressing this key with the computer in &quot;Manual&quot; mode reset the program counter (in the MARS core memory) to zero, switched the computer into &quot;Automatic&quot; and &quot;Insert&quot; modes, and simulated the execution of a Read Numeric from Typewriter to address zero (unlocked the typewriter keyboard, shifted the typewriter into numeric mode). Note: unlike a real Read Numeric from Typewriter, &quot;Insert&quot; mode would force a &quot;Release&quot; after 100 digits had been typed to prevent overwriting the arithmetic tables.
* Release – Pressing this key while doing a Read from the Typewriter terminated the Read, switched the computer into &quot;Manual&quot; mode, and locked the typewriter keyboard.
The typewriter is used for operator input/output, both as the main console control of the computer and for program controlled input/output. Later models of the typewriter had a special key marked &quot;R-S&quot; that combined the functions of the console &quot;Release&quot; &amp; &quot;Start&quot; buttons (this would be considered equivalent to an &quot;Enter&quot; key on a modern keyboard). Note: several keys on the typewriter did not generate input characters, these included &quot;Tab&quot; and &quot;Return&quot; (the 1620s alphameric and numeric BCD character sets lacked character codes for these keys).

The next most important items on the console were the buttons labeled &quot;Start&quot;, &quot;Stop-SIE&quot;, and &quot;Instant Stop-SCE&quot;.

* Start – Pressing this key with the computer in &quot;Manual&quot; mode switched the computer to &quot;Automatic&quot; mode (causing the computer to begin executing at the address in the program counter).
* Stop-SIE – Pressing this key with the computer in &quot;Automatic&quot; mode switched the computer to &quot;Manual&quot; mode when the currently executing instruction completes. Pressing this key with the computer in &quot;Manual&quot; mode switched the computer into &quot;Automatic&quot; mode for one instruction.
* Instant Stop-SCE – Pressing this key with the computer in &quot;Automatic&quot; mode switched the computer into &quot;Automatic/Manual&quot; mode at the end of the current memory cycle. Pressing this key with the computer in &quot;Manual&quot; or &quot;Automatic/Manual&quot; mode switched the computer into &quot;Automatic/Manual&quot; mode and executed one memory cycle.
For program debugging there were the buttons labeled &quot;Save&quot; &amp; &quot;Display MAR&quot;.
* Save – Pressing this key with the computer in &quot;Manual&quot; mode saved the program counter into another register in the MARS core memory and activated &quot;Save&quot; mode.
When a Branch Back instruction was executed in &quot;Save&quot; mode, it copied the saved value back to the program counter (instead of copying the return address register as it normally did) and deactivated &quot;Save&quot; mode.

This was used during debugging to remember where the program had been stopped to allow it to be resumed after the debugging instructions that the operator had typed on the typewriter had finished. Note: the MARS register used to save the program counter in was also used by the &quot;Multiply&quot; instruction, so this instruction and the &quot;Save&quot; mode were incompatible! However, there was no need to use multiply in debugging code, so this was not considered to be a problem.

* Display MAR – Pressing this key with the computer in &quot;Manual&quot; mode displayed the selected MARS register and the contents of the memory at that address on the console lamps.

All of main memory could be cleared from the console by entering and executing a transfer instruction from address to address +1, this would overwrite any word mark, that would normally stop a transfer instruction, and wrap around at the end of memory. After a moment, pressing Stop would stop the transfer instruction and memory would be cleared.

===IBM 1621/1624 Paper Tape reader/punch===
The IBM 1621 Paper Tape Reader could read a maximum of 150 characters per second;The IBM 1624 Paper Tape Punch could output a maximum of 15 characters/second.

Both units:
* could handle eight-channel paper tape
* performed self-checking to ensure accuracy
* accommodated both numerical and alphabetic information in single-character coding.

The 1621 Tape Reader and 1624 Tape Punch included controls for:
* Power switch – If &quot;on&quot; the unit reader is powered up when the CPU is powered on.
* Reel-Strip switch – This switch selects whether Reels or Strips of paper tape are used.
* Reel power key – Applies power to the supply and takeup Reels to position the tape for reading and places the reader in ready state.
* Non-process runout key – Feeds tape until the reader is empty and takes the reader out of ready state.

===IBM 1622 Card reader/punch===
The IBM 1622 Card reader/punch could:

* read a maximum of 250 cards per minute
* punch a maximum of 125 cards/minute.

The 1622&#x27;s controls were divided into three groups: 3 punch control rocker switches, 6 buttons, and 2 reader control rocker switches.

Punch Rocker switches:
* Punch Off/Punch On – This rocker turned the punch mechanism off or on.
* Select No-Stop/Select Stop – This rocker selected if mispunched cards (deposited in the punch error select stacker instead of the normal punch stacker) let the punch continue or caused a check stop.
* Non-Process Runout – This rocker with the punch hopper empty, &quot;ranout&quot; remaining cards from the punch mechanism.

Buttons:
* Start punch – Pressing this key with the punch idle and on, started the punch. The computer could now punch cards.
* Stop punch – Pressing this key with the punch active, stopped the punch.
* Check Reset – Pressing this key reset all &quot;error check&quot; conditions in the reader and punch.
* Load – Pressing this key with the reader idle and on and the computer in &quot;Manual&quot; mode started the reader, reset the program counter (in the MARS core memory) to zero, read one card into the reader&#x27;s buffer and checked the card for errors, and simulated the execution of a Read Numeric from Card Reader to address zero (reading the 80 characters of the reader&#x27;s buffer into memory addresses 00000 to 00079), then switched the computer into &quot;Automatic&quot; mode (starting execution at the address in the program counter).
* Stop reader – Pressing this key with the reader active, stopped the reader.
* Start reader – Pressing this key with the reader idle and on, started the reader and read one card into the reader&#x27;s buffer and checked the card for errors. The computer could now read cards.

Reader Rocker switches:
* Non-Process Runout – This rocker with the read hopper empty, &quot;ranout&quot; remaining cards from the reader mechanism.
* Reader Off/Reader On – This rocker turned the reader mechanism off or on.
===Disk drives===

The 1311 Disk drive controls.

* Module light – This light shows the drive number. When it lights the drive is ready for access.
* Compare-Disable key-switch – When this (Master only) switch is in the ON position and the Write Address button is pressed a full track write may be performed without comparing addresses. Used to format disk packs.
* Select Lock light – When this (Master only) lights one or more of the drives has malfunctioned. No disk access can be performed.
* Write Address button/light – This (Master only) key controls writing sector addresses. Pressing it toggles this enable and turns its light on/off.
* Enable-Disable toggle-switch – This switch enables or disables access to the drive. If this switch is disabled on the Master, all drives are disabled regardless of the state of their own switches. Also controls the disk usage time meter(s).
* Start Stop button – Pressing this key starts or stops the disk drive motor. The motor must be stopped to open the lid and change disk packs.


===General===
The FORTRAN II compiler and SPS assembler were somewhat cumbersome to use by modern standards, however, with repetition, the procedure soon became automatic and you no longer thought about the details involved.

GOTRAN was much simpler to use, as it directly produced an executable in memory. However it was not a complete FORTRAN implementation.

To improve this various third-party FORTRAN compilers were developed. One of these was developed by Bob Richardson, a programmer at Rice University, the FLAG (FORTRAN Load-and-Go) compiler. Once the FLAG deck had been loaded, all that was needed was to load the source deck to get directly to the output deck; FLAG stayed in memory, so it was immediately ready to accept the next source deck. This was particularly convenient for dealing with many small jobs. For instance, at Auckland University a batch job processor for student assignments (typically, many small programs not requiring much memory) chugged through a class lot rather faster than the later IBM 1130 did with its disk-based system. The compiler remained in memory, and the student&#x27;s program had its chance in the remaining memory to succeed or fail, though a bad failure might disrupt the resident compiler.

Later, disk storage devices were introduced, removing the need for working storage on card decks. The various decks of cards constituting the compiler and loader no longer need be fetched from their cabinets but could be stored on disk and loaded under the control of a simple disk-based operating system: a lot of activity becomes less visible, but still goes on.

Since the punch side of the card reader-punch did not edge-print the characters across the top of the cards, one had to take any output decks over to a separate machine, typically an IBM 557 Alphabetic Interpreter, that read each card and printed its contents along the top. Listings were usually generated by punching a listing deck and using an IBM 407 accounting machine to print the deck.

==Hardware implementation==

Most of the logic circuitry of the 1620 was a type of resistor–transistor logic (RTL) using &quot;drift&quot; transistors (a type of transistor invented by Herbert Kroemer in 1953) for their speed, that IBM referred to as Saturated Drift Transistor Resistor Logic (SDTRL). Other IBM circuit types used were referred to as: &quot;Alloy&quot; (some logic, but mostly various non-logic functions, named for the kind of transistors used), &quot;CTRL&quot; (another type of RTL, but slower than &quot;SDTRL&quot;), &quot;CTDL&quot; (a type of diode–transistor logic (DTL)), and &quot;DL&quot; (another type of RTL, named for the kind of transistor used, &quot;drift&quot; transistors). Typical logic levels of all these circuits (&quot;S Level&quot;) were high: 0 V to -0.5 V, low: -6 V to -12 V. Transmission line logic levels of &quot;SDTRL&quot; circuits (&quot;C Level&quot;) were high: 1 V, low: -1 V. Relay circuits used either of two logic levels (&quot;T Level&quot;) high: 51 V to 46 V, low: 16 V to 0 V or (&quot;W Level&quot;) high: 24 V, low: 0 V.

These circuits were constructed of individual discrete components mounted on single sided paper-epoxy printed circuit boards with a 16-pin gold-plated edge connector, that IBM referred to as &quot;SMS&quot; cards (&quot;Standard Modular System&quot;). The amount of logic on one card was similar to that in one 7400 series SSI or simpler MSI package (e.g., 3 to 5 logic gates or a couple of flip-flops).

These boards were inserted into sockets mounted in door-like racks which IBM referred to as &quot;gates&quot;. The machine had the following &quot;gates&quot; in its basic configuration:
* &quot;Gate A&quot; Forward hinged gate that swings out the back for access, after &quot;Gate B&quot;.
* &quot;Gate B&quot; Rear hinged gate that swings out the back for access.
* &quot;Gate C&quot; Slides out back for access. Console Typewriter interface. Mostly relay logic.
* &quot;Gate D&quot; Slides out back for access. Standard I/O interface.

There were two different types of core memory used in the 1620:
* Main memory
** Coincident Current X-Y Line addressing
*** 20,000, 40,000, or 60,000 Digits
** 12-bit, even-odd Digit Pair
** 12 one-bit planes in each module, 1 to 3 modules
*** 10,000 cores per plane
* Memory Address Register Storage (MARS) memory
** Word Line addressing
*** 16 Words, minimum of eight used in basic configuration
*** Single Word read, multiple Word clear/write
** 24-bit, five-digit decimal Memory Address (no 8 - Ten Thousand bit stored)
** 1 plane
*** 384 cores
The address decoding logic of the Main memory also used two planes of 100 pulse transformer cores per module to generate the X-Y Line half-current pulses.

There were two models of the 1620, each having totally different hardware implementations:
* IBM 1620 I
* IBM 1620 II

==Development history==
===A computer for the &quot;small scientific market&quot;===
In 1958 IBM assembled a team at the Poughkeepsie, New York development laboratory to study the &quot;small scientific market&quot;. Initially the team consisted of Wayne Winger (Manager), Robert C. Jackson, and William H. Rhodes.

====Requirements and design====
The competing computers in this market were the Librascope LGP-30 and the Bendix G-15; both were drum memory machines. IBM&#x27;s smallest computer at the time was the popular IBM 650, a fixed word length decimal machine that also used drum memory. All three used vacuum tubes. It was concluded that IBM could offer nothing really new in that area. To compete effectively would require use of technologies that IBM had developed for larger computers, yet the machine would have to be produced at the least possible cost.

To meet this objective, the team set the following requirements:
* Core memory
* Restricted instruction set
** No divide or floating point instructions, use subroutines in the &quot;general program package&quot;
* Wherever possible replace hardware with existing logical machine functions
** No arithmetic circuits, use tables in core memory
* Least expensive Input/Output possible
** No punch cards, use paper tape
** No printer, use operator&#x27;s console typewriter

====The prototype====
The team expanded with the addition of Anne Deckman, Kelly B. Day, William Florac, and James Brenza. They completed the (codename) CADET prototype in the spring of 1959.

Meanwhile, the San Jose, California facility was working on a proposal of its own. IBM could only build one of the two and the Poughkeepsie proposal won because &quot;the San Jose version is top of the line and not expandable, while your proposal has all kinds of expansion capability - never offer a machine that cannot be expanded&quot;.

Management was not entirely convinced that core memory could be made to work in small machines, so Gerry Ottaway was loaned to the team to design a drum memory as a backup. During acceptance testing by the Product Test Lab, repeated core memory failures were encountered and it looked likely that management&#x27;s predictions would come true. However, at the last minute it was found that the muffin fan used to blow hot air through the core stack was malfunctioning, causing the core to pick up noise pulses and fail to read correctly. After the fan problem was fixed, there were no further problems with the core memory and the drum memory design effort was discontinued as unnecessary.

====Transferred to San Jose for production====
Following announcement of the IBM 1620 on October 21, 1959, due to an internal reorganization of IBM, it was decided to transfer the computer from the Data Processing Division at Poughkeepsie (large scale mainframe computers only) to the General Products Division at San Jose (small computers and support products only) for manufacturing.

Following transfer to San Jose, someone there jokingly suggested that the code name CADET actually stood for &quot;Can&#x27;t Add, Doesn&#x27;t Even Try&quot;, referring to the use of addition tables in memory rather than dedicated addition circuitry (and SDTRL actually stood for &quot;Sold Down The River Logic&quot; became a common joke among the CEs). This stuck and became very well known among the user community.

===Implementation &quot;levels&quot;===
* Model I
** Level A; prototype.
*** All flip-flops in the design were transistorized versions of the original &quot;Eccles-Jordan trigger circuit&quot;. While this machine was fully functional, it was found that the capacitor coupling used in these proved troublesome in the noisy signal environment of relays and timing cam driven switches used to drive the console typewriter. This necessitated a &quot;complete redesign&quot; of the machine to use &quot;S-R&quot; flip-flops instead (except for two triggers used to generate clocks for the &quot;S-R&quot; flip-flops). However usage of the term &quot;Trigger&quot; was retained in all the documentation when referring to a flip-flop, as it was IBM&#x27;s conventional term (as &quot;alphamerics&quot; was their term for alphanumerics).
*** This is the only level using a one piece vertical control panel, when the design was transferred from Poughkeepsie to San Jose it was redesigned to the two piece angled control panel used on all production models.
** Level B; first production.
*** This is the only level using a burnished aluminum lower control panel, later levels finished this panel with white.
** Level C; introduction of 1622 card reader/punch.
** Level D; introduction of 1311 disk drives and addition of optional &quot;Gate J&quot; containing disk control logic.
** Level E; introduction of Floating Point option.
** Level F
** Level G; introduction of Interrupt option (needed for IBM 1710).
*** Did not support BT &amp; BB subroutines in interrupt code!
*** Disk control logic on &quot;Gate J&quot; logic merged into &quot;Gate A&quot; &amp; &quot;Gate B&quot;.
**** Made possible because much of logic was compacted using cards designed for the Model II.
** Level H; improved Interrupt option that supported BT &amp; BB subroutines in interrupt code.
*** Final version of the Model I.
* Model II (no information on &quot;Levels&quot; available at this time)
:: The 1620 Model II introduced basic ALU hardware for addition and subtraction (making &quot;Can&#x27;t Add, Doesn&#x27;t Even Try&quot; no longer applicable) and index registers.
* Model III
** Work was begun on a 1620 Model III but the project was quickly canceled as IBM wanted to promote sales of their new System/360 and discontinue the old lines.

===Patents===
==Notable uses==
An IBM 1620 model II was used by Vearl N. Huff, NASA Headquarters (FOB 10B, Washington DC) to program a three-dimensional simulation in Fortran of the tethered Gemini capsule Agena rocket module two-body problem at a time when it was not completely understood if it was safe to tether two objects together in space due to possible elastic tether induced collisions. The same computer was also used to simulate the orbits of the Gemini flights, producing printer-art charts of each orbit. These simulation were run over-night and the data examined the next day.

In 1963 an IBM 1620 was installed at IIT Kanpur providing the kicker for India&#x27;s software prowess.

In 1964 at the Australian National University, Martin Ward used an IBM 1620 model I to calculate the order of the Janko group &quot;J1&quot;.

In 1966 the ITU produced an explanatory film on a 1963 system for typesetting by computer at the &quot;Washington Evening Star&quot;, using an IBM 1620 and a Linofilm phototypesetter.

In 1964 an IBM 1620 was installed at The University of Iceland, becoming the first computer in Iceland.

==Use in film and television==
* A radio program was developed by DJ Rege Cordic for KDKA Pittsburgh, based on a baseball game simulator developed by John Burgeson of IBM and his brother, Paul, then an ensign in the U.S. Navy. This program was used in numerous demonstration events in the years 1960 to 1963 as an example of the power of computers to perform simulation exercises. 
* The fictional computer Colossus of &quot;&quot; used about a dozen scrapped 1620 front panels purchased on the surplus market, in various orientations.
* A similar arrangement was used in a late TV episode and a movie of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; to portray a THRUSH supercomputer.

==Anecdotes==
===CADET===
Many in the user community recall the 1620 being referred to as &quot;CADET&quot;, jokingly meaning &quot;Can&#x27;t Add, Doesn&#x27;t Even Try&quot;, referring to the use of addition tables in memory rather than dedicated addition circuitry.

See development history for an explanation of all three known interpretations of the machine&#x27;s code name.

The internal code name CADET was selected for the machine. One of the developers says that this stood for &quot;Computer with ADvanced Economic Technology&quot;, however others recall it as simply being one half of &quot;SPACE - CADET&quot;, where SPACE was the internal code name of the IBM 1401 machine, also then under development.

<text>The IBM 1401 is a variable-wordlength decimal computer that was announced by IBM on October 5, 1959. The first member of the highly successful IBM 1400 series, it was aimed at replacing unit record equipment for processing data stored on punched cards and at providing peripheral services for larger computers. The 1401 is considered by IBM to be the Ford Model-T of the computer industry due to its mass appeal. Over 12,000 units were produced and many were leased or resold after they were replaced with newer technology. The 1401 was withdrawn on February 8, 1971.

==History==

The 1401 project evolved from an IBM project named &quot;World Wide Accounting Machine&quot; (WWAM), which in turn was a reaction to the success of the Bull Gamma 3.

The 1401 was used as an independent system in conjunction with IBM punched card equipment. It was also operated as auxiliary equipment to IBM 700 or 7000 series systems.

Monthly rental for 1401 configurations started at US$2,500 (worth about $ today). Demand exceeded expectations.

&quot;IBM was pleasantly surprised (perhaps shocked) to receive 5,200 orders in just the first five weeks – more than predicted for the entire life of the machine!&quot; By late 1961, the 2000 units installed in the USA were about one quarter of all electronic stored-program computers by all manufacturers. The number of installed 1401s peaked above 10,000 in the mid-1960s. &quot;In all, by the mid-1960s nearly half of all computer systems in the world were 1401-type systems.&quot; The system was marketed until February 1971.

Commonly used by small businesses as their primary data processing machines, the 1401 was also frequently used as an off-line peripheral controller for mainframe computers. In such installations, with an IBM 7090 for example, the mainframe computers used only magnetic tape for input-output. It was the 1401 that transferred input data from slow peripherals (such as the IBM 1402 Card Read-Punch) to tape, and transferred output data from tape to the card punch, the IBM 1403 Printer, or other peripherals. This allowed the mainframe&#x27;s throughput to not be limited by the speed of a card reader or printer. 
(For more information, see spooling.) Some later installations (e.g., at NASA) included the 1401 as a front-end peripherals controller to an IBM 7094 in a Direct Coupled System (DCS).

Elements within IBM, notably John Haanstra, an executive in charge of 1401 deployment, supported its continuation in larger models for evolving needs (e.g., the IBM 1410) but the 1964 decision at the top to focus resources on the System/360 ended these efforts rather suddenly.

IBM was facing a competitive threat from the Honeywell 200 and the 360&#x27;s incompatibility with the 1401 design. IBM pioneered the use of microcode emulation, in the form of ROM, so that some System/360 models could run 1401 programs.

Due to its popularity and mass-production, the IBM 1401 was often considered to be the first electronic mainframe computer to be introduced in various countries, such as Singapore (1963; for the Central Provident Fund Board) and South Korea (1967; for the Economic Planning Board). During the 1970s, IBM installed many 1401s in India and Pakistan where they were in use well into the 1980s.

Two 1401 systems have been restored to operating order at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.

==Architecture==
Each alphanumeric character in the 1401 is encoded by six bits, called &quot;B,A,8,4,2,1&quot;. The &quot;B,A&quot; bits are called &quot;zone&quot; bits and the &quot;8,4,2,1&quot; bits are called &quot;numeric&quot; bits, terms taken from the IBM 80 column punched card.

* For digits 1 through 9, the bits &quot;B,A&quot; are zero, the digit BCD encoded in bits &quot;8,4,2,1&quot;. Digit 0 is encoded &quot;8,2&quot;.
* For alphabetic characters the setting of bits is derived from the zone and digit punches of the IBM 80 column punched card character code: &quot;B,A&quot; from &quot;12&quot;, &quot;B&quot; from &quot;11&quot;, and &quot;A&quot; from &quot;0&quot;; the setting of bits &quot;8,4,2,1&quot; from BCD encoding of the 1 through 9 punches. Thus the letter A, &quot;12,1&quot; in the punched card character code, is encoded &quot;B,A,1&quot;.
* Encodings of punched card characters with two or more digit punches can be found in the character and op codes table.

IBM called the 1401&#x27;s character code BCD (&quot;binary-coded decimal&quot;), even though that term describes only the decimal digit encoding. The 1401&#x27;s alphanumeric collating sequence is compatible with the punched card collating sequence.

Associated with each memory location are two other bits, called &quot;C&quot; for odd parity check and &quot;M&quot; for word mark. &quot;M&quot; is present in memory but not on punched cards, and has to be set using special machine instructions; when printing memory it is typically displayed by underlining the character. &quot;C&quot; is calculated automatically and is also not present on punched cards.

Each memory location then, has the following bits:

&quot;C B A 8 4 2 1 M&quot;

The 1401 was available in six memory configurations: 1,400, 2,000, 4,000, 8,000, 12,000, or 16,000 characters. Each character is addressable, addresses ranging from 0 through 15999. A very small number of 1401s were expanded to 32,000 characters by special request.

Some operations use specific memory locations (those locations are not reserved and can be used for other purposes). &quot;Read a card&quot; stores the 80 columns of data from a card into memory locations 001–080. Index registers 1, 2 and 3 are in memory locations 087–089, 092-094 and 097-099 respectively. &quot;Punch a card&quot; punches the contents of memory locations 101-180 into a card. &quot;Write a line&quot; prints the contents of memory locations 201–332.

The 1401&#x27;s instruction format is

 Opcode
 with [A-or-I-or-unit-address [B-address]] [modifier]
 word mark

Opcodes are one character. Memory addresses (&quot;I&quot; a branch target, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; data) and unit address are three characters. The opcode modifier is one character. Instruction length is then 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 8 characters. Most instructions have to be followed by a word mark (a requirement commonly met by the word mark with the opcode of the next instruction).

See Character and op codes for a list of operations.

A three-character memory address in an instruction is an encoding of a five-digit memory address. The three low-order digits of the five-digit address, 000 to 999, are specified by the numeric bits of the three characters. The zone bits of the high-order character specify an increment as follows: &quot;A&quot; 1000, &quot;B&quot; 2000, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;A&quot; together 3000, giving an addressability of 4,000 memory locations. The zone bits of the low-order character specify increments of 4000, 8000, or 12000, to address 16,000 memory locations (with an IBM 1406 Storage Unit). For example, the three-character address &quot;I99&quot; is a reference to memory location 3000 + 999, or 3999.

The zone bits of the middle character of a three-character memory address can specify one of three index registers, one of many optional features.

Operands referenced by the A-address and B-address can be: a single memory location, a variable-length field, or a variable-length record. Variable-length fields are addressed at their low-order (highest-addressed) position, their length defined by a word mark set at their high-order (lowest-addressed) position. When an operation such as addition is performed, the processor begins at the low-order position of the two fields and works its way to the high-order, just as a person would when adding with pencil and paper.

The only limit on the length of such fields is the available memory. Instructions applicable to variable-length fields include: &quot;Add&quot;, &quot;Subtract&quot;, &quot;Multiply&quot;, &quot;Divide&quot;, &quot;Compare&quot;, &quot;Move Characters to A or B Word Mark&quot;, &quot;Move Characters and Edit&quot;. One or more adjacent variable-length fields can make up a variable-length record. A variable-length record is addressed at its high-order position, its length defined by a group-mark character with a word mark or a record-mark character in its low-order position. The instruction &quot;Move Characters Record or Group Mark&quot; can be used to assemble a block of records. A variable-length record, or block of records, to be written to magnetic tape is addressed at its high-order position, its length defined by a group-mark character with a word mark immediately following its low-order position.

A sequence of operations on adjacent fields can be &quot;chained&quot;, using the addresses left in the address registers by the previous operation. For example, addition of adjacent data fields might be coded as codice_1, codice_2, codice_3. With chaining, this can be coded as codice_1, codice_5, codice_5 - omitting data address from the second and third instructions.

===IBM 1401G===
The IBM 1401G was sold in six models: (G1 and G11: 1,400 &quot;storage positions&quot;; G2 and G12 for 2,000; G3 and G13 for 4,000).
 One difference between the 1401 and 1401G is how the reader-punch is controlled.

==Booting and sample program==
When the LOAD button on the 1402 Card Read-Punch is pressed, a card is read into memory locations 001–080, a word mark is set in location 001 to indicate that it is an executable instruction, the word marks in locations 002-080 (if any) are cleared, and execution starts with the instruction at location 001. That is always the &quot;Set Word Mark&quot;, to set word marks on the two following words (instructions). A single &quot;Set Word Mark&quot; instruction can set two word marks but requires one word mark to have been on itself, so a sequence of these instructions are needed, which incrementally set word marks in the program&#x27;s code or data, and set word marks for subsequent &quot;Set Word Mark&quot; instructions. Execution of instructions in the card continues, setting word marks, loading the program into memory, and then branching to the program&#x27;s start address. To read subsequent cards, an explicit &quot;Read&quot; command (opcode codice_7) must be executed as the last instruction on every card to get the new card&#x27;s contents into locations 001–080. Note that the word marks are not erased when the &quot;Read&quot; command is executed, but are kept as-is for the next card read in. This is convenient, because much of what the first few cards do is set word marks in the proper locations; having the first half dozen or so word marks set means the programmer does not need to set those word marks again.
One-card programs can be written for various tasks. Commonly available were a one-card program to print the deck of cards following it, and another to duplicate a deck to the card punch. See Tom Van Vleck&#x27;s web site. Here is a one-card program which will print &quot;HELLO, WORLD!&quot;. Pressing LOAD (above) reads one card, and begins execution at 001 (the first codice_8). The program will automatically set its own wordmarks, assuming that the first codice_8 has a wordmark already.

:codice_10

Following conventional IBM notation, the underscores show where word marks are set in memory once the program has run; on punched cards they would not be indicated visually or present in the punched data.

The program is:
* &quot;Set Word Mark&quot; (opcode codice_8 operands 036 008). This must always be the first instruction, and one of its operands must always be 008 or else the next instruction would not have a word mark to indicate that it is an executable instruction.
* Additional &quot;Set Word Mark&quot;s. The underscores show where the word marks are after completing all codice_8 opcodes. Only word marks from 036 and further are needed for the &quot;guts&quot; of the program; word marks up through 029 are only needed for &quot;Set Word Mark&quot; instructions. Since the core of the program needs six word marks, five &quot;Set Word Mark&quot; instructions are needed in total. The reason one fewer is needed is because the final &quot;Set Word Mark&quot; does not need to waste an operand on other &quot;Set Word Marks&quot;
* &quot;Clear Storage&quot; - the rest of the print area 299-200 (opcode codice_13 operand 299)
* &quot;Clear Storage&quot; - part of the print area 332-300 (opcode codice_13 operand 332)
* &quot;Move&quot; codice_15 to the print area (opcode codice_16, operands 065 and 213. &quot;Move&quot; stops due to the word mark in location 052 (which, doing double-duty, also defines the end of the &quot;Halt&quot; and branch instruction))
* &quot;Write a Line&quot; on the printer (opcode codice_17; &quot;HELLO, WORLD!&quot; will be printed in the 13 leftmost printer positions)
* &quot;Halt&quot; (opcode codice_18)

==Hardware implementation==

Most of the logic circuitry of the 1401 is a type of diode–transistor logic (DTL), that IBM referred to as &quot;CTDL (Complemented Transistor Diode Logic)&quot;. Other IBM circuit types were referred to as: &quot;Alloy&quot; (some logic, but mostly various non-logic functions, named for the germanium-alloy transistors used), &quot;CTRL&quot; (&quot;Complemented Transistor Resistor Logic&quot;, a type of resistor–transistor logic (RTL)). Later upgrades (e.g., the TAU-9 tape interface) use a faster type of DTL using &quot;drift&quot; transistors (a type of transistor invented by Herbert Kroemer in 1953) for their speed, that IBM referred to as &quot;SDTDL (Saturated Drift Transistor Diode Logic)&quot;. Typical logic levels of these circuits were (S &amp; U Level) high: 0 V to -0.5V, low: -6 V to -12 V; (T Level) high: 6 V to 1 V, low: -5.5 V to -6 V.

These circuits are constructed of discrete components (resistors, capacitors, transistors) mounted on single-sided paper-epoxy printed circuit boards either with a 16-pin gold-plated edge connector (single wide) or with two 16-pin gold-plated edge connectors (double wide), that IBM referred to as &quot;SMS&quot; cards (Standard Modular System). The amount of logic on one card is similar to that in one 7400 series SSI or simpler MSI package (e.g., three to five logic gates or a couple of flip-flops on a single-wide card up to about twenty logic gates or four flip-flops on a double-wide card).
The SMS cards were inserted in sockets on hinged swing-out racks, that IBM referred to as &quot;gates&quot;.

The modules used were fairly delicate, compared to previous unit-record equipment, so IBM shipped them enclosed in a newly invented packing material, bubble wrap. This was one of the first widespread uses of this packing; it greatly impressed recipients, and brought great publicity to the material.

Like most machines of the day, the 1401 uses magnetic-core memory. The cores are about 1 mm in diameter and use a four-wire arrangement (x, y, sense, and inhibit).
The memory is arranged in planes of 
cores each, each core storing one bit. A stack of eight such planes store the six data bits, word mark bit, and parity bit for 4000 memory locations. Together with eight additional planes with fewer cores on them for additional storage functions, this made up a 4000-character memory module. One such module is housed within the 1401&#x27;s primary enclosure. Systems were commonly available with two, three, or four such modules. The additional modules are contained in an add-on box, the 1406 Core Memory Unit, which is about two feet square and three feet high.

Operands in memory are accessed serially, one memory location at a time, and the 1401 can read or write one memory location within its basic cycle time of 11.5 microseconds.

All instruction timings are cited in multiples of this cycle time.

==IBM 1403 printer==
The IBM 1403 printer was introduced in October 1959 with the 1401 Data Processing System. The printer was a completely new development.

==Software==
IBM software for the 1401 included:

* 1401 Symbolic Programming System assembler.
* Autocoder on Tape, a more advanced assembler, required at least 4000-character memory and four tape drives.
* Autocoder on Disk, similar to, but not compatible with, Autocoder on Tape, required at least one 1311 disk drive.
* COBOL required at least 4000-character memory and four tape drives.
* FARGO (Fourteen-o-one Automatic Report Generation Operation), a predecessor of RPG, required at least 4000-character memory.
* FORTRAN II required at least 8000-character memory; the 1401 Fortran compiler is described in Haines, L.H. (1965), below. The Fortran compiler, to generate code for small memories, used a pioneering form of interpreted &quot;p-code&quot; although its programmers had no name for what it was that they did.
* FORTRAN IV required at least 12000-character memory and either four tape drives or at least one IBM 1311 disk drive.
* RPG (Report Program Generator); Basic RPG required at least 4000-character memory.

For the IBM Catalog of 1401 software, see IBM 1400 series.
==Character and op codes==
The 1401&#x27;s operation codes are single characters. In many cases, particularly for the more common instructions, the character chosen is mnemonic for the operation: A for add, B for branch, S for subtract, etc.

The table is in Character Collating Sequence.

: Note: If Word mark bit is set, then the &quot;C&quot; bit will be opposite of shown. The &quot;C&quot; bit is determined and checked automatically by the machine - normally it is of no concern to the programmers. The only way the &quot;C&quot; bit can be entered is by manually using the switches on the Auxiliary Console. A programmer might use these switches to make quick patches while debugging.

Two of the instructions, Branch on Indicator (B) and Select Stacker (K), use a &quot;modifier&quot; operand.

===Modifiers for five-character Branch on Indicator (B) instruction===
The B opcode, if followed by a three-character operand, was a simple unconditional branch to the indicated address. If a fourth operand character was present (making five characters total including the opcode), this made it a conditional branch. This &quot;modifier&quot; character specified the condition to be tested.

===Modifiers for Select Stacker (K) instruction===
The Select Stacker (K) instruction sent commands to various devices. It was named for its relevance to the 1402 reader/punch.


==1401 culture==

In October 2006, Icelandic avant-garde musician Jóhann Jóhannsson released the album &quot;IBM 1401, A User&#x27;s Manual&quot; through music publisher 4AD. The concept is based upon work done in 1964 by his father, Jóhann Gunnarsson, chief maintenance engineer of one of the country&#x27;s first computers, and Elías Daviðsson, one of the first programmers in the country. The album was originally written for a string quartet, organ and electronics and to accompany a dance piece by long-standing collaborator friend, Erna Ómarsdóttir. For the album recording, Jóhann has rewritten it for a sixty-piece string orchestra, adding a new final movement and incorporating electronics and vintage reel-to-reel recordings of a singing 1401 found in his father&#x27;s attic.

More well-known are various demo programs to play music on transistor radios placed on the CPU and computer &quot;art&quot;, mostly kitschy pictures printed using Xs and 0s on chain printers.
Other programs would generate music by having the printer print particular groups/sequences of characters using the impact of the printer hammers to generate tones.

An IBM 1401 was the first computer introduced in Nepal for the census purpose in 1971. It took about one year to take the census of the country. At that time the population of Nepal was about 10,000,000.

==Truck-based portable version==
A truck-based IBM 1401 configured in 1960 for military use was designated a &quot;portable&quot; computer, and nicknamed a DataMobile.

<text>Friendly Persuasion is a 1956 American Civil War drama film produced and directed by William Wyler. It stars Gary Cooper, Dorothy McGuire, Anthony Perkins, Richard Eyer, Robert Middleton, Phyllis Love, Mark Richman, Walter Catlett and Marjorie Main. The screenplay by Michael Wilson was adapted from the 1945 novel &quot;The Friendly Persuasion&quot; by Jessamyn West. The movie tells the story of a Quaker family in southern Indiana during the American Civil War and the way the war tests their pacifist beliefs.

The film received positive reviews, praised for its performances, but faced some criticism for inaccuracies in portraying Quaker views. It earned $4 million at the box office, won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival and received six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture. Michael Wilson, the screenwriter, was initially uncredited due to being on the Hollywood blacklist but was later restored in 1996.

Ronald Reagan gifted the film to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, symbolizing the pursuit of peaceful solutions to conflicts.

==Plot==
In Jennings County, Indiana, in 1862, Jess Birdwell is a farmer and patriarch of the Birdwell family whose Quaker religion conflicts with his love for the worldly enjoyments of music and horse racing. Jess&#x27;s wife Eliza, a Quaker minister, is deeply religious and steadfast in her refusal to engage in violence. Jess&#x27;s daughter Mattie wants to remain a Quaker but has fallen in love with cavalry officer Gard Jordan, a love that is against her mother&#x27;s wishes. Jess&#x27;s elder son Josh is torn between his hatred of violence and a conviction that to protect his family he must join the home guard and fight the invaders. The family&#x27;s youngest member is &quot;Little&quot; Jess, who is forever at war with his mother&#x27;s pet goose. Enoch, a runaway slave, is a laborer on their farm; his children are still enslaved in the South.

The story begins as a tale of Quakers trying to maintain their faith as they go to meeting on First Day (Sunday); contrasted with the Birdwells&#x27; neighbor Sam Jordan and other members of the nearby Methodist Church. The mood shifts when the meeting is interrupted by a Union officer who asks how the Quaker men can stand by when their houses will be looted and their families terrorized by approaching Confederate troops. When confronted with the question of his being afraid to fight, Josh Birdwell responds that it might be the case. His honesty provokes the wrath of Purdy, a Quaker elder who condemns people who do not believe as he does.

Meanwhile, the Quakers try to maintain their ways, despite the temptations of amusements at a county fair, and a new organ (which Jess buys over Eliza&#x27;s opposition). On a business trip, Jess acquires a new horse from the widow Hudspeth, and defeats Sam in their weekly horse race. One day, Jess is cultivating his fields and notices a cloud of smoke on the horizon produced by the burning of buildings. Josh arrives and tells them the neighboring community has been reduced to ash and corpses. Josh believes that he must fight, a conviction that threatens to destroy the family. Eliza tells him that by turning his back to their religion he is turning his back on her, but Jess sees things a different way. Josh finds himself on the front line of the battle to stop the advance of the raiders, and only fires his gun when the man next to him is wounded. Meanwhile, Jess is reluctant to fight, only picking up a rifle and riding off towards the fighting when the family horse gallops back to the farm riderless.

When Confederates arrive at the farm, with only Eliza and the younger children present, the family and the farm are saved when Eliza greets them on the porch and welcomes them to take all the food and animals they want and feeds them in their kitchen. As Jess finds Sam Jordan dying he is bushwhacked by a &quot;Reb&quot;. He plays possum and when the Confederate soldier approaches he struggles with him and takes away his gun, but ultimately lets him go free and unhurt. He then finds Josh injured and brings him home.

==Production==
The film was in development for eight years; producer-director William Wyler brought the project to Allied Artists Pictures Corporation (formerly known as Monogram Pictures Corporation) from Paramount; Allied agreed to a $1.5 million budget for what was Wyler&#x27;s first film in color for a commercial studio. Wyler had previously shot two documentaries in color in 1944, &quot;The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress&quot; and the uncredited &quot;The Fighting Lady&quot;. In 1947, he shot the documentary, &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;, in color.

The film&#x27;s shooting location was moved from southern Indiana to a combination of a Republic studio and a San Fernando Valley estate, The film ended up costing over $3 million. The film went over budget to the point that Allied sold the foreign distribution rights to MGM to raise more funds.

Jessamyn West spent a year with the production as both story writer and as technical adviser (credited). Her novel covered a forty-year span of the Birdwell family history and was essentially plotless, so to make the movie effective, she arranged the sequences selected for filming around the Civil War vignette from the novel (altering it significantly for dramatic action) and compressed the whole into a single year, 1862, using the war as the central plot conflict. She created new characters (primarily the Jordans) to fill in for others that had to be deleted, and entirely wrote out Laban, the second eldest son in the novel, substituting a new character, Josh&#x27;s friend Caleb Cope (John Smith), as a two-scene surrogate. The character Mattie was a composite of the two surviving Birdwell daughters in the novel. Wyler wanted his brother, associate producer Robert Wyler, and author Jessamyn West to receive credit for rewriting the script (also including Wilson), but the WGA ruled that Wilson deserved sole credit for his screenplay.

Cooper expressed initial reservations to West about his character, noting that since in his previous roles &quot;&#x27;action seems to come natural to me,&#x27; the father should be shown joining the fight. &#x27;There comes a time in a picture of mine when the people watching expect me to do something,&#x27; he said. West responded he would do something: &#x27;Refrain. You will furnish your public with the refreshing picture of a strong man refraining.&#x27;&quot; Cooper followed West&#x27;s advice. He researched his role by attending West&#x27;s Quaker meeting, East Whittier Friends Church. Cooper had not wanted to play the father of grown-up children, although he was 55 in real life. He supposedly disliked the finished film and his own performance.

Dorothy McGuire was cast as Cooper&#x27;s wife after Wyler&#x27;s choice, Katharine Hepburn, declined. It was Perkins&#x27; second film, after his debut in the 1953 film &quot;The Actress&quot;; his Broadway success with &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot; in the meantime tempted him to remain on the stage, though ultimately he decided to do the film.

During production, cameras for the television documentary series &quot;Wide Wide World&quot; visited the set. According to show host Dave Garroway, it was the first live broadcast from a movie set.

==Reception==
According to Bosley Crowther, &quot;thee should be pleasured by this film&quot;, noting it is &quot;loaded with sweetness and warmth and as much cracker-barrel Americana as has been spread on the screen in some time.&quot; Crowther called Cooper and McGuire &quot;wonderfully spirited and compassionate in their finely complementary roles&quot; and said a &quot;great deal of admiration must go to Anthony Perkins&quot; for making &quot;the older son of the Birdwells a handsome, intense, and chivalrous lad.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; magazine called it &quot;the simple story of a Quaker family in Indiana back in the 1860s&quot; with &quot;just about everything in the way of comedy and drama, suspense and action&quot;; they also said &quot;figuring importantly in the way the picture plays is Dimitri Tiomkin&#x27;s conducting of his own score.&quot;

The film earned $4 million at the North American box office in 1956. However it struggled to make a profit because of its high cost.

MGM distributed outside the US and Canada. According to their records the film made $732,000, earning the studio a profit of $582,000.

The film also received mild criticism for certain inaccurate portrayals of Quaker views, such as a misunderstanding that although Quakers disliked programmed music they did value individual original expressions of it; and in meetings, Bible passages are not read verbatim but speakers recite scripture from memory and express its meaning in their own words.

==Connection with House Un-American Activities Committee testimony==
The original screenplay by Michael Wilson was changed significantly in the wake of McCarthyism. The movie script was discussed in 1951 by Michael Wilson in his testimony as an &quot;unfriendly witness&quot; at the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), and by director Frank Capra, who was seeking to dissociate himself from Wilson, who was ultimately placed on the Hollywood blacklist.

Capra, who had originally contracted Wilson to write the screenplay just after the war but then dropped the project, said that although he thought Wilson did &quot;a swell job&quot; adapting West&#x27;s book, the movie was not produced because he felt &quot;it would be a bad time to produce a picture that might be construed as being antiwar. But we let Wilson work on it until he had finished with it.&quot;

Wilson told HUAC in 1951, &quot;I feel that this committee might take the credit, or part of it at least, for the fact that &quot;The Friendly Persuasion&quot; was not produced, in view of the fact that it dealt warmly, in my opinion, with a peace-loving people.&quot;

&quot;What happened to Wilson&#x27;s pacifist script after Capra dropped it,&quot; notes film historian Joseph McBride, &quot;reflected the political climate of the Cold War. When William Wyler directed the film for Allied Artists in 1956 as &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot;, he had the story changed to make the Quaker youth (played by Anthony Perkins) become a killer. The Quakers in Wyler&#x27;s version, as Pauline Kael observed, &#x27;are there only to violate their convictions.&#x27; But some of the strength of Wilson&#x27;s conception remains, as in a scene of a crippled Union Army officer respectfully challenging the steadfast Quakers about pacifism in their meeting house.&quot;

==Ronald Reagan==
&quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; also became a footnote to world history in the 1980s when United States President Ronald Reagan made a gift of the film to Soviet general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev at one of their five summit meetings, suggesting that he view the film as symbolic of the need to find an alternative to war as a means of resolving differences between peoples. One Quaker commentator stated: &quot;&quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; seems to me to come about as close to truth and fairness as I expect to see Hollywood get in a treatment of Quakerism; I recommend it to every Quaker parent, as projecting images their children ought to see and imitate...I believe (critics have) woefully misjudged the film, on several counts: its place in American cinema, the characters and their roles, its historicity, and, not least, its value as an expression of the Peace Testimony. Here, for perhaps the only time, I think Ronald Reagan was closer to the truth when he commended the film to Gorbachev because it &#x27;shows not the tragedy of war, but the problems of pacifism, the nobility of patriotism as well as the love of peace.&#x27;&quot;

==Awards and honors==
A week before the year&#x27;s Oscar nominations were announced, the AMPAS Board of Governors introduced a rule denying an Oscar to anyone who refused to talk to a United States congressional committee. The Writers Guild of America protested the new rule and awarded Michael Wilson the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Drama.

At the 29th Academy Awards, &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; was nominated for 6 awards. Michael Wilson&#x27;s name could not appear on the ballot because he was blacklisted.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;Friendly Persuasion (Thee I Love)&quot; – Nominated
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores – Nominated

==Other adaptations==
Another adaptation of the novel was made for television in 1975, starring Richard Kiley, Shirley Knight, Clifton James and Michael O&#x27;Keefe. It was adapted by William P. Wood and directed by Joseph Sargent. This version also included material from Jessamyn West&#x27;s sequel novel, &quot;Except For Thee and Me&quot;.

<doc id="92582" wikidata="Q669592" url="?curid=92582" title="Giant (1956 film)">
<text>Giant is a 1956 American epic drama film directed by George Stevens, from a screenplay adapted by Fred Guiol and Ivan Moffat from Edna Ferber&#x27;s 1952 novel.

The film stars Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson and James Dean and features Carroll Baker, Jane Withers, Chill Wills, Mercedes McCambridge, Dennis Hopper, Sal Mineo, Rod Taylor, Elsa Cárdenas and Earl Holliman.

&quot;Giant &quot;was the last of Dean&#x27;s three films as a leading actor, and earned him his second and last Academy Award nomination – he was killed in a car crash before the film was released. His friend Nick Adams was called in to do some voice dubbing for Dean&#x27;s role.

In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

In the mid-1920s, wealthy Texas rancher Jordan &quot;Bick&quot; Benedict Jr. (Rock Hudson) travels to Maryland on a horse-buying trip. He meets socialite Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), and they marry and return to the Benedicts&#x27; Texas cattle ranch, Reata. Bick&#x27;s older sister, Luz, runs the household and resents Leslie&#x27;s intrusion. Leslie learns that she is expected to be subservient in the male-dominated Texas culture and that Hispanics are viewed as inferior to whites. Jett Rink, a ranch hand, becomes infatuated with her. When Jett drives her around the ranch, Leslie observes the Hispanic workers&#x27; terrible living conditions. She presses Bick to improve their situation and oversees the treatment of the infant son of Bick&#x27;s ranch hand Angel Obregon, Angel, Jr.. Bick, however, is not receptive to his family doctor treating Hispanics.

Luz is killed while riding Leslie&#x27;s horse, War Winds. Her will leaves a small piece of Benedict land to Jett. Bick, who despises Jett, offers to buy the property, but Jett refuses and names his land &quot;Little Reata&quot;.

Leslie and Bick have twins, Jordan III (&quot;Jordy&quot;) and Judy, and later another daughter, Luz II. The marriage becomes strained, and Leslie takes the children to her parents for an extended visit. Bick follows her to Maryland, and he and Leslie reconcile and return to Texas.

Jett continues working his land, striking oil. He flaunts his newfound fortune and tries to persuade Bick to let him drill for oil on Reata. Bick, determined to preserve his family&#x27;s cattle ranching legacy, refuses.

Years later, in 1941, tensions arise regarding the now-grown Benedict children. Bick intends that Jordy will succeed him and run the ranch, but Jordy wants to become a doctor. Leslie plans for Judy to attend finishing school in Switzerland, but she wants to study animal husbandry at Texas Tech. Each sibling convinces one parent to persuade the other to allow them to pursue their own goals.

At the family Christmas party, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Bick offers Judy&#x27;s new husband, Bob Dace, the opportunity to work on the ranch after the war ends. Dace declines, wanting to build his own life with Judy. Realizing that his children will not take over the ranch when he retires, Bick accepts Jett&#x27;s offer to allow drilling on Reata. The Benedicts grow wealthier and more powerful. The war ends with Bob&#x27;s safe return, but Angel Obregon, Jr., is killed in action. Jordy marries Juana, the daughter of the ranch&#x27;s Hispanic doctor who treated Angel as a baby.

At his Austin hotel, Jett hosts a huge party in his own honor and invites the Benedicts. Jett and Luz II have developed a flirtatious relationship that ends after Luz rejects Jett&#x27;s awkward proposal. Jett becomes drunk and prohibits his staff from serving Hispanics; consequently, Juana is ignored at the hotel beauty shop. Enraged, Jordy starts and loses a fight with Jett, who then has him thrown out. Bick challenges Jett but, seeing that the drunken Jett is in no state to defend himself, he and the other Benedicts leave. Jett passes out as he attempts to give his speech in front of the packed ballroom. Later, Luz II hears him bemoaning his unrequited love for Leslie and leaves heartbroken.

Driving home the next day, the Benedicts stop at a diner. Sarge, the owner, insults Juana and her and Jordy&#x27;s young son with a racial slur. When Sarge tries to eject a Hispanic family from the diner, Bick intervenes and a fight ensues. Bick refuses to quit in spite of a terrific beating; finally he is knocked unconscious. Back at Reata, he laments failing to preserve the Benedict family legacy. Leslie replies that, after the diner fight, he was her hero for the first time and she considers their family legacy a success. They look at their two grandsons, one white and one Hispanic.

==Cast==

==Production==
===Writing===

Ferber&#x27;s character of Jordan Benedict II and her description of the Reata Ranch were based on Robert &quot;Bob&quot; J. Kleberg Jr. (1896–1974) and the King Ranch in Kingsville, Texas. Like the over half-million-acre (2,023.4 km2) Reata, King Ranch comprises 825,000 acres (3,340 km2; 1,289 sq mi) and includes portions of six Texas counties, including most of Kleberg County and much of Kenedy County, and was largely a livestock ranch before the discovery of oil. The fictional character Jett Rink was inspired partly by the extraordinary rags-to-riches life story of the wildcatter oil tycoon Glenn Herbert McCarthy (1907–1988). Author Edna Ferber met McCarthy when she was a guest at his Shamrock Hotel in Houston, Texas, the fictional Emperador Hotel in both the book and the film.

===Casting===
The Australian actor Rod Taylor was cast in one of his early Hollywood roles after being seen in an episode of &quot;Studio 57&quot;, titled &quot;The Black Sheep&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

Stevens gave Hudson a choice between Elizabeth Taylor and Grace Kelly to play the leading lady Leslie. Hudson chose Taylor.

George Stevens had a reputation as a meticulous film editor, and the film spent an entire year in the editing room. 
After James Dean&#x27;s death late in production, Nick Adams overdubbed some of Dean&#x27;s lines, which were nearly inaudible, as Rink&#x27;s voice.

===Filming===

The film begins with Jordan &quot;Bick&quot; Benedict, played by Hudson, arriving at Ardmore, Maryland, to purchase a stallion from the Lynnton family. The first part of the picture was actually shot in Albemarle County, Virginia, and used the Keswick, Virginia, railroad station as the Ardmore railway depot. 
Much of the subsequent film, depicting &quot;Reata&quot;, the Benedict ranch, was shot in and around the town of Marfa, Texas, and the remote, dry plains found nearby, with interiors filmed at the Warner Bros. studios in Burbank, California. The &quot;Jett Rink Day&quot; parade and airport festivities were filmed at the Burbank Airport.

===Music===
The Oscar-nominated musical score was by Russian-born composer and conductor Dimitri Tiomkin, who conducted the Warner Brothers Studio Orchestra.

===Themes===
The movie is an epic portrayal of a powerful Texas ranching family challenged by changing times and the coming of big oil. A major subplot concerns the racism of many Anglo-European Americans in Texas during the mid-twentieth century, and the discriminatory social segregation enforced against Mexican Americans. In the first third of the film, Bick and Luz treat the Mexicans who work on their ranch condescendingly, which upsets the more socially conscious Leslie. Bick eventually comes to realize his moral shortcomings – in a climactic scene at a roadside diner he loses a fistfight to the racist owner, but earns Leslie&#x27;s respect for defending the human rights of his brown-skinned daughter-in-law and grandson. Another subplot involves Leslie&#x27;s own striving for women&#x27;s equal rights as she defies the patriarchal social order, asserting herself and expressing her own opinions when the men talk. She protests being expected to suppress her beliefs in deference to Bick&#x27;s; this conflict leads to their temporary separation.

&quot;Giant&quot; is Edna Ferber&#x27;s third novel dealing with racism; the first was &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1926), which was adapted into the legendary Broadway musical &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1927); her second was &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1929), which was adapted to film twice, in 1931 and 1960. Ferber&#x27;s &quot;Giant&quot; was a blockbuster, selling 52 million books by 1956.

==Release==
&quot;Giant&quot; premiered in New York City on October 10, 1956, with the local DuMont station, WABD, televising the arrival of cast and crew, as well as other celebrities and studio chief Jack L. Warner. The picture was released to nationwide distribution on November 24, 1956.

Capitol Records, which had issued some of Dimitri Tiomkin&#x27;s music from the soundtrack (with the composer conducting the Warner Brothers studio orchestra) on an LP, later digitally remastered the tracks and issued them on CD, including two tracks conducted by Ray Heindorf. Both versions used a monaural blend of the multi-channel soundtrack recording.

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD on June 10, 2003. The DVD includes more than three hours of documentaries. The out of print Blu-ray was released on November 5, 2013, as part of the James Dean Ultimate Collector&#x27;s Edition set, and as an individual DigiBook release followed by a non-DigiBook Blu-ray on March 11, 2014. Those releases contained three discs including two DVDs with all the extras from the 2004 release. The full length George Stevens: A Filmmaker&#x27;s Journey documentary is also included on one of the DVD discs. The manufacture-on-demand 4K Ultra HD release of the film released on June 21, 2022, through Studio Distribution Services.

==Reception==
, &quot;Giant&quot; holds an 86% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 51 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Giant&quot; earns its imposing name with a towering narrative supported by striking cinematography, big ideas, and powerful work from a trio of legendary Hollywood leads.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 84 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

&quot;Giant&quot; won praise from both critics and the public, and according to the Texan author Larry McMurtry, was especially popular with Texans, even though it was sharply critical of Texan society. Bosley Crowther of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;George Stevens takes three hours and seventeen minutes to put his story across. That&#x27;s a heap of time to go on about Texas, but Mr. Stevens has made a heap of film.&quot; He continued to write that &quot;&quot;Giant&quot;, for all its complexity, is a strong contender for the year&#x27;s top-film award.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; claimed that &quot;Giant&quot; was &quot;for the most part, an excellent film which registers strongly on all levels, whether it&#x27;s in its breathtaking panoramic shots of the dusty Texas plains; the personal, dramatic impact of the story itself, or the resounding message it has to impart.&quot;

In the 21st century, &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film four stars out of five, writing of James Dean&#x27;s performance: &quot;This was the last role in Dean&#x27;s all-too-brief career – he was dead when the film was released – and his presence ran away with the film. He performs his role in the overwrought method manner of the era, and the rest of the cast seems to be split between awe of his talent and disgust over his indulgence.&quot;

Less complimentary was director and critic Francois Truffaut, who, in an early review, called &quot;Giant&quot; a &quot;silly, solemn, sly, paternalistic, demagogic movie without any boldness, rich in all sorts of concessions, pettiness, and contemptible actions.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Giant&quot; was a huge box-office success. The film earned $35 million in ticket sales during its original studio release in 1956, a record for a Warner Brothers film until that time. This record was not surpassed until the Warner film &quot;Superman&quot; in the late 1970s.

The movie earned $12 million in rentals in the United States and Canada during its initial release. It did not perform as well in other markets where it made around half as much, but it was one of the biggest hits of the year in France, with admissions of 3,723,209.

==Legacy==
&quot;Giant&quot; is considered to be the inspiration for the hit 1980s television drama &quot;Dallas&quot;. Both productions focus on the struggle between wealthy oilmen and cattlemen in Texas in the mid to late 20th century. In addition, both productions have an antagonist with the initials J.R.

In 1978, Martin Scorsese wrote about the movie as a guilty pleasure:

The making of &quot;Giant&quot; was the background to the play and movie &quot;Come Back to the 5 &amp; Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot;.

In 1981, in a Levi Strauss ad campaign and television commercial that launched the 501 Jeans for women, an actress says: &quot;Travis, you&#x27;re years too late&quot;, evoking a scene from the movie with James Dean.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.36019/9780813564371-005&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, LGBTQ magazine The Advocate stated that the film &quot;gets some kind of an award for the most gay and bisexual actors ever in one film,&quot; noting that James Dean, Rock Hudson, Sal Mineo, and Earl Holliman where all either bisexual or homosexual. &quot;The Advocate&quot; also noted that Mercedes McCambridge&#x27;s character Luz hinted she was a homosexual through at least her name, also noting how despite never personally coming out, McCambridge &quot;played the most fiercely dykey roles on-screen to perfection.&quot;

<doc id="92594" wikidata="Q19892" url="?curid=92594" title="Bakerloo line">
<text>The Bakerloo line () is a London Underground line that runs between in suburban north-west London and in south London, via the West End. Printed in brown on the Tube map, it serves 25 stations, 15 of which are underground, over . It runs partly on the surface and partly through deep-level tube tunnels.

The line&#x27;s name is a portmanteau of its original name, the [[Baker Street and Waterloo Railway]]. From to Harrow &amp; Wealdstone (the section above ground), the line shares tracks with the London Overground Lioness line and runs parallel to the West Coast Main Line. There is, however, a short tunnel at the western end of .

Opened between 1906 and 1915, many of its stations retain elements of their design to a common standard: the stations below ground using Art Nouveau decorative tiling by Leslie Green, and the above-ground stations built in red brick with stone detailing in an Arts &amp; Crafts style. It is the ninth-busiest line on the network, carrying more than 125 million passengers annually.

The line currently runs 1972 Stock trains which, at years old, are the oldest trains in regular passenger service in Britain.

==History==

The route had its origins in the failed projects of the pneumatic 1865 Waterloo and Whitehall Railway and the 1882 Charing Cross and Waterloo Electric Railway.

Originally called the Baker Street &amp; Waterloo Railway, the line was constructed by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) and opened between Lambeth North (at the time named &quot;Kennington Road&quot;) and Baker Street on 10 March 1906. It was extended eastward to Elephant &amp; Castle five months later, on 5 August. The contraction of the name to &quot;Bakerloo&quot; rapidly caught on, and the official name was changed to match in July 1906.

When work on the line started in June 1898, it had been financed by the mining entrepreneur and company promoter Whitaker Wright, who fell foul of the law over the financial proceedings involved and dramatically committed suicide at the Royal Courts of Justice, after being convicted in 1904. As a result, work on the line was stopped for a few months and did not resume until Charles Yerkes and UERL stepped in and took over the project.

By 1913, the line had been extended westward from its original northern terminus at Baker Street, with interchange stations with the Great Central Railway at Marylebone and with the Great Western Railway at Paddington, and a new station at Edgware Road.

===Watford branch===

In 1915, the line was extended to , where it joined the LNWR&#x27;s Euston-Watford DC line (now part of London Overground) to . Bakerloo services to Watford Junction were reduced in the 1960s and cut back in 1982 to .

Services as far as Harrow &amp; Wealdstone were gradually restored from 1984, and in 1989 the present all-day service was instituted.

===Stanmore branch===
By the mid-1930s, the Metropolitan line was suffering from congestion caused by the limited capacity of its tracks between Baker Street and Finchley Road stations. To relieve this pressure, the network-wide New Works Programme included the construction of new sections of tunnel between the Bakerloo line&#x27;s platforms at Baker Street and Finchley Road and the replacement of three Metropolitan line stations (, and ) between those points with two new Bakerloo line stations ( and [Swiss Cottage Swiss Cottage]). The Bakerloo line took over the Metropolitan line&#x27;s service to Stanmore on 20 November 1939. The branch remained part of the Bakerloo line until 1 May 1979, when similar congestion problems for the Bakerloo line caused by two branches converging at Baker Street led to the creation of the Jubilee line, initially formed by connecting the Stanmore branch to new tunnels bored between Baker Street and .

When the Bakerloo line was extended to Watford in 1917, it acquired an interchange at Harrow &amp; Wealdstone with another route to Stanmore, the Stanmore branch line. This branch line was operated by the LNWR and terminated at a separate Stanmore station (later renamed ). It was closed in 1964, partly due to the success of the rival Metropolitan/Bakerloo Underground line to Stanmore.

===Camberwell extension===

An extension at the southern end of the line to Camberwell and Denmark Hill was proposed and approved in 1931 as part of the &quot;London Electric Metropolitan District and Central London Railway Companies (Works) Act, 1931&quot;. In April 1937, the estimated cost of the proposed extension was £5,000,000 (approximately £ today) and the London Passenger Transport Board announced that, due to rising materials prices, the extension had been postponed until the Board&#x27;s finances improved. Apart from the extension of the sidings south of Elephant &amp; Castle, no work on the extension took place before the Second World War, but the powers were renewed by the government in 1947 under the &quot;Special Enactments (Extension of Time) Act, 1940&quot;. A projected extension as far as Camberwell was shown on a 1949 edition of the Underground map but no further work was done. The train describers at Warwick Avenue station showed &quot;Camberwell&quot; as a destination until the 1990s. Further extensions of the line were considered, south to Peckham Rye in the 1970s, and east to London Docklands and Canary Wharf in the 1980s. Neither proposal was proceeded with.

===Electricity supply===
One oddity is that, almost from its opening until 1917, the Bakerloo operated with the polarity of the conductor rails reversed, the outside rail negative and the centre rail positive. This came about because the Bakerloo shared a power source with the District Railway. On the Bakerloo, the outside conductor rail tended to leak to the tunnel wall, whereas on the District Railway, the centre rail shared a similar problem. The solution was to reverse the polarity on the Bakerloo line, so that the negative rail leaked on both systems. In 1917, the two lines were separated when the LNWR began its &#x27;New Line&#x27; service between Euston and Watford Junction, which the Bakerloo would share north of Queens Park. As a result, normal operation was restored.

===Centenary===
The line celebrated its centenary on 10 March 2006, when events were organised with actors and staff in Edwardian costume entertaining travellers.

===2017 fire===
In 2017, a fire on a train at Oxford Circus station caused disruption on the Bakerloo line. A number of people were treated for the effects of smoke inhalation.

==Future developments==
===Re-extension to Watford Junction===
Operation of the northern section of the line may be changed following the decision in February 2006 to transfer responsibility for Euston-Watford suburban services (on the Watford DC Line) from the Department for Transport to Transport for London (TfL). This was in conjunction with the reorganisation of a number of north London railways under London Overground.

In a former London Plan, it was projected that by 2026 the Bakerloo line would be re-extended from Harrow &amp; Wealdstone to Watford Junction, restoring the pre-1982 service. The railway line from Queens Park to Watford Junction, currently shared with London Overground, would be shared with the Bakerloo line. The Best And Final Bid documentation for the Croxley Rail Link project indicates that this Bakerloo line extension is now &quot;unlikely&quot; because &quot;TfL&#x27;s plans to extend the Bakerloo line to Watford Junction are on hold indefinitely due to funding and business case constraints&quot;.

=== Extension to Lewisham and Hayes ===
Since the late 2000s, Transport for London (TfL) has been planning an extension of the line, with a route to Lewisham via Old Kent Road safeguarded in 2021. Four stations would be built, at Burgess Park, Old Kent Road, New Cross Gate and Lewisham, with provision for a further extension along the Mid-Kent line to Hayes and Beckenham Junction. This could occur following the completion of the extension to Lewisham. Estimated to cost between £4.7bn to £7.9bn (in 2017 prices), the extension would take around 7 years to construct. Due to TfL&#x27;s poor finances following the COVID-19 pandemic, work to implement the extension is currently on hold.

== Rolling stock ==

=== Current rolling stock ===
The Bakerloo line is operated entirely by 1972 Stock, displaced from the Jubilee line by 1983 stock. The trains are maintained at Stonebridge Park depot. All Bakerloo line trains are painted in the London Underground livery of red, white and blue, and are the smaller of the two train sizes used on the network, as the line runs deep underground in small-diameter tunnels.

In the early 2000s, the interiors of the trains were &#x27;deep-cleaned&#x27; and the upholstery replaced with a blue moquette. The seating layouts are both longitudinal and transverse; some cars have longitudinal seating only. A TfL Finance and Policy Committee Paper dated 11 March 2015 revealed that the repair programme for the 1972 Stock would be more expensive than anticipated, due to the unexpectedly inferior condition of the fleet.

In early 2016, a four-year refurbishment programme began with the first of the new-look cars operating on the line in March. Each car&#x27;s interior was cleaned, the seating moquette replaced with a variation of the Barman type seen on other lines, and handrails and lighting renewed. Each car was assessed and repair work carried out to ensure the stock can operate safely.

According to a November 2021 paper by the TfL Finance Committee, replacement of the current trains may not occur until the late 2030s or early 2040s, due to a lack of funding. In this case, the trains would be 60-70 years old at the time of replacement, around twice their design life. Since the withdrawal of the final Class 483 trains on the Isle of Wight, the 1972 Stock have become the oldest non-heritage trains running in the United Kingdom.

=== Future rolling stock ===

In the late 1990s, the Labour government initiated a public–private partnership (PPP) to reverse years of underinvestment in London Underground. Under the PPP contract, Metronet – the private consortium responsible for the Bakerloo line – would order new rolling stock for the line. This would take place following the delivery of 2009 Stock and S Stock trains, with an order for 24 new Bakerloo line trains. These would have entered service by 2019. However, Metronet collapsed in 2007 after cost overruns, and the PPP ended in 2010.

In the mid 2010s, TfL began a process of ordering new rolling stock to replace trains on the Piccadilly, Central, Bakerloo and Waterloo &amp; City lines. A feasibility study into the new trains showed that new generation trains and re-signalling could increase capacity on the Bakerloo line by 25%, with 27 trains per hour. 

In June 2018, the Siemens Mobility Inspiro design was selected. These trains would have an open gangway design, wider doorways, air conditioning and the ability to run automatically with a new signalling system. TfL could only afford to order Piccadilly line trains at a cost of £1.5bn. However, the contract with Siemens includes an option for 40 trains for the Bakerloo line in the future. This would take place after the delivery of the Piccadilly line trains in the late 2020s.

=== Former rolling stock ===

When opened in 1906, the Bakerloo line was operated by Gate Stock trains, built at Trafford Park, Manchester. To cope with the extension to Queen&#x27;s Park, 12 extra motor cars of the London Underground 1914 Stock were ordered, ten from Brush of Loughborough and two from the Leeds Forge Company.

To operate services north of Queen&#x27;s Park, 72 additional cars were built by the Metropolitan Carriage, Waggon and Finance Company of Birmingham. These trains, known as the Watford Joint Stock, were partly owned by the Underground and partly by the London and North Western Railway (later London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS)). They were initially painted in LNWR livery. They were not equipped with air-operated doors and proved slow and unreliable, so they were replaced by new trains of Standard Stock by 1930 (although a few were retained by the LMS). For some years in the 1930s, Watford trains had a distinctive blue stripe at window level.

In 1932, some carriages built for the Piccadilly line by Cammell Laird in Nottingham in 1919 were transferred to the Bakerloo line. When built, these had been the first Tube trains to have air-operated doors. These were later replaced by more trains of Standard Stock, in turn being replaced by 1938 stock and 1949 stock.

Until the 1980s, the Bakerloo line was mainly worked by 1938 stock. 1972 stock operated briefly on the line during the late 1970s until it was transferred to the Jubilee line when it opened in 1979. From 1983, the 1938 stock began to be replaced by trains of 1959 stock from the Northern line, but this was a temporary measure until 1972 stock became available. The last 1938 stock train was withdrawn on 20 November 1985. From 1986, the 1959 stock was transferred back to the Northern line and was replaced by the current 1972 stock.

== Services ==
As of May 2021, weekday off-peak and Sunday services on Bakerloo line are:
* 4 tph (trains per hour) from Harrow &amp; Wealdstone to Elephant &amp; Castle
* 4 tph from Stonebridge Park to Elephant &amp; Castle
* 8 tph from Queen&#x27;s Park to Elephant &amp; Castle

This forms a 16 tph service (or a train approximately every 4 minutes) between Queen&#x27;s Park and Elephant &amp; Castle. A 20 tph service runs on this section of the line during the weekday peak and all day on Saturdays.

== Stations ==

&quot;Note: For the former Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo line, see the Jubilee line article. For the stations past Harrow &amp; Wealdstone no longer served by the Bakerloo Line but still served by Overground trains, see the Lioness line article.&quot;

===Former stations===

====Watford branch====

Between 1917 and 1982, Bakerloo line trains continued along the DC line past Harrow &amp; Wealdstone to Watford Junction. These stations continue to be served by Lioness line. Proposals have surfaced to re-extend the Bakerloo line to Watford Junction and service the following stations:

==== Stanmore branch ====

The Stanmore branch was originally constructed by the Metropolitan Railway and was later designated as the Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo line in 1939. It was transferred to the Jubilee line on 1 May 1979. It connected to the main Bakerloo line at Baker Street.

* Stanmore
* Canons Park
* Queensbury
* Kingsbury
* Wembley Park
* Neasden
* Dollis Hill
* Willesden Green
* Kilburn
* West Hampstead
* Finchley Road
* Swiss Cottage
* St John&#x27;s Wood
* Baker Street
==Depots==

The Bakerloo line is currently served by three depots: a main depot at Stonebridge Park, opened on 9 April 1979 on the site of a former British Rail power station which contains the fleet&#x27;s maintenance facilities; the original depot at London Road (between Elephant and Castle and Lambeth North, though connected to the line between Lambeth North and Waterloo); and a small depot at Queens Park station.

The Queen&#x27;s Park depot has six tracks, all under cover and numbered 21–26, split between two buildings located at each end of the station, known as the North Shed and the South Shed. The South Shed has two terminal tracks (nos. 25 and 26) and is above the service tracks into the main Bakerloo line tunnels built in 1915. The North Shed has two terminal tracks (nos. 22 and 23) and two through tracks (nos. 21 and 24), and is unique on the London Underground network in that trains in passenger service run through it. Tracks 22 and 23 are used by trains from the south terminating at Queen&#x27;s Park during service. All four tracks in the north shed are also used for stabling trains overnight.

When Bakerloo line services ran to Watford, there was also an additional depot, Croxley Green Light Maintenance Depot at Croxley Green; this depot closed in November 1985 following the withdrawal of services.

When the Bakerloo had two branches at its northern end, to Queens Park (as currently) and to Stanmore (now taken over by the Jubilee line), the depot at Neasden on the Stanmore branch was the principal one on the line. The Jubilee taking over this branch from 1979 was the reason behind building the new Stonebridge Park depot.

The London Road depot is unusual in that, although the depot is on the surface, the line passes nearby in tunnel, connected by a short and sharply graded branch tunnel.

<text>The Circle line is a spiral-shaped London Underground line, running from Hammersmith in the west to Edgware Road and then looping around central London back to Edgware Road. The railway is below ground in the central section and on the loop east of Paddington. Unlike London&#x27;s deep-level lines, the Circle line tunnels are just below the surface and are of similar size to those on British main lines. Printed in yellow on the Tube map, the line serves 36 stations, including most of London&#x27;s main line termini. Almost all of the route, and all the stations, are shared with one or more of the three other sub-surface lines, namely the District, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan lines. On the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines combined, over 141 million passenger journeys were recorded in 2019.

The first section became operational in 1863 when the Metropolitan Railway opened the world&#x27;s first underground line between Paddington and with wooden carriages and steam locomotives. The same year a select committee report recommended an &quot;inner circle&quot; of lines connecting the London railway termini, and the Metropolitan District Railway (commonly known as the District Railway) was formed to build the southern portion of the line.

In 1871, services began between Mansion House and Moorgate via Paddington, jointly operated by the two companies. Due to conflict between the two companies it was not until October 1884 that the inner circle was completed. The line was electrified in 1905, and in 1933 the companies were amalgamated into the London Passenger Transport Board. In 1949, the Circle line appeared as a separate line for the first time on the Tube map. In 2009, the closed loop around the centre of London on the north side of the River Thames was broken at Edgware Road and extended west to become a spiral to Hammersmith.

Starting in 2015, the signalling system was upgraded as part of a programme to increase peak-hour capacity on the line. The six-car C Stock trains were replaced from 2012 to 2014 by new seven-car S Stock trains.

==History==

===Origins===

In 1863, the Metropolitan Railway, the world&#x27;s first underground railway, opened in London between Paddington and Farringdon, connecting the Great Western Railway&#x27;s relatively remote terminus at Paddington with Euston and King&#x27;s Cross stations and the City, London&#x27;s financial district. In the same year, a select committee report recommended an &quot;inner circle&quot; of railway lines connecting the London termini that had been built or were under construction. In the next year, the Metropolitan District Railway (commonly known as the District Railway) was formed to build and operate a railway from South Kensington to Tower Hill. The Metropolitan western extension from a new station at Paddington to South Kensington opened in 1868. By May 1870, the District Railway had opened its line from West Brompton to Blackfriars via Gloucester Road and South Kensington, services being operated at first by the Metropolitan. In 1871, the District had built a terminus at Mansion House, and on 18 November 1876 the Metropolitan opened its terminus at Aldgate. Because of the conflict between the two companies, it took an act of Parliament, the (42 &amp; 43 Vict. c. cci) before further work was done on the inner circle. In 1882, the Metropolitan extended its line from Aldgate to a temporary station at Tower Hill and the District completed its line to Whitechapel. On 6 October 1884, the temporary station was replaced with a joint station and the inner circle was complete. The Metropolitan provided the clockwise, or &quot;outer rail&quot;, trains; the District the &quot;inner rail&quot;, or anti-clockwise. Many breakdowns occurred, due to the unbalanced wear-and-tear inflicted upon the train and carriages caused by travelling in a single circular direction. Equally, services were further disrupted due to petty squabbles between the two rivals including an incident whereby the Metropolitan Railway forcibly removed (using three trains) the District Railway&#x27;s parked carriages which had been chained to the track.

===Other circle routes===
As well as the inner circle, other routes circumnavigated London, although these were not complete loops. From 1872, the L&amp;NWR began an &quot;outer circle&quot; service from Broad Street to Mansion House via Willesden Junction and Earl&#x27;s Court, diverting an earlier service that had run to Victoria; and the GWR began a &quot;middle circle&quot; service from Moorgate to Mansion House via Latimer Road and Earl&#x27;s Court. Both of these routes were cut back to Earl&#x27;s Court: the &quot;middle circle&quot; in 1900 and the &quot;outer circle&quot; in 1909. The GWR service survived as a shuttle service from the Hammersmith &amp; City line to Addison Road, now Kensington (Olympia), until 1940.

The Midland Railway briefly ran a super outer circle from St Pancras to Earl&#x27;s Court from 1878 to 1880. London Overground now runs services between Clapham Junction, Willesden Junction and Dalston Junction and between Dalston Junction and Clapham Junction.

===Electrification===

Wooden carriages were originally hauled by steam locomotives leading to smoke-filled stations and carriages, unpopular with passengers. At the start of the 20th century, the District and Metropolitan were seeing increased competition in central London from the new electric underground tube lines and trams, and conversion to electric traction was seen as the way forward. Experiments were carried out on the Earl&#x27;s Court to High Street Kensington section, and a jointly-owned six-carriage train began passenger service in 1900. Following this, an AC system was suggested, and this was accepted by both parties. However, the District was looking for a way to raise the finance needed and in 1901 found an investor, the American Charles Yerkes. He formed the Underground Electric Railways of London (UERL), and his experience in the United States led him to favour DC, with third-rail pick-up similar to that in use on the City &amp; South London Railway and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the Board of Trade, the DC system was taken up, and the railways began electrifying the routes, using multiple-unit stock.

The District and Metropolitan Railways bought different designs of electric multiple unit. Both had open saloons; the Metropolitan trains with gated ends, the District B Stock with sliding doors in the middle of each car. When their introduction was attempted on 1 July 1905, a Metropolitan train overturned the third rail on the District Railway, requiring all Metropolitan trains to be modified before running again on the District lines. A fully electric service began on 24 September, initially with six-car trains, later reduced to four-car. The Metropolitan trains were soon modified to enclose the gated end and eventually to add sliding doors in the middle. Trains were increased to five cars in 1918 and the Metropolitan introduced new stock in 1921, with three pairs of sliding double doors on trailer cars. In 1926 the Metropolitan took over all inner circle workings except for three trains on Sundays.

===London Transport===
On 1 July 1933, the Metropolitan and the District Railways were amalgamated with other Underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board. Metropolitan Railway electric multiple units were refurbished in 1934 at Acton Works to become eighteen five-car trains of Circle Stock, at first painted red and cream, later painted red all over to reduce costs. These trains included first-class accommodation, but this was downgraded in 1940. From 1947, these were replaced by five-car trains of O and P Stock, with doors remotely operated by the guard, released by the transfer of F Stock to the Uxbridge line. The 1933 London Underground Beck map shows a Metropolitan line north of and stations and a District line south of these points. On the 1947 map, the Metropolitan and District lines were shown together in the same colour and two years later in 1949 the Circle line was shown separately on the map.

In 1959–1960, Circle line trains were increased to six cars, the same length as those operating on the Hammersmith &amp; City line, and the stock of the two lines was integrated with maintenance concentrated at Hammersmith depot, allowing Neasden depot to concentrate on the new A Stock. Aluminium C Stock trains, with public address systems and originally unpainted, replaced these trains from 1970. One person operation of the trains was proposed in 1972 but, due to conflict with the trade unions, was not introduced until 1984. In 2003, the infrastructure of the Circle line was partly privatised in a public–private partnership, managed by the Metronet consortium. Metronet went into administration in 2007 and the local government body Transport for London took over responsibilities.

On 7 July 2005, at about 08:50, bombs exploded on two Circle line trains. One was travelling between Liverpool Street and Aldgate and the other was at Edgware Road. The bombs killed 15 people, including the two suicide bombers. Following the attacks, the whole of the Circle line was closed until 8 August.

A day before a ban on drinking alcohol on public transport in London came into force, a party was held on 31 May 2008, mainly on the Circle line. Thousands of people attended and 17 were arrested by police due to disorderly behaviour, eventually causing several stations to be closed.

===Extension===
Prior to 13 December 2009, Circle line trains travelled in both directions around a simple loop with 27 stations and of track. In 2006, there were fourteen trains in service on the line with an interval between trains of  minutes during peak hours and 8 minutes off-peak; the minimum running time around the circle off-peak was  minutes, although timetabled stops at stations extended this.

In December 2009, the Circle line was extended to include the Hammersmith &amp; City route from Edgware Road to Hammersmith. Rather than continuously running around the circle, trains now travel from Hammersmith to Edgware Road, generally going around the circle once before terminating at Edgware Road, and returning via the same route; occasionally, trains may also continue clockwise through Edgware Road to additional stations. The change was made to improve reliability and increase the service frequency on the Hammersmith branch.

In March 2020, following the UK government&#x27;s implementation of lockdown restricting all non-essential travel, the Circle line, along with the Waterloo &amp; City line, was suspended.

==Route==

===Map===
===Railway line===

The Circle line is long with 36 stations. Almost all of its track, and all of its stations, are shared with the other London Underground sub-surface lines: the Hammersmith &amp; City line from Hammersmith to Liverpool Street; the Metropolitan line from just east of Baker Street to Aldgate station; the main branch of the District line from Tower Hill station to Gloucester Road; and the Edgware Road branch of the District line from High Street Kensington to Edgware Road. The only two sections of track which are not shared with any other lines are linking sections between Aldgate and Tower Hill, and between Gloucester Road and High Street Kensington. The line is electrified with a four-rail DC system: a central conductor rail is energised at and a rail outside the running rail at , giving a potential difference of . The running rails are not electrified. Much of the double track railway from the Hammersmith terminus to Westbourne Park station is on a high brick viaduct.

East of Westbourne Park the line passes beneath the Great Western Main Line before resurfacing at Royal Oak station and running alongside the tracks of the main line to an island platform just north of the suburban platforms at Paddington station. The line enters a cut and cover tunnel at the end of the platforms and meets the District line and the other end of the Circle line from Bayswater at Praed Street Junction before passing through Edgware Road station in a cutting. After King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras station the line exits the tunnel before passing over the Ray Street Gridiron beneath which pass the City Widened Lines which are currently used by Thameslink services. The line continues underground after Farringdon station; there are bay platforms at Moorgate station.

After passing through Aldgate station, the terminus of the Metropolitan line, the line joins the District line shortly before Tower Hill; this part of the line includes stations on the Victoria Embankment, on the north bank of the Thames, as far as Westminster station. West of Gloucester Road station the line turns off the District main line to join the District line&#x27;s Edgware Road branch just before High Street Kensington station. In Bayswater the line is in a cutting, concealed from above by a façade of two five-storey houses at Nos 23 and 24 Leinster Gardens. Trains then call at the second Paddington station on Praed Street before rejoining the Hammersmith &amp; City line at Praed Street junction and terminating at the four-platform Edgware Road station.

==Services==
, there are six trains per hour, calling at all stations, requiring 18 trains in service. The journey from Edgware Road around the loop and continuing to Hammersmith takes 72 minutes off-peak. Together with the Hammersmith &amp; City line over 114 million passenger journeys are made each year. Paddington and all stations on the loop are within Zone 1, with those on the line to Hammersmith in Zone 2.

Two trains per day run from Barking to Edgware Road via Victoria (as of February 2015).

=== Announcements ===
Historically there has been difficulty in relaying the direction of travel a train is headed in a clear message: variations such as &quot;eastbound&quot; and &quot;westbound&quot;, and &quot;clockwise&quot; and &quot;anti-clockwise&quot; can be ambiguous. As passengers became more accustomed to digital devices, TfL considered stopping such announcements and now uses key stations along the route to describe a service (e.g. &quot;via. High Street Kensington&quot;).

==Rolling stock==
From 1970 to 2014, services were provided using six-car C69 stock trains, each car having mostly transverse seating and four sets of double doors per side to minimise loading times.

The C69 stock trains were replaced by seven-car S Stock trains, the first running on the Circle line on 2 September 2013. By June 2014 all services were provided by S7 Stock trains. The trains are part of Bombardier&#x27;s Movia family, and have a top speed of . A 7-car S Stock train has a capacity of 865 passengers compared to 739 for the 6-car C Stock train it replaced. With a length of , the S Stock trains are longer than the long C stock train, and required station platforms to be lengthened before their introduction.

===Depot===
The line&#x27;s depot is at Hammersmith, close to Hammersmith station, originally built by the Great Western Railway to be operated by the Metropolitan Railway when the joint Hammersmith &amp; City Railway was electrified in the early 20th century. Sidings at Barking, Farringdon and near High Street Kensington (known as Triangle Sidings) stable trains overnight.

==Four Lines Modernisation (4LM)==
It was planned that a new signalling system would be used first on the sub-surface lines from the end of 2016, but signalling contractor Bombardier was released from its contract by agreement in December 2013 amid heavy criticism of the procurement process and London Underground subsequently awarded the contract for the project to Thales in August 2015.

With the introduction of S7 Stock, the track, electrical supply, and signalling systems are being upgraded in a programme planned to increase peak-hour capacity on the line by 27 per cent by the end of 2023. A single control room for the sub-surface railway opened at Hammersmith on 6 May 2018, and Communications Based Train Control (CBTC) provided by Thales will progressively replace &#x27;fixed block&#x27; signalling equipment dating back to the 1940s.

The rollout of CBTC has been split into sections, each known as a Signal Migration Area (SMA), and are located on the line as follows:


==List of stations==
&quot;The line then continues to Edgware Road where trains terminate, then reverse to traverse the loop in an anticlockwise direction to Hammersmith.&quot;

== Urban myths ==
Owing to its historically circular nature, the line has generated many urban myths over the years, including a dead man travelling around undiscovered, a school or office using the service to save infrastructure costs and, as an April fool in the &quot;Independent&quot;, a new particle accelerator to coexist alongside passenger services.

<text>Sayonara is a 1957 American romantic drama film directed by Joshua Logan, and starring Marlon Brando, Patricia Owens, James Garner, Martha Scott, Miyoshi Umeki, Red Buttons, Miiko Taka and Ricardo Montalbán. It tells the story of an American Air Force pilot during the Korean War who falls in love with a famous Japanese dancer. The screenplay was adapted by Paul Osborn from James A. Michener&#x27;s 1954 novel of the same name.

Unlike many 1950s romantic dramas, &quot;Sayonara&quot; deals squarely with racism and prejudice. The picture was released by Warner Bros. on December 25, 1957, to critical acclaim and commercial success. At the 30th Academy Awards the film was nominated in nine categories and won four, including Best Supporting Actor for Buttons and Best Supporting Actress for Umeki. The latter award made Umeki the first East Asia-born woman to win an Oscar.

==Plot==
United States Air Force fighter pilot Major Lloyd &quot;Ace&quot; Gruver, the son of an Army general, is stationed at Itami Air Force Base near Kobe, Japan. He has been reassigned from combat duties in Korea by General Webster, the father of his fiancée, Eileen. While Ace and Eileen have been together for years, their relationship has become strained.

Airman Joe Kelly, Ace&#x27;s enlisted crew chief, is about to wed a Japanese woman, Katsumi, in spite of the disapproval of the military establishment, which will not recognize the interracial marriage because it is generally illegal under American law. The Air Force, including Ace, is against the marriage. Ace and Joe have an argument during which Ace uses a racial slur to describe Katsumi. Ace eventually apologizes, then agrees to be Joe&#x27;s best man at the wedding.

Ace falls in love with a Japanese entertainer, Hana-ogi, who is the lead performer for the all-female &quot;Matsubayashi&quot;, a Takarazuka-like theater company, whom he meets through Katsumi. Eileen realizes that Ace&#x27;s attentions are no longer focused on her and begins a friendship with a famous Kabuki performer, Nakamura. After overhearing that Joe&#x27;s house has been under surveillance by the Army, she believes that Ace is in danger and goes there to warn him.

Joe suffers further prejudice at the hands of openly hostile Colonel Crawford, pulling extra duty and all the less attractive assignments. When Joe and others who are married to Japanese are targeted for transfer back to the United States, Joe realizes that he will not be able to take Katsumi, who is now pregnant. Ace goes to General Webster and pleads Joe&#x27;s case, asking that he be allowed to remain in Japan. When the General refuses on the grounds that he cannot allow an exception, Ace says that he will be in the same situation, since he intends to marry Hana-ogi. Eileen and her mother are present for the exchange, and Ace apologizes for hurting her. Eileen realizes Ace never loved her the way he loves Hana-ogi and leaves to see Nakamura.

Joe and Katsumi&#x27;s home is boarded up by the military police and Ace is taken into custody by General Webster, where he is confined to quarters. He is told that he will most likely be sent back to the United States and Hana-ogi will be sent to Tokyo. Joe goes AWOL, and two Military Police seek Ace&#x27;s help to find Joe through his local connections so he can be sent back to the U.S. and not be reported missing, which could lead to charges ranging from deliberately missing a movement — a serious offense in wartime — all the way to desertion. Ace, accompanied by Captain Bailey, finds Joe and Katsumi who had secretly returned to their home and committed double suicide rather than be parted. Hana-ogi later arrives unnoticed and alone outside Joe and Katsumi&#x27;s home. There, she opens a window and, still unseen, whispers a tearful &quot;sayonara&quot; to Joe, Katsumi, and Ace, although nobody hears her. Hana-ogi then leaves through the rear gate.

After exiting Joe&#x27;s home, Ace and Bailey are attacked by Japanese holding anti-American signs. However, sympathetic Japanese neighbors intervene to help the Americans, resulting in widespread fighting in the street. Ace and Bailey escape during the scuffles.

The loss of Joe and Katsumi strengthens Ace&#x27;s resolve to marry Hana-ogi, and Ace goes to the theater company to find her. There, he learns Hana-ogi has already left Kobe for Tokyo a week ahead of schedule. General Webster, believing the crisis with Ace is averted, apologizes for what happened to Joe and Katsumi and says that laws will soon be passed to allow interracial marriages in the United States.

Ace leaves Kobe and flies to Tokyo. He tracks down Hana-ogi at her new venue in a Tokyo theater and pleads with her again to become his wife. They leave the theater and Hana-ogi announces to the waiting Japanese and American reporters that they intend to wed. When a military newspaper reporter asks Ace how he will explain his marriage to the &quot;big brass&quot; as well as to the Japanese, Ace says, &quot;Tell &#x27;em we said, &#x27;Sayonara.&#x27;&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
According to director Joshua Logan, Marlon Brando was the first choice. He turned it down so they offered the part to Rock Hudson who had too many obligations at Universal. They tried Brando again who was reluctant, so they offered the female lead to Audrey Hepburn. Brando eventually agreed to do it if they changed the ending of the novel so the two lovers got married instead of the American leaving. When Hepburn turned him down, he looked to cast an unknown actress. Miiko Taka, who at the time was working as a clerk at a travel agency in Los Angeles, was discovered by a talent scout at a local Nisei festival. She was cast despite having no previous acting experience. Logan cast Ricardo Montalbán after claiming he was unable to find a Japanese actor for the role.

Brando affected a nondescript Southern accent for Gruver, despite the objections of director Logan, who did not think a Southern accent was appropriate for a general&#x27;s son who was educated at West Point. Logan later admitted to the author and journalist Truman Capote about Brando, &quot;I&#x27;ve never worked with such an exciting, inventive actor. So pliable. He takes direction beautifully, and yet he always has something to add. He&#x27;s made up this Southern accent for the part; I never would have thought of it myself, but, well, it&#x27;s exactly right – it&#x27;s perfection.&quot; Ricardo Montalbán, born in Mexico to Spanish immigrants, plays a Japanese character in “yellowface” makeup. Montalbán modeled his performance on Seki Sano, a well-known Japanese acting teacher under whom he had trained.

Garner wrote in his memoirs that he actively lobbied to play his role, one of the few times in his career he did this. It had originally been cast with John Smith, but Garner succeeded in getting the part.

==Music==
The song &quot;Sayonara&quot; was written by Irving Berlin.

==Reception==
&quot;Sayonara&quot; received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for its writing and cinematography, in addition to the acting ability of its cast. It won four Academy Awards, including acting honors for co-stars Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 82% of critics out of 57 have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.6/10, with the website&#x27;s critics consensus reading, &quot;As sumptuously staged as it is ponderously paced, &quot;Sayonara&quot; flutters by on the strength of its touching story and solidly assembled cast.&quot;.

It was number one at the US box office for five consecutive weeks in 1958. It earned $10.5 million in theatrical rentals in the United States and Canada and $5 million overseas.

== Accolades ==
The film is also recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2002: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – Nominated
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores – Nominated

== Analysis ==
In an article for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2003, Scarlet Cheng stated that the film &quot;while calling for tolerance, also views the Japanese woman (so quiet, so subservient) as clearly superior to her American counterpart (so demanding, so loud). The Brando character, Maj. Lloyd, on R &amp; R in Japan, doesn’t start out with this appreciation. As the movie opens, he’s trying to persuade another soldier to give up his Japanese girlfriend -- by showing him a picture of his own fiancee...Soon afterward, though, the good major breaks off his long-standing engagement -- to take up with a Japanese stage actress...Of course, the object of his affection is no mere chorine, but in fact, the star of the show, adored by thousands of fans -- a fitting partner for an America hero.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Alongside the less successful &quot;Japanese War Bride&quot; (1952) and &quot;The Teahouse of the August Moon&quot; (1956), &quot;Sayonara&quot; is considered by some scholars to have increased racial tolerance in the United States by openly discussing interracial marriage. Other scholars have argued that it is one in a long list of films stereotyping Asian American women as &quot;lotus blossom, geisha girl, china doll, or Suzie Wong&quot;.

<text>The IBM 1710 was a process control system that IBM introduced in March 1961. It used either a 1620 I or a 1620 II Computer and specialized I/O devices (e.g., IBM 1711 analog-to-digital converter and digital-to-analog converter, IBM 1712 discrete I/O and analog multiplexer, factory floor operator control panels).

The IBM 1620 used in the 1710 system was modified in several ways, the most obvious was the addition of a very primitive hardware interrupt mechanism.

The 1710 was used by paper mills, oil refineries and electric companies.

<text>The District line is a London Underground line running from in the east and Edgware Road in the west to in west London, where it splits into multiple branches. One branch runs to in south-west London and a short branch, with a limited service, only runs for one stop to . The main route continues west from Earl&#x27;s Court to after which it divides again into two western branches, to Richmond and .

Printed in green on the Tube map, the line serves 60 stations (more than any other Underground line) over . It is the only Underground line to use a bridge to traverse the River Thames, crossing on both the Wimbledon and Richmond branches. The track and stations between and are shared with the Hammersmith &amp; City line, and between and and on the Edgware Road branch they are shared with the Circle line. Some of the stations between and are shared with the Piccadilly line. Unlike London&#x27;s deep-level lines, the railway tunnels are just below the surface, and the trains are of a similar size to those on British main lines.

The District line is the busiest of the sub-surface lines and the fifth-busiest line overall on the Underground, with over 250 million passenger journeys recorded in 2019. 

The original Metropolitan District Railway (as it was then called) opened in December 1868 from South Kensington to as part of a plan for a below-ground &quot;inner circle&quot; connecting London&#x27;s main line termini. At first, services were operated using wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives. Electrification was financed by the American Charles Yerkes, and electric services began in 1905. The railway was absorbed by the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933. In the first half of the 1930s, the Piccadilly line took over the Uxbridge and Hounslow branches, although a peak-hour District line service ran on the Hounslow branch until 1964. Kensington (Olympia) has been served by the District line since 1946, and a short branch to closed in 1959. The trains carried guards until one-person operation was introduced in 1985.

The signalling system is being upgraded (as part of the Four Lines Modernisation project) as of September 2019 and the previous D Stock trains were fully replaced by seven-car S Stock trains in April 2017.

== History ==
=== District Railway ===

The Metropolitan District Railway (commonly known as the District Railway) was formed to build and operate part of an underground &#x27;inner circle&#x27; connecting London&#x27;s railway termini. The first line opened in December 1868, with services from South Kensington to Westminster; these were operated by the Metropolitan Railway using wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives. By 1871, when the District began operating its own trains, the railway had extended to West Brompton and a terminus at Mansion House. A curve from Earl&#x27;s Court onto the West London Railway was used by the London &amp; North Western Railway (L&amp;NWR) for a service to and the Great Western Railway for a service to Moorgate via Paddington. Between 1 March 1883 and 30 September 1885, the District Railway ran trains between Mansion House and Windsor, via Paddington. Stations after Ealing Broadway (the current terminus) were West Ealing, Hanwell, Southall, Hayes &amp; Harlington, West Drayton, Langley, Slough, and Windsor. The service was discontinued because it was uneconomic.

Hammersmith was reached from Earl&#x27;s Court, services were extended to Richmond over the tracks of the London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR), and branches reached Ealing Broadway, Hounslow and Wimbledon. As part of the project that completed the Circle line in October 1884, the District began to serve Whitechapel. Services began running to Upminster in 1902, after a link to the London, Tilbury &amp; Southend Railway (LT&amp;SR) had been built.
At the start of the 20th century, the District was seeing increased competition from the new electric underground tube lines and trams, and the use of steam locomotives underground led to unpopular smoke-filled stations and carriages. The American Charles Yerkes, who was later to form the Underground Electric Railways of London, financed the needed electrification of the railway and the first electric services ran from Ealing to South Harrow in 1903. Electric multiple-units were introduced on other services in 1905, and East Ham became the eastern terminus. Electric locomotives were used on the L&amp;NWR services from Mansion House to Earl&#x27;s Court, and in later years exchanged for a steam locomotive on LT&amp;SR services from Southend to Ealing Broadway at Barking.

Hounslow and Uxbridge were served by 2 or 3-car shuttles from Mill Hill Park (now Acton Town); some trains also served South Acton and central London in the peaks. Services were extended again to Barking in 1908 and Upminster in 1932. In 1932 Piccadilly line trains were extended from Hammersmith to South Harrow, taking over the District service from Acton Town to South Harrow, although the District continued to provide a shuttle from South Harrow to Uxbridge. In 1933, Piccadilly line trains reached Hounslow West, the District continuing to run services with an off-peak shuttle from South Acton to Hounslow.

=== London Transport ===
On 1 July 1933, the District Railway amalgamated with other Underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board, and from 23 October 1933 Piccadilly line trains ran through to Uxbridge and the District line shuttle was withdrawn. Most of the trailer cars on the District line were the 1904–1905 B Stock type with wooden bodies, but motor cars were less than fifteen years old. The 1935–1940 New Works Programme saw the Q Stock formed from these motor cars, upgraded with electro-pneumatic brakes and guard controlled air-operated doors, and the trailers replaced with new vehicles. The off-peak District line services on the Hounslow branch were withdrawn on 29 April 1935 and South Acton served by a shuttle to Acton Town.
The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) had taken over the L&amp;NWR railway&#x27;s service from Earl&#x27;s Court and by the Second World War this had been cut back to an electric Earl&#x27;s Court to Willesden Junction shuttle. Following bombing of the West London Line in 1940, the LMS and the Metropolitan line services over the West London Line were both suspended. This left the Olympia exhibition centre without a railway service, so after the war the Kensington Addison Road station was renamed Kensington (Olympia) and served by a District line shuttle from Earl&#x27;s Court. R Stock, composed of new cars and the Q Stock trailers that had been built in 1938, replaced the trains with hand-operated sliding doors that remained. The new trains were built between 1949 and 1959, and after 1952 trains were constructed from aluminium, saving weight. One train was left unpainted as an experiment and considered a success, so between 1963 and 1968 trains were left unpainted or painted white or grey to match. The transfer of CO/CP Stock from the Metropolitan line in the early 1960s allowed some of the Q stock to be scrapped. The slow tracks on the former LT&amp;SR line to Upminster were shared with steam locomotive hauled goods and passenger services, until 1961 when the District took over exclusive use of the DC electrified lines.

The South Acton shuttle was withdrawn on 28 February 1959, followed by the peak hour District line through service to Hounslow on 9 October 1964. The whole District line service could not run through Aldgate East as this station was also served by Hammersmith &amp; City trains, so some trains terminated at a bay platform at Mansion House, leaving the line east to Tower Hill overcrowded. Tower Hill station was also cramped, so the station was rebuilt with three platforms on a new site. This opened in 1967 and a year later trains reversed at the new station.

Services were operated with 6 cars off-peak and 8 cars during peak hours until 1971, when trains were reformed as fixed 7-car trains, and some 6-car trains for the Edgware Road branch. The CO/CP and R Stock were replaced in the late 1970s by new trains with unpainted aluminium bodies. A shorter train was needed on the Edgware Road branch due to the platform lengths so more of the C stock units, then already in use on the Circle and Hammersmith and City lines, were built. The rest of the District line could use longer trains and new D Stock trains were introduced between 1979 and 1983. Driver-only operation of the trains was proposed in 1972, but due to conflict with the trade unions was not introduced on the District line until 1985. In 2003, the infrastructure of the District line was partly privatised in a public–private partnership, managed by the Metronet consortium. Metronet went into administration in 2007 and the local government body Transport for London took over responsibilities.

=== Railway line ===

The District line is long and serves 60 stations. The line is electrified with a four-rail DC system: from Upminster to Putney Bridge, Olympia, Barons Court, and Edgware Road a central conductor rail is now energised at and a rail outside the running rail at , giving a potential difference of . The section from Barons Court to Ealing Broadway remains at with a rail outside the running rail at , giving a potential difference of . The two sections over which main line trains run, from East Putney to Wimbledon, and from Gunnersbury to Richmond, have the centre rail bonded to the running rails. West of Earl&#x27;s Court, there are four branches. At Ealing Broadway station, the District line has platforms north of the Central line and the Great Western Main Line out of Paddington. After about , the line meets the Piccadilly line Uxbridge branch at Hanger Lane junction, and the tracks are then shared through Ealing Common station until Acton Town station, where the Piccadilly line Heathrow branch joins. From Acton Town to Barons Court, the line has four tracks, paired by use: the District line uses the outer pair and the non-stopping Piccadilly line trains use the inner pair. At Richmond station, the Mildmay line and District line platforms are north of the Waterloo to Reading line through platforms. The two tracks which cross the Thames at Kew Railway Bridge are shared with the Mildmay line trains until Gunnersbury junction, after which the District line tracks join the four-track District and Piccadilly lines just before Turnham Green station.

On the main line, there are cross-platform interchanges at Acton Town, Hammersmith and Barons Court stations, after which the Piccadilly line tracks descend into tunnels, while the District line becomes two tracks through West Kensington station. Before the line enters Earl&#x27;s Court station, the short Kensington (Olympia) branch joins at a flat junction and the Wimbledon branch at a grade-separated junction. On the Wimbledon branch, the District line at Wimbledon station is west of the South West Main Line platforms, then the two-track line has a junction at East Putney station with the Hounslow Loop Line, before passing over the River Thames on Fulham Railway Bridge; the line continues by passing under the West London Railway and coming alongside it at West Brompton station before the junction with the main line and the four-platform Earl&#x27;s Court station.

East of Earl&#x27;s Court there is a grade-separated junction off the main line to the Edgware Road branch. This follows the Circle line after High Street Kensington station where there are also two bay platforms for the District line. After Paddington station this branch joins the Hammersmith &amp; City line at Praed Street junction, before terminating at the four-platform Edgware Road. The main line joins the Circle line at Gloucester Road and the line and stations are in cut-and-cover tunnels, meeting the Thames at Westminster station, after which the railway is in the Victoria Embankment on the north bank of the river. At Tower Hill station, there is a bay platform.

After Tower Hill, the Circle line diverges, the District line joining the Hammersmith &amp; City line just before Aldgate East station. The line passes over the Windrush line at Whitechapel station before continuing on the Whitechapel &amp; Bow Railway to Bow Road, where the line surfaces, and Bromley-by-Bow, where the line runs alongside the London, Tilbury and Southend line from Fenchurch Street station. There is an interchange with this line at the next station, West Ham, as well as with the Jubilee line and the Docklands Light Railway. There is a bay platform at the next station, Plaistow, and the Hammersmith &amp; City line terminates at Barking station. The District line follows the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway for another eight stations, before terminating at Upminster station.

The line mainly runs in cut and cover tunnels between West Kensington and Bow Road, including the Edgware Road branch. However, due to the nature of sub-surface lines, the cutting is occasionally left open both at and between stations for ventilation. West of Earls Court, the line is entirely surface level, with the exception of the Hammersmith and Fulham Broadway stations, which are in cuttings built over by recent developments. There is also a small section of tunnel between Southfields and East Putney.

== Services ==

The off-peak service since 9 December 2012 is:
* 6 tph (trains per hour) Ealing Broadway to Upminster
* 6 tph Richmond to Upminster
* 3 tph Wimbledon to Tower Hill 
* 3 tph Wimbledon to Barking
* 6 tph Wimbledon to Edgware Road
* 3 tph Kensington (Olympia) to High Street Kensington at weekends, as well as 7 trains daily to or from Kensington (Olympia) on weekdays, of which 1 continue to Edgware Road. A 2 tph service operates on weekday exhibition days.

This gives a service of 18 trains per hour (a train every 3–4 minutes) between Earl&#x27;s Court and Tower Hill. Together with the Circle line, there are 24 trains per hour (a train every 2.5 minutes) between Gloucester Road and Tower Hill. 208 million passenger journeys were made on the District line in 2011/12.

There are additional trains during peak hours. The central section from Earl&#x27;s Court to Aldgate East is in Zone 1 and to the west Ealing Broadway and Wimbledon are in Zone 3 and Richmond in Zone 4. To the east the line runs to Upminster in Zone 6.
== Rolling stock ==
=== S Stock ===
The current 7-car S Stock trains began to enter service on the line in 2013, beginning with services between Olympia and West Ham, gradually replacing the C and D Stock. Like the 8-car variants now in use on the Metropolitan line, these trains are part of Bombardier&#x27;s Movia family, with air-conditioning, as the sub-surface tunnels (unlike those on the deep-level tube lines) are able to disperse the exhausted hot air.

With a top speed of , a 7-car S Stock train has a capacity of 865 passengers compared to 739 for a 6-car C Stock train and 827 for a 6-car D Stock train. With a length of , the S Stock trains are longer than the long C stock trains, and station platforms have been lengthened. The trains have regenerative brakes, allowing them to return around 20 per cent of their energy to the network. Traction voltage was increased in 2017 from nominal 630 V to 750 V to give better performance and allow the trains to return more energy to the network through their regenerative brakes. 630 V section remains Barons Court-Ealing Broadway. The service was run by D78 Stock until April 2017.

=== Depots ===
The S Stock trains are maintained at Ealing Common Depot and Upminster Depot. Ealing Common Depot was built by the District Railway when it was electrified in the early 1900s. Upminster depot was built 1956–1958 when the District line tracks were segregated. Trains may also be stabled in the sidings east of Barking alongside Hammersmith &amp; City Line trains.

== Four Lines Modernisation (4LM) ==
It was planned that a new signalling system would be used first on the sub-surface lines from the end of 2016, but signalling contractor Bombardier was released from its contract by agreement in December 2013 amid heavy criticism of the procurement process and London Underground subsequently awarded the contract for the project to Thales in August 2015.

With the introduction of S7 Stock, the track, electrical supply, and signalling systems are being upgraded in a programme planned to increase peak-hour capacity on the line by 27 per cent by the end of 2023. A single control room for the sub-surface railway opened at Hammersmith on 6 May 2018, and Communications Based Train Control (CBTC) provided by Thales will progressively replace &#x27;fixed block&#x27; signalling equipment dating back to the 1940s.

The rollout of CBTC has been split into sections, each known as a Signal Migration Area (SMA), and are located on the line as follows:


== List of stations ==

=== Open stations ===
&quot;In order from west to east&quot;
=== Previously served stations ===
Now served by the Piccadilly line, the Hounslow branch opened to the now closed Hounslow Town on 1 May 1883 and was extended on a separate route to Hounslow West on 21 July 1884. The District line served the present Piccadilly line stations between Acton Town and Hounslow West as well as the former station of Osterley &amp; Spring Grove (closed 1934) until District line 
services were withdrawn on 9 October 1964. From 13 June 1905 until 28 February 1959, the District line ran a one-stop shuttle between Acton Town and South Acton.

Also now served by the Piccadilly line, the South Harrow branch opened from north of Ealing Common on 28 June 1903 and extended over Metropolitan Railway tracks to Uxbridge on 1 March 1910. The District line served the present Piccadilly line stations between North Ealing and South Harrow until 4 July 1932 and the stations between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge until 25 October 1933. The District Railway also served the now closed Park Royal &amp; Twyford Abbey until its replacement by Park Royal on 6 July 1931.

Between 1 March 1883 and 30 September 1885, the District Railway provided a service to Windsor, serving: West Ealing, Hanwell, Southall, Hayes &amp; Harlington, West Drayton, Langley, Slough, and Windsor.

From 1910 to 1939, the District line&#x27;s eastbound service ran as far as Southend-on-Sea and Shoeburyness.

Currently part of the East London line, the District Railway branched away from the main line west of Whitechapel and served stations between Shadwell and New Cross from 1 October 1884 until 31 July 1905.

Between Whitechapel and Aldgate East, the District line served St. Mary&#x27;s (Whitechapel Road) from 1 October 1884 to 30 April 1938, closing when Aldgate East station moved.

From 25 September 1882 until its closure on 12 October 1884, Tower of London station was served by the District Railway.

===Abandoned plans===
In 1911, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London agreed to finance the construction of the Wimbledon and Sutton Railway and eight new stations for the extension of District Railway services to Sutton. Construction of the line was delayed by World War I and, as part of a deal with the Southern Railway (SR) to agree to the extension of the City and South London Railway to Morden, construction of the line was taken over by the SR.

===Fictional stations===
Walford East is a fictional District line station in the BBC television soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, and since February 2010 episodes have used Computer-generated imagery (CGI) of District line trains running into the station. The production tube map situates this station in place of Bromley-by-Bow.

In the &quot;Sherlock&quot; episode &quot;The Empty Hearse&quot;, a fictional unopened terminus station called Sumatra Road (situated underneath the Houses of Parliament as a disused branch line from Westminster Station) was created for the episode&#x27;s story of a terrorism plot. The station was actually filmed at Aldwych with ex-Northern line 1972 stock which caused continuity errors as deep-level trains and tunnels were used when the District line is sub-surface.

West Ashfield tube station, despite its name, is a mock-up District line station in the third floor of a building used for training of TfL staff in a simulated environment; the &quot;station&quot; is slated to be closed by 2024. Maps within the facility show West Ashfield as a station on the District line between West Kensington and Earl&#x27;s Court.

<text>The East London line is a railway line running north to south through the East, Docklands and South areas of London. It is used by London Overground services. It was previously a line of the London Underground.

Built in 1869 by the East London Railway Company, which reused the Thames Tunnel intended for horse-drawn carriages, the line became part of the London Underground network in 1933. After nearly 75 years as part of that network, it closed on 22 December 2007 for an extensive refurbishment and expansion, reopening as part of the Overground network in April 2010. Phase 2, which links the line to the South London line with a terminus at , opened on 9 December 2012, creating an orbital railway around inner London.

In 2024, London Overground services on the line were rebranded the [[Windrush line]].

==History==

===Establishment of the East London Railway===
The East London Railway was created by the East London Railway Company, a consortium of six railway companies: the Great Eastern Railway (GER), the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR), the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR), the South Eastern Railway (SER), the Metropolitan Railway, and the District Railway. The latter two operated what are now the Metropolitan, Circle, District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines of the London Underground. The incorporation of the ELR took place on 26 May 1865 with the aim of providing a link between the LB&amp;SCR, GER and SER lines.

The companies reused the Thames Tunnel, built by Marc and Isambard Kingdom Brunel between 1825 and 1843 for horse-drawn carriages. The tunnel, with generous headroom and two carriageways separated by arches, connected Wapping on the north bank of the Thames with Rotherhithe on the south bank. A triumph of civil engineering, it was a commercial failure and by the 1860s it had become an unpleasant and disreputable place.

The tunnel was the most easterly land connection between the north and south banks of the Thames, close to the docks on both banks of the river, and was not far from mainline railways at either end. Converting the tunnel for railway use thus offered a means of providing a cross-Thames rail link. On 25 September 1865 the East London Railway Company took ownership of the tunnel at a cost of £800,000. Over the next four years the company built a railway through the tunnel to connect with the existing lines. The company&#x27;s engineer was Sir John Hawkshaw, who was also responsible for the major re-design and completion of I K Brunel&#x27;s long-abandoned Clifton Suspension Bridge at Bristol. The section of the railway construction work from Wapping to Bishopsgate, which was very difficult, was carried out by the firm &quot;T. &amp; C. Walker and Co.&quot; (Thomas Andrew Walker and his younger brother Charles). 

The line opened in stages as financing became available:

* 7 December 1869: (then New Cross) to opened, operated by the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR), with intermediate stations at Deptford Road (now Surrey Quays) and .
* 13 March 1871: A spur opened from just south of what is now Surrey Quays station to the South London line&#x27;s Old Kent Road station. Passenger services were withdrawn from 1 June 1911 and freight last used the line in 1964; the track was subsequently removed. This alignment was relaid and restored to passenger service by London Overground in late 2012.
* 10 April 1876: Wapping to , through a cut-and-cover tunnel constructed in part along the bottom of an infilled dock. At Shoreditch a connection was made with the Great Eastern Railway to . Intermediate stations were at and Whitechapel.
* 1 April 1880: A spur to (South Eastern Railway) opened.
* 3 March 1884: A spur to the Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railways opened south of Whitechapel using St Mary&#x27;s Curve. This enabled Metropolitan Railway and Metropolitan District Railway (District) trains to commence through services to the East London Railway later that year. Although passenger services via this spur ceased in 1939, it was retained to transfer empty trains to the rest of the sub-surface network.

===Early use===
The East London Railway Company owned the infrastructure but it was operated by its controlling railways. Steam trains were initially operated by the GER, LB&amp;SCR and the SER. The LB&amp;SCR used its LBSCR A1 Class Terrier locomotives, which William Stroudley designed partly with this line in mind. It carried both passenger and goods trains; the LB&amp;SCR operated between Liverpool Street and Croydon, the SER running between and Liverpool Street from April 1880 until March 1884. From March to September 1884 the SER service ran from Addiscombe to St Mary&#x27;s (MR &amp; MDR Joint Station). Metropolitan Railway services from St Mary&#x27;s to (SER) and Metropolitan District Railway services from St Mary&#x27;s to (LB&amp;SCR) commenced on 1 October 1884. On 6 October through services started from Hammersmith (Hammersmith &amp; City) to New Cross (SER) and from (MDR) to New Cross (LB&amp;SCR).


Before the development of the Kent coalfields in the early part of the 20th century, house coal from the north for distribution in south London and as far afield as Maidstone and Brighton was an important source of revenue. Access at the north end of the line was difficult: trains were limited to 26 wagons and had to be shunted into the Great Eastern&#x27;s Liverpool Street station and drawn forward onto the ELR. To avoid this reversal, a line was planned from the ELR north of Whitechapel to the GER at Bethnal Green. Acts for this were passed in 1866 and 1868. When the GER route to Hackney Downs Junction, now Hackney Downs, was constructed in 1872, the route was altered to connect at Cambridge Heath, with the &#x27; (34 &amp; 35 Vict. c. cl) as an abandonment act for the previous route, and two new acts the &#x27; (39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. lii) and the (40 &amp; 41 Vict. c. clvi). A short length of the latter tunnel was built, and from October 1900 additional capacity was offered by a wagon lift, carrying two ten-ton wagons, from the Great Eastern coal depot at Spitalfields to a siding laid in the tunnel stub. The surface junction was taken up in 1966 and the lift closed in 1967, after a fire at the Spitalfields depot.

When the Metropolitan District Railway was electrified in 1905 it ceased using the ELR, the last trains running on 31 July 1905; the Metropolitan Railway suspended its service after 2 December 1906. LB&amp;SCR and GER services continued, and SER services recommenced on 3 December 1906.

The line was electrified, with the controlling railways funding the upgrade and the Metropolitan Railway providing the rolling stock. Electric services began on 31 March 1913 and ran from the two southern termini to Shoreditch and via and . In 1914 the service to South Kensington was diverted to , on what is now the Hammersmith &amp; City line.
After the 1923 grouping the goods service was operated by London and North Eastern Railway (as successors to the GER), with the Metropolitan Railway continuing to provide passenger services. Ownership was transferred to the Southern Railway by the (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5. c. l), but the railway continued to be leased to the joint vommittee, now comprising the Southern Railway (47.5%), the LNER (17.5%), the Metropolitan Railway (17.5%), and the District Railway (17.5%). 
===London Underground era===



In 1933, the East London Railway came under the control of the London Passenger Transport Board. Although the infrastructure was still privately owned, passenger services were operated as the &quot;East London Branch&quot; of the Metropolitan line. The railways were nationalised in 1948, and became part of the British Transport Commission along with the Underground. Goods services continued to use the line until 1962, with occasional passenger trains from Liverpool Street until 1966. The short length of track connecting Shoreditch to Liverpool St was removed in 1966. The service to Shoreditch was reduced, with becoming the northern terminus for much of the time; by the time station closed in 2006, it was only open at peak times on weekdays and most of Sundays (for Brick Lane Market).

Services to and from stations further west were curtailed during the early part of the Underground era. The service to Hammersmith was reduced to peak hours only in 1936 and withdrawn in 1939, leaving the East London branch as an isolated line. Until 1999, its only passenger interchange to the rest of the Underground was at Whitechapel, with interchanges to main line trains at the two New Cross stations. In the 1980s and 1990s, the line gained two important new connections: became an interchange with the Docklands Light Railway in 1987, and a station was added at in 1999 for interchange with the Jubilee line. The line was closed entirely between March 1995 and March 1998 for major maintenance and refurbishment works, during which time a rail-replacement bus service operated.

The identity of the East London line changed considerably during the London Underground era. On Tube maps between 1933 and 1968 it was depicted in the same colour as the Metropolitan line. In 1970, it was renamed the &quot;Metropolitan line — East London Section&quot;, in Metropolitan line purple with a white stripe down the middle. In the 1980s it became a line in its own right (though it was still grouped operationally with the Metropolitan line) and from 1990 its colour on the map changed to orange. In 1995, London Underground threatened to close the line if it did not receive listed building consent from the London Docklands Development Corporation for the shotcreting of four arches of Thames Tunnel. Maintenance passed to the Metronet consortium in 2003 under a public-private partnership, although the operation of trains continued to be the responsibility of Transport for London (TfL). According to TfL, the line carried 10.7 million passengers per year before its temporary closure in 2007.

====Physical characteristics====
The line was the only Underground line not to penetrate Travelcard Zone 1 and (apart from the Moorgate to Finsbury Park service, transferred to British Rail in 1976) the only line designed and constructed for mainline trains. At in length it was the second-shortest line (after the Waterloo &amp; City line), with nine stations and an end-to-end journey time of 14 minutes. It ran in tunnel from Whitechapel to Surrey Quays, with the remainder on the surface or in cutting. Whilst much of the line was built as cut-and-cover, it also contained overground and tube construction features. The deepest point is at Wapping station, constructed in the Thames Tunnel&#x27;s original entrance shaft below the surface.

It connected with South Eastern Main Line services at New Cross and Brighton Main Line services at New Cross Gate. Underground connections were at Canada Water (Jubilee line) and Whitechapel (District and Hammersmith &amp; City Lines). A non-contiguous connection with the Docklands Light Railway was at , with the DLR station some away on a viaduct. Although the interchange was via the street, through ticketing was permitted.

A link with the Metropolitan and District lines was made just south of Whitechapel via St Mary&#x27;s Curve. This has been out of passenger use since 1939 but was still used to transfer rolling stock to and from the Metropolitan line&#x27;s main depot at Neasden. The curve can easily be seen on the northbound and eastbound approaches to Whitechapel station, although a temporary wall was built across the line in January 2008, close to the junction with the District line..

Most of the line was double track, with Shoreditch station and the final sections into the southern termini single track, the latter because of lack of space. This required trains to alternate between the two southern termini.

====Rolling stock====
The line used Metropolitan line A60 and A62 sub-surface rolling stock built by Cravens of Sheffield in two batches between 1960 and 1962. It was upgraded between 1995 and 1998 with improved suspension, lighting, heating and ventilation. The rolling stock was regularly interchanged with that used on the main Metropolitan line and usually carried both East London and Metropolitan line maps, but ELL trains were four-car units with a driving cab at each end, unlike Metropolitan line trains, which, aside from the Chesham shuttle, ran as eight-car trains. Metropolitan line trains were mostly two single-ended units coupled together with fully operational driving cabs at each end: the Met could use any ELL trains, but the ELL could use only double-ended units.

Seven four-car trains operated the line (six off-peak, seven during peak hours when Shoreditch was open). Off peak, train seven became the spare. The line operated some of the shortest trains on the network, necessitated by short platforms. The small number of trains made the line particularly sensitive to disruption caused by vandalism, train faults or staff shortages. Sometimes in the early 2000s only two trains were running. Trains were operated by just a driver: the decision to withdraw the guards prompted an unsuccessful strike by the National Union of Railwaymen in May 1985.

Light maintenance and stabling took place at a small depot near New Cross, with heavier work at the main Metropolitan line depot at Neasden. Between 1985 and 1987, D78 stock operated the line before being replaced by A60 and A62 stock. During the 1970s the line was operated by 1938 Tube stock.

====Stations====
The stations in operation during most of the London Underground era, in order from north to south, were as follows:

===Conversion to Overground ===

Engineering work on the East London line extension started in 2005 and the underground service ended in December 2007.

In 2007 London Buses route ELW Whitechapel – Shadwell – Wapping was introduced, operating every 10 minutes, every 15 minutes at evenings and weekends. It was operated with route-branded single-deck buses. Starting on 23 December 2007 it was extended from Whitechapel to Shoreditch (Monday-Friday 07:00-10:30 &amp; 15:30–20:30, Sunday 07:00-15:30) from 19 July 2008. The frequency of the route was cut to four buses per hour in September 2009. It was reduced to weekends-only from 28 April 2010, and withdrawn on 9 May 2010.

Between 2006 and May 2008 other rail replacement buses were provided. Route ELS Whitechapel – Shoreditch (Monday-Friday 07:00-10:30 &amp; 15:30–20:30, Sunday 07:00-15:30) commenced 10 June 2006 and was withdrawn on 19 July 2008. It was replaced by a peak-hour extension of route ELW.

London Buses route ELC New Cross Gate – New Cross – Surrey Quays – Canada Water (Monday-Friday every 5–10 minutes, weekends every 15 minutes) started on 23 December 2007. It was withdrawn on 25 September 2009 following a 40% drop in passenger numbers. Transport for London estimated that this saved around £1 million over the period to June 2010.

London Buses route ELP Canada Water – Rotherhithe (every 15 minutes) began on 23 December 2007 and was withdrawn on 24 February 2008 due to lack of use: tickets were valid between Bermondsey and Canada Water on standard route 381.

Unlike the previous East London line closure, no replacement bus service was provided across the River Thames through the Rotherhithe Tunnel. London Transport was concerned that demand would be so high and buses would be so small that the frequency could have to be one bus every 30 seconds. There was also an issue that the Rotherhithe Tunnel is restricted to vehicles with a width no more than , which had been employed on previous occasions. However, by 2007 no such vehicles were commercially available that were low-floor compliant: the only ones with this width, as previously used, were minibuses with higher floors. As bus policy by this time was 100% low floor, it meant that no such service could be provided.

A limited train service was introduced on 27 April 2010 and full service began on 23 May 2010.

===History of the extended route===
Mostly on viaduct, the route from Highbury and Islington to Shoreditch was opened in 1865. It was constructed by the North London Railway as its city branch to allow its passenger trains to reach the City of London. As originally built the line had four stations, at Dalston Junction, Haggerston, Shoreditch and a large terminus at Broad Street. At Dalston Junction, a line branched to the North London line eastwards, allowing services to Hackney, Bow and Poplar (East India Road). This route closed to passengers in 1944 and goods on 4 July 1966.

At its peak, Broad Street was the third-busiest station in London (after Liverpool Street and Victoria). At the start of the 20th century, more than one train per minute arrived or departed Broad Street during rush hour, with over 27 million passengers in 1902. Intermediate station traffic stagnated due to bus and tram competition, and Haggerston and Shoreditch stations were closed in 1940 following bomb damage in World War II. The line remained busy up to the 1950s, receiving traffic from the East Coast Main Line, West Coast Main Line and other routes. However, it declined following the war and was closed on 30 June 1986. While Broad Street station&#x27;s site was immediately sold for office use, becoming the Broadgate development, the route north was mothballed. The present Haggerston and Dalston Junction stations have been built next to and on the original sites, but Shoreditch High Street station is on a new alignment connecting the two routes.
==Extension==
===Phase 1===
The former line was extended northwards from Whitechapel, with new stations at , , and using of new trackbed between Whitechapel and the Broad Street viaduct, and disused trackbed for most of rest of the distance. A further extension to was opened in February 2011.

It was extended south to connect to the arm of the Brighton Main Line, linked via a northbound flyover north of New Cross Gate. Other than the new flyover and some associated works around New Cross Gate, it uses almost entirely existing track, running south to West Croydon via , , , Sydenham, , (by way of a branch), and .

The official opening of most of phase 1 of the East London line extension took place on 23 May 2010. Use of the line was forecast to increase from the previous 10.4 million passengers per year to 35.4 million, and to 50 million when phase 2 is finished. Transport for London acquired 20 new four-car Bombardier &quot;Capitalstar&quot; electric multiple units to operate on the line. Unlike the dual-voltage 378s on the North London and West London lines, the East London line units can only receive power from the third rail electrification, although, like all modern EMUs, they have the potential to be retro-fitted.

The track and the northern extension remain under TfL ownership, and the stations from Dalston Junction to Surrey Quays are part of the London Overground network. The extension runs northwards from Whitechapel to , and south to and West Croydon.

===Highbury &amp; Islington extension===

The line was extended northwards to on 28 February 2011, two months earlier than previously announced, with eight trains per hour during most of the day. The first train, with headcode 9A20, was the 09:55 Highbury &amp; Islington – Crystal Palace, which departed on time from platform 2 and was formed of a four-car class 378 unit.

===East London line extension phase 2===
A further link opened in 2012 from south of via the Network Rail South London line to via , , , and . A new station at was also planned, but this was put on hold in 2009, though a suitable &#x27;box&#x27; is being provided as part of the works to facilitate later implementation. The service from Highbury &amp; Islington to Clapham Junction commenced on 9 December 2012. There are three services per day that run from Wandsworth Road to Battersea Park to maintain a service along that route as a parliamentary train.

The extension uses an alignment between Surrey Quays and Queens Road Peckham stations that had not seen services since 1913. The &quot;new&quot; section diverges from the East London line south of Surrey Quays station and joins the South London line just north of the closed Old Kent Road station. The route skirts the Bridgehouse Meadows public open space; this was used as the construction site, then restored to public use after completion. The former pedestrian bridge and support piers over Surrey Canal Road were demolished as a precursor to building the railway bridge. The planned lowering of Surrey Canal Road and associated work to the services were not carried out as a higher elevation was adopted, with a 1 in 30 (3.3 per cent) incline allowing the railway to cross at a suitable height.

=== Train lengthening ===
To cope with increased demand, the class 378 units which operate on the line have been extended to five cars. Although the new stations on the line have platforms which are either at least five cars long or provide space for platform extensions, some stations cannot be extended and so selective door opening is required.

==Service==
The combined East London and South London line service is described by Transport for London as the Highbury &amp; Islington to New Cross, Clapham Junction, Crystal Palace and West Croydon route. As of the December 2023 timetable the typical off-peak service pattern is:

A Friday and Saturday night service was introduced between Dalston Junction and New Cross Gate (initially not stopping at Whitechapel) from December 2017.

===Renaming===
In July 2023, TfL announced that it would be giving each of the six Overground services unique names by the end of the following year. In February 2024, it was confirmed that the service running on the East London and South London lines would be named the &quot;Windrush line&quot; (to honour the Windrush generation of immigrants to the area from the Caribbean) and would be coloured red on the updated network map.

<text>The Hammersmith &amp; City line is a London Underground line that runs between Hammersmith in west London and in east London. Coloured pink on the Tube map, it serves 29 stations over . Between and it skirts the City of London, the capital&#x27;s financial heart, hence the line&#x27;s name. Its tunnels are just below the surface and are a similar size to those on British main lines. Most of the track and all stations are shared with the Circle, District or Metropolitan lines. Over 141 million passenger journeys are made each year on the Hammersmith &amp; City line.

In 1863, the Metropolitan Railway began the world&#x27;s first underground railway service between and Farringdon with wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives. The following year, a railway west from Paddington to Hammersmith was opened and this soon became operated and owned jointly by the Metropolitan and Great Western Railway companies. The line was then extended to the east, in stages, reaching the East London Railway in 1884. The line was electrified in 1906, and, in 1936, after the Metropolitan Railway had been absorbed by the London Passenger Transport Board, some Hammersmith &amp; City line trains were extended over the former District Railway line to Barking. The Hammersmith &amp; City route was shown on the Tube map as part of the Metropolitan line until 30 July 1990, when it was redesignated as a separate line.

Starting in 2015, the signalling system was upgraded as part of a programme to increase peak-hour capacity on the line. The six-car C Stock trains were replaced from 2012 to 2014 by new seven-car S Stock trains.

The line runs parallel to the Great Western Main Line between Paddington and , and parallel to the London, Tilbury and Southend line between and Barking.

==History==

===Metropolitan Railway===

The first line built by the Metropolitan Railway (Met) was from Paddington to near Smithfield, near London&#x27;s financial heart in the City; with gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives. Authorised by the (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. clxiv), and opened on 10 January 1863, it was the world&#x27;s first underground railway. The line was built mostly under the New Road using the &quot;cut-and-cover&quot; method between Paddington and King&#x27;s Cross and then in tunnel and cuttings beside Farringdon Road. Supported by the Met and the Great Western Railway (GWR), the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway (H&amp;CR) was built from the GWR&#x27;s main line a mile west of Paddington station to the developing suburbs of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Hammersmith. Built on viaduct largely across open fields, the line opened on 13 June 1864 with a GWR service from Farringdon to Hammersmith, services to Addison Road (now Kensington (Olympia)) on the West London Railway via a link at Latimer Road starting a few weeks later. From 1865, the Met ran trains to Hammersmith and the GWR trains to Addison Road. In 1867, the line became jointly owned by the two companies. In 1871, two additional tracks parallel to the GWR between Westbourne Park and Paddington were brought into use for the H&amp;CR, and in 1878 the flat crossing at Westbourne Park was replaced by a dive-under. A year earlier some services had been extended via London &amp; South Western Railway&#x27;s Hammersmith (Grove Road) railway station and their line to Richmond.

The railway was extended east of Farringdon and a terminus opened at Aldgate on 18 November 1876. The Met wished to access the South Eastern Railway via the East London Railway (ELR) and jointly with the District Railway built lines from their Mansion House station to the Met&#x27;s Aldgate station and east from Aldgate to reach the ELR at Whitechapel. In October 1884, the Met extended some Hammersmith services over the ELR to New Cross.

In 1902, the Whitechapel &amp; Bow Railway was opened, linking the District Railway at Whitechapel to the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&amp;SR) at an above-ground junction at Bow, to the west of Bromley-by-Bow station, and some District services were extended from Whitechapel to East Ham. When the line was electrified in 1906 services to Richmond were withdrawn and the western termini became Hammersmith and Kensington (Addison Road), and to the east services were diverted from the ELR to Whitechapel, until the ELR was electrified in 1914 and services ran from Hammersmith to New Cross (SER) and New Cross (LB&amp;SCR). The 6-car electric multiple units were jointly owned by the Met and GWR until 1923 when the GWR sold theirs to the Met.

===London Transport===

On 1 July 1933, the Metropolitan Railway was amalgamated with other Underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board. To relieve congestion on the District line east of from 1936 some Hammersmith &amp; City line trains were diverted from the East London line to Barking. Through trains to New Cross and New Cross Gate were withdrawn in November 1939, the Hammersmith &amp; City line trains terminating at Whitechapel while the longer 8-car Uxbridge line trains ran to Barking. However, this caused operational problems and from 1941 Barking was again served by trains from Hammersmith.

From 1937, new steel O stock trains, with doors remotely operated by the guard, replaced the wooden-bodied trains dating from 1906. It had been intended to operate the new trains with four or six cars, but after initial problems with the traction current only six-car formations were used. Services to Kensington (Olympia) via the curve at Latimer Road were suspended for the duration of World War II after bomb damage to the West London line in 1940. When the similar trains running on the Circle line were lengthened to six cars in 1959 and 1960, the stock of the two lines was integrated with maintenance at Hammersmith depot. Aluminium C Stock trains, with public address systems and originally unpainted, replaced these trains from 1970. One person operation was proposed in 1972, but due to conflict with the trade unions was not introduced until 1984.

===A separate identity===
The Hammersmith &amp; City line was shown on the tube map as part of the Metropolitan line until 1990, when it became separated, and the Metropolitan line became the route from Aldgate to Baker Street and northwards through &quot;Metro-land&quot; to Uxbridge, Watford and Amersham. In 2003, the infrastructure of the Hammersmith &amp; City line was partly privatised in a public–private partnership, managed by the Metronet consortium. Metronet went into administration in 2007 and the local government body Transport for London took over responsibilities. The reconstruction of Whitechapel station for the new Crossrail line required the reversing platforms to be taken out of use and since December 2009 all services have been extended to Plaistow or Barking.

Beginning in 2012, following the complete replacement of the Metropolitan line&#x27;s A Stock with S8 Stock, the C Stock trains of the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines were replaced by the S7 Stock. The Hammersmith &amp; City line received the S7 Stock first, with the first train entering service on 6 July 2012, running a shuttle service between Hammersmith and Moorgate before operating between Hammersmith and Barking on 9 December 2012. By March 2014, all services were provided by S7 Stock trains.

==Route==

The line is long with 29 stations, all of which are shared with other lines.

Almost all of its track is shared with the other London Underground sub-surface lines: from Hammersmith to Baker Street with the Circle line; from Baker Street to Liverpool Street with the Circle and Metropolitan lines; and from Aldgate East station to Barking with the District line. A short section between Paddington and Edgware Road is also shared with the District line, while a short section between Liverpool Street and Aldgate East is not shared with any other line.

The line is electrified with a four-rail DC system: a central conductor rail is energised at and a rail outside the running rails at , giving a potential difference of . 

Much of the double-track railway from the Hammersmith terminus to Westbourne Park station is on a high brick viaduct. After Westbourne Park the line passes beneath the Great Western Main Line re-surfacing at Royal Oak station and running alongside the main lines to Paddington station. The line enters a cutting just west of Paddington, with a cut-and-cover tunnel at the far eastern end of the platforms. It meets the Circle and District lines from Bayswater at Praed Street Junction before passing through Edgware Road station in a cutting. After King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras the line is partly in cutting but mostly in the Clerkenwell Tunnels, just after which it passes over the Ray Street Gridiron that carries the route over the City Widened Lines used for Thameslink services. There are bay platforms at Moorgate. Just before Aldgate the line diverges from the Circle and Metropolitan lines, continuing eastwards to join the District line west of Aldgate East. The line passes over the Windrush line (on the East London line railway) at Whitechapel station continuing on the former Whitechapel &amp; Bow Railway to Bow Road where it surfaces, and then to Bromley-by-Bow, where it runs alongside the London, Tilbury and Southend line from Fenchurch Street. At the next station, West Ham, there is a transfer with the Jubilee line, the Docklands Light Railway and London, Tilbury and Southend line. There is a bay platform at the next station, Plaistow, and the line terminates after two more stations at Barking.

==Services==
, off-peak there are six trains per hour, calling at all stations, and requiring 15 trains for the peak-hour service. Together with the Circle line, over 114 million passenger journeys are made each year. The journey from Hammersmith to Barking takes one hour during off-peak times. The central section from Paddington to Aldgate East is in Fare Zone 1; to the west to Hammersmith and east to Bromley-by-Bow is in Zones 2; East Ham is in both Zones 3 and 4, whilst Barking is in Zone 4 alone.

==Rolling stock==

Services are provided by S7 Stock trains, part of Bombardier&#x27;s Movia family, with air-conditioning as the sub-surface tunnels (unlike those on the deep-level tube lines) are able to disperse the exhausted hot air. These trains have regenerative brakes, returning around 20 per cent of their energy to the network. With a top speed of , a 7-car S Stock train has a capacity of 865 passengers, compared to 739 for the six-car C Stock train it replaced. With a length of , S Stock trains are longer than long C Stock trains and station platforms have been lengthened. Traction voltage was increased in 2017, from the present nominal 630 V to 750 V to give better performance and allow the trains to return more energy to the network through their regenerative brakes.

==Depot==
The line&#x27;s depot is at Hammersmith, close to Hammersmith station, built by the Great Western Railway to be operated by the Metropolitan Railway when the joint railway was electrified in the early 20th century. Sidings at Barking and near High Street Kensington (Triangle Sidings) stable trains overnight. Sidings at Farringdon were used during the C stock era; due to the greater length of the new S stock trains, these are no longer in use.

== Four Lines Modernisation ==
It was planned that a new signalling system would be used first on the sub-surface lines from the end of 2016, but signalling contractor Bombardier was released from its contract by agreement in December 2013 amid heavy criticism of the procurement process and London Underground subsequently awarded the contract for the project to Thales in August 2015.

With the introduction of S7 Stock, the track, electrical supply, and signalling systems are being upgraded in a programme planned to increase peak-hour capacity on the line by 27 per cent by the end of 2023. A single control room for the sub-surface railway opened at Hammersmith on 6 May 2018, and Communications Based Control (CBTC) provided by Thales will progressively replace &#x27;fixed block&#x27; signalling equipment dating back the 1940s.

The rollout of CBTC has been split into sections, each known as a Signal Migration Area (SMA), and are located on the line as follows:

<text>The Jubilee line is a London Underground line that runs between in suburban north-west London and in east London, via the Docklands, South Bank and West End. Opened in 1979, it is the newest line on the Underground network, although some sections of track date back to 1932 and some stations to 1879.

The western section of the line between and was previously a branch of the Metropolitan line until 1939 and later the Bakerloo line until 1979, while the newly-built line was completed in two major sections: initially in 1979 to , then in 1999 with an extension to Stratford. The later stations are larger and have special safety features, both aspects being attempts to future-proof the line. Following the extension to east London, serving areas once poorly connected to the Underground, the line has seen a huge growth in passenger numbers and is the fourth-busiest on the network (after the Northern, Victoria and Central lines), with over 276 million passenger journeys in 2019. 

Between and , the Jubilee line shares its route with the Metropolitan line and the Chiltern Main Line. Between and Stratford it runs parallel to the branch of the Docklands Light Railway. The Jubilee line is printed silver/grey on the Tube map, to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, after which the line was named.

== History ==

=== 1932 to 1939 ===
The first section of what is now the Jubilee line opened in 1932, when the Metropolitan Railway built a branch from its main line at Wembley Park to Stanmore. The line, as with many others in the northwest London area, was designed for the use of commuters from the new and rapidly expanding suburbs. The line presented the Metropolitan with a problem. The suburban traffic had been so successful that, by the early 1930s, the lines into Baker Street were becoming overloaded, a problem exacerbated by the post-war flight from the City of London to the West End of London.

At first, the Metropolitan had advocated a new deep tube line roughly following the line of the Edgware Road between the tube station and a point near Willesden Green. Indeed, construction advanced as far as the rebuilding of Edgware Road station to accommodate 4 platforms of 8-car length. Things changed, though, with the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) and the subsequent absorption of the Metropolitan line. The solution was now a new branch of the Bakerloo line from Baker Street to serve new stations at St John&#x27;s Wood and Swiss Cottage, thereby rendering the existing stations of Lord&#x27;s, Marlborough Road and Swiss Cottage on the parallel route redundant, and negating the need for the Met&#x27;s extension from Edgware Road station. It was originally proposed that the Metropolitan line&#x27;s Swiss Cottage station would remain open during peak hours for interchange with the Bakerloo, and that Lord&#x27;s station would open for special cricketing events, but both were closed permanently as economy measures during the Second World War. 

The new line rose between the Metropolitan line tracks at Finchley Road, providing cross-platform interchange with the Metropolitan line. Continuing north to Wembley Park, the new Bakerloo line branch was to provide local service on the Metropolitan line, while Metropolitan line trains ran non-stop between Finchley Road and Wembley Park, cutting seven minutes from journey times. At Wembley Park, the new Bakerloo would turn north to serve Kingsbury, Queensbury, Canons Park and Stanmore, taking over the former Metropolitan branch. The Bakerloo extension, built as above, opened in 1939.

=== 1939 to 1979, the Fleet line ===

The planning for the Tube network immediately before and after World War II considered several new routes. The main results of this study concerned two major routes: the south-to-northeast &quot;line C&quot;, and lines 3 and 4, new cross-town routes, linking the northwest suburbs to Fenchurch Street, Wapping and variously Lewisham and Hayes. Line C opened as the Victoria line, in stages, from 1968 to 1972. Work on the northwest–southeast route continued.

The &quot;Fleet line&quot; was mentioned in a 1965 &quot;Times&quot; article, discussing options after the Victoria line had been completed – suggesting that the Fleet line could take a route via Baker Street, Bond Street, Trafalgar Square, Strand, Fleet Street, Ludgate Circus and Cannon Street, then proceeding into southeast London. The new line was to have been called the Fleet line, partly because it ran along Fleet Street, which itself is named after the River Fleet (although it would only have crossed under the Fleet at Ludgate Circus; the central London section mostly follows the Tyburn).

In 1971, construction began on the new Fleet line. Economic pressure and doubt over the final destination of the line had led to a staged approach. Under the first stage, the Baker Street-to-Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo line was joined at Baker Street to a new segment into central London, with intermediate stops at Bond Street and Green Park and terminating at a new station at Charing Cross, thereby relieving pressure on the West End section of the Bakerloo line between Baker Street and Charing Cross and also allowing increased frequencies on the section north of Baker Street. The new tube was to offer cross-platform interchange between the Bakerloo and Fleet at Baker Street, as pioneered on the Victoria line. The work was completed in 1979. As part of the works, Trafalgar Square (Bakerloo) and Strand (Northern) stations were combined into a single station complex, Charing Cross. The existing Charing Cross station on the sub-surface District and Circle lines was renamed Embankment.

Another part of the works included a section of test tunnel, built near New Cross. This part of London has waterlogged soil that is difficult to tunnel in, so a new tunnelling method, called the bentonite shield, was used experimentally to construct a section of tunnel, that was on the line of the proposed Phase 2 route, in 1972. The experiment was successful, leading to the introduction of this form of construction elsewhere, but when the planned route was altered, this section was left abandoned.

In 1975, when plans were under way to introduce the London Transport Silver Jubilee Bus fleet, the then Sales Manager of London Transport Advertising, Geoffrey Holliman, proposed to the Chairman of LTE, Kenneth Robinson, that the Fleet line should be renamed the Jubilee line. However, this idea was initially rejected because of the additional costs involved. Nevertheless, the name was ultimately chosen for the line after Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s 1977 Silver Jubilee following a pledge made by the Conservatives in the Greater London Council election of 1977. The original choice of battleship grey for the line&#x27;s colour was based on the naval meaning of the word &quot;fleet&quot;; this became a lighter grey, representing the silver colour of the Jubilee itself.

The line was officially opened by the Prince of Wales on 30 April 1979, with passenger services operating from 1 May 1979.

=== Proposed extensions ===
The Jubilee line of 1979 was to be the first of four phases of the project, but lack of funds meant that no further progress was made until the late 1990s.

* Phase 2 would have extended the line along Fleet Street to stations at Aldwych, Ludgate Circus, Cannon Street and Fenchurch Street. Parliamentary approval for this phase was granted on 27 July 1971.
* Phase 3 would have seen the line continue under the river to Surrey Docks (now Surrey Quays) station on the Windrush line, taking over both of the ELL&#x27;s branches to and stations, with an extension to Lewisham. Parliamentary approval for this phase as far as New Cross was granted on 5 August 1971 and the final section to Lewisham was granted approval on 9 August 1972.
* In 1973, an alternative plan for Phase 3 was devised to provide transport connections to the London Docklands area then being considered for regeneration as it was expected that the docks would be closed by the late 1980s. Initially proposed as a mainline service but later developed as a tube line extension for the Jubilee line, the new plan was developed over the next few years to a final form that considered extending the line parallel to the River Thames known informally as the &#x27;River line&#x27;. This was to take the line from Fenchurch Street to Thamesmead via St Katharine Docks, Wapping, Surrey Docks North, Millwall (near the later location of South Quay DLR station), North Greenwich, Custom House, Silvertown, Woolwich Arsenal, and then to Thamesmead Central. The depot would have been at Beckton, roughly on the site of the current Docklands Light Railway depot, and a shuttle service between there and Custom House was considered. Parliamentary approval for the route as far as Woolwich Arsenal including the Beckton branch was granted on 1 August 1980.
* Phase 4 was the possible continuation of the original Phase 3 Lewisham branch to take over suburban services on the Addiscombe and Hayes branches.

=== Millennium extension ===
Changes in land use, particularly the urban renewal of the Docklands area, resulted in the project to extend the line beyond Charing Cross being changed considerably in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The Jubilee Line Extension, as the eventual project became known, opened in three stages in 1999. It split from the existing line at Green Park; the service to Charing Cross was discontinued (though still maintained for reversing trains at times of disruption, and for occasional use as a film set). The line extends as far as Stratford, with ten intermediate stations. 

The new stations were designed to be &quot;future-proof&quot;, with wide passageways, large quantities of escalators and lifts, and emergency exits. The stations were the first on the Underground to have platform edge doors, and were built to have step free access throughout. The project was the single largest addition to the Underground in 25 years.

There have been other proposals to extend the line to serve the docks.

=== 24-hour weekend service ===
In mid-2014, TfL announced plans for a new Night Tube service, to include the entire Jubilee line. This would be an overnight service on Friday and Saturday nights. Its introduction was postponed because of a dispute between TfL and the three rail unions. The service eventually started on 7 October 2016.

The entire Night Tube network was suspended in March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the Jubilee line service being restored in May 2022.

==Current Jubilee line==
Open since 1979, the Jubilee line is the newest line of the London Underground network. The trains were upgraded in 1997 to the 1996 stock. In 1999, trains began running to Stratford instead of Charing Cross, serving areas once poorly connected to the London Underground network.

=== Station features ===
Jubilee line stations north of Baker Street were not initially built specifically for the Jubilee line. St John&#x27;s Wood and Swiss Cottage stations were opened in 1939 on the then-new Bakerloo line branch to Stanmore and have more traditional tube station features. Stations north of Finchley Road were opened by the Metropolitan Railway (now the Metropolitan line), but they became part of the Bakerloo line in 1939, with only Wembley Park being shared with the Metropolitan. Then, in 1979, the Jubilee line took over the whole of the Bakerloo line service between Baker Street and Stanmore. The only stations with new platforms built for the original Jubilee line were the Baker Street westbound platform (eastbound opened in 1939), Bond Street, Green Park and the now-closed Charing Cross.

Stations on the Jubilee Line Extension feature:
*step-free access to street level
*contemporary architecture with overall design of the project led by Roland Paoletti, and stations designed by a different architect (e.g. Canary Wharf by Foster and Partners, North Greenwich by Alsop, Lyall and Störmer)
*substantially more escalators than previous stations (increasing the number of escalators on the Underground by half)
*modern fire safety standards including evacuation routes and ventilation shafts
*platform edge doors

The stations have subsequently been praised as exemplary pieces of 20th century architecture. The platform edge doors were introduced primarily to prevent draughts underground and to assist in air flow. They also prevent people from falling or jumping onto the track, as well as the build-up of litter.

=== Rolling stock ===

When the Jubilee line was opened, it was operated by 1972 stock. From 1984, this was gradually replaced by the new 1983 stock; the displaced 1972 stock was transferred to the Bakerloo line. The 1983 stock proved to be unreliable and troublesome in service, with single-leaf doors making passenger loading and unloading a slower process than on other stock with wider door openings. With the construction of the Jubilee line Extension, the opportunity was taken to introduce new trains, and today the line is worked by 1996 stock, which has an exterior similar to the 1995 stock in use on the Northern line. 

The new stock has internal displays and automated announcements to provide passengers with information on the train&#x27;s route. At first, the displayed text was static and showed only the destination of the train, but later showed also the name of the next station and interchanges there. Subsequent modifications introduced scrolling text. The 1996 stock uses a different motor from the 1995 stock and has a motor design similar to Class 365, Class 465, and Class 466 Networker trains.

=== Seventh car upgrade ===
The Jubilee line closed for three days from 25 December 2005 in order to add an extra car to each six-car train. The line had to be closed as six- and seven-car trains could not run in service at the same time, because the platform-edge doors at Jubilee Line Extension stations could not cater for both train lengths simultaneously. The signalling system was also modified to work with the longer trains.

Previously, an extra four complete seven-car trains had been added to the fleet, bringing the total to 63. This enabled the period during which a full service could be run to be increased. The full fleet was not required to be available until full advantage could be taken of the new signalling system.

The result of the seventh car upgrade was a 17% increase in capacity, allowing 6,000 more passengers per hour to use the line. Work was completed and the line reopened two days ahead of schedule, on 28 December 2005.

=== Signalling system ===
Since 2011, the Jubilee line has automatic train operation (ATO), using the SelTrac S40 moving block system. This provides capacity for 30 trains per hour.

Migration to the system was problematic. The programme of temporary closures for engineering work was criticised by local politicians as well as by the management of venues such as Wembley Stadium and The O2 because visitors to major concerts and sporting events had to travel by rail replacement bus. The management of the project by Tube Lines was criticised by London TravelWatch for its delayed delivery date, and a report by the London Assembly referred to the weekly line closures as &quot;chaotic&quot;.

=== 4G connectivity ===
In March 2020, a leaky feeder based system was brought online in the Jubilee line tunnels, between Westminster and Canning Town. The development of this system arose from the Home Office&#x27;s desire to provide coverage for its new Emergency Services Network on the London Underground. It allows passengers to receive 4G connectivity both in the tunnels and on station platforms.

When opened, it was the first section of London Underground tunnel to receive 4G and 5G connectivity. It was followed in December 2022 and into 2023 by a section of the Central line between Queensway and Holland Park and the Northern line between Archway and Mornington Crescent. TfL intends to deploy the technology across the entire Tube network by the mid-2020s.

== Future ==

=== Thamesmead branch ===
When North Greenwich Underground station was opened, it was built to enable a branch extension to be built eastwards to Thamesmead. There are currently no plans to construct this branch route.

=== West Hampstead interchange ===
Plans were put forward in 1974 and again in 2004 for a West Hampstead interchange, to connect the three West Hampstead stations in one complex. The plans were put on hold in 2007 due to uncertainty over the North London Line rail franchise. The proposal is now no longer possible, due to development in the area. Furthermore, both the Thameslink station and the Overground station have been rebuilt and upgraded in recent years, with step free access added to both.

== Services ==
Jubilee line services are:

*Peak services at 30 tph in the core section between Stratford and West Hampstead:
** 18 tph Stratford – Stanmore
** 4 tph Stratford – Wembley Park
** 4 tph Stratford – Willesden Green
** 4 tph Stratford – West Hampstead
** Some peak services originate or terminate at West Ham or Neasden
*Off-Peak services at 24 tph in the core section between Stratford and West Hampstead:
** 12 tph Stratford – Stanmore
** 4 tph Stratford – Wembley Park
** 4 tph Stratford – Willesden Green
** 4 tph Stratford – West Hampstead

== Stations ==


=== Former stations ===
The Jubilee line platforms at Charing Cross are still used during service suspensions. For example, when the service is suspended between Green Park and Stratford, trains will terminate (and passengers alight) at Green Park before going to Charing Cross and using a scissors crossover to reverse back westbound. The platforms are a popular set for films and television because the platforms are contemporary and the trains used are current ones that appear in normal passenger service.

== Depots ==
The main servicing and maintenance depot on the Jubilee line is Stratford Market Depot between the Stratford and West Ham stations. Trains are also stabled in Neasden Depot – sharing it with the Metropolitan line.

Stratford Market Depot was built as part of the Jubilee Line Extension in the late 1990s, as the Neasden Depot could not accommodate the increased number of trains required.

<text>The Northern line is a London Underground line that runs between North London and South London. It is printed in black on the Tube map. It carries more passengers per year than any other Underground linearound 340million in 2019making it the busiest tube line in London. The Northern line is unique on the Underground network in having two different routes through central London, two southern branches and two northern branches. Despite its name, it does not serve the northernmost stations on the Underground, though it does serve the southernmost station at , the terminus of one of the two southern branches. 

The line&#x27;s northern termini, all in the London Borough of Barnet, are at and ; is the terminus of a single-station branch line off the High Barnet branch. The two main northern branches run south to join at where two routes, one via in the West End and the other via in the City, continue and then join at in Southwark. At Kennington the line again divides into two branches, one to each of the southern termini – at , in the borough of Merton, and at in Wandsworth.

For most of its length the Northern line is a deep tube line. The portion between and opened in 1890 and is the oldest section of deep-level tube line on the network. Nearly 340 million passenger journeys were recorded in 2019 on the Northern line, making it the busiest on the Underground, although this is distorted due to having 2 branches within Central London, both of which are less busy than the core sections of other lines. It has 18 of the system&#x27;s 31 stations south of the River Thames. There are 52 stations in total on the line, of which 38 have platforms below ground.

The line&#x27;s structure of two northern branches (one with a further short branch), two central branches, and two southern branches reflects its complicated history. The core of the line, including the two central branches and the beginnings of the two northern branches, was constructed by two companies, the City and South London Railway and the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway, in the 1890s and 1900s. The companies came under the same ownership in 1913, and were physically connected and operationally merged in the 1920s, while at the same time extensions to Edgware and Morden were completed. In the 1930s and 1940s the Northern line took over and electrified the London and North Eastern Railway branches to Mill Hill East and High Barnet. This was the final extension of the line for eight decades, though between the 1930s and 1970s the Northern City Line was branded and operated as part of the Northern line despite being disconnected from the rest of the line. The most recent extension, a second southern branch from Kennington to Battersea, opened on 20 September 2021. There are proposals to split the line into two separate lines.
==History==
===Formation===
The core of the Northern line evolved from two railway companies: the City &amp; South London Railway (C&amp;SLR) and the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway (CCE&amp;HR).

The C&amp;SLR was London&#x27;s first electric hauled deep-level tube railway. It was built under the supervision of James Henry Greathead, who had been responsible (with Peter W. Barlow) for the Tower Subway. It was the first of the Underground&#x27;s lines to be constructed by boring deep below the surface and the first to be operated by electric traction. The railway opened in November 1890 from Stockwell to a now-disused station at King William Street. This was inconveniently placed and unable to cope with the company&#x27;s traffic so in 1900 a new route to Moorgate via Bank was opened. By 1907, the C&amp;SLR had been further extended at both ends to run from Clapham Common to Euston.

The CCE&amp;HR (commonly known as the &quot;Hampstead Tube&quot;) was opened in 1907 and ran from Charing Cross (known for many years as Strand) via Euston and a junction at Camden Town to Golders Green and Highgate (now known as Archway). It was extended south by one stop to Embankment in 1914 to form an interchange with the Bakerloo and District lines. In 1913, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), owner of the CCE&amp;HR, took over the C&amp;SLR although they remained separate companies.

===Integration===
During the early 1920s a series of works were carried out which involved connecting the C&amp;SLR and CCE&amp;HR tunnels to enable an integrated service to be operated. The first of these new tunnels, between the C&amp;SLR&#x27;s Euston station and the CCE&amp;HR&#x27;s station at Camden Town, had originally been planned in 1912 but was delayed by the First World War. Construction began in 1922 and this first tunnel opened in 1924. The second connection linking the CCE&amp;HR&#x27;s Embankment and C&amp;SLR&#x27;s Kennington stations opened in 1926. It provided a new intermediate station at Waterloo to connect to the main line station there and the Bakerloo line. The smaller diameter tunnels of the C&amp;SLR were also enlarged to match the standard diameter of the CCE&amp;HR and other deep tube lines.

===Extensions===
In conjunction with the works to integrate the two lines, two major extensions were undertaken: northwards to Edgware in Middlesex (now in the London Borough of Barnet) and southwards to Morden in Surrey (then in the Merton and Morden Urban District, but now in the London Borough of Merton).

====Edgware Extension====
The Edgware extension used plans dating back to 1901 for the Edgware and Hampstead Railway (E&amp;HR) which the UERL&#x27;s subsidiary, the London Electric Railway, had taken over in 1912. It extended the CCE&amp;HR line from its terminus at Golders Green to Edgware in two stages: to Hendon Central in 1923 and to Edgware in 1924. The line crossed open countryside and ran mostly on viaduct from Golders Green to Brent and then on the surface, apart from a short tunnel north of Hendon Central. Five new stations were built to pavilion-style designs by Stanley Heaps, head of the Underground&#x27;s Architects Office, stimulating the rapid northward expansion of suburban developments in the following years.

====Morden Extension====
The engineering of the Morden extension of the C&amp;SLR from Clapham Common to Morden was more demanding; it runs in tunnels to a point just north of Morden station which was constructed in a cutting. The line then goes under the wide station forecourt and public road outside the station to the depot. The extension was initially planned to continue to Sutton over part of the route for the unbuilt Wimbledon and Sutton Railway (in which the UERL held a stake) but agreements were made with Southern Railway to end the extension at Morden. Southern Railway built the surface line from Wimbledon to Sutton in the 1930s via South Merton and St. Helier. The tube extension itself opened in 1926 with seven new stations all designed by Charles Holden in a modern style. Originally Stanley Heaps was to design the stations, but after seeing the designs Frank Pick (Assistant Joint Manager of the UERL) decided that Holden should take over the project.

With the exception of Morden and Clapham South, where more land was available, the new stations were built on confined corner sites at main road junctions in areas that had been already developed. Holden made good use of this limited space and designed striking buildings. The street-level structures are of white Portland stone with tall double-height ticket halls, with the London Underground roundel made up in coloured glass panels in large glazed screens. The stone columns framing the glass screens are surmounted by a capital formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel. The large expanses of glass above the entrances ensure that the ticket halls are bright and lit from within at night, creating a welcoming feel. The first and last new stations on the extension, Clapham South and Morden, include a parade of shops and were designed with structures capable of being built above (like many of the earlier central London stations). Clapham South was extended upwards soon after its construction with a block of apartments; Morden was extended upwards in the 1960s with a block of offices. All the stations on the extension, except Morden itself, are Grade II listed buildings.

===Great Northern &amp; City Railway===
After the UERL and the Metropolitan Railway became part of the new unified London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, the MR&#x27;s subsidiary the Great Northern &amp; City Railway became part of the Underground as the Northern City Line. It ran underground from Moorgate to Finsbury Park. In preparation for the Northern Heights Plan it was operated as part of the Northern line, although it was never connected to the rest of the line.

===Naming===
The resulting line became known as the Morden–Edgware line, although a number of alternative names were also mooted in the fashion of the contraction of Baker Street &amp; Waterloo Railway to &quot;Bakerloo&quot;, such as &quot;Edgmor&quot;, &quot;Mordenware&quot;, &quot;Medgeway&quot; and &quot;Edgmorden&quot;. It was eventually named the &quot;Northern line&quot; from 28 August 1937, reflecting the planned addition of the Northern Heights lines.

=== Northern Heights plan===

In June 1935 the LPTB announced the New Works Programme, an ambitious plan to expand the Underground network which included the integration of a complex of existing London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) lines north of Highgate through the Northern Heights. These lines, built in the 1860s and 1870s by the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway (EH&amp;LR) and its successors, ran from Finsbury Park to Edgware via Highgate, with branches to Alexandra Palace and High Barnet. The line taken over would be extended beyond Edgware to Brockley Hill, Elstree South and Bushey Heath with a new depot at Aldenham. The extension&#x27;s route was that planned for the unbuilt Watford and Edgware Railway (W&amp;ER), using rights obtained from the earlier purchase of the W&amp;ER (which had long intended an extension of the EH&amp;LR Edgware route towards Watford). This also provided the potential for further extension in the future; Bushey&#x27;s town planners reserved space in Bushey village for a future station and Bushey Heath station&#x27;s design was revised several times to ensure this option would remain available in the future.

The project involved electrification of the surface lines (operated by steam trains at the time), the doubling of the original single-line section between Finchley Central and the proposed junction with the Edgware branch of the Northern line, and the construction of three new linking sections of track: a connection between Northern City Line and Finsbury Park station on the surface; an extension from Archway to the LNER line near East Finchley via new deep-level platforms below Highgate station; and a short diversion from just before the LNER&#x27;s Edgware station to the Underground&#x27;s station of the same name.

====Intended service levels====
The peak-hour service pattern was to be 21 trains an hour each way on the High Barnet branch north of Camden Town, 14 of them via the Charing Cross branch and seven via the Bank branch. 14 would have continued on beyond Finchley Central, seven each on the High Barnet and Edgware branches. An additional seven trains an hour would have served the High Barnet branch but continued via Highgate High-Level and Finsbury Park to Moorgate, a slightly shorter route to the city. It does not seem to have been intended to run through trains to the ex-Northern City branch from Edgware via Finchley Central. Seven trains an hour would have served the Alexandra Palace branch, to/from Moorgate via Highgate High-Level. In addition to the 14 through trains described the ex-Northern City branch would have had 14 four-car shuttle trains an hour.

====Progress of works====
Work began in the late 1930s and was in progress on all fronts by the outbreak of the Second World War. The tunnelling northwards from the original Highgate station (now Archway) had been completed, and the service to the rebuilt surface station at East Finchley started on 3 July 1939 but without the opening of the intermediate (new) Highgate Station at the site of the LNER&#x27;s station of the same name. Further progress was disrupted by the start of the war; however enough development had been made to complete the electrification of the High Barnet branch onwards from East Finchley (over which tube services started on 14 April 1940) and the new deep-level Highgate station opened on 19 January 1941. The single track LNER line to Edgware was electrified as far as Mill Hill East, including the Dollis Brook Viaduct, opening as a tube service on 18 May 1941 to serve the barracks there thus forming the Northern line as it is today. The new depot at Aldenham had already been built and was used to build Halifax bombers. Work on the other elements of the plan was suspended late in 1939.

Work on the extension from Edgware to Bushey Heath including work on a viaduct and a tunnel started in June 1939, but was stopped after war broke out. After the war, the area beyond Edgware was made part of the Metropolitan Green Belt, largely preventing the anticipated residential development in the area, and the potential demand for services from Bushey Heath thus vanished. Passenger numbers also dropped on the then-BR&#x27;s Mill Hill and Alexandra Palace branches, so it was useless to electrify them. Available funds were directed towards completing the eastern extension of the Central line instead, and the Northern Heights plan was dropped on 9 February 1954. Aldenham depot was converted into an overhaul facility for buses.

The implemented service from High Barnet branch gave good access both to the West End and the City. This appears to have undermined traffic on the Alexandra Palace branch, still run with steam haulage to Kings Cross via Finsbury Park, as Highgate (low-level) was but a short bus ride away and car traffic was much lighter than it would become later. Consequently, the line from Finsbury Park to Muswell Hill and Alexandra Palace via the surface platforms at Highgate was closed altogether to passenger traffic in 1954. This contrasts with the decision to electrify the Epping-Ongar branch of the Central line, another remnant of the New Works programme, run as a tube-train shuttle from 1957. A local pressure group, the Muswell Hill Metro Group, campaigns to reopen this route as a light-rail service. So far there is no sign of movement on this issue: the route, now the Parkland Walk, is highly valued by walkers and cyclists, and suggestions in the 1990s that it could, in part, become a road were met with fierce opposition. Another pressure group has proposed using the track bed further north, as part of the North and West London Light Railway. The connection between Drayton Park and the surface platforms at Finsbury Park was opened in 1976, when the Northern City Line became part of British Rail.

=== 1990s refurbishment and upgrade ===

In the 1980s, a southern extension of the line to Peckham was proposed, as part of a review of potential extensions of Underground lines. The proposal was not proceeded with.

By the early 1990s, the line had deteriorated due to years of under-investment and the use of old rolling stock, most of which dated back to the early 1960s. The line gained the nickname &quot;Misery Line&quot; due to its perceived unreliability. In 1995, a comprehensive refurbishment of the line began – including track replacement, power upgrades, station modernisation (such as Mornington Crescent) and the replacement of older rolling stock with new 1995 Stock thanks to a public–private partnership deal with Alstom.

== Recent developments ==
Throughout the 2000s, no plans were considered for extending the Northern line, as the PPP to upgrade the Underground did not include provision for line extensions within the PPP contracts. The Northern line was originally scheduled to switch to automatic train operation in 2012, using the same SelTrac S40 system as used since 2009 on the Jubilee line and for a number of years on the Docklands Light Railway. Originally the work was to follow on from the Jubilee line so as to benefit from the experience of installing it there, but that project was not completed until spring 2011. Work on the Northern line was contracted to be completed before the 2012 Olympics. It was then undertaken in-house, and TfL predicted the upgrade would be complete by the end of 2014. The first section of the line (West Finchley to High Barnet) was transferred to the new signalling system on 26 February 2013 and the line became fully automated on 1 June 2014, with the Chalk Farm to Edgware via Golders Green section being the last part of the line to switch to ATO.

In January 2018, Transport for London announced that it would double the period during which it runs peak evening services in the central London section to tackle overcrowding. There would now be 24 trains per hour on both central London branches and the northern branches, as well as 30 trains per hour on the Kennington to Morden section between 5pm and 7pm.

===24-hour weekend service===
Since the mid-autumn of 2016, a 24-hour &quot;Night Tube&quot; service has run on Friday and Saturday nights from Edgware and High Barnet to Morden via the Charing Cross branch; service is suspended on the Bank branch during these times. Trains run every eight minutes between Morden and Camden Town and every 15/16 minutes between Camden Town and Edgware/High Barnet. Labour disputes delayed the planned start date of September 2015.

===Battersea extension===

In September 2021, the Northern line was extended to serve the redevelopment of Battersea Power Station. Partially funded by private developers, the £1.2bn project extended the Charing Cross branch of the line for from Kennington to Battersea Power Station, with an intermediate stop at Nine Elms. Approved by Wandsworth Council in 2010 and TfL in 2014, the construction of the line began in 2015. Tunnelling for the project was completed in 2017, and the extension opened on 20 September 2021. Provision has been made for a future extension to Clapham Junction railway station.

==Infrastructure==

===Rolling stock===

When the line opened, it was served by 1906 Stock. This was replaced by Standard stock which was in turn replaced by 1938 stock as part of the New Works Programme, later supplemented with identical 1949 Stock. When the Piccadilly line was extended to Heathrow Airport in the 1970s, its 1959 Stock and 1956 Stock (prototypes of the 1959 Stock) trains were transferred to the Northern line. As there were not enough 1956 and 1959 Stock trains to replace the Northern line&#x27;s 1938 Stock fleet, they were supplemented with newly built 1972 Mark 1 Stock trains, which all served the line at the same time. 1972 Mark 2 stock trains also ran on this line until going to the Jubilee line; they were then moved to the Bakerloo line, where they remain in service. The few 1956 Stock trains were briefly replaced by 1962 Stock transferred from the Central line in 1995, before the entire Northern line fleet was replaced with 1995 Stock between 1998 and 2000.

Today, all Northern line trains consist of 1995 Stock in the Underground livery of red, white and blue. In common with the other deep-level lines, the trains are the smaller of the two loading gauges used on the system. 1995 stock has automated announcements and quick-close doors. If the proposed split of the line takes place (initial estimates of 2018 having been abandoned to focus on completion of the Battersea and Nine Elms extension work), 19 new trains will be added to the existing fleet of 106 trains, though additional trains beyond the extra 19 trains may be required to provide a full service for the new Battersea extension.

===Tunnels===
Although two other London Underground lines operate fully underground, the Northern line is unusual in that it is a deep-level tube line that serves the outer suburbs of South London yet there is only one station above ground (Morden tube station) while the rest of this part of the line is deep below ground. The short section to Morden depot is also above ground. This is partly because its southern extension into the outer suburbs was not done by taking over an existing surface line as was generally the case with routes such as the Central, Jubilee and Piccadilly lines. Apart from the core central underground tunnels, part of the section between Hendon and Colindale is also underground. As bicycles are not allowed in tunnel sections (even if no station is in that section) as they would hinder evacuation, they are limited to High Barnet – East Finchley, the Mill Hill East branch, Edgware – Colindale and Hendon Central – Golders Green. There are also time-based restrictions for the sections where bicycles are allowed.

The tunnel from Morden to East Finchley via Bank, 17 miles 528 yards (27.841 km), was for a time the longest rail tunnel in the world. Other tunnels, including the Channel Tunnel that links the UK and France, are now longer.

===Depots===
The Northern line is serviced by four depots. The main one is at Golders Green, adjacent to Golders Green tube station, while the second, at Morden, is south of Morden tube station and is the larger of the two. The other two are at Edgware and Highgate. The Highgate depot is on the former LNER branch to Alexandra Palace. There was originally a depot at Stockwell, but this closed in 1915. There are sidings at High Barnet for stabling trains overnight.

==Future==

===Northern line split===
Since the 2000s, TfL has aspired to split the Northern line into two separate routes. Running trains between all combinations of branches and the two central sections, as at present, means only 24 trains an hour can run through each of the central sections at peak times, because merging trains have to wait for each other at the junctions at Camden Town and Kennington. Completely segregating the routes could allow 36 trains an hour on all parts of the line, increasing capacity by around 25%.

TfL has already separated the Charing Cross and Bank branches during off-peak periods; however, four trains per hour still run to and from Morden via Charing Cross in the peak; the northern branches to Edgware and High Barnet cannot be separated until Camden Town station is upgraded to cope with the numbers of passengers changing trains. The extension to Battersea would allow the Charing Cross branch to terminate at Battersea Power Station.

=== Camden Town station upgrade and expansion ===
The proposed split of the Northern line would require Camden Town station to be expanded and upgraded, as the station is already severely overcrowded at weekend peak times, and a split would increase the number of passengers wishing to change trains at the station. In 2005, London Underground failed to secure planning permission for a comprehensive upgrade plan for Camden Town tube station that would have involved demolition of the existing station entrance and several other surface-level buildings, all within a conservation area. New redevelopment plans were first announced in 2013 by TfL, which proposed avoiding the existing station entrance and the conservation area by building a second entrance and interchange tunnels to the north, mostly on the site of a subsequently vacated infant school. In 2018, plans to upgrade and rebuild Camden Town station were placed indefinitely on hold, due to TfL&#x27;s financial situation. , there is currently no plan to split the line.

==Incidents and accidents==
In October 2003, a train derailed at Camden Town. Although no one was hurt, points, signals and carriages were damaged. Concern was raised about the safety of the Tube, given the derailment at Chancery Lane earlier in 2003. A joint report by the Underground and its maintenance contractor Tube Lines concluded that poor track geometry was the main cause, and therefore extra friction arising out of striations (scratches) on a newly installed set of points had allowed the leading wheel of the last carriage to climb the rail and derail. The track geometry at the derailment site is a very tight bend and tight tunnel bore, which precludes the normal solution for this sort of geometry of canting the track by raising the height of one rail relative to the other.

In August 2010, a defective rail grinding train caused disruption on the Charing Cross branch, after it travelled four miles in 13 minutes without a driver. The train was being towed to the depot after becoming faulty. At Archway station, the defective train became detached and ran driverless until coming to a stop at an incline near Warren Street station. This caused morning rush-hour services to be suspended on this branch. All passenger trains were diverted via the Bank branch, with several not stopping at stations until they were safely on the Bank branch.

==In popular culture==
* In his debut novel &quot;Ghostwritten&quot;, David Mitchell characterises the Northern line as &quot;the psycho of the family&quot;.
* The Bloc Party song &quot;Waiting For the 7.18&quot; references the Northern line as &quot;the loudest&quot;.
* As part of a series of twelve books tied to the twelve lines of the London Underground, A &quot;Northern Line Minute&quot; focuses on the Northern line.
* The Nick Drake song &quot;Parasite&quot; references the Northern Line.
* The 1982 Robyn Hitchcock song &quot;Fifty Two Stations&quot; begins, &quot;There&#x27;s fifty-two stations on the Northern Line/None of them is yours, one of them is mine.&quot;
* The 2021 Maisie Peters song &quot;Elvis Song&quot; begins, &quot;Cold bench on a platform/Last train on the Northern Line.&quot;

<text>The Victoria line is a London Underground line that runs between in south London and in the north-east, via the West End. It is printed in light blue on the Tube map and is one of the only two lines on the network to run completely underground, the other being the Waterloo &amp; City line.

The line was constructed in the 1960s and was the first entirely new Underground line in London for 50 years. It was designed to reduce congestion on other lines, particularly the Piccadilly line and the branch of the Northern line. The first section, from Walthamstow Central to , opened in September 1968 and an extension to followed in December. The line was completed to Victoria station in March 1969 and was opened by Queen Elizabeth II who rode a train from Green Park to Victoria. The southern extension to Brixton opened in 1971, and Pimlico station (the only station in the line without an interchange) was added in 1972.

The Victoria line is operated using automatic train operation, but all trains have drivers. The 2009 Tube Stock replaced the original 1967 Tube Stock trains. The line serves 16 stations and all but Pimlico provide interchanges with other Transport for London or National Rail services. The line, the most intensively used on the Underground, was used by 302 million passengers in 2019, making it the second-busiest tube line. With trains arriving every 100seconds at peak times, it is one of the most frequent rapid transit lines in the world.

==History==

===Planning===
The first proposal for a railway in this area appeared in the County of London Plan, published in 1943. In 1948, a working party set up by the British Transport Commission (BTC) proposed a tube railway from Victoria to Walthamstow, largely based on a 1946 plan for a Croydon-to-Finsbury Park line. Its main purpose was to relieve congestion in the central area, which had been a problem since the 1930s. Other benefits were linking the key railway stations at , , and and improving connections between north-east London and the city.

In early 1949, the BTC committee looked at the feasibility of building a deep-level tube to fulfil these requirements. For the first time, cost–benefit analysis was used to ensure the line would be built within budget and be profitable. A private bill was introduced in Parliament in 1955, describing a line from Victoria to Walthamstow (), next to the British Rail station. Another proposal, not in the bill, supported an extension from Victoria to Fulham Broadway on the District line terminating at Edmonton instead of Walthamstow. Proposals were made to extend the line north to South Woodford or Woodford to provide interchange with the Central line. In 1961, it was decided that the line would terminate at Walthamstow (Hoe Street) station rather than Wood Street – this would cut costs by £1.4million, and &quot;satisfactory interchange&quot; with British Railways was available at Hoe Street station. Walthamstow (Hoe Street) was later renamed on 6 May 1968 in anticipation of the line&#x27;s opening). The line was planned to have cross-platform interchanges at Oxford Circus, Euston and (with the Bakerloo, Northern (Bank) and Piccadilly lines respectively) and at Walthamstow Central to provide a quick and easy connection between the new line and existing services.

The name &quot;Victoria line&quot; dates from 1955; other suggestions were &quot;Walvic line&quot; (Walthamstow–Victoria), &quot;Viking line&quot; (Victoria–King&#x27;s Cross), &quot;Mayfair line&quot; and &quot;West End line&quot;. During the planning stages, it was known as &quot;Route C&quot; and named the Victoria line (after the station) by David McKenna, Chairman of British Transport Advertising, whose suggestion was seconded by Sir John Elliot. The board decided that the Victoria line sounded &quot;just right&quot;.

===Walthamstow–Victoria===
Initial construction began in January 1960, when two test tunnels were started from Tottenham to Manor House under Seven Sisters Road. The tunnels were excavated using an experimental &quot;drum digger&quot; rotary shield, powered by hydraulic rams, that could cut more than per day. The work was completed in July 1961, with the expectation it would be used for the completed Victoria line.

After the line gained parliamentary approval on 20 August 1962 with a budget of £56million, construction began the following month. The economic boom of the mid-to-late 1950s had faded leading to a rise in unemployment in London, and the government had hoped that building the Victoria line would alleviate this. Work began adapting Oxford Circus station to link to the new line; a cross-platform interchange was provided with the Bakerloo line and a subway link with the Central line. A steel umbrella was erected over the junction in August 1963 so that a new ticket hall could be built without disrupting existing traffic. Rolling stock on the line was fitted with Automatic Train Operation (ATO), which allowed self-driving of the train based on automatic electrical signals along the track. In March 1964, a £2.25million contract was awarded to Metro-Cammell for the Victoria line fleet.

That October, the Northern City Line closed between and so that the latter station could be redesigned for a cross-platform interchange between the Victoria and Piccadilly lines. All major contracts had been awarded by 1965, and construction was on track to be completed in 1968. New stations were constructed at Walthamstow Central, , and . The station at Blackhorse Road was built on the opposite side of the road from the mainline station (serving the Kentish Town to Barking line) and was not an interchange.

The line opened from Walthamstow Central to on 1 September 1968. There was no opening ceremony; instead the normal timetable started. The first train left Walthamstow Central for Highbury &amp; Islington at 7:32 a.m. The line proved to meet a need; more than 1,000 tickets were purchased at Highbury &amp; Islington within its first hour of opening.

The next section to Warren Street, opened on 1 December 1968, again without ceremony. The line was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 7 March 1969 when it had been completed to Victoria. At 11:00 a.m., the Queen made the first trip, on a 5d (2.08p) ticket, from Green Park to Victoria, where she unveiled a plaque. In so doing, she was the first reigning monarch to ride on the Underground. The line was open to the general public by 3:00 p.m. Trains from Walthamstow to Victoria took around 24minutes.

===Victoria–Brixton===

The extension from Victoria to Brixton with stations at and Stockwell was approved in March 1966. Preparatory work had started at Bessborough Gardens near Vauxhall Bridge Road in May 1967. The contract was awarded on 4 August 1967. A proposal to build Pimlico tube station received Government approval on 28 June 1968. In July, the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales visited tunnel workings under Vauxhall Park.

The Brixton extension was bored using the older Greathead shield. Although slower, use of the tunnelling shield allowed easier digging through the gravel strata south of the Thames. It was opened on 23 July 1971 by Princess Alexandra, who made a journey from Brixton to . On opening, it was the first new section of Underground to open south of the Thames since the extension of the City and South London Railway from Clapham Common to Morden in 1926. The final piece of the Victoria line, Pimlico station, opened on 14 September 1972.

London Transport considered extensions to Streatham, Dulwich and Crystal Palace to provide a connection to southeast London and Kent but no construction work was undertaken.

===Post-opening===
The Kentish Town to Barking line did not close as expected and both stations at Blackhorse Road remained open. The mainline station was moved to the same side of the road as the tube station and was connected to the Victoria line on 14 December 1981 via an overbridge. The original station was then closed and demolished.

The London Underground (Victoria) Act 1991 allowed for the construction of a underground pedestrian link at Victoria station between the Victoria line platforms and the sub-surface Circle line platforms above. The London Underground (Victoria Station Upgrade) Order 2009 came into force in September that year, authorising the construction of a second ticket hall at Victoria.

Warren Street tube station was attacked in the 2005 London bombings. There were no fatalities in this attack. After the 2005 London bombings, there was heightened security. The London Police wrongly detained and fatally shot 27-year-old Jean Charles de Menezes once he boarded a train at one of the stations on the Victoria line. After his death, a memorial to Menezes was placed close to Stockwell station.

On 23 January 2014, during upgrade work at Victoria, construction workers accidentally penetrated the signalling room of the Victoria line and flooded it with quick-drying concrete, leading to the suspension of services south of Warren Street. Services resumed the following day after sugar was used to slow the setting of the concrete and make it easier to shovel out.

A 24-hour Night Tube service on Friday and Saturday nights, due to start in September 2015 on the entire line, was delayed because of strike action. The service began in August 2016, with trains running at 10-minute intervals on the whole line.

==Design==
Every Victoria line station, apart from Pimlico and Blackhorse Road, was built as an interchange and several stations were rearranged to allow for cross-platform interchange with the line. In some stations, the Victoria line platforms were built on either side of the existing arrangement; in others, the Victoria line uses the older platforms and the existing line was diverted onto a new alignment. All platforms on the line are long. The line has hump-backed stations to allow trains to store gravitational potential energy as they slow down and release it when they leave a station, providing an energy saving of 5% and allowing trains to run 9% faster.

The stations were originally tiled in blue and grey, each decorated with tiled motifs in seating recesses for identification. Some motifs were puns; the image for Brixton, for instance, was a ton of bricks. During construction of the first stage of the Jubilee line in 1979, the motifs on Green Park station were replaced by others matching the design for the Jubilee line platforms.

In late 2010 and 2011, platform humps were installed on all Victoria line stations except Pimlico to provide step-free access to trains. The project was in accordance with the Rail Vehicle Accessibility (Non Interoperable Rail System) Regulations 2010 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The Victoria line humps resemble the Harrington Hump, a type of ramp being installed on some mainline stations, but are of a masonry construction.

==Service and rolling stock==

About 200million passengers a year use the Victoria line. It is the sixth-most heavily used line on the network in absolute figures, but in terms of the average number of journeys per mile it is by far the most intensively used. From May 2017, trains run every 100seconds during peak periods, providing 36 trains per hour. All trains run from Brixton to Seven Sisters and some continue to Walthamstow Central.
During off-peak periods, the Victoria line runs 27 trains per hour between Brixton and Walthamstow Central.

When the line opened, services were operated by a fleet of eight-car trains of 1967 Tube Stock trains. In the early planning stages, an articulated type of rolling stock was considered, but not progressed because of difficulties transferring the stock to Acton Works for heavy overhauls. After Acton Works closed, this no longer applies. The 2009 tube stock has a wider profile and slightly longer carriages which precludes it from running on other deep-level tube lines. The 1967 stock was supplemented by 1972 Mark I Tube Stock, transferred from the Northern line and converted to be compatible with the 1967 stock.

Replacement of the 1967 rolling stock began in July 2009. The 2009 Tube Stock fleet of 47 eight-car trains was built by Bombardier Transportation. Testing the first prototypes began in 2008. The trains began to be introduced in 2009 and most were in operation by the following year. The last of the 1967 stock trains ran on 30 June 2011, after which the entire service was provided by 2009 stock.

On opening, the line was equipped with a fixed-block Automatic Train Operation system (ATO). The train operator closed the train doors and pressed a pair of &quot;start&quot; buttons and, if the way ahead was clear, the ATO drives the train at a safe speed to the next station. At any point, the driver could switch to manual control if the ATO failed. The system, which operated until 2012, made the Victoria line the world&#x27;s first full-scale automatic railway.

The Victoria line runs faster trains than other Underground lines because it has fewer stops, ATO running and modern design. Train speeds can reach up to . A common method used by north London residents to visit the West End is to take the Northern line Bank branch, change platforms at Euston, and continue on faster Victoria line trains. In the 2010s, the original signalling was replaced with a more modern ATO system from Westinghouse Rail Systems incorporating &#x27;Distance to Go Radio&#x27; and more than 400 track circuits. London Underground claimed it was the world&#x27;s first ATO-on-ATO upgrade. The new signalling system allowed a revised timetable to be introduced in February 2013, allowing up to 33 trains per hour instead of 27. In combination with new, faster trains, the line&#x27;s capacity increased by 21%, equivalent to an extra 10,000 passengers per hour. By 2019, the line was running around 36 trains per hour at peak times, with a train arriving every 100seconds – making it one of the most frequent rapid transit lines in the world.

==Facilities==
=== Step-free access ===

When the line was built, budgetary restrictions meant that station infrastructure standards were lower than on older lines and on later extension projects. Examples include narrower than usual platforms and undecorated ceilings at Walthamstow Central, Blackhorse Road and Tottenham Hale, affecting lighting levels. The line was built with fewer escalators than other lines as a cost-saving measure. The lack of a third escalator linking station entrances to platforms at some stations can cause severe congestion at peak times. Stations have closed temporarily for safety reasons when escalators have been unserviceable.

Step-free routes are available between the Victoria line and other lines at most interchanges. Tottenham Hale, Finsbury Park, King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras, Green Park, Victoria, Vauxhall and Brixton have step-free access from street to train. Platform humps have been installed at all stations (except Pimlico) to provide level access to trains, improving access for customers with mobility impairments, luggage or pushchairs.

===Ventilation===

About 50 ventilation shafts were constructed during the construction phase. Midpoint tunnel ventilation shafts remain between stations. Special &quot;local arrangements&quot; are in place should it be necessary to evacuate passengers from trains via Netherton Road emergency escape shaft. Planning permission for a shaft at Ferry Lane, next to Tottenham Hale station, was granted on 11 January 1968, during the first phase of construction.

By mid-2009, trial boreholes for a cooling system at Green Park station had been drilled and more were scheduled to be created by the end of 2009. In 2010, &quot;Engineering &amp; Technology&quot; reported that of water per second for the cooling system was being pumped through heat-exchangers at Victoria station from the River Tyburn and into the River Thames.

Between 2009 and 2014, thirteen ventilation shafts were refurbished. In the first phase were Drayton Park, Gillingham Street, Moreton Terrace, Pulross Road, Somerleyton Road and Tynemouth Road. For the second phase were Cobourg Street, Dover Street, Gibson Square, Great Titchfield Street, Isledon Road, Kings Cross, Palace Street and Rita Road.

By 2009, changes at Cobourg Street were in the planning stage and demolition at Moreton Terrace, Somerleyton Road and Drayton Park shafts had taken place. Planning permission for Netherton Road shaft was granted on 8 September 1967. On 31 March, the demolition and rebuilding of Netherton Road shaft was allowed as permitted development.

==Depot==

The depot at Northumberland Park, the service and storage area for trains, is the only part of the Victoria line above ground. Trains access the depot via a branch line in a tunnel to the north of Seven Sisters.

The depot opened with the first stage of the line in September 1968. It is next to Northumberland Park railway station, on Tottenham Marshes in the London Borough of Haringey, over a mile from the Victoria line. When built, it was long and had working space for 22 eight-car trains. As part of Transport for London&#x27;s tube upgrade scheme, the depot has been expanded and upgraded to accommodate all the 2009 Tube Stock trains.

==Future==
Tottenham Hotspur F.C. and its supporters have campaigned for a surface station next to Northumberland Park Station, adjacent to the depot to improve the stadium&#x27;s transport links. The plans would require co-operation with the local council and Network Rail to minimise disruption. It was announced by Haringey Council in its 2012 &quot;A Plan for Tottenham&quot; report that there was &quot;potential for a Victoria Line extension to Northumberland Park&quot;.

Crossrail 2, also known as the Chelsea-Hackney line, is a proposed line across central London between Victoria and King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras tube station to increase capacity in Central London by 270,000 passengers per day. It is intended to relieve congestion on the Victoria line, a key line connecting several important London termini.

Proposals have been made to extend the line one stop southwards from Brixton to Herne Hill, a significant interchange in south London providing access to Kent, , and . Herne Hill would be on a large reversing loop with a single platform removing a critical capacity restriction eliminating the need for trains to reverse at Brixton and provide a more obvious route for passengers who look for the nearest tube station before any other transport options.

<text>The Piccadilly line is a deep-level London Underground line running between the west and the north of London. It has two western branches which split at Acton Town and serves 53 stations. The line serves Heathrow Airport, and some of its stations are near tourist attractions in Central London such as Piccadilly Circus and Buckingham Palace. The District and Metropolitan lines share some sections of track with the Piccadilly line. Printed in dark blue (officially &quot;Corporate Blue&quot;, Pantone 072) on the Tube map, it is the sixth-busiest line on the Underground network, with nearly 218 million passenger journeys in 2019.

The first section, between Finsbury Park and Hammersmith, was opened in 1906 as the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR). The station tunnels and buildings were designed by Leslie Green, featuring ox-blood terracotta facades with semi-circular windows on the first floor. When Underground Electric Railways of London (UERL) took over the line, it was renamed the Piccadilly line. Subsequent extensions were made to Cockfosters, Hounslow West and Uxbridge in the early 1930s, when many existing stations on the Uxbridge and Hounslow branches were rebuilt to designs by Charles Holden of the Adams, Holden &amp; Pearson architectural practice. These were generally rectangular, with brick bases and large tiled windows, topped with a concrete slab roof. The western extensions took over certain existing District line services, which were fully withdrawn in 1964.

Stations in central London were rebuilt to cater for a higher volume of passenger traffic. To prepare for the Second World War, some stations were equipped with shelters and basic amenities, and others with blast walls. Construction of the Victoria line, the first section of which opened in 1968, helped to relieve congestion on the Piccadilly line; some sections of the Piccadilly had to be rerouted for cross-platform interchange with the new line. Several plans were made to extend the Piccadilly line to serve Heathrow Airport. The earliest approval was given in 1967, and the Heathrow extension opened in stages between 1975 and 1977. This served only Terminals 2 and 3 and the former Terminal 1. The line was extended again twice, to Terminal 4 via a loop in 1986, and to Terminal 5 directly from the main terminal station in 2008.

This line has two depots, at Northfields and Cockfosters, with a group of sidings at several locations. There are crossovers at a number of locations, some of which allow trains to switch to different lines. The Piccadilly line&#x27;s electric power was formerly generated at Lots Road Power Station. This was taken out of use in 2003, and the line is now powered from the National Grid network. 1973 Stock trains are used on the line, 78 of which are needed to operate a 24 trains per hour (tph) service (a train every minutes) during peak hours. These trains are due to be replaced by 2024 Stock in 2025.

==Route==
The Piccadilly line is a long north–west line, with two western branches splitting at Acton Town, serving 53 stations. At the northern end, Cockfosters is a four-platform three-track terminus, and the line runs at surface level to just south of Oakwood. Southgate station is in a tunnel, with tunnel portals to the north and south. Due to the difference in terrain, a viaduct carries the tracks through Arnos Park to Arnos Grove. The line then descends into twin tube tunnels, passing through Wood Green, Finsbury Park and central London. The central area contains stations close to tourist attractions, such as the London Transport Museum, Harrods, Buckingham Palace and Piccadilly Circus. The tunnel ends east of Barons Court, where the line continues west, parallel to the District line, to Acton Town. A flying junction, in use since 10 February 1910, separates trains going to the Heathrow branch from the Uxbridge branch.

The Heathrow branch remains at surface level until the eastern approach to Hounslow West station, where it enters a cut-and-cover tunnel. West of Hatton Cross, the line enters tube tunnels to Heathrow Airport and branches to the Terminal 4 loop or to a terminus at Terminal 5. On the Uxbridge branch, the line shares tracks with the District line between Acton Town and south of North Ealing. Traversing terrain with cuttings and embankments, it continues to Uxbridge, sharing tracks with the Metropolitan line between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge. The distance between Cockfosters and Uxbridge is .

==History==

The Piccadilly line began as the Great Northern, Piccadilly &amp; Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR), one of several railways controlled by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), whose chief director was Charles Tyson Yerkes, although he died before the first section of the line opened. It currently runs on tracks built by The GNP&amp;BR, the District Railway (DR) and the Metropolitan Railway (Met), and received major extensions in the 1930s and 1970s.

The GNP&amp;BR was formed from the merger of two earlier, but unbuilt, tube-railway companies taken over in 1901 by Yerkes&#x27;s consortium: the Great Northern &amp; Strand Railway (GN&amp;SR) and the Brompton &amp; Piccadilly Circus Railway (B&amp;PCR). The GN&amp;SR&#x27;s and B&amp;PCR&#x27;s separate routes were linked with an additional section between and . A section of the DR&#x27;s scheme for a deep-level tube line between and was also added in order to complete the route. This finalised route, between Finsbury Park and Hammersmith stations, was formally opened on 15 December 1906. On 30 November 1907, the short branch from Holborn to the Strand (later renamed ) opened; it had been planned as the last section of the GN&amp;SR before the amalgamation with the B&amp;PCR.

Initial ridership growth was low due to high use of new electric trams and motor buses. Financial stability was an issue, and as a result the company heavily promoted their railways via a new management team. UERL also agreed with other independent railway companies such as the Central London Railway (CLR, now part of the Central line) to jointly advertise a combined network known as the Underground. On 1 July 1910, the GNP&amp;BR and the other UERL-owned tube railways (the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway and the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway) were merged by an act of Parliament to become the &quot;London Electric Railway Company&quot; (LER). The Underground railways still suffered financial issues, and to address this, the London Passenger Transport Board was established on 1 July 1933.

There were significant station layout changes in the 1910s and 1920s. On 4 October 1911, Earl&#x27;s Court had new escalators installed connecting the District and Piccadilly lines. They were the first to be installed on the Underground. On 10 December 1928, a rebuilt Piccadilly Circus station, designed by Charles Holden, was opened. This included a new booking hall located below ground and eleven escalators, replacing the original lifts.

One of the shafts at Holloway Road station was used as an experiment for spiral escalators, but never used. An experiment to encourage passengers to step on the escalator three at a time at Manor House station was trialled. It failed due to opposition and potential dangers pointed out by the public.

===Extension to Cockfosters===
While early plans to serve Wood Green (specifically Alexandra Palace) existed since the 1890s as part of the GN&amp;SR, this section to Finsbury Park was later dropped from the GNP&amp;BR proposal in 1902 when the GN&amp;SR was merged with the B&amp;PCR. In 1902, as part of an agreement for taking over the GN&amp;SR, the Great Northern Railway (GNR) imposed a sanction on Yerkes to abandon the section north of Finsbury Park and they would construct the terminus below ground. Finsbury Park remained as an overcrowded terminus of the line, and was described as &quot;intolerable&quot;. Many passengers arriving at both stations had to change onto buses, trams, and suburban rail services to complete their journeys further north. The GNR attempted to address this issue by considering electrification several times, but to no avail due to shortage of funds. Meanwhile, the LER proposed an extension in 1920 but was by the GNR, which was widely regarded as &quot;unreasonable&quot;. In 1923, a petition by the Middlesex Federation of Ratepayers to repeal the 1902 act of Parliament emerged. It was reported that a &quot;fierce exchange of arguments&quot; occurred during a parliamentary session in March 1924 to request this change. Frank Pick, as the new assistant managing director of the Underground, distributed photographs of the congestion at Finsbury Park to the press. All of this pressure finally prompted the government to initiate &quot;The North and North-East London Traffic Inquiry&quot;, with initial reports only recommending a one-station extension to Manor House. The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), being the successor of the GNR, was placed in the position of electrifying its own services or withdrawing its veto of an extension of the Piccadilly line. With funds still being insufficient to electrify the railway, the LNER reluctantly agreed to the latter. An extension was highly likely at this stage, based on a study in October 1925 by the London &amp; Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee.
Pick, together with the Underground board, began working on the extension proposal. Much pressure was also received from a few districts such as Tottenham and Harringay, but it was decided that the optimal route would be the midpoint of the GNR and the Hertford Line. This was backed by the committee, and parliamentary approval for the extension was obtained on 4 June 1930, under the (20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5. c. lxxxviii). Funding was obtained from legislation under the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act 1929 (20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5. c. 7) instead of the Trade Facilities Act. The extension would pass through Manor House, Wood Green and Southgate, ending at Enfield West (now Oakwood); based on the absence of property development along the line. In November 1929, the projected terminus was shifted further north to Cockfosters to accommodate a larger depot. It was estimated that ridership on the extension, which would cost £4.4 million, would be 36 million passengers a year. In addition to Enfield West, stations were designated at Southgate, Arnos Grove, Bounds Green, Wood Green, Turnpike Lane, and Manor House. Bounds Green station was almost cancelled in order to improve journey times. A more expensive provision was rejected, which included construction of a third track between Finsbury Park and Wood Green. Furthermore, since journey speed was a primary consideration in decision-making for the extension, the pencilled-in and much lobbied-for additional station near the corner of Green Lanes and St. Ann&#x27;s Road in Harringay was dropped.

Tunnel rings, cabling and concrete were produced in Northern England, while unemployed industrial workers there helped in the construction of the extension. Construction of the extension started quickly, with the boring of the twin tube tunnels between Arnos Grove and Finsbury Park proceeding at the rate of a mile per month. Twenty-two tunnelling shields were used for the tunnels, and tunnel diameters were slightly larger than the old section, at . Sharp curves were also avoided to promote higher average speeds on the extension. Platforms long were originally planned for each station to fit 8-car trains, but were cut short to when built. Some stations were also built with wider platform tunnels to cater to expected high patronage. To connect with buses and trams, interchange stations were provided with exits which led passengers directly to the bus terminal or tram stop from the subsurface ticket hall. The exits were purposed to improve connections which avoided chaotic passenger flow such as at Finsbury Park. Wood Green was an exception due to engineering difficulties, with the ticket hall at street level instead. Ventilation shafts were provided at Finsbury Park Tennis Courts, Colina Road and Nightingale Road, supplementing the existing fans within the stations. Provisions for future branch lines to Enfield and Tottenham were made at Wood Green and Manor House respectively, both to have reversing sidings. This had since changed, with only a reversing siding built at Wood Green and no provision for the branch line. Arnos Grove was built to have four platforms facing three tracks for trains to reverse regularly, with seven stabling sidings instead of one reversing siding and two platforms.

Most of the tunnelling works were completed by October 1931, with the Wood Green and Bounds Green station tunnels done by the end of the year. The first phase of the extension to Arnos Grove opened on 19 September 1932, without ceremony. The line was further extended to Enfield West on 13 March 1933 and finally to Cockfosters on 31 July 1933, again without ceremonies. The total length of the extension was . Free tickets were distributed to residents on the first days of service on each extension. Initial ridership was 25 million at the end of 1933, which sharply increased to 70 million by 1951. Despite there being no official opening ceremonies, the Prince of Wales visited the extension on 14 February 1933.

===Westward extensions===
The Hounslow West (then Hounslow Barracks) extension of the Piccadilly line, together with the Uxbridge extension, aimed to improve services on the District line which at the time were serving both branches from Acton Town (then Mill Hill Park). The Uxbridge extension followed along existing routes on the DR and Met. The DR opened a spur from Ealing Common to South Harrow in June 1903. The Met opened its extension to Uxbridge in July 1904. Through trains of the DR were eventually extended to Uxbridge on 1 March 1910, henceforth sharing tracks with the Met between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge.

The viaduct from Studland Road Junction west of Hammersmith to Turnham Green was quadrupled on 3 November 1911. The London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR) used the northern pair of tracks while the District Railway used the southern pair. The LER proposed an extension in November 1912 to Richmond due to available capacity to the west and the fact that passenger interchanges were large at Hammersmith. It would connect with the L&amp;SWR tracks at Turnham Green. It was approved as the London Electric Railway Act 1913 (3 &amp; 4 Geo. 5. c. xcvii) on 15 August 1913, but World War I resulted in no works done on the extension. A parliamentary report of 1919 recommended through running to Richmond and Ealing. The Richmond extension plan was revived in 1922 by Lord Ashfield, the Underground&#x27;s chairman. It was decided that the Piccadilly line extension was favourable over the CLR&#x27;s as it was cheaper and had more capacity available. By 1925, the District line was running out of capacity west of Hammersmith, where services were headed to South Harrow, Hounslow Barracks, Richmond and Ealing Broadway. Demand was also low on the South Harrow branch because of infrequent services and competition among other rail lines in the vicinity of each station. This prompted the Piccadilly line extension to be an express service between Hammersmith and Acton Town, with the future Heathrow Airport extension safeguarded in 40 years&#x27; time. The Piccadilly line would run on the inner pair of tracks, and the District line on the outer. Permission was granted to quadruple tracks to Acton Town in 1926 in conjunction with permit renewal for the extension. The Richmond extension never happened, but provisions allocated would allow this option to be revisited later. Extensions would instead be to Hounslow Barracks and South Harrow, taking over DR services to the latter, with an estimated cost of £2.3 million. In 1930, unsuccessful negotiations were made between LER and the Met to extend Piccadilly line trains to Rayners Lane for passengers to change trains.

In 1929, quadrupling was to extend to Northfields for express trains to terminate there. This work was completed on 18 December 1932. Overall works for the extension began in 1931, approximately a year after permission was granted and funded under the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act 1929 (20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5. c. 7). The Studland Road Junction area was partially rebuilt, with some of the old viaducts retained to date. The junctions diverging to Richmond were reconfigured at Turnham Green. Reversing facilities were initially designated at the latter, but these were not built. Trial runs of Piccadilly line trains began on 27 June 1932. On 4 July 1932, services were extended to South Harrow, which replaced DR services. Northfields services were introduced on 9 January 1933, and on 13 March, were extended to Hounslow West. On 1 July 1933, the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) was formed, which included the Met, the DR and LER. The board decided that there was sufficient demand to run through trains to Uxbridge due to rapidly developing suburbs along the line. The extension of Piccadilly line trains to Uxbridge began on 23 October 1933, but with many trains still reversing at South Harrow. By then, most Piccadilly line trains continued beyond Hammersmith, and District line trains to Hounslow were reduced to off-peak shuttles to Acton Town. An enhanced off-peak Piccadilly line service was introduced on 29 April 1935, cutting off-peak District line services down to the Acton Town–South Acton shuttle. South Harrow short trips proved to be an inconvenience. The solution was to move reversing facilities to Rayners Lane. A new reversing siding was built there in 1935, which allowed some peak hour trains to terminate beginning in May 1936. Regular reversals were fully implemented in October 1943. Peak-hour District line trains to Hounslow were fully withdrawn on 9 October 1964.

===Modernisation, World War II and Victoria line===
In conjunction with the new extensions, several stations were considered for closure to increase overall line speeds. Down Street closed on 21 May 1932, Brompton Road on 29 July 1934, and York Road on 17 September 1932. All three stations were lightly used. Down Street and Brompton Road were replaced, respectively, by relocated entrances at Hyde Park Corner and Knightsbridge. Knightsbridge&#x27;s new below-ground ticket hall required stairwells from the entrance, one of which took over part of the Barclays Bank branch there. Both of the latter two stations retained their existing platforms, but the access from the surface was reconstructed with their entrances closer to the closed stations. These new entrances were provided with escalators, which replaced the lifts, improving passenger circulation. The Aldwych branch was deemed unprofitable. In 1929, an extension to Waterloo was approved, costed at £750,000, but no progress was made on its construction. Dover Street (now Green Park), Leicester Square and Holborn stations received new sets of escalators, the latter having four in a single shaft. These were completed in the early 1930s. As part of the 1935–40 New Works Programme, Earl&#x27;s Court was largely reconstructed at street level. At King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras, the Piccadilly and Northern lines were finally connected via new escalators, albeit with construction delayed due to financial difficulties. As a result, Russell Square station retained its lifts.

To prepare for the Second World War, several stations had blast walls added. Others, such as Green Park, Knightsbridge and King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras, had floodgates installed. The line was also involved in the evacuation of 200,000 children, by transporting them towards both ends of the line, then transferring them to main line trains to continue their journeys to different country distribution hubs. Some underground stations were fitted with bunk beds, toilets and first aid facilities, and sewerage. The disused Down Street was converted to an underground bunker for government use. Other stations such as Holborn and Earl&#x27;s Court also had essential wartime uses. The former had the Aldwych branch platforms as the wartime engineering quarters whilst the branch service was temporarily closed. The latter produced Torpedo Data Computers at the transfer concourse between the District and Piccadilly lines. Aldwych station was used as storage for British Museum exhibits. On 13 October 1940, a bomb explosion caused the westbound platform tunnel at Bounds Green station to collapse, killing nineteen shelterers. Train services were suspended for two months.

In preparation for the Victoria line, cross-platform interchange was to be provided at a few stations, which included Finsbury Park on the Piccadilly line. This meant that the Piccadilly line had to be realigned there, and the Northern City line platforms, being parallel to the existing Piccadilly line platforms, were to be transferred to the pair of lines. The Northern City line would be redirected to the surface platforms. The westbound Piccadilly line track would be rerouted onto one of these platforms, with the southbound Victoria line using the other. The northbound Victoria line would reuse the old westbound Piccadilly line platform and a part of the old tunnels, with the Piccadilly line diversion tunnels spanning .

Construction of the diversion began in October 1964, with the Northern City line having a temporary closure. At the northern junction, step plate junctions were built to divert the existing line when the new tunnels were complete. They were fitted into the original Northern City line tunnels which had a greater tunnel diameter until two running tunnels were able to merge. The old and unused running tunnel was disconnected and blocked off when the junction tunnel was near its completion. Alteration of temporary points junctions and shifting of signals completed the diversion tunnels. In the south, the Piccadilly would be diverted to descend sharply under the northbound Victoria line tunnel, and then ascending to the original level which had a difference of approximately north of Arsenal station. The old westbound tunnel had to be supported on a trestle for works to be done. The trestle and old tracks were entirely removed once the diversion was ready for switchover. New tracks were laid at a rapid rate; it was done in about thirteen hours on 3 October 1965. Both lines were connected via junctions south of Finsbury Park for stock movement and engineering trains. It was intended for Green Park to have cross-platform interchange, but was deemed impossible due to the lines crossing at right angles. The Victoria line opened on 1 September 1968 from Walthamstow Central to Highbury &amp; Islington via Finsbury Park, and on 7 March 1969 to Warren Street via King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras, providing relief to the Piccadilly line.

===Extension to Heathrow Airport===

To cater to the rapid growth of road traffic to Heathrow Airport, several rail lines were considered to serve the airport. An average increment of 1 million passengers a year between 1953 and 1973, and rising issues with airline coach services from major terminals due to location, traffic congestion, larger aircraft capacity and increasing leisure travel further increased the need for public transport connections. Other than the Piccadilly line extension from Hounslow West, a Southern Railway spur (section now transferred to part of South Western Railway) from Feltham was also contemplated. These schemes were brought into parliamentary discussion in November 1966, and were approved with royal assent as the London Transport Act 1967 (c. xxxix) and British Railways Act 1967 (c. xxx) respectively on 27 July 1967. Partial government funding was obtained in April 1972 for the Piccadilly line extension, and the estimated cost of construction was £12.3 million.

On 27 April 1971, a construction ceremony was launched by Sir Desmond Plummer, leader of the Greater London Council, by bulldozing &quot;the first sod&quot;. Platforms at Hounslow West had to be relocated below-ground to the north of the existing for the new track alignment. The 1931 ticket hall was retained, with connections to the new platforms. A cut-and-cover excavation method was used between Hounslow West and Hatton Cross, a new station on the extension. This 2-mile section had a shallow trench dug, with the tunnel walls supported by intersecting concrete piles. The line had to cross the River Crane just east of Hatton Cross; therefore it emerges briefly on a bridge, with the two portals having concrete retaining walls. Deep tube tunnels were bored from Hatton Cross to Heathrow Central (now Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3). On 19 July 1975, the line was extended to Hatton Cross. The Heathrow Central extension was inaugurated by the Queen around noon on 16 December 1977, with revenue services commencing at 3pm.

In the 1970s, planning was already underway for a fourth terminal for the airport, and its location was to be to the southeast of the existing terminals. As the Piccadilly line&#x27;s route to the existing terminals was out of place, a loop track was adopted as the best method to serve the new terminal. The westbound track between Hatton Cross and Heathrow Central would be retained for emergency services. Approval for British Airport Authority (BAA) to construct the fourth terminal was granted in 1979. Permissions for constructing for the loop was approved and received royal assent under the London Transport Act 1981 (c. xxxii) on 30 October 1981. The station box would be built by BAA as part of the £200 million construction cost of the new terminal. By 1982, construction of the fourth terminal building was behind schedule, and in July 1982 the location of the station was moved from below the terminal building to a nearby car park. Construction of the extension began on 9 February 1983, with an estimated cost of £24.6 million. Tunnelling for the loop was completed in seventeen months. It was expected that the extension would open with the new terminal. However, the terminal opening was delayed, with the loop service completed and commissioned on 4 November 1985. The terminal and station were finally opened a few months later on 1 April 1986, by the Prince and Princess of Wales. Regular traffic began twelve days later with trains serving Terminal 4 via a one-way loop to Terminals 1,2,3. The station only has a single platform, the only one with this configuration on the Piccadilly line.

Terminal 5 required another extension, funded by BAA. However, its proposed alignment caused an issue: it was reported that London Underground was unhappy with the terminal&#x27;s location on the site of the old Perry Oaks sludge works which was originally intended for Terminal 4. It was now impossible for all three terminals to be served on the same route, and the final solution was to have twin tunnels serving Terminal 5 from Terminals 1,2,3. From 7 January 2005 until 17 September 2006, the loop via Terminal 4 was closed to allow this connection to be built. Terminals 1,2,3 became a temporary terminus; shuttle buses served Terminal 4 from the Hatton Cross bus station. Part of the junction between the through and loop tracks needed to be rebuilt. The Terminal 5 project team shut down two aircraft stands from Terminal 3 so that an access shaft could be constructed. The new junction was then built into a concrete box which connected all the underground tunnels. The station and terminal were opened on 27 March 2008, splitting westbound Piccadilly line services into two: one via the Terminal 4 loop, another direct to Terminal 5.

===Aldwych branch closure===

Plans to extend the Aldwych branch south to Waterloo were revived several times during the station&#x27;s life. The extension was considered in 1919 and 1948, but no progress towards constructing the link was made.

In the years after the Second World War, a series of preliminary plans for relieving congestion on the London Underground had considered various east–west routes through the Aldwych area, although other priorities meant that these were never proceeded with. In March 1965, a British Rail and London Transport joint planning committee published &quot;A Railway Plan for London&quot;, which proposed a new tube railway, the Fleet line (later renamed the Jubilee line), to join the Bakerloo line at then run via Aldwych and into the City of London before heading into south-east London. An interchange was proposed at Aldwych and a second recommendation of the report was the revival of the link from Aldwych to Waterloo. London Transport had already sought parliamentary approval to construct tunnels from Aldwych to Waterloo in November 1964, and in August 1965, parliamentary powers were granted. Detailed planning took place, although public spending cuts led to postponement of the scheme in 1967 before tenders were invited.

With the Aldwych branch receiving no extensions, it remained a lightly used shuttle service from Holborn. The branch was considered for closure many times, but it survived. Saturday services were fully withdrawn on 5 August 1962, leaving the line with a peak hour only shuttle on weekdays. In 1993, The original 1907 lifts, which now failed to meet the safety standards at the time, required replacement at a cost of over £3 million. As a result, in August 1993, a public inquiry was held for closure of the short branch line. On 30 September 1994, the branch was closed to traffic. The disused station is now used for commercial filming and as a training facility, with the line retaining its link to the rest of the Piccadilly line.

===Notable incidents and events===
====King&#x27;s Cross fire====


On 18 November 1987, the large King&#x27;s Cross fire broke out, the incident being near the Northern/Piccadilly line escalators which killed 31 people. As a result, wooden escalators were replaced at all Underground stations. The Piccadilly line platforms remained open, but with the escalators to the ticket hall closed for repairs. Access was temporarily via the Victoria line or Midland City platforms. New escalators were fully installed on 27 February 1989.

====7 July 2005 London bombings====

On 7 July 2005, a Piccadilly line train was attacked by suicide bomber Germaine Lindsay in the day&#x27;s London bombings. The blast occurred at 08:50 BST while the train was between King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras and Russell Square. It was part of a co-ordinated Islamist terrorist attack on London&#x27;s transport network, and was synchronised with three other attacks: two on the Circle line and one on a bus at Tavistock Square. The Piccadilly line bomb led to the largest number of fatalities, with 26 people reported killed. Owing to it being a deep-level line, evacuation of station users and access for the emergency services proved difficult. Shuttle services were introduced between Hyde Park Corner and the Heathrow loop, between Acton Town and Rayners Lane, and between Arnos Grove and Cockfosters. Full service was restored on 4 August, four weeks after the bombing.

====100-year celebration====
On 15 December 2006, a 100-year celebration of the Piccadilly line was launched. A birthday card was revealed by Tim O&#x27;Toole, then London Underground Managing Director at Leicester Square station.

==Architecture==

Most of the deep level stations opened in the first phase between Finsbury Park and Hammersmith were built to a design by Leslie Green. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with dark oxblood red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. Earl&#x27;s Court and Barons Court stations was built with a red brick building by Harry Wharton Ford, with semicircular windows on the second level and embedded names of the railways which operated through the station. Both station buildings are Grade II listed, and this building design at the former replaced a wooden hut building.

Extensions of the Piccadilly line towards the west and north in the 1930s had new stations designed by Charles Holden of Adams, Holden &amp; Pearson architectural practice. These designs were inspired by modern architecture seen in a 1930 trip to several European Countries.

Several stations on the western extension originally built by the District Railway were reconstructed. The new designs used brick, concrete and glass to construct simple geometrical shapes, such as cylinders and rectangles. The first prototype station was Sudbury Town station, which has a brick cuboid box topped with a concrete slab roof for the main structure, with tall windows above the entrances. This design was replicated across many other stations. Due to the workload, some stations&#x27; designs were carried out as collaborations with the Underground&#x27;s own Architect, Stanley Heaps (Boston Manor, Osterley, Ealing Common and Hounslow West), or architects from other practices (Reginald Uren for Rayner&#x27;s Lane) or entirely by another practice in Holden&#x27;s style (Felix Lander for Park Royal). The new stations built for the northern extension were also part of the design schemes undertaken by Holden. Southgate was distinctively different, with a round base carrying a cylindrical panel of clerestory windows, topped by an illuminated feature with a bronze ball. The ticket halls had passimeters, which functioned as free-standing ticket booths. Most of them ceased to be used when automatic ticket gates were introduced, although some have been converted for retail use. Many of these Holden-designed stations are listed buildings, Oakwood, Southgate, and Arnos Grove being among the early receivers in 1971.

Stations in Central London were modernised. Green Park received a new shelter at the southern entrance; Piccadilly Circus had its ticket hall moved below street level. Both of these changes were designed by Holden, with the latter&#x27;s station ticket hall having artwork commemorating Frank Pick added in 2016. Green Park also was built with a new entrance at a corner of Devonshire House, which has Portland Stone clad steel frames. It features Graeco-Roman details, and is Grade II listed. Some stations kept their original buildings. South Ealing, where a temporary wooden station ticket hall was constructed when the line was quadrupled, was an anomaly; a modern station was not provided until the 1980s.

Green&#x27;s stations such as Caledonian Road have bands of tiles arching overhead on the curved platform ceilings and above the tracks spaced apart. Along the platform walls, geometrical patterns of tiles were arranged in a horizontal band; varying among stations. Arc lighting was complemented with incandescent lamps to illuminate the platforms. Signage decorations, also designed by Green, present spelt out the station name in letters high. Stations on the northern extension had particular biscuit (square) tiles on platform walls, with different frieze colours at each station. A few stations like Southgate and Bounds Green have art deco uplighters on escalators and the lower landings. Floodlighting was used considerably to provide a spacious ambience. Ventilation ducts were by the platforms walls, sealed with bronze art deco style grilles. Oakwood was built with a concrete canopy, with roof lights and cylindrical light fittings designed by Heaps.

==Infrastructure==

===Signalling and electricity===

The line from Cockfosters to Heathrow and South Harrow is controlled from a control centre at South Kensington, which replaced the old Earl&#x27;s Court control centre, which was shared with the District line. Rayners Lane signal cabin is responsible for signalling the Piccadilly line from just northwest of South Harrow to Uxbridge, as well as the Metropolitan line joining at Rayners Lane. The signalling system is expected to be upgraded in line with the Deep Tube upgrade, which will increase line frequencies up to 33 tph. Trains may also be able to make a permanent additional stop at Turnham Green following this upgrade.

When the line was opened from Finsbury Park to Hammersmith, its signalling system was identical to the Bakerloo and District lines. Small cabins at each location of crossover installed controlled the signals there. Single lamps displayed track clearance in the form of green or red, with variations of yellow at difficult-to-spot locations. This equipment was supplied by Westinghouse and operated using compressed air. The exception was between West Kensington and Hammersmith, where it was controlled by District Railway signal boxes, and had semaphore signals instead. The Piccadilly line extensions resulted in resignalling on tracks west of Barons Court. Signal cabins were adjusted and new ones were added at Hammersmith, Acton Town and Northfields. A mixture of semaphore and colour-light signals were used on the four-track section. Signalling was redone on the new Uxbridge branch.

Speed control was introduced at several stations to enhance the signalling system after World War II. This enabled a train to proceed slowly into an occupied platform without stopping in front of another before it departed, thus improving headways. The last semaphore signal, at Ealing Common, was replaced in November 1953. A control room was built at Earl&#x27;s Court to centralise supervision of most of the line signalling in the 1960s, while Rayners Lane signal cabin was, and still is, the main control centre of the Rayners Lane to Uxbridge portion; shared with the Metropolitan line. 1930s automatic signalling equipment was updated in the 1970s and 1980s.

The UERL built a large power station that would be capable of providing power for the District line and the underground lines planned. Work began in 1902 at Lots Road, by Chelsea Creek, and in February 1905 Lots Road Power Station began generating electricity at , conveyed by high-voltage cables to substations that converted this to approximately . On the Piccadilly line, electricity was transmitted via underground ducts to Earl&#x27;s Court, which was then distributed to different substations. Power supply for the Cockfosters extension was initially generated by the North Metropolitan Electric Power Supply Company at Wood Green. It was later supplied by Lots Road station. The National Grid network took over the supply on the Ravenscourt Park to Uxbridge and Northfields section. Lots Road was permanently closed on 31 October 2003, being also replaced by power supply from the National Grid Network. Emergency lighting, powered by batteries, is available at every station, with emergency supply from a support power station in Greenwich.

===Depots and sidings===

The line has two depots, at Cockfosters and Northfields. The former site is near Trent Park, and was the preferred site over Oakwood, which was smaller, and its only access point was south of the station. Subsequently, Oakwood was built with an island platform, with its intended three-track terminus layout moved to Cockfosters. Light maintenance and cleaning of trains is done here, with the latter site, being the main depot, having train maintenance facilities. Northfields depot is also double-ended, with access from just west of Boston Manor station and Northfields station. For it to be built, the latter station had to be rebuilt nearer to South Ealing station. The depot was opened earlier than the Hounslow extension, on 4 July 1932, and fully electrified two months later.

Single sidings are placed at Rayners Lane, Oakwood, Down Street (Hyde Park Corner), and Wood Green. Arnos Grove, Acton Town, South Harrow, Uxbridge, Hammersmith and Heathrow Terminal 5 have more than one siding for reversing trains or storing them. Four crossovers were built for the initial line opening in 1906, Hounslow Central on 3 March 1923, and double crossovers at South Harrow were added in the 1930s.

Crossovers with other lines are present on the Piccadilly line. A connecting tunnel from the northbound Piccadilly line at King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras to the northbound Northern line Bank branch was constructed in 1927. At Finsbury Park, a set of crossovers in the south were retained where trains can cross over onto the Victoria line.

Lillie Bridge was the main depot when the Piccadilly line was initially opened. Trains entering service on the line had to reverse and enter the District line tracks first via West Kensington. When the Piccadilly and District line tracks were realigned in the 1930s, access points into the depot had to be altered. When the line was extended to Northfields and Cockfosters in 1933, all trains except seven were stabled at the newer depot. Once the Cockfosters depot was opened, Lillie Bridge was converted to a maintenance depot, where it housed only engineers&#x27; and materials trains.

===Station lifts and escalators===
Most original deep-level stations were installed with lifts and stairs, with some descending directly down to platform level. Many of these were given an overhaul in the 1930s with escalators replacing lifts for quicker passenger flow. Underground stations on the Cockfosters extension were built with access mainly via escalators; each station shaft are able to fit three escalators, but some stations had two escalators with a stairwell by the middle. Escalators at Bounds Green, Wood Green and Manor House travel at per minute, which were then the quickest on the network. All of the original lifts were either replaced by new equipment or were converted to escalators. Alperton was the only above ground station to have an escalator, which was transferred over from the Festival of Britain, but was decommissioned in 1988. Stations such as Green Park and King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras were installed with new lifts to provide step-free access to every platform by the 2012 Summer Olympics.

==Services==

Journey times on the Piccadilly line are usually around an hour and a half. Train dwell times are slightly longer at some stations, such as at Heathrow Terminals 4 and 5 stations. The former requires 8 minutes, while the latter needs 7 minutes to coordinate with the alternate Heathrow service schedule. The busiest section, as of 2016, is between King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras and Russell Square. This is expected to expand, between Holloway Road and Holborn in the 2040s. The central section between Earl&#x27;s Court and King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras is in Fare Zone 1, to Manor House and Turnham Green in Zone 2, and to Bounds Green, Park Royal and Northfields in Zone 3; to Southgate, Sudbury Hill and Hounslow Central in Zone 4, to Cockfosters, Hatton Cross and Eastcote in Zone 5, and to Uxbridge and Heathrow Terminals in Zone 6. 79 trains are required to operate a 24 trains per hour (tph) peak-hour service on the line, while typical off-peak services are generally as follows (as of 6 July 2020):

* 6 tph Cockfosters – Heathrow Terminal 4
* 6 tph Cockfosters – Heathrow Terminal 5
* 3 tph Cockfosters – Rayners Lane

Trains also make an additional stop at in the early mornings and late evenings. Night Tube services have operated every 10 minutes between Cockfosters and Heathrow Terminal 5 since 16 December 2016. No Night Tube services operate to Heathrow Terminal 4 or Uxbridge. 

===Historical services===
On 11 October 1909, peak-hour services were altered to have trains skipping certain stops to improve journey times. Trains were marked with &quot;Non Stop&quot;, which were deemed unpopular and ambiguous among passengers. Illuminated signs were added on platforms in 1932 to address this issue. Pairs of stations were the norm, such as Holloway Road and York Road, and Caledonian Road and Gillespie Road. After World War I, Covent Garden, Russell Square, South Kensington, Brompton Road and Gloucester Road were among the stations skipped. Boston Manor, South Ealing, North Ealing and Barons Court were included into these patterns by 1938. Skip-stop services were discontinued in June 1947.

In 1930, during the planning of the northward and westward extensions, a 30tph peak-hour service was proposed between Wood Green and Turnham Green. This was preferred over an alternate skip-stop service through Bounds Green. When the Piccadilly line was initially extended to Northfields in 1933, South Ealing was skipped. It was eventually served on 29 April 1935 by off-peak trains, and peak services in May 1942.

When the Piccadilly line shared its storage of trains with the District line at Lillie Bridge Depot, some trains started and ended their service at West Kensington; a few of these ran empty between West Kensington and Hammersmith. These services ceased on 27 October 1991.

During disruptions, Piccadilly line trains were able to run on the “local” District line tracks, stopping at all stations between Acton Town and Hammersmith. The crossover points at Hammersmith were decommissioned and subsequently removed in the early-2020s meaning that this is no longer possible. 

==Rolling stock==

The six-car 1973 tube stocks provide services on the Piccadilly line, which were built between 1974 and 1977 by Metro-Cammell. These trains were built longer than the 1959 stock trains to accommodate more luggage space and speed up journey times with more comfort. As of 2020, their livery is of standard London Underground corporate of blue, white and red. They were previously unpainted, exposing the aluminium alloy material. Traction voltage is at current powered by the third and fourth rail. The first of these trains entered service on 18 August 1975. They were refurbished by Bombardier from 1995 to 2000 in Wakefield, Yorkshire. Changes included the removal of transverse seating, strap hangers replaced with grab bars, new floor material and a full repaint into London Underground&#x27;s corporate livery. A refurbished carriage on one train was first seen in service on 20 January 1991 to test the new interior concept.

=== Future rolling stock ===

In the late 1990s, the Labour government initiated a public–private partnership (PPP) to reverse years of underinvestment in London Underground. Tube Lines planned to order 93 new Piccadilly line trains, which would enter service by 2014. In January 2007, Tube Lines started the process of ordering new Piccadilly line trains, by querying if train manufacturers would be interested in supplying them. Contract award was anticipated for 2008, and trains would enter service on the Piccadilly line in 2014. However, TfL bought out the Tube Lines consortium after cost overruns in 2010, formally ending the PPP.

In the mid 2010s, TfL began a process of ordering new rolling stock to replace trains on the Piccadilly, Central, Bakerloo and Waterloo &amp; City lines. A feasibility study into the new trains showed that new generation trains and re-signalling could increase capacity on the Piccadilly line by 60%, with 36 trains per hour.

In June 2018, the Siemens Inspiro was selected. These trains will have an open gangway design, wider doorways, air conditioning and the ability to run automatically with a new signalling system. However, TfL could only afford to order 94 trains at a cost of £1.5bn, and not the cost of resignalling and automating the line. Half of the trains will be built in Goole, East Riding of Yorkshire. Trains are expected to enter service in 2025, and are currently undergoing testing at a depot in Germany.

===Historical tube stocks===

The line was previously worked by the 1906 gate stock, which were manufactured in France and Hungary. The carriages were connected to form three, four or five-car trains, and were designed to have a maximum of six cars per train. Built with steel as its main material, the interiors were covered by fireproof mahogany veneer. Six-car trains were implemented in 1917. Additional cars were ordered and brought into service between 1920 and 1921 to combat shortage of capacity. In late 1920s, plans were developed to replace these outdated stocks. Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon &amp; Finance Company (Metro-Cammell&#x27;s predecessor) was to build standard tube stocks, which were delivered within 1928 and 1929. Another batch of these were constructed in Feltham by the Union Construction company. All the gate stocks were decommissioned in June 1929. The new standard tube stocks have some wider doors on trailer cars and extra doors on the motor car. All doors are now air-operated. In 1929, it was suggested that a new prototype of tube stock should include three double doors on each side. These seven-car trains, also standard tube stocks, had carriages at least one foot longer. They were made to be lighter, and had better interior lighting. These new trains were completed in two periods, 1931 and 1934, which costed £1.20 million in total.

Due to ridership increasing by on the Uxbridge branch between 1931 and 1938, Piccadilly line trains were packed with passengers. New experimental trains were brought into service in 1936, which were formed of four or six cars. These trains had their control equipment (of seven different types from four different manufacturers) placed under the car floor, which enabled more space for passengers on both motor cars. While boarding times were decreased, some of the designs of control equipment were said to be less reliable than others. Nevertheless, they were a prototype for the design of the 1938 stock. As a safety measure for World War II, trains initially had their lights switched off at night. It was later amended to illuminate trains with dim blue lamps, and then, largely enclosed reading lamps. Patronage on the line increased greatly after the war, which meant additional trains were needed. New 1938 stocks, together with the experimental trains were rebuilt to form a fleet of seven-car 1949 stock trains, in operation from 1952.

New test trains were manufactured again in the 1950s. Three prototype trains, branded as the 1956 stock, were trialled on the Piccadilly line in 1957 and 1958. These new trains would replace most of the Standard stock. It was successful, and 76 seven-car trains were placed on order as the 1959 stock. These were built by Metro-Cammell, with the first train entering service on 14 December 1959. The standard stocks were withdrawn by 1964, and the 1938 stocks were slowly taken out of service due to age. The 1959 stocks were gradually transferred to the Northern line between November 1975 and October 1979, being replaced by the 1973 stock trains; the last of the latter coming into service on 5 October 1979.

A few 1938 trains were preserved, and in June 2011, one of these trains made a few shuttle trips on the line as part of an event in conjunction with Father&#x27;s Day.

* opened 23 June 1903; closed 5 July 1931. Although on the route of the current Piccadilly line, a short distance north of the present station, it was never served by Piccadilly line trains. It was opened by the District Railway, and was closed and replaced by Park Royal before the Piccadilly line started running trains to South Harrow in 1932.
* opened 15 December 1906; closed 19 September 1932, between and . It was about 600 m north of King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras.

==Future upgrade and proposals==
The Piccadilly line is to be upgraded under the New Tube for London scheme, involving new trains as well as new signalling, increasing the line&#x27;s capacity by some and reducing journey times by one fifth. Bids for new rolling stock were originally submitted in 2008. However, after the acquisition of Tube Lines by Transport for London in June 2010, this order was cancelled and the upgrade postponed.

LUL then invited Alstom, Bombardier and Siemens Mobility to develop a new concept of lightweight, low-energy, semi-articulated train for the deep-level lines, provisionally called &quot;Evo&quot; (for &#x27;evolution&#x27;). Siemens publicised an outline design featuring air-conditioning and battery power to enable the train to run on to the next station if third and fourth rail power were lost. It would have a lower floor and higher passenger capacity than the present tube stock.
There would be a weight saving of 30 tonnes, and the trains would be more energy-efficient with air-conditioning included, or more energy-efficient without it. Siemens Mobility was awarded a £1.5 billion contract in June 2018 to produce the new trains at a planned factory in Goole, East Yorkshire.

The intention is for the new trains to eventually operate on the Bakerloo, Central, Piccadilly and Waterloo &amp; City lines. Resignalling work on the Piccadilly line was to begin in 2019 but this has since been shelved because of lack of funds. New trains were due to enter service in 2023, bringing an increase in peak frequencies from 24 to 27 tph. In March 2021, it was reported that the new trains would not enter service before 2025, that the increase in peak frequency from 24 to 27 tph would not take place until about 2027, and that any further increase to 30 tph would be delayed until the signalling system is upgraded, for which funds are not currently available.

There have previously been some proposals, predominantly by Slough Borough Council, to extend the line towards Slough railway station from Heathrow Terminal 5 station. A number of routes have been proposed, and the main ones pass very close to but do not call at Windsor. The current thinking, and most viable options are to support a western access link diverging from the Great Western Main Line just east of Langley station.

In 2005, a business case was prepared to re-open the disused York Road station, to serve the King&#x27;s Cross Central development and help relieve congestion at King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras.

<text>12 Angry Men is a 1957 American legal drama film directed by Sidney Lumet in his feature directorial debut, adapted by Reginald Rose from his 1954 teleplay. A critique of the American jury system during the McCarthy Era, the film tells the story of a jury of twelve men as they deliberate the conviction or acquittal of a teenager charged with murder on the basis of reasonable doubt; disagreement and conflict among the jurors forces them to question their morals and values. It stars an ensemble cast, featuring Henry Fonda (who also produced the film with Rose), Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, E. G. Marshall, and Jack Warden.

An independent production distributed by United Artists, &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; received acclaim from critics, despite a lukewarm box-office performance. At the 30th Academy Awards, it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay. It is regarded by many as one of the greatest films ever made.

In 2007, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;. Additionally, it was selected as the second-best courtroom drama ever (after 1962&#x27;s &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;) by the American Film Institute for their AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 list.

==Plot==

On a hot summer day in the New York County Courthouse, the trial phase has just concluded for an impoverished 18-year-old boy accused of killing his abusive father. The judge instructs the jury that if there is reasonable doubt, the jurors must return a verdict of &quot;not guilty&quot;. If the defendant is found guilty, he will receive a mandatory death sentence via the electric chair. The verdict must be unanimous.

At first, the case seems clear. A neighbor testified to witnessing the defendant stab his father, from her window, through the windows of a passing elevated train. Another neighbor testified that he heard the defendant threaten to kill his father, and the father&#x27;s body hitting the floor; then, as he ran to his door, he saw the defendant running down the stairs. The boy had recently purchased a switchblade of the same type that was found, wiped of fingerprints, at the murder scene, but claimed he lost it.

In a preliminary vote, all jurors vote &quot;guilty&quot; except Juror 8, who believes there should be some discussion before the verdict. He says he cannot vote &quot;guilty&quot; because reasonable doubt exists. When his first few arguments (including producing a recently purchased knife nearly identical to the murder weapon that was thought to be unique) seemingly fail to convince any of the other jurors, Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot, from which he will abstain; if all the other jurors still vote guilty, he will acquiesce. The ballot reveals one &quot;not guilty&quot; vote. Juror 9 reveals that he changed his vote; he respects Juror 8&#x27;s motives, and agrees there should be more discussion.

Juror 8 argues that the train noise would have obscured everything the second witness claimed to have overheard. Jurors 5 and 11 change their votes. Jurors 5, 6 and 8 further question the second witness&#x27;s story, and question whether the death threat was figurative speech. After looking at a diagram of the witness&#x27;s apartment and conducting an experiment, the jurors determine that it is impossible for the disabled witness to have made it to the door in time. Juror 3, infuriated, argues with and tries to attack Juror 8, yelling a death threat; jurors 5, 6 and 7 physically restrain Juror 3. Jurors 2 and 6 change their votes; the jury is now evenly split.

Juror 4 doubts the defendant&#x27;s alibi, as the boy did not recall specific details. Juror 8 tests Juror 4&#x27;s own memory to make a point. Jurors 2 and 5 point out the father&#x27;s stab wound was angled downwards, although the boy was shorter than his father. Juror 7 changes his vote out of impatience rather than conviction, angering Juror 11. After another vote, jurors 1 and 12 also change sides, leaving only three &quot;guilty&quot; votes.

Juror 10 goes on a bigoted rant, causing Juror 4 to forbid him to speak for the remainder of the deliberation. When Juror 4 is pressed as to why he still maintains a guilty vote, he declares that the woman who saw the killing from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 reverts to a guilty vote.

After watching Juror 4 remove his spectacles and rub the impressions they made on his nose, Juror 9 realizes that the first witness was constantly rubbing similar impressions on her own nose, indicating that she also was a habitual glasses wearer, even though she chose not to wear her glasses in court. Juror 8 remarks that the witness, who was trying to sleep when she saw the killing, would not have had glasses on or the time to put them on, making her story questionable. Jurors 4, 10 and 12 all change their votes, leaving Juror 3 as the sole dissenter.

Juror 3 vehemently and desperately tries to convince the others of his argument, but realizes that his strained relationship with his own son makes him wish the defendant guilty. He breaks down in tears and changes his vote to &quot;not guilty&quot;. As the others leave, Juror 8 graciously helps Juror 3 put on his coat. The defendant is acquitted off-screen. As the jurors leave the courthouse, Jurors 8 and 9 reveal their surnames to each other before parting ways.

==Cast==

Other, uncredited actors in the film include Rudy Bond as the Judge, Tom Gorman as the court Stenographer, James Kelly as the Bailiff, Billy Nelson as the Clerk, and John Savoca as the Defendant.

==Themes==
Professor of Law Emeritus at UCLA School of Law Michael Asimow referred to the film as a &quot;tribute to a common man holding out against lynch mob mentality&quot;. Gavin Smith of &quot;Film Comment&quot; called the film &quot;a definitive rebuttal to the lynch mob hysteria of the McCarthy era&quot;.

Business academic Phil Rosenzweig called the jury in &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; being made up entirely of white men &quot;especially important&quot;, writing: &quot;Many of the twelve would have looked around the room, and, seeing other white men, assumed that they had much in common and should be able to reach a verdict without difficulty. As they deliberate, however, fault lines begin to appear—by age, by education, by national origin, by socioeconomic level, by values, and by temperament.&quot;

==Production==
===Development===
Reginald Rose&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;, titled &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot;, was initially produced for television and was inspired by a jury summons. Although it is unclear what trial he was summoned to, according to Rose, in early 1954, he served as a juror on a manslaughter case in the New York Court of General Sessions. Though he and the other eleven jurors initially attended begrudgingly, Rose was deeply affected by the impassioned and deliberate atmosphere of the trial and the finality of his and the jury&#x27;s verdict. Rose began writing &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot; upon realizing that very few people knew what occurred during jury deliberations and that they could serve as an exciting setting for a drama. While writing the screenplay, Rose cut planned passages of dialogue to account for a fifty-minute time slot on television, leading to the characters to be less nuanced. A live production of &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot;, directed by Franklin Schaffner and starring Robert Cummings as Juror 8 and Franchot Tone as Juror 3, was broadcast on the CBS program &quot;Westinghouse Studio One&quot; in September 20, 1954 to positive reviews. It received four nominations for the 7th Primetime Emmy Awards, winning three on March 7, 1955: &quot;Best Actor in a Single Performance&quot;, &quot;Best Direction&quot;, and &quot;Best Written Dramatic Material&quot;.

In February 1955, actor Henry Fonda formed Orion Productions under a three-year deal with distributor United Artists. He reportedly first saw &quot;Westinghouse Studio One&quot; &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot; as a kinescope in a Hollywood projection room following its success in the 7th Primetime Emmy Awards. He was impressed with the story and wanted to star as Juror 8. In mid-1956, Fonda partnered with Rose to produce a film adaptation of &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;. As part of the partnership, Rose formed Nova Productions and combined it with Fonda&#x27;s Orion Productions to form Orion-Nova Productions, and production of the film was budgeted at $340,000. To develop the screenplay and characters, Rose restored material he had cut for the broadcast and added dialogue that revealed character&#x27;s backgrounds and motivations.

Fonda and Rose recruited Sidney Lumet to direct &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;, his film directorial debut. Lumet had previously directed numerous episodes, including adaptations of Rose&#x27;s plays, for TV series such as &quot;Danger&quot; and &quot;You Are There&quot;. Fonda said he hired Lumet because of his proficient directing skills and because he was &quot;wonderful with actors&quot;. Lumet recruited Boris Kaufman as the cinematographer. Kaufman had recently won Academy Award for Best Cinematography for &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954), and Lumet believed Kaufman&#x27;s &quot;realist style&quot; suited the film.

===Filming===
The film was shot in New York and completed after a short but rigorous rehearsal schedule, in less than three weeks, on a budget of $337,000 (). Rose and Fonda took salary deferrals. Faith Hubley, later to be known for her Oscar-winning animated efforts with spouse John, was script supervisor for this film.

At the beginning of the film, the cameras are positioned above eye level and mounted with wide-angle lenses, to give the appearance of greater depth between subjects, but as the film progresses the focal length of the lenses is gradually increased. By the end of the film, nearly everyone is shown in closeup, using telephoto lenses from a lower angle, which decreases or &quot;shortens&quot; depth of field. Lumet stated that his intention in using these techniques with cinematographer Boris Kaufman was to create a nearly palpable claustrophobia.

==Reception==
The film was a box office disappointment in the US but did better internationally. The advent of color and widescreen productions may have contributed to its disappointing box office performance. It was not until its first airing on television that the film finally found its audience.

=== Favorable response ===
On its first release, &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; received critical acclaim. A. H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;It makes for taut, absorbing, and compelling drama that reaches far beyond the close confines of its jury room setting.&quot; His observation of the twelve men was that &quot;their dramas are powerful and provocative enough to keep a viewer spellbound.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it an &quot;absorbing drama&quot; with acting that was &quot;perhaps the best seen recently in any single film&quot;, Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; declared it a &quot;tour de force in movie making&quot;, &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; deemed it &quot;a compelling and outstandingly well-handled drama&quot;, and John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;a fairly substantial addition to the celluloid landscape&quot;.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Variety&quot; noted: &quot;Perhaps the motivations of each juror are introduced too quickly and are repeated too often before each changes his vote. However, the film leaves a tremendous impact.&quot;

In 2012, Mike D&#x27;Angelo of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; questioned the verdict of the jury in the film, writing: &quot;What ensures The Kid&#x27;s guilt for practical purposes, [...] is the sheer improbability that &quot;all&quot; the evidence is erroneous. You&#x27;d have to be the jurisprudential inverse of a national lottery winner to face so many apparently damning coincidences and misidentifications. Or you&#x27;d have to be framed, which is what Johnnie Cochran was ultimately forced to argue—not just because of the DNA evidence, but because there&#x27;s no other plausible explanation for why every single detail points to O. J. Simpson&#x27;s guilt. But there&#x27;s no reason offered in &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; for why, say, the police would be planting switchblades.&quot;

== Legacy ==
The film is viewed as a classic, highly regarded from both a critical and popular viewpoint: Roger Ebert listed it as one of his &quot;Great Movies&quot;. The American Film Institute named Juror 8, played by Henry Fonda, 28th in a list of the 50 greatest movie heroes of the 20th century. AFI also named &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; the 42nd-most inspiring film, the 88th-most heart-pounding film and the 87th-best film of the past hundred years. In 2011, the film was one of the top 20 most screened films in secondary schools in the United Kingdom. , the film holds a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 61 reviews, with a weighted average of 9.10/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Sidney Lumet&#x27;s feature debut is a superbly written, dramatically effective courtroom thriller that rightfully stands as a modern classic&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==
The film was selected as the second-best courtroom drama ever by the American Film Institute during their AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 list, just after &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, and is the highest rated courtroom drama on Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; Top 100 Movies of All Time.

==Legal analyses==
Speaking at a screening of the film during the 2010 Fordham University School of Law Film Festival, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that seeing &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; while she was in college influenced her decision to pursue a career in law. She was particularly inspired by immigrant Juror 11&#x27;s monologue on his reverence for the American justice system. She also told the audience of law students that, as a lower-court judge, she would sometimes instruct juries to not follow the film&#x27;s example, because most of the jurors&#x27; conclusions are based on speculation, not fact. Sotomayor noted that events such as Juror 8 entering a similar knife into the proceeding; performing outside research into the case matter in the first place; and ultimately the jury as a whole making broad, wide-ranging assumptions far beyond the scope of reasonable doubt (such as the inferences regarding the woman wearing glasses) would not be allowed in a real-life jury situation, and in fact would have yielded a mistrial (assuming that applicable law permitted the content of jury deliberations to be revealed).

In 2007, legal scholar Michael Asimow argued that the jury in &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; reached an incorrect verdict, writing that the amount of circumstantial evidence against the defendant should have been enough to convict him, even if the testimony of the two eyewitnesses was disregarded.

In 2007, drawing on empirical research, legal scholar Valerie Hans noted that while &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;&#x27;s depiction of a lone dissenter converting the majority is rare in reality, the film accurately portrays how quality deliberation, diverse perspectives, and the unanimity requirement can enable thoughtful dissenters to meaningfully influence jury outcomes, particularly when arguing for acquittal.

==Adaptations and parodies==
There have been a number of adaptations of &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; owing to its popularity and legacy.

A 1963 German TV production, &quot;Die zwölf Geschworenen&quot;, was directed by Günter Gräwert, and a 1973 Spanish production, &quot; Doce hombres sin piedad&quot;, was made for TV 22 years before Spain allowed jury trials, while a 1991 homage by Kōki Mitani, (&quot;12 gentle Japanese&quot;), posits a Japan with a jury system and features a group of Japanese people grappling with their responsibility in the face of Japanese cultural norms.

A 1970 episode of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; television series (also co-starring Jack Klugman) entitled &quot;The Jury Story&quot; is reminiscent of &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;, as it tells in a flashback the circumstances behind the meeting of roommates Oscar Madison and Felix Unger. Klugman (Madison) plays a juror on a panel during a supposedly open-and-shut case. Co-star Tony Randall (Unger) portrays the lone holdout who votes not guilty, eventually convincing the other eleven jurors.

A 1978 episode of &quot;Happy Days&quot; entitled &quot;Fonzie for the Defense&quot; contains a situation similar to &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; when Howard Cunningham and Fonzie find themselves the only members of the jury who are not ready to convict the defendant just because he rides a motorcycle.

A 1986 episode of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; entitled &quot;Trial by Error&quot; pays tribute to &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;. The major twists are originally 10 jurors vote for &quot;not guilty&quot; due to self defense, Jessica votes &quot;unsure&quot; and another juror votes &quot;guilty&quot;. Jessica and other jurors recall the evidence, as more and more jurors switch from &quot;not guilty due to self defense&quot; and come to a realization as to what actually occurred the night of the murder.

The 1986 Hindi film (&quot;a pending decision&quot;) and 2012 Kannada film (&quot;ten faces&quot;) are Indian remakes of the film, with almost identical storylines. The former has been adapted as another Indian Bengali film &quot;Shotyi Bole Shotyi Kichhu Nei&quot; and is set to be released in 2025.

Season 1, episode 17a of the Nickelodeon cartoon &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; (1996) is a parody of &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;. In the episode, titled &quot;False Alarm&quot;, Eugene is suspected and accused of pulling the fire alarm, and a student jury is assembled to vote on the verdict, but Arnold is the only one who believes Eugene is innocent. He has to convince the rest of his classmates that Eugene is not guilty of the crime. In this adaptation, it is proven that Eugene was not the criminal but Curly a member of the student &quot;jury&quot; is the actual perpetrator due to the latter&#x27;s reaction to the former&#x27;s use of the Winkyland pencil (chewing on the eraser and intense sharpening).

In 1997, a television remake of the film under the same title was directed by William Friedkin and produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In the newer version, the judge is a woman, four of the jurors are black, and the ninth juror is not the only senior citizen, but the overall plot remains intact. Modernizations include not smoking in the jury room, changes in references to pop culture and sports figures and income, references to execution by lethal injection as opposed to the electric chair, more race-related dialogue, and casual profanity.

The detective drama television show &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, which like the film includes the theme of class issues, featured a 2005 episode, &quot;One Angry Veronica&quot;, in which the title character is selected for jury duty. The episode flips the film&#x27;s format and depicts one holdout convincing the jury to convict the privileged defendants of assault against a less well-off victim, despite their lawyers initially convincing 11 jury members of a not guilty verdict.

Russian director Nikita Mikhalkov also made a 2007 Academy Award-nominated adaptation, &quot;12&quot;, featuring a Chechen teen on trial in Moscow.

A 2015 Chinese adaptation, &quot;12 Citizens&quot;, follows the plot of the original 1957 American film, while including characters reflecting contemporary Beijing society, including a cab driver, guard, businessman, policeman, a retiree persecuted in a 1950s political movement, and others.

&quot;Juror 8&quot; is a 2019 South Korean adaptation, directed by Hong Seung-wan.

The film has also been subject to parody. In 2015, the Comedy Central TV series &quot;Inside Amy Schumer&quot; aired a half-hour parody of the film titled &quot;12 Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer&quot;.

The film was also parodied in the BBC Television comedy &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, starring Tony Hancock and Sid James, and written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, in the episode broadcast on October 16, 1959. &quot;Family Guy&quot; paid tribute to the film with its Season 11 episode titled &quot;12 and a Half Angry Men&quot;, and &quot;King of the Hill&quot; acknowledged the film with their parody &quot;Nine Pretty Darn Angry Men&quot; in season 3.

The American adult animated sitcom, &quot;Krapopolis&quot; also parodied the film in the fifth episode of its first season, titled &quot;12 Angry Goat Herders&quot;. In it, Tyrannis invents the court system after Shlub is accused of eating the goats of the goat farmers. Tyrannis represented Shlub while the goat farmers were represented by Brenda the Sphinx.

<text>Witness for the Prosecution is a 1957 American legal mystery thriller film directed by Billy Wilder and starring Tyrone Power, Marlene Dietrich, Charles Laughton, and Elsa Lanchester. The film, which has elements of bleak black comedy and film noir, is a courtroom drama set in the Old Bailey in London and is based on the 1953 play of the same title by Agatha Christie. The first film adaptation of Christie&#x27;s story, &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; was adapted for the screen by Larry Marcus, Harry Kurnitz, and Wilder. The film was acclaimed by critics and received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. It also received five Golden Globes nominations including a win for Elsa Lanchester as Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Additionally, the film was selected as the sixth-best courtroom drama ever by the American Film Institute for their &quot;AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10&quot; list.

In the film, a man accused of killing a wealthy widow who had named him as the main beneficiary in her will undergoes a trial during which his wife testifies against him.

==Plot==
Senior barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts, who is nearing retirement after suffering from a heart attack, agrees to defend Leonard Vole over the objections of Robarts&#x27; private nurse Miss Plimsoll, Sir Wilfrid&#x27;s doctor having warned against taking on stressful criminal cases. Vole is accused of murdering Emily French, a wealthy, childless widow who had fallen in love with him and named him as the main beneficiary in her will.

When Sir Wilfrid speaks with Vole&#x27;s German wife Christine, he finds her cold and self-possessed, but she does provide an alibi, although it is not entirely convincing. During the trial in the Old Bailey, the Crown introduces testimony that Mrs. French had seen Vole with a younger woman and planned to confront him, but Sir Wilfrid believes his client to be innocent. He is shocked when Christine is called to give evidence against Vole as a prosecution witness.

While a wife cannot be compelled to testify against her husband, it is revealed in court that her marriage to Vole is invalid, as she was already married to another man, Otto Helm, who is still alive and living in Germany. She states that she never loved Leonard, and her conscience compels her to tell the truth. She explains that she had gone through a ceremony of marriage with Leonard, a Royal Air Force officer serving in Berlin&#x27;s British occupation zone, solely to escape from Soviet-controlled territory to the West. According to her testimony, Leonard confessed that after being confronted by Mrs. French, he had killed her to avoid being disinherited from her will.

Now fearing that his client must inevitably be convicted and sentenced to hang, Sir Wilfrid is unexpectedly and fortuitously contacted by a woman who offers to sell him letters written by Christine to a lover named Max. The handwriting is genuine, and the woman has a legitimate reason for providing the letters: she had been attacked and her face disfigured by her lover. During cross examination, Sir Wilfred reads the letters, which disclose a conspiracy between Max and Christine to frame Leonard. The jury acquits Leonard of murder, much to the crowd&#x27;s delight.

Sir Wilfrid is troubled, and his worries prove justified when Christine, brought into the courtroom for safety after being assailed by the departing crowd, tells him what she had done to secure the acquittal. After Sir Wilfrid had told Christine before the trial that an alibi contributed by a loving wife would not be believed by a jury, she had posed as a hateful, double-crossing wife. She also wrote letters to a non-existent lover and played the disfigured woman who gave Sir Wilfred the same letters, in order to discredit her own testimony. Christine now says that she loves Leonard, but knew all along that he was guilty. Christine has actually told the &quot;truth&quot; about the murder in the witness-box: Leonard did, in fact, confess to her.

Leonard, having overheard Christine, gleefully boasts that he had indeed manipulated and murdered Mrs. French. Sir Wilfrid, who had sincerely believed in his client’s innocence, is outraged. However, due to English double jeopardy laws, no further legal action can be taken against Leonard.

Leonard announces that he really has been having an affair with the much younger woman seen by Mrs. French, for whom he now plans to abandon Christine. He smugly states that though Christine will now be tried for perjury, he and she are now even, as they both saved each other&#x27;s lives. A devastated Christine grabs a knife and stabs Leonard, killing him. As she is arrested, Sir Wilfrid decides to further delay his retirement to serve as Christine Vole&#x27;s defence counsel, stating that what she did was to execute Leonard. 

==Cast==

===Uncredited===
==Production==
Producers Arthur Hornblow and Edward Small bought the rights to the play for $450,000. The play was adjusted to emphasize the character of the defence barrister. Billy Wilder was signed to direct in April 1956. According to Wilder, when the producers approached Marlene Dietrich about the part, she accepted on the condition that Wilder direct. Wilder said that Dietrich liked &quot;to play a murderess&quot; but was &quot;a little bit embarrassed when playing the love scenes.&quot;

Vivien Leigh was considered for the role of Christine Vole. Laughton based his performance on Florance Guedella, his own lawyer, an Englishman who was known for twirling his monocle while cross-examining witnesses.

In a flashback showing how Leonard and Christine first meet in a German nightclub, she is wearing her trademark trousers, made famous by Dietrich in director Josef von Sternberg’s film &quot;Morocco&quot; (1930). A rowdy customer rips them down one side, revealing one of Dietrich&#x27;s renowned legs and starting a brawl. The scene required 145 extras and 38 stuntmen, and cost $90,000. The bar is called Die blaue Laterne (), which is a reference to Dietrich&#x27;s famous film &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;.

==United Artists&#x27; &quot;surprise ending&quot;==

At the end of the film, as the credits roll, a voiceover announces:

This was in keeping with the advertising campaign for the film. One of the posters said: &quot;You&#x27;ll talk about it! - but please don&#x27;t tell the ending!&quot;

The effort to keep the ending a secret extended to the cast. Billy Wilder did not allow the actors to view the final ten pages of the script until it was time to shoot those scenes. The secrecy reportedly cost Marlene Dietrich an Academy Award, as United Artists did not want to call attention to the fact that Dietrich was practically unrecognizable as the Cockney woman who hands over the incriminating letters to the defense.

==Reception==
In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Bosley Crowther wrote: &quot;... [T]here&#x27;s never a dull or worthless moment. It&#x27;s all parry and punch from the word &#x27;Go!&#x27;, which is plainly announced when the accused man is brought to Mr. Laughton at the beginning of the film. And the air in the courtroom fairly crackles with emotional electricity, until that staggering surprise in the last reel. Then the whole drama explodes. It&#x27;s the staging of the scenes that is important in this rapidly moving film ... It&#x27;s the balancing of well-marked characters, the shifts of mood, the changes of pace and the interesting bursts of histrionics that the various actors display.&quot;

Agatha Christie &quot;herself considered it the finest film derived from one of her stories.&quot; It currently holds a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 40 reviews with an average rating of 8.7/10. In &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s review of the film, it received four and a half stars out of five, the writer saying that &quot;&quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; is a witty, terse adaptation of the Agatha Christie hit play brought to the screen with ingenuity and vitality by Billy Wilder.&quot;

The American Film Institute included the film in AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 at #6 in the courtroom-drama category.

===Box Office===
The film reached number one at the American box office for two consecutive weeks in February and March 1958.

It earned $3.75 million in its first year.

===Accolades===
==Home media==
&quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; was released on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on December 11, 2001 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD, and by Kino Lorber (under license from MGM) on Blu-ray on July 22, 2014 as a Region 1 widescreen disc.

<text>Waterloo () is a London Underground station located beneath Waterloo National Rail station. As of , it is the station on the London Underground, with million users. It is served by four lines: Bakerloo, Jubilee, Northern and Waterloo &amp; City.

The station is situated in fare zone 1 and is located near the South Bank of the River Thames, in the London Borough of Lambeth. It is within walking distance of the London Eye.

==History==

The first Underground Line at Waterloo was opened on 8 August 1898 by the Waterloo &amp; City Railway (W&amp;CR), a subsidiary of the owners of the main line station, the London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR). The W&amp;CR, nicknamed &quot;The Drain&quot;, achieved in a limited way the L&amp;SWR&#x27;s original plan of taking its tracks the short distance north-east into the City of London.

On 10 March 1906, the Baker Street &amp; Waterloo Railway (now the Bakerloo line) was opened. On 13 September 1926, the extension of the Hampstead &amp; Highgate line (as the Charing Cross branch of the Northern line was then known) was opened from Embankment to the existing City and South London Railway station at Kennington with a new station at Waterloo.

As a subsidiary of the L&amp;SWR and its successor, the Southern Railway, the W&amp;CR was not a part of the London Underground system. Following nationalisation of the main line railway companies in 1948, it became part of British Railways (later British Rail).

In 1951, the Leslie Green designed York Road entrance of the Underground station was demolished and replaced by a new temporary entrance on the other side of the road, part of the Festival of Britain site. As part of this work, the escalators were built this new entrance, replacing lifts. This entrance also served the Waterloo Air Terminal. In the early 1960s, a permanent entrance building was built, integrated into the Shell Centre complex.

In March 1965, a British Rail and London Transport joint planning committee published &quot;A Railway Plan for London&quot; that included a recommendation to revive a plan from the 1900s for an extension of the Piccadilly line&#x27;s Aldwych branch to Waterloo. London Transport had already sought parliamentary approval to construct tunnels from Aldwych to Waterloo in November 1964, and in August 1965, parliamentary powers were granted. Detailed planning took place, although public spending cuts led to postponement of the scheme in 1967 before tenders were invited.

=== 1990s refurbishment ===
The Underground station was comprehensively refurbished in the early 1990s as part of the construction of Waterloo International station for international Eurostar services, with the Main Ticket hall underneath the railway concourse expanded and connected to the new International station. The platforms were also decorated with artwork by Christopher Tipping on the theme of the nearby National Theatre, although these murals have since been removed.

The Waterloo &amp; City line was closed for 2 months in 1993 to be upgraded with new trains and the four rail electrical system of the London Underground. The ownership of the line was transferred from Network SouthEast to the Underground on 1 April 1994 as part of the privatisation of British Rail. Due to an Easter shut-down, the first Underground service on the line was on 5 April 1994.

=== Jubilee Line extension ===
The Jubilee Line Extension was constructed in the 1990s to extend the Jubilee line from Green Park to Stratford, via the then new Canary Wharf development. Opening in September 1999, the new Jubilee line station was designed by in-house JLE Project Architects, overseen by Roland Paoletti.

The design of the station was complex, due to the distance between the existing Bakerloo and Northern lines and the extension - as well as the railway station located above. To connect the station together, a moving walkway link was installed, one of only two on the Underground; the other gives access to the Waterloo &amp; City line platform at Bank station. The colonnade on Waterloo Road underneath the taxi cab road of the station - originally used for goods deliveries and a bus stand - was also repurposed as the new Jubilee line ticket hall.

The station was temporarily the western terminus of the extension running from Stratford in east London, before the final section to link the extension to the original line was opened between Waterloo and Green Park on 20 November 1999.

There is a westwards-facing crossover to the west of the Jubilee line platforms to enable trains from Stanmore to terminate and turn around head back west.

A sculpture of an Elephant by artist Kendra Haste is located between the escalators in the Colonnade Ticket Hall. The sculpture was purchased by London Underground, having been originally commissioned in 2000 as part of its Platform for Art programme and set up at Gloucester Road tube station.

=== Southbank Place ===
As part of the redevelopment of the Shell Centre into &quot;Southbank Place&quot; by Canary Wharf Group and Qatari Diar, the existing York Road entrance was closed in 2015 to be completely rebuilt. The new, larger York Road entrance, which also included an additional escalator - reopened in May 2019.

== Ticket halls ==
The station has 3 ticket halls and 5 main entrances. Additional entrances to the Underground station are available in peak hours via a subway underneath the railway station from station platforms.

* Main Ticket Hall, located underneath the railway concourse.
* Colonnade/Jubilee Line Ticket Hall, located at street level on Waterloo Road, underneath the cab road of the railway station. This ticket hall opened in 1999 as part of the Jubilee Line Extension.
* York Road Ticket Hall, located at street level on York Road in the Southbank Place development, to the west of the railway station.

The three ticket halls are connected via escalators, passageways and the moving walkway to the four sets of platforms.

== Elizabeth House ==
Elizabeth House, located directly adjacent to the mainline railway station, is being redeveloped by HB Reavis. As part of this redevelopment, a lift shaft will be constructed to provide step free access to the Northern line.

==Connections==
The station is served by London Buses daytime, express and night routes.
