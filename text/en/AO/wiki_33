<text>William Rufus DeVane King (April 7, 1786 – April 18, 1853) was an American politician and diplomat. He was the 13th vice president of the United States from March 4 until his death in April 1853. Earlier he had served as a U.S. representative from North Carolina and a senator from Alabama. He also served as minister to France under President James K. Polk.

A Democrat, he was a Unionist and his contemporaries considered him to be a moderate on the issues of sectionalism, slavery, and westward expansion, which contributed to the American Civil War. He helped draft the Compromise of 1850. He is the only United States vice president to take the oath of office on foreign soil; he was inaugurated in Cuba, due to his poor health. He died of tuberculosis 45 days later, becoming the third vice president to die in office. Only John Tyler and Andrew Johnson, both of whom succeeded to the presidency, have had shorter tenures. King was the only U.S. vice president from Alabama.

== Early life ==

King was born in Sampson County, North Carolina, to William King and Margaret DeVane. His family was large, wealthy, and well-connected. He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1803, where he was also a member of the Philanthropic Society. William Alexander Graham, whom King would later oppose in the election of 1852, attended the university at the same time (Graham was a member of the rival Dialectic Society). Admitted to the bar in 1806 after reading the law with Judge William Duffy of Fayetteville, North Carolina, he began practice in Clinton. King was an ardent Freemason and was a member of Fayetteville&#x27;s Phoenix Lodge No. 8.

==Political career==

King entered politics and was elected as a member of the North Carolina House of Commons, where he served from 1807 to 1809, and he became city solicitor of Wilmington, North Carolina, in 1810. He was elected to the Twelfth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Congresses, serving from March 4, 1811, until November 4, 1816, when he resigned to become Secretary of the Legation for William Pinkney during Pinkney&#x27;s appointment as Minister to Russia and to a special diplomatic mission in Naples. King was only 24 years old when he became a congressman for the first time. He did not reach the constitutional age of 25 for service in the House of Representatives until after the term began, but the Twelfth Congress did not convene until November 4, 1811, and King was not sworn in until then.

When he returned to the United States in 1818, King joined the westward migration of the cotton culture to the Deep South, purchasing property at what would later be known as &quot;King&#x27;s Bend&quot; between present-day Selma and Cahaba on the Alabama River in Dallas County of the new Alabama Territory, which had been recently separated from Mississippi. He developed a large cotton plantation based on slave labor, calling the property &quot;Chestnut Hill&quot;. King and his relatives formed one of the state&#x27;s largest slaveholding families, collectively owning as many as 500 people.

William Rufus King was a delegate to the convention that organized the Alabama state government. Upon the admission of Alabama as the twenty-second state in 1819, he was elected by the State Legislature as a Democratic-Republican to the United States Senate.

King was a follower of Andrew Jackson, and was re-elected to the Senate as a Jacksonian in 1822, 1828, 1834, and 1841, serving from December 14, 1819, until his resignation on April 15, 1844. During this time, in March–April 1824, William R. King was honored with a single vote at the Democratic-Republican Party caucus to be the party&#x27;s candidate for the office of vice president of the United States in the upcoming 1824 presidential election. Later, he served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate during the 24th through 27th Congresses. King was Chairman of the Senate&#x27;s Committee on Public Lands and the Committee on Commerce.

He was appointed Minister to France and served from 1844 to 1846. After his return, King resumed serving in the Senate and was appointed and subsequently elected to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Arthur P. Bagby. He held his seat from July 1, 1848, until his resignation on December 20, 1852, because of ill health and his having been elected vice president of the United States.

During the conflicts leading up to the Compromise of 1850, King supported the Senate&#x27;s gag rule against debate on antislavery petitions and opposed proposals to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, which Congress administered. King supported a pro-slavery position, arguing that the Constitution protected the institution of slavery in both the Southern states and the federal territories. He opposed both the abolitionists&#x27; efforts to abolish slavery in the territories as well as the Fire-Eaters&#x27; calls for Southern secession.

On July 11, 1850, two days after the death of President Zachary Taylor, King was appointed Senate President pro tempore. Because Millard Fillmore ascended to the presidency, the vice presidency was vacant, making King first in the line of succession under the law then in effect. He also served as Chairman of the Senate&#x27;s Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Pensions.

== Relationship with James Buchanan ==

The claim for King&#x27;s homosexuality has been put forward by biographer Jean Baker. It has been supported (to an extent) by Shelley Ross, James W. Loewen, and Robert P. Watson. It focuses essentially on his close and intimate relationship with President James Buchanan. The two men lived together for 13 years, from 1840 until King&#x27;s death in 1853. Buchanan referred to the relationship as a &quot;communion&quot;, and the two often attended official functions together. Contemporaries also noted and commented on the unusual closeness. Andrew Jackson mockingly called them &quot;Miss Nancy&quot; and &quot;Aunt Fancy&quot; (the former being a 19th-century euphemism for an effeminate man), while Representative Aaron V. Brown referred to King as Buchanan&#x27;s &quot;better half&quot;.

However, historian Lewis Saum has pointed out, &quot;Customs and expressions were different in the mid-1800s than they are today... &quot;Miss Nancy&quot; was &quot;a fairly common designation for people who wore clean clothes and had good manners&quot;. He also noted that Aaron Brown was a political rival of King.

Loewen has described Buchanan and King as &quot;Siamese twins&quot;. Sol Barzman, a biographer of vice presidents, wrote that King&#x27;s &quot;fastidious habits and conspicuous intimacy with the bachelor Buchanan gave rise to some cruel jibes.&quot; Buchanan adopted King&#x27;s mannerisms and romanticized southern culture. Both had strong political ambitions, and in 1844, they planned to run as president and vice president. They spent some time apart while King was on overseas missions in France, and their letters remain cryptic and avoid revealing any personal feelings at all. In May 1844, Buchanan wrote to Cornelia Roosevelt: I am now &#x27;solitary and alone,&#x27; having no companion in the house with me. I have gone a wooing to several gentlemen, but have not succeeded with any one of them. I feel that it is not good for man to be alone, and [I] should not be astonished to find myself married to some old maid who can nurse me when I am sick, provide good dinners for me when I am well, and not expect from me any very ardent or romantic affection. After King died in 1853, Buchanan described him as &quot;among the best, the purest, and most consistent public men I have known.&quot;

Baker concluded that while some of their correspondence was destroyed by family members, the length and intimacy of the surviving letters illustrate &quot;the affection of a special friendship&quot; between King and Buchanan, with no way to know for certain whether it was a romantic relationship.

== Vice presidency and death (1853) ==
The 1852 Democratic National Convention was held at the Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts Hall in Baltimore. Franklin Pierce was nominated for president, and King was nominated for vice president.
Pierce and King defeated the Whig candidates, Winfield Scott and William Alexander Graham. Because King was ill with tuberculosis and had traveled to Cuba in an effort to regain his health, he was not able to be in Washington to take his oath of office on March 4, 1853. By a special Act of Congress passed on March 2, he was allowed to take the oath outside the United States, and was sworn in on March 24, 1853, near Matanzas, Cuba, by the U.S. consul to Cuba, William L. Sharkey. King is the first and, to date, only vice president or president of the United States to take the oath of office on foreign soil.

Shortly afterward, King made the journey to return to Chestnut Hill. He died within two days of his arrival on April 18, 1853, aged 67, of tuberculosis. He was interred in a vault on the plantation and later reburied in Selma&#x27;s Old Live Oak Cemetery. King never carried out any duties of the office.

Following King&#x27;s death, the office of vice president was vacant until John C. Breckinridge was inaugurated with President James Buchanan in March 1857.

== Legacy and honors==

* In 1852, the Oregon Territorial Legislature named King County for him. King County became part of Washington Territory when it was created the following year, and then part of the State of Washington in 1889. In 1985, the King County government amended its designation and its logo to honor instead the late national Civil Rights Movement leader Martin Luther King Jr.. The change was made official April 19, 2005, when Governor Christine Gregoire signed into law Senate Bill 5332, effective July 24, 2005.
* The King Residence Quadrangle at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, his alma mater, is named for him.
** An 1830 portrait of King is held at New East Hall in the Philanthropic Chambers of the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies, a debating society which he had joined during college.
* King was a co-founder of Selma, Alabama, which he named after the Ossianic poem &quot;The Songs of Selma&quot;. After his death, city officials and some of King&#x27;s family wanted to move his body to Selma. Other family members wanted his body to remain at Chestnut Hill. In 1882, the Selma City Council appointed a committee to select a new plot for King&#x27;s body. His remains were then reinterred in the city&#x27;s Live Oak Cemetery under a white marble mausoleum erected by the city.

<doc id="89138" wikidata="Q919020" url="?curid=89138" title="Gary Larson">
<text>Gary Larson (born August 14, 1950) is an American cartoonist who created &quot;The Far Side&quot;, a single-panel cartoon series that was syndicated internationally to more than 1,900 newspapers for fifteen years. The series ended on January 1, 1995, though since 2020 Larson has published additional comics online. His twenty-three books of collected cartoons have combined sales of more than forty-five million copies.

==Early life and education==
Larson was born and raised in University Place, Washington, in suburban Tacoma, the son of Verner, a car salesman, and Doris, a secretary. He graduated from Curtis Senior High School in University Place and from Washington State University in Pullman with a degree in communications. During high school and college, he played jazz guitar and banjo.

Larson said his family has &quot;a morbid sense of humor&quot;, and that he was influenced by the &quot;paranoid&quot; sense of humor of his older brother, Dan. Dan played pranks on Gary, for example by taking advantage of his fear of monsters under the bed by waiting in the closet for the right moment to pounce. Dan &quot;scared the hell out of me&quot; whenever he could, Gary said, but Dan also nurtured Gary&#x27;s love of scientific knowledge. They caught animals in Puget Sound and placed them in terrariums in the basement, and also made a small desert ecosystem.

== Personal life ==
In 1987, Larson married Toni Carmichael, an anthropologist. Early in their relationship, Carmichael became his business manager.

In &quot;The Complete Far Side&quot;, Larson says that his greatest disappointment in life occurred when he was at a luncheon and sat across from cartoonist Charles Addams, creator of &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. Larson was not able to think of a single thing to say to him and deeply regretted the missed opportunity. Addams died in 1988.

Larson is an environmentalist. &quot;Protecting wildlife is &#x27;at the top of my list&#x27;, he says.&quot; Larson lives in Seattle, Washington.

==Career==

===Early cartoon work===
According to Larson in his 1989 anthology &quot;The Prehistory of The Far Side&quot;, he was working in a music store when he took a few days off, after finally realizing how much he hated his job. During that time, he decided to try cartooning. In 1976, he drew six cartoons and submitted them to &quot;Pacific Search&quot; (afterward &quot;Pacific Northwest Magazine&quot;), a Seattle-based magazine. After contributing to another local Seattle paper, in 1979 Larson submitted his work to &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;. Under the title &quot;Nature&#x27;s Way&quot;, his work was published weekly next to the &quot;Junior Jumble&quot;.

To supplement his income, Larson worked for the Humane Society as a cruelty investigator.

===&quot;The Far Side&quot;===

Larson decided that he could increase his income from cartooning by selling his &quot;Nature&#x27;s Way&quot; strip to another newspaper. While on vacation in San Francisco, he pitched his work to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; and, to his surprise, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; bought the strip and promoted it for syndication, renaming it &quot;The Far Side&quot;. Its first appearance in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; was on January 1, 1980. A week later, &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; dropped &quot;Nature&#x27;s Way&quot;. Unlike Charles Schulz, who resented the name &quot;Peanuts&quot; imposed by his publisher, Larson had no such qualms, saying, &quot;They could have called it &quot;Revenge of the Zucchini People&quot;, for all I cared.&quot;

&quot;The Far Side&quot; ran for fifteen years, syndicated initially by Chronicle Features and later by Universal Press Syndicate, until Larson retired with his final strip published on January 1, 1995.

Themes in &quot;The Far Side&quot; were often surreal. Often, the behavior of supposedly superior humans was compared with animals. For instance, a father explains to his son that a bird song is a territorial marking common to the lower animals, while surrounded by fences and dense housing. Animals and other creatures were frequently presented anthropomorphically. One strip depicts a family of spiders driving in a car with a &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; bumper sticker, featuring a smiley face with eight eyes.

One of Larson&#x27;s more famous cartoons shows a chimpanzee couple grooming. The female finds a blond human hair on the male and inquires, &quot;Conducting a little more &#x27;research&#x27; with that Jane Goodall tramp?&quot; A representative from the Jane Goodall Institute thought that this was in bad taste and wrote a critical letter to Larson regarding the cartoon. Larson contacted the Goodall Institute to apologize only to find that Jane Goodall, who had been in Africa at the time of the cartoon&#x27;s publication and only learned of it years after its initial publication, approved of it, stating that she found it amusing. Since then, all profits from sales of a shirt featuring this cartoon go to the Goodall Institute. Goodall wrote a preface to &quot;The Far Side Gallery 5&quot;, detailing her version of the &quot;Jane Goodall Tramp&quot; controversy. She praised Larson&#x27;s creative ideas, which often compare and contrast the behavior of humans and animals.

Larson&#x27;s &quot;The Far Side&quot; cartoons were syndicated worldwide and published in many collections. They were also reproduced extensively on greeting cards which were very popular, but these were discontinued in March 2009. Two animated versions were produced for television: &quot;Tales from the Far Side&quot; (1994) and &quot;Tales from the Far Side II&quot; (1997). A 2007 &quot;The Far Side&quot; calendar donated all author royalties to Conservation International.

The significance of many of Larson&#x27;s cartoons resulted in a major display of over 400 of his original works at the California Academy of Sciences in 1985.

=== Retirement ===
By late 1994, Larson thought the series was getting repetitive and did not want to enter what he called the &quot;Graveyard of Mediocre Cartoons.&quot; He retired the strip on January 1, 1995, when he was 44 years old. Since retiring from &quot;The Far Side&quot;, Larson has done occasional cartoon work, including magazine illustrations and promotional artwork for &quot;The Far Side&quot; merchandise. For the most part, he has also retired from public view: &quot;He refuses to have his picture taken and avoids being on TV&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote in 2003. To Larson, &quot;cartoonists are expected to be anonymous.&quot;

===&quot;There&#x27;s a Hair in My Dirt!: A Worm&#x27;s Story&quot;===
In 1998, Larson published his first post-&quot;The Far Side&quot; book &quot;There&#x27;s a Hair in My Dirt!: A Worm&#x27;s Story&quot;, an illustrated book with thematic similarities to &quot;The Far Side&quot;. The short book tells the story of an earthworm who feels that his life is insignificant. The main plot is told by the young worm&#x27;s father and follows the beautiful (but slightly dim) human maiden Harriet, who takes a stroll across a woodland trail, encountering different aspects of the ecological world. She admires it but knows little about the land around her, and that eventually leads to her downfall.

The story became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller on May 24, 1998.

===Other works and interests===
Larson has been playing jazz guitar since his teen years. He took advanced lessons from jazz guitarists Remo Palmier and Herb Ellis. In exchange for guitar lessons from Ellis, Larson provided him with the cover illustration for the album &quot;Doggin&#x27; Around&quot; (Concord, 1988) by Ellis and bassist Red Mitchell.

Larson drew a cover for the November 17, 2003, edition of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, an offer he felt was too prestigious to refuse.

Larson voices himself in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; 2010 episode &quot;Once Upon a Time in Springfield&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Larson was awarded the Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award by the National Cartoonists Society in 1985 and 1988, earned the society&#x27;s Reuben Award for 1990 and 1994, and has been recognized for various individual strips by the National Cartoonist Society in 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993 and 1995.
On March 15, 1989, a newly discovered insect species was named after Larson by Dale H. Clayton, head of the Committee of Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago. The &quot;Strigiphilus garylarsoni&quot; is a chewing louse of a genus found only on owls. Wrote Larson: &quot;I considered this an extreme honor. Besides, I knew no one was going to write and ask to name a new species of swan after me. You have to grab these opportunities when they come along.&quot; An 8&quot; × 11&quot; (20 × 28 cm) magnification of the insect appeared in the &quot;Prehistory of the Far Side&quot; 10th anniversary compilation, along with the letter requesting permission to use his name. Similarly, an Ecuadorian rainforest butterfly was named after him; &quot;Serratoterga larsoni&quot;. The term &quot;thagomizer&quot;, a feature of stegosaurus anatomy, was coined in a &quot;Far Side&quot; cartoon.

Eighteen years after earning his bachelor&#x27;s degree at Washington State, Larson gave the commencement address at his alma mater in 1990.

== Online presence ==
Since 1999, Larson has objected to his work being displayed on the internet, and has been sending takedown notices to owners of fan websites and users posting his cartoons. In a personal letter included with the requests, Larson claimed that his work is too personal and important to him to have others &quot;take control of it&quot;. In 2007, he also published an open letter on the web to the same effect.

In September 2019, &quot;The Far Side&quot; website stated that &quot;a new online era of the Far Side is coming!&quot; On December 17, 2019, www.thefarside.com, authorized by Larson, and dedicated to &quot;The Far Side&quot; cartoon series went live on the internet. On July 8, 2020, Larson released a new section of &quot;The Far Side&quot; website titled &quot;New Stuff&quot;.

<text>John Cabell Breckinridge (January 16, 1821 – May 17, 1875) was an American politician who served as the 14th vice president of the United States, with President James Buchanan, from 1857 to 1861. Assuming office at the age of 36, Breckinridge is the youngest vice president in U.S. history. Breckinridge was also the Southern Democratic candidate in the 1860 presidential election, which he lost to Republican Abraham Lincoln.

Breckinridge was born near Lexington, Kentucky, to a prominent local family. After serving as a noncombatant during the Mexican–American War, he was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1849, where he took a pro-slavery stance. Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1851, he allied with Stephen A. Douglas in support of the Kansas–Nebraska Act. After reapportionment in 1854 made his re-election unlikely, he declined to run for another term. He was nominated for vice president at the 1856 Democratic National Convention to balance a ticket headed by James Buchanan. The Democrats won the election, but Breckinridge had little influence with Buchanan, and as presiding officer of the Senate, could not express his opinions in debates. He joined Buchanan in supporting the proslavery Lecompton Constitution for Kansas, which led to a split in the Democratic Party. In 1859, he was elected to succeed Senator John J. Crittenden at the end of Crittenden&#x27;s term in 1861.

After Southern Democrats walked out of the 1860 Democratic National Convention, the party&#x27;s northern and southern factions held rival conventions in Baltimore that nominated Douglas and Breckinridge, respectively, for president. A third party, the Constitutional Union Party, nominated John Bell. These three men split the Southern vote, while antislavery Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln won all but three electoral votes in the North, winning the election. Breckinridge carried most of the Southern states. Taking his seat in the Senate, Breckinridge urged compromise to preserve the Union. Unionists were in control of the state legislature, and gained more support when Confederate forces moved into Kentucky. Breckinridge fled behind Confederate lines. He was commissioned a brigadier general and then expelled from the Senate.

Following the Battle of Shiloh in 1862, Breckinridge was promoted to major general, and in October, he was assigned to the Army of Mississippi under Braxton Bragg. After Bragg charged that Breckinridge&#x27;s drunkenness had contributed to defeats at Stones River and Missionary Ridge, and after Breckinridge joined many other high-ranking officers in criticizing Bragg, he was transferred to the Trans-Allegheny Department, where he won his most significant victory in the 1864 Battle of New Market. After participating in Jubal Early&#x27;s campaigns in the Shenandoah Valley, Breckinridge was charged with defending supplies in Tennessee and Virginia. In February 1865, Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed him secretary of war. Concluding that the war was hopeless, he urged Davis to arrange a national surrender. After the fall of Richmond, Breckinridge ensured the preservation of Confederate records. He then escaped the country and lived abroad for over three years. When President Andrew Johnson extended amnesty to all former Confederates in 1868, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky, but resisted all encouragement to resume his political career. War injuries sapped his health, and he died in 1875. Breckinridge is regarded as an effective military commander. Though well liked in Kentucky and other Southern states, he was reviled by many in the North as a traitor.

==Early life==
John Cabell Breckinridge was born at Thorn Hill, his family&#x27;s estate near Lexington, Kentucky, on January 16, 1821, the fourth of six children and only son of Joseph &quot;Cabell&quot; Breckinridge and Mary Clay (Smith) Breckinridge. His mother was the daughter of Samuel Stanhope Smith, who founded Hampden–Sydney College in 1775, and granddaughter of John Witherspoon, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Having previously served as speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives, Breckinridge&#x27;s father had been appointed Kentucky&#x27;s secretary of state just prior to his son&#x27;s birth. In February, one month after Breckinridge&#x27;s birth, the family moved with Governor John Adair to the Governor&#x27;s Mansion in Frankfort, so his father could better attend to his duties as secretary of state.

In August 1823, an illness referred to as &quot;the prevailing fever&quot; struck Frankfort, and Cabell Breckinridge took his children to stay with his mother in Lexington. On his return, both his wife and he fell ill. Cabell Breckinridge died, but she survived. His assets were not enough to pay his debts, and his widow joined the children in Lexington, supported by her mother-in-law. While in Lexington, Breckinridge attended Pisgah Academy in Woodford County. His grandmother taught him the political philosophies of her late husband, John Breckinridge, who served in the U.S. Senate and as attorney general under President Thomas Jefferson. As a state legislator, Breckinridge had introduced the Kentucky Resolutions in 1798, which stressed states&#x27; rights and endorsed the doctrine of nullification in response to the Alien and Sedition Acts.

After an argument between Breckinridge&#x27;s mother and grandmother in 1832, his mother, his sister Laetitia, and he moved to Danville, Kentucky, to live with his sister Frances and her husband, John C. Young, who was president of Centre College. Breckinridge&#x27;s uncle, William Breckinridge, was also on the faculty there, prompting him to enroll in November 1834. Among his schoolmates were Beriah Magoffin, William Birney, Theodore O&#x27;Hara, Thomas L. Crittenden, and Jeremiah Boyle. After earning a Bachelor of Arts in September 1838, he spent the following winter as a &quot;resident graduate&quot; at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). Returning to Kentucky in mid-1839, he read law with Judge William Owsley. In November 1840, he enrolled in the second year of the law course at Transylvania University in Lexington, where his instructors included George Robertson and Thomas A. Marshall of the Kentucky Court of Appeals. On February 25, 1841, he received a Bachelor of Laws and was licensed to practice the next day.

==Early legal career==
Breckinridge remained in Lexington while deciding where to begin practice, borrowing law books from the library of John J. Crittenden, Thomas Crittenden&#x27;s father. Deciding that Lexington was overcrowded with lawyers, he moved to Frankfort, but was unable to find an office. After being spurned by a love interest, former classmate Thomas W. Bullock and he departed for the Iowa Territory on October 10, 1841, seeking better opportunities. They considered settling on land Breckinridge had inherited in Jacksonville, Illinois, but they found the bar stocked with able men such as Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln. They continued on to Burlington, Iowa, and by the winter of 1842–1843, Breckinridge reported to family members that his firm handled more cases than almost any other in Burlington. Influenced by Bullock and the citizens of Iowa, he identified with the Democratic Party, and by February 1843, he had been named to the Democratic committee of Des Moines County. Most of the Kentucky Breckinridges were Whigs, and when he learned of his nephew&#x27;s party affiliation, William Breckinridge declared, &quot;I felt as I would have done if I had heard that my daughter had been dishonored.&quot;

Breckinridge visited Kentucky in May 1843. His efforts to mediate between his mother and the Breckinridges extended his visit, and after he contracted influenza, he decided to remain for the summer rather than returning to Iowa&#x27;s colder climate. He met Bullock&#x27;s cousin, Mary Cyrene Burch, and by September, they were engaged. In October, Breckinridge went to Iowa to close out his business, then returned to Kentucky and formed a law partnership with Samuel Bullock, Thomas&#x27;s cousin. He married on December 12, 1843, and settled in Georgetown, Kentucky. The couple had six children – Joseph Cabell (b. 1844), Clifton Rodes (b. 1846; later a Congressman from Arkansas), Frances (b. 1848), John Milton (b. 1849), John Witherspoon (b. 1850), and Mary Desha (b. 1854). Gaining confidence in his ability as a lawyer, Breckinridge moved his family back to Lexington in 1845 and formed a partnership with future U.S. Senator James B. Beck.

==Mexican–American War==

A supporter of the Mexican–American War, Breckinridge sought appointment to the staff of Major General William Orlando Butler, a prominent Kentucky Democrat, but Butler could only offer him an unpaid aide position and advised him to decline it. In July 1847, Breckinridge delivered an address at a mass military funeral in Frankfort to honor Kentuckians killed in the Battle of Buena Vista. The oration brought Whig Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky, whose son was among the dead, to tears, and inspired Theodore O&#x27;Hara to write &quot;Bivouac of the Dead&quot;.

Breckinridge again applied for a military commission after William Owsley, the governor of Kentucky, called for two additional regiments on August 31, 1847. Owsley&#x27;s advisors encouraged the Whig governor to commission at least one Democrat, and Whig Senator John J. Crittenden supported Breckinridge&#x27;s application. On September 6, 1847, Owsley appointed Manlius V. Thomson as colonel, Thomas Crittenden as lieutenant colonel, and Breckinridge as major of the Third Kentucky Infantry Regiment. The regiment left Kentucky on November 1 and reached Vera Cruz by November 21. After a serious epidemic of &quot;la Vomito,&quot; or yellow fever, broke out at Vera Cruz, the regiment hurried to Mexico City. Reports indicate that Breckinridge walked all but two days of the journey, allowing weary soldiers to use his horse. When they reached Mexico City on December 18, the fighting was almost over; they participated in no combat and remained as an army of occupation until May 30, 1848.

In demand more for his legal expertise than his military training, he was named as assistant counsel for Gideon Johnson Pillow during a court of inquiry initiated against him by Winfield Scott. Seeking to derail Scott&#x27;s presidential ambitions, Pillow and his supporters composed and published letters that lauded Pillow, not Scott, for the American victories at Contreras and Churubusco. To hide his involvement, Pillow convinced a subordinate to take credit for the letter he wrote. Breckinridge biographer William C. Davis writes that it was &quot;most unlikely&quot; that Breckinridge knew the details of Pillow&#x27;s intrigue. His role in the proceedings was limited to questioning a few witnesses; records show that Pillow represented himself during the court&#x27;s proceedings.

Returning to Louisville on July 16, the Third Kentucky mustered out on July 21. During their time in Mexico, over 100 members of the 1,000-man regiment died of illness. Although he saw no combat, Breckinridge&#x27;s military service proved an asset to his political prospects.

==Political career==
===Early political career===
Breckinridge campaigned for Democratic presidential nominee James K. Polk in the 1844 election. He decided against running for county clerk of Scott County after his law partner complained that he spent too much time in politics. In 1845, some local Democrats encouraged him to seek the Eighth District&#x27;s congressional seat, but he declined, supporting Alexander Keith Marshall, the party&#x27;s unsuccessful nominee. As a private citizen, he opposed the Wilmot Proviso that would have banned slavery in the territory acquired in the war with Mexico. In the 1848 presidential election, he backed the unsuccessful Democratic ticket of Lewis Cass and William Butler. He did not vote in the election. Defending his decision during a speech in Lexington on September 5, 1860, Breckinridge explained:
===Kentucky House of Representatives===
In August 1849, Kentuckians elected delegates to a state constitutional convention in addition to state representatives and senators. Breckinridge&#x27;s abolitionist uncles, William and Robert, joined with Cassius Marcellus Clay to nominate slates of like-minded candidates for the constitutional convention and the legislature. In response, a bipartisan group of proslavery citizens organized its own slate of candidates, including Breckinridge for one of Fayette County&#x27;s two seats in the House of Representatives. Breckinridge, who by this time enslaved five humans, had publicly opposed &quot;impairing in any form&quot; the legal protection of slavery. Despite his endorsement of slavery protections, he was a member of the Freemasons and the First Presbyterian Church in Lexington, both of which officially opposed slavery. He had also previously represented free blacks in court, expressed support for voluntary emancipation, and supported the Kentucky Colonization Society, which was dedicated to the relocation of free blacks to Liberia.
Breckinridge received 1,481 votes, over 400 more than his nearest competitor, making this the first time that Fayette County had elected a Democrat to the state House of Representatives. Between the election and the legislative session, Breckinridge formed a new law partnership with Owsley&#x27;s former secretary of state, George B. Kinkead, his previous partner having died in a cholera epidemic earlier in the year. He also co-founded the &quot;Kentucky Statesman&quot;, a semiweekly Democratic newspaper, and visited his step-cousin, Mary Todd, where he met her husband, Abraham Lincoln, for the first time; despite their political differences, they became friends.

When the House convened, Breckinridge received a plurality of votes for speaker, but fell at least eight votes short of a majority. Unable to break the deadlock, he withdrew, and the position went to Whig Thomas Reilly. Biographer Frank H. Heck wrote that Breckinridge was the leader of the House Democratic caucus during the session, during which time most of the measures considered were &quot;local or personal and in any case, petty&quot;. Breckinridge was assigned to the House&#x27;s standing committees on federal relations and the judiciary. He supported bills allocating funding for internal improvements, a traditionally Whig stance. As Congress debated Henry Clay&#x27;s proposed Compromise of 1850, the four Whigs on the Committee on Federal Relations drew up resolutions urging the Kentucky congressional delegation to support the compromise as a &quot;fair, equitable, and just basis&quot; for settlement of the slavery issue in the newly acquired U.S. territories. Breckinridge felt that the resolution was too vague and authored a minority report that explicitly denied federal authority to interfere with slavery in states and territories. Both sets of resolutions, and a set adopted by the Senate, were all laid on the table.

On March 4, 1850, three days before the end of the session, Breckinridge took a leave of absence to care for his son, John Milton, who had become ill; he died on March 18. Keeping a busy schedule to cope with his grief, he urged adoption of the proposed constitution at a series of meetings around the state. His only concern with the document was its lack of an amendment process. The constitution was overwhelmingly ratified in May. Democrats wanted to nominate him for re-election, but he declined, citing problems &quot;of a private and imperative character&quot;. Davis wrote &quot;his problem – besides continuing sadness over his son&#x27;s death – was money.&quot;

===U.S. Representative===
====First term (1851–1853)====
Breckinridge was a delegate to the January 8, 1851, state Democratic convention, which nominated Lazarus W. Powell for governor. A week later, he announced that he would seek election to Congress from Kentucky&#x27;s Eighth District. Nicknamed the &quot;Ashland district&quot; because it contained Ashland, the estate of Whig Party founder Henry Clay, and much of the area Clay once represented, the district was a Whig stronghold. In the previous congressional election, Democrats had not even nominated a candidate. Breckinridge&#x27;s opponent, Leslie Combs, was a former state legislator whose popularity was bolstered by his association with Clay and his participation in the War of 1812; he was expected to win the election easily. In April, the candidates held a debate in Frankfort, and in May, they jointly canvassed the district, making daily speeches. Breckinridge reiterated his strict constructionist view of the U.S. Constitution and denounced the protective tariffs advocated by the Whigs, stating that &quot;free thought needs free trade&quot;. His strong voice and charismatic personality contrasted with the campaign style of the much older Combs. On election day, he carried only three of the district&#x27;s seven counties, but accumulated a two-to-one victory margin in Owen County, winning the county by 677 votes and the election by 537. Democrats carried five of Kentucky&#x27;s 10 congressional districts, and Powell was elected as the first Democratic governor since 1834.

Supporters promoted Breckinridge for Speaker of the House, but he refused to allow his own nomination and voted with the majority to elect fellow Kentuckian Linn Boyd. Despite this, the two were factional enemies, and Boyd assigned Breckinridge to the lightly regarded Committee on Foreign Affairs. Breckinridge&#x27;s first speech, and several subsequent ones, were made to defend William Butler, again a presidential aspirant in 1852, from charges leveled by proponents of the Young America movement that he was too old and had not made his stance on slavery clear. The attacks came from the pages of George Nicholas Sanders&#x27;s &quot;Democratic Review&quot;, and on the House floor from several men, nearly all of whom supported Stephen Douglas for the nomination. These men included California&#x27;s Edward C. Marshall, who was Breckinridge&#x27;s cousin. Their attacks ultimately hurt Douglas&#x27;s chances for the nomination, and Breckinridge&#x27;s defense of Butler enhanced his own reputation. After this controversy, he was more active in the chamber&#x27;s debates, but introduced few significant pieces of legislation. He defended the constitutionality of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 against attacks by Ohio Representative Joshua Giddings, and opposed Andrew Johnson&#x27;s proposed Homestead Act out of concern that it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Despite his campaign rhetoric that federal funds should only be used for internal improvements &quot;of a national character&quot;, he sought to increase Kentucky&#x27;s federal allocation for construction and maintenance of rivers and harbors, and supported bills that benefited his district&#x27;s hemp farmers.

Returning home from the legislative session, Breckinridge made daily visits with Henry Clay, who lay dying in Lexington, and was chosen to deliver Clay&#x27;s eulogy in Congress when the next session commenced. The eulogy enhanced his popularity and solidified his position as Clay&#x27;s political heir apparent. He also campaigned for the election of Democrat Franklin Pierce as president. Although Pierce lost Kentucky by 3,200 votes, Breckinridge wielded more influence with him than he had with outgoing Whig President Millard Fillmore. A week after his inauguration, Pierce offered Breckinridge an appointment as governor of Washington Territory. He had initially sought the appointment, securing letters of recommendation from Powell and Butler, but by the time it was offered, he had decided to stay in Kentucky and seek re-election to the House.

====Second term (1853–1855)====

The Whigs, seeking to recapture Breckinridge&#x27;s seat, nominated Kentucky Attorney General of Kentucky James Harlan, but some Whig factions opposed him, and he withdrew in March. Robert P. Letcher, a former congressman and governor who had won 14 elections in Kentucky without a loss, was the party&#x27;s second choice. Both candidates campaigned vigorously throughout the Eighth District, making multiple speeches a day between May and August. Letcher was an experienced campaigner, but his popular, anecdote-filled oratory was unpolished, and he was prone to outbursts of anger when frustrated. By contrast, Breckinridge delivered calm, well-reasoned speeches. Cassius Clay, a political enemy of Letcher&#x27;s for years, endorsed Breckinridge, despite their differences on slavery. Citing this endorsement and the abolitionism of Breckinridge&#x27;s uncles, Letcher tried to paint Breckinridge as an enemy of slavery. Breckinridge pointed to his consistent support for slavery and claimed Letcher was actually hostile to the interests of slaveholders. Although the district had gone for Whig candidate Winfield Scott by over 600 votes in the previous year&#x27;s presidential election, Breckinridge defeated Letcher by 526 votes. Once again, he received a large margin in Owen County, which reported 123 more votes than eligible voters living in the county. Grateful for the support of the reliably Democratic county, he gave his son John Witherspoon Breckinridge the nickname &quot;Owen&quot;.

Of the 234 members of the House, Breckinridge was among the 80 who were returned to their seats for the Thirty-third Congress. Due to his increased seniority, he was assigned to the more prestigious Ways and Means Committee, but he was not given a committee chairmanship as many had expected. Although he supported Pierce&#x27;s proslavery agenda on the principle of states&#x27; rights and believed that secession was legal, he opposed secession as a remedy to the country&#x27;s immediate problems. This, coupled with his earlier support of manumission and African colonization, balanced his support for slavery; most still considered him a moderate legislator.

An ally of Illinois&#x27; Stephen A. Douglas, Breckinridge supported the doctrine of popular sovereignty as expressed in Douglas&#x27;s Kansas–Nebraska Act. He believed passage of the act would remove the issue of slavery from national politics – although it ultimately had the opposite effect – and acted as a liaison between Douglas and Pierce to secure its passage. During the debate on the House floor, New York&#x27;s Francis B. Cutting, incensed by a statement that Breckinridge had made, demanded that he explain or retract it. Breckinridge interpreted Cutting&#x27;s demand as a challenge to duel. Under &quot;code duello&quot;, the individual being challenged retained the right to name the weapons used and the distance between the combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 paces. He also specified that the duel should be held at Silver Spring, Maryland, the home of his friend Francis Preston Blair. Cutting, who had not intended his initial remark as a challenge, believed that Breckinridge&#x27;s naming of terms constituted a challenge; he chose to use pistols at a distance of 10 paces. While the two men attempted to clarify who had issued the challenge and who reserved the right to choose the terms, mutual friends resolved the issue, preventing the duel. The recently adopted Kentucky Constitution prevented anyone who participated in a duel from holding elected office, and the peaceful resolution of the issue may have saved Breckinridge&#x27;s political career.

====Retirement from the House====

In February 1854, the Whig majority in the Kentucky General Assembly passed – over Powell&#x27;s veto – a reapportionment bill that redrew Breckinridge&#x27;s district, removing Owen County and replacing it with Harrison and Nicholas Counties. This, combined with the rise of the Know Nothing Party in Kentucky, left Breckinridge with little hope of re-election, and he decided to retire from the House at the expiration of his term. Following the December 1854 resignation of Pierre Soulé, the U.S. Minister to Spain, who failed to negotiate a U.S. annexation of Cuba following the controversial Ostend Manifesto, Pierce nominated Breckinridge to the position. Although the Senate confirmed the nomination, Breckinridge declined it on February 8, 1855, telling Pierce only that his decision was &quot;of a private and domestic nature.&quot; His term in the house expired on March 4.

Desiring to care for his sick wife and rebuild his personal wealth, Breckinridge returned to his law practice in Lexington. In addition to his legal practice, he engaged in land speculation in Minnesota territory and Wisconsin. When Governor Willis A. Gorman of the Minnesota Territory thwarted an attempt by Breckinridge&#x27;s fellow investors (not including Breckinridge) to secure approval of a railroad connecting Dubuque, Iowa, with their investments near Superior, Wisconsin, they petitioned Pierce to remove Gorman and appoint Breckinridge in his place. In 1855, Pierce authorized two successive investigations of Gorman, but failed to uncover any wrongdoing that would justify his removal. During his time away from politics, Breckinridge also promoted the advancement of horse racing in his native state and was chosen president of the Kentucky Association for the Improvement of the Breed of Horses.

===Vice presidency (1857–1861)===

As a delegate to the 1856 Democratic National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, Breckinridge favored Pierce&#x27;s renomination for president. When Pierce&#x27;s hopes of securing the nomination faltered, Breckinridge joined other erstwhile Pierce backers by throwing his support behind his friend, Stephen Douglas. Even with this additional support, Douglas was still unable to garner two third&#x27;s majority of the delegates&#x27; votes, and he withdrew, leaving James Buchanan as the Democratic presidential nominee. William Alexander Richardson, a Kentucky-born Representative from Illinois, then suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice president would balance Buchanan&#x27;s ticket and placate disgruntled supporters of Douglas or Pierce. A delegate from Louisiana placed his name before the convention, and although Breckinridge desired the vice presidential nomination, he declined, citing his deference to fellow Kentuckian and former House Speaker Linn Boyd, who was supported by the Kentucky delegation.

Ten men received votes on the first vice-presidential ballot. Mississippi&#x27;s John A. Quitman had the most support with 59 votes. Eight state delegations – with a total of 55 votes – voted for Breckinridge in spite of his refusal of the nomination, making him the second-highest vote getter. Kentucky cast its 12 votes for Boyd, bringing his third-place total to 33 votes. Seeing Breckinridge&#x27;s strength on the first ballot, large numbers of delegates voted for him on the second ballot, and those who did not soon saw that his nomination was inevitable and changed their votes to make it unanimous.

Unlike many political nominees of his time, Breckinridge actively campaigned for Buchanan and his election. During the first 10 days of September 1856, he spoke in Hamilton and Cincinnati, Ohio; Lafayette and Indianapolis, Indiana; Kalamazoo, Michigan; Covington, Kentucky; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His speeches stressed the idea that Republicans were fanatically devoted to emancipation, and their election would prompt the dissolution of the Union. Breckinridge&#x27;s presence on the ticket helped the Democrats carry his home state of Kentucky, which the party had not won since 1828, by 6,000 votes. Buchanan and Breckinridge received 174 electoral votes to 114 for Republicans John C. Frémont and William L. Dayton and eight for Know Nothing candidates Millard Fillmore and Andrew Jackson Donelson. Thirty-six years old at the time of his inauguration on March 4, 1857, Breckinridge was the youngest vice president in U.S. history, exceeding the minimum age required under the Constitution by only a year.

Buchanan resented that Breckinridge had supported both Pierce and Douglas before endorsing his nomination. Relations between the two were further strained, when upon asking for a private interview with Buchanan, Breckinridge was told to come to the White House and ask for Harriet Lane, who acted as the mansion&#x27;s host for the unmarried president. Feeling slighted by the response, Breckinridge refused to carry out these instructions; later, three of Buchanan&#x27;s intimates informed Breckinridge that requesting to speak to Miss Lane was actually a secret instruction to White House staff to usher the requestor into a private audience with the president. They also conveyed Buchanan&#x27;s apologies for the misunderstanding.
Buchanan rarely consulted Breckinridge when making patronage appointments, and meetings between the two were infrequent. When Buchanan and Breckinridge endorsed the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state instead of allowing the people to vote, they managed to alienate most Northern Democrats, including Douglas. This disagreement ended plans for Breckinridge, Douglas, and Minnesota&#x27;s Henry Mower Rice to build a series of three elaborate, conjoined row houses in which to live during their time in Washington, DC. In November 1857, after Breckinridge found alternative lodging in Washington, he sold a slave woman and her young infant, which according to historian James C. Klotter, probably ended his days as a slaveholder. When Breckinridge did not travel to Illinois to campaign for Douglas&#x27;s re-election to the Senate and gave him only a lukewarm endorsement, relations between them worsened.

Functioning as the Senate&#x27;s presiding officer, Breckinridge&#x27;s participation in the chamber&#x27;s debates was also restricted, but he won respect for presiding &quot;gracefully and impartially.&quot; On January 4, 1859, he was asked to deliver the final address in the Old Senate Chamber; in the speech, he expressed his desire that the Congress find a solution that would preserve the Union. During its half century in the chamber, the Senate had grown from 32 to 64 members. During those years, he observed, the Constitution had &quot;survived peace and war, prosperity and adversity&quot; to protect &quot;the larger personal freedom compatible with public order.&quot; Breckinridge expressed hope that eventually &quot;another Senate, in another age, shall bear to a new and larger Chamber, this Constitution vigorous and inviolate, and that the last generation of posterity shall witness the deliberations of the Representatives of American States, still united, prosperous, and free.&quot; Breckinridge then led a procession to the new chamber. Breckinridge opposed the idea that the federal government could coerce action by a state, but maintained that secession, while legal, was not the solution to the country&#x27;s problems.

Although John Crittenden&#x27;s Senate term did not expire until 1861, the Kentucky General Assembly met to choose his successor in 1859. Until just days before the election, the contest was expected to be between Breckinridge and Boyd, who had been elected lieutenant governor in August; Boyd&#x27;s worsening health prompted his withdrawal on November 28, 1859. On December 12, the Assembly chose Breckinridge over Joshua Fry Bell, the defeated candidate in the August gubernatorial election, by a vote of 81–53. In his acceptance speech, delivered to the Kentucky House of Representatives on December 21, Breckinridge endorsed the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;, which ruled that Congress could not restrict slavery in the territories, and insisted that John Brown&#x27;s recent raid on Harpers Ferry was evidence of Republicans&#x27; insistence on either &quot;negro equality&quot; or violence. Resistance in some form, he predicted, would eventually be necessary. He still urged the assembly against secession – &quot;God forbid that the step shall ever be taken!&quot; – but his discussion of growing sectional conflict bothered some, including his uncle Robert.

===Presidential campaign of 1860===
Early in 1859, Senator James Henry Hammond of South Carolina reported to a friend that Breckinridge was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, but as late as January 1860, Breckinridge told family members that he had no desire for the nomination. A &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial noted that while Buchanan was falling &quot;in prestige and political consequence, the star of the Vice President rises higher above the clouds.&quot; Douglas, considered the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, was convinced that Breckinridge would be a candidate; this, combined with Buchanan&#x27;s reluctant support of Breckinridge and Breckinridge&#x27;s public support for a federal slave code, deepened the rift between the two.

Among Breckinridge&#x27;s supporters at the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina, were several prominent Kentuckians. They were former Kentucky Governor and current Senator Lazarus W. Powell, former Kentucky Representative William Preston (a distant relative), law partner James Brown Clay, and James B. Beck. Breckinridge did not attend the convention, but instructed his supporters not to nominate him as long as James Guthrie remained a candidate. Accordingly, when a delegate from Arkansas nominated Breckinridge for president on the 36th ballot, Beck asked that it be withdrawn, and the request was honored. Over the course of 57 ballots, Douglas maintained a wide plurality, but failed to gain the necessary two-thirds majority; Guthrie consistently ran second. Unable to nominate a candidate, delegates voted to reconvene in Baltimore, Maryland, on June 18.

Pro-Southern delegates, who had walked out of the Charleston convention in protest of its failure to adopt a federal slave code plank in its platform, did not participate in the Baltimore convention. The delegates from Alabama and Louisiana – all of whom had walked out at Charleston – had been replaced, after five days of debate and holding votes on the issue, with Douglas supporters from those states, leading to the nomination of Douglas and Herschel Vespasian Johnson for president and vice president, respectively, on the sixth day. The protesting delegates convened on the same day in Baltimore. On the first ballot, Breckinridge received 81 votes, with 24 going to former senator Daniel S. Dickinson of New York. Dickinson supporters gradually changed their support to Breckinridge to make his nomination unanimous, and Joseph Lane of Oregon was chosen by acclamation as his vice presidential running mate. Despite concerns about the breakup of the party, Breckinridge accepted the presidential nomination. In August, Mississippi Senator Jefferson Davis attempted to broker a compromise under which Douglas, Breckinridge, and Tennessee&#x27;s John Bell, the nominee of the Constitutional Union Party, would all withdraw in favor of a compromise candidate. Both Breckinridge and Bell readily agreed to the plan, but Douglas was opposed to compromising with the &quot;Bolters&quot;, and his supporters retained an intense dislike for Breckinridge that made them averse to Davis&#x27;s proposal.

Opponents knew Breckinridge believed in the right of secession and accused him of favoring the breakup of the Union; he denied the latter during a speech in Frankfort: &quot;I am an American citizen, a Kentuckian who never did an act nor cherished a thought that was not full of devotion to the Constitution and the Union.&quot; While he had very little support in the northern states, most, if not all, of the southern states were expected to go for Breckinridge. This would give him only 120 of 303 electoral votes, but to gain support from any northern states, he had to minimize his connections with the southern states and risked losing their support to Bell. Some Breckinridge supporters believed his best hope was for the election to be thrown to the House of Representatives; if he could add the support of some Douglas or Bell states to the 13 believed to support him, he could beat Lincoln, who was believed to carry the support of 15 states. To Davis&#x27;s wife, Varina, Breckinridge wrote, &quot;I trust I have the courage to lead a forlorn hope.&quot;
In the four-way contest, Breckinridge came in third in the popular vote, with 18.1%, but second in the Electoral College. The final electoral vote was 180 for Lincoln, 72 for Breckinridge, 39 for Bell, and 12 for Douglas. Although Breckinridge won the states of the Deep South, his support in those states came mostly from rural areas with low slave populations; the urban areas with higher slave populations generally went for Bell or Douglas. Breckinridge also carried the border states of Maryland and Delaware. Historian James C. Klotter points out in light of these results that, while Douglas maintained that there was &quot;not a disunionist in America who is not a Breckinridge man&quot;, it is more likely that party loyalty and economic status played a more prominent role in Breckinridge&#x27;s support than did issues of slavery and secession. He lost to Douglas in Missouri and Bell in Virginia and Tennessee. Bell also captured Breckinridge&#x27;s home state, Kentucky. Lincoln swept most of the northern states, although New Jersey split its electoral votes, giving four to Lincoln and three to Douglas. As the candidate of the Buchanan faction, Breckinridge outpolled Douglas in Pennsylvania and received support comparable to Douglas in Connecticut, although he received very little support elsewhere in the North. It was Breckinridge&#x27;s duty as vice president to announce Lincoln as the winner of the electoral college vote on February 13, 1861.

On February 24, Breckinridge visited Lincoln at Willard&#x27;s Hotel in Washington, DC, and frequently thereafter he visited his step-cousin, now the First Lady, at the White House. In the lame duck session following the election, Congress adopted a resolution authored by Lazarus Powell, now in the Senate, calling for a committee of thirteen (Committee of Thirteen on the Disturbed Condition of the Country) &quot;to consider that portion of the President&#x27;s message relating to the disturbances of the country.&quot; Frank Heck wrote that Breckinridge appointed &quot;an able committee, representing every major faction.&quot; He endorsed Crittenden&#x27;s proposed compromise, a collection of constitutional amendments designed to avert secession and appease the South. Breckinridge used his influence as the Senate&#x27;s presiding officer in an unsuccessful attempt to get it approved by either the committee or the Senate. Ultimately, the committee reported that they were unable to agree on a recommendation. On March 4, 1861, the last day of the session, Breckinridge swore in Hannibal Hamlin as his successor as vice president. Hamlin, in turn, swore in the newly elected senators, including Breckinridge.

===U.S. Senator===
Seven states had already seceded when Breckinridge took his seat as a senator, leaving the remaining Southern senators more outnumbered in their defense of slavery. Seeking to find a compromise that would reunite the states under constitutional principles, he urged Lincoln to withdraw federal forces from the Confederate states to avert war. The congressional session ended on March 28, and in an April 2 address to the Kentucky General Assembly, he continued to advocate peaceful reconciliation of the states and proposed a conference of border states to seek a solution. On April 12, Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumter, ending plans for the conference. Breckinridge recommended that Governor Beriah Magoffin call a sovereignty convention to determine whether Kentucky would side with the Union or the Confederacy. On May 10, he was chosen by the legislature as one of six delegates to a conference to decide the state&#x27;s next action. The states&#x27; rights delegates were Breckinridge, Magoffin, and Richard Hawes; the Unionist delegates were Crittenden, Archibald Dixon, and S.S. Nicholas. Unable to agree on substantial issues, the delegates recommended that Kentucky adopt a neutral stance in the Civil War and arm itself to prevent invasion by either federal or Confederate forces. Breckinridge did not support this recommendation, but he agreed to abide by it once it was approved by the legislature.

In special elections in June, pro-Union candidates captured 9 of 10 seats in Kentucky&#x27;s House delegation. Returning to the Senate for a special session in July, Breckinridge was regarded as a traitor by most of his fellow legislators because of his Confederate sympathies. He condemned as unconstitutional Lincoln&#x27;s enlistment and arming of men for a war Congress had not officially declared, his expending funds for the war that had not been allocated by Congress, and his suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. He was the only senator to vote against a resolution authorizing Lincoln to use &quot;the entire resources of the government&quot; for the war. Asked what he would do if he were president, he replied, &quot;I would prefer to see these States all reunited upon true constitutional principles to any other object that could be offered me in life. But I infinitely prefer to see a peaceful separation of these States than to see endless, aimless, devastating war, at the end of which I see the grave of public liberty and of personal freedom.&quot; On August 1, he declared that, if Kentucky sided with the federal government against the Confederacy, &quot;she will be represented by some other man on the floor of this Senate.&quot;

Kentucky&#x27;s neutrality was breached by both federal and Confederate forces in early September 1861 (the Federal forces maintained that there had been no breach, as Kentucky was an integral part of the Union). Confederate forces invaded Kentucky on September 3; they were followed by a Union force commanded by Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant, which on the morning of September 6 occupied the town of Paducah on the Ohio River. Soon after, Unionists in the state arrested former governor Charles S. Morehead for his suspected Confederate sympathies and shut down the &quot;Louisville Courier&quot; because of its pro-Confederate editorials. Word reached Breckinridge that Union General Thomas E. Bramlette intended to arrest him next. To avoid detainment, on September 19, 1861, he left Lexington. Joined in Prestonsburg by Confederate sympathizers George W. Johnson, George Baird Hodge, William Preston, and William E. Simms, he continued to Abingdon, Virginia, and from there by rail to Confederate-held Bowling Green, Kentucky. The state legislature immediately requested his resignation.

In an open letter to his constituents dated October 8, 1861, Breckinridge maintained that the Union no longer existed and that Kentucky should be free to choose her own course; he defended his sympathy to the Southern cause and denounced the Unionist state legislature, declaring, &quot;I exchange with proud satisfaction a term of six years in the Senate of the United States for the musket of a soldier.&quot; He was indicted for treason in U.S. federal district court in Frankfort on November 6, 1861, having officially enlisted in the Confederate army days earlier. On December 2, 1861, he was declared a traitor by the U.S. Senate. A resolution stating &quot;Whereas John C. Breckinridge, a member of this body from the State of Kentucky, has joined the enemies of his country, and is now in arms against the government he had sworn to support: Therefore—Resolved, That said John C. Breckinridge, the traitor, be, and he hereby is, expelled from the Senate,&quot; was adopted by a vote of 36–0 on December 4. Ten Southern Senators had been expelled earlier that year in July.

==American Civil War==
===Service in the Western Theater===
On the recommendation of Simon Bolivar Buckner, the former commander of the Kentucky State Militia who had also joined the Confederate Army, Breckinridge was commissioned as a brigadier general on November 2, 1861. On November 16, he was given command of the 1st Kentucky Brigade. Nicknamed the Orphan Brigade because its men felt orphaned by Kentucky&#x27;s Unionist state government, the brigade was in Buckner&#x27;s 2nd Division of the Army of Mississippi, commanded by General Albert Sidney Johnston. For several weeks, he trained his troops in the city, and he also participated in the organization of a provisional Confederate government for the state. Although not sanctioned by the legislature in Frankfort, its existence prompted the Confederacy to admit Kentucky on December 10, 1861.

Johnston&#x27;s forces were forced to withdraw from Bowling Green in February 1862. During the retreat, Breckinridge was put in charge of Johnston&#x27;s Reserve Corps. Johnston decided to attack Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s forces at Shiloh, Tennessee on April 6, 1862, by advancing North from his base in Corinth, Mississippi. Breckinridge&#x27;s reserves soon joined the Battle of Shiloh as Johnston tried to force Grant&#x27;s troops into the river. Despite Johnston being killed in the fighting, the Confederates made steady progress against Grant&#x27;s troops until P. G. T. Beauregard – who assumed command after Johnston&#x27;s death – ordered his generals to break off the fighting at about 6 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon. The next day, the Union forces regrouped and repelled the Confederates. Breckinridge&#x27;s division formed the Confederate rearguard, stationing itself on the ground that the Confederates held the night before the first day of the battle while the rest of the army retreated. Union troops did not pursue them. Of the 7,000 troops under Breckinridge&#x27;s command at the battle, 386 were killed and 1,628 were wounded, Breckinridge among the latter.


Breckinridge&#x27;s performance earned him a promotion to major general on April 14, 1862. After his promotion, he joined Earl Van Dorn near Vicksburg, Mississippi. The Confederate forces awaited a Union attack throughout most of July. Finally, Van Dorn ordered Breckinridge to attempt to recapture Baton Rouge, Louisiana, from federal forces. Despite having his forces reduced to around 3,000 by illness and desertions, on the morning of August 5, he attacked the Union garrison, capturing several prisoners, destroying its supplies, and driving it from the city. Union troops were forced to take shelter under cover of their gunboats. The ironclad &quot;CSS Arkansas&quot; was intended to support Breckinridge&#x27;s attack by moving down the Red River, but it was immobilized by a mechanical failure and its crew set it on fire before letting it loose downriver to threaten oncoming Union vessels and to prevent its capture. Without naval support, the Confederates were unable to hold the city. Breckinridge withdrew his troops at 10 o&#x27;clock.

Later that month, Breckinridge served as an independent commander in the lower Mississippi Valley, securing Confederate control of the area by taking Port Hudson, which helped halt the federal advance down the Mississippi River. Meanwhile, General Braxton Bragg, commanding the Army of Mississippi, was preparing an invasion of Kentucky, and Breckinridge was ordered to join him. Confederate leaders believed that Breckinridge&#x27;s presence in the state could spur enlistments. Van Dorn was reluctant to lose command of Breckinridge and his men, and by the time he relented on October 15, Bragg was already retreating from the state after being defeated at the Battle of Perryville. Breckinridge and his division of 7,000 men met Bragg at Murfreesboro, Tennessee. With Kentucky solidly under Union control, Breckinridge&#x27;s wife and children moved south and followed his troops as closely as was safely possible.

Bragg resented Breckinridge&#x27;s close ties to Confederate commanders, particularly Joseph E. Johnston, Wade Hampton, John B. Floyd, and William Preston, all of whom were related to Breckinridge. Furthermore, he thought Breckinridge&#x27;s late arrival for the Kentucky campaign had contributed to the lack of Confederate volunteers he found in the state. In December, Bragg ordered the execution of Kentucky Corporal Asa Lewis after a court martial had convicted him of desertion. Lewis&#x27;s enlistment had expired, but he continued to serve with the 6th Kentucky Infantry until his impoverished mother and siblings begged him to return home. Although Lewis claimed he was returning to the army at the time of his arrest, Bragg was insistent on reducing desertions by making him an example. After witnessing the execution, Breckinridge reportedly became nauseated and fell forward on his horse, requiring assistance from members of his staff. He protested Bragg&#x27;s &quot;military murder&quot; and was barely able to prevent open mutiny by his Kentucky soldiers. Relations between Breckinridge and Bragg continued to deteriorate; Breckinridge&#x27;s opinion that Bragg was incompetent was shared by many Confederate officers.

At Murfreesboro, Breckinridge&#x27;s Division was assigned to Lieutenant General William J. Hardee&#x27;s Corps and was stationed on the east side of the Stones River. When the Union Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Major General William Rosecrans, attacked on December 31, 1862, beginning the Battle of Stones River, Bragg&#x27;s main force initially repelled the attack. Bragg ordered Breckinridge to reinforce him on the west side of the river, but Brigadier General John Pegram, who commanded a cavalry brigade, erroneously reported that a large Union force was advancing along the east bank, and Breckinridge was slow to comply with Bragg&#x27;s order. When he finally crossed the river, his attacks were ineffective, and Bragg ordered him back across the river. On January 2, a Union division under Brigadier General Horatio P. Van Cleve crossed the river and took a ridge. The position endangered Leonidas Polk&#x27;s corps, which was positioned ahead of the rest of the Confederate lines in the center of the battlefield. Against Breckinridge&#x27;s advice, Bragg ordered his division to launch a frontal attack on the federal position. Prior to the attack, Breckinridge wrote to Preston, &quot;if [the attack] should result in disaster and I be among the killed, I want you to do justice to my memory and tell the people that I believed this attack to be very unwise and tried to prevent it.&quot;

Launching their attack at 4 P.M., Breckinridge&#x27;s men initially broke the Union line and forced them across the river. Artillery on the opposite side of the river then opened fire on Breckinridge&#x27;s men, and a fresh Union division under Brigadier General James S. Negley arrived to reinforce the fleeing troops. In just over an hour, nearly one-third of Breckinridge&#x27;s troops were killed, wounded, or captured. One anecdote holds that, as he rode among the survivors, he cried out repeatedly, &quot;My poor Orphans! My poor Orphans,&quot; bringing recognition to the Orphan Brigade. Bragg&#x27;s official report criticized the conduct of Breckinridge&#x27;s division and assigned to Breckinridge most of the blame for the Confederate defeat. Breckinridge asserted to his superiors that Bragg&#x27;s report &quot;fails to do justice to the behavior of my Division&quot;; he requested a court of inquiry, but the request was denied. Several Kentuckians under Breckinridge&#x27;s command, who already blamed Bragg for the failed invasion of their native state, encouraged him to resign his commission and challenge Bragg to a duel.

In May 1863, Breckinridge was reassigned to Joseph E. Johnston, participating in the Battle of Jackson in an unsuccessful attempt to break the siege of Vicksburg. Vicksburg fell to Grant&#x27;s forces on July 4, and Breckinridge was returned to Bragg&#x27;s command on August 28, 1863. After seeing no action on the first day of the Battle of Chickamauga in Georgia on September 19, he led a division of D.H. Hill&#x27;s corps in an attack on the Union forces the next morning. The Confederate troops succeeded in breaking the Union line, but the main army escaped back to Tennessee. Of Breckinridge&#x27;s 3,769 men, 166 were killed in the battle; 909 were wounded and 165 were missing.

In late November, Breckinridge commanded one of Bragg&#x27;s two corps during the Confederate defeat at the Battles for Chattanooga. Bragg ordered a significant number of Breckinridge&#x27;s men to reinforce Hardee&#x27;s corps, leaving him with insufficient forces to repel the combined attack of Joseph Hooker and George Henry Thomas on Missionary Ridge. His son, Cabell, was captured in the battle. He was later freed in a prisoner exchange. In his official report, Bragg charged Breckinridge with drunkenness at Chattanooga and (retroactively) at Stones River. Historian Lowell H. Harrison noted that, while Breckinridge frequently drank whiskey, he was well known for being able to consume large amounts without getting drunk. Before submitting his own resignation, which was accepted, Bragg removed Breckinridge from command. It would be almost two years – on May 1, 1865 – before the two would reconcile.

===Service in the Eastern Theater===

On December 15, 1863, Breckinridge took leave in Richmond. Premature rumors of his death prompted &quot;The New York Times&quot; to print a quite vituperative obituary suggesting that Breckinridge had been a hypocrite for supporting states&#x27; rights, then abandoning his home state when it chose to remain in the Union. Confederate leaders were skeptical of Bragg&#x27;s claims against Breckinridge, and in February 1864, Confederate President Jefferson Davis assigned him to the Eastern Theater and put him in charge of the Trans-Allegheny Department (later known as the Department of East Tennessee and West Virginia).

On May 5, General Robert E. Lee, commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, ordered Breckinridge to take command of a reconnaissance mission to scout the federal forces under Franz Sigel near Winchester, Virginia as part of the Lynchburg Campaign. With a force of about 4,800 men, including 261 cadets from the Virginia Military Institute, he defeated Sigel&#x27;s 6,300 men at the Battle of New Market on May 15, driving them west across the Shenandoah River. In doing so, Breckinridge&#x27;s troops protected Lee&#x27;s flank, defended a crucial railroad junction, and protected the valuable wheat supply. Lee had suggested that Breckinridge invade Maryland, but he was unable to do so because floodwaters had made the Potomac River virtually impassable. The victory was considered one of his best performances as a general. Since then, many in the South have viewed him as a &quot;worthy successor&quot; of the late Stonewall Jackson. Breckinridge would draw more comparisons at the Second Battle of Kernstown, the scene of the first fight in Jackson&#x27;s Valley Campaign two years earlier. In the Second Battle, which occurred on July 24, 13,000 Confederate troops commanded by Lt. Gen. Jubal Early attacked and defeated 10,000 Federal troops under the command of Brig. Gen. George Crook. The victory allowed the Confederates to resume their invasion of the North. Shortly thereafter, Breckinridge&#x27;s Division reinforced Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia and played an important role in halting Grant&#x27;s advance at the Battle of Cold Harbor. During the battle, his troops repulsed a powerful Union attack. Breckinridge was wounded when a cannonball struck his horse and he was pinned underneath. He was still unable to walk or ride when Lee ordered him to take command of the survivors of the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Piedmont. Traveling by rail to Rockfish Gap on June 10, he marched his forces into the city of Lynchburg, Virginia. He was joined there by General Early&#x27;s troops, who arrived just in time to save the Confederate forces from an assault by Union forces under David Hunter at the Battle of Lynchburg.

After Early and Breckinridge (who was now able to ride a horse) chased Hunter more than sixty miles away from the city, Lee ordered them to clear the Union forces from the Shenandoah Valley, then cross into Maryland and probe the defenses of Washington, D.C. Union forces&#x27; only serious attempt to turn back the expedition came at the Battle of Monocacy on July 9. Confederate troops were delayed, but ultimately prevailed and continued toward Washington. They were defeated at the Battle of Fort Stevens on July 11–12, partially with reinforcements brought in by the United States Government with the time gained from the Battle of Monocacy. Since Lincoln was watching the fight from the ramparts of Fort Stevens, this marked only time in American history in which two former opponents in a presidential election faced one another across battle lines. Following the battle, Early decided to withdraw rather than assault the well-fortified federal capital. Early and Breckinridge were able to hold the Shenandoah Valley through July and August, but on September 19, 1864, Philip Sheridan forced their retreat at the Third Battle of Winchester. Responding to General John Brown Gordon&#x27;s admonition to be careful in the fight, Breckinridge responded, &quot;Well, general, there is little left for me if our cause is to fail.&quot;

After the death of John Hunt Morgan, Breckinridge again took command of the Department of East Tennessee and West Virginia. He reorganized the department, which was in great disarray. On October 2, 1864, at the First Battle of Saltville, his troops were able to protect critical Confederate salt works from United States forces under Stephen G. Burbridge, despite a lack of resources. The next morning, he discovered that soldiers under his command had begun killing an estimated 45 to 100 wounded black Union soldiers of the 5th United States Colored Cavalry. Hearing the gunfire, he rushed to stop the massacre. Brigadier General Felix Huston Robertson was suspected of involvement and bragged about killing the negroes. General Lee instructed Breckinridge to &quot;prefer charges against him and bring him to trial&quot;, but no trial ever took place.

In mid-November, Breckinridge led a raid into northeastern Tennessee, driving Alvan Cullem Gillem&#x27;s forces back to Knoxville at the Battle of Bull&#x27;s Gap. On December 17–18, he faced a two-pronged attack from Union cavalry under Major General George Stoneman at the Battle of Marion in Virginia. Badly outnumbered on either flank, Breckinridge resisted Stoneman&#x27;s forces until he ran low on ammunition. Stoneman&#x27;s forces were able to damage Confederate salt works, lead mines, and railroads in the area, and destroy supply depots at Bristol and Abingdon. Finally restocked with ammunition after three days, Breckinridge was able to drive Stoneman – whose men were now short of ammunition themselves – out of the area.

===Confederate Secretary of War===
James A. Seddon resigned his position as the Confederate Secretary of War on January 19, 1865. On February 6, Davis appointed Breckinridge to the vacant position, partially to quiet growing opposition to his administration. Initially opposed by several members of the Confederate Congress because he had waited to join the Confederacy, he eventually gained their support by administering his office more efficiently than his predecessors. With their support, he was able to expand the post&#x27;s influence to include making officer assignments and promotion recommendations and advising field generals regarding strategy. His first act as secretary was to promote Robert E. Lee to general-in-chief of all Confederate forces. After Lee reported a critical shortage of food, clothing, and supplies among his troops, Breckinridge recommended the removal of Lucius B. Northrop, the Confederate commissary general. Northrop&#x27;s successor, Isaac M. St. John, improved the flow of supplies to troops in the field.
By late February, Breckinridge concluded that the Confederate cause was hopeless. Delegating the day-to-day operations of his office to his assistant, John Archibald Campbell, he began laying the groundwork for surrender. Davis desired to continue the fight, but Breckinridge urged, &quot;This has been a magnificent epic. In God&#x27;s name let it not terminate in farce.&quot; On April 2, Lee sent a telegram to Breckinridge informing him that he would have to withdraw from his position that night, and that this would necessitate the evacuation of Richmond. Ordering Campbell to organize the flight of the Confederate cabinet to Danville, Virginia, Breckinridge remained in the city to oversee the destruction of facilities and supplies to prevent their use by the invading federal forces. However, he did not destroy Confederate archives and records, which were preserved for history. Upon his exit from the city, he ordered that the bridges over the James River be burned. His son Clifton, then serving in the Confederate Navy at Richmond, resigned his post and joined his father as he moved southward to meet Davis.

After overseeing the transfer of Richmond, Breckinridge joined Lee&#x27;s forces at Farmville, Virginia, on the night of April 5 and remained there until April 7. He continued on to Danville, arriving on April 11 to discover that Lee had surrendered on April 9 and the Confederate cabinet had already fled to Greensboro, North Carolina. Arriving in Greensboro on April 13, he advised the cabinet that the remaining Confederate armies should be surrendered; only Davis and Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin disagreed. At Bennett Place, he assisted Joseph E. Johnston in his surrender negotiations with Major General William Tecumseh Sherman. Sherman later praised Breckinridge&#x27;s negotiating skills, and the surrender terms agreed to were later rejected by Washington as too generous, forcing Sherman to offer the same terms as Grant had at Appomattox, which were accepted.

On April 18, Breckinridge heard from Sherman and Johnston of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln four days earlier; the President had died in the Petersen House, where Breckinridge briefly resided in late 1852 as a U.S. representative. The Kentuckian was visibly devastated. Eyewitness accounts recall him to have said, &quot;Gentlemen, the South has lost its best friend.&quot;

Breckinridge rode into Abbeville, South Carolina, on the morning of April 28. While there, Breckinridge and Brigadier General Basil W. Duke convinced Davis that continuing the war was hopeless. Breckinridge was put in charge of the $150,000 in gold specie remaining in the Confederate treasury; traveling southward by rail toward Washington, Georgia, a group of soldiers in his military escort – unpaid for months – threatened to divide the gold among themselves before it could be captured by federal troops. Breckinridge convinced them to abandon their scheme after paying them their wages from the treasury, but some of them refused to escort Breckinridge and the bullion any further. Breckinridge&#x27;s party arrived in Washington on May 4 and, after paying out several requisitions from the treasury, deposited the rest in banks there. He also composed a letter to his remaining deputies in which he disbanded the War Department.

==Escape and exile==
On May 5, the same day that Jefferson Davis officially dissolved the Confederate Government, Breckinridge discharged most of the men escorting him, retaining only a small contingent of Kentuckians under the command of his cousin, William Campbell Preston Breckinridge. Feeling honor bound to protect Davis, he attempted to create a diversion that would allow him to escape. The next day, his party encountered a large Federal force; while his cousin negotiated with the force&#x27;s commander, Breckinridge and a small detachment escaped. Riding southward across Georgia, they reached Milltown (now Lakeland) by May 11 and remained there for a few days. Learning of Davis&#x27;s capture, he left Milltown with only a military aide, a personal servant, and his son Cabell. On May 15, 1865, in Madison, Florida, he was joined by fellow fugitive John Taylor Wood, who had been a captain in the Confederate Navy. Breckinridge and Wood decided to flee to the Bahamas, but because Cabell was allergic to mosquitoes, Breckinridge told him to surrender to the nearest federal officer.
At Gainesville, Florida, the group found Confederate Colonel John Jackson Dickison, who gave them a lifeboat he had taken from a captured federal gunboat. Traveling down the St. Johns River, they reached Fort Butler on May 29. From there, they continued on the St. Johns to Lake Harney where the boat was loaded on a wagon and hauled about to Sand Point (today&#x27;s Titusville) on the Indian River. They reached the river by May 31, but as they followed its course southward, they had to drag the boat across the river&#x27;s mudflats and sandbars. They stopped at the John C. Houston place on Elbow Creek (Melbourne), where their boat was brought ashore and caulked. When the repairs were completed, Colonel John Taylor Wood, again led the party south. Transferring the boat to the Atlantic Ocean near Jupiter Inlet, they continued along the Florida coast and landed near present-day Palm Beach on June 4. Strong winds prevented them from navigating the small craft out to sea, so they continued southward down the coast.

On June 5, the party was spotted by a federal steamer, but convinced the crew they were hunters scavenging the coast. Two days later, they encountered a larger boat with a mast and rigging; chasing it down, they disarmed the occupants and hijacked the craft. As compensation, they gave their old boat and twenty dollars in gold to the owners of the larger craft, and returned some of their weapons after the exchange was complete. With this more seaworthy craft, they decided to flee to Cuba. Departing from Fort Dallas, they survived an encounter with pirates, two significant storms, and a dangerous lack of provisions before arriving in Cárdenas on June 11, 1865. A Kentuckian living in the city recognized Breckinridge, introduced him to the locals, and served as his interpreter. The refugees were given food and stayed the night in a local hotel. The next morning, they traveled by rail to Havana, where Breckinridge was offered a house. He declined the offer, choosing to travel with Charles J. Helm, a fellow Kentuckian who had been operating as a Confederate agent in the Caribbean, to Great Britain.
Arriving in Britain in late July, he consulted with former Confederate agents there and arranged communication with his wife, then in Canada. Re-crossing the Atlantic, he was reunited with his wife and all of his children except Clifton in Toronto on September 13, 1865. The family spent the winter there, living first in a hotel and then in a rented house. There were enough Confederate exiles in the city, according to Mrs. Breckinridge, &quot;to form quite a pleasant society among ourselves.&quot; The family moved to Niagara in May. In August, doctors advised Breckinridge&#x27;s wife that the climate of France might benefit her ailing health. Cabell Breckinridge returned to the U.S. to engage in business ventures with his brother Clifton, and Mary, just 12 years old, was sent to live with relatives in New York. The remainder of the family journeyed to Europe, where the children attended school in Paris, Versailles, and Vevey, Switzerland. From mid-1866 to early 1868, Breckinridge toured Europe and the Middle East– including visits to Germany, Austria, Turkey, Greece, Syria, Egypt, and the Holy Land; because of her poor health, his wife remained in France until February 1868, when she joined him in Naples. During their tour of Italy, Breckinridge met with Pope Pius IX in Rome, and also visited Pompeii.

Desiring to return to the U.S. but still fearing capture, Breckinridge moved his family back to Niagara in June 1868. He steadfastly refused to seek a pardon, although 70 members of the Kentucky General Assembly had requested one on his behalf from President Andrew Johnson on February 10, 1866. On January 8, 1868, the Louisville City Council instructed the state&#x27;s congressional delegation to seek assurance that Breckinridge would not be prosecuted on his return. James Beck, Breckinridge&#x27;s old law partner, was then in Congress and wrote to him on December 11, 1868, that it appeared likely that Johnson would issue a general pardon for all former Confederates; he advised Breckinridge to return to the U.S. before the pardon was issued because he feared it might only apply to those in the country.

==Return to the U.S. and death==
Johnson proclaimed amnesty for all former Confederates on December 25, 1868. Still in Canada, Breckinridge lingered for a few weeks to receive assurance that it still applied to him even though he had not been in the U.S. when it was issued. Departing Canada on February 10, 1869, he made several stops to visit family and friends, arriving in Lexington on March 9. Although he resided in Kentucky for the rest of his life, he never bought a home there after the war, living first in hotels and then renting a home on West Second Street.
Many insurance companies in the south asked Breckinridge to join them. In August 1868, he became manager of the Kentucky branch of Virginia&#x27;s Piedmont Life Insurance Company (which soon became the Piedmont and Arlington Insurance Company). Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) offered him a professorship. He was urged to accept by former Confederate Colonel William Preston Johnston, who was already a faculty member, but Breckinridge declined. He resumed his law practice, taking as a partner Robert A. Thornton, a 27-year-old Confederate veteran. He served as general counsel for the proposed Cincinnati Southern Railway, which would connect Cincinnati to Chattanooga via Lexington. Officials in Louisville tried to block the move, which would break the near-monopoly that the Louisville and Nashville Railroad had on southern trade. On January 25, 1870, he presented his case to the House and Senate railroad committees; although they rejected it at that time, they approved it two years later. Construction began in 1873.

Breckinridge&#x27;s other railroad ventures were less successful. During his lifetime, he was unable to secure the construction of railroads to his real estate investments in and around Superior, Wisconsin. As president of the newly formed Elizabethtown, Lexington, and Big Sandy Railroad company, he secured financial backing from Collis Potter Huntington for a railroad connecting Elizabethtown and Lexington to the Big Sandy River as part of a route linking those cities with the Atlantic Ocean. When Huntington invested in June 1871, he became president of the company, and Breckinridge became vice president. A line from Lexington to Mount Sterling was all that could be completed before the Panic of 1873 dried up the needed investment capital. The proposed line was finally completed in 1881.

Breckinridge refused all requests – including one by President Ulysses S. Grant – to return to politics, insisting, &quot;I no more feel the political excitements that marked the scenes of my former years than if I were an extinct volcano.&quot; Under the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment, a two-thirds vote in each house of Congress would have been needed to allow him to hold office because he had sided with the Confederacy. He never expressed interest in seeking such approval. Speaking as a private citizen in March 1870, he publicly denounced the actions of the Ku Klux Klan. In 1872, he supported passage of a state statute which successfully legalized black testimony against whites in court.
By 1873, Breckinridge began to experience health problems which he referred to as &quot;pleuro-pneumonia&quot;. Repeated surgeries and visits to the New York coast and the Virginia mountains did not improve his condition. In May 1875, he consulted surgeons Lewis Sayre and Samuel D. Gross, who concluded that his ill health was caused by cirrhosis brought on by injuries to his liver suffered during the war. Of more immediate concern was the fluid that filled two-thirds of one of his lungs. On May 11, Sayre attempted to create an artificial opening through which the fluid could drain; although he had to stop before completing the operation, some of the fluid was drained, bringing a measure of relief. Assisted by Beck and Frank K. Hunt, Breckinridge completed his will. Sayre further alleviated Breckinridge&#x27;s pain via another surgery on the morning of May 17, but by the afternoon, his condition rapidly worsened, and he died at approximately 5:45 p.m. at the age of 54. Basil Duke led the funeral procession to Lexington Cemetery where Breckinridge&#x27;s body was buried.

==Legacy==
===Historical reputation===
As a military commander, Breckinridge was highly respected by some. Fellow Confederate George M. Edgar, describing Breckinridge&#x27;s performance, wrote:
On May 20, 1875, the &quot;Louisville Courier Journal&quot; declared that it was Breckinridge who was &quot;truly representative of the rebellion as an actual force and its underlying causes.&quot; He was viewed poorly in the North. The premature &quot;New York Times&quot; 1863 obituary labelled &quot;him one of the basest and wickedest of traitors.&quot;

His strengths included a reputation for dignity and integrity, and especially his tall, graceful and handsome appearance, with cordial manner, pleasing voice and eloquent address that was highly appreciated by voters, soldiers, and women alike. He was hailed as the personification of Kentucky chivalry. Observers said he was a &quot;most noble looking man – a ladies man – such piercing blue eyes I never saw before. His very looks show his superiority over most men.&quot;

===Monuments and memorials===
Despite differences in spelling, the towns of Breckenridge, Minnesota, Breckenridge, Missouri, Breckenridge, Texas, and Breckenridge, Colorado were named in Breckinridge&#x27;s honor. The Colorado town changed the spelling of its name when its namesake joined the Confederacy. Fort Breckinridge, Arizona Territory (1860 to 1865) was named in honor of the Vice President. During the Civil War, its name was changed to Fort Stanford in honor of California Governor Leland Stanford, before being changed back to Fort Breckinridge. After the Civil War, the name was changed once again to Camp Grant. Between 1855 and 1862, the county now known as Lyon County, Kansas, was known as Breckinridge County.

Breckinridge was played by Jason Isaacs in the 2014 film &quot;Field of Lost Shoes&quot;, which depicted the Battle of New Market.

A memorial to Breckinridge was placed on the Fayette County Courthouse lawn in Lexington in 1887. In November 2015, the Urban County Arts Review Board voted to recommend removal of both the Breckinridge statue and one of John Hunt Morgan. Amy Murrell Taylor, the T. Marshall Hahn Jr. Professor of History at the University of Kentucky, claimed that the &quot;statues are not and have never been neutral representations of the Civil War past but instead they are embodiments of a racially charged postwar interpretation of it.&quot; The relocation of the memorial to the Lexington Cemetery was completed in July 2018, funded by private donations. Breckinridge&#x27;s memorial was placed in his family&#x27;s burial area in Section G.

<text>James William Somerville (born 22 June 1961) is a Scottish singer who rose to prominence in the 1980s with the synth-pop groups Bronski Beat and the Communards. With Bronski Beat, Somerville achieved commercial success with the 1984 single &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot; which reached the top spot in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and the US Hot Dance Club Play. Additionally, it reached the top five in the United Kingdom, West Germany, Ireland and New Zealand as well as charting within the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Bronski Beat&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Age of Consent&quot; (1984) was the only release Somerville contributed to as lead vocalist before leaving the band in 1985 and joining The Communards. 

The Communards, with Somerville on lead vocals, released their debut album &quot;Communards&quot; in 1986, spawning the internationally successful single &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot;. It reached the top spot in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands and the US Dance Club Songs. &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot; was the best selling single of 1986 in the United Kingdom. Follow up single, &quot;So Cold the Night&quot;, also achieved commercial success across Europe. Their second studio album &quot;Red&quot; was released in 1987 and continued their chart success. The Communards disbanded in 1988.

Following the disbandment of The Communards, Somerville launched his solo career. He is known in particular for his powerful and soulful countertenor/falsetto singing voice. Many of his songs, such as &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot;, contain political commentary on gay-related issues.

==Early life==
Born on 22 June 1961, James William Somerville grew up in Ruchill, a neighbourhood of northern Glasgow. In 1980, he moved to London, where he lived in squats. He immersed himself in gay culture, and attended the London Gay Teenage Group.

==Career==
===Bronski Beat (1983–1985)===
In 1983, Somerville co-founded the synth-pop group Bronski Beat, which had several hits in the British charts. Their biggest hit was &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot;, which peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart. In the music video Somerville plays the song&#x27;s titular character, who leaves his hostile hometown for the friendlier city, reflecting Somerville&#x27;s own experiences when he moved to London.

Bronski Beat signed a recording contract with London Records in 1984 after doing only nine live gigs. The band&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot;, about a gay teenager leaving his family and fleeing his home town, was a hit, peaking at No 3 in the UK Singles Chart, and topping charts in Belgium and the Netherlands. The single was accompanied by a promotional video directed by Bernard Rose, showing Somerville trying to befriend an attractive diver at a swimming pool, then being attacked by the diver&#x27;s homophobic associates, being returned to his family by the police and having to leave home. (The police officer was played by Colin Bell, then the marketing manager of London Records.) &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot; reached 48 in the U.S. chart and peaked at 8 in Australia.

The follow-up single, &quot;Why?&quot;, adopted a hi-NRG sound and was more lyrically focused on anti-gay prejudice. It also achieved Top 10 status in the UK, reaching 6, and was another Top 10 hit for the band in Australia, Switzerland, Germany, France and the Netherlands. At the end of 1984, the trio released an album titled &quot;The Age of Consent&quot;. The inner sleeve listed the varying ages of consent for consensual gay sex in different nations around the world. At the time, the age of consent for sexual acts between men in the UK was 21 compared with 16 for heterosexual acts, with several other countries having more liberal laws on gay sex. The album peaked at 4 in the UK Albums Chart, 36 in the U.S., and 12 in Australia.

===The Communards and solo (1985–1991)===

Somerville left Bronski Beat in 1985 and formed The Communards with classically-trained pianist Richard Coles, who became a Church of England vicar and broadcaster. They had several hits, including a cover version of Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes&#x27; &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot;, which spent four weeks at No. 1 in the UK charts and became the biggest-selling single of 1986 in the UK. He also sang backing vocals on Fine Young Cannibals&#x27; version of &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot;, which was a UK Top 10 hit.

The Communards split in 1988; Somerville began a solo career the following year. He released his debut solo album &quot;Read My Lips&quot; in November 1989, which contained three UK Top 30 hits, including a hit cover of Sylvester&#x27;s disco song &quot;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)&quot; and a cover of &quot;Comment te dire adieu?&quot;, a duet with June Miles-Kingston, which reached number 14 in the UK Singles chart. He also sang on the second Band Aid project at the end of 1989.

In November 1990, Somerville&#x27;s greatest-hits album &quot;The Singles Collection 1984/1990&quot; (which featured his hits with Bronski Beat and The Communards in addition to his own material) was released; it reached number 4 on the UK Album Chart. It included a reggae cover of the Bee Gees&#x27; hit song &quot;To Love Somebody&quot;, which also reached the UK Top 10. Also in 1990, Somerville contributed the song &quot;From This Moment On&quot; to the Cole Porter tribute album &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization, the proceeds from which benefited AIDS research.

=== &quot;Dare to Love&quot; and other works (1991–1997)===
In 1991, Somerville provided backing vocals to a track called &quot;Why Aren&#x27;t You in Love With Me?&quot; from the album &quot;Ripe&quot; by Communards offshoot band Banderas. The Banderas duo, Caroline Buckley and Sally Herbert, had previously been part of Somerville&#x27;s backing band. After this, he disappeared from the limelight for several years. He returned in 1995 with the album &quot;Dare to Love&quot;, which included &quot;Heartbeat&quot; (a UK Top 30 hit and a No. 1 hit on the US dance chart), &quot;Hurt So Good&quot; and &quot;By Your Side&quot;, though commercial success was now beginning to elude him and his contract with London Records to which he had been signed for over a decade came to an end.

===&quot;Manage the Damage&quot; and recent activity (1997–present)===
A new single, &quot;Dark Sky&quot;, was released in 1997 and peaked at No. 66 in the UK. In the same year he provided vocals on &quot;The Number One Song in Heaven&quot; for the Sparks album &quot;Plagiarism&quot; with production by Tony Visconti. His third album, entitled &quot;Manage The Damage&quot;, was released in 1999 via Gut Records, but failed to chart. A companion remix album, &quot;Root Beer&quot;, came out in 2000. His dance-orientated fourth solo album, &quot;Home Again&quot;, was released in 2004, again not charting.

In May 2009, Somerville release the &quot;Suddenly Last Summer&quot; album, which contained acoustic interpretations of other people&#x27;s songs. The album was initially only available as a digital download but in May 2010 was made available in a limited edition (3,000 copies) CD/DVD in the UK. In late 2010, Somerville released a dance EP called &quot;Bright Thing&quot;. 2010&#x27;s EP &quot;Bright Thing&quot; was the first of a series of three, with Somerville releasing &quot;Momentum&quot; in 2011 and &quot;Solent&quot; in 2012, with long-term collaborator John Winfield.

Somerville released a disco-inspired album called &quot;Homage&quot; in 2015. Singles were &quot;Back to Me&quot; followed by &quot;Travesty&quot;. The emphasis in recording the album was on achieving the musical authenticity of original disco which Somerville grew up listening to. He stated: &quot;I&#x27;ve finally made the disco album I always wanted to and never thought I could.&quot;

He has also had an acting career, appearing in Sally Potter&#x27;s 1992 film of Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;Orlando&quot;, in Isaac Julien&#x27;s 1989 &quot;Looking for Langston&quot;, and in an episode of the cult science fiction television series &quot;Lexx&quot; (&quot;Girltown&quot;).

In February 2021, Somerville teamed up with producer Sally Herbert (formerly of 1990s duo Banderas and also part of The Communards&#x27; backing band) to record a cover of &quot;Everything Must Change&quot; by Benard Ighner as a charity record for End Youth Homelessness, a network of projects which includes Centrepoint in London and a number of other homeless charity organisations around the UK.

<text>Schuyler Colfax Jr. ( ; March 23, 1823January 13, 1885) was an American journalist, businessman, and politician who served as the 17th vice president of the United States from 1869 to 1873, and prior to that as the 25th speaker of the House of Representatives from 1863 to 1869. Originally a Whig, then part of the short-lived People&#x27;s Party of Indiana, and later a Republican, he was the U.S. representative for from 1855 to 1869.

Born in New York City, Colfax was known for his opposition to slavery while serving in Congress, and was a founder of the Republican Party. During his first term as speaker, he led the effort to pass the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolished slavery. When it came before the House for a final vote in January 1865, he emphasized his support by casting a vote in favor—by convention the speaker votes only to break a tie. Chosen as Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s running mate in the 1868 election, the pair won easily over Democratic Party nominees Horatio Seymour and Francis Preston Blair Jr. As was typical during the 19th century, Colfax had little involvement in the Grant administration. In addition to his duties as president of the U.S. Senate, he continued to lecture and write for the press while in office. Believing Grant would only serve one term, in 1870, Colfax attempted unsuccessfully to garner support for the 1872 Republican presidential nomination by telling friends and supporters he would not seek a second vice presidential term. When Grant announced that he would run again, Colfax reversed himself and attempted to win the vice-presidential nomination, but it was given to Henry Wilson.

An 1872–73 congressional investigation into the Crédit Mobilier scandal identified Colfax as one of several federal government officials who, in 1868, had accepted payments of cash and discounted stock from the Union Pacific Railroad in exchange for favorable action during the construction of the transcontinental railroad. Though he vociferously defended himself against charges, his reputation suffered. Colfax left the vice presidency at the end of his term in March 1873, and never again ran for office. Afterward, he worked as a business executive and became a popular lecturer and speechmaker.

Colfax suffered a heart attack and died at a railroad station in Mankato, Minnesota, on January 13, 1885, while &quot;en route&quot; to a speaking engagement in Iowa. He is one of only two persons to have served as both speaker of the House and vice president, the other being John Nance Garner.

==Early life==

Schuyler Colfax Jr. was born in New York City on March 23, 1823, the son of Schuyler Colfax Sr. (1792–1822), a bank teller, and Hannah Stryker (1805–1872), both of English and Dutch ancestry, who had married on April 25, 1820. His grandfather, William Colfax, served in George Washington&#x27;s Life Guard during the American Revolution and married Hester Schuyler, the second great-granddaughter of Philip Pieterse Schuyler. and a cousin of General Philip Schuyler. William Colfax became a general in the New Jersey Militia after the Revolution and commanded a brigade during the War of 1812.

Schuyler Colfax Sr. contracted tuberculosis and died on October 30, 1822, five months before Colfax was born. His sister Mary died in July 1823, four months after he was born. After the senior Colfax&#x27;s death, Colfax&#x27;s mother and grandmother ran a boarding house as their primary means of economic support. Colfax attended school in New York City until he was 10, when family financial difficulties caused him to end his formal education and take a job as a clerk in the store of George W. Matthews.

Colfax&#x27;s mother married George Matthews in 1834, and the family moved to New Carlisle, Indiana, where Matthews ran a store that also served as the village post office. There, Colfax became an avid reader of newspapers and books. The family moved again, in 1841, to nearby South Bend, Indiana, after Matthews became St. Joseph County Auditor. He appointed Colfax as his deputy, a post that Colfax held throughout the eight years Matthews was in office.

==Newspaper editor==
In 1842, Colfax became the editor of the pro-Whig &quot;South Bend Free Press,&quot; owned by John D. Defrees. When Defrees moved to Indianapolis the following year and purchased the &quot;Indiana Journal&quot;, he hired Colfax to cover the Indiana Senate for the &quot;Journal&quot;. In addition to covering the state senate, Colfax contributed articles on Indiana politics to the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, leading to a friendship with its editor, Horace Greeley.

In 1845, Colfax purchased the &quot;South Bend Free Press&quot; and changed its name to the &quot;St. Joseph Valley Register&quot;. He owned the &quot;Register&quot; for nine years, at first in support of the Whigs, then shifting to the newly established Republican Party.

==Whig Party politician==
While covering the Indiana Senate as a journalist, Colfax also served as the Whig Party&#x27;s assistant enrolling clerk from 1842 to 1844. In 1843, several South Bend residents formed a debating society in which members researched and discussed current events and other topics of interest, and Colfax became a prominent member. The organization&#x27;s success led it to create a moot state legislature, in which members introduced, debated, and voted on bills in accordance with the rules of the Indiana General Assembly. As with the debating society, Colfax was a prominent member of South Bend&#x27;s moot legislature.

Colfax&#x27;s success in the debating society and moot legislature made him prominent enough to take part in politics, and he was selected as a delegate to the 1848 Whig National Convention, where he was selected as one of the gathering&#x27;s secretaries and supported Zachary Taylor for the presidency. He was next elected as a delegate to Indiana&#x27;s 1849–1850 state constitutional convention. Colfax was the 1851 Whig nominee for Congress in the district which included South Bend, but narrowly lost to his Democratic opponent, primarily because he voted against a measure at the constitutional convention that stopped free African Americans from moving to Indiana.

In 1852, Colfax was a delegate to the Whig National Convention and was selected to serve as a convention secretary. He supported Winfield Scott for president, and after Scott was nominated, Colfax took an active part in the campaign, by making speeches and authoring and distributing newspaper articles and editorials. In 1852, Colfax&#x27;s political supporters encouraged him to make a second run for the U.S. House, but he declined.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1855–1869)==
In 1854, Colfax ran for Congress again, this time as nominee of the short-lived Indiana People&#x27;s Party, an anti-slavery movement which formed to oppose the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Colfax won and was reelected six times, representing Indiana&#x27;s 9th congressional district from March 4, 1855, to March 3, 1869. During his House service, Colfax became a member of the leadership as chairman of the Committee on Post Office and Post Roads, a post he held from 1859 to 1863.

===Know Nothing party affiliation===
In 1855, Colfax considered joining the Know Nothing Party because of the antislavery plank in its platform. He was chosen as a delegate to the party&#x27;s June convention without his knowledge. He had mixed feelings about the party and later denied being a member. Although he agreed with many of its policies, he disapproved of its secrecy oath and citizenship test. By the time of his 1856 campaign for re-election, the new Republican Party had become the main anti-slavery party, and Colfax became an early member.

===Opposition to slavery===
Colfax was identified with the Radical Republicans in Congress and was an energetic opponent of slavery. His June 21, 1856, &quot;Kansas Code&quot; speech attacking laws passed by the proslavery Legislature in Kansas became the most widely requested Republican campaign document. Then, as the 1860 presidential election approached, Colfax traveled frequently, delivered many speeches, and helped bind the various Republican and antislavery factions together into a unified party that could win the presidency.

===Civil War===
Before Lincoln&#x27;s inauguration, Colfax&#x27;s name was put forward by Indiana Republicans for appointment as postmaster general. President Lincoln wrote him a warm letter stating that he considered him qualified and foretelling &quot;a bright future&quot; for the 37-year-old, but that he had already promised a cabinet position to another Hoosier, Caleb Blood Smith.

At the start of the Civil War, Major General John C. Frémont commanded Union Army forces in St. Louis, Missouri. On September 3, 1861, Confederate General Sterling Price defeated Union Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon at the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek. During the battle, Price&#x27;s Confederate troops under Leonidas Polk occupied Columbus, Kentucky. Frémont was blamed for not reinforcing Lyon, who had been killed in the fighting. On September 6, Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant, under Frémont&#x27;s authority, took Paducah without a fight and established a Union supply base in Kentucky. Colfax, concerned over the Confederate Army&#x27;s occupation of Kentucky and threatened Union security of Missouri, decided to visit Frémont.

After his arrival in St. Louis, Colfax met Frémont on September 14, 1861, and petitioned him to send troops to cut off Price from capturing Lexington. Colfax believed Frémont had 20,000 troops under his command in St. Louis. Frémont informed Colfax that he only had 8,000 troops in St. Louis and was unable to spare any. In addition, Frémont told Colfax that Lincoln and federal authorities in Washington had requested him to dispatch 5,000 of his troops elsewhere. Colfax suggested that Frémont reply that he could not spare any troops or Missouri would be lost to the Confederacy. Frémont declined, recognizing that he had a reputation for being insubordinate because he had earlier imposed a controversial August 30 edict that put Missouri under martial law and emancipated rebel slaves beyond what was included in Lincoln&#x27;s Confiscation Act, and not wanting to appear unwilling to follow the instructions of his superiors. Price captured Lexington on September 20 and threatened to take the whole state of Missouri. Frémont finally responded on September 29, arriving at Sedalia with 38,000 troops and threatening to trap the rebels against the Missouri River. Price abandoned Lexington, and soon was forced to abandon the state and headed to Arkansas and later Mississippi.

On November 1, seven weeks after Colfax&#x27;s visit, Frémont ordered Grant to make demonstrations along the Mississippi against the Confederates, but not to directly engage the enemy. The following day Frémont was relieved from command by Lincoln for refusing to revoke his August 30 edict. On November 7, Grant attacked Belmont drawing Confederate troops from Columbus and inflicting Confederate casualties. In February 1862, Grant, in combination with the Union navy, captured Confederate Forts Henry and Donelson, forcing Polk to abandon Columbus. The Confederate army was finally pushed out of Kentucky after Union General Don Carlos Buell defeated Confederate General Braxton Bragg at the Battle of Perryville in October 1862.

===Speaker of the House===
Colfax faced a difficult reelection campaign in 1862 due to strong antiwar sentiments in Indiana, but won a narrow victory over Democrat David Turpie. Among the incumbents defeated that year was Speaker of the House Galusha Grow. When the 38th Congress convened in December 1863, Colfax was elected speaker, despite President Lincoln&#x27;s preference for someone less tied to the Radical Republicans. Altogether, Colfax was elected speaker for three congresses:
*38th Congress Schuyler Colfax (R–IN) – 101 (55.50%) Samuel S. Cox (D–OH) – 42 (23.08%) &quot;Others&quot; – 39 (21.42%)
*39th Congress Schuyler Colfax (R–IN) – 139 (79.43%) James Brooks (D–NY) – 36 (20.57%)
*40th Congress Schuyler Colfax (R–IN) – 127 (80.89%) Samuel S. Marshall (D–IL) – 30 (19.11%)

During his first term as speaker, Colfax presided over the establishment of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, and helped secure congressional passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, which, when ratified by the states, abolished slavery. Though it is unusual for the speaker to vote, except to break a tie, Colfax directed the clerk to call his name after the roll call vote had been taken. He then cast the final vote in favor of the amendment to much applause from its supporters in the House.

===Reconstruction===
In 1865, Colfax, along with author Samuel Bowles and Illinois Lieutenant Governor William Bross, set out across the western territories from Mississippi to the California coast to record their experiences. They compiled their observations in an 1869 book called &quot;Our New West&quot;. Included in their book were details of the views of Los Angeles, with its wide panorama of vast citrus groves and orchards, and conversations with Brigham Young.

On September 17, 1867, Colfax, along with Senator John Sherman, addressed a Republican meeting in Lebanon, Ohio on the political situation in Washington. Colfax said he was firmly against allowing those who participated in the Confederate rebellion to be reinstated in office and control Republican Reconstruction policy. Colfax affirmed that he was not in any way for repudiating the debt caused by the Confederate rebellion. Colfax said Congressional reconstruction would give security and peace to the nation as opposed to President Johnson and his southern Democratic policies. Colfax favored Johnson&#x27;s impeachment saying Johnson was recreant, a usurper, and was unfaithful in executing the Reconstruction laws of the land in granting a general amnesty to Southerners who had participated in the rebellion. Colfax told Republicans who were tired of Reconstruction to leave the party and join the Democrats.

===Election of 1868===
During the 1868 Republican Convention the Republicans nominated Ulysses S. Grant for president. Colfax was selected for vice president on the fifth ballot. Colfax was popular among Republicans for his friendly character, party loyalty, and Radical views on Reconstruction. Among Republicans he was known as &quot;Smiler Colfax&quot;. Grant won the general election, and Colfax was elected the 17th Vice President of the United States.

On March 3, 1869, the final full day of the 40th Congress, Colfax, who was to be sworn into office as vice president the next day, resigned as speaker. Immediately afterward, the House passed a motion declaring Theodore Pomeroy duly elected speaker in place of Colfax. In office for one day, Pomeroy&#x27;s tenure is the shortest of any speaker of the U.S. House.

==Vice presidency (1869–1873)==

Colfax was inaugurated March 4, 1869, and served until March 4, 1873. Grant and Colfax, 46 and 45 respectively at the time of their inauguration, were the youngest presidential and vice presidential team until the inauguration of Bill Clinton and Al Gore in 1993.

Colfax and John Nance Garner, the first vice president under Franklin Roosevelt, are the only two vice presidents to have been Speaker of the House of Representatives prior to becoming vice president, and since the vice president is the President of the Senate, they are the only two people to have served as the presiding officers of both Houses of Congress.

===Italian unity===
On Friday, January 6, 1871, in a letter from Washington, D.C., published in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Colfax recognized and rejoiced in King Victor Emmanuel II&#x27;s victory of unifying Italy and setting up a new government in Rome. Colfax encouraged Italy to form a Republican government that protected religious freedom, regardless of faith, and the civil rights of all individuals, including those who lived in poverty. Colfax said, &quot;for out of this new life of civil and religious liberty will flow peace and happiness, progress and prosperity, with material and national development, and advancement as surely as healthy springs flow from fountains of purity.&quot;

===Election of 1872===

Prior to the 1872 Presidential election, Colfax believed that Grant would only serve one term as president. In 1870, Colfax announced he would not run for political office in 1872. Colfax&#x27;s announcement failed to garner prominent support among Republicans for a presidential bid, as he had planned, while Grant decided to run for a second term. In addition, Liberal Republican interest in Colfax as a possible presidential candidate alienated him from Grant and the regular Republicans. (The Liberal Republicans believed that the Grant administration was corrupt and were against Grant&#x27;s attempted annexation of Santo Domingo.) Colfax changed his mind and decided to run for the Republican nomination for vice president. He told his supporters that he would accept the nomination if it was given to him. However, Colfax&#x27;s previously stated intent not to run in 1872 had created the possibility of a contested nomination, and Senator Henry Wilson defeated Colfax by 399.5 delegates to 321.5. Grant went on to win election to a second term, and Wilson became the 18th vice president of the United States.

===Crédit Mobilier scandal===
In September 1872, during the presidential campaign, Colfax&#x27;s reputation was marred by a &quot;New York Sun&quot; article which indicated that he was involved in the Crédit Mobilier scandal. Colfax was one of several representatives and senators (mostly Republicans), who were offered (and possibly took) bribes of cash and discounted shares in the Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Crédit Mobilier subsidiary in 1868 from Congressman Oakes Ames for votes favorable to the Union Pacific during the building of the First transcontinental railroad. Henry Wilson was among those accused, but after initially denying a connection, he provided a complicated explanation to a Senate investigating committee, which involved his wife having purchased shares with her own money, and then later canceling the transaction over concerns about its propriety. Wilson&#x27;s reputation for integrity was somewhat dampened, but not enough to prevent him from becoming vice president.
Colfax also denied involvement to the press, and defended himself in person before a House investigative committee, testifying in January 1873 that he had never received a dividend check from Ames. Despite his protests of innocence, the congressional investigation revealed that in 1868 Colfax had taken a $1,200 (~$ in ) gift check for 20 shares of Crédit Mobilier stock from Ames. Colfax had deposited $1,200 in his bank account at the same time Ames recorded that he had paid Colfax $1,200. Making matters worse for Colfax, the investigation also revealed that Colfax had received a $4,000 (~$ in ) gift also in 1868 from a contractor who supplied envelopes to the federal government while Colfax was chairman of the Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads, and so had influence in the awarding of such contracts. Afterward, a resolution to impeach the vice president was introduced in the House, but failed to pass by a mostly party-line vote, mainly because the incidents took place during his tenure as congressman (not as vice president), and because just a few weeks remained in his term.

His political career ruined, Colfax left office under a cloud at the end of his term, and never ran for office again. His only consolation on that bitterly cold March day was a hand-written letter from Ulysses Grant. In it, the president wrote,

==Post vice-presidency (1873–1885)==

===Lecturer and business executive===
After leaving office in March 1873, Colfax began to recover his reputation, embarking on a successful career as a traveling lecturer offering speeches on a variety of topics. His most requested presentation was one on the life of Abraham Lincoln, whom the nation had begun to turn into an icon. With an expanding population that desired to know more details and context about Lincoln&#x27;s life and career, an oration from someone who had known him personally was an attraction audiences were willing to pay to hear, and Colfax delivered his Lincoln lecture hundreds of times to positive reviews.

In 1875, he became vice president of the Indiana Reaper and Iron Company. On February 12, 1875, having returned to Washington, D.C., to give a lecture, he advised his friends in Congress who were frustrated over the slow pace of action: &quot;Ah! the way to get out of politics is to get out of politics.&quot;

He had remained popular in his home area, and was often encouraged to run again for public office, but he always declined. Finally, in April 1882, when pressed to consider becoming a candidate for his old U.S. House seat in the upcoming election, Colfax announced in a letter to the &quot;South Bend Tribune&quot; that, while he deeply appreciated how much his friends wanted him to run for public office again, he was satisfied by the 20 years of service he had given during the &quot;stormiest years of our nation&#x27;s history.&quot; He also said that he was enjoying his life as a private citizen, and would neither be a candidate nor accept any nomination for any office in the future, stating that his &quot;only ambition now is to go in and out among my townsmen as a private citizen during what years of life may remain for me to enjoy on this earth&quot;.

===Death and burial===

On January 13, 1885, Colfax walked from Mankato, Minnesota&#x27;s Front Street depot to the Omaha depot, about three-quarters of a mile (1 kilometer) in weather, intending to change trains on his way to Rock Rapids, Iowa, to give a speech. Five minutes after arriving, Colfax died of a heart attack brought on by the extreme cold and exhaustion.

He was buried at City Cemetery in South Bend. A historical marker in Mankato&#x27;s Washington Park, site of the former depot, marks the spot where he died.

==Personal life==

Colfax was married twice:
* On October 10, 1844, he married his childhood friend Evelyn Clark. She died in 1863; they had no children.
* On November 18, 1868, two weeks after winning the vice presidency, he married Ellen (Ella) M. Wade (1836–1911), a niece of Senator Benjamin Wade. They had one son, Schuyler Colfax III (1870–1925), who served as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, from 1898 to 1901. He assumed office at the age of 28, and remains the youngest person to become mayor in the city&#x27;s history.

Colfax was a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF). In 1850, Colfax and members William T. Martin of Mississippi and E. G. Steel of Tennessee were appointed to prepare a ritual pertaining to the Rebekah Degree and present a report at the 1851 annual meeting. On September 20, 1851, the IOOF approved the degree and Colfax was credited as its author and founder.

In 1854 Colfax was initiated into the Beta Theta Pi fraternity at DePauw University as an honorary member.

Colfax was initiated into the fraternity of Free &amp; Accepted Masons as an Entered Apprentice at Washington D.C.&#x27;s Lebanon Lodge No. 7 on August 15, 1856. He completed his Fellow Craft and Master Mason degrees at St. Joseph Lodge No. 45 in South Bend, Indiana, however, he was not an especially active member. After failing to continue paying his dues, he was dropped from the rolls of Lebanon Lodge on December 16, 1864.

==Historical reputation==
Colfax&#x27;s 20 years of public service ended in controversy in 1873 due to the revelation that he was involved in the Crédit Mobilier scandal. He never returned to seek political office in part because he believed that it was best to stay out of politics once leaving office, and in part because he was content with his life as a private citizen. Because of his success as a lecturer, his reputation was somewhat restored.

The Revenue Cutter Service commissioned and named an iron-framed side-wheel steamer after Colfax in 1871. It served along the Atlantic Coast and hosted President McKinley aboard prior to her decommissioning in 1899.
Towns in the U.S. states of California, North Carolina, Illinois, Washington, Wisconsin, Indiana, Iowa, Texas, and Louisiana are named after him. Schuyler, Nebraska, named after Colfax, is the county seat of Colfax County, Nebraska. The ghost town of Colfax, Colorado, was named after him, as was Colfax County, New Mexico.

Colfax Avenue in South Bend is named in his honor. Colfax&#x27;s home of his adult years stood on that street, at 601 W. Market St. The city later renamed the street in his honor. The Colfax home was demolished and, , an Evangelical Presbyterian Church church stands on the spot. There is another Colfax Avenue in Mishawaka, Indiana, the city just east of South Bend. There is also a Colfax Avenue in the Grant City section of Staten Island, one of the boroughs of New York City. The main east–west street traversing Aurora, Denver, and Lakewood, Colorado, and abutting the Colorado State Capitol is named Colfax Avenue in the politician&#x27;s honor; it is also known as the longest continuous commercial street in the U.S. There is also a Colfax Place in the Highland Square neighborhood in Akron, Ohio; in Minneapolis, Minnesota; in Roselle Park, New Jersey; and a Colfax Street on Chicago&#x27;s South Side. There is a Colfax Street in Springdale, Pennsylvania, that leads up Mt. Colfax as well as one in Palatine, Illinois, in Evanston, Illinois, and in Jamestown, New York. Dallas, Texas, and one of its suburbs, Richardson, each have separate residential roads named Colfax Drive. There is also a Colfax Avenue in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles and in Concord, California, as well as in Benton Harbor, Michigan.

Colfax School was built in South Bend and opened in 1898 just a few blocks from the Schuyler Colfax home. The school building still stands, as of 2019, at 914 Lincoln Way West, although it is no longer a school and today is known as Colfax Cultural Center. In the 1950s and 1960s, one of the downtown movie theaters was The Colfax. There is a Colfax Elementary School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Schuyler-Colfax House in Wayne, New Jersey, which was built by Colfax&#x27;s ancestors, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

The Schuyler Colfax monument in Colfax, California was made in his honor. There is another statue of Colfax in Indianapolis, Indiana.

==Media portrayals==
Actor Bill Raymond portrayed Colfax during his time as Speaker in the 2012 Steven Spielberg film &quot;Lincoln&quot;. Raymond was in his early seventies when the film was made while Colfax was in his early forties during the period depicted in the film.

<text>Laima is a Baltic goddess of fate. She was associated with childbirth, marriage, and death; she was also the patron of pregnant women. Laima and her functions are similar to the Hindu goddess Lakshmi.

==In Latvia==
In Latvian mythology, Laima and her sisters, Kārta and Dēkla, were a trinity of fate deities, similar to the Norse Norns or the Greek Moirai. Laima makes the final decision on individual&#x27;s fate and is considerably more popular. While all three of them had similar functions, Laima is the Goddess of luck and is more related with mothers and childbirth, Dēkla is in charge of children, and Kārta holds power over the adult&#x27;s life. In modern Dievturi these three goddesses are referred to as the three Laimas, indicating they are the same deity in three different aspects. Birth rituals at the end of the 19th century included offerings of hen, sheep, towels or other woven materials to Laima. Only women could participate in the ritual, performed in a sauna (&quot;pirtis&quot;).

==In Lithuania==
In Lithuanian mythology, Laima (fate, destiny) is often confused with Laimė (good fortune) and Laumė (fairy). Other related deities include Dalia (fate) and Giltinė (The Reaper). Laima was first mentioned in written sources as &quot;Laimelea&quot; by Wilhelm Martini in the Latin prologue to Lithuanian songs, collected by Daniel Klein and published in 1666. She was also mentioned by Matthäus Prätorius, Jacob Brodowski, Philipp Ruhig and others.

One of the most important duties of Laima is to prophesy (Lithuanian: &quot;lemti&quot;) how the life of a newborn will take place. Sometimes there was only one Laima, while in other cases three Laimas would give often contradictory predictions. The final pronouncement would be irrevocable and not even Laima herself could change it. While three fate goddesses have less support among academics, the concept is well-established in European religions (e.g. Greek Moirai). In the earlier historiography, the example of predestination by Laima was used to judge the Lithuanian religion as fatalistic. For example, in 1837 Manfred Tietz wrote that, because Lithuanians believed in the determined fate, they were fearless warriors. Algirdas Julien Greimas argued that such a view is superficial and that Laima did not determine the fate but only knew about it.
In one Lithuanian version of the Great Flood myth, Laima participates in the birth of the humankind.

Laima was related to Gegutė (cuckoo), which Greimas considered a separate goddess while others see her as an incarnation of Laima. Gegutė was responsible for time and the succession of the seasons. The number of her calls was believed to predict how long a person had left to live. In spring she would also determine how a person would spend the remainder of the year; for example, if a man had no money on him when he heard the cuckoo, he would be poor for the rest of the year. Laima&#x27;s sacred tree is the linden.

==In modern culture==
The Lithuanian folk music group Kūlgrinda released an album in 2014 titled &quot;Laimos Giesmės&quot;, meaning &quot;The Hymns of Laima&quot;.

<doc id="89159" wikidata="Q187448" url="?curid=89159" title="Latvian mythology">
<text>Latvian mythology is the collection of myths that have emerged throughout the history of Latvia, sometimes being elaborated upon by successive generations, and at other times being rejected and replaced by other explanatory narratives. These myths, for the most part, likely stem from Proto-Indo-European practices and the later folk traditions of the Latvian people and pre-Christian Baltic mythology.

Latvian mythology is used particularly as a tool for reconstructing and analysing the historical pagan beliefs and national identity of Latvia.

The minute details of most, if not all of these myths vary per region, and sometimes even per family.

==History==
===13th–18th century===
There are few reports of Baltic tribes, the ancestors of modern Latvians, and their mythology until Christianization in the 13th century. Since Christianization, there have been several reports related to local mythology including chronicles, travel reports, visitation records, Jesuit reports and other accounts of pagan practices. These reports are considered secondary sources by researchers because since the authors were not Latvian, they did not speak the local languages and often were biased. These materials are sometimes imprecise and contain errors, fabrications, and distortions stemming from a Christian world view. Despite this, they can often be verified using information from folklore.

=== 18th – early 20th century ===
Most folklore materials have been collected since the mid-19th century. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it was assumed that Baltic tribes were originally one nation and thus had the same deities. Early authors tried to reconstruct a Latvian pantheon using data from neighboring regions. This trend was later also adopted by Latvian national romanticists. After the abolition of serfdom, a new national identity was forming and authors sought to prove that Baltic cultural traditions were as deep as those of other nations. It was hoped that a grand epic could be constructed using pieces preserved in folklore. It was also thought that the ancient religion, forgotten during 700 years of oppression, could be reconstructed. However, folklore sources proved insufficient for the task. Some attempted to reconstruct pantheons to be as impressive as in Greek mythology, which led to some deities being simply invented. Besides the assumption that deities of other Baltic peoples must be Latvian as well but were simply lost over time, many new deities were modeled after Greek and Roman deities. An example of the trend is the epic poem Lāčplēsis by Andrejs Pumpurs, which features a pantheon of Latvian and Prussian gods and some the author has invented himself. Similarly, works of Juris Alunāns and poet Miķelis Krogzemis feature pantheons of invented deities.

At the same time, some pagan rites were still practiced. And, as Christianity was seen as alien, attempts were made to recreate the ancient religion. The most successful of the neopagan movements was Dievturi, established in the late 1920s, which claims that ancient Latvians were monotheistic and the various mythological beings are all aspects of one God. While the notion of needing to remove alien influences to reconstruct Latvian traditions was preserved into later times, the attempts to create an Olympus-like pantheon of pseudo-gods eventually stopped as national romanticism was replaced by realism and came to be criticized in the first half of 20th century. It was also suspected that some of the folklore materials might have been falsified. The research of this time is characterised not only by skepticism but also with attempts to seek foreign influences.

===1944–1970s===

After the Soviet re-occupation of Latvia in 1944, research of mythology and especially religious concepts was banned in Latvia. Similarly, members of neopagan groups were persecuted as paganism was considered chauvinistic. Despite this, research was continued by Latvians in exile, who focused on the mythology of folk songs. The songs were already seen as the best source for mythology research during the interwar period. The reason was that since the need to preserve poetic metre and melody limited possible changes, it was thought that ancient notions were better preserved in them than in other genres of folklore. Accordingly, folk songs were the only source for research for a long time. This approach has been criticized by modern researchers who have proposed that themes mentioned in other genres, such as fairy tales, legends, and records of folk beliefs and magic practices, might complement folk songs as each genre contains different themes and might provide only partial insight into mythology.

=== 1970s–present ===
Although research in Latvia could only restart in the 1980s, the 1970s saw the emergence of a folklore movement with members that could be described as neopagans. These groups were pantheistic, less uniform, less dogmatic, interested in the protection of nature and cultural heritage, and more open to the influence of traditions from neighboring nations. Later, marginal movements have explored spirituality in both local traditions and religious and spiritual practices of the world, such as Eastern religions. For example, was announced to be an ancient sacral site by one of these groups in the late 1990s, and it attracts thousands of visitors each season. Dievturi, which resumed operating in Latvia just before the restoration of independence in 1990, is the only officially recognized pagan religion and had around 600 followers . Given the decreasing influence of the movement, its name is sometimes applied in a broader sense to any modern practice related to folklore.

==Beings and concepts==
=== Celestial deities ===
There are various reconstructions of Latvian mythical space, but most researchers agree on the meaning of certain features related to the sky. The sky itself is identified as &quot;Debeskalns&quot; (&quot;Sky Mountain&quot;). The sky is also referred to as &quot;Oļu kalns&quot; (&quot;Mountain of Pebbles&quot;), &quot;Sudraba kalns&quot; (&quot;Silver Mountain&quot;) or &quot;Ledus kalns&quot; (&quot;Ice Mountain&quot;), with the adjectives, probably referring to stars or snow. It has also been suggested that Dievs (&quot;God&quot;) is also a symbol of the sky because the etymology of his name seems to be related to the sky. Dievs is considered to be the supreme deity. Another celestial deity is the goddess of the sun, Saule, whose name literally translates to &quot;the sun&quot;, she ensured the fertility of the earth and was the guardian of the unlucky, especially for orphans and young shepherds. Her path leads her across the mountain of sky to the sea, which is sometimes interpreted as a symbolic representation of the sky or cosmic ocean. The sea and other bodies of water, including rivers, especially Daugava, seem to mark the boundary between worlds of the living and the dead. In Latvian, the word for &quot;the world&quot; is derived from the word for the Sun and these worlds are referred to as &quot;this sun&quot; and &quot;that sun&quot;. Therefore, it seems that Saule is also closely related to the concept of death. She apparently carries the souls of the dead across the sea to the world of the dead. Her daily movement can thus be related to the cycle of human life with her being reborn every day.

On the path of the Sun, in or by the water, often on an island or rock in middle of the seas, is the Austras koks (tree of dawn) thought to represent world tree or axis mundi, it is usually described as a tree, but can also be variety of other plants or even objects. Nobody has ever seen the tree, although folklore purports that many have searched all their lives. Still it has been suggested that its natural counterpart might be the polar star or the Milky Way. It has also been proposed it might be a symbol for the year. The tree is related to celestial wedding mythos in which sun or her daughter is courted by Dieva dēli (sons of god), Auseklis (Venus) or Pērkons (Thunder).

Also, as in Latvian the word for daughter (meita) also stands for maiden, it is uncertain who exactly is getting married. However, this does not affect how mythical events transpire. The male deities spy on the solar deity at the world tree, prepare a bath for her, tease her and so on. Eventually, she is abducted and wed. Saule&#x27;s husband is the moon god Mēness. Pērkons strikes the world tree, has weeping Saule pick up bits for three years and then reassembles them, finishing with the very tip, on the fourth year.

===Afterlife===
The world of the dead is called &quot;Aizsaule&quot; or &quot;Viņsaule&quot; (&quot;The Other Sun&quot;, where the sun goes at night). It is related to various mother deities (or perhaps one referred to by several names): &quot;Zemes māte&quot; (Mother of Earth), sometimes referred to as &quot;Nāve&quot;, literally meaning &quot;death&quot;; &quot;Veļu māte&quot; (Mother of Wraiths), &quot;Kapu māte&quot; (Mother of Graves), and &quot;Smilšu māte&quot; (Mother of Sand). Zemes mate is portrayed as wearing a long robe in all white and occasionally has a scythe or sickle.

&quot;Jods&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;velni&quot;), the equivalent to Satan, is a being usually portrayed as being on par with other deities. Unlike velni, Jods is purely evil. He is said to have taken part in the creation of the world and living things. Jods steals people away to take them to his world. In this he is similar to other spirits who kill people, including Veļi who were believed to sometimes come back to claim a life of a person they knew in their lifetime. The dead - called &quot;Veļi&quot; (also &quot;Iļģi&quot;, &quot;Dieviņi&quot;, &quot;Pauri&quot;) - were considered to be visiting their old homes during autumn from Miķeļi (September 29) to Mārtiņi (November 10). A Jesuit report from the end of 16th century suggests that historically a funeral procession was led by a person waving the axe to protect the deceased from Veļi coming to him too fast. The deceased was buried with items of trade to be able to secure livelihood in the afterlife. Bread and beer was also given. In autumn the souls were invited back home for a feast. The house would be clean and a table with foods set. At the beginning of the feast, an elder would invite Veļi by calling the names of all the dead who once lived in the house the living could remember. He would then give a speech scolding them for not having protected the house well enough, ask them to do better next year and then invite them to eat. After the meal was done Veļi would be chased out and the house would be carefully cleaned to ensure no one had stayed behind and the dirt would be thrown in water. Veļi could also be invited to chaste themselves in the bathhouse. The food could also be brought to the graveyard or left in the bathhouse, barn or granary. In that case, it would be checked next morning to see if Veļi had touched it, to figure out if they were benevolent to the living. In this case, a candle would be lit so the dead could see the food. In some regions, pails of milk and water along with a clean towel would also be left so Veļi could wash themselves. Those who did not honor Veļi were said to have a poor harvest. In modern Latvia, a form of ancestor worship has been preserved in celebrating the Remembrance day of the dead in late November and in graveyard days. (&quot;kapusvētki&quot;) which are held in late summer, and the precise dates of which are decided by whoever owns or manages a particular graveyard. During this day or sometimes days people come to clean up the graves of the deceased of their family.

===Demons===
The belief that all sorcerers and witches are evil only came in to being after Christianization. Before it was believed that, like everyone, sorcerers could be both evil and good. After Christianization it was believed that sorcerers were servants of evil called &quot;burvji&quot;; &quot;burtnieks&quot; (wizards) and &quot;raganas&quot; (witches) marry &quot;velni&quot;. These might, in reality, have been folk medicine practitioners.

&quot;Laumas&quot; and &quot;spīganas&quot;, terms speculated to originally refer to different notions, were also used to refer to witches in some areas. With the help of Jods, they could turn into various beings or have evil spirits serve them. Thus the demons could variously be thought to be independent spirits or spirits of sorcerers flying around. It was thought that souls of sorcerers leave their bodies, which become dead and can then be permanently killed by turning it, as the soul does not know how to return into the body.

There are also reports of werewolves (&quot;vilkači&quot;, &quot;vilkati&quot;) – humans who could turn into wolves. The turning was usually accidental as it happened when someone stood between two pines which had grown together at a certain time. This time varied depending on the region. There are conflicting reports on what forces they serve, though they usually serve no one and are just beasts.

Witches are often reported to steal milk either by themselves or by employing toads and snakes, believed to be capable of sucking it from a cow&#x27;s udder and then regurgitating it on command.

Another beast sometimes said to be in a sorcerer&#x27;s service or even a sorcerer&#x27;s pet was &quot;pūķis&quot; (dragon) – a being who would steal grain and other riches and bring them to its owner. It would be kept in a separate room that nobody could enter without the owner&#x27;s permission. Dragons would be fed the first bit of every meal. If a dragon felt that it was not revered enough it would turn on the owner and burn the house down. Sometimes dragons could speak.

A demon, sometimes related to sorcerers but usually said to be the soul of a child condemned to haunt until the time he or she ought to have died, is &quot;Lietuvēns&quot;, who tortures people, cattle, and horses during the night and who is associated with sleep paralysis.

Similarly, it is sometimes reported that &quot;Vadātājs&quot; is a ghost, sometimes of a prematurely deceased person and sometimes seeking to kill a person in way similar to his own death. Often, however, vadātājs is a devil himself. This demon attacks travelers, making them confused and unable to find their way. Often its aim seems to be to lead people to the nearest body of water, where they would drown.

&quot;Velns&quot; (pl. &quot;Velni&quot;) are beings whose young are portrayed as roughly half the size of a human. The young &quot;velni&quot; are not physically powerful, but are still mischievous and sometimes even stupid. All velni have black fur and occasionally horns on their head. Grown velni are strong and occasionally have multiple heads, this is best portrayed in the famous fairy tale &quot;Kurbads&quot;. All velni are greedy. They live in &quot;Pekle&quot; or later referred to as &quot;Elle&quot;. To get to Pekle you have to find a very deep hole, usually in caves, swamps, or the roots of a large tree, as Pekle is not another realm, but simply a place beneath the surface of the Earth.

&quot;Sumpurņi&quot; (&#x27;Dogsnouts&#x27;) are beings that are taller than a human and live in forests. Their most distinguishing feature is having the body of a human covered in fur and the head of a dog or sometimes bird. Sumpurņi also have a tail, it was believed that they had a hierarchical society with nobles and even kings, the length of one&#x27;s tail would determine his position in their society. When in a state of rage, sumpurņi would attack humans and other animals and tear them apart and suck their blood. The order of this is sometimes reversed.

===Fate goddesses===
The most important goddess of fate is Laima (Goddess of luck). She lives on Earth and is closely involved in human life. Her basic function is related to childbirth and deciding a child&#x27;s fate. Traditionally women would give birth in bathhouses. The path leading to a bathhouse would be cleansed so Laima could easily make her way to help in the birthing process. The woman would be ritually cleansed and would offer prayers and give ritual offerings to Laima. After a successful birth, married women would feast, with Laima being reserved a place of honor in the bathhouse as sign of gratitude. She would also determine a person&#x27;s fate – a decision even she herself could not alter afterward. She was expected to help in other important aspects of life as well and cared for well-being of the people in general. Unmarried girls would pray to her to give them good husbands and happy marriage. She also ensured the fertility of fields and animals (horses in particular) to some extent.

Another goddess, Māra, also has several functions in common with Laima. Although this view has been criticized, many researchers agree that Māra is synonymous with Saint Mary. It has been suggested that Mary took over some functions of earlier deities, including Laima. However, Māra was used to refer to Saint Mary, who was also called upon during childbirth and to help with a number of ailments by either her modern Latvian name Marija or number of Christian euphemisms. All these were also used as euphemisms to refer to uterus in folk magic. The opposing view, based on comparative linguistics linking her with a wide range of other Indoeuropean deities, is that she was an important pre-Christian chthonic deity that both gives and takes life.

Other two goddesses with similar functions are Kārta and Dēkla. Dēkla is mainly mentioned in folklore from a single Catholic area of Courland, historically the District of Pilten. Kārta is even more rarely mentioned in folklore, she is thought to execute the decisions Laima and Dēkla make, as suggested by her name. She is always alongside Laima and may likely a historically recent occurrence that has more to do with phonesthetics of folksongs than religion.

===Fertility gods===
Ensuring fertility was an important function that was assigned to a number of spirits and deities. Ensuring a good harvest was the primary function of Jumis. It was thought that he lives in the fields, therefore the last of the crop would be left on the field for Jumis to live in. This belief was the basis of a ritual involving the catching of Jumis, performed on Miķeļi, which usually was the last day of harvest. This seems to have involved singing songs as the last of the grain was reaped, asking Jumis to run to wherever the crop was stored. The last bit of the crop would be searched for Jumis and then tied into a knot. Another related practice was to make wreaths of grain cereals that would be kept until next year when the seeds from them would be sown first. It was usually attempted to place Jumis stalks in these wreaths. In this sense Jumis is symbolized by stalks with two ears. Any fruit or flower showing such abnormal duplication was called Jumis. It was believed that eating Jumis would cause women or female animals to give birth to twins.

Ensuring the well-being of livestock was, however, a function of other gods. Ūsiņš was associated with the Ūsiņi celebration and thus somewhat merged with Saint George. He was worshiped mainly as the guardian of horses. It is also thought he might have been the god of bees and the god of light. The main protector of cows seems to have been Māra. She is also known as &quot;Lopu Marija&quot; (Mary of livestock), &quot;Lopu māte&quot; (Mother of livestock) and &quot;Piena māte&quot; (Mother of milk). Her function was to ensure that cows give milk. Therefore, she is also often mentioned in connection with water, rivers and sea, as water symbolized milk, while clay symbolized butter. Historical sources also mention that Latvian pagans would venerate snakes (likely grass snakes) and toads as „milk mother” and feed them with milk.

=== Other practices ===
There may have been a number of other spirits and deities venerated by Latvians. There is, for example, a wide range of deities referred to as &quot;Mahte&quot; (&quot;mother&quot;) – their number is variously estimated to be anywhere from 50 to 115. The reasons for such unclarity are that sometimes the authenticity of certain &quot;mothers” is questioned, there are differences between regions in what deities are worshiped and also many of these are synonymous titles of a single deity. Mother and other kinship terms can be used merely to signify age and also to show respect (when referring to older people). While most female spirits are called &quot;mothers”, male spirits would be called &quot;father” (&quot;tēvs&quot;) or &quot;master” (&quot;kungs&quot;) or &quot;god” (&quot;dievs&quot;, &quot;dieviņš&quot;) or &quot;spirit” (&quot;gars&quot;, &quot;gariņš&quot;). Historical sources report that there was a belief that spirits live in the ground. There also are &quot;Mājas gari&quot; (&#x27;house spirits&#x27;) or &quot;Mājas kungs&quot; (&#x27;master of house&#x27;), who lived and were worshiped at home. These sometimes were sacred animals. They were often fed a first bit of every food. Spirits and deities were also worshiped in designated places, which could be visited only at certain times of year. It was believed that visiting them at other times or defiling, even unknowingly, such a site in any way would bring great misfortune to the guilty party - blindness or death are common examples. There were also animals, some known as &quot;dieva sunīši&quot; (&#x27;dogs of god&#x27;), whose killing would bring misfortune, these include stoats, wolf, frogs, ladybirds, etc. Sometimes, however, it was believed that killing would not bring misfortune, but that if the animal got away, it would carry out horrific revenge. This mostly refers to snakes. It was also believed that saying the name of an animal such as a wolf or snake would cause them to appear. There are similar beliefs about not mentioning the devil or plague. Somewhat related is the idea that whistling in certain places would invite the devil, while singing would invite god. Therefore, a large variety of euphemisms were used instead, including comparisons, human names, and other anthropomorphic terms – e.g. snakes were likened to ropes or called &quot;brides&quot;, while the wolf was named &quot;Juris&quot; or &quot;Ansis&quot; or referred to as &quot;man&quot; (also &quot;brother&quot; or &quot;friend&quot;) of the forest.

<text>Henry Wilson (born Jeremiah Jones Colbath; February 16, 1812 – November 22, 1875) was the 18th vice president of the United States, serving from 1873 until his death in 1875, and a senator from Massachusetts from 1855 to 1873. Before and during the American Civil War, he was a leading Republican, and a strong opponent of slavery. Wilson devoted his energies to the destruction of &quot;Slave Power&quot;, the faction of slave owners and their political allies which anti-slavery Americans saw as dominating the country.

Originally a Whig, Wilson was a founder of the Free Soil Party in 1848. He served as the party chairman before and during the 1852 presidential election. Wilson worked diligently to build an anti-slavery coalition, which came to include the Free Soil Party, anti-slavery Democrats, New York Barnburners, the Liberty Party, anti-slavery members of the Know Nothings, and anti-slavery Whigs (called Conscience Whigs). When the Free Soil party dissolved in the mid-1850s, Wilson joined the Republican Party, which he helped found, and which was organized largely in line with the anti-slavery coalition he had nurtured in the 1840s and 1850s.

While a senator during the Civil War, Wilson was considered a &quot;Radical Republican&quot;, and his experience as a militia general, organizer and commander of a Union Army regiment, and chairman of the Senate military committees enabled him to assist the Abraham Lincoln administration in the organization and oversight of the Union Army and Union Navy. Wilson successfully authored bills that outlawed slavery in Washington, D.C., and incorporated African Americans in the Union Civil War effort in 1862.

After the Civil War, he supported the Radical Republican program for Reconstruction. In 1872, Wilson was elected vice president as the running mate of Ulysses S. Grant, the incumbent president of the United States, who was running for a second term. The Grant and Wilson ticket was successful, and Wilson served as vice president from March 4, 1873, until his death on November 22, 1875. Wilson&#x27;s effectiveness as vice president was limited after he suffered a debilitating stroke in May 1873, and his health continued to decline until he was the victim of a fatal stroke while working in the United States Capitol in late 1875.

Throughout his career, Wilson was known for championing causes that were unpopular, including workers&#x27; rights for both blacks and whites and the abolition of slavery. Massachusetts politician George Frisbie Hoar, who served in the United States House of Representatives while Wilson was a senator and later served in the Senate himself, believed Wilson to be the most skilled political organizer in the country. However, Wilson&#x27;s reputation for personal integrity and principled politics was somewhat damaged late in his Senate career by his involvement in the Crédit Mobilier scandal.

==Early life and education==
Wilson was born in Farmington, New Hampshire, on February 16, 1812, one of several children born to Winthrop and Abigail (Witham) Colbath. His father named him Jeremiah Jones Colbath after a wealthy neighbor who was a childless bachelor, vainly hoping that this gesture might result in an inheritance. Winthrop Colbath was a militia veteran of the War of 1812 who worked as a day laborer and hired himself out to local farms and businesses, in addition to occasionally running a sawmill.

The Colbath family was impoverished; after a brief elementary education, at the age of 10 Wilson was indentured to a neighboring farmer, where he worked as a laborer for the next 10 years. During this time two neighbors gave him books and Wilson enhanced his meager education by reading extensively on English history, American history and biographies of famous historical figures. At the end of his service he was given &quot;six sheep and a yoke of oxen.&quot; Wilson immediately sold his animals for $85 (about $2,200 in 2021), which was the first money he had earned during his indenture.

Wilson apparently did not like his birth name, though the reasons given vary. Some sources indicate that he was not close to his family, or disliked his name because of his father&#x27;s supposed intemperance and modest financial circumstances. Others indicate that he was called &quot;Jed&quot; and &quot;Jerry,&quot; and disliked the nicknames so much that he resolved to change his name. Whatever the reason, when he turned 21 he successfully petitioned the New Hampshire General Court to legally change it. He chose the name Henry Wilson, inspired either by a biography of a Philadelphia teacher or a portrait from a book on English clergymen.

==Career==
After trying and failing to find work in New Hampshire, in 1833 Wilson walked more than one hundred miles to Natick, Massachusetts, seeking employment or a trade. Having met William P. Legro, a shoemaker who was willing to train him, Wilson hired himself out for five months to learn to make leather shoes called brogans. Wilson learned the trade in a few weeks, bought out his employment contract for fifteen dollars, and opened his own shop, intending to save enough money to study law. Wilson had success as a shoemaker, and was able to save several hundred dollars in a relatively short time. This success gave rise to legends about Wilson&#x27;s skill; according to one story that grew with retelling, he once attempted to make one hundred pairs of shoes without sleeping, and fell asleep with the one hundredth pair in his hand. Wilson&#x27;s shoemaking experience led to the creation of the political nicknames his supporters later used to highlight his working class roots—the &quot;&quot;Natick Cobbler&quot; and the &quot;Natick Shoemaker&quot;&quot;.

During this time Wilson read extensively and joined the Natick Debating Society, where he developed into an accomplished speaker. Wilson&#x27;s health suffered as the result of the long hours he worked making shoes, and he traveled to Virginia to recuperate. During a stop in Washington, D.C., he heard Congressional debates on slavery and abolitionism, and observed African American families being separated as they were bought and sold in the Washington slave trade. Wilson resolved to dedicate himself &quot;to the cause of emancipation in America,&quot; and after regaining his health returned to New England, where he furthered his education by attending several New Hampshire academies, including schools in Strafford, Wolfeboro, and Concord.

Having spent part of his savings on his traveling and schooling, and having lost some as the result of a loan that was not repaid, Wilson worked as a schoolteacher to get out of debt and begin saving money again, intending to start a business of his own. Beginning with an investment of only twelve dollars, Wilson started a shoe manufacturing company. This venture proved successful, and he eventually employed over 100 workers.

==Political career==

Wilson became active politically as a Whig, and campaigned for William Henry Harrison in 1840. He had joined the Whigs out of disappointment with the fiscal policies of Democrats Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren, and like most Whigs blamed them for the Panic of 1837. In 1840 he was also elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, and served from 1841 to 1843.

Wilson was a member of the Massachusetts State Senate from 1844 to 1846 and 1850 to 1852. From 1851 to 1852 he was the Senate&#x27;s President.

As early as 1845, Wilson had started to become disenchanted with the Whigs as the party attempted to compromise on the slavery issue, and as a Conscience Whig he took steps including the organization of a convention in Concord opposed to the annexation of Texas because it would expand slavery. As a result of this effort, in late 1845 Wilson and abolitionist John Greenleaf Whittier were chosen to submit in person a petition to Congress containing the signatures of 65,000 Massachusetts residents opposed to Texas annexation.

Wilson was a delegate to the 1848 Whig National Convention, but left the party after it nominated slave owner Zachary Taylor for president and took no position on the Wilmot Proviso, which would have prohibited slavery in territory acquired from Mexico in the Mexican–American War. Wilson and Charles Allen, another Massachusetts delegate, withdrew from the convention, and called for a new meeting of anti-slavery advocates in Buffalo, which launched the Free Soil Party.

Having left the Whig Party, Wilson worked to build coalitions with others opposed to slavery, including Free Soilers, anti-slavery Democrats, Barnburners from New York&#x27;s Democratic Party, the Liberty Party, the anti-slavery elements of the Whig Party, and anti-slavery members of the Know Nothing or Native American Party. Although Wilson&#x27;s new political coalition was initially castigated by &quot;straight party&quot; adherents of the mainstream Democratic and Whig parties, Wilson was successful in an effort to broker an alliance between the minority Free Soil and Democratic parties in the state elections of 1850, notably resulting in the election of Charles Sumner to the Senate. 
From 1848 to 1851 Wilson was the owner and editor of the &quot;Boston Republican&quot;, which from 1841 to 1848 was a Whig outlet, and from 1848 to 1851 was the main Free Soil Party newspaper.

During his service in the Massachusetts legislature, Wilson took note that participation in the state militia had declined, and that it was not in a state of readiness. In addition to undertaking legislative efforts to provide uniforms and other equipment, in 1843 Wilson joined the militia himself, becoming a major in the 1st Artillery Regiment, which he later commanded with the rank of colonel. In 1846 Wilson was promoted to brigadier general as commander of the Massachusetts Militia&#x27;s 3rd Brigade, a position he held until 1852.

===Free Soil Party organizer===
In 1852, Wilson was chairman of the Free Soil Party&#x27;s national convention in Pittsburgh, which nominated John P. Hale for president and George Washington Julian for vice president. Later that year he was a Free Soil candidate for U.S. Representative, and lost to Whig Tappan Wentworth. He was a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1853, which proposed a series of political and governmental reforms that were defeated by voters in a post-convention popular referendum. He ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Massachusetts as a Free Soil candidate in 1853 and 1854, but declined to be a candidate again in 1855 because he had his sights set on the U.S. Senate.

===U.S. Senator (1855–1873)===

In 1855 Wilson was elected to the United States Senate by a coalition of Free-Soilers, Know Nothings, and anti-slavery Democrats, filling the vacancy caused by the resignation of Edward Everett. He had briefly joined the Know-Nothings in an attempt to strengthen their anti-slavery efforts, but aligned himself with the Republican Party at its creation, formed largely along the lines of the anti-slavery coalition Wilson had helped develop and nurture. Wilson was reelected as a Republican in 1859, 1865 and 1871, and served from January 31, 1855, to March 3, 1873, when he resigned in order to begin his vice presidential term on March 4.
In his first Senate speech in 1855, Wilson continued to align himself with the abolitionists, who wanted to immediately end slavery in the United States and its territories. In his speech, Wilson said he wanted to abolish slavery &quot;wherever we are morally and legally responsible for its existence&quot;, including Washington, D.C., Wilson also demanded repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, believing the federal government should have no responsibility for enforcing slavery, and that once the act was repealed tensions between slavery proponents and opponents would abate, enabling those Southerners who opposed slavery to help end it in their own time.

On May 22, 1856, Preston Brooks brutally assaulted Senator Charles Sumner on the Senate floor, leaving Sumner bloody and unconscious. Brooks had been upset over Sumner&#x27;s &quot;Crimes Against Kansas&quot; speech that denounced the Kansas–Nebraska Act. After the beating, Sumner received medical treatment at the Capitol, following which Wilson and Nathaniel P. Banks, the Speaker of the House, aided Sumner to travel by carriage to his lodgings, where he received further medical attention. Wilson called the beating by Brooks &quot;brutal, murderous, and cowardly&quot;. Brooks immediately challenged Wilson to a duel. Wilson declined, saying that he could not legally or by personal conviction participate. In reference to a rumor that Brooks might attack Wilson in the Senate as he had attacked Sumner, Wilson told the press &quot;I have sought no controversy, and I seek none, but I shall go where duty requires, uninfluenced by threats of any kind.&quot; The rumors proved unfounded, and Wilson continued his Senate duties without incident.

The attack on Sumner took place just one day after pro-slavery Missourians killed one person in the burning and sacking of Lawrence, Kansas. The attack on Sumner and the sacking of Lawrence were later viewed as two of the incidents which symbolized the &quot;breakdown of reasoned discourse.&quot; This phrase came to describe the period when activists and politicians moved past the debate of anti-slavery and pro-slavery speeches and non-violent actions, and into the realm of physical violence, which in part hastened the onset of the American Civil War.

In June 1858 Wilson made a Senate speech in which he suggested corruption in the government of California and implied complicity on the part of Senator William M. Gwin, a pro-slavery Democrat who had served as a member of Congress from Mississippi before moving to California. Gwin was backed by a powerful Southern coalition of pro-slavery Democrats called the Chivs, who had a monopoly on federal patronage in California. Gwin accused Wilson of demagoguery, and Wilson responded by saying he would rather be thought a demagogue than a thief. Gwin then challenged Wilson to a duel; Wilson declined in the same terms he used to decline a duel with Preston Brooks. In fact neither Gwin nor Wilson wanted to follow through, and commentary about the dispute broke down along partisan lines. One pro-Gwin editorial called the insinuation that Gwin was corrupt &quot;a most malignant falsehood&quot;, while a pro-Wilson editorial called his reluctance to take part in a duel evidence that he was &quot;honest&quot; and &quot;conscientious&quot;, and had &quot;more respect for the laws of this country than his adversary&quot;. After several attempts to find a face-saving compromise, Gwin and Wilson agreed to refer their dispute to three senators who would serve as mediators. William H. Seward, John J. Crittenden and Jefferson Davis were chosen, and produced an acceptable solution. At their instigation, Wilson stated to the Senate that he had not meant to impugn Gwin&#x27;s honor, and Gwin replied by saying that he had not meant to question Wilson&#x27;s motives. In addition, the mediators caused to be removed from the Senate record both Gwin&#x27;s remarks about demagoguery and Wilson&#x27;s suggestion that Gwin was a thief.

==Civil War==

During the American Civil War, Wilson was Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs and the Militia, and later the Committee on Military Affairs. In that capacity, he oversaw action on over 15,000 War and Navy Department nominations that Abraham Lincoln submitted during the course of the war, and worked closely with him on legislation affecting the Army and Navy.

In the summer of 1861, after the congressional session ended, Wilson returned to Massachusetts and recruited and equipped nearly 2,300 men in forty days. They were mustered in as the 22nd Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, which he commanded as a colonel from September 27 to October 29, an honor sometimes accorded to the individual responsible for raising and equipping a regiment. After the war, he became an early member of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

Wilson&#x27;s experience in the militia, service with the 22nd Massachusetts, and chairmanship of the Military Affairs Committee provided him with more practical military knowledge and training than any other Senator. He made use of this experience throughout the war to frame, explain, defend and advocate for legislation on military matters, including enlistment of soldiers and sailors, and organizing and supplying the rapidly expanding Union Army and Union Navy.

Winfield Scott, the Commanding General of the United States Army since 1841, said that during the session of Congress that ended in the Spring of 1861 Wilson had done more work &quot;than all the chairmen of the military committees had done for the last 20 years.&quot; On January 27, 1862, Simon Cameron, the recently resigned Secretary of War, echoed Scott&#x27;s sentiments when he said that &quot;no man, in my opinion, in the whole country, has done more to aid the war department in preparing the mighty [Union] army now under arms than yourself [Wilson].&quot;

=== Greenhow controversy ===

In July 1861, Wilson was present for the Civil War&#x27;s first major battle at Bull Run Creek in Manassas, Virginia, an event which many senators, representatives, newspaper reporters, and Washington society elite traveled from the city to observe in anticipation of a quick Union victory. Riding out in a carriage in the early morning, Wilson brought a picnic hamper of sandwiches to feed Union troops. However, the battle turned into a Confederate rout, forcing Union troops to make a panicky retreat. Caught up in the chaos, Wilson was almost captured by the Confederates, while his carriage was crushed, and he had to make an embarrassing return to Washington on foot. The result of this battle had a sobering effect on many in the North, causing widespread realization that Union victory would not be won without a prolonged struggle.

In seeking to place blame for the Union defeat, some in Washington spread rumors that Wilson had revealed plans for the Union invasion of Virginia to Washington society figure and Southern spy Rose O&#x27;Neal Greenhow. According to the story, although he was married, Wilson had seen a great deal of Mrs. Greenhow, and may have told her about the plans of Major General Irvin McDowell, which Mrs. Greenhow then conveyed to Confederate forces under Major General P. G. T. Beauregard. One Wilson biography suggests someone else—Wilson&#x27;s Senate clerk Horace White—was also friendly with Mrs. Greenhow and could have leaked the invasion plan, although it is also possible that neither Wilson nor White did so.

===Equal rights activism===

On December 16, 1861, Wilson introduced a bill to abolish slavery in Washington, D.C., something he had desired to do since his visit to the nation&#x27;s capital 25 years earlier. At this time fugitive slaves from the war were being held in prisons of Washington, D.C., and faced the possibility of return to their owners. Wilson said of his bill that it would &quot;blot out slavery forever from the nation&#x27;s capital&quot;. The measure met bitter opposition from the Democrats who remained in the Senate after those from the southern states vacated their seats to join the Confederacy, but it passed. After passage in the House, President Lincoln signed Wilson&#x27;s bill into law on April 16, 1862.

On July 8, 1862, Wilson drafted a measure that authorized the President to enlist African Americans who had been held in slavery and were deemed competent for military service, and employ them to construct fortifications and carry out other military-related manual labor, the first step towards allowing African Americans to serve as soldiers. President Lincoln signed the amendment into law on July 17. Wilson&#x27;s law paid African Americans in the military $10 monthly, which was effectively $7 a month after deductions for food and clothing, while white soldiers were paid effectively $14 monthly.

On January 1, 1863, Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation freed all slaves held in bondage in the Southern states or territories then in rebellion against the federal government. On February 2, 1863, Congress built on Wilson&#x27;s 1862 law by passing a bill authored by Pennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, which authorized the enlistment of 150,000 African Americans into the Union Army for service as uniformed soldiers.

On February 17, 1863, Wilson introduced a bill that would federally fund elementary education for African American youth in Washington, D.C. President Lincoln signed the bill into law on March 3, 1863.

Wilson added an amendment to the 1864 Enrollment Act which provided that formerly enslaved African Americans from slave holding states remaining in the Union who enlisted in the Union Army would be considered permanently free by action of the federal government, rather than through individual emancipation by the states or their owners, thus preventing the possibility of their re-enslavement. President Lincoln signed this measure into law on February 24, 1864, freeing more than 20,000 slaves in Kentucky alone.

Wilson supported the right of black men to join the uniformed services. Once African Americans were permitted to serve in the military, Wilson advocated in the Senate for them to receive equal pay and other benefits. A Vermont newspaper portrayed Wilson&#x27;s position and enhanced his nationwide reputation as an abolitionist by editorializing &quot;Henry Wilson of Massachusetts, in a speech in the U.S. Senate on Friday, said he thought our treatment of the negro soldiers almost as bad as that of the rebels at Fort Pillow. This is hardly an exaggeration.&quot;

On June 15, 1864, Wilson succeeded in adding a provision to an appropriations bill which addressed the pay disparity between whites and blacks in the military by authorizing equal salaries and benefits for African American soldiers. Wilson&#x27;s provision stated that &quot;all persons of color who had been or might be mustered into the military service should receive the same uniform, clothing, rations, medical and hospital attendance, and pay&quot; as white soldiers, to date from January 1864.

Wilson introduced a bill in Congress which would free in the Union&#x27;s slave-holding states the still-enslaved families of former slaves serving in the Union Army. In advocating for passage, Wilson argued that allowing the family members of soldiers to remain in slavery was a &quot;burning shame to this country ... Let us hasten the enactment ... that, on the forehead of the soldier&#x27;s wife and the soldier&#x27;s child, no man can write &quot;Slave&quot;. President Lincoln signed the measure into law on March 3, 1865, and an estimated 75,000 African American women and children were freed in Kentucky alone. 

===Creation of the National Academy of Sciences===

In early 1863, Louis Agassiz, one of a group of Cambridge, Massachusetts scientists interested in establishing an academy of sciences modeled on the Royal Society and the French Institute, approached Wilson with the idea of establishing such an academy. On February 11, 1863, a Permanent Commission, which comprised Admiral Charles Henry Davis and the scientists Joseph Henry and Alexander Dallas Bache, was appointed within the Navy Department and given the task of evaluating and reporting on the inventions and other ideas submitted by citizens in order to aid the war effort. The establishment of the Permanent Commission prompted Davis to suggest that &quot;the whole plan, so long entertained, of the Academy could be successfully carried out if an act of incorporation were boldly asked for in the name of some of the leading men of science, from different parts of the country.&quot; Just prior to the establishment of the Permanent Commission, Agassiz had written to Wilson suggesting that a &quot;National Academy of Sciences&quot; could be established and recommending that if Wilson were favorable, Bache, &quot;to whom the scientific men of the country look as upon their leader…can draft in twenty four hours a complete plan for you…&quot;
On February 19, Agassiz came to Washington from Cambridge to accept appointment, upon Wilson&#x27;s nomination, to the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution. Agassiz went directly from the train to Bache&#x27;s house, where he met with Bache, Wilson, and the scientists Benjamin Apthorp Gould and Benjamin Peirce. Working from plans laid out by Bache and Davis, the group drafted a bill for the establishment of a National Academy of Sciences, to be put before Congress.
On February 20, Wilson introduced the bill in the Senate. Just before adjournment on March 3, 1863, Wilson asked the Senate &quot;to take up a bill…to incorporate the National Academy of Sciences.&quot; The Senate passed the bill by voice vote; later that day it was sent to the House of Representatives, which passed it without comment. President Lincoln signed it into law before midnight that same day.

==Reconstruction and civil rights==
When Andrew Johnson assumed the presidency after President Lincoln&#x27;s assassination in April 1865, Senators Sumner and Wilson both hoped Johnson would support the policies of the Republican Party, since Johnson, a Democrat, had been elected with Lincoln on a pro-Union ticket. After the Civil War ended with a Union Victory in May 1865, the defeated former Confederacy was ruined. It had been devastated economically and politically, and much of its infrastructure had been destroyed during the war. The opportunity was ripe for Congress and Johnson to work together on terms for Southern restoration and reconstruction. Instead, Johnson launched his own reconstruction policy, which was seen as more lenient to former Confederates, and excluded African American citizenship. When Congress opened the session which began in December 1865, Johnson&#x27;s policy included a demand for admission of Southern Senators and Representatives, nearly all Democrats, including many former Confederates. Congress, still in Republican hands, responded by refusing to allow the Southern Senators and Representatives to take their seats, beginning a rift between Republicans in Congress and the President. Wilson favored allowing only persons who had been loyal to the United States to serve in positions of political power in the former Confederacy, and believed that Congress, not the president, had the power to reconstruct the southern states. As a result, Wilson joined forces with the Congressmen and Senators known as Radical Republicans, those most strongly opposed to Johnson.

On December 21, 1865, two days after the announcement that the states had ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery, Wilson introduced a bill to protect the civil rights of African Americans. Although Wilson&#x27;s bill failed to pass Congress it was effectively the same bill as the Civil Rights Act of 1866 that passed Congress over Johnson&#x27;s veto on April 9, 1866.

The rift between the Radicals, including Wilson, and President Johnson grew as Johnson attempted to implement his more lenient Reconstruction policies. Johnson vetoed the bill to establish the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, as well as other Radical measures to protect African American civil rights—measures which Wilson supported. Wilson supported the effort to impeach Johnson, saying that Johnson was &quot;unworthy, if not criminal&quot; in his conduct by resisting Congressional Reconstruction measures, many of which were passed over his vetoes. At the 1868 Senate trial Wilson voted for Johnson&#x27;s conviction, but Republicans fell one vote short of the two-thirds majority needed to remove Johnson from office. (With 36 &quot;guilty&quot; votes needed for removal, the Senate results were 35 to 19 on all three post-trial ballots.)

On May 27, 1868, Wilson spoke before the Senate to forcefully advocate the readmission of Arkansas. Taking the lead on this issue, Wilson urged immediate action, saying that the new state government was constitutional, and was composed of loyal Southerners, African Americans who were formerly enslaved, and Northerners who had moved south. Wilson said he would not agree to Congressional adjournment until all Southern states with reconstructed governments loyal to the United States that adopted new constitutions were readmitted. The &quot;New York Tribune&quot; called Wilson&#x27;s speech &quot;strong&quot; and said that Wilson steered the Senate away from &quot;legal hair-splitting&quot;. Within a month the Senate had acted, and Arkansas was readmitted on June 22, 1868. President Ulysses S. Grant, who succeeded Johnson in 1869, was more supportive of Congressional Reconstruction, and the remaining former Confederate states that had not rejoined the Union were readmitted during his first term. Federal troops continued to be based in the former Confederate states, allowing Republicans to control state governments, and African Americans to vote and hold federal office.

In 1870 Hiram Revels was elected to the U.S. Senate by the reconstructed Mississippi Legislature. Revels was the first African American elected to the Senate, and Senate Democrats attempted to prevent him from being seated. Wilson defended Revels&#x27;s election, and presented as evidence of its validity signatures from the clerks of the Mississippi House of Representatives and Mississippi State Senate, as well as that of Adelbert Ames, the military Governor of Mississippi. Wilson argued that Revels&#x27;s skin color was not a bar to Senate service, and connected the role of the Senate to Christianity&#x27;s Golden Rule of doing to others as one would have done to oneself. The Senate voted to seat Revels, and after he took the oath of office Wilson personally escorted him to his desk as journalists recorded the historic event.

==1868 vice presidential campaign==
Prior to the presidential election of 1868, Wilson toured the South giving political speeches. Many in the press believed Wilson was promoting himself to be the Republican presidential candidate. Wilson, however, supported the Civil War hero General Ulysses S. Grant. During Reconstruction Grant supported Republican Congressional initiatives rather than President Johnson&#x27;s, and during the dispute over the Tenure of Office Act which led to Johnson&#x27;s impeachment, Grant served as temporary Secretary of War, but then returned the Department to Radical ally Edwin M. Stanton&#x27;s control over Johnson&#x27;s strong objection, making Grant a favorite to many Radicals.
Wilson actually desired to be vice president. During his speech-making tour of the South, Wilson moderated his tougher Reconstruction ideology, advocating a biracial society, while urging African Americans and their white supporters to take a conciliatory and peaceful approach with Southern whites who had favored the Confederacy. Radicals, including Benjamin Wade, were stunned by Wilson&#x27;s remarks, believing blacks should not be subject to their former white owners. At the Republican Convention, Wilson, Wade and others competed for the vice presidential nomination, and Wilson had support among Southern delegates, but he failed to win after five ballots. Wade was also unable to win the convention vote, and Wilson&#x27;s delegates eventually switched their votes to Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax, who won the nomination and went on to win the general election with Grant at the head of the ticket. After Grant and Colfax won the 1868 election Wilson declined to serve as Secretary of War in Grant&#x27;s cabinet due to his desire to spend more time with Mrs. Wilson during her lengthy final illness.

==1872 vice presidential campaign==

In 1872 Wilson had a strong reputation among Republicans as a principled but practical reformer who supported African American civil rights, voting rights for women, federal education aid, regulation of businesses, and prohibition of liquor. In 1870, incumbent Vice President Schuyler Colfax, said he would not run for another term, creating the possibility of a contested nomination. In addition, some Republicans, including Grant, desired another vice presidential nominee because they believed Colfax had presidential aspirations and might endanger Grant&#x27;s reelection by bolting to the Liberal Republican Party, which had formed because of opposition to charges of corruption in the Grant administration and Grant&#x27;s attempted Santo Domingo annexation. The Liberal Republican convention, held in Cincinnati in April, and headed by Carl Schurz, desired to replace Grant because of corruption in his administration, end Reconstruction, and return Southern state governments to white rule. They nominated Horace Greeley for president and B. Gratz Brown for vice president. 

The Republican convention opened on June 5 in Philadelphia and the delegates were in an enthusiastic mood. For the first time in party convention history, telegraph operators communicated minute-by-minute proceedings to the nation. The Republican platform supported amnesty for former Confederates, low tariffs, civil service reform, Grant&#x27;s Indian Peace policy, and civil rights for African Americans. Grant was unanimously renominated on the second day, to the loud cheers of the convention crowd. Wilson was popular among Republicans for the vice presidential nomination, with an appealing rags-to-riches story that included his rise from indentured servant to owner and operator of a successful shoe making business. On the first ballot, he defeated Colfax, who by then had become an active candidate by renouncing his 1870 pledge and informing his supporters that he would accept renomination if it was offered. The Republicans believed Wilson&#x27;s nomination, as a politician of integrity coming from the anti-slavery movement, would outflank the anti-corruption argument of the Liberal Republicans, who counted Sumner among their members. Both Grant and his new running mate Wilson were idealized by Republican posters, which depicted Grant &quot;the Galena Tanner&quot; and Wilson &quot;the Natick Shoemaker&quot; carrying tools and wearing workmen&#x27;s aprons. (Grant&#x27;s father operated a tanning and leather goods manufacturing business, and before the Civil War Grant had clerked in his father&#x27;s Galena, Illinois, store.) In July, in an unprecedented political party fusion influenced by Schurz, the Democrats adopted the Liberal Republican platform and endorsed that party&#x27;s candidates. Grant&#x27;s personal popularity proved insurmountable in the general election, and Grant and Wilson went on to overwhelmingly defeat Greeley and Brown in both the popular and electoral college votes. Wilson&#x27;s nomination for Vice President had been intended to strengthen the Republican ticket, and was seen as a success.

===Crédit Mobilier scandal===
During the 1872 campaign, Wilson&#x27;s reputation for honesty was marred by a September &quot;New York Sun&quot; article which indicated that he was involved in the Crédit Mobilier scandal. Wilson was one of several Representatives and Senators (mostly Republicans), including Colfax, who were offered (and possibly took) bribes of cash and discounted shares in the Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Crédit Mobilier subsidiary from Congressman Oakes Ames during the late 1860s in exchange for votes favorable to the Union Pacific during the building of the First transcontinental railroad.

After denying to a reporter just a month before the election that he had a Crédit Mobilier connection, Wilson admitted involvement when he gave testimony before a Senate committee on February 13, 1873. Wilson told members of the investigating committee that in December 1867 he had agreed to purchase $2,000 (~$ in ) in Crédit Mobilier stock (20 shares) using Mrs. Wilson&#x27;s money and in her name. According to Wilson, his wife and he later had concerns about the propriety of the transaction and had never taken possession of the actual stock certificates, so Wilson asked Ames to cancel the transaction and Ames refunded the $2,000 purchase price to Wilson. Wilson said he then returned $814 to Ames – $748 in dividends and $66 in interest that Mrs. Wilson had supposedly earned as profits, even though she had not taken physical possession of her shares. Wilson further claimed that because Mrs. Wilson had refused to take these proceeds from Ames, Wilson took it upon himself to pay her $814 from his own funds to compensate her for the profit she would have made if she had kept the stock, which he said he felt obligated to do because his wife had originally agreed to purchase the stock on his recommendation, and had lost money by following his later recommendation to cancel the transaction.

Mrs. Wilson had died in 1870, so Senators had to rely on Wilson&#x27;s word and that of Ames, who corroborated Wilson. The Senate accepted Wilson&#x27;s explanation, and took no action against him, but his reputation for integrity was somewhat damaged because of his initial denial and later admission, though not sufficiently enough to prevent him from becoming vice president the following month.

==Vice presidency (1873–1875)==

Wilson served as vice president from March 4, 1873, until his death. As vice president, Wilson&#x27;s years of Senate experience enabled him to perform as a &quot;highly efficient and acceptable&quot; presiding officer. During his term he cast one tie-breaking vote, in favor of passing the Civil Rights Act of 1875. After his death, the office of vice president remained vacant since there was no constitutional provision to fill an intra-term vice-presidential vacancy until the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967. This meant that the Senate President Pro Tempore Thomas Ferry was now next in the line of presidential succession. Ferry remained next in succession until March 4, 1877.

===Illness and death===
Wilson&#x27;s ceremonial duties and work on &quot;History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America&quot; kept him extremely busy, working late hours with little time to rest. In early May 1873, Wilson attended funeral services for Salmon P. Chase in New York City. On May 19, 1873, he suffered a stroke that caused paralysis in his face, general weakness, and impaired speech. His doctor ordered him to rest, but Wilson allowed reporters to see him. The public first took notice that Wilson was in ill health when he made an appearance in Boston on May 30, and reporters were informed that Wilson was unable to work or handle his correspondence. His health somewhat improved during September and October, and on November 25 Wilson returned to Washington for the opening of Congress. He was able to preside over the Senate from December 1 through December 9, 1873, but was unable to speak in public, including when he attended a Boston commemoration of the one hundredth anniversary of the Boston Tea Party.
Wilson remained in occasional ill health into 1874, but was able to attend funeral services for Charles Sumner in March. Throughout his remaining tenure, Wilson&#x27;s Senate attendance was irregular due to his continued poor health. During periods when he was not ill, Wilson was also able to resume some of his ceremonial duties, including participating in a White House party for the King of Hawaii, David Kalākaua, in December 1874. When Free Soil and abolitionist colleague Gerrit Smith died in New York City on December 28, 1874, Wilson traveled there to view the body and take part in funeral services.
Wilson continued to go through bouts of ill health in 1875. While working at the United States Capitol on November 10, 1875, he suffered what was believed to be a minor stroke, and was taken to the Vice President&#x27;s Room to recuperate. Over the next several days, his health appeared to improve and his friends thought he was nearly recovered. However, on November 22 at 7:20 am, Wilson suffered a fatal stroke while working at the Capitol. His remains were accorded the honor of lying in state at the United States Capitol rotunda.

The subsequent funeral arrangements included military escorts as Wilson&#x27;s remains were transferred from one train station to another &quot;en route&quot; from Washington to Natick, as well as nights lying in state. The route included processions in Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston, and nights lying in state at Baltimore City Hall and Independence Hall in Philadelphia. He was interred at Old Dell Park Cemetery in Natick.

Two other former vice presidents died in the same year as Wilson – John C. Breckinridge and Andrew Johnson.

Wilson was the fourth vice president to die in office, following: George Clinton, who served under both Thomas Jefferson (1805–1809) and James Madison (1809–1812); Elbridge Gerry, who also served under Madison (1813–1814); and William R. King, under Franklin Pierce (1853).

==Historical reputation==

According to historian George H. Haynes, during his nearly thirty years of public service Wilson practiced principled politics by championing unpopular causes, sometimes at the expense of his personal ambition. The causes Wilson supported included abolition of slavery, and the rights of workers, both black and white.

Wilson was not hesitant to sever ties with old guard politicians and form new coalitions in order to accomplish his objectives, even though this gave him the reputation among opponents of being a &quot;shifty&quot; politician. On the other hand, he was admired by fellow abolitionists for his lifelong dedication to the cause, and workingmen found inspiration in his career, since he had himself risen from a manual laborer&#x27;s background.

Wilson supported free public schools and libraries. In Massachusetts he supported tax exemptions for the purchase and maintenance of worker&#x27;s tools and furniture, and the removal of property qualifications for voting rights.

U.S. Senator George F. Hoar, a Massachusetts political contemporary, said Wilson was a &quot;skilful, adroit, and practiced and constant political manager&quot; and &quot;the most skilled political organizer in the country&quot; during his career.

Wilson is also recognized for being a political pioneer in techniques for determining public opinion while he held office. In the 20th century, the straw poll and scientific public opinion polls by companies including Gallup became standard parts of political campaigns and media coverage of elections. During his Senate career, Wilson pioneered straw polling by sampling the views of Massachusetts voters through in person conversations and unscientific written surveys before making his own views known. These efforts were credited with helping Wilson build coalitions, win elections, make political allies, and determine the best time to act in the Senate on issues of importance.

In 1891, the Henry Wilson school, a facility for black students, opened on what was then Central Street in the Washington County portion of the District of Columbia (now 17th Street in the Adams Morgan neighborhood). It was named for him in honor of his role emancipating the district&#x27;s slaves. The school was closed in 1956 due to its small size, and shortly thereafter converted to the Morgan Annex, a satellite location of the adjacent Thomas P. Morgan School. The Morgan Annex was later closed; it was sold in 1989, and then reopened as the Morgan Annex Lofts condominiums.

Wilson was the subject of a biographical podcast in 2022 titled &quot;Henry Wilson &amp; The Civil War&quot;. The series had over 22 episodes and was hosted by Lincoln Anniballi.

==Personal life==
On October 28, 1840, Wilson married Harriet Malvina Howe (1824–1870). They were the parents of a son, Henry Hamilton Wilson (1846–1866), who attended the Highland Military Academy in Worcester, Massachusetts. During the Civil War, the younger Wilson attended the United States Naval Academy, but left before graduating in order to accept a commission in the Union Army. He attained success in the 31st and 104th Regiments of United States Colored Troops, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel and second-in-command of the 104th in July 1865. After the war he accepted a commission as a second lieutenant in the regular Army&#x27;s 6th Cavalry Regiment, and served until his death from a ruptured appendix in 1866. Camp Wilson, an Army post in Texas was named for Henry H. Wilson; it was later renamed Fort Griffin.

In 1869 Henry and Harriet Wilson also became the &quot;de facto&quot; adoptive parents of a girl, Evangelina (or Evangeline), who was born between 1864 and 1866, and took the name Eva Wilson. In a complicated series of events, in 1869 a woman named Caroline Vreeland met Nancy Colbath, wife of Wilson&#x27;s brother Samuel. Vreeland allowed Nancy Colbath to adopt the child, with the understanding that she would be raised by Henry Wilson and his wife. The child lived with the Wilsons until shortly before Mrs. Wilson&#x27;s death. Nancy Colbath then kept the child, and received monthly payments from Henry Wilson for her support. Details later emerged which indicated the likelihood that Vreeland had obtained a baby girl from an unknown parent or parents in Boston in 1866 so that her sister could use the baby to extort a man with whom she had had an affair. Vreeland went to prison for a stabbing in the early 1870s. The child continued to live with Wilson, and by 1874 he had asked Nancy Colbath to again be responsible for her. Wilson agreed to provide them a suitable home and financial support, but had not followed through by the time of his death

Wilson requested that the executor of his will, nephew William Leander Coolidge, use most of Wilson&#x27;s estate to ensure that Wilson&#x27;s mother in law was cared for, and that Eva receive an education and financial support. Wilson had given Coolidge oral instructions and letters, and the situation became complicated because Wilson&#x27;s death occurred before he had incorporated these additional instructions into his will. Coolidge acted as a trustee for Eva, and by 1889, when she was more than 21 years old, she claimed she was entitled to the remainder of Wilson&#x27;s estate. Other Wilson family members disagreed; because of the complexity of the details, Coolidge petitioned the Massachusetts courts for guidance. The courts found in favor of Eva, by then married and known as Eva Carpenter, and she received most of the estate, which was valued at approximately $10,000 (about $239,000 in 2021).

<doc id="89162" wikidata="Q6734931" url="?curid=89162" title="Mahte">
<text>In Latvian mythology, the term Māte stands for &quot;mother&quot;, sometimes written in English as Mahte. It was an epithet applied to some sixty-seventy goddesses. They were clearly distinct goddesses in most or all cases, so the term definitely referred to the mother-goddess of specific phenomena. According to professor Lotte Motz, scholar Haralds Biezais mentioned there were at least 70 characters in Baltic religion identified with the title of &quot;Mate&quot;.

== Overview ==
Latvian ethnographer Pēteris Šmits noted that the Mahtes seem to be a phenomenon exclusive to Latvian mythology, with no equivalent either in its Baltic neighbours (Prussian and Lithuanian), nor in other Indo-European mythologies.

Scholars (e.g., Miriam Robbins Dexter, Lotte Motz, David Adams Leeming, Martin Litchfield West) note that these deities were invoked with the epithet &quot;mate&quot; &#x27;mother&#x27; and individually oversaw several aspects of nature, including features of the environment (forests, fields, mushrooms, sea, the wind, etc.), animals (for instance, elks), as well as cultural aspects, such as death and interrement, or milk and cattle.

According to scholar Elza Kokare, the authenticity of some Mahte deities is dubious, but some are firmly established due to a great number of mentions in the &quot;dainas&quot; (Latvian folksongs).

=== List of &quot;Mahte&quot; ===
Following are some of the &quot;Mate&quot; characters:

#Bangu māte - Mother of Waves
#Ceļa māte - Mother of Roads
#Dārza māte - Mother of Gardens
#Dēkla māte
#Gausu māte
#Jūras māte - considered a goddess of the sea (from &quot;Jura&quot; &#x27;sea&#x27;)
#Kapu māte - &#x27;Mother of Graves&#x27;
#Kārta māte
#Krūmu māte - Mother of Bushes
#Lapu māte - Mother of Leaves
#Lauka māte or Lauku māte - Mother of Fields
#Lazdu māte - Mother of the Hazelbush
#Lietus māte - Mother Rain
#Linu māte - Mother Flax
#Lopu māte - Mother of Livestock (Cattle)
#Mieža māte - Mother of Barley
#Meža māte - Mother of the Forest
#Miglas māte - Mother of Fog
#Pirts māte - Mother of the Bathhouse
#Rijas māte - Mother of the Threshing Place
#Sēņu māte - Mother of Mushrooms
#Smilšu māte - Mother of Sands
#Sniega māte - Mother of Snow
#Tirgus māte - Mother of Markets
#Ūdens māte - Mother of Waters
#Uguns mate - Mother of Fire
#Upes māte - Mother of Rivers
#Vēja māte - &#x27;Mother of Winds&#x27;
#Veļu māte or Vélių motę - mother of the souls/spirits
#Zemes māte - Earth Mother (Māra)
#Ziedu māte - Mother of Flowers

==Role of the Mothers==
Scholarship on Baltic and Latvian folklore remarks that some of the &quot;Mahte&quot; characters comprise a complex of deities related to that phenomenon. It is also remarked that, out of this mother cult, &quot;the main
Latvian mother deities are those of the dead, the sea, the forest, and the wind&quot;.

===Death and the afterlife===
For instance, goddess Zemes Mate (&#x27;earth mother&#x27;) was associated with receiving the dead and acting as their ruler and guardian. In Latvian &quot;dainas&quot;, Zemes Mate is associated with fellow &quot;Mahte&quot; (&quot;Mothers&quot;) &quot;Velu Mate&quot; (&#x27;Mother of Dead Souls&#x27;) and &quot;Kapu Mate&quot; (&#x27;Mother of Graves&#x27;). According to researcher Elza Kokare, Zemes Mate and Kapu Mate act as the resting places of the dead, guarding its body and holding the key to their graves. As an individual character, Zemes mate is invoked as a person&#x27;s final resting place.

A second personage is named &quot;Veļu māte&quot; or &quot;Vélių motę&quot; (Mother of the souls/spirits of the deceased), etymologically connected to Lithuanian &quot;veles&quot; &#x27;shades of the dead&#x27;, &quot;velionis&quot; &#x27;dead person&#x27; and Latvian &quot;Vels&quot; &#x27;god of the underworld&#x27; (as mentioned by scholar Marija Gimbutas) and, by extension, with some relation to Slavic Veles, deity of the underworld. She is considered to be a chthonic goddess and &quot;queen of the dead&quot;, who welcomes them at the cemetery.

Another figure named &quot;Nāves māte&quot; (&quot;Mother Death&quot;) was presumed by scholar Nikolai Mikhailov to be connected to Slovenian word &quot;navje&quot;, an etymon related to the &quot;Nav&quot; of Slavic folklore, a designation for the dead. He also cited the possibility that Naves mate is another name for Latvian Velu mate and Lithuanian Veliona. The word &quot;nāve&quot; also means &#x27;death&#x27; in Latvian.

Other deities connected with the worship of the dead were &quot;Kapu māte&quot; (&#x27;Mother of Graves&#x27;, &#x27;Mother of the Grave&#x27; or &#x27;Graveyard-Mother&#x27;) and &quot;Smilšu māte&quot; (&#x27;Mother of Sand&#x27; or &#x27;Mother of the Sand Hillock&#x27;).

===The natural world===
Another set of &quot;Mahte&quot; figures relate to the natural world, such as Veju Mate (&quot;The Mother of Winds&quot;); &quot;Meža mate&quot; (&quot;Mother of the Forest&quot;; counterpart to Lithuanian &quot;Medeina&quot;), protectress of wild life; &quot;Miglas mate&quot; (&quot;Mother of the Fog&quot;) and &quot;Lietus mate&quot; (&quot;Mother of Rain&quot;). Veju Mate (or Veja mate) is said to be the goddess of winds and ruler of the weather.

==== Bodies of water ====
Another group is composed of several water divinities: &quot;Juras Mate&quot; (&quot;Mother Ocean&quot;, &quot;Mother of the Seas&quot; or &quot;Sea-Mother&quot;), a goddess of waters; &quot;Udens Mate&quot; (&quot;Mother of Waters&quot;); &quot;Upes Mahte&quot; (&quot;Mother of Rivers&quot;), &quot;Bangu Mate&quot; (&quot;Mother of Waves&quot;; counterpart to Lithuanian &quot;Bangputys&quot;). Juras Mate is said to rule the seas as a goddess.

Deity Bangu mate is considered to be a recent and more poetical appellation of the Mother of the Water and Mother of the Sea.

===Household and home===
Lithuanian scholar Marija Gimbutas pointed out that Latvian traditions contain a &quot;Uguns mate&quot; (&#x27;Mother of the Fire&#x27;) as a counterpart to Lithuanian &quot;Gabija&quot;, a deity of the hearth and protectress of house and family. Other deities associated with the household and domestic affairs are &quot;Mãjas gars&quot; (&quot;Spirits of the House&quot;) and &quot;Pirts mate&quot; (&quot;Mother of the Bathhouse&quot;).

===Agriculture===
Mahte deities related to fields and agriculture include &quot;Lauka mate&quot; (&quot;Mother of the Plough-Land&quot;), a deity said to be worshipped at ploughing time.

<text>William Almon Wheeler (June 30, 1819June 4, 1887) was an American politician and attorney who served as the 19th vice president of the United States from 1877 to 1881 under President Rutherford B. Hayes. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as a United States representative from New York from 1861 to 1863 and 1869 to 1877.

Born in Malone, New York, Wheeler pursued a legal career after attending the University of Vermont. After serving in various local positions, he won election to the New York State Legislature. He served in Congress from 1861 to 1863 and from 1869 to 1877. He was widely respected for his integrity and refused a salary increase after Congress passed an 1873 pay raise that he opposed.

After the 1876 Republican National Convention settled on Rutherford B. Hayes as the party&#x27;s presidential nominee after seven ballots, the delegates nominated Wheeler for vice president. Nominated by Congressman Luke P. Poland, Wheeler surged into an early lead over Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, Marshall Jewell, and Stewart L. Woodford to clinch the nomination on the first ballot. Wheeler was nominated because he was popular among his colleagues and had worked to avoid making enemies in Congress. In addition, as a resident of the populous Eastern state of New York, he provided geographical balance to the ticket, since Hayes was from the populous Midwest state of Ohio. The Republican ticket prevailed in the contentious 1876 presidential election, though they lost the popular vote. Though they had not known each other before the convention, Wheeler and Hayes got along amicably while in office. They chose not to seek second terms, and Wheeler returned to Malone, New York, after the end of his term. He died in 1887 and was buried at Morningside Cemetery in Malone.

During Wheeler&#x27;s vice presidency, the Hayes administration abandoned post-Civil War Reconstruction and pursued an alliance between Northern Republicans and Old Southern Whigs. Hayes hoped former Whigs who made up the South&#x27;s business and merchant classes would supplant the Democratic plantation owners who dominated politics and government. This scenario did not materialize, and the end of Republican efforts to ensure civil rights and social equality for former slaves doomed Southern blacks to oppression by white supremacists, who enacted Jim Crow laws that lasted for decades.

==Early life and career==
William Almon Wheeler was born in Malone, New York, and attended Franklin Academy and the University of Vermont, although monetary concerns forced him to drop out without graduating. Wheeler received the honorary degrees of Master of Arts from Dartmouth College in 1865 and LL.D. from the University of Vermont (1867) and Union College (1877). In 1876, he received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Vermont &quot;as in course&quot;, making him a graduate of the class of 1842. In 1845, he married Mary King (1828–1876).

He studied law with Asa Hascall, a Malone attorney and politician who served as town supervisor, justice of the peace, district attorney, and member of the New York State Assembly. Wheeler was admitted to the bar in 1845, and practiced in Malone. He was District Attorney of Franklin County from 1846 to 1849. He was a member of the Assembly (Franklin County) in 1850 and 1851; and of the New York State Senate (17th D.) in 1858 and 1859.

He was elected as a Republican to the 37th United States Congress, holding office from March 4, 1861, to March 3, 1863. He was elected to the 41st, 42nd, 43rd and 44th United States Congresses, holding office from March 4, 1869, to March 3, 1877. 
During his House tenure, Wheeler served as chairman of the Committee on Pacific Railroads (42nd Congress) and the Committee on Commerce (43rd Congress).

Wheeler&#x27;s reputation for honesty was celebrated by Allan Nevins in his introduction to John F. Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Profiles in Courage.&quot; Roscoe Conkling, a Senator and New York State political boss, once offered, &quot;Wheeler, if you will act with us, there is nothing in the gift of the State of New York to which you may not reasonably aspire.&quot; Wheeler declined with &quot;Mr. Conkling, there is nothing in the gift of the State of New York which will compensate me for the forfeiture of my self-respect.&quot;

Wheeler served as president of New York&#x27;s Northern Railroad. He was also president of the New York State Constitutional Convention which met from June 1867 to February 1868. In his speech accepting the position, he made a strong case for racial equality:

When Congress voted for a pay raise in 1873 and made it retroactive for five years (the Salary Grab Act), Wheeler not only voted against the raise but also returned his salary increase to the Treasury Department.

Wheeler was responsible for the so-called Wheeler Compromise of 1875, which settled a volatile political situation in Louisiana but eventually led to the withdrawal of federal troops and the end of Reconstruction.

==Election of 1876==
Wheeler was a delegate to the 1876 Republican National Convention, which had nominated Rutherford B. Hayes for president on the seventh ballot.
Wheeler was considered a &quot;safe&quot; choice for the vice presidential nomination, as he had not made many enemies over the course of his political career, though Roscoe Conkling himself supported the former congressman from New York, Stewart L. Woodford. When the time came for the convention to nominate a vice presidential candidate, congressman Luke P. Poland of Vermont nominated Wheeler, who immediately surged to the lead over Woodford and several other candidates. By the time the roll call reached New York, the result was apparent, and Woodford withdrew, enabling New York to cast all its votes for Wheeler. Wheeler won the nomination with 366 votes to the 89 for his nearest rival Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, who later served on the Electoral Commission which decided the 1876 election in favor of Hayes and Wheeler.

Governor Hayes, when he heard of Wheeler&#x27;s nomination, wrote to his wife Lucy: &quot;I am ashamed to say: Who &quot;is Wheeler?&quot;&quot; Hayes and Wheeler had not served in the House of Representatives at the same time, so Hayes was unfamiliar with his running mate.

At the Republican National Convention, Frederick Douglass asked if the GOP would adhere to its pro-civil rights roots. The advocacy of Hayes and Wheeler, among a faction of Northern Republicans, was to abandon Reconstruction efforts and instead make conciliatory appeals to Southern Whiggery.

==Vice presidency (1877–1881)==
Wheeler was inaugurated on March 4, 1877, and served until March 4, 1881. During Wheeler&#x27;s term, the Hayes administration pursued an alliance between Northern Republicans and Old Southern Whigs, effectively abandoning post-Civil War Reconstruction. Hayes intended for the former Whigs who largely made up the South&#x27;s business and merchant classes to replace the Democratic planter class as the dominant force in Southern government and politics. Events did not play out as Hayes envisioned, which meant that the end of Reconstruction enabled Democrats, largely former supporters of the Confederacy, to reassert control over black residents, including passage of Jim Crow laws that lasted well into the twentieth century.

Since Wheeler was a recent widower, his wife having died one year before he took office, he was a frequent guest at the White House&#x27;s alcohol-free luncheons. As vice president, Wheeler presided over the Senate. According to Hayes, Wheeler &quot;was one of the few Vice Presidents who were on cordial terms, intimate and friendly, with the President. Our family were heartily fond of him.&quot;

Hayes had announced at the start of his administration that he would not run for a second term. Wheeler did not run for the 1880 Republican presidential nomination, and retired at the end of his term.

===Lucy Hayes&#x27; Fishing Trip (1878)===
When First Lady Lucy Webb Hayes found out about Wheeler&#x27;s status as a widower without children, she and her husband felt it was their duty to take the lonely Wheeler into their social circle. Wheeler was grateful for their kindness, and during the spring of 1878, he asked Lucy to accompany him on a fishing trip in the Adirondacks. Lucy accepted and joined Wheeler on May 31. On their first day, they caught a large trout that weighed about 13 pounds. Wheeler sent it to the president; Hayes telegraphed jokingly that he thought it was more like 13 ounces. Hayes was actually surprised at the size of the fish, and had it served at an informal dinner with cabinet members and senators. The next day, Wheeler and Lucy were traveling back to Malone when a group of children began waving red flags. Touched by the act, Wheeler stopped their carriage so he could introduce the first lady to the children. The trip lasted eleven days, and when Lucy and her daughter Fanny returned to Washington, she wrote to Wheeler to thank him for &quot;a wild and joyous time&quot;.


== Post-vice presidency (1881–1887) ==
In January 1881, Wheeler received 10 votes in the New York State Legislature&#x27;s Republican caucus to determine a nominee for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Francis Kernan. The Republican nomination went to Thomas C. Platt, who received 54 caucus votes. The Republicans controlled the legislature, and Platt defeated Kernan 104 votes to 50.

Wheeler retired to Malone following the end of his vice presidential term on March 4, 1881. In May 1881, Platt and Roscoe Conkling resigned their U.S. Senate seats in a dispute with President James A. Garfield over control of patronage in New York, triggering two special elections. In the legislative election for Platt&#x27;s seat, it took six weeks of balloting to elect a candidate. Wheeler&#x27;s name was in consideration, and he received as many as 23 votes before Warner Miller was elected with 76 votes on the 46th ballot.

Wheeler was also a candidate for Conkling&#x27;s seat. The voting went on for several weeks and Wheeler received as many as 50 votes on some ballots before Elbridge G. Lapham won with 92 votes on the 56th ballot.
Wheeler suffered from several illnesses throughout his life and was in increasingly poor health during his later years. He died at his home at 10:10 a.m. on Saturday, June 4, 1887. The funeral was held at the Congregational church in Malone. He was interred next to his wife in Malone&#x27;s Morningside Cemetery on June 7, 1887.

<doc id="89164" wikidata="Q594512" url="?curid=89164" title="Auseklis">
<text>Auseklis is a Latvian pagan god, a stellar deity that represents a celestial body, but possibly not the same as Venus (&quot;Rīta zvaigzne&quot;) - the first &quot;star&quot; (how Latvians call it) to appear in the mornings on the east side of the sky. He is the third most popular deity in Latvian mythology after Saulė and Mēness, but is almost exclusively mentioned in folk songs, as pagan faith gave way to Christianity in Latvia in the 12th century.
== Name ==
The name &quot;Auseklis&quot; stems from the root &quot;aus-&quot; (&#x27;dawn&#x27;), attached to the derivative suffix &quot;-eklis&quot;, and is etymologically related to other Indo-European deities of the dawn.

This deity is also variously known as &quot;Auseklenis&quot;, &quot;Ausekliņš&quot;, &quot;Auseklīts&quot;, &quot;Auseklītis&quot;, &quot;Ausekliņis&quot;, &quot;Auseklius&quot;.

== Role ==
Auseklis is closely associated with Mēness (&quot;moon&quot;). They both are &quot;Dieva dēli&quot; (&quot;sons of God&quot;), as is Ūsiņš, and are thus confused with each other and with other male deities. Auseklis is referred to as male in the context of the &quot;dainas&quot; (folksong), and is seen as the groom of Saules meita (&quot;daughter of the sun&quot;), who came all the way to Germany to court her.

He is also said to be the attendant to a Sun deity and helper in the activities of the &quot;heavenly bath house&quot;.

According to scholar Elza Kokare, Auseklis belongs to a group of heavenly deities that take part in a mythological drama about a &quot;celestial wedding&quot;. Auseklis is seen as a groom of &quot;Saules meita&quot;, a daughter of Saule, the female Baltic sun - the others being moon god &quot;Meness&quot; and twin gods &quot;Dieva deli&quot;. Auseklis, in other accounts, is a guest or member of the bridal cortege at the wedding of Saules meita with another character, or he is deprived of his bride because of Meness&#x27;s quarreling.

Auseklis is often referred to as being very young. As a reflex of this, he is seen as too young to work with the other deities, is very playful, and his horse is either bought by him or for him by the Sun.

According to Marija Gimbutas&#x27;s analysis, Auseklis is a &quot;dievaitis&quot; (&#x27;little god&#x27;) that appears with a horse the Sun gave him, and falls in love with the daughter of the (female) Sun (&quot;Saules dukterims&quot;).

According to Lithuanian folklorist and ethnologist Nijolė Laurinkienė (lt), Haralds Biezais was of the opinion that Auseklis was a male god and a son of Dievs (&quot;Dievo sunus&quot;). He was also part of the &quot;celestial marriage&quot; drama, being the first betrothed of the Sun&#x27;s Daughter (Saules meita).

== Symbol ==

Auseklis is also the name of the eight-pointed star (an isogonal octagram). It is also known as one of the crosses of Lietuvēns (a malevolent spirit). The other cross of Lietuvēns is the pentagram, which symbolizes Venus in other cultures, suggesting that both signs might have originally been symbols of Auseklis. In more modern times, the pentagram is sometimes seen as a symbol of evil, however, originally both signs were used for protection from evil and are named after Lietuvēns because they were used to ward it off. Both signs had to be drawn without lifting the hand to ensure that protection was effective.

In the 1980s, the octagram became the symbol of the third Latvian National Awakening.

<text>Thomas Andrews Hendricks (September 7, 1819 – November 25, 1885) was an American politician and lawyer from Indiana who served as the 16th governor of Indiana from 1873 to 1877 and the 21st vice president of the United States from March until his death in November 1885. Hendricks represented Indiana in the U.S. House of Representatives (1851–1855) and the U.S. Senate (1863–1869). He also represented Shelby County, Indiana, in the Indiana General Assembly (1848–1850) and as a delegate to the 1851 Indiana constitutional convention. In addition, Hendricks served as commissioner of the United States General Land Office (1855–1859). Hendricks, a popular member of the Democratic Party, was a fiscal conservative. He defended the Democratic position in the U.S. Senate during the American Civil War and Reconstruction era and voted against the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. He also opposed Radical Reconstruction and President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s removal from office following Johnson&#x27;s impeachment in the U.S. House.

Born in Muskingum County, Ohio, Hendricks moved to Indiana, with his parents in 1820; the family settled in Shelby County in 1822. After graduating from Hanover College, class of 1841, Hendricks studied law in Shelbyville, Indiana, and Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. He was admitted to the Indiana bar in 1843. Hendricks began his law practice in Shelbyville, moved to Indianapolis in 1860, and established a private law practice with Oscar B. Hord in 1862. The firm evolved into Baker &amp; Daniels, one of the state&#x27;s leading law firms. Hendricks also ran for election as Indiana&#x27;s governor three times, but won only once. In 1872, on his third and final attempt, Hendricks defeated General Thomas M. Brown by a margin of 1,148 votes. His term as governor of Indiana was marked by numerous challenges, including a strong Republican majority in the Indiana General Assembly, the economic Panic of 1873, and an economic depression. One of Hendricks&#x27;s lasting legacies during his tenure as governor was initiating discussions to fund construction of the present-day Indiana Statehouse, which was completed after he left office. A memorial to Hendricks was installed on the southeast corner of its grounds in 1890.

Hendricks, a lifelong Democrat, was his party&#x27;s nominee for vice president as the running mate of New York governor Samuel Tilden in the controversial presidential election of 1876. Although they won the popular vote, Tilden and Hendricks lost the election by one vote in the Electoral College to the Republican Party&#x27;s presidential nominee, Rutherford B. Hayes, and his vice presidential running mate, William A. Wheeler. Despite his poor health, Hendricks accepted his party&#x27;s nomination for vice president in the election of 1884 as Grover Cleveland&#x27;s running mate. Cleveland and Hendricks won the election, but Hendricks only served as vice president for about eight months, from March 4, 1885, until his death on November 25, 1885, in Indianapolis. He is buried in Indianapolis&#x27;s Crown Hill Cemetery.

==Early life and education==
Hendricks was born on September 7, 1819, in Muskingum County, Ohio, near East Fultonham and Zanesville. He was the second of eight children born to John and Jane (Duke) Hendricks. His father was from Pennsylvania, and his mother was from Virginia.

In 1820 Hendricks moved with his parents and older brother to Madison in Jefferson County, Indiana, at the urging of Thomas&#x27;s uncle, William Hendricks, a successful politician who served as a U.S. Representative, a U.S. Senator (1825–1837), and as the third governor of Indiana (1822–1825). Thomas&#x27;s family first settled on a farm near his uncle&#x27;s home in Madison, and moved to Shelby County, Indiana, in 1822. Hendricks&#x27;s father, a successful farmer who operated a general store, became involved in politics, including appointment from President Andrew Jackson as deputy surveyor of public lands for his district. Indiana&#x27;s Democratic Party leaders frequently visited the Hendricks home in Shelbyville, and from an early age Hendricks was influenced to enter politics.

Hendricks attended local schools (Shelby County Seminary and Greensburg Academy). He graduated from Hanover College in Hanover, Indiana, in 1841, in the same class as Albert G. Porter, also a future governor of Indiana. After college Hendricks read law with Judge Stephen Major in Shelbyville, and in 1843 he took an eight-month law course at a school operated by his uncle, Judge Alexander Thomson in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. Hendricks returned to Indiana, was admitted to the bar in 1843 and established a private practice in Shelbyville.

==Marriage and family==
Hendricks married Eliza Carol Morgan of North Bend, Ohio, on September 26, 1845, after a two-year courtship. The couple met when Eliza was visiting her married sister, Mrs. Elizabeth Morgan West, in Shelbyville. The couple&#x27;s only child, a son named Morgan, was born on January 16, 1848, and died in 1851, at the age of three. Thomas and Eliza Hendricks moved to Indianapolis in 1860 and resided from 1865 to 1872 at 1526 South New Jersey Street, now known as the Bates-Hendricks House.

==Early political career==
Hendricks remained active in the legal community and in state and national politics from the 1840s until his death in 1885.

===Indiana legislature and constitutional convention===
Hendricks began his political career in 1848, when he served a one-year term in the Indiana House of Representatives after defeating Martin M. Ray, the Whig candidate. Hendricks was also one of the two Shelby County delegates to the 1850–1851 Indiana constitutional convention. He served on committee that created the organization of the state&#x27;s townships and counties and decided on the taxation and financial portion of the state constitution. Hendricks also debated the clauses on the powers of the different offices and argued in favor of a powerful judiciary and the abolishment of grand juries.

===U.S. Congressman===
Hendricks represented Indiana as a Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives (1851–1855) in the Thirty-second and Thirty-third Congresses from March 4, 1851, to March 3, 1855. Hendricks was chairman of the U.S. Committee on Mileage (Thirty-second Congress) and served on the U.S. Committee on Invalid Pensions (Thirty-third Congress). He supported the principle of popular sovereignty and voted in favor of the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854, which expanded slavery into the western territories of the United States. Both positions were unpopular in Hendricks&#x27;s home district in Indiana and led to defeat in his re-election bid to Congress in 1854.

===Land office commissioner===
In 1855 President Franklin Pierce appointed Hendricks as commissioner of the United States General Land Office in Washington, D.C. His job supervising 180 clerks and a four-year backlog of work was a demanding one, especially at a time when westward expansion meant that the government was going through one of its largest periods of land sales. During his tenure, the land office issued 400,000 land patents and settled 20,000 disputed land cases. Although Hendricks made thousands of decisions related to disputed land claims, only a few were reversed in court, but he did receive some criticism: &quot;He was the first commissioner who apparently had no background or qualifications for the job. ... Some of the rulings and letters during Hendricks&#x27;s tenure were not always correct.&quot;

Hendricks resigned as land office commissioner in 1859 and returned to Shelby County, Indiana. The cause of his departure was not recorded, but potential reasons may have been differences of opinion with President James Buchanan, Pierce&#x27;s successor. Hendricks resisted Buchanan&#x27;s efforts to make land office clerks patronage positions, objected to the pro-slavery policies of the Buchanan administration, and supported the homestead bill, which Buchanan opposed.

===Candidate for Indiana governor===
Hendricks ran for governor of Indiana three times (1860, 1868, and 1872), and succeeded only on his third attempt. He became the first Democrat to win a gubernatorial seat after the American Civil War.

In 1860 Hendricks, who ran with David Turpie as his running mate, lost to the Republican candidates, Henry S. Lane and Oliver P. Morton. Three of the four men (Lane, Morton, and Hendricks) eventually served as Indiana&#x27;s governor, and all four became U.S. senators.

In 1868, his second campaign for Indiana governor, Hendricks lost to Conrad Baker, the incumbent, by 961 votes. Baker, who would later become one of Hendricks&#x27;s law partners, was elected as lieutenant governor in 1864 and became governor after Morton was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1867. In the national election, Republican nominees Ulysses S. Grant and his running mate, Schuyler Colfax of Indiana, carried the state by a margin of more than 20,000 votes, suggesting that the close race for governor demonstrated Hendricks&#x27;s popularity in Indiana. Following his defeat in his second gubernatorial race Hendricks retired from the U.S. Senate in March 1869 and returned to his private law practice in Indianapolis but remained connected to state and national politics.

In 1872, his third campaign to become governor of Indiana, Hendricks narrowly defeated General Thomas M. Browne, 189,424 votes to 188,276.

===Law practice===
In addition to his years of service in various political offices in Indiana and Washington, D.C., Hendricks maintained an active law practice, which he first established in Shelbyville in 1843 and continued after his relocation to Indianapolis. Hendricks and Oscar B. Hord established a law firm in 1862, where Hendricks practiced until the Indiana General Assembly elected him to represent Indiana in the U.S. Senate in 1863. The law practice was renamed Hendricks, Hord, and Hendricks in 1866, after Abram W. Hendricks joined the firm. In 1873 it was renamed Baker, Hord, and Hendricks, after Conrad Baker, the outgoing governor of Indiana, joined the firm and Hendricks succeeded him as governor. In 1888 the firm passed to Baker&#x27;s son, who partnered with Edward Daniels, and it became known as Baker &amp; Daniels, which grew into one of the state&#x27;s leading law firms.

==High office==

===U.S. Senator===
Hendricks represented Indiana in the U.S. Senate from 1863 to 1869, during the final years of the American Civil War and the early years of the Reconstruction era. Military reverses in the Civil War, some unpopular decisions in the Lincoln administration, and Democratic control of the Indiana General Assembly helped Hendricks win election to the U.S. Senate. His six years in the Senate covered the Thirty-eighth, Thirty-ninth, and Fortieth Congresses, where Hendricks was a leader of the small Democratic minority and a member of the opposition who was often overruled.

Hendricks challenged what he thought was radical legislation, including the military draft and issuing greenbacks; however, he supported the Union and prosecution of the war, consistently voting in favor of wartime appropriations. Hendricks adamantly opposed Radical Reconstruction. After the war he argued that the Southern states had never been out of the Union and were therefore entitled to representation in the U.S. Congress. Hendricks also maintained that Congress had no authority over the affairs of state governments.

Hendricks voted against the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution that would, upon ratification, grant voting rights to males of all races and abolish slavery. Hendricks felt it was not the right time, so soon after the Civil War, to make fundamental changes to the U.S. Constitution. Although Hendricks supported freedom for African Americans, stating, &quot;He is free; now let him remain free,&quot; he unsuccessfully opposed reconstruction legislation. Hendricks did not believe in racial equality. For example, in a congressional debate with Indiana Senator Oliver P. Morton, Hendricks argued:

Hendricks also opposed the attempt to remove President Andrew Johnson from office following his impeachment in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Hendricks&#x27;s views were often misinterpreted by his political opponents in Indiana. When the Republicans regained a majority in the Indiana General Assembly in 1868, the same year Hendricks&#x27;s U.S. Senate term expired, he lost reelection to a second term, and was succeeded by Republican Congressman-elect Daniel D. Pratt, who resigned the U.S. House seat to which he had been elected in 1868 in order to accept the Senate seat.

===Governor of Indiana===
In 1872 Hendricks was elected as the governor of Indiana in his third bid for the office. An indication of Hendricks&#x27;s growing national popularity occurred during the presidential election of 1872; the Democrats nominated Horace Greeley, the Liberal Republican candidate. Greeley died soon after the election, but before the Electoral College cast its ballots; 42 of 63 Democratic electors previously pledged to Greeley voted for Hendricks.

Hendricks served as governor of Indiana from January 13, 1873, to January 8, 1877, a difficult period of post-war economic depression following the financial Panic of 1873. Indiana experienced high unemployment, business failures, labor strikes, and falling farm prices. Hendricks twice called out the state militia to end workers&#x27; strikes, one by miners in Clay County, and one by railroad workers&#x27; in Logansport.

Although Hendricks succeeded in encouraging legislation enacting election and judiciary reform, the Republican-controlled legislature prevented him from achieving many of his other legislative goals. In 1873 Hendricks signed the Baxter bill, a controversial piece of temperance legislation that established a strict form of local option, even though he personally had favored a licensing law. Hendricks signed the legislation because he thought the bill was constitutional and reflected the majority view of the Indiana General Assembly and the will of Indiana&#x27;s citizens. The law proved to be unenforceable and was repealed in 1875; it was replaced by a licensing system that Hendricks had preferred.

One of Hendricks&#x27;s lasting legacies during his tenure as governor began with discussion to fund construction of a new Indiana Statehouse. The existing structure, which had been in use since 1835, had become too small, forcing the growing state government to rent additional buildings around Indianapolis. Besides its size, the dilapidated capitol building was in need of major repair. The roof in the Hall of Representatives had collapsed in 1867 and public inspectors condemned the building in 1873. The cornerstone for the present-day state capital building was laid in 1880, after Hendricks left office, and he delivered the keynote speech at the ceremony. The new statehouse was completed eight years later and remains in use as Indiana&#x27;s state capitol building.

===Vice presidential nominee===
Hendricks ran for vice president in 1876 and 1884; he won in 1884. The Democrats also nominated Hendricks for the vice presidency in 1880, but he declined for health reasons. In 1880, while on a visit to Hot Springs, Arkansas, Hendricks suffered a bout of paralysis, but returned to public life. No one outside of his family and doctors knew his health was failing. Two years later he was no longer able to stand.

In the disputed presidential election of 1876 Hendricks ran as the Democratic candidate for vice president with New York governor Samuel Tilden as the party&#x27;s presidential nominee. Hendricks did not attend the Democratic convention in Saint Louis, but the party was pursuing the strategy of carrying the Solid South along with New York and Indiana. The Indiana delegation urged Hendricks as the vice-presidential nominee, and he was nominated unanimously.

Although they received the majority of the popular vote, Tilden and Hendricks lost the disputed election by one vote in Electoral College balloting to Rutherford B. Hayes, the Republican Party&#x27;s presidential nominee, and William A. Wheeler, his vice-presidential running mate. A fifteen-member Electoral Commission that included five representatives each from the House, Senate, and U.S. Supreme Court determined the outcome of the contested electoral votes. In an 8 to 7 partisan vote, the commission awarded all twenty of the disputed votes from South Carolina, Louisiana, Florida, and Oregon to the Republican candidates. Tilden and Hendricks accepted the decision, despite deep disappointment at the outcome.

As chairman of the Indiana delegation, Hendricks attended the Democratic Party&#x27;s national convention in 1884 in Chicago, where he was again nominated as its vice-presidential candidate by a unanimous vote. Grover Cleveland was the party&#x27;s presidential nominee in the 1884 presidential election; once again the Democrats&#x27; strategy was to win New York, Cleveland&#x27;s home state, and Hendricks&#x27;s home state of Indiana, plus the electoral votes of the Solid South. Democrats narrowly won New York, Indiana, and two more Northern states plus the Solid South to secure the election.

==Vice presidency (1885)==
Hendricks maintained a strong working relationship with President Cleveland during his brief tenure. He spoke highly of Cleveland&#x27;s character and described him as &quot;courteous and affable&quot;. Hendricks, who had been in poor health for several years, served as Cleveland&#x27;s vice president during the last eight months of his life, from his inauguration on March 4 until his death on November 25, 1885. The vice presidency remained vacant after Hendricks&#x27;s death until Levi P. Morton assumed office in 1889. 
On September 8, 1885, in Indianapolis, Hendricks made a controversial speech in support of Irish independence. Soon afterwards, Boston machine politician Martin Lomasney named the Hendricks Club after him.

===Death and legacy===
Hendricks died unexpectedly of a heart attack on November 25, 1885, during a trip home to Indianapolis. He complained of feeling ill the morning of November 24, went to bed early, and died in his sleep the following day, aged 66. His reported last words were &quot;Free at last!&quot;.

Hendricks&#x27;s funeral service at Saint Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Cathedral in Indianapolis was a large one. Hundreds of dignitaries were in attendance, including President Grover Cleveland, and thousands of people gathered along the city&#x27;s street to see the 1.2-mile-long funeral cortege as it traveled from downtown Indianapolis to Crown Hill Cemetery, where his remains were interred.

Hendricks, a popular member of the Democratic Party, remained on good terms with both Democrats and Republicans. He was a fiscal conservative and a powerful orator who was known for his honesty and firm convictions.

Hendricks was one of four vice-presidential candidates from Indiana who were elected during the period 1868 to 1920, when Indiana&#x27;s electoral votes were critical to winning a national election. (The three other men from Indiana who became U.S. vice presidents during this period were Schuyler Colfax, Charles W. Fairbanks, and Thomas R. Marshall.) Five other men from Indiana, George Washington Julian, Joseph Lane, Judge Samuel Williams, John W. Kern, and William Hayden English, lost their bids for the vice presidency during this time period.

==Honors and tributes==

* Hendricks remains the only vice president who did not serve as president whose portrait appears on U.S. paper currency. An engraved portrait of Hendricks appears on a $10 &quot;tombstone&quot; silver certificate. The currency note&#x27;s nickname is derived from the tombstone-shaped border outlining Hendricks&#x27;s portrait.
* The Bates-Hendricks House, where the family lived from 1865 to 1872, is located in Indianapolis at 1526 South New Jersey Street, Indianapolis. The home was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 11, 1977.
* Thomas A. Hendricks Library (Hendricks Hall) at Hanover College, which overlooks the Ohio River near Madison, Indiana, was built in 1903. Hendricks&#x27;s widow, Eliza, provided funding for the project as a tribute to her late husband, an alumnus of the college. The library was added to the National Register on February 26, 1982.
*The Thomas A. Hendricks Monument was installed on the southeast corner of the state capitol building&#x27;s grounds in 1890. At it is the tallest bronze statue on the statehouse grounds.
*The community of Hendricks in Minnesota and the adjacent lake were named in his honor.

<text>Levi Parsons Morton (May 16, 1824 – May 16, 1920) was the 22nd vice president of the United States from 1889 to 1893. He also served as United States ambassador to France, as a U.S. representative from New York, and as the thirty-first governor of New York.

The son of a Congregational minister, Morton was born in Vermont and educated at public schools in Vermont and Massachusetts. He trained for a business career by clerking in stores and working in mercantile establishments in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. After relocating to New York City, Morton became a successful merchant, cotton broker, and investment banker.

Active in politics as a Republican, Morton was an ally of Roscoe Conkling. He was twice elected to the United States House of Representatives, and he served one full term, and one partial one (March 4, 1879 – March 21, 1881). In 1880, Republican presidential nominee James A. Garfield offered Morton the vice presidential nomination in an effort to win over Conkling loyalists who were disappointed that their choice for president, Ulysses S. Grant, had lost the Republican nomination to Garfield. Conkling advised Morton to decline, which he did. Garfield then offered the vice presidential nomination to another Conkling ally, Chester A. Arthur, who accepted.

After Garfield and Arthur were elected, Garfield nominated Morton to be Minister Plenipotentiary to France, and Morton served in Paris until 1885. In 1888, Morton was nominated for vice president on the Republican ticket with presidential nominee Benjamin Harrison; they were elected, and Morton served as vice president from 1889 to 1893. In 1894, Morton was the successful Republican nominee for governor of New York, and he served one term, 1895 to 1896. In retirement, Morton resided in New York City and Rhinebeck, New York. He died from pneumonia on his 96th birthday in 1920, and was buried at Rhinebeck Cemetery.

==Early life==
Morton was born in Shoreham, Vermont, on May 16, 1824, one of six children born to the Reverend Daniel Oliver Morton, a Congregational minister, and Lucretia Parsons. Morton was of entirely English ancestry, all of his immigrant ancestors came to North America from England during the Puritan migration to New England. His paternal ancestors included Captain Nathaniel Morton of Plymouth Colony. Morton was named for his mother&#x27;s brother Reverend Levi Parsons (1792–1822), a clergyman who was also the first U.S. missionary to work in Palestine. His older brother, Daniel Oliver Morton, served as the Mayor of Toledo, Ohio, from 1849 to 1850. His younger sister, Mary Morton, was married to William F. Grinnell, and was the mother of William Morton Grinnell, who served as the Third Assistant Secretary of State while Morton was vice president.

Morton&#x27;s family moved to Springfield, Vermont, in 1832, when his father became the minister of the Congregational church there. Rev. Morton headed the congregation during the construction of the brick colonial revival-style church on Main Street that is still in use. Levi Morton was considered by his Springfield peers to be a &quot;leader in all affairs in which schoolboys usually engage.&quot; The Morton family later moved to Winchendon, Massachusetts, where Reverend Morton continued to serve as a church pastor. In 1838, Levi Morton graduated from the academy in Shoreham, Vermont.

==Career==
===Businessman===
Morton decided on a business career, and in 1838 he began work as a general store clerk in Enfield, Massachusetts. He taught school in Boscawen, New Hampshire, and engaged in mercantile pursuits in Hanover, New Hampshire, then moved to Boston to work in the Beebe &amp; Co. importing business. He eventually settled in New York City, where he entered the dry goods business in partnership with George Blake Grinnell and became a successful cotton broker. He then established himself as one of the country&#x27;s top investment bankers in a firm he founded, Morton, Bliss &amp; Co., which was later reorganized as the Morton Trust Company.

During the American Civil War, Morton supported the Union. Unable to obtain cotton from the southern states because of the Union blockade, Morton suspended his cotton business for the duration of the conflict. After the war, Morton and his British partner, Sir John Rose, recovered their financial positions and improved their political fortunes by using their contacts to assist the United States and England to settle the &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims. When England agreed to pay a $15 million settlement (about $307 million in 2020), Morton&#x27;s bank was chosen to facilitate payments to claimants in the United States.

In addition to operating Morton, Bliss &amp; Co., Morton was active in several other businesses. These included the board of directors of the New York Viaduct Railway Company, Guaranty Trust Company, Washington Life Insurance Company, Home Insurance Company, and Equitable Life Assurance Society. In addition, he was an investor in numerous ventures, including the Rio Grande, Sierra Madre &amp; Pacific Railway, Virginia Iron, Coal &amp; Coke Company, and Intercontinental Rubber Company. Morton also maintained a farm on his estate, where he raised prizewinning horses and cattle.

In 1909, Morton received an offer from J. P. Morgan to merge the Morton company with the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. He accepted, after which he retired from most business pursuits.

===Republican activist===
Active in politics as a Republican, in 1876, Morton was named finance chairman for the Republican National Committee. Also in 1876, Morton was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the 45th Congress. In recognition of his service to the party, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Morton as an honorary commissioner to the Paris Exhibition of 1878.

===Civic leader===
Morton was involved in many civic and charitable causes. In 1883, he was one of the founders of the Metropolitan Opera. In 1886, he was appointed to the Hobart College board of trustees. He served for several years, including a term as chairman of the board. He also served on the board of trustees of the American Museum of Natural History.

===Member of Congress===

Identified with the Stalwart faction of Republicans led by Roscoe Conkling, in 1878 Morton was elected to represent Manhattan in the 46th Congress. He was reelected to the 47th Congress in 1880, and served from March 4, 1879, until his resignation on March 21, 1881. During Morton&#x27;s House tenure, he served as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. On the currency issue, which dominated discussions of U.S. economic policy for several decades, Morton consistently advocated for the gold standard.

The 1880 Republican National Convention was dominated by &quot;Half-Breed&quot; supporters of James G. Blaine and Stalwart supporters of Ulysses S. Grant for the presidential nomination. James A. Garfield, who was not affiliated with either faction, but was a friend of Blaine, won the nomination and attempted to win over Stalwarts by asking Morton to be his vice presidential running mate. Conkling, who had managed Grant&#x27;s campaign, advised Morton to decline, which Morton did. Garfield&#x27;s supporters then turned to Chester A. Arthur, a fellow Stalwart and close Conkling friend. Conkling also advised Arthur to decline, but Arthur accepted; Garfield and he were narrowly elected over their Democratic opponents.

===Minister to France===
During the 1880 campaign, Morton and other Stalwarts believed that Garfield had committed to appoint Morton as Secretary of the Treasury. After Garfield won, they were incensed when he claimed he had never made such a promise. As a consolation, Garfield offered Morton appointment as Secretary of the Navy. Morton initially accepted, but then declined after Conkling advised him to turn it down.

After Morton declined to join the cabinet, Garfield appointed him as Minister to France. Morton accepted, and served from 1881 to 1885, continuing in office after Garfield was assassinated and Arthur became president.

Morton was very popular in France. He helped commercial relations between the two countries run smoothly during his term, and in Paris on October 24, 1881, he placed the first rivet in the construction of the Statue of Liberty. After completion of the statue, he accepted it on behalf of the United States in a ceremony on July 4, 1884, when he signed an agreement with the Union Franco Americaine, the organization formed in France to finance the creation of the statue.

=== U.S. Senate candidate===

After returning to the United States, Morton was a candidate for U.S. Senator in 1885. He lost the Republican nomination to William M. Evarts, who went on to win election by the full New York State Legislature. He was again a candidate in 1887. Republicans controlled the legislature, meaning their nominee would win the election. Incumbent Warner Miller was recognized as a member of the Half-Breed faction, and had succeeded state Republican boss Thomas C. Platt in the Senate. Platt had succeeded Conkling as leader of the Stalwarts, and was determined to see Miller defeated, so he backed Morton against Miller. A third candidate, Frank Hiscock, was not affiliated with either faction and had little initial support. After 17 ballots failed to produce a nominee, Morton withdrew and asked his supporters to back Hiscock to ensure that Miller would not be reelected. Hiscock was chosen on the 18th ballot, and won the election by defeating Democrat Smith Mead Weed.

==Vice presidency (1889–1893)==

At the 1888 Republican National Convention, Republicans nominated Benjamin Harrison for president. For vice president, the delegates considered Morton, William Walter Phelps, William O&#x27;Connell Bradley and several other candidates. James G. Blaine&#x27;s support had helped Harrison attain the presidential nomination. In an echo of the Stalwart-Half Breed rivalry, Blaine backed Phelps for vice president, but the New York delegation, led by Thomas C. Platt refused to consider him. Though he had been an opponent of the Stalwarts, Former senator Warner Miller, a member of the New York delegation, nominated Morton. It quickly became apparent that Morton had enough delegate support to win, and he attained the nomination on the first ballot with 591 votes to 119 for Phelps, 103 for Bradley, and 11 for Blanche K. Bruce.

In the general election, Harrison and Morton lost the popular vote to the Democratic candidates, incumbent president Grover Cleveland and Allen G. Thurman, but won the electoral college vote. Harrison and Morton took office on March 4, 1889, and served until March 4, 1893.

Harrison&#x27;s wife Caroline was frequently ill during his administration, and she died in 1892. As Second Lady of the United States, Morton&#x27;s wife Anna frequently served as Harrison&#x27;s hostess and performed the duties of the First Lady.

As vice president, Morton presided over the U.S. Senate. He was not close to Harrison personally, and Harrison did not often consult with him on political matters. A major Harrison initiative was the Lodge Bill, which would permit the use of federal force to ensure the voting rights of male African Americans in the former Confederacy. Southern Democrats conducted a filibuster, believing the bill would restore Reconstruction era-like Republican rule. Republicans from the western states who supported free silver believed the most pressing issue was the need for an inflated currency to stimulate the economy. As a result, the free silver Republicans joined Democrats in opposing consideration of the Lodge Bill.

The Lodge Bill reached the Senate floor when a tie enabled Morton to cast the deciding vote in favor of consideration. Southern Democrats filibustered again, and Morton refused to aid Republican senators in ending it. Republicans in the Senate then attempted to persuade Morton to allow a Republican senator to preside, but Morton insisted on remaining in the chair. On January 26, 1891, a resolution to replace consideration of the Lodge Bill with a bill on a different subject passed by a vote of 35 to 34, and the Lodge Bill died.

Harrison blamed Morton for the Lodge Bill&#x27;s failure. At the 1892 Republican National Convention, Harrison was nominated for reelection but delegates replaced Morton with Whitelaw Reid. Harrison and Reid went on to lose the 1892 election to Democratic nominees Grover Cleveland and Adlai E. Stevenson.

==Post-vice presidency (1893–1920)==

===Governor of New York (1895–1896)===

In 1894, Morton was elected governor of New York, defeating Democratic nominee David B. Hill and several minor party candidates. He served one two-year term, January 1, 1895, to December 31, 1896. One initiative in which Morton was involved as governor was the consolidation of several New York City-area municipalities as the City of Greater New York, which took effect on January 1, 1898.

Another Morton priority was civil service reform. Morton pursued a moderate course on the issue, but remained firm in his support, which placed him in opposition to political party bosses who favored the spoils system. As a result, in 1896 the Republican Party nominated Frank S. Black, who was perceived as closer to the party bosses than Morton.

Morton was a leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 1896, but the delegates chose William McKinley. Morton was then considered for the vice presidential nomination, but McKinley&#x27;s campaign manager, Mark Hanna, was opposed, and the nomination went to Garret Hobart. After he completed his term as governor, Morton returned to his business career and management of his investments.

===Later life===

In 1890, Morton became one of the first members of the District of Columbia Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. He was also a member of the General Society of Colonial Wars.

In retirement, he served as president of the Metropolitan Club. He was preceded in that office by J. Pierpont Morgan and succeeded by Frank Knight Sturgis He was also a member of the Union League Club of New York, and served as president of the New York Zoological Society from 1897 to 1909.

Morton became ill during the winter of 1919 to 1920; a cold developed into bronchitis, and he eventually contracted pneumonia, which proved fatal. He died in Rhinebeck, New York, on May 16, 1920, his 96th birthday. After a memorial service at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, he was interred at Rhinebeck Cemetery. At age 96, Morton was the longest living vice president of the United States until John Nance Garner, who died at age 98, surpassed him in 1964.

==Personal life==
On October 15, 1856, Morton married Lucy Young Kimball, the daughter of Elijah Huntingdon Kimball and Sarah Wetmore Hinsdale, in Flatlands, Brooklyn. They had one child, daughter Carrie, who died in infancy in 1857.

After his first wife&#x27;s death in 1871, Morton married Anna Livingston Reade Street in 1873. They were the parents of five daughters and a son who died in infancy.

* Edith Livingston Morton (1874–1964), who married William Corcoran Eustis (1862–1921) in 1900.
* Lena Kearney Morton (1875–1904).
* Helen Stuyvesant Morton (1876–1952), who married the Duke of Valençay, a son of Boson de Talleyrand-Périgord. They divorced in 1904, after less than a year of marriage.
* Lewis Parsons Morton (1877–1878).
* Alice Morton (1879–1917), who married Winthrop Rutherfurd, a son of Lewis Morris Rutherfurd, in 1902.
* Mary Morton (1881–1932), who adopted two children, Lewis Peter Morton and Mirian Morton.

In 1902, Alice Morton founded Holiday Farm, a convalescent home for children. Children who attended were picked up at Grand Central Station and brought to the farm in Rhinebeck. Train fare, board and clothing were provided free. In 1917, Vincent Astor served as president, with Helen Dinsmore Huntington as secretary. Holiday Farm later developed into the Astor Home for Children.

==Honors==
In 1881, Morton received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Dartmouth College. In 1882, Middlebury College presented him with an honorary LL.D. As an honorary alumnus, Morton frequently attended Dartmouth alumni gatherings in New York.

==Legacy==
The Mortons lived at Ellerslie, an estate near Rhinecliff, New York. The manor home no longer exists, but several outbuildings survive as a local historic site. Anna L. and Levi Morton erected the Morton Memorial Library in Rhinecliff in memory of their daughter Lena. It was dedicated in 1908 and is listed on the National and State Registers of Historic Places.

The Village of Morton Grove, Illinois, a Chicago suburb founded along the path of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, was named for Morton. He received the honor after he provided the financing necessary for the railway to expand its operations into Michigan and Wisconsin beginning in the 1870s.

Morton spent summers in Newport, Rhode Island, at a Bellevue Avenue mansion called &quot;Fairlawn&quot;. The home is now owned by Salve Regina University and houses the Pell Center of International Relations and Public Policy. Morton also left another Newport property to the city for use as a park. Located at the corner of Coggeshall and Morton avenues (the latter formerly Brenton Road), the site was named Morton Park in Morton&#x27;s honor.

In 1885, Morton purchased a home and land in Hanover, New Hampshire, which he donated to Dartmouth College. The college used the home until 1900, when it was torn down to make way for the school&#x27;s Webster Hall. Morton also endowed the Daniel O. Morton Scholarship at Dartmouth. In addition, he endowed scholarships at Middlebury College, one in honor of Daniel Morton and another in honor of Levi Parsons.

Morton also owned a summer retreat on Eagle Island on Upper Saranac Lake in the Adirondack Park. The home&#x27;s design, created by architect William L. Coulter, was done in the Great Camps style. The Morton family later sold the property to banker Henry Graves. In 1938, Graves donated the site to the Girl Scouts, who operated a summer camp there for seventy years.

A likeness of Morton is included in the United States Senate Vice Presidential Bust Collection at the U.S. Capitol. The Morton bust was sculpted by Francis Edwin Elwell and was placed on display in 1891.

A portrait of Morton is included in the New York State Hall of Governors. The painting was created by Albany, New York, artist George Hughes (1863–1932) in 1896 and was presented to the state in 1900.

<doc id="89188" wikidata="Q518328" url="?curid=89188" title="Methylation">
<text>Methylation, in the chemical sciences, is the addition of a methyl group on a substrate, or the substitution of an atom (or group) by a methyl group. Methylation is a form of alkylation, with a methyl group replacing a hydrogen atom. These terms are commonly used in chemistry, biochemistry, soil science, and biology.

In biological systems, methylation is catalyzed by enzymes; such methylation can be involved in modification of heavy metals, regulation of gene expression, regulation of protein function, and RNA processing. &quot;In vitro&quot; methylation of tissue samples is also a way to reduce some histological staining artifacts. The reverse of methylation is demethylation.

==In biology==
In biological systems, methylation is accomplished by enzymes. Methylation can modify heavy metals and can regulate gene expression, RNA processing, and protein function. It is a key process underlying epigenetics. Sources of methyl groups include S-methylmethionine, methyl folate, methyl B12.

===Methanogenesis===
Methanogenesis, the process that generates methane from CO2, involves a series of methylation reactions. These reactions are caused by a set of enzymes harbored by a family of anaerobic microbes.

In reverse methanogenesis, methane is the methylating agent.

===O-methyltransferases===

A wide variety of phenols undergo O-methylation to give anisole derivatives. This process, catalyzed by such enzymes as caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, is a key reaction in the biosynthesis of lignols, percursors to lignin, a major structural component of plants.

Plants produce flavonoids and isoflavones with methylations on hydroxyl groups, i.e. methoxy bonds. This 5-O-methylation affects the flavonoid&#x27;s water solubility. Examples are 5-O-methylgenistein, 5-O-methylmyricetin, and 5-O-methylquercetin (azaleatin).

===Proteins===
Along with ubiquitination and phosphorylation, methylation is a major biochemical process for modifying protein function. The most prevalent protein methylations affect arginine and lysine residue of specific histones. Otherwise histidine, glutamate, asparagine, cysteine are susceptible to methylation. Some of these products include &quot;S&quot;-methylcysteine, two isomers of &quot;N&quot;-methylhistidine, and two isomers of &quot;N&quot;-methylarginine.

====Methionine synthase====
Methionine synthase regenerates methionine (Met) from homocysteine (Hcy). The overall reaction transforms 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (N5-MeTHF) into tetrahydrofolate (THF) while transferring a methyl group to Hcy to form Met. Methionine Syntheses can be cobalamin-dependent and cobalamin-independent: Plants have both, animals depend on the methylcobalamin-dependent form.

In methylcobalamin-dependent forms of the enzyme, the reaction proceeds by two steps in a ping-pong reaction. The enzyme is initially primed into a reactive state by the transfer of a methyl group from N5-MeTHF to Co(I) in enzyme-bound cobalamin ((Cob), also known as vitamine B12)) ,
, forming methyl-cobalamin(Me-Cob) that now contains Me-Co(III) and activating the enzyme. Then, a Hcy that has coordinated to an enzyme-bound zinc to form a reactive thiolate reacts with the Me-Cob. The activated methyl group is transferred from Me-Cob to the Hcy thiolate, which regenerates Co(I) in Cob, and Met is released from the enzyme.

===Heavy metals: arsenic, mercury, cadmium===
Biomethylation is the pathway for converting some heavy elements into more mobile or more lethal derivatives that can enter the food chain. The biomethylation of arsenic compounds starts with the formation of methanearsonates. Thus, trivalent inorganic arsenic compounds are methylated to give methanearsonate. S-adenosylmethionine is the methyl donor. The methanearsonates are the precursors to dimethylarsonates, again by the cycle of reduction (to methylarsonous acid) followed by a second methylation. Related pathways are found in the microbial methylation of mercury to methylmercury.

=== Epigenetic methylation ===
====DNA methylation ====
DNA methylation is the conversion of the cytosine to 5-methylcytosine. The formation of Me-CpG is catalyzed by the enzyme DNA methyltransferase. In vertebrates, DNA methylation typically occurs at CpG sites (cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites—that is, sites where a cytosine is directly followed by a guanine in the DNA sequence). In mammals, DNA methylation is common in body cells, and methylation of CpG sites seems to be the default. Human DNA has about 80–90% of CpG sites methylated, but there are certain areas, known as CpG islands, that are CG-rich (high cytosine and guanine content, made up of about 65% CG residues), wherein none is methylated. These are associated with the promoters of 56% of mammalian genes, including all ubiquitously expressed genes. One to two percent of the human genome are CpG clusters, and there is an inverse relationship between CpG methylation and transcriptional activity. Methylation contributing to epigenetic inheritance can occur through either DNA methylation or protein methylation. Improper methylations of human genes can lead to disease development, including cancer.

In honey bees, DNA methylation is associated with alternative splicing and gene regulation based on functional genomic research published in 2013. In addition, DNA methylation is associated with expression changes in immune genes when honey bees were under lethal viral infection. Several review papers have been published on the topics of DNA methylation in social insects.

====RNA methylation====
RNA methylation occurs in different RNA species viz. tRNA, rRNA, mRNA, tmRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, miRNA, and viral RNA. Different catalytic strategies are employed for RNA methylation by a variety of RNA-methyltransferases. RNA methylation is thought to have existed before DNA methylation in the early forms of life evolving on earth.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common and abundant methylation modification in RNA molecules (mRNA) present in eukaryotes. 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) also commonly occurs in various RNA molecules. Recent data strongly suggest that m6A and 5-mC RNA methylation affects the regulation of various biological processes such as RNA stability and mRNA translation, and that abnormal RNA methylation contributes to etiology of human diseases.

In social insects such as honey bees, RNA methylation is studied as a possible epigenetic mechanism underlying aggression via reciprocal crosses.

====Protein methylation====
Protein methylation typically takes place on arginine or lysine amino acid residues in the protein sequence. Arginine can be methylated once (monomethylated arginine) or twice, with either both methyl groups on one terminal nitrogen (asymmetric dimethylarginine) or one on both nitrogens (symmetric dimethylarginine), by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). Lysine can be methylated once, twice, or three times by lysine methyltransferases. Protein methylation has been most studied in the histones. The transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosyl methionine to histones is catalyzed by enzymes known as histone methyltransferases. Histones that are methylated on certain residues can act epigenetically to repress or activate gene expression. Protein methylation is one type of post-translational modification.

===Evolution===
Methyl metabolism is very ancient and can be found in all organisms on earth, from bacteria to humans, indicating the importance of methyl metabolism for physiology. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of global methylation in species ranging from human, mouse, fish, fly, roundworm, plant, algae, and cyanobacteria causes the same effects on their biological rhythms, demonstrating conserved physiological roles of methylation during evolution.

==In chemistry==
The term methylation in organic chemistry refers to the alkylation process used to describe the delivery of a group.

===Electrophilic methylation===
Methylations are commonly performed using &quot;electrophilic&quot; methyl sources such as iodomethane, dimethyl sulfate, dimethyl carbonate, or tetramethylammonium chloride. Less common but more powerful (and more dangerous) methylating reagents include methyl triflate, diazomethane, and methyl fluorosulfonate (magic methyl). These reagents all react via SN2 nucleophilic substitutions. For example, a carboxylate may be methylated on oxygen to give a methyl ester; an alkoxide salt may be likewise methylated to give an ether, ; or a ketone enolate may be methylated on carbon to produce a new ketone.

The Purdie methylation is a specific for the methylation at oxygen of carbohydrates using iodomethane and silver oxide.

===Eschweiler–Clarke methylation===
The Eschweiler–Clarke reaction is a method for methylation of amines. This method avoids the risk of quaternization, which occurs when amines are methylated with methyl halides.
===Diazomethane and trimethylsilyldiazomethane===
Diazomethane and the safer analogue trimethylsilyldiazomethane methylate carboxylic acids, phenols, and even alcohols:
:&lt;chem&gt;RCO2H + tmsCHN2 + CH3OH -&gt; RCO2CH3 + CH3Otms + N2&lt;/chem&gt;
The method offers the advantage that the side products are easily removed from the product mixture.

===Nucleophilic methylation===
Methylation sometimes involve use of &quot;nucleophilic&quot; methyl reagents. Strongly nucleophilic methylating agents include methyllithium () or Grignard reagents such as methylmagnesium bromide (). For example, will add methyl groups to the carbonyl (C=O) of ketones and aldehyde.:

Milder methylating agents include tetramethyltin, dimethylzinc, and trimethylaluminium.

<text>Acetaldehyde (IUPAC systematic name ethanal) is an organic chemical compound with the formula , sometimes abbreviated as . It is a colorless liquid or gas, boiling near room temperature. It is one of the most important aldehydes, occurring widely in nature and being produced on a large scale in industry. Acetaldehyde occurs naturally in coffee, bread, and ripe fruit, and is produced by plants. It is also produced by the partial oxidation of ethanol by the liver enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and is a contributing cause of hangover after alcohol consumption. Pathways of exposure include air, water, land, or groundwater, as well as drink and smoke. Consumption of disulfiram inhibits acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of acetaldehyde, thereby causing it to build up in the body.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has listed acetaldehyde as a Group 1 carcinogen. Acetaldehyde is &quot;one of the most frequently found air toxins with cancer risk greater than one in a million&quot;.

==History==
Acetaldehyde was first observed by the Swedish pharmacist/chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele (1774); it was then investigated by the French chemists Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin (1800), and the German chemists Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner (1821, 1822, 1832) and Justus von Liebig (1835).

In 1835, Liebig named it &quot;aldehyde&quot;, and in the middle of the century the name was altered to &quot;acetaldehyde&quot;.

==Production==
In 2013, global production was about 438 thousand tons. Before 1962, ethanol and acetylene were the major sources of acetaldehyde. Since then, ethylene is the dominant feedstock.

The main method of production is the oxidation of ethene by the Wacker process, which involves oxidation of ethene using a homogeneous palladium/copper catalyst system:

In the 1970s, the world capacity of the Wacker-Hoechst direct oxidation process exceeded 2 million tonnes annually.

Smaller quantities can be prepared by the partial oxidation of ethanol in an exothermic reaction. This process typically is conducted over a silver catalyst at about .
This method is one of the oldest routes for the industrial preparation of acetaldehyde.

===Other methods===
====Hydration of acetylene====
Prior to the Wacker process and the availability of cheap ethylene, acetaldehyde was produced by the hydration of acetylene. This reaction is catalyzed by mercury(II) salts:
The mechanism involves the intermediacy of vinyl alcohol, which tautomerizes to acetaldehyde. The reaction is conducted at , and the acetaldehyde formed is separated from water and mercury and cooled to . In the wet oxidation process, iron(III) sulfate is used to reoxidize the mercury back to the mercury(II) salt. The resulting iron(II) sulfate is oxidized in a separate reactor with nitric acid.

The enzyme Acetylene hydratase discovered in the strictly anaerobic bacterium Pelobacter acetylenicus can catalyze an analogous reaction without involving any compounds of mercury. However, it has thus far not been brought to any large-scale or commercial use.

====Dehydrogenation of ethanol====
Traditionally, acetaldehyde was produced by the partial dehydrogenation of ethanol:
In this endothermic process, ethanol vapor is passed at 260–290 °C over a copper-based catalyst. The process was once attractive because of the value of the hydrogen coproduct, but in modern times is not economically viable.

====Hydroformylation of methanol====
The hydroformylation of methanol with catalysts like cobalt, nickel, or iron salts also produces acetaldehyde, although this process is of no industrial importance. Similarly noncompetitive, acetaldehyde arises from synthesis gas with modest selectivity.

==Reactions==
===Tautomerization to vinyl alcohol===
Like many other carbonyl compounds, acetaldehyde tautomerizes to give an enol (vinyl alcohol; IUPAC name: ethenol):

: ∆&quot;H&quot;298,g = +42.7 kJ/mol

The equilibrium constant is 6 at room temperature, thus that the relative amount of the enol form in a sample of acetaldehyde is very small. At room temperature, acetaldehyde () is more stable than vinyl alcohol () by 42.7 kJ/mol: Overall the keto-enol tautomerization occurs slowly but is catalyzed by acids.

Photo-induced keto-enol tautomerization is viable under atmospheric or stratospheric conditions. This photo-tautomerization is relevant to the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, because vinyl alcohol is thought to be a precursor to carboxylic acids in the atmosphere.

===Addition and condensation reactions===
Acetaldehyde is a common electrophile in organic synthesis. In addition reactions acetaldehyde is prochiral. It is used primarily as a source of the &quot;&quot; synthon in aldol reactions and related condensation reactions. Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds react with MeCHO to give hydroxyethyl derivatives. In one of the more spectacular addition reactions, formaldehyde in the presence of calcium hydroxide adds to MeCHO to give pentaerythritol, and formate.

In a Strecker reaction, acetaldehyde condenses with cyanide and ammonia to give, after hydrolysis, the amino acid alanine. Acetaldehyde can condense with amines to yield imines; for example, with cyclohexylamine to give &quot;N&quot;-ethylidenecyclohexylamine. These imines can be used to direct subsequent reactions like an aldol condensation.

It is also a building block in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds. In one example, it converts, upon treatment with ammonia, to 5-ethyl-2-methylpyridine (&quot;aldehyde-collidine&quot;).

===Polymeric forms===

Three molecules of acetaldehyde condense to form &quot;paraldehyde&quot;, a cyclic trimer containing C-O single bonds. Similarly condensation of four molecules of acetaldehyde give the cyclic molecule metaldehyde. Paraldehyde can be produced in good yields, using a sulfuric acid catalyst. Metaldehyde is only obtained in a few percent yield and with cooling, often using HBr rather than as the catalyst. At in the presence of acid catalysts, polyacetaldehyde is produced. There are two stereomers of paraldehyde and four of metaldehyde.

The German chemist Valentin Hermann Weidenbusch (1821–1893) synthesized paraldehyde in 1848 by treating acetaldehyde with acid (either sulfuric or nitric acid) and cooling to . He found it quite remarkable that when paraldehyde was &quot;heated&quot; with a trace of the same acid, the reaction went the other way, recreating acetaldehyde.

Although vinyl alcohol is a polymeric form of acetaldehyde (), polyvinyl alcohol cannot be produced from acetaldehyde.

===Acetal derivatives===
Acetaldehyde forms a stable acetal upon reaction with ethanol under conditions that favor dehydration. The product, , is formally named 1,1-diethoxyethane but is commonly referred to as &quot;acetal&quot;. This can cause confusion as &quot;acetal&quot; is more commonly used to describe compounds with the functional groups RCH(OR&#x27;)2 or RR&#x27;C(OR&quot;)2 rather than referring to this specific compound — in fact, 1,1-diethoxyethane is also described as the diethyl acetal of acetaldehyde.

===Precursor to vinylphosphonic acid===
Acetaldehyde is a precursor to vinylphosphonic acid, which is used to make adhesives and ion conductive membranes. The synthesis sequence begins with a reaction with phosphorus trichloride:
# 

==Biochemistry==
In the liver, the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase oxidizes ethanol into acetaldehyde, which is then further oxidized into harmless acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. These two oxidation reactions are coupled with the reduction of to NADH. In the brain, the enzyme catalase is primarily responsible for oxidizing ethanol to acetaldehyde, and alcohol dehydrogenase plays a minor role. The last steps of alcoholic fermentation in bacteria, plants, and yeast involve the conversion of pyruvate into acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide by the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase, followed by the conversion of acetaldehyde into ethanol. The latter reaction is again catalyzed by an alcohol dehydrogenase, now operating in the opposite direction.

Many East Asian people have an ALDH2 mutation which makes them significantly less efficient at oxidizing acetaldehyde. On consuming alcohol, their bodies tend to accumulate excessive amounts of acetaldehyde, causing the so-called alcohol flush reaction. They develop a characteristic flush on the face and body, along with &quot;nausea, headache and general physical discomfort&quot;. Ingestion of the drug disulfiram, which inhibits ALDH2, leads to a similar reaction .

==Uses==
Traditionally, acetaldehyde was mainly used as a precursor to acetic acid. This application has declined because acetic acid is produced more efficiently from methanol by the Monsanto and Cativa processes. Acetaldehyde is an important precursor to pyridine derivatives, pentaerythritol, and crotonaldehyde. Urea and acetaldehyde combine to give a useful resin. Acetic anhydride reacts with acetaldehyde to give ethylidene diacetate, a precursor to vinyl acetate, which is used to produce polyvinyl acetate.

The global market for acetaldehyde is declining. Demand has been impacted by changes in the production of plasticizer alcohols, which has shifted because &quot;n&quot;-butyraldehyde is less often produced from acetaldehyde, instead being generated by hydroformylation of propylene. Likewise, acetic acid, once produced from acetaldehyde, is made predominantly by the lower-cost methanol carbonylation process. The impact on demand has led to increase in prices and thus slowdown in the market.

China is the largest consumer of acetaldehyde in the world, accounting for almost half of global consumption in 2012. Major use has been the production of acetic acid. Other uses such as pyridines and pentaerythritol are expected to grow faster than acetic acid, but the volumes are not large enough to offset the decline in acetic acid. As a consequence, overall acetaldehyde consumption in China may grow slightly at 1.6% per year through 2018. Western Europe is the second-largest consumer of acetaldehyde worldwide, accounting for 20% of world consumption in 2012. As with China, the Western European acetaldehyde market is expected to increase only very slightly at 1% per year during 2012–2018. However, Japan could emerge as a potential consumer for acetaldehyde in the next five years due to newfound use in commercial production of butadiene. The supply of butadiene has been volatile in Japan and the rest of Asia. This should provide the much needed boost to the flat market, as of 2013.

==Safety==
===Exposure limits===
The threshold limit value is 25ppm (STEL/ceiling value) and the MAK (Maximum Workplace Concentration) is 50 ppm. At 50 ppm acetaldehyde, no irritation or local tissue damage in the nasal mucosa is observed. When taken up by the organism, acetaldehyde is metabolized rapidly in the liver to acetic acid. Only a small proportion is exhaled unchanged. After intravenous injection, the half-life in the blood is approximately 90 seconds.

===Dangers===
====Toxicity====
Many serious cases of acute intoxication have been recorded. Acetaldehyde naturally breaks down in the human body.

====Irritation====
Acetaldehyde is an irritant of the skin, eyes, mucous membranes, throat, and respiratory tract. This occurs at concentrations as low as 1000 ppm. Symptoms of exposure to this compound include nausea, vomiting, and headache. These symptoms may not happen immediately. The perception threshold for acetaldehyde in air is in the range between 0.07 and 0.25 ppm. At such concentrations, the fruity odor of acetaldehyde is apparent. Conjunctival irritations have been observed after a 15-minute exposure to concentrations of 25 and 50 ppm, but transient conjunctivitis and irritation of the respiratory tract have been reported after exposure to 200 ppm acetaldehyde for 15 minutes.

====Carcinogenicity====
Acetaldehyde is carcinogenic in humans. In 1988 the International Agency for Research on Cancer stated, &quot;There is &quot;sufficient&quot; evidence for the carcinogenicity of acetaldehyde (the major metabolite of ethanol) in experimental animals.&quot; In October 2009 the International Agency for Research on Cancer updated the classification of acetaldehyde stating that acetaldehyde included in and generated endogenously from alcoholic beverages is a Group I human carcinogen. In addition, acetaldehyde is damaging to DNA and causes abnormal muscle development as it binds to proteins.

====DNA crosslinks====
Acetaldehyde induces DNA interstrand crosslinks, a form of DNA damage. These can be repaired by either of two replication-coupled DNA repair pathways. The first is referred to as the FA pathway, because it employs gene products defective in Fanconi&#x27;s anemia patients. This repair pathway results in increased mutation frequency and altered mutational spectrum. The second repair pathway requires replication fork convergence, breakage of the acetaldehyde crosslink, translesion synthesis by a Y-family DNA polymerase and homologous recombination.

===Aggravating factors===
====Alzheimer&#x27;s disease====
People with a genetic deficiency for the enzyme responsible for the conversion of acetaldehyde into acetic acid may have a greater risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. &quot;These results indicate that the ALDH2 deficiency is a risk factor for LOAD [late-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease] ...&quot;

====Genetic conditions====
A study of 818 heavy drinkers found that those exposed to more acetaldehyde than normal through a genetic variant of the gene encoding for ADH1C, ADH1C*1, are at greater risk of developing cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract and liver.

====Disulfiram====
The drug disulfiram (Antabuse) inhibits acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme that oxidizes the compound into acetic acid. Metabolism of ethanol forms acetaldehyde before acetaldehyde dehydrogenase forms acetic acid, but with the enzyme inhibited, acetaldehyde accumulates. If one consumes ethanol while taking disulfiram, the hangover effect of ethanol is felt more rapidly and intensely (disulfiram-alcohol reaction). As such, disulfiram is sometimes used as a deterrent for alcoholics wishing to stay sober.

===Sources of exposure===
====Indoor air====
Acetaldehyde is a potential contaminant in workplace, indoors, and ambient environments. Moreover, the majority of humans spend more than 90% of their time in indoor environments, increasing any exposure and the risk to human health.

In a study in France, the mean indoor concentration of acetaldehydes measured in 16 homes was approximately seven times higher than the outside acetaldehyde concentration. The living room had a mean of 18.1±17.5 μg m−3 and the bedroom was 18.2±16.9 μg m−3, whereas the outdoor air had a mean concentration of 2.3±2.6 μg m−3.

It has been concluded that volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, toluene, and xylenes have to be considered priority pollutants with respect to their health effects. It has been pointed that in renovated or completely new buildings, the VOCs concentration levels are often several orders of magnitude higher. The main sources of acetaldehydes in homes include building materials, laminate, PVC flooring, varnished wood flooring, and varnished cork/pine flooring (found in the varnish, not the wood). It is also found in plastics, oil-based and water-based paints, in composite wood ceilings, particle-board, plywood, treated pine wood, and laminated chipboard furniture.

====Outdoor air====
The use of acetaldehyde is widespread in different industries, and it may be released into waste water or the air during production, use, transportation and storage. Sources of acetaldehyde include fuel combustion emissions from stationary internal combustion engines and power plants that burn fossil fuels, wood, or trash, oil and gas extraction, refineries, cement kilns, lumber and wood mills and paper mills. Acetaldehyde is also present in automobile and diesel exhaust. As a result, acetaldehyde is &quot;one of the most frequently found air toxics with cancer risk greater than one in a million&quot;.

====Tobacco smoke====
Natural tobacco polysaccharides, including cellulose, have been shown to be the primary precursors making acetaldehyde a significant constituent of tobacco smoke. It has been demonstrated to have a synergistic effect with nicotine in rodent studies of addiction. Acetaldehyde is also the most abundant carcinogen in tobacco smoke; it is dissolved into the saliva while smoking.

====Cannabis smoke====
Acetaldehyde has been found in cannabis smoke. This finding emerged through the use of new chemical techniques that demonstrated the acetaldehyde present was causing DNA damage in laboratory settings.

====Alcohol consumption====
Many microbes produce acetaldehyde from ethanol, but they have a lower capacity to eliminate the acetaldehyde, which can lead to the accumulation of acetaldehyde in saliva, stomach acid, and intestinal contents. Fermented food and many alcoholic beverages can also contain significant amounts of acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde, derived from mucosal or microbial oxidation of ethanol, tobacco smoke, and diet, appears to act as a cumulative carcinogen in the upper digestive tract of humans. According to European Commission&#x27;s Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety&#x27;s (SCCS) &quot;Opinion on Acetaldehyde&quot; (2012) the cosmetic products special risk limit is 5 mg/L and acetaldehyde should not be used in mouth-washing products.

====Plastics====
Acetaldehyde can be produced by the photo-oxidation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), via a Type II Norrish reaction.

Although the levels produced by this process are minute acetaldehyde has an exceedingly low taste/odor threshold of around 20–40 ppb and can cause an off-taste in bottled water. The level at which an average consumer could detect acetaldehyde is still considerably lower than any toxicity.

====Candida overgrowth====
Candida albicans in patients with potentially carcinogenic oral diseases has been shown to produce acetaldehyde in quantities sufficient to cause problems.

<text>Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) () are a group of dehydrogenase enzymes that occur in many organisms and facilitate the interconversion between alcohols and aldehydes or ketones with the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH. In humans and many other animals, they serve to break down alcohols that are otherwise toxic, and they also participate in the generation of useful aldehyde, ketone, or alcohol groups during the biosynthesis of various metabolites. In yeast, plants, and many bacteria, some alcohol dehydrogenases catalyze the opposite reaction as part of fermentation to ensure a constant supply of NAD+.

== Evolution ==
Genetic evidence from comparisons of multiple organisms showed that a glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase, identical to a class III alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH-3/ADH5), is presumed to be the ancestral enzyme for the entire ADH family. Early on in evolution, an effective method for eliminating both endogenous and exogenous formaldehyde was important and this capacity has conserved the ancestral ADH-3 through time. Gene duplication of ADH-3, followed by series of mutations, led to the evolution of other ADHs.

The ability to produce ethanol from sugar (which is the basis of how alcoholic beverages are made) is believed to have initially evolved in yeast. Though this feature is not adaptive from an energy point of view, by making alcohol in such high concentrations so that they would be toxic to other organisms, yeast cells could effectively eliminate their competition. Since rotting fruit can contain more than 4% of ethanol, animals eating the fruit needed a system to metabolize exogenous ethanol. This was thought to explain the conservation of ethanol active ADH in species other than yeast, though ADH-3 is now known to also have a major role in nitric oxide signaling.

In humans, sequencing of the ADH1B gene (responsible for production of an alcohol dehydrogenase polypeptide) shows several functional variants. In one, there is a SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) that leads to either a Histidine or an Arginine residue at position 47 in the mature polypeptide. In the Histidine variant, the enzyme is much more effective at the aforementioned conversion. The enzyme responsible for the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetate, however, remains unaffected, which leads to differential rates of substrate catalysis and causes a buildup of toxic acetaldehyde, causing cell damage. This provides some protection against excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence (alcoholism). Various haplotypes arising from this mutation are more concentrated in regions near Eastern China, a region also known for its low alcohol tolerance and dependence.

A study was conducted in order to find a correlation between allelic distribution and alcoholism, and the results suggest that the allelic distribution arose along with rice cultivation in the region between 12,000 and 6,000 years ago. In regions where rice was cultivated, rice was also fermented into ethanol. This led to speculation that increased alcohol availability led to alcoholism and abuse, resulting in lower reproductive fitness. Those with the variant allele have little tolerance for alcohol, thus lowering chance of dependence and abuse. The hypothesis posits that those individuals with the Histidine variant enzyme were sensitive enough to the effects of alcohol that differential reproductive success arose and the corresponding alleles were passed through the generations. Classical Darwinian evolution would act to select against the detrimental form of the enzyme (Arg variant) because of the lowered reproductive success of individuals carrying the allele. The result would be a higher frequency of the allele responsible for the His-variant enzyme in regions that had been under selective pressure the longest. The distribution and frequency of the His variant follows the spread of rice cultivation to inland regions of Asia, with higher frequencies of the His variant in regions that have cultivated rice the longest. The geographic distribution of the alleles seems to therefore be a result of natural selection against individuals with lower reproductive success, namely, those who carried the Arg variant allele and were more susceptible to alcoholism. However, the persistence of the Arg variant in other populations argues that the effect could not be strong.

== Discovery ==

The first-ever isolated alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was purified in 1937 from &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; (brewer&#x27;s yeast). Many aspects of the catalytic mechanism for the horse liver ADH enzyme were investigated by Hugo Theorell and coworkers. ADH was also one of the first oligomeric enzymes that had its amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structure determined.

In early 1960, the alcohol dehydrogenase (&quot;ADH&quot;) gene was discovered in fruit flies of the genus &quot;Drosophila melanogaster.&quot; Flies that are mutant for ADH cannot breakdown alcohols into aldehydes and ketones. While ethanol produced by decaying fruit is a natural food source and location for oviposit for &quot;Drosophila&quot; at low concentrations (&lt;4%), high concentrations of ethanol can induce oxidative stress and alcohol intoxication. &quot;Drosophila&#x27;s&quot; fitness is elevated by consuming the low concentration of ethanol. Initial exposure to ethanol causes hyperactivity, followed by incoordination and sedation. Further research has shown that the antioxidant alpha-ketoglutarate may be beneficial in reducing the oxidative stress produced by alcohol consumption. A 2016 study concluded that food supplementation with 10-mM alpha-ketoglutarate decreased &quot;Drosophila&quot; alcohol sensitivity over time. For the gene that codes for ADH, there are 194 known classic and insertion alleles. Two alleles that are commonly used for experimentation involving ethanol toxicity and response are ADHs (slow) and ADHF (fast). Numerous experiments have concluded that the two alleles account for the differences in enzymatic activity for each. &quot;In comparing Adh-F homozygotes (wild-type) and Adh- nulls (homozygous null), research has shown that Adh- nulls have a lower level of tolerance for ethanol, starting the process of intoxication earlier than its counter partner.&quot; Other experiments have also concluded that the Adh allele is haplosufficient. Haplosuffiency means that having one functioning allele will be adequate in producing the needed phenotypes for survival. That means that flies that were heterozygous for the Adh allele (one copy of the Adh null allele and one copy of the Adh Wild type allele) gave very similar phenotypical alcohol tolerance as the homozygous dominant flies (two copies of the wild type Adh allele). Regardless of genotype, &quot;Drosophila&quot; show a negative response to exposure to samples with an ethanol content above 5%, which render any tolerance inadequate, resulting in a lethal dosage and a mortality rate of around 70%. &quot;Drosophila&quot; show many of the same ethanol responses as humans do. Low doses of ethanol produce hyperactivity, moderate doses incoordination, and high doses sedation&quot;.

== Properties ==
The alcohol dehydrogenases comprise a group of several isozymes that catalyse the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively, and also can catalyse the reverse reaction. In mammals this is a redox (reduction/oxidation) reaction involving the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+).

== Mechanism of action in humans ==

=== Steps ===
# Binding of the coenzyme NAD+
# Binding of the alcohol substrate by coordination to zinc(II) ion
# Deprotonation of His-51
# Deprotonation of nicotinamide ribose
# Deprotonation of Thr-48
# Deprotonation of the alcohol
# Hydride transfer from the alkoxide ion to NAD+, leading to NADH and a zinc-bound aldehyde or ketone
# Release of aldehyde.

The mechanism in yeast and bacteria is the reverse of this reaction. These steps are supported through kinetic studies.

=== Involved subunits ===
The substrate is coordinated to the zinc and this enzyme has two zinc atoms per subunit. One is the active site, which is involved in catalysis. In the active site, the ligands are Cys-46, Cys-174, His-67, and one water molecule. The other subunit is involved with structure. In this mechanism, the hydride from the alcohol goes to NAD+. Crystal structures indicate that the His-51 deprotonates the nicotinamide ribose, which deprotonates Ser-48. Finally, Ser-48 deprotonates the alcohol, making it an aldehyde. From a mechanistic perspective, if the enzyme adds hydride to the re face of NAD+, the resulting hydrogen is incorporated into the pro-R position. Enzymes that add hydride to the re face are deemed Class A dehydrogenases.

== Active site ==

The active site of human ADH1 (PDB:1HSO) consists of a zinc atom, His-67, Cys-174, Cys-46, Thr-48, His-51, Ile-269, Val-292, Ala-317, and Phe-319. In the commonly studied horse liver isoform, Thr-48 is a Ser, and Leu-319 is a Phe. The zinc coordinates the substrate (alcohol). The zinc is coordinated by Cys-46, Cys-174, and His-67. Leu-319, Ala-317, His-51, Ile-269 and Val-292 stabilize NAD+ by forming hydrogen bonds. His-51 and Ile-269 form hydrogen bonds with the alcohols on nicotinamide ribose. Phe-319, Ala-317 and Val-292 form hydrogen bonds with the amide on NAD+.

== Structural zinc site ==

Mammalian alcohol dehydrogenases also have a structural zinc site. This Zn ion plays a structural role and is crucial for protein stability. The structures of the catalytic and structural zinc sites in horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH) as revealed in crystallographic structures, which has been studied computationally with quantum chemistry as well as with classical molecular dynamics methods. The structural zinc site is composed of four closely spaced cysteine ligands (Cys97, Cys100, Cys103, and Cys111 in the amino acid sequence) positioned in an almost symmetric tetrahedron around the Zn ion. A recent study showed that the interaction between zinc and cysteine is governed by primarily an electrostatic contribution with an additional covalent contribution to the binding.

== Types ==

=== Human ===
In humans, ADH exists in multiple forms as a dimer and is encoded by at least seven genes. Among the five classes (I-V) of alcohol dehydrogenase, the hepatic forms that are used primarily in humans are class 1. Class 1 consists of α, β, and γ subunits that are encoded by the genes ADH1A, ADH1B, and ADH1C. The enzyme is present at high levels in the liver and the lining of the stomach. It catalyzes the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde (ethanal):

:CH3CH2OH + NAD+ → CH3CHO + NADH + H+

This allows the consumption of alcoholic beverages, but its evolutionary purpose is probably the breakdown of alcohols naturally contained in foods or produced by bacteria in the digestive tract.

Another evolutionary purpose is reversible metabolism of retinol (vitamin A), an alcohol, to retinaldehyde, also known as retinal, which is then irreversibly converted into retinoic acid, which regulates expression of hundreds of genes.

Alcohol dehydrogenase is also involved in the toxicity of other types of alcohol: For instance, it oxidizes methanol to produce formaldehyde and ultimately formic acid. Humans have at least six slightly different alcohol dehydrogenases. Each is a dimer (i.e., consists of two polypeptides), with each dimer containing two zinc ions Zn2+. One of those ions is crucial for the operation of the enzyme: It is located at the catalytic site and holds the hydroxyl group of the alcohol in place. 

Alcohol dehydrogenase activity varies between men and women, between young and old, and among populations from different areas of the world. For example, young women are unable to process alcohol at the same rate as young men because they do not express the alcohol dehydrogenase as highly, although the inverse is true among the middle-aged. The level of activity may not be dependent only on level of expression but also on allelic diversity among the population.

The human genes that encode class II, III, IV, and V alcohol dehydrogenases are ADH4, ADH5, ADH7, and ADH6, respectively.

=== Yeast and bacteria ===
Unlike humans, yeast and bacteria (except lactic acid bacteria, and &quot;E. coli&quot; in certain conditions) do not ferment glucose to lactate. Instead, they ferment it to ethanol and . The overall reaction can be seen below:

: Glucose + 2 ADP + 2 Pi → 2 ethanol + 2 CO2 + 2 ATP + 2 H2O
In yeast and many bacteria, alcohol dehydrogenase plays an important part in fermentation: Pyruvate resulting from glycolysis is converted to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide, and the acetaldehyde is then reduced to ethanol by an alcohol dehydrogenase called ADH1. The purpose of this latter step is the regeneration of NAD+, so that the energy-generating glycolysis can continue. Humans exploit this process to produce alcoholic beverages, by letting yeast ferment various fruits or grains. Yeast can produce and consume their own alcohol.

The main alcohol dehydrogenase in yeast is larger than the human one, consisting of four rather than just two subunits. It also contains zinc at its catalytic site. Together with the zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenases of animals and humans, these enzymes from yeasts and many bacteria form the family of &quot;long-chain&quot;-alcohol dehydrogenases.

Brewer&#x27;s yeast also has another alcohol dehydrogenase, ADH2, which evolved out of a duplicate version of the chromosome containing the ADH1 gene. ADH2 is used by the yeast to convert ethanol back into acetaldehyde, and it is expressed only when sugar concentration is low. Having these two enzymes allows yeast to produce alcohol when sugar is plentiful (and this alcohol then kills off competing microbes), and then continue with the oxidation of the alcohol once the sugar, and competition, is gone.

===Plants===
In plants, ADH catalyses the same reaction as in yeast and bacteria to ensure that there is a constant supply of NAD+. Maize has two versions of ADH – ADH1 and ADH2, &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; contains only one ADH gene. The structure of &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; ADH is 47%-conserved, relative to ADH from horse liver. Structurally and functionally important residues, such as the seven residues that provide ligands for the catalytic and noncatalytic zinc atoms, however, are conserved, suggesting that the enzymes have a similar structure. ADH is constitutively expressed at low levels in the roots of young plants grown on agar. If the roots lack oxygen, the expression of &quot;ADH&quot; increases significantly. Its expression is also increased in response to dehydration, to low temperatures, and to abscisic acid, and it plays an important role in fruit ripening, seedlings development, and pollen development. Differences in the sequences of &quot;ADH&quot; in different species have been used to create phylogenies showing how closely related different species of plants are. It is an ideal gene to use due to its convenient size (2–3 kb in length with a ≈1000 nucleotide coding sequence) and low copy number.

=== Iron-containing ===

A third family of alcohol dehydrogenases, unrelated to the above two, are iron-containing ones. They occur in bacteria and fungi. In comparison to enzymes the above families, these enzymes are oxygen-sensitive.
Members of the iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenase family include:
* &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; alcohol dehydrogenase 4 (gene ADH4)
* &quot;Zymomonas mobilis&quot; alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (gene adhB)
* &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; propanediol oxidoreductase (gene fucO), an enzyme involved in the metabolism of fucose and which also seems to contain ferrous ion(s).
* &quot;Clostridium acetobutylicum&quot; NADPH- and NADH-dependent butanol dehydrogenases (genes adh1, bdhA and bdhB), enzymes that have activity using butanol and ethanol as substrates.
* &quot;E. coli&quot; adhE, an iron-dependent enzyme that harbours three different activities: alcohol dehydrogenase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acetylating) and pyruvate-formate-lyase deactivase.
* Bacterial glycerol dehydrogenase (gene gldA or dhaD).
* &quot;Clostridium kluyveri&quot; NAD-dependent 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (4hbd) 
* &quot;Citrobacter freundii&quot; and &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase (gene dhaT)
* &quot;Bacillus methanolicus&quot; NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenase 
* &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;Salmonella typhimurium&quot; ethanolamine utilization protein eutG.
* &quot;E. coli&quot; hypothetical protein yiaY.

=== Other types ===
A further class of alcohol dehydrogenases belongs to quinoenzymes and requires quinoid cofactors (e.g., pyrroloquinoline quinone, PQQ) as enzyme-bound electron acceptors. A typical example for this type of enzyme is methanol dehydrogenase of methylotrophic bacteria.

== Applications ==

Alcohol dehydrogenases are often used for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure stereoisomers of chiral alcohols. Often, high chemo- and enantioselectivity can be achieved. One example is the alcohol dehydrogenase from &quot;Lactobacillus brevis&quot; (&quot;Lb&quot;ADH), which is described to be a versatile biocatalyst. The high chemospecificity has been confirmed also in the case of substrates presenting two potential redox sites. For instance cinnamaldehyde presents both aliphatic double bond and aldehyde function. Unlike conventional catalysts, alcohol dehydrogenases are able to selectively act only on the latter, yielding exclusively cinnamyl alcohol.

In fuel cells, alcohol dehydrogenases can be used to catalyze the breakdown of fuel for an ethanol fuel cell. Scientists at Saint Louis University have used carbon-supported alcohol dehydrogenase with poly(methylene green) as an anode, with a nafion membrane, to achieve about 50 μA/cm2.

In 1949, E. Racker defined one unit of alcohol dehydrogenase activity as the amount that causes a change in optical density of 0.001 per minute under the standard conditions of assay. Recently, the international definition of enzymatic unit (E.U.) has been more common: one unit of Alcohol Dehydrogenase will convert 1.0 μmole of ethanol to acetaldehyde per minute at pH 8.8 at 25 °C.

== Clinical significance ==

=== Alcoholism ===

There have been studies showing that variations in ADH that influence ethanol metabolism have an impact on the risk of alcohol dependence. The strongest effect is due to variations in ADH1B that increase the rate at which alcohol is converted to acetaldehyde. One such variant is most common in individuals from East Asia and the Middle East, another is most common in individuals from Africa. Both variants reduce the risk for alcoholism, but individuals can become alcoholic despite that. Researchers have tentatively detected a few other genes to be associated with alcoholism, and know that there must be many more remaining to be found. Research continues in order to identify the genes and their influence on alcoholism.

=== Drug dependence ===

Drug dependence is another problem associated with ADH, which researchers think might be linked to alcoholism. One particular study suggests that drug dependence has seven ADH genes associated with it, however, more research is necessary. Alcohol dependence and other drug dependence may share some risk factors, but because alcohol dependence is often comorbid with other drug dependences, the association of ADH with the other drug dependencies may not be causal.

=== Poisoning ===

Fomepizole, a drug that competitively inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase, can be used in the setting of acute methanol or ethylene glycol toxicity. This prevents the conversion of the methanol or ethylene glycol to its toxic metabolites (such as formic acid, formaldehyde, or glycolate). The same effect is also sometimes achieved with ethanol, again by competitive inhibition of ADH.

=== Drug metabolism ===
The drug hydroxyzine is broken into its active metabolite cetirizine by alcohol dehydrogenase. Other drugs with alcohol groups may be metabolized in a similar way as long as steric hindrance does not prevent the alcohol from reaching the active site.

<doc id="89202" wikidata="Q1064538" url="?curid=89202" title="Quilt">
<text>A quilt is a multi-layered textile, traditionally composed of two or more layers of fabric or fiber. Commonly three layers are used with a filler material. These layers traditionally include a woven cloth top, a layer of batting or wadding, and a woven back combined using the techniques of quilting. This is the process of sewing on the face of the fabric, and not just the edges, to combine the three layers together to reinforce the material. Stitching patterns can be a decorative element. A single piece of fabric can be used for the top of a quilt (a &quot;whole-cloth quilt&quot;), but in many cases the top is created from smaller fabric pieces joined, or patchwork. The pattern and color of these pieces creates the design. Quilts may contain valuable historical information about their creators, &quot;visualizing particular segments of history in tangible, textured ways&quot;.

In the twenty-first century, quilts are frequently displayed as non-utilitarian works of art but historically quilts were often used as bedcovers; and this use persists today.

(In modern English, the word &quot;quilt&quot; can also be used to refer to an unquilted duvet or comforter.)

==Uses==
There are many traditions regarding the uses of quilts. Quilts may be made or given to mark important life events such as marriage, the birth of a child, a family member leaving home, or graduations. Modern quilts are not always intended for use as bedding, and may be used as wall hangings, table runners, or tablecloths. Quilting techniques are often incorporated into garment design as well. Quilt shows and competitions are held locally, regionally, and nationally. There are international competitions as well, particularly in the United States, Japan, and Europe.

The following list summarizes most of the reasons a person might decide to make a quilt:

* Bedding
* Decoration
* Armor (e.g., the garment called a gambeson)
* Commemoration (e.g., the AIDS Memorial Quilt)
* Education (e.g., a &quot;Science&quot; quilt or a &quot;Gardening&quot; quilt)
* Campaigning
* Documenting events / social history, etc.
* Artistic expression (e.g., Quilt art)
* Gift
*Fundraiser

==Traditions==
Quilting traditions are particularly prominent in the United States, where the necessity of creating warm bedding met the paucity of local fabrics in the early days of the colonies. Imported fabric was very expensive, and local homespun fabric was labor-intensive to create and tended to wear out sooner than commercial fabric. It was essential for most families to use and preserve textiles efficiently. Saving or salvaging small scraps of fabric was a part of life for all households. Small pieces of fabric were joined to make larger pieces, in units called &quot;blocks&quot;. Creativity could be expressed in the block designs, or simple &quot;utility quilts&quot;, with minimal decorative value, could be produced. Crib quilts for infants were needed in the cold of winter, but even early examples of baby quilts indicate the efforts that women made to welcome a new baby.

Quilting bees were common communal activities involving all the women and girls in a family or in a larger community. There are also many historical examples of men participating in these quilting traditions. The tops were prepared in advance, and a quilting bee was arranged, during which the actual quilting was completed by multiple people. Quilting frames were often used to stretch the quilt layers and maintain even tension to produce high-quality quilting stitches and to allow many individual quilters to work on a single quilt at one time. Quilting bees were important social events in many communities, and were typically held between periods of high demand for farm labor. Quilts were frequently made to commemorate major life events, such as marriages.
Quilts were often made for other events as well, such as graduations, or when individuals left their homes for other communities. One example of this is the quilts made as farewell gifts for pastors; some of these gifts were subscription quilts. For a subscription quilt, community members would pay to have their names embroidered on the quilt top, and the proceeds would be given to the departing minister. Sometimes the quilts were auctioned off to raise additional money, and the quilt might be donated back to the minister by the winner. A logical extension of this tradition led to quilts being made to raise money for other community projects, such as recovery from a flood or natural disaster, and later, for fundraising for war. Subscription quilts were made for all of America&#x27;s wars. In a new tradition, quilt makers across the United States have been making quilts for wounded veterans of the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts.

There are many American traditions regarding the number of quilts a young woman (and her family) was expected to have made prior to her wedding for the establishment of her new home. Given the demands on a new wife, and the learning curve in her new role, it was prudent to provide her some reserve time with quilts already completed. Specific wedding quilts continue to be made today. Wedding ring quilts, which have a patchwork design of interlocking rings, have been made since the 1930s. White wholecloth quilts with high-quality, elaborate quilting, and often trapunto decorations as well, are also traditional for weddings. A superstition existed that it was bad luck to incorporate heart motifs in a wedding quilt (the couples’ hearts might be broken if such a design were included), so tulip motifs were often used to symbolize love in wedding quilts.

The Museum of the Southern Jewish Experience in New Orleans holds a 19th-century exemplar of a &quot;crazy quilt&quot; (one without a pattern) &quot;that was made by the Jewish Ladies’ Sewing Club of Canton, Miss., in 1885 to be raffled off to help fund the building of a synagogue there&quot;. (A photo of this quilt accompanies this citation.) The Museum&#x27;s director, Kenneth Hoffman, says that this quilt involves &quot;lots of little pieces that come together to make something greater than the sum of its parts, it’s crazy but it’s beautiful, it has a social aspect of ladies sitting together sewing, it has a religious aspect.&quot;

William Rush Dunton (1868–1966), psychiatrist, collector, and scholar of American quilts incorporated quilting as part of his occupational therapy treatment. &quot;Dr Dunton, the founder of the American Occupational Therapy Association, encouraged his patients to pursue quilting as a curative activity/therapeutic diversion...&quot;

The National Quilt Museum is in Paducah, Kentucky, in the Southern United States. It hosts QuiltWeek, an annual competition and celebration of that attracts artists and hobbyists from the world of quilting. QuiltWeek has been celebrated in a short documentary by Olivia Loomis Merrion called &quot;Quilt Fever&quot;. It explores what quilting means to its practitioners along with what it means to Paducah, which has earned the nickname &quot;Quilt City, USA&quot;. 

Among the many television programs as well as YouTube channels devoted to quilting, &quot;Love of Quilting&quot;, which originates in a magazine of the same name, stands out for being aired on PBS.

==Techniques==

=== Patchwork and piecing ===
One of the primary techniques involved in quilt making is patchwork, sewing together geometric pieces of fabric often to form a design or &quot;block&quot;. Also called piecing, this technique can be achieved with hand stitching or with a sewing machine.

===Appliqué===

Appliqué is a sewing technique where an upper layer of fabric is sewn onto a ground fabric. The upper, applied fabric shape can be of any shape or contour. There are several different appliqué techniques and styles. In needle-turn appliqué, the raw edges of the appliquéd fabric are tucked beneath the design to minimize raveling or damage, and small hand stitches are made to secure down the design. The stitches are made with a hem stitch, so that the thread securing the fabric is minimally visible from the front of the work. There are other methods to secure the raw edge of the appliquéd fabric, and some people use basting stitches, fabric-safe glue, freezer paper, paper forms, or starching techniques to prepare the fabric that will be applied, prior to sewing it on. Supporting paper or other materials are typically removed after the sewing is complete. The ground fabric is often cut away from behind, after the sewing is complete, to minimize the bulk of the fabric in that region. A special form of appliqué is Broderie perse, which involves the appliqué of specific motifs that have been selected from a printed fabric. For example, a series of flower designs might be cut out of one fabric with a vine design, rearranged, and sewn down on a new fabric to create the image of a rose bush.
===Reverse appliqué===
Reverse appliqué is a sewing technique where a ground fabric is cut, another piece of fabric is placed under the ground fabric, the raw edges of the ground fabric are tucked under, and the newly folded edge is sewn down to the lower fabric. Stitches are made as inconspicuous as possible. Reverse appliqué techniques are often used in combination with traditional appliqué techniques, to give a variety of visual effects.

=== Quilting ===
A key component that defines a quilt is the stitches holding the three layers together—the quilting. Quilting, typically a running stitch, can be achieved by hand or by sewing machine. Hand quilting has often been a communally productive act with quilters sitting around a large quilting frame. One can also hand quilt with a hoop or other method. With the development of the sewing machine, some quilters began to use the sewing machine, and in more recent decades machine quilting has become quite commonplace, including with longarm quilting machines.

===Trapunto===
Trapunto is a sewing technique where two layers of fabric surrounding a layer of batting are quilted together, and then additional material is added to a portion of the design to increase the profile of relief as compared to the rest of the work. The effect of the elevation of one portion is often heightened by closely quilting the surrounding region, to compress the batting layer in that part of the quilt, thus receding the background even further. Cording techniques may also be used, where a channel is created by quilting, and a cord or yarn is pulled through the batting layer, causing a sharp change in the texture of the quilt. For example, several pockets may be quilted in the pattern of a flower, and then extra batting pushed through a slit in the backing fabric (which will later be sewn shut). The stem of the rose might be corded, creating a dimensional effect. The background could be quilted densely in a stipple pattern, causing the space around the rose bush to become less prominent. These techniques are typically executed with wholecloth quilts, and with batting and thread that matches the top fabric. Some artists have used contrasting colored thread, to create an outline effect. Colored batting behind the surface layer can create a shadowed effect. Brightly colored yarn cording behind white cloth can give a pastel effect on the surface.

===Embellishment===
Additional decorative elements may be added to the surface of a quilt to create a three-dimensional or whimsical effect. The most common objects sewn on are beads or buttons. Decorative trim, piping, sequins, found objects, or other items can also be secured to the surface. The topic of embellishment is explored further on another page.

===English paper piecing===

English paper piecing is a hand-sewing technique used to maximize accuracy when piecing complex angles together. A paper shape is cut with the exact dimensions of the desired piece. Fabric is then basted to the paper shape. Adjacent units are then placed face to face, and the seam is whipstitched together. When a given piece is completely surrounded by all the adjacent shapes, the basting thread is cut, and the basting and the paper shape are removed.

===Foundation piecing===
Foundation piecing is a sewing technique that allows maximum stability of the work as the piecing is created, minimizing the distorting effect of working with slender pieces or bias-cut pieces. In the most basic form of foundation piecing, a piece of paper is cut to the size of the desired block. For utility quilts, a sheet of newspaper was used. In modern foundation piecing, there are many commercially available foundation papers. A strip of fabric or a fabric scrap is sewn by machine to the foundation. The fabric is flipped back and pressed. The next piece of fabric is sewn through the initial piece and its foundation paper. Subsequent pieces are added sequentially. The block may be trimmed flush with the border of the foundation. After the blocks are sewn together, the paper is removed, unless the foundation is an acid-free material that will not damage the quilt over time.

===Intarsia===
Rarer and less well-known are quilts made by men in a military setting. They are made of broadcloth which is cut into elements abutting each other as intarsia and then over-sewn. Front and back of the work are in principle identical and the quilts reversible, except in cases where elements of appliqué, embroidery or trapunto have been added on the front, which is quite common in more elaborate or illustrative pieces.

==Quilting styles==

===North America===

====Amish====

Amish quilts are reflections of the Amish way of life. As a part of their religious commitment, Amish people have chosen to reject &quot;worldly&quot; elements in their dress and lifestyle, and their quilts historically reflected this, although today Amish make and use quilts in a variety of styles. Traditionally, the Amish use only solid colors in their clothing and the quilts they intend for their own use, in community-sanctioned colors and styles. In Lancaster, Pennsylvania, early Amish quilts were typically made of solid-colored, lightweight wool fabric, off the same bolts of fabric used for family clothing items, while in many Midwestern communities, cotton predominated. Classic Amish quilts often feature quilting patterns that contrast with the plain background. Antique Amish quilts are among the most highly prized by collectors and quilting enthusiasts. The color combinations used in a quilt can help experts determine the community in which the quilt was produced. Since the 1970s, Amish quiltmakers have made quilts for the consumer market, with quilt cottage industries and retail shops appearing in Amish settlements across North America.

====Baltimore album====

Baltimore album quilts originated in the region around Baltimore, Maryland, in the 1840s, where a unique and highly developed style of appliqué quilting briefly flourished. Baltimore album quilts are variations on album quilts, which are collections of appliquéd blocks, each with a different design. These designs often feature floral patterns, but many other motifs are used as well. Baskets of flowers, wreaths, buildings, books, and birds are common motifs. Designs are often highly detailed, and display the quiltmaker&#x27;s skill. New dyeing techniques became available in this period, allowing the creation of new, bold colors, which the quilters used enthusiastically. New techniques for printing on the fabrics also allowed portions of fabric to be shaded, which heightens the three-dimensional effect of the designs. The background fabric is typically white or off-white, allowing maximal contrast to the delicate designs. India ink allowed handwritten accents and also allowed the blocks to be signed. Some of these quilts were created by professional quilters, and patrons could commission quilts made of new blocks, or select blocks that were already available for sale. There has been a resurgence of quilting in the Baltimore style, with many of the modern quilts experimenting with bending some of the old rules.
====Crazy quilts====

Crazy quilts are so named because their pieces are not regular, and they are scattered across the top of the quilt like &quot;crazed&quot; (cracked or crackled) pottery glazing. They were originally very refined, luxury items. Geometric pieces of rich fabrics were sewn together, and highly decorative embroidery was added. Such quilts were often effectively samplers of embroidery stitches and techniques, displaying the development of needle skills of those in the well-to-do late 19th-century home. They were show pieces, not used for warmth, but for display. The luxury fabrics used precluded frequent washing. They often took years to complete. Fabrics used included silks, wools, velvet, linen, and cotton. The mixture of fabric textures, such as a smooth silk next to a textured brocade or velvet, was embraced. Designs were applied to the surface, and other elements such as ribbons, lace, and decorative cording were used exuberantly. Names and dates were often part of the design, added to commemorate important events or associations of the maker. Politics were included in some, with printed campaign handkerchiefs and other preprinted textiles (such as advertising silks) included to declare the maker&#x27;s sentiments.

====African-American====
By the time that early African-American quilting became a tradition in and of itself, it was already a combination of textile traditions from four civilizations of Central and West Africa: the Mande-speaking peoples, the Yoruba and Fon peoples, the Ejagham peoples, and the Kongo peoples. As textiles were traded heavily throughout the Caribbean, Central America, and the Southern United States, the traditions of each distinct region became intermixed. Originally, most of the textiles were made by men. Yet when enslaved Africans were brought to the United States, their work was divided according to traditional Western gender roles and women took over the tradition. However, this strong tradition of weaving left a visible mark on African-American quilting. The use of strips, reminiscent of the strips of reed and fabric used in men&#x27;s traditional weaving, are used in fabric quilting. A break in a pattern symbolized a rebirth in the ancestral power of the creator or wearer. It also helped keep evil spirits away; evil is believed to travel in straight lines and a break in a pattern or line confuses the spirits and slows them down. This tradition is highly recognizable in African-American improvisations on European-American patterns. The traditions of improvisation and multiple patterning also protect the quilter from anyone copying their quilts. These traditions allow for a strong sense of ownership and creativity.
In the 1980s, concurrent with the boom in art quilting in America, new attention was brought to African-American traditions and innovations. This attention came from two opposing points of view, one validating the practices of rural Southern African-American quilters and another asserting that there was no one style but rather the same individualization found among white quilters. John Vlach, in a 1976 exhibition, and Maude Wahlman, co-organizing a 1979 exhibition, both cited the use of strips, high-contrast colors, large design elements, and multiple patterns as characteristic and compared them to rhythms in black music. Building on the relationship between quilting and musical performance, African-American quilter Gwendolyn Ann Magee created a twelve-piece exhibition based on the lyrics of James Weldon Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;Negro National Anthem&quot;. Cuesta Benberry, a quilt historian with a special interest in African-American works, published &quot;Always There: The African-American Presence in American Quilts&quot; in 1992 and organized an exhibition documenting the contributions of black quilters to mainstream American quilting. Eli Leon, a collector of African-American quilts, organized a traveling exhibition in 1987 that introduced both historic and current quilters, some loosely following patterns and others improvising, such as Rosie Lee Tompkins. He argued for the creativity of the irregular quilt, saying that these quilters saw the quilt block as &quot;an invitation to variation&quot; and felt that measuring &quot;takes the heart outa things&quot;. At the same time, the Williams College Museum of Art was circulating &quot;Stitching Memories: African-American Story Quilts&quot;, an exhibition featuring a different approach to quilts, including most prominently the quilts of Faith Ringgold. However, it was not until 2002, when the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, organized &quot;The Quilts of Gee&#x27;s Bend&quot;, an exhibition that appeared in major museums around the country, including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, that art critics unknowingly adopted Leon&#x27;s assertions.

====Story quilts====
Story quilts have much in common with pictorial quilts and the tradition of African-American quiltmakers and are often made as a form of quilt art. Usually adorned with extensive text and accompanying imagery, story quilts can contain short stories, poems, or extended essays and can be used as an alternative form of a picture book. Artist Faith Ringgold, known for her large portfolio of story quilts, has said she began making these narrative quilts with extensive text after being unable to find a publisher that would accept her autobiography. She began quilting so that &quot;when my quilts were hung up to look at, or photographed for a book, people could still read my stories&quot;.

====Pictorial quilts====
Pictorial quilts often contain one-of-a-kind patterns and imagery. Instead of bringing together fabric in an abstract or patterned design, they use pieces of fabric to create objects on the quilt, resulting in a picture-based quilt. They were often made collaboratively as a fundraising effort. However, some pictorial quilts were individually created and tell a narrative through the images on the quilt. Some pictorial quilts consist of many squares, sometimes made by multiple people, while others have imagery that uses the entirety of quilt. Pictorial quilts were created in the United States, as well as in England and Ireland, beginning as early as 1795.
==== Barn quilts ====
Barn quilts are a type of folk art found in the United States (particularly the South and Midwest) and Canada. They take the patterns of traditional quilt squares, and recreate them either directly on the side of a barn or on a piece of wood or aluminum which is then attached to the side of a barn. Patterns are sometimes modeled off of family quilts, loved ones, patriotic themes, or important crops to the farm. The origins of the barn quilt are contested- some claim they date back almost 300 years, but some claim they were invented by Donna Sue Groves of Adams County, Ohio in 2001. Their origin is likely connected to barn advertisements. Many rural counties will display their barn quilts as part of a quilt trail, creating a route that connects barns with barn quilts to sponsor local tourism.

====Hawaiian====

Hawaiian quilts are wholecloth (not pieced) quilts, featuring large-scale symmetrical appliqué in solid colors on a solid color (usually white) background fabric. Traditionally, the quilter would fold a square piece of fabric into quarters or eighths and then cut out a border design, followed by a center design. The cutouts would then be appliquéd onto a contrasting background fabric. The center and border designs were typically inspired by local flora and often had rich personal associations for the creator, with deep cultural resonances. The most common color for the appliquéd design was red, due to the wide availability of Turkey-red fabric. Some of these textiles were not in fact quilted but were used as decorative coverings without the heavier batting, which was not needed in a tropical climate. Multiple colors were added over time as the tradition developed. Echo quilting, where a quilted outline of the appliqué pattern is repeated like ripples out to the edge of the quilt, is the most common quilting pattern employed on Hawaiian-style quilts. Beautiful examples are held in the collection of the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, Honolulu, Hawaii.
====Native American star quilts====
Star Quilts are a Native-American form of quilting that arose among native women in the late 19th century as communities adjusted to the difficulties of reservation life and cultural disruption. They are made by many tribes, but came to be especially associated with Plains tribes, including the Lakota. While star patterns existed in earlier European-American forms of quilting, they came to take on special significance for many native artisans. Star quilts are more than an art form—they express important cultural and spiritual values of the native women who make them and continue to be used in ceremonies and to mark important points in a person&#x27;s life, including curing or yuwipi ceremonies and memorials. Anthropologists (such as Bea Medicine) have documented important social and cultural connections between quilting and earlier important pre-reservation crafting traditions, such as women&#x27;s quill-working societies and other crafts that were difficult to sustain after hunting and off-reservation travel was restricted by the US government. Star quilts have also become a source of income for many Native-American women, while retaining spiritual and cultural importance to their makers.

====Seminole patchwork====
Created by the Native Americans of southern Florida, Seminole strip piecing is based on a simple form of decorative patchwork. Seminole strip piecing has uses in quilts, wall hangings, and traditional clothing. Seminole patchwork is created by joining a series of horizontal strips to produce repetitive geometric designs.

===Europe===
The history of quilting in Europe goes back at least to Medieval times. Quilting was used not only for traditional bedding but also for warm clothing. Clothing quilted with fancy fabrics and threads was often a sign of nobility.

====British quilts====
Henry VIII of England&#x27;s household inventories record dozens of &quot;quyltes&quot; and &quot;coverpointes&quot; among the bed linen, including a green silk one for his first wedding to Catherine of Aragon, quilted with metal threads, linen-backed, and worked with roses and pomegranates.

An embroidered yellow silk quilt from Bengal dating from the 1620s, an early example of such fabric use in Britain, now held by the Colonial Williamsburg museum, has an ownership label of Catherine Colepeper, connecting it to Leeds Castle and the Smythe and Colepeper families. Thomas Smythe, a brother of the owner of Leeds Castle, was a founder and governor of the English East India Company.

Otherwise known as Durham quilts, North Country quilts have a long history in northeastern England, dating back to the Industrial Revolution and beyond. North Country quilts are often wholecloth quilts, featuring dense quilting. Some are made of sateen fabrics, which further heightens the effect of the quilting.

From the late 18th to the early 20th century, the Lancashire cotton industry produced quilts using a mechanized technique of weaving double cloth with an enclosed heavy cording weft, imitating the corded Provençal quilts made in Marseille.

====Italian quilts====
Quilting was particularly common in Italy during the Renaissance. One particularly famous surviving example, now in two parts, is the 1360–1400 Tristan Quilt, a Sicilian-quilted linen textile representing scenes from the story of &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot; and housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum and in the Bargello in Florence.

====Provençal quilts====
Provençal quilts, now often referred to as &quot;boutis&quot; (the Provençal word meaning &quot;stuffing&quot;), are wholecloth quilts traditionally made in the South of France since the 17th century. Two layers of fabric are quilted together with stuffing sandwiched between sections of the design, creating a raised effect. The three main forms of the Provençal quilt are &quot;matelassage&quot; (a double-layered wholecloth quilt with batting sandwiched between), corded quilting or &quot;piqûre de Marseille&quot; (also known as Marseille work or &quot;piqué marseillais&quot;), and &quot;boutis&quot;. These terms are often debated and confused, but are all forms of stuffed quilting associated with the region.

===Asia===

====China====

Throughout China, a simple method of producing quilts is employed. It involves setting up a temporary site. At the site, a frame is assembled within which a lattice work of cotton thread is made. Cotton batting, either new or retrieved from discarded quilts, is prepared in a mobile carding machine. The mechanism of the carding machine is powered by a small, petrol motor. The batting is then added, layer by layer, to the area within the frame. Between adjacent layers, a new lattice of thread is created with a wooden disk used to tamp down the layer. (See: Image series showing production method)

====Japan: Sashiko====
Sashiko (刺し子, literally &quot;little stabs&quot;) is a Japanese tradition that evolved over time from a simple technique for reinforcing fabric made for heavy use in fishing villages. It is a form of decorative stitching, with no overlap of any two stitches. Piecing is not part of the tradition; instead, the focus is on heavy cotton thread work with large, even stitches on the base fabric. Deep blue indigo-dyed fabric with white stitches is the most traditional form, but inverse work with blue on white is also seen. Traditional medallion, tessellated, and geometric designs are the most common.

====Bangladeshi quilts====
Bangladeshi quilts, known as Kantha, are not pieced together. Rather, they consist of two to three pieces of cloth sewn together with decorative embroidery stitches. They are made out of worn-out clothes (saris) and are mainly used for bedding, although they may be used as a decorative piece as well. They are made by women mainly in the Monsoon season before winter.

====India: Kantha, Ralli, and Balaposh — the unquilted scented quilt====

Women in the Indus Region of the Indian subcontinent make beautiful quilts with bright colors and bold patterns. The quilts are called &quot;Ralli&quot; (or rilli, rilly, rallee, or rehli) derived from the local word &quot;ralanna&quot; meaning to mix or connect. Rallis are made in the southern provinces of Pakistan including Sindh, Baluchistan, and in the Cholistan Desert on the southern border of Punjab, as well as in the adjoining states of Gujarat and Rajasthan in India. In India Kantha originated from the Sanskrit word &quot;kontha&quot;, which means rags, as the blankets are made out of rags using different scrap pieces of cloth. Nakshi kantha consisting of a running (embroidery) stitch, similar to the Japanese Sashiko is used for decorating and reinforcing the cloth and sewing patterns. Katab work called in Kutch. It is popularly known as Koudhi in Karnataka. Such blankets are given as gifts to newborn babies in many parts of India. Lambani tribes wear skirts with such art. Muslim and Hindu women from a variety of tribes and castes in towns, villages, and also nomadic settings make rallis. Quiltmaking is an old tradition in the region perhaps dating back to the fourth millennium BC, judging by similar patterns found on ancient pottery. Jaipuri razai (quilt) is one of the most famous things in Jaipur because of the traditional art and process of making it. Jaipuri razai is printed by the process of Screen printing or block printing which are both handmade processes carried out by the local artisans of Jaipur, Sanganer, and Bagru. Jaipuri quilts are designed to keep you warm during winters without irritating your skin. By including elements of traditional art in your modern living spaces, you can preserve the essence of Indian culture wherever you live.

Rallis are commonly used as a covering for wooden sleeping cots, as a floor covering, storage bag, or padding for workers or animals. In the villages, ralli quilts are an important part of a girl&#x27;s dowry. Owning many ralli quilts is a measure of wealth. Parents present rallis to their daughters on their wedding day as a dowry.

Rallis are made from scraps of cotton fabric dyed to the desired color. The most common colors are white, black, red, and yellow or orange with green, dark blue, or purple. For the bottoms of the rallis, the women use old pieces of tie-dye, ajrak, or other shawl fabric. Ralli quilts have a few layers of worn fabric or cotton fibers between the top and bottom layers. The layers are held together by thick colored thread stitched in straight lines. The women sit on the ground and do not use a quilting frame. Another kind of ralli quilt is the &quot;sami ralli&quot;, used by the samis and jogis. This type of ralli quilt is popular due to the many colors and the extensive hand-stitching employed in its construction.

The number of patterns used on ralli quilts seems to be almost endless, as there is much individual expression and spontaneity in color within the traditional patterns. The three basic styles of rallis are: 1) patchwork quilts made from pieces of cloth torn into squares and triangles and then stitched together,
2) appliqué quilts made from intricate cut-out patterns in a variety of shapes, and
3) embroidered quilts where the embroidery stitches form patterns on solid colored fabric.

A distinguishing feature of ralli patterning in patchwork and appliqué quilts is the diagonal placement of similar blocks as well as a variety of embellishments including mirrors, tassels, shells, and embroidery.

Rural women in the Uttara Kannada region of India carry out traditional quilting practices that are interwoven with rituals around food availability and access. Primarily made in Yadgir, Bagalkot, Gulbarga, Angadibail and Haliyal, &quot;Kavudi&quot;s are handmade patchwork quilts with around multiple layers including the batting or insulation.

===Africa, Oceania and South America===

====Cook Islands: Tivaevae quilts====
Tivaevae are quilts made by Cook Island women for ceremonial occasions. Quilting is thought to have been imported to the Islands by missionaries. The quilts are highly prized and are given as gifts with other finely made works on important occasions such as weddings and christenings.

====Egyptian khayamiya====
Khayamiya is a form of suspended tent decoration or portable textile screen used across North Africa and the Middle East. It is an art form distinctive to Egypt, where they are still sewn by hand in the Street of the Tentmakers (Sharia Khayamiya) in Cairo. Whilst Khayamiya resemble quilts, they typically possess a heavy back layer and fine top layer of appliqué, without a central insulating layer.

====Kuna: Mola textiles====
Mola textiles are a distinct tradition created by the Kuna people of Panama and Colombia. They are famous for their bright colors and reverse appliqué techniques, which create designs with strong cultural and spiritual importance within the indigenous culture. Forms of animals, humans, or mythological figures are featured, with strong geometric designs in the voids around the main image. These textiles are not traditionally used as bedding, but use techniques common to the larger international quilting tradition. Molas have been very influential on modern quilting design.

==Block designs==


There are many traditional block designs and techniques that have been named.
*Log cabin quilts are pieced quilts featuring blocks made of strips of fabric, typically encircling a small centered square (traditionally a red square, symbolizing the hearth of the home), with light strips forming half the square and dark strips the other half. Dramatic contrast effects with light and dark fabrics are created by various layouts of the blocks when joined to form a quilt top. These different layout variations are often named; some layouts include Sunshine and Shadow, Straight Furrows, Streak of Lightning, and Barn Raising.
*Nine-patch blocks are often the first blocks a child is taught to make. The block consists of three rows of three squares. A checkerboard effect with alternating dark and light squares is most commonly used.
*The double wedding ring pattern first came to prominence during the Great Depression. The design consists of interlocking circles pieced with small arcs of fabric. The finished quilts are often given to commemorate marriages.

*Cathedral windows is a type of block that features reverse appliqué using large amounts of folded muslin, and consists of modular blocks in an interlocking circular design that frame small squares or diamonds of colorful lightweight cotton. The volume of fabric is high, and the tops are heavy. Because of the weight and the insulating value of the base fabric, these tops often are assembled without batting (and thus need no quilting stitches), and sometimes have no backing. Such a quilt may be called a &quot;counterpane&quot; and may serve mainly as a decorative bedspread.

==Quilting technique==
==Quilts on display==
One of the most famous quilts in history is the AIDS Memorial Quilt, which was begun in San Francisco in 1987, and is cared for by The NAMES Project Foundation. Portions of it are periodically displayed in various arranged locations. Panels are made to memorialize a person lost to HIV, and each block is 3 feet by 6 feet. Many of the blocks are not made by traditional quilters, and the amateur creators may lack technical skill, but their blocks speak directly to the love and loss they have experienced. The blocks are not in fact quilted, as there is no stitching holding together batting and backing layers. Exuberant designs, with personal objects applied, are seen next to restrained and elegant designs. Each block is very personal, and they form a deeply moving sight when combined by the dozens and the hundreds. The quilt as a whole is still under construction, although the entire quilt is now so large that it cannot be assembled in complete form in any one location.

Beginning with the Whitney Museum of American Art&#x27;s 1971 exhibit, &quot;Abstract Design in American Quilts&quot;, quilts have frequently appeared on museum and gallery walls. The exhibit displayed quilts like paintings on its gallery walls, which has since become a standard way to exhibit quilts. The Whitney exhibit helped shift the perception of quilts from solely a domestic craft object to art objects, increasing art world interest in them.

The National Quilt Museum is located in Paducah, Kentucky. The museum houses a large collection of contemporary quilts, and features approximately a dozen exhibitions each year showcasing the works of &quot;today&#x27;s quilters&quot; from America and around the world. 

In 2010, the world-renowned Victoria and Albert Museum put on a comprehensive display of quilts from 1700 to 2010, while in 2009, the American Folk Art Museum in New York put on an exhibition of the work of kaleidoscope quilt maker Paula Nadelstern, marking the first time that museum has ever offered a solo show to a contemporary quilt artist.

Many historic quilts can be seen in Bath at the American Museum in Britain, and Beamish Museum preserves examples of the North East England quiltmaking tradition.

The largest known public collection of quilts is housed at the International Quilt Study Center &amp; Museum at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in Lincoln, Nebraska. In 2018 documentary filmmaker Ken Burns&#x27; personal collection of quilts was exhibited there.

Examples of Tivaevae and other quilts can be found in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.

The San Jose Museum of Quilts and Textiles in California also displays traditional and modern quilts. There is free admission to the museum on the first Friday of every month, as part of the San Jose Art Walk.

The New England Quilt Museum is located in Lowell, Massachusetts.

The Rocky Mountain Quilt Museum is located in Golden, Colorado.

Numerous Hawaiian-style quilts can be seen at Bishop Museum, in Honolulu, Hawaii.

<text>The flag of Oregon is a two-sided flag in navy blue and gold with an optional gold fringe. On the front is the escutcheon from the state seal and on the reverse is a gold figure of a beaver, the state animal. Oregon is the only U.S. state to feature different designs on both sides of its flag (the flag of Massachusetts was changed in 1971 to be single-sided).

==History==

The current flag of Oregon became official on February 26, 1925. What is believed to be the first flag of Oregon produced was made that year by Meier &amp; Frank, sewn by Marjorie Kennedy and Blanche Cox, employees of the department store. That flag was donated to Eastern Oregon University in 1954 by the grandson of former governor Walter M. Pierce. In 2010, the flag was restored.

===Proposed change===
In anticipation of the Oregon Sesquicentennial in 2009, &quot;The Oregonian&quot; organized a statewide contest in 2008 to redesign the state flag. The newspaper collected and published the entries with the public voting on the winning design. The winning design was created by Randall Gray, a map maker for Clackamas County. In his design, Gray emphasized the beaver found on the current flag&#x27;s reverse. The star represents Oregon&#x27;s place in the Union while the green represents the natural wilderness and forests of Oregon. After the contest had started with votes being cast, there were requests for the &quot;Oregonian&quot; to add an 11th option, &quot;NONE OF THE ABOVE&quot;, meaning, keep the current state flag as it is. In the final tally of votes, &quot;NONE&quot; received the most votes.

Finalists
In 2013, a bill was introduced to the Oregon Senate that would have made several changes to the flag design; however, the bill never made it out of committee. This bill was sponsored by state Senator Laurie Monnes Anderson, on behalf of Gresham resident Matt Norquist, who lobbied for the flag&#x27;s change.
The bill describes the proposed design as follows:
==Description==

The flag field is navy blue with all lettering and symbols in gold, representing the state colors of Oregon. On the obverse, the legend &quot;STATE OF OREGON&quot; is written above an escutcheon, which also appears in the Oregon state seal. The shield is surrounded by 33 stars, representing Oregon&#x27;s admission to the Union as the 33rd state. Below the shield is written &quot;1859&quot;, the year in which Oregon became a state.

Oregon&#x27;s flag is the last remaining state flag in the U.S. in which the obverse and reverse sides have different designs. Paraguay is the only country that still has a two-sided flag. Two-sided flags were previously more common, but have been reduced due to increased costs of manufacturing a flag with two different designs. On the reverse of the flag is a depiction, also in gold, of a beaver, the state animal of Oregon.

For dress or parade use, the flag may feature a gold fringe. For standard use, no fringe is required. The ratio of the flag&#x27;s width to its length is 3:5.

It is one of nine U.S. state flags to feature an eagle, alongside those of Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and Wyoming.

<text>Thymidine (symbol dT or dThd), also known as deoxythymidine, deoxyribosylthymine, or thymine deoxyriboside, is a pyrimidine deoxynucleoside. Deoxythymidine is the DNA nucleoside T, which pairs with deoxyadenosine (A) in double-stranded DNA. In cell biology it is used to synchronize the cells in G1/early S phase. 
The prefix deoxy- is often left out since there are no precursors of thymine nucleotides involved in RNA synthesis.

Before the boom in thymidine use caused by the need for thymidine in the production of the antiretroviral drug azidothymidine (AZT), much of the world&#x27;s thymidine production came from herring sperm. Thymidine occurs almost exclusively in DNA but it also occurs in the T-loop of tRNA.

== Structure and properties ==
In its composition, deoxythymidine is a nucleoside composed of deoxyribose (a pentose sugar) joined to the pyrimidine base thymine.

Deoxythymidine can be phosphorylated with one, two or three phosphoric acid groups, creating dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate), dTDP, or dTTP (for the di- and tri- phosphates, respectively).

It exists in solid form as small white crystals or white crystalline powder. It has a molecular weight of and a melting point of 185 °C. The stability of deoxythymidine under standard temperature and pressure (STP) is very high.

Deoxythymidine is non-toxic and is part of one of the four nucleosides in DNA. It is a naturally occurring compound that exists in all living organisms and DNA viruses. Instead of thymidine, RNA contains uridine (uracil joined to ribose). Uracil is chemically very similar to thymine, which is also known as 5-methyluracil. Since thymine nucleotides are precursors of DNA (but not RNA), the prefix &quot;deoxy&quot; is often left out, i.e., deoxythymidine is often just called thymidine.

Thymidine is listed as a chemical teratogen.

== Modified analogs ==

Iododeoxyuridine is a radiosensitizer and increases the amount of DNA damage received from ionizing radiation.

Azidothymidine (AZT) – used in the treatment of HIV infection. AZT inhibits the process of reverse transcription, a critical step in the viral life cycle.

Radiolabeled thymidine (TdR), such as tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR), is commonly used in cell proliferation assays. The thymidine is incorporated into dividing cells and the level of this incorporation, measured using a liquid scintillation counter, is proportional to the amount of cell proliferation. For example, lymphocyte proliferation can be measured this way in lymphoproliferative disorders.

Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) is another thymidine analog that is often used for the detection of proliferating cells in living tissues.

5-Ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine (EdU) is a thymidine analog which is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells and is used to assay DNA synthesis in cell culture or living tissues. It can be visualized by covalently binding a fluorescent azide using click chemistry, which is less harsh than the conditions used to expose the epitope for BrdU antibodies.

Edoxudine is an antiviral drug.

Telbivudine (β--2′-deoxythymidine, LdT) is the unmodified &quot;unnatural&quot; -enantiomer of thymidine that was used in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.

== Thymidine imbalance induces mutation and recombination ==
During growth of bacteriophage T4, an excess of thymidine availability increases mutation. A deficiency of thymidine during growth also increases mutation. A thymidylate auxotroph of the diploid yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; was grown under conditions in which thymidyate levels varied from excess to depletion. High levels of thymidylate were observed to be mutagenic and recombinogenic, whereas starvation for thymidylate was recombinogenic but only slightly mutagenic.

<text>The NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt, often abbreviated to AIDS Memorial Quilt or AIDS Quilt, is a memorial to celebrate the lives of people who have died of AIDS-related causes. Weighing an estimated 54 tons, it is the largest piece of community folk art in the world, It was conceived in 1985, during the early years of the AIDS pandemic, when social stigma prevented many AIDS victims from receiving funerals. It has been displayed on the Mall in Washington, D.C., several times. In 2020, it returned to San Francisco, where it is cared for by the National AIDS Memorial. It can be seen virtually.

==History and structure==
The idea for the NAMES Project Memorial Quilt was conceived on November 27, 1985, by AIDS activist Cleve Jones during the annual candlelight march, in remembrance of the 1978 assassinations of San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone. For the march, Jones had people write the names of loved ones that were lost to AIDS-related causes on signs, and then they taped the signs to the old San Francisco Federal Building. All the signs taped to the building looked like an enormous patchwork quilt to Jones, and he was inspired.

The NAMES Project officially started in 1987 in San Francisco by Jones, Mike Smith, and volunteers Joseph Durant, Jack Caster, Gert McMullin, Ron Cordova, Larkin Mayo, Steve Kirchner, and Gary Yuschalk. At that time many people who died of AIDS-related causes did not receive funerals, due to both the social stigma of AIDS felt by surviving family members and the outright refusal by many funeral homes and cemeteries to handle the deceased&#x27;s remains. Lacking a memorial service or grave site, the Quilt was often the only opportunity survivors had to remember and celebrate their loved ones&#x27; lives. Volunteers created hundreds and later thousands of panels in a storefront on Market Street.

The Quilt is a memorial to and celebration of the lives of people lost to the AIDS pandemic which marks it as a prominent forerunner of the twentieth century shift in memorial design that moved towards celebrating victims or survivors. Each panel measures , approximately the size of the average grave; this connects the ideas of AIDS and death more closely.



===Inaugural Quilt display===
The Quilt made its first public appearance on October 11, 1987, during the Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights on the National Mall. Comprising 1,920 panels and covering an area larger than a football field, 48 volunteers ceremonially unfolded the Quilt at sunrise. Participants read aloud the names represented in the Quilt, establishing a tradition followed at subsequent displays. The event drew half a million visitors that weekend.

===Quilt tours and exhibits===
The inaugural national tour of The Quilt took place in spring and summer 1988, raising nearly half a million dollars. Assisted by over 9,000 volunteers, a seven-person crew traveled, displayed, and expanded The Quilt. Local panels added in each city tripled its size from 1,920 to over 6,000 panels by the tour&#x27;s conclusion.

The 1989 Quilt North America Tour visited 19 U.S. cities, including 7 in Canada, coinciding with local LGBT events in June and July, laying the groundwork for the Canadian AIDS Memorial Quilt. By October, the Quilt featured over 12,000 panels and was once again exhibited on The Ellipse in Washington, D.C.

In October 1992, the entire Quilt, featuring panels from every state and 28 countries, was displayed on Washington&#x27;s National Mall. The quilt, more than 10 times its original size, with over 21,000 handmade panels, stretched from the base of the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial in Presidents Park.

During President Clinton&#x27;s inaugural parade on January 20, 1993, the NAMES Project participated with over 200 volunteers marching down Pennsylvania Avenue, carrying 90 Quilt panels.

Spanning the National Mall from the Washington Monument to the U.S. Capitol in Washington, The Quilt attracted nearly 1.2 million visitors in October 1996. Over the three-day event, more than 40,000 panels were displayed. Notably, President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton attended, marking the last full exhibition of the Quilt on the Mall; by this point in time, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was finally seeing a major decline.

In June 2004, The Quilt featured over 8,000 new panels created since the 1996 exhibit. The display took place on The Ellipse in Washington, in observance of National HIV Testing Day.

For the AIDS Memorial Quilt&#x27;s 25th anniversary in July 2012, comprising over 48,000 panels honoring 94,000 lives lost to AIDS, it returned to the National Mall and 50 sites around D.C. during the XIX International AIDS Conference. Due to its size, organizers rotated 1,500 panels daily at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival. This event marked the quilt&#x27;s last full exhibition since 1996.

As of 2020, the AIDS Memorial Quilt is available online, featuring 50,000 panels with nearly 110,000 names sewn into them. The collection is searchable by block number or name, allowing users to read the stories stitched into each panel. A guide is provided for navigating the collection if required.

In June 2022, the National AIDS Memorial commemorated the 35th anniversary of the AIDS Memorial Quilt with a significant outdoor display in Golden Gate Park&#x27;s Robin Williams Meadow. The exhibition showcased 3,000 panels, offering a poignant tribute to lives affected by AIDS.

===Relocation===
In 1997, the NAMES Project headquarters moved from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., and in 2001 the quilt panels were moved from San Francisco to Atlanta, Georgia. The NAMES Project Foundation was headquartered in Atlanta.

In 2019, the organization announced that the Quilt would be relocating to San Francisco under the permanent care and stewardship of the National AIDS Memorial. In 2020, its archives were relocated to the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. The AIDS Memorial Quilt is warehoused in San Francisco when not being displayed, and continues to grow, consisting of more than 50,000 individual memorial panels (to over 110,000 people) and weighing an estimated 54 tons as of 2022.

===Goal and achievement===
The goal of the Quilt is to bring awareness to how massive the AIDS pandemic really is, and to bring support and healing to those affected by it. Another goal is to raise funds for community-based AIDS service organizations, to increase their funding for AIDS prevention and education. As of 1996, more than $1.7 million had already been raised, and the effort continues to this day.

==Quilt construction and care==
 panels made typically of fabric are created in recognition of a person who died from AIDS-related complications. The panels are made by individuals alone or in a workshop, such as Call My Name (which focuses on African American representation on the quilt) or in quilting bees, such as the one held during the 2012 Smithsonian Folklife Festival on the National Mall. Construction choices are left to the quilter and techniques such as traditional fabric quilting, embroidery, applique, paint and stencil, beading, and iron-ons are common.

Items and materials included in the panels:
* Fabrics such as lace, suede, leather, mink, taffeta, also Bubble Wrap and other kinds of plastic and even metal.
* Decorative items like pearls, quartz crystals, rhinestones, sequins, feathers, buttons.
* Clothing, such as jeans, T-shirts, gloves, boots, hats, uniforms, jackets, flip-flops.
* Items of a personal nature, such as human hair, cremation ashes, wedding rings, merit badges and other awards, car keys.
* Unusual items, such as stuffed animals, records, jockstraps, condoms, and bowling balls.

Panels are submitted to the National AIDS Memorial, along with a panel-maker identification form and a documentation letter. Occasionally, other supplemental material is donated along with the panel such as photographs of the subject. The information about the panel is recorded in a database.

Panels are backed in canvas and sewn together in blocks of eight. Grommets for hanging are attached and the blocks are numbered and photographed. The numbers help with identification and location in storage, on the quilt website, and when the quilt is displayed.

===Examples of panels===
Those who submit panels do not have to know the person, but they do have to feel some sort of connection with the individual that they want people to recognize. For example, to memorialize Queen lead-singer Freddie Mercury, there were many panels made, two of which were a solid white background with a blue and black guitar, and &quot;Freddy Mercury&quot; written down the sides in black, with the AIDS ribbon above his name, and a purple silk with &quot;Freddie Mercury&quot;, &quot;Queen&quot;, and &quot;1946–1991&quot; in silver applique, along with two pictures of Mercury with Queen.

Many panels were also made for the actor Rock Hudson, one of which consisted of a navy blue background with silver &quot;Rock Hudson&quot; and stars, above a rainbow with the word &quot;Hollywood&quot;.

Other panels are made by loved ones and then attached to make one large block. Some are flamboyant and loud, whereas some are more muted and simple.

==Recognition and influence==

Panels have been accessioned into the collection of the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History (accession number 1998.0254.01) and featured in the book &quot;The Smithsonian&#x27;s History of America in 101 Objects&quot;.

=== Awards ===
* The NAMES Project was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.
* In 2002 the NAMES Project Chicago Chapter was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame.

=== Documentaries ===
* The Quilt is the subject of the 1989 Peabody Award- and Academy Award-winning documentary film, &quot;Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt&quot;, produced by Rob Epstein and Bill Couturié, and narrated by Dustin Hoffman.
* &quot;Never to Be Forgotten&quot; is a Philo T. Farnsworth Award-winning 54-minute video created by Karen Peper which documents the Quilt&#x27;s June 1988 visit to Detroit, Michigan. This display was part of a 20-city tour initiated immediately after the 1987 Washington, DC inaugural showing. The video begins with footage of the opening ceremony from the Washington DC display and then moves to coverage of the Detroit event. Included are the opening and closing ceremonies at Cobo Hall along with a look at the set up and take down of the display. Volunteers share their feelings about participating in the event and the viewer is given a close-up look at the individual panels. Peper also shot extensive footage of the Quilt&#x27;s visit to Columbus, OH; Chicago, IL; and the 1987, 1993, and 1996 Washington, D.C., showings. (All video footage is archived at ONE Archives at the USC Libraries in Los Angeles, CA.)

=== Music ===
* Songwriter Tom Brown wrote the song &quot;Jonathan Wesley Oliver, Jr.&quot; about the Quilt in 1988.
* In 1990, John Corigliano&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 1&quot;, inspired by The AIDS Memorial Quilt, premiered in New York.
* &quot;Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens&quot;, a song cycle developed in the late 1980s with music by Janet Hood and lyrics and additional text by Bill Russell, features songs and monologues inspired by The Quilt.
* In 1992 &quot;The AIDS Quilt Songbook&quot; premiered, a collection of new musical works about the devastation of AIDS compiled by lyric baritone William Parker, who solicited them from composers with whom he had previously worked.
* Washington D.C.&#x27;s Different Drummers (DCDD) and the Lesbian and Gay Chorus of Washington (LGCW) commissioned &quot;Quilt Panels&quot; from composer Robert Maggio, and the piece premiered in 2003.
* The NAMES Project was the basis for the musical &quot;Quilt, A Musical Celebration&quot;.

=== Television ===
* The Quilt was displayed on the ABC Soap Opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in 1992.
* The AIDS Memorial Quilt was mentioned and shown during the years that &quot;General Hospital&quot; held their Nurses Ball (1994–2001) and raised money for AIDS research. The show&#x27;s fictional character, Michael &quot;Stone&quot; Cates, was celebrated with a quilt block in 1996.
* In A&amp;E&#x27;s Biography of the 100 Most Influential People of the Millennium, the 94th individual featured is &quot;Patient Zero,&quot; recognized as the first AIDS victim.

* The Quilt is displayed in the last scene of the Showtime miniseries Fellow Travelers in 2023.

=== Comics ===
* Cartoonist Gerard Donelan, specializing in single-panel comics depicting gay men and women in everyday life, contributed cartoons, pamphlets, and posters to the NAMES Project. These pieces were meant to spread awareness about safe-sex practices for gay people and to garner support for the NAMES Project.

===Projects inspired by NAMES===
The AIDS Memorial Quilt was the first of its kind as a continually growing monument created piecemeal by thousands of individuals, and as of 2007, it constituted the largest piece of community folk art in the world. The Quilt was followed by, and inspired a number of memorials and awareness projects, both AIDS-related and otherwise. Examples of these include:
* The K.I.A. Memorial Quilt, created to remember those U.S. Armed Forces members killed in the Iraq War.
* Following the September 11 attacks on the United States, a number of quilt projects were created memorializing the victims.
** September 11 Quilts Memorial Exhibition
** United In Memory
** The World Trade Center Memorial Quilt
** America&#x27;s 9-11 Memorial Quilts
* Many other medical conditions also now have quilts, for example:
** Huntington&#x27;s disease
** Congenital heart disease
** Breast cancer

There are also quilts for sub-sects of the AIDS Pandemic, including Canada, 1989, Children, 2010, North Californians, 2008, Australians, 2009, and New Zealand, 1988. The Irish Names Quilt was created in 1990.

&quot;Virtual&quot; AIDS Memorial Quilts have also been created:
* Project Stitch &quot;Digital Quilt&quot;
* Second Life
* AIDS Action Committee of Massachusetts
* Southern AIDS Living Quilt
* Columbia University AIDS Memorial
* Canadian AIDS Memorial Quilt

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a quilt volunteer, McMullin, made protective masks for community service organizations from quilting fabric.

==Display location==

In November 2019 the NAMES Project Foundation and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the quilt would relocate to San Francisco under the permanent care and stewardship of the National AIDS Memorial starting in 2020. The Project&#x27;s archives were gifted to the joint care with the American Folklife Center at the U.S. Library of Congress, allowing for greater public access. This action returns the quilt to San Francisco, where the project began.

<doc id="89221" wikidata="Q6823951" url="?curid=89221" title="Methyl radical">
<text>Methyl radical is an organic compound with the chemical formula (also written as •). It is a metastable colourless gas, which is mainly produced &quot;in situ&quot; as a precursor to other hydrocarbons in the petroleum cracking industry. It can act as either a strong oxidant or a strong reductant, and is quite corrosive to metals.

== Chemical properties ==
Its first ionization potential (yielding the methenium ion, ) is .

=== Redox behaviour ===
The carbon centre in methyl can bond with electron-donating molecules by reacting:
: + R• → 
Because of the capture of the nucleophile (R•), methyl has oxidising character. Methyl is a strong oxidant with organic chemicals. However, it is equally a strong reductant with chemicals such as water. It does not form aqueous solutions, as it reduces water to produce methanol and elemental hydrogen:
:2  + 2  → 2  + 

=== Structure ===
The molecular geometry of the methyl radical is trigonal planar (bond angles are 120°), although the energy cost of distortion to a pyramidal geometry is small. All other electron-neutral, non-conjugated alkyl radicals are pyramidalized to some extent, though with very small inversion barriers. For instance, the &quot;t&quot;-butyl radical has a bond angle of 118° with a barrier to pyramidal inversion. On the other hand, substitution of hydrogen atoms by more electronegative substituents leads to radicals with a strongly pyramidal geometry (112°), such as the trifluoromethyl radical, , with a much more substantial inversion barrier of around .

=== Chemical reactions ===
Methyl undergoes the typical chemical reactions of a radical. Below approximately , it rapidly dimerises to form ethane. Upon treatment with an alcohol, it converts to methane and either an alkoxy or hydroxyalkyl. Reduction of methyl gives methane. When heated above, at most, , methyl decomposes to produce methylidyne and elemental hydrogen, or to produce methylene and atomic hydrogen:
: → CH• + 
: → + H•
Methyl is very corrosive to metals, forming methylated metal compounds:
:M + &quot;n&quot;  → M(CH3)&quot;n&quot;

== Production ==
===Biosynthesis===
Some radical SAM enzymes generate methyl radicals by reduction of S-adenosylmethionine.

=== Acetone photolysis ===
It can be produced by the ultraviolet photodissociation of acetone vapour at 193 nm:
: → CO + 2 

=== Halomethane photolysis ===
It is also produced by the ultraviolet dissociation of halomethanes:
: → X• + 

=== Methane oxidation ===

It can also be produced by the reaction of methane with the hydroxyl radical: 
:OH• + CH4 → + H2O
This process begins the major removal mechanism of methane from the atmosphere. The reaction occurs in the troposphere or stratosphere. In addition to being the largest known sink for atmospheric methane, this reaction is one of the most important sources of water vapor in the upper atmosphere.

This reaction in the troposphere gives a methane lifetime of 9.6 years. Two more minor sinks are soil sinks (160 year lifetime) and stratospheric loss by reaction with •OH, •Cl and •O1D in the stratosphere (120 year lifetime), giving a net lifetime of 8.4 years.

=== Azomethane pyrolysis ===
Methyl radicals can also be obtained by pyrolysis of azomethane, CH3N=NCH3, in a low-pressure system.

== In the interstellar medium ==

Methyl was discovered in interstellar medium in 2000 by a team led by Helmut Feuchtgruber who detected it using the Infrared Space Observatory. It was first detected in molecular clouds toward the centre of the Milky Way.

<text>Adenosine diphosphate (ADP), also known as adenosine pyrophosphate (APP), is an important organic compound in metabolism and is essential to the flow of energy in living cells. ADP consists of three important structural components: a sugar backbone attached to adenine and two phosphate groups bonded to the 5 carbon atom of ribose. The diphosphate group of ADP is attached to the 5’ carbon of the sugar backbone, while the adenine attaches to the 1’ carbon.

ADP can be interconverted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). ATP contains one more phosphate group than ADP, while AMP contains one fewer phosphate group. Energy transfer used by all living things is a result of dephosphorylation of ATP by enzymes known as ATPases. The cleavage of a phosphate group from ATP results in the coupling of energy to metabolic reactions and a by-product of ADP. ATP is continually reformed from lower-energy species ADP and AMP. The biosynthesis of ATP is achieved throughout processes such as substrate-level phosphorylation, oxidative phosphorylation, and photophosphorylation, all of which facilitate the addition of a phosphate group to ADP.

==Bioenergetics==
ADP cycling supplies the energy needed to do work in a biological system, the thermodynamic process of transferring energy from one source to another. There are two types of energy: potential energy and kinetic energy. Potential energy can be thought of as stored energy, or usable energy that is available to do work. Kinetic energy is the energy of an object as a result of its motion. The significance of ATP is in its ability to store potential energy within the phosphate bonds. The energy stored between these bonds can then be transferred to do work. For example, the transfer of energy from ATP to the protein myosin causes a conformational change when connecting to actin during muscle contraction.

It takes multiple reactions between myosin and actin to effectively produce one muscle contraction, and, therefore, the availability of large amounts of ATP is required to produce each muscle contraction. For this reason, biological processes have evolved to produce efficient ways to replenish the potential energy of ATP from ADP. 

Breaking one of ATP&#x27;s phosphorus bonds generates approximately 30.5 kilojoules per mole of ATP (7.3 kcal). ADP can be converted, or powered back to ATP through the process of releasing the chemical energy available in food; in humans, this is constantly performed via aerobic respiration in the mitochondria. Plants use photosynthetic pathways to convert and store energy from sunlight, also conversion of ADP to ATP. Animals use the energy released in the breakdown of glucose and other molecules to convert ADP to ATP, which can then be used to fuel necessary growth and cell maintenance.

==Cellular respiration==

===Catabolism===
The ten-step catabolic pathway of glycolysis is the initial phase of free-energy release in the breakdown of glucose and can be split into two phases, the preparatory phase and payoff phase. ADP and phosphate are needed as precursors to synthesize ATP in the payoff reactions of the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation mechanism. During the payoff phase of glycolysis, the enzymes phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase facilitate the addition of a phosphate group to ADP by way of substrate-level phosphorylation.
===Glycolysis===

Glycolysis is performed by all living organisms and consists of 10 steps. The net reaction for the overall process of glycolysis is:
:Glucose + 2 NAD+ + 2 Pi + 2 ADP → 2 pyruvate + 2 ATP + 2 NADH + 2 H2O
Steps 1 and 3 require the input of energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi (inorganic phosphate), whereas steps 7 and 10 require the input of ADP, each yielding ATP. The enzymes necessary to break down glucose are found in the cytoplasm, the viscous fluid that fills living cells, where the glycolytic reactions take place.

===Citric acid cycle===

The citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or the TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle is an 8-step process that takes the pyruvate generated by glycolysis and generates 4 NADH, FADH2, and GTP, which is further converted to ATP. It is only in step 5, where GTP is generated, by succinyl-CoA synthetase, and then converted to ATP, that ADP is used (GTP + ADP → GDP + ATP).
===Oxidative phosphorylation===

Oxidative phosphorylation produces 26 of the 30 equivalents of ATP generated in cellular respiration by transferring electrons from NADH or FADH2 to O2 through electron carriers. The energy released when electrons are passed from higher-energy NADH or FADH2 to the lower-energy O2 is required to phosphorylate ADP and once again generate ATP. It is this energy coupling and phosphorylation of ADP to ATP that gives the electron transport chain the name oxidative phosphorylation.
====Mitochondrial ATP synthase complex====

During the initial phases of glycolysis and the TCA cycle, cofactors such as NAD+ donate and accept electrons that aid in the electron transport chain&#x27;s ability to produce a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The ATP synthase complex exists within the mitochondrial membrane (FO portion) and protrudes into the matrix (F1 portion). The energy derived as a result of the chemical gradient is then used to synthesize ATP by coupling the reaction of inorganic phosphate to ADP in the active site of the ATP synthase enzyme; the equation for this can be written as ADP + Pi → ATP.

==Blood platelet activation==
Under normal conditions, small disk-shape platelets circulate in the blood freely and without interaction with one another. ADP is stored in dense bodies inside blood platelets and is released upon platelet activation. ADP interacts with a family of ADP receptors found on platelets (P2Y1, P2Y12, and P2X1), which leads to platelet activation.
* P2Y1 receptors initiate platelet aggregation and shape change as a result of interactions with ADP.
* P2Y12 receptors further amplify the response to ADP and draw forth the completion of aggregation.
ADP in the blood is converted to adenosine by the action of ecto-ADPases, inhibiting further platelet activation via adenosine receptors.

<text>Adenosine monophosphate (AMP), also known as 5&#x27;-adenylic acid, is a nucleotide. AMP consists of a phosphate group, the sugar ribose, and the nucleobase adenine. It is an ester of phosphoric acid and the nucleoside adenosine. As a substituent it takes the form of the prefix adenylyl-.

AMP plays an important role in many cellular metabolic processes, being interconverted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP), as well as allosterically activating enzymes such as myophosphorylase-b. AMP is also a component in the synthesis of RNA. AMP is present in all known forms of life.

==Production and degradation==
AMP does not have the high energy phosphoanhydride bond associated with ADP and ATP. AMP can be produced from ADP by the myokinase (adenylate kinase) reaction when the ATP reservoir in the cell is low:

: 2 ADP → ATP + AMP

Or AMP may be produced by the hydrolysis of one high energy phosphate bond of ADP:

: ADP + H2O → AMP + Pi

AMP can also be formed by hydrolysis of ATP into AMP and pyrophosphate:

: ATP + H2O → AMP + PPi

When RNA is broken down by living systems, nucleoside monophosphates, including adenosine monophosphate, are formed.

AMP can be regenerated to ATP as follows:

: AMP + ATP → 2 ADP (adenylate kinase in the opposite direction)
: ADP + Pi → ATP (this step is most often performed in aerobes by the ATP synthase during oxidative phosphorylation)

AMP can be converted into inosine monophosphate by the enzyme myoadenylate deaminase, freeing an ammonia group.

In a catabolic pathway, the purine nucleotide cycle, adenosine monophosphate can be converted to uric acid, which is excreted from the body in mammals.

== Physiological role in regulation ==

=== AMP-activated kinase regulation ===
The eukaryotic cell enzyme 5&#x27; adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, or AMPK, utilizes AMP for homeostatic energy processes during times of high cellular energy expenditure, such as exercise. Since ATP cleavage, and corresponding phosphorylation reactions, are utilized in various processes throughout the body as a source of energy, ATP production is necessary to further create energy for those mammalian cells. AMPK, as a cellular energy sensor, is activated by decreasing levels of ATP, which is naturally accompanied by increasing levels of ADP and AMP.

Though phosphorylation appears to be the main activator for AMPK, some studies suggest that AMP is an allosteric regulator as well as a direct agonist for AMPK. Furthermore, other studies suggest that the high ratio of AMP:ATP levels in cells, rather than just AMP, activate AMPK. For example, the AMP-activated kinases of &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; and &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; were found to have been activated by AMP, while yeast and plant kinases were not allosterically activated by AMP.

AMP binds to the &quot;γ&quot;-subunit of AMPK, leading to the activation of the kinase, and then eventually a cascade of other processes such as the activation of catabolic pathways and inhibition of anabolic pathways to regenerate ATP. Catabolic mechanisms, which generate ATP through the release of energy from breaking down molecules, are activated by the AMPK enzyme while anabolic mechanisms, which utilize energy from ATP to form products, are inhibited. Though the &quot;γ-&quot;subunit can bind AMP/ADP/ATP, only the binding of AMP/ADP results in a conformational shift of the enzyme protein. This variance in AMP/ADP versus ATP binding leads to a shift in the dephosphorylation state for the enzyme. The dephosphorylation of AMPK through various protein phosphatases completely inactivates catalytic function. AMP/ADP protects AMPK from being inactivated by binding to the &quot;γ&quot;-subunit and maintaining the dephosphorylation state.

==cAMP==

AMP can also exist as a cyclic structure known as cyclic AMP (or cAMP). Within certain cells the enzyme adenylate cyclase makes cAMP from ATP, and typically this reaction is regulated by hormones such as adrenaline or glucagon. cAMP plays an important role in intracellular signaling. In skeletal muscle, cyclic AMP, triggered by adrenaline, starts a cascade (cAMP-dependent pathway) for the conversion of myophosphorylase-b into the phosphorylated form of myophoshorylase-a for glycogenolysis.

<text>Deamination is the removal of an amino group from a molecule. Enzymes that catalyse this reaction are called deaminases.

In the human body, deamination takes place primarily in the liver; however, it can also occur in the kidney. In situations of excess protein intake, deamination is used to break down amino acids for energy. The amino group is removed from the amino acid and converted to ammonia. The rest of the amino acid is made up of mostly carbon and hydrogen, and is recycled or oxidized for energy. Ammonia is toxic to the human system, and enzymes convert it to urea or uric acid by addition of carbon dioxide molecules (which is not considered a deamination process) in the urea cycle, which also takes place in the liver. Urea and uric acid can safely diffuse into the blood and then be excreted in urine.

==Deamination reactions in DNA==

===Cytosine===

Spontaneous deamination is the hydrolysis reaction of cytosine into uracil, releasing ammonia in the process. This can occur in vitro through the use of bisulfite, which deaminates cytosine, but not 5-methylcytosine. This property has allowed researchers to sequence methylated DNA to distinguish non-methylated cytosine (shown up as uracil) and methylated cytosine (unaltered).

In DNA, this spontaneous deamination is corrected for by the removal of uracil (product of cytosine deamination and &quot;not&quot; part of DNA) by uracil-DNA glycosylase, generating an abasic (AP) site. The resulting abasic site is then recognised by enzymes (AP endonucleases) that break a phosphodiester bond in the DNA, permitting the repair of the resulting lesion by replacement with another cytosine. A DNA polymerase may perform this replacement via nick translation, a terminal excision reaction by its 5&#x27;⟶3&#x27; exonuclease activity, followed by a fill-in reaction by its polymerase activity. DNA ligase then forms a phosphodiester bond to seal the resulting nicked duplex product, which now includes a new, correct cytosine (Base excision repair).

===5-methylcytosine===
Spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine results in thymine and ammonia. This is the most common single nucleotide mutation. In DNA, this reaction, if detected prior to passage of the replication fork, can be corrected by the enzyme thymine-DNA glycosylase, which removes the thymine base in a G/T mismatch. This leaves an abasic site that is repaired by AP endonucleases and polymerase, as with uracil-DNA glycosylase.

==== Cytosine deamination increases C-To-T mutations ====
A known result of cytosine methylation is the increase of C-to-T transition mutations through the process of deamination. Cytosine deamination can alter the genome&#x27;s many regulatory functions; previously silenced transposable elements (TEs) may become transcriptionally active due to the loss of CPG sites. TEs have been proposed to accelerate the mechanism of enhancer creation by providing extra DNA that is compatible with the host transcription factors that eventually have an impact on C-to-T mutations.

===Guanine===
Deamination of guanine results in the formation of xanthine. Xanthine, however, still pairs with cytosine.

===Adenine===
Deamination of adenine results in the formation of hypoxanthine. Hypoxanthine, in a manner analogous to the imine tautomer of adenine, selectively base pairs with cytosine instead of thymine. This results in a post-replicative transition mutation, where the original A-T base pair transforms into a G-C base pair.

<doc id="89232" wikidata="Q238563" url="?curid=89232" title="5-Methylcytosine">
<text>5-Methylcytosine (5mC) is a methylated form of the DNA base cytosine (C) that regulates gene transcription and takes several other biological roles. When cytosine is methylated, the DNA maintains the same sequence, but the expression of methylated genes can be altered (the study of this is part of the field of epigenetics). 5-Methylcytosine is incorporated in the nucleoside 5-methylcytidine.

In 5-methylcytosine, a methyl group is attached to the 5th atom in the 6-atom ring, counting counterclockwise from the NH-bonded nitrogen at the six o&#x27;clock position. This methyl group distinguishes 5-methylcytosine from cytosine.

== Discovery ==
While trying to isolate the bacterial toxin responsible for tuberculosis, W.G. Ruppel isolated a novel nucleic acid named tuberculinic acid in 1898 from &quot;Tubercle bacillus&quot;. The nucleic acid was found to be unusual, in that it contained in addition to thymine, guanine and cytosine, a methylated nucleotide. In 1925, Johnson and Coghill successfully detected a minor amount of a methylated cytosine derivative as a product of hydrolysis of tuberculinic acid with sulfuric acid. This report was severely criticized because their identification was based solely on the optical properties of the crystalline picrate, and other scientists failed to reproduce the same result. But its existence was ultimately proven in 1948, when Hotchkiss separated the nucleic acids of DNA from calf thymus using paper chromatography, by which he detected a unique methylated cytosine, quite distinct from conventional cytosine and uracil. After seven decades, it turned out that it is also a common feature in different RNA molecules, although the precise role is uncertain.

== &quot;In vivo&quot; ==
The function of this chemical varies significantly among species:
* In bacteria, 5-methylcytosine can be found at a variety of sites, and is often used as a marker to protect DNA from being cut by native methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes.
* In plants, 5-methylcytosine occurs at CpG, CpHpG and CpHpH sequences (where H = A, C or T).
* In fungi and animals, 5-methylcytosine predominantly occurs at CpG dinucleotides. Most eukaryotes methylate only a small percentage of these sites, but 70-80% of CpG cytosines are methylated in vertebrates. In mammalian cells, clusters of CpG at the 5&#x27; ends of genes are termed CpG islands. 1% of all mammalian DNA is 5mC.

While spontaneous deamination of cytosine forms uracil, which is recognized and removed by DNA repair enzymes, deamination of 5-methylcytosine forms thymine. This conversion of a DNA base from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) can result in a transition mutation. In addition, active enzymatic deamination of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine by the APOBEC family of cytosine deaminases could have beneficial implications on various cellular processes as well as on organismal evolution. The implications of deamination on 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, on the other hand, remains less understood.

== &quot;In vitro&quot; ==
The NH2 group can be removed (deamination) from 5-methylcytosine to form thymine with use of reagents such as nitrous acid; cytosine deaminates to uracil (U) under similar conditions.

5-methylcytosine is resistant to deamination by bisulfite treatment, which deaminates cytosine residues. This property is often exploited to analyze DNA cytosine methylation patterns with bisulfite sequencing.

== Addition and regulation with DNMTs (Eukaryotes) ==
5mC marks are placed on genomic DNA via DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). There are 5 DNMTs in humans: DNMT1, DNMT2, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, and DNMT3L, and in algae and fungi 3 more are present (DNMT4, DNMT5, and DNMT6). DNMT1 contains the replication foci targeting sequence (RFTS) and the CXXC domain which catalyze the addition of 5mC marks. RFTS directs DNMT1 to loci of DNA replication to assist in the maintenance of 5mC on daughter strands during DNA replication, whereas CXXC contains a zinc finger domain for &quot;de novo&quot; addition of methylation to the DNA. DNMT1 was found to be the predominant DNA methyltransferase in all human tissue. Primarily, DNMT3A and DNMT3B are responsible for &quot;de novo&quot; methylation, and DNMT1 maintains the 5mC mark after replication. DNMTs can interact with each other to increase methylating capability. For example, 2 DNMT3L can form a complex with 2 DNMT3A to improve interactions with the DNA, facilitating the methylation. Changes in the expression of DNMT results in aberrant methylation. Overexpression produces increased methylation, whereas disruption of the enzyme decreased levels of methylation.
The mechanism of the addition is as follows: first a cysteine residue on the DNMT&#x27;s PCQ motif creates a nucleophillic attack at carbon 6 on the cytosine nucleotide that is to be methylated. S-Adenosylmethionine then donates a methyl group to carbon 5. A base in the DNMT enzyme deprotonates the residual hydrogen on carbon 5 restoring the double bond between carbon 5 and 6 in the ring, producing the 5-methylcytosine base pair.

== Demethylation ==
After a cytosine is methylated to 5mC, it can be reversed back to its initial state via multiple mechanisms. Passive DNA demethylation by dilution eliminates the mark gradually through replication by a lack of maintenance by DNMT. In active DNA demethylation, a series of oxidations converts it to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC), and the latter two are eventually excised by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), followed by base excision repair (BER) to restore the cytosine. TDG knockout produced a 2-fold increase of 5fC without any statistically significant change to levels of 5hmC, indicating 5mC must be iteratively oxidized at least twice before its full demethylation. The oxidation occurs through the TET (Ten-eleven translocation) family dioxygenases (TET enzymes) which can convert 5mC, 5hmC, and 5fC to their oxidized forms. However, the enzyme has the greatest preference for 5mC and the initial reaction rate for 5hmC and 5fC conversions with TET2 are 4.9-7.6 fold slower. TET requires Fe(II) as cofactor, and oxygen and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) as substrates, and the latter substrate is generated from isocitrate by the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). Cancer however can produce 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) which competes with α-KG, reducing TET activity, and in turn reducing conversion of 5mC to 5hmC.

== Role in humans ==
=== In cancer ===
In cancer, DNA can become both overly methylated, termed hypermethylation, and under-methylated, termed hypomethylation. CpG islands overlapping gene promoters are &quot;de novo&quot; methylated resulting in aberrant inactivation of genes normally associated with growth inhibition of tumors (an example of hypermethylation). Comparing tumor and normal tissue, the former had elevated levels of the methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3A, and mostly DNMT3B, all of which are associated with the abnormal levels of 5mC in cancer. Repeat sequences in the genome, including satellite DNA, Alu, and long interspersed elements (LINE), are often seen hypomethylated in cancer, resulting in expression of these normally silenced genes, and levels are often significant markers of tumor progression. It has been hypothesized that there a connection between the hypermethylation and hypomethylation; over activity of DNA methyltransferases that produce the abnormal &quot;de novo&quot; 5mC methylation may be compensated by the removal of methylation, a type of epigenetic repair. However, the removal of methylation is inefficient resulting in an overshoot of genome-wide hypomethylation. The contrary may also be possible; over expression of hypomethylation may be silenced by genome-wide hypermethylation. Cancer hallmark capabilities are likely acquired through epigenetic changes that alter the 5mC in both the cancer cells and in surrounding tumor-associated stroma within the tumor microenvironment. The anticancer drug Cisplatin has been reported to react with 5mC.

=== As a biomarker of aging ===
&quot;Epigenetic age&quot; refers to the connection between chronological age and levels of DNA methylation in the genome. Coupling the levels of DNA methylation, in specific sets of CpGs called &quot;clock CpGs&quot;, with algorithms that regress the typical levels of collective genome-wide methylation at a given chronological age, allow for epigenetic age prediction. During youth (0–20 years old), changes in DNA methylation occur at a faster rate as development and growth progresses, and the changes begin to slow down at older ages. Multiple epigenetic age estimators exist. Horvath&#x27;s clock measures a multi-tissue set of 353 CpGs, half of which positively correlate with age, and the other half negatively, to estimate the epigenetic age. Hannum&#x27;s clock utilizes adult blood samples to calculate age based on an orthogonal basis of 71 CpGs. Levine&#x27;s clock, known as DNAm PhenoAge, depends on 513 CpGs and surpasses the other age estimators in predicting mortality and lifespan, yet displays bias with non-blood tissues. There are reports of age estimators with the methylation state of only one CpG in the gene ELOVL2. Estimation of age allows for prediction lifespan through expectations of age related conditions that individuals may be subject to based on their 5mC methylation markers.

<text>Christian rock is a form of rock music that features lyrics focusing on matters of Christian faith, often with an emphasis on Jesus, typically performed by Christian individuals. The extent to which their lyrics are explicitly Christian varies between bands. Many bands who perform Christian rock have ties to the contemporary Christian music labels, media outlets, and festivals, while other bands are independent.

==History==

===Christian response to early rock music (1950s–1960s)===
Most traditional and fundamentalist Christians did not view rock music favorably when it became popular with young people from the 1950s, even though country and gospel music often influenced early rock music. In 1952, Archibald Davison, a Harvard professor, summed up the sound of traditional Christian music and why its supporters might not like rock music when he wrote of &quot;... a rhythm that avoids strong pulses; a melody whose physiognomy is neither so characteristic nor so engaging as to make an appeal in its own behalf; counterpoint, which cultivates long-breathed eloquence rather than instant and dramatic effect; a chromaticism which is at all times restricted in amount and lacking in emotionalism; and modality which creates an atmosphere unmistakably ecclesiastical&quot;. In the light of Archibald Davison&#x27;s characterisation it is easy to see how different these two genres of music are. Christians in the United States did not want their children exposed to music with unruly, impassioned vocals, loud guitar-riffs and jarring, hypnotic rhythms. Rock and roll differed from the norm, and thus it was seen by them as a threat.
Often the music was overtly sexual in nature, as in the case of Elvis Presley, who became controversial and massively popular partly for his suggestive stage antics and dancing. However, &quot;Elvis&quot; was a religious person who released a gospel album: &quot;Peace in the Valley&quot;
in 1957. Individual Christians may have listened to or even performed rock music in many cases, but conservative church establishments - particularly in the American South - regarded it as anathema.

&quot;He Touched Me&quot;, a 1972 gospel-music album by Elvis Presley, sold over 1 million copies in the US alone and earned Presley his second of three Grammy Awards. Not counting compilations, it was his third and final album devoted exclusively to gospel music. The song &quot;He Touched Me&quot; was written in 1963 by Bill Gaither, an American singer and songwriter of southern gospel and Contemporary Christian music.

In the 1960s, rock music developed artistically, attained worldwide popularity and became associated with the radical counterculture, firmly alienating many Christians. In 1966 The Beatles, one of the most popular and influential rock-bands of their era, ran into trouble with many of their American fans when John Lennon jokingly offered his opinion that Christianity was dying and that the Beatles were &quot;more popular than Jesus now&quot;. The romantic, melodic rock songs of the band&#x27;s early career had formerly been viewed as relatively inoffensive by Christians, but after the remark, churches nationwide organized Beatles-record burnings and Lennon was forced to apologize. Subsequently, the Beatles and most rock musicians experimented with a more complex, psychedelic style of music that frequently used anti-establishment, drug-related, or sexual lyrics, while The Rolling Stones sang &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; (1968), a song openly written from the point of view of Satan. Allegations of Satanic intent also arose from the Beatles and others of the controversial backmasking recording-technique. This further increased Christian opposition to rock music.

Later, in the 1960s, the escalating Vietnam War, Civil Rights Movement, Paris student riots of 1968 and other events served as catalysts for youth activism and political withdrawal or protest, which became associated with rock bands, whether or not they were openly political. Moreover, many saw the music as promoting a lifestyle of promiscuous &quot;sex, drugs and rock and roll&quot;, also reflected in the behavior of many rock stars. However, there was growing recognition of the diverse musical and ideological potential of rock. Countless new bands sprang up in the mid-to-late 1960s, as rock displaced older, smoother pop styles to become the dominant form of pop music, a position it would enjoy almost continuously until the end of the 20th century.

===Development (mid 1960s–1980s)===

Among the first bands that played Christian rock was the Crusaders, a Southern Californian garage rock band, whose November 1966 Tower Records album &quot;Make a Joyful Noise with Drums and Guitars&quot; is considered one of the first gospel rock releases; John Joseph Thompson identifies it as &quot;the first record of Christian rock&quot;.
Brian Collins characterises Mind Garage as &quot;arguably the first band of its kind&quot;: they recorded the 1967 &quot;Electric Liturgy&quot; at RCA&#x27;s &quot;Nashville Sound&quot; studio in 1969. Both of these recordings were preceded by the rockabilly praise LP &quot;I Like God&#x27;s Style&quot;, written and performed by one 16-year-old Isabel Baker and released on the private Wichita, Kansas Romco label in 1965, which no one published on until the 2000s.

Larry Norman, often described as the &quot;father of Christian rock&quot;, and in his later years &quot;the Grandfather of Christian rock&quot;, who, in 1969 recorded and released &quot;Upon This Rock&quot;, &quot;the first commercially released Jesus rock album&quot;, challenged a view held by some conservative Christians (predominantly fundamentalists) that rock music was anti-Christian. One of his songs, &quot;Why Should the Devil Have All the Good Music?&quot; summarized his attitude and his quest to pioneer Christian rock music. A cover version of Larry Norman&#x27;s Rapture-themed &quot;I Wish We&#x27;d All Been Ready&quot; appears in the Evangelical Christian feature film &quot;A Thief in the Night&quot; and appeared on Cliff Richard&#x27;s Christian album &quot;Small Corners&quot; along with &quot;Why Should the Devil Have All the Good Music?&quot;. 

In 1966, the band Žeteoci (transl. &quot;The Harvesters&quot;) was formed in Yugoslavia. Founded by four students of the Zagreb Catholic Faculty of Theology, Žeteoci performed beat music with religious lyrics, being the first Christian rock band in Yugoslavia and arguably the first Christian rock band in a communist country. Their first and only album, &quot;To nije tajna&quot; (&quot;It Is Not a Secret&quot;), released in 1969, was the second full-length album in the history of Yugoslav rock music. 
They ended their activity in 1971, as the members of the band finished their studies of theology and went on to become priests of the Catholic Church.
Another Christian rock pioneer, Randy Stonehill, released his first album in 1971, the Larry Norman-produced &quot;Born Twice&quot;. In the most common pressing of the album, side one is entirely a live performance. Another early Christian rock album was &quot;Mylon (We Believe)&quot; by Mylon LeFevre, son of members of the southern gospel group The LeFevres. He recorded the album with members of Classics IV and released it through Cotillion Records in 1970. Ocean (Canada) gained gospel pop big hit &quot;Put Your Hand in the Hand&quot; in 1971. Norman Greenbaum and the Doobie Brothers had gospel hits, but they were not christian rockers. Sister Janet Mead had a gospel hit in 1974.

In the late 1970s, Christian rock received exposure through more mainstream rock and folk rock musicians. Bob Dylan became a born-again Christian and released three albums between 1979 and 1981. This period would yield the Grammy winning single &quot;Gotta Serve Somebody&quot; and three successful concert tours that would later see release as &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 13&quot;. Dylan&#x27;s influence was also felt in other members of the folk revival; Arlo Guthrie, for example, converted in 1979 (in part over his concerns over whether he faced a Huntington&#x27;s disease diagnosis like others in his family) and released his own Christian folk-rock album &quot;Outlasting the Blues&quot;; &quot;Outlasting the Blues&quot; received the biggest record label promotion of Guthrie&#x27;s career.

Christian rock was often viewed as a marginal part of the nascent contemporary Christian music (CCM) and contemporary gospel industry in the 1970s and 1980s, though Christian folk rock artists like Bruce Cockburn and rock fusion artists like Phil Keaggy had some cross-over success. Petra and Resurrection Band, two of the bands who brought harder rock into the early CCM community, had their origins in the early to mid-1970s. They reached their height in popularity in the late eighties alongside other Christian-identifying hard rock acts such as Stryper. The latter had videos played on MTV, such as &quot;Calling on You&quot; and &quot;To Hell with the Devil&quot;, and even saw some airtime on mainstream radio stations with their hit song &quot;Honestly&quot;. Christian rock has proved less successful in the UK and Europe, although such artists as Bryn Haworth have found commercial success by combining blues and mainstream rock music with Christian themes.

Michael Knott would be credited for being a pioneer of &quot;alternative Christian rock.&quot; Knott&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Shaded Pain&quot; being noted for lyrics which challenged church morality. This resulted in the album being banned by churches and Christian bookstores. Nevertheless, Knott was still credited for changing the course of Christian rock, with his short-lived company Blonde Vinyl becoming a major source for Christian rock musicians during its existence.

===1990s–present===
The 1990s saw an explosion of Christian rock.

Many of the popular 1990s Christian bands were initially identified as &quot;Christian alternative rock&quot;, including Jars of Clay, Newsboys, Audio Adrenaline and the later albums of DC Talk. Outside Anglophone countries, bands like Oficina G3 (Brazil) and The Kry (Quebec, Canada) have achieved moderate success.
By the late 1990s and early 2000s, the success of Christian-inspired acts like Skillet, Thousand Foot Krutch, Decyfer Down, Underoath, Kutless, Disciple, P.O.D., Switchfoot, and Relient K saw a shift toward mainstream exposure in the Christian rock scene.

Rock label Tooth &amp; Nail Records would be credited for having &quot;altered the course of the Christian rock industry by launching and legitimizing the careers of MxPx, The O.C. Supertones and Underoath.&quot;

Among popular Christian rock bands of the first decade of the 21st century that exemplified this trend were RED and Fireflight.

There are also some Roman Catholic bands such as Critical Mass. Some Eastern Orthodox Christian rock groups, mostly from Russia and the Soviet Union, started performing in the late 1980s and 1990s. Alisa and Black Coffee are credited as the most prominent examples. The Orthodox Christian lyrics of these bands often overlap with historical and patriotic songs about Kievan Rus&#x27;.

The musical genre that was once rejected by mainstream Christian churches is now considered by some as one of the most-important evangelism tool of their successor congregations. According to Terri McLean, author of New Harmonies, old-guard churches (United Methodist is given as an example) of the late 1990s were experiencing a rapid decline in membership and were under threat of disbandment within the next decade, a trend that has been going on since the 1980s. McLean, using numerous quotes from theologians, Christian apologists and professors, goes on to offer contemporary Christian music as the reason for the falling popularity of more traditionalist churches. The definition of contemporary Christian, as offered by &quot;New Harmonies&quot;, is of a genre not far removed from traditional hymns; it is simply more accessible. The reality is that while a form of modernized hymns do exist in today&#x27;s churches and do affect church evangelism and growth, there also exists both within and outside these churches a form of music (Christian rock) that has only one element in common with previous religious genres: its worship of God.

This element, the worship of God, is what was originally removed from or hidden within the lyrics of early, secular rock n&#x27; roll. Santino described one method of changing Christian lyrics as a process that transformed &quot;lyrics that sang of the mystical love of God into lyrics that celebrated the earthly love of woman&quot;. Howard &amp; Streck offer examples of this, comparing Ray Charles&#x27; &quot;This Little Girl of Mine&quot; to &quot;This Little Light of Mine&quot; and &quot;Talking About You&quot; to &quot;Talking About Jesus&quot;. They claim that because of actions such as this, despite the liberal editing of the original hymns, &quot;gospel &#x27;showed rock how to sing&#x27;&quot;. Howard &amp; Streck go on to describe how the conflict between music and religion, spearheaded by southern fundamentalists, was originally racially based, but how in the sixties this moved on to a clash over the perceived lifestyle of rock musicians.
==Definitions==
There are multiple definitions of what qualifies as a &quot;Christian rock&quot; band. Christian rock bands that explicitly state their beliefs and use religious imagery in their lyrics, like Servant, Third Day, and Petra, tend to be considered a part of the contemporary Christian music (CCM) industry.

Other bands perform music influenced by their faith or containing Christian imagery, but see their audience as the general public. For example, Bono of U2 combines many elements of spirituality and faith into his lyrics, but the band is not directly labeled as a &quot;Christian rock&quot; band.

Such bands are sometimes rejected by the CCM rock scene and may specifically reject the CCM label.
Other bands may experiment with more abrasive musical styles. Beginning in the 1990s and 2000s there was much wider acceptance even by religious purists of Christian metal, Christian industrial and Christian punk. Many of these bands are on predominantly Christian record labels, such as Tooth and Nail Records and Facedown Records.

Rock artists, such as Switchfoot, do not claim to be &quot;Christian bands&quot;, but include members who openly profess to be Christians or at times may feature Christian thought, imagery, scripture or other influences in their music.
Some of these bands, like Creed, played up the spiritual content of their music and were widely considered a &quot;Christian band&quot; by the popular media. Some bands reject the label because they do not wish to exclusively attract Christian fans, or because they have been identified with another particular music genre, such as heavy metal or indie rock.

==Evangelism==

The aims for making Christian music vary among different artists and bands. Often, the music makes evangelistic calls for Christian forms of praise and worship. Accompanying such music, street outreach, local festivities, church functions, and many alternative forms of internal or (soulful) expression may occur.

Some Christian artists as Third Day, Kutless, Thousand Foot Krutch and Disciple have sung songs that carry overtly Christian messages. Bands such as Underoath, Blessthefall and Haste the Day incorporate symbolism and Christian messages more indirectly. Bands such as Flyleaf do not call themselves Christian bands, though they state that their Christian faith affects their lyrics. Bands such as Switchfoot have said they try to write music for both Christians and non-Christians alike.

==Festivals==

Festivals range from single day events to multiple-day festivals that provide camping and other activities.

One of the first in the US was the six-day Explo &#x27;72 held in Dallas, Texas in June 1972 that was attended by around 80,000 people with around 100,000150,000 at the final concert and which featured acts such as Larry Norman, The Archers, Love Song, Randy Matthews, Children of the Day, Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson.

Significant festivals in the US are Creation Festival, Ichthus Festival, and Cornerstone Festival. There is also a festival in Orlando, Florida called Rock the Universe, a two-day festival at Universal Orlando Resort that overlaps with the Night of Joy event at Walt Disney World. Ichthus, currently held in Kentucky, is a three-day festival that involves over 65 bands.

There are also many in the UK, including Greenbelt Festival, Soul Survivor, BigChurchDayOut, &#x27;Ultimate Events&#x27; at Alton Towers, Frenzy in Edinburgh and Creation Fest, Woolacombe, Devon, which is not related to Creationfest in the United States.

The Flevo Festival of The Netherlands, which offers seminars, theater, stand-up comedy, sports and movies as well as Christian music from a wide variety of genres, is considered to be one of the biggest Christian festivals in Europe. It was discontinued in 2013, due to financial issues. It has been unofficially restarted by a collection of Christian organizations who previously collaborated on Flevo Festival under the new name of Flavor Festival.

Skjærgårdsfestivalen is an annual music festival held in Norway, which headlines Christian rock bands.

Many events are held in Australia called, Easterfest (in Toowoomba) Encounterfest, Jam United, Black Stump and Big Exo Day. Bogotá, Colombia hosts the summer festival Gospel al Parque.

The most &quot;underground&quot; expression of Christian rock was the annual Cornerstone Festival sponsored by the Jesus People USA, a community which formed during the Jesus Movement of the 1970s. The festival ceased operations in 2012.

<text>Demethylation is the chemical process resulting in the removal of a methyl group (CH3) from a molecule. A common way of demethylation is the replacement of a methyl group by a hydrogen atom, resulting in a net loss of one carbon and two hydrogen atoms.

The counterpart of demethylation is methylation.

== In biochemistry ==

Demethylation is relevant to epigenetics. Demethylation of DNA is catalyzed by demethylases. These enzymes oxidize N-methyl groups, which occur in histones, in lysine derivatives, and in some forms of DNA. 
:R2N-CH3 + O → R2N-H + CH2O
One family of such oxidative enzymes is the cytochrome P450. Alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases are also active for demethylation of DNA, operating by a similar stoichiometry. These reactions, which proceed via hydroxylation, exploit the slightly weakened C-H bonds of methylamines and methyl ethers.

Demethylation of some sterols are steps in the biosynthesis of testosterone and cholesterol. Methyl groups are lost as formate.

==Biomass processing==
Methoxy groups heavily decorate the biopolymer lignin. Much interest has been shown in converting this abundant form of biomass into useful chemicals (aside from fuel). One step in such processing is demethylation.
 The demethylation of vanillin, a derivative of lignin, requires and strong base. Pulp and paper industry digests lignin using aqueous sodium sulfide, which partially depolymerizes the lignin. Delignification is accompanied by extensive O-demethylation, yielding methanethiol, which is emitted by paper mills.

==In organic chemistry==
Demethylation often refers to cleavage of ethers, especially aryl ethers.

Historically, aryl methyl ethers, including natural products such as codeine (&quot;O&quot;-methylmorphine), have been demethylated by heating the substance in molten pyridine hydrochloride (melting point ) at , sometimes with excess hydrogen chloride, in a process known as the &quot;Zeisel–Prey ether cleavage&quot;. Quantitative analysis for aromatic methyl ethers can be performed by argentometric determination of the &quot;N&quot;-methylpyridinium chloride formed. The mechanism of this reaction starts with proton transfer from pyridinium ion to the aryl methyl ether, a highly unfavorable step (&quot;K&quot; &lt; 10−11) that accounts for the harsh conditions required, given the much weaker acidity of pyridinium (p&quot;K&quot;a = 5.2) compared to the protonated aryl methyl ether (an arylmethyloxonium ion, p&quot;K&quot;a = –6.7 for aryl = Ph). This is followed by SN2 attack of the arylmethyloxonium ion at the methyl group by either pyridine or chloride ion (depending on the substrate) to give the free phenol and, ultimately, &quot;N&quot;-methylpyridinium chloride, either directly or by subsequent methyl transfer from methyl chloride to pyridine.

Another classical (but, again, harsh) method for the removal of the methyl group of an aryl methyl ether is to heat the ether in a solution of hydrogen bromide or hydrogen iodide sometimes also with acetic acid. The cleavage of ethers by hydrobromic or hydroiodic acid proceeds by protonation of the ether, followed by displacement by bromide or iodide. A slightly milder set of conditions uses cyclohexyl iodide (CyI, 10.0 equiv) in &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethylformamide to generate a small amount of hydrogen iodide &quot;in situ&quot;. 

Boron tribromide, which can be used at room temperature or below, is a more specialized reagent for the demethylation of aryl methyl ethers. The mechanism of ether dealkylation proceeds via the initial reversible formation of a Lewis acid-base adduct between the strongly Lewis acidic BBr3 and the Lewis basic ether. This Lewis adduct can reversibly dissociate to give a dibromoboryl oxonium cation and Br–. Rupture of the ether linkage occurs through the subsequent nucleophilic attack on the oxonium species by Br– to yield an aryloxydibromoborane and methyl bromide. Upon completion of the reaction, the phenol is liberated along with boric acid (H3BO3) and hydrobromic acid (aq. HBr) upon hydrolysis of the dibromoborane derivative during aqueous workup.
Stronger nucleophiles such as diorganophosphides (LiPPh2) also cleave aryl ethers, sometimes under mild conditions. Other strong nucleophiles that have been employed include thiolate salts like EtSNa.

Aromatic methyl ethers, particularly those with an adjacent carbonyl group, can be regioselectively demethylated using magnesium iodide etherate. An example of this being used is in the synthesis of the natural product Calphostin A, as seen below.
Methyl esters also are susceptible to demethylation, which is usually achieved by saponification. Highly specialized demethylations are abundant, such as the Krapcho decarboxylation:
A mixture of anethole, KOH, and alcohol was heated in an autoclave. Although the product of this reaction was the expected anol, a highly reactive dimerization product in the mother liquors called dianol was also discovered by Charles Dodds.

===&quot;N&quot;-demethylation===
&quot;N&quot;-demethylation of 3° amines is by the von Braun reaction, which uses BrCN as the reagent to give the corresponding &quot;nor-&quot; derivatives. A modern variation of the von Braun reaction was developed, where BrCN was superseded by ethyl chloroformate. The preparation of Paxil from arecoline is an application of this reaction, as well as the synthesis of GSK-372,475, for example.

The &quot;N&quot;-demethylation of imipramine gives desipramine.

<text>Gene knockouts (also known as gene deletion or gene inactivation) are a widely used genetic engineering technique that involves the targeted removal or inactivation of a specific gene within an organism&#x27;s genome. This can be done through a variety of methods, including homologous recombination, CRISPR-Cas9, and TALENs.

One of the main advantages of gene knockouts is that they allow researchers to study the function of a specific gene in vivo, and to understand the role of the gene in normal development and physiology as well as in the pathology of diseases. By studying the phenotype of the organism with the knocked out gene, researchers can gain insights into the biological processes that the gene is involved in.

There are two main types of gene knockouts: complete and conditional. A complete gene knockout permanently inactivates the gene, while a conditional gene knockout allows for the gene to be turned off and on at specific times or in specific tissues. Conditional knockouts are particularly useful for studying developmental processes and for understanding the role of a gene in specific cell types or tissues.

Gene knockouts have been widely used in many different organisms, including bacteria, yeast, fruit flies, zebrafish, and mice. In mice, gene knockouts are commonly used to study the function of specific genes in development, physiology, and cancer research.

The use of gene knockouts in mouse models has been particularly valuable in the study of human diseases. For example, gene knockouts in mice have been used to study the role of specific genes in cancer, neurological disorders, immune disorders, and metabolic disorders.

However, gene knockouts also have some limitations. For example, the loss of a single gene may not fully mimic the effects of a genetic disorder, and the knockouts may have unintended effects on other genes or pathways. Additionally, gene knockouts are not always a good model for human disease as the mouse genome is not identical to the human genome, and mouse physiology is different from human physiology.

The KO technique is essentially the opposite of a gene knock-in. Knocking out two genes simultaneously in an organism is known as a double knockout (DKO). Similarly the terms triple knockout (TKO) and quadruple knockouts (QKO) are used to describe three or four knocked out genes, respectively. However, one needs to distinguish between heterozygous and homozygous KOs. In the former, only one of two gene copies (alleles) is knocked out, in the latter both are knocked out.

==Methods==
Knockouts are accomplished through a variety of techniques. Originally, naturally occurring mutations were identified and then gene loss or inactivation had to be established by DNA sequencing or other methods.

==Gene knockout by mutation==
Gene knockout by mutation is commonly carried out in bacteria. An early instance of the use of this technique in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; was published in 1989 by Hamilton, et al. In this experiment, two sequential recombinations were used to delete the gene. This work established the feasibility of removing or replacing a functional gene in bacteria. That method has since been developed for other organisms, particularly research animals, like mice. Knockout mice are commonly used to study genes with human equivalents that may have significance for disease. An example of a study using knockout mice is an investigation of the roles of Xirp proteins in Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome (SUNDS) and Brugada Syndrome in the Chinese Han Population.

==Gene silencing==
For gene knockout investigations, RNA interference (RNAi), a more recent method, also known as gene silencing, has gained popularity. In RNA interference (RNAi), messenger RNA for a particular gene is inactivated using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA). This effectively stops the gene from being expressed. Oncogenes like Bcl-2 and p53, as well as genes linked to neurological disease, genetic disorders, and viral infections, have all been targeted for gene silencing utilizing RNA interference (RNAi).

===Homologous recombination===

Homologous recombination is the exchange of genes between two DNA strands that include extensive regions of base sequences that are identical to one another. In eukaryotic species, bacteria, and some viruses, homologous recombination happens spontaneously and is a useful tool in genetic engineering. Homologous recombination, which takes place during meiosis in eukaryotes, is essential for the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks and promotes genetic variation by allowing the movement of genetic information during chromosomal crossing. Homologous recombination, a key DNA repair mechanism in bacteria, enables the insertion of genetic material acquired through horizontal transfer of genes and transformation into DNA. Homologous recombination in viruses influences the course of viral evolution. Homologous recombination, a type of gene targeting used in genetic engineering, involves the introduction of an engineered mutation into a particular gene in order to learn more about the function of that gene. This method involves inserting foreign DNA into a cell that has a sequence similar to the target gene while being flanked by sequences that are the same upstream and downstream of the target gene. The target gene&#x27;s DNA is substituted with the foreign DNA sequence during replication when the cell detects the similar flanking regions as homologues. The target gene is &quot;knocked out&quot; by the exchange. By using this technique to target particular alleles in embryonic stem cells in mice, it is possible to create knockout mice. With the aid of gene targeting, numerous mouse genes have been shut down, leading to the creation of hundreds of distinct mouse models of various human diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders. Mario Capecchi, Sir Martin J. Evans, and Oliver Smithies performed groundbreaking research on homologous recombination in mouse stem cells, and they shared the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their findings. Traditionally, homologous recombination was the main method for causing a gene knockout. This method involves creating a DNA construct containing the desired mutation. For knockout purposes, this typically involves a drug resistance marker in place of the desired knockout gene. The construct will also contain a minimum of 2kb of homology to the target sequence. The construct can be delivered to stem cells either through microinjection or electroporation. This method then relies on the cell&#x27;s own repair mechanisms to recombine the DNA construct into the existing DNA. This results in the sequence of the gene being altered, and most cases the gene will be translated into a nonfunctional protein, if it is translated at all. However, this is an inefficient process, as homologous recombination accounts for only 10−2 to 10−3 of DNA integrations. Often, the drug selection marker on the construct is used to select for cells in which the recombination event has occurred.
These stem cells now lacking the gene could be used in vivo, for instance in mice, by inserting them into early embryos. If the resulting chimeric mouse contained the genetic change in their germline, this could then be passed on offspring.

In diploid organisms, which contain two alleles for most genes, and may as well contain several related genes that collaborate in the same role, additional rounds of transformation and selection are performed until every targeted gene is knocked out. Selective breeding may be required to produce homozygous knockout animals.

===Site-specific nucleases===
There are currently three methods in use that involve precisely targeting a DNA sequence in order to introduce a double-stranded break. Once this occurs, the cell&#x27;s repair mechanisms will attempt to repair this double stranded break, often through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which involves directly ligating the two cut ends together. This may be done imperfectly, therefore sometimes causing insertions or deletions of base pairs, which cause frameshift mutations. These mutations can render the gene in which they occur nonfunctional, thus creating a knockout of that gene. This process is more efficient than homologous recombination, and therefore can be more easily used to create biallelic knockouts.

====Zinc-fingers====

Zinc-finger nucleases consist of DNA binding domains that can precisely target a DNA sequence. Each zinc-finger can recognize codons of a desired DNA sequence, and therefore can be modularly assembled to bind to a particular sequence. These binding domains are coupled with a restriction endonuclease that can cause a double stranded break (DSB) in the DNA. Repair processes may introduce mutations that destroy functionality of the gene.

====TALENS====

Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) also contain a DNA binding domain and a nuclease that can cleave DNA. The DNA binding region consists of amino acid repeats that each recognize a single base pair of the desired targeted DNA sequence. If this cleavage is targeted to a gene coding region, and NHEJ-mediated repair introduces insertions and deletions, a frameshift mutation often results, thus disrupting function of the gene.

====CRISPR/Cas9====

CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is a genetic engineering technique that allows for precise editing of the genome. One application of CRISPR is gene knockout, which involves disabling or &quot;knocking out&quot; a specific gene in an organism.

The process of gene knockout with CRISPR involves three main steps: designing a guide RNA (gRNA) that targets a specific location in the genome, delivering the gRNA and a Cas9 enzyme (which acts as a molecular scissors) to the target cell, and then allowing the cell to repair the cut in the DNA. When the cell repairs the cut, it can either join the cut ends back together, resulting in a non-functional gene, or introduce a mutation that disrupts the gene&#x27;s function.

This technique can be used in a variety of organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals, and it allows scientists to study the function of specific genes by observing the effects of their absence. CRISPR-based gene knockout is a powerful tool for understanding the genetic basis of disease and for developing new therapies. 

It is important to note that CRISPR-based gene knockout, like any genetic engineering technique, has the potential to produce unintended or harmful effects on the organism, so it should be used with caution. The coupled Cas9 will cause a double stranded break in the DNA. Following the same principle as zinc-fingers and TALENs, the attempts to repair these double stranded breaks often result in frameshift mutations that result in an nonfunctional gene. Non invasive CRISPR-Cas9 technology has successfully knocked out a gene associated in depression and anxiety in mice, being the first successful delivery passing through the blood–brain barrier to enable gene modification.

===Knock-in===

Gene knock-in is similar to gene knockout, but it replaces a gene with another instead of deleting it.

==Types==

===Conditional knockouts===

A conditional gene knockout allows gene deletion in a tissue in a tissue specific manner. This is required in place of a gene knockout if the null mutation would lead to embryonic death, or a specific tissue or cell type is of specific interest. This is done by introducing short sequences called loxP sites around the gene. These sequences will be introduced into the germ-line via the same mechanism as a knockout. This germ-line can then be crossed to another germline containing Cre-recombinase which is a viral enzyme that can recognize these sequences, recombines them and deletes the gene flanked by these sites. Other recombinases have since been created and employed in conditional knockout experiments.

==Use==

Knockouts are primarily used to understand the role of a specific gene or DNA region by comparing the knockout organism to a wildtype with a similar genetic background.

Knockout organisms are also used as screening tools in the development of drugs, to target specific biological processes or deficiencies by using a specific knockout, or to understand the mechanism of action of a drug by using a library of knockout organisms spanning the entire genome, such as in &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;.

<doc id="89243" wikidata="Q1713106" url="?curid=89243" title="Upskirt">
<text>Upskirting or upskirt photography is the practice of taking photographs or videos under a person&#x27;s skirt or kilt, capturing an image or video of the crotch area, showing underwear such as panties, and sometimes genitalia. An &quot;upskirt&quot; is a photograph, video, or illustration which incorporates such an image, although the term may also be used to refer to &quot;the area of the body&quot; inside a skirt, usually from below and while being worn.

The practice is a form of sexual fetishism or voyeurism and is similar in nature to downblouse photography. The primary ethical and legal issue relating to upskirt photography in the United States is the reasonable expectation of privacy, even in a public place. In a few countries, nonconsensual upskirting is a criminal sexual offense.

==Social attitudes==
The sudden popularity in the 1960s of the miniskirt brought the concept out onto the streets and was viewed by many as mass exhibitionism. One commentator in the 1960s said, &quot;In European countries... they ban mini-skirts in the streets and say they&#x27;re an invitation to rape...&quot; By contrast, many women viewed the new style as rebellion against previous clothing styles and as women&#x27;s liberation of their own bodies. For the first time, many women felt comfortable exposing their thighs, whether on the beach in a swimsuit or in street wear, and were even relaxed when in some situations their underwear would be visible.

Some upskirt and downblouse images are made with the knowledge and lack of objection of the females affected. However, some of these images can end up being more widely distributed or being posted onto the Internet without the knowledge and consent of the subject, for example as revenge porn following a relationship breakup.

Attitudes hardened with the very widespread availability and use of digital photographic and video technology, most recently camera phones. Such technology was also being used to record upskirt and downblouse images for uploading onto the internet. Specialist websites came into existence where people could share such images, and terms such as &quot;upskirt&quot;, &quot;downblouse&quot; and &quot;nipple dress&quot; (i.e., when an erect nipple is evident through the material of a woman&#x27;s dress) came into use. Of particular concern were images of minors and of people who could be identified. Celebrities were popular victims of such efforts. Issues of privacy and reputation began to be raised.

The creation and viewing of this type of image came increasingly to be described as forms of voyeurism and pornography. This was not that most of such images were sexual in nature, with most of them being quite innocent by themselves, but because of their association with the nature of the website on which they were posted and because of the size of the collections.

==Safety shorts==
One of the things that skirt-wearers do to avoid upskirts, particularly those who are prominently in public such as female athletes and celebrities as well as schoolgirls, is the wearing of &quot;safety shorts&quot; or simply shorts under their skirts to protect themselves from upskirting.

==Legality by country==
Many countries do not have laws which protect a person&#x27;s right to personal privacy, especially in a public place, but the legal position does vary considerably.

===Australia===
All jurisdictions within Australia have passed laws making it illegal to take upskirt photos in public places without the person&#x27;s consent.

===Finland===
In 2010, an elderly man had his camera confiscated and was fined 12 day-fines for the act of &quot;public obscenity&quot; (which was thought to be the closest match in the criminal code), having taken dozens of upskirt photos in a shopping centre in Turku.

===France===
In August of 2018, France passed its first law specifically criminalizing upskirt voyeurism, defined as &quot;using any means in order to perceive the private parts of a person which that person... when committed without the knowledge or consent of the person&quot;. The law makes such offenses punishable by one year in prison and a fine of 15,000 euros.

===Germany===
In November 2019, the German Bundestag approved a bill to criminalize both upskirting and &quot;criminalize photographing victims of accidents or pictures that&quot; show a dead person in a grossly offensive way; German media has referred to the latter as rubbernecking.

===India===
In India, under section 66E, of the Information Technology Act, &quot;Whoever, intentionally or knowingly captures, publishes or transmits the image of a private area of any person without his or her consent, under circumstances violating the privacy of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to three years or with fine not exceeding two lakh (200,000) rupees, or with both&quot;. The words &quot;private area&quot; mean the naked or undergarment-clad genitals, pubic area, buttocks or female breast; &quot;under circumstances violating privacy&quot; means circumstances in which a person can have a reasonable expectation that any part of his or her private area would not be visible to the public, regardless of whether that person is in a public or private place.

===Japan===

In Japan, prefecture level Trouble Prevention Ordinances (迷惑防止条例) prohibit secret photography, along with stalking, chikan and other offenses. Although every prefecture in the country has adopted some variation of the ordinance, details vary greatly.

In June 2023, as a part of the sex crime reform, Japanese parliament passed a new law that replaces the prefecture-dependent implementations of Trouble Prevention Ordinances. Under the new law, the act of secretly photographing or filming a person&#x27;s sexual appearance, as well as providing such photos or videos to a third person, are subject to imprisonment of up to three years or a fine of up to 3 million Japanese yen.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, it is illegal to make a visual recording of a person&#x27;s intimate parts in any setting in which the person has a &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot;. This includes public and private settings. It is also illegal to possess or distribute such images.

===South Korea===
In South Korea, the Sexual Violence Punishment Act prohibits secret photography, the photographing of people without their permission. Such filming is subject to criminal penalties and results in those convicted being registered as sex offenders. This applies to activities such as upskirting and also to filming a clothed person from a long distance. If the person being photographed is a minor, the punishment is more severe. It is the filming, not the distribution, that constitutes the crime. When a person is photographed from a long distance, the court judges whether there is &quot;sexual intention&quot; or a &quot;sexual body part&quot; is photographed or &quot;sexual shame&quot; is the result. The law has been criticized for having no clear standards for legal interpretation. Some South Korean lawyers suggest that posting videos of street events such as Halloween on social media may constitute a sex crime.

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
Since April 2019, upskirting has constituted the specific offence of voyeurism under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. It is defined as creating images of or operating equipment to view genitals, buttocks or underwear beneath clothing where they would not normally be visible, for the purpose of sexual gratification or to cause humiliation, alarm or distress. The maximum sentence for the offence is two years&#x27; imprisonment and in the more serious sexual cases those convicted are added to the Violent and Sex Offender Register.

Before 2019, there were no specific laws against upskirting in England and Wales. When upskirting took place in public, it was outside of the scope of the offence of voyeurism under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Nevertheless, prosecutions for upskirting were successful under the common law offence of outraging public decency, which requires the presence of at least two other people and for the act to be done in a public place.

Following a public campaign to change the law, a government bill was introduced to the House of Commons on 21 June 2018. Speaking on the government&#x27;s behalf in the House of Lords, Baroness Vere of Norbiton said the legislation would also protect men wearing kilts. The Voyeurism (Offences) Act 2019 received royal assent on 12 February 2019, taking effect two months later.

====Scotland====
Upskirting is a specific offence in Scotland under the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010. This act, which was passed by the Scottish Parliament, extended the definition of voyeurism to cover upskirting.

====Northern Ireland====
As in England and Wales before 2019, there is no specific offence of upskirting in Northern Ireland, but can in certain circumstances be prosecuted as the common law offence of outraging public decency.

===United States===
In the United States, laws vary by state. At the federal level the United States enacted the &quot;Video Voyeurism Prevention Act&quot; of 2004 to punish those who intentionally make an image of an individual&#x27;s private areas without consent, when the person knew the subject had an expectation of privacy. This act applies only in areas under federal jurisdiction.

Additionally, many state laws address the issue as well.

A 2005 Illinois law made it a crime to videotape or transmit upskirt videos of other people without their consent. A 2014 Chicago ordinance made the crime punishable by a $500 fine.

In March 2014, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court overruled a lower court upskirt ruling because the women photographed were not nude or partially nude, saying that existing so-called Peeping Tom laws protect people from being photographed in dressing rooms and bathrooms when nude or partially nude, but it does not protect clothed people in public areas. A law was then passed in Massachusetts to ban the practice.

In September 2014, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals voided the state&#x27;s statute against &quot;improper photography or visual recording&quot; including &quot;upskirt&quot; photos, saying its wording was overly broad. The court&#x27;s opinion stated: &quot;Protecting someone who appears in public from being the object of sexual thoughts seems to be the sort of &#x27;paternalistic interest in regulating the defendant&#x27;s mind&#x27; that the First Amendment was designed to guard against.&quot;

<text>In number theory, a prime number &quot;p&quot; is a Sophie Germain prime if 2&quot;p&quot; + 1 is also prime. The number 2&quot;p&quot; + 1 associated with a Sophie Germain prime is called a safe prime. For example, 11 is a Sophie Germain prime and 2 × 11 + 1 = 23 is its associated safe prime. Sophie Germain primes and safe primes have applications in public key cryptography and primality testing. It has been conjectured that there are infinitely many Sophie Germain primes, but this remains unproven.

Sophie Germain primes are named after French mathematician Sophie Germain, who used them in her investigations of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. One attempt by Germain to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem was to let &quot;p&quot; be a prime number of the form 8&quot;k&quot; + 7 and to let &quot;n&quot; = &quot;p&quot; – 1. In this case, formula_1 is unsolvable. Germain’s proof, however, remained unfinished. Through her attempts to solve Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, Germain developed a result now known as Germain&#x27;s Theorem which states that if &quot;p&quot; is an odd prime and 2&quot;p&quot; + 1 is also prime, then &quot;p&quot; must divide &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, or &quot;z.&quot; Otherwise, formula_2. This case where &quot;p&quot; does not divide &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, or &quot;z&quot; is called the first case. Sophie Germain’s work was the most progress achieved on Fermat’s last theorem at that time. Later work by Kummer and others always divided the problem into first and second cases.

==Individual numbers==
The first few Sophie Germain primes (those less than 1000) are

:2, 3, 5, 11, 23, 29, 41, 53, 83, 89, 113, 131, 173, 179, 191, 233, 239, 251, 281, 293, 359, 419, 431, 443, 491, 509, 593, 641, 653, 659, 683, 719, 743, 761, 809, 911, 953, ... 

Hence, the first few safe primes are

:5, 7, 11, 23, 47, 59, 83, 107, 167, 179, 227, 263, 347, 359, 383, 467, 479, 503, 563, 587, 719, 839, 863, 887, 983, 1019, 1187, 1283, 1307, 1319, 1367, 1439, 1487, 1523, 1619, 1823, 1907, ... 

In cryptography much larger Sophie Germain primes like 1,846,389,521,368 + 11600 are required.

Two distributed computing projects, PrimeGrid and Twin Prime Search, include searches for large Sophie Germain primes. Some of the largest known Sophie Germain primes are given in the following table.
On 2 Dec 2019, Fabrice Boudot, Pierrick Gaudry, Aurore Guillevic, Nadia Heninger, Emmanuel Thomé, and Paul Zimmermann announced the computation of a discrete logarithm modulo the 240-digit (795 bit) prime RSA-240 + 49204 (the first safe prime above RSA-240) using a number field sieve algorithm; see Discrete logarithm records.

==Properties==
There is no special primality test for safe primes the way there is for Fermat primes and Mersenne primes. However, Pocklington&#x27;s criterion can be used to prove the primality of 2&quot;p&quot; + 1 once one has proven the primality of &quot;p&quot;. 

Just as every term except the last one of a Cunningham chain of the first kind is a Sophie Germain prime, so every term except the first of such a chain is a safe prime. Safe primes ending in 7, that is, of the form 10&quot;n&quot; + 7, are the last terms in such chains when they occur, since 2(10&quot;n&quot; + 7) + 1 = 20&quot;n&quot; + 15 is divisible by 5.

For a safe prime, every quadratic nonresidue, except -1 (if nonresidue), is a primitive root. It follows that for a safe prime, the least positive primitive root is a prime number.

===Modular restrictions===
With the exception of 7, a safe prime &quot;q&quot; is of the form 6&quot;k&quot; − 1 or, equivalently, &quot;q&quot; ≡ 5 (mod 6) – as is &quot;p&quot; &gt; 3. Similarly, with the exception of 5, a safe prime &quot;q&quot; is of the form 4&quot;k&quot; − 1 or, equivalently, &quot;q&quot; ≡ 3 (mod 4) — trivially true since (&quot;q&quot; − 1) / 2 must evaluate to an odd natural number. Combining both forms using lcm(6, 4) we determine that a safe prime &quot;q&quot; &gt; 7 also must be of the form 12&quot;k&quot; − 1 or, equivalently, &quot;q&quot; ≡ 11 (mod 12).

It follows that, for any safe prime &quot;q&quot; &gt; 7:
* both 3 and 12 are quadratic residues mod &quot;q&quot; (per law of quadratic reciprocity) 
** neither 3 nor 12 is a primitive root of &quot;q&quot;
** the only safe primes that are also full reptend primes in base 12 are 5 and 7
** &quot;q&quot; divides 3(&quot;q&quot;−1)/2 − 1 and 12(&quot;q&quot;−1)/2 − 1, same as 3(&quot;q&quot;−1)/2 ≡ 1 mod &quot;q&quot; and 12(&quot;q&quot;−1)/2 ≡ 1 mod &quot;q&quot; (per Euler&#x27;s criterion)
* &quot;q&quot;-3, &quot;q&quot;-4, &quot;q&quot;-9, &quot;q&quot;-12 are quadratic nonresidues 
** &quot;q&quot;-3, &quot;q&quot;-4, &quot;q&quot;-9, and, for &quot;q&quot; &gt; 11, &quot;q&quot;-12 are primitive roots 

If &quot;p&quot; is a Sophie Germain prime greater than 3, then &quot;p&quot; must be congruent to 2 mod 3. For, if not, it would be congruent to 1 mod 3 and 2&quot;p&quot; + 1 would be congruent to 3 mod 3, impossible for a prime number. Similar restrictions hold for larger prime moduli, and are the basis for the choice of the &quot;correction factor&quot; 2&quot;C&quot; in the Hardy–Littlewood estimate on the density of the Sophie Germain primes.

If a Sophie Germain prime &quot;p&quot; is congruent to 3 (mod 4) (, &quot;Lucasian primes&quot;), then its matching safe prime 2&quot;p&quot; + 1 (congruent to 7 modulo 8) will be a divisor of the Mersenne number 2&quot;p&quot; − 1. Historically, this result of Leonhard Euler was the first known criterion for a Mersenne number with a prime index to be composite. It can be used to generate the largest Mersenne numbers (with prime indices) that are known to be composite.

==Infinitude and density==

It is conjectured that there are infinitely many Sophie Germain primes, but this has not been proven. Several other famous conjectures in number theory generalize this and the twin prime conjecture; they include the Dickson&#x27;s conjecture, Schinzel&#x27;s hypothesis H, and the Bateman–Horn conjecture.

A heuristic estimate for the number of Sophie Germain primes less than &quot;n&quot; is
:formula_3
where
:formula_4
is Hardy–Littlewood&#x27;s twin prime constant. For &quot;n&quot; = 104, this estimate predicts 156 Sophie Germain primes, which has a 20% error compared to the exact value of 190. For &quot;n&quot; = 107, the estimate predicts 50822, which is still 10% off from the exact value of 56032. The form of this estimate is due to G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood, who applied a similar estimate to twin primes.

A sequence (&quot;p&quot;, 2&quot;p&quot; + 1, 2(2&quot;p&quot; + 1) + 1, ...) in which all of the numbers are prime is called a Cunningham chain of the first kind. Every term of such a sequence except the last is a Sophie Germain prime, and every term except the first is a safe prime. Extending the conjecture that there exist infinitely many Sophie Germain primes, it has also been conjectured that arbitrarily long Cunningham chains exist, although infinite chains are known to be impossible.

==Strong primes==
A prime number &quot;q&quot; is a strong prime if and both have some large (around 500 digits) prime factors. For a safe prime , the number naturally has a large prime factor, namely &quot;p&quot;, and so a safe prime &quot;q&quot; meets part of the criteria for being a strong prime. The running times of some methods of factoring a number with &quot;q&quot; as a prime factor depend partly on the size of the prime factors of . This is true, for instance, of the &quot;p&quot; − 1 method.

==Applications==

===Cryptography===
Safe primes are also important in cryptography because of their use in discrete logarithm-based techniques like Diffie–Hellman key exchange. If is a safe prime, the multiplicative group of integers modulo has a subgroup of large prime order. It is usually this prime-order subgroup that is desirable, and the reason for using safe primes is so that the modulus is as small as possible relative to &quot;p&quot;. 

A prime number &quot;p&quot; = 2&quot;q&quot; + 1 is called a &quot;safe prime&quot; if &quot;q&quot; is prime. Thus, &quot;p&quot; = 2&quot;q&quot; + 1 is a safe prime if and only if &quot;q&quot; is a Sophie Germain prime, so finding safe primes and finding Sophie Germain primes are equivalent in computational difficulty. The notion of a safe prime can be strengthened to a strong prime, for which both &quot;p&quot; − 1 and &quot;p&quot; + 1 have large prime factors. Safe and strong primes were useful as the factors of secret keys in the RSA cryptosystem, because they prevent the system being broken by some factorization algorithms such as Pollard&#x27;s &quot;p&quot; − 1 algorithm. However, with the current factorization technology, the advantage of using safe and strong primes appears to be negligible.

Similar issues apply in other cryptosystems as well, including Diffie–Hellman key exchange and similar systems that depend on the security of the discrete logarithm problem rather than on integer factorization. For this reason, key generation protocols for these methods often rely on efficient algorithms for generating strong primes, which in turn rely on the conjecture that these primes have a sufficiently high density.

In Sophie Germain Counter Mode, it was proposed to use the arithmetic in the finite field of order equal to the safe prime 2128 + 12451, to counter weaknesses in Galois/Counter Mode using the binary finite field GF(2128). However, SGCM has been shown to be vulnerable to many of the same cryptographic attacks as GCM.

===Primality testing===
In the first version of the AKS primality test paper, a conjecture about Sophie Germain primes is used to lower the worst-case complexity from to . A later version of the paper is shown to have time complexity which can also be lowered to using the conjecture. Later variants of AKS have been proven to have complexity of without any conjectures or use of Sophie Germain primes.

===Pseudorandom number generation===
Safe primes obeying certain congruences can be used to generate pseudo-random numbers of use in Monte Carlo simulation.

Similarly, Sophie Germain primes may be used in the generation of pseudo-random numbers. The decimal expansion of 1/&quot;q&quot; will produce a stream of &quot;q&quot; − 1 pseudo-random digits, if &quot;q&quot; is the safe prime of a Sophie Germain prime &quot;p&quot;, with &quot;p&quot; congruent to 3, 9, or 11 modulo 20. Thus &quot;suitable&quot; prime numbers &quot;q&quot; are 7, 23, 47, 59, 167, 179, etc. () (corresponding to &quot;p&quot; = 3, 11, 23, 29, 83, 89, etc.) (). The result is a stream of length &quot;q&quot; − 1 digits (including leading zeros). So, for example, using &quot;q&quot; = 23 generates the pseudo-random digits 0, 4, 3, 4, 7, 8, 2, 6, 0, 8, 6, 9, 5, 6, 5, 2, 1, 7, 3, 9, 1, 3. Note that these digits are not appropriate for cryptographic purposes, as the value of each can be derived from its predecessor in the digit-stream.

==In popular culture==
Sophie Germain primes are mentioned in the stage play &quot;Proof&quot; and the subsequent film.

<text>In mathematics, a curve (also called a curved line in older texts) is an object similar to a line, but that does not have to be straight.

Intuitively, a curve may be thought of as the trace left by a moving point. This is the definition that appeared more than 2000 years ago in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;: &quot;The [curved] line is […] the first species of quantity, which has only one dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which […] will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length, exempt of any width.&quot;

This definition of a curve has been formalized in modern mathematics as: &quot;A curve is the image of an interval to a topological space by a continuous function&quot;. In some contexts, the function that defines the curve is called a &quot;parametrization&quot;, and the curve is a parametric curve. In this article, these curves are sometimes called &quot;topological curves&quot; to distinguish them from more constrained curves such as differentiable curves. This definition encompasses most curves that are studied in mathematics; notable exceptions are level curves (which are unions of curves and isolated points), and algebraic curves (see below). Level curves and algebraic curves are sometimes called implicit curves, since they are generally defined by implicit equations.

Nevertheless, the class of topological curves is very broad, and contains some curves that do not look as one may expect for a curve, or even cannot be drawn. This is the case of space-filling curves and fractal curves. For ensuring more regularity, the function that defines a curve is often supposed to be differentiable, and the curve is then said to be a differentiable curve.

A plane algebraic curve is the zero set of a polynomial in two indeterminates. More generally, an algebraic curve is the zero set of a finite set of polynomials, which satisfies the further condition of being an algebraic variety of dimension one. If the coefficients of the polynomials belong to a field , the curve is said to be &quot;defined over&quot; . In the common case of a real algebraic curve, where is the field of real numbers, an algebraic curve is a finite union of topological curves. When complex zeros are considered, one has a &quot;complex algebraic curve&quot;, which, from the topological point of view, is not a curve, but a surface, and is often called a Riemann surface. Although not being curves in the common sense, algebraic curves defined over other fields have been widely studied. In particular, algebraic curves over a finite field are widely used in modern cryptography.

==History==

Interest in curves began long before they were the subject of mathematical study. This can be seen in numerous examples of their decorative use in art and on everyday objects dating back to prehistoric
times. Curves, or at least their graphical representations, are simple to create, for example with a stick on the sand on a beach.

Historically, the term was used in place of the more modern term . Hence the terms and were used to distinguish what are today called lines from curved lines. For example, in Book I of Euclid&#x27;s Elements, a line is defined as a &quot;breadthless length&quot; (Def. 2), while a line is defined as &quot;a line that lies evenly with the points on itself&quot; (Def. 4). Euclid&#x27;s idea of a line is perhaps clarified by the statement &quot;The extremities of a line are points,&quot; (Def. 3). Later commentators further classified lines according to various schemes. For example:
*Composite lines (lines forming an angle)
*Incomposite lines
**Determinate (lines that do not extend indefinitely, such as the circle)
**Indeterminate (lines that extend indefinitely, such as the straight line and the parabola)
The Greek geometers had studied many other kinds of curves. One reason was their interest in solving geometrical problems that could not be solved using standard compass and straightedge construction.
These curves include:
*The conic sections, studied in depth by Apollonius of Perga
*The cissoid of Diocles, studied by Diocles and used as a method to double the cube.
*The conchoid of Nicomedes, studied by Nicomedes as a method to both double the cube and to trisect an angle.
*The Archimedean spiral, studied by Archimedes as a method to trisect an angle and square the circle.
*The spiric sections, sections of tori studied by Perseus as sections of cones had been studied by Apollonius.
A fundamental advance in the theory of curves was the introduction of analytic geometry by René Descartes in the seventeenth century. This enabled a curve to be described using an equation rather than an elaborate geometrical construction. This not only allowed new curves to be defined and studied, but it enabled a formal distinction to be made between algebraic curves that can be defined using polynomial equations, and transcendental curves that cannot. Previously, curves had been described as &quot;geometrical&quot; or &quot;mechanical&quot; according to how they were, or supposedly could be, generated.

Conic sections were applied in astronomy by Kepler.
Newton also worked on an early example in the calculus of variations. Solutions to variational problems, such as the brachistochrone and tautochrone questions, introduced properties of curves in new ways (in this case, the cycloid). The catenary gets its name as the solution to the problem of a hanging chain, the sort of question that became routinely accessible by means of differential calculus.

In the eighteenth century came the beginnings of the theory of plane algebraic curves, in general. Newton had studied the cubic curves, in the general description of the real points into &#x27;ovals&#x27;. The statement of Bézout&#x27;s theorem showed a number of aspects which were not directly accessible to the geometry of the time, to do with singular points and complex solutions.

Since the nineteenth century, curve theory is viewed as the special case of dimension one of the theory of manifolds and algebraic varieties. Nevertheless, many questions remain specific to curves, such as space-filling curves, Jordan curve theorem and Hilbert&#x27;s sixteenth problem.

==Topological curve==
A topological curve can be specified by a continuous function formula_1 from an interval of the real numbers into a topological space . Properly speaking, the &quot;curve&quot; is the image of formula_2 However, in some contexts, formula_3 itself is called a curve, especially when the image does not look like what is generally called a curve and does not characterize sufficiently formula_2

For example, the image of the Peano curve or, more generally, a space-filling curve completely fills a square, and therefore does not give any information on how formula_3 is defined.

A curve formula_3 is closed or is a &quot;loop&quot; if formula_7 and formula_8. A closed curve is thus the image of a continuous mapping of a circle. A non-closed curve may also be called an open curve.

If the domain of a topological curve is a closed and bounded interval formula_7, the curve is called a &quot;path&quot;, also known as &quot;topological arc&quot; (or just ).

A curve is simple if it is the image of an interval or a circle by an injective continuous function. In other words, if a curve is defined by a continuous function formula_3 with an interval as a domain, the curve is simple if and only if any two different points of the interval have different images, except, possibly, if the points are the endpoints of the interval. Intuitively, a simple curve is a curve that &quot;does not cross itself and has no missing points&quot; (a continuous non-self-intersecting curve).

A &quot;plane curve&quot; is a curve for which formula_11 is the Euclidean plane—these are the examples first encountered—or in some cases the projective plane. A &#x27; is a curve for which formula_11 is at least three-dimensional; a &#x27; is a space curve which lies in no plane. These definitions of plane, space and skew curves apply also to real algebraic curves, although the above definition of a curve does not apply (a real algebraic curve may be disconnected).
A plane simple closed curve is also called a Jordan curve. It is also defined as a non-self-intersecting continuous loop in the plane. The Jordan curve theorem states that the set complement in a plane of a Jordan curve consists of two connected components (that is the curve divides the plane in two non-intersecting regions that are both connected). The bounded region inside a Jordan curve is known as Jordan domain. 

The definition of a curve includes figures that can hardly be called curves in common usage. For example, the image of a curve can cover a square in the plane (space-filling curve), and a simple curve may have a positive area. Fractal curves can have properties that are strange for the common sense. For example, a fractal curve can have a Hausdorff dimension bigger than one (see Koch snowflake) and even a positive area. An example is the dragon curve, which has many other unusual properties.

==Differentiable curve==

Roughly speaking a is a curve that is defined as being locally the image of an injective differentiable function formula_1 from an interval of the real numbers into a differentiable manifold , often formula_14

More precisely, a differentiable curve is a subset of where every point of has a neighborhood such that formula_15 is diffeomorphic to an interval of the real numbers. In other words, a differentiable curve is a differentiable manifold of dimension one.

===Differentiable arc===
In Euclidean geometry, an arc (symbol: ⌒) is a connected subset of a differentiable curve. 

Arcs of lines are called segments, rays, or lines, depending on how they are bounded.

A common curved example is an arc of a circle, called a circular arc. 

In a sphere (or a spheroid), an arc of a great circle (or a great ellipse) is called a great arc.

===Length of a curve===

If formula_16 is the formula_17-dimensional Euclidean space, and if formula_18 is an injective and continuously differentiable function, then the length of formula_19 is defined as the quantity
:formula_20
The length of a curve is independent of the parametrization formula_19.

In particular, the length formula_22 of the graph of a continuously differentiable function formula_23 defined on a closed interval formula_24 is
:formula_25
which can be thought of intuitively as using the Pythagorean theorem at the infinitesimal scale continuously over the full length of the curve.

More generally, if formula_26 is a metric space with metric formula_27, then we can define the length of a curve formula_28 by
:formula_29
where the supremum is taken over all formula_30 and all partitions formula_31 of formula_32.

A rectifiable curve is a curve with length. A curve formula_28 is called (or unit-speed or parametrized by arc length) if for any formula_34 such that formula_35, we have
:formula_36

If formula_28 is a Lipschitz-continuous function, then it is automatically rectifiable. Moreover, in this case, one can define the speed (or metric derivative) of formula_19 at formula_39 as
:formula_40
and then show that
:formula_41

===Differential geometry===

While the first examples of curves that are met are mostly plane curves (that is, in everyday words, &quot;curved lines&quot; in &quot;two-dimensional space&quot;), there are obvious examples such as the helix which exist naturally in three dimensions. The needs of geometry, and also for example classical mechanics are to have a notion of curve in space of any number of dimensions. In general relativity, a world line is a curve in spacetime.

If formula_11 is a differentiable manifold, then we can define the notion of &quot;differentiable curve&quot; in formula_11. This general idea is enough to cover many of the applications of curves in mathematics. From a local point of view one can take formula_11 to be Euclidean space. On the other hand, it is useful to be more general, in that (for example) it is possible to define the tangent vectors to formula_11 by means of this notion of curve.

If formula_11 is a smooth manifold, a &quot;smooth curve&quot; in formula_11 is a smooth map

:formula_1.

This is a basic notion. There are less and more restricted ideas, too. If formula_11 is a formula_50 manifold (i.e., a manifold whose charts are formula_51 times continuously differentiable), then a formula_50 curve in formula_11 is such a curve which is only assumed to be formula_50 (i.e. formula_51 times continuously differentiable). If formula_11 is an analytic manifold (i.e. infinitely differentiable and charts are expressible as power series), and formula_3 is an analytic map, then formula_3 is said to be an &quot;analytic curve&quot;.

A differentiable curve is said to be if its derivative never vanishes. (In words, a regular curve never slows to a stop or backtracks on itself.) Two formula_50 differentiable curves

:formula_60 and

:formula_61

are said to be &quot;equivalent&quot; if there is a bijective formula_50 map

:formula_63

such that the inverse map

:formula_64

is also formula_50, and

:formula_66

for all formula_67. The map formula_68 is called a &quot;reparametrization&quot; of formula_69; and this makes an equivalence relation on the set of all formula_50 differentiable curves in formula_11. A formula_50 &quot;arc&quot; is an equivalence class of formula_50 curves under the relation of reparametrization.

==Algebraic curve==

Algebraic curves are the curves considered in algebraic geometry. A plane algebraic curve is the set of the points of coordinates such that , where is a polynomial in two variables defined over some field . One says that the curve is &quot;defined over&quot; . Algebraic geometry normally considers not only points with coordinates in but all the points with coordinates in an algebraically closed field . 

If &quot;C&quot; is a curve defined by a polynomial &quot;f&quot; with coefficients in &quot;F&quot;, the curve is said to be defined over &quot;F&quot;. 

In the case of a curve defined over the real numbers, one normally considers points with complex coordinates. In this case, a point with real coordinates is a &quot;real point&quot;, and the set of all real points is the &quot;real part&quot; of the curve. It is therefore only the real part of an algebraic curve that can be a topological curve (this is not always the case, as the real part of an algebraic curve may be disconnected and contain isolated points). The whole curve, that is the set of its complex point is, from the topological point of view a surface. In particular, the nonsingular complex projective algebraic curves are called Riemann surfaces.

The points of a curve with coordinates in a field are said to be rational over and can be denoted . When is the field of the rational numbers, one simply talks of &quot;rational points&quot;. For example, Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem may be restated as: &quot;For&quot; , &quot;every rational point of the Fermat curve of degree has a zero coordinate&quot;.

Algebraic curves can also be space curves, or curves in a space of higher dimension, say . They are defined as algebraic varieties of dimension one. They may be obtained as the common solutions of at least polynomial equations in variables. If polynomials are sufficient to define a curve in a space of dimension , the curve is said to be a complete intersection. By eliminating variables (by any tool of elimination theory), an algebraic curve may be projected onto a plane algebraic curve, which however may introduce new singularities such as cusps or double points.

A plane curve may also be completed to a curve in the projective plane: if a curve is defined by a polynomial of total degree , then simplifies to a homogeneous polynomial of degree . The values of such that are the homogeneous coordinates of the points of the completion of the curve in the projective plane and the points of the initial curve are those such that is not zero. An example is the Fermat curve , which has an affine form . A similar process of homogenization may be defined for curves in higher dimensional spaces.

Except for lines, the simplest examples of algebraic curves are the conics, which are nonsingular curves of degree two and genus zero. Elliptic curves, which are nonsingular curves of genus one, are studied in number theory, and have important applications to cryptography.
