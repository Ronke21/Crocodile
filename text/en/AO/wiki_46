<text>Marassa Jumeaux are the divine twins in Vodou. They are children, but more ancient than any other loa. &quot;Love, truth and justice. Directed by reason. Mysteries of liaison between earth and heaven and they personify astronomic-astrological learning. They synthesize the vodou Loa as personification of divine power and the human impotence. Double life, they have considerable power which allow them manage people through the stomach. They are children mysteries.&quot;

The Marassa are somewhat different from standard Loa, both on a level above them, and counted in their number, they are both twins, and yet they number three, they are male and female, and both male and both female - an example of the Haitian worldview&#x27;s capacity to retain two seemingly contradictory concepts. In some houses they are not channelled through possession in Vodou ritual, but served first after Legba. 

The Marassa are commonly syncretised with the Catholic Saints Cosmas and Damian.

<text>Marinette is a loa of power and violence in Haitian Vodou. In her petro form, she is called &quot;Marinette Bras Cheche&quot; (Marinette of the Dry Arms) or &quot;Marinette Pied Cheche&quot; (Marinette of the Dry Feet), suggesting that she is skeletal. 

She is believed to be the mambo who sacrificed the black pig at the culmination of the start of the first Haitian Revolution. While she is feared and tends to ride those she possesses violently, she can also be seen as one who frees her people from bondage.

Marinette is represented by a screech owl and is often seen as the protector of werewolves. Her Catholic counterpart is the Anima Sola (Forsaken Soul) who can either free one from bondage or drag you back. Her colors are black and deep blood red. Her offerings are black pigs and black roosters plucked alive.

Marinette is not cruel. She only gets cruel in possession, when people burn animals or humans. She likes salvia, black pepper, lavender, and sweets.

<text>Mombu is a loa who stutters and causes heavy rains in Voodoo.

==Appearance==
Mombu is known to wear a red and white kerchief, and her favorite colors include red and black. She can be found in springs, her favorite food is goat meat, and her favorite drinks are rum and wine.

==Legend==
Mombu is featured in a story about the consequences of annoying a loa. In the story a female servant of Mombu names her daughter Mombu Sapotille after the loa. Mombu was unhappy with this and ordered the woman to change the child&#x27;s name, but she refused. When the daughter was seven years old, she went to get water one day and never returned. The father was a houngan, and he consulted his candle on whether the girl could be returned by performing a ceremony to appease Mombu. He learned that the child would be held prisoner under the water for seven years. Seven years later, after the father died, the mother looked outside to see a strange young woman. The woman seemed to be mute, but after a glass of water and a short time, the woman revealed herself to be the daughter.

<text>A pie is a baked dish which is usually made of a pastry dough casing that contains a filling of various sweet or savoury ingredients. Sweet pies may be filled with fruit (as in an apple pie), nuts (pecan pie), fruit preserves (jam tart), brown sugar (sugar pie), sweetened vegetables (rhubarb pie), or with thicker fillings based on eggs and dairy (as in custard pie and cream pie). Savoury pies may be filled with meat (as in a steak pie or a Jamaican patty), eggs and cheese (such as quiches or British flans) or a mixture of meat and vegetables (pot pie).

Pies are defined by their crusts. A &quot;filled&quot; pie (also &quot;single-crust&quot; or &quot;bottom-crust&quot;), has pastry lining the baking dish, and the filling is placed on top of the pastry but left open. A &quot;top-crust&quot; pie has the filling in the bottom of the dish and is covered with a pastry or other covering before baking. A &quot;two-crust&quot; pie has the filling completely enclosed in the pastry shell. Shortcrust pastry is a typical kind of pastry used for pie crusts, but many things can be used, including baking powder biscuits, mashed potatoes, and crumbs.

Pies can be a variety of sizes, ranging from bite-size to those designed for multiple servings.

==Etymology==
The first known use of the word &#x27;pie&#x27; appears in 1303 in the expense accounts of the Bolton Priory in Yorkshire. However, the Oxford English Dictionary is uncertain to its origin and says &#x27;no further related word is known outside English&#x27;. A possible origin is that the word &#x27;pie&#x27; is connected with a word used in farming to indicate &#x27;a collection of things made into a heap&#x27;, for example a heap of potatoes covered with earth. 

One source of the word &quot;pie&quot; may be the magpie, a &quot;bird known for collecting odds and ends in its nest&quot;; the connection could be that Medieval pies also contained many different animal meats, including chickens, crows, pigeons and rabbits. One 1450 recipe for “grete pyes” that might support the &quot;magpie&quot; etymology contained what Charles Perry called &quot;odds and ends&quot;, including: &quot;...beef, beef suet, capons, hens, both mallard and teal ducks, rabbits, woodcocks and large birds such as herons and storks, plus beef marrow, hard-cooked egg yolks, dates, raisins and prunes.&quot;

==History==
===Antiquity===
Early pies were in the form of flat, round or freeform crusty cakes called galettes consisting of a crust of ground oats, wheat, rye, or barley containing honey inside. These galettes developed into a form of early sweet pastry or desserts, evidence of which can be found on the tomb walls of the Pharaoh Ramesses II, who ruled from 1304 to 1237 BC, located in the Valley of the Kings. Sometime before 2000 BC, a recipe for chicken pie was written on a tablet in Sumer.

In the plays of Aristophanes (5th century BC), there are mentions of sweetmeats including small pastries filled with fruit. Nothing is known of the actual pastry used.

The Romans made a plain pastry of flour, oil, and water to cover meats and fowls which were baked, thus keeping in the juices. The Roman approach of covering &quot;...birds or hams with dough&quot; has been called more of an attempt to prevent the meat from drying out during baking than an actual pie in the modern sense. The covering was not meant to be eaten. It filled the role of what was later called puff paste. A richer pastry, intended to be eaten, was used to make small pasties containing eggs or little birds which were among the minor items served at banquets. The first written reference to a Roman pie is for a rye dough that was filled with a mixture of goat&#x27;s cheese and honey.

The 1st-century Roman cookbook &quot;Apicius&quot; makes various mentions of recipes which involve a pie case. By 160 BC, Roman statesman Marcus Porcius Cato (234–149 BC), who wrote &quot;De Agri Cultura&quot;, notes the recipe for the most popular pie/cake called &quot;placenta&quot;. Also called &quot;libum&quot; by the Romans, it was more like a modern-day cheesecake on a pastry base, often used as an offering to the gods. With the development of the Roman Empire and its efficient road transport, pie cooking spread throughout Europe. Wealthy Romans combined many types of meats in their pies, including mussels and other seafood. Roman pie makers generally used vegetable oils, such as olive oil, to make their dough.

===Medieval era===
In the Medieval era, pies were usually savoury meat pies made with &quot;...beef, lamb, wild duck, magpie pigeon -- spiced with pepper, currants or dates&quot;. Medieval cooks had restricted access to ovens due to their costs of construction and need for abundant supplies of fuel. Since pies could be easily cooked over an open fire, this made pies easier for most cooks to make. At the same time, by partnering with a baker, a cook could focus on preparing the filling.

The earliest pie doughs were probably an inedible, stiff mixture of rye flour and water. The earliest pie recipes refer to &quot;coffyns&quot; (the word actually used for a basket or box), with straight sealed sides and a top; open-top pies were called &quot;traps&quot;. Until the mid-16th century this British pie dough known as &quot;cofyn&quot; was used as a baking dish. These pies were meant to be eaten with the hands. The hardened coffyn pastry was not necessarily eaten, its function being to contain the filling for baking, and to extend its shelf-life. The thick crust was so sturdy it had to be cracked open to get to the filling. This may also be the reason why early recipes focus on the filling over the surrounding case, with this development leading to the use of reusable earthenware pie cases which reduced the use of expensive flour. Ceramic pie dishes were not used until the 16th century. Medieval pie crusts were often baked first, to create a &quot;pot&quot; of baked dough with a removable top crust, hence the name &quot;pot pie&quot;.

The first unequivocal reference to pie in a written source is in the 14th century (&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; sb &quot;pie&quot;). The eating of mince pies during festive periods is a tradition that dates back to the 13th century, as the returning Crusaders brought pie recipes containing &quot;meats, fruits and spices&quot;. Some pies contained cooked rabbits, frogs, crows, and pigeons. 

In 1390, the English cookbook &quot;A Forme of Cury&quot; had a recipe for “tartes of flesh”, which included a ground-up mixture of &quot;pork, hard-boiled eggs, and cheese&quot; blended with &quot;spices, saffron, and sugar&quot;. The &quot;cofyn&quot; dough for the 14th-century apple pie recipe from &quot;The Forme of Cury&quot; was probably a simple mix of water and whatever flour was available in late middle ages. The recipe included spices, apples, raisins pears and figs. The 14th-century French chef Taillevent instructed bakers to &quot;crenelate&quot; pie shells and &quot;reinforce them so that they can support the meat&quot;; one of his pies was high enough that it resembled a model of a castle, an illusion enhanced by miniature banners for the nobles at the event.

Pies in the 15th century included birds, as song birds at the time were a delicacy and protected by Royal Law. At the coronation of eight-year-old English King Henry VI (1422–1461) in 1429, &quot;Partrich&quot; and &quot;Pecok enhakill&quot; were served, alleged by some modern writers to consist of cooked peacock mounted in its skin on a peacock-filled pie. The expressions &quot;eat crow&quot; and &quot;four and 20 blackbirds&quot; are sayings from the era when crow and blackbirds were eaten in pies. Cooked birds were frequently placed by European royal cooks on top of a large pie to identify its contents, leading to its later adaptation in pre-Victorian times as a porcelain ornament to release of steam. The apple pie was first referenced in writing in 1589, when the poet R. Green wrote &quot;Thy breath is like the seeme of apple pies&quot;.

Medieval England had an early form of sweet pies called tarts and fruit pies were unsweetened, because sugar was a rare and costly status symbol. In the Middle Ages, a pie could have several items as its filling, but a pastry would have only a single filling.

===15th to 17th centuries===
Until the start of the 15th century, most pies were expected to contain meat or fish. In the 15th century, more custard and fruit pie recipes began appearing, often with apples and figs and dried fruit like dates and raisins. Fresh fruit did not become widely used until sugar dropped in price during the 16th century. The first cherry pie is recorded in the late 16th century, when Queen Elizabeth I was served cherry pie. Elizabeth was often given gifts of quince or pear pies for New Year. 

During the Shakespearean era, fruit pies were served hot, but others were served at room temperature, as they would be brought to the &quot;...table more than once&quot;. Apple pies were popular in Tudor and Stuart times. Pippins were baked with cloves, cinnamon, dates and candied orange peels. Rosewater was often added to apple pies.

During the Puritan era of Oliver Cromwell, some sources claim mince pie eating was banned as a frivolous activity for 16 years, so mince pie making and eating became an underground activity; the ban was lifted in 1660, with the Restoration of the monarchy. Food historian Annie Gray suggests that the myth of the Puritans &quot;actively&quot; banning mince pies came about &quot;due to the defenders of Christmas&quot; who reported Puritan vitriol &quot;with a certain amount of exaggeration&quot;. 

It was in the 16th century that a puff paste began to be used to make flakier pie crusts. In Gervase Markham&#x27;s 1615 book &quot;The English Huswife&quot;, there is a recipe for puff paste where the paste is kneaded, rolled thinly many times while layering with butter. This made a flaky butter pastry to cover meat for pies or for tarts. There is also a pie recipe that calls for &quot;an entire leg of mutton and three pounds of suet..., along with salt, cloves, mace, currants, raisins, prunes, dates, and orange peel&quot;, which made a huge pie that could serve a large group. According to Markham, crusts made with fine wheat flour required the addition of eggs to be sturdy enough for raised pies.

In the 17th century, Ben Jonson described a skilled pie cook by comparing the cook to a fortification builder who &quot;...Makes citadels of curious fowl and fish&quot; and makes &quot;dry-ditches&quot;, &quot;bulwark pies&quot; and &quot;ramparts of immortal crusts&quot;.

===18th century===
In the Georgian era, sweetened pies of meat and dried fruits began to become less popular. In recipe books of the period sweet veal, sweet lamb or sweet chicken pies are given alongside recipes for unsweetened alternatives with the same ingredients made for those who could &quot;no longer stomach the sweetened flesh meats enjoyed by earlier generations&quot;.

Pumpkin pie was fashionable in England from the 1650s onward, then fell out of favour during the 18th century. Pumpkin was sliced, fried with sweet herbs sweetened with sugar and eggs were added. This was put into a pastry case with currants and apples. Pumpkin pie was introduced to America by early colonists where it became a national dish.

===19th century===
During the 19th century, pies became, according to food historian Janet Clarkson, &quot;universally esteemed&quot; in a way that other foods were not. In 1806 Mrs Rundell in her Observations on Savoury Pies in A New System of Domestic Cookery stated that &#x27;There are few articles of cookery more generally liked than relishing pies, if properly made&#x27;. Alexis Soyer, a celebrity cook of the 19th century said in his book &quot;Shilling Cookery for the People&quot; (1860) &quot;From childhood we eat pies - from girlhood to boyhood we eat pies - in fact, pies in England may be considered as one of our best companions du voyage through life. It is we who leave them behind, not they who leave us; for our children and grandchildren will be as fond of pies as we have been; therefore it is needful that we should learn how to make them, and make them well! Believe me, I am not jesting, but if all the spoilt pies made in London on one single Sunday were to be exhibited in a row beside a railway line, it would take above an hour by special train to pass in review these culinary victims&quot;.

===United States (17th century-1980s)===
The Pilgrims brought the pie recipes they knew from their home countries with them when they arrived to the colonies. Colonists appreciated the food preservation aspect of crusty-topped pies, which were often seasoned with &quot;dried fruit, cinnamon, pepper and nutmeg&quot;. Their first pies included pies that were based on berries and fruits pointed out to them by the Native North Americans. 

According to James E. McWilliams, American cooks &quot;embraced the rough edges of American foodways to foster a pastoral ideal that promoted the frontier values that the colonists had once downplayed&quot;. Apple pie became popular, because apples were easy to dry and store in barrels over the winter.

Pie fillings could be made with very few ingredients to &quot;stretch&quot; their &quot;meager provisions&quot;. These pies later came to be known as desperation pies. First originating in the 18th century they included pies like sugar cream pie and Kentucky transparent pie. By the 19th century pies were a staple of the American family meal and women were responsible for figuring out how to make tasty pies that fit within the family budget.

Once the British had established Caribbean colonies, sugar became less expensive and more widely available, which meant that sweet pies could be readily made. Molasses was popular in American pies due to the rum and slave trade with the Caribbean Islands, and maple syrup was an important sweetener in Northern states, after Indigenous people taught settlers how to tap maple trees and boil down the sap. In the Midwest, cheese and cream pies were popular, due to the availability of big dairy farms. In the US south, African-Americans enjoyed sweet potato pies, due to the widespread availability of this type of potato.

By the 1870s, the new science of nutrition led to criticism of pies, notably by Sarah Tyson Rorer, a cooking teacher and food editor who warned the public about how much energy pies take to digest. Rorer stated that all pie crusts &quot;...are to be condemned&quot; and her cookbook only included an apple tart, jelly and meringue-covered crackers, pâté, and a &quot;hygienic pie&quot; which had &quot;apple slices or a pumpkin custard baked in biscuit dough&quot;. In 1866, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; included an article by C.W. Gesner that stated that although we &quot;...cry for pie when we are infants&quot;, &quot;Pie kills us finally&quot;, as the &quot;heavy crust&quot; cannot be digested.

Another factor that decreased the popularity of pies was industrialization and increasing movement of women into the labour market, which changed pie making from a weekly ritual to an &quot;occasional undertaking&quot; on special occasions. In the 1950s, after WWII, the popularity of pies rebounded in the US, especially with commercial food inventions such as instant pudding mixes, Cool Whip topping, and Jello gelatin (which could be used as fillings) ready-made crusts, which were sold frozen, and alternative crusts made with crushed potato chips. There was a pie renaissance in the 1980s, when old-fashioned pie recipes were rediscovered and a wide range of cross-cultural pies were explored.

==Regional variations==
Meat pies with fillings such as steak, cheese, steak and kidney, beef and ale, lamb and mint, minced beef, or chicken and mushroom are popular in the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand as take-away snacks. They are also served with chips as an alternative to fish and chips at British chip shops.

Pot pies with a flaky crust and bottom are also a popular dish, typically with a filling of meat (particularly beef, chicken, or turkey), gravy, and mixed vegetables (potatoes, carrots, and peas). Frozen pot pies are often sold in individual serving size.

Fruit pies may be served with a scoop of ice cream, a style known in North America as pie à la mode. Many sweet pies are served this way. Apple pie is a traditional choice, though any pie with sweet fillings may be served &quot;à la mode&quot;. This combination, and possibly the name as well, is thought to have been popularized in the mid-1890s in the United States. Apple pie can be made with a variety of apples; cultivars such as the Golden Delicious, Pink Lady, Granny Smith, and Rome Beauty are popular for usage in pies.

==In literature==
Cold pigeon pies and venison pasties appear in novels by Jane Austen, but also more generally in writing in the 18th century. The character Mrs Elton, from the 1815 novel &quot;Emma&quot;, believes herself to be modern, but nevertheless plans to take &#x27;pigeon-pies and cold lamb&#x27; to a country outing to Box Hill and consults George Turberville&#x27;s 1575 work &quot;The Noble Art of Venerie&quot; (1575) for advice.

In the 1817 novel &quot;Persuasion&quot;, Jane Austen includes pies in her description of an old-fashioned Christmas spread, mentioning &#x27;tressels and trays, bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies&#x27;. In the whole of &quot;Persuasion&quot;, brawn and cold pies are the only specific mention of food; they are also the only Christmas foods to be mentioned in any of Jane Austen&#x27;s novels.

==In popular culture==
In the United States, a popular idiom is &quot;American as apple pie&quot;. There pie, especially apple pie, became intertwined to the point that in 1902, &quot;The New York Times&quot; asserted that &quot;pie is the food of the heroic&quot; and &quot;no pie-eating people can ever be permanently vanquished&quot;.

The slang expression &quot;to eat humble pie&quot; comes from the umble pie, which was made with chopped animal offal. &quot;It&#x27;s a piece of pie&quot;, meaning that something is easy, dates from 1889. &quot;Pie-eyed&quot;, meaning drunk, dates from 1904. The expression &quot;pie in the sky&quot;, to refer to an unlikely proposal or idea, comes from &quot;The Preacher and the Slave&quot;, a 1911 Joe Hill song.

===Pie throwing===
Cream filled or topped pies are favourite props for slapstick humour. Throwing a pie in a person&#x27;s face has been a staple of film comedy since Ben Turpin received one in &quot;Mr. Flip&quot; in 1909. More recently, pieing has also become a political act; some activists throw cream pies at politicians and other public figures as a form of protest.

<text>A Simbi (also Cymbee, Sim&#x27;bi, pl. Bisimbi) is a Central African water and nature spirit in traditional Kongo religion, as well as in African diaspora spiritual traditions, such as Hoodoo in the southern United States and Palo in Cuba. Simbi have been historically identified as water people, or mermaids, pottery, snakes, gourds, and fire. Due to the forced removal of Bantu peoples from Africa to the Americas, the veneration of simbi exists today in countries, such as the United States, Brazil, Cuba, and Haiti.

== Etymology ==
While there is little written historical record of the word &quot;simbi&quot;, there is consensus that it originated within Bantu-speaking and Kongo-speaking communities and almost certainly began as a means for them to understand the spiritual nature of the world around them. Some believe the word &quot;simbi&quot; derives from &quot;simba&quot;, a Kikongo word that means &quot;to hold, keep, preserve.&quot; The similar phrase, &quot;isimba ia nsi&quot;, which translates to &quot;a distinguished person in the community,&quot; was recorded in an early Kikongo dictionary in the seventeenth century. This phrase and others, such as &quot;kisímbi kinsí&quot;, which translates to &quot;the very old person who does not die,&quot; are a few of the earliest evidences of the spiritual connection of bisimbi to the land of the living and the land of the dead. The word &quot;basimbi&quot; also translates to &quot;guardians&quot; with the phrase &quot;isimba ia nsi&quot; later becoming &quot;guardians of the land.&quot;

== Kongo spirituality ==

The Bakongo people traditionally believe that bisimbi are magically water spirits (in kikongo: &quot;nkisi mia mamba&quot;) that can appear as a person, a snake, pottery, a calabash vine, or &quot;Kalûnga&quot;, a spark of fire, similar to the spark that begot the universe in Kongo creation mythology. There have also been claims of bisimbi appearing as birds, twisted trees and mermaid-like beings. They are seen as the guardians of nature and the intermediaries who travel the Kalûnga Line between &quot;Ku Seke&quot;, the physical world of the living, and &quot;Ku Mpémba&quot;, the spiritual world of the ancestors. Bisimbi are also believed to be spiritual guides, using storytelling and oral tradition to connect the living to the ancestors and their history. The likening of the living elders to the bisimbi in the phrase &quot;kisímbi kinsí&quot; highlights the importance of Bakongo elders to the spiritual well-being of the community and the passing of their beliefs from one generation to the next.

== Hoodoo ==
The belief that bisimbi &quot;inhabit rocks, gullies, streams, and pools, and are able to influence the fertility and well being of those living in the area&quot; was translocated to the United States by enslaved Bakongo and Mbundu peoples. Because forty percent of Africans taken during the trans-atlantic slave trade came from Central Africa&#x27;s Congo Basin, and bisimbi became revered in the United States in Black American communities in Hoodoo tradition across the American South. Some Black churches prayed to Kongo-derived simbi spirits during Baptism and it was believed that simbi spirits were present when congregants were dipped into the water and washed clean. This belief highlighted the Central African influence on Christian baptism, the fusion of both traditional African and new Black American spiritual practices, and the evolving nature of Black spirituality in the Americas.

=== Sightings ===
Academic research on the Pooshee Plantation and Woodboo Plantation in South Carolina, showed a continued belief of African water spirits among enslaved African Americans. Both plantations are &quot;now under the waters of Lake Moultrie.&quot; The earliest known record of simbi spirits was recorded in the nineteenth century by Edmund Ruffin who was a wealthy slaveholder from Virginia, and traveled to South Carolina &quot;to keep the slave economic system viable through agricultural reform.&quot;

&quot;At Pooshee plantation on the Santee Canal not too far from Woodboo, Ruffin stated that a young slave boy went to a fountain for water late at night and was very frightened by a cymbee (Simbi water spirit) who was running around and around the fountain. Although few witnesses to the appearance of cymbees were found by Ruffin, he stated that they are generally believed by the slaves to be frequent and numerous. Part of the superstition was that it was bad luck for anyone who saw one to &#x27;tell of the occurrence, or refer to it; and that his death would be the certain penalty, if he told of the meeting for some weeks afterwards.&quot; Another occurrence from an enslaved man said simbi spirits have long hair.

=== Sukey and The Mermaid ===
In Black American folklore, the Gullah Geechee people in the Carolina Lowcountry have a children&#x27;s story called &quot;Sukey and the Mermaid&quot; about a girl named Sukey meeting a mermaid named Mama Jo. Mama Jo in the story helps and protects Sukey and financially supported her by giving her gold coins. This story comes from the belief in Simbi spirits in Central Africa that came to the United States during the Atlantic slave trade. In Africa, Simbi nature spirits protect and provide riches to their followers. In Central Africa, there are folk stories of people meeting mermaids.

== Haitian Vodou ==

The belief in bisimbi also exists in the traditional spiritual practices of Haiti. While Haitian Vodou has been known for its West African influences, primarily those from Benin and Nigeria, it also contains Central African influences from the Congo Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Angola in the form of bisimbi. Though often referred to as lwa, bisimbi such as Mami Wata, Nsimba and Nzuzi are still &quot;nlongo&quot;, or sacred, in traditional Haitian spirituality and culture.

==Palo==
In an Afro-Cuban religion called Palo, bisimbi are called &quot;Nkitas&quot;. They are deities of all aspects of nature, such as lakes, forests or mountains.

==In culture==
*Governor General Michaëlle Jean of Canada, who was born in Haiti, bears two simbi serpents as supporters on her coat of arms.

<text>: &quot;In the West African Vodun religion, Sobo (alternative name: Grande Sobo) is a soldier-loa who rules over thunder.&quot;

Sobo is a spirit or loa in Haitian Vodou. He is the loa of thunder and is always depicted and served with his inseparable companion/brother Bade, who is the loa of wind. Together they are represented by the Catholic image of Saints Cosmas and Damian. He is probably West African in origin and a flaming ram is his symbol.

<text>Ti Malice is a trickster character and nemesis of Tonton (Uncle) Bouki in Haitian folklore. While Ti Malice is smart and guileful, Uncle Bouki is hardworking but is also very greedy. It is the manipulation of this greed that allows Ti Malice to often get the best of Uncle Bouki. These characters are said to be a split of Anansi, the trickster character of the Ashanti of Ghana.

Bouki and Malice have their origins in African oral traditions. In Senegal and neighbouring countries, these two characters appear in animal form. Bouki is represented as a hyena, which is called &quot;Bouki&quot; in the Fulani and Wolof languages, while Malice is a hare called &quot;Leuk&quot; in Senegal. From there, character traits develop that identify the two companions. Bouki, the hungry and skinny hyena and Leuk, the hare with a mischievous character and legendary cunning.

Two equivalent figures, also a hyena known as Bouki and a hare (called Lapin), are known to exist in Louisiana folktales.

<text>The Wopkai people, or Wopkaimin, are a small aboriginal tribe of the Faiwol people that lives in the remote Star Mountains in western Papua New Guinea in what is known as the Fly River socio-ecological region. They speak the Wopkai dialect of the Faiwol language.

The Ok Tedi Mine, the third largest open pit copper and gold mine in the world is located in their traditional territory. Before the coming of the mine with construction starting in 1981 the Wopkaimin lived in a subsistence economy. The mine severely impacted the tribe, totally disrupting their traditional patterns of life. For one thing, Tabubil a town of 12,500 to house mine workers was built in the midst of their territory. Work for wages was available to tribal members, but only at the unskilled level and not on a regular basis. The Wopkaimin along with many other ethnic groups living in the area now live on a rotating basis between the town of Tabubil, roadside villages along the Kiunga-Tabubil Highway, and in villages away from the mine as jobs are lost or become available.

In 1992, a species of bat, Bulmer&#x27;s fruit bat (&quot;Aproteles bulmerae&quot;) previously thought extinct was discovered to still live in Luplupwintem Cave, an enormous cave above the Hindenburg Wall in their territory. This bat was first discovered in the 1970s by David Hyndman, who studied the Wopkaimin. However the contemporaneous introduction of the shotgun was thought to have resulted in the extinction of the species.

<doc id="90814" wikidata="Q151047" url="?curid=90814" title="The Birth of Venus">
<text>The Birth of Venus ( ) is a painting by the Italian artist Sandro Botticelli, probably executed in the mid-1480s. It depicts the goddess Venus arriving at the shore after her birth, when she had emerged from the sea fully-grown (called Venus Anadyomene and often depicted in art). The painting is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.

Although the two are not a pair, the painting is inevitably discussed with Botticelli&#x27;s other very large mythological painting, the &quot;Primavera&quot;, also in the Uffizi. They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of Italian Renaissance painting; of the two, the &quot;Birth&quot; is better known than the &quot;Primavera&quot;. As depictions of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity, as was the size and prominence of a nude female figure in the &quot;Birth&quot;. It used to be thought that they were both commissioned by the same member of the Medici family, but this is now uncertain.

They have been endlessly analysed by art historians, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations (generally agreed), the influence of Renaissance Neo-Platonism (somewhat controversial), and the identity of the commissioners (not agreed). Most art historians agree, however, that the &quot;Birth&quot; does not require complex analysis to decode its meaning, in the way that the &quot;Primavera&quot; probably does. While there are subtleties in the painting, its main meaning is a straightforward, if individual, treatment of a traditional scene from Greek mythology, and its appeal is sensory and very accessible, hence its enormous popularity.

==Description and subject==

In the centre, the goddess Venus (newly born in fully grown state, in accordance with tradition) stands nude in a giant scallop shell. The size of the shell is purely imaginary, and is also found in classical depictions of the subject. At the left the wind god Zephyrus blows at her, with the wind shown by lines radiating from his mouth. He is in the air, and carries a young female, who is also blowing, but less forcefully. Both have wings. Vasari was probably correct in identifying her as &quot;Aura&quot;, personification of a lighter breeze. Their joint efforts are blowing Venus towards the shore, and blowing the hair and clothes of the other figures to the right.

At the right a female figure who may be floating slightly above the ground holds out a rich cloak or dress to cover Venus when she reaches the shore, as she is about to do. She is one of the three Horae or Hours, Greek minor goddesses of the seasons and of other divisions of time, and attendants of Venus. The floral decoration of her dress suggests she is the Hora of Spring. She stands in a pose, similarly to Venus as she seems relaxed and joyful that Venus has arrived.

Alternative identifications for the two secondary female figures involve those also found in the &quot;Primavera&quot;; the nymph held by Zephyr may be Chloris, a flower nymph he married in some versions of her story, and the figure on land may be Flora. Flora is generally the Roman equivalent of the Greek Chloris; in the &quot;Primavera&quot;, Chloris is transformed into the figure of Flora next to her, following Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot;, but it is hard to see that such a transformation is envisaged here. However, the roses blown along with the two flying figures would be appropriate for Chloris.

The subject is not strictly the &quot;Birth of Venus&quot;, a title given to the painting only in the nineteenth century (though given as the subject by Vasari), but the next scene in her story, where she arrives on land, blown by the wind. The land probably represents either Cythera or Cyprus, both Mediterranean islands regarded by the Greeks as territories of Venus.

==Technical==
The painting is large, but slightly smaller than the &quot;Primavera&quot;, and where that is a panel painting, this is on the cheaper support of canvas. Canvas was increasing in popularity, perhaps especially for secular paintings for country villas, which were decorated more simply, cheaply and cheerfully than those for city &quot;palazzi&quot;, being designed for pleasure more than ostentatious entertainment.

The painting is on two pieces of canvas, sewn together before starting, with a gesso ground tinted blue. There are differences to Botticelli&#x27;s usual technique, working on panel supports, such as the lack of a green first layer under the flesh areas. There are a number of &quot;pentimenti&quot; revealed by modern scientific testing. The Hora originally had &quot;low classical sandals&quot;, and the collar on the mantle she holds out is an afterthought. The hair of Venus and the flying couple was changed. There is heavy use of gold as a pigment for highlights, on hair, wings, textiles, the shell and the landscape. This was all apparently applied after the painting was framed. It was finished with a &quot;cool gray varnish&quot;, probably using egg yolk.

As in the &quot;Primavera&quot;, the green pigment – used for the wings of Zephyr, Zephyr&#x27;s companion, and the leaves of the orange trees on the land – has darkened considerably with exposure to light over time, somewhat distorting the intended balance of colours. Parts of some leaves at the top right corner, normally covered by the frame, have been less affected. The blues of the sea and sky have also lost their brightness.

==Style==
Although the pose of Venus is classical in some respects, and borrows the position of the hands from the Venus Pudica type in Greco-Roman sculptures (see section below), the overall treatment of the figure, standing off-centre with a curved body of long flowing lines, is in many respects from Gothic art. Kenneth Clark wrote: &quot;Her differences from antique form are not physiological, but rhythmic and structural. Her whole body follows the curve of a Gothic ivory. It is entirely without that quality so much prized in classical art, known as aplomb; that is to say, the weight of the body is not distributed evenly either side of a central plumb line. ... She is not standing but floating. ... Her shoulders, for example, instead of forming a sort of architrave to her torso, as in the antique nude, run down into her arms in the same unbroken stream of movement as her floating hair.&quot;

Venus&#x27; body is anatomically improbable, with elongated neck and torso. Her pose is impossible: although she stands in a classical &quot;contrapposto&quot; stance, her weight is shifted too far over the left leg for the pose to be held. The proportions and poses of the winds to the left do not quite make sense, and none of the figures cast shadows. The painting depicts the world of the imagination rather than being very concerned with realistic depiction.

Ignoring the size and positioning of the wings and limbs of the flying pair on the left, which bother some other critics, Kenneth Clark calls them:

...perhaps the most beautiful example of ecstatic movement in the whole of painting. ... the suspension of our reason is achieved by the intricate rhythms of the drapery which sweep and flow irresistibly around the nude figures. Their bodies, by an endless intricacy of embrace, sustain the current of movement, which finally flickers down their legs and is dispersed like an electric charge.

Botticelli&#x27;s art was never fully committed to naturalism; in comparison to his contemporary Domenico Ghirlandaio, Botticelli seldom gave weight and volume to his figures and rarely used a deep perspectival space. Botticelli never painted landscape backgrounds with great detail or realism, but this is especially the case here. The laurel trees and the grass below them are green with gold highlights, most of the waves regular patterns, and the landscape seems out of scale with the figures. The clumps of bulrushes in the left foreground are out of place here, as they come from a freshwater species.

==Dating and history==
It has long been suggested that Botticelli was commissioned to paint the work by the Medici family of Florence, perhaps by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de&#x27; Medici (1463–1503) a major patron of Botticelli, under the influence of his cousin Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, &quot;il Magnifico&quot;. This was first suggested by Herbert Horne in his monograph of 1908, the first major modern work on Botticelli, and long followed by most writers, but more recently has been widely doubted, though it is still accepted by some. Various interpretations of the painting rely on this origin for its meaning. Although relations were perhaps always rather tense between the &quot;Magnifico&quot; and his young cousins and wards, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco and his brother Giovanni di Pierfrancesco de&#x27; Medici, it may have been politic to commission a work that glorified the older Lorenzo, as some interpretations have it. There may be a deliberate ambiguity as to which Lorenzo was intended to be evoked. In later years hostility between the two branches of the family became overt.

Horne believed that the painting was commissioned soon after the purchase in 1477 of the Villa di Castello, a country house outside Florence, by Lorenzo and Giovanni, to decorate their new house, which they were rebuilding. This was the year after their father died at the age of 46, leaving the young boys wards of their cousin Lorenzo il Magnifico, of the senior branch of the Medici family and &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Florence. There is no record of the original commission, and the painting is first mentioned by Vasari, who saw it, together with the &quot;Primavera&quot;, at Castello, some time before the first edition of his &quot;Lives&quot; in 1550, probably by 1530–40. In 1550 Vasari was himself painting in the villa, but he very possibly visited it before that. But in 1975 it emerged that, unlike the &quot;Primavera&quot;, the &quot;Birth&quot; is not in the inventory, apparently complete, made in 1499 of the works of art belonging to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco&#x27;s branch of the family. Ronald Lightbown concludes that it only came to be owned by the Medici after that. The inventory was only published in 1975, and made many previous assumptions invalid.

Horne dated the work at some point after the purchase of the villa in 1477 and before Botticelli&#x27;s departure for Rome to join the painting of the Sistine Chapel in 1481. Recent scholars prefer a date of around 1484–86 on grounds of the work&#x27;s place in the development of Botticelli&#x27;s style. The &quot;Primavera&quot; is now usually dated earlier, after Botticelli&#x27;s return from Rome in 1482 and perhaps around the time of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco&#x27;s wedding in July 1482, but by some still before Botticelli&#x27;s departure.

Whenever the two paintings were united at Castello, they have remained together ever since. They stayed in Castello until 1815, when they were transferred to the Uffizi. For some years until 1919 they were kept in the Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia, another government museum in Florence.

== Interpretations ==

Although there are ancient and modern texts that are relevant, no single text provides the precise imagery of the painting, which has led scholars to propose many sources and interpretations. Many art historians who specialize in the Italian Renaissance have found Neoplatonic interpretations, of which two different versions have been articulated by Edgar Wind and Ernst Gombrich, to be the key to understanding the painting. Botticelli represented the Neoplatonic idea of divine love in the form of a nude Venus.

For Plato – and so for the members of the Florentine Platonic Academy – Venus had two aspects: she was an earthly goddess who 
aroused humans to physical love or she was a heavenly goddess who inspired intellectual love in them. Plato further argued that contemplation of physical beauty allowed the mind to better understand spiritual beauty. So, looking at Venus, the most beautiful of goddesses, might at first raise a physical response in viewers which then lifted their minds towards the godly. A Neoplatonic reading of Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;Birth of Venus&quot; suggests that 15th-century viewers would have looked at the painting and felt their minds lifted to the realm of divine love.

The composition, with a central nude figure, and one to the side with an arm raised above the head of the first, and winged beings in attendance, would have reminded its Renaissance viewers of the traditional iconography of the Baptism of Christ, marking the start of his ministry on earth. In a similar way, the scene shows here marks the start of Venus&#x27;s ministry of love, whether in a simple sense, or the expanded meaning of Renaissance Neoplatonism.

More recently, questions have arisen about Neoplatonism as the dominant intellectual system of late 15th-century Florence, and scholars have indicated that there might be other ways to interpret Botticelli&#x27;s mythological paintings. In particular, both &quot;Primavera&quot; and &quot;Birth of Venus&quot; have been seen as wedding paintings that suggest appropriate behaviors for brides and grooms.

The laurel trees at right and laurel wreath worn by the Hora are punning references to the name &quot;Lorenzo&quot;, though it is uncertain whether Lorenzo il Magnifico, the effective ruler of Florence, or his young cousin Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco is meant. In the same way the flowers in the air around Zephyr and on the textiles worn and carried by the Hora evoke the name of Florence.

===Literary sources===

The closest precedent for the scene is generally agreed to be in one of the early ancient Greek Homeric Hymns, published in Florence in 1488 by the Greek refugee Demetrios Chalkokondyles:

:::Of august gold-wreathed and beautiful
:::Aphrodite I shall sing to whose domain
:::belong the battlements of all sea-loved
:::Cyprus where, blown by the moist breath
:::of Zephyros, she was carried over the
:::waves of the resounding sea on soft foam.
:::The gold-filleted Horae happily welcomed
:::her and clothed her with heavenly raiment.

This poem was probably already known to Botticelli&#x27;s Florentine contemporary, and Lorenzo di Medici&#x27;s court poet, Angelo Poliziano. The iconography of &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; is similar to a description of a relief of the event in Poliziano&#x27;s poem the &quot;Stanze per la giostra&quot;, commemorating a Medici joust in 1475, which may also have influenced Botticelli, although there are many differences. For example, Poliziano talks of multiple Horae and zephyrs. Older writers, following Horne, posited that &quot;his patron Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco asked him to paint a subject illustrating the lines&quot;, and that remains a possibility, though one difficult to maintain so confidently today. Another poem by Politian speaks of Zephyr causing flowers to bloom, and spreading their scent over the land, which probably explains the roses he blows along with him in the painting.

===Ancient art===

Having a large standing female nude as the central focus was unprecedented in post-classical Western painting, and certainly drew on the classical sculptures which were coming to light in this period, especially in Rome, where Botticelli had spent 1481–82 working on the walls of the Sistine Chapel. The pose of Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;Venus&quot; follows the Venus Pudica (&quot;Venus of Modesty&quot;) type from classical antiquity, where the hands are held to cover the breasts and groin; in classical art this is not associated with the new-born &quot;Venus Anadyomene&quot;. What became a famous example of this type is the &quot;Venus de&#x27; Medici&quot;, a marble sculpture that was in a Medici collection in Rome by 1559, which Botticelli may have had opportunity to study (the date it was found is unclear).

The painter and the humanist scholars who probably advised him would have recalled that Pliny the Elder had mentioned a lost masterpiece of the celebrated ancient Greek painter, Apelles, representing &quot;Venus Anadyomene&quot; (&quot;Venus Rising from the Sea&quot;). According to Pliny, Alexander the Great offered his mistress, Campaspe, as the model for the nude Venus and later, realizing that Apelles had fallen in love with the girl, gave her to the artist in a gesture of extreme magnanimity. Pliny went on to note that Apelles&#x27; painting of Pankaspe as Venus was later &quot;dedicated by Augustus in the shrine of his father Caesar.&quot; Pliny also stated that &quot;the lower part of the painting was damaged, and it was impossible to find anyone who could restore it. ... This picture decayed from age and rottenness, and Nero ... substituted for it another painting by the hand of Dorotheus&quot;.

Pliny also noted a second painting by Apelles of Venus &quot;superior even to his earlier one,&quot; that had been begun by the artist but left unfinished. The Roman images in various media showing the new-born Venus in a giant shell may well be crude derivative versions of these paintings. Botticelli could not have seen the frescos unearthed later in Pompeii, but may well have seen small versions of the motif in terracotta or engraved gems. The &quot;House of Venus&quot; in Pompeii has a life-size fresco of Venus lying in the shell, also seen in other works; in most other images she stands with her hands on her hair, wringing the water from it, with or without a shell.

The two-dimensionality of this painting may be a deliberate attempt to evoke the style of ancient Greek vase painting or frescos on the walls of Etruscan tombs, the only types of ancient painting known to Botticelli.


===Charles R. Mack&#x27;s interpretation===

Another interpretation of the &quot;Birth of Venus&quot; is provided by art historian and author, Charles R. Mack. This interpretation takes much that is generally agreed, but Mack goes on to explain the painting as an allegory extolling the virtues of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici. This has not been adopted by Renaissance art historians in general, and it remains problematic, since it depends on the painting being commissioned by the Medici, yet the work is not documented in Medici hands until well into the following century.

Mack sees the scene as inspired by both the Homeric Hymn and the ancient paintings. But something more than a rediscovered Homeric hymn was likely in the mind of the Medici family member who commissioned this painting from Botticelli. Once again, Botticelli, in his version of the Birth of Venus, might be seen as completing the task begun by his ancient predecessor Apelles, even surpassing him. Giving added support to this interpretation of Botticelli as a born-again Apelles is the fact that that very claim was voiced in 1488 by Ugolino Verino in a poem entitled &quot;On Giving Praise to the History of Florence.&quot; 

While Botticelli might well have been celebrated as a revivified Apelles, his &quot;Birth of Venus&quot; also testified to the special nature of Florence&#x27;s chief citizen, Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici. Although it now seems that the painting was executed for another member of the Medici family, it likely was intended to celebrate and flatter its head, Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici. Tradition associates the image of Venus in Botticelli&#x27;s painting with the famous beauty Simonetta Cattaneo Vespucci, of whom popular legend claims both Lorenzo and his younger brother, Giuliano, were great admirers. Simonetta was possibly born in the Ligurian seaside town of Portovenere (&#x27;the port of Venus&#x27;). Thus, in Botticelli&#x27;s interpretation, Pankaspe (the ancient living prototype of Simonetta), the mistress of Alexander the Great (the Laurentian predecessor), becomes the lovely model for the lost &quot;Venus&quot; executed by the famous Greek painter Apelles (reborn through the recreative talents of Botticelli), which ended up in Rome, installed by Emperor Augustus in the temple dedicated to Florence&#x27;s supposed founder Julius Caesar.

In the case of Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;Birth of Venus&quot;, the suggested references to Lorenzo, supported by other internal indicators such as the stand of laurel bushes at the right, would have been just the sort of thing erudite Florentine humanists would have appreciated. Accordingly, by overt implication, Lorenzo becomes the new Alexander the Great with an implied link to both Augustus, the first Roman emperor, and even to Florence&#x27;s legendary founder, Caesar himself. Lorenzo, furthermore, is not only magnificent but, as was Alexander in Pliny&#x27;s story, also magnanimous, as well. Ultimately, these readings of the &quot;Birth of Venus&quot; flatter not only the Medici and Botticelli but all of Florence, home to the worthy successors to some of the greatest figures of antiquity, both in governance and in the arts.

These essentially pagan readings of Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;Birth of Venus&quot; should not exclude a more purely Christian one, which may be derived from the Neoplatonic reading of the painting indicated above. Viewed from a religious standpoint, the nudity of Venus suggests that of Eve before the Fall as well as the pure love of Paradise. Once landed, the goddess of love will don the earthly garb of mortal sin, an act that will lead to the New Eve – the Madonna whose purity is represented by the nude Venus. Once draped in earthly garments she becomes a personification of the Christian Church which offers a spiritual transport back to the pure love of eternal salvation. In this case the scallop shell upon which this image of Venus/Eve/Madonna/Church stands may be seen in its traditionally symbolic pilgrimage context. Furthermore, the broad expanse of sea serves as a reminder of the Virgin Mary&#x27;s title &quot;stella maris&quot;, alluding both to the Madonna&#x27;s name (Maria/maris) and to the heavenly body (Venus/stella). The sea brings forth Venus just as the Virgin gives birth to the ultimate symbol of love, Christ.

Rather than choosing one of the many interpretations offered for Botticelli&#x27;s depiction of the &quot;Birth (Arrival?) of Venus&quot; it might be better to view it from a variety of perspectives. This layered approach—mythological, political, religious—was intended.

== Derivative versions ==

Botticelli, or more likely his workshop, repeated the figure of Venus in another painting of about 1490. This life-sized work depicts a similar figure and pose, partially clad in a light blouse, and contrasted against a plain dark background. It is in the Galleria Sabauda in Turin. There is another such workshop &quot;Venus&quot; in Berlin, and very likely others were destroyed in the &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;. Examples seem to have been exported to France and Germany, probably influencing Lucas Cranach the Elder among others.

More than a decade later, Botticelli adapted the figure of Venus for a nude personification of &quot;Truth&quot; in his &quot;Calumny of Apelles&quot;. Here one hand is raised, pointing to heaven for justification, and the figure&#x27;s gaze also looks upwards; the whole effect is very different.

A detail from Botticelli’s Venus has appeared on the back of Italian ten-cent coins since the Euro’s initial adoption in 2002. The coin, made of Nordic Gold, features a small effigy of Venus’ face and neck, encircled within twelve five-point stars, alongside an Italian Republic Monogram and its mint year.

<text>Military technology is the application of technology for use in warfare. It comprises the kinds of technology that are distinctly military in nature and not civilian in application, usually because they lack useful or legal civilian applications, or are dangerous to use without appropriate military training.

The line is porous; military inventions have been brought into civilian use throughout history, with sometimes minor modification if any, and civilian innovations have similarly been put to military use.

Military technology is usually researched and developed by scientists and engineers specifically for use in battle by the armed forces. Many new technologies came as a result of the military funding of science.
On the other hand, the theories, strategies, concepts and doctrines of warfare are studied under the academic discipline of military science.

Armament engineering is the design, development, testing and lifecycle management of military weapons and systems. It draws on the knowledge of several traditional engineering disciplines, including mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, mechatronics, electro-optics, aerospace engineering, materials engineering, and chemical engineering.

==History==
This section is divided into the broad cultural developments that affected military technology.

===Ancient technology===
The first use of stone tools may have begun during the Paleolithic Period. The earliest stone tools are from the site of Lomekwi, Turkana, dating from 3.3 million years ago. Stone tools diversified through the Pleistocene Period, which ended ~12,000 years ago.
The earliest evidence of warfare between two groups is recorded at the site of Nataruk in Turkana, Kenya, where human skeletons with major traumatic injuries to the head, neck, ribs, knees and hands, including an embedded obsidian bladelet on a skull, are evidence of inter-group conflict between groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago.

Humans entered the Bronze Age as they learned to smelt copper into an alloy with tin to make weapons. In Asia where copper-tin ores are rare, this development was delayed until trading in bronze began in the third millennium BCE. In the Middle East and Southern European regions, the Bronze Age follows the Neolithic period, but in other parts of the world, the Copper Age is a transition from Neolithic to the Bronze Age. Although the Iron Age generally follows the Bronze Age, in some areas the Iron Age intrudes directly on the Neolithic from outside the region, with the exception of Sub-Saharan Africa where it was developed independently.

The first large-scale use of iron weapons began in Asia Minor around the 14th century BCE and in Central Europe around the 11th century BCE followed by the Middle East (about 1000 BCE) and India and China.

The Assyrians are credited with the introduction of horse cavalry in warfare and the extensive use of iron weapons by 1100 BCE. Assyrians were also the first to use iron-tipped arrows.

===Post-classical technology===

The &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; (&quot;Essentials of the Military Arts&quot;), written by Zeng Gongliang, Ding Du, and others at the order of Emperor Renzong around 1043 during the Song dynasty illustrate the eras focus on advancing intellectual issues and military technology due to the significance of warfare between the Song and the Liao, Jin, and Yuan to their north. The book covers topics of military strategy, training, and the production and employment of advanced weaponry.

Advances in military technology aided the Song dynasty in its defense against hostile neighbors to the north. The flamethrower found its origins in Byzantine-era Greece, employing Greek fire (a chemically complex, highly flammable petrol fluid) in a device with a siphon hose by the 7th century. The earliest reference to Greek Fire in China was made in 917, written by Wu Renchen in his &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms&quot;. In 919, the siphon projector-pump was used to spread the &#x27;fierce fire oil&#x27; that could not be doused with water, as recorded by Lin Yu in his , hence the first credible Chinese reference to the flamethrower employing the chemical solution of Greek fire (see also Pen Huo Qi). Lin Yu mentioned also that the &#x27;fierce fire oil&#x27; derived ultimately from one of China&#x27;s maritime contacts in the &#x27;southern seas&#x27;, Arabia . In the Battle of Langshan Jiang in 919, the naval fleet of the Wenmu King from Wuyue defeated a Huainan army from the Wu state; Wenmu&#x27;s success was facilitated by the use of &#x27;fire oil&#x27; (&#x27;huoyou&#x27;) to burn their fleet, signifying the first Chinese use of gunpowder in a battle. The Chinese applied the use of double-piston bellows to pump petrol out of a single cylinder (with an upstroke and downstroke), lit at the end by a slow-burning gunpowder match to fire a continuous stream of flame. This device was featured in description and illustration of the &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; military manuscript of 1044. In the suppression of the Southern Tang state by 976, early Song naval forces confronted them on the Yangtze River in 975. Southern Tang forces attempted to use flamethrowers against the Song navy, but were accidentally consumed by their own fire when violent winds swept in their direction.

Although the destructive effects of gunpowder were described in the earlier Tang dynasty by a Daoist alchemist, the earliest developments of the gun barrel and the projectile-fire cannon were found in late Song China. The first art depiction of the Chinese &#x27;fire lance&#x27; (a combination of a temporary-fire flamethrower and gun) was from a Buddhist mural painting of Dunhuang, dated circa 950. These &#x27;fire-lances&#x27; were widespread in use by the early 12th century, featuring hollowed bamboo poles as tubes to fire sand particles (to blind and choke), lead pellets, bits of sharp metal and pottery shards, and finally large gunpowder-propelled arrows and rocket weaponry. Eventually, perishable bamboo was replaced with hollow tubes of cast iron, and so too did the terminology of this new weapon change, from &#x27;fire-spear&#x27; to &#x27;fire-tube&#x27; . This ancestor to the gun was complemented by the ancestor to the cannon, what the Chinese referred to since the 13th century as the &#x27;multiple bullets magazine erupter&#x27; , a tube of bronze or cast iron that was filled with about 100 lead balls.

The earliest known depiction of a gun is a sculpture from a cave in Sichuan, dating to 1128, that portrays a figure carrying a vase-shaped bombard, firing flames and a cannonball. However, the oldest existent archaeological discovery of a metal barrel handgun is from the Chinese Heilongjiang excavation, dated to 1288. The Chinese also discovered the explosive potential of packing hollowed cannonball shells with gunpowder. Written later by Jiao Yu in his &quot;Huolongjing&quot; (mid-14th century), this manuscript recorded an earlier Song-era cast-iron cannon known as the &#x27;flying-cloud thunderclap eruptor&#x27; (fei yun pi-li pao). The manuscript stated that:

As noted before, the change in terminology for these new weapons during the Song period were gradual. The early Song cannons were at first termed the same way as the Chinese trebuchet catapult. A later Ming dynasty scholar known as Mao Yuanyi would explain this use of terminology and true origins of the cannon in his text of the &quot;Wubei Zhi&quot;, written in 1628:

The 14th-century &quot;Huolongjing&quot; was also one of the first Chinese texts to carefully describe to the use of explosive land mines, which had been used by the late Song Chinese against the Mongols in 1277, and employed by the Yuan dynasty afterwards. The innovation of the detonated land mine was accredited to one Luo Qianxia in the campaign of defense against the Mongol invasion by Kublai Khan, Later Chinese texts revealed that the Chinese land mine employed either a rip cord or a motion booby trap of a pin releasing falling weights that rotated a steel flint wheel, which in turn created sparks that ignited the train of fuses for the land mines. Furthermore, the Song employed the earliest known gunpowder-propelled rockets in warfare during the late 13th century, its earliest form being the archaic Fire Arrow. When the Northern Song capital of Kaifeng fell to the Jurchens in 1126, it was written by Xia Shaozeng that 20,000 fire arrows were handed over to the Jurchens in their conquest. An even earlier Chinese text of the &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; (&quot;Collection of the Most Important Military Techniques&quot;), written in 1044 by the Song scholars Zeng Kongliang and Yang Weide, described the use of three spring or triple bow arcuballista that fired arrow bolts holding gunpowder packets near the head of the arrow. Going back yet even farther, the (1630, second edition 1664) of Fang Yizhi stated that fire arrows were presented to Emperor Taizu of Song (r. 960–976) in 960.

===Modern technology===

==== Armies ====
The Islamic gunpowder empires introduced numerous developed firearms, cannon and small arms. During the period of Proto-industrialization, newly invented weapons were seen to be used in Mughal India.

Rapid development in military technology had a dramatic impact on armies and navies in the industrialized world in 1740–1914. For land warfare, cavalry faded in importance, while infantry became transformed by the use of highly accurate more rapidly loading rifles, and the use of smokeless powder. Machine guns were developed in the 1860s in Europe. Rocket artillery and the Mysorean rockets were pioneered by Indian Muslim ruler Tipu Sultan and the French introduced much more accurate rapid-fire field artillery. Logistics and communications support for land warfare dramatically improved with use of railways and telegraphs. Industrialization provided a base of factories that could be converted to produce munitions, as well as uniforms, tents, wagons and essential supplies. Medical facilities were enlarged and reorganized based on improved hospitals and the creation of modern nursing, typified by Florence Nightingale in Britain during the Crimean War of 1854–56.

====Naval====
Naval warfare was transformed by many innovations, most notably the coal-based steam engine, highly accurate long-range naval guns, heavy steel armour for battleships, mines, and the introduction of the torpedo, followed by the torpedo boat and the destroyer. Coal after 1900 was eventually displaced by more efficient oil, but meanwhile navies with an international scope had to depend on a network of coaling stations to refuel. The British Empire provided them in abundance, as did the French Empire to a lesser extent. War colleges developed, as military theory became a specialty; cadets and senior commanders were taught the theories of Jomini, Clausewitz and Mahan, and engaged in tabletop war games. Around 1900, entirely new innovations such as submarines and airplanes appeared, and were quickly adapted to warfare by 1914. The British HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; (1906) incorporated so much of the latest technology in weapons, propulsion and armour that it at a stroke made all other battleships obsolescent.

====Organization and finance====
New financial tools were developed to fund the rapidly increasing costs of warfare, such as popular bond sales and income taxes, and the funding of permanent research centers. Many 19th century innovations were largely invented and promoted by lone individuals with small teams of assistants, such as David Bushnell and the submarine, John Ericsson and the battleship, Hiram Maxim and the machine gun, and Alfred Nobel and high explosives. By 1900 the military began to realize that they needed to rely much more heavily on large-scale research centers, which needed government funding. They brought in leaders of organized innovation such as Thomas Edison in the U.S. and chemist Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.

==Postmodern technology==
The postmodern stage of military technology emerged in the 1940s, and one with recognition thanks to the high priority given during the war to scientific and engineering research and development regarding nuclear weapons, radar, jet engines, proximity fuses, advanced submarines, aircraft carriers, and other weapons. The high-priority continues into the 21st century. It involves the military application of advanced scientific research regarding nuclear weapons, jet engines, ballistic and guided missiles, radar, biological warfare, and the use of electronics, computers and software.

===Space===

During the Cold War, the world&#x27;s two great superpowers – the Soviet Union and the United States of America – spent large proportions of their GDP on developing military technologies. The drive to place objects in orbit stimulated space research and started the Space Race. In 1957, the USSR launched the first artificial satellite, &quot;Sputnik 1&quot;.

By the end of the 1960s, both countries regularly deployed satellites. Spy satellites were used by militaries to take accurate pictures of their rivals&#x27; military installations. As time passed the resolution and accuracy of orbital reconnaissance alarmed both sides of the Iron Curtain. Both the United States and the Soviet Union began to develop anti-satellite weapons to blind or destroy each other&#x27;s satellites. Laser weapons, kamikaze style satellites, as well as orbital cannons
 were researched with varying levels of success. Spy satellites were, and continue to be, used to monitor the dismantling of military assets in accordance with arms control treaties signed between the two superpowers. To use spy satellites in such a manner is often referred to in treaties as &quot;national technical means of verification&quot;.

The superpowers developed ballistic missiles to enable them to use nuclear weaponry across great distances. As rocket science developed, the range of missiles increased and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) were created, which could strike virtually any target on Earth in a timeframe measured in minutes rather than hours or days. To cover large distances ballistic missiles are usually launched into sub-orbital spaceflight.
As soon as intercontinental missiles were developed, military planners began programmes and strategies to counter their effectiveness.

===Mobilization===

A significant portion of military technology is about transportation, allowing troops and weaponry to be moved from their origins to the front. Land transport has historically been mainly by foot, land vehicles have usually been used as well, from chariots to tanks.

When conducting a battle over a body of water, ships are used. There are historically two main categories of ships: those for transporting troops, and those for attacking other ships.

Soon after the invention of aeroplanes, military aviation became a significant component of warfare, though usually as a supplementary role. The two main types of military aircraft are bombers, which attack land- or sea-based targets, and fighters, which attack other aircraft.

Military vehicles are land combat or transportation vehicles, excluding rail-based, which are designed for or in significant use by military forces.

*List of forts
===Sensors and communication===

Sensors and communication systems are used to detect enemies, coordinate movements of armed forces and guide weaponry. Early systems included flag signaling, telegraph and heliographs.

*Laser guidance
*Missile guidance
*Norden Bombsight
*Proximity fuse
*Radar
*Satellite guidance in guidance weapons

==Future technology==

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is an agency of the United States Department of Defense responsible for the development of new technologies for use by the military. DARPA leads the development of military technology in the United States and today, has dozens of ongoing projects; everything from humanoid robots to bullets that can change path before reaching their target. China has a similar agency.

===Emerging territory===

Current militaries continue to invest in new technologies for the future. Such technologies include cognitive radar, 5G cellular networks, microchips, semiconductors, and large scale analytic engines.

Additionally, many militaries seek to improve current laser technology. For example, Israeli Defense Forces utilize laser technology to disable small enemy machinery, but seek to move to more large scale capabilities in the coming years.

Militaries across the world continue to perform research on autonomous technologies which allow for increased troop mobility or replacement of live soldiers. Autonomous vehicles and robots are expected to play a role in future conflicts; this has the potential to decrease loss of life in future warfare. Observers of transhumanism note high rates of technological terms in military literature, but low rates for explicitly transhuman-related terms.

Today&#x27;s hybrid style of warfare also calls for investments in information technologies. Increased reliance on computer systems has incentivized nations to push for increased efforts at managing large scale networks and having access to large scale data.

New strategies of cyber and hybrid warfare includes, network attacks, media analysis, and media/ grass-roots campaigns on medias such as blog posts

====Cyberspace====
In 2011, the US Defense Department declared cyberspace a new domain of warfare; since then DARPA has begun a research project known as &quot;Project X&quot; with the goal of creating new technologies that will enable the government to better understand and map the cyber territory. Ultimately giving the Department of Defense the ability to plan and manage large-scale cyber missions across dynamic network environments.

<text>Viracocha (also Wiraqocha, Huiracocha; Quechua Wiraqucha) is the great creator deity in the pre-Inca and Inca mythology in the Andes region of South America. According to the myth Viracocha had human appearance and was generally considered as bearded. According to the myth he ordered the construction of Tiwanaku. It is also said that he was accompanied by men also referred to as Viracochas.

It is often referred to with several epithets. Such compound names include Ticsi Viracocha (&quot;T&#x27;iqsi Wiraqocha&quot;), Contiti Viracocha, and, occasionally, &quot;Kon-Tiki Viracocha&quot; (the source of the name of Thor Heyerdahl&#x27;s raft). Other designations are &quot;the creator&quot;, Viracochan Pachayachicachan, Viracocha Pachayachachi or Pachayachachic (&quot;teacher of the world&quot;).

For the Inca the Viracocha cult was more important than the sun cult. Viracocha was the most important deity in the Inca pantheon and seen as the creator of all things, or the substance from which all things are created, and intimately associated with the sea. Viracocha was immediately followed by Inti, the Sun.

Viracocha created the universe, sun, moon, and stars, time (by commanding the sun to move over the sky) and civilization itself. Viracocha was worshipped as god of the sun and of storms.

So-called Staff Gods do not all necessarily fit well with the Viracocha interpretation.

==Cosmogony according to Spanish accounts==
According to a myth recorded by Juan de Betanzos, Viracocha rose from Lake Titicaca (or sometimes the cave of Paqariq Tampu) during the time of darkness to bring forth light. He made the sun, moon, and the stars. He made mankind by breathing into stones, but his first creation were brainless giants that displeased him. So, he destroyed them with a flood and made humans, beings who were better than the giants, from smaller stones. After creating them, they were scattered all over the world.

Viracocha eventually disappeared across the Pacific Ocean (by walking on the water), and never returned. He wandered the earth disguised as a beggar, teaching his new creations the basics of civilization, as well as working numerous miracles. Many, however, refused to follow his teachings, devolving into warfare and delinquency; Viracocha wept when he saw the plight of the creatures he had created. It was thought that Viracocha would re-appear in times of trouble. Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa wrote that Viracocha was described as &quot;a man of medium height, white and dressed in a white robe like an alb secured round the waist and that he carried a staff and a book in his hands.&quot;

In one legend he had one son, Inti, and two daughters, Mama Killa and Pachamama. In this legend, he destroyed the people around Lake Titicaca with a Great Flood called &quot;Unu Pachakuti&quot;, lasting 60 days and 60 nights, saving two to bring civilization to the rest of the world. These two beings are Manco Cápac, the son of Inti (sometimes taken as the son of Viracocha), which name means &quot;splendid foundation&quot;, and Mama Uqllu, which means &quot;mother fertility&quot;. These two founded the Inca civilization carrying a golden staff, called &#x27;tapac-yauri&#x27;. In another legend, he fathered the first eight civilized human beings. In some stories, he has a wife called Mama Qucha.

In another legend, Viracocha had two sons, Imahmana Viracocha and Tocapo Viracocha. After the Great Flood and the Creation, Viracocha sent his sons to visit the tribes to the northeast and northwest to determine if they still obeyed his commandments. Viracocha traveled North. During their journey, Imaymana and Tocapo gave names to all the trees, flowers, fruits, and herbs. They also taught the tribes which of these were edible, which had medicinal properties, and which were poisonous. Eventually, Viracocha, Tocapo and Imahmana arrived at Cusco (in modern-day Peru) and the Pacific seacoast, where they walked away across the water until they disappeared. The word &quot;Viracocha&quot; literally means &quot;Sea Foam.&quot;

==Etymology==
&quot;Tiqsi Huiracocha&quot; (Spanish:&quot;Ticsi Viracocha&quot;) may have several meanings. In the Quechuan languages, &quot;tiqsi&quot; means &quot;origin&quot; or &quot;beginning&quot;, &quot;wira&quot; means fat, and &quot;qucha&quot; means lake, sea, or reservoir.
Viracocha&#x27;s many epithets include &quot;great&quot;, &quot;all knowing&quot;, &quot;powerful&quot;, etc.
Some people state that &quot;Wiraqucha&quot; could mean &quot;Fat (or foam) of the sea&quot;, etymology that has been discarded for grammatical considerations (constituent order in Quechua) at least since Inca Garcilaso. According to German archeologist Max Uhle, &quot;foam lake&quot; is an incomprehensible name. He points out that &quot;Vira&quot; (&quot;Huira&quot;) can also be derived from the Quechua word &quot;huyra&quot; (&quot;the end of all things&quot;), and that &quot;Ticsi Viracocha&quot; therefore could have the meaning &quot;lake of origin and of the end of all things&quot;.

Some linguists think that linguistic, historical and archaeological evidence suggest that the name could be a borrowing of Aymara &quot;Wila Quta&quot; (&quot;wila&quot; &quot;blood&quot;; &quot;quta&quot; &quot;lake&quot;), due to the sacrifices of camelids that were celebrated at Lake Titiqaqa by pre-Incan Andean cultures that spoke Aymara.

==Controversy over &quot;White God&quot;==

The first Spanish chroniclers from the 16th century made no mention of any identification with Viracocha. The first to do so was Pedro Cieza de León in 1553. Similar accounts by Spanish chroniclers (e.g. Juan de Betanzos) describe Viracocha as a &quot;white god&quot;, often with a beard. The whiteness of Viracocha is however not mentioned in the native authentic legends of the Incas and most modern scholars therefore had considered the &quot;white god&quot; story to be a post-conquest Spanish invention.
Similarly to the Incan god Viracocha, the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl and several other deities from Central and South American pantheons, like the Muisca god Bochica are described in legends as being bearded. The beard, once believed to be a mark of a prehistoric European influence and quickly fueled and embellished by spirits of the colonial era, had its single significance in the continentally insular culture of Mesoamerica. The &quot;Anales de Cuauhtitlan&quot; is a very important early source which is particularly valuable for having been originally written in Nahuatl. The &quot;Anales de Cuauhtitlan&quot; describes the attire of Quetzalcoatl at Tula:
In this quote the beard is represented as a dressing of feathers, fitting comfortably with academic impressions of Mesoamerican art. The story, however, does not mention whether Quetzalcoatl had facial hair or not with the point of outfitting him with a mask and symbolic feathered beard being to cover his unsightly appearance because as Quetzalcoatl said &quot;If ever my subjects were to see me, they would run away!&quot;

While descriptions of Viracocha&#x27;s physical appearance are open to interpretation, men with beards were frequently depicted by the Peruvian Moche culture in its famous pottery, long before the arrival of the Spanish. Modern advocates of theories such as a pre-Columbian European migration to Peru cite these bearded ceramics and Viracocha&#x27;s beard as being evidence for an early presence of non-Amerindians in Peru. Although most Indians do not have heavy beards, there are groups reported to have included bearded individuals, such as the Aché people of Paraguay, who also have light skin but who are not known to have any admixture with Europeans and Africans. When the Southern Paiute were first contacted by Europeans in 1776, the report by fathers Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and Francisco Atanasio Domínguez noted that &quot;Some of the men had thick beards and were thought to look more in appearance like Spanish men than native Americans&quot;.

== Rock formation at Ollantaytambo==

A rock formation in the small village of Ollantaytambo in southern Peru is said by local legend to be a naturally formed or carved representation of the messenger of Viracocha named Wiracochan or Tunupa. Ollantaytambo, located in the Cusco Region, makes up a chain of small villages along the Urubamba Valley. Known as the Sacred Valley, it was an important stronghold of the Inca Empire. Facing the ancient Inca ruins of Ollantaytambo in the rock face of &quot;Cerro Pinkuylluna&quot; is the 140-metre-high formation said to be a figure of Wiracochan. Inca ruins built on top of the face are also considered to represent a crown on his head. Artists&#x27; impressions of the rock face also include a heavy beard and a large sack upon his shoulders. This legend became fashionable after a 1995 book by Fernando and Edgar Elorrieta Salazar.

Wiracochan, the pilgrim preacher of knowledge, the master of time, is described as a person with superhuman power—a bearded, tall man dressed as a priest or astronomer.

==Conversion to Christianity==

Spanish scholars and chroniclers provide many insights regarding the identity of Viracocha.

# Bartolomé de las Casas states that viracocha means &quot;creator of all things&quot;
# Juan de Betanzos confirms the above in saying that &quot;We may say that Viracocha is God&quot; 
# Polo, Sarmiento de Gamboa, Blas Valera and Acosta all reference Viracocha as a creator
# Guamán Poma, an indigenous chronicler, considers the term &quot;viracocha&quot; to be equivalent to &quot;creator&quot;

Spanish interpreters generally attributed the identity of supreme creator to Viracocha during the initial years of colonization.

The decision to use the term &quot;God&quot; in place of &quot;Viracocha&quot; is seen as the first step in the evangelization of the Incas. The reasoning behind this strategy includes the fact that it was likely difficult to explain the Christian idea of &quot;God&quot; to the Incas, who failed to understand the concept. In addition, replacing reference to Viracocha with &quot;God&quot; facilitated the substitution of the local concept of divinity with Christian theology.

<doc id="90843" wikidata="Q165968" url="?curid=90843" title="Manco Cápac">
<text>Manco Cápac (before ; Quechua: &quot;Manqu Qhapaq&quot;, &quot;the royal founder&quot;), also known as Manco Inca and Ayar Manco, was, according to some historians, the first governor and founder of the Inca civilization in Cusco, possibly in the early 13th century. He is also a main figure of Inca mythology, being the protagonist of the two best known legends about the origin of the Inca, both of them connecting him to the foundation of Cusco. His main wife was his older sister, Mama Uqllu, also the mother of his son and successor Sinchi Ruq&#x27;a. Even though his figure is mentioned in several chronicles, his actual existence remains uncertain.

== Biography ==

=== Origin ===

Manco Cápac was born in Tamputoco, which according to some is located in the present-day province of Paruro, in Peru. The city usually served as a refuge for many people escaping the Aymaran invasions of the Altiplano. His father was named Apu Tambo. Manco Cápac and his family lived a nomadic lifestyle.

=== Foundation of Cusco ===

After the death of his father, Manco Capac had to succeed him as the head of the ayllu, to which belonged several dozens of families. The members of the ayllu were nomads, and the trajectory of their journeys through the Altiplano resembles the journey described in the legend of the Ayar brothers. Upon arriving in the Cusco valley, they defeated three small tribes that lived there; the Sahuares, Huallas and Alcahuisas, and then settled in a swampy area between two small streams, that today corresponds with the main plaza of the city of Cusco. The recently founded city was divided into four districts; Chumbicancha, Quinticancha, Sairecancha and Yarambuycancha.

Manco Cápac&#x27;s tribe, or ayllu, only occupied a small fraction of the Cusco valley, the rest of it being inhabited by larger and more powerful tribes, who often would threaten the city. Located north of the city there was a confederated lordship of Ayarmacas and Pinaguas. All these tribes regarded Manco Cápac and his ayllu as invaders, and would often attack them. Manco Cápac, and later his son and successor Sinchi Roca, would often have to defend the city against the other tribes.

=== Death ===

Manqu Qhapaq died of a natural death and left his son, Sinchi Roca, as his successor in Cusco. His body was mummified and remained in the city until the reign of Pachacuti, who ordered its removal to the Temple of the Sun on Isla del Sol. In Cusco there remained only a statue erected in his honor.

== Mythological origin ==

Manco Cápac is the protagonist of the two main legends that explain the origin of the Inca Empire. Both legends state that he was the founder of the city of Cusco and that his wife was Mama Uqllu.

=== Legend of the Ayar brothers ===
In this legend, Manco Cápac (Ayar Manco) was the son of Viracocha of Paqariq Tampu (six leagues or 25 km south of Cusco). He and his brothers (Ayar Auca, Ayar Cachi and Ayar Uchu) and sisters (Mama Ocllo, Mama Huaco, Mama Raua and Mama Ipacura) lived near Cusco at Paqariq Tampu, and they united their people with other tribes encountered in their travels. They sought to conquer the tribes of the Cusco Valley. This legend also incorporates the golden staff, thought to have been given to Manco Cápac by his father. Accounts vary, but according to some versions of the legend, the Manco got rid of his three brothers, trapping them or turning them into stone, thus becoming the leader of Cusco. He married his older sister, Mama Occlo, and they begot a son named Sinchi Roca.

=== Legend of Manqu Qhapaq and Mama Ocllo ===
In this second legend, Manco Cápac was a son of the sun god Inti and the moon goddess Mama Killa, and brother of Pacha Kamaq. Manco Cápac himself was worshipped as a fire and a Sun God. According to the Inti legend, Manco Cápac and his siblings were sent up to the earth by the sun god and emerged from the cave of Pacaritambo carrying a golden staff, called &quot;tapac-yauri&quot;. Instructed to create a Temple of the Sun in the spot where the staff sank into the earth, they traveled to Cusco via caves and there built a temple in honour of their father Inti.

However, given the absence of a written tradition recounting this tale before the publication of &quot;Comentarios Reales de los Incas&quot; by Garcilaso de la Vega in the year 1609, the authenticity of this legend as a legitimate Incan legend is questioned.

== In fiction ==
&quot;The Son of the Sun&quot; (1987), the first Scrooge McDuck comic book story written and drawn by Don Rosa, features Manco Cápac as the original owner of various lost treasures.

In the first sentence of Herman Melville&#x27;s novel &quot;The Confidence-Man&quot; (1857) the sudden appearance at sunrise on April 1 of a mysterious fictional character is compared to Cápac&#x27;s appearance out of Lake Titicaca.

In P.B. Kerr&#x27;s &quot;Eye of the Forest&quot;, the fifth book in the &quot;Children of the Lamp&quot; series, Manco Cápac is said to be a powerful Djinn who took his place as a god amongst the Incas by displaying his power of matter manipulation.

In British author Anthony Horowitz&#x27;s fantasy-thriller book series &quot;The Power of Five&quot;, Manco Cápac is the son of Inti, and one of five children destined to keep the universe safe from the forces of evil. Cápac is reincarnated in the 21st century as a Peruvian street beggar called Pedro.

Kuzco, the main character from &quot;Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot;, in the first version of the movie &quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot; was supposed to be named Manco Cápac.

==Heritage==
The car float &quot;Manco Capac&quot; operates across Lake Titicaca between PeruRail&#x27;s railhead at Puno and the port of Guaqui in Bolivia.

<text>In Inca mythology, Mama Ocllo, or more precisely Mama Uqllu, was deified as a mother and fertility goddess. In one legend she was a daughter of Inti and Mama Killa, and in another the daughter of Viracocha (Wiraqucha) and Mama Qucha. In all of them she was the older sister and wife of Manco Cápac (Manqu Qhapaq), whom she established the city of Cusco with. In some variations, she also had a son with him, Sinchi Roca, though all Incan rulers after Manco Cápac were believed to be their descendants.

According to most stories, Mama Occlo and Manco Cápac were sent by Inti to help the Inca by expanding their knowledge after he saw how poorly they were living. After their creation, most legends state, they began journeying to find the perfect location to begin their task, and would know when they had found it when the golden rod Inti had given both his children sank into the ground. Once the rod had sunk, they began educating the Inca people; together they taught the people to better construct homes; Mama Ocllo taught the Inca women the art of spinning thread, sewing, and household duties.

== Origin ==
There are multiple variations of Mama Ocllo&#x27;s origin. One common version involves Mama Ocllo emerging with Manco Cápac from an island or cave in Lake Titicaca after Inti created them, though in some alternate versions, the rest of their siblings, as well as ten ayllus, rise from the lake, too, and they all journey together for a short time. Some myths depict Mama Ocllo and Manco Cápac&#x27;s place of origin to be from the Rock of Origins, which is a location described as sacred. Some accounts also state that both Mama Ocllo and Manco Cápac were Inti&#x27;s children by the Moon.

Another account tells how Mama Ocllo and her siblings were all brought into existence by Inti, though this time they emerged from the middle of three windows on a cave known as Pacariqtambo, and were given a sign when they approached the land they were supposed to settle on rather than a rod to prod the ground with. 

Instead of Inti, one legend says that Mama Ocllo is the daughter of Viracocha and Mama Qucha, making her a sibling of Inti.

There are historical accounts, including those recorded by Vasco Núñez de Balboa, Juan de Betanzos, and Fray Martin de Morua, that described Mama Ocllo and Manco Cápac as leaders of a group of people (the Ayar clan) who came from the Tampu Tocco area.

== Founding of Cuzco ==
According to the legend, Mama Ocllo and Manco Capac were given a golden scepter to help them find an ideal place to settle and worship the sun. After their wanderings, the pair descended into a valley. They decided to build the city of Cuzco after the golden rod they brought with them sank into the soil and disappeared. The pair then set out to gather people and brought them to the city. They instructed them in the ways of human beings and the people were divided according to whether they could gather food or build houses. The people also built the Coricancha (temple of the Sun), also referred to as the Intihuasi, at the center of the new imperial city or - as some sources say - where the rod disappeared.

<text>Pachacámac () is an archaeological site southeast of Lima, Peru in the Valley of the Lurín River. The site was first settled around A.D. 200 and was named after the &quot;Earth Maker&quot; creator god Pacha Kamaq. The site flourished for about 1,300 years until the Spanish invaded. Pachacamac covers about 600 hectares (1480 acres) of land.

==Pacha Kamaq deity==

Pacha Kamaq (&#x27;Earth-Maker&#x27;) was considered the creator god by the people who lived in this part of Peru before the Inca conquest. The Inca received him into their pantheon, but he was never an equal of &quot;Viracocha&quot;, whom they viewed as more powerful.
The myths that survive of Pacha Kamaq are sparse and confused: some accounts, for example, identify him as Manco Cápac&#x27;s cowardly brother Ayca, while others say that he, Manco Cápac and Viracocha were the sole three sons of &quot;Inti&quot;, the sun god. Another story says that he made the first man and the first woman, but forgot to give them food – and when the man died and the woman prayed over Pachacamac&#x27;s head, to his father Inti to make her the mother of all the peoples of earth, Pachacamac was furious. One by one, as the children were born, he tried to kill them – only to be beaten and to be thrown into the sea by her hero-son &quot;Wichama&quot;, after which Pachacamac gave up the struggle and contented himself by becoming the supreme god of fish.

==Pyramids of Pachacamac==
In the 1890s archaeologists first began exploring Pachacamac. They found many enormous buildings and burial sites that had been previously looted. The first (sacred) section of the site includes temples of religious significance and a large cemetery. The second section includes several buildings which are mainly secular pyramids. In this complex of buildings there were mud-brick stepped pyramids with ramps and plazas. These buildings are dated between the late 1300s and the mid-1400s.

The three most famous pyramids are all found in the sacred sector (the first sector). These are the Painted Temple, the Temple of the Sun, and the Old Temple of Pachacamac.

According to Peter Eekhout, an archaeologist who studied and excavated the site of Pachacamac, &quot;For decades most scholars thought the pyramids (from the second section) were religious &quot;embassies&quot; that housed delegations from far-off communities who came to worship, bring tribute, and make offerings to Pachacamac&quot;. However, Eekhout came to a different conclusion after his work at the site. Eekhout and his team found that the structures lacked the features that characterized religious centers of the time. He concluded that the structures were used as palaces for the Ychsma (EESH-ma), the rulers of Pachacamac.

===Pachacamac Idol===
In 1938, an archaeologist found a 7.6-foot-long (2.34 meters) idol, which has a diameter of 5.1 inches (13 centimeters), at the Painted Temple, an object that was allegedly destroyed by Hernando Pizarro. Carbon-14 dating found that the idol dated to about A.D. 760 to 876, the time of the Wari Empire and that it had once been painted with cinnabar.

===Temple of the Sun===
The Temple of the Sun (seen below) is 30,000m squared in size and is in the shape of a trapezoid. It has the common step pyramid architecture which forms terraces around the structure. This temple has been dated to the time of Inca control over Pachacamac. Some archaeologists believe human sacrifices may have taken place at this the Temple. Sacrifices of women and children were found in an Inca cemetery within a portion of the structure. Burial goods found with the sacrifices point to the sacrifices originating from coastal societies. Unfortunately archaeologists are limited in their knowledge of this site because the Temple of the Sun and many other pyramids at Pachacamac have been irreversibly damaged by looting and the &quot;El Niño&quot; weather phenomenon.

===Old Temple===
The Old Temple, also called the Temple of Pachacamac, is the oldest building in Pachacamac. It is built on a rocky promontory and is characterized by the massive use of small bricks of raw adobe dated to the Early Intermediate period, under the influence of the Lima culture (3rd to 7th centuries AD).

===Other structures===
Most of the common buildings and temples were built c. 800-1450 CE, shortly before the arrival and conquest by the Inca Empire.

=== Grave sites ===
Archaeologists have uncovered multiple grave sites. These sites may date to different periods of Pachacamac&#x27;s history are located in different parts of the city. In the Southeastern part area, in the Temple of Inti (The Inca Sun God), archeologists have found a cemetery that was set apart for the &quot;mamacuna&quot; (Virgins for the Sun), women who had important status. These women wove textiles for priests, and brewed corn beer which was used in Inca festivals. The women were sacrificed in the highest ritual. They were strangled with cotton garrote – some women still had the cotton twisted around their neck when their bodies were discovered – then wrapped in fine cloth and buried in stone tombs. Each was surrounded by offerings from the highlands of Peru, such as coca, quinoa, and cayenne peppers. In 2012, Belgian archeologists found a 1,000 year-old tomb in front of Pachacamac containing over 80 skeletons and mummies, many of which were infants. The tomb contained offerings such as ceramic vessels, copper and gold alloy objects, wooden masks, and dogs and guinea pigs.

In 2019, archaeologists have found a 1,000 year-old cemetery in this area. Director of the Ychsma Project Professor Peter Eeckhout reported that the human remains were massively buried with various items and ceramics. Physical anthropologists headed by Dr. Lawrence Owens specified the mummies.

:&quot;Most of the people at the site had hard lives, with various fractures, bad backs, bad hips ... but the individuals from this cemetery show a higher than usual concentration of tuberculosis, syphilis, and really serious bone breaks that would have had major impacts on their lives. Still, the fact that most of these are healed – and that disease sufferers survived for a long time – suggests that they were being cared for, and that even in the sites&#x27; early history people felt a duty of care towards those less fortunate than themselves.&quot;.

==Outside influences==
The Huari ( 600–800 CE) reconstructed the city, probably using it as an administrative center. A number of Huari-influenced designs appear on the structures and on the ceramics and textiles found in the cemeteries of this period. After the collapse of the Huari empire, Pachacamac continued to grow as a religious center. The majority of the common architecture and temples were built during this later stage ( 800–1450 CE).

The Inca Empire invaded Pachacamac and took over the site around 1470. For the Inca, Pachacamac was extremely important to religion as well as an important administration center. When the Inca started their conquest, they had their own creation god, Viracocha. However, out of respect for the religion of their conquered people, the Inca entered Pacha Kamaq into their religion, but Pacha Kamaq and Viracocha were not equals, Viracocha was believed to be more powerful. Still, Pachacamac was allowed an unusual amount of independence from the Inca Empire.

By the time the &quot;Tawantinsuyu&quot; (Inca Empire) invaded the area, the valleys of the Rímac and Lurín had a small state which the people called &quot;Ichma&quot;. They used Pachacamac primarily as a religious site for the veneration of &quot;Pacha Kamaq&quot;, the creator god. The Ichma joined the Incan Empire along with Pachacamac. The Inca maintained the site as a religious shrine and allowed the Pachacamac priests to continue functioning independently of the Inca priesthood. This included the oracle, whom the Inca presumably consulted. The Inca built five additional buildings, including a temple to the sun on the main square.

Archaeologists believe pilgrims may have played a part in life at Pachacamac for a couple of thousand years before the Inca claimed the site as part of their empire.

==Spanish invasion==
At sites like Pachacamac, the Spanish used local resentment of the Inca as a tactic for overthrowing Inca rule.

After the Battle of Cajamarca, Francisco Pizarro sent his brother Hernando Pizarro, and fourteen horsemen, to Pachacamac to collect its gold riches. According to Cieza, the priests learned of the Spanish defilement of the Cuzco temple, and &quot;ordered the virgin &quot;mamaconas&quot; to leave the Temple of the Sun&quot;, from where they say the priests also removed more than four hundred &quot;cargas&quot; of gold. They hid the treasures and it has not appeared to this day. Hernando departed Cajamarca on 5 January 1533, and returned on 14 April 1533, after defiling the temple. On the return trip through the Jauja Valley, he accepted the surrender of Chalcuchimac.

&quot;In a few years the walls of the temple were pulled down by the Spanish settlers, who found there a convenient quarry for their own edifices.&quot;

==In popular culture==
* &quot;Pachacamac&quot; was the name of the ship that carried the abducted Professor Calculus in &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. In the next book, &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;, Pachacamac was the name of the Sun god worshiped by an ancient Incan tribe still active in South America. In the sixth book, &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;, a wooden head of Pachacamac is exhibited in the museum of Ethnography in Brussels.
* A character in the video game &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; is named Pachacamac after the ancient ruin.
* Pachacamac was also the name of the main villain in &quot;Juken Sentai Gekiranger vs. Boukenger&quot;, a crossover direct-to-video movie.

<doc id="90875" wikidata="Q1277966" url="?curid=90875" title="Ithobaal I">
<text>Ithobaal I is the name of a 9th-century BCE king of Tyre mentioned in the story of Jezebel from the Hebrew Bible, and in a citation by Josephus of a list of the kings of Tyre put together by the Phoenician author Menander of Ephesus (2nd century BCE).

==Sources and chronology==
Primary information related to Ithobaal comes from Josephus&#x27;s citation of the Phoenician author Menander of Ephesus, in &quot;Against Apion&quot; i.18. Here it is said that the previous king, Phelles, “was slain by Ithobalus, the priest of Astarte, who reigned thirty-two years, and lived sixty-eight years; he was succeeded by his son Badezorus (Baal-Eser II).”

Based on the work of F. M. Cross and other scholars who take 825 BC as the date of Dido&#x27;s flight from her brother Pygmalion, after which she founded the city of Carthage in 814 BC, Ithobaal was born in 915 BC, killed King Phelles and assumed the throne in 883 BC, and died in 847 or 846 BC.

==Relation to Ahab of Israel==
Ithobaal held close diplomatic contacts with king Ahab of Israel. 1 Kings 16:31 relates that his daughter Jezebel married Ahab (874 – 853 BC), and Phoenician influence in Samaria and the other Israelite cities was extensive. In 1 Kings Ithobaal is labeled king of the Sidonians. At this time Tyre and Sidon were consolidated into one kingdom.

==Indirect Assyrian sources==
Tyre is not mentioned as an opponent of Shalmaneser III at the Battle of Qarqar in 853 BC, but twelve years later, in 841, Ithobaal&#x27;s son Baal-Eser II gave tribute to the Assyrian monarch.

==Doubts on historicity==
For decades, it was believed Ithobaal was mentioned in the inscription found on the Ahiram sarcophagus as the titular king&#x27;s heir; however, more recent transcriptions of the text reconstruct the heir&#x27;s name as &quot;Pilsibaal&quot; and not &quot;Ithobaal&quot; — which has raised questions about Ithobaal&#x27;s paternity and historicity.

<doc id="90884" wikidata="Q3648017" url="?curid=90884" title="Pariacaca (god)">
<text>In Incan and pre-Incan mythology, Pariacaca (contemporary Quechua spelling: &quot;Parya Qaqa&quot;) was a god of storms, as well as a creator god. His life is described in the first chapter of the Huarochirí Manuscript.

== Mythology ==
There are many versions of the myths around Pariacaca.

In one version, five eggs appeared on the summit of the sacred mountain Kuntur Quta, from which hatched Pariacaca and his brothers. Pariacaca&#x27;s first action was to call down a great flood to punish a rich man who had declared himself a god. Before the floods arrived, Pariacaca, dressed as a beggar, went down to a fiesta at a pueblo near Huarochirí where he was ignored by everyone except for one compassionate woman. In return for her kindness, Pariacaca told the woman that the floods would destroy everyone in five days and allowed her, her children, and her immediate family to flee to higher grounds so long as she did not warn anyone else about the floods.

In another version, Pariacaca is the father of a person, also dressed in beggar&#x27;s rags, named Huathiacuri. Huathiacuri cured a rich man of an illness and was rewarded with the younger of the rich man&#x27;s two daughters. Huathiacuri was challenged by his brother-in-law to a battle of wits and his father Pariacaca, who was one of five sacred eggs on the mountain Kuntur Quta and an oracle, advised him to accept the challenge.

According to the legend that speaks about this god and his generosity, Pariacaca saw a humble man crying sitting on the shore so he stopped his divine life and came down from the world of the gods to see what was wrong. He approached him and dared to ask him the reason for his melancholy. He answered that the god Wallallu Qarhwinchu had threatened his people with burning the town if they did not give him human sacrifices since, previously, they had been offering them dogs (even, under the belief of some, the huancas themselves fed on these animals and that is why the huancas used to be called &quot;dog-eaters&quot;). Pariacaca confronted Wallallu, the god of fire, for being the divinity of the people and in the battle Pariacaca was the winner because he was able to extinguish his fireballs with the rains, which banished him and condemned him to eat carrion. Before this victory, the god Pariacaca became very adored in the town for freeing them from the god Wallallu, who was sentenced to eat dogs for having been a devourer of men.

==Politics==
Like all of the High Plains, and almost all of Wyoming, Weston County is overwhelmingly Republican. Since Wyoming statehood in 1890, it has been carried by a Democrat just three times. Woodrow Wilson carried the county in 1912 as a result of a split between the conservative incumbent William Howard Taft and Progressive ex-President Theodore Roosevelt, whilst in his two 1930s landslides Franklin D. Roosevelt became the other Democrat to win Weston County, although he defeated Republican Alf Landon in 1936 by just 109 votes.

Subsequent to Lyndon Johnson losing the county to Barry Goldwater by just fifty-four votes in 1964, no Democrat has passed 35 percent of Weston County&#x27;s vote. Indeed, Bill Clinton in 1996 was the last Democratic to pass twenty percent.












The Wyoming Department of Corrections Wyoming Honor Conservation Camp &amp; Boot Camp is located in Newcastle. The facility was operated by the Wyoming Board of Charities and Reform until that agency was dissolved as a result of a state constitutional amendment passed in November 1990.

<text>In the Quechua, Aymara, and Inca mythologies,  (from &quot;shadow&quot;; ) was originally an ambivalent spirit, both benevolent and harmful, a denizen of the Incan netherworld (Ukhu Pacha) who might enter the world of the living as &quot;shadow&quot;, perhaps attempting to bring someone as companion into the world of the dead.

Some explain Supay as a single spirit or god of the subterranean realm. Either way, in the Spanish Christianized conception the Supay was turned more or less into the Devil or demons living in Hell.

== Etymology ==
The anonymous dictionary of 1586 defines the term as &quot;shadow&quot; (), as do Father Diego González Holguín (1608) under &quot;&quot; and under &quot;&quot; Jorge A. Lira (1945) and Jesús Lara (1971). In early Quechua-Spanish usage, the sense of &quot;shadow&quot; or &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;anima&quot; is followed.

Other forms include: , , , .

== Origins ==
Among the indigenous Quechua people, &quot;Supay&quot; originally denoted a spirit that could both do good and do harm (they would try to appease the spirit they feared and worshiped). This sense had not been lost to Friar Domingo de Santo Tomás whose dictionary glossed the term as both &quot;good angel&quot; and &quot;bad angel&quot; in his &quot;Lexicón&quot; (1560), and only the spirit he qualified as bad, i.e., &quot;evil supay&quot; corresponded to devils, as according to the quoted sermon about fallen angels inserted in the dictionary. However, the Christianized Spaniards went on to apply the term &quot;supay&quot; conveniently to mean strictly &quot;devil&quot;.

The original Supay could be benevolent towards the living whom he liked, or those who suffered a dignified death. But he could be a terrible and evil being for any of the rest, both in the underworld and in the earthly world, and he could tip the scales of bad luck by whim alone.

In the more original conception, the &quot;supay&quot; dwelled in the netherworld called &quot;Ura Pacha&quot; (or Uku Pacha, in the Incan three-world view) but the &quot;supaya&quot; as living &quot;shadows&quot; (as per the meaning of the word) may wander into the world of the living (&quot;Kay Pacha&quot;, &#x27;Hereworld&#x27;) to &quot;gather companions&quot; into the world of the dead. The &quot;supaya&quot; is (typically) the soul of an ancestor, and may assist the living by providing counsel for proper conduct in order to achieve peace (in death). The supaya represents a necessary force of nature that wither things in order to bring about new life.

Just as the Supay became the Devil through the prism of Christianity, the Viracocha, which originally designated a whole legion of primordial ancestors who came out of Lake Titicaca, was turned into the equivalent of the one monotheistic Creator God,

==Modern Andean-Christian belief==
The name Supay is now roughly translated into &quot;diablo&quot; (Spanish for devil) in most Southern American countries.

Some commentary regards the Supay as a single God of Death of the Uku Pacha (inner world), the &quot;god of the mountains&quot;, or &quot;the spirit or god who lived in the earth&quot;.

What appears to be the case is there is conflation between the Supay, regarded as a trickster deity, and El Tío (q.v.), the Bolivian god of the underworld and the mines. While scholarly argument postulates Tío to have been a sort of Spanish invented frightening god/boogeyman and thus a corruption of , the popular notion is that the miners avoid the derogatory &quot;supay&quot; and call him Tío, or &quot;uncle&quot;. The name is sometimes concatenated as &quot;Tío Supay&quot; or &quot;Uncle Supay&quot;.

It has been commented that in the early 20th century, the Aymara were more prone to worship the Supay akin to old tradition, and the Quechua more likely to regard it as a disgusting creature.

In some areas of Peru, where the cult of the Virgin of Candelaria is celebrated, she became controller of lightning who frightens away the devilish Supay (early 20th century). This Catholic Virgin Mother is the Pachamama&#x27;s counterpart, just as the Devil is the replacement for Supay. 

== Mining communities ==

Supay is given original meaning in the miner&#x27;s communities, with Tío or Supay recognized as the lord of the mines, sometimes conflated together into figure of Tío Supay, as already discussed. And the Virgin of the Mineshaft (Virgen del Socavón) is the mining communities&#x27; alias of the Virgin of Candelaria previously discussed.

In Oruro, Bolivia, the Carnaval de Oruro features the &quot;diablada&quot; dance with the Supay cast in the role of its most important devil The carnival dance may also feature the &quot;china supay&quot; or &quot;she-devils&quot; of overtly sexual nature that used to be performed by men.

In the miners&#x27; lore, Tío was the king of the underground (), and Chinasupay the she-devil his wife, according to Victor Montoya, and he sees some parallels with the Hades-Persephone myth here.

==Retablos==
Vintage Andean household altars or &quot;retablos&quot; typically depicted two of the aforementioned three worlds, but more recent altars depict all three, with the lowest floor, Uku Pacha, of the lost souls of the deceased and demonical beings. The supay-devils are portrayed as goat-men with wings and long claws on hands and hind feet. There are also winged angels depicted, but the indigenous faith regards this not so much as the battle between good and evil but as striking balance between natural forces.

Uinta County was created on December 1, 1869, by the legislature of the Wyoming Territory, with its temporary seat located at Fort Bridger.
Originally, it ran along the entire western border of Wyoming, including Yellowstone National Park. The county was named for Utah&#x27;s Uinta Mountains, which are noticeable from many places in the county. The county was given its present boundaries in 1911 when Lincoln County was carved out of the northern part of Uinta County.

==Geography==

===Geology===
The 161 km wide western North American Fold and thrust belt extends from Alaska to Mexico, forming several northerly trending thrust faults in southwest Wyoming, including the Crawford, Absaroka and Hogsback (Darby), which formed from the Late Jurassic through the early Eocene. The Painter Reservoir Field was discovered in 1977 from the 407 m thick Nuggest Sandstone which forms an anticline structural trap in the hanging wall of the Absaroka thrust plate, at a depth of about 3 km.

<text>Teton County is a county in the U.S. state of Wyoming. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 23,331. Its county seat is Jackson. Its west boundary line is also the Wyoming state boundary shared with Idaho and the southern tip of Montana. Teton County is part of the Jackson, WY-ID Micropolitan Statistical Area. Teton County contains the Jackson Hole ski area, all of Grand Teton National Park, and 40.4% of Yellowstone National Park&#x27;s total area, including over 96.6% of its water area (largely in Yellowstone Lake).

==History==
Teton County was created February 15, 1921, from a portion of Lincoln County. Its governing organization was completed in 1922. The county was named for the Teton Range. The county was created because the inhabitants lived too far away from Kemmerer, the county seat of Lincoln County. The creation of the county required a special act of the Wyoming Legislature, because the area was too poor and had too few people to qualify for county status under the normal requirements.

==Geography==
According to the US Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (5.2%) is water.

==Politics==
Liz Skalka of the &quot;Huffpost&quot; described Teton as a &quot;liberal county&quot; in August 2022. Previously a staunchly Republican county, which produced Governor and U.S. Senator Clifford Hansen, a mass immigration of wealthy liberals from the West Coast has made Teton County the most Democratic county in Wyoming, which is one of the most Republican states in the nation. The only Republican presidential candidate since 1992 to win Teton County was George W. Bush in 2000 who had county resident Dick Cheney on the ticket. In the 2008 election, Barack Obama carried Teton County by a 23.6 percentage point margin over John McCain, with McCain winning statewide by a 32.2 percentage point margin over Obama, his widest margin in any state. Albany County, which includes the University of Wyoming at Laramie, was the only other county in the state to have backed Obama. In 2004, Teton was the only Wyoming county won by John F. Kerry over George W. Bush. In the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 57.9%–31.1%. In 2020, Joe Biden beat Donald Trump by 37.5%, the largest margin for a Democrat ever in the county. The county has, however, voted at times for Republican candidates for the governorship and United States Senate. Most recently, the county voted for Republican Mark Gordon for governor in 2022, although by the slimmest margin of any county in Wyoming.

==Religion==

*&quot;Nones&quot; is an unclear category. It is a heterogenous group of the not religious and intermittently religious. Researchers argue that most of the &quot;Nones&quot; should be considered &quot;unchurched&quot;, rather than objectively nonreligious; especially since most &quot;Nones&quot; do hold some religious-spiritual beliefs and a notable amount participate in behaviors. For example, 72% of American &quot;Nones&quot; believe in God or a Higher Power.

==Education==
There are three school districts with portions of Sweetwater County: Sweetwater County School District Number 1, Sweetwater County School District Number 2, and Carbon County School District 1.

Some residents of Sweetwater County District 2 attend schools in the Daggett School District of Utah. DSD stated that, as per its agreement with Sweetwater County District 2, &quot;DSD schools are the home school for all students living in Washam, Wyoming.&quot; Additionally, students in McKinnon, Wyoming may choose to attend DSD schools.

Sweetwater is also home to Western Wyoming Community College which is located in Rock Springs.

==Politics and government==
Sweetwater County was a Democratic stronghold in Wyoming until recent years (owing to its unionized mining industry), voting Democratic in eleven consecutive presidential elections between 1928 and 1968, after supporting Progressive Robert La Follette Sr. in 1924. In 1928, 1952, 1956 and 1976 it was the only Wyoming county to support the Democratic presidential nominee.

Nonetheless, no Democratic presidential candidate has won Sweetwater County since Bill Clinton in 1996. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won just 18.9 percent of the vote in the county. At the state level, Sweetwater County is represented by a Republican delegation in the Wyoming House of Representatives,and three Republicans in the Wyoming Senate.

<text>In Inca mythology, Vichama is the god of death and the son of Inti. His mother was murdered by his half-brother Pacha Kamaq, and he took revenge by turning the humans who were created by Pachacamac into rocks and islands. Afterwards he hatched three eggs from which a new race of humans was born.

The name has been adopted by a theatre group from Villa El Salvador, Lima, Peru, which works worldwide, raising issues involving social responsibility and involvement.

<doc id="90901" wikidata="Q654425" url="?curid=90901" title="Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome">
<text>Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome (WFS) is defined as adrenal gland failure due to hemorrhages in the adrenal glands, commonly caused by sepsis. Typically, the bacteria responsible for triggering the bleeding is &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot;.

The bacterial infection leads to massive bleeding into one or both adrenal glands. Bilateral adrenal gland hemorrhaging is more common. It is characterized by overwhelming bacterial infection meningococcemia leading to massive blood invasion, organ failure, coma, low blood pressure and shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with widespread purpura, rapidly developing adrenocortical insufficiency and death.

==Signs and symptoms==
Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome can be caused by a number of different organisms (see below). When caused by &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot;, WFS is considered the most severe form of meningococcal sepsis. The onset of the illness is nonspecific with fever, rigors, vomiting, and headache. Soon a rash appears; first macular, not much different from the rose spots of typhoid, and rapidly becoming petechial and purpuric with a dusky gray color. Low blood pressure (hypotension) develops and rapidly leads to septic shock. The cyanosis of extremities can be extreme and the patient is very prostrated or comatose. In this form of meningococcal disease, meningitis generally does not occur. Low levels of blood glucose and sodium, high levels of potassium in the blood, and the ACTH stimulation test demonstrate the acute adrenal failure. Leukocytosis need not be extreme and in fact leukopenia may be seen and it is a very poor prognostic sign. C-reactive protein levels can be elevated or almost normal. Thrombocytopenia is sometimes extreme, with alteration in prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) suggestive of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Acidosis and acute kidney failure can be seen as in any severe sepsis. Meningococci can be readily cultured from blood or cerebrospinal fluid, and can sometimes be seen in smears of cutaneous lesions. Difficulty swallowing, atrophy of the tongue, and cracks at the corners of the mouth are also characteristic features.

==Causes==
Multiple species of bacteria can be associated with the condition:
* Meningococcus is another term for the bacterial species &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot;; blood infection with said species usually underlies WFS. While many infectious agents can infect the adrenals, an acute, selective infection is usually meningococcus.
* &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; can also cause WFS.
* WFS can also be caused by &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; infections, a common bacterial pathogen typically associated with meningitis in the adult and elderly population.
* &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; could also cause WFS. Tubercular invasion of the adrenal glands could cause hemorrhagic destruction of the glands and cause mineralocorticoid deficiency.
* &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; has recently also been implicated in pediatric WFS.
* It can also be associated with &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;.
* Adrenal hemorrhage characteristic of the Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome has been identified in several autopsies of patients who died of sepsis secondary to capnocytophaga canimorsus infection. 

Viruses may also be implicated in adrenal problems:
* Cytomegalovirus can cause adrenal insufficiency, especially in the immunocompromised.
* Ebola virus infection may also cause similar acute adrenal failure.
==Diagnosis==

Diagnostic criteria are based on clinical features of adrenal insufficiency as well as identifying the causal agent. If the causal agent is suspected to be meningitis a lumbar puncture is performed. If the causal agent is suspected to be bacterial a blood culture and complete blood count is performed. An adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test can be performed to assess adrenal function.

==Prevention==
Routine vaccination against meningococcus is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for all 11- to 18-year-olds and people who have poor splenic function (who, for example, have had their spleen removed or who have sickle-cell disease which damages the spleen), or who have certain immune disorders, such as a complement deficiency.

==Treatment==
Fulminant infection from meningococcal bacteria in the bloodstream is a medical emergency and requires emergent treatment with vasopressors, fluid resuscitation, and appropriate antibiotics. Benzylpenicillin was once the drug of choice with chloramphenicol as a good alternative in allergic patients. Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic commonly employed today. Hydrocortisone can sometimes reverse the adrenal insufficiency. Amputations, reconstructive surgery, and tissue grafting are sometimes needed as a result of tissue necrosis (typically of the extremities) caused by the infection.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis of Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome varies by severity of the illness. Around 15% of patients with significant acute bilateral adrenal bleeding experience a fatal outcome. In cases where diagnosis and appropriate treatment are delayed, the case fatality rate approaches 50%. Recovery is possible with appropriate, timely management of the illness. Mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid treatments may be necessary depending on the recovering patient&#x27;s electrolyte status and response to treatment. Research shows that people with adrenal hemorrhage can regain adrenal function to some degree.

==History==
Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome is named after Rupert Waterhouse (1873–1958), an English physician, and Carl Friderichsen (1886–1979), a Danish pediatrician, who wrote papers on the syndrome, which had been previously described.

<doc id="90902" wikidata="Q156385" url="?curid=90902" title="Park County, Wyoming">
<text>Park County is a county in the U.S. state of Wyoming. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 29,624. The county seat is Cody. Park County is a major tourism destination. The county has over 53 percent of Yellowstone National Park&#x27;s land area. Many attractions abound, including the Buffalo Bill Historical Center, the Cody Stampede Rodeo, the Ghost Town of Kirwin, and the western museum Old Trail Town.

==History==
Wyoming gained separate territorial status in 1868. Before that, most of the state&#x27;s area was included in either Laramie County (part of the Dakota Territory) or as unorganized territory within the Dakota Territory. Wyoming Territory was established on July 25, 1868, at which time Laramie County was assigned to this jurisdiction. The area now known as Park County was established as Carter County, then Sweetwater County. In 1884 it was assigned to Fremont County; this continued until 1896, when it was assigned to Big Horn County.

Wyoming achieved statehood in 1890. The area of present-day Park continued as part of Big Horn County until 1909, when Park County was authorized. The county governing structure was put in place during 1911; a courthouse was constructed 1911–1912. An addition to the building was completed in 1983, and the complete building was restored in 1985.
 The county was named for Yellowstone National Park which is mostly within the limits of Park County.

Immigrants from Ireland and Germany settled in what would become Park County in the 1870s. Immigrants from England were the largest immigrant group in Park County in the late 1800s and early 1900s. In 1911 when the county was organized the largest population group in the county were first generation English immigrants and their Wyoming-born children. Many English immigrants who had settled in Wyoming and become American citizens remained connected to England, many of the children of these English immigrants who had been born and raised in Wyoming joined the Canadian military in order to fight alongside Britain during World War I, and subsequently, when America joined the war many volunteered to join the United States military before the U.S. officially instituted a draft.

In 1913, Hot Springs County was created from portions of Park County, Big Horn County, and Fremont County. Park County also had minor boundary adjustments in 1929 and 1931, but otherwise its boundaries have remained unchanged.

==Geography==
Much of Park County is held under state or federal control. Most of the Shoshone National Forest, the first national forest, and a portion of Yellowstone National Park, the first national park, fall within Park County boundaries. Three rivers flow through Park County: the Greybull and Shoshone Rivers which are tributaries to the Big Horn River, and the Clark&#x27;s Fork River which flows into the Yellowstone River.

According to the US Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.4%) is water.

<text>Natrona County is a county in the U.S. state of Wyoming. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 79,955, making it the second-most populous county in Wyoming. Its county seat is Casper. Natrona County comprises the Casper, WY Metropolitan Statistical Area. In 2010, the center of population of Wyoming was in Natrona County, near Alcova.

==History==
Prior to Wyoming&#x27;s settlement by European-based populations, the area&#x27;s stretches played host to nomadic tribes such as Cheyenne, Arapaho, Shoshone, and Sioux.

New York investor John Jacob Astor established the settlement of Astoria on the Columbia River, and sent Robert Stuart eastward to blaze a trail and lay the foundation of a string of trading posts. Stuart documented the South Pass Route through the Continental Divide, near the SW corner of present-day Natrona County. Stuart&#x27;s company erected the first hut in the area in 1812, near present-day Bessemer Bend.

In 1840, Father Pierre-Jean De Smet began preaching the Christian teaching to this area&#x27;s indigenous peoples. He carved his name on Independence Rock and called it &quot;The Register of the Desert&quot;. Later explorers who inscribed the rock include John C. Frémont (1843), who explored the country along the Platte and Sweetwater Rivers.

The first Euro-American settlement occurred in the Casper area in the late 19th century. Natrona County was created by the legislature of the Wyoming Territory on March 9, 1888, and it was organized in 1890. The land for Natrona County was annexed from Carbon County.

Natrona County was named for the deposits of natron found in the area. According to George Mitchell, first mayor of Casper and member of the organization commission for Natrona County, the name was first suggested &quot;by my old friend the late Cy Iba, who at one time owned the soda lakes.&quot; In 1909, Natrona County gained land from Fremont County. The boundaries were adjusted slightly in 1911 and 1931, and at that point the county gained its present outline.

==Politics==
Like almost all of Wyoming, Natrona is a heavily Republican county. It is rather conservative for an urban county, having gone Republican in all but three elections since 1944. No Democratic presidential candidate has won forty percent of the county&#x27;s vote since Lyndon Johnson garnered 52 percent in his 1964 landslide against Barry Goldwater. Bill Clinton did win a 100-vote plurality in the 1992 election due to a significant third-party vote. In 2024, Donald Trump received 72.7% of the vote, the county&#x27;s highest vote percentage for any presidential candidate since Wyoming statehood in 1890.













Natrona County is governed by a commission, based in the county seat of Casper. The five-member board consists of commissioners, elected to staggered four-year terms.

* John Lawson (Vice-chairman) – Republican
* Matt Keating – Republican
* Rob Hendry – Republican
* Steve Schlager – Republican

<text>Laramie County is a county located at the southeast corner of the state of Wyoming. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 100,512 or 17.4% of the state&#x27;s total 2020 population, making it the most populous county in Wyoming, but the least populous county in the United States to be the most populous in its state. The county seat is Cheyenne, the state capital. The county lies west of the Nebraska state line and north of the Colorado state line. Laramie County comprises the Cheyenne, WY Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city of Laramie, Wyoming, is in neighboring Albany County.

==History==
Laramie County was originally created in 1867 as a county within the Dakota Territory. The county was named for Jacques La Ramee, a French-Canadian fur-trader. In 1867, a portion of Laramie County was annexed to create Sweetwater County; in 1868; further annexations occurred to create Albany County and Carbon County. Laramie County became a county in the Wyoming Territory when the territorial government was formed in 1869. Crook County was created with land ceded by Laramie County in 1875. In 1888, Converse County was formed from a portion of Laramie County. In 1911, Goshen and Platte Counties were formed from parts of Laramie County, giving the county its current boundaries.

The county&#x27;s early economy was based on agriculture and livestock raising. The present-day Wyoming Stock Growers Association dates from that era. Other types of animal husbandry also occurred.

Some of the settlers in early Laramie County were foreign immigrants; for example, Burns was largely settled by German immigrants.

==Politics and government==
Like Wyoming as a whole, Laramie County is strongly Republican. It is extremely conservative for an urban county, having not backed the Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon Johnson in 1964–one of only two times since 1952 that it has supported a Democrat. In 2016, Hillary Clinton managed to win just 28.3 percent of the vote in the county, the lowest total of any presidential candidate in Laramie since John W. Davis in 1924, when a large proportion of progressive voters defected to Robert M. La Follette, Sr. Nonetheless, the county is the third-friendliest to Democrats in the state, beaten only by Teton County and Albany County.












==Education==
There are two school districts in Laramie County: Laramie County School District 1 and Laramie County School District 2.

<text>Goshen County (, ) is a county in the U.S. state of Wyoming. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 12,498. Its county seat is Torrington. The eastern boundary of the County borders the Nebraska state line. Goshen County produces more beef cattle than any other Wyoming county. In 1997, the county had a total of 688 farms and ranches, averaging 1,840 acres. As of 2007, this had declined slightly to 665 farms and ranches in the county.

==History==
Goshen County was created in 1911 from a portion of Laramie County. Its government was organized in 1913. This area was part of territories, at one time or another, claimed by: Spain, France, Great Britain, Mexico, and the Republic of Texas. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 permanently established the claim of the United States to the area.

By the 1820s, the North Platte River had become a route for westward-bound fur traders and trappers. By the 1840s this route became part of the Oregon Trail or Mormon Trail. By the late 1850s, it was the route for regularly scheduled east–west stagecoaches carrying passengers and the U.S. mail, and for the short-lived Pony Express carrying mail from Missouri to California (April 1860 to November 1861). By October 1861, transcontinental telegraph lines had been completed along the route. From September 1876 to February 1887, a north–south, Cheyenne-Deadwood stage coach line ran through the county from Cheyenne to the gold fields of the Dakota Territory.

The county was apparently named for Goshen Hole, a valley in the southwest part of the county. John C. Frémont camped in that area on July 14, 1843, and recorded that name in his journal, during an expedition on the Oregon Trail. At least four conflicting stories are available for the origin of the name &quot;Goshen Hole&quot;. The Land of Goshen in Egypt, mentioned in the 45th chapter of the Genesis in the Bible, has been suggested as the most likely. And, John Hunton, who was ranching in the area by the 1870s, was told by Seth Ward, the post sutler at Fort Laramie, that the area was named for the Biblical land. The name of Goshen Hole first appeared on a map years later, in 1888.

==Geography==
According to the US Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.3%) is water. The county is situated in the High Plains east of the Rocky Mountains.

<text>Fremont County is a county in the U.S. state of Wyoming. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 39,234, making it the fifth-most populous county in Wyoming. Its county seat is Lander. The county was founded in 1884 and is named for John C. Frémont, a general, explorer, and politician. It is roughly the size of the state of Vermont. Fremont County comprises the Riverton, WY Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Fremont County was created on March 5, 1884, by the legislature of the Wyoming Territory. The county was created with land ceded by Sweetwater County. In 1890, Big Horn County was carved out of Fremont, Johnson, and Sheridan Counties. Hot Springs County was created in 1911 from parts of Fremont, Big Horn, and Park counties. In 1921, Sublette County was created from parts of Fremont and Lincoln counties, leaving Fremont County&#x27;s boundary at its present configuration.

Fremont County was named for John Charles Frémont, an explorer of the American West, United States Senator from California, and 1856 Republican presidential candidate. Fremont County is the site of the Wind River Indian Reservation, home of the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes of Native Americans.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.9%) is water. It is the second-largest county by area in Wyoming, as well as in the six Rocky Mountain States. Elevations and climate range from desert at Boysen State Park to glaciers at Gannett Peak, the highest point not only in Wyoming but in the three Central Rockies states of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana. The southern end of the county is traversed by the Oregon Trail and in the northwest corner lies Dubois, a gateway town for Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park. Although the county seat is Lander, the largest community is Riverton, home of Central Wyoming College and the economic hub of the region. A large portion of the western edge of the county follows the Continental Divide at the crest of the Wind River Range of the Rocky Mountains, known for its wilderness areas and home of the largest glaciers in the American Rocky Mountains.

In his poem &quot;The Ballad of Jesus Ortiz&quot;, Dana Gioia describes how his great-grandfather, a Mexican immigrant from Sonora, worked as a Wild West cow-puncher and was later murdered by a disgruntled and racist patron while working as a saloon keeper in the Fremont County town of Lost Cabin, Wyoming in 1910.

The movie &quot;Wind River&quot; is set on the Wind River Indian Reservation, which is inside Fremont County.

<doc id="90910" wikidata="Q180242" url="?curid=90910" title="Stockholm syndrome">
<text>Stockholm syndrome is a proposed condition or theory that tries to explain why hostages sometimes develop a psychological bond with their captors.

Stockholm syndrome is a &quot;contested illness&quot; due to doubts about the legitimacy of the condition. 

Emotional bonds can possibly form between captors and captives, during intimate time together, but these are considered irrational by some in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims. Stockholm syndrome has never been included in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (&quot;DSM&quot;), the standard tool for diagnosis of psychiatric illnesses and disorders in the United States, mainly due to the lack of a consistent body of academic research.

==History==
=== Stockholm bank robbery ===

In 1973, Jan-Erik Olsson, a convict on parole, took four employees (three women and one man) of Kreditbanken, one of the largest banks in Stockholm, Sweden, hostage during a failed bank robbery. He negotiated the release from prison of his friend Clark Olofsson to assist him. They held the hostages captive for six days (23–28 August) in one of the bank&#x27;s vaults. When the hostages were released, none of them would testify against either captor in court; instead, they began raising money for their defense.

Nils Bejerot, a Swedish criminologist and psychiatrist, invented the term after the Stockholm police asked him for assistance with analyzing the victims&#x27; reactions to the 1973 bank robbery and their status as hostages. As the idea of brainwashing was not a new concept, Bejerot, speaking on &quot;a news cast after the captives&#x27; release&quot;, described the hostages&#x27; reactions as a result of being brainwashed by their captors. He called it &quot;Norrmalmstorgssyndromet&quot; (after Norrmalmstorg Square where the attempted robbery took place), meaning &quot;The Norrmalm Square syndrome&quot;; it later became known outside Sweden as Stockholm syndrome. It was originally defined by psychiatrist Frank Ochberg to aid the management of hostage situations.

According to accounts by Kristin Enmark, one of the hostages, the police were acting incompetently, with little care for the hostages&#x27; safety. This forced the hostages to negotiate for their lives and releases with the robbers on their own. In the process, the hostages saw the robbers behaving more rationally than the police negotiators and subsequently developed a deep distrust towards the latter. Enmark had criticized Bejerot specifically for endangering their lives by behaving aggressively and agitating the captors. She had criticized the police for pointing guns at the convicts while the hostages were in the line of fire, and she had told news outlets that one of the captors tried to protect the hostages from being caught in the crossfire. She was also critical of prime minister Olof Palme, as she had negotiated with the captors for freedom, but the prime minister told her that she would have to content herself with dying at her post rather than Palme giving in to the captors&#x27; demands. Ultimately, Enmark explained she was more afraid of the police, whose attitude seemed to be a much larger, direct threat to her life than the robbers.

Olsson later said in an interview that he could have easily killed the hostages in the beginning, but over time it became more difficult, as he developed an emotional bond with them:

=== Patty Hearst ===

Patty Hearst, the granddaughter of publisher William Randolph Hearst, was taken and held hostage by the Symbionese Liberation Army, &quot;an urban guerrilla group&quot;, in 1974. She was recorded denouncing her family as well as the police using her new name, &quot;Tania&quot;, and was later seen working with the SLA to rob banks in San Francisco. She publicly asserted her &quot;sympathetic feelings&quot; toward the SLA and their pursuits as well. After her 1975 arrest, pleading Stockholm syndrome (although the term was not used then, due to the recency of the event) did not work as a proper defense in court, much to the chagrin of her defense lawyer F. Lee Bailey. Her seven-year prison sentence was later commuted, and she was eventually pardoned by President Bill Clinton, who was informed that she was not acting by her own free will.

==Lima syndrome==
An inversion of Stockholm syndrome, termed &quot;Lima syndrome&quot;, has been proposed, in which abductors develop sympathy for their hostages. An abductor may also have second thoughts or experience empathy towards their victims. Lima syndrome was named after an abduction at the Japanese embassy in Lima, Peru, in 1996, when members of a militant movement took hostage hundreds of people attending a party at the official residence of Japan&#x27;s ambassador. Lima syndrome is poorly understood, as the main example for research on this variation came from the Japanese embassy hostage crisis in Lima. Two main factors observed in the evaluation were that spending time with the captives may have strengthened the bonds between the captor and captive, however, this had little basis as the majority of captives were released earlier on. Establishing a friendly rapport with a captor could contribute to a positive bond, as most of the captives in this situation were high-level diplomats who were well-versed in their communication skills.

==London syndrome ==
London Syndrome is the opposite of both Stockholm and Lima Syndromes: one or more hostages arouse the kidnappers&#x27; antipathy by defying them, trying to escape or, in the case of a political kidnapping, arguing with them, disqualifying their ideology.

The name London Syndrome comes from the 1980 siege of the Iranian Embassy in London, in which 26 hostages were taken. During the siege, one of the hostages repeatedly argued with the captors, despite other hostages asking him to keep quiet. After several days of siege, the captors decided to kill one of the hostages to force compliance with their demands. So they chose the argumentative hostage, shooting him and then throwing his body out into the street. This prompted a special forces attack, during which they rescued all but one of the remaining hostages and killed five of the six hostage-takers.

== Symptoms and behaviors ==
Victims of the formal definition of Stockholm syndrome develop &quot;positive feelings toward their captors and sympathy for their causes and goals, and negative feelings toward the police or authorities&quot;. These symptoms often follow escaped victims back into their previously ordinary lives.

Stockholm syndrome is paradoxical because the sympathetic sentiments that captives feel towards their captors are the opposite of the fear and disdain which an onlooker might feel towards the captors.

There are four key components that characterize Stockholm syndrome:

* A hostage&#x27;s development of positive feelings towards the captor.
* No previous relationship between hostage and captor.
* A refusal by hostages to cooperate with police and other government authorities.
* A hostage&#x27;s belief in the humanity of the captor, ceasing to perceive them as a threat, when the victim holds the same values as the aggressor.

== Criticism ==

=== Robbins and Anthony (1982) ===
Robbins and Anthony, who had historically studied a condition similar to Stockholm syndrome, known as &quot;destructive cult disorder&quot;, observed in their 1982 study that the 1970s were rich with apprehension surrounding the potential risks of brainwashing. They assert that media attention to brainwashing during this time resulted in the fluid reception of Stockholm syndrome as a psychological condition.

=== FBI law enforcement bulletin (1999) ===
A 1999 report by the FBI containing more than 1,200 hostage incidents found that only 8% of kidnapping victims showed signs of Stockholm syndrome. When victims who showed only negative feeling toward the law enforcement personnel are excluded, the percentage decreases to 5%. A survey of 600 police agencies in 1989, performed by the FBI and the University of Vermont, found not a single case when emotional involvement between the victim and the kidnapper interfered with or jeopardized an assault. In short, this database provides empirical support that the Stockholm syndrome remains a rare occurrence. The sensational nature of dramatic cases causes the public to perceive this phenomenon as the rule rather than the exception. The bulletin concludes that, although depicted in fiction and movies and often referred to by the news media, the phenomenon actually occurs rarely. Therefore, crisis negotiators should place the Stockholm syndrome in proper perspective.

=== Namnyak &quot;et al.&quot; (2008) ===
A research group led by Namnyak has found that although there is vast media coverage of Stockholm syndrome, there has not been much research into the phenomenon. What little research has been done is often contradictory and does not always agree on what Stockholm syndrome is. The term has grown beyond kidnappings to all definitions of abuse. It stated that there is no clear definition of symptoms to diagnose the syndrome.

=== &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&quot; (DSM 5, 2013) ===
The DSM-5 is widely used as the &quot;classification system for psychological disorders&quot; by the American Psychiatric Association. Stockholm syndrome has not historically appeared in the manual, as many believe it falls under trauma bonding or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and there is no consensus about the correct clarification. In addition, there is no extensive body of research or consensus to help solve the argument, although before the fifth edition (DSM 5) was released, Stockholm syndrome was under consideration to be included under &#x27;Disorders of Extreme Stress, Not Otherwise Specified&#x27;.

=== Allan Wade (2015) ===
At Dignity Conference 2015, Dr. Allan Wade presented &quot;The myth of &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot; (and other concepts invented to discredit women victims of violence)&quot; after interviewing Kristin Enmark. In this presentation he posits that &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot; and related ideas such as &quot;traumatic bonding&quot;, &quot;learned helplessness&quot;, &quot;battered women&#x27;s syndrome&quot;, &quot;internalized oppression&quot;, and &quot;identification with the aggressor/oppressor&quot; shift the focus away from actual events in context to invented pathologies in the minds of victims, particularly women. &quot;Stockholm syndrome&quot; can be seen as one of many concepts used to silence individuals who, as victims, speak publicly about negative social (i.e., institutional) responses.

=== Jess Hill (2019) ===
In her 2019 treatise on domestic violence &quot;See What You Made Me Do&quot;, Australian journalist Jess Hill described the syndrome as a &quot;dubious pathology with no diagnostic criteria&quot;, and stated that it is &quot;riddled with misogyny and founded on a lie&quot;; she also noted that a 2008 literature review revealed &quot;most diagnoses [of Stockholm syndrome] are made by the media, not by psychologists or psychiatrists.&quot; In particular, Hill&#x27;s analysis revealed that Stockholm authorities – under direct guidance from Bejerot – responded to the robbery in a way that put the hostages at greater risk from the police than from their captors (hostage Kristin Enmark, who during the siege was granted a telephone call with Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, reported that Palme told her that the government would not negotiate with criminals, and that &quot;you will have to content yourself that you will have died at your post&quot;); as well, she observed that not only was Bejerot&#x27;s diagnosis of Enmark made without ever having spoken to her, it was in direct response to her public criticism of his actions during the siege.

In the 21st century, no Democrat has won even 17% of the vote and every Republican has won over 80% of the vote. In 2016, Crook County was the most Republican county in the most Republican state.












In the Wyoming Senate the county is represented by Republican Ogden Driskill since 2011. In the Wyoming House of Representatives it has been represented by Republican Chip Neiman since 2021.

Like most of Wyoming, Converse County is overwhelmingly Republican. Since Wyoming statehood in 1890, it has only been won by two Democrats – Woodrow Wilson in 1916 and Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 and 1936 – and even these two won the county by no more than eight percentage points. The last Democrat to win forty percent of the county&#x27;s vote was Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and the last to pass so much as 22 percent was Bill Clinton in 1996.

The county has two school districts: Converse County School District 1 and Converse County School District 2.

<text>Carbon County is a county in the U.S. state of Wyoming. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 14,537. Its county seat is Rawlins. Its south border abuts the north line of Colorado.

==History==
Carbon County was organized in 1868, one of the five original counties in Dakota Territory.

Originally about near the center of Wyoming, Carbon County was once part of the Spanish Empire, then part of the Republic of Texas (1835-1845) and part of the State of Texas until 1852 when the northernmost part of that state&#x27;s claims were ceded to the US government. This area is defined by the 42nd parallel on the north, and straight lines south from there to the headwaters of the Arkansas river on the east and the headwaters of the Rio Grande on the west. The documents defining that area include the Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819, the 1824 Constitution of Mexico, and the 1845 &quot;Joint Resolution for the Admission of the State of Texas into the Union&quot; .

Carbon County was organized December 16, 1868, from Laramie County in Dakota Territory, which at the time had jurisdiction over part of modern-day Wyoming. It became a county in Wyoming Territory when that territory&#x27;s government was formally organized on May 19, 1869.

In 1868, the Union Pacific Railroad opened the first coal mine in Carbon County, and the county was named for its extensive coal deposits. In 1875, Carbon County lost territory when Johnson County was created by the legislature of the Wyoming Territory. Natrona County was created with land ceded by Carbon County in 1888. The boundaries of the county were final at that time except for minor adjustments in 1911.

From 1978 to 1982, Carbon County was represented in the Wyoming House of Representatives by Democrat Thomas E. Trowbridge (1930-2009) of Saratoga, a Nebraska native.

==Government and infrastructure==
During the twentieth century, owing to its considerable unionized mining population, Carbon County tended to be much more Democratic than the rest of generally Republican Wyoming. It was one of three Wyoming counties to vote for John F. Kennedy in 1960 and one of two to vote for Hubert Humphrey in 1968, while Dwight D. Eisenhower only won the county narrowly in his two landslide Presidential wins. In recent years, the county has trended much more towards the Republican Party due to changing demographics in the area.












The Wyoming State Penitentiary, operated by the Wyoming Department of Corrections, is located in Rawlins. The facility was operated by the Wyoming Board of Charities and Reform until that agency was dissolved as a result of a state constitutional amendment passed in November 1990.

Since 1950, the only Democrat to have won forty percent of the county&#x27;s vote is Lyndon Johnson in his 1964 landslide victory against Barry Goldwater, and in the subsequent half-century no Democrat has passed one-third of the county&#x27;s vote. In the 21st century, no Democrat has won even 20% of the vote.

<text>Big Horn County is a county in the U.S. state of Wyoming. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 11,521. The county seat is Basin. Its north boundary abuts the south boundary of Montana.

==History==
Big Horn County was created by the legislature of Wyoming Territory in March 1890, and was organized in 1897; its area was annexed from Fremont, Johnson, and Sheridan counties. 
Big Horn County was named for the Big Horn Mountains which form its eastern boundary. Originally, the county included the entire Big Horn Basin, but in 1909 Park County, WY was created from a portion of Big Horn County, and in 1911 Hot Springs and Washakie counties were created from portions of Big Horn, leaving the county with its present borders.
There were large amounts of first generation immigrants from England and Germany living in Big Horn County when World War I broke out in Europe.

The two groups went out of their way to maintain cordial relations with one another, and the county did not see the sorts of anti-German sentiment that was common throughout much of the country. While the English residents were outspokenly pro-British, and many of their Wyoming-born sons went to Canada and joined the Canadian Armed Forces in order to serve in the war on England&#x27;s side, they nonetheless made sure that their German co-workers and neighbors were not harassed or discriminated against. In late 1917 one English rancher referred to the effort as making sure that his German neighbor was always &quot;treated like a gentleman.&quot; Another English rancher said that two of his ranch hands were from Germany and he &quot;would hate to see the foolishness of national hatreds inflicted on men as decent as they are.&quot; English residents of Big Horn County went out of their way to make sure that German-born residents did not feel unwelcome. German immigrants and their Wyoming-born children were not &quot;anti-British&quot; though they favored America remaining neutral in the conflict. Before the war the most commonly read works of fiction among German-born residents of Big Horn County were German language translations of British adventure stories including &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; by A. E. W. Mason as well as Sherlock Holmes stories and &quot;The Light That Failed&quot; by Rudyard Kipling. Consensus among Big Horn County residents of all backgrounds after the war was that the war had ultimately been a tragedy and a &quot;horrible waste of human life.&quot;

==History==
Albany County was organized in 1868 of territory annexed from Laramie County in Dakota Territory, which at the time had jurisdiction over part of modern-day Wyoming. It became a county in Wyoming Territory when its government was formally organized on May 19, 1869.

Charles D. Bradley, a member of the legislature of the Dakota Territory named the county for Albany, New York, the capital of his native state. In 1875, the Wyoming Territorial legislature authorized portions of Albany County to be annexed to create Crook and Johnson counties, and in 1888 land was taken from Albany County for the creation of Converse County. Further adjustments were made to the county&#x27;s boundary in 1911 and 1955.

==Politics==
While Wyoming as a whole tends to be solidly Republican, Albany County is a swing county. It is one of only thirteen counties to have voted for Barack Obama in 2008, Mitt Romney in 2012, Donald Trump in 2016, and Joe Biden in 2020. It is also a national bellwether, only failing to back the nationwide winner on four occasions in its history (1892, 1960, 1976, and 2012).

Since the 1990s, Albany County has been one of the few competitive counties in heavily Republican Wyoming. Laramie, home of the University of Wyoming, is solidly Democratic, while the Laramie suburbs and the county&#x27;s rural precincts are equally solidly Republican. Laramie accounts for roughly half of the county&#x27;s population, with the Laramie suburbs and the rural precincts of the county forming the other approximate half. Thus, swing voters typically determine the county&#x27;s winner.












==Education==
There is one school district in Albany County: Albany County School District 1.

<text>Wood County is a county located in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2020 census, the population was 74,207. Its county seat is Wisconsin Rapids. The county is named after Joseph Wood, a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly. Wood County comprises the Wisconsin Rapids-Marshfield, WI Micropolitan Statistical Area and is included in the Wausau-Stevens Point-Wisconsin Rapids, WI Combined Statistical Area.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.0%) is water. The geographic center of Wisconsin is in Wood County, nine miles southeast of Marshfield.
Wood County spans two of Wisconsin&#x27;s five geographical regions. The northern part of the county is in the Northern Highlands, with mostly rich cropland with heavy clay soil, used for corn, soybeans, hay and dairy. In the northwest corner the Marshfield moraine runs from Marathon County through Marshfield, Bakerville and Nasonville into Clark County. The south and central areas from Babcock through Cranmoor and Wisconsin Rapids are in the Central Plain, flat and marshy - one of the major cranberry-producing centers of the United States. The Wisconsin River cuts across the southeast corner, a corridor of sand flats, islands and oxbows. The river falls about 120 feet as it flows through the county, driving several power dams. The remainder of the county is drained by smaller streams and rivers, punctuated by isolated hills like Powers Bluff.

The flat, sandy southern third of the county was largely shaped by the last glacial advance. The ice didn&#x27;t reach Wood County, but it approached from the east into Portage County and butted up against the Baraboo Hills to the south. This blocked the Wisconsin River, damming it so that it backed up, forming Glacial Lake Wisconsin, a frigid lake that stretched from the Baraboo Hills north to the sites of Babcock and Wisconsin Rapids, submerging that part of the county. This area is generally flat and marshy now because meltwater rivers from the glacier and streams from land to the north carried sand and silt out into the glacial lake, where the sediment settled beneath its still waters. After the glacial dam melted enough to drain Glacial Lake Wisconsin around 13,000 years ago, the Wisconsin River cut new channels through the lake-bottom sands in the southeast corner of the county. In a later dry period, wind blew the sand into dunes. One dune in the town of Saratoga is eight meters thick. Later still, the area became wet and peat formed in places on top of the sand. The first surveyors in 1852 found a great marsh, like a Wisconsin Everglades. Here is their description of what is now Cranmoor:
&quot;This Township is very nearly all covered either with Marsh or swamp there is not to exceed in the Township two Sections of land that would admit of cultivation... Timber on Swamp Tamarack &amp; small Spruce(?) very thick. water from 6 to 20 inches deep, the marsh is covered with a light crop of grass, water from 12 to 40 inches deep, innumerable small Islands(?) interspered over this Town, the margins of which abound with Cranberries.&quot;

The north of the county was shaped by earlier glaciers, which deposited glacial till, the basis for the heavy soil there. The Marshfield moraine in the northwest corner is probably a terminal moraine from one of these earlier glaciers, or from a series of them. Its age is unclear, but its relatively smooth surface indicates that it has eroded for a much longer time than the choppy terminal moraines left 13,000 years ago, like the Perkinstown moraine near Medford.

Much of the county except for the northeast corner is underlain by a layer of Cambrian sandstone, formed long before the last ice age. Most of the original sandstone layer has been eroded away and the remainder is usually buried under glacial till, but it can be seen in gravel pits and a few bluffs. The Lindsey bluffs (a.k.a. the Marshfield School Forest) and Birch Bluff and South Bluff in the Town of Remington are hard spots in this sandstone which have resisted erosion.

Powers Bluff is different from the sandstone bluffs, much older, with a hard core of Precambrian quartzite and a peak of chert. A marker on the bluff says it is a &quot;worn down peak of an ancient mountain range which once covered northern Wisconsin.&quot;

==Politics==












Wood County voted Republican in presidential elections from 1940 to 1992, the only exception being Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. The county became competitive between 1988 and 2012, during which time Wisconsin as a whole voted Democratic in every presidential race. In 1996, Bill Clinton snapped a 28-year Republican streak in the county, taking 45.1% of the vote compared to Bob Dole&#x27;s 39%, while the county gave 55% to Barack Obama in 2008. Since Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 win, in which Wood County gave him 56% of their votes, the county has reverted to its previous status as a more Republican county, as no Democratic presidential candidate has won more than 40% of the vote in the county since 2012.

<text>Winnebago County is a county in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2020 census, the population was 171,730. Its county seat is Oshkosh. It was named for the historic Winnebago people, a federally recognized Native American tribe now known as the Ho-Chunk Nation. Chief Oshkosh was a Menominee leader in the area. Winnebago County comprises the Oshkosh-Neenah, WI Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Appleton-Oshkosh-Neenah, WI Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
The region was occupied by several Native American tribes in the period of European encounter, including the Sauk, Fox, Menominee, and Ojibwa (known as Chippewa in the US). French traders from what is now Canada had early interaction with them, as did French Jesuit missionaries, who sought to convert them to Catholicism. European and American settlement encroached on their traditional territories, and the United States negotiated treaties in the mid-19th century to keep pushing the Indians to the west.

Winnebago County was created in 1840 by European Americans and organized in 1848. The name &quot;Winnebago&quot; is of Algonquin origin, with variations used by the Fox and Potowatomi to refer to the Fox River below Lake Winnebago, which sometimes got muddy and full of fish. It means &#x27;people dwelling by the fetid or ill-smelling water&#x27;, which may also refer to a sulfur spring. The county seat, Oshkosh, was incorporated as a city in 1853, when it already had a population of nearly 2,800.

Chief Oshkosh was the namesake for the county seat. A leader of the Menominee in the region, he was successful in gaining authorization from the federal government for 2500 of his people to remain in Wisconsin, at a time when the government was pushing for their removal west of the Mississippi River.

==Politics==












Waushara County has long been one of the most Republican counties in Wisconsin. Only three Democrats have carried the county at a presidential level since the formation of the Republican Party – Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, Bill Clinton in 1996, and Barack Obama in 2008 – of whom only Roosevelt won an absolute majority. In 1936, when Roosevelt carried Wisconsin by a two-to-one majority, Alf Landon won Waushara County by double digits, while it was one of only three Wisconsin counties, alongside Walworth and Waupaca, to vote for Barry Goldwater over Lyndon Johnson in 1964. It has voted Republican since 2012.

In other statewide races, the county is equally Republican. Waushara County has never backed a Democrat for Governor since before 1900. Senators Herb Kohl in 2006 and William Proxmire in 1976 and 1970 did carry Waushara County when they swept every county in the state, but no other Democratic senatorial candidate has won the county since the Seventeenth Amendment.

<text>Waupaca County ( ) is a county in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2020 census, the population was 51,812. The county seat is Waupaca. The county was created in 1851 and organized in 1853. It is named after the Waupaca River, a Menominee language name meaning &quot;place of tomorrow seen clearly.&quot;

==History==
Ancient indigenous peoples constructed earthworks that expressed their religious and political concepts. An early European explorer counted 72 such earthen mounds in what is now Waupaca County, many of them in the form of effigy mounds, shaped like &quot;humans, turtles, catfish and others.&quot; There were 52 mounds constructed around what is now called Taylor Lake. Most mounds were lost to agricultural development. One mound, shaped like a catfish, is still visible in a private yard along County Hwy. QQ, just east of Taylor Lake. The site was marked by a local women&#x27;s club with a commemorative plaque installed on a large stone.

Under pressure from European-American development, the Menominee people ceded their title to the United States for these lands by treaty in 1852. Following that, the flow of new migrant settlers greatly increased from the East, with people moving from New England, New York, and Ohio. They developed the land primarily for agricultural use in the early decades, also quickly establishing sawmills on the rivers.

In the 1870s railroads were constructed in the county: the Wisconsin Central in 1872 and the Green Bay and Minnesota Railroad (later known as Green Bay, Minnesota &amp; St. Paul) in 1873. These improved the county&#x27;s connections to markets for its lumber and other products. For a period, entrepreneurs and merchants gained high profits from the lumber industry, establishing many fine homes in the larger cities.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.3%) is water. The water includes 22 lakes that form the Waupaca Chain O&#x27; Lakes. These lakes are majority spring fed and connected by the Crystal River outlet. Waupaca County is also home to Partridge Lake on the Wolf River and the Waupaca River.

===Politics===












Waupaca County has long been one of the most Republican counties in Wisconsin. Only two Democrats have carried the county at the presidential level since the formation of the Republican Party – Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 and 1936, and Barack Obama in 2008, and in 1936 Roosevelt only won by plurality because of a sizeable vote for Union Party nominee William Lemke. It was one of only three Wisconsin counties, alongside Walworth and Waushara, to vote for Barry Goldwater over Lyndon Johnson in 1964.

In other statewide races, the county is equally Republican. The only Democratic gubernatorial candidate it has backed since at least 1908 is Albert Schmedeman in 1932. Senators Herb Kohl in 2006 and William Proxmire in 1976 and 1970 did carry Waupaca County when they swept every county in the state, but no other Democratic senatorial candidate has won the county since the Seventeenth Amendment.

<text>Waukesha County () is a county in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2020 United States Census, the population was 406,978, making it the third-most populous county in Wisconsin. Its median income of $88,985 placed it as the only county in Wisconsin on the list of the 100 highest-income counties in the U.S. by median income as of 2020. Its county seat and largest city is Waukesha.

Waukesha County is included in the Milwaukee–Waukesha–West Allis, WI Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Known as forested and prairie land, the region was first home to Indigenous tribes like Menomonie, Ojibwe (Chippewa), Potawatomi, and Ho-Chunk (Winnebago), who practiced agriculture and trade. In 1836, Native American tribes formally lost title to the land when treaties were disregarded and were forcibly removed by the Federal Army. Prior to the 1830s, the area was unoccupied by settlers due to its inland location and the fact that the Fox River was not a water highway. The New England settlers only came to the area to set up fur trading posts between their new encampments and established cities like Milwaukee. Morris D. Cutler and Alonso Cutler, seeking claims for homesteads, were the first permanent white colonial settlers.

The part of Wisconsin that Waukesha County occupies was a part of Michigan Territory when Milwaukee County was organized in September 1834. On July 4, 1836, the Wisconsin Territory was formed, which included land that is now in the state of Minnesota. In January 1846, part of Milwaukee County was split off into Waukesha County. Curtis Reed was the first county chairman. When a vote decided the county seat, Waukesha defeated Pewaukee by two votes. The name is derived from the Potawatomi word for &#x27;fox&#x27; because the streams in the lower part of the county drain into the Fox River.

Waukesha was a New England settlement, and Waukesha&#x27;s founders were settlers from New England, particularly Connecticut, rural Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, as well as from upstate New York who were born to parents who had migrated there from New England shortly after the American Revolution. These people were &quot;Yankees&quot; descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s. They were part of a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was the wilds of the Northwest Territory during the early 1800s. Most arrived as a result of the completion of the Erie Canal as well as the end of the Black Hawk War.

The New Englanders built farms, roads, government buildings and established post routes. They brought many of their Yankee New England values, such as a passion for education that led to the establishment of many schools as well as staunch support for abolitionism. They were mostly members of the Congregationalist Church, though some were Episcopalian. Due to the second Great Awakening some converted to Methodism, and others became Baptists before moving to what is now Waukesha County. Waukesha, like much of Wisconsin, would be culturally very continuous with early New England culture for most of its early history, before the state received a substantial influx of German immigrants in the latter half of the 19th century.

In 2024, &quot;Waukeshaaspis&quot;, a prehistoric genus of trilobite, was named after the county.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (5.3%) is water. The Fox River runs through it.

Waukesha County is located to the west of Milwaukee and its suburban development was spurred by the construction of Interstate 94 in Wisconsin.

==Politics==











Waukesha County is the largest Republican-leaning county in Wisconsin and has been one of the most Republican suburban counties in the nation for many years. It is one of the WOW counties, which share similar traits in suburban Milwaukee.

It has not supported a Democrat for president since 1964, and has only supported a Democrat four other times since 1892. While other non-Southern suburban counties have moved towards Democrats since the 1990s, Waukesha and the other WOW counties have continued to vote solidly Republican. Underlining this, Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s narrow win in 1964 is the last time that a Democratic presidential candidate has even garnered 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote, though Jimmy Carter, Michael Dukakis, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris came close. In 2008, John McCain carried the county by a 25.7% margin over Barack Obama, when Obama won Wisconsin by 13.9% over McCain. In 2024, Kamala Harris became the first Democrat since 1976 to lose the county by less than 20 percentage points. 

=== 2011 Supreme Court election ===
The initial unofficial statewide tally in the 2011 Wisconsin Supreme Court election had Democratic challenger JoAnne Kloppenburg defeating incumbent justice David Prosser by a 204-vote margin. On the Thursday after the election, Waukesha County Clerk Kathy Nickolaus reported, among other smaller errors, a failure to report votes in the Waukesha city of Brookfield. The newly reported votes gave Prosser the lead, and he retained his seat. Media reports stemming from this incident referred to the county as &quot;crucial Waukesha County,&quot; and the phrase has continued to be widely used in U.S. political media as an in-joke, despite the county being a Republican stronghold.

<text>Washington County is a county in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2020 census, the population was 136,761. Its county seat is West Bend. The county was created from Wisconsin Territory in 1836 and organized in 1845. It was named after President George Washington. Washington County is part of the Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis, WI Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Washington County was created on December 7, 1836, by the Wisconsin Territory Legislature, with Port Washington designated as the county seat. It was run administratively from Milwaukee County until 1840, when an Act of Organization allowed the county self-governance, and the county seat was moved to Grafton, then called Hamburg. This solution was not satisfactory, as at that time four cities were vying to become the county seat: Port Washington, Grafton, Cedarburg, and West Bend. At least four inconclusive elections were held between 1848 and 1852, but the results were unusable due to accusations of foul play and serious irregularities.

In 1852, the state Legislature attempted to split the county into a northern and southern half, with the northern half retaining the name and the southern half becoming Tuskola County. Voters refused this decision, so in 1853 the Legislature again split the county, this time into a western and eastern portion. The western portion remained Washington County, with West Bend as its county seat, while the eastern portion became Ozaukee County, with Port Washington as its county seat.

==Politics==












Like most other suburban counties surrounding Milwaukee (the &quot;WOW counties&quot;), Washington County is a Republican stronghold. Since 1940, the county has been won by the Republican presidential candidate in every election except 1964, as is the case in neighboring Ozaukee and Waukesha counties. Additionally, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter are the only Democratic presidential candidates since the 1936 election to have crossed the 40 percent mark. In 2008, while Barack Obama won Wisconsin by 14 points, Washington County, one of the 13 out of 72 counties to vote for his Republican rival John McCain was his weakest county in the state, as McCain won it by almost 30 points; and other WOW counties were the only three counties where Obama did not win 40 percent of the vote.

==Politics==












Owing to its Yankee heritage, which contrasts with the German-American or Scandinavian-American character of most of Wisconsin, Walworth County was initially a stronghold of the Free Soil Party. It voted for Martin van Buren and John P. Hale in Wisconsin&#x27;s first two presidential elections, and its opposition to the spread of slavery led to its population voting Republican in subsequent elections, even resisting the appeal of Wisconsin native Robert La Follette when he carried the state in 1924 as a Progressive.

Walworth County remains strongly Republican. The only Democrat to carry the county was Woodrow Wilson in 1912, who won 36 percent of the vote. Even with the GOP mortally divided between President William Howard Taft and Theodore Roosevelt, Wilson only won the county by 29 votes. The best Democratic showings since then have been by Lyndon Johnson in 1964 and Barack Obama in 2008, both of whom received around 48 percent. Franklin D. Roosevelt and Bill Clinton are the only other Democrats since Wilson to cross the 40 percent mark, though Joe Biden came very close in 2020.

<text>Vilas County ( ) is a county in the state of Wisconsin, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 23,047. Its county seat is Eagle River. The county partly overlaps the reservation of the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa.

==History==
===Native Americans===
Native Americans have lived in what is now Vilas County for thousands of years. The county contains archaeological sites dating to the prehistoric Woodland period. In the eighteenth century, the area was disputed by the Dakota and Ojibwe people. According to oral histories, the conflict culminated in Ojibwe victory in a battle on Strawberry Island in Flambeau Lake around 1745. Ojibwe people have continued to live in the area ever since, securing the Lac du Flambeau Indian Reservation in the 1854 Treaty of La Pointe.

===Settlement===
The first recorded white settler was a man named Ashman who established a trading post in Lac du Flambeau in 1818.

In the 1850s migrants from New England, primarily from Vermont and Connecticut, constructed wagon roads and trails through Vilas County including the Ontonagan Mail Trail and a military road from Fort Howard to Fort Wilkins in Copper Harbor, Michigan.

Vilas County was set off from Oneida County on April 12, 1893, and named for William Freeman Vilas. Originally from Vermont, Vilas represented Wisconsin in the United States Senate from 1891 to 1897.

===Logging era===
Logging began in the late 1850s. Loggers came from Cortland County, New York, Carroll County, New Hampshire, Orange County, Vermont and Down East Maine in what is now Washington County, Maine and Hancock County, Maine. Many dams were built throughout the county to assist loggers as they sent their timber downstream to the lumber and paper mills in the Wisconsin River valley. After the county was founded in 1893 and logging ceased to be the primary industry in the area, migrants seeking other forms of employment settled in the county. These later immigrants primarily came from Germany, Ireland and Poland though some came from other parts of the United States as well.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (16%) is water. There are 1,318 lakes in the county. Much of Vilas County is covered by the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest and the Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest as well as extensive county forest lands. Vilas County waters drain to Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, and the Mississippi River. The Wisconsin, Flambeau, and Presque Isle Rivers all find their headwaters in Vilas County.

<text>Trempealeau County ( ) is a county in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2020 census, the population was 30,760. Its county seat is Whitehall.

==History==
Patches of woodland are all that remain of the brush and light forest that once covered the county. In ancient times, the woodlands contained a great deal of timber, but Native Americans burned them periodically to encourage the growth of berries. They did little cultivation and had been almost completely removed from the area by 1837. The area was ceded by the Dakota in the 1837 Treaty of Washington (7 Stat. 538).

French fur traders were the first Europeans to enter this land, traveling by river across the county. At the mouth of the Trempealeau River at its confluence with the Mississippi River, they found a bluff surrounded by water and called it &quot;La Montagne qui trempe à l’eau&quot; (&quot;mountain steeped in water&quot;). It is now known as Trempealeau Mountain. The name was later shortened to Trempealeau. Created in 1854 and organized in 1855, the county is named after the river.

During the 19th and 20th century large numbers of Norwegian immigrants settled in the area in pursuit of cheap land, a better life and more opportunities. Much of the population is still of Norwegian descent and celebrate their ancestry by making foods native to Norway and participating in Norwegian Constitution Day events.

In the late 1850s, Trempealeau became a destination for Polish Prussian settlers from Upper Silesia seeking to escape German persecution and poverty in their homeland. They built churches, schools, and communities to develop what became the nation&#x27;s second-largest Polish settlement. Their settlements were especially focused around Independence, Arcadia, Whitehall, and Pine Creek. Trempealeau has a large population of Silesian Polish descent to this day.

The county again became an immigrant destination in the first decades of the 21st century, gaining a significant Hispanic and Latino population.

==Geography==

==Politics==

Between 1948 and 1984, Trempealeau County voted for the nationwide winner in every election with the exception of the very close 1960 election. Then, from 1988 to 2012, like most of the rural counties in southwestern Wisconsin, it backed the Democratic candidate in each election, and did so by more than a 10% margin each time. In 2016, once again like the rest of rural southwestern Wisconsin, Trempealeau County dramatically swung to the right, shifting from a 14% victory for Democrat Barack Obama in 2012 to a 13% victory for Republican Donald Trump in 2016. Trump further expanded his margin of victory to over 16% in 2020 and to over 21% in 2024, achieving the highest vote shares for a Republican in the county since Dwight D. Eisenhower in his 1952 landslide victory.

<text>Taylor County is a county in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2020 census, the population was 19,913. Its county seat is Medford. It is mostly rural, lying roughly where corn and dairy farms to the south give way to forest and swamp to the north.

==History==
The earliest recorded event in Taylor county probably occurred in 1661, when Wisconsin was claimed by New France. A band of Huron Indians from eastern Ontario had fled the Iroquois and taken refuge near the headwaters of the Black River, probably around Lake Chelsea in the northeast part of the county. Father René Menard, a French Jesuit priest who had travelled up the Great Lakes as far as Keweenaw Bay in upper Michigan, heard that these Hurons were starving. He decided to try to reach them to baptize them, despite his own weak health and scant supplies. In mid-summer, he and a French fur trader set out, following rivers and streams in birchbark canoes down into Wisconsin. Finally, a day&#x27;s journey from the Huron camp, Father Menard separated from his travelling companion at a rapids to carry some supplies. He was never seen again. The place where he disappeared is believed to be the dells of the Big Rib River, below Goodrich in the southeast corner of Taylor county.

On June 8, 1847, before any settlers or loggers, a team of surveyors entered the county southwest of Medford, where County E now enters from Clark County. They were working for the U.S. government, marking a north–south line called the Fourth Principal Meridian, from which much of the land in the state would be measured. For six days they worked their way through woods and swamps, up what is now the southern part of E and across the valley that is now the Mondeaux Flowage, before continuing north into what is now Price County. The head of the team wrote of the trip:
&quot;During four consecutive weeks there was not a dry garment in the party, day or night... we were constantly surrounded and as constantly excoriated by swarms or rather clouds of mosquitoes, and still more troublesome insects...&quot;
On their way through the county, they and other surveyors recorded a forest then dominated by hemlock, yellow birch and sugar maple, with white pine the fourth or sixth most frequent. The mix of tree species then resembled today&#x27;s Gerstberger Pines grove southeast of Rib Lake.

Logging began in the late 1850s. Loggers came up the rivers and floated white pine logs out in spring and early summer log drives, down the Big Rib River into the Wisconsin River, down the Black River to the south, and west down the Jump and the Yellow River into the Chippewa. Log-drives continued until around 1900, when the easy-to-float white pine was dwindling.

In 1872 and 1873, the Wisconsin Central Railroad built its line up through the forest that would become Medford on its way to Ashland. The Wisconsin Central&#x27;s financiers were from Boston, and they named stations at Medford, Chelsea and Westboro after towns in Massachusetts. To finance building this line, the U.S. Government gave the railroad half the land, the odd-numbered sections, of a good share of the county. The railroad began to haul out the logs that didn&#x27;t float well. Most early settlement was along this railroad, with few settlers in the west or east ends of the county even by the 1890s.

In 1875, Taylor County with its current boundaries was carved out of the larger Chippewa, Lincoln and Clark counties and a bit of Marathon, with the county seat at Medford. The county was probably named for Wisconsin&#x27;s governor at the time, William Robert Taylor. It was initially divided into four towns—Westboro, Chelsea, Medford and Little Black—each stretching the width of the county.

From around 1902 to 1905, the Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railway built its railroad up the west end of the county through Polley, Gilman, Hannibal and Jump River. In 1902 the Eau Claire, Chippewa Falls, and Northeastern Railroad (better known as Omaha) pushed in from Holcombe through Hannibal to now-abandoned Hughey on the Yellow River. In 1905 the Wisconsin Central Railroad built its line through Clark (now a ghost town), Lublin, Polley, Gilman and Donald, heading for Superior. The SM&amp;P and Omaha were primarily logging railroads, which hauled out lumber and incidentally transported passengers and other cargo. With the lumber gone, the SM&amp;P shut down in 1933.

After the good timber was gone, the lumber companies sold many of the cutover forties to farm families. Initially they tried making their living in various ways: selling milk, eggs, beef and wool, growing cucumbers and peas, and various other schemes. But before long dairy had become the predominant form of agriculture in the county. By 1923 Medford had the second largest co-op creamery in Wisconsin. The number of dairy farms peaked around 3,300 in the early 1940s and had dropped to 1,090 by 1995.

Much of the cut-over north-central part of the county was designated part of the Chequamegon National Forest in 1933. Large chunks of this central and northern part of the county was not good for farming, and lay neglected in the hands of lumber companies after the forest was cut off - largely a tax-delinquent fire hazard. In the early 1930s the federal government agreed to manage the land for the county as National Forest. Soon after, Civilian Conservation Corps camps at Mondeaux, Perkinstown, and near the current Jump River fire tower began to replant parts of that cutover. The CCCs at Mondeaux built the recreation area there. Today hikers can follow the Ice Age National Scenic Trail through the national forest and the northeast corner of the county.

The major early industry was the production of sawlogs, lumber, and shingles. Large sawmills were at Medford and Rib Lake. Medford, Perkinstown and Rib Lake had tanneries, which used local hemlock bark in the tanning process. Whittlesey had an early brickyard. Industry has diversified since, into creameries, window manufacturers, plastics, and food processing - mostly at Medford.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.0%) is water.
Taylor county&#x27;s terrain was shaped chiefly by glaciers. Geologists believe that 15,000 to 25,000 years ago the Laurentide Ice Sheet pushed down from Canada across what are now the Great Lakes, and over much of the northern U.S. One of the ice sheet&#x27;s lobes bulldozed down over two thirds of Taylor county, at its farthest extent covering a line from Westboro through Perkinstown to Lublin. The ice sheet pushed down that far, then melted back, leaving the band of choppy hills and little lakes that cuts diagonally across the county. This band of hills is called the Perkinstown terminal moraine. North and west of the moraine, in the corner of the county toward Jump River, that last glacier left behind a more gently rolling plain of glacial till. The striking glacial features in this area are glacial erratic boulders and eskers. Along with the Mondeaux and Lost Lake eskers, there are others in the towns of Westboro, Pershing, Aurora and Taft. The southeast corner of the county toward Stetsonville and Goodrich was not covered by the last glacier, but was covered by earlier ones. Here too they left glacial till, but the land is generally flatter and less rocky since erosion has had more time to level things.

Beneath the glacial till lies Cambrian and Precambrian bedrock. Outcrops have been exposed in places by the Jump and Yellow Rivers. An unmined copper and gold deposit known as the Bend deposit lies north of Perkinstown, which geologists believe was formed up to two billion years ago by a black smoker, a volcanic vent under an ancient ocean.

The county straddles a divide between three river systems. The Jump River and Yellow flow west into the Chippewa river valley. The Big Rib River flows southeast to the Wisconsin. And the Black River flows out to the south. All eventually feed the Mississippi.

==Transportation==
The state of Wisconsin has jurisdiction over of state highways in Taylor County, including STH-13, STH-64, STH-73, STH-97, and STH-102. STH-13 runs north–south through the eastern half of the county and STH-73 is the major north–south highway in the western half of the county. STH-64 is the major highway running east–west through Taylor county. Through a contractual agreement with the state, the Taylor County Highway Department is responsible for maintenance of state highways and right-of-ways.

A network of of county highways serves Taylor County&#x27;s rural areas. Major east–west highways include CTH-A, CTH-D, CTH-M, and CTH-O. Major north–south routes include CTH-C, CTH-E, and CTH-H.

Towns in Taylor County are responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of their individual town roads.

The county has one designated Rustic Road, Rustic Road 1 located in the Town of Rib Lake. Dedicated in 1975, this gravel road between STH-102 and CTH-D near Rib Lake was the first Rustic Road in Wisconsin. It winds over wooded hills and valleys created by glaciers nearly 12,000 years ago. A historical marker alongside the road (at Hwy 102 and RR1) commemorates the designation.

<text>St. Croix County is a county in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2020 census, the population was 93,536. Its county seat is Hudson. The county was created in 1840 (then in the Wisconsin Territory) and organized in 1849. St. Croix County is part of the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, MN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area. Between 2000 and 2010, it was Wisconsin&#x27;s fastest-growing county.

==History==
St. Croix County was created on August 3, 1840, by the legislature of the Wisconsin Territory. It was named after the river on its western border. Sources vary on the name&#x27;s origin. The St. Croix River may have been named after an explorer named St. Croix who drowned at the river&#x27;s mouth in the late 17th century. According to another account, Father Hennepin gave this region the French name &quot;Ste Croix&quot; (Holy Cross) because of the burial markers at the river&#x27;s mouth.

La Pointe County (now extinct, see Bayfield County) was created from the northern portions of Wisconsin Territory&#x27;s St. Croix County on February 19, 1845. When Wisconsin was admitted into the union as a state on May 29, 1848, the territorial St. Croix County was further divided, with the territory from the Mississippi River to the Minnesota border remaining de facto Wisconsin Territory until on March 3, 1849, it and unorganized federal territory north of Iowa were used in the creation of the Minnesota Territory. Itasca, Washington, Ramsey and Benton Counties were created by the Minnesota Territory on October 27, 1849, from the de facto Wisconsin Territory that had been separated from the Wisconsin Territory&#x27;s La Pointe County.

The part of St. Croix County allocated to Wisconsin became the parental county to Pierce and Polk Counties, and formed significant portions of Dunn, Barron, Washburn and Burnett Counties.

On June 12, 1899, a deadly F5 tornado struck New Richmond. The tornado&#x27;s damage path was wide and long. The tornado formed on the banks of the St. Croix River, south of Hudson. Moving to the northeast across St. Croix County, the tornado passed through the villages of Burkhardt and Boardman before striking New Richmond head on, leveling the entire business district and half the town&#x27;s residences. The storm continued northeast, narrowly missing the town of Deer Park before crossing into Polk County, where it narrowly missed the towns of Clear Lake, Richardson, and Clayton. Once the tornado passed into Barron County, it struck the village of Arland before breaking up southwest of Barron. The tornado killed 117 people (four at Boardman, two in Polk County, and the rest at New Richmond), including at least 20 people who died from their injuries in the days after the storm. Largely thanks to state aid and donations, most of the town was rebuilt by the next winter. The tornado was the deadliest ever recorded in Wisconsin and the 9th deadliest tornado in U.S. history.

== Law enforcement ==

The Sheboygan County Sheriff&#x27;s Office was established in 1846, with T.C. Horner the first sheriff elected. The Sheriff&#x27;s Office was once located inside the David Taylor House, which still stands today in the same location as a part of the Sheboygan County Historical Museum. The jail was located in the basement of the David Taylor House from 1915 to 1936 while the Sheriff&#x27;s Office was located on the first floor and the sheriff&#x27;s residence on the second floor. In 1936, the Sheriff&#x27;s Office and county jail moved to the top floor of the Sheboygan County Courthouse.

In 1981, the Sheboygan County Sheriff&#x27;s Office relocated to its present location inside the Law Enforcement Center at 525 North 6th Street in Sheboygan. At the time, it was a very contemporary linear facility with modern security systems. The second floor of the Sheriff&#x27;s Office served as the county jail until 1998 when a 95,000 square foot, 295 bed Detention Center was constructed on the city&#x27;s south side. It was envisioned the Sheriff&#x27;s Office and the Sheboygan Police Department would be housed inside the Law Enforcement Center but that never occurred.

In 2012, after years of discussion, the Sheboygan County and City of Sheboygan approved an agreement to combine emergency dispatch at the Law Enforcement Center. Under the proposal, the city will fund remodeling of the new center by providing $2.5 million for the project. The Joint Dispatch Center began operation in 2016.

The current sheriff is Cory Roeseler, who was elected to his first term in office in 2018.

<text>Shawano County ( ; originally Shawanaw County) is a county located in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2020 census, the population was 40,881. Its county seat is Shawano.

Shawano County is included in the Shawano, WI Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Green Bay–Shawano, WI Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Its name is from a modified Ojibwa term meaning &quot;southern&quot;; it was the southern boundary of the Ojibwa nation. A Menominee chief named &quot;Sawanoh&quot; led a band that lived in the area. Many citizens of Shawano believe the lake, county, and city (Town of Shawanaw founded 1853 and changed to Shawano in 1856), were named after Chief Sawanoh. A historical marker placed in 1958 near the lake along Highway 22 states the lake was named as the southern boundary of Chippewa (Ojibwe) territory.

Various historical recordings of the spelling of Shawano include Sawanoh, Shawanaw, Sharuno, Shabin, Savannah, and Savanah. This shows the influence of French, German, and English translation (v&#x27;s, w&#x27;s, and b&#x27;s sounding very similar and thus being recorded incorrectly at times). Similar differences in spelling have been seen in the Mahican/Mahikan/Maikens tribe or Mohecan/Morhican/Mohican tribe, all referring to the same Algonquian-speaking people.

The federally recognized Stockbridge-Munsee Community (made up of Algonquian-speaking Mahican and Lenape), whose ancestors traditionally lived in the East along the Hudson River Valley, is located in Shawano County. Their reservation encompasses the towns of Bartelme and Red Springs.

It was created as a separate county in 1853 under the name Shawanaw County. The county, unlike the city, retained the old spelling until 1864.

From the mid-nineteenth century on, the county was settled by European Americans, including many German, and later, Polish immigrants. They developed the county for agriculture. Before that, French-Canadian and British fur traders traveled widely through the area, trading with the Chippewa and other Native American peoples of the region.

The first non-Indian credited with exploring the region where Shawano is now located is Samuel Farnsworth. He paddled up the Wolf River in 1843 with a few men to scout the area for logging the vast forests. A small Menominee village was located along the Shawano lake Channel when their party arrived, and the Indians were friendly and cooperative. Charles Wescott and the Farnsworth group then set up a sawmill where the Channel meets the Wolf River.

Captain William Powell, an officer of the Black Hawk War, established a trading post on the Wolf River about two miles from the village in 1844. He had been an interpreter for the government when the treaties were signed allowing white people to settle this area of Wisconsin.

E. F. Sawyer platted a village near Powell&#x27;s trading post in 1854 but public favor clung to the region adjacent to the old mill property and it was decided by popular vote to locate the county seat at Shawanaw, which was the name of the newly formed county.

The county, which was organized in 1853, was formed from areas of Oconto and Outagamie Counties. Forty-seven votes were cast and Elias Murray, Charles D Wescott and Elisha Alexander were elected supervisors. At that time there were 254 registered inhabitants, but only the men were allowed to vote.

When the county was first organized the name was spelled Shawanaw, taken from the Indian Sha-wa-Nah-Pay-Sa which meant “lake to the south” in Menominee and Chippewa. The spelling was changed in 1864 to its present Shawano, with three townships: Richmond, Waukechon and Shawano. Later others were added, making 25 townships.

In 1860 the first school house was erected in the county and Orlin Andrews was employed as its teacher. In 1898 there were 108 public schools in the county with 124 teachers.

A courthouse was erected on Main Street in 1857 and was replaced in 1879–80 at a cost of $17,000.00. The County Board authorized a new courthouse and jail in June 1953.

The earliest settlers who came to Shawano County consisted mostly of people from the New England States, Canada, and a few from British Columbia. A large influx of Bohemians settled in the Leopolis area and near Powell&#x27;s Trading Post in the area about two miles from the city on Highway K. Norwegians settled in the area around Wittenberg, Lessor, Lunds and Navarino. Germans have been very predominate in the entire county, with 4,524 of the 27,475 inhabitants in 1900 born in Germany.

<text>Sawyer County is a county in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2020 census, its population was 18,074. Its county seat is Hayward. The county partly overlaps with the reservation of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians.

==History==
The area that is now Sawyer County was contested between the Dakota and Ojibwe peoples in the 18th century. Oral histories tell that the Ojibwes defeated the Dakotas locally in the Battle of the Horse Fly on the Upper Chippewa River in the 1790s. By this time, Lac Courte Oreilles had become the site of an Ojibwe village. Ojibwes allowed trader Michel Cadotte to build a fur-trading outpost in the area in 1800. The United States acquired the region from the Ojibwe Nation in the 1837 Treaty of St. Peters, but the Ojibwes retained the right to hunt and fish on treaty territory. Ojibwe people successfully negotiated to establish the permanent Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation in the 1854 Treaty of La Pointe.

The county is named for Philetus Sawyer, a New England man who represented Wisconsin in the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate in the 19th century. Logging began in the late 1850s. Loggers came from Cortland County, New York, Carroll County, New Hampshire, Orange County, Vermont, and Down East Maine in what is now Washington County, Maine and Hancock County, Maine. These were &quot;Yankee&quot; migrants, that is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who had settled New England during the 1600s. They were mostly members of the Congregational Church. Sawyer County was created in 1883 and organized in 1885. In the 1890s immigrants came from a variety of countries such as Germany, Norway, Poland, Ireland and Sweden.

==Politics==













Sawyer County had a historical reputation for being a bellwether county in presidential elections, having voted for the overall national winner in every election from 1964 to 2016. Similar to other bellwether counties, this streak was broken in 2020 when the county backed Donald Trump over eventual winner Joe Biden. This is because of increasing geographic polarization in American politics, with fewer and fewer counties swinging between parties, and instead voting consistently for one party according to demographics.

<text>Sauk County is a county in Wisconsin. It is named after a large village of the Sauk people. As of the 2020 census, the population was 65,763. Its county seat and largest city is Baraboo. The county was created in 1840 from Wisconsin Territory and organized in 1844. Sauk County comprises the Baraboo, WI Micropolitan Statistical Area and is included in the Madison metropolitan area.

==History==
Sauk County was a New England settlement. The original founders of Sauk County consisted entirely of settlers from New England as well as some from upstate New York who had parents who moved to that region from New England shortly after the American Revolution. These people were &quot;Yankee&quot; settlers, that is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s. While most of them came to Wisconsin directly from New England, there were many who came from upstate New York. These were people whose parents had moved from New England to upstate New York in the immediate aftermath of the American Revolution. They were part of a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the Northwest Territory during the early 1800s. In the case of Wisconsin this migration primarily occurred in the 1830s. Due to the prevalence of New Englanders and New England transplants from upstate New York, Wisconsin was very culturally continuous with early New England culture for much of its early history.

The Yankee migration to Wisconsin in the 1830s was a result of several factors, one of which was the overpopulation of New England. The old stock Yankee population had large families, often bearing up to ten children in one household. Most people were expected to have their own piece of land to farm, and due to the massive and nonstop population boom, land in New England became scarce as every son claimed his own farmstead. As a result, there was not enough land for every family to have a self-sustaining farm, and Yankee settlers began leaving New England for the Midwestern United States.

They were aided in this effort by the construction and completion of the Erie Canal which made traveling to the region much easier, causing an additional surge in migrants coming from New England. Added to this was the end of the Black Hawk War, which made the region much safer to travel through and settle in for white settlers.

They got to what is now Sauk County in the 1830s by sailing up the Wisconsin River from the Mississippi River on small barges which they constructed themselves out of materials obtained from the surrounding woodlands. When they arrived in what is now Sauk County there was nothing but dense virgin forest, the &quot;Yankee&quot; New Englanders laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes. They brought with them many of their Yankee New England values, such as a passion for education, establishing many schools as well as staunch support for abolitionism. They were mostly members of the Congregationalist Church though some were Episcopalian. Due to the second Great Awakening some of them had converted to Methodism and some became Baptist before moving to what is now Sauk County. Sauk County, like much of Wisconsin, would be culturally very continuous with early New England culture for most of its early history.

In the late 1890s, German immigrants began to settle in Sauk County, making up less than one out of thirty settlers in the county before this date. Generally there was little conflict between them and the &quot;Yankee&quot; settlers, however when conflict did arise it focused around the issue of prohibition of alcohol. On this issue the Yankees were divided and the Germans almost unanimously were opposed to it, tipping the balance in favor of opposition to prohibition. Later the two communities would be divided on the issue of World War I in which, once again, the Yankee community would be divided and the Germans were unanimously opposed to American entry into the war. The Yankee community was generally pro-British, however many of the Yankees also did not want America to enter the war themselves. The Germans were sympathetic to Germany and did not want the United States to enter into a war against Germany, but the Germans were not anti-British. Prior to World War I, many German community leaders in Wisconsin spoke openly and enthusiastically about how much better America was than Germany, due primarily (in their eyes) to the presence of English law and the English political culture the Americans had inherited from the colonial era, which they contrasted with the turmoil and oppression in Germany which they had so recently fled. In the early 1900s immigrants from Ireland, Sweden, Norway and Poland also arrived in Sauk County.
The area around Baraboo was first settled by Abe Wood in 1838, and was originally known as the village of Adams. In 1846 it became the county seat of Sauk County after a fierce fight with the nearby village of Reedsburg. In 1852, the village was renamed &quot;Baraboo&quot;, after the nearby river. It was incorporated as a city in 1882.

New England settlers set up several sawmills early in the history of what is now Baraboo because of its location near the Baraboo and Wisconsin Rivers.

The city was the home of the Ringling brothers. From 1884 to 1917 it was the headquarters of their circus and several others, leading to the nickname &quot;Circus City&quot;. Today Circus World Museum is located in Baraboo. A living history museum, it has a collection of circus wagons and other circus artifacts. It also has the largest library of circus information in the United States. The museum previously hosted the Great Circus Parade, which carried circus wagons and performers through the streets of Baraboo, across the state by train, and then through downtown Milwaukee.

The Al. Ringling Theatre is a grand scale movie palace in downtown Baraboo, made possible through the financial assistance of the Ringling family. The Al Ringling home still exists.

Located near Baraboo is the Badger Army Ammunition Plant, which was the largest munitions factory in the world during World War II, when it was known as &quot;Badger Ordnance Works&quot;. The plant is no longer in use.

The Culver&#x27;s restaurant franchise has its headquarters in Prairie du Sac, and was first opened in Sauk City in 1984. That same year, Cirrus Aircraft, now of Duluth, Minnesota, was founded in a rural Baraboo barn by brothers Alan and Dale Klapmeier to produce the VK-30 kit aircraft.

<text>Rusk County is a county in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2020 census, the population was 14,188. Its county seat is Ladysmith. The Chippewa and Flambeau rivers and their tributaries flow through the county. The land ranges from corn/soybean farms and dairy farms to lakes rimmed with vacation homes to hiking trails through the Blue Hills.

==History==
The forested wilderness that would become Rusk County was home to different Indian nations over the years. Some used the rivers to pass through, some camped, some buried their dead there. The first recorded Europeans in the county were Father Louis Hennepin and his company, who canoed up the Chippewa in 1680 when the area was part of New France, on their way to Lac Courte Oreilles and Madeline Island. In 1790 Lakota warriors came up the Chippewa to attack the Ojibwe, but they were defeated, leaving the Ojibwe in control through the fur trade era.
The first loggers and settlers came up the Chippewa River from the south, entering what would become Rusk County north of modern Holcombe, where the Flambeau River joins the Chippewa. An Indian settlement lay on the bank of the Chippewa near where St. Francis of Assisi Mission Church stands.

European-American settlement began near that Indian village in 1847, when Adolph La Ronge and his wife came from Canada. By the 1860s the Daniel Shaw Lumber Company had a farm two miles west (across from modern Flater&#x27;s Resort) to support their operations.

Loggers initially went up the rivers and cut the choicest pine in winter, then drove masses of logs down to sawmills in Chippewa Falls and Eau Claire on the spring and early summer floods. At first they poled supplies up the rivers in bateaux, but later cut &quot;tote roads&quot; to haul supplies with oxen and horses to their remote logging camps.

One of these early tote roads was the Chippewa Trail, which followed west of the Chippewa from the south end of the county to the north end near Exeland, and beyond. By 1880 the Chippewa Trail was developed into a stage road, with a horse-drawn stage running up it one day and back down the next. Stopping places (rough inns) were located about every five miles, where lumberjacks could rest and carouse on their way to and from the camps. An 1888 map of Chippewa County shows more roads, including one following the west side of the Flambeau from Shaw&#x27;s farm to Flambeau Falls (Ladysmith).

Railroads reached the area in 1884. The Mississippi River Logging Company brought in a locomotive, cars and rails by sleigh from Bloomer to start a logging railroad. Weyerhaueser&#x27;s company had tried driving logs down the streams from the Potato Lake and Soft Maple areas, but the streams proved too small, so they laid track and hauled logs to Big Bend, then rolled them into the Chippewa. As the timber in that area was cut off, this railroad, named the &quot;Chippewa River and Menomonie Railroad&quot;, shifted operations, moving its rails north of Bruce.

That same year the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad (the Soo Line) started building its railroad across the area, aiming to connect the grain of the Twin Cities with the shipping at Sault Ste. Marie. The two railroads met west of Bruce at a place called Apollonia. In the 1890s the CR&amp;M had shops and an engine house there and Apollonia grew to 350 people - the largest town at that time in the current bounds of Rusk County. The CR&amp;M was notable for the huge wooden trestles it built near Star Lake and Deer Lake.

The Soo Line continued east in 1884 and 1885, creating other stations which would develop as the towns of Weyerhaeuser, Bruce, Warner (now Ladysmith), Deer Tail (now Tony), Miller&#x27;s Siding (now Glen Flora), Ingram and Hawkins. This new railroad provided a way to get lumber out to markets. This was particularly helpful when logging turned from pine to hardwoods which didn&#x27;t float as well. Many of these little towns along the Soo Line had sawmills, and some of those sawmills were fed by their own little logging railroads, reaching out into the forests.

Rusk County was established in 1901 when the Wisconsin legislature split off the northern half of what had been Chippewa County into a new &quot;Gates County&quot;. It started with that name because Milwaukee land speculator (and major land-holder in the county) James L. Gates said he would donate $1000 to the new county if it was named Gates. When Gates didn&#x27;t come up with the money, the state legislature renamed the county &quot;Rusk&quot; in 1905 in honor of Jeremiah M. Rusk, governor of Wisconsin and the first U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. The 1901 legislation also designated Corbett (now Ladysmith) as the county seat, which was challenged by other towns all the way to the state supreme court.

Around 1905 the Wisconsin Central Railroad built another rail line through the county, heading northwest from Chicago&#x27;s direction toward Superior, and crossing the Soo Line at Ladysmith. In 1907, dedicated passenger trains began passing through. The stations along this line spawned another string of hamlets: Sheldon, Conrath, Crane and Murry.

The area&#x27;s economy was evolving. The peak of pine log drives on the Chippewa had been around 1885 and they ended around 1906. Hardwood lumbering started in earnest around 1900 and peaked from 1905 to 1915, then began to decline. With the decline of timber came uncertainty about the way forward, which led to schemes for mining, large-scale ranching, and manufacturing that came to nothing. The paper mill started in Ladysmith, which did succeed. The Big Falls Dam was built around 1920 to generate electricity, and the Thornapple, Ladysmith and Port Arthur dams were converted from pulp-grinding to electricity-generating later.

All along, the lumber companies and their proxy land companies had been selling cut-over parcels to settler-farmers. The farmers grazed cattle, grew potatoes and rutabagas among the stumps, and gradually cleared the land with fire, dynamite and plows, eventually scratching out 40- and 80-acre family farms. As more land was logged, more of the county turned to farms. The sawmill towns shifted to serving surrounding farms with stores, creameries, and feed mills.

During the Great Depression, times were tough in Rusk County. Banks failed at Weyerhaeuser, Tony, Glen Flora, and Ingram. Cheese factories failed. But that was also the period when Jump River Electric, supported by the New Deal Rural Electric Administration, ran electricity to farms and homes in the country.

And a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was established in Rusk County. It employed many young men from Chicago and other cities, along with a few locals. The camp was started in June 1933 in the town of Murry in the Blue Hills, then moved in November to a site in Cedar Rapids north of Glen Flora. The men fought fires, built roads, supported fire towers, and planted trees. When the U.S. entered WWII, some of the CCCs enlisted or were drafted, and CCC Camp Rusk shortly disbanded.

Rusk County&#x27;s first rural schools had been established at least by 1891 - the Bear Lake school opened then. Those first schools were one-room, typically with one teacher for six grades. Ladysmith had a school by 1905. Rusk County Normal School opened in Ladysmith in 1907, and by the time it closed in 1948 it had trained 719 qualified teachers. Rusk County had 125 rural schools at one time.

After the Depression, rural population declined and farms merged. Rural schools too merged, until decent roads and busing allowed them to consolidate with larger graded town schools like Weyerhaeuser and Tony; consolidation of schools was completed around 1960. The Hawkins school district joined Ladysmith in 1966, then switched to the Flambeau district in 2009.

The private Mount Senario College served the area in various forms from around 1962 to 2002.
In the 1990s the Flambeau Mine was an open pit mine near the Flambeau River a mile south of Ladysmith, which produced copper, gold and silver. Mining so near the Flambeau River was controversial, with an initial plan blocked by the local zoning committee. Kennecott came back with a less risky proposal in 1987 and it was approved.

The mine operated from 1991 to 1999, excavating a pit 2,600 feet long and 220 feet deep, and producing 181,000 tons of copper, 334,000 ounces of gold, and 3.3 million ounces of silver. In the reclamation phase, the pit was back-filled and planted with native plants. It now offers walking trails open to the public.

Over the years, sawmills and cheese factories in the smaller towns have closed, but other industries have grown. The largest employers in the county are now Weather Shield in Ladysmith, Jeld-Wen in Hawkins, Rusk County administration, the school districts, Wal-Mart, Artisans, the medical center in Ladysmith, and Rand Trucking.
