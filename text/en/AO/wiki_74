<text>Auntie Mame: An Irreverent Escapade is a 1955 novel by American author Patrick Dennis chronicling the madcap adventures of a boy, Patrick, growing up as the ward of his Aunt Mame Dennis, the sister of his dead father.

The book is often described as having been inspired by Dennis&#x27; real-life eccentric aunt, Marion Tanner, whose life and outlook mirrored those of Mame, but Dennis denied the connection. The novel was a runaway bestseller, setting records on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list, with more than 2 million copies in print during its initial publication. It became the basis of a stage play, a film, a stage musical, and a film musical.

In 1958, Dennis wrote a sequel titled &quot;Around the World with Auntie Mame.&quot;

==Stage adaptations==

The novel was adapted for the stage by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee. Running from October 31, 1956, to June 28, 1958, at the Broadhurst Theatre, the original Broadway production starred Rosalind Russell in the title role. The original Broadway cast also included Robert Allen as Mr. Babcock, Yuki Shimoda as Ito, Robert Smith as Beau, Polly Rowles as Vera Charles, Jan Handzlik as young Patrick and Peggy Cass as Agnes Gooch. In 1957, both Russell and Cass were nominated for Tony Awards, and Cass won the award. A West Coast touring production, starring Eve Arden in the title role and Benay Venuta as Vera Charles, ran from August 4 to December 13, 1958, with stops at San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

In 1966, a musical version of the story, titled &quot;Mame&quot;, starring Angela Lansbury and Bea Arthur, opened on Broadway.

==Film adaptations==

In December 1958, a film of the same title based on the play was released by Warner Brothers with Russell, Shimoda, Handzlik and Cass reprising their roles. Russell and Cass were both nominated for an Academy Award, and Russell won a Golden Globe for her portrayal.

In 1974, the musical version was made into a film of the same title starring Lucille Ball, Bea Arthur (reprising her stage role), and Robert Preston. This film was a failure at the box office—despite breaking attendance records during its Radio City Music Hall run—and critics generally panned it for Ball&#x27;s singing ability and thought she was not up to the part (she was 62 years old).

==Re-issues==
In September 2001, the book was re-released in paperback by Broadway Books, an imprint of Random House.

In 2009, the Italian publisher Adelphi re-released the book, which had been out of print for many years in its Italian translation, under the title &quot;Zia Mame&quot;; the book reached the top spot on Italian bestseller lists and stayed there for many weeks, an unusual performance for a re-release.

<text>County Kerry () is a county on the southwest coast of Ireland, within the province of Munster and the Southern Region. It is bordered by two other counties; Limerick to the east, and Cork to the south and east. It is separated from Clare to the north by the Shannon Estuary. With an area of and a population of 156,458 as of 2022, it is the 5th largest of Ireland&#x27;s 32 counties by land area, and the 15th most populous. The governing local authority is Kerry County Council.

Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean, Kerry is Ireland&#x27;s most westerly county. Its rugged coastline stretches for and is characterised by bays, sea cliffs, beaches and many small offshore islands, of which the Blaskets and the Skelligs are the most notable. The county&#x27;s peninsulas have a hilly to mountainous topography, with the MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks on Iveragh rising to over . By contrast, its interior regions are mostly flat, interspersed with low mountain ranges such as the Stacks and the Mullaghareirks. The climate of Kerry is dominated by the North Atlantic Current and is usually mild and humid, with abundant precipitation. This allows for the growth of a wide variety of temperate and sub-tropical plants not typically found at such northerly latitudes.

The county is named after the Cíarraige people, who were the region&#x27;s dominant pre-historic sept. County Kerry first appeared as a separate shire in 1232, and was at that time part of a royal grant given to the Earls of Desmond. The present-day county was divided for centuries between the Gaelic Kingdom of Desmond, ruled by the Mac Cárthaigh dynasty, and the Anglo-Norman Earldom of Desmond, ruled by the Geraldines. These two regions were merged in 1606 in the aftermath of the Nine Years&#x27; War.

Kerry has two official Gaeltacht regions, on the Iveragh Peninsula and on the Dingle Peninsula, the latter of which is the only Gaeltacht in Munster where Irish is the daily spoken language of the majority of the population. In the county as a whole, 40.2 percent of residents were able to speak Irish The regional dialect is Munster Irish, exemplified by the influential works of Blasket Islanders such as Peig Sayers, Muiris Ó Súilleabháin and Tomás Ó Criomhthain.

==Geography and subdivisions==
Kerry is the fifth largest of Ireland&#x27;s 32 traditional counties by area and the fifteenth largest by population. It is the second largest of Munster&#x27;s six counties by area, and the fourth largest by population. Uniquely, it is bordered by only two other counties: County Limerick to the east and County Cork to the south-east. The county town is Tralee although the Catholic diocesan seat is Killarney, which is one of Ireland&#x27;s most famous tourist destinations. The Lakes of Killarney, an area of outstanding natural beauty, are located in Killarney National Park. The Reeks District is home to Carrauntoohil, Ireland&#x27;s highest mountain at 1,039m. The tip of the Dingle Peninsula is the westernmost point of Ireland.

===Baronies===
There are nine historic baronies in the county. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they are no longer used for many administrative purposes. Their official status is illustrated by Placenames Orders made since 2003, where official Irish names of baronies are listed under &quot;Administrative units&quot;.

* Clanmaurice – &quot;
* Corkaguiny – &quot;
* Dunkerron North – &quot;
* Dunkerron South – &quot;
* Glanarought – &quot;
* Iraghticonnor – &quot;
* Iveragh (Peninsula) – &quot;
* Magunihy – &quot;
* Trughanacmy – &quot;&quot;

===Most populous towns===


===Physical geography===

Kerry faces the Atlantic Ocean and, typically for an Eastern-Atlantic coastal region, features many peninsulas and inlets, principally the Dingle Peninsula, the Iveragh Peninsula, and the Beara Peninsula. The county is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean and on the north by the River Shannon. Kerry is one of the most mountainous regions of Ireland and its three highest mountains, Carrauntoohil, Beenkeragh and Caher, all part of the MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks range.

Just off the coast are a number of islands, including the Blasket Islands, Valentia Island and the Skelligs. Skellig Michael is a World Heritage Site, famous for the medieval monastery clinging to the island&#x27;s cliffs. The county contains the extreme west point of Ireland, Dunmore Head on the Dingle Peninsula, or including islands, Tearaght Island, part of the Blaskets. The most westerly inhabited area of Ireland is Dún Chaoin, on the Dingle Peninsula. The River Feale, the River Laune and the Roughty River flow through Kerry, into the Atlantic.
===Climate===
The North Atlantic Current, part of the Gulf Stream, flows north past Kerry and the west coast of Ireland, resulting in milder temperatures than would otherwise be expected at the 52 North latitude. This means that subtropical plants such as the strawberry tree and tree ferns, not normally found in northern Europe, thrive in the area.

Because of the mountainous area and the prevailing southwesterly winds, Kerry is among the regions with the highest rainfall in Ireland. Owing to its location, there has been a weather reporting station on Valentia for many centuries. The Irish record for rainfall in one day is , recorded at Cloore Lake in Kerry in 1993.

In 1986 the remnants of Hurricane Charley crossed over Kerry as an extratropical storm causing extensive rainfall, flooding and damage.

==History==
Kerry ( or in the older spelling &quot;Ciarraighe&quot;) means the &quot;people of Ciar&quot; which was the name of the Gaelic tribe who lived in part of the present county. The legendary founder of the tribe was Ciar, son of Fergus mac Róich. In Old Irish &quot;Ciar&quot; meant black or dark brown, and the word continues in use in modern Irish as an adjective describing a dark complexion. The suffix &quot;raighe&quot;, meaning &quot;people/tribe&quot;, is found in various &quot;-ry&quot; place names in Ireland, such as &quot;Osry&quot;—&quot;Osraighe&quot; &quot;Deer-People/Tribe&quot;. The county&#x27;s nickname is &quot;the Kingdom&quot;.

===Lordship of Ireland===
On 27 August 1329, by Letters Patent, Maurice FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond was confirmed in the feudal seniority of the entire county palatine of Kerry, to him and his heirs male, to hold of the Crown by the service of one knight&#x27;s fee. In the 15th century, the majority of the area now known as County Kerry was still part of the County Desmond, the west Munster seat of the Earl of Desmond, a branch of the Hiberno-Norman FitzGerald dynasty, known as the Geraldines.

===Kingdom of Ireland===
In 1580, during the Second Desmond Rebellion, one of the most infamous massacres of the Sixteenth century, the Siege of Smerwick, took place at Dún an Óir near Ard na Caithne (Smerwick) at the tip of the Dingle Peninsula. The 600-strong Italian, Spanish and Irish papal invasion force of James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald was besieged by the English forces and massacred.

In 1588, when the fleet of the Spanish Armada in Ireland were returning to Spain during stormy weather, many of its ships sought shelter at the Blasket Islands and some were wrecked.

During the Nine Years&#x27; War, Kerry was again the scene of conflict, as the O&#x27;Sullivan Beare clan joined the rebellion. In 1602 their castle at Dunboy was besieged and taken by English troops. Donal O&#x27;Sullivan Beare, in an effort to escape English retribution and to reach his allies in Ulster, marched all the clan&#x27;s members and dependants to the north of Ireland. Due to harassment by hostile forces and freezing weather, very few of the 1,000 O&#x27;Sullivans who set out reached their destination.

In the aftermath of the War, much of the native owned land in Kerry was confiscated and given to English settlers or &#x27;planters&#x27;. The head of the MacCarthy Mor family, Florence MacCarthy was imprisoned in London and his lands were divided between his relatives and colonists from England, such as the Browne family.

In the 1640s Kerry was engulfed by the Irish Rebellion of 1641, an attempt by Irish Catholics to take power in the Protestant Kingdom of Ireland. The rebellion in Kerry was led by Donagh McCarthy, 1st Viscount Muskerry. His son the Earl of Clancarty held the county during the subsequent Irish Confederate Wars and his forces were among the last to surrender to the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1652. The last stronghold to fall was Ross Castle, near Killarney.

===The Famine===

In the 18th and 19th centuries Kerry became increasingly populated by poor tenant farmers, who came to rely on the potato as their main food source. As a result, when the potato crop failed in 1845, Kerry was very hard hit by the Great Irish Famine of 1845–49. In the wake of the famine, many thousands of poor farmers emigrated to seek a better life in America and elsewhere. Kerry was to remain a source of emigration until recent times (up to the 1980s). Another long term consequence of the famine was the Land War of the 1870s and 1880s, in which tenant farmers agitated, sometimes violently, for better terms from their landlords.

===War of Independence and Civil War===

In the 20th century, Kerry was one of the counties most affected by the Irish War of Independence (1919–21) and Irish Civil War (1922–23). In the war of Independence, the Irish Republican Army fought a guerilla war against the Royal Irish Constabulary, and British military. One of the more prominent incidents in the conflict in Kerry was the siege of Tralee in November 1920, when the Black and Tans placed in Tralee burned many homes, and shot dead a number of local people in retaliation for the IRA killing of five local policemen the night before. On 10 December 1920 Martial law was declared in the Counties of Kerry, Cork and Limerick. Another incident was the Headford Junction ambush in spring 1921, when IRA units ambushed a train carrying British soldiers outside Killarney. About ten British soldiers, three civilians and two IRA men were killed in the ensuing gun battle. Violence between the IRA and the British was ended in July 1921, but nine men, four British soldiers and five IRA men, were killed in a shoot-out in Castleisland on the day of the truce itself, indicating the bitterness of the conflict in Kerry.

Following the Anglo-Irish Treaty, most of the Kerry IRA units opposed the settlement. One exception existed in Listowel where a pro-Treaty garrison was established by local Flying Column commandant Thomas Kennelly in February 1922. This unit consisted of 200 regular soldiers along with officers and NCOs. A batch of rifles, machine guns and a Crossley tender were sent from Dublin. Listowel would remain a base for those supporting the treaty throughout the conflict. The town was eventually overcome by superior numbers of anti-Treaty forces belonging to the Kerry No. 2 and 3 Brigades in June 1922. In the ensuing civil war between pro- and anti-treaty elements, Kerry was perhaps the worst affected area of Ireland. Initially the county was held by the Anti-Treaty IRA but it was taken for the Irish Free State after seaborne landings by National Army troops at Fenit, Tarbert and Kenmare in August 1922. Thereafter the county saw a bitter guerilla war between men who had been comrades only a year previously. The republicans, or &quot;irregulars&quot;, mounted a number of successful actions, for example attacking and briefly re-taking Kenmare in September 1922. In March 1923 Kerry saw a series of massacres of republican prisoners by National Army soldiers, in reprisal for the ambush of their men—the most notorious being the killing of eight men with mines at Ballyseedy, near Tralee. The internecine conflict was brought to an end in May 1923 as the rule of law was re-established following the death of IRA Chief of Staff Liam Lynch, and the order by Frank Aiken to dump all arms.

==Local government==

===County council===

The local authority for the county is Kerry County Council. The council provides a number of services including planning, roads maintenance, fire brigade, council housing, water supply, waste collection, recycling and landfill, higher education grants and funding for arts and culture.

The county is divided into five municipal districts with local responsibility: Corca Dhuibhne–Castleisland, Kenmare, Killarney, Listowel, and Tralee.

===Town councils===
Prior to the 2014 local elections held on 23 May 2014, Killarney, Listowel and Tralee each had town councils. They were abolished under the Local Government Reform Act 2014.

==Parliamentary representation==
Following boundary changes in 2016, Kerry is represented in Dáil Éireann by five TDs returned from a single Dáil constituency of Kerry. The TDs elected to the 33rd Dáil at the 2020 general election were Pa Daly (SF), Norma Foley (FF), Brendan Griffin (FG), Danny Healy-Rae (Independent) and Michael Healy-Rae (Independent).

==Culture==
As a region on the extremity of Ireland, the culture of Kerry was less susceptible to outside influences and has preserved the Irish language, as well as Irish traditional music, song and dance. The Sliabh Luachra area of northeast Kerry, that borders Limerick and Cork, is renowned for its traditional music, dance and song, especially its slides, polkas and fiddle playing. The Siamsa Tíre centre in Tralee is a hub of traditional Irish pastimes. Corca Dhuibhne and Uíbh Ráthach are considered Gaeltacht regions and Irish culture is also very strong in these areas.

The Blasket Islands off the Dingle Peninsula are known for their rich literary heritage; authors such as Peig Sayers, Muiris Ó Súilleabháin and Tomás Ó Criomhthain have all written books about life on the islands, which were evacuated in 1953 due to increasingly extreme weather conditions that made them uninhabitable. John B Keane, a native of Listowel, is considered one of Ireland&#x27;s greatest playwrights and is known for his works such as &quot;The Field&quot;, &quot;Sive&quot; and &quot;Big Maggie&quot;. The annual Listowel Writers&#x27; Week Festival serves as a celebration of Irish writers past and present.

==Sport==
===Gaelic games===
Kerry is known for its senior Gaelic football team. Gaelic football is by far the dominant sport in the county, and Kerry has the most successful of all football teams; the Kerry footballers have won the Sam Maguire cup 38 times, with the next nearest team Dublin on 30 wins. Hurling is popular at club level in north Kerry, although the county has only won one All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, in 1891. The senior team currently compete in the Joe McDonagh Cup.

===Association football===
The Kerry District League is the main competition for association football in the county. Tralee Dynamos have represented Kerry in the A Championship, while they and Killarney Celtic also competed in the Munster Senior League during the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 2023 Kerry F.C. entered the League of Ireland First Division for the first time.

===Cricket===
Cricket is played in County Kerry by County Kerry Cricket Club. They play their home games at the Oyster Oval near Tralee.

==Irish language==

In 2011 there were 6,083 Irish language speakers in County Kerry, with 4,978 native speakers within the Kerry Gaeltacht. This does not count the 1,105 attending the four Gaelscoils (Irish language primary schools) and two Gaelcholáiste (Irish language secondary schools) outside the Kerry Gaeltacht.

==Places of interest==

Kerry, with its mountains, lakes and nearly 1,000 kilometres of Atlantic coastline is among the most scenic areas in Ireland and is among the most significant tourist destinations in Ireland. Killarney is the centre of the tourism industry, which is a significant element of the economy in Kerry. The Kerry Way, Dingle Way and Beara Way are walking routes in the county. The Ring of Kerry on the Iveragh Peninsula is a popular route for tourists and cyclists. The pedestrian version is the scenic Kerry Way which follows ancient paths generally higher than that adopted by the Ring of Kerry.

Kerry has an abundance of archaeological sites. The earliest evidence of human settlement dates to the Mesolithic period. The county has a notably high concentration of open-air Atlantic rock art, which is believed to date to the Late Neolithic / Early Bronze Age period (2300-1500BC). This rock art is scattered throughout the county and exists in dense clusters on the Iveragh and Dingle peninsulas. These carvings form part of a tradition which stretches across Atlantic Europe and are distinct from the megalithic art of the type found at Newgrange. Kerry has many Bronze Age monuments including standing stones, wedge tombs, boulder burials, and stone circles, along with Iron Age forts. Like the rest of Ireland, Kerry has large numbers of monuments from the Early Christian period, such as ring forts, churches, cross-inscribed stones, holy wells, saints&#x27; graves, and ogham stones, along with Medieval castles and churches.

==Infrastructure==

===Road===

The main National Primary Routes into Kerry are the N21 road from Limerick and the N22 road from Cork, each terminating in Tralee. Kerry Airport is situated on the N23 road between Castleisland and Farranfore which connects the N21 and N22. Within Kerry the main National Secondary Routes include the well-known Ring of Kerry which follows the N70 road that circles the Iveragh Peninsula and links at Kenmare with the N71 road to west Cork.
The N86 road connects Tralee with Dingle along the Dingle Peninsula, while the N69 road from Limerick links Listowel and Tralee through north Kerry.

====Greenways====
There is a developing greenway network, known as the &quot;Kingdom of Kerry Greenways&quot;, across the county. The North Kerry (part of the Great Southern Trail), South Kerry and Tralee-Fenit greenways are under-development or in the planning phases.

===Rail===

Kerry is served by rail at Tralee railway station, Farranfore railway station, Killarney railway station and Rathmore railway station which connect to Cork and Dublin Heuston, via Mallow.

Branch line services existed to each of the peninsulas (Beara, Iveragh and Dingle) and also to the north of the county. They were closed during the rationalisations of the 1950s and 1960s.
* Tralee and Dingle Light Railway: a narrow-gauge railway that closed in July 1953.
* Kenmare via Headford Junction: (8 miles outside Killarney) closed in early 1960.
* Valentia Harbour via Farranfore: also closed in early 1960. The &quot;Gleesk Viaduct&quot; near Kells, the viaduct at Killorglin, and many other structures on the line still exist.
* Listowel was served via the North Kerry line, which extended from Tralee to Limerick. Passenger service ceased in 1963, freight in 1983 and the lines were pulled up in 1988.
* Fenit was served via a branch off the North Kerry line until 1978; the rails are still in place.

Listowel to Ballybunion had the distinction of operating experimental Lartigue Monorail services from 1882 to 1924. A 500m section was re-established in 2003. A road-car route, the &quot;Prince of Wales Route&quot;, was a link from Bantry to Killarney, operated by the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway as a service for tourists.

===Bus===
Bus Éireann operates an extensive bus service network on routes throughout the county, with connection hubs in Killarney and Tralee.

Various local link services also run throughout Kerry such as the soon to be launched 274 from Tralee to Tarbert via Ardfert, Ballyheigue, Ballyduff and Ballybunion. Note that this new Local Link 274 will replace the return journey on the Bus Eireann 274. See Local Link Kerry for all buses operated by them throughout the county.

===Air===

Kerry Airport is located at Farranfore in the centre of the county and has operated scheduled services since 1989. Destinations served as of 2014 are London (Stansted &amp; Luton), Frankfurt-Hahn Airport, Faro, Portugal and Alicante all operated by Ryanair. Aer Lingus Regional also operate an all-year-round service to Dublin. The airport is served by Farranfore railway station.

===Sea===

Fenit harbour near Tralee is a regional harbour capable of handling ships of up to 17,000 tonnes. Large container cranes from Liebherrs in Killarney are regularly exported worldwide. A rail-link to the port was closed in the 1970s. The harbour at Dingle is one of Ireland&#x27;s secondary fishing ports. In the north of the county, a ferry service operates from Tarbert to Killimer in County Clare.

===Hospitals===

Hospitals in Kerry include the public University Hospital Kerry which is the second-largest acute hospital in the Health Service Executive South Region. It serves as the main hospital for County Kerry and also serves the people in parts of north Cork and west Limerick. Other hospitals include the private Bon Secours Hospital in Tralee and community hospitals in Cahirciveen, Dingle, Kenmare, Killarney and Listowel.

===Education===
The Munster Technological University (MTU), former the Institute of Technology, Tralee, is the main third-level institution in the county. It was established in 1977 as the Regional Technical College, Tralee but acquired its present name in 1997. The Institute of Technology, Tralee, merged with Cork Institute of Technology in 2019 to form the Munster Technological University. It has an enrolment of about 3,500 students. The institute has two campuses: the North Campus (opened in Dromtacker in 2001) and the South Campus (opened in Clash in 1977) approximately 2.4 km (1.5 mi) apart.

==Septs, families, and titles==
A number of Irish surnames are derived from septs who hail from the Kerry area, such as Falvey, Foley, McCarthy, Murphy, O&#x27;Connor, O&#x27;Moriarty, Clifford, Kennelly, McGrath, O&#x27;Carroll, O&#x27;Sullivan, O&#x27;Connell, O&#x27;Donoghue, O&#x27;Shea, Quill, Scannell, Stack, Sugrue and Tangney.

Titles in the British Peerage of Ireland with a family seat in Kerry are:
*the Knight of Kerry – a branch of Fitzgeralds who had lands at Valentia Island
*the Earl of Kenmare (also &quot;Viscount Castlerosse, Viscount Kenmare and Baron Castlerosse&quot;) – the descendants of Sir Valentine Browne who was awarded lands in Killarney
*the Earl of Desmond – the Fitzgeralds of Desmond who had lands in North Kerry until they were seized at the end of the Desmond Rebellions
*the Marquess of Lansdowne (also &quot;Earl of Shelburne, Baron Dunkeron&quot;) – the descendants of Sir William Petty who was awarded lands in Kenmare and elsewhere
*the Earl of Kerry (also &quot;Baron Kerry, Viscount Clanmaurice&quot;) – the Fitzmaurice family
*the Earl of Listowel – the Hare family
*the Baron Ventry – the Mullins family who had lands in the Dingle Peninsula, including Ventry

Viscount Valentia appears to have been associated with lands in County Armagh, rather than Kerry. The title Baron Monteagle of Brandon refers to Brandon, County Kerry.

<text>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is a 1955 American three-act play by Tennessee Williams. The play, an adaptation of his 1952 short story &quot;Three Players of a Summer Game&quot;, was written between 1953 and 1955. One of Williams&#x27;s more famous works and his personal favorite, it won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1955. Set in the &quot;plantation home in the Mississippi Delta&quot; of Big Daddy Pollitt, a wealthy cotton tycoon, the play examines the relationships among members of Big Daddy&#x27;s family, primarily between his son Brick and Maggie &quot;the Cat&quot;, Brick&#x27;s wife.

&quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; features motifs such as social mores, greed, superficiality, mendacity, decay, sexual desire, repression, and death. The dialogue throughout is often written using nonstandard spelling intended to represent accents of the Southern United States. The original production starred Barbara Bel Geddes, Burl Ives, and Ben Gazzara. The play was adapted as a film of the same name in 1958, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman as Maggie and Brick, with Ives and Madeleine Sherwood recreating their stage roles. Williams made substantial excisions and alterations to the play for a revival in 1974. This has been the version used for most subsequent revivals, which have been numerous.

==Plot==

A family in the American South is in crisis, especially the husband and wife, Brick and Margaret (usually called Maggie or &quot;Maggie the Cat&quot;), and the crisis unspools with Brick&#x27;s family over the course of one evening&#x27;s gathering at the family plantation in Mississippi. The party celebrates the birthday of patriarch Big Daddy Pollitt, &quot;the Delta&#x27;s biggest cotton-planter&quot;, and his return from the Ochsner Clinic with what he has been told is a clean bill of health. All family members (except Big Daddy and his wife, Big Mama) are aware of Big Daddy&#x27;s true diagnosis: he is dying of cancer. His family has lied to Big Daddy and Big Mama to spare them pain on the patriarch&#x27;s birthday, but throughout the course of the play, it becomes clear that the Pollitt family has long constructed a web of deceit for itself.

Maggie, determined and beautiful, has escaped a childhood of poverty to marry into the wealthy Pollitts, but finds herself unfulfilled. The family is aware that Brick has not slept with Maggie for a long time, which has strained their marriage. Brick, an aging football hero, infuriates her by ignoring his brother Gooper&#x27;s attempts to gain control of the family fortune. Brick&#x27;s indifference and his drinking have escalated with the suicide of his football buddy Skipper. Maggie fears that Brick&#x27;s malaise will ensure that Gooper and his wife, Mae, inherit Big Daddy&#x27;s estate.

Over the evening, each member of the family faces the issues they have bottled up inside. Big Daddy attempts a reconciliation with the alcoholic Brick. Both Big Daddy and Maggie separately confront Brick about the true nature of his close friendship with Skipper, which appears to be the source of Brick&#x27;s sorrow and the cause of his alcoholism. Brick explains to Big Daddy that the friendship troubled Maggie, who jealously believed it had a romantic undercurrent, and says Skipper took Maggie to bed to prove her wrong but could not complete the act, raising inner doubts that made him &quot;snap&quot;. Brick also reveals that, shortly before his suicide, Skipper confessed his attraction to Brick, but Brick rejected him.
Disgusted by the family&#x27;s mendacity, Brick tells Big Daddy that the report from the clinic about his condition was falsified for his sake. Big Daddy storms out of the room, leading the rest to drift inside. Maggie, Brick, Mae, Gooper, and Doc Baugh (the family&#x27;s physician) decide to tell Big Mama the truth about her husband&#x27;s illness, and she is devastated by the news. Gooper and Mae start to discuss the division of the Pollitt estate. Big Mama defends her husband from their proposals.

Big Daddy reappears and makes known his plans to die peacefully. Attempting to secure Brick&#x27;s inheritance, Maggie tells him she is pregnant. Gooper and Mae know this is a lie, but Big Mama and Big Daddy believe that Maggie &quot;has life&quot;. When they are alone again, Maggie locks away the liquor and promises Brick that she will &quot;make the lie true&quot;.

==Themes==

===Falsehoods and untruths===
Mendacity is a recurring theme in the play. Brick uses the word to express his disgust with the &quot;lies and liars&quot; he sees around him, and with complicated rules of social conduct in Southern society and culture. Big Daddy says that Brick&#x27;s disgust with mendacity is really disgust with himself for rejecting Skipper before his suicide. Except for Brick, the entire family lies to Big Daddy and Big Mama about his terminal cancer. Furthermore, Big Daddy lies to his wife, and Gooper and Mae exhibit avaricious motives in their attempt to secure Big Daddy&#x27;s estate.

In some cases, characters refuse to believe certain statements, leading them to believe they are lies. A recurring phrase is the line, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be funny if that was true?&quot;, said by both Big Daddy and Brick after Big Mama and Maggie (respectively) proclaim their love. The characters&#x27; statements of feeling are no longer clear-cut truths or lies; instead, they become subject to greater or lesser certainty. This phrase is the last line of the play as originally written by Williams and again in the 1974 version.

===Facing death===
How humans deal with death is also a focus of this play, as are the futility and nihilism some feel when confronted with imminent mortality. Similar ideas are found in Dylan Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night&quot;, which Williams excerpted and added as an epigraph to his 1974 version. Thomas wrote the poem to his dying father.

Additionally, in one of his many drafts, in a footnote on Big Daddy&#x27;s action in the third act, Williams deems &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; a &quot;play which says only one affirmative thing about &#x27;Man&#x27;s Fate&#x27;: that he has it still in his power not to squeal like a pig but to keep a tight mouth about it.&quot;

==Stage productions==

===Original production===
The original Broadway production, which opened at the Morosco Theater on March 24, 1955, was directed by Elia Kazan and starred Barbara Bel Geddes as Maggie, Ben Gazzara as Brick, Burl Ives as Big Daddy, Mildred Dunnock as Big Mama, Pat Hingle as Gooper, and Madeleine Sherwood as Mae. Bel Geddes was the only cast member nominated for a Tony Award, and Kazan was nominated for Best Director of a Play. Kazan had enormous power in the industry at the time, sufficient to convince Williams to rewrite the third act to Kazan&#x27;s liking. Kazan requested that Maggie be shown as more sympathetic, the dying Big Daddy make a reappearance, and Brick undergo some sort of moral awakening. Williams capitulated, but when the play was published later that year by New Directions Publishing, it included two versions of act three, the original and the Broadway revision, with his accompanying &quot;Note of Explanation&quot;. For its 1974 revival, Williams made further revisions to all three acts, and New Directions published that version of the play in 1975. 

Both Ives and Sherwood reprised their roles in the 1958 film version. The cast also featured the southern blues duo Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry and had as Gazzara&#x27;s understudy the young Cliff Robertson. When Gazzara left the play, Jack Lord replaced him. Others from the original Broadway production included R. G. Armstrong as Doctor Baugh, Fred Stewart as Reverend Tooker, Janice Dunn as Trixie, Seth Edwards as Sonny, Maxwell Glanville as Lacey, Pauline Hahn as Dixie, Darryl Richard as Buster, Eva Vaughn Smith as Daisy, and Musa Williams as Sookey.

In London, the play was directed by Peter Hall and opened at the Comedy Theatre on January 30, 1958. Kim Stanley starred as Maggie, Paul Massie as Brick, and Leo McKern as Big Daddy.

===Revivals===
A 1974 revival by the American Shakespeare Theatre featured Elizabeth Ashley, Keir Dullea, Fred Gwynne, Kate Reid, and Charles Siebert. Ashley was nominated for a Tony Award. For this production, Williams restored much of the text he had removed from the original at Kazan&#x27;s insistence. He included a revised third act and made substantial revisions elsewhere. According to Ashley, Williams allowed the actors to examine his original notes and various drafts of the script, and to make additions to the dialogue. When this production moved from Connecticut to Broadway, the part of Lacey was omitted and the number of Mae and Gooper&#x27;s children was reduced to three. In that same decade, John Carradine and Mercedes McCambridge toured in a road company production as Big Daddy and Big Mama.

The 1988 London National Theatre production, directed by Howard Davies, starred Ian Charleson, Lindsay Duncan, Barbara Leigh-Hunt, and Eric Porter.

A revival in 1990 featured Kathleen Turner, who was nominated for a Tony for her performance as Maggie, though &quot;New York&quot; magazine called her &quot;hopelessly lost ... in this limp production.&quot; Charles Durning, as Big Daddy, received a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play. Daniel Hugh Kelly was Brick, and Polly Holliday was Big Mama. Holliday also was nominated for a Tony.

A 2001 production at the Lyric Shaftesbury, London, was the first West End revival since 1958. Produced by Anthony Page, the production featured Brendan Fraser as Brick, Frances O&#x27;Connor as Maggie, Ned Beatty as Big Daddy, and Gemma Jones as Big Mamma. Reviews were generally positive.

A 2003 revival received lukewarm reviews despite the presence of film stars Ashley Judd and Jason Patric. Only Ned Beatty as Big Daddy and Margo Martindale as Big Mama were singled out for impressive performances. Martindale received a Tony nomination.

A 2003 revival for Belvoir St Theatre was directed by Simon Stone and starred Jacqueline McKenzie as Maggie, Ewen Leslie as Brick, and Marshall Napier as Big Daddy. This production was a box office hit, with the season extended to the Theatre Royal, Sydney.

A 2004 production at the Kennedy Center featured Mary Stuart Masterson as Maggie, Jeremy Davidson as Brick, George Grizzard as Big Daddy, Dana Ivey as Big Mama, and Emily Skinner as Mae. Shortly afterward, Masterson and Davidson married.

In 2008, an all-black production directed by Debbie Allen opened on Broadway. Terrence Howard made his Broadway debut as Brick, with James Earl Jones as Big Daddy, Phylicia Rashad as Big Mama, Anika Noni Rose as Maggie and Lisa Arrindell Anderson as Mae. In November 2009, the production moved to London&#x27;s West End, where Adrian Lester played Brick and Sanaa Lathan played Maggie. The West End Production received the 2010 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Revival of a Play.

In 2010, a production of the play opened at Cambridge University&#x27;s ADC Theatre, and in January 2011, a production to mark Williams&#x27;s 100th birthday was presented at the English Theatre in Vienna, Austria. In 2011, the play was performed at the Shaw Festival in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Canada, starring Maya O’Connell as Maggie and Gray Powell as Brick. This production moved to the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis in 2012.

A 2013 Broadway revival at the Richard Rodgers Theatre featured Ciarán Hinds as Big Daddy, Debra Monk as Big Mama, Benjamin Walker as Brick, George Porteous as Sonny, and Scarlett Johansson as Maggie.

A 2014 production played at Royal &amp; Derngate, Royal Exchange Theatre, and Northern Stage, with original music by White Lies. It featured Mariah Gale, Charles Aitken, Daragh O&#x27;Malley, and Kim Criswell, and was directed by James Dacre. In this production, O&#x27;Malley was singled out for his performance and won an MTA Award and Stage Nomination for his portrayal of Big Daddy.

The Berkshire Theatre Festival produced the play in 2016, under the direction of David Auburn, with Michael Raymond-James as Brick, Rebecca Brooksher as Maggie, Linda Gehringer as Big Mama, and Jim Beaver as Big Daddy.

The Young Vic&#x27;s 2018 production, directed by Benedict Andrews and starring Sienna Miller as Maggie, Jack O&#x27;Connell as Brick, Colm Meaney as Big Daddy, Lisa Palfrey as Big Mama, Hayley Squires as Mae, Brian Gleeson as Gooper, Richard Hansell as Baugh, and Michael J. Shannon as Reverend, was filmed at the Apollo Theatre for National Theatre Live. On March 10, 2021, the filmed production was added to the National Theatre Live&#x27;s streaming service: National Theatre At Home.

In 2022, the Tennessee Williams Estate granted the production company Ruth Stage the right to perform the show Off-Broadway for the first time in the play&#x27;s history. The show ran to largely positive reviews for 35 performances at the Theatre at St. Clements in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen. Because of the show&#x27;s success, the estate granted an unprecedented re-engagement for 41 more performances at the same theatre in the winter of 2023.

A London revival is scheduled to open at the Almeida Theatre in December 2024, starring Daisy Edgar-Jones as Margaret and Kingsley Ben-Adir as Brick. Further casting includes Lennie James, Guy Burgess, Clare Burt, Seb Carrington, Derek Hagen, Ukweli Roach, and Ria Zmitrowicz. The production will be directed by Rebecca Frecknall.

==Adaptations==

The big-screen adaptation was released by MGM in 1958 and starred Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman, Judith Anderson, and Jack Carson, with Burl Ives and Madeleine Sherwood reprising their stage roles. Critics said that film censors and directors diminished the motion picture&#x27;s authenticity. The Hays Code limited Brick&#x27;s portrayal of sexual desire for Skipper and diminished the play&#x27;s critique of homophobia and sexism. According to critic Emanuel Levy, George Cukor was initially assigned to direct the film, &quot;though issues of censorship—homosexuality in particular—prevented him from doing it&quot;. Director Richard Brooks&#x27;s version was criticized for toning down the play, specifically eliminating the homosexual theme. The film substituted hazy hero-worship for Williams&#x27;s strong suggestion of homosexuality. Williams was reportedly unhappy with the screenplay, which removed almost all the homosexual themes and revised the third act section to include a lengthy scene of reconciliation between Brick and Big Daddy. Paul Newman, the film&#x27;s star, also stated his disappointment with the adaptation. 

The film was highly acclaimed and was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman both received Oscar nominations for their performances.

In 1976, a TV version was produced, starring the then husband-and-wife team of Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner, and featuring Laurence Olivier as Big Daddy and Maureen Stapleton as Big Mama.

In 1984, another TV version was produced by American Playhouse, starring Jessica Lange, Tommy Lee Jones, Rip Torn, Kim Stanley, David Dukes, and Penny Fuller. This adaptation, directed by Jack Hofsiss, revived the sexual innuendos that the 1958 film muted. Both Stanley and Fuller were nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries, and Stanley won.

The 2016 Bollywood movie &quot;Kapoor &amp; Sons&quot; drew its inspiration from the play.

A new film adaptation was announced in 2021, with Antoine Fuqua directing and producing. The producers of the 2008 Broadway revival, Stephen C. Byrd and Alia Jones-Harvey, will also produce.

==Legacy==
In the world of pro wrestling the name &quot;Big Daddy&quot; would later be used by British pro wrestler Shirley Crabtree. Other wrestlers like Kevin Nash who was nicknamed &quot;Big Daddy Cool&quot; under his Diesel gimmick and Nelson Frazier went under the ring names Big Daddy V and Big Daddy Voodoo later in his career.

<text>Charles Piazzi Smyth (3 January 1819 – 21 February 1900) was a British astronomer who was Astronomer Royal for Scotland from 1846 to 1888; he is known for many innovations in astronomy and, along with his wife Jessica Duncan Piazzi Smyth, his pyramidological and metrological studies of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

==Astronomical career==
Charles Piazzi Smyth (pronounced ) was born in Naples, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, to Captain (later Admiral) William Henry Smyth and his wife the former Eliza Anne &quot;Annarella&quot; Warington. He was named Piazzi after his godfather, the Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi, whose acquaintance his father had made at Palermo when serving in the Mediterranean. His father subsequently settled at Bedford and equipped there an observatory, at which Piazzi Smyth received his first lessons in astronomy. He was educated at Bedford School until the age of sixteen when he became an assistant to Sir Thomas Maclear at the Cape of Good Hope, where he observed
Halley&#x27;s comet and the Great Comet of 1843, and took an active part in the verification and extension of Nicolas Louis de Lacaille&#x27;s arc of the meridian.

In 1846 he was appointed Astronomer Royal for Scotland, based at the Calton Hill Observatory in Edinburgh, and professor of astronomy in the University of Edinburgh. Shortly after his appointment, the observatory was placed under the control of Her Majesty&#x27;s Treasury and suffered from a long series of under-funding. Because of this, most of his notable work in astronomy was done elsewhere. Here he completed the reduction, and continued the series, of the observations made by his predecessor, Thomas James Henderson. In 1853, Smyth was responsible for installing the time ball on top of Nelson&#x27;s Monument in Edinburgh to give a time signal to the ships at Edinburgh&#x27;s port of Leith. By 1861, this visual signal was augmented by the One O&#x27;Clock Gun at Edinburgh Castle.

In 1704 Isaac Newton wrote in his book Opticks Book 1, Part 1:
&quot;... [telescopes] ... cannot be so formed as to take away that confusion of the Rays which arises from the Tremors of the Atmosphere. The only Remedy is a most serene and quiet Air, such as may perhaps be found on the tops of the highest Mountains above the grosser Clouds.&quot; This suggestion fell on deaf ears until in 1856, Smyth petitioned the Admiralty for a grant of £500 to take a telescope to the slopes of Teide in Tenerife (which he spelt Teneriffe) and test whether Newton had been right or not. In South Africa he had spent many nights observing from mountain tops but when he moved to Edinburgh had been appalled by the poor observing conditions there.

The Admiralty approved his grant and he was offered the loan of further equipment from many sources. Robert Stephenson loaned his 140-ton yacht &quot;Titania&quot; for the expedition. Mr. Hugh Pattinson loaned his refracting telescope of . This was a Thomas Cooke equatorial with setting circles and a driving clock. The Crimean War had recently concluded and the army offered to lend tents. This offer was declined as Piazzi Smyth had already designed a tent with a sewn-in groundsheet based on his experience in South Africa.

On this and all his subsequent trips he was accompanied by his wife whom he had married the year before. In 1856, on reaching Tenerife they first set up camp on Mount Guajara, a peak about south of Teide (all heights on Tenerife are those he derived barometrically). It was higher than all its neighbours and free from any volcanic activity. They took all their equipment up loaded on mules, except for the Pattinson telescope which was much too bulky. They stayed there a month making astronomical, meteorological and geological observations. He made observations of the steadiness and clarity of star images with the 3.6-inch (9 cm) Sheepshanks telescope and found both much better than at Edinburgh. He also made the first positive detection of heat coming from the Moon. However, they were annoyed by frequent dust incursions which frequently blotted out the horizon. Even when the dust was at its worst, the transparency at the zenith was better than at Edinburgh.

The dust was evidently confined to individual layers, so he decided to move to Alta Vista at , on the eastern slope of Teide, the highest point that mules could reach. He was determined to use the larger Pattinson telescope and returned to La Orotava to fetch it. As the three boxes were too heavy, they were opened and the contents distributed among several smaller boxes which were loaded on to seven strong horses. The telescope was soon mounted and in action. The Airy Disc was clearly seen and he made many critical observations and fine drawings. They spent a month there during which they spent a day climbing to the summit of Teide at .

The scientific results were described in reports addressed to the Lord Commissioners of the Admiralty, the Royal Society, and the &quot;Astronomical Observations made at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh Vol XII 1863&quot;, which were widely acclaimed. Piazzi Smyth was the pioneer of the modern practice of placing telescopes at high altitudes to enjoy the best observing conditions.

He wrote a popular account of the voyage in &quot;Teneriffe, an astronomers Experiment&quot;. This was the first book ever illustrated by stereoscopic photographs (&quot;photo-stereographs&quot;). It included 20 stereoviews of Teneriffe taken by the author using the wet collodion process. A stereoscope could be purchased which allowed the pictures to be viewed in 3-D without removing them from the book.

In 1871 and 1872 Smyth investigated the spectra of the aurora, and zodiacal light. He recommended the use of the rain-band for weather forecasting and discovered, in conjunction with Alexander Stewart Herschel, the harmonic relation between the rays emitted by carbon monoxide. In 1877–1878 he constructed at Lisbon a map of the solar spectrum for which he received the Makdougall Brisbane Prize in 1880. Smyth carried out further spectroscopic researches at Madeira in 1880 and at Winchester in 1884.

In 1888 Smyth resigned as Astronomer Royal in protest at the chronic under-funding and age of his equipment. This brought events to a head and the Royal Observatory was almost closed when James Lindsay, Earl of Crawford made a donation of new astronomical instruments and the complete &quot;Bibliotheca Lindesiana&quot; in order that a new observatory could be founded. Thanks to this donation, the new Royal Observatory on Blackford Hill was opened in 1896. After his resignation, Smyth retired to the neighborhood of Ripon, where he remained until his death.

==Pyramidological researches==

Smyth corresponded with pyramid theorist John Taylor and was heavily influenced by him. Taylor theorized in his 1859 book &quot;The Great Pyramid: Why Was It Built? &amp; Who Built It?&quot; that the Great Pyramid was planned and the building supervised by the biblical Noah. Refused a grant by the Royal Society, Smyth went on an expedition to Egypt in order to accurately measure every surface, dimension, and aspect of the Great Pyramid. He brought along equipment to measure the dimensions of the stones, the precise angle of sections such as the descending passage, and a specially designed camera to photograph both the interior and exterior of the pyramid. He also used other instruments to make astronomical calculations and determine the pyramid&#x27;s accurate latitude and longitude.

Smyth subsequently published his book &quot;Our Inheritance in the Great Pyramid&quot; in 1864 (which he expanded over the years and is also titled &quot;The Great Pyramid: Its Secrets and Mysteries Revealed&quot;). Smyth claimed that the measurements he obtained from the Great Pyramid of Giza indicated a unit of length, the pyramid inch, equivalent to 1.001 British inches, that could have been the standard of measurement by the pyramid&#x27;s architects. From this he extrapolated a number of other measurements, including the pyramid pint, the sacred cubit, and the pyramid scale of temperature.

Smyth claimed that the pyramid inch was a God-given measure handed down through the centuries from the time of Shem (Noah&#x27;s Son), and that the architects of the pyramid could only have been directed by the hand of God. To support this Smyth said that, in measuring the pyramid, he found the number of inches in the perimeter of the base equaled one hundred times the number of days in a year, and found a numeric relationship between the height of the pyramid in inches to the distance from Earth to the Sun, measured in statute miles. He also advanced the theory that the Great Pyramid was a repository of prophecies which could be revealed by detailed measurements of the structure. Working upon theories by Taylor, he conjectured that the Hyksos were the Hebrew people, and that they built the Great Pyramid under the leadership of Melchizedek. Because the pyramid inch was a divine unit of measurement, Smyth, a committed proponent of British Israelism, used his conclusions as an argument against the introduction of the metric system in Britain. For much of his life he was a vocal opponent of the metric system, which he considered a product of the minds of atheistic French radicals, a position advocated in many of his works.

Smyth, despite his bad reputation in Egyptological circles today, performed much valuable work at Giza. He made the most accurate measurements of the Great Pyramid that any explorer had made up to that time, and he photographed the interior passages, using a magnesium light, for the first time. Smyth&#x27;s work resulted in many drawings and calculations, which were soon incorporated into his books &quot;Our Inheritance in the Great Pyramid&quot;, the three-volume &quot;Life and Work at the Great Pyramid&quot; (1867), and &quot;On the Antiquity of Intellectual Man&quot; (1868). For his works he was awarded the Keith gold medal for 1865–67 by the Royal Society of Edinburgh, but in 1874, the Royal Society of London rejected his paper on the design of Khufu&#x27;s pyramid, as they had Taylor&#x27;s. The rejection of his ideas helped contribute to his resignation from his post as Royal Astronomer in 1888.

==Influence of Smyth&#x27;s pyramid theories==
Smyth&#x27;s theories on pyramid prophecy were then integrated into the works and prophecies of Charles Taze Russell (such as his &quot;Studies in the Scriptures&quot;), who founded the Bible Student movement (who adopted the name Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in 1931, though Russell&#x27;s successor, Joseph F. Rutherford, denounced pyramidology as unscriptural). Smyth&#x27;s proposed dates for the Second Coming, first 1882 then many dates between 1892 and 1911, were failed predictions.

The theories of Taylor and Smyth gained many eminent supporters and detractors in the field of Egyptology during the late 1800s, but by the end of the 19th century it had lost most of its mainstream scientific support. The greatest blow to the theory was dealt by the great Egyptogist William Matthew Flinders Petrie, who had initially been a supporter. When Petrie went to Egypt in 1880 to perform new measurements, he found that the pyramid was several feet smaller than previously believed. This so undermined the theory that Petrie rejected it, writing:

==Marriage, family, and death==

In 1855 Smyth married Jessica &quot;Jessie&quot; Duncan (1812–1896), daughter of Thomas Duncan. Jessie Duncan was a geologist who had studied with Alexander Rose in Edinburgh, and travelled on geological expeditions to Ireland, France, Switzerland and Italy.

Smyth&#x27;s brothers were Warington Wilkinson Smyth and Henry Augustus Smyth. His sisters were Henrietta Grace Smyth, who married Reverend Baden Powell and was mother of Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell (founder of the world Scouting Movement), Georgiana Rosetta Smyth, who married William Henry Flower; and Ellen Philadelphia Smyth, who married Captain Henry Toynbee of the HEIC.

Smyth died in 1900 and was buried at St. John&#x27;s Church in the village of Sharow near Ripon. A small stone pyramid-shaped monument, topped by a Christian cross, marks his gravesite.

==Honours==
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1846, and served on its council for a number of years. In June 1857 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, but resigned in 1874. He was conferred with Honorary Membership of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland in 1859. The crater Piazzi Smyth on the moon is named after him.

<text>Kilkenny ( , meaning &#x27;church of Cainnech&#x27;) is a city in County Kilkenny, Ireland. It is located in the South-East Region and in the province of Leinster. It is built on both banks of the River Nore. The 2022 census gave the population of Kilkenny as 27,184, the thirteenth-largest urban center in Ireland.

Kilkenny is a tourist destination, and its environs include historic buildings such as Kilkenny Castle, St Canice&#x27;s Cathedral and round tower, Rothe House, Shee Alms House, Black Abbey, St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, The Tholsel, St. Francis Abbey, Grace&#x27;s Castle, and St. John&#x27;s Priory. Kilkenny is also known for its craft and design workshops, the Watergate Theatre, public gardens and museums. Annual events include Kilkenny Arts Festival, the Cat Laughs comedy festival and music at the Kilkenny Roots Festival.

Kilkenny began with an early 6th-century ecclesiastical foundation within the Kingdom of Ossory. Following the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland, Kilkenny Castle and a series of walls were built to protect the burghers of what became a Norman merchant town. William Marshall, Lord of Leinster, gave Kilkenny a charter as a town in 1207. By the late 13th century, Kilkenny was under Hiberno-Norman control. The Statutes of Kilkenny, passed at Kilkenny in 1367, aimed to curb the decline of the Hiberno-Norman Lordship of Ireland. In 1609, King James I of England granted Kilkenny a Royal Charter, giving it the status of a city. Following the Irish Rebellion of 1641, the Irish Catholic Confederation, also known as the &quot;Confederation of Kilkenny&quot;, was based in Kilkenny and lasted until the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649. From 1840 onwards, Kilkenny has not been administered as a city under local government law, but the Local Government Reform Act 2014 provides for &quot;the continued use of the description city&quot;.

Kilkenny was a brewing centre from the late 17th century, and still houses a number of breweries. The Heritage Council offices are at Church Lane in the former Bishop&#x27;s Palace. The seat of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Ossory is at St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral and the Church of Ireland Bishop of Cashel and Ossory is at St Canice&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Toponymy==
Kilkenny is the anglicised version of the Irish , meaning &quot;Cell/Church of Cainneach or Canice&quot;. This relates to a church built in honour of St. Canice, an Ulsterman, on the hill now containing St. Canice&#x27;s Cathedral and the round tower. This seems to be the first major settlement. The early Christian origin of the round tower suggests an early ecclesiastical foundation at Kilkenny.

The &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; recorded Kilkenny in 1085. Prior to this time the early 6th-century territory was known as &quot;Osraighe,&quot; referring to the whole district or the capital. The Four Masters entry was the first instance where the capital was called &quot;Ceall-Cainnigh&quot; (modernised Kilkenny). Cill Chainnigh was a major monastic centre from at least the eighth century. There is no mention of &quot;Cill Chainnigh&quot; in the lives of Cainnech of Aghaboe, Ciarán of Saighir or any of the early annals of Ireland suggesting that Cill Chainnigh was not of ancient civil importance.

==History==

Kilkenny&#x27;s foundation began with an early 6th-century ecclesiastical settlement, with a church built in honour of St. Canice. Now St. Canice&#x27;s Cathedral, this was a major monastic centre from at least the 8th century. The &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; recorded the first reference &quot;Cill Chainnigh&quot; in 1085. Prehistoric activity has been recorded, suggesting intermittent settlement activity in the area in the Mesolithic and Bronze Age. Information on the history of Kilkenny can be found in newspapers, photographs, letters, drawings, manuscripts and archaeology. Kilkenny is documented in manuscripts from the 13th century onwards and one of the most important of these is &quot;Liber Primus Kilkenniensis&quot;.

The Kings of Ossory, O&#x27;Carrolls and Fitzpatricks, had residence around Cill Chainnigh. The seat of the diocese of Kingdom of Osraige was moved from Aghaboe to Cill Chainnigh. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland, Richard Strongbow, as Lord of Leinster, established a castle near modern-day Kilkenny Castle. William Marshall began the development of the town of Kilkenny and a series of walls to protect the burghers. By the late 13th century, Kilkenny was under Norman-Irish control. The original ecclesiastical centre at St. Canice&#x27;s Cathedral became known as Irishtown and the Anglo-Norman borough inside the wall came to be known as Hightown.

Kilkenny was the site of Ireland&#x27;s earliest recorded witch trial. Occurring in 1324 and instigated by the then Bishop of Ossory, Richard de Ledrede, the trial involved Dame Alice de Kyteler and her servant Petronella de Meath. Petronella would be the first person recorded in Ireland to be burned alive at the stake for witchcraft, after Dame Alice presumably fled the country. This trial was also one of the earliest recorded witch burnings in Europe and inspires much folklore about the possibility of the ghosts of Alice and Petronella haunting downtown Kilkenny. Alice&#x27;s house, Kyteler&#x27;s Inn, still stands and is now a pub.

The Hiberno-Norman presence in Kilkenny was deeply shaken by the Black Death, which arrived in 1348. The Statutes of Kilkenny passed at Kilkenny in 1367, aimed to curb the decline of the Hiberno-Norman Lordship of Ireland. In 1609, King James I of England granted Kilkenny a Royal Charter giving it the status of a city. Following the Rebellion of 1641, the Irish Catholic Confederation, also known as the &quot;Confederation of Kilkenny&quot;, was based in Kilkenny and lasted until the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649. James II of England spent most of the winter months from November 1689 until January 1690 at Kilkenny, residing in the castle.

Stephens Barracks, built in the years following the 1798 Rebellion, was completed between 1800 and 1803.

The Kilkenny Design Workshops were opened in 1965 and in 1967 the Marquess of Ormonde presented Kilkenny Castle to the people of Kilkenny. Today, it has a lively cultural scene, with annual events including the Kilkenny Arts Week Festival in the last two weeks of August, and the Cat Laughs Comedy Festival at the beginning of June. Kilkenny is also where the Irish ale, Smithwick&#x27;s, was first brewed. Kilkenny is referred to as the &quot;Marble City&quot;, and people from Kilkenny are often referred to as &#x27;Cats&#x27;. The seat of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Ossory is at St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral and the Church of Ireland Bishop of Cashel and Ossory is at St. Canice&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Demographics==

===Population===
The majority of the population of Kilkenny live outside the borough&#x27;s boundary. The urban centre of Kilkenny, as defined by the census, had a population of 27,184 in 2022.

Changes as of the 2006 census, by the Central Statistics Office, Kilkenny Town Borough had a population of 8,661 which was an increase of 70 persons over the 2002 figure of 8,591 or 0.8%. The Town Environs had a population of 13,518 which was an increase of 1347 persons over the 2002 figure of 12,144 or 11.3%. Overall both the Borough &amp; Environs had a population of 22,179 in 2006 which was an increase of 1444 persons over the 2002 figure of 20,735 or 7.0%. People from Kilkenny are often referred to as &#x27;Cats&#x27;.

Disposable household income per person as of 2005 was €18,032 and the index of disposable household was 89.4.

===Languages and religions===
Kilkenny is multilingual but predominantly English-speaking, with Irish being the second most commonly spoken language. In recent decades, with the increase of immigration on an all-Ireland basis, many more languages have been introduced into Kilkenny.

The main religion is Catholicism, however, there are Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, Methodist, Jewish and other religious traditions living in Kilkenny.

==Administration==
Kilkenny is now administered as part of County Kilkenny. The local electoral area of Kilkenny contains the electoral divisions of Dunmore, Kilkenny No. 1 Urban, Kilkenny No. 2 Urban, Kilkenny Rural and St. Canice, and elects 7 of the 24 members of Kilkenny County Council. This area is defined as the Municipal District of Kilkenny City. Local government bodies in Kilkenny have responsibility for such matters as planning, roads, sanitation and libraries and are governed by the Local Government Acts 1925 to 2019, the principal Act being the Local Government Act 2001.

Kilkenny&#x27;s first council was elected in 1231. From the 13th century to the end of the 16th, the chief magistrate was known as the sovereign, and since then as the mayor. It was granted a royal charter as a city in 1609 by James I of England and Ireland. This was a county corporate which included the borough of Irishtown, which fell within the city. The borough corporation established under the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 is a successor to both the corporation established under this charter and of the borough of Irishtown. In 1899, under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, the area became an urban district, but its council retained the style of a borough corporation. In 2002, under the Local Government Act 2001, Kilkenny Borough Corporation became a borough council. On 1 June 2014, under the Local Government Reform Act 2014, the borough council was dissolved and administration of the town was amalgamated with Kilkenny County Council.

County Kilkenny is part of the Southern Region. It is part of the Carlow–Kilkenny Dáil constituency and the South European Parliament constituency.

In the Irish House of Commons, both Kilkenny City and the bishop&#x27;s borough of St Canice (or Irishtown) were represented with two MPs each. From 1801, following the Acts of Union 1800, Kilkenny City was represented in the United Kingdom House of Commons by one MP from 1801 to 1918, and as part of North Kilkenny from 1918 to 1922. In 1921, the Carlow–Kilkenny Dáil constituency was created. This continued until 1937, when there was a separate Kilkenny constituency, but from 1948 there has been a continuous constituency of Carlow–Kilkenny.

===City status===
 While the present-day settlement is administered as a municipal district, the appellation &quot;city&quot; is an emotive subject in Kilkenny. Historically, city status in the United Kingdom, and before that in the Kingdom of Ireland, was a ceremonial designation awarded by the crown. It carried more prestige than the alternative municipal titles &quot;borough&quot; or &quot;town&quot;, but gave no additional legal powers (the qualifying factor was the presence of a cathedral, resulting in some very small cities such as Wells, with a population 12,000 as of 2018 and St Davids, with a population of 1,841 as of 2011). A city in Irish law has special legal meaning with corresponding powers for local government. From a local government perspective, Kilkenny has not been administered as a city since at least 1840. The present-day legal, political and administrative jurisdictions in Ireland are set out in the Local Government Act 2001, as amended by the Local Government Reform Act 2014.

In 2002, under the Local Government Act 2001, the former five county boroughs were redesignated as cities. At the same time, the historic city status of Kilkenny was acknowledged in law. When this legislation was being debated, local TDs Phil Hogan and John McGuinness successfully lobbied that Kilkenny could continue to be referred to as a &quot;city&quot;. Accordingly, a clause was added to the 2001 bill:
It remains both common and permissible in law to describe Kilkenny as a city; section 10(6) of the 2001 Act, as amended by the 2014 Act, provides that &quot;the continued use of the description city in relation to Kilkenny, to the extent that that description was used before 1 January 2002 and is not otherwise inconsistent with this Act&quot;.

As of 2014, Kilkenny does not have an administration separate from the county. However, under Local Government Reform Act 2014, the municipal district is distinctly acknowledged as &quot;the Municipal District of Kilkenny City&quot;.

==Landmarks==

Kilkenny&#x27;s architectural heritage is represented through a number of historical buildings and landmarks. Kilkenny is a well-preserved medieval town and is dominated by both Kilkenny Castle and St. Canice&#x27;s Cathedral and round tower.

Surviving examples of the city&#x27;s medieval architecture include Kilkenny Castle and parts of the Kilkenny City Walls. These walls define the extent, layout and status of the medieval town. The town grew from a monastic settlement to a thriving Norman merchant town in the Middle Ages. St. Canice&#x27;s Cathedral and round tower are an example of the monastic settlement. Rothe House on Parliament Street is an example of an Elizabethan merchant townhouse located on the only completely surviving burgage plot in Ireland. It also features a restored 17th-century garden on an area of half an acre behind the house, complete with herbs, vegetables and an orchard.

The black stone with decorative white fossils that forms the backbone of many of Kilkenny&#x27;s fine buildings was quarried locally, particularly from the quarry located 1.6 km south of the town on the R700. Kilkenny marble was used for the plinth of the new tomb of Richard III in Leicester Cathedral in England.

Visitor attractions in Kilkenny and its environs include Kilkenny Castle and Gardens including the Butler Gallery, St. Canice&#x27;s Cathedral and round tower, Rothe House and Garden, Shee Alms House, Kilkenny Courthouse, St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, The Tholsel, the Dominican Black Abbey, St. John&#x27;s Church, Butler House, Kilkenny &#x27;Slips&#x27; and St. Francis Abbey Brewery. Gardens include the Castle Rose Garden, Rothe House Garden, the Famine Memorial Garden and the garden of Butler House.

In the county other attractions include Kells Priory, Jerpoint Abbey, Dunmore Caves, Woodstock Estate and Jenkinstown Park.

Local Kilkenny marble or black marble was used to decorate many of the city&#x27;s buildings, and Kilkenny referred to the &quot;Marble City&quot; for this reason.

===Kilkenny Castle and city walls===

Kilkenny Castle in Kilkenny city was the seat of the Butler family. (Formerly the family name was FitzWalter.) The castle was sold to the local Castle Restoration Committee in the middle of the 20th century for £50. Shortly afterwards it was handed over to the State, and has since been refurbished and is open to visitors. Part of the collection of the National Art Gallery is on display in the castle. There are ornamental gardens on the northwest side of the castle, and extensive land and gardens to the front. It has become one of the most visited tourist sites in Ireland.

The first stone castle was begun in 1204 by William Marshall the site was completed in 1213; it was a symbol of Norman occupation and in its original thirteenth-century condition it would have formed an important element of the defences of the town. There were four large circular corner towers and a massive ditch, part of which can still be seen today on the Parade. This was a square-shaped castle with towers at each corner; three of these original four towers survive to this day.

&quot;Kilkenny Walls&quot; protected the medieval town of Kilkenny. The town was surrounded by walls with regular towers and gates. Remnants of the Town Walls survive such as Talbot Tower (1207), which is also known as Talbot&#x27;s Bastion or Castle. It is the larger of the two surviving towers of the defences of the medieval High town of Kilkenny. There are walls on Abbey Street, and the adjoining Black Freren Gate is the only surviving gate/access remaining on the High town Circuit into the old city. A wall also runs through the brewery&#x27;s grounds beside St. Francis Abbey.

The Kilkenny City Walls Conservation Plan is a plan by the inhabitants of Kilkenny, Kilkenny Borough Council, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, An Taisce, The Kilkenny Archaeological Society and The Heritage Council to ensure the long-term survival of the city&#x27;s walls.

St Canice&#x27;s Cathedral, also known as Kilkenny Cathedral, present building dates from the 13th century and is the second longest cathedral in Ireland. The cathedral is named after Saint Canice, who also gave his name to the town.

Cruciform, the cathedral was built in the Early English, or English Gothic, style of architecture, of limestone, with a low central tower supported on black marble columns. The exterior walls, apart from the gables, are embattled, and there are two small spires at the west end. The cathedral is seventy-five yards long, and its width along the transepts is forty-one yards.

Beside the cathedral stands a 100 ft 9th century round tower. St. Canice&#x27;s tower is an excellent example of a well-preserved early Christian (9th century) Round Tower. Accessible only by a steep set of internal ladders, it may once have been both a watchtower and a refuge, and the summit gives a good view of Kilkenny and the countryside around. The hill on which the cathedral stands is believed to be the centre of the first major settlement at Kilkenny, and the round tower suggests an early ecclesiastical foundation.

Dominican Black Abbey was founded in 1225, and lying just off Parliament Street.

===Bridges===

Kilkenny has four main bridges — Green&#x27;s Bridge, John&#x27;s Bridge, the Ossory Bridge and the St Francis Bridge — and two pedestrian/cycle bridges — the Lady Desart Bridge and the Ossory Pedestrian Bridge. Each of the bridges spans the River Nore.

Green&#x27;s Bridge, also known as the &#x27;Great Bridge of Kilkenny&#x27;, crosses the River Nore in St. Canices Parish in the townland of Gardens, and is an important element of the architectural heritage of Kilkenny City. First built before 1200, the bridge has been rebuilt several times since the twelfth century due to flooding, including the great floods of 1487 and 1763. The present-day bridge was built in 1766 after the &#x27;Great Flood of 1763&#x27;. It was built by William Colles (c. 1710–70) to designs prepared by George Smith (1763–67), a pupil of George Semple (c. 1700–82).

John&#x27;s Bridge connects John Street to Rose Inn Street in Kilkenny City. It was first built after 1200, and has been called &#x27;John&#x27;s Bridge&#x27; since the Middle Ages. It has also been rebuilt many times since the twelfth century due to flooding. During the flood of 1763, people gathered on John&#x27;s Bridge after Green&#x27;s Bridge collapsed. John&#x27;s Bridge also collapsed, and sixteen people died. The present-day John&#x27;s Bridge was completed in 1910 and spans across the River Nore. It was reputedly, at the time it was completed, the longest single-span reinforced bridge in Ireland or Britain. The design was by Mouchel &amp; Partners using the Hennebique system of reinforcement. The arch consists of three ribs, tapering from to deep. The traverse deck beams are each deep.

The Ossory Bridge, linking the ring road, was completed in 1984 and features an inlaid sculpture. St Francis Bridge was opened in May 2017, and forms part of the Kilkenny Central Access Scheme. The scheme and the proposed building of the new bridge was the subject of some debate and protest in Kilkenny in 2014.

Lady Desart Bridge and Ossory Pedestrian bridge are the city&#x27;s two pedestrian/cycle bridges. Lady Desart Bridge was opened in January 2014 and links John&#x27;s Quay and Bateman Quay and is located between John&#x27;s Bridge and Green&#x27;s Bridge. The Ossory Pedestrian bridge, located underneath the main Ossory bridge, links the Canal Walk on one side of the River Nore to the Lacken Walk on the other side.

===Old Woollen Mills===
The Old Woollen Mills was built in the 1800s and is located on the north side of the city, on Bleach Road. It was one of the largest employers in the area; the site covers and has more than a mile of river frontage onto the Nore. Among its many features is a freestanding red brick chimney, erected in 1905. An architectural salvage and antique yard, Kilkenny Architectural Salvage, is currently located on the site.

==Culture==


Kilkenny is a popular tourist destination in the South-East Region of Ireland. Its art galleries, historic buildings, craft and design workshops, theatre, comedy, public gardens and museums are some of the main reasons Kilkenny has become one of Ireland&#x27;s most visited towns and a base from which to explore the surrounding countryside.

Points of cultural interest in the area include Kilkenny Castle, St. Canice&#x27;s Cathedral and round tower, Rothe House, St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Kells Priory, Kilkenny Town Hall, Black Abbey and Butler Gallery.

===Theatre===

Kilkenny had a tradition of dramatic performance going back to 1366 when the Dublin company set up in Kilkenny. Henry Burkhead printed a play in Kilkenny, &quot;Cola&#x27;s Fury, or Lirenda&#x27;s Misery&quot; (1645), dealing with events of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 from an English standpoint. It was a blatantly political work with the Lirenda of the title being an anagram of Ireland. In 1642, as a result of the English Civil War, Dublin Royalists were forced to flee the city. Many of them went to Kilkenny to join a confederacy of Old English and Irish that formed in that city.

In 1802 Sir Richard and Sir John Power of Kilfane established the Kilkenny Private Theatre.

The Watergate Theatre in Kilkenny is a centre for the performing and visual arts. It provides a varied programme of professional and amateur dramatics, classical and contemporary music, opera and dance, together with exhibitions of paintings and photographs.

===Education===

Kilkenny is the home of many noted secondary schools, including the Church of Ireland Kilkenny College, founded in 1538. This is one of the oldest schools in the country, and its past pupils include Jonathan Swift and George Berkeley.

&quot;A quote from an article &quot;The Berkeley Pavilion&quot; by Patsy Dempsey – Bishop George Berkeley (1685–1753) was one of the great philosophers of his time. He was born near Kilkenny and lived in Dysart Castle, Thomastown. Berkeley studied at Kilkenny College (now County Hall) from 1696–1700, where Jonathan Swift was a predecessor.&quot;
St. Kieran&#x27;s College was founded in 1782 and was the first Roman Catholic secondary school in Ireland. It was created after Grattan&#x27;s Parliament which permitted some relaxation of the Penal Laws in the country. St. Patrick&#x27;s Industrial School, Kilkenny was founded in 1879, and closed in 1966.

===Industry===

The city has a history of brewing and was home to St. Francis Abbey Brewery which was founded in the early 18th century by Messrs Cole and Smithwick. The Guinness Ireland Group owned this brewery since the 1960s. At the beginning of the 21st century, Guinness merged with Grand Metropolitan plc to form Diageo, the world&#x27;s largest alcoholic beverage business, and the brewery became part of Diageo Global Supply. In its final years, Smithwick&#x27;s Ale formed only a small percentage of production there. Another product was Kilkenny ale, a close relation of Smithwick&#x27;s ale. Some 80% of the beer produced at the brewery was Budweiser, a brand not owned by Diageo, but produced under licence. Diageo announced in May 2008 the closure of St. Francis Abbey Brewery, which took place on 31 December 2013. Production was then moved to St. James&#x27;s Gate Brewery, Dublin.

====Cooperatives====
Kilkenny is also home to the head offices of Glanbia, one of the world&#x27;s top dairy companies. Glanbia was formed by the merger of two dairy businesses: Avonmore and Waterford Foods and has interests in Ireland, the United Kingdom, the United States and more than 30 other countries.

County Kilkenny Village Creameries amalgamated to create the Avonmore Creameries brand in 1966. That coop became Avonmore Food plc in 1988 and joined with Waterford Food plc in 1997. It is today known as the global Food giant, Glanbia, one of the world&#x27;s top nutrition companies, with revenues of over €3.5 billion and 5,815 employees.

In 1966 over 30 local creameries created by local farmers joined with other small rural co-operative societies throughout County Kilkenny and some neighbouring counties, and together with Unigate Limited support, formed the Avonmore Creameries Federation. According to the Glanbia Collections in Kilkenny Archives at St Kieran&#x27;s College, Kilkenny, the Avonmore Coop brand was created through the merger of several dozen village creameries throughout County Kilkenny. Realising the benefits of increased scale and greater diversification in the 1960s, they saw the need for an amalgamation of many small, locally focused co-operatives across Ireland. It led to the construction of a new multi-purpose Avonmore dairy plant facility in Ballyragget, County Kilkenny, a plant they claimed was the biggest food processing facility in Europe at that time. Today that giant global entity is known as Glanbia. Glanbia has its origins in the Irish agricultural co-operative movement that evolved over the last century, ever since first Irish Co-operative founded by Horace Plunkett in 1889. Today Glanbia has operations in 34 countries and is exporting to more than 100 countries worldwide. Glanbia is ranked by revenue (2010 figures) in the top 100 Cooperatives, No 98 in the world and No 1 in Ireland by the International Co-operative Alliance, the global apex organisation of co-operatives worldwide.

The Ballyhale C.D.S. (1895–1995) 100th-anniversary booklet of its foundation records that a federation of 25 Co-op Creameries originally emerged in January 1965 under the umbrella of Avonmore Creameries Ltd., that shares were taken in the new entity by the society and that in following years a Ballyragget milk processing factory was built. Ireland entered the Common Market in 1970. The first bulk milk collection took place in 1973, when the amalgamation was formalised.

<doc id="92632" wikidata="Q169923" url="?curid=92632" title="County Galway">
<text>County Galway ( ; ) is a county in Ireland. It is in the Northern and Western Region, taking up the south of the province of Connacht. The county population was 276,451 at the 2022 census.

There are several Irish-speaking areas in the west of the county. The traditional county includes the city of Galway, but the city and county are separate local government areas, administered by the local authorities of Galway City Council in the urban area and Galway County Council in the rest of the county.

==History==

The first inhabitants in the Galway area arrived around the 5th millennium BC. Shell middens indicate the existence of people as early as 5000 BC.

The county originally comprised several kingdoms and territories which predate the formation of the county. These kingdoms included , , , , and . County Galway became an official entity around 1569 AD. The region known as Connemara retains a distinct identity within the county, though its boundaries are unclear, and it may account for as much as one third, or as little as 20%, of the county.

The county includes a number of inhabited islands, such as the Aran Islands () and Inishbofin ().

With the arrival of Christianity many monasteries were built in the county. Monasteries kept written records of events in the area and of its people. These were followed by a number of law-tracts, genealogies, annals and miscellaneous accounts. Extant manuscripts containing references to Galway include:

==Irish language==
Nearly 20% of the population of County Galway live in areas classed as Gaeltachts (Irish-speaking districts). County Galway is home to the largest Gaeltacht Irish-speaking region in Ireland. There are over 48,000 people living within this region, which extends from Galway city westwards through Connemara. The region consists of the following Irish-speaking areas: Galway City Gaeltacht (parts of the city), Gaeltacht Cois Fharraige, Conamara Theas, Aran Islands, and Duiche Sheoigheach (a part of the northern Galway region known as &quot;Joyce Country&quot; and Maam Valley).

All schools within the Gaeltacht use the Irish language for classroom instruction. There is also a third-level constituent college of NUIG called Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge in Carraroe and Carna. Clifden is the largest town in the region. Galway City is also home to Ireland&#x27;s only Irish-language theatre, Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe. There is a strong Irish-language media presence in this area too, which boasts the radio station Raidió na Gaeltachta and &quot;Foinse&quot; newspaper in Carraroe and national TV station TG4 in Baile na hAbhann. The Aran Islands are also part of the Galway Gaeltacht.

According to Census 2016, 84,249 people in County Galway claimed they could speak Irish. According to Census 2011, the Galway city and county Gaeltacht has a population of 48,907, of which 30,978 said they could speak Irish; 23,788 classed themselves as native Irish speakers, while 7,190 speak Irish daily only within the classroom. There are 3,006 attending the ten Gaelscoil (Irish language primary schools) and three Gaelcholáiste (Irish language secondary schools) outside the Galway Gaeltacht. According to the Irish Census 2016, there are 9,445 people in the county who identify themselves as being daily Irish speakers outside the education system.

==Local government and politics==

Galway City Council and Galway County Council are the local authorities for the respective local government areas. The local government area of County Galway includes some suburbs of the city not within the city area. Each local authority is responsible for certain local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, the collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing.

Under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, County Galway was divided into the urban districts of Ballinasloe and Galway, and the rural districts of Ballinasloe No. 1, Clifden, Galway, Glennamaddy, Gort, Loughrea, Mount Bellew, Oughterard, Portumna, and Tuam. Loughrea, within the rural district of Loughrea, and Tuam, within the rural district of Tuam, had town commissioners. The rural districts were abolished in 1925.

In 1937, the urban district of Galway became the borough of Galway, remaining part of County Galway. In 1986, the borough of Galway became the county borough of Galway and ceased to part of County Galway. In 2002, all county boroughs were redefined as cities.

In 2002, the urban district of Ballinasloe and the town commissioners of Loughrea and Tuam became town councils. All town councils in Ireland were abolished in 2014.

As part of the Northern and Western Region, Galway County Council has three representatives and Galway City Council has two representatives on the Northern and Western Regional Assembly.

The county is part of three Dáil constituencies: Galway East (3 seats), Galway West (5 seats) and Roscommon–Galway (5 seats). It is part of the Midlands–North-West constituency for European elections.

==Geography==
County Galway is home to Na Beanna Beola (Twelve Bens) mountain range, Na Sléibhte Mhám Toirc (the Maum Turk mountains), and the low mountains of Sliabh Echtghe (Slieve Aughty). The highest point in the county is one of the Twelve Bens, Benbaun, at 729m.

===Lakes===
County Galway is partly home to a number of Ireland&#x27;s largest lakes including Lough Corrib (the largest lake in the Republic of Ireland), Lough Derg and Lough Mask. The county is also home to a large number of smaller lakes, many of which are in the Connemara region. These include Lough Anaserd, Ardderry Lough, Aughrusbeg Lough, Ballycuirke Lough, Ballynahinch Lake, Lough Bofin, Lough Cutra, Derryclare Lough, Lough Fee, Glendollagh Lough, Lough Glenicmurrin, Lough Inagh, Kylemore Lough, Lettercraffroe Lough, Maumeen Lough, Lough Nafooey, Lough Rea, Ross Lake and Lough Shindilla.

===Climate===
The location of County Galway, situated on the west coast of Ireland, allows it to be directly influenced by the Gulf Stream. Temperature extremes are rare and short lived, though inland areas, particularly east of the Corrib, can boast some of the highest recorded temperatures of the summer in the island of Ireland (sometimes exceeding 30 °C); though these temperatures only occur when land warmed east winds sweep the area; the opposite effect can occur in the winter. Overall, however, Galway is influenced mainly by Atlantic airstreams which bring ample rainfall in between the fleeting sunshine. Rainfall occurs in every month of the year, though the late autumn and winter months can be particularly wet as Atlantic cyclonic activity increases and passes over and around the area, and which is why Galway tends to bear the brunt of severe windstorms that can occur between August and March. The county on average receives about 1300mm of rainfall annually, though some areas along the west coast of the county can receive up to 1900mm and beyond. Extreme weather such as blizzards, thunderstorms, flash flooding and hail, though rare, can and do occur, particularly when air masses of continental origin are undercut by more humid and unstable Atlantic flows.

<text>County Roscommon () is a county in Ireland. It is part of the province of Connacht and the Northern and Western Region. It is the 11th largest Irish county by area and 26th most populous. Its county town and largest town is Roscommon. Roscommon County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county was 69,995 as of the 2022 census.

==Etymology==
County Roscommon is named after the county town of Roscommon. Roscommon comes from the Irish &quot;Ros&quot; meaning a wooded, gentle height and &quot;Comán&quot;, the first abbot and bishop of Roscommon who founded the first monastery there in 550 AD.

==Geography==
County Roscommon has an area of . Lough Key in north Roscommon is noted for having thirty-two islands. The geographical centre of Ireland is located on the western shore of Lough Ree in the south of the county.

Roscommon is the third largest of Connacht&#x27;s five counties by size and the second-smallest in terms of population. It ranks 11th in size of Ireland&#x27;s 32 counties, but 26th in terms of population, making it the 3rd most sparsely populated county after Leitrim and Mayo. The county borders every other Connacht county: Galway, Mayo, Sligo, and Leitrim, as well as three Leinster counties: Longford, Westmeath, and Offaly. In 2008, a news report said that statistically, people from Roscommon have the longest life expectancy of any county on the island of Ireland.

Seltannasaggart, which is located along the northern border with County Leitrim, is the tallest point in County Roscommon, measuring to a height of

==Baronies==
There are nine historical baronies in County Roscommon.

North Roscommon
*Boyle (north Roscommon including Boyle and Arigna).
*Frenchpark (north-west, including Ballaghaderreen and Frenchpark).
*Roscommon (mid-north-east, including Strokestown and Tulsk).
*Castlereagh (west, including Castlerea and Ballinlough).
*Ballintober North (east including Rooskey and Tarmonbarry).

South Roscommon
*&quot;Ballymoe&quot; shared with County Galway includes Ballymoe, Creggs and Glenamaddy.
*Ballintober South (south-mid-east, including Roscommon).
*Athlone (mid-south, including Knockcroghery and part of Athlone).
*Moycarn (far-south, including part of Ballinasloe).

==History==

Rathcroghan (), near Tulsk, a complex of archaeological sites, the home of Queen Medb (, anglicised Maeve), was the seat of Kings of Connacht and then to the High Kings of Ireland. This was the starting point of the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot;, or Cattle Raid of Cooley, an epic tale in Irish mythology. The county is home to prehistoric ringforts such as Carnagh West Ringfort and Drummin fort.

County Roscommon as an administrative division has its roots in the Middle Ages. With the conquest and division of the Kingdom of Connacht, those districts in the east retained by King John as &quot;The King&#x27;s Cantreds&quot; covered County Roscommon, and parts of East Galway. These districts were leased to the native kings of Connacht and eventually became the county. In 1585 during the Tudor re-establishment of counties under the Composition of Connacht, Roscommon was established with the South-west boundary now alongside the River Suck.

===Medieval art===
A &quot;well defined&quot; and &quot;original&quot; fine metal workshop was active in County Roscommon in the 12th century. The Cross of Cong, the Aghadoe crosier, Shrine of the Book of Dimma and Shrine of Manchan of Mohill&#x27; are grouped together as having been created by &quot;Mael Isu Bratain Ui Echach&quot; et al., at the same Roscommon workshop. The workshop has been linked to St. Assicus of Elphin.

===Ordnance Survey===

John O&#x27;Donovan (1806–1861), historian and scholar, visited County Roscommon in 1837, while compiling information for the Ordnance Survey. Entering St Peter&#x27;s parish in Athlone in June 1837, he wrote, &quot;I have now entered upon a region totally different from Longford, and am very much pleased with the intelligence of the people.&quot; However, he had major problems with place-names. He later wrote, &quot;I am sick to death&#x27;s door of lochawns, and it pains me to the very soul to have to make these remarks, but what can I do when I cannot make the usual progress? Here I am stuck in the mud in the middle of Loughs, Turlaghs, Lahaghs and Curraghs, the names of many of which are only known to a few old men in their immediate neighbourhood and I cannot give many of them utterance from the manner in which they are spelled.&quot;

==Government and politics==

Roscommon is governed locally by the 18-member Roscommon County Council, a body created under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898.

The 1898 Act also divided the county into the rural districts of Athlone No. 2, Ballinasloe No. 2, Boyle No. 1, Carrick-on-Shannon No. 2, Castlerea, Roscommon, and Strokestown. The rural districts were abolished in 1925. Boyle and Roscommon were administered locally by town commissioners. Roscommon town commissioners were abolished in 1927. After becoming a town council in 2002, in common with all other town councils in Ireland, Boyle Town Council was abolished under the Local Government Reform Act 2014.

For general elections, Roscommon is completely within the three-seat Dáil constituency of Roscommon–Galway. For European elections, the county is part of the Midlands–North-West constituency.

==Rail transport==
There are railway stations located in Boyle (Dublin–Sligo line), Carrick-on-Shannon (Dublin–Sligo line), Roscommon (Dublin–Westport line), Castlerea (Dublin-Westport line), Ballinasloe (Dublin-Galway line) and Athlone (Dublin–Galway and Dublin–Westport lines).

==Sport==
Gaelic football is the dominant sport in Roscommon. Roscommon won the All-Ireland Senior Football Championships in 1943 and 1944 and the National Football League Division 1 in 1979, as well as Division 2 in 2015 and 2018. Roscommon have captured the Connacht Senior Football Championship on 23 occasions, the most recent being in 2019.

<text>An aerobic organism or aerobe is an organism that can survive and grow in an oxygenated environment. The ability to exhibit aerobic respiration may yield benefits to the aerobic organism, as aerobic respiration yields more energy than anaerobic respiration. Energy production of the cell involves the synthesis of ATP by an enzyme called ATP synthase. In aerobic respiration, ATP synthase is coupled with an electron transport chain in which oxygen acts as a terminal electron acceptor. In July 2020, marine biologists reported that aerobic microorganisms (mainly), in &quot;quasi-suspended animation&quot;, were found in organically poor sediments, up to 101.5 million years old, 250 feet below the seafloor in the South Pacific Gyre (SPG) (&quot;the deadest spot in the ocean&quot;), and could be the longest-living life forms ever found.

==Types==
*Obligate aerobes need oxygen to grow. In a process known as cellular respiration, these organisms use oxygen to oxidize substrates (for example sugars and fats) and generate energy.
*Facultative anaerobes use oxygen if it is available, but also have anaerobic methods of energy production.
*Microaerophiles require oxygen for energy production, but are harmed by atmospheric concentrations of oxygen (21% O2).
*Aerotolerant anaerobes do not use oxygen but are not harmed by it.

When an organism is able to survive in both oxygen and anaerobic environments, the use of the Pasteur effect can distinguish between facultative anaerobes and aerotolerant organisms. If the organism is using fermentation in an anaerobic environment, the addition of oxygen will cause facultative anaerobes to suspend fermentation and begin using oxygen for respiration. Aerotolerant organisms must continue fermentation in the presence of oxygen.
Facultative organisms grow in both oxygen rich media and oxygen free media.

==Aerobic Respiration==
Aerobic organisms use a process called aerobic respiration to create ATP from ADP and a phosphate. Glucose (a monosaccharide) is oxidized to power the electron transport chain:

This equation is a summary of what happens in three series of biochemical reactions: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also known as the Citric acid cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation.

:C6H12O6 + 6 O2 + 38 ADP + 38 phosphate → 6 CO2 + 44 H2O + 38 ATP

In Oxidative phosphorylation, ATP is synthesized from ADP and a phosphate using ATP synthase. ATP synthase is powered by a proton-motive force created by using the energy generated from the electron transport chain. A hydrogen ion (H+) has a positive charge and if separated by a cellular membrane, it creates a difference in charge between the inside and outside of the membrane. Oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the mitochondria of eukaryotes. 

Aerobic respiration needs O2 because it acts as the terminal electron acceptor in prokaryotes&#x27; electron transport chain. Molecular Oxygen is reduced to water in this process.

<text>Roscommon (; ; ) is the county town and the largest town in County Roscommon in Ireland. It is roughly in the centre of Ireland, near the meeting of the N60, N61 and N63 roads. The town is in a civil parish of the same name.

The name Roscommon is derived from Commán mac Faelchon who built a monastery there in the 5th century. The woods near the monastery became known as Ros Comáin (&quot;St. Coman&#x27;s Wood&quot;). This was later anglicised to Roscommon. Its population at the 2022 census was 6,555.

==History==
Roscommon was the homeland of the Connachta dynasty, and included such kingdoms as Uí Maine, Delbhna Nuadat, Síol Muirdeach, and Moylurg. In addition, it contained areas known as Trícha cét&#x27;s, Túath and is the homeland of surnames such as Ó Conchobhair (O&#x27;Conor, O&#x27;Connor), Mac Diarmada (McDermott), Ó Ceallaigh (Kelly), Ó Birn (Beirne, Byrne, Burns), Ó Duibh (Duff, Duffy, and Dufficy), Mac Donnchadha (McDonough) and Brennan (Mac Branáin and Ó Branáin).

From 1118 to 1156 Roscommon was the seat of the Diocese of Elphin.

The town is the location of a notable archaeological find in 1945 when a gold lunula and two gold discs were discovered. Both items are dated to the period 2300 and 1800 BC.

==Architecture==
Roscommon Castle is located on a hillside just outside the town. Now in ruins, the castle is quadrangular in shape, it had four corner D-shaped towers, three storeys high, and twin towers at its entrance gateway, one of which still retains its immensely sturdy vaulted roof. The entire castle was enclosed by a lofty curtain wall. It was built in 1269 by Robert de Ufford, Justiciar of Ireland, on lands he had seized from the Augustinian Priory. The castle had a most chequered history. It was besieged by Connacht King Aodh Ó Conchobhair in 1272.

Eight years later it was again in the hands of an English garrison, and fully repaired. By 1340 the O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s regained possession of it, and, except for a few brief intermissions, they held it for two centuries until 1569, when Sir Henry Sidney, Lord Deputy seized it. It was granted to Sir Nicholas Malbie, Elizabethan Governor of Connaught, in 1578. Two years later the interior was remodelled and large mullioned windows were inserted in the towers and curtain walls. Again, in 1641 the Parliamentarian faction gained it until Confederate Catholics under Preston captured it in 1645.

It remained in Irish hands until 1652 when it was partially blown up by Cromwellian &quot;Ironsides&quot; under Commissary Reynolds, who had all the fortifications dismantled. It was finally burned down in 1690, and, from the closing years of the 17th-century, it gradually fell into decay. A symmetrical moat some distance from the curtain walls surrounded the entire castle and safeguarded it. It is now a national monument.

Harrison Hall is located prominently in the market square and is now occupied by the Bank of Ireland. Most of the ground floor is open to the public. Once a 17th-century sessions house. Following a partial collapse of the two-storey sessions house, it was rebuilt in 1762 by Ensor brothers and converted into a courthouse and market house. It is built in the classical architectural style with a cupola. It became a catholic church in 1863. After 1903 it became a recreational hall to commemorate John Harrison (who was a physician in Roscommon town&#x27;s workhouse, during the famine of the 1840s) it was used as a dance hall, cinema and theatre before it was sold to the Bank of Ireland in 1972.

The old gaol is located at the northern end of the square and faces the back of Harrison Hall. The original building was designed by Richard Cassells and completed in 1745. The gaol had the distinction of having a hang woman, &#x27;Lady Betty&#x27;, a criminal who had her sentence withdrawn on the provision that she perform the unpaid task of hang woman. A new gaol was built on the site of the current Garda station in 1814, and in 1822 the old gaol was taken over for use as a lunatic asylum. In 1833 it became a &#x27;Lazaretto&#x27; – a place where outcasts who suffered from smallpox were confined. Sometime after 1840 the building was converted to residential and commercial use. All but the facade of the building was demolished by a developer in the 1980s and a car park and structure containing retail, office, restaurant and residential units were constructed on the site in the late 1990s.

Roscommon County Museum and Tourism Office is located next to Harrison hall in the town square. It was originally a small Presbyterian church built in 1863, with the associated manse located next door. The building is of cut limestone with a large recessed door, circular headed windows and fenestration on the wheel window over the door is in the form of the &#x27;Star of David&#x27; to commemorate its Welsh Builders. The building was renovated in 1991 and now contains many exhibits and artefacts illustrating and interpreting the history of Roscommon. Among the artefacts on display is a 9th-century grave slab from St Comans Abbey and a Sheela na Gig from Rahara church.
St Coman&#x27;s Church is a Church of Ireland church constructed in 1775.

Roscommon Abbey is on the outskirts of the core of the town, and is reachable by a path at the back of the Abbey Hotel running alongside the Abbey boys&#x27; school. It was founded just over 750 years ago by King Felim O&#x27;Connor (Irish: Fedlimid Ó Conchobair) of Connacht, who was buried there himself in 1265. The effigy in a niche on the north side of the chancel is either that of himself (but carved 35 years or more after his death), or of one of his successors; dating from around 1300, it shows a king dressed in a long robe and mantle of a kind that suggests he may have been aping an English regal costume of the period, an idea supported by the fact that he carries a sceptre with fleur-de-lis head in his right hand. The tomb front supporting his effigy slab (but not originally belonging to it) bears eight niches containing fifteenth-century carved figures of gallowglasses, mercenaries of Scottish origin who played a major role in Irish wars of the Later Middle Ages. These have their bodies protected by a coat of mail and each wears a helmet known as a bascinet. All are armed with a sword, except one who bears an axe-like sparth, a typical gallowglass weapon.

Usually called the &#x27;Abbey&#x27;, it is more accurately described as a friary, it was created for Dominican friars. During the course of its existence, it experienced many misfortunate events, starting with a fire in 1270, a lightning strike in 1308, and having Lord Audley take large sums of money deposited in it by the poor people of the town for the use of his army against a king of Connacht. But the main part of the church must have survived these misfortunes, for much of its existing fabric dates from the thirteenth century, as seen in the style of the lancet windows in the north and south walls. The east wall of the church probably had five such windows grouped and graded together, but they were replaced in the fifteenth century by one single large traceried window which probably shed more light inside during the morning. At the same period, a chapel — also with a large window — was added to the north, at right angles to an aisle which is separated from the nave by an arcade supported by round columns which still partially survive. Suppressed at the Reformation, the ruined buildings were denuded of their majestic tower, and probably also of the cloister to the south, when they served as a handy stone-quarry for their owner.

Roscommon Courthouse is located on Abbey Street. It was built in 1832 adjacent to the new gaol (now the site of Roscommon garda station) to replace the previous courthouse, which is now known as Harrison Hall and which currently houses a branch of the Bank of Ireland. The courthouse was severely damaged by fire in 1882 and was restored later in the 1880s. The courthouse is the venue for sittings of Roscommon District and Circuit Courts (although they are currently sitting at a temporary alternative venue pending the refurbishment of the courthouse, which is in a dilapidated condition). The floor of the entrance hall features a mosaic of the Roscommon crest and over the main staircase hangs a large portrait of Douglas Hyde, the first president of Ireland.

Roscommon County Library is situated in Abbeytown opposite the CBS secondary school. It was built in 1783 as a hospital (then known as an infirmary). It is a 3-storey over basement limestone structure. Two symmetrical wings flank the north and south end of a central portion. The right hand wing was traditionally used as the surgeons house. It was used as a hospital until 1941. Major reconstruction work was undertaken in 1989 and the building was refitted as the County Library.

Roscommon Barracks is located at the south end of the town, close to the railway station. It was designed as a military barracks by Pierce Archbold. It is the only William and Mary style building in the town, having commenced building in 1702 and having entered operation by 1704. In the late 19th century, it was converted for use as a police barracks by the RIC. It became vacant when the police barracks was moved to the site of the disused gaol beside the courthouse on Abbey Street, and in 1907 it was purchased for use as a residence by William and Mary Jane Black. William Black was an auctioneer and was appointed as magistrate for County Roscommon in 1917. During the 20th century, the building became vacant again, and was purchased by Roscommon County Council. It is now in a dilapidated condition.

Sacred Heart Catholic Church dominates the skyline of the town. The church spire is 52 m high. Built of local cut stone and opened in 1903, it was completed in 1925. The church is built on rising ground and fronted by a sunken grotto. Over the main door is a fine example of mosaic, carried out by the Italian firm of Salviate, depicting two bishops of the diocese of Elphin connected with the building of the church. The interior is equally impressive and contained a replica of the Cross of Cong, the original of which was made in Fuerty between 1120 and 1123. This replica was stolen from the church in May 2016, and remains missing to this day.
Sacred Heart Home, a former workhouse, is situated on the outskirts of the town approximately 500m from the town on the golf links/ Curraghboy road. Outside this building is an Irish Famine Memorial. It was constructed on behalf of the people of Roscommon in 1999, as a permanent memorial to the thousands of Roscommon people who perished in the Famine. It is built next to the master&#x27;s residence of the Workhouse. The workhouse building was constructed in 1840, in response to a sudden increase in extreme poverty and famine in the Roscommon town area. Roscommon was severely affected during the great famine, with one of the highest death rates per population recorded in the whole of Ireland, during this period the population of Roscommon suffered a 31.5% drop. The workhouse was designed for 700 paupers but housed up to 1,600 people during the famine years.

Hundreds flocked to the workhouse for sustenance and refuge. However, the workhouse could not cope with the numbers requiring assistance. This situation was reflected in a notice which was posted outside Roscommon Workhouse in January 1847, which stated that no new applicants seeking assistance could be admitted. Many who died there were buried in Bully&#x27;s Acre, a short distance away.

LC 1265.6: Fedhlim, son of Cathal Crobhderg Ó Conchobhair, king of Connacht—the protector and supporter of his own province, and the protector of his friends on every side; the plunderer and extirpator of his enemies wherever they might be; a man full of bounty and prowess; a man full of distinction and honor in Erinn and Saxon-land—died after the triumph of unction and penitence, and was interred in the monastery of the Friars Preachers in Ros-Comain, which he had previously granted to God and the Order.

LC 1564.2: Ros-Comain was taken by the sons of Tadhg Og, son of Tadhg, son of Toirdhelbhach Ó Conchobhair, from Ó Conchobhair Donn; and they gave the town, after taking it, to Ó Conchobhair Ruadh, i.e. Tadhg Og, son of Tadhg Buidhe; and much was destroyed throughout all Connacht on account of this capture. Brian, son of Ruaidhri Mac Diarmada, and the sons of Tomaltach Mac Diarmada, with many men, went into ambush around Ros-Comain. Conchobhar, the son of Ó Conchobhair Ruadh, went out from the court that day, and the ambuscaders attacked himself and his people on all sides; and they were driven to the monastery and their horses were taken from them before the door; and they themselves went into the belfry. But this place was no defence to them. All followed them, and God decreed the termination of their lives; for, though strong the place in which they were; their heads were taken off them all. Conchobhar, son of Toirdhelbhach Ruadh Ó Conchobhair, was killed there, and ten and eleven of his people along with him; and horses were taken from them. On the Saturday of Patrick&#x27;s Sunday these deeds were committed.

<text>Galway ( ; , ) is a city in (and the county town of) County Galway. It lies on the River Corrib between Lough Corrib and Galway Bay. It is the most populous settlement in the province of Connacht, the fifth most populous city on the island of Ireland and the fourth most populous in the Republic of Ireland, with a population at the 2022 census of 85,910.

Located near an earlier settlement, Galway grew around a fortification built by the King of Connacht in 1124. A municipal charter in 1484 allowed citizens of the by then walled city to form a council and mayoralty. Controlled largely by a group of merchant families, the Tribes of Galway, the city grew into a trading port. Following a period of decline, as of the 21st century, Galway is a tourist destination known for festivals and events including the Galway International Arts Festival.

In 2018, Galway was named the European Region of Gastronomy. The city was the European Capital of Culture for 2020, alongside Rijeka, Croatia.

==Name==
The city&#x27;s name comes from the Irish name &quot;Gaillimh&quot;, which formed the western boundary of the earliest settlement, &quot;Dún Gaillimhe&quot; &quot;Fort Gaillimh&quot;. (Mythical and alternative derivations of the name are given in History of Galway). Historically, the name was anglicised as &quot;Galliv&quot; or &quot;Gallive&quot;, closer to the Irish pronunciation. The city&#x27;s name in Latin is &quot;Galvia&quot;. Residents of the city are referred to as Galwegians.

The city also bears the nickname &quot;City of the Tribes&quot; () because of the fourteen merchant families called the &quot;tribes of Galway&quot; who led the city in its Hiberno-Norman period.

==History==
Built on the site of an earlier settlement, Dún Gaillimhe (&quot;Fort at the Mouth (bottom) of the Gaillimh&quot;) was completed in 1124, by the King of Connacht and High King of Ireland Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088–1156). The castle served as a naval base from which his fleet operated. A new settlement grew around it. During the Norman invasion of Connacht in the 1230s, Dún Gaillimhe was captured by Richard Mor de Burgh, who had led the invasion. As the de Burghs eventually became Gaelicised, the merchants of the town, the Tribes of Galway, pushed for greater control over the walled city.
This led to their gaining complete control over the city and to the granting of mayoral status by the English crown in December 1484. Galway endured difficult relations with its Irish neighbours. A notice over the west gate of the city, completed in 1562 by Mayor Thomas Óge Martyn, stated &quot;From the Ferocious O&#x27;Flahertys may God protect us&quot;. A by-law forbade the native Irish (as opposed to Galway&#x27;s Hiberno-Norman citizens) unrestricted access into Galway, saying &quot;neither O&#x27; nor Mac shall strutte nor swagger through the streets of Galway&quot; without permission.

During the Middle Ages, Galway was ruled by an oligarchy of fourteen merchant families (twelve who claimed to be of Norman origin and two of Irish origin). These were the &quot;Tribes of Galway&quot;. The city thrived on international trade, and in the Middle Ages, it was the principal Irish port for trade with Spain and France. The most famous reminder of those days is &quot;ceann an bhalla&quot; (&quot;the end of the wall&quot;), now known as the Spanish Arch, constructed during the mayoralty of Wylliam Martin (1519–20). In 1477 Christopher Columbus visited Galway, possibly stopping off on a voyage to Iceland or the Faroe Islands. Seven or eight years later, he noted in the margin of his copy of &quot;Imago Mundi&quot;:
Men of Cathay have come from the west. [Of this] we have seen many signs. And especially in Galway in Ireland, a man and a woman, of extraordinary appearance, have come to land on two tree trunks [or timbers? or a boat made of such?]
The most likely explanation for these bodies is that they were Inuit swept eastward by the North Atlantic Current.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, Galway remained loyal to the English crown for the most part, even during the Gaelic resurgence, perhaps for reasons of survival. However, by 1642 the city had allied itself with the Catholic Confederation of Kilkenny during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. During the resulting Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Cromwellian forces captured the city after a nine-month siege. At the end of the 17th century, the city supported the Jacobites in the Williamite war in Ireland and was captured by the Williamites after a very short siege not long after the Battle of Aughrim in 1691. The great families of Galway were ruined. The city later suffered further under the Great Famine of 1845–1852.

==Geography==
===Climate===

Like most of Ireland, Galway has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification, being one of the world&#x27;s mildest cities for latitude, partly because it is on an island. Galway has a year-round mild, moist, temperate and changeable climate, due to the prevailing winds of the North Atlantic Current together with the Gulf Stream, whilst on the other side of the Atlantic temperatures can be 20 °C cooler or more. The city does not experience temperature extremes, with temperatures below and above being rare. The city receives an average of of precipitation annually, which is evenly distributed throughout the year. The average January temperature in the city is and the average July temperature is . The highest temperature ever recorded in Galway was in July 1921, whilst the lowest temperature recorded was in January 1945.

While extreme weather is rare, the city and county can experience severe windstorms that are the result of vigorous Atlantic depressions that occasionally pass along the north west coast of Ireland. Most of these storms occur between late autumn and early spring. Due to the city&#x27;s northerly location, Galway has long summer days. Sunrise on summer solstice occurs at 05:07 WEST and sunset at 22:07. By contrast, on winter solstice, the sun rises at 08:49 WET, and sets at 16:19.

===Places of interest===


* Lynch&#x27;s Castle on Shop Street is a medieval townhouse built by the prosperous Lynch family in the 16th century and is now a branch of Allied Irish Banks.
* St. Nicholas&#x27; Collegiate Church is the largest medieval church still in everyday use in Ireland. This Church of Ireland church was founded in 1320 and enlarged in the following two centuries. 
* Galway Cathedral, known as the Cathedral of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas, was consecrated in 1965 and is constructed from limestone. It has an eclectic style, with a Renaissance Revival dome, pillars and round arches, and a Romanesque Revival portico that dominates the main façade – which is an unusual feature in a modern Irish church building.
* The original quadrangle building of the University of Galway which was erected in 1849 (during the Great Famine or &quot;An Gorta Mór&quot;) as one of the three colleges of the Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland (along with Queen&#x27;s University Belfast and University College Cork). The university holds the UNESCO archive of spoken material for the Celtic languages.
* The Hardiman, originally the Railway Hotel, was built by the Great Southern Railway Company in 1845. Also known over the years as the Great Southern Hotel and then Hotel Meyrick, it sits at the southern perimeter of Eyre Square and is the city&#x27;s oldest hotel still in operation.
* The remains of Menlo Castle can be seen outside the city, on the eastern bank of the River Corrib. It was one of the ancestral homes of the Blake family, one of the Tribes of Galway from –1910. The façade of the family&#x27;s townhouse (&quot;Blake&#x27;s Castle&quot;) is still extant next to the Jury&#x27;s Hotel at the bottom of Quay Street.
* Eglinton Canal, named after Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton, a former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, joins the River Corrib to the sea, and flows for just more than a kilometre from the university to the Claddagh.
* The Claddagh is the oldest part of Galway but little or nothing remains of its old thatched village. However, on a side altar of the parish church, St Mary&#x27;s on the Hill, is the late medieval statue of Our Lady of Galway. The ancient ritual of the Blessing of the Bay takes place on the Sunday nearest to the feast of the Assumption.
* &quot;The Browne doorway&quot;, originally located on Lower Abbeygate Street but now standing at the north end of Eyre Square, was the doorway to the townhouse of the Browne family, one of the fourteen Tribes of Galway.
* &quot;The Lynch Window&quot;, on Market Street, at which is a plaque commemorating one of the city&#x27;s legends. According to legend, in 1493, the then-mayor, James Lynch FitzStephen, hanged his own son for the murder of a young Spanish visitor who had the misfortune to befriend the girlfriend of the mayor&#x27;s son.
* The Hall of the Red Earl (&quot;Halla an Iarla Rua&quot;) can be viewed through a protective glass wall off Flood Street. It is the earliest medieval settlement fragment surviving within the walls of the city. It was built by the de Burgo family in the 13th century and was a key municipal building for the collection of taxes, dispensation of justice and hosting banquets. It was the medieval equivalent of tax office, court house and town hall.

====The Claddagh====
On the west bank of the River Corrib as it enters the sea is the ancient neighbourhood of The Claddagh. For centuries it was an Irish-speaking enclave outside the city walls. Claddagh residents were mainly fisher folk and were governed by an elected &#x27;King&#x27;. The King of the Claddagh settled or arbitrated disputes among the locals and had the privilege of a white sail on his fishing boat. While the last holder of the title died in 1972, it is still used in a purely honorary and ceremonial context. The area is also known for its association with the Claddagh Ring.

====Museums====

The Galway City Museum has two main sections: one about the heritage of Galway and one about Irish artists from the second half of the 20th century. This museum also houses the statue of the poet, Pádraic Ó Conaire which was originally located in the Kennedy Park section of Eyre Square, prior to the Square&#x27;s renovation. A replica of the statue was erected in Eyre Square in 2017. The museum is near the Spanish Arch, the historical remnants of the 16th century wall.

The city&#x27;s university, the University of Galway, has several museums, including the James Mitchell Geology Museum and the Computing and Communications Museum of Ireland.

The Nora Barnacle House Museum in Bowling Green is the smallest museum in Ireland. Nora was the lover, companion and, later, wife of writer James Joyce.

====Cemeteries====
Fort Hill Cemetery, on Lough Atalia Road, is the oldest cemetery still in use in Galway City. On the northern wall is a memorial to more than 300 sailors of the Spanish Armada who were executed &quot;en masse&quot; and buried here in the 1580s.

Rahoon Cemetery (officially known as Mount St. Joseph Cemetery), Rahoon Road, on the western edge of the city affords views of the city. It is one of two cemeteries operated by Galway City Council. Among the people buried here are Michael Bodkin (an admirer of Nora Barnacle who was the inspiration for James Joyce&#x27;s character Michael Furey in &quot;The Dead&quot;), Michael Feeney (the &quot;lover&quot; in Joyce&#x27;s poem &quot;She Weeps Over Rahoon&quot;), and actress Siobhán McKenna.

Bohermore Cemetery (or the New Cemetery, as it also known), Cemetery Cross, Bohermore, is the second cemetery operated by Galway City Council. It contains two mortuary chapels and is the burial place of several important Galwegians, including writer Pádraic Ó Conaire, propagandist William Joyce, dramatist Lady Gregory and sports official Michael Morris, 3rd Baron Killanin. The cemetery also contains a gravesite and memorial to those who died in the KLM Flight 607-E crash, off the coast of Galway, on 14 August 1958.

There are several smaller cemeteries within the city boundaries. Some are no longer in use or are used primarily by families with ancient burial rights. These are St James&#x27;s Cemetery (Teampall) in Glenina Heights, Menlo Cemetery near Menlo Castle, Ballybrit Graveyard near the entrance to Galway Racecourse, and a very ancient early Christian graveyard at Roscam near Merlin Park. Several city churches have graveyards attached which were formerly used for the interment of clergy and parishioners – Castlegar Church, Claddagh Church&#x27;, St Patrick&#x27;s Church on Forster Street and St. Nicholas&#x27; Collegiate Church. Several bishops are buried in the crypt below the RC Cathedral but this not usually open to the public.

==Demographics==
The 2022 census indicated that Galway city had a population of 85,910, an increase of over 10,000 from the 2011 census figures.

As of 2009, approximately 80% of the population of Galway were Irish. Following an influx of immigrants to Galway during the 2000s, approximately 20% of the population is non-Irish. Slightly more than half of this group (11.3%) are non-Irish Europeans, coming from Poland and other Central European and Baltic States, such as Latvia and Lithuania. Smaller numbers of Asian and African immigrants come from East Africa, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka. In the 2006 census, 15.4% of the population were aged 0–14, 76.1% were aged 15–64, and 8.5% were aged over 65. 51.9% of the population were female and 48.1% were male.

==Politics==
===Local government===

With a population of 79,934, Galway is the fourth most populous urban area in the State and the 23rd most populous area of local government. Services such as waste collection, recycling, traffic control, parks and housing are controlled by an eighteen-member city council elected to five-year terms by proportional representation through means of the single transferable vote. The City Council is chaired by a mayor who is elected to a one-year term by fellow councillors. The role of mayor is mainly ceremonial, although they do have the casting vote. The first mayor was Peirce Lynch Fitzjohn, elected in 1485. The current mayor, Cllr. Clodagh Higgins, was elected in June 2022.

In 1937, the Urban District of Galway became the Borough of Galway, remaining party of County Galway. In 1986, the Borough of Galway became the County Borough of Galway and ceased to part of County Galway. In 2001, it was renamed Galway City.

The symbols of the office of the Mayor and the emblems of the dignity of the City Council are the Civic Sword (1620s) and the Great Mace (1710) which are carried in procession before the Mayor and Council on solemn civic occasions. When not in ceremonial use they can be seen at the Galway City Museum. In 1579, Elizabeth I confirmed the city&#x27;s charter and appointed the Mayor as &#x27;Admiral of the Bay and of the Aran islands&#x27;. The title, though extant, is rarely used except for ceremonial purposes.

The highest honour the city can bestow is the Freedom of the city. Among the names on the Roll of Honour are: Douglas Hyde, President of Ireland, 1939; Éamon de Valera, Taoiseach, 1946; Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly, President of Ireland, 1950; Robert F. Wagner, Mayor of New York, 1961; John F. Kennedy, President of the US, 1963; Pope John Paul II, 1979; Ronald Reagan, President of the US, 1984; Hillary Clinton, 1999; Richard M. Daley, Mayor of Chicago, 2003; Nelson Mandela, 2003; Aung San Suu Kyi, Burmese activist/leader, 2005; Garry Hynes, Druid Theatre Founder, 2006; and Michael D. Higgins, President of Ireland, 2012.

It is responsible for hearing small civil claims, and certain family law cases, administers the liquor licensing laws and is responsible for indicting the accused and sending them forward for trial at the Circuit Court and the Central Criminal Court.

The Circuit Court in Galway tries all indictable offences (those cases triable by a judge and jury), except murder, rape, treason, piracy and genocide, which are reserved to the Central Criminal Court. It can also hear appeals from the District Court. Its decisions can be appealed to the Court of Appeal. Civilly, the court is limited to compensation claims of not more than €75,000. Both parties may waive this amount and grant the court unlimited jurisdiction. Divorce, Judicial Separation and probate cases can be heard provided they are within the financial parameters of the court&#x27;s jurisdiction. Decisions in civil cases can be appealed to the High Court.

The High Court sits four times a year in Galway to hear original actions (actions that are not appeals from lower courts). It also sits twice a year in Galway to hear appeals from the Circuit Court in civil and family law cases. Its decisions can be appealed to the Court of Appeal, or in some instances, to the Supreme Court, which sits in Dublin.

Galway City has a reputation among Irish cities for being associated with the Irish language, music, song and dancing traditions. It is sometimes referred to as the &#x27;Bilingual Capital of Ireland&#x27;, although like elsewhere in Ireland, inhabitants converse mostly in English. The city is well known for its &quot;Irishness&quot;, mainly because it has on its doorstep the Galway Gaeltacht. Irish theatre, television and radio production and Irish music form a component of Galway city life, with both An Taibhdhearc, the National Irish Language Theatre, in Galway city itself, while TG4 and RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta headquarters are in the Connemara Gaeltacht elsewhere in County Galway.

===Religion===
The patron saint of the city since the 14th century has been St Nicholas of Myra. The Roman Catholic diocese of Galway was created in 1831 following the abolition by the Holy See of the Wardenship of Galway. It was united with the diocese of Kilmacduagh (est. 1152) and given the administratorship of the diocese of Kilfenora (est. 1152) in 1883. Its full name is the Diocese of Galway, Kilmacduagh and Apostolic Administratorship of Kilfenora (in Irish – Deoise na Gaillimhe, Chill Mac Duach agus Riarachán Aspalda Cill Fhionnúrach, in Latin – Diocesis Galviensis, Duacensis ac Administratio Apostolica Finaborensis). The diocese is under the patronage of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas (Galway), Saint Fachanan (Kilmacduagh) and St Colman (Kilfenora). As the diocese of Kilfenora is in the Ecclesiastical Metropolitan Province of Cashel the Bishop of Galway is its Apostolic Administrator rather than its bishop. The dioceses of Galway and Kilmacduagh are in the Ecclesiastical Metropolitan Province of Tuam. The current bishop is Most Rev. Martin Drennan, installed 3 July 2005. Of the 38 parishes in the RC diocese, 14 are situated in the city and are divided into two deaneries – the deanery of Galway City West and that of Galway City East. In each deanery, a Vicar Forane exercises limited jurisdiction on behalf of the bishop.

In the Church of Ireland, Galway is a parish of the United Diocese of Tuam, Killala and Achonry. The principal church of the parish is the St. Nicholas&#x27; Collegiate Church (founded 1320). Russian, Romanian, Coptic, and Mar Thoma Syrian Orthodox Churches use the facilities of St Nicholas Collegiate Church for their services. The Ahmadiyya-run Galway Mosque, opened in 2014, is the only purpose-built mosque in Galway.

===Sport===

Galway has a diverse sporting heritage, with a history in sports ranging from horse racing, Gaelic games, association football and rugby to rowing, basketball, motorsport, greyhound racing and others. The Galway Races are known worldwide and are the highlight of the Irish horse racing calendar. Over the years it has grown into an annual festival lasting seven days.

====Gaelic games====
Both hurling and football are strong in Galway city. Pearse Stadium in Salthill is the home to Galway GAA, the county&#x27;s Gaelic games body. The Galway hurlers compete annually in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship for the Liam MacCarthy Cup. Despite having won the cup only five times in their history, Galway is considered one of the top teams in the Championship. Galway reached the 2012 All-Ireland final only to draw with Kilkenny to force a replay, the first since 1959, which they eventually lost. In 2017 Galway lifted the Liam MacCarthy Cup for the first time in 29 years beating Waterford by 0–26 to 2–17. The footballers compete annually in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship for the Sam Maguire Cup. The Gaelic footballers have won the cup nine times with the most recent being in 2001.

==Economy and infrastructure==

Galway City is the capital of Connacht. Galway has a strong local economy with complementary business sectors, including manufacturing industry, tourism, retail and distribution, education, healthcare and services that include financial, construction, cultural, and professional. 

Most (47%) of the people employed in Galway work in either the commerce or professional sector, with a large number (17%) also employed in manufacturing. Most industry and manufacturing in Galway, like the rest of Ireland, is hi-tech (e.g. ICT, medical equipment, electronics, chemicals, etc.), due to the Celtic Tiger economic boom. Companies such as Boston Scientific, Medtronic, EA Games, Cisco and SAP AG have their regional offices or other offices in Galway City and environs. Tourism is also of major importance to the city, which had over 2.1 million visitors in 2000, and produced revenue of over €400 million.

The head office of Smyths, a toy shop company, is in Galway.
===Media===
====Radio====
There are two radio stations based in the city – Galway Bay FM (&quot;95.8 FM&quot;) broadcasts from the city to the whole county; Flirt FM (&quot;101.3 FM&quot;) is the student radio station for the University of Galway.

====Print====
One of the main regional newspapers for the county is The &quot;Connacht Tribune&quot; which prints two titles every week, the &quot;Connacht Tribune&quot; on Thursday, and the &quot;Galway City Tribune&quot; on Friday. As of January 2007, The Tribune has a weekly readership of over 150,000. Another Galway-based newspaper is the &quot;Galway Advertiser&quot;, a free paper printed every Thursday with an average of 160 pages and a circulation of 70,000 copies. It is the main paper of the &quot;Advertiser Newspaper Group&quot; which distributes 200,000 newspapers per and more week to a variety of other Irish cities and towns.

===Transport===
====Air====
Galway Airport, located east of the city at Carnmore, ceased to have scheduled passenger flights on 31 October 2011. Because the runway is too short to take modern passenger jet aircraft, it is only capable of limited operations. &quot;Aerfort na Minna&quot; ( west of the city) operates regular flights to each of the Aran Islands &quot;(Oileáin Árann)&quot;. Shannon Airport (90 km) and Ireland West Airport (86 km) are the nearest international airports, both of which have flights around Ireland and to Britain, Continental Europe and North America (from Shannon).

====Bus====
Buses are the main form of public transport in the city and county. Routes operated by Bus Éireann include routes 401 (Salthill/Parkmore), 402 (Seacrest/Merlin Park), 404 (Newcastle/Oranmore), 405 (Rahoon/Ballybane), 407 (Bóthar an Chóiste) and 409 (Parkmore Industrial). Routes operated by City Direct include routes 410 (Salthill), 411 (Knocknacarra – Cappagh Rd), 412 (Knocknacarra Express), and 414 (Barna).

Various bus companies also provide links throughout County Galway and nationwide. These operate from a number of locations:
* The main bus and rail station in the city is Ceannt Station.
* Galway Coach Station, located at Fairgreen, is also a coach transport hub. Scheduled direct and commuter services operate between the Coach Station, Dublin and Dublin Airport, as well as services to Limerick, Cork and Clifden. These are operated by Aircoach, Citylink and Gobus.
* Other regional bus operators use various bus stops around the city centre, and many serve the NUIG and GMIT campuses as well.

====Rail====
Galway&#x27;s main railway station is Ceannt Station (&quot;Stáisiún Cheannt&quot;), which opened in August 1851, and was renamed in honour of Éamonn Ceannt in April 1966.

The Midland Great Western Railway reached Galway in 1851, giving the city a direct main line to its Broadstone Station terminus in Dublin. As the 19th century progressed the rail network in Connacht was expanded, making Galway an important railhead. The nearby town of Athenry became a railway junction, giving Galway links to Ennis, Limerick and the south in 1869 and Sligo and the north in 1894. In 1895 the MGW opened a branch line between Galway and Clifden.

The 20th century brought increasing road competition, and this led the Great Southern Railways to close the Clifden branch in 1935. In the 1970s the state railway authority Córas Iompair Éireann closed the Sligo-Athenry-Ennis line to passenger services. It later closed to freight as well.

Iarnród Éireann, Ireland&#x27;s national rail operator, currently runs six return passenger services each day between Galway and Dublin Heuston, also serving intermediate stations. Travel time is just under 3 hours. Services on the Galway–Limerick line have now resumed, with around 5–6 trains each way per day.

From Galway railway services along the Western Rail Corridor link the city with Ennis, and Limerick where trains run to Cork via Limerick Junction (for Tipperary, Clonmel and Waterford) and Mallow (for Killarney and Tralee).

====Road====
Four national primary roads serve the city: the M6 motorway running east–west (Athlone, Dublin), the M17 motorway running north from the M6 to Tuam, the N63, formerly the N17, connecting Galway with the Northwest (Tuam, Sligo, Donegal Town, Letterkenny and Derry), and the M18 motorway linking Galway to southern towns and cities Gort, Ennis, Shannon Town, Limerick and Cork joining up with The Wild Atlantic Way. In addition, there are plans for a semi-ring road of the city, the Galway City Outer Bypass. There is also an &quot;Inner City Ring&quot; (&quot;Cuar Inmheánach&quot;) route that encircles the city centre, most of which is pedestrianised.

Galway is considered the gateway to Connemara and the Gaeltacht, including Mám, An Teach Dóite, Cor na Móna, Ros Muc, Bearna and An Cheathrú Rua. The N59 along the western shore of Lough Corrib and the R337 along the northern shore of Galway Bay both lead to this largely rural and highly scenic region.

====Waterways====
The River Corrib is by far the most important waterway in Galway and a number of canals and channels were built above and through the city. The purposes of these to divert and control the water from the river, to harness its power and to provide a navigable route to the sea. Of these, there were two major schemes – one between 1848 and 1858 and the other during the 1950s. The canals provided a power source for Galway and were the location of the first industries in the mid-19th century. The Eglinton Canal provided a navigation from the sea (at the Claddagh Basin) to the navigable part of the river (above the Salmon Weir Bridge). Most of the mills are still used today for various purposes; for instance, the University of Galway still uses a water turbine for electricity generation for their building on Nun&#x27;s Island.

Currently, there are four bridges across the Corrib. Following the southward flow of the river these are, from the north: the Quincentennial Bridge, the Salmon Weir Bridge, the William O&#x27;Brien Bridge and the Wolfe Tone Bridge. There are plans for a fifth bridge as part of the Galway City Outer Bypass project. The Clare River flows from the North of the County Galway, through Tuam, Claregalway into Lough Corrib.

====Harbour====

Galway is the most central port on the West Coast of Ireland in the sheltered eastern corner of Galway Bay. The harbour can be used by vessels up to and the inner dock can accommodate up to 9 vessels at any one time.

Regular passenger ferry and freight services operate between Galway and the tourist destination of the Aran Islands which is home to World Heritage Site Dún Aonghasa. The islands also have regular links with the towns of Rossaveal and Doolin, which are physically closer but far smaller.

Commuter ferry services have been proposed to the tourism town of Kinvara, on the opposite side of Galway Bay.

Major work in the harbour area was carried out in 2009 to accommodate the stopover of the Volvo Ocean Race. This was one of the biggest events ever to visit Galway. The event returned with the finale of the race in June 2012.

====Walking====
The city is planned as the start of the E2 European long-distance path, running for to Nice, though (as of 2012) the Irish section was incomplete.

== Industry ==
Galway Textile Printers, located on Sandy Road, was the first major industry to come to Galway and quickly became one of the biggest employers in the west of Ireland. Some of those who worked there were specialists who were brought in to help set the factory up, but most employees were local. The Mills eventually went out of business in the early 1980s and its former site now hosts various small business establishments. Celtrak is an IT and Electronic Engineering company, founded in 2000.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary education===

As of 2002, there were 27 primary schools and 11 secondary schools in Galway.

===Third level===
There are two university campuses located in the city, University of Galway and the Atlantic Technological University.

The University of Galway was founded in 1845 as Queen&#x27;s College, Galway, before becoming known as University College, Galway (U.C.G.) and then as the National University of Ireland, Galway. It was renamed &quot;Ollscoil na Gaillimhe – University of Galway&quot; in September 2022. The university is divided into several colleges, including the College of Arts, Social Science and Celtic Studies, the College of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, the College of Business, Public Policy and Law, the College of Science and the College of Engineering and Informatics. The university had an enrollment of 16,000 in 2010. The Biomedical Research Building was opened in 2014. It houses the Regenerative Medicine Institute (REMEDI). Also opened in 2014 were the Hardiman Building and a School of Psychology. The National Institute for Prevention and Cardiovascular Health (NIPC) is an affiliate of the University of Galway.
The Atlantic Technological University (also known as ATU or Atlantic TU; ) was established in 2022 through the merger of Galway Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT), Sligo Institute of Technology and Letterkenny Institute of Technology. Its administrative headquarters are in Galway. It also has campuses in Castlebar, Letterfrack, Mountbellew, Sligo and Letterkenny. Its Galway campus is based on the Dublin Road in Galway city, overlooking Galway Bay. Four schools of study are located there: the School of Business, the School of Engineering, the School of Science &amp; Computing, and the College of Tourism &amp; Arts.

The Central Applications Office (CAO), the organisation which oversees applications to colleges and universities in Ireland, is also headquartered in the city. A related organisation, the Postgraduate Applications Centre, processes some taught postgraduate courses.

==Health==

Publicly funded health care and social services are provided in Galway by the HSE (West) division of the Health Services Executive.
The main city hospital, Galway University Hospitals, is located on two campuses — University Hospital Galway and Merlin Park University Hospital.

Two private hospitals – The Galway Clinic and the Bon Secours Hospital, Galway – also operate in the city.
Galway Hospice provides palliative care for the people of Galway City and County on a homecare, inpatient and daycare basis.

<text>An anaerobic organism or anaerobe is any organism that does not require molecular oxygen for growth. It may react negatively or even die if free oxygen is present. In contrast, an aerobic organism (aerobe) is an organism that requires an oxygenated environment. Anaerobes may be unicellular (e.g. protozoans, bacteria) or multicellular.
Most fungi are obligate aerobes, requiring oxygen to survive. However, some species, such as the Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle, are obligate anaerobes; for these species, anaerobic respiration is used because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them. The sea floor is possibly one of the largest accumulation of anaerobic organisms on Earth, where microbes are primarily concentrated around hydrothermal vents. These microbes produce energy in absence of sunlight or oxygen through a process called chemosynthesis, whereby inorganic compounds such as hydrogen gas, hydrogen sulfide or ferrous ions are converted into organic matter.

==First recorded observation==
In his 14 June 1680 letter to The Royal Society, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek described an experiment he carried out by filling two identical glass tubes about halfway with crushed pepper powder, to which some clean rain water was added. Van Leeuwenhoek sealed one of the glass tubes using a flame and left the other glass tube open. Several days later, he discovered in the open glass tube &#x27;a great many very little animalcules, of divers sort having its own particular motion.&#x27; Not expecting to see any life in the sealed glass tube, Van Leeuwenhoek saw to his surprise &#x27;a kind of living animalcules that were round and bigger than the biggest sort that I have said were in the other water.&#x27; The conditions in the sealed tube had become quite anaerobic due to consumption of oxygen by aerobic microorganisms.

In 1913, Martinus Beijerinck repeated Van Leeuwenhoek&#x27;s experiment and identified &quot;Clostridium butyricum&quot; as a prominent anaerobic bacterium in the sealed pepper infusion tube liquid. Beijerinck commented:

==Classifications==
For practical purposes, there are three categories of anaerobe:
* Obligate anaerobes, which are harmed by the presence of oxygen. Two examples of obligate anaerobes are &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot; and the bacteria which live near hydrothermal vents on the deep-sea ocean floor.
* Aerotolerant organisms, which cannot use oxygen for growth, but tolerate its presence.
* Facultative anaerobes, which can grow without oxygen but use oxygen if it is present.

However, this classification has been questioned after recent research showed that human &quot;obligate anaerobes&quot; (such as &quot;Finegoldia magna&quot; or the methanogenic archaea &quot;Methanobrevibacter smithii&quot;) can be grown in aerobic atmosphere if the culture medium is supplemented with antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, glutathione and uric acid.

==Energy metabolism==
Some obligate anaerobes use fermentation, while others use anaerobic respiration. Aerotolerant organisms are strictly fermentative. In the presence of oxygen, facultative anaerobes use aerobic respiration. In the absence of oxygen, some facultative anaerobes use fermentation, while others may use anaerobic respiration.

=== Fermentation ===
There are many anaerobic fermentative reactions.

Fermentative anaerobic organisms typically use the lactic acid fermentation pathway:

The energy released in this reaction (without ADP and phosphate) is approximately 150 kJ per mol, which is conserved in generating two ATP from ADP per glucose. This is only 5% of the energy per sugar molecule that the typical aerobic reaction generates.

Plants and fungi (e.g., yeasts) in general use alcohol (ethanol) fermentation when oxygen becomes limiting:

The energy released is about 180 kJ per mol, which is conserved in generating two ATP from ADP per glucose.

Anaerobic bacteria and archaea use these and many other fermentative pathways, e.g., propionic acid fermentation, butyric acid fermentation, solvent fermentation, mixed acid fermentation, butanediol fermentation, Stickland fermentation, acetogenesis, or methanogenesis.

=== CrP hydrolysis ===
Creatine, an organic compound found in animals, provides a way for ATP to be utilized in the muscle. The phosphorylation of creatine allows for the storage of readily available phosphate that can be supplied to the muscles.

creatine + ATP ⇌ phosphocreatine + ADP + H+

The reaction is reversible as well, allowing cellular ATP levels to be maintained during anoxic conditions. This process in animals is seen to be coupled with metabolic suppression to allow certain fish, such as goldfish, to survive environmental anoxic conditions for a short period.

== Culturing anaerobes ==

Since normal microbial culturing occurs in atmospheric air, which contains molecular oxygen, culturing of anaerobes requires special techniques. A number of techniques are employed by microbiologists when culturing anaerobic organisms, for example, handling the bacteria in a glovebox filled with nitrogen or the use of other specially sealed containers, or techniques such as injection of the bacteria into a dicot plant, which is an environment with limited oxygen. The GasPak System is an isolated container that achieves an anaerobic environment by the reaction of water with sodium borohydride and sodium bicarbonate tablets to produce hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide. Hydrogen then reacts with oxygen gas on a palladium catalyst to produce more water, thereby removing oxygen gas. The issue with the GasPak method is that an adverse reaction can take place where the bacteria may die, which is why a thioglycollate medium should be used. The thioglycollate supplies a medium mimicking that of a dicot plant, thus providing not only an anaerobic environment but all the nutrients needed for the bacteria to multiply.

On May the 6 2018, a French team evidenced a link between redox and gut anaerobes based on clinical studies of severe acute malnutrition. These findings led to the development of aerobic culture of &quot;anaerobes&quot; by the addition of antioxidants in the culture medium.

==Multicellularity==
Few multicellular life forms are anaerobic, since only aerobic respiration can provide enough energy for a complex metabolism. Exceptions include three species of Loricifera (&lt; 1 mm in size) and the 10-cell &quot;Henneguya zschokkei&quot;.

In 2010 three species of anaerobic loricifera were discovered in the hypersaline anoxic L&#x27;Atalante basin at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. They lack mitochondria which contain the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, which in all other animals combines oxygen with glucose to produce metabolic energy, and thus they consume no oxygen. Instead, these loricifera derive their energy from hydrogen, using hydrogenosomes.

&quot;Henneguya zschokkei&quot; also lack mitochondria, mitochondrial DNA, and oxidative pathways. The microscopic, parasitic cnidarian is observed to have mitochondria-related organelles contained within it. This mitochondria-related organelle within it is observed to have genes encoding for metabolic functions such as amino acid metabolism. However, these mitochondria-related organelles lack the key features of typical mitochondria found in closely related aerobic Myxobolus squamalus. Due to the difficulty of culturing &quot;H. zschokkei&quot;, there is little understanding of its anaerobic pathway.

== Symbiosis ==
Anaerobic respiration and its end products can facilitate symbiosis between anaerobes and aerobes. This occurs across taxa, often in compensation for nutritional needs.

Anaerobiosis and symbiosis are found in interactions between ciliates and prokaryotes. Anaerobic ciliates interact with prokaryotes in an endosymbiotic relationship. These relationships are mediated in which the ciliate leaves end products that its prokaryotic symbiont utilizes. The ciliate achieves this through the use of fermentative metabolism. The rumen of various animals house this ciliate alongside many other anaerobic bacteria, protozoans, and fungi. In specific, methanogenic archaea found in the rumen acts as a symbiont to anaerobic ciliates. These anaerobes are useful to those with a rumen due to their ability to break down cellulose, making it bioavailable when otherwise indigestible by animals.

Termites utilize anaerobic bacteria to fix and recapture nitrogen. In specific, the hindgut of the termite is full of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, ranging in function depending on the nitrogen concentration of the diet. Acetylene reduction in termites was observed to upregulate in termites with nitrogen-poor diets, meaning that nitrogenase activity rose as the nitrogen content of the termite was reduced. One of the functions of termite microbiota is to recapture nitrogen from the termite&#x27;s uric acid. This allows the conservation of nitrogen from an otherwise nitrogen-poor diet. The hindgut microbiome of different termites has been analyzed, showing 16 different anaerobic species of bacteria, including Clostridia, Enterobacteriaceae, and Gram-positive cocci.

<text>The Defiant Ones is a 1958 American drama film produced and directed by Stanley Kramer. The film was adapted by Harold Jacob Smith from the story by Nedrick Young, originally credited as Nathan E. Douglas. It stars Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier as two escaped prisoners, one white and one black, who are shackled together and who must co-operate in order to survive.

&quot;The Defiant Ones&quot; premiered on June 29, 1958 at the 8th Berlin International Film Festival, where Poitier won the Silver Bear for Best Actor. Upon its release in the U.S. on September 27, the film was highly regarded by film critics. It won Academy Awards for Cinematography (Black-and-White) and Original Screenplay and was nominated for seven others, including Best Picture and Best Actor for both Poitier and Curtis.

==Plot==
One night in the late 1950s in the Southern United States, a truck loaded with prisoners swerves to avoid another truck and crashes through a barrier. The rescuers clear up the debris and discover two prisoners have escaped, an African American man shackled to a white man because &quot;the warden had a sense of humor.&quot; They are told not to look too hard as &quot;they will probably kill each other before they go five miles.&quot; Nevertheless, a large posse and many bloodhounds are dispatched the next morning to find them. The two missing men are Noah Cullen and John &quot;Joker&quot; Jackson. Despite their mutual hatred, they are forced to cooperate, as they are chained together. At first, their co-operation is motivated by self-preservation, but gradually they begin to respect and like each other.

Cullen and Joker flee through difficult terrain and weather, with a brief stop at a turpentine camp where they attempt to break into a general store, in hopes of obtaining food and tools to break the chain. Instead, they are captured by the inhabitants, who form a lynch mob; they are saved only by the interference of &quot;Big&quot; Sam, a man who is appalled by his neighbors&#x27; bloodthirst. Sam persuades the onlookers to lock the convicts up and turn them in the next morning. That night, he secretly releases them, being a former chain-gang prisoner himself.

Finally, they run into a young boy named Billy. They make him take them to his home and his mother, whose husband has abandoned his family. The escapees finally are able to break their chains. When they spend the night there, the lonely woman is attracted to Joker and wants to run off with him. She advises Cullen to go through the swamp to reach the railroad tracks while she and Joker will drive off in her car. However, after Cullen leaves, the woman reveals that she had lied: She has sent Cullen into the dangerous swamp to die to eliminate any chance he would be captured and reveal where Joker had gone. Furious, Joker runs after his friend; as he leaves, Billy shoots him.

Wounded, Joker catches up with Cullen and warns him about the swamp. The posse led by humane sheriff Max Muller gets close. The two hear a train whistle and run toward it. Cullen catches up to the train and jumps aboard. Joker runs alongside, desperately trying to catch up. Cullen calls to Joker and holds out his hand. Their hands clasp, but Cullen is unable to pull Joker aboard. Both men tumble to the ground. Too exhausted to run, they realize all they can do is wait for their pursuers. The sheriff finds Cullen singing defiantly and Joker lying in his arms.

==Cast==

==Production==

Robert Mitchum, a veteran of a Southern chain gang, turned down the role of Jackson because he believed black and white people would not be chained together in the segregated South at that time. Mitchum&#x27;s reasoning was misinterpreted over the years into the claim that he turned down the film because of his refusal to work with a black man. Kramer wrote that Poitier was initially unsure of Curtis&#x27; casting but became supportive. Curtis, however, denied this; he stated that he had contractual rights to approve who would play Cullen. However, despite Curtis&#x27; many later claims and stories, Kramer had cast Poitier and Marlon Brando as the two leads when a previous contractual obligation prevented Poitier from being able to accept the role. Kramer wanted Poitier for the role so badly that he delayed the film&#x27;s production, which led to Brando having to decline because the delay caused shooting to overlap with another obligation. Curtis was cast afterwards. Curtis did request Poitier&#x27;s name appear with his above the movie title marking a first for Poitier in his career.

Carl Switzer, of the &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies, has a small role. It was his last before his death.

In his second autobiography &quot;Why Me&quot;, Sammy Davis Jr. revealed that Elvis Presley wanted to star with him in this film. However, Colonel Tom Parker, Presley&#x27;s manager, was against it.

==Reception==
The film earned rentals of $2.5 million in the United States and Canada but did not perform as well overseas. It ultimately made a profit of $1 million.

===Critical response===
When the film was originally released, Bosley Crowther, film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, lauded the production and the acting in the film, writing &quot;A remarkably apt and dramatic visualization of a social idea—the idea of men of different races brought together to face misfortune in a bond of brotherhood—is achieved by producer Stanley Kramer in his new film, &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot;... Between the two principal performers there isn&#x27;t much room for a choice. Mr. Poitier stands out as the Negro convict and Mr. Curtis is surprisingly good. Both men are intensely dynamic. Mr. Poitier shows a deep and powerful strain of underlying compassion...In the ranks of the pursuers, Theodore Bikel is most impressive as a sheriff with a streak of mercy and justice, which he has to fight to maintain against a brutish state policeman, played by Charles McGraw.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; praised the acting and discussed the film&#x27;s major theme, writing &quot;The theme of &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot; is that what keeps men apart is their lack of knowledge of one another. With that knowledge comes respect, and with respect comradeship and even love. This thesis is exercised in terms of a colored and a white man, both convicts chained together as they make their break for freedom from a Southern prison gang. The performances by Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier are virtually flawless. Poitier captures all of the moody violence of the convict, serving time because he assaulted a white man who had insulted him. It is a cunning, totally intelligent portrayal that rings powerfully true...Curtis delivers a true surprise performance. He starts off as a sneering, brutal character, willing to fight it out to-the-death with his equally stubborn companion. When, in the end, he sacrifices a dash for freedom to save Poitier, by saving him from the swamp, he has managed the transition with such skill that sympathy is completely with him.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 91%, based on 58 reviews.

===Awards and nominations===

American Film Institute

* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Cheers - #55

==Remakes and parodies==
The basis of &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot; was revisited several times in popular media:

* Lenny Bruce parodied the film from his 1960 album &quot;I Am Not a Nut, Elect Me! (Togetherness)&quot;.
* Warner Bros. parodied the film in Friz Freleng&#x27;s 1961 cartoon &quot;D&#x27; Fightin&#x27; Ones&quot;, in which Sylvester the Cat escapes from captivity in a dogcatcher truck while chained to a bulldog.
* On his 1964 debut LP, Godfrey Cambridge parodied the film, re-writing the final scene so that Cullen makes it onto the train without his white companion, to which Cullen (played by Cambridge) says &quot;Byeeee, baby...!&quot;
* Teruo Ishii modeled his 1965 film &quot;Abashiri Prison&quot; on &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot;.
* In 1972, the story changed the gender of the protagonists in the film &quot;Black Mama White Mama,&quot; starring Pam Grier and Margaret Markov.
* Another 1972 B-movie added a science fiction blaxploitation twist as &quot;The Thing with Two Heads&quot;, in which a racist white man (played by Ray Milland) has his head grafted onto the body of a living black man (played by Rosey Grier).
* A pair of Marvel Comics supervillains called Hammer and Anvil were parodies of the film&#x27;s leads.
* In 1986, the film was remade for television, starring Robert Urich and Carl Weathers. 
* The 1987 &quot;G.I. Joe: The Movie&quot; has the temporarily blinded Roadblock and the former Cobra Commander working together to escape Cobra-La; this was a deliberate reference to &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot; by writer Buzz Dixon.
* The film was paid homage to by the 1992 &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; episode &quot;Unchained&quot;, in which protagonist Sam Beckett lands in the body of a white Mississippi road-gang worker chained to a wrongly convicted black man, and the two must escape together or be murdered by the corrupt warden.
* In 1996, the film was remade as &quot;Fled&quot;, starring Laurence Fishburne and Stephen Baldwin.
* The film was unofficially remade in Hindi by Bollywood (Indian cinema) titled &quot;Kachche Dhaage&quot; starring Ajay Devgan and Saif Ali Khan. The story was changed to a different setting to enable the protagonists to be chained together while settling their differences on the run.
* The 2018 western video game &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot; features an optional questline where the player can help two chain gang escapees, a white man named Mr. Black and a black man named Mr. White, evade the law after being wrongfully convicted of a crime, or hand them over to the authorities for their bounties.

<text>Cocijo ( ; occasionally spelt Cociyo, otherwise known as Guziu in the Zapotec language) is a lightning deity of the pre-Columbian Zapotec civilization of southern Mexico. He has attributes characteristic of similar Mesoamerican deities associated with rain, thunder and lightning, such as Tlaloc of central Mexico, and Chaac (or &quot;Chaak&quot;) of the Maya civilization. In the Zapotec language, the word &quot;cocijo&quot; means &quot;lightning&quot;, as well as referring to the deity.

Cocijo was the most important deity among the pre-Columbian Zapotecs because of his association with rainfall. He is commonly represented on ceramics from the Zapotec area, from the Middle Preclassic right through to the Terminal Classic. Cocijo was said to be the great lightning god and creator of the world. In Zapotec myth, he made the sun, moon, stars, seasons, land, mountains, rivers, plants and animals, and day and night by exhaling and creating everything from his breath.

==Appearance==
In Zapotec art Cocijo is represented with a zoomorphic face with a wide, blunt snout and a long forked serpentine tongue. Cocijo often bears the Zapotec glyph C in his headdress. A similar glyph is used in Mixtec codices as the day sign Water and it is likely that its meaning in Zapotec is identical, therefore being the appropriate glyph for the rain and storm god.

Representations of Cocijo combine elements earth-jaguar and sky-serpent, which are associated with fertility. His eyebrows depict the heavens, his lower lids represent clouds, and his forked serpent&#x27;s tongue represents a bolt of lightning.

==Classic Period==
At the Late Classic Zapotec archaeological site of Lambityeco in Oaxaca, the stucco busts of Cocijo are depicted holding a jar spilling water in one hand and bolts of lightning in the other. During the Classic Period the jaguar was associated, at least partly, with Cocijo.

==Postclassic Period==
Among the Zapotecs of the Postclassic period, the four 65-day divisions of the 260-day calendar were named &quot;cocijos&quot;, which implies that there was a different Cocijo associated with each cardinal direction. Religious rites, including bloodletting, were performed to each of these four Cocijos. As payment for bringing rain Cocijo frequently received human sacrifice, mostly in the form of children but also, less frequently, adults.

==Colonial Period==
The worship of Cocijo continued into early Colonial times. In the late 1540s, three community leaders of Yanhuitlán were accused of making sacrifices to the deity, including human sacrifices, by the inhabitants of hostile neighbouring villages and were tried by the inquisitor Francisco Tello de Sandoval.

<doc id="92646" wikidata="Q1058253" url="?curid=92646" title="Chaac">
<text>Chaac (also spelled Chac or, in Classic Mayan, Chaahk ) is the name of the Maya god of rain, thunder, and lightning. With his lightning axe, Chaac strikes the clouds, causing them to produce thunder and rain. Chaac corresponds to Tlaloc among the Aztecs.

== Rain deities and rain makers ==
Like other Maya gods, Chaac is both one and manifold. Four Chaacs are based in the cardinal directions and wear the directional colors. East, where the sunrise is, is red, North, mid-day zenith, is represented by white, West is represented by black for the sunset, and South is represented by yellow. There is a fifth color which is associate with the center point, and that is green. In 16th-century Yucatán, the directional Chaac of the east was called &quot;Chac Xib Chaac&quot; &#x27;Red Man Chaac&#x27;, only the colors being varied for the three other ones.

Contemporary Yucatec Maya farmers distinguish many more aspects of the rainfall and the clouds and personify them as different, hierarchically-ordered rain deities. The Chorti Maya have preserved important folklore regarding the process of rain-making, which involved rain deities striking rain-carrying snakes with their axes.

The rain deities had their human counterparts. In the traditional Maya (and Mesoamerican) community, one of the most important functions was that of rainmaker, which presupposed an intimate acquaintance with (and thus, initiation by) the rain deities, and a knowledge of their places and movements. According to a Late-Postclassic Yucatec tradition, &quot;Chac Xib Chaac&quot; (the rain deity of the east) was the title of a king of Chichen Itza, and similar titles were bestowed upon Classic rulers as well (see below).

== Rain rituals ==
Among the rituals for the rain deities, the Yucatec &quot;Chʼa Cháak&quot; ceremony for asking rain centers on a ceremonial banquet for the rain deities. It includes four boys (one for each cardinal point) acting and chanting as frogs. Asking for rain and crops was also the purpose of 16th-century rituals at the cenotes, of Yucatán. 

The ocellated turkey (&quot;yuum kuuts&quot;) is associated with the deity; one is yearly hunted and sacrificed to obtain its blood to be offered to fields in hopes of a good harvest.

== Mythology ==
The rain deity is a patron of agriculture. A well-known myth in which the Chaacs (or related Rain and Lightning deities) have an important role to play is about the opening of the mountain in which the maize was hidden. In Tzotzil mythology, the rain deity also figures as the father of nubile women representing maize and vegetables. In some versions of the Qʼeqchiʼ myth of Sun and Moon, the rain deity Choc (or Chocl) &#x27;Cloud&#x27; is the brother of Sun; together they defeat their aged adoptive mother and her lover. Later, Chaac commits adultery with his brother&#x27;s wife and is duly punished; his tears of agony give origin to the rain. Versions of this myth show the rain deity Chac in his war-like fury, pursuing the fleeing Sun and Moon, and attacking them with his lightning bolts.

In some mythologies, it is believed that water and clouds are formed within the Earth in caves and cenotes and then carried into the sky by deities such as Chaac. Classic period Maya sources also suggest that Chaac was the god who opened the mountain containing maize, using his lightning axe, K&#x27;awiil.

== Iconography ==
Chaac is usually depicted with a human body showing reptilian or amphibian scales, and with a non-human head evincing fangs and a long, pendulous nose. In the Classic style, a shell serves as his ear ornament. He often carries a shield and a lightning axe, the axe being personified by a closely related deity, K&#x27;awiil, called Bolon Dzacab in Yucatec. The Classic Chaac sometimes shows features of the Central Mexican (Teotihuacan) precursor of Tlaloc.

=== Rain ===

A large part of one of the four surviving Maya codices, the Dresden Codex, is dedicated to the Chaacs, their locations, and activities. It illustrates the intimate relationship existing between the Chaacs, the Bacabs, and the aged goddess, Ixchel. The main source on the 16th-century Yucatec Maya, Bishop Diego de Landa, combines the four Chaacs with the four Bacabs and Pauahtuns into one concept. The Bacabs were aged deities governing the subterranean sphere and its water supplies.

=== Warfare ===
In the Classic period, the king often impersonated the rain deity (or an associated rain serpent) while a portrait glyph of the rain deity can accompany the king&#x27;s other names. This may have given expression to his role as a supreme rain-maker. Typically, however, it is the war-like fury of the rain deity that receives emphasis (as is also the case in the myth mentioned above). The king personifying the rain deity is then shown carrying war implements and making prisoners, while his actions seem to be equated with the violence of a thunderstorm.

=== Classic period narrative ===
About Chaahk&#x27;s role in Classic period mythological narrative, little is known. He is present at the resurrection of the Maya maize god from the carapace of a turtle, possibly representing the earth. The so-called &#x27;confrontation scenes&#x27; are of a more legendary nature. They show a young nobleman and his retinue wading through the waters and being approached by warriors. One of these warriors is a man personifying the rain deity. He probably represents an ancestral king, and seems to be referred to as &quot;Chak Xib [Chaahk].&quot; Together with the skeletal Death God (God A), Chaahk also appears to preside over an initiate&#x27;s ritual transformation into a jaguar.

== In modern times ==
Chaac continues to hold importance for some Maya groups in Mexico. In 2024, a statue of the Greek god Poseidon located in Progreso, Yucatán, caused controversy for locals who deemed it offensive to their beliefs in Chaac. Many locals organized with the goal of destroying the statue because it supposedly angered Chaac. While the movement originated as a joke, many took it seriously and attempted to vandalize the statue. Activist lawyers sought to have the statue removed, and some people in Mexico cited Tropical Storm Alberto and Hurricane Beryl as proof that Chaac was upset at Poseidon.

<text>Portlaoise ( ), or Port Laoise (), is the county town of County Laois, Ireland.
It is located in the South Midlands in the province of Leinster.

Portlaoise was the fastest growing of the top 20 largest towns and cities in Ireland from 2011 to 2016. However, the 2022 census shows that the town&#x27;s population increased by 6.6% to 23,494, which was below the national average of 8%. It is the most populous and also the most densely populated town in the Midland Region, which has a total population of 317,999 at the 2022 census. 

It was an important town in the medieval period, as the site of the Fort of Maryborough, a fort built by English settlers in the 16th century during the Plantation of Queen&#x27;s County.

Portlaoise is fringed by the Slieve Bloom mountains to the west and north-west and the Great Heath of Maryborough to the east. It is notable for its architecture, engineering and transport connections.
On the national road network, Portlaoise is located west-southwest from Dublin on the M7, north-east from Cork on the M8/M7 and east-northeast from Limerick on the M7.

It was once known for the manufacture of iron and steel buildings, tennis balls, rubber seals, tyres, electrical cabling, and Ireland&#x27;s first aircraft. Today, Portlaoise is a commercial centre with the economy dominated by the service sector, and a hub of shopping, transport, and events for the surrounding catchment.

==History==

The site of the present town is referred to in the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;, written in the 1630s, as &quot;Port Laoighisi&quot;. The present town originated as a settlement around the old fort, &quot;Fort of Leix&quot; or &quot;Fort Protector&quot;, the remains of which can still be seen in the town centre. Its construction began in 1548 under the supervision of the then Lord Deputy Sir Edward Bellingham, in an attempt to secure English control of the county following the exile of Celtic chieftains the previous year. The fort&#x27;s location on rising ground, surrounded to the south and east by the natural defensive barricades of the River Triogue and an esker known locally as &#x27;the Ridge&#x27;, greatly added to its strategic importance.

The town proper was established by an Act of Parliament during the reign of Queen Mary in 1557. Though the early fort and its surrounding settlement had been known by a number of names, such as Governor, Port Laois, Campa and Fort Protector, the new town was named Maryborough (IPA [ˈmarbrə]) and the county was named Queen&#x27;s County in Mary&#x27;s honour. In about 1556, Portlaoise acquired its first parish church—Old St Peter&#x27;s—situated to the west of Fort Protector. Although first built as a Catholic church, due to Queen Mary&#x27;s re-establishment of Roman Catholicism, the church was used for Protestant services after the accession to the English throne of Mary&#x27;s half-sister, Elizabeth.

The area had been a focus of the rebellion of Ruairí Óg Ó Mórdha, a local chieftain who had rebelled and had lost his lands, which the Crown wanted to be settled by reliable landowners. For the next fifty or so years, the new English settlers in Maryborough fought a continual, low-scale war with the Gaelic chieftains who fought against the new settlement. The town had been burnt several times by the end of the 16th century.
Maryborough was granted a market in 1567, and then in 1570, a charter of Queen Elizabeth I raised the town to the rank of borough. This allowed the establishment of a Corporation of the Borough, a body which consisted of a burgomaster, two bailiffs, a town clerk, and a sergeant at arms, as well as various other officers, burgesses and freemen. The Maryborough Division was represented by two members in the Irish Parliament until 1800. The Act of Union ended this franchise, and it became part of the electorate of Queen&#x27;s County until 1922. The town&#x27;s Corporation itself existed until 1830.

In 1803–04, a new Church of Ireland church was built to replace the Old St Peter&#x27;s; it was the first building to be erected on the new Market Square. The building is attributed to architect James Gandon. Other notable buildings constructed in Maryborough in the 19th century included the Court House on Main Street, built in 1805; the County Gaol built in 1830 to a design by William Deane Butler; and the neo-classical St. Fintan&#x27;s Hospital, built in 1833 on the Dublin Road.

The city of Maryborough, Victoria in Australia was named in the 1850s after his birthplace by James Daly, a gold commissioner,

In 1929, a few years after the foundation of the Irish Free State, the town was renamed &quot;Portlaoighise&quot; (later simplified to &quot;Port Laoise&quot;) and the county was renamed County Laois.

==Local government==

The town forms part of the Portlaoise local electoral area and municipal district for elections to Laois County Council. This includes the urban Portlaoise area, Abbeyleix and Ballinakill and surrounding rural areas. As of 2020, the total population of the Portlaoise local electoral area is 31,794 people. Portlaoise Town Council was abolished in 2014 in accordance with the Local Government Reform Act 2014. Portlaoise Town Hall on Market Square, which was designed in the French Renaissance-style, was badly damaged in a fire in March 1945 and subsequently demolished.

Portlaoise is twinned with Coulounieix-Chamiers, Dordogne, New Aquitaine, France.

==Demography==
Portlaoise was among Ireland&#x27;s fastest growing towns from 2006 to 2011, with a 37.9% increase in population. In the 2016 census it was again in the top 10 fastest growing regions, with the population of the town and its suburbs exceeding 22,000. By the 2022 census, population reached 23,494.

In 2022, non-Irish nationals accounted for 28.47% of the population, compared with a national average figure of 20%. Polish (6.29%) were the largest single group, with the largest categories being Other European Union (7.88%) and Rest of the World (9.79%). The former Mayor, Rotimi Adebari, was the first person of African descent to become a mayor in Ireland.

Due to rapid population growth and its location in the commuter belt, Portlaoise has seen the development of additional services, including a new fire station and a large swimming leisure complex. Portlaoise has a high percentage of people under the age of 15, reflected in the recent construction of new secondary and primary schools.

==Economy==
Portlaoise has long been a major commercial and retail hub for the Midlands. Until the mid 20th century, the main industries of the town were flour milling and the manufacture of worsted fabric. Since their respective declines, among the largest employers are state-owned bodies such as the maximum-security Portlaoise Prison, which houses the majority of the Irish Republican prisoners sentenced in the Republic, the Midlands Prison, the Department of Agriculture and the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise. State-owned companies Córas Iompair Éireann (railways, with a National Traincare Maintenance Depot in Portlaoise), the ESB (utilities, with a training centre in the town) and also An Post are all major employers. In 2013 &quot;MyPay&quot;, a new central payroll system for 55,000 local authority employees across Ireland, was set up in Portlaoise.

Due to its location and transport connections, the National Spatial Strategy chose Portlaoise as the location for Ireland&#x27;s first &quot;Inland Port&quot;. This designation encourages the town to focus on the growth of distribution, logistics and warehouse uses. An Post operates the second largest mail centre in Ireland (after Dublin) at their depot in Portlaoise.

===Retail===
Retail spaces include Laois Shopping Centre which is anchored by Tesco, The Kyle Centre which is anchored by Dunnes Stores, Parkside Shopping Centre which is anchored by Super Valu, the Kylekiproe road retail area which houses Aldi, Lidl and Shaws department stores as well as retail parks in Kea Lew and on the South Circular Road.

Tourist sites near the area include the Rock of Dunamase (6 km to the east), a hill-top castle which dates from the 12th century. There is also a 12th-century round tower 12 km away in Timahoe.

Also close by is Fort Protector, a 16th-century fort built to protect British colonists from Irish natives.

Emo Court is a large Georgian estate designed by James Gandon at nearby Emo.

==Transport==

Portlaoise stands at a major crossroads in the Irish roads network (major roads to Dublin, Limerick, Cork) although construction in the 1990s of the M7 motorway, which bypasses the town, has reduced traffic congestion in the town centre.

Portlaoise railway station is one of the busiest railway stations outside of Dublin, and is served by intercity trains between Dublin and Cork and by Dublin commuter services. Maryborough railway station opened on 26 June 1847. It is the terminus of the Portlaoise Commuter Service, which stops at all stations to Heuston and runs hourly off peak and every 20/30 minutes during peak times. It is the busiest county town railway station in the Midland Region, with up to 32 trains to Dublin (10 non-stop) and 30 trains from Dublin (9 non-stop) per day. Córas Iompair Éireann opened a rail depot south-west of Portlaoise town centre in March 2008, with a maintenance and servicing facility for the 183 new intercity railcars and some facilities for outer suburban railcars serving the Kildare route.

Bus Éireann previously operated an intercity service between Dublin and Cork/Limerick which called at Portlaoise, though this was suspended indefinitely in 2020. The number 8 (Cork) service terminated in 2012 and the number 12 terminated in 2021. There is still one Bus Éireann service that stops in Portlaoise, route 73, which operates from Athlone to Waterford. Limerick is served by JJ Kavanagh and Sons route 735, with TFI Local Link route 834 serving Roscrea. TFI local Link route 828 and 858, operated by JJ Kavanagh and Sons, serves Cashel and Thurles. Local Link also has a 823 service to from Portlaoise to Birr.

==Aviation History==
Portlaoise is the birthplace of aviation in Ireland. The first aeroplane made in Ireland was assembled in the town by Frank &amp; Louis Aldritt, William Rogers &amp; John Conroy, and made its first flight as reported in the King&#x27;s County Chronicle on 4 November 1909. Put in storage during the World War I, it remained in storage until it was discovered over 50 years later in an English museum by Joe Rogers, son of William Rogers, one of the original builders of the aircraft. It was eventually brought back to Portlaoise where it has been restored.

==Culture and community==
===Nightlife===

Portlaoise&#x27;s central location within Ireland and its concentration of restaurants, pubs, bars and nightclubs around Market Square, Main Street and the Church Street area of the town centre and other nearby facilities such as paintball, golf, bowling and other amenities make it a popular destination for hen and stag parties and other weekend breaks. Portlaoise railway station is the closest station to Stradbally Hall where the Electric Picnic Festival is held each year.

===Arts and festivals===
Every year the town hosts the Old Fort Quarter Festival in June, the Halloween Howls Comedy Festival on the October bank holiday weekend and the Leaves Literary Festival in November.

The Dunamaise Arts Centre which comprises a cinema, performance space and exhibition space is located in the building which formally housed the Maryborough Gaol. The opening of the Arts Centre in 1999 coincided with the revival of the Laois Drama Group.

The &quot;Old Fort Festival&quot;, which was moved from 2019 into the grounds of the old Fort itself, is an annual event but was postponed in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 3 day heritage festival is based in and around the walls of the Old Fort Protector, the first of its kind built in Ireland between 1547 and 1548 during the tenure of Bellingham, Lord Justice of Ireland, in the reign of &quot;the boy King&quot; Edward VI. 
The Stradbally Steam Rally is an annual event held on the August bank holiday weekend in Stradbally Hall. It attracts visitors from all over Ireland and is the highlight of the year for steam enthusiasts.

The All-Ireland Scarecrow Festival is held in Durrow at the end of July each year. It has featured large scarecrows including King Kong, Pope Francis, Noah&#x27;s Ark and Electric Picnic. The town is dotted with scarecrows made by local groups, children, businesses and people from neighbouring counties.

<text>Same-sex marriage, also known as gay marriage, is the marriage of two people of the same legal sex. marriage between same-sex couples is legally performed and recognized in 38 countries, with a total population of 1.5 billion people (20% of the world&#x27;s population). The most recent jurisdiction to legalize same-sex marriage is Thailand.

Same-sex marriage is legally recognized in a large majority of the world&#x27;s developed countries; notable exceptions are Italy, Japan, South Korea and the Czech Republic. Adoption rights are not necessarily covered, though most states with same-sex marriage allow those couples to jointly adopt as other married couples can. Some countries, such as Nigeria and Russia, restrict advocacy for same-sex marriage. A few of these are among the 35 countries (as of 2023) that constitutionally define marriage to prevent marriage between couples of the same sex, with most of those provisions enacted in recent decades as a preventative measure. Other countries have constitutionally mandated Islamic law, which is generally interpreted as prohibiting marriage between same-sex couples. In six of the former and most of the latter, homosexuality itself is criminalized.

There are records of marriage between men dating back to the first century. Michael McConnell and Jack Baker are the first same sex couple in modern recorded history known to obtain a marriage license, have their marriage solemnized, which occurred on September 3, 1971, in Minnesota, and have it legally recognized by any form of government. The first law providing for marriage equality between same-sex and opposite-sex couples was passed in the continental Netherlands in 2000 and took effect on 1 April 2001. The application of marriage law equally to same-sex and opposite-sex couples has varied by jurisdiction, and has come about through legislative change to marriage law, court rulings based on constitutional guarantees of equality, recognition that marriage of same-sex couples is allowed by existing marriage law, and by direct popular vote, such as through referendums and initiatives. The most prominent supporters of same-sex marriage are the world&#x27;s major medical and scientific communities, human rights and civil rights organizations, and some progressive religious groups, while its most prominent opponents are from conservative religious groups (some of which nonetheless support same-sex civil unions providing legal protections for same-sex couples). Polls consistently show continually rising support for the recognition of same-sex marriage in all developed democracies and in many developing countries.

Scientific studies show that the financial, psychological, and physical well-being of gay people is enhanced by marriage, and that the children of same-sex parents benefit from being raised by married same-sex couples within a marital union that is recognized by law and supported by societal institutions. At the same time, no harm is done to the institution of marriage among heterosexuals. Social science research indicates that the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage stigmatizes and invites public discrimination against gay and lesbian people, with research repudiating the notion that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon restricting marriage to heterosexuals. Same-sex marriage can provide those in committed same-sex relationships with relevant government services and make financial demands on them comparable to that required of those in opposite-sex marriages, and also gives them legal protections such as inheritance and hospital visitation rights. Opposition is often based on religious teachings, such as the view that marriage is meant to be between men and women, and that procreation is the natural goal of marriage. Other forms of opposition are based on claims such as that homosexuality is unnatural and abnormal, that the recognition of same-sex unions will promote homosexuality in society, and that children are better off when raised by opposite-sex couples. These claims are refuted by scientific studies, which show that homosexuality is a natural and normal variation in human sexuality, that sexual orientation is not a choice, and that children of same-sex couples fare just as well as the children of opposite-sex couples.
==Terminology==
===Alternative terms===

Some proponents of the legal recognition of same-sex marriage—such as Marriage Equality USA (founded in 1998), Freedom to Marry (founded in 2003), Canadians for Equal Marriage, and Marriage for All Japan - used the terms &quot;marriage equality&quot; and &quot;equal marriage&quot; to signal that their goal was for same-sex marriage to be recognized on equal ground with opposite-sex marriage. The Associated Press recommends the use of &quot;same-sex marriage&quot; over &quot;gay marriage&quot;. In deciding whether to use the term &quot;gay marriage&quot;, it may also be noted that not everyone in a same-sex marriage is gay – for example, some are bisexual – and therefore using the term &quot;gay marriage&quot; is sometimes considered erasure of such people.

===Use of the term &quot;marriage&quot;===
Anthropologists have struggled to determine a definition of marriage that absorbs commonalities of the social construct across cultures around the world. Many proposed definitions have been criticized for failing to recognize the existence of same-sex marriage in some cultures, including those of more than 30 African peoples, such as the Kikuyu and Nuer.

With several countries revising their marriage laws to recognize same-sex couples in the 21st century, all major English dictionaries have revised their definition of the word marriage to either drop gender specifications or supplement them with secondary definitions to include gender-neutral language or explicit recognition of same-sex unions. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; has recognized same-sex marriage since 2000.

Opponents of same-sex marriage who want marriage to be restricted to pairings of a man and a woman, such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Catholic Church, and the Southern Baptist Convention, use the term &quot;traditional marriage&quot; to mean opposite-sex marriage.

==History==


===Ancient===

A reference to marriage between same-sex couples appears in the Sifra, which was written in the 3rd century CE. The Book of Leviticus prohibited homosexual relations, and the Hebrews were warned not to &quot;follow the acts of the land of Egypt or the acts of the land of Canaan&quot; (Lev. 18:22, 20:13). The Sifra clarifies what these ambiguous &quot;acts&quot; were, and that they included marriage between same-sex couples: &quot;A man would marry a man and a woman a woman, a man would marry a woman and her daughter, and a woman would be married to two men.&quot;

A few scholars believe that in the early Roman Empire some male couples were celebrating traditional marriage rites in the presence of friends. Male–male weddings are reported by sources that mock them; the feelings of the participants are not recorded. Various ancient sources state that the emperor Nero celebrated two public weddings with males, once taking the role of the bride (with a freedman Pythagoras), and once the groom (with Sporus); there may have been a third in which he was the bride. In the early 3rd century AD, the emperor Elagabalus is reported to have been the bride in a wedding to his male partner. Other mature men at his court had husbands, or said they had husbands in imitation of the emperor. Roman law did not recognize marriage between males, but one of the grounds for disapproval expressed in Juvenal&#x27;s satire is that celebrating the rites would lead to expectations for such marriages to be registered officially. As the empire was becoming Christianized in the 4th century, legal prohibitions against marriage between males began to appear.

===Contemporary===

Michael McConnell and Jack Baker are the first same sex couple in modern recorded history known to obtain a marriage license, have their marriage solemnized, which occurred on September 3, 1971, in Minnesota, and have it legally recognized by any form of government. Historians variously trace the beginning of the modern movement in support of same-sex marriage to anywhere from around the 1980s to the 1990s. During the 1980s in the United States, the AIDS epidemic led to increased attention on the legal aspects of same-sex relationships. Andrew Sullivan made the first case for same sex marriage in a major American journal in 1989, published in &quot;The New Republic&quot;.

In 1989, Denmark became the first country to legally recognize a relationship for same-sex couples, establishing registered partnerships, which gave those in same-sex relationships &quot;most rights of married heterosexuals, but not the right to adopt or obtain joint custody of a child&quot;. In 2001, the continental Netherlands became the first country to broaden marriage laws to include same-sex couples. Since then, same-sex marriage has been established by law in 38 other countries, including most of the Americas and Western Europe. Yet its spread has been uneven — South Africa is the only country in Africa to take the step; Taiwan and Thailand are the only ones in Asia.
==Timeline==

The summary table below lists in chronological order the sovereign states (the United Nations member states and Taiwan) that have legalized same-sex marriage. As of 2025, 38 states have legalized in some capacity.

Dates are when marriages between same-sex couples began to be officially certified, or when local laws were passed if marriages were already legal under higher authority.

==Same-sex marriage around the world==
Same-sex marriage is legally performed and recognized in 38 countries: Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay. Same-sex marriage performed remotely or abroad is recognized with full marital rights by Israel.

Same-sex marriage is under consideration by the legislature or the courts in El Salvador, Italy, Japan, Nepal, and Venezuela.

Civil unions are being considered in a number of countries, including Kosovo, Peru, and Poland. 

On 12 March 2015, the European Parliament passed a non-binding resolution encouraging EU institutions and member states to &quot;[reflect] on the recognition of same-sex marriage or same-sex civil union as a political, social and human and civil rights issue&quot;.

In response to the international spread of same-sex marriage, a number of countries have enacted preventative constitutional bans, with the most recent being Mali in 2023, and Gabon in 2024. In other countries, such restrictions and limitations are effected through legislation. Even before same-sex marriage was first legislated, some countries had constitutions that specified that marriage was between a man and a woman.

===International court rulings===

==== European Court of Human Rights ====
In 2010, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in &quot;Schalk and Kopf v Austria&quot;, a case involving an Austrian same-sex couple who were denied the right to marry. The court found, by a vote of 4 to 3, that their human rights had not been violated. The court further stated that same-sex unions are not protected under art. 12 of ECHR (&quot;Right to marry&quot;), which exclusively protects the right to marry of opposite-sex couples (without regard if the sex of the partners is the result of birth or of sex change), but they are protected under art. 8 of ECHR (&quot;Right to respect for private and family life&quot;) and art. 14 (&quot;Prohibition of discrimination&quot;).

Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights states that: &quot;Men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of this right&quot;, not limiting marriage to those in a heterosexual relationship. However, the ECHR stated in &quot;Schalk and Kopf v Austria&quot; that this provision was intended to limit marriage to heterosexual relationships, as it used the term &quot;men and women&quot; instead of &quot;everyone&quot;. Nevertheless, the court accepted and is considering cases concerning same-sex marriage recognition, e.g. &quot;Andersen v Poland&quot;. In 2021, the court ruled in &quot;Fedotova and Others v. Russia&quot;—followed by later judgements concerning other member states—that countries must provide some sort of legal recognition to same-sex couples, although not necessarily marriage.

==== European Union ====

On 5 June 2018, the European Court of Justice ruled, in a case from Romania, that, under the specific conditions of the couple in question, married same-sex couples have the same residency rights as other married couples in an EU country, even if that country does not permit or recognize same-sex marriage. However, the ruling was not implemented in Romania and on 14 September 2021 the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on the European Commission to ensure that the ruling is respected across the EU.

==== Inter-American Court of Human Rights ====

On 8 January 2018, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) issued an advisory opinion that states party to the American Convention on Human Rights should grant same-sex couples accession to all existing domestic legal systems of family registration, including marriage, along with all rights that derive from marriage. The Court recommended that governments issue temporary decrees recognizing same-sex marriage until new legislation is brought in. They also said that it was inadmissible and discriminatory for a separate legal provision to be established (such as civil unions) instead of same-sex marriage.

==Other arrangements==
===Civil unions===

Civil union, civil partnership, domestic partnership, registered partnership, unregistered partnership, and unregistered cohabitation statuses offer varying legal benefits of marriage. As of , countries that have an alternative form of legal recognition other than marriage on a national level are: Bolivia, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Monaco, Montenegro and San Marino. Same-sex marriage performed remotely or abroad is recognized with full marital rights by Israel. Poland offers more limited rights. Additionally, various cities and counties in Cambodia and Japan offer same-sex couples varying levels of benefits, which include hospital visitation rights and others.

Additionally, nineteen countries that have legally recognized same-sex marriage also have an alternative form of recognition for same-sex couples, usually available to heterosexual couples as well: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, France, Greece, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom and Uruguay.

They are also available in parts of the United States (Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey, Nevada and Oregon) and Canada.

===Non-sexual same-sex marriage===
====Kenya====

Female same-sex marriage is practiced among the Gikuyu, Nandi, Kamba, Kipsigis, and to a lesser extent neighboring peoples. About 5–10% of women are in such marriages. However, this is not seen as homosexual, but is instead a way for families without sons to keep their inheritance within the family.

====Nigeria====

Among the Igbo people and probably other peoples in the south of the country, there are circumstances where a marriage between women is considered appropriate, such as when a woman has no child and her husband dies, and she takes a wife to perpetuate her inheritance and family lineage.

== Studies ==
The American Anthropological Association stated on 26 February 2004:

Research findings from 1998 to 2015 from the University of Virginia, Michigan State University, Florida State University, the University of Amsterdam, the New York State Psychiatric Institute, Stanford University, the University of California-San Francisco, the University of California-Los Angeles, Tufts University, Boston Medical Center, the Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health, and independent researchers also support the findings of this study.

The overall socio-economic and health effects of legal access to same-sex marriage around the world have been summarized by Badgett and co-authors. The review found that sexual minority individuals took-up legal marriage when it became available to them (but at lower rates than different-sex couples). There is instead no evidence that same-sex marriage legalization affected different-sex marriages. On the health side, same-sex marriage legalization increased health insurance coverage for individuals in same-sex couples (in the US), and it led to improvements in sexual health among men who have sex with men, while there is mixed evidence on mental health effects among sexual minorities. In addition, the study found mixed evidence on a range of downstream social outcomes such as attitudes toward LGBTQ+ people and employment choices of sexual minorities.

===Health===

, the data of current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to mixed-sex marriage indicate that same-sex and mixed-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parent&#x27;s sexual orientation is unrelated to their ability to provide a healthy and nurturing family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. Same-sex parents and carers and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships. Studies in the United States have correlated legalization of same-sex marriage to lower rates of HIV infection, psychiatric disorders, and suicide rate in the LGBT population.

==Issues==

While few societies have recognized same-sex unions as marriages, the historical and anthropological record reveals a large range of attitudes towards same-sex unions ranging from praise, through full acceptance and integration, sympathetic toleration, indifference, prohibition and discrimination, to persecution and physical annihilation. Opponents of same-sex marriages have argued that same-sex marriage, while doing good for the couples that participate in them and the children they are raising, undermines a right of children to be raised by their biological mother and father. Some supporters of same-sex marriages take the view that the government should have no role in regulating personal relationships, while others argue that same-sex marriages would provide social benefits to same-sex couples. The debate regarding same-sex marriages includes debate based upon social viewpoints as well as debate based on majority rules, religious convictions, economic arguments, health-related concerns, and a variety of other issues.

===Parenting===
Scientific literature indicates that parents&#x27; financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union (either a mixed-sex or same-sex union). As a result, professional scientific associations have argued for same-sex marriage to be legally recognized as it will be beneficial to the children of same-sex parents or carers.

Scientific research has been generally consistent in showing that lesbian and gay parents are as fit and capable as heterosexual parents, and their children are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted as children reared by heterosexual parents. According to scientific literature reviews, there is no evidence to the contrary.

Compared to heterosexual couples, same-sex couples have a greater need for adoption or assisted reproductive technology to become parents. Lesbian couples often use artificial insemination to achieve pregnancy, and reciprocal in vitro fertilization (where one woman provides the egg and the other gestates the child) is becoming more popular in the 2020s, although many couples cannot afford it. Surrogacy is an option for wealthier gay male couples, but the cost is prohibitive. Other same-sex couples adopt children or raise the children from earlier opposite-sex relationships.

====Adoption====
All states that allow same-sex marriage also allow the joint adoption of children by those couples with the exception of Ecuador and a third of states in Mexico, though such restrictions have been ruled unconstitutional in Mexico. In addition, Bolivia, Croatia and Israel, which do not recognize same-sex marriage, nonetheless permit joint adoption by same-sex couples. Some additional states do not recognize same-sex marriage but allow stepchild adoption by couples in civil unions, namely the Czech Republic and San Marino.

===Transgender and intersex people===
The legal status of same-sex marriage may have implications for the marriages of couples in which one or both parties are transgender, depending on how sex is defined within a jurisdiction. Transgender and intersex individuals may be prohibited from marrying partners of the &quot;opposite&quot; sex or permitted to marry partners of the &quot;same&quot; sex due to legal distinctions. In any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. In addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transgender male or female to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity.

In the United Kingdom, the &quot;Gender Recognition Act 2004&quot; allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Because in the United Kingdom marriages were until recently only for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are only for same-sex couples, a person had to dissolve their civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate, and the same was formerly true for marriages in England and Wales, and still is in other territories. Such people are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. In Austria, a similar provision requiring transsexual people to divorce before having their legal sex marker corrected was found to be unconstitutional in 2006. In Quebec, prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, only unmarried people could apply for legal change of gender. With the advent of same-sex marriage, this restriction was dropped. A similar provision including sterilization also existed in Sweden, but was phased out in 2013. In the United States, transgender and intersex marriages was subject to legal complications. As definitions and enforcement of marriage are defined by the states, these complications vary from state to state, as some of them prohibit legal changes of gender.

===Divorce===

In the United States before the case of &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, couples in same-sex marriages could only obtain a divorce in jurisdictions that recognized same-sex marriages, with some exceptions.

===Judicial and legislative===

There are differing positions regarding the manner in which same-sex marriage has been introduced into democratic jurisdictions. A &quot;majority rules&quot; position holds that same-sex marriage is valid, or void and illegal, based upon whether it has been accepted by a simple majority of voters or of their elected representatives.

In contrast, a civil rights view holds that the institution can be validly created through the ruling of an impartial judiciary carefully examining the questioning and finding that the right to marry regardless of the gender of the participants is guaranteed under the civil rights laws of the jurisdiction.

==Public opinion==

Numerous polls and studies on the issue have been conducted. A trend of increasing support for same-sex marriage has been revealed across many countries of the world, often driven in large part by a generational difference in support. Polling that was conducted in developed democracies in this century shows a majority of people in support of same-sex marriage. Support for same-sex marriage has increased across every age group, political ideology, religion, gender, race and region of various developed countries in the world.

Various detailed polls and studies on same-sex marriage that were conducted in several countries show that support for same-sex marriage significantly increases with higher levels of education and is also significantly stronger among younger generations, with a clear trend of continually increasing support.

;Greater support with youth
Pew Research polling results from 32 countries found 21 with statistically higher support for same-sex marriage among those under 35 than among those over 35 in 2022–2023. Countries with the greatest absolute difference are placed to the left in the following chart. Countries without a significant generational difference are placed to the right.

A 2016 survey by the Varkey Foundation found similarly high support of same-sex marriage (63%) among 18–21-year-olds in an online survey of 18 countries around the world.

(The sampling error is approx. 4% for Nigeria and 3% for the other countries. Because of legal constraints, the question on same-sex marriage was not asked in the survey countries of Russia and Indonesia.)

<text>Waterford ( ) is a city in County Waterford in the south-east of Ireland. It is located within the province of Munster. The city is situated at the head of Waterford Harbour. It is the oldest and the fifth most populous city in the Republic of Ireland. It is the ninth most populous settlement on the island of Ireland. As of the 2022 census, 60,079 people lived in the city and its suburbs.

Historically the site of a Viking settlement, Waterford&#x27;s medieval defensive walls and fortifications include the 13th or 14th century Reginald&#x27;s Tower. The medieval city was attacked several times, and earned the motto &quot;Urbs Intacta Manet&quot; (&#x27;The Untaken City&#x27;), after repelling one such 15th century siege. Waterford is known for its former glassmaking industry, including at the Waterford Crystal factory, with decorative glass being manufactured in the city from 1783 until early 2009 when the factory closed following the receivership of Waterford Wedgwood plc. The Waterford Crystal visitor centre was opened, in the city&#x27;s Viking Quarter, in 2010 and resumed production under new ownership. As of the 21st century, Waterford is the county town of County Waterford and the local government authority is Waterford City and County Council. 

==History==

The name &#x27;Waterford&#x27; comes . The Irish name is &quot;Port Láirge&quot;, meaning &quot;Lárag&#x27;s port&quot;.

Viking raiders first established a settlement near Waterford in 853. It and all the other longphorts were vacated , the Vikings having been driven out by the native Irish. The Vikings re-established themselves in Ireland at Waterford in 914, led at first by Ottir Iarla (Jarl Ottar) until 917, and after that by Ragnall ua Ímair and the Uí Ímair dynasty, and built what would be Ireland&#x27;s first city. Among the most prominent rulers of Waterford was Ivar of Waterford.

In 1167, Diarmait Mac Murchada, the deposed King of Leinster, failed in an attempt to take Waterford. He returned in 1170 with Cambro-Norman mercenaries under Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (known as Strongbow); together they besieged and took the city after a desperate defence. In furtherance of the Norman invasion of Ireland, King Henry II of England landed at Waterford in 1171. Waterford and then Dublin were declared royal cities, with Dublin also declared the capital of Ireland.

Reginald&#x27;s Tower, built after the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland on the site of an earlier fortification and retaining its Viking name, was one of the first in Ireland to use mortar in its construction.

Throughout the medieval period, Waterford was Ireland&#x27;s second city after Dublin. In the 15th century, Waterford repelled sieges by two pretenders to the English throne: Lambert Simnel and Perkin Warbeck. As a result, King Henry VII gave the city its motto: &quot;Urbs Intacta Manet Waterfordia&quot; (&quot;Waterford remains an untouched city&quot;).

After the Protestant Reformation, Waterford remained a Catholic city and participated in the confederation of Kilkenny – an independent Catholic government from 1642 to 1649. This was ended abruptly by Oliver Cromwell, who brought the country back under English rule; his son-in-law Henry Ireton finally took Waterford in 1650 after a two major sieges. In 1690, during the Williamite War, the Jacobite Irish Army was forced to surrender Waterford in the wake of the Battle of the Boyne.

The 18th century was a period of huge prosperity for Waterford. Many of the city&#x27;s architecturally notable buildings appeared during this time. A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of the Cavalry Barracks at the end of the 18th century.

In the early 19th century, Waterford City was deemed vulnerable and the British government erected three Martello towers on the Hook Peninsula to reinforce the existing Fort at Duncannon. During the 19th century, industries such as glass making and ship building thrived in the city.

The city was represented in the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1891 to 1918 by John Redmond MP, leader (from January 1900) of the Irish Parliamentary Party. Redmond, then leader of the pro-Parnell faction of the party, defeated David Sheehy in 1891.

In July 1922, Waterford was the scene of fighting between Irish Free State and Irish Republican troops during the Irish Civil War.

==Politics==
===Local government===
Following the Local Government Reform Act 2014, Waterford City and County Council is the local government authority for the city and county. The authority came into operation on 1 June 2014. Prior to this the city had its own local council, Waterford City Council. The new council is the result of a merger of Waterford City Council and Waterford County Council. The council has 32 representatives (councillors) who are elected from six local electoral areas. The city itself forms three of the electoral areas – which when combined form the Metropolitan District of Waterford City – and returns a total of 18 councillors to Waterford City and County Council. The office of the Mayor of Waterford was established in 1377. A mayor is elected by the councillors from the three electoral areas of the Metropolitan District of Waterford every year, and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual may serve. Mary O&#x27;Halloran, who was mayor from 2007 to 2008, was the first woman to hold the post.

===National politics===
For the elections to Dáil Éireann, the city is part of the 4-seat constituency of Waterford, which includes the city and county of Waterford. For elections to the European Parliament, the county is part of the South constituency.

==Geography==

===Harbour and port===
The city is situated at the head of Waterford Harbour ( or ). The River Suir, which flows through Waterford City, has provided a basis for the city&#x27;s long maritime history. The place downriver from Waterford where the Nore and the Barrow join the River Suir is known in Irish as &quot;Cumar na dTrí Uisce&quot; (&quot;The confluence of the three waters&quot;). Waterford Port has been one of Ireland&#x27;s major ports for over a millennium. In the 19th century, shipbuilding was a major industry. The owners of the Neptune Shipyard, the Malcomson family, built and operated the largest fleet of iron steamers in the world between the mid-1850s and the late 1860s, including five trans-Atlantic passenger liners.

===Climate===
The climate of Waterford is, like the rest of Ireland, classified as a maritime temperate climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification system. It is mild and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes. The counties in the Waterford area are often referred to as the &#x27;Sunny Southeast&#x27;. The warmest months of the year are June, July and August with average daytime temperatures of around 17 – 22 degrees. Rainfall is evenly distributed year-round; however, the period from late October to late January is considerably wetter and duller than the rest of the year.

==Places of interest==
The city of Waterford consists of several cultural quarters, the oldest of which is known as Viking Triangle. This is the part of the city surrounded by the original tenth-century fortifications and is triangular in shape, with its apex at Reginald&#x27;s Tower. Though once the site of a thriving Viking settlement, the city centre subsequently shifted to the west, and it is now a quieter area with narrow streets, medieval architecture, and civic spaces.

In the 15th century, the city was enlarged with the building of an outer wall on the west side. Today Waterford retains more of its city walls than any other city in Ireland with the exception of Derry, whose walls were built much later. Tours of Waterford&#x27;s city walls are conducted daily.

The Quay, once termed by historian Mark Girouard as &#x27;the noblest quay in Europe&#x27;, is a mile long from Grattan Quay to Adelphi Quay, though Adelphi Quay is now a residential area. Near Reginald&#x27;s Tower is the William Vincent Wallace Plaza, a monument and amenity built around the time of the millennium that commemorates the Waterford-born composer.

John Roberts Square is a pedestrianised area that is one of the focal points of Waterford&#x27;s modern-day commercial centre. It was named after the Waterford architect, John Roberts, and was formed from the junction of Barronstrand Street, Broad Street and George&#x27;s Street. It is often referred to locally as Red Square, due to the red paving that was used when the area was first pedestrianised. A short distance to the east of John Roberts Square is Arundel Square, which the City Square shopping centre opens onto.

Ballybricken, in the west, just outside the city walls, is thought to have been Waterford&#x27;s Irishtown, a type of settlement that often formed outside Irish cities to house the Vikings and Irish that had been expelled during the Norman invasion of Ireland. Modern street names in the area reflect the fact that the area was where inhabitants of the medieval city practised archery. Ballybricken is an inner-city neighbourhood centred around Ballybricken hill, which was a large, open market-square. Today it has been converted into a green, civic space, but the Bull Post, where livestock was once bought and sold, still stands as a remnant of the hill&#x27;s past.

The Mall is a Georgian thoroughfare, built by the Wide Streets Commission to extend the city southwards. It contains some of the city&#x27;s finest Georgian architecture. The People&#x27;s Park, Waterford&#x27;s largest park, is located nearby.

Once a historic market area, the city&#x27;s Apple Market district is known for its nightlife culture and includes a number of bars, restaurants and nightclubs. Investment in the mid-2010s saw a portion of the area pedestrianised and the installation of a large outdoor roofing section.

Ferrybank, in County Waterford, is Waterford&#x27;s only suburb north of the river. It contains a village centre of its own.

In April 2003, a site combining a fifth-century Iron Age and ninth-century Viking settlement was discovered at Woodstown near the city, which appears to have been a Viking town that predates all such settlements in Ireland.

Waterford is known for Waterford Crystal, a legacy of the city&#x27;s former glass-making industry. Glass, or crystal, was manufactured in the city from 1783 until early 2009 when the factory there was shut down after the receivership of Waterford Wedgwood plc. A new Waterford Crystal visitor centre in the Viking Quarter, under new owners, opened in June 2010, after the intervention of Waterford City Council and Waterford Chamber of Commerce, and resumed production.

Waterford&#x27;s oldest public house (pub) is located outside the old &#x27;Viking Triangle&#x27;. T &amp; H Doolan&#x27;s, of 31/32 George&#x27;s Street, has acted as a licensed premises since the 18th century but the premises is believed to be closer to five hundred years in age. The pub&#x27;s structure includes one of the original city walls, almost 1,000 years old, which can be viewed in the lounge area of the building.
==Economy==
Waterford is the main city of Ireland&#x27;s South-East Region. Historically Waterford was an important trading port which brought much prosperity to the city throughout the city&#x27;s eventful history. Throughout its history, Waterford Crystal provided employment to thousands in the city and surrounding areas.

Waterford Port is Ireland&#x27;s closest deep-water port to mainland Europe, handling approximately 12% of Ireland&#x27;s external trade by value. Waterford&#x27;s most famous export, Waterford Crystal, was manufactured in the city from 1783 to 1851, 1947 to 2009 and again from 2010 to the present day. Places, where Waterford Crystal can be seen, include New York City, where Waterford Crystal made the 2,668 crystals for the New Year&#x27;s Eve Ball that is dropped each year in Times Square; Westminster Abbey; Windsor Castle; and the Kennedy Center (Washington, DC).

Agriculture played an important part in Waterford&#x27;s economic history. Kilmeadan, about 5 km from the city, was home to a very successful co-operative. The farmers of the area benefited from the sale of their produce (mostly butter and milk) to the co-op. In 1964, all of the co-ops in Waterford amalgamated to become Waterford Co-op. This led to the construction of a cheese factory on a greenfield site opposite the general store, and Kilmeadan cheese was to become one of the most recognised and successful Cheddar brands in the world, winning gold and bronze medals in the World Cheese Awards in London in 2005.

The Irish economic recession from 2008 onwards has had a major negative impact on Waterford&#x27;s economy. A number of multinational companies have closed, including Waterford Crystal (which subsequently reopened) and Talk Talk, which has led to a high level of unemployment. Until 2013 the hedge fund office of the Citibank resided here.

Waterford Co-op and Avonmore Co-op have merged to form Glanbia plc.

==Transport==
The M9 motorway, which was completed on 9 September 2010, connects the city to Dublin. The N24 road connects the city to Limerick city. The N25 road connects the city to Cork city.

A freight yard is located at the Dublin/Limerick end of the station, served by freight traffic such as cargo freight and timber which travel to and from Dublin Port and . In November 2016 it was revealed the Waterford could lose its connection to Limerick Junction by 2018 with the closure of the Limerick Junction Waterford line by CIE/IE to save money as the line is low demand. On 29 May 2018 the contract held by DFDS for a freight service from Ballina to Belview Port expired and was not renewed. In 2021 a new Ballina to Waterford (Belview) by Iarnród Éireann and XPO Logistics, (this is in addition to the wood pulp service from Ballina and Westport).

Bus Éireann, JJ Kavanagh and Sons, Dublin Coach, and Wexford Bus provide bus services around the city centre and to other towns and cities in Ireland. A daily coach service to England via South Wales and terminating at Victoria Coach Station, London is operated by Eurolines. All regional bus services depart from Waterford Bus Station on the quay, and city centre services run throughout the city. Planning for bus lanes in the city centre are at an early stage and bus lanes will be on Parnell Street, Manor Street, The Mall, and the South Quays. A bus lane will be in each direction. On street parking will be removed from Parnell Street to facilitate the lanes. This is part of the city centre green plan.

The Waterford Greenway is Ireland&#x27;s longest greenway, and connects the city with Mount Congreve, Kilmeaden, Kilmacthomas, and Dungarvan.

Waterford Airport is located 9 km outside the city centre.

<doc id="92667" wikidata="Q2745502" url="?curid=92667" title="Kinich Ahau">
<text>Kinich Ahau (Mayan: ) is the 16th-century Yucatec name of the Maya sun god, designated as God G when referring to the codices. In the Classic period, God G is depicted as a middle-aged man with an aquiline nose, large square eyes, cross-eyed, and a filed incisor in the upper row of teeth. Usually, there is a &quot;k&#x27;in&quot; (&#x27;sun&#x27;)-infix, sometimes in the very eyes. Among the southern Lacandons, Kinich Ahau continued to play a role in narrative well into the second half of the twentieth century.

== Names ==
Kinich Ahau is the Yucatec and Lacandon name of the sun god. The element &quot;kʼinich&quot;, usually assumed to mean &#x27;sun-eyed&#x27;, appears to have been in general use as a royal title during the Classic Period. Kinich Ahau should not be confused with Ah Kʼin or Ah Kʼin Chob. &quot;Ah Kʼin&quot; is Yucatec for &#x27;someone who deals with the day(s)&#x27;, the word for &#x27;day&#x27; and &#x27;sun&#x27; being the same. The term refers to Yucatec calendar priests and to priests in general. As to &quot;Ah Kʼin&quot; Chob, J.E.S. Thompson suggested that this Lacandon deity name (alternating with Can Chob and Chi Chac Chob) could refer to the sun deity, but the mythology of Ah Kʼin Chob does not bear this out. Although the element &quot;chob&quot; has been translated as &#x27;squint-eyed&#x27;, which is an iconographic feature of the Classic sun deity, the only source for this translation is a single statement by Tozzer.

== 16th-century Yucatan ==
Kinich Ahau was the patron of one of the four years of the 52-year cycle (Landa). In the rituals introducing this year, war dances were executed. Kinich Ahau was apparently considered an aspect of the upper god, Itzamna. He may conceivably be related to the patron deity of Izamal, Kinich Kakmo &#x27;Fire Parrot&#x27;, who was reported to descend to earth while the sun was standing in the zenith in order to consume offerings (Cogolludo).

== Classic period ==
God G&#x27;s appearances in Classic Maya art are, perhaps, best known from large stucco masks adorning pyramids. Compared to the deities connected to agricultural fertility, however, God G occurs rather infrequently in other media than stucco, and is rarely part of narrative events. It may be noted that the Hero Twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque, although stated to have changed into Sun and Moon, are never shown assimilated to God G.

=== Land of the Sunrise: Eastern Paradise ===
The Sun God is associated with an aquatic eastern paradise, where he can assume the shape of a chimerical water bird, or be shown as a young man, paddling a canoe. Such imagery could suggest lyric religious poetry comparable to the Aztec evocations of a &#x27;flower paradise&#x27; (Taube).

=== Ancestral solar kings ===
The sun deity can be shown as a king (&quot;ajaw&quot;) seated high on a throne cushion (as on the famous, narrative &#x27;Rabbit Vase&#x27; from Naranjo), or as a ruler carrying the bicephalic &#x27;ceremonial bar&#x27;. Inversely, the Maya king is repeatedly assimilated to the sun deity. The emblematic double-bird of the early Copan king, Yax Kʼukʼ Moʼ &#x27;Great Quetzal-Parrot&#x27;, shows the head of the sun deity within its beaks. Ancestral Maya kings assimilated to the sun deity were sometimes depicted while vertically descending from the zenith (as on Takalik Abaj stela 2 and Tikal stela 31). Particularly in Yaxchilan, the ancestral king is seated within a solar cartouche, his wife in a lunar crescent. The solar aspect of a king often seems to imply apotheosis and life after death.

=== Calendar ===
Hieroglyphically, the sun god is the patron of the day-unit (&quot;kʼin&quot; &#x27;day, sun&#x27;), the month of Yaxkʼin &#x27;dry season&#x27;, and the number Four (in parallel with the day Ahau).

=== Connections with other deities ===
Several other deities evince a large eye, such as God D (Itzamna), Chaak (his brother), and various jaguar gods. Attribute sharing (including the &quot;kʼin&quot; infix) occurs chiefly with the so-called Jaguar God of the Underworld and a human-faced ocean deity with shell ears, fins beside the mouth, and a sacrificial awl set in the mouth. The &#x27;Jaguar God of the Underworld&#x27; is traditionally referred to by scholars as the &#x27;Night Sun&#x27;, i.e., the form supposedly taken by the sun during his subterranean journey from West to East. It has been suggested that the three just-mentioned deities involved in the sharing of attributes could, perhaps, represent various stages of the sun&#x27;s daily cycle.

== Mythology and ritual==
Recent Maya mythology is mainly concerned with Sun&#x27;s childhood and the conflicts leading up to his actual solar transformation. Although specific imagery is used for the path of the sun (for example, the sun being carried through the underworld on the shoulders of its lord), there are hardly any histories concerning the mature sun deity, save for the southern Lacandons. According to them, Kinich Ahau, the elder brother of the upper god, will put an end to this world by descending from the sky and have his jaguars devour mankind. Little is also known about specific solar rituals, although Kinich Ahau regularly occurs in the Dresden Codex, which is largely concerned with ritual matters.

<text>Yum Kaax (Mayan pronunciation: [jum kʼaːʃ], &quot;Lord of the forest&quot;), also known as Yumká is a Yukatek Maya name for the god of the wild vegetation and guardian of its animals.

In the past, this god has wrongly been described as an agricultural deity or even as the Maya maize god (god E of the codices), which has become a popular and still existing misconception. In ethnographic reality, Yum Kaax is a god of wild plants and of animals that are important to hunters. As such, he grants protection of the fields against the incursions of the wild nature he himself represents. This type of deity is also found among indigenous peoples of North America. Invoked by hunters, he is the owner of all the game. He can appear to hunters in an instant and possesses songs that will warrant a hunter success and allow his arrows to come back to him.

== Role in Maya culture ==
Pre-Columbian contact, Yum Kaax was considered one of the most important deities in the Maya pantheon and was used to help those who hunted for their food. Tradition farmers would invoke his name and present him with the first fruits of their fields, carved out from the forest, so that wild animals and vegetation would not destroy their fields. Hunters far out in the wilderness would sometimes take off their shirt, spread it over four stakes in the ground, and then crawl underneath to try and find deer. This is a ritual to Yum Kaax so that deer become easier to find.

== Maya beliefs from Yum Kaax ==
Maya sorcerers have learned many secrets from Yum Kaax and these would be used to help one get better results while hunting. Some of the advice given was: When you go hunting, you must first offer Yum Kaax 5 jars of Balché or nine of chocozacan. To find game, create a candle of Copal and follow the flicker of the flame. To select your own private hunting ground, kill a deer and cut off its head and then drag the head around the hunting ground and bury the head with its liver – the area that you have dragged the head over will become your own private hunting ground.

<doc id="92679" wikidata="Q23095" url="?curid=92679" title="South Yorkshire">
<text>South Yorkshire is a ceremonial county in the Yorkshire and the Humber region of England. It borders North Yorkshire and West Yorkshire to the north, the East Riding of Yorkshire to the north-east, Lincolnshire to the east, Nottinghamshire to the south-east, and Derbyshire to the south and west. The largest settlement is the city of Sheffield.

The county is largely urban, with an area of and a population of 1,402,918. The largest settlements after Sheffield (556,500) are the city of Doncaster (113,566), Rotherham (109,697), and Barnsley (96,888). The east and west of the county are more rural. The county is governed by four metropolitan boroughs: Barnsley, City of Doncaster, Rotherham, and City of Sheffield. They collaborate through South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority.

South Yorkshire lies on the edge of the Pennines, and the west of the county contains part of the Peak District National Park. The River Don rises in these hills, and flows through Sheffield, Rotherham, and Doncaster before reaching the flat Humberhead Levels in the east of the county.

==History==
While the county of South Yorkshire was created in 1974, the history of its constituent settlements and parts goes back centuries. Prehistoric remains include a Mesolithic &quot;house&quot; (a circle of stones in the shape of a hut-base) dating to around 8000 BC, found at Deepcar, in the northern part of Sheffield. Evidence of even earlier inhabitation in the wider region exists about over the county boundary at Creswell Crags in Derbyshire, where artefacts and rock art found in caves have been dated by archaeologists to the late Upper Palaeolithic period, at least 12,800 years ago. The region was on the frontier of the Roman Empire during the Roman period.

The main settlements of South Yorkshire grew up around the industries of mining and steel manufacturing. The main mining industry was coal which was concentrated to the north and east of the county. There were also iron deposits which were mined in the area. The rivers running off the Pennines to the west of the county supported the steel industry that is concentrated in Sheffield, Stocksbridge and Rotherham. The proximity of the iron and coal also made this an ideal place for steel manufacture.

Although Christian nonconformism was never as strong in South Yorkshire as in the mill towns of West Yorkshire, there are still many Methodist and Baptist churches in the area. Also, South Yorkshire has a relatively high number of followers of spiritualism. It is the only county that counts as a full region in the Spiritualists&#x27; National Union.

===Redcliffe-Maud Report===
The Local Government Commission for England presented draft recommendations, in December 1965, proposing a new county—York and North Midlands—roughly centred on the southern part of the West Riding of Yorkshire and northern parts of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. The review was abolished in favour of the Royal Commission on Local Government before it was able to issue a final report.

The Royal Commission&#x27;s 1969 report, known as the Redcliffe-Maud Report, proposed the removal of much of the then existing system of local government. The commission described the system of administering urban and rural districts separately as outdated, noting that urban areas provided employment and services for rural dwellers, and open countryside was used by town dwellers for recreation.

Redcliffe-Maud&#x27;s recommendations were accepted by the Labour government in February 1970. Although the Redcliffe-Maud Report was rejected by the Conservative government after the 1970 general election, there was a commitment to local government reform, and the idea of a metropolitan county of South Yorkshire.

===After 1974===
The Local Government Act 1972 reformed local government in England by creating a system of two-tier metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties and districts throughout the country. The act formally established South Yorkshire on 1 April 1974, although South Yorkshire County Council (SYCC) had been running since elections in 1973. The leading article in &quot;The Times&quot; on the day the Local Government Act came into effect noted that the &quot;new arrangement is a compromise which seeks to reconcile familiar geography which commands a certain amount of affection and loyalty, with the scale of operations on which modern planning methods can work effectively&quot;.

South Yorkshire initially had a two tier structure of local government with a strategic-level county council and four districts providing most services.

In 1974, as part of the &quot;South Yorkshire Structure Plan&quot; of the environment, conservation and land use, South Yorkshire County Council commissioned a public attitudes survey covering job opportunities, educational facilities, leisure opportunities, health and medical services, shopping centres and transport in the county.

In 1986, throughout England the metropolitan county councils were abolished. The functions of the county council were devolved to the boroughs; joint-boards covering fire, police and public transport; and to other special joint arrangements. The joint boards continue to function and include the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive. The South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner also oversees South Yorkshire Police.

Although the county council was abolished, South Yorkshire remains a metropolitan and ceremonial county with a Lord Lieutenant of South Yorkshire and a High Sheriff.

South Yorkshire lies within the Sheffield City Region with Barnsley also being within the Leeds City Region, reflecting its geographical position midway between Yorkshire&#x27;s two largest cities.

==Geography==
The metropolitan county borders Derbyshire, West Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire. The terrain of the county is mostly distinguished by the Pennines and its foothills which rise in the west of the county and gradually descend into the Humberhead Levels in the east of the county. Geologically, the county lies largely on the carboniferous rocks of the Yorkshire coalfield in the outer Pennine fringes, producing a rolling landscape with hills, escarpments and broad valleys. In this landscape, there is widespread evidence of both current and former industrial activity. There are numerous mine buildings, former spoil heaps and iron and steel plants. The scenery is a mixture of built up areas, industrial land with some dereliction, and farmed open country. Ribbon developments along transport routes including canal, road and rail are prominent features of the area although some remnants of the pre industrial landscape and semi-natural vegetation still survive.

The Pennines in the west of the county are mostly inside the Peak District National Park and also contain carboniferous rocks, with the underlying geology primarily being millstone grit sandstones of the Dark Peak rising from the Yorkshire coalfield and the terrain is mostly moorland plateaus and gritstone edges. The inner Pennine fringes between the Dark Peak and Yorkshire coalfield are distinguished by many steep valleys, and a transition from uplands and rural landscape to lowlands and urban landscape towards the east of the county. Major rivers which cross the area are the Dearne, Rother and Don. To the east, in the Doncaster area the landscape becomes flatter as the eastward dipping carboniferous rocks of the coalfield are overlain by the lacustrine deposits of the Humberhead Levels.

===Green belt===
South Yorkshire contains green belt throughout the county, surrounding its four districts to large extents. It was first drawn up from the 1950s. The western edge of the Sheffield and Barnsley districts directly form with the boundary of the Peak District National Park.

==Settlements==

The table below outlines many of the county&#x27;s settlements, and is formatted according to their metropolitan borough.

Of these settlements above, South Yorkshire has three main urban areas: the Dearne Valley which covers Barnsley and surrounding area; the Sheffield urban area which covers Sheffield, Rotherham and surrounding area; and the Doncaster urban area which covers Doncaster and surrounding area.

==Governance==


The South Yorkshire County Council was abolished and its districts effectively became unitary authorities; they are the City of Sheffield, the City of Doncaster, the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley and the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham.

In 1986, throughout England the metropolitan county councils were abolished. The ceremonial county with a Lord Lieutenant of South Yorkshire and a High Sheriff was retained. The county remains defined as metropolitan, functions of the county council devolved to the boroughs with many functions administered by joint authorities (such a passenger transport executive) containing representatives of the four councils.

The South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority was established in 2014 to bring the leaders of the four councils to give the county a main statutory body. It is led by the directly elected Mayor of South Yorkshire.

In the 2016 referendum on the United Kingdom&#x27;s membership of the European Union, South Yorkshire voted 62% leave and 38% remain, making it one of the most heavily Leave areas in the country.

== Demography ==
==Economy==
As one of the least prosperous areas in Western Europe, South Yorkshire has been targeted for funding from the European Regional Development Fund. This is a chart of trend of regional gross value added of South Yorkshire at current basic prices with figures in millions of British Pounds Sterling.

However, the county has experienced a recent growth in the services sector. In the FDI European Cities and Regions of the Future 2022/23 Awards, Doncaster was ranked the best small city in Europe for investment.

<text>Anatomy of a Murder is a 1959 American legal drama film produced and directed by Otto Preminger. The screenplay by Wendell Mayes was based on the 1958 novel of the same name written by Michigan Supreme Court Justice John D. Voelker under the pen name of Robert Traver. Voelker based the novel on a 1952 murder case in which he was the defense attorney.

The film stars James Stewart, Lee Remick, Ben Gazzara, Eve Arden, George C. Scott, Arthur O&#x27;Connell, Kathryn Grant, Brooks West (Arden&#x27;s husband), Orson Bean, and Murray Hamilton. The judge was played by Joseph N. Welch, a real-life lawyer famous for dressing down Joseph McCarthy during the Army–McCarthy hearings. It has a musical score by Duke Ellington, who also appears in the film. It has been described by Michael Asimow, UCLA law professor and co-author of &quot;Reel Justice: The Courtroom Goes to the Movies&quot; (2006), as &quot;probably the finest pure trial movie ever made&quot;.

In 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, small-town lawyer Paul Biegler, a former district attorney who lost his re-election bid, spends most of his time fishing, playing the piano, and hanging out with his alcoholic friend and colleague Parnell McCarthy and sardonic secretary Maida Rutledge.

One day, Biegler is contacted by Laura Manion to defend her husband, US Army Lieutenant Frederick &quot;Manny&quot; Manion, who has been arrested for the murder of innkeeper Bernard &quot;Barney&quot; Quill. Manion does not deny the murder, but claims that Quill raped his wife. Even with such a motivation, getting Manion cleared of murder would be difficult, but Manion claims to have no memory of the event, which suggests he may be eligible for a defense of irresistible impulse—a version of a temporary insanity defense. It is strongly implied that Manion is faking insanity, having been guided to it as a potential defense by Biegler. Biegler&#x27;s folksy speech and laid-back demeanor hide a sharp legal mind and a propensity for courtroom theatrics that keeps the judge busy maintaining control. However, the case for the defense does not go well, especially as local district attorney Mitch Lodwick is assisted by high-powered prosecutor Claude Dancer from the Attorney General&#x27;s office.

Furthermore, the prosecution tries at every instance to block any mention of Manion&#x27;s motive for killing Quill. Biegler eventually manages to get the rape of Laura Manion into the record and Judge Weaver agrees to allow the matter to be part of the deliberations. During cross-examination, Dancer insinuates that Laura openly flirted with other men, including the man she claimed raped her. Psychiatrists give conflicting testimony to Manion&#x27;s state of mind at the time that he killed Quill. Dancer says that Manion may have suspected Laura of cheating on him because he asked her, a Catholic, to swear on a rosary that Quill raped her. This raises doubt as to whether the act was consensual.

Quill&#x27;s estate is to be inherited by Mary Pilant, whom Dancer accused of being Quill&#x27;s mistress. McCarthy learns that Pilant is in fact Quill&#x27;s daughter, a fact she is anxious to keep secret since she was born out of wedlock. Biegler, who is losing the case, tries to persuade Pilant that Al Paquette, the bartender who witnessed the murder, may know if Quill admitted to raping Laura but Paquette is covering this up, either because he loves Pilant or out of loyalty to Quill. Through Pilant, Biegler is unable to get Paquette to testify on behalf of Manion.

During the trial, Laura claims that Quill tore off her underwear while raping her; the underwear was not found where she alleged the rape took place. Pilant, previously unaware of any details of the case, hears this during the trial and then tells Biegler and later testifies that she found the panties in the inn&#x27;s laundry room the morning after the alleged rape. Biegler suggests Quill may have attempted to avoid suspicion by dropping the panties down the laundry chute located next to his room. Dancer tries to establish that Pilant&#x27;s answers are founded on her jealousy. When Dancer asserts forcibly that Quill was Pilant&#x27;s lover and that Pilant lied to cover this fact, Pilant shocks everyone by stating that Quill was her father. Manion is found not guilty by reason of insanity. After the trial, Biegler decides to open a new practice, with a newly sober McCarthy as his partner.

The next day, Biegler and McCarthy travel to the Manions&#x27; trailer park home to get Manion&#x27;s signature on a promissory note which they hope will suffice as collateral for a desperately needed loan. It turns out the Manions have vacated the trailer park, the superintendent commenting that Laura Manion had been crying. Manion left a note for Biegler, indicating that his flight was &quot;an irresistible impulse&quot;, the same justification Biegler used during the trial. Biegler states that Mary Pilant has retained him to execute Quill&#x27;s estate; McCarthy says that working for her will be &quot;poetic justice&quot;.

==Inspiration==
On July 31, 1952, Lt. Coleman A. Peterson shot and killed Maurice Chenoweth at a tavern in Big Bay, Michigan. Voelker was retained as defense attorney a few days later. Peterson&#x27;s wife Charlotte had claimed Chenoweth raped and beat her.

The trial started on September 15, 1952, and Assistant Attorney General Irving Beattie assisted Marquette County Prosecuting Attorney Edward Thomas. Voelker used a rare version of the insanity defense called irresistible impulse that had not been used in Michigan since 1886. The jury deliberated for four hours on September 23, 1952, before returning a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. Two days later, after Peterson was examined by a psychiatrist who judged him sane, he was released.

Peterson and his wife were divorced soon after the trial. Hillsdale Circuit Court Judge Charles O. Arch, Sr. tried the case because of the illness of a local judge.

==Production==

Independently made, the film was shot in several locations in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (Big Bay, Marquette, Ishpeming, and Michigamme). Some scenes were filmed in the Thunder Bay Inn in Big Bay, one block from the Lumberjack Tavern, the site of the 1952 murder that inspired much of the novel. The scene of the train was captured at the Ishpeming train station with the arrival of the daily &quot;Peninsula 400&quot;.

The film was previewed on June 18, 1959, in Chicago, which &quot;Variety&quot; said was 21 days after filming had finished and a record for a big-budget film. It had its first screening at the Butler Theater in Ishpeming and the Nordic Theater in Marquette on June 29, 1959. The world premiere for the film was held on July 1, 1959, at the United Artists Theater in Detroit.

==Legal aspects==

The film examines the apparent fallibility of the human factor in jurisprudence. In various ways all of the human components—the counsel for defense and prosecution, the defendant and his wife, and the witnesses—have their own differing positions on what is right or wrong, and varying perspectives on integrity, justice, morality and ethics. The reliance on credibility of witnesses, and the &quot;finding of facts&quot; based upon those determinations, is the &quot;Achilles heel&quot; of the judicial process.

One controversial legal issue in this film is possible witness coaching, a violation of legal canons. The only plausible legal defense Lt. Manion has—the insanity defense—is virtually spelled out to a befuddled Manion by his prospective counsel, who then temporarily suspends the conversation and suggests that Manion rethink his factual/legal position. Witness coaching by the prosecution is even more blatant as they call in other jail inmates awaiting sentencing to testify against Manion, which is portrayed as subornation of perjury to an extent. The first suggests that the defendant may be concealing the truth and manipulating his story in order to obtain the best possible verdict, and the latter that the prosecution dangled a possible lighter sentence through plea bargain as an incentive to perjury.

==Reception and legacy==

The language used during the film startled Chicago, Illinois Mayor Richard J. Daley, and his police commissioner. As a result, the film was temporarily banned in the heavily Catholic city. Preminger filed a motion in federal court in Illinois and the mayor&#x27;s decision was overturned. The film was allowed to be exhibited after the court determined that the clinical language during the trial was realistic and appropriate within the film&#x27;s context. &quot;Variety&quot; claimed that the film contained words never before heard in American films with the Motion Picture Production Code seal such as &quot;contraceptive&quot;, (sexual) &quot;climax&quot; and &quot;spermatogenesis&quot;.

In another federal lawsuit in Chicago, the daughter of the real-life murder victim from the 1952 case sued Dell Publishing and Columbia Pictures in July 1960 for libel over accusations that the book and movie &quot;followed [the actual trial] too closely&quot; and portrayed the two women in an unflattering light; the suit was dismissed less than a year later in May 1961.

&quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; has been well received by members of the legal and educational professions. In 1989, the American Bar Association rated this as one of the 12 best trial films of all time. In addition to its plot and musical score, the article noted: &quot;The film&#x27;s real highlight is its ability to demonstrate how a legal defense is developed in a difficult case. How many trial films would dare spend so much time watching lawyers do what many lawyers do most (and enjoy least) research?&quot; The film has also been used as a teaching tool in law schools, as it encompasses (from the defense standpoint) all of the basic stages in the U.S. criminal justice system from client interview and arraignment through trial. The film was listed as 4 of 25 &quot;Greatest Legal Movies&quot; by the American Bar Association.

The film grossed an estimated $11 million generating $5.5 million in theatrical rentals in the U.S. and Canada. It earned rentals of $8 million worldwide.

Film critics have noted the moral ambiguity, where a small town lawyer triumphs by guile, stealth and trickery. The film is frank and direct. Language and sexual themes are explicit, at variance with the times (and other films) when it was produced. The black and white palette is seen as a complement to Michigan&#x27;s harsh Upper Peninsula landscape. The film is &quot;made in black-and-white but full of local color&quot;.

Bosley Crowther, film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;After watching an endless succession of courtroom melodramas that have more or less transgressed the bounds of human reason and the rules of advocacy, it is cheering and fascinating to see one that hews magnificently to a line of dramatic but reasonable behavior and proper procedure in a court. Such a one is &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot;, which opened at the Criterion and the Plaza yesterday. It is the best courtroom melodrama this old judge has ever seen... . Outside of the fact that this drama gets a little tiring in spots—in its two hours and forty minutes, most of which is spent in court—it is well nigh flawless as a picture of an American court at work, of small-town American characters and of the average sordidness of crime.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; felt that it was well-paced, well-acted, and that the explicit language was warranted within the film&#x27;s context.

In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10, the best 10 films in 10 &quot;classic&quot; American film genres, after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; was selected as the seventh best film in the courtroom drama genre.

Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 100% of 50 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 8.70/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states, &quot;One of cinema&#x27;s greatest courtroom dramas, &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; is tense, thought-provoking, and brilliantly acted, with great performances from James Stewart and George C. Scott.&quot;

&quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; was one of 25 films added to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 2012.

==Soundtrack==

The jazz score of &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; was composed by Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn and played by Ellington&#x27;s orchestra. Several of Ellington band&#x27;s sidemen, including Jimmy Hamilton, Jimmy Johnson, Ray Nance, and Jimmy Woode appear, and Ellington himself plays the character Pie Eye.

Mervyn Cooke, in the &quot;History of Film Music&quot;, asserts that despite being heard &quot;in bits and pieces&quot; the score &quot;contains some of his most evocative and eloquent music... and beckons with the alluring scent of a femme fatale.&quot; Including small pieces by Billy Strayhorn, film historians recognize it &quot;as a landmark the first significant Hollywood film music by African Americans comprising non-diegetic music, that is, music whose source is not visible or implied by action in the film, like an on-screen band.&quot; The score avoids cultural stereotypes which previously characterized jazz scores and &quot;rejected a strict adherence to visuals in ways that presaged the New Wave cinema of the &#x27;60s.&quot;

The soundtrack album, containing 13 tracks, was released by Columbia Records on May 29, 1959. A CD was released on April 28, 1995, and reissued by Sony in a deluxe edition in 1999.

===Reception===
&quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; music critic Mark Stryker concluded: &quot;Though indispensable, I think the score is too sketchy to rank in the top echelon among Ellington-Strayhorn masterpiece suites like &quot;Such Sweet Thunder&quot; and &quot;The Far East Suite&quot;, but its most inspired moments are their equal.&quot; 

The AllMusic review by Bruce Eder awarded the album 3 stars and called it &quot;a virtuoso jazz score—moody, witty, sexy, and—in its own quiet way playful&quot;.

Ellington&#x27;s score won three Grammy Awards in 1959: Best Performance by a Dance Band, Best New Musical Composition, and Best Soundtrack Album.

==Stage adaptation==
After Traver&#x27;s novel was published, St. Martin&#x27;s Press planned to have it adapted for the stage, intending a Broadway production, which would then be made into a film. Before he died in December 1957, John Van Druten wrote a rough draft of the play adaptation. Some time after that, the publisher then made the film rights available, and these were purchased by Otto Preminger.

Eventually, Traver&#x27;s book was adapted for the stage in 1963 by Elihu Winer. It premiered at the Mill Run Theater in suburban Chicago, and was published in 1964 by Samuel French.

==References in media and popular culture==
On June 29, 2009, journalist and filmmaker John Pepin debuted &quot;Anatomy &#x27;59: The Making of a Classic Motion Picture&quot; on public television stations across the state of Michigan. The anchor station for those broadcasts was WNMU-TV in Marquette, Michigan. The documentary reviews the original incident that spawned the bestselling book &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; by Robert Traver and the making of Otto Preminger&#x27;s motion picture. Pepin&#x27;s documentary debuted on the 50th anniversary of the world premiere of &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; in Ishpeming and Marquette, Michigan; the date was also the birthday of John Voelker. Pepin grew up on Barnum Street in Ishpeming, the same street where Voelker lived and where the Mather Inn was located, which is where the stars of Preminger&#x27;s film stayed during production. &quot;Anatomy &#x27;59&quot; features interviews with &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; actors still alive in 2009, including Ben Gazzara, Kathryn Grant-Crosby, Orson Bean and Don Ross.

<text>The Nun&#x27;s Story is a 1956 novel by Kathryn Hulme. It was a Book of the Month selection and reached #1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

== Premise ==
The lead character of the book, Sister Luke (pre-convent name Gabrielle Van Der Mal), finds her faith tested in Africa where she finds herself at odds with headstrong Dr. Fortunati, operator of a remote hospital in the Belgian Congo, with whom she gradually builds respect, and again during World War II, when she is ordered not to take sides. Ultimately, Sister Luke is forced to decide whether to remain in the convent or return to the outside world.

Gabrielle/Sister Luke is stretched between her desire to be faithful to the rule of her congregation and her desire to be a nurse. As a nun, she must remove all vestiges of &quot;Gabrielle Van Der Mal&quot; and sublimate herself into the devoted bride of Christ. As a nun, there is no room for her personal desires and aspirations. Ultimately, the conflict between her devotion to the Church and the nursing profession, juxtaposed with her passionate Belgian patriotism and her love of her father (killed by Nazi fighter planes while treating wounded) bring her to an impasse, which serves as the dénouement of the novel.

== Development ==
Hulme wrote the book based partly upon the experiences of her friend, Marie Louise Habets of the Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary, a Belgian nurse and an ex-nun whom she met while working with refugees in post-war Europe. The author sponsored the former nun&#x27;s emigration to the United States, and later converted to Catholicism. It often is stated erroneously that the book was based upon Hulme&#x27;s experiences.

==Film adaptation==
In 1959, the book was adapted into a film by screenwriter Robert Anderson and director Fred Zinnemann. &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot; starred Audrey Hepburn as Sister Luke. It was a critical and box-office success, and was nominated for eight oscars at the 32nd Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Hepburn&#x27;s third nomination for Best Actress.

Hepburn met Marie-Louise Habets while preparing for the role, and Habets later helped nurse Hepburn back to health following her near-fatal horse-riding accident on the set of the 1960 film &quot;The Unforgiven.&quot; The relationship among Hulme, Habets and Hepburn is explored in Zoe Fairbairns&#x27; radio play &quot;The Belgian Nurse&quot;, first broadcast on BBC Radio Four in January 2007.

<doc id="92688" wikidata="Q617997" url="?curid=92688" title="Room at the Top (1959 film)">
<text>Room at the Top is a 1959 British drama film based on the 1957 novel by John Braine. It was adapted by Neil Paterson (with uncredited work by Mordecai Richler), directed by Jack Clayton (his feature-length debut), and produced by John and James Woolf. The film stars Laurence Harvey, Simone Signoret, Heather Sears, Donald Wolfit, Donald Houston, and Hermione Baddeley.

The film was widely lauded, and it was nominated for six Academy Awards, winning two: Best Actress (Signoret) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Paterson). Its other nominations at the 32nd Academy Awards were for Best Picture, Best Director (Clayton), Best Actor (Harvey), and Best Supporting Actress (Baddeley). Baddeley&#x27;s performance, consisting of 2 minutes and 19 seconds of screen time, is the shortest ever to be nominated for an acting Oscar.

==Plot==
Soon after the Second World War, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, Joe Lampton, an ambitious young man, moves from his hometown, the dreary factory town of Dufton, to the somewhat larger town of Warnley to assume a secure but poorly paid and dead-end post in the Borough Treasurer&#x27;s Department. Determined to get ahead, and ignoring the warnings of his colleague and flatmate Charlie Soames, he pursues Susan Brown, the daughter of a local industrial magnate. She has been dating wealthy Jack Wales but Joe is able to charm her. Mr and Mrs Brown attempt to frustrate Joe&#x27;s social climbing by persuading Joe&#x27;s boss to encourage him to pursue a woman of his own class; getting him a job offer back in Dufton, which he refuses when he discovers the machination; and sending Susan on a trip abroad, but Susan remains smitten.

While pursuing Susan, Joe continues to see Alice Aisgill, an unhappily married Frenchwoman ten years his senior who came to England as a teacher a decade earlier and married George Aisgill, a haughty and abusive upper-middle class Englishman who is now having numerous affairs. Joe thinks he is just killing time with Alice and Alice says they can just be &quot;loving friends&quot;. Their feelings for each other begin to turn into something more and Joe starts to lose interest in his pursuit of Susan. The relationship is passionate, tempestuous and after a particularly heated argument, Joe switches his focus back to Susan. He manages to take her virginity but is unsatisfied and finds himself drawn back to Alice.

Joe and Alice go away on a short holiday and Alice is overjoyed that Joe seems to have decided to end his quest for wealth and social status in favour of simply being happy with himself and with her. They decide she will ask for a divorce when she gets home but when she does, George refuses and declares he will ruin Joe and Alice, both socially and financially, if their relationship continues. While Joe is brooding over this, Mr Brown delivers the news that Susan is pregnant and that he expects Joe to stop seeing Alice and marry Susan, in which case Joe can come to work for him at a generous salary.

Seeing no way around his obstacles to a relationship with Alice, Joe tells her that he is going to marry Susan. Heartbroken, Alice gets drunk in a pub and the next morning, while his co-workers are celebrating his engagement, Joe hears that she drove her car off a cliff to which she and he used to go together and died slowly over the course of several hours. Devastated, Joe leaves the office and wanders to the flat where he and Alice had their trysts but Alice&#x27;s friend Elspeth, who owns the flat, drives him away by screaming at him and blaming him for Alice&#x27;s death.

Joe goes to a pub on the waterfront, where a woman named Mavis comes on to him because he is well-dressed. Although he is very drunk and does not seem very interested in her (he calls her Alice), Joe keeps a man from taking Mavis away against her will. When Joe is alone, the man and some of his friends beat Joe unconscious. In the morning, Charlie finds Joe lying in the street with a battered face but Joe&#x27;s only concern is his guilt over what he feels he led Alice to do.

A short time later, Joe and Susan get married. With a rich wife and high-paying job, he has got everything he thought he wanted. As they are driven away after the wedding, Susan&#x27;s effusive praise of the ceremony is cut short when she notices that there are tears in Joe&#x27;s eyes, which she misinterprets by saying &quot;I believe you really are sentimental after all&quot;.

==Adaptation==
There are some differences between Braine&#x27;s novel and the film. For one, Joe&#x27;s friend Charlie Soames is a friend from his hometown of Dufton in the novel, whereas, in the film, he meets Charlie in Warnley (which is called Warley in the book). Also, in the book, more is made of Joe&#x27;s lodging at the Thompsons&#x27;, which, in the novel, he arranged before his arrival in Warley (in the film, Charlie arranges it soon after they meet): it is through his association with the Thompsons that Joe is able to gain entry to a higher social circle than that to which he had previously had access, and Mrs Thompson&#x27;s room is noted as being at &quot;the top&quot; of Warley geographically, which serves as a metaphor for Joe&#x27;s social-climbing.

==Production==
Producer James Woolf bought the film rights to Braine&#x27;s novel, originally intending to cast Stewart Granger as Joe and Jean Simmons as Susan. Vivien Leigh was originally offered the part of Alice. Woolf hired Clayton as director after seeing &quot;The Bespoke Overcoat&quot;, an Academy Award-winning short film that was produced and distributed by companies founded by the Woolf brothers.

===Shooting===
For the production, in addition to filming on sets at Shepperton Studios in Surrey, there was extensive location-shooting in Halifax, Yorkshire, which stood in for the fictional towns of Warnley and Dufton. Greystones, a large mansion in the Savile Park area of Halifax, was used as the location for exterior scenes of the Brown family mansion; Halifax railway station doubled as Warnley Station in the film; and Halifax Town Hall was used as the Warnley Town Hall. The wedding was filmed at All Souls church, Boothtown, Halifax. Some scenes were also filmed in Bradford, notably the one in which Joe travels on a bus and spots Susan in a lingerie shop and those outside the amateur dramatics theatre.

Freddie Francis says John Woolf wanted to fire Francis during filming but Clayton refused.

==Reception==
The film was critically acclaimed. Reviewing the movie for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Abraham Weiler praised Braine&#x27;s novel, which he compared favourably to John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;, and noted the depth of Harvey&#x27;s, Signoret&#x27;s, and Sears&#x27;s portrayals, concluding that the movie &quot;may be basically cheerless and somber, but it has a strikingly effective view.&quot;

&quot;Room at the Top&quot; marked the beginning of Jack Clayton&#x27;s career as an important director. It was the third most popular film at the British box office in 1959 (after &quot;Carry On Nurse&quot; and &quot;Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot;), grossing $700,000.

&quot;Room at the Top&quot; is seen as the first of the British New Wave of kitchen-sink-realism film dramas. It was followed by a sequel in 1965 titled &quot;Life at the Top&quot;.

<text>is a 1984 Japanese animated post-apocalyptic fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, based on his 1982–94 manga series of the same name. It was produced by Topcraft and distributed by Toei Company. Joe Hisaishi, in his first collaboration with Miyazaki, composed the score. The film stars the voices of Sumi Shimamoto, Gorō Naya, Yōji Matsuda, Yoshiko Sakakibara, and Iemasa Kayumi. Set in a post-nuclear futuristic world, it tells the story of Nausicaä (Shimamoto), the pacifist teenage princess of the Valley of the Wind who becomes embroiled in a struggle with Tolmekia, an empire that attempts to use an ancient weapon to eradicate a jungle populated by oversized, mutant insects.

&quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; was released in Japan on 11 March 1984. The film received critical acclaim, with praise being directed at the story, themes, characters and animation. It is commonly regarded as one of the greatest animated films, and is the second-highest ranked Japanese anime in a survey published by Japan&#x27;s Agency for Cultural Affairs in 2007. Though it was made before Studio Ghibli was founded, it is often considered a Ghibli work, and is usually released as part of DVD and Blu-ray collections of Ghibli work.

A heavily edited version of the film created by Manson International, &quot;Warriors of the Wind&quot;, was released in the United States and other markets throughout the mid-to-late 1980s. The Manson cut was derided by Miyazaki, and led to Ghibli&#x27;s &quot;no cuts&quot; rule for future international releases. It was eventually replaced in circulation by an uncut, redubbed version produced by Walt Disney Pictures in 2005.

==Plot==

One thousand years have passed since the Seven Days of Fire, an apocalyptic war that destroyed civilization and caused an ecocide, creating the vast Toxic Jungle, a poisonous forest swarming with giant mutant insects. In the kingdom of the Valley of the Wind, a prophecy predicts a savior &quot;clothed in a blue robe, descending onto a golden field&quot;. The Valley&#x27;s princess Nausicaä explores the jungle and communicates with its creatures, including the gigantic, trilobite-like armored Ohm. She hopes to understand the jungle and find a way for it and humans to coexist.

One morning, a massive cargo aircraft from the militaristic Empire of Tolmekia crashes in the Valley despite Nausicaä&#x27;s efforts to save it. Its sole survivor, Princess Lastelle of Pejite, asks Nausicaä to destroy the cargo before she dies. The cargo is an embryo of a Giant Warrior, one of the lethal, gargantuan humanoid bioweapons that caused the Seven Days of Fire. Tolmekia seized the embryo and Lastelle from Pejite, but their plane was unable to support the embryo&#x27;s weight and landed in the forest, causing the insects to attack. One of the insects emerges wounded from the wreckage and poises to attack, but Nausicaä uses a bullroarer to calm it and guides it away from the village.

Soon after, Tolmekian soldiers under the command of Princess Kushana invade the Valley and kill Nausicaä&#x27;s father, Jihl. Nausicaä briefly fights the Tolmekians, but the Valley&#x27;s elderly swordsmaster, Yupa, intervenes and ushers both Nausicaä and the Tolmekians to stand down. Kushana, having retrieved the Giant Warrior&#x27;s embryo, plans to mature and use the bioweapon to burn the Toxic Jungle. The valley&#x27;s wise woman, Obaba, warns that such a feat cannot be done as many have tried to destroy the forest before, but the Ohm have attacked and destroyed many cities and killed thousands of people. Yupa discovers a secret garden of jungle plants that had been cared for by Nausicaä; according to her findings, plants that grow in clean soil and water are not toxic, but the jungle&#x27;s soil has been tainted by pollution.

Kushana leaves for Tolmekian-occupied Pejite with Nausicaä and five hostages from the Valley, but a Pejite interceptor shoots down the Tolmekian airships carrying them. Nausicaä, Kushana and the hostages crash-land in the jungle, disturbing several Ohm, which Nausicaä soothes. She leaves to rescue the interceptor&#x27;s pilot, who turns out to be Princess Lastelle&#x27;s twin brother, Asbel, but both crash through a stratum of quicksand into a non-toxic area below the Toxic Jungle. Nausicaä realizes that the jungle plants purify the polluted topsoil, producing clean water and soil underground.

Nausicaä and Asbel reach Pejite but find it ravaged by insects. They learn that the local survivors lured the insects to eradicate the Tolmekians, and are doing the same to the Valley. Nausicaä is taken prisoner, but escapes with the help of a group of Pejite sympathizers, including Asbel and his mother. She soon discovers two Pejite soldiers using a wounded baby Ohm to lure thousands of Ohm into the Valley. As the Tolmekians fight against the Ohm, the Giant Warrior, having hatched prematurely, disintegrates after killing a fraction of the Ohm.

Meanwhile, Nausicaä fights the Pejite soldiers and liberates the baby Ohm, but the pink dress she received from Asbel&#x27;s mother is drenched in blue by the Ohm&#x27;s blood. Nausicaä and the Ohm return to the Valley and stand before the herd but are run over. The Ohm calm down and resuscitate her with their golden tentacles. Nausicaä walks atop the tentacles as through golden fields, fulfilling the savior prophecy. With the Valley saved, the Ohm and Tolmekians leave as the Pejites remain with the Valley people, helping them rebuild. Deep underneath the Toxic Jungle, a non-toxic tree sprouts.

==Production==

Hayao Miyazaki made his feature directorial debut in 1979 with &quot;Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro&quot;, a film which went on to receive the Ōfuji Noburō Award at the 1979 Mainichi Film Awards. Miyazaki had previously co-directed episodes of the television series &quot;Lupin The Third Part I&quot; with Isao Takahata. Although &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot; was not a box office success, Toshio Suzuki, editor of the magazine &quot;Animage&quot;, was impressed by the film and encouraged Miyazaki to produce works for &quot;Animage&quot; publisher Tokuma Shoten. Miyazaki began writing the manga &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; in 1981, and it quickly became &quot;Animage&quot; most popular feature. Toshio Suzuki and the magazine&#x27;s other editors encouraged Miyazaki to work on a film adaptation. Miyazaki initially refused, as he had a deal with Tokuma to never adapt the manga into a film, but agreed on the condition that he could direct.

In the early stages, Isao Takahata, credited as executive producer, reluctantly joined the project even before the animation studio was chosen. An outside studio to produce the film was needed because Tokuma Shoten did not own an animation studio: Miyazaki and Takahata chose the minor studio Topcraft. The production studio&#x27;s work was known to both Miyazaki and Takahata and was chosen because its artistic talent could transpose the sophisticated atmosphere of the manga to the film. On 31 May 1983, work began on the pre-production of the film. With at that point only sixteen chapters of the manga to work with, Miyazaki encountered difficulties in creating the screenplay. He ended up taking elements of the story and refocusing the narrative and characters on the Tolmekian invasion of Nausicaä&#x27;s homeland. Takahata enlisted the experimental and minimalist composer Joe Hisaishi to do the score for the film.

Animation work began in August 1983, produced by animators who were paid by the frame. One notable animator was Hideaki Anno, a founding member of Gainax, who among later works wrote and directed &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. Anno was assigned to draw the challenging Giant Warrior&#x27;s attack sequence, which according to Toshio Suzuki is a &quot;high point in the film&quot;.

The film was made on a production schedule of only nine months and with a budget equivalent to .

==Themes==
Miyazaki&#x27;s work on &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; was inspired by a range of works including Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;Earthsea&quot;, Brian Aldiss&#x27;s &quot;Hothouse&quot;, Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Nightfall&quot;, and J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Miyazaki also says he took possible inspiration from &quot;The Lady who Loved Insects&quot; folktale. Nausicaä, the character, was inspired in name and personality by Homer&#x27;s Phaeacian princess in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. According to a number of reviewers, Frank Herbert&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Dune&quot; was one of the inspirations for the film&#x27;s post-apocalyptic world. Some online commentators have dubbed it &quot;anime&#x27;s answer to &quot;Dune&quot;&quot;. Miyazaki&#x27;s imagination was sparked by the mercury poisoning of Minamata Bay and how nature responded and thrived in a poisoned environment, using it to create the polluted world depicted in the film. Kyle Anderson of &quot;Nerdist&quot; describes the film&#x27;s setting as a steampunk post-apocalypse, while Philip Boyes of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; describes the technology in &quot;Nausicaä&quot; and &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; as dieselpunk.

The most prominent themes are the anti-war and environmental focus of the film. Nausicaä, the heroine, believes in the value of life regardless of its form and through her actions stops a war. Loy and Goodhew state there is no evil portrayed in the film, but the Buddhist roots of evil: greed, ill will and delusion. Fear is what drives the conflicts, the fear of the poisoned forest results in greed and resentment. Nausicaä, in addition to being a transformative force, leads people to understand and respect nature, which is portrayed as welcoming, spiritual, and restorative for those who enter it peacefully. Ian DeWeese-Boyd agrees, &quot;Her commitment to love and understanding—even to the point of death—transforms the very nature of the conflict around her and begins to dispel the distorting visions that have brought it about.&quot;

==Releases==
The film was released by Toei Company on 11 March 1984 on a double bill with a compilation film of the Italian-Japanese anime television series &quot;Sherlock Hound&quot; episodes &quot;The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle&quot; and &quot;Treasure Under the Sea&quot;. Upon the film&#x27;s 1984 release, it received a recommendation from the World Wide Fund for Nature.

On home video, the film was released on VHS on 21 March 1984 and on Laserdisc on 25 April 1984&lt;ref name=&quot;Screen Int&#x27;l VHS/LD&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; by Tokuma Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Animage Video&quot; imprint.

On 30 July 1995, a subtitled version of the film was screened at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, as part of the &quot;Building Bridges&quot; film festival, marking the fiftieth anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

&quot;Nausicaä&quot; was also included on the &quot;Ghibli ga Ippai: Studio Ghibli Complete LD Collection&quot; boxset, released by Tokuma Shoten in August 1996. The VHS was reissued as the third volume of Buena Vista Home Entertainment Japan&#x27;s &quot;Ghibli ga Ippai&quot; imprint, on 19 September 1997.

Buena Vista released the film on three DVD sets, with a regular DVD and figure set released on 19 November 2003 and a collectors set following on 7 December 2003. By 2003, &quot;Nausicaä&quot; had sold 1.77million VHS and DVD units in Japan. Walt Disney Studios Japan released the film on Blu-ray on 14 July 2010.

===&quot;Warriors of the Wind&quot;===
In advance of the film&#x27;s Japanese release, Tokuma Shoten sold the film&#x27;s foreign sales rights to World Film Corporation, who pre-sold the global distribution rights in turn to Manson International. Manson commissioned ADR producer Riley Jackson&#x27;s Showmen, Inc. to produce an English-dubbed adaptation overseen by screenwriter David Schmoeller, titled &quot;Warriors of the Wind&quot;, which was released theatrically in the United States by New World Pictures beginning on 14 June 1985 in Florida. It was followed by a VHS release in November 1985. In 1986, Vestron Video would release the film in the UK and First Independent Video would re-release it again in 1993. The voice actors were not credited, and the film was heavily cut by approximately 22 minutes compared to the 117-minute Japanese version to give it a faster pace. The film received a PG rating as did Disney&#x27;s later English dub. Consequently, part of the film&#x27;s narrative depth was lost: some of the environmentalist themes were simplified as was the main subplot of the Ohmu, omitting Nausicaä&#x27;s childhood connection to them. Most of the characters&#x27; names were changed, including the titular character who became Princess Zandra. The United States poster and VHS cover featured unusual depictions of the film&#x27;s characters, as well as some who are not in the film, riding the resurrected Giant Warrior—including a still-living Warrior shown briefly in a flashback.

Dissatisfied with &quot;Warriors of the Wind&quot;, Miyazaki eventually adopted a strict &quot;no-edits&quot; clause for further foreign releases of the company&#x27;s films. On hearing that Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein would attempt to edit &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; to make it more marketable, Toshio Suzuki presented a prop katana to Weinstein with a simple verbal message: &quot;&quot;Mononoke Hime&quot;, no cut!&quot; &quot;Warriors of the Wind&quot; also prompted Miyazaki to allow translator Toren Smith of Studio Proteus to create an official, faithful translation of the &quot;Nausicaä&quot; manga for Viz Media.

===English re-releases===
On 18 October 2003, Cindy and Donald Hewitt, the scriptwriters of Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; English dubs of &quot;Spirited Away&quot; and &quot;Porco Rosso&quot;, announced that a more faithful English version of &quot;Nausicaä&quot; was in pre-production at Disney, and that Patrick Stewart and Uma Thurman had been cast. Natalie Portman was originally intended to voice Nausicaä, but Alison Lohman was eventually cast in the role. The dub was directed by Disney executive Rick Dempsey.

&quot;Nausicaä&quot; was released on DVD by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on 22 February 2005, for Region 1. This DVD includes both Disney&#x27;s English dub and the Japanese audio track with English subtitles. Optimum Home Entertainment released the film in Region 2 and the Region 4 DVD is distributed by Madman Entertainment. A remastered Blu-ray sourced from a 6K filmscan was released on 14 July 2010 in Japan. It includes an uncompressed Japanese LPCM stereo track, the Disney-produced English dub and English subtitles. On 18 October 2010, a Blu-ray version was released in Region B by Optimum Home Entertainment. The film was released on Blu-ray in the United States and Canada on 8 March 2011, by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment. The Blu-ray earned $334,473 in retail sales during its first week of release in the United States. GKIDS and Shout! Factory re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on 31 October 2017, along with &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;. A Limited Edition steelbook release of the film&#x27;s DVD and Blu-ray was released in the United States on 25 August 2020.

===Other language releases===
In Spain, the edited 95-minute long Manson International version, called &quot;Guerreros del Viento&quot; (&#x27;Warriors of the Wind&#x27;), was released on home video twice, with the first release in 1988 and the second in 1991, followed by the original uncut film under the title &quot;Nausicaä del Valle del Viento&quot; in 2010. France has had both versions of the movie appear, with two releases of the Manson version titled &quot;La Princesse des Étoiles&quot; (&#x27;The Princess of the Stars&#x27;) and &quot;Le vaisseau fantôme&quot; (&#x27;The Ghost Ship&#x27;), while the uncut film had a regular and collector&#x27;s DVD set release on 18 April 2007. In Germany UFA released the Manson version on VHS as &quot;Sternenkrieger&quot; (&#x27;Star Warriors&#x27;) in 1986 and Universum Anime released the uncut DVD release on 5 September 2005. The 2007 Hungarian DVD release, titled &quot;Nauszika – A szél harcosai&quot; (&#x27;Nausicaä – The Warriors of the Wind&#x27;) is uncut despite the title&#x27;s reference. The Korean DVD release of the uncut film was on 3 March 2004. China has had three releases of &quot;Nausicaä&quot;: the first on Video CD and two DVD releases. In Italy the film, titled &quot;Nausica nella Valle del vento&quot; (&#x27;Nausicaä in the Valley of the Wind&#x27;), was first aired uncut on Rai 1 on 6 January 1987 with a first dub, but this version was re-aired only a few times and then never officially published; a planned DVD release around 2003 by Buena Vista Italia was eventually cancelled. &quot;Nausicaä&quot; had a theatrical distribution and a DVD release with a new dub by Lucky Red in 2015.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; received critical acclaim. The film is frequently ranked among the best animated films ever made, and is seen by critics as a seminal influence on the development of anime, as the film&#x27;s success led to the foundation of Miyazaki&#x27;s Studio Ghibli and several other anime studios. In a contemporary review of the initial American release, Terry Lawson of Dayton Daily News applauded the film for its character designs and allegorical themes, as well as Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s direction and Joe Hisaishi&#x27;s score. Theron Martin of Anime News Network praised the film for largely the same reasons. He also said that the film &quot;deserves a place on any short list of all-time classic anime movies.&quot; Common Sense Media, which serves to inform parents about media for children, rated the film positively and cited its good role models and positive messages, but also cautioned parents about its dramatic setting and violent scenes. At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 86 out of 100 based on 7 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Helen McCarthy in &quot;500 Essential Anime Movies&quot; praised the animation techniques of Miyazaki, stating that &quot;the real strength of this film is the script, packed with incident, excitement and passion, and the soundtrack&quot; by Joe Hisaishi.

Sega&#x27;s Yukio Futatsugi has cited the film an inspiration for his 1995 rail shooter &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot;, as he was an avid fan of Miyazaki&#x27;s work. Numerous games have used Ohmu-like creatures assumed to be references to the film, including &quot;Metal Slug 3&quot;, &quot;Cyber Core&quot;, and &quot;Viewpoint&quot;. The game &quot;Crystalis&quot;, known in Japan as &quot;God Slayer: Haruka Tenkū no Sonata&quot; (ゴッド・スレイヤー はるか天空のソナタ), shares common elements with the film, including an insect that resembles an Ohmu. The film &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015) also shares common elements with the film, including similarities between the protagonists Nausicaä and Rey (such as their personalities and headwear), and a number of strikingly similar scenes.

Manga author Katsura Hoshino regarded it as her favorite anime film to the point of having watched it multiple times when she was young. In 2001, the Japanese magazine &quot;Animage&quot; elected &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; the 43rd best anime production of all time. It was the highest-ranking film in a 2006 poll of the greatest animations conducted at the Japan Media Arts Festival, voted by 80,000 attendees. The film was named 2nd &quot;Greatest Japanese Animated Film of All Time&quot; by Japanese film magazine &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; in 2009.

==Gliders==
Various gliders are seen in the film and the protagonist, Nausicaä, uses a jet-assisted one-person glider-shaped machine with folding wings. According to the accompanying film book released in Japan, the glider is called , the German word meaning &quot;gull&quot;. An official scale model lists it as having an approximate wingspan of 5.8 meters (1:20 model measured to be 29 cm), while the design notes indicate it has a mass of only 12 kg. In 2004, the Japanese-led OpenSky Aircraft Project began attempts to build a real-life, working personal jet glider based on the glider from the film. Two full-size gliders with no power source carrying the code name M01 and M02, with a half-sized jet-powered remote-controlled mock-up called &quot;moewe 1/2&quot;, were built. The designer and tester of the project refused the official endorsement of the project by Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki, noting that he did not want to cause trouble for them if an accident occurred. A jet-powered version (registration number JX0122) was finally able to take off under its own power for the first time on 3 September 2013.

==Soundtracks==
The film&#x27;s score was composed by Joe Hisaishi, while the titular theme song &quot;Kaze no Tani no Naushika&quot; was written by Takashi Matsumoto, composed by Haruomi Hosono and sung by Narumi Yasuda. The song &quot;Nausicaä&#x27;s Requiem&quot; was performed by then-four-year-old Mai Fujisawa, Hisaishi&#x27;s daughter. Numerous soundtracks and albums relating to the film have been released.

==Other media==

===Manga===

Miyazaki&#x27;s manga version of &quot;Nausicaä&quot; was written over a period of 12 years, with breaks taken to work on Studio Ghibli films. Serialized in Tokuma Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Animage&quot; magazine, the first chapter was published in February 1982 and the last chapter in March 1994. Miyazaki adapted and altered the work for the film because only sixteen chapters of the manga were written at the time of the film&#x27;s production. The manga would continue to be produced until the seventh and final book was released on 15 January 1995. The English localization was initially done by Toren Smith and Dana Lewis of Studio Proteus. After Miyazaki resumed production of the manga, Viz Media chose a new team and continued to release the rest of manga.

===Video games===
Three video games were released based on the manga and the film, all of which were developed and published by Technopolis Soft and released in 1984 on popular Japanese computer systems. The first game, &quot;Nausicaä&#x27;s Close Call&quot;, also known as &quot;Nausicaä in the Nick of Time&quot;, (ナウシカ危機一髪, Naushika Kiki Ippatsu) is a Japanese shoot &#x27;em up video game developed and published by Technopolis Soft for the NEC PC-6001. The second game, &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; and known by its title screen as &quot;Nausicaä Adventure Game&quot; (風の谷のナウシカ, Kaze no Tani no Naushika), is an adventure game developed by Technopolis Soft for the NEC PC-8801. The third game, &quot;Never Forget to Nausicaä Game Forever&quot; (忘れじのナウシカ・ゲーム, Wasure ji no Naushika Gemu) for the MSX is the most well-known of the releases and has been frequently and erroneously referred to as a game where the player kills the Ohmu. These games signaled the end of video game adaptations for Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s films. The only other games based on Miyazaki films were the LaserDisc arcade game &quot;Cliff Hanger&quot; and the MSX2 platform-adventure game &quot;Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro&quot;, both of which were based on &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot;. Luke Plunkett describes these &quot;two awful adaptations&quot; as the reason Miyazaki does not allow further video game adaptations of his films.

===Other===

An art book for the film, , was released in 1996. Written and illustrated by Hayao Miyazaki, it contains the original watercolor illustrations that were concept sketches used by the manga and the film. Tokuma Shoten first released the artbook on 31 July 1996. The artbook was licensed for a North American release by Viz Media, which released the book on 6 November 2007. It was also licensed in Australasia by Madman Entertainment and in France by Glénat. In 2001, the &quot;Nausicaä&quot; storyboards were re-released, bundled into a single, larger, volume as part 1 of the Studio Ghibli Story boards collection. A selection of layout designs for the film was also incorporated in the &quot;Studio Ghibli Layout Designs&quot; exhibition tour, which started in the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo (28 July 2008 to 28 September 2008) and subsequently travelled to different museums around Japan and Asia, concluding in the Fukuoka Asian Art Museum (12 October 2013 to 26 January 2014). The exhibition catalogues contain annotated reproductions of the displayed artwork. Tokuma Shoten released a film comic, in four volumes, one each week from 20 November 1990 to 20 December 1990. A two-volume children&#x27;s version was released on 31 March 1998. A kabuki play adaptation, covering the events of the movie, was performed in December 2019.

<doc id="92691" wikidata="Q26590" url="?curid=92691" title="Ciudad Juárez">
<text>Ciudad Juárez ( , ; &quot;Juárez City&quot;), commonly referred to as just Juárez (Lipan: &quot;Tsé Táhú&#x27;ayá&quot;), is the most populous city in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. It was known until 1888 as (&quot;The North Pass&quot;). It is the seat of the Juárez Municipality with an estimated population of 2.5 million people. Juárez lies on the Rio Grande (Río Bravo del Norte) river, south of El Paso, Texas, United States. Together with the surrounding areas, the cities form El Paso–Juárez, the second largest binational metropolitan area on the Mexico–U.S. border (after San Diego–Tijuana), with a combined population of over 3.4 million people.

Four international points of entry connect Ciudad Juárez and El Paso: the Bridge of the Americas, the Ysleta–Zaragoza International Bridge, the Paso del Norte Bridge, and the Stanton Street Bridge. Combined, these bridges allowed 22,958,472 crossings in 2008, making Ciudad Juárez a major point of entry and transportation into the U.S. for all of central northern Mexico. The city has a growing industrial center, which in large part is made up by more than 300 (assembly plants) located in and around the city. According to a 2007 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, Ciudad Juárez was &quot;absorbing more new industrial real estate space than any other North American city&quot;. In 2008, &quot;fDi Magazine&quot; designated Ciudad Juárez &quot;The City of the Future&quot;.

==History==

As 17th-century Spanish explorers sought a route through the southern Rocky Mountains, the Franciscan Friar García de San Francisco founded Ciudad Juárez in 1659 as &quot;El Paso del Norte&quot; (&quot;The North Pass&quot;). The Misión de Guadalupe de los Mansos en el Paso del río del Norte became the first permanent Spanish development in the area in the 1660s. The Franciscan friars established a community that grew in importance as commerce between Santa Fe and Chihuahua passed through it. The wood for the first bridge across the Rio Grande came from Santa Fe, New Mexico, in the late 18th century. The original population of Mansos, Suma, Jumano, and other natives from the south brought by the Spanish from Central New Spain grew around the mission. In 1680 during the Pueblo Revolt, most of the Piro Pueblo and some of the Tiwa people branch of the Pueblo became refugees. A Mission was established for the Tigua in Ysleta del Sur. Piro Pueblo colonial era settlements along El Camino Real, south of the Guadalupe Mission, included Missions Real de San Lorenzo, Senecú del Sur, and Soccoro del Sur. Presidio del Nuestra Senora del Pilar del Paso del Rio Norte was established near the Mission in 1683.

The population of the entire district was close to 5,000 in 1750 when the Apache attacked the other native towns and ranchos around the missions. Additional Presidios were established to counter them. One Presidio, San Elzeario, was established near El Porvenir in 1774, where it remained until being moved in 1788 to what is now San Elizario, Texas, where that settlement grew up around that Presidio. Another was Presidio de San Fernando de Carrizal, which was established in 1774 at the San Fernando settlement that became present-day Carrizal, Chihuahua.

During the Mexican–American War, the Battle of El Bracito took place nearby on Christmas Day, 1846. The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo established the Rio Grande as the border between Mexico and the United States. The main channel of the Rio Grande had moved southwestward leaving the settlements of Ysleta, Socorro, and San Elzeario on the Camino Real on the north bank of the river, isolated from the rest of the towns, in Texas.

Other settlements on the east bank of the Rio Grande were not part of a town at that time; as the U.S. Army set up its installations settlements grew around it. This would later become El Paso, Texas. From that time until around 1930, populations on both sides of the border moved freely across it.

In 1853, a new border adjustment occurred when the territory of La Mesilla was sold to the United States, with which the new border line after the Rio Grande began precisely in Paso del Norte, reinforcing its status as a border town.

During the French intervention in Mexico (1862–1867), Benito Juárez&#x27;s republican forces stopped temporarily at El Paso del Norte before establishing his government-in-exile in Chihuahua. After 1882, the city grew, in large part, because of the arrival of the Mexican Central Railway. Commerce thrived in the city as more banks began operating, telegraph and telephone services became available, and trams appeared. These commercial activities were under the firm control of the city&#x27;s oligarchy, which consisted of the Ochoa, Samaniego, Daguerre, Provencio, and Cuarón families. In 1888, El Paso del Norte was renamed in honor of Benito Juárez.

===City expansion under Porfirio Díaz ===
The city expanded significantly thanks to Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s free-trade policy, creating a new retail and service sector along the old Calle del Comercio (now Vicente Guerrero) and September 16 Avenue. A bullring opened in 1899. The Escobar brothers founded the city&#x27;s first institution of higher education in 1906, the Escuela Particular de Agricultura. That same year, a series of public works are inaugurated, including the city&#x27;s sewage and drainage system, as well as potable water. A public library, schools, new public market (the old Mercado Cuauhtémoc) and parks dotted the city, making it one of many Porfirian showcases. 

Modern hotels and restaurants were built to cater the increased international railroad traffic from the 1880s onwards. However, national and foreign opposition to the &quot;disloyal&quot; commercial rivalry of the free zone was not long in coming and the Mexican government was forced to modify the status of the free zone in 1891. To this must be added the worldwide devaluation of silver and water scarcity, which generated a severe economic crisis in the city, causing a significant number of workers to flee to the United States. As a result of the collapse of commercial activities and population, Ciudad Juárez focused on tourism as an economic activity at the beginning of the 20th century, particularly promoting &quot;diversions&quot;, thus beginning &quot;the moment of scandal&quot;

In 1909, Díaz and William Howard Taft planned a summit in Ciudad Juárez and El Paso, a historic first meeting between a Mexican and a U.S. president, and also the first time a U.S. president would cross the border into Mexico. But tensions rose on both sides of the border over the disputed Chamizal strip connecting Ciudad Juárez to El Paso, even though it would have been considered neutral territory with no flags present during the summit. The Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of Díaz and Taft.

=== Mexican Revolution ===
The city was Mexico&#x27;s largest border town by 1910. As such, it held strategic importance during the Mexican Revolution. In May 1911, about 3,000 revolutionary fighters under the leadership of Francisco I. Madero laid siege to Ciudad Juárez, which was garrisoned by 500 regular Federal troops under the command of General Juan José Navarro. Navarro&#x27;s force was supported by 300 civilian auxiliaries and local police. After two days of heavy fighting most of the city had fallen to the insurrectionists and the surviving federal soldiers had withdrawn to their barracks. Navarro then formally surrendered to Madero. The capture of a key border town at an early stage of the revolution not only enabled the revolutionary forces to bring in weapons and supplies from El Paso, but marked the beginning of the end for the demoralized Diaz regime.

During the subsequent years of the conflict, Pancho Villa and other revolutionaries struggled for the control of the town (and income from the Federal Customs House), destroying much of the city during battles in 1911 and 1913. Much of the population abandoned the city between 1914 and 1917. Tourism, gambling, and light manufacturing drove the city&#x27;s recovery from the 1920s until the 1940s. A series of mayors in the 1940s–1960s, like Carlos Villareal and René Mascareñas Miranda, ushered in a period of high growth and development predicated on the PRONAF border industrialization development program. 

=== Beautification ===
A beautification program spruced up the city center, building a series of arched porticos around the main square, as well as neo-colonial façades for main public buildings such as the city health clinic, the central fire station, and city hall. The cathedral, built in the 1950s, gave the city center the flavor of central Mexico, with its carved towers and elegant dome, but structural problems required its remodeling in the 1970s. The city&#x27;s population reached some 400,000 by 1970. In 1984, the city had a radiation incident after a private medical company illegally purchased a radiation therapy unit. It was dismantled, sold to a junkyard and later smelted to produce six thousand tons of rebar (which is used to reinforce buildings), exposing thousands to radiation.

Juárez has grown substantially in recent decades due to a large influx of people moving into the city in search of jobs with the maquiladoras. more technological firms have moved to the city, such as the Delphi Corporation Technical Center, the largest in the Western Hemisphere, which employs over 2,000 engineers. Large slum housing communities called &quot;colonias&quot; have become extensive.

Juárez has a long, notorious history of drug trafficking and the intense related violence. Mexico&#x27;s first homegrown cartel, run by Ignacia Jasso, was seated in the city, and for a time controlled much of the border drug trade. Today the Juárez Cartel controls the routes in Juárez. Related violence in the city is responsible for more than 1,000 unsolved murders of young women from 1993 to 2003.

===Cityscape===

Ciudad Juárez has many affluent neighborhoods, such as Campestre, Campos Elíseos, and Misión de Los Lagos. Other neighborhoods, including Anapra, Chaveña, and Anáhuac, would be considered more marginal, while the remaining neighborhoods in Juárez represent the middle- to working-class, for example, Infonavit, Las Misiones, Valle de Juárez, Lindavista, Altavista, Guadalajara, Galeana, Flores Magón, Mariano Escobedo, Los Nogales, and Independencia.

==Demographics==


Between the 1960s and 1990s, Juárez saw a high level of population growth due in part to the newly established maquiladoras. The end of the Bracero Program also brought workers back from border cities in the U.S. through Ciudad Juárez, contributing to the growing number of citizens.

The average annual growth in population over a 10-year period [1990–2000] was 5.3%. According to the 2010 population census, the city had 1,321,004 inhabitants, while the municipality had 1,332,131 inhabitants. During the last decades the city has received migrants from Mexico&#x27;s interior, some figures state that 32% of the city&#x27;s population originate outside the state of Chihuahua, mainly from the states of Durango (9.9%), Coahuila (6.3%), Veracruz (3.7%) and Zacatecas (3.5%), as well as from Mexico City (1.7%).

However, a March 2009 article noted there has been a mass exodus of people who could afford to leave the city due to the ongoing violence from the Mexican Drug War. The article quoted a city planning department estimate of over 116,000 abandoned homes, which could roughly be the equivalent of 400,000 people who have left the city due to the violence. A September 2010 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; said of Ciudad Juárez: &quot;About 10,670 businesses – 40% of the total – have shut down. A study by the city&#x27;s university found that 116,000 houses have been abandoned and 230,000 people have left.&quot;

==Government==
The city is governed by a municipal president and an 18-seat council. The president is Cruz Pérez Cuéllar, who won as a MORENA candidate in 2021. Six national parties are represented on the council: the PRI, the National Action Party, Ecologist Green Party of Mexico, Party of the Democratic Revolution, Labor Party and the New Alliance Party.

===Crime and safety===

Violence towards women in the municipality increased dramatically between 1993 and the mid-2000s, with approximately 370 girls and women murdered and at least 400 women reported missing. Much of the violence in the city is due to warring drug cartels, primarily the Juárez, Jalisco and Sinaloa cartels. As of September 2022, the war has taken the lives of 717 individuals, including 87 women.

In 2012, the Juárez police department dismissed approximately 800 officers in an effort to clean up corruption within its ranks. Recruitment goals set by the department called for the force to more than double. In 2009, a vigilante group calling itself Juárez Citizens Command threatened to put a stop to all the perpetrators of violence if the government continued to fail to curb the violence in the city. Government officials expressed concern that such vigilantism would contribute to further instability and violence.

In 2008, General Moreno and the Third Infantry Company took over the fight against the cartels in town. They were removed in 2009, with the general and 29 of his associates now in custody and awaiting trial for charges of murder and civil rights violations.
In response to increasing violence in the city, the presence of the Mexican Armed Forces and Federal Police has almost doubled. By August 2009 there were more than 7500 soldiers augmented by an expanded and highly restaffed municipal police force.
, Juárez&#x27;s murder rate placed #2 of the highest reported in the world, at 104 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. An August 2008 &quot;GQ&quot; article described a dispirited and disorderly atmosphere that permeated the city, caused by multiple factors including drug violence, government corruption and poverty. As of February 2022, homicides in the city have reached a three-year low, with a total of 1412 homicides in the year 2021. However, Amnesty International estimates that as many as 95 percent of violent crimes go unreported, meaning there are questions to the accuracy of the 2021 figures.

===Crime reduction===
After the homicide rates escalated to the point of making Ciudad Juárez the most violent city in the world, violent crime began to decline in the early 2010s. In 2012, homicides were at their lowest rate since 2007 when drug violence flared between the Sinaloa and Juárez Cartel. That trend has continued in 2015 with 300 homicides reported, the lowest number since 2006. Explanations for the rapid decline in violence include the Sinaloa Cartel&#x27;s success in defeating its rivals, as well as federal, state and local government efforts to combat crime and improve the city&#x27;s quality of life.

The cause of the reduction in crime is the subject of speculation. One theory attributes it to deals the rival gangs made to coexist once the federal police were withdrawn in 2011. Another holds that a more powerful trafficking network, such as Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán&#x27;s Sinaloa cartel, might have moved in and restored a kind of &quot;order among thieves.&quot; Others attribute it to the end of the cartel war between Juárez and Sinaloa, the arrest or dismissal of many policemen with cartel ties, resolutions reached by liaisons between government and a group of local leaders called &quot;La Mesa de Seguridad y Justicia&quot;, and the creation of an anti-extortion squad to combat extortion inflicted upon local companies. Crime was significantly reduced from 2010 to 2014, with 3,500 homicides in 2010 and 430 in 2014. In 2015, there were only 311 homicides.

The decrease in crime inspired more business in the city. Some citizens who left because of the violence have since returned with their families. Many of them had moved their businesses to El Paso. In addition, U.S. companies are investing more in Juárez. Community centers work with victims of crime and teach women how to defend themselves. Citizens have also formed neighborhood watch groups and patrol neighborhoods. &quot;La Fundacion Comunitaria de la Frontera Norte&quot; is giving young people career opportunities and giving people hope. Technology HUB is a startup incubator working to diversify the city&#x27;s economy and move the regions low-skill manufacturing industry into an innovation cluster. Its economic development projects are in line with the research of University of Berkeley Professor Enrico Moretti. Innovation economies are found to be more adaptive to shifting tech and trade conditions and more resilient to the kind of civil unrest that plagued Ciudad Juarez in the past. City officials have said that they have plans to increase tourism in the city. For example, in April 2015, the city created a new campaign to increase tourism called &quot;Juarez is waiting for you&quot;. That same month, U.S. representative Beto O&#x27;Rourke visited Juárez to give a speech about how much Juárez has changed for the better. A children&#x27;s museum was opened in honor of the children who lost their parents during the violent years. Businesses that were closed because of the violence and extortion have reopened in recent years. The city&#x27;s violence was depicted in the 2015 film &quot;Sicario&quot;, drawing criticism and calls for a boycott from Juárez mayor Enrique Serrano Escobar, who said the film presented a false and negative image of the city. He said the violence the film depicted was accurate through about 2010, and that the city had made progress in restoring peace.

== Economy ==
The El Paso Regional Economic Development Corporation indicated that Ciudad Juárez is the metropolis absorbing &quot;more new industrial real estate space than any other North American city.&quot; The Financial Times Group through its publication The Foreign Direct Investment Magazine ranked Ciudad Juárez as the &quot;City of the Future&quot; for 2007–2008. The El Paso–Juárez area is a major manufacturing center. CommScope, Electrolux, Bosch, Foxconn, Flextronics, Lexmark, Delphi, Visteon, Johnson Controls, Toro, Lear, Boeing, Cardinal Health, Yazaki, Sumitomo, and Siemens are some of the foreign companies that have chosen Ciudad Juárez for business operations.

The Mexican state of Chihuahua is frequently among the top five states in Mexico with the most foreign investment. Many foreign retail, banking, and fast-food businesses have locations within Juárez.

In the 1990s, traditional brick kilns made up a big part of the economic informal sector. These were typically located in the poorer regions of Juárez. The kilns used open-air fires, where certain materials that were burned generated a lot of air pollution. Along with rapid industrialization, small brick kilns have been a big contributor to the high amount of air pollution in Ciudad Juárez. While the Ciudad Juárez economy has largely been dependent on Maquiladora program, business leaders have undertaken initiatives to upskill and secure the city are larger stake in the global manufacturing economy. Technology Hub is a business incubator that works with regionally based companies, on programs in skill development, and the transition into automation and industry 4.0.

==Transportation==
===Public bus system===
The main public transportation system in the city is the public bus system. The public buses run the main streets of Ciudad Juárez throughout the day, costing eight pesos (less than 40 cents) to ride one. Due to the aging current bus fleet being considered potentially outdated, the municipal government is working on replacing the buses with new ones, along with improving the bus stops, by equipping them with shade.

The ViveBus bus rapid transit (BRT) system opened to the public in November 2013 with the first route of five planned. The project was made a reality with the collaboration of the local municipal government, the private enterprise of Integradora de Transporte de Juárez (INTRA) as well as other city government agencies. Studies have shown that the current bus system averages while the new system is projected to average . The BRT system studies conducted by the Instituto Municipal de Investigación Y Planeación project a daily ridership of 40,000. In late March 2024, the system was reopened and rebranded to “Juárez Bus”, with the construction of stations all around the city prior to the reopening. This was due to the massive failure that was the ViveBus, only having very partial success in the city of Chihuahua, where the system was based, and seen by locals as a major money waste. Today, the new bus system operates around 100 BRT-1 Mercedes-Benz buses.

The first of the five routes opened to users in late 2013 and is officially named Presidencia-Tierra Nueva and has 34 stations distributed along the north to south corridor. The route starts at Avenida Francisco Villa, follows north to Eje Vial Norte-Sur then veers left at Zaragoza Blvd. and ends at Avenida Independencia and the elevated Carretera Federal 2.

===Airport===
The city is served by Abraham González International Airport, with flights to several Mexican cities. It accommodates national and international air traffic for the city. Nearby El Paso International Airport handles flights to cities within the United States.

===International border crossings===
The first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of New Spain, over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe. Today, this bridge is honored by the modern Santa Fe Street Bridge, and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.

Several bridges serve the El Paso–Ciudad Juárez area in addition to the Paso Del Norte Bridge also known as the Santa Fe Street Bridge, including the Bridge of the Americas, Stanton Street Bridge, and the Ysleta Bridge also known as the Zaragoza Bridge.

There is also a land crossing at nearby Santa Teresa, New Mexico, and another one, the Fabens–Caseta International Bridge located 50 km southeast of Juárez.

===Rail===
====Light rail====
El Paso City Lines operated a streetcar system in Juárez from 1881 until 1974.

====Heavy rail====
Mexico North Western Railway&#x27;s subsidiary operation, the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad, extended into the US at El Paso, Texas but no longer operates passenger rail.

<text>The common cold or the cold is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the respiratory mucosa of the nose, throat, sinuses, and larynx. Signs and symptoms may appear in as little as two days after exposure to the virus. These may include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days, but some symptoms may last up to three weeks. Occasionally, those with other health problems may develop pneumonia.
Well over 200 virus strains are implicated in causing the common cold, with rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses and enteroviruses being the most common. They spread through the air or indirectly through contact with objects in the environment, followed by transfer to the mouth or nose. Risk factors include going to child care facilities, not sleeping well, and psychological stress. The symptoms are mostly due to the body&#x27;s immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. The symptoms of influenza are similar to those of a cold, although usually more severe and less likely to include a runny nose.
There is no vaccine for the common cold. This is due to the rapid mutation and wide variation of viruses that cause the common cold. The primary methods of prevention are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and staying away from sick people. People are considered contagious as long as the symptoms are still present. Some evidence supports the use of face masks. There is also no cure, but the symptoms can be treated. Zinc may reduce the duration and severity of symptoms if started shortly after the onset of symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics, however, should not be used, as all colds are caused by viruses rather than bacteria. There is no good evidence that cough medicines are effective.
The common cold is the most frequent infectious disease in humans. Under normal circumstances, the average adult gets two to three colds a year, while the average child may get six to eight colds a year. Infections occur more commonly during the winter. These infections have existed throughout human history.

==Signs and symptoms==
The typical symptoms of a cold include cough, runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion, and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases, a cough in about 50%, and muscle aches in about 50%. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, a great deal of similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.

The color of the mucus or nasal secretion may vary from clear to yellow to green and does not indicate the class of agent causing the infection.

===Progression===

A cold usually begins with fatigue, a feeling of being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, followed in a couple of days by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.

==Causes==
===Viruses===

The common cold is an infection of the upper respiratory tract which can be caused by many different viruses. The most commonly implicated is a rhinovirus (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes. Other commonly implicated viruses include coronaviruses, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, parainfluenza and RSV. Frequently more than one virus is present. In total, more than 200 viral types are associated with colds. The viral cause of some common colds (20–30%) is unknown.

===Transmission===
The common cold virus is typically transmitted via airborne droplets, direct contact with infected nasal secretions, or fomites (contaminated objects). Which of these routes is of primary importance has not been determined. As with all respiratory pathogens once presumed to transmit via respiratory droplets, it is highly likely to be carried by the aerosols generated during routine breathing, talking, and singing. The viruses may survive for prolonged periods in the environment (over 18 hours for rhinoviruses) and can be picked up by people&#x27;s hands and subsequently carried to their eyes or noses where infection occurs. Transmission from animals is considered highly unlikely; an outbreak documented at a British scientific base on Adelaide Island after seventeen weeks of isolation was thought to have been caused by transmission from a contaminated object or an asymptomatic human carrier, rather than from the husky dogs which were also present at the base.

Transmission is common in daycare and schools due to the proximity of many children with little immunity and poor hygiene. These infections are then brought home to other members of the family. There is no evidence that recirculated air during commercial flight is a method of transmission. People sitting close to each other appear to be at greater risk of infection.

===Other===
Herd immunity, generated from previous exposure to cold viruses, plays an important role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.

==Pathophysiology==

The symptoms of the common cold are believed to be primarily related to the immune response to the virus. The mechanism of this immune response is virus-specific. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to humans via ICAM-1 receptors and the CDHR3 receptor through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. It does not generally cause damage to the nasal epithelium. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. It then replicates in the nose and throat before spreading to the lower respiratory tract. RSV does cause epithelium damage. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. In young children, when it affects the trachea, it may produce the symptoms of croup, due to the small size of their airways.

==Diagnosis==
The distinction between viral upper respiratory tract infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms, with the common cold affecting primarily the nose (rhinitis), throat (pharyngitis), and lungs (bronchitis). There can be significant overlap, and more than one area can be affected. Self-diagnosis is frequent. Isolation of the viral agent involved is rarely performed, and it is generally not possible to identify the virus type through symptoms.

==Prevention==
The only useful ways to reduce the spread of cold viruses are physical and engineering measures such as using correct hand washing technique, respirators, and improvement of indoor air. In the healthcare environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also used. Droplet precautions cannot reliably protect against inhalation of common-cold-laden aerosols. Instead, airborne precautions such as respirators, ventilation, and HEPA/high MERV filters, are the only reliable protection against cold-laden aerosols. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. There is no vaccine to protect against the common cold. Vaccination has proven difficult as there are so many viruses involved and because they mutate rapidly. Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is, therefore, highly improbable.

Regular hand washing appears to be effective in reducing the transmission of cold viruses, especially among children. Whether the addition of antivirals or antibacterials to normal hand washing provides greater benefit is unknown. Wearing face masks when around people who are infected may be beneficial; however, there is insufficient evidence for maintaining a greater social distance.

It is unclear whether zinc supplements affect the likelihood of contracting a cold.

==Management==
Treatments of the common cold primarily involve medications and other therapies for symptomatic relief. Getting plenty of rest, drinking fluids to maintain hydration, and gargling with warm salt water are reasonable conservative measures. Much of the benefit from symptomatic treatment is, however, attributed to the placebo effect. no medications or herbal remedies had been conclusively demonstrated to shorten the duration of infection.

===Symptomatic===

Treatments that may help with symptoms include pain medication and medications for fevers such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol). However, it is not clear whether acetaminophen helps with symptoms. It is not known if over-the-counter cough medications are effective for treating an acute cough. Cough medicines are not recommended for use in children due to a lack of evidence supporting effectiveness and the potential for harm. In 2009, Canada restricted the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medication in children six years and under due to concerns regarding risks and unproven benefits. The misuse of dextromethorphan (an over-the-counter cough medicine) has led to its ban in a number of countries. Intranasal corticosteroids have not been found to be useful.

In adults, short term use of nasal decongestants may have a small benefit. Antihistamines may improve symptoms in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults. Combined oral analgesics, antihistaminics, and decongestants are generally effective for older children and adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. Ipratropium may also help with coughs in adults. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.

Due to lack of studies, it is not known whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness. As of 2017, heated and humidified air, such as via RhinoTherm, is of unclear benefit. One study has found chest vapor rub to provide some relief of nocturnal cough, congestion, and sleep difficulty.

Some experts advise against physical exercise if there are symptoms such as fever, widespread muscle aches or fatigue. It is regarded as safe to perform moderate exercise if the symptoms are confined to the head, including runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, or a minor sore throat. There is a popular belief that having a hot drink can help with cold symptoms, but evidence to support this is very limited.

===Antibiotics and antivirals===
Antibiotics have no effect against viral infections, including the common cold. Due to their side effects, antibiotics cause overall harm but nevertheless are still frequently prescribed. Some of the reasons that antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people&#x27;s expectations for them, physicians&#x27; desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.

===Zinc===
Zinc supplements may shorten the duration of colds by up to 33% and reduce the severity of symptoms if supplementation begins within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. Some zinc remedies directly applied to the inside of the nose have led to the loss of the sense of smell. A 2017 review did not recommend the use of zinc for the common cold for various reasons; whereas a 2017 and 2018 review both recommended the use of zinc, but also advocated further research on the topic.

===Alternative medicine===

While there are many alternative medicines and Chinese herbal medicines supposed to treat the common cold, there is insufficient scientific evidence to support their use. As of 2015, there is weak evidence to support nasal irrigation with saline. There is no firm evidence that Echinacea products or garlic provide any meaningful benefit in treating or preventing colds.

===Vitamins C and D===
Vitamin C supplementation does not affect the incidence of the common cold, but may reduce its duration if taken on a regular basis. There is no conclusive evidence that vitamin D supplementation is efficacious in the prevention or treatment of respiratory tract infections.

==Prognosis==
The common cold is generally mild and self-limiting with most symptoms generally improving in a week. In children, half of cases resolve in 10 days and 90% in 15 days. Severe complications, if they occur, are usually in the very old, the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed. Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis, pharyngitis, or an ear infection. It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8% and ear infection in 30% of cases.

==Epidemiology==
The common cold is the most common human disease and affects people all over the globe. Adults typically have two to three infections annually, and children may have six to ten colds a year (and up to twelve colds a year for school children). Rates of symptomatic infections increase in the elderly due to declining immunity.

===Weather===
A common misconception is that one can &quot;catch a cold&quot; merely through prolonged exposure to cold weather. Although it is now known that colds are viral infections, the prevalence of many such viruses are indeed seasonal, occurring more frequently during cold weather. The reason for the seasonality has not been conclusively determined. Possible explanations may include cold temperature-induced changes in the respiratory system, decreased immune response, and low humidity causing an increase in viral transmission rates, perhaps due to dry air allowing small viral droplets to disperse farther and stay in the air longer.

The apparent seasonality may also be due to social factors, such as people spending more time indoors near infected people, and especially children at school. Although normal exposure to cold does not increase one&#x27;s risk of infection, severe exposure leading to significant reduction of body temperature (hypothermia) may put one at a greater risk for the common cold: although controversial, the majority of evidence suggests that it may increase susceptibility to infection.

==History==
While the cause of the common cold was identified in the 1950s, the disease appears to have been with humanity since its early history. Its symptoms and treatment are described in the Egyptian Ebers papyrus, the oldest existing medical text, written before the 16th century BCE. The name &quot;cold&quot; came into use in the 16th century, due to the similarity between its symptoms and those of exposure to cold weather.

In the United Kingdom, the Common Cold Unit (CCU) was set up by the Medical Research Council in 1946 and it was where the rhinovirus was discovered in 1956. In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease, but no practical treatment could be developed. The unit was closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of zinc gluconate lozenges in the prevention and treatment of rhinovirus colds, the only successful treatment in the history of the unit.

==Research directions==
Antivirals have been tested for effectiveness in the common cold; as of 2009, none had been both found effective and licensed for use. There are trials of the anti-viral drug pleconaril which shows promise against picornaviruses as well as trials of BTA-798. The oral form of pleconaril had safety issues and an aerosol form is being studied. The genomes of all known human rhinovirus strains have been sequenced.

==Societal impact==
The economic impact of the common cold is not well understood in much of the world. In the United States, the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $7.7 billion per year. Americans spend $2.9 billion on over-the-counter drugs and another $400 million on prescription medicines for symptom relief. More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance. An estimated 22–189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold. As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children. When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees who have a cold, the total economic impact of cold-related work loss exceeds $20 billion per year. This accounts for 40% of time lost from work in the United States.

<doc id="92695" wikidata="Q1247044" url="?curid=92695" title="Elmer Gantry">
<text>Elmer Gantry is a 1927 satirical novel written by Sinclair Lewis that presents aspects of the religious activity of the United States in fundamentalist and evangelistic circles and the attitudes of the 1920s public toward it. Reverend Dr. Elmer Gantry, the protagonist, is attracted by drinking, chasing women, and making easy money (although eventually renouncing tobacco and alcohol). In the novel&#x27;s fictional world, after various forays into smaller fringe churches, Gantry becomes a major moral and political force in the Methodist Church despite his hypocrisy and serial sexual indiscretions.

&quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; was published in the United States by Harcourt Trade Publishers in March 1927, dedicated by Lewis to the American journalist and satirist H. L. Mencken.

==Background==

Biographer Mark Schorer states that while researching the book, Lewis attended two or three church services every Sunday while in Kansas City, and that, &quot;He took advantage of every possible tangential experience in the religious community.&quot; According to others, Lewis researched the novel by observing the work of various preachers in Kansas City in his so-called &quot;Sunday School&quot; meetings on Wednesdays. There, he first worked with William L. &quot;Big Bill&quot; Stidger, pastor of the Linwood Boulevard Methodist Episcopal Church. Stidger introduced Lewis to many other clergymen, thus Lewis engaged with Unitarian pastor L. M. Birkhead (an agnostic). Lewis preferred the liberal Birkhead to the conservative Stidger, and on his second visit to Kansas City, Lewis chose Birkhead as his guide. Other Kansas City ministers Lewis interviewed included Burris Jenkins, Earl Blackman, I. M. Hargett, Bert Fiske, and Robert Nelson Horatio Spencer, who was rector of Grace and Holy Trinity Church (now the cathedral of the Episcopal Diocese of West Missouri).

The character of Sharon Falconer was reportedly based on events in the career of the radio evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson, who founded the Pentecostal Christian denomination known as the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel in 1927. Lewis reportedly finished the book while mending a broken leg on Jackfish Island in Rainy Lake, Minnesota.

Experts have noted that George Babbitt, the namesake of one of Lewis&#x27; better-known novels, appears in &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; (briefly, during an encounter at the Zenith Athletic Club), and that the Elmer Gantry character appears as a minor character in two later, lesser-known Lewis novels, &quot;The Man Who Knew Coolidge&quot; and &quot;Gideon Planish&quot;.

==Synopsis==

The novel tells the story of the young, womanizing college athlete, Elmer Gantry, who abandons an early ambition to become a lawyer. After college, he attends a Baptist seminary, and is ordained as a minister. He successfully hides sexual involvements that are prohibited, but is thrown out of the seminary before completing his bachelor of divinity because he is too drunk to appear at a church where he is supposed to preach.

After several years as a traveling salesman of farm equipment, Gantry becomes a confidante of Sharon Falconer, a popular evangelist and motivational speaker who has her own traveling &quot;road church&quot;. Gantry becomes her lover, but she and scores of individuals attending one of her meetings are killed in a catastrophic fire in her tent tabernacle, and so Gantry loses both relationship and position. After the tragedy, he briefly acts as a &quot;New Thought&quot; evangelist, and eventually becomes a Methodist minister.

Gantry marries a local parishioner. Although he is unhappy with her sexual frigidity, he remains with her for sake of appearances. Years later, Methodist leaders award him a larger congregation in the city of Zenith. With his career and power at their peak, Gantry manipulates local, state and national political figures, resulting in police raids against bootleggers and bar patrons. 

Gantry&#x27;s corruption and power hunger contribute to the downfall, physical injury, and even death of key people around him, including a former associate, Frank Shallard, a sincere minister who questions the moral purpose of his church. Shallard is nearly beaten to death by Gantry loyalists who are angered by perceived &quot;atheistic&quot; divergences from Christian teachings.

Gantry&#x27;s career comes close to a major scandal when one of his affairs turns out to involve a husband and wife blackmail team. Gantry is helped in avoiding potential downfall by a close friend, and via political alliances with Deacon Eversley, a powerful lawyer; and a private detective agency. A thoroughly repentant Gantry swears to abstain from his sinful proclivities. As the book closes, Gantry notices a younger woman during a closing sermon scene.

==Publication history==

==Reception==
Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; was a commercial success, and was the best-selling work of fiction in America for 1927 (according to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;). However, on its publication, it created a public furor—it was banned in Boston and in other cities, and denounced from pulpits across the United States. Contemporary Sinclair Lewis biographer Mark Schorer notes that one cleric suggested Lewis be imprisoned for five years; others note that evangelist Billy Sunday threatened to beat him up and called him &quot;Satan&#x27;s cohort&quot;, and Lewis reportedly received an invitation to his own lynching.

===Criticism===

Lewis biographer Schorer notes, &quot;The forces of social good and enlightenment as presented in &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; are not strong enough to offer any real resistance to the forces of social evil and banality.&quot; Schorer concludes, in view of Lewis&#x27; research, that the novel satirically represents the religious activity of America in evangelistic circles and the attitudes of the 1920s toward it.

==Adaptations==

As of November 2007, there have been five adaptations of the novel:

* A Broadway play by Patrick Kearney opened on August 7, 1928 at the Playhouse Theatre, where it ran for 48 performances; the cast included Edward J. Pawley (later of &quot;Big Town&quot; fame) as Elmer Gantry, and Vera Allen as Sister Sharon Falconer.
* Director-screenwriter Richard Brooks&#x27; 1960 &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; starred, among others, Burt Lancaster as Gantry, Shirley Jones as Lulu Bains, and Jean Simmons as Sister Sharon Falconer, and won Brooks the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress for Lancaster and Jones, respectively.
* A 1970 Broadway musical adaptation, titled &quot;Gantry&quot;, opened and closed on the same night, February 14, 1970. 
* A 1998 play adaptation by Richard Rossi was performed in Los Angeles and broadcast on TV October 24, 1998.
* In November 2007, an opera, also titled &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot;, by Robert Aldridge and Herschel Garfein, premiered in the James K. Polk Theater in Nashville, Tennessee.

==Related inspired works==
Shortly after the publication of &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot;, H. G. Wells published a widely syndicated newspaper article titled &quot;The New American People&quot;, in which he largely bases his observations of American culture on Lewis&#x27;s novels, including &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot;.

After the 1998 play by Richard Rossi, that playwright was cast in the lead role of Elmer Gantry in a film remake of the 1960 Academy Award-winning film of the same name, slated to be directed by Amin Q. Chaudhri. Chaudhri sought investors for an initial $20 million budget, but as of this date, a remake has never been made. Rossi then began writing his own story of an Elmer Gantry-ish evangelist in a contemporary setting, which became the film &quot;Canaan Land&quot;.

<doc id="92699" wikidata="Q80771" url="?curid=92699" title="Sons and Lovers">
<text>Sons and Lovers is a 1913 novel by the English writer D. H. Lawrence. It traces emotional conflicts through the protagonist, Paul Morel, and his suffocating relationships with a demanding mother and two very different lovers, which exert complex influences on the development of his manhood. The novel was originally published by Gerald Duckworth and Company Ltd., London, and Mitchell Kennerley Publishers, New York. While the novel initially received a lukewarm critical reception, along with allegations of obscenity, it is today regarded as a masterpiece by many critics and is often regarded as Lawrence&#x27;s finest achievement. It tells us more about Lawrence&#x27;s life and his phases, as his first was when he lost his mother in 1910 to whom he was particularly attached. And it was from then that he met Frieda Richthofen, and around this time that he began conceiving his two other great novels, &quot;The Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Women in Love&quot;, which had more sexual emphasis and maturity.

==Development and publication history==

The third published novel of D. H. Lawrence, taken by many to be his earliest masterpiece, tells the story of Paul Morel, a young man and budding artist.

The original 1913 edition was heavily edited by Edward Garnett who removed 80 passages, roughly a tenth of the text. The novel is dedicated to Garnett. Garnett, as the literary advisor to the publishing firm Duckworth, was an important figure in leading Lawrence farther into the London literary world during the years 1911 and 1912. It was not until the 1992 Cambridge University Press edition was released that the missing text was restored.

Lawrence began working on the novel in the period of his mother&#x27;s illness, and often expresses this sense of his mother&#x27;s wasted life through his female protagonist Gertrude Morel. Letters written around the time of its development clearly demonstrate the admiration he felt for his mother – viewing her as a &#x27;clever, ironical, delicately moulded woman&#x27; – and her apparently unfortunate marriage to his coal-miner father, a man of &#x27;sanguine temperament&#x27; and instability. He believed that his mother had married below her class status. Unlike her husband, Lydia grew up in a middle class religious family, and the differences in their backgrounds often caused family conflicts. On one hand, Mr. Lawrence would spend his wages on drink after working for hours in the coal mine; on the other hand, Mrs. Lawrence focused on their children&#x27;s upbringing, welfare, and education while also harboring a desire to open her own haberdashery shop. This personal family conflict experienced by Lawrence provided him with the impetus for the first half of his novel – in which both William, the older brother, and Paul Morel become increasingly contemptuous of their father – and the subsequent exploration of Paul Morel&#x27;s antagonising relationships with both his lovers, which are both incessantly affected by his allegiance to his mother.

The first draft of Lawrence&#x27;s novel is now lost and was never completed, which seems to be directly due to his mother&#x27;s illness. He did not return to the novel for three months, at which point it was titled &#x27;Paul Morel&#x27;. The penultimate draft of the novel coincided with a remarkable change in Lawrence&#x27;s life, as his health was thrown into turmoil and he resigned his teaching job to spend time in Germany. This plan was never followed, however, as he met and married the German minor aristocrat, Frieda Weekley, who was the wife of a former professor of his at the University of Nottingham. According to Frieda&#x27;s account of their first meeting, she and Lawrence talked about Oedipus and the effects of early childhood on later life within twenty minutes of meeting.

The third draft of &#x27;Paul Morel&#x27; was sent to the publishing house Heinemann; the response, a rather violent reaction, came from William Heinemann himself. His reaction captures the shock and newness of Lawrence&#x27;s novel, &#x27;the degradation of the mother [as explored in this novel], supposed to be of gentler birth, is almost inconceivable&#x27;; he encouraged Lawrence to redraft the novel one more time. In addition to altering the title to a more thematic &#x27;Sons and Lovers&#x27;, Heinemann&#x27;s response had reinvigorated Lawrence into vehemently defending his novel and its themes as a coherent work of art. To justify its form, Lawrence explains, in letters to Garnett, that it is a &#x27;great tragedy&#x27; and a &#x27;great book&#x27;, one that mirrors the &#x27;tragedy of thousands of young men in England&#x27;.

==Title==
Lawrence rewrote the work four times until he was happy with it. Although before publication the work was usually titled &quot;Paul Morel&quot;, Lawrence finally settled on &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot;.

== Synopsis ==

=== Part I ===

The refined daughter of a &quot;good old burgher family,&quot; Gertrude Coppard meets a rough-hewn miner, Walter Morel, at a Christmas dance and falls into a whirlwind romance characterised by physical passion, but soon after her marriage to Walter, she realizes the difficulties of living off his meagre salary in a rented house. The couple fight and drift apart, and Walter retreats to the pub after work each day. Gradually, Mrs. Morel&#x27;s affections shift to her sons beginning with the oldest, William.

As a boy, William is so attached to his mother that he does not enjoy the fair without her. As he grows older, he defends her against his father&#x27;s occasional violence. Eventually, he leaves their Nottinghamshire home for a job in London, where he begins to rise up into the middle class. He is engaged, but he detests his fiancée&#x27;s superficiality. William dies, and Mrs. Morel is heartbroken. When her second son, Paul, catches pneumonia she rediscovers her love for Paul.

=== Part II ===

Both repulsed by and drawn to his mother, Paul is afraid to leave her but wants to go out on his own, and needs to experience love. Gradually, he falls into a relationship with Miriam, a farmer&#x27;s daughter who attends his church. The two take long walks and have intellectual conversations about books but Paul resists, in part because his mother disapproves. At Miriam&#x27;s family&#x27;s farm, Paul meets Clara Dawes, a young woman with, apparently, feminist sympathies who has separated from her husband, Baxter.

After pressuring Miriam into a physical relationship, which he finds unsatisfying, Paul breaks with her as he grows more intimate with Clara, who is more passionate physically. But even she cannot hold him, and he returns to his mother. When his mother dies soon after, he is alone.

=== In Lawrence&#x27;s own words ===

Lawrence summarised the plot in a letter to Edward Garnett on 19 November 1912:

: It follows this idea: a woman of character and refinement goes into the lower class, and has no satisfaction in her own life. She has had a passion for her husband, so her children are born of passion, and have heaps of vitality. But as her sons grow up she selects them as lovers – first the eldest, then the second. These sons are &quot;urged&quot; into life by their reciprocal love of their mother – urged on and on. But when they come to manhood, they can&#x27;t love, because their mother is the strongest power in their lives, and holds them. It&#x27;s rather like Goethe and his mother and Frau von Stein and Christiana – As soon as the young men come into contact with women, there&#x27;s a split. William gives his sex to a fritter, and his mother holds his soul. But the split kills him, because he doesn&#x27;t know where he is. The next son gets a woman who fights for his soul – fights his mother. The son loves his mother – all the sons hate and are jealous of the father. The conflict goes on between the mother and the girl with the son as object. The mother gradually proves stronger, because of the ties of blood. The son decides to leave his soul in his mother&#x27;s hands, and, like his elder brother, go for passion. He gets passion. Then the split begins to tell again. But, almost unconsciously, the mother realises what is the matter, and begins to die. The son casts off his mistress, attends to his mother dying. He is left in the end naked of everything, with the drift towards death.

==Literary significance and criticism==

Jenny Turner described &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; as a semi-autobiographical work in &quot;The Sexual Imagination from Acker to Zola: A Feminist Companion&quot; (1993). She maintained that it showed both &quot;great candor&quot; and &quot;much self-pity&quot;. The critic Harold Bloom listed &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; as one of the books that have been important and influential in Western culture in &quot;The Western Canon&quot; (1994). In 1999, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; ninth on a list of the 100 best novels in English of the 20th century.

The novel contains a frequently quoted use of the English dialect word &quot;nesh&quot;. The speech of several protagonists is represented in Lawrence&#x27;s written interpretation of the Nottinghamshire dialect, which also features in several of his poems.

==Film, TV and theatrical adaptations==

&quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; has been adapted for the screen several times including the Academy Award winning 1960 film, a 1981 BBC TV serial and another on ITV1 in 2003. The 2003 serial has been issued on DVD by Acorn Media UK.

<text>The Sundowners is a 1960 Technicolor comedy-drama film that tells the story of a 1920s Australian outback family torn between the father&#x27;s desires to continue his nomadic sheep-herding ways and the wife and son&#x27;s desire to settle in one place. &quot;The Sundowners&quot; was produced and directed by Fred Zinnemann, adapted by Isobel Lennart from Jon Cleary&#x27;s 1952 novel of the same name, with Deborah Kerr, Robert Mitchum, and Peter Ustinov, Glynis Johns, Mervyn Johns, Dina Merrill, Michael Anderson Jr., and Chips Rafferty.

In 2019, FilmInk cited it among &quot;50 meat pie Westerns&quot;.

At the 33rd Academy Awards, it was in the running for Best Picture, and Kerr was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role, Johns for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, Zinnemann for Best Director, and Lennart for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, with no Academy wins.

==Plot==
Irish-Australian Paddy Carmody (Robert Mitchum) is a sheep drover and shearer, roving the sparsely populated outback with his wife Ida (Deborah Kerr) and son Sean (Michael Anderson, Jr.). They are sundowners, constantly moving, pitching their tent whenever the sun goes down. Ida and Sean want to settle, but Paddy has wanderlust and never wants to stay in one place for long. While passing through the bush, the family meet refined Englishman Rupert Venneker (Peter Ustinov) and hire him to help drive a large herd of sheep to the town of Cawndilla. Along the way, they survive a dangerous bushfire.

Mrs. Firth (Glynis Johns), who runs the pub in Cawndilla, takes a liking to Rupert. He takes to spending nights with her, but like Paddy, he has no desire to be tied down.

Ida convinces Paddy to take a job at a station shearing sheep; she serves as the cook, Rupert as a wool roller, and Sean as a tar boy. Ida enjoys the company of Jean Halstead (Dina Merrill), their employer&#x27;s lonely wife. When fellow shearer Bluey Brown&#x27;s (John Meillon) pregnant wife Liz (Lola Brooks) arrives unannounced, she sees the young woman through her first birth.

Ida is saving the money the family earns for a down payment on a farm that they stayed at for a night on the sheep drive. Although Paddy has agreed to participate in a shearing contest against someone from a rival group, he decides to leave six weeks into the shearing season. Ida persuades him to stay. He loses the contest to an old veteran.

Paddy wins a lot of money and a racehorse playing two-up. Owning such an animal has been his longstanding dream. They name him Sundowner and enter him, with Sean as his jockey, at local races on their travels after the shearing is done. Sean and Sundowner win their first race.

Ida finally convinces a still reluctant Paddy to buy the farm on which Sean and she have their hearts set, but he loses all the money Ida saved in a single night of playing two-up. By way of apology, he tells her that he has found a buyer for Sundowner if he wins the next race. The money would recoup their down payment. Although Sundowner wins, he is disqualified for interference, and the deal falls through. Nevertheless, Paddy&#x27;s deep remorse heals the breach with Ida, and they resolve to save enough to buy a farm one day.

==Production==
Fred Zinnemann decided to make the film at the suggestion of Dorothy Hammerstein, the Australian-born, second wife of Oscar Hammerstein II. She intended to send him a copy of the novel &quot;The Shiralee&quot; (later filmed with Peter Finch), but accidentally sent a copy of &quot;The Sundowners&quot;. He immediately bought the screen rights and decided to produce it himself. According to Zinnemann&#x27;s autography, Aaron Spelling was signed to write the screenplay, but was replaced by Isobel Lennart; another source states the screenplay was mostly written by Jon Cleary in spite of Lennart&#x27;s screen credit. The ending of the film was a tribute to John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;. Gary Cooper was hired to play Paddy Carmody, but had to leave due to poor health. He was replaced by Robert Mitchum, who agreed to work on the film for a chance to appear with Deborah Kerr, with whom he had become good friends while making &quot;Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison&quot;. He also agreed to give her top billing, joking to the production team that they could &quot;design a 24-foot sign of me bowing to her if you like&quot;. Michael Anderson, Jr. was imported from England to play their son.

Zinnemann was determined to film &quot;The Sundowners&quot; on location and vetoed Jack L. Warner&#x27;s plan to shoot in Arizona or near Dallas, Texas to save money. Interiors were shot at Associated British Picture Corporation Elstree Studios in England; exteriors were shot in Australia in Carriewerloo, Cooma, Hawker, Iron Knob, Jindabyne, Nimmitabel, Port Augusta, Quorn, and Whyalla. The &quot;for-sale&quot; property in the film was called Hiawatha and was on the Snowy River, just north of Old Jindabyne (now under the waters of Lake Jindabyne).

It was part of a &quot;mini boom&quot; of foreign productions in Australia in the late 1950s. Filming began in 1959. Zinnemann spent 12 weeks filming scenery and sheep droving before the cast arrived in October. The weather made location filming difficult, fluctuating from hot and humid to cold and rainy. This delayed production by several weeks and caused some irritation among the cast and crew. Mitchum was often harassed by fans and eventually moved onto a boat to avoid them. Filming wrapped on 17 December 1959. A number of Australian actors appeared in the supporting cast.

Ray Austin was the stunt coordinator. Nicolas Roeg, who later directed films such as &quot;Walkabout&quot;, was a second unit camera operator.

==Reception==
When the movie premiered at the Radio City Music Hall, Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film an &quot;especially appropriate entertainment for the Christmas holidays&quot;; according to Crowther:
What is nice about these people and valid about this film, is that they have an abundance of freshness, openness, and vitality. The action scenes are dynamic—the scenes of driving sheep, shearing them, racing horses at a genuine &#x27;bush country&#x27; track, and simply living happily in the great sky-covered outdoors. And the scenes of human involvements—those between the husband and the wife, of a woman having a baby, of a footloose housewife looking at a stove—are deeply and poignantly revealing of how good and sensitive people can be.

&quot;The Sundowners&quot;, marketed as a &quot;newer version&quot; of &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, was a financial failure in the United States. The film reached the top 10 at the UK box office and was the third-highest grossing film of 1961 in Australia.

<doc id="92706" wikidata="Q148204" url="?curid=92706" title="Heaven's Gate (film)">
<text>Heaven&#x27;s Gate is a 1980 American epic Western film written and directed by Michael Cimino, starring Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken, John Hurt, Sam Waterston, Brad Dourif, Isabelle Huppert, Jeff Bridges, and Joseph Cotten, and loosely based on the Johnson County War. It revolves around a dispute between land barons and European immigrants of modest means in Wyoming in the 1890s.

The film&#x27;s production faced numerous setbacks, including cost overruns, significant retakes, bad press (including allegations of animal abuse on set), and rumors about Cimino&#x27;s allegedly authoritarian directorial style. Cimino had an expensive and ambitious vision for the film, pushing it nearly four times over its planned budget.

The film premiered in November 1980 and received significant critical backlash, prompting United Artists to pull it from theaters. In April 1981, a truncated re-cut version was released, though it remained a financial failure, earning only $3.5 million against its $44 million budget and was lambasted by critics. It was subsequently condemned as one of the worst films ever made at the time. According to some film historians such as Peter Biskind, the film&#x27;s financial failure resulted in the demise of director-driven film production in the American film industry, steering back toward greater studio control of films. The film&#x27;s failure also led to Transamerica selling United Artists to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, ending their existence as an independent studio.

In the decades since the release, however, general assessment of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; has become more favorable. The 1981 re-edit has been characterized as &quot;one of the greatest injustices of cinematic history&quot;, while later re-edits have received critical acclaim. In 2015, BBC Culture ranked &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; 98th on its list of the 100 greatest American films of all time.

== Plot ==

In 1870, two young men, Jim Averill and Billy Irvine, graduate from Harvard College. The Reverend Doctor speaks to the graduates on the association of &quot;the cultivated mind with the uncultivated&quot; and the importance of education. Irvine, the class orator, follows this with his opposing, irreverent views. A celebration is then held, after which the male students serenade the women present, including Averill&#x27;s girlfriend.

Twenty years later, Averill is passing through the booming town of Casper, Wyoming, on his way north to Johnson County, where he is now a marshal. Poor European immigrants new to the region are in conflict with wealthy, established cattle barons organized as the Wyoming Stock Growers Association; they suspect the newcomers of stealing their cattle for food. Nate Championa friend of Averill and an enforcer for the stockmenkills a settler for suspected rustling and dissuades another from stealing a cow.

At a board meeting, the head of the Association, Frank Canton, tells members, including a drunk Irvine, of plans to kill 125 named settlers, as thieves and anarchists, with the help of the cruel Major Wolcott. Irvine leaves the meeting, encounters Averill, and tells him of the Association&#x27;s plans. As Averill leaves, he exchanges bitter words with Canton. Canton and Averill come to blows and Canton is knocked to the floor. That night, Canton recruits men to kill the named settlers.

Ellen Watson, a Johnson County bordello madam from Quebec who accepts stolen cattle as payment for use of her prostitutes, is infatuated with both Averill and Champion. Averill and Watson skate in a crowd, then dance alone, in an enormous roller skating rink called &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, which has been built by local entrepreneur John L. Bridges. Averill receives a copy of the Association&#x27;s death list from Minardi, a baseball-playing U.S. Army captain, and later reads the names aloud to the settlers, who are thrown into terrified turmoil. Cully, a station master and friend of Averill&#x27;s, sees the train with Canton&#x27;s posse heading north and rides off to warn the settlers but is murdered &quot;en route&quot;. Later, a group of men come to Watson&#x27;s bordello, slaughter her workers, and rape her. Averill shoots and kills all but one of them. Champion, realizing that his landowner bosses seek to eliminate Watson, goes to Canton&#x27;s camp and shoots Morrison, the remaining rapist, then refuses to participate in the slaughter.

Canton, Wolcott and their men encounter one of Champion&#x27;s friends leaving a cabin with Champion and his friend Nick Ray inside, and a gunfight ensues. Attempting to save Champion, Watson arrives in her wagon and shoots one of the hired guns before escaping on horseback. Nick is killed before Canton&#x27;s men push a burning cart towards the cabin, setting it on fire. Champion writes a last letter to Ella before emerging from the burning cabin shooting at Canton&#x27;s men but is killed by a hail of bullets. Watson warns the settlers of Canton&#x27;s approach at another huge, chaotic gathering at &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate.&quot; The coward mayor of the county, Charlie Lezak, proposes to deliver the people on the list peacefully, while the young pharmacist Mr. Eggleston claims that the only way to survive is to brace the weapons and fight the enemy army. The agitated settlers approve Eggleston&#x27;s idea, and they rush to battle with Bridges and Ella leading them. With the hired invaders now surrounded, both sides suffer casualties (including a drunken, poetic Irvine) as Canton leaves to bring help. Watson and Averill return to Champion&#x27;s charred and smoking cabin, and discover his corpse, along with a handwritten letter documenting his last minutes alive.

The next day, Averill reluctantly joins the immigrant settlers, with their cobbled-together siege machines and explosive charges, in an attack against Wolcott&#x27;s men and their makeshift fortifications. The battle is fiercer and more desperate. Despite the heavy losses that the immigrants suffer, including Eggleston himself, they manage to inflict a huge number of casualties on the mercenaries&#x27; army. Wolcott himself, while trying to escape, is killed by Averill, who hits him with an explosive charge. Before the settlers manage to wipe out the enemies, the US Army shows up with Canton and Minardi, thus stopping the battle. The mercenaries are put under arrest, though Averill is aware that this is just a facade to save them and make them avoid a criminal charge. Later, at Watson&#x27;s cabin, Bridges, Watson, and Averill prepare to leave for good, but they are ambushed by Canton and two others. Averill and Bridges shoot and kill Canton and one of his men but both Bridges and Watson are killed. A grief-stricken Averill holds Watson&#x27;s body in his arms.

In 1903, about a decade later, a well-dressed, beardless, but older-looking Averill walks the deck of his yacht off Newport, Rhode Island. He goes below, where an attractive middle-aged woman is sleeping in a luxurious boudoir. The woman, Averill&#x27;s old Harvard girlfriend (perhaps now his wife), awakens and asks him for a cigarette. Silently he complies, lighting the cigarette and returning to the deck.

== Cast ==

In addition, musician Ronnie Hawkins appears in the first of his few acting roles, as Major Wolcott; the film&#x27;s composer David Mansfield appears onscreen as John DeCory, the leader of the Heaven&#x27;s Gate Band and an employee of Ella; Rosie Vela (credited as Roseanne Vela) appears as the &quot;Beautiful Girl&quot; whom Averill falls for at Harvard; future Golden Globe winner and Academy Award nominee Mickey Rourke appears in his second-ever screen role as Nick Ray; and future multi-Academy Award nominee Willem Dafoe makes his first, uncredited, screen appearance as Willy.

==Production==
===Historical basis===
The basic plot elements of the film were inspired by Wyoming&#x27;s 1892 Johnson County War, the archetypal cattlemen–homesteaders conflict, which also served as the background for &quot;Shane&quot; and &quot;The Virginian&quot;. Most of the film&#x27;s principal characters bear the names of figures in the war but the events portrayed in &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; bear little resemblance to historical events.

====Inaccuracies====
Homesteaders began to settle northern Wyoming in the 1890s, claiming land under the Homestead Acts, but there were no hordes of starving European immigrants killing rich men&#x27;s cattle to feed their families, as depicted in the film. Nate Champion is portrayed as a murderer and &quot;enforcer&quot; for the stockmen, but he was a popular small rancher in Johnson County, nicknamed &quot;king of the rustlers&quot; by the stockmen because he resisted their tactic of claiming all unbranded young cattle as their own.

Jim Averell was another homesteader who lived about southwest of Johnson County. Two years before the invasion began, he and his wife Ellen Watson were murdered by stockmen, who falsely accused Watson of exchanging sexual favors for stolen cattle. There is no evidence that Watson was a bordello madam, as portrayed in the film, nor that Watson or Averell ever knew Nate Champion.

===Screenplay===
In 1971, film director Michael Cimino submitted an original script for &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (then called &quot;The Johnson County War&quot;), but the project was shelved when it failed to attract big-name talent, including John Wayne, who turned down the lead role. A third version of the script was submitted to 20th Century Fox before the release of &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;. His directorial debut, &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot; (1974), was a hit. In 1979, on the eve of winning two Academy Awards (Best Director and Best Picture) for 1978&#x27;s &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, Cimino convinced United Artists to resurrect the &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; project with Kris Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert, and Christopher Walken as the main characters. He was given an initial budget of $11.6 million, but was also provided with carte blanche. Cimino&#x27;s girlfriend, Joann Carelli, was hired to produce the film.

===Filming===
Cimino and his friends searched through 20,000 miles of land for scenery for the film. Principal photography began on April 16, 1979, in Glacier National Park, east of Kalispell, Montana, with the majority of the town scenes filmed in the Two Medicine area, north of the village of East Glacier Park. Shooting also included the town of Wallace, Idaho. Harvard University refused to allow the film to be shot there, reportedly because of Cimino&#x27;s excessive demands for the film set, and the film&#x27;s prologue was instead shot at the University of Oxford. The project had a December 14 projected release date and $11.6 million budget, and promptly fell behind schedule.

===Production issues===
According to legend, by the sixth day of filming the project was already five days behind schedule.

====Cimino demands perfection====
Kristofferson compared Cimino to Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. Steven Bach compared him to Michelangelo and said that &quot;I am confident we&#x27;ll make our money back on it&quot;. As an example of Cimino&#x27;s fanatical attention to detail, a street built to his precise specifications had to be torn down and rebuilt because it reportedly &quot;didn&#x27;t look right.&quot; The street in question needed to be wider; the set construction boss said it would be cheaper to tear down one side and move it back six feet, but Cimino insisted that both sides be dismantled and moved back , then reassembled. An entire tree was cut down, moved in pieces, and relocated to the courtyard in Oxford, England where the Harvard 1870 graduation scene was shot. Cimino had an irrigation system built under the land where the major battlefield scene would unfold so that it would remain vividly green, to contrast with the red color.

Cimino shot more than 1.3 million feet (400,000 metres; nearly 220 hours) of footage, costing the studio approximately $200,000 per day in salary (equivalent to $720,000 in 2022), locations and acting fees. Privately, it was joked that Cimino wished to surpass Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s mark of shooting one million feet of footage for &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979).

Cimino&#x27;s obsessive behavior soon earned him the nickname &quot;The Ayatollah&quot;. Production fell behind schedule as rumors spread of Cimino&#x27;s demanding up to 50 takes of individual scenes and delaying filming until a cloud that he liked rolled into the frame. As a result of the delays, several musicians originally brought to Montana to work on the film for only three weeks ended up stranded, waiting to be called for shoots to materialize. The experience, as the Associated Press put it, &quot;was both stunningly boring and a raucous good time, full of jam sessions, strange adventures and curiously little actual shooting.&quot; The jam sessions served as the beginning of numerous musical collaborations between Bridges and Kristofferson. John Williams turned down the chance to compose the score for the film, which eventually went to David Mansfield.

As production staggered forward, United Artists seriously considered firing Cimino and replacing him with another director, implied in the book &quot;Final Cut&quot; to be Norman Jewison.

Actor John Hurt reportedly spent so long waiting around on the production for something to do that he went off and made &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1980) for David Lynch in the interim, and then came back to shoot more scenes on &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;.

====Filming completes====
&quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; finished shooting in March 1980, having cost nearly $30 million. Reportedly, during post-production Cimino changed the lock to the studio&#x27;s editing room, prohibiting executives from seeing the film until he completed his cut, although Cimino disputed this story. Working with Oscar-winning editor William H. Reynolds, Cimino worked doggedly over his project.

===Post-production===
On June 26, 1980, Cimino previewed a workprint for executives at United Artists that reportedly ran five hours and twenty-five minutes (325 minutes), which Cimino said was &quot;about 15 minutes longer than the final cut would be.&quot;

The executives flatly refused to release the film at that length and once again contemplated firing Cimino. However, Cimino promised them he could re-edit the film and spent the entire summer and fall of 1980 doing so, finally paring it down to its original premiere length of three hours and 39 minutes (219 minutes). The original wide-release opening on Christmas of 1979 had come and gone, so UA and Cimino finally set up a release date of November 1980.

==Release==
United Artists spent $1.5 million advertising the film during the three weeks before its premiere. During an intermission at the film&#x27;s November 19, 1980, premiere at the New York Cinema 1 theater, the audience was so subdued that Cimino was said to have asked why no one was drinking the champagne. He was reportedly told by his publicist, &quot;Because they hate the movie, Michael.&quot; After a sparsely attended one-week run, Cimino and United Artists quickly pulled the film from any further releases, completely postponing a full worldwide release. On April 24, 1981, the film opened in 810 theatres in a &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot;, a two-hour-and-twenty-nine minute (149 minute) version that Cimino had recut for a third time.

===Box office===
Following a brief theatrical release in November 1980, during which the film was poorly received by critics, United Artists decided to pull the film from theaters, re-releasing it in April 1981 in a truncated cut. Despite the efforts to capitalize on the film with a re-release, it was a significant financial failure, earning $3.5 million domestically against its $44 million budget. The film grossed $1.3 million in its opening weekend and closed after the second week, having grossed only $3.5 million against its $44 million budget. The film is considered one of the biggest box office bombs of all time. Bach claimed that the film needed to make $140 million () to break even.

===Critical response===

The initial critical reception to the film was almost universally and fiercely negative. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Vincent Canby panned the film, calling it &quot;something quite rare in movies these days - an unqualified disaster,&quot; comparing it to &quot;a forced four-hour walking tour of one&#x27;s own living room.&quot; Canby went even further by stating that &quot;[i]t fails so completely that you might suspect Mr. Cimino sold his soul to the devil to obtain the success of &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; and the Devil has just come around to collect.&quot;

Reviewing the shorter cut in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert criticized the film&#x27;s formal choices and its narrative inconsistencies and incredulities, concluding that the film was &quot;[t]he most scandalous cinematic waste I have ever seen, and remember, I&#x27;ve seen &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot;.&quot; He also heavily criticized the cinematography, calling the film one of the ugliest he&#x27;d ever seen. Ebert stated that he was initially in disbelief over the vast negative reception from critics but admitted after seeing the film that &quot;it was as bad as everybody said.&quot; On &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;, Ebert&#x27;s co-host Gene Siskel, who saw both the original and shorter cut, also panned the film calling it a &quot;turkey&quot; and pinpointed the film&#x27;s failure on the illogical character choices. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; issued a dissenting opinion when he reviewed the shortened film, becoming one of its few American champions and calling it &quot;a true screen epic&quot; while stating that in two decades as a critic, he had never felt &quot;so totally alone.&quot; Thomas&#x27; paper actually had its former lead film critic and editor come out of retirement to write a thoroughly negative front-page review of the movie for its Arts section, and moved Thomas&#x27; positive review to an interior page of that section.

In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; placed the film on a list of the 100 worst ideas of the 20th century.

Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2008, Joe Queenan declared &quot;Heaven’s Gate&quot; the worst film made up to that time. “This is a movie that destroyed the director&#x27;s career,” he wrote. “This is a movie that lost so much money it literally drove a major American studio out of business. This is a movie about Harvard-educated gunslingers who face off against eastern European sodbusters in an epic struggle for the soul of America. This is a movie that stars Isabelle Huppert as a shotgun-toting cowgirl. This is a movie in which Jeff Bridges pukes while mounted on roller skates. This is a movie that has five minutes of uninterrupted fiddle-playing by a fiddler who is also mounted on roller skates. This is a movie that defies belief.”

&quot;The Verge&quot; said: &quot;Based on 30 years of critical assessment, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; stands as one of the worst movies ever made. That&#x27;s not an exaggeration&quot;.

====Reassessments and legacy====
In subsequent years, some critics have come to the film&#x27;s defense, beginning with European critics who praised it after the film played at the Cannes Film Festival. Robin Wood was an early champion of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; and its reassessment, calling it &quot;one of the few authentically innovative Hollywood films ... It seems to me, in its original version, among the supreme achievements of the Hollywood cinema.&quot; David Thomson calls the film &quot;a wounded monster&quot; and argues that it takes part in &quot;a rich American tradition (Melville, James, Ives, Pollock, Parker) that seeks a mighty dispersal of what has gone before. In America, there are great innovations in art that suddenly create fields of apparent emptiness. They may seem like omissions or mistakes at first. Yet in time we come to see them as meant for our exploration.&quot; Martin Scorsese has said that the film has many overlooked virtues. Some of these critics have attempted to impugn the motives of the earliest reviewers. Robin Wood noted, in his initial review of the film, reviewers tended to pile on the film, attempting to &quot;outdo [each] other with sarcasm and contempt.&quot; Several members of the cast and crew have complained that the initial reviews of the film were tainted by its production history and that daily critics were reviewing it as a business story as much as a motion picture. In April 2011, the staff of &quot;Time Out London&quot; selected &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; as the 12th greatest Western of all time. While Peter Biskind covered the many excesses and problems with the movie in his book &quot;Easy Riders, Raging Bulls&quot;, he also noted that &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; was not dissimilar to other big-budget, troubled projects of the late 1970s and early 1980s (such as Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;1941&quot; and Warren Beatty&#x27;s &quot;Reds&quot;), and that the backlash against &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; could have easily been directed elsewhere. Biskind speculated that Michael Cimino&#x27;s personal unpopularity was the main reason this film became so widely reviled. Philip French praised the film in his original review.

In 2012, the film was re-released to &quot;soak up acclaim&quot; as a 216-minute &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; at the 69th Venice Film Festival. on August 30 in the presence of Cimino, followed one month later by screening at the New York Film Festival in the &quot;Masterwork&quot; lineup, along with Laurence Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; and Frank Oz&#x27;s director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;. It was then shown at the Festival Lumière in France, where Venice Festival director Alberto Barbera described the film as an &quot;absolute masterpiece&quot; that had disappeared, and whose 1980 cutting was characterized as a &quot;massacre&quot; by nervous producers and had been &quot;one of the greatest injustices of cinematic history&quot; that had destroyed careers (Cimino and Kristofferson) following &quot;annihilat[ing]&quot; critical reviews.

In March 2013, the new director&#x27;s cut was again featured back in New York City in a week-long run screening at the Film Forum. Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Manohla Dargis said of the restoration that it &quot;looks good projected, if surprisingly bright&quot;, and &quot;it also appears to be an act of directorial revisionism.&quot; Of the film itself she writes: &quot;The film’s scope, natural backdrops, massive sets, complex choreography and cinematography are seductive, at times stunning, and if you like watching swirling people and cameras, you may love it.&quot;

An article by Nicholas Barber on the BBC website in December 2015 traced the history of the critical reception of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; and concludes: &quot;so much of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; is patently splendid that it is mind-boggling that anyone could pronounce it an &#x27;unqualified disaster&#x27;. And the scenes which were slammed in 1980 as being symptomatic of waste and excess – the Harvard waltz, the massed rollerskating – are the scenes which take your breath away.&quot; Reflecting on the depicted negative attitudes to immigrants, he writes: &quot;However unwelcome &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; may have been in 1980, there hasn&#x27;t been a more urgently topical film in 2015.&quot; The film holds a 57% score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 47 reviews with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; contains too many ideas and striking spectacle to be a disaster, but this western buckles under the weight of its own sprawl.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;average or mixed reviews&quot;.

==Controversies==
===Effect on the U.S. film industry===
The film&#x27;s $44 million cost ($ million in dollars) and poor performance at the box office ($3.5 million gross in the United States) generated more negative publicity than actual financial damage, causing Transamerica Corporation, United Artists&#x27; corporate owner, to become anxious over its own public image and to abandon film production altogether. In 1981, Transamerica sold United Artists to Kirk Kerkorian, who also owned Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which effectively ended United Artists&#x27; existence as an independent studio. United Artists has since been a subsidiary of MGM. While the money lost due to &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; was considerable, United Artists was still a thriving studio with a steady income provided by the James Bond, Pink Panther and Rocky franchises. On the other hand, United Artists was already struggling after an executive walkout in 1978 and several other major box office flops in 1980, including &quot;Cruising&quot;, &quot;Foxes&quot;, and &quot;Roadie&quot;.

The fracas had a wider effect on the American film industry. During the 1970s, relatively young directors such as Coppola, Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich, George Lucas, William Friedkin and Steven Spielberg had been given large budgets with very little studio control (see New Hollywood). However, the directors&#x27; power lessened considerably as a result of disappointing box-office performers such as Friedkin&#x27;s &quot;Sorcerer&quot; (1977) and &quot;Cruising&quot; (1980), Coppola&#x27;s &quot;One from the Heart,&quot; and Cimino&#x27;s &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;. The studios ultimately shifted focus from director-driven films and adopted high-concept features, epitomized by &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; (both released before &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;). As the new high-concept paradigm of filmmaking became more entrenched, studio control of budgets and productions became tighter, ending the free-wheeling excesses that had begotten &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;.

=== Accusations of cruelty to animals ===
The film was marred by accusations of cruelty to animals during production. The American Humane Association (AHA), barred from monitoring the animals on set, issued press releases detailing the abuses and organized boycott picket lines. The outcry prompted the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) to contractually authorize the AHA to monitor the use of all animals in all filmed media afterward.

One assertion was that steers were bled from the neck without giving them pain killers so that their blood could be collected and smeared upon the actors in a scene. The AHA asserted that four horses were killed and many more injured during a battle scene. It has been claimed that in said scene as shown in the final film, one of the horses was blown up with dynamite.

According to the AHA, the owner of an abused horse filed a lawsuit against the producers, director, Partisan Productions and the horse wrangler. The owner cited wrongful injury and breach of contract for willfully depriving her Arabian gelding of proper care. The suit cited &quot;the severe physical and behavioral trauma and disfigurement&quot; of the horse. The case was settled out of court.

There were accusations of actual cockfights, decapitated chickens, and a group of cows disemboweled to provide &quot;fake intestines&quot; for the actors.

The film is listed on AHA&#x27;s list of unacceptable films. The AHA protested the film by distributing an international press release detailing the assertions of animal cruelty and asking people to boycott it. AHA organized picket lines outside movie theaters in Hollywood while local humane societies did the same across the USA. Though &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; was not the first film to have animals killed during its production, it is believed that the film was largely responsible for sparking the now-common use of the &quot;No animals were harmed ...&quot; disclaimer and more rigorous supervision of animal acts by the AHA, which had been inspecting film production since the 1940s. This is also one of the films to not have the end credit disclaimer.

The UK Blu-ray release from Second Sight Films removes about a minute of footage relating to cockfights and animal cruelty. Prior video releases removed about a minute and fourteen seconds of the cruelty.

===Workprint cut, premiere cut and an alternative cut===
Notwithstanding the 325-minute &quot;workprint&quot; cut shown to executives in June 1980, Cimino had rushed through post-production and editing to meet his contractual requirements to United Artists, and to qualify for the 1980 Academy Awards. The version screened at the November 1980 premiere ran three hours and 39 minutes. Bridges joked that Cimino had worked on the film so close to the premiere that the print screened was still wet from the lab.

After the aborted one-week premiere run in New York, Cimino and United Artists pulled the film; Cimino wrote an open letter to the studio that was printed in several trade papers blaming unrealistic deadline pressures for the film&#x27;s failure. United Artists reportedly also hired its own editor to try to edit Cimino&#x27;s footage into a releasable film with no real success.

Ultimately, Cimino&#x27;s second edited version, a 149-minute version, premiered in April 1981 and was the only cut of the film screened in wide release. The original negative for the longer version no longer exists because it was directly edited for the 149-minute version (YCM separation masters of the longer version were used as the source for the Criterion Collection release). This cut of the film is not just shorter but differs radically in the placement of scenes and selection of takes. This version, after leaving theaters, was not released on home video of any kind in the United States but was later released on DVD in France (&quot;la Porte du Paradis&quot;). This version has also aired on the MGM HD cable channel and was available free-with-ads on US streaming provider Tubi from March to November 2017.

In 1982, Z Channel aired the 219-minute 1980 premiere version of the film on cable television – the first time that the longer version was widely exhibited – and which Z Channel dubbed the &quot;director&#x27;s cut.&quot; As critic F.X. Feeney noted in the documentary &quot;Z Channel: A Magnificent Obsession&quot;, Z Channel&#x27;s broadcast of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; first popularized the concept of a &quot;director&#x27;s cut.&quot;

When MGM (which acquired the rights to United Artists&#x27;s catalog after its demise) released the film on VHS and videodisc in the 1980s, it released Cimino&#x27;s 219-minute cut with the tagline &quot;&quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; ... The Legendary Uncut Version.&quot; Subsequent releases on LaserDisc and DVD have contained only the 219-minute cut.

Due to the wide availability of the 219-minute 1980 premiere version of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; and its frequent labeling as either &quot;uncut&quot; or the &quot;director&#x27;s cut,&quot; Cimino insisted that the so-called &quot;original version&quot; did not fully correspond to his intentions and that he was under pressure to bring it out for the predetermined date and did not consider the film ready, making even the 219-minute version essentially an &quot;unfinished&quot; film.

The 216-minute version shown in Venice is quite similar to the 219-minute version, but with no intermission. Some shots in the second part are slightly shorter and a shot with a single line has been cut (just after John Hurt is beaten by Sam Waterston).

===149-minute cut===
In the 149-minute version of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; released in 1981, the following scenes are cut:
* Irvine&#x27;s speech at the Harvard graduation
* The co-ed circle dancing immediately following graduation
* Averill beating up the brute enforcer (who beats up the immigrant in front of his wife and children)
* Averill passing the beaten man&#x27;s widow in the carriage, asking her how she&#x27;s doing
* The spitting fight between the two immigrant landowners in the cockfight scene
* The entire roller skating dance scene
* A shot of female immigrants carrying a load up the hill
* Champion almost shooting the stock grower that insults Ella Watson
* The scene where Ella Watson first leaves Champion to return to Averill
* The introductory part of the scene where Averill reads the names on the &quot;death list&quot; (the edited version starts with John Bridges firing the gun in the air, to restore order)
* Averill weeping to Bridges that he &quot;hates getting old,&quot; while looking at the old photo of himself and his girlfriend
* The immigrants being informed that Averill quit his post, and Watson warning them the stock growers have arrived
* The last five or so minutes of the second battle scene, including the footage of the character crushed under the wagon and the woman killing him in mercy
* That same woman killing herself after the battle, and Bridges and Averill surveying the carnage
* Any reference to the woman on the boat, presumably Averill&#x27;s girlfriend or wife, from the end of the film

===2005 radical cut===
In 2005, MGM released the film in selected cinemas in the United States and Europe. The 219-minute cut was reassembled by MGM archivist John Kirk, who reported that large portions of the original negative had been discarded, making this an all-new radical version using whatever alternative available scenes that could be found. The restored print was screened in Paris and presented to a sold-out audience at New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art with a live introduction by Isabelle Huppert. Because the project was commissioned by then-MGM executive Bingham Ray, who was ousted shortly thereafter, the budget for the project was cut and a planned wider release and DVD never materialized, with the project since being abandoned altogether.

===2012 digitally restored Director&#x27;s Cut===
In 2012, MGM released yet another version, digitally restored and 216 minutes long. It premiered at the 2012 Venice Film Festival as part of the Venice Classics series.

The Criterion Collection released the restored 216-minute version on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on November 20, 2012. This &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; was personally supervised by Michael Cimino and Joann Carelli. Cimino explains in the special features portion of the DVD that this is his preferred version of the film, and he feels it is the complete version he intended to make.

=== 2014 Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;The Butcher&#x27;s Cut&quot; ===
On April 21, 2014, director, cinematographer, and editor Steven Soderbergh released an unofficial alternate cut of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; via his website extension765.com, under his pseudonym Mary Ann Bernard. Soderbergh&#x27;s version, which runs 108 minutes, is dubbed &quot;The Butcher&#x27;s Cut&quot;.

<doc id="92707" wikidata="Q1250282" url="?curid=92707" title="Fanny (name)">
<text>Fanny is a feminine given name. It originated as a diminutive of the English given name Frances or the French Françoise, both meaning &quot;free one&quot; and of the Spanish name &quot;Estefanía&quot; and the French name Stéphanie both meaning &quot;crown.”

Fanny was a popular independent given name as well as a diminutive of other popular names in the 1700s and 1800s. Usage of the name has been steadily declining in the Anglosphere since the end of the 19th century. In British English, fanny has been a vulgar slang term for vagina or vulva since the 1830s. In American English, fanny is a slang term for the buttocks that has been in use since World War I. In New Zealand, the Registrar of Births will no longer accept the name for a baby&#x27;s birth certificate because the name might be considered offensive.

The name Fanny or Fannie has remained well-used in other languages and other countries. In the United States, the name Fanny and the spelling variant Fannie are still well used by the Amish cultural group, who speak Pennsylvania Dutch. The name also remains in regular use in other countries, including France, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden.

The Inuit believed that Nanook, the polar bear, was powerful and mighty, and they thought that he was &quot;almost man.&quot; The Inuit hunters would worship this great bear because they believed that he decided if the hunters would be successful. “In the past, the Inuit ate polar bear meat and used the fur to make warm trousers for men and kamiks (soft boots) for women”. Respect was given to Nanook by the hunter hanging the bear&#x27;s hide in a special section of his igloo, where it would stay for several days. They would also offer the bear&#x27;s spirit weapons and other hunting tools if it was a male, and needle cases, scrapers (used to scrape the fat off hides) and knives if it was female. “Native people believed that polar bears allowed themselves to be killed in order to obtain the souls of the tools (tatkoit), which they would take with them into the hereafter.” “Legend says that if a dead polar bear was treated properly by the hunter, it would share the good news with other bears so they would be eager to be killed by him. Bears would stay away from hunters who failed to pay respect.”

<doc id="92715" wikidata="Q309545" url="?curid=92715" title="Judgment at Nuremberg">
<text>Judgment at Nuremberg is a 1961 American epic legal drama film directed and produced by Stanley Kramer, and written by Abby Mann. It features Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Maximilian Schell, Werner Klemperer, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, William Shatner, and Montgomery Clift. Set in Nuremberg, West Germany, the film depicts a fictionalized versionwith fictional charactersof the Judges&#x27; Trial of 1947, one of the twelve Nuremberg Military Tribunals conducted under the auspices of the U.S. military in the aftermath of World War II.

The film centers on a military tribunal led by Chief Trial Judge Dan Haywood (Tracy), before which four judges and prosecutors (as compared to sixteen defendants in the actual Judges&#x27; Trial) stand accused of crimes against humanity due to their senior roles in the judicial system of the Nazi German government. The trial centers on questions regarding Germans&#x27; individual and collective responsibility for the Holocaust, with the backdrop of a tense international situation including the onset of the Cold War, the Berlin Blockade, and the geopolitical ramification of the later Nuremberg Trials upon German support for the Western Bloc, placing great pressure on Haywood&#x27;s efforts to reach a just verdict. In addition, the judge faces emotional challenges in his personal relationships with German people outside the courtroom who consistently claim ignorance of Nazi atrocities, but who the judge suspects may have known more than they will admit.

An earlier version of the story was broadcast as an episode of the same name of the television series &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; in 1959. Popular interest in this effort caused an expanded focus on its dramatic elements. Maximillian Schell and Werner Klemperer portrayed the same characters in both productions.

In 2013, &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The production&#x27;s presentation of historical events has attracted interest over decades before and since then due to its place in the narrative portrayals of the Holocaust in film.

== Plot ==
&quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; centers on a military tribunal convened in Nuremberg, Germany, in which four German judges and prosecutors stand accused of crimes against humanity for their involvement in atrocities committed under the Nazi regime.

Judge Dan Haywood is the chief judge of a three-judge panel of Allied jurists who will hear and decide the case against the defendants. Haywood is particularly interested in learning how the defendant Ernst Janning, a respected jurist and legal scholar, could have committed the atrocities he is accused of, including sentencing innocent people to death.

Haywood seeks to understand how the German people could have been deaf and blind to the Nazi regime&#x27;s crimes. In doing so, he befriends the widow of a German general who had been executed by the Allies. He talks with other Germans who have varying perspectives on the war.

Other characters the judge meets are US Army Captain Harrison Byers, who is assigned to assist the American judges hearing the case, and Irene Hoffmann, who is afraid to provide testimony that may bolster the prosecution&#x27;s case against the judges. (Hoffman&#x27;s character bears a resemblance to Irene Seiler, a key figure in the notorious Nazi kangaroo court case, the Katzenberger Trial.)

German defense attorney Hans Rolfe argues that the defendants were not the only ones to aid or ignore the Nazi regime. He claims the United States has committed acts just as bad or worse than the Nazis, such as US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.&#x27;s support for the first eugenics practices; the German-Vatican &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; of 1933, which the Nazi-dominated German government exploited as an implicit early foreign recognition of Nazi leadership; Joseph Stalin&#x27;s part in the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939, which removed the last major obstacle to Germany&#x27;s invasion and occupation of western Poland, initiating World War II; and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the final stage of the war in August 1945.

Meanwhile, as a strict constructionist jurist, Janning refuses to testify or participate in a legal proceeding that he profoundly feels is no better than a post-WWII Western kangaroo court of its own. As the proceeding becomes more and more intolerable to him, he dramatically breaks his silence. He chooses to testify before the Tribunal as a witness for the prosecution, admitting he is guilty of condemning to death a Jewish man of &quot;blood defilement&quot; charges — namely, that the man had sex with a 16-year-old Gentile girl — when he knew there was no evidence to support such a verdict. Janning explains that misled people such as him helped Adolf Hitler&#x27;s antisemitic, racist policies out of naive patriotism despite knowing it was wrong, and that all of Germany bears some measure of responsibility for the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime.

Haywood must weigh considerations of geopolitical expediency against his own ideals of justice. The trial is set against the background of the Berlin Blockade, and there is pressure to let the German defendants off lightly to gain German support in the growing Cold War against the Soviet Union.

While the four defendants maintain their pleas of &quot;not guilty&quot; in their closing statements, Janning and fellow defendant, Werner Lampe, show clear remorse for their actions, while a third, Friedrich Hofstetter, claims they had no choice but to execute the laws handed down by Hitler&#x27;s government. Only the fourth defendant, Emil Hahn, remains unrepentant, telling the Americans that they will live to regret not allying with the Nazis against the Soviet Union. Ultimately, all four defendants are found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.

German defense attorney Hans Rolfe meets Haywood after the trial to inform him on his estimation that no defendant will probably stay in prison for more than 5 years. Haywood replies that Rolfe&#x27;s position may be logical but without reverence for justice.

At Janning&#x27;s request, Haywood visits him in his prison cell. Janning affirms to Haywood that his verdict was a just one, but asks him to believe that, regarding the mass murder of innocents, he never knew that it would come to that. Judge Haywood replies it came to that the first time Janning condemned a man he knew to be innocent.

Haywood departs; a title card informs the audience that, of 99 defendants sentenced to prison terms in Nuremberg trials that took place in the American Zone, none was still serving a sentence when the film was released in 1961.

== Cast ==

== Production ==
=== Background ===
The film&#x27;s events relate principally to actions committed by the German state against its own racial, social, religious, and eugenic groupings within its &quot;in the name of the law&quot; (from the prosecution&#x27;s opening statement in the film), from the time of Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in 1933. The plot development and thematic treatment question the legitimacy of the social, political, and alleged legal foundations of these actions.

The real Judges&#x27; Trial focused on 16 judges and prosecutors who served before and during the Nazi regime in Germany, and who embraced and enforced laws—passively, actively, or both—that led to judicial acts of compulsory sexual sterilization and to the imprisonment and execution of people for their religions, racial or ethnic identities, political beliefs, and physical handicaps or disabilities.

A key thread in the film&#x27;s plot involves a &quot;race defilement&quot; trial known as the &quot;Feldenstein&quot; case. In this fictionalized case, based on the real life Katzenberger Trial, an elderly Jewish man had been tried for having a &quot;relationship&quot; (sexual acts) with an Aryan (German) 16-year-old girl, an act that had been legally defined as a crime under the Nuremberg Laws, which had been enacted by the German Reichstag. Under these laws, the man was found guilty and was put to death in 1942. Using this and other examples, the movie explores individual conscience, collective guilt, and behavior during a time of widespread societal immorality.

The film is notable for its use of courtroom drama to illuminate individual perfidy and moral compromise in times of violent political upheaval; it was the first mainstream drama film to not shy away from showing actual footage filmed by American and British soldiers after the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps. Shown in court by prosecuting attorney Colonel Tad Lawson (Richard Widmark), the scenes of huge piles of naked corpses laid out in rows and bulldozed into large pits were considered exceptionally graphic for a mainstream film of the time.

According to numerous sources, Tracy&#x27;s climactic monologue was filmed in one take using several cameras. Clift had trouble remembering his lines, so Kramer told him to do the best he could, correctly figuring that Clift&#x27;s nervousness would be central to his character&#x27;s mental state. (Clift was so eager to do the film that he worked just for expenses.) Lancaster speaks only three lines (none in the courtroom) until his lengthy monologue roughly 135 minutes into the film. Meanwhile Garland was so happy to be working in a motion picture again after seven years away that it took her a while to get into the proper frame of mind to break down and cry.

==Reception==
The world premiere was held on December 14, 1961, at the in West Berlin, Germany. 300 journalists from 22 countries were in attendance and earphones offering the soundtrack dubbed in German, Spanish, Italian and French were made available. The reaction from the audience was reportedly subdued, with some applauding at the finish, but most of the Germans in attendance leaving in silence.

Kramer&#x27;s film received positive reviews from critics and was lauded as a straight reconstruction of the famous trials of Nazi war criminals. The cast was especially praised, including Tracy, Lancaster, Schell, Clift and Garland. The film&#x27;s release was perfectly timed, as its subject coincided with the trial and conviction in Israel of Nazi SS officer Adolf Eichmann.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared it &quot;a powerful, persuasive film&quot; with &quot;a stirring, sobering message to the world&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;With the most painful pages of modern history as its bitter basis, Abby Mann&#x27;s intelligent, thought-provoking screenplay is a grim reminder of man&#x27;s responsibility to denounce grave evils of which he is aware. The lesson is carefully, tastefully and upliftingly told via Kramer&#x27;s large-scale production.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; awarded its top grade of &quot;Excellent&quot;, praising Kramer for employing &quot;an ingenious device of fluid direction&quot; and Spencer Tracy for &quot;a performance of compelling substance&quot;.

Brendan Gill of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the film &quot;a bold and, despite its great length, continuously exciting picture&quot;, which asks questions that &quot;are among the biggest that can be asked and are no less fresh and thrilling for being thousands of years old&quot;. Gill added that the cast was so loaded with stars &quot;that it occasionally threatens to turn into a judicial &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;. Luckily, they all work hard to stay inside their roles.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared it &quot;an extraordinary film, both in concept and handling. Those who see this at the Warner will recognize that the screen has been put to noble use.&quot;

&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; of Britain dissented, writing in a mostly negative review that &quot;this large-scale trial film undermines faith in its philosophical and historical merit by colouring the better part of its message with hackneyed court-room hysteria&quot;, explaining that &quot;in a series of contrived scenes ... the point is hammered home right down to the last shock-cut. The same specious technique (zoom-lens shots and camera-circlings predominant) and showmanship turn the trial into little more than a travesty—notably in the melodramatic switch in the character of Janning.&quot;

The film grossed $6 million in the United States and $10 million in worldwide release.

The television network premiere of the film was shown on ABC on 7 March 1965; it was interrupted to show news footage of the violence on &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; during the Selma to Montgomery marches. The juxtaposition of the film about Nazi atrocities and the news footage of violence against African-American people resulted in sympathy and greater support for the civil-rights cause.

== Awards and nominations ==
* In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its &quot;Ten Top Ten&quot; after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; was acknowledged as the tenth best film in the courtroom drama genre. Additionally, the film had been nominated for AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies.

==Release==
&quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; was released in American theatres on December 19, 1961.

CBS/Fox Video first released the film as a two-VHS cassette set in 1986. MGM re-released the VHS version in 1991, while the 1996 and 2001 reissues were part of the Vintage Classics and Screen Epics collection respectively. In addition, the special edition DVD was released on September 7, 2004.

Three Blu-ray versions of the film were also produced. A limited edition Blu-ray was released by Twilight Time on November 14, 2014. Kino Lorber re-released the Blu-ray as a standard release in 2018. The BFI released a 2-disc Blu-ray on January 20, 2020.

The Australian Blu-ray was released as part of The Hollywood Gold Series.

== Adaptations ==
In 1985, a Soviet stage adaptation of the film under the title &quot;Judgment&quot; was produced for Baltic House Festival Theatre, with Gennady Egorov as director.

In 2001, another stage adaptation of the film was produced for Broadway, starring Schell (this time in the role of Ernst Janning) and George Grizzard, with John Tillinger as director.

<text>The Sun and Moon is an , a story in Inuit folklore. The traditional explanation for the movement of the Sun and Moon through the sky is that a brother and sister are constantly chasing each other across the sky. The story also explains the moon&#x27;s dappled gray appearance as soot smeared on his face.

==Names==
The brother is most often called Aningaat. In other versions he is simply called Moon (). He is sometimes equated with Tarqiup Inua.

The sister is most commonly called Sun (; ; Natsilingmiutut: ). Other times she is simply called &quot;Aningaat&#x27;s sister&quot;. An account by Hans Egede reports her being called Malina or Ajut in Greenland. Gayle Uyagaqi Kabloona from Canada also calls her Malina.

One version says their names are and , but that they call each other and , which are archaic forms of address between a brother and sister. Another version calls the brother and the sister (meaning &quot;older sister of a younger brother&quot;). Bernard Saladin D&#x27;Anglure gives the etymology that means &quot;favorite brother&quot;, from (&quot;brother&quot; when a male is addressed by his sister) and one of several synonymous suffixes (&quot;favorite&quot;).

==Versions==
There are two parts to the story: the part about the blind boy and the loon, and the part about the sister and brother becoming the sun and moon.

Full tellings of the story include Repulse Bay storyteller Ivaluardjuk&#x27;s telling from the early 1920s, Netsilik storyteller Thomas Kusugaq&#x27;s telling from 1950, Igloolik storyteller George Kappianaq&#x27;s telling from 1986, and Igloolik storyteller Alexina Kublu&#x27;s telling from 1999.

The sun-and-moon part is sometimes told without the blind-boy part. Such tellings include the 1880s account by Franz Boas of what is reportedly an Akudnirmiut and Oqomiut version and a 1990 telling by Igloolik storyteller Hervé Paniaq.

The blind-boy part is also sometimes told without the sun-and-moon part, particularly by Athabaskan peoples to the west and south.

===Blind boy and loon===
Aningaat and his sister are orphans living with their grandmother (in some tellings their mother or stepmother). The brother is blind. One day a polar bear comes to their camp, to the window of their house. The brother shoots the bear through the window, but his grandmother lies and says he only hit the window frame. The grandmother butchers the bear in secret, keeping the meat for herself and the girl. The boy is given dog meat and not allowed to live in the main house. The sister gives her brother bear meat in secret.

The brother asks his sister to take him to a nearby lake where there are red-throated loons (). He stands by the lake until he hears the sound of a kayak and a voice invites him to sit in it. He sits and is paddled toward the center of the lake. (In Kusugaq&#x27;s telling he is simply led into the lake, without a kayak). They are submerged. When Aningaat needs air, they resurface. After taking air, they dive again. The stranger asks if he can see. This repeats several times: they dive, the stranger asks the boy if he can see. The stranger licks the boy&#x27;s eyes (a detail not in Ivaluardjuk&#x27;s version) and they dive again. Each time the boy can see a little more, and by the end he is no longer blind. The stranger is a loon (a detail not in Kappianaq&#x27;s version).

Returning home, Aningaat asks his grandmother about the bearskin he can now see. She lies, saying she got it from people who visited in an .

Now that he can see, the boy makes a harpoon and uses it with white whales passing along the shore. One day his grandmother comes hunting whales with him, serving as the anchor for the harpoon line. She tells him to harpoon the smallest whale, but he harpoons the largest. The large whale pulls her into the water, she surfaces once more, then disappears under the water. (In Kappianaq&#x27;s version she becomes a narwhal, her hair becoming the horn).

Aningaat and his sister move to a new camp. There, while getting water, the sister is attacked. The brother saves her. He heals her, then they move to a new camp.

They move to a new camp, inhabited by people who lack genitalia or anuses. Nonetheless both siblings marry people from this group, and the sister becomes pregnant and gives birth.

===Sun and Moon===
This version is much like the blind-boy version, but covers only the end of the story, beginning with the assault in the dark.

During a festivity, someone comes into the sister&#x27;s dwelling, extinguishes her lamp, and either fondles her or lies with her. Knowing it will happen again, she puts soot on her face. Her visitor comes again, getting soot on himself this time. When he leaves, she follows. Laughter is coming from the communal where the festivity is happening. She goes and sees. The people are laughing at Aningaat because he has soot on his face. Devastated by this, she cuts off a breast (merely exposing it in Kappianaq) and offers it to him, telling him to eat it if he likes her body so much. (The bit about the breast is not in Kusugaq&#x27;s telling). A chase ensues. Both are carrying torches but the brother&#x27;s goes out. The chase ascends to the heavens where they become the sun and moon, still chasing each other.

===Third version===
Knud Rasmussen reports a Paallirmiut story from a storyteller named Kibkârjuk. This one differs from the others with a consensual, reciprocal relationship between the incestuous siblings. It still includes the key elements of siblings becoming the sun and moon, the sun torch flaming while the moon torch is only embers.
