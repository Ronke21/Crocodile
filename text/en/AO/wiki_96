<text>Surbiton is a suburban neighbourhood in South West London, within the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames (RBK). It is next to the River Thames, southwest of Charing Cross. Surbiton was in the historic county of Surrey and since 1965 it has been in Greater London. Surbiton comprises five of the RBK&#x27;s wards: Alexandra, Berrylands, St. Mark&#x27;s, Surbiton Hill, and Tolworth.

Founded originally as Kingston-upon-Railway when the area was first developed in the 1840s, Surbiton possesses a mixture of grand 19th-century townhouses, Art Deco courts, and more recent residential blocks blending in with semi-detached 20th-century housing estates. With a population of 45,132 in 2016, it accounts for approximately 25% of the total population of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames. Surbiton extends over an area of .

==Etymology==
Though Surbiton only received its current name in 1869, the name is attested as &quot;Suberton&quot; in 1179, &quot;Surbeton&quot; in 1263, &quot;Surpeton&quot; in 1486, and finally &quot;Surbiton&quot; 1597. &quot;Sūth Bere-tūn&quot; means &quot;southern grange&quot; or &quot;outlying farm&quot; in Old English, as opposed to nearby Norbiton; both Norbiton and Surbiton were possessions of the royal manor of Kingston.

==History==

The present-day town came into existence after a plan to build a London-Southampton railway line through nearby Kingston was rejected by Kingston Council, who feared that it would be detrimental to the coaching trade. This resulted in the line being routed further south, through a cutting in the hill south of Surbiton. Surbiton railway station opened in 1838, and was originally named &quot;Kingston-upon-Railway&quot;. It was only renamed &quot;Surbiton&quot; to distinguish it from the new Kingston railway station on the Shepperton branch line, which opened on 1 January 1869. The present station has an art deco façade.

As a result, Kingston is now on a branch line, whereas passengers from Surbiton (smaller in comparison) can reach London Waterloo in as little as 16 minutes on a fast direct service; as well as places further afield, including Portsmouth and Southampton.

Surbiton was once home to Surbiton Studios which were owned by Stoll Pictures, before the company shifted its main production to Cricklewood Studios.

==Politics==


===National politics===

Surbiton falls within the UK parliamentary constituency of Kingston and Surbiton, which is represented in the House of Commons by Sir Ed Davey, currently the leader of the Liberal Democrats who served as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change during the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition. Davey also represented the constituency between 1997 and 2015, having been ousted for a short period of time by Conservative James Berry. In the 2017 general election, Davey went on to defeat Berry by 45% to 38%. Both Davey&#x27;s and Berry&#x27;s offices were located in Surbiton&#x27;s Berrylands ward.

In the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Kingston and Surbiton voted to remain a member of the European Union by 61.7% of the local vote.

===London politics===

Surbiton is represented in the London Assembly by Liberal Democrat politician Gareth Roberts, as part of Greater London&#x27;s South West constituency.

===Local councillors===
Surbiton elects 12 of the Kingston upon Thames London Borough Council&#x27;s 48 councillors. As of the 2018 local elections, the council is controlled by the Liberal Democrats, and all Surbiton&#x27;s elected councillors are members of that party.

==Transport==

Surbiton is served by a number of regular bus services. Transport for London bus routes 71, 281, 406, 418, 465, K1, K2, K3, and K4, as well as Hallmark Connections route 458, Reptons Coaches route 513, Falcon Coaches routes 514, 515 and 715 all serve the area. These provide links to Chessington, Kingston town centre, Twickenham, Hounslow, Epsom, Leatherhead, Dorking, Cobham, Staines, Weybridge and Guildford.

Surbiton is also close to two of London&#x27;s largest airports: Heathrow and Gatwick.

Railways have served the town since it was founded. Surbiton and Berrylands stations are both served by South Western Railway services. It provides rail links to London Waterloo, Surrey and Hampshire.

If approval is granted for the project, Surbiton will be connected with the London Underground system via Crossrail 2. It is expected that the project will relieve pressure on both Surbiton and Berrylands stations.

Surbiton lacks major motorways, although the A3 road cuts through Berrylands ward at Tolworth Underpass. Parts of the A307 that run along the River Thames, Portsmouth Road, have become part of the London cycle routes network.

===Religion===
Until the early 19th century, Surbiton, like Norbiton, lay in the parish of All Saints, Kingston upon Thames. As a result, Surbiton&#x27;s two town centre parish churches, Saint Mark&#x27;s and Saint Andrew&#x27;s, date back only to the Victorian era.

There are two further Anglican parish churches in south Surbiton, Christ Church and Saint Matthew&#x27;s, both also Victorian.

Christ Church was built in 1862–63, by Charles Lock Luck and lengthened in 1866. The chancel aisles were added in 1864, and 1871. It has no tower, and is built of red brick with stone dressings with some black brick voussoirs. The east stained-glass window was done by Clayton and Bell, the central stained-glass window by Burne-Jones, while the other stained glass was done by Lavers, Barraud and Westlake.

Saint Matthew&#x27;s was completed in 1875, having taken less than 2 years to build. The church and the original vicarage were paid for by one man, William Matthew Coulthurst, who was the senior partner of Coutts Bank. On the outside of the east end of the church, there is a stone plaque recording this and the fact that it was partly built in memory of Hannah Mabella Coulthurst, the dead sister of William Matthew Coulthurst. Built into the wall behind the plaque, there is a photograph of Hannah, a copy of &#x27;The Times&#x27; newspaper of the day and a letter from William Coulthurst stipulating that the church should remain in the evangelical tradition. The church and vicarage cost £26,500. The old vicarage was pulled down in 1939 and a subsequent one was built on the same plot. In 2012, work started on a new vicarage on part of the plot and this was completed in 2013. The East stained-glass window by Henry Holiday was destroyed by a V-1 flying bomb on 23 June 1944. They were replaced in 1953 with windows by Hugh Easton, with his maker&#x27;s mark of a weather vane signed H Easton with a cockerel on the top. The Clayton memorial triptych window was installed in 1921, designed by Louis Davis, &#x27;the last of the Pre-Raphaelites&#x27;, and made by Thomas Cowall (1870–1949) for James Powell and Sons. The Caporn memorial window was installed in 1970 and designed by W T Carter Shapland who had also designed the West window at St Mark&#x27;s. Some of the original windows by Powell &amp; Sons survive, known as Quarry windows because they are made up of pre-stamped diamond-shaped glass known as &#x27;Quarries&#x27;. 

Other churches in Surbiton include Surbiton Hill Methodist Church on Ewell Road, opened in 1882, and the Roman Catholic church of Saint Raphael&#x27;s, completed in 1848 and located to the north of Surbiton, in the Kingston upon Thames postal district.

In recent years, Surbiton has become more diverse in terms of religion, the Surbiton area having a Sikh Gurdwara and an Orthodox Jewish synagogue. According to the 2011 Census, Muslims form the largest minority religious community at about 5% of the population; the nearest mosque is located in Kingston upon Thames.

===Nationality===
Approximately 74% of Surbiton&#x27;s residents at the 2011 Census were born in the United Kingdom (73% in Alexandra, 71% in St. Mark&#x27;s, 75% in Surbiton Hill, 76% in Berrylands). The largest ethnic group, with two-thirds of the population, is &quot;White British&quot;, with &quot;White Other&quot; the second largest group at just under 10%.

==Sport==
Surbiton Lawn Tennis Club hosted international tennis from 1900 (Surrey Grass Court Championships - SGCC) until 1981 at the tennis Club in Berrylands. From 1998 to 2008 international tennis returned to Surbiton with an event hosted by the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) and Surbiton Racket &amp; Fitness Club (SRFC). The Surbiton Trophy was part of the ATP Challenger Series and in 2009 the event was moved to Nottingham as part of a reorganisation by the LTA. The event came back to SRFC in 2015 and continues to be played at Berrylands.

Surbiton F.C. was a short-lived football club that was among the founders of The Football Association in 1863. Surbiton is the current home of both male and female football teams, Darkside FC, Surbiton Wanderers and Surbiton Town Ladies FC.

Surbiton Hockey Club, established in 1874, is regarded as one of the best hockey clubs in the country. Its men&#x27;s and ladies&#x27; 1st XIs currently both play in their respective national premier leagues, while its youth section regularly produces players of international quality.

Surbiton is also the home to Surbiton Croquet Club, which is amongst the strongest croquet clubs in the country and, with seven lawns, one of the largest.

The Cooper Car Company was based in a garage on Hollyfield Road from 1946 to 1968, celebrating wins in the Formula One Constructors Championships in 1959 and 1960 and developing the iconic Mini Cooper in 1961.

==Popular culture and notable residents==
===Resident artists and writers===

The Pre-Raphaelite painters John Everett Millais (1829–1896) and William Holman Hunt (1827–1910) came to Surbiton in 1851, 26 years before Richard Jefferies (1848–1887). Millais used the Hogsmill River, in Six Acre Meadow, Tolworth, as the background for his painting &quot;Ophelia&quot;. Holman Hunt used the fields just south of this spot as the background to &quot;The Hireling Shepherd&quot;.

In the mid-1870s the novelist Thomas Hardy (1840–1928) lived in a house called &#x27;St. David&#x27;s Villa&#x27; in Hook Road, Surbiton for a year after his marriage to Emma Gifford. H.G.Wells, in his comic novel The Wheels of Chance, describes the cycle collision of &#x27;Mr Hoopdriver&#x27; and a &#x27;Young Lady in Grey&#x27;; the young lady approaching &#x27;along an affluent from the villas of Surbiton&#x27;. The writer Enid Blyton was governess to a Surbiton family for four years from 1920, at a house called &#x27;Southernhay&#x27;, also on the Hook Road. C. H. Middleton (1886–1945), who broadcast on gardening during the Second World War, lived in Surbiton, where he died suddenly outside his home. The artist who brought Rupert the Bear to life for a whole generation, Alfred Bestall, sketched out his cartoons from his home in Cranes Park, Surbiton Hill.

===In popular culture===
Surbiton was the setting of Keble Howard&#x27;s novel &quot;The Smiths of Surbiton&quot;, published in 1906. The novel proved successful and led to two sequels, &quot;The Smiths of Valley View&quot; (1909) and &quot;The Smiths in War-Time&quot; (1918), both also set in Surbiton.

A 1972 episode of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; featured a mock documentary which investigated whether the residents of Hounslow, another London area suburb, had long ago been descendants of the people of Surbiton &quot;who had made the great trek north&quot;.

Surbiton is popularly remembered as an icon of suburbia in such British television programmes as &quot;The Good Life&quot; (starring Richard Briers, Penelope Keith, Paul Eddington and Felicity Kendal), though location filming was done in Northwood, North-West London, and John Sessions and Phil Cornwell&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Stella Street&quot;.

Surbiton station features in the 2009 film version of &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,&quot; with actors Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter and Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore. Filming took place in November 2007. The station also appears in Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot: &quot;The Adventure of the Clapham Cook&quot;, a 1989 ITV adaptation of the short story by Agatha Christie. The station reflects the 1930s Art Deco style that often featured in locations used in the series.

The guitarist and singer-songwriter Eric Clapton purchased one of his first guitars from a shop in Surbiton called &quot;Bells&quot;; the shop has since closed.

According to the cassette insert for the 1980s computer game &quot;Manic Miner&quot;, the mine complex in which the game action takes place was located &quot;while prospecting down Surbiton way...&quot;

<text>Sydenham () is a district of south-east London, England, which is shared between the London boroughs of Lewisham, Bromley and Southwark. Prior to the creation of the County of London in 1889, Sydenham was located in Kent, bordering Surrey. Historically, the area was very affluent, with the Crystal Palace being relocated to Sydenham Hill in 1854. Today, Sydenham is a diverse area, with a population of 28,378 (2011 census) and borders Forest Hill, Dulwich, Crystal Palace, Penge, Beckenham, Catford and Bellingham.

==History==

Originally known as Sippenham, Sydenham began as a small settlement, a few cottages among the woods, whose inhabitants grazed their animals and collected wood. In the 1640s, springs of water in what is now Wells Park were discovered to have medicinal properties, attracting crowds of people to the area. Sydenham grew rapidly in the 19th century after the introduction of the Croydon Canal in 1809 which linked the Grand Surrey Canal to Croydon and a reservoir was constructed in Sydenham. However, the canal was never successful and closed in 1836 resulting in it being the first canal to be abandoned by an Act of Parliament. The London &amp; Croydon Railway purchased the canal for £40,250 and quickly converted the alignment for a railway from London Bridge to West Croydon, opening in 1839. After the railway opened potential gas companies began to consider the Sydenham area with the Crystal Palace and District Gas Company having works at Bell Green, which continued production until 1969; a retail park now occupies most of the site.

In 1851 the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park was housed in an immense glass building, called the Crystal Palace. In 1854 the building was bought by a private company, dismantled and re-erected at Penge Peak on Sydenham Hill (now Crystal Palace Park). Exhibitions, concerts, conferences and sporting events were held at the Crystal Palace (until it burned down in 1936), and Sydenham became a fashionable area with many new houses being built. In 1871 the French impressionist painter Camille Pissarro produced &quot;The Avenue, Sydenham&quot;, a largely still recognisable view on today&#x27;s Lawrie Park Avenue; the painting is now owned by the National Gallery.

In 1860 the Walter Cobb department store at Lawrie Place, Kirkdale (now known as Cobbs Corner) opened, lasting until the 1980s. In 1872, the Children&#x27;s Hospital, Sydenham opened. It closed in 1991, its services being now part of the University Hospital Lewisham. In 1884, Upper Sydenham railway station opened on the Crystal Palace and South London Junction Railway linking Crystal Palace to London Victoria via Peckham Rye. The station and the line were poorly used despite new houses being built in the area, as passengers preferred to use other stations near-by, Sydenham Hill (opening in 1863), Crystal Palace (Lower Level) and Sydenham which were on more direct routes. The ill fate of the Crystal Palace in 1936 saw patronage reduced and the route finally closed in 1954.

Sydenham was attacked by enemies during the Second World War. The gas works were a target, but were never damaged. The railway which ran through Upper Sydenham station was damaged, and some homes in the area were destroyed.

==Local area==
Sydenham is divided into several localities:

Sydenham Hill in the Boroughs of Lewisham and Southwark runs alongside Dulwich and Sydenham Woods on one of the highest points of Greater London being 112 metres above sea level. From here, the City of London skyline is visible. Sydenham Hill has an abandoned railway tunnel from the Crystal Palace and South London Junction Railway located within the Woods. Another railway tunnel (one of the longest in Britain being 1,958 metres) goes beneath on the Chatham Main Line with station at the London end serving both Sydenham Hill and the College area of Dulwich.

Upper Sydenham is also located on Sydenham Hill and is a part of the Parish of St Bartholomew. It is diverse both racially and in terms of income; the central section of Kirkdale was Sydenham&#x27;s original High Street. Renamed &quot;Kirkdale&quot; in 1936, the area now has a small range of shops including Tesco Express, local pubs and off-licences. Sydenham School is located on Dartmouth Road with Forest Hill Library and Forest Hill Pools alongside Thorpewood Avenue. Green Flag awarded Sydenham Wells Park, the location of the once famous Springs is one of the largest parks within the postcode.

In the area where West Hill (later renamed Westwood Hill) and Crystal Palace Park Road raise in elevation and eventually meet, many fine villas were built in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Designed in revival architectural styles, fashionable at the time, most of the properties were three or four stories high and large enough to attract more affluent residents. UK Census records suggest that many employed one or more live-in domestic staff. One of the more unusual residential streets, due to its circular arrangement is Charleville Circus, subject of an in-depth One-place study. Upper Sydenham is also the location of the Sydenham Park allotments, the Sydenham electricity sub station which had a major fire in 2008 and the Sydenham Hill estate.
Lower Sydenham &amp; Bell Green is the location of the Sydenham Community Library, formerly run and funded by the local council. Alongside to the library is Home Park and the Home Park estate. The Bridge Leisure Centre is located on Kangley Bridge Road, near to railway station and an industrial estate home to Clarkes coach company, many other businesses and the Beckenham and Sydenham Cricket Ground. Bell Green retail park houses the Sydenham Gas Works and a large Sainsbury&#x27;s superstore, formally part of the Savacentre brand. Other retailers include B&amp;Q, Currys PC World, Next (with Costa Coffee), Aldi and McDonald&#x27;s among others. The section of Kangley Bridge Road that runs south of Lower Sydenham Station is in the London Borough of Bromley and provides land for local employment.

===Commercial area===
Sydenham&#x27;s main commercial area begins on Kirkdale around Cobbs Corner, continuing onto Sydenham Road, often known as &quot;Sydenham High Street&quot;. It houses many independent shops, including a bakery, bookshop and several restaurants and chains stores. Furthermore, Sydenham is noted for the number of independent coffee shops. There is a Post Office branch and many estate agents. After recent closures, Natwest remains the only bank with a branch in the High Street. The first ever location of the Morley&#x27;s chicken chain opened in Sydenham in 1985, and remains in operation today.

Since the Transport for London and Lewisham Council funded high street upgrade in 2012–13, there is now a monthly market located within the pocket squares, known as &quot;Queensthorpe Square&quot; and &quot;Venner Square&quot;. The 18th century Greyhound pub, demolished by a developer without council permission in 2013, was rebuilt and reopened in 2017. Several new businesses such as a Sainsburys Local opened 2016 and Kinleigh Folkard &amp; Hayward Estate Agents in 2021/22.

===Community===
Sydenham has a very active community, with several groups concerning the local area. Sydenham Town is the local website for the area, where residents can also voice their opinions in an on-line form. The Sydenham Society is a Civil society formed in 1972 to represent the local community. It holds local events, works with organisations and authorities as well as campaigning for improvements to the area. Green Flag and Mayor of London Award winner, Sydenham Garden, was formed in 2002. It is a charity which is involved in improving the health of residents in the boroughs of Bromley and Lewisham.

Sydenham with Forest Hill won a bid for the national &quot;Portas Pilot&quot; competition which provided a grant to improve high streets; extra money was provided from Lewisham Council and private developers. Annually every summer since 2009, the Sydenham Arts Festival is held, where there are workshops, music, family activities etc.

===Conservation areas===

Sydenham has seven Conservation Areas: Cobbs Corner, Dulwich Village (covering Crescent Wood Road), Halifax Street, Sydenham Hill/Kirkdale, Sydenham Park and Sydenham Thorpes. Sydenham has the highest concentration of conservation areas in the London Borough of Lewisham

===Recreation===

A number of parks are within the Sydenham postcode. Mayow Park, Lewisham&#x27;s oldest municipal park and Sydenham Wells Park are both Green Flag Awarded. Other open spaces in Sydenham include Alexandra Recreation Ground, Baxters Field, Home Park and Kirkdale Green. Riverview Walk is a nature conservation area which runs along the River Pool from Catford. Additionally, located along the borders of Sydenham, there are Crystal Palace Park, Dulwich Woods, Southend Park and Sydenham Hill Woods.

Alongside Dulwich and Sydenham Hill Woods is the Dulwich and Sydenham Golf course, dating back to 1893. Located on Lawrie Park Road, there is the Sydenham Tennis Club, while the Beckenham and Sydenham Cricket Ground and the Lewisham Indoor Bowls Centre are both located in the Lower Sydenham industrial estate.

<text>Thamesmead () is an area of south-east London, England, straddling the border between the Royal Borough of Greenwich and the London Borough of Bexley. It is located east of Charing Cross, north-east of Woolwich and west of Erith. It mainly consists of social housing built from the mid-1960s onwards on former marshland on the south bank of the River Thames.

== History ==

=== Military use ===

Most of the land area of Thamesmead previously formed about of the old Royal Arsenal site that extended over Plumstead Marshes and Erith Marshes. There is some evidence of prehistoric human occupation of the area: flints, animal bones and charcoal were found in bore holes around Western and Central Way in 1997 by the Museum of London Archaeological Service (MOLAS). In Roman times, the river level was significantly lower, and work by MOLAS in 1997 around Summerton Way revealed evidence of field ditches and pottery and quernstones from Germany dating from around the 3rd or 4th century. After the Roman era, river levels rose again and the area reverted to marshland. According to Hasted, some areas of this marshland were drained by 1279 by the monks of Lesnes Abbey.

Between 1812 and 1816, a canal was built by convicts to take materials such as timber from the River Thames to Woolwich Royal Arsenal. Much of this canal has been filled in, but part remains in Thamesmead West and is now called the Broadwater. A disused lock gate and swing bridge over the canal still exist beside the River Thames.

=== Original concept ===
Thamesmead as it is now was built at the end of the 1960s. Efforts were made to solve the social problems that had already started to affect earlier estates. These were believed to be the result of people being uprooted from close-knit working-class communities and sent to estates many miles away, where they did not know anybody. The design of the new estates meant that people would feel more isolated than they would have done in the terraced housing that had been typical in working-class areas. The solution proposed was that once the initial residents had moved in, their families would be given priority for new housing when it became available.

Another radical idea of the GLC division architect Robert Rigg was taken from housing complexes in Sweden, where it was believed that lakes and canals reduced vandalism and other crime, mainly among the young. He used water as a calming influence on the residents.

Much of Thamesmead was initially built by the Greater London Council (GLC) for rent to families moving from overcrowded back-to-back Victorian housing (also referred to as slums) in south eastern parts of Inner London. The area had been inundated in the Flood of 1953, so the original design placed living accommodation at first floor level or above, used overhead walkways and left the ground level of buildings as garage space. There is also an elevated &#x27;escape route&#x27; from the estate to be used in the event of flooding, which runs along the top of a grassed mound to the north of Lesnes neighbourhood.

The first residence was occupied in 1968, but already there were rain penetration problems. The pre-1974 parts of Thamesmead are a mix of modernist town houses, medium-rise and 12-storey blocks system-built in concrete, which have featured in various films due to their &#x27;rough urban look&#x27;; the design of the newer buildings is more traditional and in brick.

When the GLC was abolished in 1986, its housing assets and the remaining undeveloped land were vested in a non-profit organisation, Thamesmead Town Limited (TTL). TTL was a private company with an unusual form of governance. Its nine executive directors were local residents; they periodically submitted themselves to re-election. Subsequently six additional paid directors who did not live in the area were appointed.

=== Problems with the Estate ===

==== Lack of Public Transport ====
Despite early proposals for the Jubilee Line Extension to go to Thamesmead, via the Isle of Dogs and the Royal Docks, Thamesmead was not included and after reaching the Greenwich Peninsula, the line heads north to Stratford (via Canning Town and West Ham), despite Stratford also being on the major Central line tube link into London. The main reason cited for this decision was that many workers in Canary Wharf lived in Essex and could change from National Rail to the Jubilee line at Stratford and West Ham.

Thamesmead is also cut-off from the north of the River Thames and is in the centre of the gap between the Blackwall Tunnel and the Dartford Tunnel/QE2 Bridge. Various proposals have been made for a new river crossing, the closest of which was in the late 1980s, when there was a controversial proposal to alter the shape of London&#x27;s South Circular inner orbital road to run through Oxleas Woods. Houses in Plumstead were compulsorily purchased but the plans fell through. Since then, Thamesmead has grown significantly, limiting the number of potential sites for a new river crossing.

==== Lack of Public Amenities ====
The most significant design failure was the almost complete lack of shopping facilities and banks: only a few &quot;corner shops&quot; were initially built at Tavy Bridge. From the start Thamesmead was cut-off from Abbey Wood, the nearest town with shopping facilities, by a railway line; however a four-lane road bridge was built over the railway in the early 1970s. The area was then cut in two by the A2016, a new four-lane dual carriageway by-pass of the Woolwich to Erith section of the A206 (although this road only got as far as the industrial part of lower Belvedere: the extension to Erith was opened in 1999). Still, residential building continued, this time on the other side of the A2016, which cut this part of Thamesmead off from rail travel to central London. Over time more facilities developed, with a Morrisons supermarket and retail park near Gallions Reach. Bus services were improved and residents can now easily reach Abbey Wood railway station.

Poor Architectutral Design

Thamesmead was designed around modern, futuristic ideas, and indeed, looked impressive at first from a distance. It provided walkways between its blocks of homes and later between sections in North Thamesmead. However, the multi-levelled streets and bridges were confusing and crime-friendly.They were not considered safe places to walk. Moreover, pathways set out for people to walk on were put in without regard to how people would wish to get about, so some were ignored in favour of more direct routes over grassed areas. 

=== 21st century ===

In 2000, TTL was wound down and two new organisations were formed. In broad terms, Gallions Housing Association took over the ownership and management of the housing assets whilst Tilfen, later Tilfen Land, took over the remaining undeveloped land. Tilfen is jointly owned by Gallions and Trust Thamesmead. District heating and cable radio broadcasting were pioneered in Thamesmead. The District heating system was decommissioned around 2000; properties connected to it had wet radiator systems installed by the landlord.

The Tavy Bridge area is now being redeveloped by Gallions in partnership with Wates Group; the plans include homes with dwelling space at ground-floor level, making them susceptible to any future flooding.

Thamesmead now features a retail park finished in brick anchored around a Morrisons Supermarket; there is also a shopping parade which has mainly service-based outlets such as hairdressers and estate agents. It features a clock tower and lake. Some of the original overhead pedestrian walkways have been demolished for reasons of public safety and some ground-floor garages have been unfilled, as incidents of crime deterred their use as parking space.

Trust Thamesmead is a registered charity set up to provide community services across Thamesmead. It runs six community centres and a variety of projects promoting social development and work and training projects.

Thamesmead West contains Gallions Ecopark a pioneering small social/affordable housing development with homes built to high energy efficiency and environmental standards. The estate also includes a small lake and a number of man-made landmarks created from recycled excavated material that serve as viewing platforms. The biggest of these is high Gallions Hill with a spiral path leading to the summit.

Part of Thamesmead West is also sometimes referred to as Gallions Reach Urban Village. This can lead to confusion, as it is on the opposite bank of the River Thames from Gallions Reach DLR station and Gallions Reach shopping park. There is no Docklands Light Railway, London Underground or rail station in Thamesmead West.

Early 21st century new build properties in Thamesmead West have been blighted by social problems and mass repossessions, attracting national attention. Housing is still under construction both by Gallions Housing Association (for rent and part rent/part buy) and by private developers (for outright sale). Another new development is under construction in 2010. The final phase of the Gallions Reach Urban Village (ecopark) is the creation of Gallions Reach Park, a public open space land, between Gallions Hill and the River Thames. Water remains an important feature of the several parks and open spaces.

In November 2007, Bexley Council marked Thamesmead&#x27;s 40th birthday with a motion proposed by local Councillor David Leaf and seconded by Councillor John Davey.

In 2014, Gallions, Tilfen Land and Trust Thamesmead were taken over by Peabody Trust, a London housing association. In 2015, two Housing Zones in Thamesmead were announced by the Mayor of London for delivery of 2,800 homes. The zones are &quot;Abbey Wood and South Thamesmead&quot;, between Abbey Wood station and Southmere Lake, and &quot;Abbey Wood, Plumstead and Thamesmead&quot;. Peabody said in 2018 that it will deliver 20,000 new homes, increasing the number of residents to around 80,000.

While a railway extension from Barking Riverside was mooted for several years, Transport for London secured funding in 2020 for a potential Docklands Light Railway extension to Thamesmead on the network&#x27;s branch to Beckton. A public consultation about the proposed extension was launched in February 2024.

== Geography ==
Thamesmead is located 11 miles (18 km) east of central London, being on the same latitude as Westminster. In Thamesmead East, the River Thames makes its most northerly incursion within Greater London near the Crossness Sewage Treatment Works.

=== Areas ===

Thamesmead consists of four distinct areas:
* &quot;Thamesmead South&quot; is in Bexley and is the location of the original development built in the late 1960s to early 1970s. The buildings are almost entirely of concrete, in a Cubist/Brutalist/Modernist style, and include a number of high-rise blocks. It is east of Harrow Manor Way (A2041) and south of the A2016. &quot;Postcode(s): SE2, DA18&quot;
* &quot;Thamesmead North&quot; is in Greenwich and Bexley and is north of the A2016 and east of the A2041. Built from the 1970s onwards, it was initially made up of town houses in grey brick; more recent builds are in red &amp; yellow brick. &quot;Postcode(s): SE2, SE28&quot;
* &quot;Thamesmead Central&quot; is in Greenwich and was first developed in the early 1980s in the ring between the A2016 and A2041. It originally consisted of large, sprawling, concrete and red brick, eight- and nine-storey estates overlooking the A2041, and three-storey red-brick town houses. It has spread west of the A2041 and now also includes a number of red and yellow brick homes built from the 1990s onwards. &quot;Postcode(s): SE28&quot;
* &quot;Thamesmead West&quot; (also known as Broadwater Green) is in Greenwich near Woolwich and Plumstead (Between Whinchat Road, the A2016 &amp; the banks of the river Thames) and was built from the 1990s onwards. It is a significant distance from the original development and consists mainly of medium density residential development with yellow brick fascias, with towers along the riverside. &quot;Postcode(s): SE28&quot;

Belmarsh Prison, Isis Prison and Thameside Prison are located on the western edge of the area, while the sewage processing works at Crossness, built in the Victorian era is on eastern edge of Thamesmead. The southern boundary is the covered Southern Outfall Sewer, which has been landscaped as an elevated footpath called the Ridgeway.

=== Neighbouring areas ===
Nearby areas are: Barking &amp; Dagenham (across the Thames), Belvedere, Abbey Wood, Plumstead, Charlton, Welling, Woolwich, Bexleyheath, Erith and Greenwich.

== Demography ==

Thamesmead&#x27;s population is increasing rapidly as new developments are being built in the area. Based on mid-2018 estimates, the area&#x27;s population has reached to 41,121, an increase of almost 30% in seven years over the 2011 figure of 31,824. Because of this, there is an increasing level of demand for the proposed DLR extension from Gallions Reach.

In common with the rest of London, the ethnic make-up of Thamesmead has changed since it was first built. Initially, it was one of the most homogenous estates of its type in London, being predominately white and working class. The lack of London Underground services and at the very edge of the metropolis may have meant Thamesmead was not first port of call for immigrants arriving in London. The housing selection policy that favoured relatives of existing residents reinforced this aspect.

However, after the Fall of Saigon and the American withdrawal from Vietnam in the late 1970s, a small group of Vietnamese refugees built a community in the area. In the 1990s, another ultimately larger wave of emigration from West Africa (predominately Nigeria and Ghana) began. The 2011 census revealed that 35.58% of residents in the Thamesmead Moorings ward described themselves as Black African, the highest percentage in both London and the UK; Thamesmead East had the second highest at 34.88%.

Thamesmead also adjoins the Thistlebrook travellers site which is situated just inside Abbey Wood.

== Crime ==

Some estate residents claim that gang T-Block (Now known locally as Greenside or GS28) have been left untouched by police, due to the high levels of drug-related crime and violence taking place in the Thamesmead area and local areas Abbey Wood and Plumstead. Gangs and crime have been prevalent in the area since the late 1970s due to increased rates of poverty, a failing economy and the rise of working class communities during The Tories&#x27; reign in government. However, in the 80s, there was a raise of racist gangs which ran riot within the Thamesmead area, and local areas (such as Welling, Erith, Belvedere, Eltham &amp; Plumstead). These groups (such as R.A.) felt inclined to defend their &#x27;turf&#x27; and would often harass young black men and boys from Thamesmead, and surrounding local areas. These behaviour was shown within a famous murder within the area, which soon shaped the major change within the Thamesmead area from the 1990s onwards - The Murder of Rolan Adams. Rolan Adams (1975 - 1991) was a Black British boy who was murdered as the result of a racist hate crime which was committed in 1991. He is frequently associated in connection to Stephen Lawrence, another teenager from a neighbouring area Eltham in Southeast London, who was later killed in a similar incident, exposing the public view of racially motivated attacks in London, England at the time. From the late 1990s onwards, a rise of Afro-Caribbean people would move into the areas, from abroad (Countries like Ghana, Nigeria, and Jamaica) and inner South London, due to re-housing and gentrification in areas like Peckham, Camberwell, Walworth and Brixton. Many of the black youths who would move into the area, will move around together to defend themselves against these racist gangs, seeing the early formation of the gang T-Block (now known as Greenside or GS28) in 2002. The gang would fall into heavy beefs with local gangs Woolwich Boys, Cherry Orchard Boys and R.A. (Welling &amp; Erith) but also form deep alliances with other local gangs, such as Glyndon Boys, Ferrier Estate Boys and Peckham Boys, during the mid-late 2000s and early 2010s 

==Education==
The Bishop John Robinson CE School is a voluntary-aided Church of England primary school with a nursery in Hoveton Road, Thamesmead, named after John Robinson, Bishop of Woolwich.

== Transport ==

Thamesmead&#x27;s location between the Thames and the South London escarpment (see North Downs) makes it difficult to build new road and railway infrastructure. As a result, Thamesmead has no underground or above-ground rail lines. With a population of almost 32,000, it is one of the largest districts in Greater London with no railway infrastructure. Most residents travel by bus to the nearest rail stations. There is, however, a disused railway trackbed from Plumstead which originally served the Royal Arsenal. The London Assembly proposed on 4 October 2016 to build an extension of the DLR from Gallions Reach to Thamesmead, and a public consultation about the proposed extension was launched in February 2024.

=== Buses ===
Many bus routes serve the area, all provided by Transport for London.

=== National Rail ===
The nearest stations are Abbey Wood, Belvedere, Plumstead and Woolwich Arsenal for Southeastern and services towards Crayford, Dartford, London Cannon Street, London Charing Cross, Elizabeth line services to Paddington and Thameslink services towards Rainham via Dartford and Luton via Blackfriars.

=== Cycle paths ===
The Ridgeway cycle path, owned by Thames Water, passes through the town from Plumstead Railway station to Crossness Sewage Treatment works, dividing the town into North and South Thamesmead.

== Culture ==
There are a wide variety of active community groups and local bands (The Bargains and a member of post-rock act From The Sky) and a short-range commercial radio station - 106.8 Time FM - that grew from the original cable (subsequently FM) service &quot;Radio Thamesmead&quot;.

Places of worship in the area include the Thamesmead Ecumenical Parish, with shared buildings and co-operation by the Methodist Church, Church of England, United Reformed Church and Roman Catholic Church, and the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Goodnews Haven on Nathan Way.

=== Sport and leisure ===
The local football team was Thamesmead Town F.C. who played at the Bayliss Avenue ground. Thamesmead were champions of the Kent League in 2007–08, and were then promoted to the Isthmian League Division One North. Thamesmead Town folded in October 2018.

The Thamesmead Riverside Walk runs alongside the Thames through Thamesmead West, Thamesmead Central and Thamesmead North and is part of both the Thames Path Southeast Extension and National Cycle Route 1. Thamesmead is also one of the starting points of the Green Chain Walk, which links to places such as Chislehurst and Crystal Palace.

There is a combined swimming pool, fitness centre and library run by Greenwich Council and Greenwich Leisure Limited in Thamesmead Central (The Thamesmere Centre). Bexley Council run a library at Binsey Walk near Southmere Lake, and sailing and canoeing are run at Southmere Lake in Thamesmead South by Southmere Boating Centre (with Greenwich Yacht Club) and sailing only by the YMCA in association with Erith Yacht Club. Trust Thamesmead run an indoor climbing wall (The cave) near Southmere Lake. The Thamesview Golf Centre in Thamesmead North has a nine-hole course and driving range. Fishing at Birchmere Lake in Thamesmead West is organised by Thamesmead Town Angling Club. Fish include tench, bream, carp and pike.

=== Cultural references ===
Thamesmead estate was featured prominently in the film &quot;The Optimists of Nine Elms&quot; (1973) starring Peter Sellers. Thamesmead is seen as a new and better alternative through the eyes of two small children who live in older, dilapidated flats in Nine Elms, Battersea. The Tavy Bridge area of Thamesmead South, including Southmere Lake, was used as a setting for the Stanley Kubrick film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; and also the play and Channel 4 gay coming-of-age film &quot;Beautiful Thing&quot;. The British TV drama &quot;Misfits&quot; was also filmed in Thamesmead. Many scenes take place around Southmere Lake, while Bexley College was once also used as a setting.
The estate featured in The Libertines video What Became of the Likely Lads.
The video of &quot;Come to Daddy&quot; by electronic musician Aphex Twin, directed by Chris Cunningham, was also shot in Thamesmead. &quot;The Firm&quot; (1989), starring Gary Oldman, was filmed in Thamesmead. The music video for New York rapper A$AP Rocky&#x27;s and London rapper Skepta&#x27;s song &quot;Praise the Lord (Da Shine)&quot; was partially filmed at the Thamesmead Estate, with the estate featuring prominently alongside shots of New York throughout the music video. The music video for American producer Skrillex and British producer Four Tet&#x27;s song Butterflies was filmed on the Thamesmead Estate.

<doc id="94318" wikidata="Q210531" url="?curid=94318" title="London Borough of Enfield">
<text>The London Borough of Enfield () is a London borough in Greater London, England. The main communities in the borough are Edmonton, Enfield, Southgate and Palmers Green. Enfield is an Outer London borough and forms part of North London, being the northernmost borough and bordering Hertfordshire to the north and Essex to the northeast. The local authority is Enfield London Borough Council, based at Enfield Civic Centre. The borough&#x27;s population is estimated to be 333,794.

It borders the London boroughs of Barnet to the west, Haringey to the south, and Waltham Forest to the southeast. To the north are the districts of Hertsmere, Welwyn Hatfield and Broxbourne (in Hertfordshire), and to the east is Epping Forest District in Essex.

==Etymology==
Enfield was recorded in Domesday Book in 1086 as &quot;Enefelde&quot;, and as &quot;Einefeld&quot; in 1214, &quot;Enfeld&quot; in 1293, and &quot;Enfild&quot; in 1564: that is &#x27;open land of a man called Ēana&#x27;, or &#x27;where lambs are reared&#x27;, from the Old English &quot;feld&quot; with an Old English personal name or with Old English &quot;ēan&quot; &#x27;lamb&#x27;. The &quot;feld&quot; would have been a reference to an area cleared of trees within woodland that would later become known as Enfield Chase.

==History==
In Roman times, Enfield was connected to Londinium by Ermine Street, the great Roman road which stretched all the way up to York. Artefacts found in the early 1900s reveal that there were Roman settlements in the areas that are now Edmonton and Bush Hill Park.

In 790 King Offa of Mercia was recorded as giving the lands of Edmonton to St Albans Abbey. The area became strategically important as East Anglia was taken over by the Danes. In the 890s strongholds were built by men loyal to King Alfred the Great, in order to keep the Danes to the east of the River Lea.

After the Norman Conquest, both Enfield and Edmonton were mentioned in Domesday Book. Both had churches, and Enfield had 400 inhabitants, Edmonton 300. Enfield is also described as having a &quot;parc&quot;. This parc—a heavily forested area for hunting—was key to Enfield&#x27;s existence in the Middle Ages (see Enfield Old Park). Wealthy Londoners came to Enfield first to hunt, and then to build houses in the green, wooded surroundings. In 1303, Edward I of England granted Enfield a charter to hold a weekly market, which has continued up to this day. The old market cross was removed in the early 20th century to make way for a monument to the coronation of King Edward VII, but was preserved by the horticulturalist E. A. Bowles for his garden at nearby Myddelton House, where it remains today.

Enfield Grammar School with its Tudor Old Hall stands next to the Enfield Town Market Place and St. Andrew&#x27;s Church, the school having been extended several times since 1586. A new hall and further additions were completed shortly before World War II.

Nearby historically was the palace of Edward VI, where Elizabeth I lived while a princess, including during the final illness of Henry VIII. Edward was taken there to join her, so that in the company of his sister, Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford could break the news to Edward, formally announcing the death of their royal father in the presence chamber at Enfield, on his knees to make formal obeisance to the boy as King. Later Elizabeth held court there when she was queen (this was remembered in the name Palace Gardens that was a street running behind Pearsons department store and is still recalled in the name of Enfield&#x27;s shopping centre).

===Industry===
Enfield has a history of armaments manufacture—see Royal Small Arms Factory. The Lee–Enfield .303 rifle was standard issue for the British Army until 1957, although its usage carried on afterwards for some time. Other firearms manufactured there include the Bren and Sten machine guns—the &quot;en&quot; in both cases denoting the place of manufacture.

The world&#x27;s first solid state circuitry colour televisions were manufactured by Ferguson at their now closed plant in Enfield.

The first mass-produced dishwasher was manufactured in Hotpoint&#x27;s now closed Enfield plant.

The Barclays Bank branch in Enfield was the first place in the world to have an ATM or cash machine; it was officially opened in June 1967 by Reg Varney, a television actor and personality most famous for his lead role in the comedy series &quot;On the Buses&quot;. This historical event was marked by a silver plaque on the wall of the bank, and later by an English Heritage Blue plaque.

A fine example of a grade II listed art deco factory building can be found along Southbury Road, with the former Ripaults Factory, now an office building for Travis Perkins.
===Administrative history===
The area of the modern borough broadly corresponds to the two ancient parishes of Enfield and Edmonton, and was historically part of the county of Middlesex. Both parishes were made local board districts in 1850, each with an elected board overseeing public health and responsible for the provision of infrastructure. The Edmonton district was divided in 1881, when its western part was made a separate district called Southgate. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894.

Each of the three urban districts was later raised to the status of a municipal borough: Southgate in 1933, Edmonton in 1937, and Enfield in 1955.

The modern borough was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, covering the combined area of the former boroughs of Enfield, Edmonton and Southgate, which were all abolished at the same time. The area was transferred from Middlesex to Greater London to become one of the 32 London Boroughs.

The armorial bearings of these three boroughs were also merged. The heraldic beast on the shield of the Enfield coat of arms is known in heraldry as an &quot;Enfield&quot; (or colloquially as the Enfield beast), and is used extensively as a logo representing Enfield, particularly by the borough council.

==Enfield today==

The borough&#x27;s Civic Centre is in Silver Street, Enfield Town, and is home to the council. Enfield Town is also home to the local credit union, North London Credit Union.

In 2007, Enfield Town centre completed a major redevelopment project under the name PalaceXchange while retaining the Palace Gardens Shopping Centre. An extension was added to the existing retail area with many new shops, and a second multi-storey car park was built along with a new road layout.

A major redevelopment of Edmonton Green including the shopping centre, and adjacent municipal housing over a wide area, started in 1999. This is still on-going, and provides new housing, health facilities, a new leisure centre, a supermarket, and many other civic features.

Many local activities are located around the A10 road, on the sites of former industrial enterprises, which has a number of large retail outlets and a large multiplex Cineworld cinema. The cinema also hosts Jubilee Church on a Sunday morning; whilst cinemagoers continue to watch films in the other screens, a charismatic church which draws its worshippers from a wide area, hiring several auditoria for worship.

The western part of Enfield is largely residential, with shopping centres in Southgate, Palmers Green and Cockfosters.

Parts of Enfield experienced rioting in August 2011, in which a private car and a van were set alight and completely destroyed, a police car vandalised (smashed windows) and a number of shops in Enfield Town Centre as well as others in the Enfield Retail Park being broken into and looted. The Sony Distribution Centre in the Innova Business Park, near Waltham Cross, was burnt to the ground. In September 2012, a year after the attack, a rebuilt Sony Distribution Centre was opened by the prime minister, David Cameron.

==Governance==
The local authority is Enfield Council, based at the Civic Centre on Silver Street in Enfield. The council has been controlled by a Labour Party majority since 2010.

===Greater London representation===
Since 2000, for elections to the London Assembly, the borough forms part of the Enfield and Haringey constituency.

=== Members of parliament ===
The borough has three members of parliament (MPs) representing Enfield North, Edmonton and Winchmore Hill and Southgate and Wood Green constituencies. The latter is a cross-borough constituency with neighbouring Haringey.

==Demographics==



==Public services==
===Health===
Two major NHS hospitals, Chase Farm Hospital operated by the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and North Middlesex Hospital operated by the North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust, are located in the borough. NHS Enfield Clinical Commissioning Group is responsible for local primary health care, taking over this role from Enfield Primary Care NHS Trust in 2013. Another hospital in the borough, Highlands, was closed in 1993.

===Education===

====Schools====

The London Borough of Enfield is the education authority for the district. Education is provided in a mix of community, voluntary aided and state schools. A number of private schools are also located in the borough.

The borough is home to the well-renowned Enfield Grammar School, founded in 1558, which still uses its Tudor building which is now often referred to as the Old Hall. Enfield Grammar School is based in the center of Enfield Town. St Ignatius&#x27; College is the borough&#x27;s largest Catholic school and one of the best-performing non-selective schools in the borough, at both GCSE and A-Level. Bishop Stopford&#x27;s School is Enfield&#x27;s largest school, and The College of Haringey, Enfield and North East London also has a campus in the borough.

In 2007 a new school named Oasis Academy Enfield was opened, following the takeover of Albany by the Oasis Company as Oasis Academy Hadley.
The Latymer School is another Grammar school in the borough, and is based in the Edmonton area.
Enfield County School is an all girls comprehensive school which sits opposite Enfield Grammar Boys school in Enfield town. It is a split site school with the lower years situated towards the area of Forty Hall.

====University====
Middlesex University, the former polytechnic, used to have two campuses in Enfield: Cat Hill and Trent Park. These sites both closed in 2011 and courses were relocated to the Hendon campus.

Oak Hill Theological College, an associate college of Middlesex University, is located in the borough.

Capel Manor College also offers various courses.

===London Fire Brigade===
The London Borough of Enfield has three fire stations; Edmonton, Enfield and Southgate. However, if an incident requires a higher attendance, appliances from throughout London can be mobilised to meet the needs of the area if required.

The three fire stations operate a total of five pumping appliances, one rescue tender, a command unit and a USAR unit.

Of the three fire stations within the borough, Enfield is mobilised to the most incidents and has the largest station ground (the area of which Enfield is the first appliance to attend).

===Museums===
The borough&#x27;s museums include Forty Hall and the garden exhibitions at Capel Manor, Myddleton House (part of the Lee Valley Park) and the Whitewebbs Museum of Transport.
The Borough&#x27;s own museum is based in Thomas Hardy House, 39 London Road.

==Sport and recreation==

Enfield&#x27;s King George&#x27;s Field, named in memory of King George V, includes the Queen Elizabeth II athletics stadium, the Enfield Ignatians Rugby Club and numerous football, rugby and baseball diamonds. The playing fields were used as a POW camp for Italians during World War II.

The second largest playing fields are at Firs Farm on Firs Lane. There are a handful of rugby pitches along with more than a dozen football pitches. These are used by local amateur football clubs including Winchmore Hill Football Club, Mayfield Athletic FC and Southgate County FC. The pitches drain reasonably well but are generally in poor condition with old, rusted goalposts. The changing facilities are also very dilapidated, with some changing rooms being no more than concrete sheds with corrugated roofs.

Many sports teams and clubs are located in Enfield; Winchmore Hill Sports Club, Winchmore Hill Football Club, Enfield Town F.C., Enfield 1893 F.C., Cockfosters F.C., Enfield Borough F.C. and Futsal Club Enfield are the most prominent. The once successful football club, Enfield FC, were forced into a nomadic existence after the sale of their Southbury Road ground and became defunct at the end of the 2006/2007 season after years of ground sharing at many Hertfordshire based clubs. Enfield 1893 were formed after Enfield FC&#x27;s demise and have spent time groundsharing at Ware FC and Broxbourne Borough FC. They finally found a ground in the borough when they merged with Brimsdown Rovers for the start of the 2011/2012 season. Saracens Rugby Football Club used to play in Enfield and still train at Bramley Road sports ground near Cockfosters.

The principal cricket clubs in the area are Enfield, Winchmore Hill Cricket Club, Edmonton and Southgate, with many others playing cricket in and around the borough such as, Enfield Invicta, Mayfield CC, Myddleton House, North Enfield CC, Botany Bay and Holtwhites Trinibis CC. Many clubs play in either the Middlesex Cricket League or the Hertfordshire League. Enfield, Southgate, and Winchmore Hill have long been the area&#x27;s most successful cricket clubs, regularly competing in the Middlesex Premier League. Enfield (in 1988) and Southgate (in 1977) are both past winners of the ECB National Club Cricket Championship

The main swimming club in the borough is Enfield Swim Squad, which was created from an amalgamation of Edmonton Phoenix S.C. and Griffins S.C. of Enfield.

Futsal is also played in the area with Futsal Club Enfield who were founded in 2007 playing in the National Futsal League Premiership South Division for 2019/20.

The center is used by the WWE as a professional wrestling school to train potential future wrestlers from across the globe, as well as a training centre for current WWE wrestlers.

==Transport==
In 1840 the first section of the Northern and Eastern Railway was opened from Stratford to Broxbourne, with stations at Water Lane (Angel Road) and Ponders End. Further stations were added in 1855 at Enfield Lock (Royal Small Arms Factory) and 1884 at Brimsdown. A branch line from Water Lane to Enfield Town was opened in 1849 serving Edmonton Low Level and Enfield Town. A further station was added in 1880 at Bush Hill Park. The direct line from London to Enfield Town was opened in 1872 with stations at Silver Street and Lower Edmonton (now called Edmonton Green). In 1891, a loop from Edmonton serving Southbury (Churchbury) and Turkey Street (Forty Hill) to Cheshunt on the main line was added. The Cheshunt and Enfield Town services are currently served by London Overground.

In 1871 the Great Northern Railway opened its station on Windmill Hill. This was later replaced in 1910 when the line was extended to Cuffley. This section of railway is now part of the line commonly known as the Hertford Loop.

Enfield is served by the Piccadilly line of the London Underground with stations at Arnos Grove, Southgate, Oakwood (named as Enfield West when it first opened) and Cockfosters (where the line terminates). Suburban London Overground and National Rail Great Northern services also run within the borough.

There are numerous bus services throughout the borough run by Transport for London.

The main roads running through the borough include the North Circular Road, the M25, Green Lanes, the A10 and the old Hertford Road (A1010).

<text>Thornton Heath is a district of South London, England, within the London Borough of Croydon. It is around north of the town of Croydon, and south of Charing Cross. Prior to the creation of Greater London in 1965, Thornton Heath was in the County Borough of Croydon.

==History==

Until the arrival of the railway in 1862, Thornton Heath was focused on an area southwest of the Whitehorse manor house (now a school), at the locality on the main London–Sussex road known as Thornton Heath Pond in the parish of Croydon St John the Baptist. Between the manor house and pond was an isolated farmhouse. Eventually, it became the site for the railway station and the main expansion hub.

In the 50-year period from 1861 to 1911, Thornton Heath saw a complete transformation from an isolated rural outpost to an integrated metropolitan suburb. In its infancy, a new railway station in the eastern farmlands enabled the immediate area to evolve around a central point. In the late 19th century, the western part of Thornton Heath, which lay directly on the main London–Sussex road, demonstrated a classic form of suburban ribbon development. In the process, it became the final piece in an urban chain linking two major centres, London and Croydon, completing the greatest metropolitan expansion in the world at that time which cost £112 million in today&#x27;s money.

==Geography==
The nearest places are Mitcham, Croydon, South Norwood, Norbury, Pollards Hill, Selhurst, Upper Norwood, and Eastfields.

Geologically, some areas have clay-heavy soil, including Norbury and South Norwood. There is the gravelly, fertile soil in parts of the Thornton Heath area, which explains why market gardening and gravel extraction were major industries.


==Transport==
===Bus===
Thornton Heath is served by London Buses routes 50, 60, 64, 109, 130, 198, 250, 289, 450, 468 and SL6, plus night routes N68, N109, and N250 and school route 663. Thornton Heath bus garage, owned by Arriva London, is at the junction of London Road and Thornton Road, known as Thornton Heath Pond.

===Rail===
Thornton Heath railway station is on the London Victoria branch of the Brighton Main Line, and is operated by Southern. Other stations nearby are Selhurst, the next station down, and Norwood Junction, on the East London line of the London Overground.

==Culture and architecture==

Architecturally, Thornton Heath is predominantly Victorian in both its residential and commercial sectors. There are a number of imposing, even grand, buildings surviving from this period.

Two examples are St Paul&#x27;s Church and St Alban&#x27;s Church. St Alban&#x27;s is an Anglican church and is listed as Grade II. Built in 1889, it was the first church designed by the late Victorian architect Sir Ninian Comper. It is situated on the busy junction of Grange Road and the High Street. It is described as being of a red-brick perpendicular style with stone dressing.

At the junction of the High Street and Parchmore Road, on a site previously called Walker&#x27;s Green, stands the Clocktower, which was built in 1900, and financed partly by public subscription.

However, the Victorian baths did not survive, and were replaced by a modern sports and leisure centre in 2004. It cost £8 million with £2.8 million from the British National Lottery &quot;Good Causes&quot; Fund through Sport England.

Several small and large blocks of flats have been built in the area, in a similar style. A large one is Crystal Court, adjacent to the Leisure Centre. There was an intense fire there. Although the building had passed safety checks, residents were concerned about the role of the cladding. This is being replaced.

Architects have posted about their project in the Library with a Council remit to refurbish and extend the Edwardian building, in particular, to improve access. There was also work as part of the regeneration project of the High Street to the Library on Brigstock Road.

In 2019, there was a contest organised by the Thornton Heath Community Action team for a planned redesign of the central area; it was won by architecture students.

== Demography and economics ==
Thornton Heath has a high degree of ethnic diversity with a large proportion of people from a BAME background. In the 2011 census, Thornton Heath (comprising the wards of Bensham Manor, Thornton Heath, and West Thornton) was Black or Black British (36.4%), White or White British (27.4%), Asian or Asian British (25.9%), mixed/multiple ethnic groups (7.1%), and other ethnic groups (6.6%). The largest single ethnicity is White British (20.2%) followed by British African-Caribbean people (17.6%). The average house price from sales in March 2023 was £421,433.

==Sport and leisure==
Thornton Heath gained a new leisure centre in May 2004. Its popularity was such that turnstiles had to be fitted to improve security. The centre is owned by Croydon Council, but was originally run by Parkwood Leisure, and now run by Fusion Lifestyle in partnership with the council.

Thornton Heath is one of the railway stations used by visitors to Selhurst Park stadium, home of Premier League club Crystal Palace.

Thornton Heath formerly had a Non-League football club, Croydon Athletic, which played at the Keith Tuckey Stadium; the club ceased to exist at the end of the 2010–11 season. In 2012, fans of the club formed AFC Croydon Athletic, which plays at the Mayfield Stadium. In 2015, the club competed in the Southern Counties East League. The reformed 5-time FA Cup winners Wanderers FC currently play at Thornton Heath.

Thornton Heath is also home to the historic rugby club Streatham-Croydon RFC founded in 1871. Their grounds and clubhouse are located in Frant Road off Brigstock Road.

There are three parks in Thornton Heath: Grangewood Park, Thornton Heath Recreation Ground, and Trumble Gardens.

The 2012 Olympic torch was taken along the High Street and Brigstock Road.

==Health==
Thornton Heath healthcare is part of Croydon Health Services NHS Trust. GP practices are independent and receive NHS funding. The Council covers some health services such as public health. It has sole responsibility for social services.

The local hospital is Croydon University Hospital (formerly Mayday Hospital). It was assessed in 2021 by the Care Quality Commission as &quot;requiring improvement&quot; overall. However, some specific services were rated as &quot;good&quot;.

==Community==
Thornton Heath Community Action Team was formed in 2014 by a group of residents and businesses. Its aim is to deliver projects and to improve the area, such as organising litter picks, planting new plants, and a community Christmas tree. Members of the community have a garden in part of a local park and are maintain the planting area in the Ambassadors House forecourt. They also lobby and campaign on relevant local issues.

Sustainable Thornton Heath is a group of local people concerned about the environment.

Friends of Grangewood Park organise events and projects to improve the park, and encourage people to use it.

Facebook groups include Thornton Heath Community Action Team and Thornton Heath Local, a more general group. Both are private but easy for local people to join. In 2021, a Thornton Heath app, We are Thornton Heath, was created.

There is local news in the &#x27;Thornton Heath Chronicle&#x27;.

There were Thornton Heath festivals for several years up to 2019.

The council had a regeneration plan for Thornton Heath. &quot;Since 2016 we have been involving local people in an improvement programme, making the High Street and Brigstock Road more attractive, with funding from the GLA. This included new pavements and road improvements, upgrades to shop fronts, wall art by local artists along the high street, and improvements to the forecourt of Ambassador House&quot;.

In addition to the murals in the improvement programme, there are other artworks, such as a mosaic and mural at the station. An &#x27;Art Trail&#x27; map was compiled as a guide.

<doc id="94320" wikidata="Q478216" url="?curid=94320" title="Virus classification">
<text>Virus classification is the process of naming viruses and placing them into a taxonomic system similar to the classification systems used for cellular organisms.

Viruses are classified by phenotypic characteristics, such as morphology, nucleic acid type, mode of replication, host organisms, and the type of disease they cause. The formal taxonomic classification of viruses is the responsibility of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) system, although the Baltimore classification system can be used to place viruses into one of seven groups based on their manner of mRNA synthesis. Specific naming conventions and further classification guidelines are set out by the ICTV.

In 2021, the ICTV changed the International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature (ICVCN) to mandate a binomial format (genus|| ||species) for naming new viral species similar to that used for cellular organisms; the names of species coined prior to 2021 are gradually being converted to the new format, a process planned for completion by the end of 2023.

As of 2022, the ICTV taxonomy listed 11,273 named virus species (including some classed as satellite viruses and others as viroids) in 2,818 genera, 264 families, 72 orders, 40 classes, 17 phyla, 9 kingdoms and 6 realms.
 However, the number of named &quot;viruses&quot; considerably exceeds the number of named virus &quot;species&quot; since, by contrast to the classification systems used elsewhere in biology, a virus &quot;species&quot; is a collective name for a group of (presumably related) viruses sharing certain common features (see below). Also, the use of the term &quot;kingdom&quot; in virology does not equate to its usage in other biological groups, where it reflects high level groupings that separate completely different kinds of organisms (see Kingdom (biology)).

==Definitions==
=== Virus definition ===
The currently accepted and formal definition of a &#x27;virus&#x27; was accepted by the ICTV Executive Committee in November 2020 and ratified in March 2021, and is as follows:

=== Species definition ===
Species form the basis for any biological classification system. Before 1982, it was thought that viruses could not be made to fit Ernst Mayr&#x27;s reproductive concept of species, and so were not amenable to such treatment. In 1982, the ICTV started to define a species as &quot;a cluster of strains&quot; with unique identifying qualities. In 1991, the more specific principle that a virus species is a class of viruses that constitutes a replicating lineage and occupies a particular ecological niche was adopted.

As at 2021 (the latest edition of the ICVCN), the ICTV definition of species states: &quot;A species is the lowest taxonomic level in the hierarchy approved by the ICTV. A species is a monophyletic group of MGEs (mobile genetic elements) whose properties can be distinguished from those of other species by multiple criteria&quot;, with the comment &quot;The criteria by which different species within a genus are distinguished shall be established by the appropriate Study Group. These criteria may include, but are not limited to, natural and experimental host range, cell and tissue tropism, pathogenicity, vector specificity, antigenicity, and the degree of relatedness of their genomes or genes. The criteria used should be published in the relevant section of the ICTV Report and reviewed periodically by the appropriate Study Group.&quot;

=== Below species rank (named viruses/virus strains/isolates) ===
Many individually named &quot;viruses&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;virus strains&quot;) exist at below the rank of virus &quot;species&quot;. The ICVCN gives the examples of blackeye cowpea mosaic virus and peanut stripe virus, which are both classified in the species &quot;Bean common mosaic virus&quot;, the latter a member of the genus &quot;Potyvirus&quot; that will in due course receive a binomial name as &quot;Potyvirus [species...]&quot;. As another example, the virus SARS-CoV-1, that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is different from the virus SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, but both are classified within the same virus species, a member of the genus &quot;Betacoronavirus&quot; that is currently known as &quot;Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus&quot; which, per the 2021 mandate from the ICTV, will also receive a binomial name in due course. As set out in the ICVCN, section 3.4, the names [and definitions] of taxa below the rank of species are not governed by the ICTV; &quot;Naming of such entities is not the responsibility of the ICTV but of international specialty groups. It is the responsibility of ICTV Study Groups to consider how these entities may best be classified into species.&quot; Using the example given above, the virus causing the COVID-19 pandemic was given the designation &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot; by the &quot;Coronaviridae&quot; Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses in 2020; in the same publication, this Study Group recommended a naming convention for particular isolates of this virus &quot;resembl[ing] the formats used for isolates of avian coronaviruses, filoviruses and influenza virus&quot; in the format virus/host/location/isolate/date, with a cited example as &quot;SARS-CoV-2/human/Wuhan/X1/2019&quot;.

==ICTV classification==
The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses began to devise and implement rules for the naming and classification of viruses early in the 1970s, an effort that continues to the present. The ICTV is the only body charged by the International Union of Microbiological Societies with the task of developing, refining, and maintaining a universal virus taxonomy, following the methods set out in the International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature. The system shares many features with the classification system of cellular organisms, such as taxon structure. However, some differences exist, such as the universal use of italics for all taxonomic names, unlike in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants and International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.

Viral classification starts at the level of realm and continues as follows, with the taxonomic suffixes in parentheses:

:Realm (&quot;-viria&quot;)
::Subrealm (&quot;-vira&quot;)
:::Kingdom (&quot;-virae&quot;)
::::Subkingdom (&quot;-virites&quot;)
:::::Phylum (&quot;-viricota&quot;)
::::::Subphylum (&quot;-viricotina&quot;)
:::::::Class (&quot;-viricetes&quot;)
::::::::Subclass (&quot;-viricetidae&quot;)
:::::::::Order (&quot;-virales&quot;)
::::::::::Suborder (&quot;-virineae&quot;)
:::::::::::Family (&quot;-viridae&quot;)
::::::::::::Subfamily (&quot;-virinae&quot;)
:::::::::::::Genus (&quot;-virus&quot;)
::::::::::::::Subgenus (&quot;-virus&quot;)
:::::::::::::::Species

In parallel to the system of binomial nomenclature adopted in cellular species, the ICTV has recently (2021) mandated that new virus species be named using a binomial format (&quot;Genus species&quot;, e.g. &quot;Betacoronavirus pandemicum&quot;), and that pre-existing virus species names be progressively replaced with new names in the binomial format. A mid-2023 review of the status of this changeover stated: &quot;...a large number of proposals [concerning virus nomenclature, submitted to the ICTV Executive Committee (EC) for its consideration] renamed existing species for compliance with the recently mandated binomial nomenclature format. As a result, 8,982 out of the current 11,273 species (80%) now have binomial names. The process will be concluded in 2023, with the remaining 2,291 species being renamed.&quot;

As of 2021, all levels of taxa except subrealm, subkingdom, and subclass are used. Six realms, one &quot;incertae sedis&quot; class, 22 &quot;incertae sedis&quot; families, and two &quot;incertae sedis&quot; genera are recognized:

Realms: 
* &quot;Adnaviria&quot;
* &quot;Duplodnaviria&quot;
* &quot;Monodnaviria&quot;
* &quot;Riboviria&quot;
* &quot;Ribozyviria&quot;
* &quot;Varidnaviria&quot;
&quot;Incertae sedis&quot; classes:
* &quot;Naldaviricetes&quot;
&quot;Incertae sedis&quot; families:

* &quot;Alphasatellitidae&quot;
* &quot;Ampullaviridae&quot;
* &quot;Anelloviridae&quot;
* &quot;Avsunviroidae&quot;
* &quot;Bartogtaviriformidae&quot;
* &quot;Bicaudaviridae&quot;
* &quot;Brachygtaviriformidae&quot;
* &quot;Clavaviridae&quot;
* &quot;Fuselloviridae&quot;
* &quot;Globuloviridae&quot;
* &quot;Guttaviridae&quot;
* &quot;Halspiviridae&quot;
* &quot;Itzamnaviridae&quot;
* &quot;Ovaliviridae&quot;
* &quot;Plasmaviridae&quot;
* &quot;Polydnaviriformidae&quot;
* &quot;Portogloboviridae&quot;
* &quot;Pospiviroidae&quot;
* &quot;Rhodogtaviriformidae&quot;
* &quot;Spiraviridae&quot;
* &quot;Thaspiviridae&quot;
* &quot;Tolecusatellitidae&quot;

&quot;Incertae sedis&quot; genera: 
* &quot;Dinodnavirus&quot;
* &quot;Rhizidiovirus&quot;

===Structure-based virus classification===

It has been suggested that similarity in virion assembly and structure observed for certain viral groups infecting hosts from different domains of life (e.g., bacterial tectiviruses and eukaryotic adenoviruses or prokaryotic Caudovirales and eukaryotic herpesviruses) reflects an evolutionary relationship between these viruses. Therefore, structural relationship between viruses has been suggested to be used as a basis for defining higher-level taxa – structure-based viral lineages – that could complement the ICTV classification scheme of 2010.

The ICTV has gradually added many higher-level taxa using relationships in protein folds. All four realms defined in the 2019 release are defined by the presence of a protein of a certain structural family.

==Baltimore classification==
Baltimore classification (first defined in 1971) is a classification system that places viruses into one of seven groups depending on a combination of their nucleic acid (DNA or RNA), strandedness (single-stranded or double-stranded), sense, and method of replication. Named after David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist, these groups are designated by Roman numerals. Other classifications are determined by the disease caused by the virus or its morphology, neither of which are satisfactory due to different viruses either causing the same disease or looking very similar. In addition, viral structures are often difficult to determine under the microscope. Classifying viruses according to their genome means that those in a given category will all behave in a similar fashion, offering some indication of how to proceed with further research. Viruses can be placed in one of the seven following groups:

===DNA viruses===
Viruses with a DNA genome, except for the DNA reverse transcribing viruses, are members of three of the four recognized viral realms: &quot;Duplodnaviria&quot;, &quot;Monodnaviria&quot;, and &quot;Varidnaviria&quot;. But the &quot;incertae sedis&quot; order &quot;Ligamenvirales&quot;, and many other &quot;incertae sedis&quot; families and genera, are also used to classify DNA viruses. The domains &quot;Duplodnaviria&quot; and &quot;Varidnaviria&quot; consist of double-stranded DNA viruses; other double-stranded DNA viruses are &quot;incertae sedis&quot;. The domain &quot;Monodnaviria&quot; consists of single-stranded DNA viruses that generally encode a HUH endonuclease; other single-stranded DNA viruses are &quot;incertae sedis&quot;.
* Group I: viruses possess double-stranded DNA. Viruses that cause chickenpox and herpes are found here.
* Group II: viruses possess single-stranded DNA.

===RNA viruses===
All viruses that have an RNA genome, and that encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), are members of the kingdom &quot;Orthornavirae&quot;, within the realm &quot;Riboviria&quot;.
* Group III: viruses possess double-stranded RNA genomes, e.g. rotavirus.
* Group IV: viruses possess positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes. Many well known viruses are found in this group, including the picornaviruses (which is a family of viruses that includes well-known viruses like Hepatitis A virus, enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, poliovirus, and foot-and-mouth virus), SARS virus, hepatitis C virus, yellow fever virus, and rubella virus.
* Group V: viruses possess negative-sense single-stranded RNA genomes. Ebola and Marburg viruses are well known members of this group, along with influenza virus, measles, mumps and rabies.

===Reverse transcribing viruses===
All viruses that encode a reverse transcriptase (also known as RT or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) are members of the class &quot;Revtraviricetes&quot;, within the phylum &quot;Arterviricota&quot;, kingdom &quot;Pararnavirae&quot;, and realm &quot;Riboviria&quot;. The class &quot;Blubervirales&quot; contains the single family &quot;Hepadnaviridae&quot; of DNA RT (reverse transcribing) viruses; all other RT viruses are members of the class Ortervirales.
* Group VI: viruses possess single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate. The retroviruses are included in this group, of which HIV is a member.
* Group VII: viruses possess double-stranded DNA genomes and replicate using reverse transcriptase. The hepatitis B virus can be found in this group.
== Historical systems ==

=== Holmes classification ===
Holmes (1948) used a Linnaean taxonomy with binomial nomenclature to classify viruses into 3 groups under one order, Virales. They are placed as follows:
* Group I: &quot;Phaginae&quot; (attacks bacteria)
* Group II: &quot;Phytophaginae &quot;(attacks plants)
* Group III: &quot;Zoophaginae&quot; (attacks animals)

The system was not accepted by others due to its neglect of morphological similarities.

==Subviral agents==

Infectious agents are smaller than viruses and have only some of their properties. Since 2015, the ICTV has allowed them to be classified in a similar way as viruses are.

===Viroids and virus-dependent agents===

====Viroids====
* Family &quot;Avsunviroidae&quot;
** Genus &quot;Avsunviroid&quot;; type species: &quot;Avocado sunblotch viroid&quot;
** Genus &quot;Pelamoviroid&quot;; type species: &quot;Peach latent mosaic viroid&quot;
** Genus &quot;Elaviroid&quot;; type species: &quot;Eggplant latent viroid&quot;
* Family &quot;Pospiviroidae&quot;
** Genus &quot;Pospiviroid&quot;; type species: &quot;Potato spindle tuber viroid&quot;
** Genus &quot;Hostuviroid&quot;; type species: &quot;Hop stunt viroid&quot;
** Genus &quot;Cocadviroid&quot;; type species: &quot;Coconut cadang-cadang viroid&quot;
** Genus &quot;Apscaviroid&quot;; type species: &quot;Apple scar skin viroid&quot;
** Genus &quot;Coleviroid&quot;; type species: &quot;Coleus blumei viroid 1&quot;

====Satellites====

Satellites depend on co-infection of a host cell with a helper virus for productive multiplication. Their nucleic acids have substantially distinct nucleotide sequences from either their helper virus or host. When a satellite subviral agent encodes the coat protein in which it is encapsulated, it is then called a satellite virus.

Satellite-like nucleic acids resemble satellite nucleic acids, in that they replicate with the aid of helper viruses. However they differ in that they can encode functions that can contribute to the success of their helper viruses; while they are sometimes considered to be genomic elements of their helper viruses, they are not always found within their helper viruses.
* Satellite viruses
** Single-stranded RNA satellite viruses
*** (unnamed family)
**** &quot;Aumaivirus&quot; – &quot;Maize white line mosaic satellite virus&quot;
**** &quot;Papanivirus&quot; – &quot;Panicum mosaic satellite virus&quot;
**** &quot;Virtovirus&quot; – &quot;Tobacco mosaic satellite virus&quot;
**** &quot;Albetovirus&quot; – &quot;Tobacco necrosis satellite virus&quot;
*** Family &quot;Sarthroviridae&quot;
**** &quot;Macronovirus&quot; – &quot;Macrobrachium satellite virus 1&quot; (extra small virus)
*** (unnamed genus) – &quot;Nilaparvata lugens commensal X virus&quot;
*** (unnamed genus) – &quot;Chronic bee-paralysis satellite virus&quot;
** Double-stranded DNA satellite viruses
*** Family &quot;Lavidaviridae&quot; – Virophages
** Single-stranded DNA satellite viruses
*** Genus &quot;Dependoparvovirus&quot; – Adeno-associated virus group
* Satellite nucleic acids
** Single-stranded satellite DNAs
*** Family Alphasatellitidae (encoding a replication initiator protein)
*** Family Tolecusatellitidae (encoding a pathogenicity determinant βC1)
** Double-stranded satellite RNAs
** Single-stranded satellite RNAs
*** Subgroup 1: Large satellite RNAs
*** Subgroup 2: Small linear satellite RNAs
*** Subgroup 3: Circular satellite RNAs (virusoids)
*** Genus &quot;Deltavirus&quot;
*** Polerovirus-associated RNAs
** Satellite-like RNA
** Satellite-like DNA

====Defective interfering particles====
Defective interfering particles are defective viruses that have lost their ability to replicate except in the presence of a helper virus, which is normally the parental virus. They can also interfere with the helper virus.
* Defective interfering particles (RNA)
* Defective interfering particles (DNA)

=== Viriforms ===
Viriforms are a polyphyletic category of endogenous viral elements. Sometime in their evolution, they became &quot;domesticated&quot; by their host as a key part of the host&#x27;s lifecycle. The prototypical example is members of the (also polyphyletic) &quot;Polydnaviriformidae&quot;, which are used by wasps to send pieces of immunity-blunting DNA into the prey by packing them into virion-like particles. Other members are so-called gene transfer agents (GTAs) found among prokaryotes. GTA particles resemble tailed phages, but are smaller and carry mostly random pieces of host DNA. GTAs are produced by the host in times of stress; releasing GTAs kills the host cell, but allows pieces of its genetic material to live on in other bacteria, usually of the same species. The three known clades of GTAs, &quot;Rhodogtaviriformidae&quot;, &quot;Bartogtaviriformidae&quot;, and &quot;Brachygtaviriformidae&quot;, all arose independently from different parts of the &quot;Caudoviricetes&quot; family tree.

<text>Tolworth is a suburban area in the Surbiton district, Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, Greater London. It is southwest of Charing Cross. Neighbouring places include Berrylands, Chessington, Epsom, Ewell, Hinchley Wood, Kingston, Long Ditton, New Malden, Surbiton and Worcester Park. Surbiton is the nearest, about a mile to the northwest. Tolworth is divided in two by the A3 Kingston Bypass and is situated slightly north of the Greater London-Surrey border.

==History==
Tolworth, in the Domesday Book, was called &quot;Taleorde&quot;. Its Domesday assets were held partly by Picot from Richard de Tonebrige and partly by Radulf (Ralph) from the Bishop of Bayeux. It rendered: hides; also 4 hides with Long Ditton; 1 mill without dues, 8 ploughs, acres and rod of meadow. It rendered £6.

The Evelyn family, who had settled in Surrey, played a prominent role and established gunpowder mills at Tolworth, probably in 1561.

In 1870–72, John Marius Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales&quot; described Tolworth like this: &quot;TALWORTH, a hamlet in Long Ditton parish, Surrey; 2½ miles SSE of Kingston upon Thames. Acres, 1,190. Pop., 434. Houses, 81. An ancient manor-house here was held by the Earl of Kent, uncle of Edward III.; and is now a farmhouse.&quot; For much of the 19th century, the Earls of Egmont were Tolworth&#x27;s principal landowners

By 1908 things were changing: the population growth was accelerating due to the development of the brickfields and the construction of Tolworth Sewage Farm (which opened in 1891), both in Red Lion Lane (now Red Lion Road). With a proper sewerage system Tolworth was ready for development. St Matthew&#x27;s Church had been built for a congregation of 800 and trams now ran from the Red Lion.

In 1919 the Medical Officer of Health reported that Surbiton was a residential neighbourhood with no dominating factories or works. The only new feature of late, he said, is the springing up of a few &quot;Motor Garages,&quot; each employing a few hands on the care and repair of cars. He advised that the Electric Light Works and a belated resuscitation of the Tolworth Brickfields represented the leading &quot;Works&quot; in Surbiton. The reference to the brickworks probably relates to it being owned by William Alen until his bankruptcy in 1881. The urban district council entered into an agreement with Callenders Cables &amp; Construction (later to become British Insulated Callender&#x27;s Cables) under which the company laid electrical supply cables around Surbiton. In 1916 the council sold the Surbiton and District Electricity Co, based in Hollyfield Road, to Callenders. The opening of the Kingston by Pass (A3 road) in 1927 was a major catalyst for expansion which included six and a half miles of new residential roads, containing 2000 houses. This period also saw the construction of Tolworth Broadway, aligning with the Kingston Road, on the former Tolworth Lodge Farm.

In the 1930s and &#x27;40s the clay extraction requirements of a brickworks north of the A3 off Red Lion Road (now Red Lion Industrial Park) produced a large water-filled pit (known locally as &quot;The Bluey&quot;) which was used as a landfill site for bomb-damage and industrial material removed from bomb-sites resulting from the &quot;Blitz&quot;. The Civil Defence Corps used to have a training site with a full-size mock-up of a bomb-damaged housing estate. This land has been reclaimed and is now a recreation ground. The Tolworth Brickworks Company Ltd. decided in September 1946 that the company should be voluntarily wound up – a process that continued until at least 1951. Clay extraction also took place at &quot;The Wood&quot; near Surbiton Station, Fishponds Park as well as in Claygate

Off Worcester Park Road/Old Malden Lane was the access to Tolworth Hall and nearby, along the Hogsmill River, were watercress beds.

Until 1965 Tolworth, as a part of Surbiton, was in the county of Surrey.

===The Station Estate===
&quot;The Estate that never was&quot;: plans for the Station Estate were approved by Surbiton Corporation and Surrey County Council in January 1940, comprising 459 houses and 10 shops on four sites, separated by the Kingston Road and the Southern Railway Chessington Branch Line (which was to be extended to Leatherhead).

As part of the agreement the owners gave up part of the land to form the wider and re-aligned Kingston Road. Dean Court and Drayton Court were constructed in 1959 on part of the &quot;Station Estate&quot; land and the Developer &quot;Lansdowne Court Investments&quot; is acknowledged in the naming of Lansdowne Close. Earlier plans had envisaged six semi detached and one detached house between the Toby Jug and Tolworth Station.

===Wartime Bomb Damage===
During World War II a number of V1 flying bombs came down on Surbiton and Tolworth, including the notorious &quot;Derby Day Disaster&quot; of June 1944 when 12 people were killed by a V1 at Tolworth Park Road. Between 7 October 1940 and 6 June 1941, 25 high explosive bombs dropped on the current Tolworth and Hook Rise ward but there were as many again in the few adjacent streets around Douglas Road which is now part of Surbiton Hill ward.

=== The Ace of Spades===
A short distance away is the Ace of Spades (junction) at Hook, named after the famous &quot;Ace of Spades Roadhouse&quot; which became a popular venue following the opening of the Kingston by Pass in 1927 by the Minister of Transport, Stanley Baldwin. This was described as a pioneer roadhouse, with meals served at any time in a restaurant with seating for 700 to 800, dancing until 3 am, a swimming pool, miniature golf course, polo ground, riding school, and an air strip. The pub was burnt down in the 1950s.

===Historic bus stop===
Until 2011, the green at the junction of Ewell Road, Red Lion Road and King Charles Road opposite the former Red Lion Public house was the site of an extremely rare double fronted wooden bus stop, located at the former Tolworth turning point of the 603 trolleybus service, which ceased in May 1962. (It was previously served by trams between 1906 and 1931.) The shelter was removed after Transport for London decided that it was the only bus stop they were not prepared to maintain, on the basis that it was wooden.

===Musical heritage===

David Bowie launched his Ziggy Stardust stage show with the Spiders from Mars at the Toby Jug pub in Tolworth on 10 February 1972. Other bands to play there included Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac, The Yardbirds, John Lee Hooker, Black Sabbath, King Crimson, Blodwyn Pig, John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers, Free, Jethro Tull, Taste, Family, Chicken Shack, Genesis and Ten Years After. The Toby Jug pub was demolished in the year 2000, becoming part of the controversial Tesco site (&quot;detailed later in this article&quot;). It is reported that there was a Maestrovox electronic organ attached to the piano in the pub dining room and dance hall. The pub is remembered by the naming of the adjacent Toby Way.

During the 1980s gigs were occasionally held at Tolworth Recreation Centre, including on 12 March 1983 a gig by New Order.

==Description==
Architecturally, Tolworth consists mainly of low-density 1930s semi-detached properties, and small to medium commercial and retail developments. There is a concentration of industrial activity in an area bounded on the north by A3 London-to-Portsmouth trunk route, which runs through the area. The access junction for the A3, linking it on the north with the Broadway and on the south with the A240 Kingston Road toward Epsom, is known as the Toby Jug Roundabout, named after the public house which stood beside it until it was closed and demolished in 2002 under the ownership of Tesco and its partners. The area is also served by a branch railway line running from London Waterloo to Chessington South two stops to the south, with services run by South Western Railway.

==Facilities==

===Tolworth Tower===

The principal shopping centre is situated west of the A3 in Tolworth Broadway, with the landmark Tolworth Tower, at its junction with the A3. Tolworth Tower, built on the site of the former Tolworth Odeon Cinema is an office block designed by George Marsh of R. Seifert and Partners and opened in 1963. 

The tower is 265 feet high with 22 floors. The ground floor of the building is occupied largely by a single retail unit, originally a Fine Fare supermarket which traded until the early 1980s, and is currently a Marks and Spencer supermarket – and smaller retail units along the Broadway, the remainder taken up with access to the other floors. The remaining floors of the building were originally occupied by commercial and government offices, but the north wing has recently re-opened as a Travelodge hotel. The building is a local landmark and is the tallest building for miles around.

The offices and studios of 107.8 Radio Jackie, a commercial radio station broadcasting to south-west London and north Surrey, can be found on the Broadway in what had been the Crown Post Office. The broadcast mast is sited, with many other antennas, atop Tolworth Tower.

===The Tolworth Greenway===

The Tolworth Greenway was a public space planning scheme, the Mayor&#x27;s &quot;Great Outdoors&quot; initiative. The barrier on the central reservation was removed, which itself has been widened. The stripey green &quot;sureset&quot; resin surface allows users to walk the length of Tolworth Broadway on the Greenway and to cross the Kingston ByPass (A3) at street level. The scheme aimed to revitalise Tolworth Broadway, improve safety and reduce traffic speeds. Critics believed that the area would be more dangerous, as pedestrians would cross the road wherever they chose.

===Tolworth Court Farm===
This historic farm site dates back to Norman times. Tolworth Court Farm Fields is now a Local Nature Reserve, and consists of a system of fields and hedgerows. Previously owned by the London Borough of Lambeth, it was purchased by the Royal Borough of Kingston in the 1980s. There is access from Kingston Road (A240) near Jubilee Way.

===Community Centre===
Tolworth is the home of the arts centre: The CornerHOUSE (Previously known as the Douglas Centre).

===Police Stations ===
Surbiton Police station was opened in 1888 on the site of the previous Toll House on the corner of Ditton Road/Ellerton Road and Ewell Road. The red brick building was demolished many years ago but the site continued with police related use as a car compound and with staff operating from temporary cabins. The site was developed into Watton Point flats by CNM Estates. The Police station moved to the former St Matthew&#x27;s School building on the other side of the Ewell Road in 1977 where there was vehicle parking. It was also near the Metropolitan Police Garage in Hollyfield Road acquired in 1968 – formerly used by the Cooper Car Company. All have now been vacated by the Police. The building has been sympathetically restored to its previous educational use and is currently a venue for London Tutorial College, offering GCSE and A level programmes as well as language courses for domestic and international students. The Neighbourhood Office in Millbank House, Surbiton, which opened in 2011 has also now closed.

===Tolworth Hospital===
Tolworth Hospital originally built as an isolation Hospital provides services for South West London and St George&#x27;s Mental Health NHS Trust. The Trust provides mental health and social care service to the residents of Kingston, Richmond, Merton, Sutton and Wandsworth boroughs, as well as a number of specialist regional and national services.

===Churches===

Tolworth has two parish churches; an Anglican one in Hamilton Avenue, dedicated to Saint George, which was built in 1934 and not given its own parish until 2015; and a Roman Catholic one in Ewell Road, dedicated to Our Lady Immaculate, which was completed in 1958 and consecrated in 1963, replacing an earlier 1930s chapel. There is also a United Reformed Church in Elgar Avenue.

===Development===
CNM Estates have obtained planning permission for a 142-bed hotel, conferencing facility and associated parking close to Tolworth railway station.

== Tesco-owned former green fields ==
An 11-acre site bounded by the railway line serving Tolworth to the east, the A240 to the north and Hook Rise South &amp; the A3 to the West. Plans were drawn up in the 1930s for the site to be used for circa 130 family homes in a similar style to much of Tolworth – this was part of a larger development to be known as the &quot;Station Estate&quot; (see above).

As part of the war effort, the land was taken over by the Ministry of Works and developed from green fields in the 1940s. It became an extensive but discreet development of low single-story brick building covering the majority of the site. It remained in Government hands for a variety of uses from the MAFF and Ministry of Defence to the Directorate of Overseas Surveys; in its heyday it was reported to have employed over 1,000 people. It was finally vacated by the last 370 MAFF staff in October 1998 in preparation for sale.

Tesco purchased the site by private treaty in 2002, meaning it was never offered for sale on the open market. In 2000 the vacant possession value of the site was stated in Hansard as being £9.6 million. A number of surrounding buildings were purchased by Chinacorp, a developer working with Tesco.

The site is zoned by the local authority, Kingston Council, for residential and community use. The site has been subject to a number of planning applications for the construction of a retail store of up to 89,000 sq feet and up to 660 dwellings in buildings up to 12 storeys high.

Tesco sold the site in 2015 to developer Meyer Homes, who got permission from the Planning Inspectorate in July 2019 for a 950-home development (including a new nursery, doctor&#x27;s surgery and police building).

==Transport==

===National Rail===
Tolworth railway station is served by South Western Railway services direct to London Waterloo (northbound) and Chessington South (southbound). Trains come to the station every half-hour from a little after 06:30 until 21:00 after which it is hourly until the last train a little after 23:00. Trains also stop at Raynes Park, Wimbledon, Clapham Junction and Vauxhall.

Fishponds Park in Surbiton sits on the Tolworth border (Fishponds was a Georgian house built between 1740 and 1742, part of the estate of Sir Frederick Butler of the tobacco family, bought by Surbiton Urban District Council in 1935).

A chicken shop on Tolworth Broadway, Chicken King, gained recognition after the Chicken Connoisseur reviewed it on an episode of &quot;The Pengest Munch&quot;. It was rated a 4/5 overall and dubbed &quot;fairly decent&quot;.

== Nearby Places ==

==Industry==
Apart from the MoD and DOS sites on the south side of the A3, Gala Cosmetics had a large production facility (at the start of Oakcroft Road) as did Andre Rubber Co (who specialised in bonding rubber to metal and made components for cars, docks, armoured fighting vehicles, hospitals, warships and diving helmets) – now the site of the Hook Rise South Industrial Park. Founded by Theodore Bernard Andre they boasted of having three acres of specialised rubber technology.

Prior to the construction of Sundial Court there was a camping goods supplier – the previous building having been partially demolished due to road widening. 
Siebe Gorman a company that developed diving and breathing equipment purchased 6 acres of land at Tolworth in 1938 – the new building was named Neptune Works, on Davis Road (off Cox Lane) and near to King George&#x27;s Field – although this would probably be regarded as Chessington nowadays. Local businessman Eric Miller recalls a part-time job filling breathing masks with carbon granules at Siebe Gorman and also with the nearby J. Lyons and Co. bakery in Cox Lane.

===Hillaldam and Galleon===

Hillaldam Coburn (previously known as E. Hill Aldam and Co) a sliding door gear manufacturer operated from Earlsfield before moving to Brittanic Works, Red Lion Road, Tolworth in 1959 where they remained until 1989

They were a sister company of English Fireplaces (Wimbledon) Ltd set up by Ernest Hill Aldam, Kenneth Aldam and Donald Aldam using the Galleon Trade Mark. The company was established in May 1938 operating from Haslsemere Avenue, Earlsfield, SW18. In September 1953 the company resolved to purchase the former Brickworks in Tolworth as tenants in common with E Hill Aldam &amp; Co for a cost of £30,000 being shared between the companies. (The Tolworth Brickworks Company Ltd. had opted to be voluntarily wound up – see above). English Fireplaces and Hillaldam then set about redeveloping the site demolishing existing buildings – there had previously been buildings with 5 chimneys on the site. In 1955 the company became English Fireplaces (Galleon) Ltd. and in 1979 became Galleon Claygate Ltd. Galleon now have showrooms in the Ewell Road. The leases of cottages at 220–236 Red Lion Road were purchased in 1961 and a number of properties fronting Red Lion Road were subsequently demolished to form car parking.

===Radar===
Decca Radar&#x27;s Radar Research and Development laboratories moved to the Tolworth roundabout in the former Fox and Nicholl factory. Decca&#x27;s standards department was located at 456 Ewell Road. Decca&#x27;s well-resourced sports ground existed until recently as &quot;Deckers&quot; but has now become a 5-a-side football centre.

===Motor Industry===

Fox and Nicholl were a pre-war Lagonda car specialist based adjacent to the Tolworth roundabout. HRG Engineering Company also known as HRG, was a British car manufacturer based in Oakcroft Road, (then Tolworth) which had been founded in 1936 by Major Edward Halford, Guy Robins and Henry Ronald Godfrey. They ceased trading in 1966 although production had finished 10 years earlier. Nearby at 243 Ewell Road and in Hollyfield Road was the Cooper Car Company founded in 1947 – according to an article by Phil Cooper in &quot;The Good Life&quot; newspaper during the 1950s, F1 cars were regularly driven along the Ewell Road by Cooper Car Company. Other motoring connections nearby included Jack Brabham whose workshop was in Chessington and AC Cars in Thames Ditton owned by (William) Derek Hurlock who lived in Long Ditton.

===Aircraft and Armaments Manufacture===
Fox and Nicholl moved to wartime aircraft industry production – handling large quantities of sheet metal work, sub-assemblies. LF Peatty and Southborough Sheet Metal also manufactured parts for the de Havilland Mosquito

Nash and Thompson was a British engineering firm established by Archibald Frazer-Nash and Henry Ronald Godfrey. (See also HRG). They were based in Oakcroft Road and specialised in the production of hydraulically operated gun turrets for aircraft. The company was also an important manufacturer of hydraulic powered radar scanners

United Insulator Co manufactured capacitors and were suppliers to the aircraft industry. They were based in Oakcroft Road.

==Commerce==
The Co-op (RACS), Woolworths, Victor Towler had 8 shops in the Broadway at their peak and Bryants along with others, including Beswicks, Bata, Edmund Goodrich, Hallewells, Beths and Veritys, had shops. There was a Blue Star garage and milk was delivered by Jobs Dairy from 432 Ewell Road – (the company was sold to Unigate in 1987). In Lenelby Road was the Royal Windsor Laundry employing 100 girls by 1920.

<text>Tooting is a district in South London, forming part of the London Borough of Wandsworth. It is located south south-west of Charing Cross.

==History==

Tooting has been settled since pre-Saxon times. The name is of Anglo-Saxon origin but the meaning is disputed. It could mean &quot;the people of Tota&quot;, in which context Tota may have been a local Anglo-Saxon chieftain. Alternatively it could be derived from an old meaning of the verb &quot;to tout&quot;, to look out. There may have been a watchtower here on the road to London and hence &quot;the people of the look-out post.&quot;

The Romans built a road, which was later named Stane Street by the English, from London (Londinium) to Chichester (Noviomagus Regnorum), and which passed through Tooting. Tooting High Street is built on this road. In Saxon times, Tooting and Streatham (then Toting-cum-Stretham) was given to the Abbey of Chertsey. Later, Suene (Sweyn), believed to be a Viking, may have been given all or part of the land. In 933, King Æthelstan is thought to have confirmed lands including Totinge (Tooting) to Chertsey Abbey.

Tooting appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Totinges&quot;: Lower Tooting was held from Chertsey Abbey by Haimo the Sheriff (of Kent) when its assets were 1 church, ploughlands of land and of meadow. Its people were called to render £4 per year to their overlords. Later in the Norman period, it came into the possession of the De Gravenel family, after whom it was named Tooting Graveney. Until minor changes in the 19th century it consisted of . The ancient parish of Tooting Graveney included the southern part of what is now Streatham.

Upper Tooting, or Tooting Bec (for centuries administered as part of Streatham), appears as a manor held by the Abbey of Hellouin Bec, in Normandy, thus acquiring the &quot;Bec&quot; in its name. Its Domesday assets were 5 hides. It had ploughlands and so was assessed as rendering £7.

As with many of South London&#x27;s suburbs, Tooting developed during the late Victorian period. Some development occurred in the Edwardian era but another large spurt in growth happened during the 1920s and 30s.

* 1902: Tooting Library opened as a one-storey structure. A second storey was added in 1906. In 2012 the library was extended and refurbished
* 1906: Tooting Bec Lido opened
* 1930: St Benedict&#x27;s Hospital established by the London County Council
* 1931: Granada cinema opened with the film &quot;Monte Carlo&quot;
* 1954: St George&#x27;s Hospital begins to relocate to Tooting from Hyde Park Corner, taking over the old Grove Fever and Fountain Hospitals
* 2003: Redevelopment of St George&#x27;s Hospital buildings completed

==Politics==
The Member of Parliament for Tooting is Dr Rosena Allin-Khan of the Labour Party, who was first elected in a 2016 by-election to represent the parliamentary constituency of Tooting. This followed the election of her predecessor Sadiq Khan to the role of Mayor of London in May 2016.

Since the creation of the Tooting seat, it has been held by Labour, often with a marginal result against a Conservative Party challenge. Although the constituency boundaries include wards represented by both Labour and the Conservatives, the Tooting ward itself can be regarded as a Labour stronghold, electing a full slate of councillors from the party.

==Demographics==
Tooting has a large British Asian community and has gained the nickname &quot;land of the curry mile&quot; due to the concentration of South Asian restaurants.

In the 2011 census, Tooting was White or White British (47%), Asian or Asian British (28.8%), Black or Black British (15.5%), Mixed/multiple ethnic groups (5%), and Other ethnic group (2.9%). The largest single ethnicity is White British (32.4%).

The main spoken first languages are English, followed by Urdu, Punjabi, Polish and Gujarati.

==Transport==
Tooting is positioned on the Northern line—with stations at the top and the bottom of the hill that slopes down the High Street, Tooting Bec and Tooting Broadway. Tooting is also served by National Rail at Tooting railway station providing a direct link south to Sutton via Wimbledon, and north to Farringdon, St Pancras and on to Luton.

It also has several bus links, with routes to and from Central London, Richmond, Croydon, Sutton and Kingston amongst others.

Tooting Broadway tube station is currently being considered by TfL as a stop on the future Crossrail 2 development. In addition to relieving congestion on the Northern Line, this would provide Tooting with a rapid and direct connection to major London stations such as Clapham Junction, Victoria, Tottenham Court Road and Euston.

==Conservation area==
Totterdown Fields estate was designated a conservation area on 19 September 1978. It was the first London County Council cottage estate built between 1901 and 1911, containing 1244 individual houses over . It was influenced by Ebenezer Howard&#x27;s Garden city movement and the Arts and Crafts movement.

==Social housing estates==
As previously mentioned, Totterdown Fields estate has considerable historical significance, being the first &quot;cottage estate&quot; within London and later protected from redevelopment through its designation as a conservation area. Within the London Borough of Wandsworth, Tooting has the fourth-highest number of social housing accommodation after Roehampton, Battersea and Southfields in that order. Notable large post-modern estates within the area are the: Aboyne/Holborn and Hazelhurst with smaller estates including: Bevill Allen Close, Burtop Road, Copeland House, Flowersmead, Newlands and Tooting Grove.

==Open spaces==

A large open area, popularly known as the Tooting Commons, lies at the northern end of Tooting. Historically this was two separate open spaces: Tooting Graveney Common (formerly part of Tooting Graveney parish), and Tooting Bec Common (formerly part of Streatham parish). The commons are home to Tooting Bec Lido, which is .

==Sport==
Tooting shares two football clubs with nearby Mitcham: Tooting &amp; Mitcham FC and Tooting &amp; Mitcham Wanderers FC.

A greyhound racing track, the &#x27;Wimbledon Stadium&#x27;, was narrowly in Tooting on Plough Lane. AFC Wimbledon moved to the site in 2021.

==Markets==
Tooting has two indoor markets, with numbers of permanent stalls. The entrances of both are situated on the same street, Tooting High Street, only a few metres apart. They both have many types of outlets, but since the 2010s have also developed a focus on street food stalls. Tooting Market is the smaller of the two; the other, The Broadway Market, is one of the largest of London&#x27;s indoor markets, having more than ninety stalls, and has been active since 1936.

<doc id="94329" wikidata="Q149716" url="?curid=94329" title="Totteridge">
<text>Totteridge is a residential area and former village in the London Borough of Barnet, England. It is a mixture of suburban development and open land (including some farmland) situated 8 miles (13 km) north north-west of Charing Cross. It is part of the Whetstone postal district (N20).

It gives its name to a ward in the borough and to the &quot;St Andrew, Totteridge&quot; ecclesiastical parish of the Diocese of St Albans.

==History==

This area was called Tataridge in the 13th century. It may have been named after someone called Tata. The ridge is the high ground between the valleys of the Dollis Brook and Folly Brook. Over the centuries the rural qualities of Totteridge have attracted well-to-do families. Cardinal Manning was born at Copped Hall in Totteridge in 1808. With the opening of the Great Northern Railway station in 1872, late-Victorian and Edwardian mansions were built around the old village. In line with overall trends in the late 1930s, following the conversion of the railway station (in operation from 1872 until 1941) into a London Underground station (from 1940) on the Northern line, smaller properties were built within walking distance of the station (Totteridge and Whetstone tube station). In 1968 much of Totteridge was designated a Conservation Area, and no major developments have taken place since then.

Totteridge was a civil parish of Hertfordshire covering an area of and formed part of a narrow salient into Middlesex. It became part of Barnet Rural District and had a parish council from 1894 to 1914. It then formed part of Barnet Urban District from 1914 to 1965. In 1965, the parish and urban district were abolished by the London Government Act 1963 and the area was transferred from Hertfordshire to Greater London, to become part of the London Borough of Barnet. In 1901 the parish had a population of 844 and by 1951 it had risen to 4,500.

==Geography and landmarks==
The boundary to the north and east is the Dollis Brook and the boundary to the south is that river&#x27;s tributary, the Folly Brook. While these rivers define the area covered by the residents&#x27; association, the southern part of the area (with postcode N12 rather than N20) is often regarded as being in Woodside Park.

The main road is the A5109, which runs roughly east–west. The western part is called Totteridge Common, the next part is called Totteridge Village, the central part by the village green is called Totteridge Green, and the eastern part is called Totteridge Lane; the Lane continues into Whetstone, terminating at its junction with High Road, Whetstone (the A1000). At the western end of Totteridge Common is a set of traffic lights; the road to the north from these lights, Hendon Wood Lane, is just to the west of the western boundary.

St. Andrew&#x27;s Church stands on the ancient circle site, with a chapel known to have been located here from 1250. The rounded boundaries of the churchyard imply an underlying mote and ancient meeting place. The ancient yew tree in the churchyard is about 2,000 years old (as estimated by Kew Gardens experts) and is the oldest tree in London (also included in the book &quot;100 Greatest Trees of London). The Tithe Barn and the adjacent animal pound (for lost and strayed livestock), now both part of the Pound House (built in 1907 by prominent Arts &amp; Crafts architect J L Williams), date from the 17th and 16th centuries respectively. In 1790–1791, during the church renovation, all church services were conducted in the Tithe Barn. The West End House barn and Laurel Farm barn were built in the 17th century, and have now been converted into private houses. Timber-framed buildings from the Tudor era also include Willow House and Rose Cottage.

Several important local houses were demolished by developers between the two World Wars, including Copped Hall and Poynters Hall. 

Totteridge has many spacious detached properties in a green setting that are highly valued; some of them are among the most expensive houses in London. Its past and present residents have included the rich and famous, including Arsène Wenger, Frankie Vaughan, Des O&#x27;Connor, Cliff Richard, Mickie Most, Hank Marvin, David Dein, Mike Ashley, Bruce Forsyth, David Ginola, Lord Levy and other dignitaries. More modest housing, much of it semi-detached, predominates at the eastern end of Totteridge.

<text>Tufnell Park is an area in north London, England, in the London boroughs of Islington and Camden. 

The neighbourhood is served by Tufnell Park tube station on the Northern Line.

==History==

===Origins and boundary===
;Medieval and later manor

Tufnell Park Road, a straight of , was sometimes conjectured by historians to follow the line of a Roman track. There is no evidence of Roman activity in the area and a supposed Roman camp marked on Dent&#x27;s 1805 parish map has been shown by Museum of London Archaeology excavations to probably be a misidentified medieval moated site. The road has for centuries been an east–west connector between the roads from the hearts of Islington and Camden which converge into a major northern route at Archway market place, across 500 metres of Dartmouth Park district to the north.

;Boundaries
North-east of Tufnell Park Road, the housing is closer to Upper Holloway railway station and so is popularly considered to be Upper Holloway district. On all other sides of the road is Tufnell Park based on nearest rail/tube station.

The road which Tufnell Park Road links have been greatly alleviated from sole principal status by diverting in the 20th century the A1 through Edgware where the M1 also runs instead of its old route through High Barnet, converging the route with the straighter A41 road from Marylebone. The A1 road in the east of Tufnell Park is therefore less arterial which reinforces the loss of its old name &quot;the Great North Road&quot;, a historical coaching road. It specifically serves vehicles driven between the A1 or M1 and the City of London.

;Hackney Brook
Rising north of here at Mercers Road, Hackney Brook, culverted today, ran south to cross Holloway Road near Tufnell Park Road and then flowed to Lowman Road, where it turned north-east and ran along Gillespie Road to leave the traditional bounds of Islington at Mountgrove Road.

;Agricultural use
For centuries this northern part of the ancient parish of Islington was part of many square miles renowned for dairy farms which kept the City of London and neighbouring north and west parts supplied with milk. It kept a rural air well into the 19th century in its important role as a base for a number of dairies supplying the capital. In 1753 the area became the property of William Tufnell who was granted the manor of Barnsbury by his father-in-law Sir William Halton. The manor house (now demolished) stood on the site of the large Odeon cinema at the end of Tufnell Park Road where it meets the A1 (Holloway Road). The manor&#x27;s gateposts survive along the west of Tufnell Park Road. Tufnell petitioned Parliament for authority to develop his estate but the building leases he was granted were left unused; his family had a set of rural estates nationwide.

The Tufnell Park estate passed to his brother George Foster Tufnell, MP for Beverley (died 1798), then to George&#x27;s son William Tufnell (died 1809), MP for Colchester, who married in 1804 heiress Mary Carleton (daughter of Thomas Carleton of South Carleton d.1829). Both are buried at St Mary&#x27;s Islington, hence her maiden name appearing as two street names in N7.

The manor then passed to Henry Tufnell (d. 1854), MP for Ipswich and Devonport, Liberal chief whip whose three marriages included two daughters of earls.

The sparse remnants of the freehold passed to Henry Archibald Tufnell (d 1898) who died with no children, and then to Lt Col Edward Tufnell (d. 1909) HM Inspector of Schools, Factory Commissioner, Director Greenwich Hospital.

===Development===

Serious building began in 1845 with a scheme sponsored by Henry Tufnell and designed by John Shaw Jr., who had laid out the Eton Estate in Chalk Farm. This initial work was largely limited to the area around Carleton Road. In 1865 the scheme was taken up by George Truefitt who developed most of the local villas and St. George&#x27;s Church (1865), built for Anglican secessionists. The housing stock was of a solid nature, and Tufnell Park kept its good name until the end of the century. Charles Booth in his survey of &quot;London Life and Labour&quot; reported that the older streets (Anson Road and Carleton Road) housed a mixture of retired merchants and music hall artistes who were rich enough to holiday abroad over winter. He believed that second wave of building around Celia, Hugo, Corinne, Huddleston and Archibald Roads threatened to create a metropolis &quot;from which the rich would soon be going&quot;. The private girls&#x27; school established at the corner of Carleton and Brecknock Roads ceased in 1878 after many of its pupils drowned in the disaster.

Whereas arterial roads and railway lines sliced through Kentish Town and Camden in the 19th century, one neat east–west double track skirts the district. Junction Road railway station was an 1872–1943 direct link with central London, superseded in 1907 by the building of the tube station Tufnell Park. The shabby genteel reputation of Tufnell Park made it a standard comic reference in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. George and Weedon Grossmith locate their aspirational Mr Pooter in Tufnell Park (Upper Holloway) in &quot;Diary of a Nobody&quot;. Julian and Sandy, the camp BBC home service comedians, frequently referenced Tufnell Park as did &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper&#x27;s Biff cartoon in the 1980s. Between 1999 and 2001, Tufnell Park was the location for Channel 4&#x27;s comedy drama, &quot;Spaced&quot;.

*Kentish Town (Thameslink, located towards Camden) (also on the Northern Line)
*Upper Holloway (Overground, located towards Crouch End)
*Gospel Oak (Overground, located towards Hampstead)

London Buses routes 4, 134 and 390 as well as Night Bus N20 serve the area.

The area covered by the modern borough has a long history. Evidence of first-century Roman pottery manufacturing has been found at Brockley Hill and Roman coins from the third and fourth centuries were found at Burnt Oak. Both sites are on the Roman road Watling Street from London (Londinium) to St Albans (Verulamium) which now forms the western border of the borough.

Hendon is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, but the districts of Barnet, Edgware and Finchley were not referred to, possibly because these areas were included in other manors.

In 1471 the Battle of Barnet was fought in Monken Hadley, just within the present borough&#x27;s boundary. It was here that Yorkist troops led by King Edward IV killed the &quot;Kingmaker&quot; Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick and his brother, John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu.

===Administrative history===
A local government district called Barnet was created in 1863 covering the town of Barnet, also known as Chipping Barnet. Such districts were subsequently also created for East Barnet Valley in 1874, Finchley in 1878, Hendon in 1879, and Friern Barnet in 1883. Barnet and East Barnet Valley both straddled Hertfordshire and Middlesex until 1889 when they were placed entirely in Hertfordshire; Hendon, Finchley and Friern Barnet were all in Middlesex.

All five districts were converted into urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. Barnet was enlarged in 1914 to take in Totteridge, and Hendon was enlarged in 1931 to take in Edgware. Hendon was made a municipal borough in 1932, as was Finchley in 1933. East Barnet Valley was renamed East Barnet in 1935.

The modern borough was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, covering the combined area of the former boroughs of Finchley and Hendon and urban districts of Barnet, East Barnet and Friern Barnet. The area was transferred from Middlesex and Hertfordshire to Greater London, to become one of the 32 London boroughs.

The 1963 Act did not include a name for the new borough. A joint committee of the councils due to be amalgamated suggested &quot;Northgate&quot; or &quot;Northern Heights&quot;. Keith Joseph, the Minister of Housing and Local Government, eventually chose Barnet. The place name Barnet is derived from the Old English &quot;bærnet&quot; meaning &quot;land cleared by burning&quot;. The old Barnet Urban District had been the least populous of the five predecessor districts at the 1961 census; nearly half the new borough&#x27;s population lived in the old borough of Hendon.

When the present borough was created, it included part of Elstree. On 1 April 1993 Barnet&#x27;s northern boundary was altered and some of its more rural northern parts, including Elstree, were transferred to Hertfordshire (and its district of Hertsmere).

==Governance==
The local authority is Barnet Council, which meets at Hendon Town Hall and has its main offices at 2 Bristol Avenue in the Colindale area of the borough.

===Greater London representation===
For elections to the Greater London Council, the borough formed the Barnet electoral division, electing four members. In 1973 it was divided into the single-member Chipping Barnet, Finchley, Hendon North and Hendon South. The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986.

Since 2000, Barnet Council along with the 31 other London boroughs and the City of London Corporation share local government powers with Greater London Authority. The Barnet and Camden London Assembly constituency covers the London Borough of Barnet and the London Borough of Camden and is represented on the London Assembly by one constituency Assembly Member.

===Parliamentary constituencies===
The residents of London Borough of Barnet are represented at Westminster by Members of Parliament (MPs) for three parliamentary constituencies. All three MPs are represented by Labour since 2024, overturning three previous Conservative MPs.

Chipping Barnet is represented by Dan Tomlinson. Finchley and Golders Green is represented by Sarah Sackman. Hendon, in 2024 the most marginal Labour-held seat in the country with a majority of 15 votes, is represented by David Pinto-Duschinsky.

==Geography==


The borough covers a group of hills on the northern edge of the London Basin. The bedrock is chalk which is covered with clay. Some of the hills are formed from glacial till deposited at the farthest extent of glaciers during the Anglian glaciation.

The pattern of settlement is somewhat diverse.

In the north of the borough on the eastern side is Barnet, also known as High Barnet or Chipping Barnet, Totteridge, and Whetstone. In the north on the western side is Edgware and Mill Hill. The central northern part of the borough is largely countryside. This division is largely because the eastern side grew around what is now the High Barnet Underground branch of the Northern line. The western side grew around the Midland Railway and what is now the Edgware branch of the Northern line.

Further south, around the borough&#x27;s centre, the development becomes steadily more intensive around the suburbs of Cricklewood, Colindale, Hendon and Finchley. Golders Green is renowned for its Jewish minority ethnic population and forms part of the south of the borough, along with Hampstead Garden Suburb and Childs Hill.

Much of the borough is within the Metropolitan Green Belt, and it has many parks and open spaces. In addition there are large areas taken over by cemeteries and golf courses, and part of Hampstead Heath, Hampstead Heath Extension and Golders Hill Park. Barnet describes its 16 main open spaces as &#x27;premier parks&#x27;, nine of which achieved a Green Flag Award for 2008–2009:

The borough has sixty-seven Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation, eight Local Nature Reserves, and it is jointly responsible with the London Borough of Brent for the Welsh Harp (Brent) Reservoir, which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. These are listed in Nature reserves in Barnet.
The A5 (Edgware Road) forms the border between Barnet and the boroughs of Brent and Harrow, with an exception being the West Hendon area and part of the Welsh Harp.

==Landmarks==

Barnet has two Grade I listed buildings, both designed by Edwin Lutyens: the Church of St Jude, the parish church of Hampstead Garden Suburb with a Gothic spire and on the opposite side of Central Square, the Free Church, of similar design but with a concrete dome.

Odeon Cinema, Barnet is a Grade II listed building located on Great North Road. 

The Royal Air Force Museum is a large multi-building museum built on part of the site of Hendon Aerodrome, dedicated to the history of aviation, and the British Royal Air Force in particular.

Church Farmhouse Museum on Greyhound Hill in Hendon is a grade II* listed 17th-century farmhouse used by Barnet Council as an exhibition space and museum until the Council closed it to save money on 31 March 2011. Early in 2014 it was given the classification of &quot;vulnerable&quot; by English Heritage after having stood abandoned for almost three years. It now houses units of Middlesex University.

Friern Hospital was a large Victorian psychiatric hospital located in Friern Barnet, which has been converted into expensive apartments.

==Sport==
The borough is traditionally home to a professional football club, Barnet F.C. and non-League football clubs Wingate &amp; Finchley F.C., Hendon F.C., London Lions and Edgware Town. Wingate is the last of these with a home ground in the Borough; Hendon and Edgware play in the Borough of Brent, and Barnet F.C. play in the Borough of Harrow. Barnet is also home to the Barnet Nightingales Girls Football Club and Barnet Judo Club. 

Since 2013 rugby union Premiership outfit Saracens F.C. have called the borough home, playing matches at StoneX Stadium at Barnet Copthall which was previously a community sports stadium and is still used in this capacity thanks to Saracens using movable stands for their matches. As well as athletics facilities, the complex also has a swimming pool.

==Demographics==

In 1801, the civil parishes that form the modern borough had a total population of 6,404; and the area was characterised by farming and woodland — with settlement principally around the Great North Road. By 1830, a new turnpike, the Finchley Road was constructed and horse-drawn omnibuses introduced. The population rose dramatically with the arrival of the trams and railways in the middle of 19th century, and new estates were built to house commuters. As industry relocated away from London during the 1960s, the population entered a decline, that has begun to reverse with new housing developments on brownfield sites.

According to the 2001 census the borough then had a population of 314,564 though the most recent ONS projection for 2008 is 331,500. 67% of householders are owner-occupiers. 47.3% of people described themselves as Christian, with the second largest group being Jewish at 14.8%, the highest percentage in any local government area in the United Kingdom. The third largest was people who said they had no religion at 12.8%. Just over a quarter of people belonged to non-white ethnic groups, up from 18% in the 1991 census. 12.3% were Asian and 6.0% black. Barnet had the largest Chinese population of any London borough in 2001, at 6,379.

As of 2011, 13.3% of the borough&#x27;s population is over 65 - the sixth-highest of London&#x27;s boroughs. The 65+ population is 47,400, the second-highest after Bromley. The Jewish population is 54,084 and represents 15.5% of the population - the highest in the United Kingdom. 41.2% identify themselves as Christians, and 16.1% with no religion.

The following table shows the ethnic group of respondents in the 2001 and 2011 census in Barnet.

===Ethnicity===


=== Religion ===
== Economy ==
Chipping Barnet has been a market town since the thirteenth century, the rest of the area was agricultural. In 1588 Queen Elizabeth I granted a charter to the Lord of the Manor of Barnet to hold a twice yearly horse fair. The first example of an American style out-of-town shopping centre was built at Brent Cross in the 1970s. McDonald&#x27;s has its UK headquarters at East Finchley. Argonaut Games once had its head office in Edgware.

==Transport==

===Transport policy===
Former mayor of London Ken Livingstone said once said that Barnet&#x27;s transport agenda is &quot;recklessly anti-public transport, anti-pedestrian and anti-cycling&quot; and that Barnet has become a &quot;laboratory experiment for some very ill-thought out policies&quot;. In 2004 cycle lanes were removed and cycle training funding cut by the controversial pro-motorist councillor Brian Coleman.

===Road===

The A5 is a major road in that forms much of the borough&#x27;s western border. It is also the first Roman built road in England. It later took the Anglo-Saxon name Watling Street. The Great North Road passes through the borough starting at East Finchley and crossing into Hertfordshire at Monken Hadley. It was a coaching route used by mail coaches between London, York and Edinburgh. The many inns on the road provided accommodation, stabling for the horses and replacement mounts. A section of the A1 road was built to bypass this route through Mill Hill, eventually joining the Great North Road at Hatfield.

The Finchley Road was built as a turnpike in the 1830s linking the West End to Finchley. The A41 splits off from the Finchley Road just before it crosses the borough boundary, briefly merges with the A1 through Mill Hill, leaving the borough at Edgware.

The North Circular Road (or A406) is part of a north orbital route for London; it crosses the borough east–west linking all the other major routes. Junctions one, two and four of the M1 motorway are in the borough. London Gateway services is at the site of the abandoned third junction. The bus routes in the borough are managed by Transport for London.

===Rail===
The borough is served by the northernmost sections of the London Underground&#x27;s Northern line, including all three of the line&#x27;s northern termini (Edgware, High Barnet, and Mill Hill East). The surface sections of the High Barnet and Edgware branches are entirely in the borough. The High Barnet branch surfaces just before East Finchley station. At Finchley Central station there is a single-station spur to Mill Hill East station. The rest of the line continues north through West Finchley, Woodside Park and Totteridge and Whetstone stations to the terminus at High Barnet station.

The Edgware branch emerges at Golders Green station; the line continues on a series of viaducts through Brent Cross station to Hendon Central station. Here it goes through a tunnel before continuing above ground through Colindale and Burnt Oak stations to the terminus at Edgware station. The Piccadilly line, although in the Borough of Enfield, is very close to the border, with buses in Barnet connecting people to the stations.

There are two National Rail routes in Barnet. The Midland Main Line passes through the western edge of the borough, and is served by Thameslink at (from north to south): Mill Hill Broadway, Hendon and Cricklewood. The East Coast Main Line crosses the north-eastern corner of the borough, and is served by the Great Northern Route at New Barnet, Oakleigh Park and New Southgate (which straddles the border with the London Borough of Enfield).

There was a railway line joining the two sides of the borough, part of the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway which was going to be part of the Underground&#x27;s Northern line &quot;Northern Heights&quot; expansion, but steam passenger services beyond Mill Hill East ended in 1939, and the completion of the electrification of this railway was eventually abandoned in the 1950s, primarily because the full extension would have breached the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 6. c. 51). What track was laid, was removed in the 1960s, with a small part of the trackbed used for the M1 motorway extension in the 1970s.

===Travel to work===
In March 2011, the main forms of transport that residents aged 16–74 used to travel to work were (expressed as percentages of all residents aged 16–74):

There are two police stations in the borough at: Colindale and Barnet. Though only Colindale is open to the public. The Peel Centre at Hendon is the Metropolitan Police College.

Statutory emergency fire service is provided by the London Fire Brigade. There are four fire stations that operate in the Borough of Barnet. These are mobilised to protect around 330,000 people. The main risks identified in the borough include Brent Cross Shopping Centre, Coppetts Wood Hospital and Barnet Hospital. Between the four stations; six pumping appliances, One Operational Support Unit and a High Volume Pump are operated.

<text>Tulse Hill is a district in the London Borough of Lambeth in South London that sits on Brockwell Park. It is approximately five miles from Charing Cross and is bordered by Brixton, Dulwich, Herne Hill, Streatham and West Norwood.

==History==
The area known as Tulse Hill is part of the former Manor or Manors of Bodley, Upgroves and Scarlettes whose precise boundaries are now uncertain. The name of the area comes from the Tulse family who came into ownership of farmland in the area during the period of the Commonwealth in the 1650s. Sir Henry Tulse was Lord Mayor of London in 1683 and his daughter Elizabeth married Richard Onslow, 1st Baron Onslow. The land remained in Onslow ownership until 1789 when most of it was purchased by William Cole. The estate was further divided on Cole&#x27;s death in 1807.

The western part was left to &quot;Mercy Cressingham, spinster&quot; (now commemorated by the Cressingham Gardens estate in the area) and the eastern part -now mostly occupied by Brockwell Park - was left to Richard Ogbourne who promptly sold it on to John Blades.

In 1810 Tulse Hill Farm was the only building in the western part of the area. The enclosure of land in the parish of Lambeth in 1811 led to the construction of Effra Road in the area immediately to the north. Together with improvements to Brixton Road by the local turnpike trust this greatly improved road communications with central London, and the value of the local landholdings.

Mercy Cressingham eventually married Dr Thomas Edwards, who took the initiative in buying extra land to make an access from Brixton Hill in 1814 and laying out two new roads, Lower Tulse Hill Road (now known simply as Tulse Hill) and Upper Tulse Hill Road (now Upper Tulse Hill), by 1821. A plan of 1821 in the RIBA Library shows a proposed speculative development of both the Edwards estate and the adjacent Blades estate with large detached villas, although only the former actually came to fruition. The new roads were adopted by the parish in 1822.

An 1832 map shows that Tulse Hill still had only a few buildings on the new roads in contrast to nearby recently developed areas in Brixton and Norwood and the longer established hamlet of Dulwich. However, by 1843, there was a continuous line of houses, predominantly detached and usually with separate coach houses along the full length of Lower Tulse Hill Road from Brixton to the top of the hill.

Development of the area to the east of this road commenced in 1845 when Trinity Rise was built to connect Upper Tulse Hill with Norwood Road. Holy Trinity Church on Trinity Rise was built in 1855-6 and is now grade II listed.

Major development of the area further east did not come until the opening of the Herne Hill and Tulse Hill railway stations in the 1860s.

Most of the original villas with large gardens on the original Edwards-Cressingham landholding have been redeveloped at much higher densities for council housing since the 1930s.

The most prominent survival of 19th century Tulse Hill is Berry House, later called Silwood Hall, and now forming the front part of St Martin-In-The-Fields High School for Girls, a Church of England secondary school which outlasted the nearby 1950s schools before its closure in 2024.

The redevelopment of Tulse Hill after World War II by the London County Council had included the construction of two large secondary schools - Tulse Hill School and Dick Sheppard School (originally for girls only). Both schools have now closed, and their sites have been redeveloped for housing of very contrasting types. The Dick Sheppard School site was redeveloped as Brockwell Gate, a gated Regency style with houses and apartments overlooking Brockwell Park. The site of Tulse Hill school was redeveloped as affordable housing.

== Politics ==
Tulse Hill is represented on the Lambeth London Borough Council by councillors for the Brixton Rush Common, St Martin&#x27;s, and West Dulwich wards. All three wards are held by the Labour Party although the ward now known as West Dulwich was historically a Conservative ward until the 2014 Lambeth London Borough Council election. Tulse Hill is represented in the London Assembly by Marina Ahmad and in Westminster by Helen Hayes and Bell Ribeiro-Addy.

In March 2022 Lambeth Council initiated a consultation with residents as to renaming the area, to avoid a possible association with Henry Tulse who was once a board member of the Royal African Company, a slave-trading concern in the seventeenth century.

== Transport ==

===Buses===
The area is served by London Buses routes 2, 68, 196, 201, 322, 415, 432, 468 and P13.

===Rail===
Tulse Hill railway station (Zone 3) is served by the Southern Metro via Peckham Rye line (to London Bridge) and the Thameslink Wimbledon loop (to St Albans via Blackfriars, City Thameslink, Farringdon, and St Pancras). The railway bridge over the A205 was frequently subject to vehicle strikes until a new warning system was installed in 2017. 

Nearby stations provide services to Victoria from Herne Hill and West Dulwich (via the Southeastern Metro Bromley South line) and from West Norwood (via the Southern Crystal Palace line). 

The nearest London Underground station is Brixton on the Victoria line.

===Roads===

At the southern end of Tulse Hill is a major road junction between the A204 (&quot;Tulse Hill&quot;), A205 (&quot;South Circular&quot;) and the A215 (&quot;Norwood Road&quot;) where the historic Tulse Hill Hotel stands.

<doc id="94336" wikidata="Q1143278" url="?curid=94336" title="Twickenham">
<text>Twickenham is a suburban district of London, England, on the River Thames southwest of Charing Cross. Historically in Middlesex, since 1965 it has formed part of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, whose administrative headquarters are in the area.

The population, including St Margarets and Whitton, was 62,148 at the 2011 census.

Twickenham is the home of the Rugby Football Union, with hundreds of thousands of spectators visiting Twickenham Stadium each year. The historic riverside area has a network of 18th-century buildings and pleasure grounds, many of which have survived intact.

This area has three grand period mansions with public access: York House, Marble Hill and Strawberry Hill House. Another has been lost, that belonging to 18th-century aphoristic poet Alexander Pope, who was known as the &quot;Bard of Twickenham&quot;. Strawberry Hill, the Neo-Gothic prototype home of Horace Walpole is linked with the oldest Roman Catholic university in the country, St Mary&#x27;s University.

==History==
===Pre-Norman===
Excavations have revealed settlements in the area dating from the Early Neolithic, possibly Mesolithic, periods. Occupation seems to have continued through the Bronze Age, the Iron Age and the Roman occupation. The area was first mentioned (as &quot;Tuican hom&quot; and &quot;Tuiccanham&quot;) in an 8th-century charter to cede the area to Waldhere, Bishop of London, &quot;for the salvation of our souls&quot;. The charter, dated 13 June 704, is signed with 12 crosses. The signatories included Swaefred of Essex, Cenred of Mercia and Earl Paeogthath.

===Norman===
In Norman times Twickenham was part of the Manor of Isleworth – itself part of the Hundred of Hounslow, Middlesex (mentioned in Domesday Book of 1086). The manor had belonged to Ælfgār, Earl of Mercia in the time of Edward the Confessor, but was granted to Walter de Saint-Valery (Waleric) by William I of England after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. The area was farmed, while the river provided opportunities for fishing, boatbuilding and trade.

===17th century===

Bubonic plague spread to the town in 1665 and 67 deaths were recorded. It appears that Twickenham had a pest house in the 17th century, although the location is not known.

There was also a watch house in the middle of the town, with stocks, a pillory and a whipping post whose owner was charged to &quot;ward within and about this Parish and to keep all Beggars and Vagabonds that shall lye abide or lurk about the Towne and to give correction to such...&quot;.

In 1633 construction began on York House. It was occupied by Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester in 1656 and later by Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon.

1659 saw the first mention of the Twickenham Ferry, although ferrymen had already been operating in the area for many generations. Sometime before 1743 a &quot;pirate&quot; ferry appears to have been started by Twickenham inhabitants. There is speculation that it operated to serve &quot;The Folly&quot;, a floating hostelry of some kind. Several residents wrote to the Lord Mayor of the City of London:

===18th and 19th centuries===
In 1713 the nave of the ancient St Mary&#x27;s Church collapsed, and the church was rebuilt in the Neo-classical style to designs by a local architect, John James.

In 1736, the noted pharmacist and quack doctor Joshua Ward set up the Great Vitriol Works to produce sulphuric acid, using a process discovered in the seventeenth century by Johann Glauber in which sulphur is burned together with saltpetre (potassium nitrate), in the presence of steam. The process generates an extremely unpleasant smell, which caused objections from local residents. The area was also soon home to the world&#x27;s first industrial production facility for gunpowder, on a site between Twickenham and Whitton on the banks of the River Crane. There were frequent explosions and loss of life. On 11 March 1758, one of two explosions was felt in Reading, Berkshire, and in April 1774 another explosion terrified people at church in Isleworth.

In 1772 three mills blew up, shattering glass and buildings in the neighbourhood. Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford, wrote complaining to his friend and relative Henry Seymour Conway, then Lieutenant General of the Ordnance, that all the decorative painted glass had been blown out of his windows at Strawberry Hill.

The city of Huntsville, Alabama was first settled as Twickenham in 1805. In 1811 the name was changed to its present name of Huntsville. It was named after Twickenham, the home of founder LeRoy Pope’s kinsman, Alexander Pope. The name is still used today as a neighborhood and a Historical District.

The powder mills remained in operation until 1927 when they were closed. Much of the site is now occupied by Crane Park, in which the old Shot Tower, mill sluices and blast embankments can still be seen. Much of the area along the river next to the Shot Tower is now a nature reserve.

The 1818 Enclosure Award led to the development of of land to the west of the town centre largely between the present day Staines and Hampton Roads, where new roads – Workhouse Road, Middle Road, 3rd, 2nd and 1st Common Roads (now First to Fifth Cross Roads respectively) – were laid out. During the 18th and 19th centuries, a number of fine houses were built and Twickenham became a popular place of residence for people of &quot;fashion and distinction&quot;. Further development was stimulated by the opening of Twickenham station in 1848.

In 1898 some buildings on London Road, near the east end of King Street, were demolished, and a new road was built, in order to relieve congestion on the older Church Street. This new road was named York Street and opened on 1 March 1899.

===20th and 21st centuries===

Electricity was introduced to Twickenham in 1902 and the first trams arrived the following year.

In 1939, when All Hallows Lombard Street was demolished in the City of London, its distinctive stone tower designed by Christopher Wren, with its peal of ten bells and connecting stone cloister, and the interior furnishings, including a Renatus Harris organ and a pulpit used by John Wesley, were brought to Twickenham to be incorporated in the new All Hallows Church on Chertsey Road (A316) near Twickenham Stadium.

There was a high-profile murder on 19 August 2004, when French woman Amelie Delagrange (aged 22) died in hospital after being found with a serious head injury (caused by battery) in the Twickenham Green area. Within 24 hours, police had established a link with the murder of Marsha McDonnell, who was killed in similar circumstances in nearby Hampton 18 months earlier. Levi Bellfield was found guilty of both murders on 25 February 2008 (as well as a further charge of attempted murder against 18-year-old Kate Sheedy) and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 2011 he was found guilty of the murder of Milly Dowler, a teenage girl who vanished from Walton-on-Thames in March 2002 and whose body was later found in Hampshire woodland.

==Governance==

From 1888 the area was administered jointly between the newly formed Middlesex County Council and the Twickenham Local Government District board, which had been established with the passing of the Local Government Act 1858. Under the Local Government Act 1894 the area became Twickenham Urban District. In 1926 Twickenham was granted a charter of incorporation to become a municipal borough. Eleven years later the urban district councils of Teddington, Hampton &amp; Hampton Wick merged with Twickenham.

In 1965 Middlesex County Council was abolished and replaced with the Greater London Council, and the boroughs of Twickenham, Richmond and Barnes were combined to form the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. In 1986 the Greater London Council was abolished and most powers devolved to local boroughs and others to the Government and joint boards. In 2000 the Greater London Authority was set up and two-tier administration returned, but with the top tier having a much more limited strategic role.

The borough council offices and chamber are located at York House, Twickenham and in the adjacent civic centre.

The Twickenham constituency in the UK Parliament includes the towns of Twickenham, St Margarets, Whitton, Teddington, Hampton, Fulwell, Hampton Hill and Hampton Wick. Since the 2019 UK General Election, the Member of Parliament (MP) has been a Liberal Democrat, Munira Wilson.

==Economy==

As Twickenham is a London suburb, many local residents commute to central London or work locally in retail, hospitality, education or for one of the many professional firms based in the area. London Heathrow Airport is important to the local economy both through direct employment and the cluster of international firms that have their European headquarters in the Thames Valley area. Unemployment in the area is very low, however there is a big difference in the salaries earned by residents who work inside the borough, compared to those whose employment is based outside.

The council has been making efforts to regenerate Twickenham town centre which has been struggling due to strong competition from Hounslow, Richmond and Kingston upon Thames. It differs from most town centres as it has fewer retail shops, particularly chain stores, and more cafes, restaurants, banks and estate agents. There has been a comprehensive scheme of town centre improvements including repaving in Yorkstone, a new arts centre, and improved gardens and riverside walk. However, plans to build a barge house for &quot;Gloriana&quot; at Orleans Gardens and to move the youth centre out of Heatham House so the building could be converted into a hotel proved controversial and were dropped.

==Population and housing==

Data for 1891–1961 is available for the Urban Sanitary District, that was then the Metropolitan Borough which always included Whitton. This area temporarily expanded for 31 years to include Hampton and Teddington from 1935, rising from to . The 2001 and 2011 Censuses give detailed information about the town/district. The settlement&#x27;s population in 2011 were living in 22,273 households.

In terms of ethnicity (as of 2011 census), the majority of people in all four wards identified themselves as White British, ranging between 71% of the population in Twickenham Riverside to 78% in South Twickenham. The next largest ethnic groups in all four wards were Other White, White Irish and Indian.

==Geography ==
Twickenham is bounded by the River Thames on the south and the land is relatively flat though it does rise gently to the west as it approaches Whitton. The land is fertile and was home to numerous market gardens before housing became the predominant land use with the coming on the railways in the mid nineteenth century.

The town is bordered on the south-eastern side by the River Thames and Eel Pie Island – which is connected to the Twickenham embankment by a narrow footbridge, the first of which was erected in 1957. Before this, access was by means of a hand-operated ferry that was hauled across using a chain on the riverbed. The land adjacent to the river, from Strawberry Hill in the south to Marble Hill Park in the north, is occupied by a mixture of luxury dwellings, formal gardens, public houses and a newly built park and leisure facility.

In the south, in Strawberry Hill, lies St Mary&#x27;s University, Twickenham historically specialising in sports studies, teacher training, religious studies, the humanities, drama studies and English literature. Strawberry Hill was originally a small cottage in two or three acres (8,000 or 12,000 m2) of land by the River Thames. Horace Walpole, a son of the politician Robert Walpole, rented the cottage in 1747 and subsequently bought it and turned it into one of the incunabula of the Gothic revival. The university shares part of its campus with Walpole&#x27;s Strawberry Hill. On adjacent land were the villa and garden of the poet Alexander Pope. The villa was demolished in 1808/09 following the orders of Lady Howe, who became irritated with the large number of tourists who visited the place. The grotto which formed the basement survived. A memorial plaque was placed on the site in remembrance in 1848.

A road just north of the campus is named Pope&#x27;s Grove, and a local landmark next to the main road is the &quot;Alexander Pope Hotel&quot; (previously known as &quot;Pope&#x27;s Grotto&quot;), a public house and hotel where Pope&#x27;s landmark informal garden used to be. Near this hostelry lie St Catherine&#x27;s school for girls and Radnor House School, in a building on the site of Pope&#x27;s white stucco villa and the location of Pope&#x27;s original – surviving – grotto.

There are a large number of fine houses in the area, many of them Victorian. The open space known as Radnor Gardens lies opposite Pope&#x27;s Grotto.

Not far from Pope&#x27;s Grotto is the Roman Catholic Church of Saint James, which has a memorial window in the form of the Royal Arms of Portugal and memorials to Manuel II, Portugal&#x27;s last king, who worshipped here and died in nearby Fulwell Park in 1932.

Twickenham proper begins in the vicinity of Pope&#x27;s Grotto, with generally large period houses to the west, the traditional definition of which is &quot;Twickenham Green&quot;, and similar housing in the east all the distance to Richmond Bridge typically largest near the Thames. The town centre is not actually in the centre of the town, rather in the south-eastern corner, as Twickenham was built up moving away from the Thames. Whitton lies further to the north and west.

The districts of East Twickenham and St Margarets lie to the north-east of central Twickenham on the west side of Richmond Bridge, the shortest bridge on the Tideway. These are popular for their attractive tree-lined residential roads and an eclectic range of shops and cafés. St Margarets is the location of Twickenham Studios, one of Greater London&#x27;s major film studios.

East Twickenham abuts the River Thames at Richmond Bridge and St Margarets has its river frontage immediately to the north. The great estate of Cambridge Park, home of Richard Owen Cambridge, the 18th-century satirical poet, was located here.

Richmond upon Thames College, a college of further and higher education, is on Egerton Road in Twickenham.

St Mary&#x27;s University, Twickenham has been located in Twickenham since moving from Hammersmith in 1925.

==Transport==

Until 1971 London Transport operated a bus depot known as Twickenham garage (coded AB) on Cambridge Road, East Twickenham. The relevant destination blind for garage journeys always referred to this location as Richmond Bridge, which was close by. On closure, all its routes and vehicles were transferred to Fulwell bus garage, but the building remained under the ownership of London Transport until the mid-1990s when it was demolished to make way for a housing development.

Fulwell garage was originally the base for London United Tramways in south Middlesex. The trams were replaced by trolleybuses that started operating from Fulwell garage in the 1930s. The trolleybuses were later replaced by AEC Routemaster buses and Middlesex&#x27;s last trolleybus terminated here on the night of 8 May 1962, following a commemorative circuit of the Fulwell routes by Middlesex&#x27;s first trolleybus, No.1 of the A1 class Felthams, known as &quot;Diddlers&quot;. This vehicle is preserved in working order.

Originally Twickenham railway station was situated on the western side of the A310 London Road bridge before the new station was opened on the eastern side. This accounts for roads named Railway Approach and Station Road, which now give no access to the station.

===Nearest railway stations===
The main railway station in the town is Twickenham itself, although St Margarets, Whitton, Fulwell and Strawberry Hill stations are also within the Twickenham post town. Stations in nearby towns (all, except for Richmond and Isleworth, once part of the former Borough of Twickenham) are:

*Richmond station
*Teddington railway station

==Sport==

Twickenham is home to the headquarters of the Rugby Football Union and Twickenham Stadium. The England national rugby union team play all their home matches at Twickenham Stadium, which is one of England&#x27;s largest sports stadiums and the world&#x27;s largest rugby stadium. Harlequins, a rugby union club, play at the Twickenham Stoop.

Twickenham Stadium hosted Rugby World Cup fixtures in 1991, 1999, 2015 and later including semi-final matches in 1999 and the final matches in 1991, 2015, and soon 2025.

==Arts and culture==
The Exchange is a community building, including a 320-seat theatre, opposite Twickenham railway station. It opened in October 2017. The building is owned by Richmond upon Thames Council and is managed by St Mary&#x27;s University, Twickenham.

The Twickenham Museum is a volunteer-run museum opposite St Mary&#x27;s parish church. It is open every day except Mondays.

The Cabbage Patch pub on London Road has, since 1983, been a regular venue for live music on Sunday nights, organised by TwickFolk.

==Public art==
In 2015, working in partnership with Richmond upon Thames Council and the architectural design practice Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios, Twickenham resident Graham Henderson conceived, designed, built and installed &quot;Pope&#x27;s Urn&quot;, an important contemporary piece of public art, inspired by the poetry of Alexander Pope. Enjoying a central position on the Twickenham riverside, the sculpture was commissioned to celebrate the 2015 Rugby World Cup, and was opened in a ceremony in September 2015.

<text>Upminster is a suburban town in East London, England, within the London Borough of Havering. Located east-northeast of Charing Cross, it is one of the locally important district centres identified in the London Plan. 

Historically a rural village, it formed an ancient parish in the Chafford hundred of the county of Essex. The economic history of Upminster is characterised by a shift from farming to brick making to garden suburb. It is currently mainly commercial shopping, small businesses and residential.

It was first connected to central London by rail in 1885 and has a terminal station on the London Underground network. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Upminster significantly expanded and increased in population, becoming part of Hornchurch Urban District in 1934, and has formed part of Greater London since 1965.

==History==
===Toponymy===

The placename Upminster is first recorded in 1062 as &quot;Upmynstre&quot; and is recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book as &quot;Upmunstra&quot;. It is formed from Old English &quot;upp&quot; and &quot;mynster&quot;, meaning &#x27;the large church on high ground&#x27;. The high ground of St Laurence&#x27;s parish church being in relation to the valley of the River Ingrebourne and the Upminster Bridge over the river shares the name. An alternative explanation suggests the &quot;upp&quot; could refer to the geographical relationship to a church at Barking or Tilbury in Anglo-Saxon times.

===Economic development===
There was a Roman farmstead in the Upminster area from the 1st century to the 3rd century, and agriculture was the predominant industry throughout the following centuries.

The area was once wooded, but clearances in the 12th century gave more land over to arable farming; and by the 17th century there were a variety of crops and livestock. There was a growth in market gardening in the 19th century. There have been a number of windmills in Upminster and one of which, a smock mill built in 1803, remains. Local industry included a tannery, gravel extraction and a brick works that was connected to the railway station by a tramway in 1895.

The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway from Fenchurch Street was extended from Barking to Upminster in 1885. The underground Whitechapel and Bow Railway opened in 1902 and allowed through services of the District Railway to operate to Upminster. The District converted to electric trains in 1905 and services were cut back to East Ham. Delayed by World War I, electrified tracks were extended by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway to Upminster and through services resumed in 1932.

===Local government===

Upminster formed an ancient parish of in the Chafford hundred of Essex. The parish vestry had meetings in the church until 1798, when they moved to the Bell Inn. The parish was divided into North and South wards by the Hornchurch to Cranham road. In 1836 the vestry lost control of poor relief, with Upminster becoming part of the Romford Poor Law Union and in 1875 the parish became part of Romford rural sanitary district. Following the Local Government Act 1894, the sanitary district became Romford Rural District and a parish council was formed of nine members, increasing to twelve by 1913 as the population had doubled. The parish council acquired the Clock House building on St Mary&#x27;s Lane for use as offices in 1924. The parish formed part of the London Traffic Area from 1924 and the London Passenger Transport Area from 1933. In 1934 the parish council was abolished and Upminster was combined with other parishes to form part of Hornchurch Urban District. In 1965 the urban district was abolished and its former area was combined with that of Municipal Borough of Romford; and since then has formed part of the London Borough of Havering in Greater London. For elections to the Greater London Council, Upminster was part of the Havering electoral division until 1973 and then the Upminster electoral division until 1986.

===Urban development===
The parish had three early centres of activity; the village around the church and the settlements of Hacton and Corbets Tey. The estates of Gaynes, New Place and Upminster Hall were purchased during the 17th century by merchants in the City of London. This caused a significant number of buildings in the town to be constructed or improved. Upkeep of the three bridges crossing the Ingrebourne were the responsibility of Upminster, as the adjacent Hornchurch parish was in the Havering liberty and was exempt from responsibility because of its charter. Although the opening of the station was key to the development of the suburb, land was not purchased for development until were secured in 1901.

Electricity was introduced in Upminster in 1926. Gas main supply came from Romford in 1872 and from 1905 there was gas street lighting. The area was served by good spring water, with mains supply provided by the South Essex Waterworks Company from 1836. Works on the sewerage system began in 1899 in Upminster village and Corbets Tey. In 1922 sewage works for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. Land for Upminster Park was purchased by the parish council in 1929.

==Governance==

The town forms part of the Hornchurch and Upminster UK Parliament constituency, and is covered by the Havering wards of Upminster and Cranham. The current MP is Julia Lopez. Each ward elects three councillors to Havering London Borough Council. All six councillors elected in 2010 for the two wards were the Upminster and Cranham Residents&#x27; Association candidates and the area is unusual in that the residents&#x27; association is strongly active. From 1945 to 1974 Upminster formed part of the Hornchurch constituency and from 1974 to 2010 it formed part of the Upminster constituency. Upminster is within the Havering and Redbridge London Assembly constituency.

It is bounded in the west by the River Ingrebourne and there is a stream running east–west, just north of Corbets Tey that has been dammed to form a lake. It has formed part of the continuously built-up area of London since the 1930s and is contiguous with Cranham to the east and Hornchurch to the west. To the north and south there is open land that forms part of the Metropolitan Green Belt and there are open spaces formed by Upminster Golf Club and Upminster Hall Playing Field to the north, Upminster Park and Clock House Gardens to the south, and the Ingrebourne Valley linear park to the south west.

In 2001 the population of Upminster ward was 12,674 and Cranham ward was 12,242, giving a total population of 25,098. 80.95% in Upminster and 81.73% in Cranham report their religion as Christian, compared to 76.13% for Havering, 58.23% in London and 71.74% in England. 10.08% in Upminster and 10.46% in Cranham report having no religion, compared to 13.18% in Havering, 15.76% in London and 14.59% in England. With a black and minority ethnic population of 3% in 2001, Cranham and Upminster wards have the lowest Simpson index for ethnic diversity in London. The level of home ownership is atypically high compared to the rest of London and England, with over 90% of housing tenure under owner-occupation in both wards. The Upminster ward has one of the lowest levels of deprivation in London.

The 2011 census showed that the population was 96% white (92% British, 2% Other, 2% Irish). Indian, Chinese and Black African were 1% each. 75% of the population is Christian, the highest recorded in London.

Havering Council&#x27;s urban strategy recognises that nearby Hornchurch is the main cultural hub of the borough with a large theatre and arts spaces, and Romford offers the largest regional concentration of entertainment facilities. Within Upminster is New Windmill Hall, a flexible entertainment space, built in 1968, which holds up to 300 people. Upminster forms part of the tourism strategy for the borough. It is the location of Upminster Windmill, one of the few remaining mills in Greater London and is Grade II* listed. There is also the Tithe Barn Museum, containing artifacts of domestic and agricultural use. In the west of Upminster is Hornchurch Stadium, which is the home ground of A.F.C. Hornchurch. Upminster is often associated with Ian Dury and his 1981 album &quot;Lord Upminster&quot; is named after the town.

===Speed of sound===
The speed of sound was first accurately calculated by the Reverend William Derham, Rector of Upminster, thus improving on Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s estimates. Derham used a telescope from the tower of the church of St Laurence, Upminster to observe the flash of a distant shotgun being fired, and then measured the time until he heard the gunshot with a half-second pendulum. Measurements were made of gunshots from a number of local landmarks, including the Church of St Mary Magdalene, North Ockendon. The distance was known by triangulation, and thus the speed that the sound had travelled could be calculated.

<doc id="94339" wikidata="Q310939" url="?curid=94339" title="William Walton">
<text>Sir William Turner Walton (29 March 19028 March 1983) was an English composer. During a sixty-year career, he wrote music in several classical genres and styles, from film scores to opera. His best-known works include &quot;Façade&quot;, the cantata &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;, the Viola Concerto, the First Symphony, and the British coronation marches &quot;Crown Imperial&quot; and &quot;Orb and Sceptre&quot;.

Born in Oldham, Lancashire, the son of a musician, Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, &quot;Façade&quot;, which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score.

In middle age, Walton left England and set up home with his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he had ceased to be regarded as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics at the time of their premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works.

Walton was a slow worker, painstakingly perfectionist, and his complete body of work across his long career is not large. His most popular compositions continue to be frequently performed in the 21st century, and by 2010 almost all his works had been released on CD.

==Biography==
===Early years===

Walton was born into a musical family in Oldham, Lancashire, the second son in a family of three boys and a girl. His father, Charles Alexander Walton, was a musician who had trained at the Royal Manchester College of Music under Charles Hallé, and made a living as a singing teacher and church organist. Charles&#x27;s wife, Louisa Maria (&quot;née&quot; Turner), had been a singer before their marriage. William Walton&#x27;s musical talents were spotted when he was still a young boy, and he took piano and violin lessons, though he never mastered either instrument. He was more successful as a singer: he and his elder brother sang in their father&#x27;s choir, taking part in performances of large-scale works by Handel, Haydn, Mendelssohn and others.

Walton was sent to a local school, but in 1912 his father saw a newspaper advertisement for probationer choristers at Christ Church Cathedral School in Oxford and applied for William to be admitted. The boy and his mother missed their intended train from Manchester to Oxford because Walton&#x27;s father had spent the money for the fare in a local public house. Louisa Walton had to borrow the fares from a greengrocer. Although they arrived in Oxford after the entrance trials were over, Mrs Walton successfully pleaded for her son to be heard, and he was accepted.

He remained at the choir school for the next six years. The Dean of Christ Church, Dr Thomas Strong, noted the young Walton&#x27;s musical potential and was encouraged in this view by Sir Hubert Parry, who saw the manuscripts of some of Walton&#x27;s early compositions and said to Strong, &quot;There&#x27;s a lot in this chap; you must keep your eye on him.&quot;

At the age of sixteen Walton became an undergraduate of Christ Church. It is sometimes said that he was Oxford&#x27;s youngest undergraduate since Henry VIII, and though this is probably not correct, he was nonetheless among the youngest. He came under the influence of Hugh Allen, the dominant figure in Oxford&#x27;s musical life. Allen introduced Walton to modern music, including Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Petrushka&quot;, and enthused him with &quot;the mysteries of the orchestra&quot;. Walton spent much time in the university library, studying scores by Stravinsky, Debussy, Sibelius, Roussel and others. He neglected his non-musical studies, and though he passed the musical examinations with ease, he failed the Greek and algebra examinations required for graduation.

Little survives from Walton&#x27;s juvenilia, but the choral anthem &quot;A Litany&quot;, written when he was fifteen, anticipates his mature style.
At Oxford Walton befriended several poets including Roy Campbell, Siegfried Sassoon and, most importantly for his future, Sacheverell Sitwell. Walton was sent down from Oxford in 1920 without a degree or any firm plans. Sitwell invited him to lodge in London with him and his literary brother and sister, Osbert and Edith. Walton took up residence in the attic of their house in Chelsea, later recalling, &quot;I went for a few weeks and stayed about fifteen years&quot;.

===First successes===
The Sitwells looked after their protégé both materially and culturally, giving him not only a home but a stimulating cultural education. He took music lessons with Ernest Ansermet, Ferruccio Busoni and Edward J. Dent. He attended the Russian ballet, met Stravinsky and Gershwin, heard the Savoy Orpheans at the Savoy Hotel and wrote an experimental string quartet heavily influenced by the Second Viennese School that was performed at a festival of new music at Salzburg in 1923. Alban Berg heard the performance and was impressed enough to take Walton to meet Arnold Schoenberg, Berg&#x27;s teacher and the founder of the Second Viennese School.

In 1923, in collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Walton had his first great success, though at first it was a &quot;succès de scandale&quot;. &quot;Façade&quot; was first performed in public at the Aeolian Hall, London, on 12 June. The work consisted of Edith&#x27;s verses, which she recited through a megaphone from behind a screen, while Walton conducted an ensemble of six players in his accompanying music. The press was generally condemnatory. Walton&#x27;s biographer Michael Kennedy cites as typical a contemporary headline: &quot;Drivel That They Paid to Hear&quot;. &quot;The Daily Express&quot; loathed the work, but admitted that it was naggingly memorable. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; wrote of &quot;relentless cacophony&quot;. &quot;The Observer&quot; condemned the verses and dismissed Walton&#x27;s music as &quot;harmless&quot;. In &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, Dent was much more appreciative: &quot;The audience was at first inclined to treat the whole thing as an absurd joke, but there is always a surprisingly serious element in Miss Sitwell&#x27;s poetry and Mr Walton&#x27;s music ... which soon induced the audience to listen with breathless attention.&quot; In &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Ernest Newman said of Walton, &quot;as a musical joker he is a jewel of the first water ... Here is obviously a humorous musical talent of the first order.

Among the audience were Evelyn Waugh, Lytton Strachey, Virginia Woolf and Noël Coward. The last was so outraged by the avant-garde nature of Sitwell&#x27;s verses and the staging, that he marched out ostentatiously during the performance. The players did not like the music: the clarinettist, Charles Draper asked the composer, &quot;Mr Walton, has a clarinet player ever done you an injury?&quot; Nevertheless, the work soon became accepted, and within a decade Walton&#x27;s music was used for the popular &quot;Façade&quot; ballet, choreographed by Frederick Ashton.
Walton&#x27;s works of the 1920s, while he was living in the Sitwells&#x27; attic, include the overture &quot;Portsmouth Point&quot;, dedicated to Sassoon and inspired by the well-known painting of the same name by Thomas Rowlandson. It was first heard as an entr&#x27;acte at a performance in Diaghilev&#x27;s 1926 ballet season, where &quot;The Times&quot; complained, &quot;It is a little difficult to make much of new music when it is heard through the hum of conversation.&quot; Sir Henry Wood programmed the work at the Proms the following year, where it made more of an impression. The composer conducted this performance; he did not enjoy conducting, but he had firm views on how his works should be interpreted, and orchestral players appreciated his &quot;easy nonchalance&quot; and &quot;complete absence of fuss.&quot; Walton&#x27;s other works of the 1920s included a short orchestral piece, &quot;Siesta&quot; (1926) and a Sinfonia Concertante for piano and orchestra (1928), which was well-received at its premiere at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert, but has not entered the regular repertory.

The Viola Concerto (1929) brought Walton to the forefront of British classical music. It was written at the suggestion of Sir Thomas Beecham for the viola virtuoso Lionel Tertis. When Tertis received the manuscript, he rejected it immediately. The composer and violist Paul Hindemith stepped into the breach and gave the first performance. The work was greeted with enthusiasm. In &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, Eric Blom wrote, &quot;This young composer is a born genius&quot; and said that it was tempting to call the concerto the best thing in recent music of any nationality. Tertis soon changed his mind and took the work up. A performance by him at a Three Choirs Festival concert in Worcester in 1932 was the only occasion on which Walton met Elgar, whom he greatly admired. Elgar did not share the general enthusiasm for Walton&#x27;s concerto.

Walton&#x27;s next major composition was the massive choral cantata &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot; (1931). It began as a work on a modest scale; the BBC commissioned a piece for a small chorus, orchestra of no more than fifteen players, and soloist. Osbert Sitwell constructed a text, selecting verses from several books of the Old Testament and the Book of Revelation. As Walton worked on it, he found that his music required far larger forces than the BBC proposed to allow, and Beecham rescued him by programming the work for the 1931 Leeds Festival, to be conducted by Malcolm Sargent. Walton later recalled Beecham as saying, &quot;As you&#x27;ll never hear the work again, my boy, why not throw in a couple of brass bands?&quot; During early rehearsals, the Leeds chorus members found Walton&#x27;s music difficult to master, and it was falsely rumoured in London musical circles that Beecham had been obliged to send Sargent to Leeds to quell a revolt. The first performance was a triumph for the composer, conductor and performers. A contemporary critic wrote, &quot;Those who experienced the tremendous impact of its first performance had full justification for feeling that a great composer had arisen in our land, a composer to whose potentialities it was impossible to set any limits.&quot; The work has remained a staple of the choral repertoire.

===1930s===
In the 1930s, Walton&#x27;s relationship with the Sitwells became less close. He had love affairs and new friendships that drew him out of their orbit. His first long affair was with Imma von Doernberg, the young widow of a German baron. She and Walton met in the late 1920s and they were together until 1934, when she left him. 

Walton&#x27;s later affair with Alice, Viscountess Wimborne (born 1880), which lasted from 1934 until her death in April 1948, caused a wider breach between Walton and the Sitwells, as she disliked them as much as they disliked her. By the 1930s, Walton was earning enough from composing to allow him financial independence for the first time. A legacy from a musical benefactress in 1931 further enhanced his finances, and in 1934 he left the Sitwells&#x27; house and bought a house in Belgravia.

Walton&#x27;s first major composition after &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot; was his First Symphony. It was not written to a commission, and Walton worked slowly on the score from late 1931 until he completed it in 1935. He had composed the first three of the four movements by the end of 1933 and promised the premiere to the conductor Hamilton Harty. Walton then found himself unable to complete the work. The end of his affair with Imma von Doernberg coincided with, and may have contributed to, a sudden and persistent writer&#x27;s block. Harty persuaded Walton to let him perform the three existing movements, which he premiered in December 1934 with the London Symphony Orchestra. During 1934 Walton interrupted work on the symphony to compose his first film music, for Paul Czinner&#x27;s &quot;Escape Me Never&quot; (1934), for which he was paid £300.

After a break of eight months, Walton resumed work on the symphony and completed it in 1935. Harty and the BBC Symphony Orchestra gave the premiere of the completed piece in November of that year. The symphony aroused international interest. The leading continental conductors Wilhelm Furtwängler and Willem Mengelberg sent for copies of the score, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra premiered the work in the US under Harty, Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra gave the New York premiere, and the young George Szell conducted the symphony in Australia.
Elgar having died in 1934, the authorities turned to Walton to compose a march in the Elgarian tradition for the coronation of George VI in 1937. His &quot;Crown Imperial&quot; was an immediate success with the public, but disappointed those of Walton&#x27;s admirers who thought of him as an avant-garde composer. Among Walton&#x27;s other works from this decade are more film scores, including the first of his incidental music for Shakespeare adaptations, &quot;As You Like It&quot; (1936); a short ballet for a West End revue (1936); and a choral piece, &quot;In Honour of the City of London&quot; (1937). His most important work of the 1930s, alongside the symphony, was the Violin Concerto (1939), commissioned by Jascha Heifetz. The concerto, Walton later revealed, expressed his love for Alice Wimborne. Its strong romantic style caused some critics to label it retrogressive, and Walton said in a newspaper interview, &quot;Today&#x27;s white hope is tomorrow&#x27;s black sheep. These days it is very sad for a composer to grow old ... I seriously advise all sensitive composers to die at the age of 37. I know: I&#x27;ve gone through the first halcyon period and am just about ripe for my critical damnation.&quot;

In the late 1930s Walton became aware of a younger English composer whose fame was shortly to overtake his, Benjamin Britten. After their first meeting, Britten wrote in his diary, &quot;[...] to lunch with William Walton at Sloane Square. He is charming, but I feel always the school relationship with him – he is so obviously the head prefect of English music, whereas I&#x27;m the promising new boy.&quot; They remained on friendly terms for the rest of Britten&#x27;s life; Walton admired many of Britten&#x27;s works, and considered him a genius; Britten did not admire all of Walton&#x27;s works but was grateful for his support at difficult times in his life.

===Second World War===

During the Second World War Walton was exempted from military service on the understanding that he would compose music for wartime propaganda films. In addition to driving ambulances (extremely badly, he said), he was attached to the Army Film Unit as music adviser. He wrote scores for six films during the war – some that he thought &quot;rather boring&quot; and some that have become classics such as &quot;The First of the Few&quot; (1942) and Laurence Olivier&#x27;s adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; (1944).

Walton was at first dismissive of his film scores, regarding them as professional but of no intrinsic worth; he resisted attempts to arrange them into concert suites, saying, &quot;Film music is not good film music if it can be used for any other purpose.&quot; He later relented to the extent of allowing concert suites to be arranged from &quot;The First of the Few&quot; and the Olivier Shakespeare films. For the BBC, Walton composed the music for a large-scale radio drama, &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot;, written by Louis MacNeice and starring Olivier. As with his film music, the composer was inclined to dismiss the musical importance of his work on the programme.

Apart from these commissions, Walton&#x27;s wartime works of any magnitude comprised incidental music for John Gielgud&#x27;s 1942 production of &quot;Macbeth&quot;; two scores for the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet, &quot;The Wise Virgins&quot;, based on the music of J. S. Bach transcribed by Walton, and &quot;The Quest&quot;, with a plot loosely based on Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;; and, for the concert hall, a suite of orchestral miniatures, &quot;Music for Children&quot;, and a comedy overture, &quot;Scapino&quot;, composed for the fiftieth anniversary of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

Walton&#x27;s house in London was destroyed by German bombing in May 1941, after which he spent much of his time at Alice Wimborne&#x27;s family house at Ashby St Ledgers in the countryside of Northamptonshire in the middle of England. While there, Walton worked on projects that had been in his mind for some time. In 1939 he had been planning a substantial chamber work, a string quartet, but he set it aside while composing his wartime film scores. In early 1945 he turned again to the quartet. Walton was conscious that Britten, with &quot;Les Illuminations&quot; (1940), the &quot;Sinfonia da Requiem&quot; (1942), and &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; in 1945, had produced a series of substantial works, while Walton had produced no major composition since the Violin Concerto in 1939. Among English critics and audiences, the Violin Concerto was not at first rated one of Walton&#x27;s finest works. Because Heifetz had bought the exclusive rights to play the concerto for two years, it was not heard in Britain until 1941. The London premiere, with a less famous soloist, and in the unflattering acoustics of the Royal Albert Hall, did not immediately reveal the work as a masterpiece. The String Quartet in A minor, premiered in May 1947, was Walton&#x27;s most substantial work of the 1940s. Kennedy calls it one of his finest achievements and &quot;a sure sign that he had thrown off the trammels of his cinema style and rediscovered his true voice.&quot;

===Postwar===
In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society&#x27;s Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot;, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton&#x27;s mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.

Walton&#x27;s last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier&#x27;s film of &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton&#x27;s relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of &quot;Façade&quot;, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, &quot;Orb and Sceptre&quot;; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the &quot;Te Deum&quot; for the occasion.

&quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954. Its preparation was dogged by misfortunes. Olivier, originally scheduled to direct it, backed out, as did Henry Moore who had agreed to design the production; Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, for whom the role of Cressida had been written, refused to perform it; her replacement, Magda László, had difficulty mastering the English words; and Sargent, the conductor, &quot;did not seem well acquainted with the score&quot;. The premiere had a friendly reception, but there was a general feeling that Hassall and Walton had written an old-fashioned opera in an outmoded tradition. The piece was subsequently staged in San Francisco, New York and Milan during the next year, but failed to make a positive impression, and did not enter the regular operatic repertory.
In 1956 Walton sold his London house and took up full-time residence on Ischia. He built a hilltop house at Forio and called it La Mortella. Susana Walton created a magnificent garden there. Walton&#x27;s other works of the 1950s include the music for a fourth Shakespeare film, Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;, and the Cello Concerto (1956), written for Gregor Piatigorsky, who gave the premiere in January 1957 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the conductor Charles Munch. Some critics felt that the concerto was old-fashioned; Peter Heyworth wrote that there was little in the work that would have startled an audience in the year the met its iceberg (1912). It has nevertheless entered the regular repertoire, performed by Paul Tortelier, Yo-Yo Ma, Lynn Harrell and Pierre Fournier among others.
In 1966 Walton successfully underwent surgery for lung cancer. Until then he had been an inveterate pipe-smoker, but after the operation he never smoked again. While he was convalescing, he worked on a one-act comic opera, &quot;The Bear&quot;, which was premiered at Britten&#x27;s Aldeburgh Festival, in June 1966, and enthusiastically received. Walton had become so used to being written off by music critics that he felt &quot;there must be something wrong when the worms turned on some praise.&quot; Walton received the Order of Merit in 1967, the fourth composer to be so honoured, after Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Britten.

Walton&#x27;s orchestral works of the 1960s include his Second Symphony (1960), &quot;Variations on a Theme by Hindemith&quot; (1963), &quot;Capriccio burlesco&quot; (1968), and &quot;Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten&quot; (1969). His song cycles from this period were composed for Peter Pears (&quot;Anon in Love&quot;, 1960) and Schwarzkopf (&quot;A Song for the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Table&quot;, 1962). He was commissioned to compose a score for the 1969 film &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;, but the film company rejected most of his score, replacing it with music by Ron Goodwin. A concert suite of Walton&#x27;s score was published and recorded after Walton&#x27;s death. After his experience over &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;, Walton declared that he would write no more film music, but he was persuaded by Olivier to compose the score for a film of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot; in 1969.

===Last years===
Walton was never a facile or quick composer, and in his final decade, he found composition increasingly difficult. He repeatedly tried to compose a third symphony for André Previn, but eventually abandoned it. Many of his final works are re-orchestrations or revisions of earlier music. He orchestrated his song cycle &quot;Anon in Love&quot; (originally for tenor and guitar), and at the request of Neville Marriner adapted his String Quartet in A minor as a Sonata for String Orchestra. One original work from this period was his &quot;Jubilate Deo&quot;, premiered as one of several events to celebrate his seventieth birthday. The British prime minister, Edward Heath, gave a birthday dinner for Walton at 10 Downing Street, attended by royalty and Walton&#x27;s most eminent colleagues; Britten presented a Walton evening at Aldeburgh and Previn conducted an all-Walton concert at the Royal Festival Hall.

Walton revised the score of &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, and the opera was staged at Covent Garden in 1976. Once again it was plagued by misfortune while in preparation. Walton was in poor health; Previn, who was to conduct, also fell ill; and the tenor chosen for Troilus pulled out. As in 1954, the critics were generally tepid. Some of Walton&#x27;s final artistic endeavours were in collaboration with the film-maker Tony Palmer. Walton took part in Palmer&#x27;s profile of him, &quot;At the Haunted End of the Day&quot;, in 1981, and in 1982 Walton and his wife played the cameo roles of King Frederick Augustus and Queen Maria of Saxony in Palmer&#x27;s nine-hour film &quot;Wagner&quot;. In March 1982 there were concerts marking Walton&#x27;s eightieth birthday, at the Barbican and Royal Festival halls. The audience&#x27;s response to the performance of &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;, at the latter, conducted by Previn, moved the composer to tears.

Walton died at La Mortella on 8 March 1983, at the age of 80. His ashes were buried on Ischia, and a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey, where a commemorative stone to Walton was unveiled near those to Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Britten.

==Music==

Walton was a slow worker. Both during composition and afterwards he would continually revise his music; he said, &quot;Without an india-rubber I was absolutely sunk.&quot; Consequently, his total body of work from his sixty-year career as a composer is not large. Between the first performance of &quot;Façade&quot; in 1923, for example, and that of the Sinfonia Concertante in 1928, he averaged only one small piece a year. Of his work as a whole, Byron Adams in &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; writes:

The writer adds that Walton&#x27;s allegiance to his basic style never wavered and that this loyalty to his own vision, together with his rhythmic vitality, sensuous melancholy, sly charm and orchestral flair, gives Walton&#x27;s finest music &quot;an imperishable glamour&quot;. Another biographer of Walton, Neil Tierney, writes that although contemporary critics felt that the post-war music did not match Walton&#x27;s pre-war compositions, it has become clear that the later works are &quot;if emotionally less direct, more profound.&quot;

===Orchestral music===

====Overtures and short orchestral pieces====
Walton&#x27;s first work for full orchestra, &quot;Portsmouth Point&quot; (1925), inspired by a Rowlandson print of the same name, depicts a rumbustious dockside scene (in Kennedy&#x27;s phrase, &quot;the sailors of H.M.S. Pinafore have had a night on the tiles&quot;) in a fast moving score full of syncopation and cross-rhythm that for years proved hazardous for conductors and orchestras alike. Throughout his career, Walton wrote works in this pattern, such as the lively Comedy Overture &quot;Scapino&quot;, a virtuoso piece commissioned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, described by &quot;The Musical Times&quot; as &quot;an ingenious blending of fragments in exhilarating profusion.&quot; Walton&#x27;s post-war works in this genre are the &quot;Johannesburg Festival Overture&quot; (1956), the &quot;diverting but hard-edged &quot;Capriccio burlesco&quot;&quot; (1968), and the longer &quot;Partita&quot; (1957), written for the Cleveland Orchestra, described by &quot;Grove&quot; as &quot;an impressively concentrated score with a high-spirited finale [with] steely counterpoint and orchestral virtuosity&quot;. Walton&#x27;s shorter pieces also include two tributes to musical colleagues, &quot;Variations on a Theme by Hindemith&quot; (1963) and the &quot;Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten&quot; (1969), in both of which the source material is gradually transformed as Walton&#x27;s own voice becomes more prominent. The critic Hugh Ottaway commented that in both pieces &quot;the interaction of two musical personalities is... fascinating&quot;.

====Concertos and symphonies====
Walton&#x27;s first successful large-scale concert work, the Viola Concerto (1929) is in marked contrast to the raucous &quot;Portsmouth Point&quot;; despite the common influence of jazz and of the music of Hindemith and Ravel, in its structure and romantic longing it owes much to the Elgar Cello Concerto. In this work, wrote Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor in &quot;The Record Guide&quot;, &quot;the lyric poet in Walton, who had so far been hidden under a mask of irony, fully emerged.&quot; Walton followed this pattern in his two subsequent concertos, for Violin (1937) and for Cello (1956). Each opens reflectively, is in three movements, and contrasts agitated and jagged passages with warmer romantic sections. The Cello Concerto is more introspective than the two earlier concertos, with a ticking rhythm throughout the work suggesting the inexorable passage of time.

The two symphonies are strongly contrasted with one another. The First is on a large scale, reminiscent at times of Sibelius. Grove says of the work that its &quot;orgiastic power, coruscating malice, sensuous desolation and extroverted swagger&quot; make the symphony a tribute to Walton&#x27;s tenacity and inventive facility. Critics have always differed on whether the finale lives up to the rest of the work. In comparison with the First, the Second Symphony struck many reviewers as lightweight, and, as with many of Walton&#x27;s works of the 1950s, it was regarded as old-fashioned. It is a very different kind of work from the First Symphony. David Cox describes it as &quot;more a &quot;divertimento&quot; than a symphony ... highly personal, unmistakably Walton throughout&quot;, and Kennedy calls it &quot;somewhat enigmatic in mood, and a superb example of Walton&#x27;s more mature, concise, and mellow post-1945 style.&quot;

====Music for ballets, plays and films====
Although generally a slow and perfectionist composer, Walton was capable of working quickly when necessary. Some of his stage and screen music was written to tight deadlines. He regarded his ballet and incidental music as of less importance than his concert works and was generally dismissive of what he produced.

Of his ballets for Sadler&#x27;s Wells, &quot;The Wise Virgins&quot; (1940) is an arrangement of eight extracts from choral and instrumental music by Bach. &quot;The Quest&quot; (1943), written in great haste, is, according to Grove, oddly reminiscent of Vaughan Williams. Neither of these works established itself in the regular repertoire, unlike the ballet score Walton arranged from the music of &quot;Façade&quot;, the music for which was expanded for full orchestra, still retaining the jazz influences and the iconoclastic wit of the original. Music from &quot;The Quest&quot; and the whole of the Viola Concerto were used for another Sadler&#x27;s Wells ballet, &quot;O.W.&quot;, in 1972.

Walton wrote little incidental music for the theatre, his music for &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1942) being one of his most notable contributions to the genre.

Between 1934 and 1969 he wrote the music for 13 films. He arranged the &quot;Spitfire Prelude and Fugue&quot; from his own score for &quot;The First of the Few&quot; (1942). He allowed suites to be arranged from his Shakespeare film scores of the 1940s and 1950s; in these films, he mixed Elizabethan pastiche with wholly characteristic Waltonian music. Kennedy singles out for praise the Agincourt battle sequence in &quot;Henry V&quot;, where the music makes the charge of the French knights &quot;fearsomely real.&quot; Despite Walton&#x27;s view that film music is ineffective when performed out of context, suites from several more of his filmscores have been assembled since his death.

===Opera===

Walton worked for many years on his only full-length opera, &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, both before its premiere and afterwards. It has never been regarded as a success. The libretto is generally considered weak, and Walton&#x27;s music, despite many passages that have won critical praise, is not dramatic enough to sustain interest. Grove calls the work a partially successful attempt to revivify the traditions of nineteenth-century Italian opera in a post-war era wary of heroic Romanticism.

Walton&#x27;s only other opera, &quot;The Bear&quot;, based on a comic vaudeville by Chekhov, was much better received. The critic Andrew Porter described it in &quot;The Musical Times&quot; as &quot;one of the strongest and most brilliant things Walton has written&quot;. It is, however, a one-act piece, a genre not regularly staged at most opera houses, and so is infrequently seen. Operabase recorded four productions of the piece worldwide between 2013 and 2015.

===Chamber and solo works===
Apart from an early experiment in atonalism in his String Quartet (1919–22), which he later described as &quot;full of undigested Bartók and Schoenberg&quot;, Walton&#x27;s major essays in chamber music are his String Quartet in A Minor (1945–46) and the Sonata for Violin and Piano (1947–49). In the opinion of Adams in &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, the quartet is one of Walton&#x27;s supreme achievements. Earlier critics did not always share this view. In 1956 &quot;The Record Guide&quot; said, &quot;[T]he material is not first class and the composition as a whole seems laboured.&quot;

The String Quartet in A Minor exists also in its later expanded form as the Sonata for String Orchestra (1971), which, the critic Trevor Harvey wrote, combines Walton in his most energetically rhythmic mood with a &quot;vein of lyrical tenderness which is equally characteristic and is so rewarding to listen to&quot;. Malcolm Arnold undertook some of the transcription involved in this expansion of forces. The work was premiered by Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields in March 1972 at the Perth Festival in Australia; the same performers gave the British premiere in Bath later that month.

The Violin Sonata is in two closely related movements, with strong thematic material in common. The first movement is nostalgically lyrical, the second a set of variations, each one a semitone higher than its predecessor. Walton briefly refers back to Schoenberg with a dodecaphonic passage in the second movement, but otherwise the sonata is firmly tonal.

The &quot;Five Bagatelles for Guitar&quot; were written for, and edited by, the guitarist Julian Bream and dedicated to Arnold. Kennedy describes them as &quot;among Walton&#x27;s most piquant and delightful miniatures. He exploits the guitar&#x27;s resources to the full and the music always sounds Waltonian&quot;.

===Choral and other vocal music===

Walton&#x27;s liturgical compositions include the &quot;Coronation Te Deum&quot; (1952), &quot;Missa brevis&quot; (1966), &quot;Jubilate Deo&quot; (1972), and &quot;Magnificat&quot; and &quot;Nunc dimittis&quot; (1974), and the anthems &quot;A Litany&quot; (1916) and &quot;Set me as a seal upon thy heart&quot; (1938).
One of the best-known and most frequently performed of Walton&#x27;s works is the cantata &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;. Written for large orchestra, chorus and baritone soloist, it intersperses a choral and orchestral depiction of Babylonian excess and depravity, barbaric jazzy outbursts, and the lamentations and finally the rejoicing of the Jewish captives. The &quot;couple of brass bands&quot; added at Beecham&#x27;s suggestion to an already large orchestra each consist of three trumpets, three trombones and a tuba. Many critics judged it the most important English choral work since Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; in 1900. None of Walton&#x27;s later choral works have matched its popularity. They include &quot;In Honour of the City of London&quot; (1937) and a &quot;Gloria&quot; (1960–61) composed for the 125th anniversary of the Huddersfield Choral Society.

===Recordings===

From the days of 78 rpm discs, when relatively little modern music was being put on record, Walton was favoured by the record companies. In 1929 the small, new Decca company recorded eleven movements from &quot;Façade&quot;, with the composer conducting a chamber ensemble, with the speakers Edith Sitwell and Walton&#x27;s friend and colleague Constant Lambert. In the 1930s, Walton also had two of his major orchestral works on disc, both on Decca, the First Symphony recorded by Harty and the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Viola Concerto with Frederick Riddle and the LSO conducted by the composer. In the 1940s Walton moved from Decca to its older, larger rival, EMI. The EMI producer Walter Legge arranged a series of recordings of Walton&#x27;s major works and many minor ones over the next twenty years; a rival composer expressed the view that if Walton had an attack of flatulence (he used an earthier expression), Walter Legge would record it.

Walton himself, although a reluctant conductor, conducted many of the EMI recordings, and some for other labels. He made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, the Violin Concerto, the Sinfonia Concertante, the &quot;Façade&quot; Suites, the Partita, &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;, and suites from his film scores for Shakespeare plays and &quot;The First of the Few&quot;. Some live performances conducted by Walton were recorded and have been released on compact disc, including the Cello Concerto and the Coronation Te Deum.

Almost all Walton&#x27;s works have been recorded for commercial release. EMI published a &quot;Walton Edition&quot; of his major works on CD in the 1990s, and the recording of the Chandos Records &quot;Walton Edition&quot; of his works was completed in 2010. His best-known works have been recorded by performers from many countries. Among the frequently recorded are &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;, the Viola and Violin Concertos and the First Symphony, which has had some thirty recordings since Harty&#x27;s 1936 set.

==Legacy==
In 1944, it was said of Walton that he summed up the recent past of English music and augured its future. Later writers have concluded that Walton had little influence on the next generation of composers. In his later years, Walton formed friendships with younger composers including Hans Werner Henze and Malcolm Arnold, but although he admired their work, he did not influence their compositional styles. Throughout his life, Walton held no posts at music conservatoires; he had no pupils, gave no lectures and wrote no essays. After his death, the Walton Trust, inspired by Susana Walton, has run arts education projects, promoted British music and held annual summer masterclasses on Ischia for gifted young musicians.

<text>Boulder is the home rule city that is the seat of Boulder County, Colorado, United States. With a population of 108,250 at the 2020 census, it is the most populous city in the county and the 12th-most populous city in Colorado. Boulder is the principal city of the Boulder, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had 330,758 residents in 2020 and is part of the Front Range Urban Corridor.

Boulder is located at the base of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, at an elevation of above sea level. The city is northwest of the Colorado state capital of Denver. Boulder is a college town, hosting the University of Colorado Boulder, the flagship and largest campus of the University of Colorado system as well as numerous research institutes.

==History==

Archaeological evidence shows that Boulder Valley has been continuously inhabited by Native American tribes for over 13,000 years, beginning in the late Pleistocene era. Throughout the Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods, Indigenous peoples moved seasonally between the mountains and plains, taking shelter in winter along the Front Range trough where Boulder now lies. By the 1500s, the area was occupied by Ute tribes, joined by Arapaho tribes in the early 1800s.

The Indigenous Nations who have ties to the Boulder Valley include the Apache, Arapaho, Cheyenne, Comanche, Kiowa, Pawnee, Shoshone, Sioux, and Ute peoples. In the 1800s, Euro-American settlers colonized the area.

Boulder was founded in late 1858 when prospectors led by Thomas Aikins arrived at Boulder Canyon during the Colorado Gold Rush. Arapaho leader Niwot allowed them to stay for the winter, but the settlers abused this peaceful approach, and some later took part in the Sand Creek massacre of Arapaho. In early 1859, gold was discovered along Boulder Creek, drawing more miners and merchants to the area. The Boulder City Town Company was formed in February 1859 to establish a settlement at the canyon mouth. The Boulder, Nebraska Territory, post office opened on April 22, 1859.

On August 24, 1859, voters of the Pike&#x27;s Peak mining region approved the formation of the Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson, and on November 28, 1859, the extralegal Jefferson Territory created Jackson County with Boulder City as its seat. By 1860, Boulder City had 70 cabins, occupied mainly by Anglo families. Non-whites like Chinese miners and black residents were part of early Boulder, but were rarely pictured.

The free Territory of Colorado was organized on February 28, 1861, and Boulder County was created on November 1, 1861, with Boulder City as its seat The Arapaho were forced to relocate by the Treaty of Fort Wise. With declining numbers, Niwot&#x27;s band soon moved to the Cheyenne-Arapaho Reservation. By 1862, the creek had yielded $100,000 in gold, and Boulder&#x27;s population exceeded 300.

On November 7, 1861, the Colorado General Assembly passed legislation to locate the University of Colorado in Boulder. The City of Boulder City was incorporated on November 4, 1871. On September 20, 1875, the first cornerstone was laid for the first building (Old Main) on the CU campus. Colorado became a state on August 1, 1876, and the university officially opened on September 5, 1877. The City of Boulder City shortened its name to the City of Boulder.

In 1907, Boulder adopted an anti-saloon ordinance. In 1916, statewide prohibition started in Colorado, and ended with the repeal of national prohibition in 1933.
=== Housing ===
Median home prices rose 60% from 2010 to 2015 to $648,200. In 2024, the City Council of Boulder repealed a long-standing law that prevented Boulder from increasing new residential units by more than 1% in a year.

In 1959, city voters approved the &quot;Blue Line&quot; city-charter amendment, which restricted city water service to altitudes below , to protect the mountain backdrop from development. In 1967, city voters approved a dedicated sales tax to acquire open space to contain urban sprawl. In 1970, Boulder created a &quot;comprehensive plan&quot; to dictate future zoning, transportation, and urban planning decisions. Hoping to preserve residents&#x27; views of the mountains, in 1972, the city enacted an ordinance limiting the height of newly constructed buildings. In 1974, a Historic Preservation Code was passed. In 1976, a &quot;residential-growth management&quot; ordinance, the Danish Plan, was passed.

==Geography==
The city of Boulder is located in the Boulder Valley, where the Rocky Mountains meet the Great Plains. The Flatirons, slabs of sedimentary stone tilted up on the foothills, are located west of the city and are a widely recognized symbol of Boulder.

Boulder Creek is the primary flow of water through Boulder. The creek was named before the city&#x27;s founding and its etymology is unknown. It is from Boulder Creek that the city is believed to have taken its name. Boulder Creek has significant water flow, derived primarily from snow melt and minor springs west of the city. The creek flows into St. Vrain Creek east of Longmont, which is a tributary of the South Platte River.

At the 2020 United States census, the city had a total area of , including of water.

The 40th parallel, 40 degrees north latitude, runs through Boulder and can be easily recognized as Baseline Road today.

Boulder lies in a wide basin beneath Flagstaff Mountain just a few miles east of the continental divide and about northwest of Denver. Arapahoe Glacier provides water for the city, along with Boulder Creek, which flows through the center of the city.

Denver International Airport is located east-southeast of Boulder.

===Environment===
In 1899, government preservation of open space around Boulder began, with the Congress of the United States approving the allocation of of mountain backdrop/watershed extending from South Boulder Creek to Sunshine Canyon.

====Wildlife protection====
Boulder has created an Urban Wildlife Management Plan which sets policies for managing and protecting urban wildlife. The city&#x27;s Parks and Recreation and Open Space and Mountain Parks departments have volunteers who monitor parks, including wetlands, lakes, etc., to protect ecosystems. From time to time, parks and hiking trails are closed to conserve or restore ecosystems.
Traditionally, Boulder has avoided using chemical pesticides to control the insect population. However, with the threat of West Nile virus, the city began an integrative plan to control the mosquito population in 2003 that includes chemical pesticides. Residents can opt out of the program by contacting the city and asking that their areas not be sprayed.

Under Boulder law, exterminating prairie dogs requires a permit.

In 2005, the city experimented with using goats for weed control in environmentally sensitive areas. Goats naturally consume diffuse knapweed and Canada thistle, and although the program was not as effective as it was hoped, goats will still be considered in future weed control projects. In 2010, goats were used to keep weeds under control at the Boulder Reservoir.

The city&#x27;s Open Space and Mountain Parks department manages approximately of protected forest land west of the city, in accordance with a 1999 Forest Ecosystem Management Plan. The plan aims to maintain or enhance native plant and animal species, their communities, the ecological processes that sustain them and to reduce the wildfire risk to forest and human communities.

===Climate===


Boulder has a temperate climate typical for much of the state and receives many sunny or mostly sunny days each year. Boulder is considered semi-arid (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;) or humid subtropical (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) within the Köppen climate classification due to its relatively high yearly precipitation and average temperatures remaining above year-round.

Winter conditions range from generally mild to the occasional bitterly cold. Highs average in the mid to upper 40s °F (7–9 °C). There are 4.6 nights annually where the temperature drops to . Because of orographic lift, the mountains to the west often dry out the air passing over the Front Range, shielding the city from precipitation in winter, though heavy snowfalls may occur. Snowfall averages per season. Snow depth is usually shallow. Due to the high elevation, a strong warming sun can quickly melt snow cover during the day and Chinook winds bring rapid warm-ups throughout the winter months.

Summers are warm, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. There are roughly 30 days of or above each year. Diurnal temperature variation is typically large due to the high elevation and semi-arid climate. Daytime highs are generally cooler than those of most Colorado cities with similar elevations.

The highest recorded temperature of was on June 25, 2012. The record low was on January 17, 1930. The coldest high temperature, , was on February 4, 1989. The warmest overnight low was on July 20, 1998, with a temperature of

===&quot;eTown&quot;===
The internationally syndicated radio program &quot;eTown&quot; has its headquarters at eTown Hall, at the intersection of 16th and Spruce Streets, in downtown Boulder. Most tapings of this weekly show are done at eTown Hall.

===Polar Bear Plunge===
Beginning in 1983, hundreds of people head to the Boulder Reservoir on New Year&#x27;s Day to take part in the annual polar bear plunge. With rescue teams standing by, participants use a variety of techniques to plunge themselves into the freezing reservoir. Once the plunge is complete, swimmers retreat to hot tubs on the reservoir beach to revive themselves from the cold.

===Naked Pumpkin Run===
Starting in 1998, dozens of people have taken part in a Halloween run down the city&#x27;s streets wearing only shoes and a hollowed-out pumpkin on their heads. In 2009, local police threatened participants with charges of indecent exposure, and no naked runners were reported in official newscasts, although a few naked runners were observed by locals. Several illegal attempts, resulting in arrests, have been made to restart the run, but no serious effort has been mounted.

===420===
For several years on April 20, thousands of people gathered on the CU Boulder campus to celebrate 420 and smoke marijuana at and before 4:20 pm. The 2010 head count was officially between 8,000 and 15,000 with some discrepancy between the local papers and the university administrators, who have been thought to have been attempting to downplay the event. Eleven citations were given out whereas the year before there were only two.

2011 was the last year of mass 420 partying at CU as the university, in 2012, took a hard stance against 420 activities, closing the campus to visitors for the day, using smelly fish fertilizer to discourage gathering at the Norlin Quad, and having out-of-town law enforcement agencies help secure the campus. In 2013, April 20 fell on a Saturday. The university continued the 420 party ban and closed the campus to visitors. In 2015 the government conceded and once again opened the park to visitors on April 20.

===Boulder Cruiser Ride===

The Happy Thursday Cruiser Ride is a weekly bicycle ride in Boulder Colorado. The Boulder Cruiser Ride grew from a group of friends and friends of friends in the early 90&#x27;s riding bicycles around Boulder into the social cycling event it is today. Some enthusiasts gather wearing costumes and decorating their bikes; themes are an integral part of the cruiser tradition. Boulder Police began following the cruiser ride as it gained in popularity in the early 2000s.

Issues with underage drinking, reckless bicycle riding, and other nuisance complaints led organizers to drop the cruiser ride as a public event. Returning to an underground format, where enthusiasts must become part of the social network before gaining access to event sites, the Boulder Cruiser Ride has continued as a local tradition. On May 30, 2013, over 400 riders attended the Thursday-night Cruiser Ride in honor of &quot;Big Boy&quot;, an elk that was shot and killed on New Year&#x27;s Day by an on-duty Boulder Police officer.

==Parks and recreation==

Boulder is surrounded by thousands of acres of recreational open space, conservation easements, and nature preserves. Almost 60%, , of open space totaling is open to the public.

The unincorporated community of Eldorado Springs, south of Boulder, is home to rock climbing routes. There are climbing routes available in the city open space, including climbing routes of varying difficulty on the Flatirons themselves (traditional protection). Boulder Canyon (sport), directly west of downtown Boulder, has many routes. All three of these areas are affected by seasonal closures for wildlife.

==Government==
Boulder is a home rule municipality, being self-governing under Article XX of the Constitution of the State of Colorado; Title 31, Article 1, Section 202 of the Colorado Revised Statutes.

By residents and detractors alike, Boulder is often referred to as the &quot;People&#x27;s Republic of Boulder&quot;.

In 1974, the Boulder City Council passed Colorado&#x27;s first ordinance prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation. Boulder voters repealed the measure by referendum within a year. In 1975, Boulder County Clerk Clela Rorex was the second in the United States ever to grant same-sex marriage licenses, prior to state laws being passed to prevent such issuance.

In July 2019, Boulder declared a &quot;climate emergency&quot; and established target dates for achieving 100% renewable electricity, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from city organizations and facilities, an increase in local generation of electricity through renewable sources, and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the community.

==Media==

Boulder&#x27;s main daily newspaper, the &quot;Daily Camera&quot;, was founded in 1890 as the weekly &quot;Boulder Camera&quot;, and became a daily newspaper in 1891. The &quot;Colorado Daily&quot; was started in 1892 as a university newspaper for CU Boulder. Following many heated controversies over &quot;Colorado Daily&quot; political coverage, it severed its ties to the university in 1971. From 1996 to 2000, the &quot;Boulder Planet&quot; competed with the &quot;Boulder Weekly&quot; as a free weekly.

Newspaper conglomerate Scripps acquired the &quot;Colorado Daily&quot; in 2005 after its acquisition of the &quot;Camera&quot; in 1997, leaving the &quot;Boulder Weekly&quot; as the only locally owned newspaper in Boulder. Scripps relinquished its 50 percent ownership in both daily papers in early 2009 to Media News Group. &quot;Boulder Magazine&quot;, a lifestyle magazine, was founded in 1978. &quot;Boulder Magazine&quot; is published three times per year.

Boulder is part of the Denver market for television stations, and it receives many radio stations based in Denver or Ft. Collins. For cable television, Boulder is served by Comcast Cable. The city operates public service Boulder 8 TV on cable (high- and standard-definition), which airs, live-streams and archives council meetings. With its in-house video production facilities, it also produces news, talk and informational programming. Over-the-air television reception is poor in the western part of the city because of interference from mountains.

Non-commercial community radio station KGNU was founded in 1978 and commercial music station KBCO in 1977. KBCO programs an adult album alternative format and is owned and operated by iHeartMedia. KBCO moved its studios from Boulder to the Denver Tech Center in 2010. It maintains the Boulder license and transmits from atop Eldorado Mountain south of Boulder.

KVCU, also known as Radio 1190, is a non-commercial radio station run with the help of university-student volunteers. KVCU started broadcasting in 1998.

NPR programming is heard over KCFC 1490 AM, operated by Colorado Public Radio, and simulcasting Denver station KCFR 90.1.

KRKS-FM 94.7, owned and operated by Salem Media Group and affiliated with SRN News, offers a Christian talk and teaching format, and has its transmitter located on Lee Hill, northwest of Boulder.

The University of Colorado Press, a non-profit co-op of various western universities, publishes academic books, as do Lynne Rienner Publishers, Paradigm Publishers, and Westview Press. Paladin Press book/video publishers and &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; magazine both have their headquarters in Boulder. Paladin Press was founded in September 1970 by Peder Lund and Robert K. Brown. In 1974, Lund bought out Brown&#x27;s share of the press, and Brown founded &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; magazine in 1975.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Since Boulder has operated under residential growth control ordinances since 1976, the growth of employment in the city has far outstripped population growth. Considerable road traffic enters the city each morning and leaves each afternoon, since many employees live in Longmont, Lafayette, Louisville, Broomfield, Westminster, and Denver. Boulder is served by US 36 and a variety of state highways. Parking regulations in Boulder have been explicitly designed to discourage parking by commuters and to encourage the use of mass transit, with mixed results.

Over the years, Boulder has made significant investments in the multi-modal network. The city is now well known for its grade-separated bicycle and pedestrian paths, which are integrated into a network of bicycle lanes, cycle tracks, and on-street bicycle routes. Boulder provides a community transit network that connects downtown, the University of Colorado campuses, and local shopping amenities. Boulder has no rail transit. Local and regional shuttle busses are funded by a variety of sources. Due in part to these investments in pedestrian, bicycle, and transit infrastructure, Boulder has been recognized both nationally and internationally for its transportation system.

In 2009, the Boulder metropolitan statistical area (MSA) ranked as the fourth highest in the United States for percentage of commuters who biked to work, at 5.4 percent. In 2013, the Boulder MSA ranked as the fourth lowest in the United States for percentage of workers who commuted by private automobile, at 71.9 percent. During the same time period, 11.1 percent of Boulder area workers had no commute whatsoever: they worked out of the home.

====Bus service====
Boulder has an extensive bus system operated by the Regional Transportation District (RTD). The HOP, SKIP, JUMP, Bound, DASH and Stampede routes run throughout the city and connect to nearby communities with departures every ten minutes during peak hours, Monday-Friday. Other routes, such as the 204, 205, 206, 208 and 209 depart every 15 to 30 minutes. Regional routes, traveling between nearby cities such as Longmont (BOLT, J), Golden (GS), and Denver (Flatiron Flyer, a bus rapid transit route), as well as Denver International Airport (AB), are also available. There are over 100 scheduled daily bus trips on seven routes that run between Boulder and Denver on weekdays.

====Railroads====
Freight service is provided by Union Pacific and BNSF.

Currently there is no intercity passenger service. The last remaining services connecting the Front Range cities ceased with the formation of Amtrak in 1971.

=====Future transit plans=====
Front Range Passenger Rail is a current proposal (as of 2023) to link the cities from Pueblo in the south, north to Fort Collins and possibly to Cheyenne, Wyoming.

A RTD commuter rail route called the Northwest Rail Line, also known as the B Line, is proposed to run from Denver through Boulder to Longmont, with stops in major communities along the way. The Boulder station is to be north of Pearl Street and east of 30th Street. At one time this commuter rail service was scheduled to commence in 2014, but major delays have ensued. In 2016, an initial segment opened, reaching from downtown Denver to southern Westminster at Westminster Station. The remaining of the Northwest Rail Line is planned to be completed by 2044, depending upon funding.

These future transit plans, as well as the current Flatiron Flyer Bus Rapid Transit route, are part of FasTracks, an RTD transit improvement plan funded by a 0.4% increase in the sales tax throughout the Denver metro area. RTD, the developer of FasTracks, is partnering with the city of Boulder to plan a transit-oriented development near Pearl and 33rd Streets in association with the proposed Boulder commuter rail station. The development is to feature the Boulder Railroad Depot, already relocated to that site, which may be returned to a transit-related use.

====Cycling====
Boulder, well known for its bicycle culture, has hundreds of miles of bicycle-pedestrian paths, lanes, and routes that interconnect to create a renowned network of bikeways usable year-round. Boulder has 74 bike and pedestrian underpasses that facilitate safer and uninterrupted travel throughout much of the city. The city offers a route-finding website that allows users to map personalized bike routes around the city, and is one of five communities to have received a &quot;Platinum Bicycle Friendly Community&quot; rating from the League of American Bicyclists.

The headquarters of the free and non-obligatory hospitality exchange network for cyclists, Warm Showers, is based in Boulder.

In May 2011, B-cycle bike-sharing opened in Boulder with 100 red bikes and 12 stations.

====Airport====
Boulder Municipal Airport is located northeast of central Boulder, is owned by the City of Boulder and is used exclusively for general aviation, with most traffic consisting of single-engine airplanes and glider aircraft.

==In popular culture==
Woody Allen&#x27;s film &quot;Sleeper&quot; (1973) was filmed on location in Boulder. Some houses and the Mesa Laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, designed by I. M. Pei, were used in the film.

Boulder was a setting for Stephen King&#x27;s book &quot;The Stand&quot; (1978), as the gathering point for some of the survivors of the superflu. King lived in Boulder for a little less than a year, beginning in the autumn of 1974, and wrote &quot;The Shining&quot; (1977) during this period.

The television sitcom &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; (1978–1982) was set in Boulder, with 1619 Pine St. serving as the exterior shot of Mindy&#x27;s home. The New York Deli, a now closed restaurant in the Pearl Street Mall, was also featured prominently in the series.

In the American version of the television sitcom &quot;The Office&quot;, the character Michael Scott leaves the show in season 7 and moves with his fiancée to Boulder.

&quot;Boulder to Birmingham&quot; is a song written by Emmylou Harris and Bill Danoff which first appeared on Harris&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Pieces of the Sky&quot;. It has served as something of a signature tune for the artist and recounts her feelings of grief in the years following the death of country rock star and mentor Gram Parsons.

The Comedy Central television show &quot;Broad City&quot; ends with the protagonist, Abby, moving to Boulder for an art fellowship.

Significant parts of the 2006 movie Catch and Release were filmed in Boulder, and includes many well-known Boulder institutions such as Celestial Seasonings, the Boulder Farmer&#x27;s Market, and Pearl Street Mall.

==Sister cities==
Boulder&#x27;s sister cities are:

* Dushanbe, Tajikistan (1987)
* Jalapa, Nueva Segovia Department, Nicaragua (1983)
* Kathmandu, Nepal (2018)
* Kisumu, Kenya (2008)
* Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region, China (1986)
* El Mante, Tamaulipas, Mexico (2000)
* Nablus, West Bank, Palestine (2016)
* Ramat HaNegev, Southern District, Israel (2018)
* Yamagata, Yamagata, Japan (1994)
* Yateras, Guantánamo Province, Cuba (2002)
Landmarks representing Boulder&#x27;s connection with its various sister cities can be found throughout the city. Boulder&#x27;s Sister City Plaza – dedicated on May 17, 2007 – is located on the east lawn of Boulder&#x27;s Municipal Building. The plaza was built to honor all of Boulder&#x27;s sister city relationships.

The Dushanbe Tea House is located on 13th Street just south of the Pearl Street Mall. Dushanbe presented its distinctive tea house as a gift to Boulder in 1987. It was completed in Tajikistan in 1990 and then shipped to Boulder, where it was reassembled and opened to the public in 1998.

A mural representing the relationship between Boulder and Mante, Mexico, was dedicated in August 2001. The mural, which was painted by Mante muralist Florian Lopez, is located on the north-facing wall of the Dairy Center for the Performing Arts.

<text>Uxbridge () is a suburban town in west London, England, and the administrative headquarters of the London Borough of Hillingdon, northwest of Charing Cross. Uxbridge formed part of the parish of Hillingdon in the county of Middlesex. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century it expanded and increased in population, becoming a municipal borough in 1955, and part of Greater London in 1965.

Attempted negotiations between King Charles I and the Parliamentary Army during the English Civil War took place at a public house where the Crown and Treaty. RAF Uxbridge houses the Battle of Britain Bunker, from where the air defence of the south-east of England was coordinated during the Battle of Britain especially from its No. 11 Group Operations Room, also used during the D-Day landings.

Today the town serves as a significant retail and commercial centre; it also houses Brunel University London as well as a campus of Buckinghamshire New University. A part of the town which has large converted flour mills adjoins Buckinghamshire, the boundary being the River Colne.

The 2011 Census recorded a population of 70,560.

==History==

=== Toponymy/ etymology ===
The name of the town is derived from &quot;Wixan&#x27;s Bridge&quot;, which was sited near the bottom of Oxford Road where a modern road bridge stands, beside the &quot;Swan and Bottle&quot; public house. The Wixan were a 7th-century Saxon tribe from Lincolnshire who also began to settle in what became Middlesex. Anglo-Saxons began to settle and farm in the area of Uxbridge in the 5th century, clearing dense woodland. Two other places in Middlesex bore the name of the Wixan: &quot;Uxendon&quot; (&quot;Wixan&#x27;s Hill&quot;), a name preserved only in the street names of Uxendon Hill and Crescent in Harrow, and &quot;Waxlow&quot; (&quot;Wixan&#x27;s Wood&quot;) near Southall.

Archaeologists found Bronze Age remains (before 700 BC) and medieval remains during the construction of &quot;The Chimes&quot; shopping centre; two miles (3.2 km) away at Denham, Upper Paleolithic remains have been found. Uxbridge is not mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of the 11th century, but a hundred years later St Margaret&#x27;s Church, was built. The town appears in records from 1107 as &quot;Woxbrigge&quot;, and became part of the Elthorne Hundred with other settlements in the area.

===Early developments===
The Parliamentary Army garrisoned the town upon the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 and established their headquarters there in June 1647 on a line from Staines to Watford, although the king passed through Uxbridge in April 1646, resting at the Red Lion public house for several hours. Charles I met with representatives of Parliament at the Crown Inn in Uxbridge in 1645, but negotiations for the end of hostilities were unsuccessful due in part to the king&#x27;s stubborn attitude. The town had been chosen as it was located between the Royal headquarters at Oxford and the Parliamentary stronghold of London.

The covered market was built in 1788, replacing a building constructed in 1561. In the early 19th century, Uxbridge had an unsavoury reputation; the jurist William Arabin said of its residents &quot;They will steal the very teeth out of your mouth as you walk through the streets. I know it from experience.&quot; For about 200 years most of London&#x27;s flour was produced in the Uxbridge area.

The Grand Junction Canal opened in 1794, linking Uxbridge with Birmingham and the River Thames at Brentford. By 1800 Uxbridge had become one of the most important market towns in Middlesex, helped by its status as the first stopping point for stagecoaches travelling from London to Oxford. The development of Uxbridge declined after the opening of the Great Western Railway in 1838, which passed through West Drayton. A branch line to Uxbridge was opened in 1856, but it was the opening of the Metropolitan Line in 1904 which restarted Uxbridge&#x27;s growth by giving the town its first direct link to London.

Harman&#x27;s Brewery was established in Uxbridge by George Harman in 1763, and moved into a new headquarters in Uxbridge High Street in 1875. The eventual owners of the brewery, Courage, closed the headquarters in 1964. It was demolished and replaced by a Budgen&#x27;s supermarket, which in turn was demolished with the construction of The Chimes shopping centre. The brewery building in George Street remained in place until it was demolished in 1967. The office building Harman House was built on the site in 1985, named after the brewery.

===Urban development===

The main enclosures effected in the parish of Hillingdon, by statute in 1819, saw the reduction of Uxbridge Common, which at its largest had been in circumference. It originally straddled Park Road, north of the town centre, and covers .

In 1871 the town&#x27;s first purpose-built police station was built in Windsor Street. The building included three cells and stables. The Metropolitan Police continued to use the building until 1988, when operations moved to a new site in Harefield Road. The building subsequently became the &quot;Old Bill&quot; public house in 1996, renamed the &quot;Fig Tree&quot; in 2006.

In the early 1900s the Uxbridge and District Electricity Supply Company had been established a power station in Waterloo Road, and much of the town was connected by 1902, although some houses still had gas lighting in 1912. A water tower on Uxbridge Common was built in 1906, resembling a church tower, to improve the supply to the town.

Wood panelling from a room in the &quot;Crown &amp; Treaty&quot; public house was sold in 1924 to an American businessman, who installed it in his office in the Empire State Building in New York. It was returned in 1953 as a gift to the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II and returned to the house, although the monarch retained ownership.

On 31 August 1935 Uxbridge Lido, an outdoor swimming pool built in the &quot;Moderne&quot; or Art Deco style, was officially opened. Before the opening, many residents swam in a section of the Frays River near Harefield Road, and the Colne. The pool, pavilion building, entrance building and both fountains were designated Grade II listed buildings in 1998. Despite the listing, the pool was closed to the public and the buildings became subject to heavy vandalism. The Uxbridge open-air pool was fully refurbished during 2009 and re-opened in May 2010. Added to the site, renamed Hillingdon Sports and Leisure Complex, was a 50 m indoor competition pool, a leisure pool, a 100-station gym, a wide range of exercise classes, an athletics stadium and track, 3G floodlit pitches, a sports hall, a café and a crèche. The Grade II listed buildings are still standing.

During the Second World War Uxbridge adopted the Royal Navy destroyer in 1942, to help towards the ship&#x27;s costs; &quot;Intrepid&quot; was lost to enemy action the following year. The town and surrounding areas suffered bombing by the Luftwaffe. V1 flying bombs fell on the town between June 1944 and March 1945. The first recorded bombing using a V1 was on 22 June 1944 at 07:00, when the bomb passed over the top of a bus and hit four houses nearby. Seven people were killed and 25 injured, leaving 46 houses in the area uninhabitable. In all the Uxbridge Urban District suffered 79 civilian deaths through enemy action in the war.
In 1958 the Lowe &amp; Shawyer plant nursery to the west of RAF Uxbridge entered voluntary liquidation. The nursery had stood in Kingston Lane since 1868, and was the largest producer of cut flowers in the country. Demolition work began in 1962, and the construction of Brunel University commenced. Chrysanthemums are included the coat of arms of the Borough of Uxbridge in memory of the nursery. The Uxbridge (Vine Street) railway branch line, which partly ran alongside the site, was closed in 1964 and in 1966 the university opened, purchasing the land where the railway had run from the local council for £65,000.

The Uxbridge Cricket Club moved from Cricketfield Road in 1971 to make way for the new Civic Centre. The club had been at Cricketfield Road since 1858, but moved to a new site on part of Uxbridge Common on Park Road. The Market Square shopping precinct in the town centre was built in the late 1970s, but its lack of shelter made it unpopular and it did not attract the expected levels of custom. Many buildings along the High Street and Windsor Street had been demolished to make way for the new precinct, which was eventually sold to the Prudential Assurance Company and redeveloped with a roof in the early 1980s to become the Pavilions Shopping Centre. The &quot;Peacock&quot; public house (later renamed The Chequers) in one of the two main squares was built partially underground having two flights of steps down into the pub at either end. It was demolished and replaced with a café named also named The Chequers, which remains. Rayner&#x27;s pharmacy shop was also demolished during the Market Square development, although the shopfront was saved by the Museum of London and is held in storage.

The Chimes shopping centre was built beside Uxbridge station in 2001, incorporating many of the existing buildings into the new structure. The centre was originally to be named St George&#x27;s Centre in plans dating back to the early 1990s, though this name was eventually taken by another shopping centre in Harrow. Instead, The Chimes was said to refer to the sound of the bells from the nearby market house on the High Street. An Odeon cinema opened as a major part of the centre, with the smaller cinema at the opposite end of the High Street closing. Some houses on Chippendale Way and the St George&#x27;s car park were demolished to allow for the construction of the new shopping centre car park. The offices of the local building company Fassnidge were also included in the new development; built in the 19th century, they house a Pizza Express restaurant. Preserved timber from earlier demolished buildings in Uxbridge was used in the construction of a new building beside the former offices of Fassnidge, designed to resemble a much older structure.

In 2002 the dry ski slope near Park Road and the Uxbridge Lido was closed and the remaining buildings and structures removed. The Hillingdon Ski Centre had been subject to several arson attacks during 2001 and the company operating it became insolvent. The slope, which had been built in 1977, was left to return to nature.

Work began in 2008 to extensively refurbish and extend Uxbridge Lido, and it reopened to the public in February 2010 as the Hillingdon Sports and Leisure Complex. On 8 September 2010 the 75th anniversary of the first opening of the Lido was celebrated at the pool.

==Governance==
Uxbridge is known from tithe assignments to the vicar of Hillingdon in 1281 and hundreds of later documents as a chapelry in the large parish of Hillingdon; the town core was upgraded to a full parish (and thus its large chapel to a church) in 1827. Eleven years later a parish of Saint John was added in Uxbridge Moor, Hillingdon. A parish of Saint Andrew, Uxbridge, was added in 1865. From Tudor times, parishes had a select or elect vestry which determined much local maintenance, including poor relief, but under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, broader local poor law unions took on the relief role and shifted funds towards workhouses and associated hospitals.

Uxbridge was in the first main wave of the new, secular system of civil parishes, gaining a council and territory in 1866, and an Urban District under the Local Government Act 1894. In 1955 the council successfully petitioned for a charter of incorporation and became a municipal borough. This stood for ten years, followed by incorporation into the new system of London Boroughs, as the London Borough of Hillingdon.

Uxbridge gave its name to a parliamentary constituency from 1885 until 2010, when boundary changes led to the creation of the Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency. The seat is currently held by Danny Beales of the Labour Party.

==Geography==

Uxbridge lies at a mean elevation of above mean sea level. Like much of the rest of the UK its climate is generally temperate, with few extremes of temperature or weather.

The landscape upon which the settlement of Uxbridge was established is largely unchanged from the Mesolithic era. Much of it was covered by oak and elm trees, which were gradually cleared by early settlers. An archaeological excavation by the Museum of London in the 1990s found evidence of flint items shaped by Mesolithic hunters, as well as various animal bones and traces of charcoal from the remains of campfires.

The River Pinn runs through Uxbridge, passing through the former site of RAF Uxbridge and the grounds of Brunel University. It joins the Frays River, which branches off from the River Colne and acts as the boundary between Uxbridge and the neighbouring county of Buckinghamshire.

Uxbridge is centred from Charing Cross in Central London; from Hayes; from Ruislip; from Northolt; from Slough; and from High Wycombe.

==Demography==
The table below shows housing data for Uxbridge, broadly defined, and its neighbourhoods.
The population of Uxbridge North was estimated in 2009 by the Office for National Statistics as 11,812, and 11,887 for Uxbridge South. Around 85% of residents of Uxbridge North are White, 6% more than both the borough average and Uxbridge South. Other residents are mixed-race, Asian or Asian British, Black or Black British, and Chinese or other ethnic groups. Uxbridge South has more Black and Chinese residents than any other Hillingdon ward.

By the time of the 2011 UK Census, the population of Uxbridge had reached 12,048 in Uxbridge North and 13,979 in Uxbridge South. The most common ethnic group in Uxbridge North was White British (69.8%), followed by Asian or Asian British (19.5%) and Black or Black British (4.1%). The remaining percentage was made up of mixed-race and other unspecified ethnic groups. White British was also the largest ethnic group in Uxbridge South, at 62.1%, followed by Asian or Asian British (22.6%), Black or Black British (7.3%) and mixed-race (4.3%). The remaining percentage was made up of other unspecified ethnic groups.

Uxbridge North&#x27;s largest sector of employment, according to the 2001 and 2011 censuses, was management.

The life expectancy for men was estimated at 77 years in Uxbridge North, compared with 74 years in Uxbridge South. The figures for women are 83 years in Uxbridge North and 81 years in Uxbridge South.

===Churches===
====St Margaret&#x27;s Church====
This is the original parish church of Uxbridge, and one of the oldest buildings in the town. Located in Windsor Street, it is known to have existed since at least 1245, when a series of hearings took place there in which the Abbot of Bec in Normandy brought an action against the rector of Great Wratting in Suffolk for non-payment of tithes. On parchments kept at St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, in connection with this event, St. Margaret&#x27;s is mentioned by name, and there are several other references between 1245 and 1247 to the &quot;chapel at Uxbridge&quot;.

The oldest portion of the existing building is part of the north tower, which was built in the late 14th century. The north aisle, together with the nave and its arcades, dates from the early 15th century, while the south aisle, with its fine hammer-beam roof, was added about 1450. The carved stone font was placed in the church soon afterwards, dating from about 1480.

For most of its history, St Margaret&#x27;s served as a chapel-of-ease to St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church in Hillingdon; it was not until 1827 that it was given its own parish.

====St Andrew&#x27;s Church====
By the 1850s the population of both Hillingdon and Uxbridge was beginning to rise. With new housing being built between the two centres the then Vicar of Hillingdon, Richard Croft (served 1856–69) gained permission to build a new local church for a newer part of the town traditionally called Hillingdon West. He asked architect Sir George Gilbert Scott &quot;to draw up plans to build a church without unnecessary ornament but in handsome proportions suitable to its position at the entrance to Uxbridge Town...&quot;

Scott produced his plans and local Uxbridge builder William Fassnidge was employed to construct the church. On St Peter&#x27;s Day, 29 June 1864, the foundation stone was laid at the south end of the chancel arch by the Lord Bishop of London, Archibald Campbell Tait. He returned to consecrate and open the church on the feast day of saints Philip and James, 1 May 1865.

The spire was completed the following year. Together with the bells, vestry and organ and other embellishments, the building cost £12,000 ().

====Church of Our Lady of Lourdes and St Michael====
After the Reformation in the 16th century, there was no official Roman Catholic place of worship in Uxbridge until after the passing of the Catholic Emancipation Act in the late 19th century. In 1892 Father Michael Aloysius Wren bought a presbytery at 37 Lawn Road, next to which a temporary church of corrugated iron was built, dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes and St Michael. St Mary&#x27;s School was also founded on Rockingham Road at this time. Fr Wren was helped by his nephew John, who acted as his assistant priest. They covered an extensive area, including the modern Catholic parishes of Ruislip and Hillingdon.

The mission grew and by 1907 the congregation numbered 150, with school attendance at 60. In time plans were made for a larger, more permanent church. This was led by Father Thomas Moloney, who bought the current presbytery and acquired the land that stood at the back so that a church could be built. The foundation stone was eventually laid on Low Sunday 1931 by Archbishop Alban Goodier, an English Jesuit who had been Archbishop of Bombay between 1919 and 1926. The new church, in Oxford Road, was designed by the diocesan architect, T. H. B. Scott. It was built of brick in the Romanesque style, seating 350. The church was opened by Cardinal Bourne on 29 September 1931 and was officially consecrated on 14 May 1936, after its debts were cleared.

====Faith Assembly, Uxbridge====
The Redeemed Christian Church of God is based at 2 Harefield Road, worship is in the Kate Fasnidge Hall, it is contemporary and Pentecostal.

==Economy==
As of 2012, Uxbridge had of town centre floorspace. Uxbridge has two shopping centres, The Pavilions and The Chimes (formerly Intu Uxbridge). Much of the town centre is pedestrianised. Just off the High Street is Windsor Street, a short street with older shops.

The town centre consists of retail outlets and office buildings, including the main UK and European offices of international companies such as Coca-Cola European Partners, Cadbury, Xerox, General Mills, F. Hinds, PAREXEL, Arri, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Monster Energy, APL, Herbalife Europe. Other employers include NetApp, Anixter International, PricewaterhouseCoopers, WMS Gaming, IBB Solicitors and Nexen.

Within the London Borough, 55.1% of residents travel to the Uxbridge North and Uxbridge South wards to work, and only 8% of residents working there who also live within the wards. The 2001 census measured a total of 6,007 (35.9%) of residents leaving the North ward to go to work. Uxbridge South had a figure of 5,666 (26.5%) of residents leaving the ward to work elsewhere.

In 2005 retail footprint research, Uxbridge ranked 9th in terms of retail expenditure in Greater London at £311 million.

A terraced landmark with tower on Vine Street is what was Randalls, the Art Deco-architecture department store owned by relations of John Randall MP. It is a 1939, remodelled rebuilding of a 1900 building. The building has the initial, mainstream category of listed building since October 2008. The store closed in January 2015.

==Education==
Primary schools in Uxbridge include Hermitage Primary School, St Andrew&#x27;s Church of England Primary School, St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, Whitehall Infant School, and Whitehall Junior School. Uxbridge High School is a comprehensive secondary school in the town.

Uxbridge is also home to Brunel University and the Buckinghamshire New University&#x27;s nursing campus. The main campus of Uxbridge College is also in the town.

==Transport==

Uxbridge tube station is the western terminus of branches of the Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines of the London Underground. The station, built in 1933, is fronted by a pedestrian high street and is connected to a bus terminus with connections to Hillingdon, Hayes, Ealing, Ruislip, and Slough. Uxbridge Belmont Road was the first underground station, built slightly outside the town centre to allow for a possible extension to High Wycombe. This was subsequently replaced by the current station.

There were two Great Western Railway branch lines to Uxbridge with terminus stations at Uxbridge Vine Street (originally just Uxbridge Station) and Uxbridge High Street. The two railway lines were planned to be joined, with a new Uxbridge station to be built on the west side of the town replacing the existing station at Vine Street which had been opened in 1856. Work on the new branch line from the north at Denham started in 1900. However with the Metropolitan Railway being extended into Uxbridge Belmont Road station in 1904 it was decided to temporarily terminate the line at a bridge over Uxbridge High Street. The extension through Uxbridge to join the lines was never completed. Uxbridge High Street station opened on 1 May 1907 but had low passenger numbers and closed on 1 September 1939 as a war economy and never reopened. By the 1960s the Uxbridge Vine Street branch line to West Drayton station was being affected by competition on London services from the town&#x27;s faster Underground lines. Passenger services were stopped on 10 September 1962. Goods traffic ceased two years later. Uxbridge Vine Street station was demolished in 1969.

The B483 road connects the centre of Uxbridge with the Swakeleys Roundabout junction of the A40. Uxbridge is also connected by major roads to Slough, Denham, Ickenham, Cowley, Iver Heath, Hillingdon Heath and Hayes.

The Grand Union Canal, formerly the Grand Junction Canal, connects London with Birmingham and passes immediately to the west of Uxbridge, forming part of the borough boundary. The first stretch was built in the late 18th century from Brentford to Uxbridge. Further upstream is Uxbridge Lock, and nearby is a derelict flour mill formerly owned by Allied Mills. The mill was bought in the 19th century by William King, who named it &quot;Kingsmill&quot;. Kingsmill continues to be used as a brand of bread by Associated British Foods.

London Buses routes 222, 331, 427, 607, A10, U1, U2, U3, U4, U5, U7, U9, U10 and N207 serve the area, alongside 8 non-Transport for London (TfL) routes: First Berkshire &amp; The Thames Valley route 3, Green Line route 724 and Carousel Buses routes 101, 102, 104, 105, 581 &amp; 583.

The proposed West London Tram was postponed indefinitely by TfL in August 2007 after it was announced that the Crossrail project would be going ahead. TfL cited &quot;an effective bus-based solution&quot; as an alternative, delivered in conjunction with local councils. Since 2013 the route has been served by the 427, 207, and 607 bus services.

==Landmarks==
===Civic Centre===
The London Borough of Hillingdon&#x27;s Hillingdon Civic Centre was built in Uxbridge High Street in 1973, as part of an effort to unite the services of the council, which had formed in 1965 with the merger of the Municipal Borough of Uxbridge, Ruislip-Northwood Urban District, Hayes and Harlington Urban District and Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District. Before the new building was completed, council services had been spread throughout Uxbridge and the rest of the borough and various buildings, as a result of the merging of the former district councils.

Part of the original Middlesex County Council office building that stood on site was incorporated into the new Civic Centre. The centre&#x27;s clock tower is the only visible section from the old building. The Uxbridge Cricket Club Ground and Uxbridge fire station were relocated as part of the new development, which became controversial owing to its size and cost. Areas of the building, particularly the council chambers, continue to suffer from poor acoustics.

===Uxbridge Magistrates&#x27; Court===
The original Magistrates&#x27; Court opened in 1907 in an Edwardian style. A new building with little exterior styling opened nearby in the 1990s and legal proceedings were transferred. The Magistrates&#x27; Court is often referred to in John Mortimer&#x27;s Rumpole of the Bailey short stories.

===RAF Uxbridge, Battle of Britain Bunker and Hillingdon House===
Uxbridge had a Royal Air Force station, known as RAF Uxbridge, until its closure on 31 March 2010. The station was built within the grounds of Hillingdon House, a 19th-century mansion bought by the British government in 1915, and became the home of RAF Fighter Command&#x27;s No. 11 Group Operations Room during the Battle of Britain. Fighter squadrons at airfields in the south-east of England were directed from the station, which was visited by Prime Minister Winston Churchill during the battle, and other foreign leaders throughout the rest of the war.

Following the station&#x27;s closure, the replica No. 33 Squadron Supermarine Spitfire gate guardian was removed from the main entrance for restoration work and moved to the entrance of the Operations Room (now known as the Battle of Britain Bunker). The area around the bunker was retained as an enclave under the RAF Uxbridge name, under the care of RAF Northolt. An additional guardian, a Hawker Hurricane in the colours of No. 303 (Polish) Squadron, was added to the area in November 2010.

==Sport and leisure==
Uxbridge has a Non-League football team, Uxbridge F.C., which plays at Honeycroft, Yiewsley.
Uxbridge Cricket Club is also based in Uxbridge and is a member of the Middlesex County Cricket League, a designated ECB Premier League.
Hillingdon Sports and Leisure Complex was refurbished im 2010 and contains an indoor and outdoor swimming pool, an athletic track and large sports complex. The South Korean Olympic Team used the centre for training during the 2012 Olympic Games.

<text>Vauxhall ( , ) is an area of Central London, within the London Borough of Lambeth. Named after a medieval manor called Fox Hall, it became well known for the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens.

From the Victorian period until the mid-20th century, Vauxhall was a mixed industrial and residential area, of predominantly manual workers&#x27; homes – many demolished and replaced by Lambeth Council with social housing after the Second World War – and business premises, including large railway, gas, and water works. These industries contrasted with the mostly residential neighbouring districts of Kennington and Pimlico. As in neighbouring Battersea and Nine Elms, riverside redevelopment has converted most former industrial sites into residential properties and new office space.

Vauxhall has given its name to the Vauxhall Bridge, Vauxhall parliamentary constituency and Vauxhall Motors.

==Geography==
Vauxhall is south of Charing Cross and southwest of the actual centre of London at Frazier Street near Lambeth North tube station. Vauxhall is adjacent to the River Thames, on the opposite side of the river to Pimlico. To the north is the district of Lambeth and to the southeast is the district of Kennington. Nine Elms, South Lambeth and Stockwell are to the south of Vauxhall.

Several roads converge at an area known as Vauxhall Cross, where Vauxhall station on the South West Main Line and the bus station are located. To the northeast of Vauxhall Cross is the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens and to the southeast is the large Vauxhall Park.

Vauxhall was part of Surrey until 1889, when the County of London was created.

==Politics==
Vauxhall is within the London Borough of Lambeth. For the 2022 council election, the area became part of the Vauxhall ward, which elects three members of Lambeth London Borough Council.

For Westminster elections, Vauxhall is part of the Vauxhall and Camberwell Green constituency which was created in 2024 to replace the Vauxhall constituency. Florence Eshalomi has held the seat since 2019 for the Labour and Co-operative Party.

==History==
===Toponymy===
&quot;For a list of street name toponymies in the district see Street names of Vauxhall.&quot;

The toponymy of Vauxhall is generally accepted to have originated in the late 13th century, from the name of Falkes de Breauté, the head of King John&#x27;s mercenaries, who owned a large house in the area, which was referred to as Faulke&#x27;s Hall, later Foxhall, and eventually Vauxhall. Samuel Pepys mentions &quot;Fox Hall&quot; in his diary on 23 June 1665: &quot;...I took boat and to Fox Hall, where we spent two or three hours talking of several matters very soberly and contentfully to me, which, with the ayre and pleasure of the garden, was a great refreshment to me, and, ‘methinks, that which we ought to joy ourselves in.&quot; The area only became generally known by the name Vauxhall when the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens opened as a public attraction and movement across the Thames was facilitated by the opening of Westminster Bridge in the 1740s.

====In the Russian language====
Competing theories are given as to why the Russian word for a central railway station is (&quot;vokzal&quot;), which coincides with the canonical 19th-century transliteration of &quot;Vauxhall&quot;. It has long been suggested that a Russian delegation visited the area to inspect the construction of the London &amp; South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR) in 1840, and mistook the name of the station for the generic name of the building type—a &quot;vaux hall&quot;, as it were. This was further embellished into a story that Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, visiting London in 1844, was taken to see the trains at Vauxhall and made the same mistake. Alternatively, the locality of the L&amp;SWR&#x27;s original railway terminus, Nine Elms Station, was shown boldly and simply as &quot;Vauxhall&quot; in the 1841 &quot;Bradshaw&quot; timetable.

Both these explanations can probably be dismissed, since the first public railway in Russia had already been built by 1837. This line ran from Saint Petersburg via Tsarskoye Selo to Pavlovsk Palace, where extensive pleasure gardens had earlier been established. In 1838, a music and entertainment pavilion was constructed at the railway terminus. This pavilion was called the &quot;Vokzal&quot; in homage to the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens in London. The name soon came to be applied to the station itself, which was the gateway that most visitors used to enter the gardens. It later came to mean any substantial railway station building (a different Russian word, станция (&quot;stantsiya&quot;), is used for minor stations).

The word &quot;voksal&quot; (воксал) had been known in the Russian language with the meaning of &quot;amusement park&quot; long before the 1840s and may be found, e.g. in the poetry of Aleksandr Pushkin: (&quot;To Natalie&quot; (1813): &quot;At fêtes or in &quot;voksals&quot;, /I&#x27;ve been flitting like a gentle Zephyrus&quot; []) According to Vasmer, the word is first attested in the &quot;Saint Petersburg Vedomosti&quot; for 1777 in the form фоксал, which may reflect the earlier English spelling of Fox Hall/Faukeshall. Englishman Michael Maddox established a Vauxhall Gardens in the Saint Petersburg suburbs (Pavlovsk) in 1783, with pleasure gardens, a small theatre/concert hall, and places for refreshment. Archdeacon William Coxe describes the place as a &quot;sort of Vauxhall&quot; in that year, in his &quot;Travels into Russia&quot;.

===Early history===
No mention of Vauxhall is made in the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot;. The area originally formed part of the extensive manor of South Lambeth, which was held by the family of de Redvers, feudal barons of Plympton in Devon and Lords of the Isle of Wight. Falkes de Breauté acquired South Lambeth in 1216 when he married Margaret FitzGerold, widow of Baldwin de Redvers (son and heir apparent of William de Redvers, 5th Earl of Devon (d.1217)) and mother of Baldwin de Redvers, 6th Earl of Devon (1217–1245). Falkes de Breauté&#x27;s lands reverted to the de Redvers family after his death in 1226. In 1293, South Lambeth and the manor of &quot;la Sale Faukes&quot; passed, probably by trickery, to King Edward I, who purchased several de Redvers lands (including the Lordship of the Isle of Wight) from Isabel de Forz, 8th Countess of Devon (1237–1293), sister and heiress of Baldwin de Redvers, 7th Earl of Devon (1236–1262), shortly before her death. In 1317 King Edward II granted the manor of Vauxhall, Surrey, to Sir Roger d&#x27;Amory for his &quot;good services&quot; at the Battle of Bannockburn.

From various accounts, three local roads – the South Lambeth Road, Clapham Road (previously Merton Road), and Wandsworth Road (previously Kingston Road) – were ancient and well-known routes to and from London.

Vauxhall was the south western terminus of the Civil War defences of London, thrown up by Londoners in 1642 to defend against Royalist incursions. A landmark fort was located at the present site of the Elephant and Castle public house (currently a Starbucks)

===Development===
The land was flat and parts were marshy and poorly drained by ditches, and only started to be developed with the draining of Lambeth Marsh in the mid-18th century, but remained a village. Prior to this, it provided market garden produce for the nearby City of London. Vauxhall Bridge and Vauxhall Bridge Road were opened in 1816. By 1860, the village had been subsumed by the town of Lambeth. Many of Vauxhall&#x27;s streets were destroyed during the construction of the railway to London Waterloo via the Nine Elms to Waterloo Viaduct, by German bombing in World War II or ravaged through poor city planning.

==Demography==
The explosion in London property prices during the late 1990s and early 2000s has led to a boom in riverside construction, such as the large St George Wharf development by Vauxhall Bridge. This area is continuing to be redeveloped with several newbuilds under construction.

Several gentrified areas have developed, and areas of terraced townhouses on streets such as Fentiman Road and Heyford Avenue have higher property values in the private market; however, 97% of housing stock in Vauxhall is flats, both conversions and purpose-built blocks. Vauxhall is also a popular residential area for members of parliament and civil servants due to its proximity to the Houses of Parliament and Whitehall; Kennington is within the area wired for the Commons&#x27; Division bell. Some 18th- and 19th-century properties also survive – most famously Bonnington Square, a community that emerged from the 1970s–1980s squat scene in London and remains as mostly housing co-operatives today.

Vauxhall is a very ethnically diverse area; 50% are white and 50% of residents originate from a non-white ethnic group. There is a significant Portuguese community, some with a connection to Madeira; many Portuguese restaurants and bars are located in South Lambeth Road and the surrounding area. 

The 2021 census states the plurality of residents, 39.5% are Christians and 37.3% state that they do have a religion. The Muslim community consists of 9.3% of residents.

==Economy==
Much of the area in Vauxhall contains light industry, offices, and government buildings. Many companies and organisations were attracted in the past by Vauxhall&#x27;s central location and comparatively cheap rent compared to Westminster on the other side of the river. In recent years, Vauxhall&#x27;s riverside has undergone major redevelopment with the construction of a number of modern residential and office blocks, most notably the distinctive SIS Building at Vauxhall Cross. Also, a number of new commercial businesses have moved into the area.

==Nightlife==

Vauxhall is home to a number of gay bars and nightclubs, such as Fire, The Eagle, and the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, which dates back to at least the late 19th century, and was for many years a traditional English music hall and cabaret venue. In recent years, the building has come under constant threat of buyout and demolition from property developers, as it stands alone on a prime piece of grassland adjacent to Vauxhall railway station. However, the pub was bought in 2004 by sympathetic owners who have announced, &quot;business as usual&quot;.

Vauxhall was originally the home of the more underground gay clubs with the arrival of Crash in the 1990s. Over the years, more clubs and gay businesses have followed Crash&#x27;s lead by opening up in the railway arches underneath the main line out of Waterloo station. One of the most notable venues to open in the area is Fire night club, which is located on Parry Street and currently occupies ten arches. Fire was the scene of a drugs raid by the Metropolitan Police Service on 28 April 2007 where nine people were arrested. The tactics used in the raid (namely photographing all the persons leaving the venue) were strongly criticised by the gay press at the time.

Before Vauxhall earned its reputation as a gay village, it was regarded among the underground gay club scene as the place to go to avoid the more commercial nights elsewhere in central London. However, the market has become more and more lucrative with the arrival of more venues and more nights, and Vauxhall has been criticised as becoming increasingly commercial, diluting its once underground appeal. The demise of other club venues in London, such as Turnmills, the Astoria and The Fridge, have led to the gay club scene to become more centralised in Vauxhall, turning it into an alternative destination from Soho for gay people to socialise. Vauxhall has also become colloquially known as &quot;Voho&quot; (a portmanteau of the names Vauxhall and Soho) within the gay community, due to the emergence of Vauxhall as a gay village after Soho.

Entertainment in the Vauxhall area is not exclusively aimed at gay clientele; the oldest strip pub in London (the Queen Anne) sitting at Vauxhall Walk has now closed to be replaced with The Tea House Theatre, a 1940s-themed tea room.

==Features==
By Vauxhall Bridge stands the central headquarters of the British Secret Intelligence Service (more commonly referred to as MI6), which occupies offices built between 1989 and 1992 and commonly referred to as Vauxhall Cross. Since 1992, a large complex of apartments and offices has been built to the south of Vauxhall Bridge at St George Wharf. Part of this development includes the St George Wharf Tower, completed in 2014.

The MI6 building has featured in several James Bond films, initially filmed without permission, but then condoned by then Foreign Secretary Robin Cook with his memorable &quot;After all James Bond has done for Britain...&quot; quip. It appears in &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; (wherein it suffers a fictional terrorist attack that prefigured a genuine incident), &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, &quot;Skyfall&quot; (where it also comes under a fictional terrorist attack), and &quot;Spectre&quot; (2015) (wherein it is demolished). &quot;Die Another Day&quot; featured a fictional London Underground station, Vauxhall Cross, a fictional closed stop on the Piccadilly line now employed by MI6 as an extension to its HQ. (In fact, the Piccadilly line does not come south of the river at all; only the Victoria line passes anywhere nearby, and the secret entrance to the station shown in the film is on the east side of Westminster Bridge, some considerable distance downriver.)

Vauxhall is also home to Brunswick House, a listed Georgian mansion and former home to the Dukes of Brunswick. Built in 1758, it once stood in three acres of riverside parkland; now it sits overshadowed by the St George Wharf complex. The building was in a state of disrepair and was on the English Heritage &#x27;Buildings at Risk&#x27; list until the London Architectural Salvage and Supply Company acquired it in 2004 and restored it as a premises from which to sell architectural salvage. It also has a restaurant and is an events venue.

St Peter&#x27;s Church, Vauxhall in Kennington Lane
was designed by the 19th-century architect John Loughborough Pearson, who also designed Truro Cathedral and St John&#x27;s Cathedral, Brisbane in Australia, as well as being responsible for restoration work at Rochester, Bristol, Peterborough, and Lincoln cathedrals. , the church building serves as a community centre and arts venue, as well as a church. Next to St Peter&#x27;s is Vauxhall City Farm.

==Transport==
Vauxhall is well connected even by central London standards. London Underground, National Rail trains, and London buses are all available at Vauxhall station. The tube stop is on the boundary of zones 1 and 2 of the London Travelcard area on the Victoria line, and Northern line stations are within walking distance of many parts of Vauxhall, though the nearest is Nine Elms. The railway station is served by South Western Railway to and from London Waterloo, which is one stop away. Vauxhall bus station has 14 routes serving various parts of London. There is also a river bus service operated by Thames Clippers at Vauxhall (St George Wharf) Pier, enabling passengers to travel east to Greenwich and Barking, or west to Putney.

Vauxhall is one of London&#x27;s most well-connected transport hubs, as the availability of underground, trains, and buses has given Vauxhall the highest possible PTAL rating of 6b at its centre.

In addition to public transport, Vauxhall is accessible by major roads and the Thames Path pedestrian and bicycle trail. Vauxhall also has two 17-space Santander Cycles docking stations and Cycle Superhighway 7 runs through the area.

===Vauxhall Cross===

Vauxhall Cross is immediately to the southeast of Vauxhall Bridge, where six major roads converge, including the Albert Embankment, which exits the Cross to the north and is the southernmost point of entry into the London congestion charge area. Vauxhall Cross was once described as &quot;one of the most unpleasant road junctions in South London&quot; in Nikolaus Pevsner&#x27;s 1983 architectural guide to South London. Vauxhall Cross has since improved after a gradual redesign between 2002 and 2004, to accommodate a bus interchange linked to the Vauxhall mainline railway and tube stations, both of which are located to the southeastern end of the Cross.

Work has involved design changes to traffic lanes, improved pedestrian and cycle crossings, refurbishment of walkways beneath the mainline railway viaduct, and the construction of a bus station, completed in December 2004 featuring an undulating steel-frame canopy and ribbed steel walls. An interesting feature of the canopy is a series of photoelectric cells generating electricity to offset the energy used by the bus station.

Vauxhall Cross bus station will be redeveloped to create a new mixed-use development consisting of offices, hotels, and shopping areas. The project will be managed by Great Marlborough Estates and has an apparent budget of £600 million, and is estimated to make the developers over £45 million. Public consultation took place in 2016 but the project has been delayed.

==Community facilities==
Vauxhall Park contains an area of miniature model houses (also in Fitzroy Gardens, Melbourne) as well as tennis courts, day care in the &quot;one o&#x27;clock club&quot;, and children&#x27;s playground. It is open daily for recreation and has an &quot;open day&quot; once a year.

Vauxhall City Farm, located within Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens is open daily and contains a range of animals including alpacas, sheep, goats and pigs.

Vauxhall is the home of Vauxhall Gardens Estate Residents and Tenants Association (VGERTA) that represents 2,500 residents in Vauxhall Gardens Estate which is the biggest Presidents and Tenants Association in Lambeth. VGERTA and their committee has received a number of awards for their contributions to the local community. VGERTA&#x27;s biggest success to date is the fundraising of £165,000 for the full regeneration of the Glasshouse Walk Playground that was successfully completed in July 2013.

<text>Waddon () is a neighbourhood in the London Borough of Croydon, at the western end of the town of Croydon. The area borders the London Borough of Sutton.

==History==
It is not known when the manor of Croydon was granted to the See of Canterbury, but it is thought of be before then end of the 9th century. The archbishop had lands in Croydon about 871. The Domesday Book of 1086 shows it as part of the archbishop&#x27;s lands held in demesne (for his own use). After a royal grant in the 13th century, Croydon became a market town. In 1276 Archbishop Robert Kilwardby obtained a grant of market in 1276. It was to be held every Friday and a nine-day fair was to be held on the vigil of St. Botolph the abbot (17 June). Waddon&#x27;s name was first recorded in the twelfth century and derives from Old English meaning &#x27;the hill where woad grows, or is grown&#x27;. Evidence of Bronze Age and Iron Age habitation have been found locally. Waddon has an older area with 19th-century properties, some even older, close to central Croydon. Further south is a large estate of Council-owned and former Council-owned homes and a small number of tower blocks. In the inter-war years Waddon had the most Croydon Corporation owned homes in Croydon with 1,125 council houses and 80 council flats.

The geographical area of Waddon extends further north than the political boundary of Waddon ward. Located in the Wandle river valley, one of the river&#x27;s sources, Waddon Ponds, is a public open space. The Wandle has been deculverted in Wandle Park and in the New South Quarter development. Wandle Park, opened in 1890, has benefited from the Town and Country Planning Act 1990&#x27;s Section 106 monies paid by property developers of the New South Quarter which have been used to refurbish the park. The River Bourne once flowed above ground through the South Mead, now Southbridge Road, and along Old Town where it joined the River Wandle. From the Middle Ages the Waddon Court Estate covered much of the area. Mills operated on the River Wandle which was used later to irrigate watercress beds as well as feed the lakes of Waddon Court.

The first incarnation of the Hare and Hounds public house opened in 1773, on what was then Waddon Marsh Lane. In the latter years of the 18th century Waddon Court&#x27;s owner, John Dewye Parker, raised a volunteer corps of yeomen here, at his own expense, and &quot;military evolutions were performed with the utmost precision, upon the lawn surrounding his mansion.&quot;

The Old Tithe Barn tithe barn was part of Waddon Court with the building opposite the Waddon Leisure Centre dating back to 1799. The building was later used as a barn within Coldharbour Farm. It was listed in 1990 and until 2007 was used by the now closed Grants Solicitors, the practice of the former Justice minister and MP for Maidstone &amp; The Weald, Helen Grant. In August 2017 the local authority gave planning permission for the barn to be used for religious worship with the successful applicant being the O Farinloye Kingdom Heritage Christian Fellowship.

Waddon has a long history of industrial trades. The Croydon gasworks were built on Waddon Marsh in 1867. An electricity generating station opened in 1896. The opening of the Purley Way in 1925 prompted the building of a number of factories including for Redwing Aircraft Ltd., Trojan Ltd. (car manufacturers), Tizer Ltd, Standard Steel Co., Croydon Foundry Ltd. (1920), Metal Propellers Ltd., (1925) and Southern Foundries Ltd. (1926). Croydon Corporation built the Waddon pumping station in 1910–11 on the road now called Waddon Way.

A second power station – Croydon B – opened in 1950 eliminating the first of the watercress beds. First commissioned in 1947 and built by Croydon Corporation the power station was nationalised by the then Labour government.

Duppas Hill Terrace hosts the Elis David Almshouses, built in 1974 and officially opened on 25 March 1975 by Princess Alexandra. These almshouses replaced the original almshouses in Church Street and the Henry Smith 1896 almshouse in Scarbrook Road. The Elis David charity was founded in perpetuity by Elias Davy on 27 April 1447. The current site of the almshouses was previously that of Croydon&#x27;s workhouse.

Duppas Hill was Croydon&#x27;s first recreation ground. Croydon Board of Health bought land from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for £2,000 in 1865. The Whitgift Foundation state that the clay and bricks for the Whitgift almshouses came from Duppas Hill after Park Hill, Croydon bricks proved to be inferior. The timber for the Whitfgift almshouses came from Waddon ward&#x27;s Haling Manor.

In 1931, Whitgift School moved to its current site in Haling Park, which was once home to Lord Howard of Effingham, the Lord High Admiral of the Fleet sent against the Spanish Armada.

St George&#x27;s Church was built in the heart of the Waddon housing estate, being erected in 1932. The architects were W. Curtis Green, R.A. and Partners. With a capacity for 339 parishioners the structure cost £5,580 and the fittings, fees and other outgoings cost £1,307. Dressed in Portland stone and with a timber roof covered with tiles.

The former Croydon Airport is in south-west Waddon. The aerodrome was established in December 1915 for the defence of London. Land to the east of Plough Lane was requisitioned for testing by the National Aircraft Factory No.1 and was known as Waddon Aerodrome. In 1920 the Beddington and Waddon aerodromes became the main customs airport for London.

The international distress term &quot;Mayday&quot; was invented at Waddon&#x27;s Croydon Airport. It was Croydon Airport senior radio officer Frederick Stanley Mockford (1897 – 1 March 1962) who was the originator of the uniform international distress signal.

The local community consequently suffered badly in traffic from a different European location in the Blitz bombing raids in World War II. An attack on 15 August 1940 marked the first civilian bombing with 62 civilian fatalities and 185 injured outside the airport. In addition two civilian telephone operators were injured.

Land and existing buildings in this area may be found to be subject to 20th century restrictive covenants preventing new construction above a certain height due to the proximity of the former airport, but those restrictions ought to be redundant by now, given that the airport has long since gone. The last commercial flight from the airport was in 1959. The imposing hotel which used to serve the airport remains to this day.

The South London Pirates are one of the most successful teams in the British Baseball Federation, playing at Roundshaw, on part of the old airport.

Running through Waddon, from Purley to the western reaches of Thornton Heath, is the Purley Way, the A23, home to many superstores and light industrial units. A bypass road was first mooted in 1908 with the corporation&#x27;s Roads Committee putting forward a full Thornton Heath to Purley relief road proposal in June 1911. Work commenced after the Great War in 1919 with the official opening in 1925. In 1932 the southern section of Purley Way was the first highway to benefit from sodium street lighting. The whole stretch benefitted from such lighting by 1936 with lights often strung over the centre of the highway.

Transport for London (TfL) consulted on altering junctions at Fiveways and at Croydon Road to improve traffic flows but COVID impacts on budgets have delayed any improvement.

Croydon council have undertaken consultations on allowing over 7,000 homes to be built along the Purley Way from Waddon Way to Broad Green, subject to investment at Fiveways and other local infrastructure.

The Purley Way saw an Art Deco building in the late 1930s at 606, Purley Way for cardboard packager Acme Corrugated Paper &amp; Box. Co. Ltd.

Waddon&#x27;s Purley Way also hosts the Waddon Leisure Centre at Fiveways junction with recently built facilities that include a 65 station gym, a 25-metre swimming pool, a learner pool, a sports hall, a cafe and 30 parking spaces. The new development was built on the site of the 1936-constructed public house &quot;The Propeller Inn&quot;, a Barclay Perkins brewery interest. Demolished in 2006 the place had been a favourite with wartime RAF personnel at the airfield up the road.

Waddon has had two other swimming facilities on the Purley Way in the past. The open-air Purley Way Swimming Pool opened on 27 July 1935 and except for the war period was open until 1975. The diving platforms are retained within the site. In part replacement for these closed pools and those at Scarbrook Road in Old Town a &quot;Water Palace&quot; facility was built on Metropolitan Open Land opposite the old airport for the Conservative council and opened in 1990. Including wave machines the facility was closed by the first Labour-led council in 1996, citing dangerous and uneconomic conditions (a £500,000 a year loss) and dismissing Conservative accusations of an anti-south of the borough outlook. The district auditor criticised the closure decision as &quot;poor value for money.&quot; The Highways Agency opposition slowed the sale of the site to the private sector.

The Water Palace site was replaced by the Colonnades shopping, food, sports club and bus terminal centre.

Waddon railway station is on the line between West Croydon railway station and Epsom Downs and Sutton. Waddon railway station opened on the Epsom branch of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1863. and was originally placed to the east of its current location. There are Tramlink stops at Waddon Marsh and Wandle Park. Opened in 2000 the tram greatly improved ease of access to Croydon compared to the poorly patronised Southern Railway line to Wimbledon.

The Waddon Hotel was built next to the original Waddon rail station with both buildings at that time situated in a rural environment. In 1928 opposite the hotel the Stafford Parade was completed and boasted a dairy, a grocery, a chemist&#x27;s, a butcher&#x27;s, a café and two banks.

Richardson&#x27;s Joinery used to be by the pillars at the entry into The Waldrons. Victoria Place off Southbridge Place was replaced by Victoria House where Croydon&#x27;s Educational Psychological Service and a Pupil Referral Unit was based. The site that became unused now has an Avanti primary school based on a Hindu faith ethos.

==Politics==
Politically, Waddon ward is a marginal ward on Croydon Council and has seen its representation swap between the Labour, Conservative and Ratepayers Parties since the late 1920s. With elections every year Labour took Waddon in 1929 and in 1937 and 1938 with RA candidates winning in the intervening years and also continuously from 1919 to 1928.

The first elections to the new London Borough of Croydon council in 1964 saw all three seats go to Labour. The Conservatives secured all three Waddon seats in the 1968 landslide for the Conservatives in London. 1971 saw Labour take all three seats back. 1974 saw Labour hold two of the three seats but there were Waddon by-election wins for the Conservatives both in 1976 and 1977 electing Councillors Jim Nea and Michael Wunn respectively.

In 1986, the ward representation was shared between the Conservatives with two councillors and Labour one councillor after the Conservatives had held all the seats both in 1978 and in the 1982 Conservative landslide when the only five seats held by Labour were in New Addington.

In 1990 and 1994, Labour won all three seats with the Conservatives falling to third place in an August 1993 by-election. In 1998, the ward returned one Labour and two Conservative councillors, one of whom defected to the Liberal Democrats.

In 2002, Labour recovered all three seats, albeit with one of the Labour candidates crossing the winning line with a majority of just eight votes. In the 2006 elections, Waddon returned three Conservative councillors. In 2010 the three Waddon council seats were retained by the Conservatives with Labour scoring its lowest vote share - 31.8% - during the existence of the post 1964 London Borough to Croydon. In 2014 the ward returned three Labour councillors, Robert Canning, Andrew Pelling &amp; Joy Prince on a swing from the Conservatives to Labour of 7.1%. 2018 saw Labour retaining the three seats with an increased majority on the altered boundaries as detailed below.

In 2022 Labour held two of the three seats as it shed 2,035 votes. The other seat was taken by the Conservatives. The setback for Labour came after the financial collapse of the Labour council, none of the incumbent Labour councillors running again except that Andrew Pelling ran as an Independent. Pelling had been terminated as a Labour member for being pro having a Croydon Mayor, for speaking to the local press and for voting against a cut to council tax benefit. His 705 votes made it hard for either party to get all three party candidates elected.
In July 2017, the Local Government Boundary Commission for England altered, subject to the formality of Parliamentary approval, the boundaries of the ward as from May 2018 so as to exclude roads including and surrounding Pampisford Road and Haling Park Road to the south of Whitgift School and to include some additional parts of what is geographically Waddon including retail and industrial areas to the south of Beddington Park Road, Wandle Park tramstop, the gasometers at Factory Lane, New South Quarter, Waddon Marsh tramstop, Wandle Park and properties between Wandle Park and the Roman Way.

<text>Brent () is a borough in north-west London, England. It is known for landmarks such as Wembley Stadium, the Swaminarayan Temple and the Kiln Theatre. It also contains the Welsh Harp reservoir and the Park Royal commercial estate. The local authority is Brent London Borough Council.

Brent&#x27;s population was estimated to be 339,800 as at 2021. Major districts are Kilburn, Willesden, Wembley and Harlesden, with sub-districts Stonebridge, Kingsbury, Kensal Green, Neasden, and Queen&#x27;s Park. Brent has a mixture of residential, industrial and commercial land. It includes many districts of inner-city character in the east and a more distinct suburban character in the west, part of which formed part of the early 20th century Metroland developments.

==Local government==
===Administrative history===

The London Borough of Brent was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, covering the combined area of the former Municipal Borough of Wembley and the Municipal Borough of Willesden. The area was transferred from Middlesex to Greater London to become one of the 32 London Boroughs.

The borough of Willesden had evolved from a local government district created in 1874 for the parish of Willesden. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894.

To coincide with the 1894 Act coming into force, an urban district called Wembley was created, covering the two parishes of Kingsbury and Wembley, the latter being created at the same time from areas formerly in the ancient parish of Harrow on the Hill. Kingsbury seceded from the Wembley Urban District in 1900 to become its own urban district, but was reunited with the Wembley Urban District in 1934. Willesden was incorporated to become a municipal borough in 1933, as was Wembley in 1937.

The modern borough takes its name from the River Brent which runs through the borough and separated the former boroughs of Wembley and Willesden.

==Governance==

The local authority is Brent Council, which is based at Brent Civic Centre in the Wembley Park area of the borough.

===Greater London representation===
Since 2000, for elections to the London Assembly, the borough forms part of the Brent and Harrow constituency.

===UK Parliament===
The borough has two parliamentary constituencies: Brent East and Brent West. These were created by the 2023 periodic review of Westminster constituencies, superseding the three previous constituencies of Brent North, Brent Central and Hampstead and Kilburn, which included part of the London Borough of Camden. Before the 2010 United Kingdom general election it was divided into three constituencies contained wholly within the borough – Brent South, Brent East and Brent North.

==Demographics==

In 1801, the civil parishes that form the modern borough had a total population of 2,022. This rose slowly throughout the nineteenth century, as the district became built up; reaching 5,646 in the middle of the century. When the railways arrived the rate of population growth increased. The population took five decades to rebound to the more muted peak of the 1950s, when much industry relocated from London, further boosting the speed of the wave of new housing then built.

Brent is the most diverse locality in the UK by country of birth. It in 2019 became the only local authority with over 50% of residents, namely 52%, born abroad. Large Asian and Indian, Black African, Black Caribbean, Irish, and Eastern European communities exist. 45 per cent of the population was a minority ethnicity in the 1991 census, the most in England at the time. In 1991 17.2% were Indian, 10.2% were Black Caribbean and 9% were Irish. Brent was the only Outer London borough combining high proportions of Indian and Afro-Caribbean ethnicities.

The 2001 UK Census found that the borough had a population of 263,464 residents, of whom 127,806 were male, and 135,658 female. Of those stating a choice, 47.71% described themselves as Christian, 17.71% as Hindu, 12.26% as Muslim and 10% as having no religion. Among residents, 39.96% were in full-time employment and 7.86% in part-time employment – compared to a London average of 42.64% and 8.62%, respectively. Narrowly most residents included an owner-occupier in their household, with 23.17% of households owning their house outright, and a further 31.33% owning with a mortgage. 10.59% were in local authority housing, with a further 13.29% renting from a housing association, or other registered social landlord.

The 2021 census found that the borough has England and Wales&#x27;s lowest proportion of people born in the UK, at 43.9%.

The borough of Brent is extremely ethnically diverse, having changed greatly since 1951. In the 2011 census, those who identified as White British made up 18% of the borough&#x27;s population. 18% identified as other White, 5% were of mixed heritage, those of South Asian heritage comprised about 33%, those of African and Caribbean heritage about 19%, and other ethnic groups about 7%. White ethnicities were relatively high in the wards of Mapesbury (straddling Willesden Green and Cricklewood), Brondesbury Park, Queen&#x27;s Park and Kilburn. Black ethnicities in highest proportion were in Stonebridge, Harlesden and Kensal Green wards. Asian ethnicities in highest proportion were in the wards of Alperton, Wembley Central and Kenton. Those who ethnically identify as BAME (Black, Asian and minority Ethnic) was as high as 86% in Wembley Central – one of the highest in London – and most other Brent wards have a majority BAME population. Queen&#x27;s Park had the lowest BAME proportion, at 37.0%.

Brent has the highest proportion of Irish residents in Britain, with 4% of the population. It also has the largest Brazilian community in the UK; one of the largest Indian communities; a significant Afro-Caribbean community; and more recent Romanian, Polish and Somali communities.

The 2021 census showed that 1.3% of adults in Brent identified as transgender, derived from the Census question, &quot;Is the gender you identify with the same as your sex registered at birth?&quot;. This gave Brent the second highest proportion of transgender adults after the Borough of Newham (at 1.5%). The overall proportion in England and Wales was 0.5% with Brighton, an area well known for its LGBT communities, 1%. However, Prof Michael Biggs of Oxford University showed there was a correlation between the proportion of transgender people in these areas and the proportion for whom English was not their first language (34% in Brent and 35% in Newham, compared to 9% nationally), suggesting the question was not fully understood by some. Prof Biggs described the figures as &quot;irredeemably flawed&quot;. In September 2024, Mary Gregory, a deputy director at the ONS said some people may have misunderstood the question, saying there was &quot;potential bias&quot; in how the question was answered &quot;by those who responded that they had lower levels of English proficiency, some of whom may have mistakenly given an answer suggesting they were trans&quot;. As a result, the ONS downgraded the data from &quot;accredited official statistics&quot; to &quot;official statistics in development&quot; to reflect the possible flaws.

===Religion===
As of 2011, 41.5% identified themselves as Christian, 18.6% Muslim, 17.8% Hindu and 10.6% with no religion. Brent is home of the Neasden Temple, once the largest Hindu Mandir outside India; and JFS, the largest Jewish school in Europe. There is also an Islamic school called Islamia Primary School founded by Cat Stevens.

The following table shows the religious identity of residents residing in Brent according to the 2001, 2011 and the 2021 censuses.

According to the House of Commons survey of female genital mutilation, in the year to 31 March 2016, Brent represented the highest number of attendees, by current residence or visiting location, to medical services, at 1,250, 545 more than the next-highest local authority, Bristol.

Diageo has its head office in Park Royal and in Brent, on a former Guinness brewery property. The brewery was closed in 2004; it had produced beer since 1936. Diageo planned to move its head office to Brent from Central London when the lease on the Central London office expired in 2010.

According to legend, Pierre Wibaux&#x27;s cowboys surrounded the town of Mingusville, and wouldn&#x27;t let anyone enter or leave town unless they signed a petition changing the name of the town to Wibaux.

<doc id="94358" wikidata="Q2321784" url="?curid=94358" title="Walthamstow">
<text>Walthamstow ( or ) is a town within the London Borough of Waltham Forest in east London. The town borders Chingford to the north, Snaresbrook and South Woodford to the east, Leyton and Leytonstone to the south, and Tottenham to the west. At the 2011 census, Walthamstow had a population of approximately 109,424 and is around 
north-east of Central London. 

Occupying most of the town&#x27;s east-to-west High Street, Walthamstow Market is the longest outdoor market in Europe. East of the town centre is Walthamstow Village, the oldest part of Walthamstow, and the location of St Mary&#x27;s Church, the town&#x27;s parish church. To the north of the town is the former Walthamstow Stadium, which was considered an East End landmark. The William Morris Gallery in Forest Road, a museum that was once the family home of William Morris, is a Grade II* listed building. The town is served by five railway stations, including Walthamstow Central and Blackhorse Road—interchange stations on the Victoria line of the London Underground.

Walthamstow was a civil parish, originally part of the Becontree Hundred of Essex. As part of the suburban growth of London, the town expanded rapidly in the 19th century, becoming part of the urban area of the city. It has formed part of the Metropolitan Police District since 1840, and the London postal district since its inception in 1856. The parish became a local board district in 1873, an urban district in 1894 and a municipal borough in 1929. Following reform of local government in London in 1965, it merged with the municipal boroughs of Chingford and Leyton to form the new Waltham Forest local authority district, becoming part of Greater London. The borough council is based at Waltham Forest Town Hall on Forest Road.

==History==
===Toponymy===
Walthamstow is recorded as &quot;Wilcumestowe&quot; (&quot;the Place of Welcome&quot;) and in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Wilcumestou&quot;.

===Early history===

The Domesday Book describes Wilcumestou as a manor owned by the Anglo-Saxon nobleman Earl Waltheof of Huntingdon and Northumbria before the Norman conquest of 1066. After the execution of Earl Waltheof, the property of the land passed to his wife, Countess Judith, also known as Judith of Lens, a niece of William the Conqueror. The Domesday Book records 36 villeins, 25 bordars and 4 slaves living in the manor in 1086. Alice, daughter of Earl Waltheof and Countess Judith, inherited Walthamstow. She married the Norman nobleman Ralph de Tosny or Toeni (also known as Raoul IV de Conches) in 1103. When her husband died, , Alice gave the church of Walthamstow to the Priors of the Holy Trinity based in Aldgate, London.

King John stayed in Walthamstow for two nights in February 1208.

In the 1660s Sir William Batten, Surveyor of the Navy, and his wife Elizabeth Woodcocke had a house in Wood Street where, according to Samuel Pepys, Batten lived &quot;like a prince&quot; and cultivated a vineyard. The Vestry House, now the Vestry House Museum, was used as the first town hall.

The influential textile designer and craftsman William Morris was born in Walthamstow in 1834. The Georgian mansion where he lived as a teenager houses the William Morris Gallery. By 1870 Walthamstow had grown to the size of a small suburb and a new town hall was built in Orford Road from which affairs of the village were run. A new town hall designed by architect Philip Dalton Hepworth in the Nordic Classical style was built between 1938 and 1942.

===Urban development===

Until the late 19th century Walthamstow was largely rural, with a small village centre (now Walthamstow Village) and a number of large estates. The main route through the district was Hoe Street. There were various smaller lanes crossing the town. The road now known as Forest Road was originally called Clay Street. Further south, the High Street was named Marsh Street, and led from the original settlement out to the marshes. Shernhall Street is an ancient route, as is Wood Street, to the east.

With the advent of the railways and the ensuing suburbanisation in the late 19th century, Walthamstow experienced a large growth in population and speculative building.

The Lighthouse Methodist Church which dates from 1893 is situated on Markhouse Road, on the corner of Downsfield Road. There is a lantern at the top of the tower, which also contains a spiral staircase. The church was erected because of the generosity of Captain David King of the shipbuilding firm of Bullard King &amp; Co which also ran the Natal Direct Shipping Line, which ran ships direct from London to Durban without stopping at the Cape.

===Transport breakthroughs===

In 1885, John Kemp Starley, originally from Church Hill in Walthamstow, designed the first modern bicycle, and in 1892, Frederick Bremer built the first British motorcar in a workshop in his garden, at Connaught Road. The vehicle is on display at the Vestry House Museum in Walthamstow.

The LGOC X-type and B-type buses were built at Blackhorse Lane from October 1908 onwards. The B-type is considered one of the first mass-production buses. The manufacturing operation later became AEC, famous as the manufacturer of many of London&#x27;s buses. On 13 June 1909, A. V. Roe&#x27;s aircraft took to the air from Walthamstow Marshes. It was the first all-British aircraft and was given the ominous nickname of the &quot;Yellow Terror&quot; but officially carried the name Avro1. Roe later founded the Avro aircraft company, which later built the acclaimed Avro Lancaster.

===Walthamstow Power Station===

&quot;Walthamstow Borough Corporation&quot; had been authorised in 1904 to supply electricity to the Borough. The power station in Exeter Street had three brick chimneys and an array of wooden cooling towers. In 1923 the revenue to the Borough from sales of electricity was £109,909. Upon nationalisation of the electricity industry in 1948 ownership of the station passed to the British Electricity Authority and later to the Central Electricity Generating Board. The CEGB closed the station in 1967 when the thermal efficiency was 9.30 per cent. It was subsequently demolished.

===Local government===
From 1894 the Municipal Borough of Walthamstow was an urban district and from 1929 a municipal borough in Essex. In 1931 the population of the borough, covering an area of , peaked at 132,972. In 1965 the borough was abolished and its former area merged with that of the Municipal Borough of Chingford and the Municipal Borough of Leyton to form the London Borough of Waltham Forest in Greater London. Other places in east London formerly of the county of Essex, such as Ilford and Romford were placed into London Boroughs along with Walthamstow. None of the postal district names or codes was changed at this time (e.g. Ilford remained Ilford, Essex IG1-IG6 and Walthamstow remained 

===Post-war history===

Since the 2012 Summer Olympics, the town has become increasingly popular mostly as a result of gentrification. Local property prices increased at a high rate of 22.3% from 2013 to 2014, compared to London&#x27;s average of 17.8%. It has turned Walthamstow into a &#x27;trendy&#x27; town similar to Shoreditch. The leafy Walthamstow Village in particular has become sought-after by buyers.

On 29 May 2015, a regular local unicyclist was hit and dragged under by a double decker route 212 bus in Hoe Street. Locals numbering up to 100 people helped to pull the bus off the unicyclist. The MP for Walthamstow, Stella Creasy, later said she was &quot;proud&quot; of the community for saving the unicyclist&#x27;s life.

==Governance==
Walthamstow elects councillors to Waltham Forest London Borough Council. It is within the Walthamstow parliamentary constituency.

Walthamstow is bordered to the north by Chingford and to the south by Leyton and Leytonstone. Woodford lies to the east with a boundary running through Epping Forest, Hackney lies to the south-west beyond the Walthamstow Marshes and the Lea, while Tottenham is situated westward on the far side of the River Lea and the Lee Valley Reservoir Chain. The A112 (Leyton High Road, Hoe Street, Chingford Road, Chingford Mount Rd) passes south–north through Walthamstow and its neighbouring towns forming part of an ancient route from London to Waltham Abbey. Walthamstow is situated south of the North Circular Road. 
Walthamstow Central is the main transport hub.

Walthamstow Village conservation area is a district to the east of what has become the commercial centre of Walthamstow. The area is roughly defined as being south of Church Hill, west of Shernhall Street, north of Grove Road, and east of Hoe Street. Orford Road is the main route through the district, though even this is a quiet thoroughfare by the standards of London. The village has a small selection of specialist shops, pubs and restaurants, and house prices tend to be higher in the streets of this neighbourhood. It was voted best urban village in London by &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine in 2004.

&quot;Upper Walthamstow&quot; is to the east of Walthamstow Village. The area&#x27;s main thoroughfare is Wood Street, which has several shops and local businesses, and is served by the London Overground at Wood Street station on the Liverpool Street to Chingford line.

One of the Great Trees of London, the Wood Street Horse Chestnut, is located next to the former Jones&#x27;s Butchers Shop, a grade II listed, late 18th century weatherboarded building. The tree is thought to be upwards of 175 years old.

Wood Street is home to Wood Street Indoor Market. The market was the site of a cinema from 1912 to 1955, operated by the Penny Picture Theatre Co. It re-opened under new independent management in 1953 as the Rio Cinema, but this was short lived and it closed in 1955. Now the market is filled with quirky market traders, and was documented in a short documentary made by Mark Windows.

Walthamstow has a wide variety of housing stock, but the vast majority of residential property was built in the early 20th century. From Coppermill Lane in the west (next to the marshes), to Wood Street in the east, there are thousands of terraced streets dating to the Edwardian era and the 1920s. The area along Markhouse Road and St James Street has many examples of Warner properties. These were developed as affordable housing for the working classes in the early part of the 20th century. Bombing raids in the Second World War and urban redevelopment projects in the 1960s and 1970s have left areas with more modern housing, mostly in the shape of low-rise concrete blocks.

The northern continuation of Markhouse Road is St James&#x27;s Street to which Blackhorse Road follows, served by underground and railway stations, which in turn becomes Blackhorse Lane. This is bound on its western side by industrial units and warehouses. The London Borough of Waltham Forest has proposed developing the area around Blackhorse Road railway station to become a gateway to the town.

Although bounded by the marshes to the west and parts of Epping Forest to the east, there is little open space in the actual town. There used to be two commons in the town, Church Common, adjacent to St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Walthamstow Village and Markhouse Common, located off Markhouse Lane (now Markhouse Road) and what is now the western end of Queens Road. Both open spaces were lost in the 19th century, when the land was sold to property developers. Lloyd Park has been open to the public since 1900 and is located on Forest Road behind the William Morris Gallery. It has a formal garden with a pond, and the adjacent Aveling Field has facilities for bowling, tennis, basketball, an outdoor gym, a skate park and a children&#x27;s play area.

==Demography==
Walthamstow roughly approximates to seven of the electoral wards within the London Borough of Waltham Forest: Chapel End (northeastern part), Higham Hill (northwestern part), High Street (western), Hoe Street (inner-eastern and Walthamstow Village), Markhouse (southwestern), William Morris (northern), and Wood Street (eastern and &quot;Upper Walthamstow&quot;). The 2011 census counted a total population of 109,424 of all these wards combined.

As of the 2011 census, White British is the largest ethnicity in all wards. Other White is the second largest in all wards except Markhouse. The other double-digit ethnicities are Pakistani and Black African. The minority ethnic proportion ranges from 48.5% in Chapel End to 58.2% in Markhouse.

The male life expectancy ranged from 77.2 years in Hoe Street to 82.1 years in Chapel End; the female life expectancy ranged from 82.1 years in both Higham Hill and Hoe Street to 84.8 years in High Street. This data covers 2009–2013.

The median house price as of 2014 was highest in Wood Street ward (£387,500) and lowest in Markhouse ward (£324,000).

==Economy==

The High Street is dominated by Walthamstow Market, which began in 1885, and occupies all but the last 100 yards of the street. It is reputed to be a mile long, but in fact measures approximately ⅔ of a mile. It is the longest street market in Europe. The market is open five days a week (not Sunday or Monday), and there is a Sunday farmers&#x27; market. The street is lined with shops: a selection of high street chains, but also many independent small shops specialising in food, fabrics, and household goods, as well as cafés. There are two patches of more recent development: Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket and the covered shopping centre 17&amp;Central (originally Selborne Walk, then The Mall Walthamstow, badly damaged by a fire in 2019 and fully restored) both of which have large multi-storey car parks. 

The historic central library on the High Street was one of many built with money donated by the Scottish-American businessman and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, whose portrait bust can be seen on the exterior of the building. The library was damaged by a fire in 1982 but modernised and expanded in 2006–07. At the same time, a large plot at the corner of High Street and Hoe Street was set for substantial redevelopment as a retail space. This site was previously the location of the town&#x27;s central post office and a shopping arcade built in the 1960s. Plans for the redevelopment of this site initially fell through in 2005, but work on a new cinema, flats and restaurants started in April 2013 and was completed in December 2014. As of 2024, there is current refurbishment of the town square and new homes adjacent to the 17&amp;Central shopping centre which is being extended.

The &quot;Walthamstow Beer Mile&quot;, also known as the &quot;Blackhorse Beer Mile&quot;, is an attraction consisting of a growing number of micro-breweries, and their associated tap-rooms, in and around Blackhorse Road and Blackhorse Lane.

=== Road ===
Several arterial routes pass through Walthamstow which link the district to other areas in London and the East of England.

To the north, the A406 (North Circular) runs east–west around Walthamstow. The road links the district to Ilford, the M11 (for Stansted Airport) and London City Airport to the east. To the west, the North Circular passes through Edmonton, Finchley and Brent Cross &quot;en route&quot; to Chiswick. The route meets the M1 and M4 motorways (for Luton and Heathrow airports).

==== Air pollution ====
The London Borough of Waltham Forest monitors kerbside and roadside Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) levels in Walthamstow.

To the north of Walthamstow, at the Crooked Billet Roundabout (North Circular), there is an automatic monitoring site which recorded an average NO2 concentration of 61.1μg/m3 (micrograms per cubic metre) in 2017. This fails to meet the UK National Air Quality Objective set by the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (DEFRA) at 40μg/m3.

Alternative roadside monitoring sites along Hoe Street and Selborne Road also failed to meet the UK National Air Quality Objective, with one diffusion tube on Selborne Road recording an annual average NO2 concentration of 61.0μg/m3.

=== Cycling ===
Transport for London (TfL) and the London Borough of Waltham Forest provide cycling infrastructure in Walthamstow. In 2014, cyclists made up approximately 8.41% of general traffic across the Borough, and in the same year, the Borough was awarded a &quot;Mini Holland&quot; grant by the Mayor of London to improve infrastructure and cycle routes across Walthamstow.

Cycling routes include:

*Quietway 2 – begins at Walthamstow Central and runs along low-traffic streets to Bloomsbury, via Walthamstow Marshes, Clapton, Hackney Central, Angel and Clerkenwell. The route is unbroken and signposted, but indirect.
*Lea Bridge Road Cycle Route – from Leytonstone to Clapton via Lea Bridge. The route runs on segregated cycle track parallel to the A104.
*Forest Road Cycle Route – from Walthamstow to Tottenham on cycle lanes and tracks adjacent to the A503.

The River Lea towpath is also nearby, which provides a direct, traffic-free cycle link from Walthamstow Marshes to Hackney Wick and Stratford to the south, and Tottenham Hale, Enfield Lock, Hertford and Harlow to the north. The towpath also carries National Cycle Route 1 (NCR 1), an unbroken, signposted cycle route from Dover to the Shetland Islands, which in North London carries cyclists from Canary Wharf to Enfield Lock via Victoria Park and Walthamstow Marshes. The route is a shared-use path maintained by the Canal and River Trust and Sustrans.

==Modern culture==
*Walthamstow was home to the popular 1990s boy band East 17, who named themselves after the area&#x27;s postal code E17, and titled their debut album &quot;Walthamstow&quot;.
*The artwork for Blur&#x27;s &quot;Parklife&quot; album featured photos of the band at Walthamstow Stadium.
*Singer Jimmy Ray grew up in the Lloyd Park area and attended Winns primary, and Sidney Chaplin and McEntee secondary schools. In the early 1990s he performed at various E17 venues, including the Royal Standard, as part of local pop group &#x27;The Cutting Room&#x27;. Ray later had solo hits in the UK and US. 
*Major centre in London&#x27;s grime music scene, with many bedroom studios and underground music enterprises. Artists include Lethal Bizzle and his band Fire Camp.
*The Bromheads Jacket song &quot;Poppy Bird&quot; references Walthamstow in the chorus.
*Small Wonder Records was located on Hoe Street in the late 70s and early 80s. It produced the first records by The Cure, Crass, Cockney Rejects, The Cravats and Bauhaus. The proprietor Pete Stenett closed the shop and label in 1982, but it was &#x27;rebuilt&#x27; further down Hoe Street for the 40th anniversary of E17 punk in 2016.
*Mentioned in the Paul McCartney and Wings song &quot;Old Siam, Sir&quot; from the 1979 album &quot;Back to the Egg&quot;.
*&quot;Long ago, outside a chip shop in Walthamstow&quot; is the first line of a song named &quot;Ann and Joe&quot;, recorded by The Barron Knights in the late 1970s. This was a spoof of &quot;Long ago, high on a mountain in Mexico&quot;, the opening words of Angelo, which was a UK number one hit in 1977 for Brotherhood of Man.
*&quot;Waiting in Walthamstow&quot; is a song by The Cranberries from the album &quot;Roses&quot;.
*The track the &quot;Battle of Epping Forest&quot; by Genesis on the album &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; has lyrics based in the area such as &quot;Along the Forest Road, there&#x27;s hundreds of cars – luxury cars.&quot;
*The indie rock band The Rifles and the rock band The Bevis Frond.
*Educating the East End was filmed at Frederick Bremer School as its third series of the Educating TV show; its series was filmed in the 2013-2014 academic year, with its series broadcasting in late 2014. 
===Street art===
Walthamstow&#x27;s links with William Morris and art have led to an increasing number of street art and murals painted on public buildings. Some examples of street art in Walthamstow are shown below:

===Cinema===
An early British film studio the Walthamstow Studios operated in the area between 1914 and 1930.

The EMD (Granada) Walthamstow (formerly the Granada) is a Grade II listed cinema building in Hoe Street. The cinema also operated as a live music venue, with concerts by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, John Coltrane, Little Richard, Gene Vincent, Jerry Lee Lewis, Alex Paterson, Johnny Cash, James Brown, The Who, Roy Orbison and Buddy Holly. It closed in 2003 when it was sold to the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God (UCKG), which sought permission for a change of use to a place of worship.

Many members of the local community opposed and successfully campaigned against the UCKG plans. Comedian and presenter Griff Rhys Jones, actor Paul McGann and writer Alain de Botton were among the famous names who backed local residents in asking the local authority to stop plans to convert the building into a church.

The Waltham Forest Film Society and Campaign to Save Our Cinema was the focal point for local campaigners.

UCKG failed to gain planning permission to convert the building from Waltham Forest Council and later from the then Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles. In 2014 the building was sold to a pub company who set up a bar in the grand foyer and began bringing it back into use as a venue. In 2019 Waltham Forest Council purchased the former auditorium with the intention of opening it as an entertainment venue in 2022.

The Empire cinema, a separate new multiplex, opened in December 2014 on Walthamstow market. It closed on 7 July 2023 when the chain went into administration. The cinema was subsequently badly damaged, and all the screens ripped, during an illegal rave in September 2023.

<text>Wallington is a town in the London Borough of Sutton, South London, England, south-west of Charing Cross. Before the Municipal Borough of Beddington and Wallington merged into the London Borough of Sutton in Greater London in 1965, it was part of the county of Surrey. Wallington is a post town in the SM postcode area.

== History ==
The name &quot;Wallington&quot; derives from the Anglo Saxon &quot;Waletone&quot;, meaning &quot;village of the Britons&quot;.
Wallington appears in Domesday Book of 1086 and was held by William the Conqueror. Its domesday assets were: 11 hides. It had 2 mills worth £1 10s 0d, 11 ploughs, of meadow. It rendered £10. The historic village was situated somewhat to the north of the current town centre around what is now Wallington Bridge over the River Wandle.

At the time of the Domesday book there were two mill ponds. The mill buildings have long been demolished, but the mill pond survives as The Grange boating lake. In the 1860s one Alfred Smee, surgeon to the Bank of England, constructed an elaborate garden on the north side of the Mill Pond, and wrote an illustrated book called &quot;My Garden&quot; in 1872.

What was then called &quot;Carshalton&quot; railway station was opened in 1847 in the open fields to the south of Wallington because the owner of Carshalton Park objected to it being built near to Carshalton village. This acted as a spur to the development of the area and in the 1860s Nathaniel Bridges created a prestigious housing estate of gothic revival villas (architect E. L. Brock). To provide a church for the estate, Bridges sponsored the construction of Holy Trinity, and Wallington became a separate parish in 1867. The area around Holy Trinity Church is known as Wallington Old Town. In particular Clifton Road, Belmont Road and Park Road exhibit some imposing Victorian and Edwardian villas. This southward development continued towards Woodcote and by the time of the First World War the section of Woodcote Road to the south of the station had become the new High Street.

Wallington High School for Girls was established in 1888 by a collective of nuns.
Wallington Methodist Church was built in 1908 on a site in Beddington Gardens in the town centre.

Since 1902 the town has maintained the tradition of an annual crowning of the &quot;Wallington May Queen&quot;. The event begins with a procession through the town. Girls join the group at the age of three as &quot;fairies&quot;, before graduating to &quot;attendants to the May Queen&quot; a year later. They then go on to become crown bearers before taking on the role of banner bearer. The girls then act as &quot;princes&quot;, and become eligible to be a May Queen at the age of nine.
The Municipal Borough of Beddington and Wallington was incorporated in 1936 from the former Beddington and Wallington Urban District. Wallington Town Hall (architect Robert Atkinson)
and public library were built in Wallington town centre in the 1930s, as was the fire station in Belmont Road.

Wallington County Grammar School (for boys) was opened on London Road, close to Beddington Park in 1927.
Wallington was an important centre for the production of lavender oil until about the time of the First World War. Lavender and herb growing were very prominent in the area in Victorian times and much earlier, and extensive fields of lavender were to be seen in the Carshalton, Beddington and Wallington areas. Lavender growing was a very prosperous part of the local agriculture hereabouts in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In Wallington the area to the north of the station was chiefly used. The scale of the operation can be understood from the fact that the Daily News in 1914 was able to state that at nearby Carshalton Beeches &quot;In every direction the low hill sides of the farm beyond Beeches Halt are swept with the bloomy pastel tint of the lavender flowers&quot;. The importance of lavender is remembered and commemorated in a number of ways, for example:

* There is a large sculpture at the junction of Woodcote Road and Stafford Road representing a lavender plant. Created by sculptor, Guy Portelli, it was installed in 1999 when the new Sainsbury&#x27;s store was built.
* The Christmas lights also represent lavender plants.
* One of the local lavender farmers – John Jakson of Little Woodcote Farm – lent his name to a public house in Woodcote Road.
* Local Scouts use lavender as the logo for the Sutton area on their shoulder badge.
Many of Wallington&#x27;s young men served and lost their lives in the First World War, and in 1922 a memorial was unveiled on Wallington Green by General Edmund Elles to commemorate the fallen. The memorial was altered in 1949 to include the names of the locals who died in the Second World War.

The memorial is in the form of a Portland stone obelisk on a plinth, with a cross and a sunburst motif. On the sides are bronze plaques bearing the names of the fallen. It stands on blue Staffordshire engineering bricks and York stone. In 2005 it was discovered that the memorial was being attacked by moss, and English Heritage paid for its restoration.

The inscription reads:

==Today==
Since 2007 new retailers have opened in Wallington, including Tesco Express and Caffè Nero. These were in addition to existing retailers including Sainsbury&#x27;s, Boots, W.H. Smith, banks, estate agencies and building societies.

There have been two developments of luxury flats opposite the railway station, which were completed circa 2010 and 2013 respectively. More town centre flats in Shotfield Road were completed in 2015.

A farmers&#x27; market is held on the second Saturday of each month. This is usually located outside the old town hall, but occasionally in the car park at Shotfield.

Sutton Community Farm, the only one of its kind in Greater London, is located in Wallington. A not-for-profit social enterprise, it occupies a 7.5 acre small-holding of a type originally given to ex-servicemen following the First World War.

There is a public library in the centre of Wallington in the &quot;Shotfield&quot; district; it has an outside terrace where coffee and tea are served. Shotfield is also where the former Town Hall, and now a college, is located. In 1980 it was taken over and converted into a Crown Court. The building ceased to be a Court in April 1999, and was later converted to its current use.

The town saw the opening of a small independent cinema in May 2014 at the Brook Cafe and Bar, along with a recording studio.

The Shotfield area of the town centre gained a modern new health centre in 2012, replacing smaller existing facilities on the site.

==Holy Trinity Church==
Wallington&#x27;s parish church is located on Manor Road, and dedicated to the Holy Trinity. It was designed by Habershon and Brock, and completed in 1870. It has been Grade II listed since 1974.

The ancient Chapel of Wallington stood on a site to the north of the London Road, behind the brewery in the grounds of the Elm Grove Estate, and was demolished about the year 1791. A deed dated 1480 gives the information that the dedication of the chapel was to Our Lady of the Moor. The foundations were discovered in 1921, and with them some carved stones which were parts of windows and arches. The remains of the vanished Chapel may be seen in the walls of the Church Hall in Elm Grove and the more recent Church of St. Patrick.

The present Church of Holy Trinity was erected in 1866 by Mr Nathaniel Bridges, Lord of the Manor. The Church was consecrated on 28 September 1867, by Bishop Sumner of Winchester. Like the rest of the historic county of Surrey, the parish of Wallington at that time was in the Diocese of Winchester. It was later transferred to Rochester, and when the current Anglican Diocese of Southwark was formed, it was transferred to it.

The church was built to resemble the description of the old chapel – after the style of the 14th century. The west window of the south aisle is similar to one in the Church of Little St. Mary&#x27;s Cambridge, which was erected about 1850. Each window has tracery of a different pattern. The stone used with the flints is Bath stone. The roof and floor are covered with Broseley tiles. The height of the spire is 110 feet. The interior of the church gives an area of 105 feet long by 75 feet broad, and gives sitting accommodation for 650 persons.

Since the Parish Church was built it has been adorned with several stained glass windows. Those on the south side are memorials to former worshippers. The central window in the chancel is a memorial to the Rev. John Williams, the first vicar. The north window was presented by the relatives as a memorial to those who fell in World War I, while that in the south side is a gift of the parishioners as a War Memorial.

In 1926 the chancel was entirely refurbished, with new Communion Hails – the gift of Mrs Bund, in memory of her husband; a new pulpit – the gift of Mr W. J. Mallinson; a brass eagle lectern – the gift of Mrs Cleverly; marble and alabaster baptismal font – the gift of Mrs Page; oak panelling in the chancel and sanctuary and new oak doors and vestibule at the south entrance – the gifts of members of the Landon family and Miss Roche; and new choir stalls (the cost of which was defrayed by subscriptions) were added to the Church.

==Open space==

Parks in the Wallington area include Mellows Park, Beddington Park and the Grange Gardens.

The latter two, through which the River Wandle flows, lie in the north-east of the area, on the border with neighbouring Beddington. Beddington Park is nearly 100 acres in size and is maintained by the London Borough of Sutton. It was originally part of the Deer Park attached to Carew Manor, a grand country house built in the Tudor period, which stands to this day. It comprises a large area of open grassland with small clumps of trees, with an area of more formal gardens near the Grange restaurant, as well as a lake and pond. The main lake in the south west of the park was originally a mill pond. There are many paths and a number of ornamental bridges, which cross the stream which feeds the lake: this is part of the River Wandle, and the park is on the Wandle Trail. Part of the park is managed as a wildlife site.

<doc id="94363" wikidata="Q1231883" url="?curid=94363" title="Walworth">
<text>Walworth ( ) is a district of South London, England, within the London Borough of Southwark. It adjoins Camberwell to the south and Elephant and Castle to the north, and is south-east of Charing Cross.

Major streets in Walworth include the Old Kent Road, New Kent Road and Walworth Road.

==History==
The name Walworth is probably derived from Old English &quot;Wealh&quot; &quot;Briton&quot; and the suffix &quot;-worth&quot; &quot;homestead&quot; or &quot;enclosure&quot; and, thus, &quot;British farm&quot;.

Walworth appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Waleorde&quot;. It was held by Bainiard from Archbishop Lanfranc of Canterbury. Its domesday assets were: 3½ hides; one church, four ploughs, of meadow. It rendered £3.
John Smith House is on Walworth Road, and was renamed in memory of John Smith, who was leader of the Labour Party from 1992 up to his sudden death in 1994. A former headquarters of the Labour Party, it was often seen in news reports at election times and in the background as people came and went from meetings of the Labour Party National Executive Committee. It was used by the London Borough of Southwark as the home for its education department and reopened in July 2012 as a hostel.

St Peter&#x27;s Church, Walworth, built circa 1825, is an excellent example of the neo-classical style of church built by Sir John Soane. It is an indication of the wealth of the middle-class merchants who then lived in the vicinity that they could afford an architect of such prominence.

Manor Place Baths is a former wash house in Manor Place off Walworth Road. It is a grade II listed building. The building was renovated by Kagyu Samye Dzong, Tibetan Buddhist Centre who obtained a five-year lease in 2005. They opened it as their London centre, called &quot;Manor Place Samye Dzong&quot; on 17 March 2007. Adjacent is the council&#x27;s old recycling depot which is now closed and has been replaced by a new facility at 43 Devon Street, off Old Kent Road.

Walworth is also home to the Pullens buildings - a mixture of Victorian live/work spaces and yards. Many of the flats are one bedroom, and some of the flats still connect to the Workshops of any of the three yards (Illife Yard, Peacock Yard and one other).

Walworth also used to have a zoo, in Royal Surrey Gardens, which was visited by Queen Victoria.

== Politics ==
Walworth Town Hall, previously the Vestry Hall of St Mary, Newington, became the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark and was renamed &quot;Southwark Town Hall&quot; in 1900. It reverted to the name &quot;Walworth Town Hall&quot; when it ceased to be the local seat of government after the enlarged London Borough of Southwark was formed in 1965.

== Regeneration ==
Large amounts of regeneration and gentrification are occurring in Walworth, including the demolition of the Elephant and Castle Shopping Centre, the newly built Strata tower, the demolition and regeneration of the Heygate and Aylesbury Estates, and redevelopment of St Mary&#x27;s Churchyard as a new park. The Bakerloo Line Extension is proposed with two new stations along Old Kent Road.

== Mentions in culture ==
The district of Walworth features in Charles Dickens’ &quot;Great Expectations&quot;; Mr Wemmick resides here in a small wooden cottage.

Walworth is featured in the 2016 novel by Stella Duffy, &quot;London Lies Beneath&quot;, set in 1912. It is also featured in the 2017 film &quot;The Foreigner&quot;, as the restaurant of the protagonist Ngoc Minh Quan is based in this district.

Enda Walsh&#x27;s 2006 play, &quot;The Walworth Farce,&quot; is set in a council flat near the Elephant &amp; Castle. A theme of the play is Irish migration and immigration. Walworth had been a centre for Irish immigration since the nineteenth century.

<text>Wandsworth Town () is a district of south London, within the London Borough of Wandsworth southwest of Charing Cross. The area is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London.

==Toponymy==
Wandsworth takes its name from the River Wandle, which enters the Thames at Wandsworth. Wandsworth appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Wandesorde&quot; and &quot;Wendelesorde&quot;. This means &#x27;enclosure of (a man named) Waendel&#x27;, whose name is also lent to the River Wandle. To distinguish it from the London Borough of Wandsworth, and historically from the Wandsworth District of the Metropolis and the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth, which all covered larger areas, it is also known as Wandsworth Town.

==History==

At the time of the Domesday Book (1086), the manor of Wandsworth was held partly by William, son of Ansculfy, and partly by St Wandrille&#x27;s Abbey. Its Domesday assets were 12 hides, with ploughs and of meadow. It rendered £9. Since at least the early 16th century, Wandsworth has offered accommodation to consecutive waves of immigration, from Protestant Dutch metalworkers fleeing persecution in the 1590s, Huguenots in the 17th century, to recent Eastern European members of the European Union.

===Brewing===
Between Wandsworth town centre and the river is the site of Young &amp; Co&#x27;s Ram Brewery. Shire horse-drawn brewery drays were still used to deliver beer to local pubs. Whilst brewing by Young&#x27;s stopped in September 2006 when Young &amp; Co merged its operations with Charles Wells of Bedford, brewing does continue on the site by a master brewer albeit in small amounts. A planning application to redevelop the site for residential and shopping/leisure &quot;mixed use&quot; was submitted in 2012 and approved in 2013. In 2019 it was announced that Sambrook&#x27;s Brewery will continue to brew beer on the site moving from their brewhouse on York Road in 2020 with John Hatch (former master brewer of Youngs Brewery) taking an active role in tours.

===Gas and power===
Wandsworth gas plant was built in 1834 against the River Thames near Wandsworth Bridge. The undertaking became the Wandsworth and Putney Gaslight and Coke Company in 1854 and was incorporated by an act of Parliament, the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Act 1856 (19 &amp; 20 Vict. c. lxii). Coal for making coal gas was brought by sea from North East England and unloaded on the Thames beside the gasworks. The firm grew by a series of mergers and takeovers so that by 1936 it served a considerable area of south-west London. The company&#x27;s name evolved each time it merged with or took over neighbouring gas companies, but from 1936 it was the Wandsworth and District Gas Company. The company was nationalised in 1949 and became part of the South Eastern Gas Board.

Wandsworth power station was built on The Causeway and supplied electricity to the district of Wandsworth from 1897 to 1964. It was owned and operated by the County of London Electric Supply Company Limited until the nationalisation of the British electricity supply industry in 1948. The power station was decommissioned in 1964. There is an operational 132 kV national grid substation to the east of the River Wandle.

===World War I: The Wandsworth Battalion===
On the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 Lord Kitchener issued his famous call to arms: &#x27;Your King and Country Need You&#x27;. The flood of volunteers overwhelmed the ability of the Army to absorb them, and units began to be raised by local initiative from men who wished to serve together: these were known as &#x27;Pals battalions&#x27;. The &#x27;Pals&#x27; phenomenon quickly spread across the country, and Kitchener approached the mayors of the 28 Metropolitan boroughs of the County of London to raise units of local men. 

Alderman Archibald Dawnay, Mayor of Wandsworth, raised a complete infantry battalion, the 13th (Service) Battalion, East Surrey Regiment (Wandsworth), which served on the Western Front. On 24 April 1917 the battalion distinguished itself in an attack on the fortified village of Villers-Plouich, in which Corporal Edward &#x27;Tiny&#x27; Foster, a Wandsworth Council dustman in civilian life, won the Victoria Cross. It also fought at the Capture of Bourlon Wood. Most of the battalion was overrun and captured during the German spring offensive of 1918, and the remnant became a training unit.

After the war, Wandsworth raised money for the rebuilding of Villers-Plouich and the unofficial twinning was revived in the 1990s. Among the memorial tablets in the garden of Wandsworth Town Hall are those to the 13th Battalion, &#x27;The Wandsworth Regulars&#x27;, and to Corporal Foster, after whom a path in King George&#x27;s Park is named.

==Geography==
The former wharf area of the river-front is now lined with new apartment blocks, with several bars and restaurants including near the Wandsworth Bridge.
Wandsworth Common is set back from the river, at the top of East Hill, and is adjoined by an area known locally as &quot;the Toast Rack&quot; that has some of the most expensive townhouses in London, as well as the restaurant &quot;Chez Bruce&quot;, formerly &quot;Harveys&quot;, where chef Gordon Ramsay learned his trade, and for which co-owner Bruce Poole gained a Michelin star in 1999. Also in the area is the Royal Victoria Patriotic Building, which now contains flats, a theatre school and a restaurant.

The Tonsleys/Old York Road is a residential area of old Wandsworth close to the river and town centre, so called because many of the street names have the word &quot;Tonsley&quot; included. It has a village feel with the Old York Road&#x27;s cafes and shops at its heart. The area has three notable pubs: the Royal Standard, the East Hill and the Alma. East Hill is an area of large Victorian houses bordered by the west side of Wandsworth Common. From 2007 to 2014 the area was used as the location for the BBC TV series &quot;Outnumbered&quot;.

Wandsworth High Street is dominated by the regenerated Southside shopping centre, cinema and restaurant complex (formerly called the Arndale Centre). Behind the shopping centre, and following the River Wandle upstream towards Earlsfield and further south to Wimbledon, is King George&#x27;s Park.

Wandsworth Museum previously occupied the former Victorian library in West Hill having been moved there in 2007. The museum closed in March 2015. The De Morgan Centre is currently situated in Wandsworth Museum and houses a collection of Victorian artwork. A green plaque to commemorate aviation pioneer Alliott Verdon Roe was unveiled by Wandsworth Council and members of the Verdon-Roe family beside the A3 close to Wandsworth Fire Station on the site of Roe&#x27;s first workshop in the stables of his brother&#x27;s house at 47 West Hill.

The underpass beneath the Wandsworth Bridge roundabout was the location for the scene in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; in which a tramp is attacked.

There are several schools in Wandsworth including Shaftesbury Park Primary School.

Wandsworth Town Library is on Garratt Lane. The library opened in 2009 and is located in the former court house, a listed building.

==Transport==
The nearest railway stations are Wandsworth Town; Wandsworth Common (one stop from Clapham Junction, and 12 minutes&#x27; train ride from London Victoria); and Earlsfield, (one stop from Clapham Junction, and 12 minutes&#x27; train ride from London Waterloo). Wandsworth Town is also served by Southfields tube station in the Southfields area of the Town.

==Churches==
All Saints&#x27; is the original parish church of Wandsworth, dating back to the 13th century, although the present building is mostly of the 18th century. St Anne&#x27;s and Holy Trinity churches were built in the 19th century to accommodate a growing population.

==Wandsworth Prison==
Built in 1851, Wandsworth Prison is a Category B men&#x27;s prison. It is the largest prison in London and one of the largest in Europe, with a similar capacity to Liverpool Prison.

==History==
The Montana Legislature established Sheridan County in 1913 from portions of Dawson and Valley Counties. It was named for American Civil War General Philip Sheridan.

At the 1932 presidential election the communist candidate William Z. Foster got 576 votes (22%). International changes in communist organizing strategies, especially the move towards the popular front, effectively ended communist presence in the area.

<text>Wanstead () is an area in East London, England, in the London Borough of Redbridge. It borders South Woodford to the north, Redbridge to the east and Forest Gate to the south, with Leytonstone and Walthamstow to the west. It is located 8 miles northeast of Charing Cross.

Historically an ancient parish in the Becontree hundred of Essex, it was granted urban district status in 1894, and formed part of the Municipal Borough of Wanstead and Woodford between 1937 and 1965, when it became part of the London Borough of Redbridge. Wanstead was a key part of the M11 link road protest from 1993 to 1995, which ended with the construction of the A12 that runs through the town.

The area contains a number of open spaces that are part of Epping Forest, including the grasslands of Wanstead Flats and the woodland of Wanstead Park. Wanstead Park was the site of a suspected Roman villa, and later Wanstead Hall, the manor house of Wanstead Manor. The park, with artificial lakes, was formerly part of the estate of a large stately home Wanstead House (1722–1825), built by Richard Child, 1st Earl Tylney.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The place name is probably of Saxon origin and is first recorded in a charter of 1065 as Wenstede. The English Place-Names Society derives the name from the Anglo-Saxon words &quot;waenn&quot;, meaning a hill or mound, and &quot;stede&quot;, a place or settlement. According to an alternative explanation, the first element means &quot;wain&quot; or &quot;wagon&quot;, but the meaning of the full compound is not clear. A place in Essex, in 1460, has a name spelt as &quot;Waynsted&quot;.

===Astronomy===
In 1707 the astronomer James Pound became rector of Wanstead. In 1717 the Royal Society lent Pound Huygens&#x27;s 123-foot focal length object-glass, which he set up in Wanstead Park. Pound&#x27;s observations with it of the five known satellites of Saturn enabled Halley to correct calculations of their movements; and Newton employed, in the third edition of the &quot;Principia&quot;, his micrometrical measures of Jupiter&#x27;s disc, of Saturn&#x27;s disc and ring, and of the elongations of their satellites; and obtained from him data for correcting the places of the comet of 1680. Laplace also used Pound&#x27;s observations of Jupiter&#x27;s satellites for the determination of the planet&#x27;s mass; and Pound himself compiled in 1719 a set of tables for the first satellite, into which he introduced an equation for the transmission of light.

Pound trained his sister&#x27;s son, James Bradley, and many of their observations were made together, including the opposition of Mars in 1719, and the transit of Mercury on 29 October 1723. Their measurement of γ Virginis in 1718 was the first made of the components of a double star and was directed towards the determination of stellar parallax.

In 1727, Bradley embarked upon a series of observations using a telescope of his own, erected at the rectory in Wanstead, now the site of Wanstead High School. This instrument had the advantage of a large field of view and he was able to obtain precise positions of a large number of stars that transited close to the zenith over the course of about two years. Combined with observations from his friend Samuel Molyneux&#x27;s house at Kew in Surrey, this established the existence of the phenomenon of aberration of light, and also allowed Bradley to formulate a set of rules that would allow the calculation of the effect on any given star at a specified date.

===The George public house===

Although current building is from 1903, The George has been a pub on the site since at least 1716. Set in to the side of the pub is a plaque dating from 1752, which was formerly part of an older pub building. The plaque is inscribed with the eccentrically spelled verse:

: &quot;In Memory of&quot;
: &quot;Ye Cherry Pey&quot;
: &quot;As cost 1/2 a Guiney&quot;
: &quot;Ye 17 of July&quot;
: &quot;That day we had good cheer&quot;
: &quot;I hope to so do maney a Year&quot;
: &quot;R C 1752 D Jerry&quot;

There are various local legends explaining this curious plaque, including a tale of the theft of a cherry pie by local workmen who were caught and fined half a guinea (52.5p). However the most likely explanation is that it was placed there by the landlord of 1752, David Jersey (corrupted by centuries of repainting and re-cutting the inscription to D Jerry on the plaque), commemorating a feast which included a huge cherry pie. Monstrous pies were a feature of 18th-century Essex rural festivals; the Galmpton Gooseberry Pie Fair in Devon is still in existence, and other inns around the edge of Epping Forest were famed for pies (rabbit pie at The Reindeer, Loughton, now Warren House, and pigeon pie at The King&#x27;s Head, Chigwell). Wanstead was well known for its cherry orchards as late as the 1830s, when they were mentioned by poet Thomas Hood, who lived in Wanstead 1832–5.

===Schools and education===
The Royal Commercial Travellers Schools were sited in Wanstead from their foundation in 1845 by John Robert Cuffley until their move to Pinner in 1855. The schools at Wanstead provided housing, food, clothing and education for up to 130 children of commercial travellers who had died or became unable to earn their livelihood.

The Royal Merchant Navy School was founded in St George in the East, London in 1827 before moving to Hermon Hill, Wanstead in 1862. The new building provided for 300 orphans of Merchant Navy seamen. It moved again to Bearwood House near Wokingham in 1921. The building then became a convent refuge for women and girls and later Wanstead Hospital.

The Royal Wanstead School was by the Eagle Pond, Snaresbrook up to about 1970. It subsequently became the site of a Crown Court.

Wanstead is home to a large comprehensive school, Wanstead High School. Primary schools in Wanstead include Wanstead Church, Our Lady of Lourdes RC, Aldersbrook and Nightingale.

From 1957 until 1987 Wanstead had a secondary Modern School called Nightingale Secondary Modern School. There was also Nightingale Primary School on the site which is still in existence. These schools were within the boundaries of Ashbourne Avenue, Colvin Gdns. and Elmcroft Ave.

Forest School, Walthamstow is close to Eagle Pond and Snaresbrook Crown Court.

=== Places of worship ===

The church of St Mary the Virgin, Wanstead was completed in 1790. It is now a Grade I listed building, and contains a large monument to Josiah Child. It was followed in the 1860s by both the Anglican church of Christ Church and Wanstead Congregational Church. Our Lady of Lourdes, Wanstead the local Catholic Church in Cambridge Park was opened in 1928.

==Politics==
Winston Churchill represented Wanstead as MP from 1924 to 1945 when Wanstead formed part of the Epping Constituency, and also when Wanstead lay within the Woodford Constituency, from 1945 to 1964. During this period he served as Prime Minister (1940–1945) during much of the Second World War, and again in peace-time, from 1951 to 1955. There is a bust of Churchill in Wanstead High Street.

==Military activity==
During the Second World War the tunnels of the as-yet-to-be-commercially used Wanstead underground station were utilised for aircraft production.

Wanstead Flats was used for Anti-Aircraft batteries protecting London, Barracks for Pre-D-Day troops and a Prisoner-of-War Camp subsequently. Due to terminal moraine (left by glaciers) the soil was relatively infertile.

==Underground stations==
Wanstead has two London Underground stations at either end of the High Street that runs through the town; Snaresbrook and Wanstead on the Central line. 

==Sports==
Wandstead F.C. and Woodford and Wanstead F.C. are based in the area.

<text>Wapping () is an area in the borough of Tower Hamlets in London, England. It is in East London and part of the East End. Wapping is on the north bank of the River Thames between St Katharine Docks to the west, and Shadwell to the east. This position gives the district a strong maritime character.

The area was historically composed of two parishes, St George in the East, and the much smaller St John&#x27;s. Urbanisation of the shoreline began in earnest after the draining of Wapping marsh, and the consolidation of the river wall in the late 16th century. Many of the original buildings were demolished during the construction of the London Docks and Wapping was further seriously damaged during the Blitz. As the London Docklands declined after the Second World War, the area became run down, with the great warehouses left empty. Some were demolished, but others such as Tobacco Dock survive. The area underwent further change during the 1980s when warehouses started to be converted into luxury flats.

Rupert Murdoch moved his News International printing and publishing works into Wapping in 1986, resulting in a trade union dispute that became known as the &quot;Battle of Wapping&quot;.

==History==
===Origins===
Formerly, it was believed that the name &quot;Wapping&quot; recorded an Anglo-Saxon settlement linked to a personal name &quot;Waeppa&quot; (&quot;the settlement of Waeppa&#x27;s people&quot;). More recent scholarship discounts that theory: much of the area was marshland, where early settlement was unlikely, and no such personal name has ever been found. It is now thought that the name may derive from &quot;wapol&quot;, a marsh.

Wapping was historically part of the Manor and Parish of Stepney. By the 17th century, it formed two autonomous Hamlets, a Hamlet in this context refers to an autonomous area of a parish rather than a small village. The northern Hamlet was known as &quot;Wapping-Stepney&quot;, as it was the part of Wapping within Stepney, the riverside part was known as &quot;Wapping-Whitechapel&quot; as it was the part within the parish of Whitechapel, a parish which was previously also a part of the parish of Stepney.

These Hamlets later became independent parishes, with &quot;Wapping-Stepney&quot; becoming known as St-George-in-the-East (in 1729) and &quot;Wapping-Whitechapel&quot; known as St John of Wapping (in 1694). The latter occupied a very narrow strip along nearly all of Wapping&#x27;s riverside.

The Wapping parishes were part of the historic (or ancient) county of Middlesex, but military and most (or all) civil county functions were managed more locally, by the Tower Division (also known as the Tower Hamlets).

The role of the &quot;Tower Division&quot; ended when Wapping became part of the new County of London in 1889. The County of London was replaced by Greater London in 1965.

===Riverside development===

The draining of Wapping Marsh, and the consolidation of a river wall along which houses were built, were finally achieved by 1600 after previous attempts had failed. (See Embanking of the tidal Thames). The settlement developed along that river wall, hemmed in by the river to the south and the now-drained Wapping Marsh to the north This gave it a peculiarly narrow and constricted shape, consisting of little more than the axis of Wapping High Street and some north–south side streets. John Stow, the 16th-century historian, described it as a &quot;continual street, or a filthy strait passage, with alleys of small tenements or cottages, built, inhabited by sailors&#x27; victuallers&quot;. A chapel to St. John the Baptist was built in 1617, and it was here that Thomas Rainsborough was buried. Wapping was constituted as a parish in 1694.

Wapping&#x27;s proximity to the river gave it a strong maritime character for centuries, well into the 20th century. It was inhabited by sailors, mastmakers, boatbuilders, blockmakers, instrument-makers, victuallers and representatives of all the other trades that supported the seafarer. Wapping was also the site of &#x27;Execution Dock&#x27;, where pirates and other water-borne criminals faced execution by hanging from a gibbet constructed close to the low water mark. Their bodies would be left dangling until they had been submerged three times by the tide.

The Bell Inn, by the execution dock, was run by Samuel Batts, whose daughter, Elizabeth, married James Cook at St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Barking, Essex on 21 December 1762, after the Royal Navy captain had stayed at the Inn. The couple initially settled in Shadwell, attending St Paul&#x27;s church, but later moved to Mile End. Although they had six children together, much of their married life was spent apart, with Cook absent on his voyages and, after his murder in 1779 at Kealakekua Bay, she survived until 1835.

Said to be England&#x27;s first, the Marine Police Force was formed in 1798 by magistrate Patrick Colquhoun and a Master Mariner, John Harriott, to tackle theft and looting from ships anchored in the Pool of London and the lower reaches of the river. Its base was (and remains) in Wapping High Street and it is now known as the Marine Support Unit. The Thames Police Museum, dedicated to the history of the Marine Police Force, is currently housed within the headquarters of the Marine Support Unit, and is open to the public by appointment.

In 1811, the Ratcliff Highway murders took place nearby at The Highway and Wapping Lane.

===London Docks===
The area&#x27;s strong maritime associations changed radically in the 19th century when the London Docks were built to the north and west of the High Street. Wapping&#x27;s population plummeted by nearly 60% during that century, with many houses destroyed by the construction of the docks and giant warehouses along the riverfront. Squeezed between the high walls of the docks and warehouses, the riverside area became isolated from the rest of London, although some relief was provided by Brunel&#x27;s Thames Tunnel to Rotherhithe. The opening of Wapping tube station on the East London line in 1869 provided a direct rail link to the rest of London.

===Migration===
Wapping&#x27;s position by the Thames has meant it has long attracted people from around the world. In the 15th century, the population of the area included a number of foreigners, in particular seamen from the Low Countries.

There was a sizeable Irish presence in Wapping from the 16th century onward. It is probably under their influence a stretch of Cable Street, and the area around it, become called &quot;Knock Fergus&quot;. The Irish name of &quot;Knock Fergus&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;Knock Vargis&quot;) is first known to be recorded in 1597 and continued to be recorded in Stepney parish rolls in the 1600&#x27;s. &quot;Knock Fergus&quot; (the hill of Fergus) is an old name for Carrickfergus in County Antrim. In the 20th century Irish migration to Wapping slowed and by the middle of the century the local Irish community had been assimilated.

In 1702, a French-speaking church established at Milk Alley, next to St Johns Church, close to the shore in western Wapping. The church was established to support a community of French speaking seafarers originating in Jersey and Guernsey who had been joined by Huguenot refugees from France. There seems to have been a good relationship with the rest of the population as it received financial support from the Rector of St Johns, when it was in financial difficulty, and its long term future was settled by an intervention from Queen Anne who provided it with an allowance.

Starting in the 16th century, and accelerating later, parts of Wapping attracted large number of German migrants, with many of these people, and their descendants working in the sugar industry. The area north of The Highway (formerly St George&#x27;s Highway) and west of Cannon Street became known – together with neighbouring parts of Whitechapel – as &quot;Little Germany&quot;.

There appears to have been a considerable black presence in late 18th century Wapping, on account of the many black and mulatto (mixed race) people, often seamen, being baptised at the two parish churches of St John&#x27;s and in particular St George in the East. There appears to also have been a sizeable black population in the areas to the west, the parish of St Botolph without Aldgate (both the Portsoken and East Smithfield areas of the parish, and possibly also in St Katharine&#x27;s Precinct, a densely populated little district that was swept away to build St Katharine Docks.

===Modern times===
Wapping was devastated by German bombing in the Second World War and by the post-war closure of the docks. It remained a run-down and derelict area into the 1980s, when the area was transferred to the management of the London Docklands Development Corporation, a government quango with the task of redeveloping the Docklands. The London Docks were largely filled in and redeveloped with a variety of commercial, light industrial and residential properties.

St John&#x27;s Church, Wapping (1756) was located on what is now Scandrett Street. Only the tower and shell survived wartime bombing, and have now been converted to housing.

==Wapping dispute==

The &quot;Wapping dispute&quot; or &quot;Battle of Wapping&quot; was, along with the miners&#x27; strike of 1984–85, a significant turning point in the history of the trade union movement and of UK industrial relations. It started on 24 January 1986 when some 6,000 newspaper workers went on strike after protracted negotiation with their employer, News International (parent of Times Newspapers and News Group Newspapers, and chaired by Rupert Murdoch). News International had built and clandestinely equipped a new printing plant for all its titles in Wapping, and when the print unions announced a strike it activated this new plant with the assistance of the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union (EETPU).

The plant was nicknamed &quot;Fortress Wapping&quot; when the sacked print workers effectively besieged it, mounting round-the-clock pickets and blockades in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to thwart the move. In 2005, News International announced the intention to move the print works to regional presses based in Broxbourne (the world&#x27;s largest printing plant, opened March 2008), Liverpool and Glasgow. The editorial staff were to remain, however, and there was talk of redeveloping the sizeable plot that makes up the printing works.

==Landmarks==
Perhaps Wapping&#x27;s greatest attraction is the Thames foreshore itself and the venerable public houses that face onto it. A number of the &#x27;watermen&#x27;s stairs&#x27;, such as Wapping Old Stairs and Pelican Stairs (by the Prospect of Whitby), give public access to a littoral zone (for the Thames is tidal at this point) littered with flotsam, jetsam and fragments of old dock installations. The area is popular with amateur archaeologists and treasure hunters. This activity is known as mudlarking; the term for a shore scavenger in the 18th and 19th centuries was a mudlark.

&quot;St George in the East&quot;, on Cannon Street Road, is one of six Hawksmoor churches in London, built from 1714 to 1729, with funding from the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches. The church was hit by a bomb during the Blitz and the original interior was destroyed by the fire, but the walls and distinctive &quot;pepper-pot&quot; towers remained intact. In 1964, a modern church interior was constructed inside the existing walls for the active congregation and a new flat built under each corner tower. Behind the church lies St George&#x27;s Gardens, the original cemetery, which was passed to Stepney Council to maintain as a public park in mid-Victorian times. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the crypt of the church was used as a public air raid shelter and was fully occupied when the aforementioned bomb struck; there were no casualties and everyone was evacuated safely, thanks to the air raid wardens and fire brigade.

St John&#x27;s Church, Wapping, the oldest church in Wapping, built in 1756 by Joel Johnson, was also hit by a bomb during WWII. The distinctive lead-topped tower remains and the former churchyard is a public park. Adjoining the church is St John&#x27;s Old School, founded c.1695 for the new parish and rebuilt together with the church in 1756.

The &quot;Execution Dock&quot; was located on the Thames. It was used by the Admiralty for over 400 years (as late as 1830) to hang pirates that had been convicted and sentenced to death by the Admiralty court. The Admiralty only had jurisdiction over crimes on the sea, so the dock was located within their jurisdiction by being located far enough offshore as to be beyond the low-tide mark. It was used to kill the notorious Captain Kidd. Many prisoners would be executed together as a public event in front of a crowd of onlookers after being paraded from the Marshalsea Prison across London Bridge and past the Tower of London to the dock.

Tobacco Dock is a Grade I listed warehouse, adjacent to The Highway. It was constructed in approximately 1811 and served primarily as a store for imported tobacco. In 1990, it was converted into a shopping centre at a development cost of £47 million with the intention to create the &quot;Covent Garden of the East End&quot;; the scheme was unsuccessful though and went into administration. Since the mid-1990s, the building has been almost entirely unoccupied; it is now occasionally used for filming, and for large corporate and commercial events.

Three venerable public houses are located near the Stairs. By Pelican Stairs is the &quot;Prospect of Whitby&quot;, formerly the Devil&#x27;s Tavern, which has a much-disputed claim to be the oldest Thames-side public house still in existence. Be that as it may, there has been an inn on the site since the reign of Henry VIII and it is certainly one of the most famous public houses in London. It is named after a then-famous collier that used to dock regularly at Wapping. A replica of the old Execution Dock gibbet is maintained on the adjacent foreshore, although the actual site of Execution Dock was nearer to the &quot;Town of Ramsgate&quot;. This also is on the site of a 16th-century inn and is located next to Wapping Old Stairs to the west of the &quot;Prospect&quot;; by Wapping Pier Head – the former local headquarters of the Customs and Excise.

Situated halfway between the two is the &quot;Captain Kidd&quot;, named after the Scottish privateer William Kidd. He was hanged on the Wapping foreshore in 1701 after being found guilty of murder and piracy. Although the pub occupies a 17th-century building, it was only established in the 1980s.

==Education==
==Transport==
===Railway===
The local station is Wapping on the London Overground&#x27;s East London line; it is in Travelcard Zone 2. There are regular direct services to , Highbury &amp; Islington, West Croydon, , and .

The narrowness of the platforms means that the station does not fully meet the safety standards for an underground station, but is permitted to operate under a derogation from His Majesty&#x27;s Railway Inspectorate.

Formerly on the London Underground, the Metropolitan and the District Railways were the first lines to serve the station on 1 October 1884, but the station was last served by District trains on 31 July 1905. The East London line closed as an Underground route on 22 December 2007; it was rebranded and reopened on 27 April 2010 when it became part of the Overground system.

===Buses===
London bus services are operated by London Central and Stagecoach London. Routes include the 100, D3 and night bus N551; these connect Wapping with East and Central London.

===Roads===
Wapping is connected to the National Road Network by The Highway A1203 east–west, which passes to the north of the area.

===Cycling, walking and waterways===
The Thames Path passes west–east through Wapping for cyclists and walkers. 

Thames River Services operate a sightseeing boat route between Westminster and Greenwich, which call at Wapping. 

The Ornamental Canal runs through the area, mostly in the centre, to Shadwell Basin.
