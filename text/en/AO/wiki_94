<text>Muswell Hill is a suburban district of the London Borough of Haringey, north London. The hill, which reaches over above sea level, is situated north of Charing Cross. 

Neighbouring areas include Highgate, Hampstead Garden Suburb, East Finchley and Crouch End. It has many streets with Edwardian architecture.

== History ==

The earliest records of Muswell Hill date from the 12th century. The Bishop of London, who was the Lord of the Manor of Haringey, owned the area and granted , located to the east of Colney Hatch Lane, to a newly formed order of nuns. The nuns built a chapel on the site and called it Our Lady of Muswell.

The name &quot;Muswell&quot; is believed to come from a natural spring or well (the &quot;Mossy Well&quot;), said to have miraculous properties. A traditional story tells that Scottish king Malcolm IV was cured of disease after drinking the water. The area became a place of pilgrimage for healing during medieval times. The River Moselle, which has its source in Muswell Hill and Highgate, derives its name from this district; it was originally known as the &quot;Mosa&quot; or &quot;Mosella&quot;. Until the 1950s, the town&#x27;s name was often pronounced &quot;Muzzle Hill&quot;.

In the 18th century Muswell Hill was a scattered village consisting mainly of detached villas with large gardens. In 1787 one commentator wrote that nowhere within of London was there a village so pleasant or with such varied views. Little had changed by the middle of the 19th century. One of the houses of the time was &quot;The Limes&quot;. This house occupied the angle of Muswell Hill Road with Colney Hatch Lane and was a three-storeyed house with portico and two-storeyed wing approached by a double carriage drive through impressive gateways. The large grounds of the house extended to Tetherdown and included a lake. Opposite &quot;The Limes&quot; was Muswell Hill pond and beyond that the &quot;Green Man&quot; inn, built of stone.

Further down the hill past the &quot;Green Man&quot; was &quot;The Elms&quot;, a squat three-storeyed house later improved by Thomas Cubitt standing in , part of the grounds of which were laid out by Joseph Paxton. A short distance down the north side of Muswell Hill was &quot;The Grove&quot;, which was three storeys high and had nine bays with pedimented projections at each end. It stood in of grounds which contained a avenue of oaks. In 1774 the house was occupied by Topham Beauclerk.

===19th century===
A little farther down the hill stood &quot;Grove Lodge&quot;, also in wooded grounds. Altogether there were eight properties in Muswell Hill worthy of note in 1817.
Parallel with Muswell Hill was a track known as St James&#x27;s Lane which ran across a triangle of wasteland. By the middle of the 19th century houses were already dispersed along the lane at the foot of which was &quot;Lalla Rookh&quot;, a two-storeyed villa with a wide verandah. Other buildings there were apparently cottages or huts, both single and in terraces.

It was not until the end of the 19th century that Muswell Hill began to be developed more densely from a collection of country houses to the London village that it is today. The development was spurred by the opening in 1873 of Alexandra Palace, a massive pleasure pavilion built on the most easterly of north London&#x27;s gravel hills and intended as the counterpart to the Crystal Palace on Sydenham Hill in south London. Alexandra Palace was served by a branchline railway from Highgate, with an intermediary station at Muswell Hill (see below). The foot of Alexandra Palace was served by another rail network with connecting services to Finsbury Park and Kings Cross stations.

===20th century===
Most development was initiated in the early 20th century when the current street pattern was set out and elegant Edwardian retail parades were constructed. The shopping centre is based on roads that form three sides of a square: Fortis Green Road, Muswell Hill Broadway and the extension of the Broadway into Colney Hatch Lane. At each node point is a church: United Reformed, Church of England, Methodist, and Roman Catholic. One of the nodes, opposite St James&#x27;s CoE, was also the site of the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; music hall (later demolished with the site redeveloped as a supermarket), opposite which a surviving art deco Odeon cinema was built in the 1930s. The site of the Ritz, a cinema formerly at the top of Muswell Hill on the next node to the east, has been redeveloped as offices.

Until the mid-20th century there was a rail branch line, the Muswell Hill Railway, from Highgate which passed through Muswell Hill, terminating at a station at Alexandra Palace. It was intended under the Northern Heights plan to integrate this into the London Underground Northern line; some contemporary tube maps (e.g. the 1948 map) showed the line as being under construction. However, this plan was cancelled after the Second World War, and the railway line was abandoned in 1954. The line was later converted to become the Parkland Walk.

In 1964, three young Muswell Hill residents, the brothers Ray and Dave Davies and Pete Quaife, formed The Kinks. Categorised in the United States as a British Invasion band, the Kinks are recognised as one of the most important and influential rock groups of the era. The Davies parents’ home at 6 Denmark Terrace, Fortis Green, remains a magnet for rock music tourists.

In 1950, Paul Andrew Smith, was born in Muswell Hill at 12 Crown Road, and later became a founding member of the band Wednesday, formed in 1967. Their record success included the chart topping hit, Last Kiss followed by a series of top ten records in Canada, Australia and the USA.
They earned several Juno nominations, a Maple Leaf Award, Gold record award and was nominated into the Hall of Fame with a lifetime achievement in 2022.

In 1979 Wetherspoons opened their first pub, on Colney Hatch Lane.

In November 2016, the shop &#x27;Really British&#x27; opened on Muswell Hill broadway. The shop owner was accused of racism, with local residents threatening to stage a protest, with more practising a boycott.

In March 2013 and June 2020 Muswell Hill was named one of the five most desirable places to live in London in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; guide.

==Administration and representation==
The hill was part of the Bishop of London&#x27;s Manor of Hornsey, an area served from the medieval period by the ancient parish of Hornsey. Parishes were originally ecclesiastic in purpose, but from the Tudor era onwards had a civic as well as ecclesiastical purpose.

In 1903, the area of the civil parish of Hornsey became the Municipal Borough of Hornsey, within the administrative county of Middlesex. Then in 1965 Hornsey merged with Tottenham and Wood Green to form the modern London Borough of Haringey.

Northern parts of the N10 postal area, sometimes also regarded as part of Muswell Hill, were part of the parish of Friern Barnet, which subsequently became Friern Barnet Urban District before becoming part of the London Borough of Barnet.

The area is in the Hornsey and Friern Barnet parliamentary constituency.

==Geography==
Close to Alexandra Park and Highgate Woods, Muswell Hill is a mainly Edwardian north London suburb. Muswell Hill Broadway and Fortis Green Road, the main shopping streets, still maintain their historic character with most of the original facades preserved above street level. The area has a synagogue and six churches, one of which has been converted into a steak house.

<doc id="94186" wikidata="Q2315832" url="?curid=94186" title="Neasden">
<text>Neasden is a suburban area in northwest London, England. It is located around the centre of the London Borough of Brent and is within the NW2 (Cricklewood) and NW10 (Willesden) postal districts. Neasden is near Wembley Stadium, the Welsh Harp, and Gladstone Park; the reservoir and River Brent marks its boundaries with Kingsbury and Wembley, while Gladstone Park and the Dudding Hill line separates it from Dollis Hill and Church End respectively. The A406 North Circular Road runs through the middle of Neasden; to the west is the Neasden Underground Depot, Brent Park retail area and the St Raphael&#x27;s Estate; on the east is Neasden tube station, the large Neasden Temple, and former Neasden Power Station. The area is known as the place where Bob Marley lived after moving from Jamaica, living at a house in The Circle; the house was honoured with a blue plaque in 2012.

==History==
===Name===
The area was recorded as &quot;Neasdun&quot; in AD 939 and the name is derived from the Old English &quot;nēos&quot; = &#x27;nose&#x27; and &quot;dūn&quot; = &#x27;hill&#x27;. It means &#x27;the nose-shaped hill&#x27;, referring to a well-defined landmark of this area. In 1750, it was known as &quot;Needsden&quot; and the present spelling appeared at a later date.

===As a hamlet===
Neasden was a countryside hamlet on the western end of the Dollis Hill ridge. The land was owned by St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, who appointed priests to St Mary&#x27;s Church in Neasden. In medieval times, the village consisted only of several small buildings around the green near the site of the present Neasden roundabout.

In the 15th–17th centuries the Roberts family were the major landowners in the area. Thomas Roberts erected Neasden House (on the site of the modern Clifford Court) in the reign of Henry VIII.
In 1651 Sir William Roberts bought confiscated church lands. After the Restoration the estates were returned to the ownership of the Church but were leased out to the Roberts family. Sir William improved Neasden House, and by 1664 it was one of the largest houses in the Willesden parish.

During the 18th century the Nicoll family replaced the Roberts as the dominant family in Neasden. In the 19th century these farmers and moneyers at the Royal Mint wholly owned Neasden House and much of the land in the area.

Neasden was no more than a &quot;retired hamlet&quot; when enclosure was completed in 1823. At this time there were six cottages, four larger houses or farms, a public house and a smithy, grouped around the green. The dwellings include The Grove, which had been bought by a London solicitor named James Hall, and its former outbuilding, which Hall had converted into a house that became known as The Grange.

The Welsh Harp reservoir was completed in 1835 but breached in 1841 with fatalities. It had a dramatic effect on the landscape as the damming of the River Brent put many fields and meadows under water.

In the early 1850s, Neasden had a population of about 110. As London grew in the second half of the 19th century, the demand for horses for transport in London soared. Neasden farms concentrated on rearing and providing horses for the city. Town work was exhausting and unhealthy for the horses, and in 1886 the RSPCA formed a committee to set up the Home of Rest for Horses with grounds in Sudbury and Neasden, where for a small fee town horses were allowed to graze in the open for a few weeks.

===Urbanisation===
The urbanisation of Neasden began with the arrival of the railway. The first railway running through Neasden (Hendon–Acton and Bedford–St. Pancras) was opened for goods traffic in October 1868, with passenger services following soon. In 1875, Dudding Hill, the first station in the area, was opened, and the Metropolitan Railway was extended through Neasden shortly afterwards. Neasden station was opened on Neasden Lane in 1880. New housing, initially for railway workers, was built in the village (particularly around Village Way) with all the streets named after Metropolitan Railway stations in Buckinghamshire. These survive today, and are called Quainton Street and Verney Street, followed by Aylesbury Street in the 1900s.

In 1883, an Anglican mission chapel, St Saviour&#x27;s, was set up in the village. Its priest, the Reverend James Mills, became an important and popular figure in late 19th century Neasden. In 1885 Mills took over St Andrew&#x27;s, Kingsbury and became vicar of a new parish, Neasden-cum-Kingsbury, created because of the area&#x27;s rising population.

Before Mills&#x27; arrival, the only sporting facilities in Neasden had been two packs of foxhounds, both of which had disbanded by 1857. Mills became founder president of Neasden Cricket Club and encouraged musical societies. In 1893 a golf club was founded at Neasden House; however only 10% of its members came from Neasden.

In the 1890s change led to a conscious effort to create a village atmosphere. At this time, the Spotted Dog became a social centre for local people. By 1891 Neasden had a population of 930, half of whom lived in the village. Despite the presence of the village in the west, it was the London end that grew fastest.
In 1893 the Great Central Railway obtained permission to join up its main line from Nottingham with the Metropolitan. Trains ran on or alongside the Metropolitan track to a terminus at Marylebone (this is now the modern day Chiltern Main Line). The Great Central set up a depot south of the line at Neasden and built houses for its workers (Gresham and Woodheyes Roads). The Great Central village was a &quot;singularly isolated and self-contained community&quot; with its own school and single shop, Branch No. 1 of the North West London Co-operative Society. It is now part of a conservation area. There was considerable sporting rivalry between the two railway estates, and a football match was played every Good Friday. By the 1930s the two railways employed over 1000 men.

Neasden Hospital was built in 1894 and closed in 1986.

===Early 20th century===

Apart from the railways, Neasden was dominated by agriculture until just before the First World War. In 1911, Neasden&#x27;s population had swelled to 2,074. By 1913, light industry at Church End had spread up Neasden Lane as far as the station.
In the 1920s, the building of the North Circular Road, a main arterial route round London, brought another wave of development; it opened in 1922–23. The 1924–25 British Empire Exhibition led to road improvements and the introduction of new bus services. Together with the North Circular Road, it paved the way for a new residential suburb at Neasden. In 1930 Neasden House was part demolished. The last farm in Neasden (covering The Rise, Elm Way and Vicarage Way) was built over in 1935. The Ritz cinema opened in 1935 and Neasden Shopping Parade was opened in 1936, and was considered the most up-to-date in the area. All of Neasden&#x27;s older houses were demolished during this period, except for The Grange, and the Spotted Dog was rebuilt in mock-Tudor style. Industries sprung up in the south of the area, and by 1949, Neasden&#x27;s population was over 13,000.

===WW2 and post-war period===

The Post Office Research Station was located nearby in Dollis Hill. There the Colossus computers, among the world&#x27;s first, were built in 1943-1944 and underneath it the Paddock wartime cabinet rooms were constructed in 1939.

In 1945, Willesden Borough council acquired land by the North Circular Road to build temporary prefab homes. There were two sites: one called Ascot Park built beside the gas factory, and another either side of The Pantiles public house (which is now converted into a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant). Most of the prefab homes were demolished by the end of the 1950s.

The post-war history of Neasden is one of steady decline; local traffic congestion problems necessitated the building of an underpass on the North Circular Road that effectively cut Neasden in half and had a disastrous effect on the shopping centre by making pedestrian access to it difficult. The decline in industry through the 1970s also contributed to the area&#x27;s decline. But nonetheless Neasden has survived, largely due to a succession of vibrant immigrant communities keeping the local economy afloat. Neasden Depot continues to be the main storage and maintenance depot for the London Underground&#x27;s Metropolitan line (and is also used by trains of the Jubilee line); it is London Underground&#x27;s largest depot and as such it is a major local employer.

Neasden Power Station, which was built to provide power for the Metropolitan Railway, was closed and demolished in 1968.

After the war, a new housing estate called St Raphael&#x27;s Estate was built west of the North Circular Road and to the east of the River Brent and Wembley.
In 1978, Tesco purchased a site in Neasden&#x27;s Brent Park retail area by the North Circular Road. The borough council objected against the building of a superstore due to threats against local merchants. The superstore was eventually opened in 1985, and Tesco called it London&#x27;s largest food store. It continues to operate today as Tesco Extra Wembley.

In 1988, IKEA opened its second UK store at the Brent Park retail area, at the site of the old Ascot Gas Water Heater factory.

===Contemporary history===
The Grange Tavern (previously called The Old Spotted Dog) on Neasden Lane was closed in the 1990s and demolished to make way for a block of flats, bringing to an end the inn that had stood there for around two centuries. Another old pub, The Pantiles which stood on the North Circular Road was converted to another McDonald&#x27;s restaurant. The Swedish furniture retailer, IKEA opened its second UK outlet in Neasden in 1988.

On 14 July 1993 in an MI5 anti-terrorist operation, a Provisional IRA man was arrested in his car on Crest Road carrying a 20 lb bomb. It came just over a year after the Staples Corner bombing just over 500 yards away, which devastated the junction.

In 1995, Neasden became the home of the biggest Hindu temple outside India: the Neasden Temple.
The area around Neasden Lane North was for a while terrorised by a local gang called &quot;Press Road Crew&quot; who carried knives, dealt drugs and performed vandalism. In 2003, seven members were caught and were banned from the streets they were active in, including Chalkhill Estate in Wembley Park, in the then biggest (by area size) anti-social behaviour order in Britain.

In 2004, the Shopping Centre area was partially redeveloped by the council in an effort to reverse its fortunes. The Grange, which had housed a community museum about the people of Brent was closed by the council in 2005. The building is now a restaurant with its namesake, located inside the Neasden roundabout. The 2004 redevelopment proved to be unpopular with local businesses as it changed the layouts of parking, thus forcing customers and local trade to pass by due to the parking restrictions of the redevelopment.

In 2018 the writer Nicholas Lezard called Neasden a &quot;prime example of what happens when a big road [North Circular] both carves up and strangles an area.&quot;

==Politics==
Neasden is within the UK parliament constituency of Brent Central, currently represented by Dawn Butler MP (Lab). The part of Neasden north of the railway tracks is in the Welsh Harp ward, while the part to the south is in the Stonebridge ward.

==Neasden in popular culture==
;&quot;The loneliest village in London&quot;
Neasden was once nicknamed ‘the loneliest village in London’.

;&quot;Private Eye&quot;
Neasden has achieved considerable notoriety thanks to the British satirical magazine, &quot;Private Eye&quot;. Since early in its history (when the magazine was actually printed in Neasden) the magazine has used Neasden as an exemplar of the suburban environment in pieces parodying current events, personalities, and social mores (for example, the University of Neasden). Spoof sports reports in the magazine usually feature the perennially unsuccessful football team, Neasden F.C. with their manager, &quot;ashen-faced&quot; Ron Knee and their only two supporters, Sid and Doris Bonkers.

;&quot;Metro-land&quot;
Neasden was one of the locations in the TV documentary &quot;Metro-land&quot;. In it, Sir John Betjeman described Neasden as &quot;home of the gnome and the average citizen&quot; (the former a reference to the preponderance of gnome statuettes in suburban front-gardens, but possibly also a nod in the direction of the Eye&#x27;s fictional proprietor, Lord Gnome). Background music was provided by William Rushton’s recording of Neasden (1972) (&quot;Neasden/You won&#x27;t be sorry that you breezed in&quot;).

;BBC Radiophonic Workshop
In a celebrated spoof of the Early Music phenomenon which grew enormously in the late 1960s, Neasden was selected by BBC Radiophonic Workshop composer David Cain, as the home of a fictional ensemble dedicated to historically-informed performances on authentic musical instruments from an indeterminate number of centuries ago. It was thus that in 1968, listeners to BBC Radio 3 were given a recital by the Schola Polyphonica Neasdeniensis, whose members performed on the equally fictional Shagbut, Minikin and Flemish Clackett.

;Athletico Neasden
Athletico Neasden was an amateur football team of mostly Jewish players, which played in the Maccabi (Southern) Football League in the 1970s and 1980s and was named after the place, though it did not actually play in the area. The team eventually merged with North West Warriors to form North West Neasden.

;Literature
David Sutherland&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;A Black Hole in Neasden&quot; reveals a gateway to another planet in a Neasden back garden. Diana Evans&#x27;s 2006 novel, &quot;26a&quot;, details the experiences of twin girls of Nigerian and British descent growing up in Neasden.

;Victorian Order medals
Willie Hamilton reported in &#x27;My Queen and I&#x27; that the Victorian order medals were made on a production line in Neasden from used railway lines.

;Dread Broadcasting Corporation
A pirate radio station, Dread Broadcasting Corporation, credited as Britain&#x27;s first black music radio station, was broadcast from a Neasden garden between 1981 and 1984.

;Dangermouse
In the episode &quot;Planet of the Machines&quot;, Dangermouse and Penfold arrive back in Neasden from the planet in the Baron&#x27;s space time machine

;BBC Your News
Konnie Huq and Matt Cooke from BBC TV present the &quot;Your News&quot; programme from Neasden.

===Tube===
Neasden station is on the Jubilee line and is the only train station in a pretty wide geographic area, excluding Dollis Hill station which is close but on the same line. The southern end of St Raphael&#x27;s Estate is close to Stonebridge Park station, while the northern end of Neasden (near Staples Corner) is pretty close to Hendon station. In the early 2020s, Brent Cross West station will be opened which would replace Hendon as the nearest Thameslink station for Neasden.

<text>The Mosin–Nagant is a five-shot, bolt-action, internal magazine–fed military rifle. Known officially as the 3-line rifle M1891, in Russia and the former Soviet Union as Mosin&#x27;s rifle (, ISO 9: ) and informally just mosinka (), it is primarily found chambered for its original 7.62×54mmR cartridge.

Developed from 1882 to 1891, it was used by the armed forces of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and various other states. It is one of the most mass-produced military bolt-action rifles in history, with over 37 million units produced since 1891. In spite of its age, it has been used in various conflicts around the world up to the present day.

==History==
===Initial design and tests===

During the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), Imperial Russian troops armed mostly with single-shot Berdan rifles suffered heavy casualties against Ottoman troops equipped with Winchester 1866 repeating rifles, particularly at the bloody Siege of Pleven. This showed Russian commanders the need to modernize the general infantry weapon of the army.

Various weapons were acquired and tested by GAU of the Ministry of War of the Russian Empire, and in 1889 the Lebel Model 1886 rifle was obtained through semi-official channels from France. It was supplied together with a model of the cartridge and bullet but without primer or smokeless powder. Those problems were solved by Russian scientists and engineers (the smokeless powder, for instance, was produced by Dmitri Mendeleev himself).

In 1889, three rifles were submitted for evaluation: Captain Sergei Ivanovich Mosin of the imperial army submitted his &quot;3-line&quot; caliber (.30 cal, 7.62 mm) rifle; Belgian designer Léon Nagant submitted a &quot;3.5-line&quot; (.35 caliber, 9 mm) design; and a Captain Zinoviev submitted another &quot;3-line&quot; design (1 &quot;line&quot; = , thus 3 lines = 7.62 mm).

When trials concluded in 1891, the evaluators were split in their assessment. The main disadvantages of Nagant&#x27;s rifle were a more complicated mechanism and a long and tiresome procedure of disassembling (which required special instruments—it was necessary to unscrew two fasteners). Mosin&#x27;s rifle was mainly criticized for its lower quality of manufacture and materials, due to &quot;artisan pre-production&quot; of his 300 rifles. The commission initially voted 14 to 10 to approve Mosin&#x27;s rifle. At this point the decision was made to rename the existing commission and call it &quot;Commission for creation of the small-bore rifle&quot; (), and to put on paper the final requirements for such a rifle. The inventors obliged by delivering their final designs. Head of the commission, General Chagin, ordered subsequent tests held under the commission&#x27;s supervision, after which the bolt-action of Mosin&#x27;s design was ordered into production under the name of &quot;3-line rifle M1891&quot; ().

The colloquial name &quot;Mosin-Nagant&quot; used in the West is persistent but erroneous, as established in 
Nagant&#x27;s legal dispute.

===Technical detail===
Like the &quot;Gewehr 98&quot;, the 1891 Mosin uses two front-locking lugs to lock up the action. However, the Mosin&#x27;s lugs lock in the horizontal position, whereas the Mauser locks vertically. The Mosin bolt body is multi-piece whereas the Mauser is one piece. The Mosin uses interchangeable bolt heads like the Lee–Enfield. Unlike the Mauser, which uses a controlled feed bolt head in which the cartridge base snaps up under the fixed extractor as the cartridge is fed from the magazine, the Mosin has a push feed recessed bolt head in which the spring-loaded extractor snaps over the cartridge base as the bolt is finally closed similar to the &quot;Gewehr 1888&quot; and M91 Carcano or modern sporting rifles like the Remington 700. Like the Mauser, the Mosin uses a blade ejector mounted in the receiver. The Mosin bolt is removed by simply pulling it fully to the rear of the receiver and squeezing the trigger, while the Mauser has a bolt stop lever separate from the trigger.

Like the Mauser, the bolt lift arc on the Mosin–Nagant is 90 degrees, versus 60 degrees on the Lee–Enfield. The Mauser bolt handle is at the rear of the bolt body and locks behind the solid rear receiver ring. The Mosin bolt handle is similar to the Mannlicher: it is attached to a protrusion on the middle of the bolt body, which serves as a bolt guide, and it locks protruding out of the ejection/loading port in front of a split rear receiver ring, also serving a similar function to Mauser&#x27;s &quot;third&quot; or &quot;safety&quot; lug.

The rifling of the Mosin barrel is right turning (clockwise looking down the rifle) 4-groove with a twist of 1:9.5&quot; or 1:10&quot;. The 5-round fixed metallic magazine can either be loaded by inserting the cartridges individually, or more often in military service, by the use of 5-round stripper clips.

===Initial production===
The &quot;3-line rifle, Model 1891&quot;, its original official designation, was adopted by the Russian military in 1891. Production began in 1892 at the ordnance factories of Tula Arsenal, Izhevsk Arsenal and at Sestroryetsk Arsenal. An order for 500,000 rifles was placed with the French arms factory, .

===Refinement===
There have been several refinements and variations of the original rifle, the most common being the M1891/30 (commonly referred to as &quot;the 91/30&quot; by shooters), which was a modernized design introduced in 1930. Some details were borrowed from Nagant&#x27;s design. 
* One such detail is the attachment of the magazine spring to the magazine base plate. In Mosin&#x27;s original design the spring was not attached to the base plate and, according to the Commission, could be lost during maintenance, rifle cleaning. 
* Another detail is the form of the clip that could hold five cartridges to be loaded simultaneously into the magazine.
* One more detail is the form of the interrupter, a specially designed part within the receiver, which helps prevent double feeding. The initial rifle proposed by Mosin lacked an interrupter, leading to numerous failures to feed. This detail was introduced in the rifle borrowing from Nagant&#x27;s rifle. Although the form of the interrupter was slightly changed, this alteration was subsequently borrowed back by the Commission for the Model 1891. During the modernization of 1930, the form of the interrupter was further changed, from a single piece to a two-piece design, as the part had turned out to be one of the least reliable parts of the action. Only the clip for loading cartridges and the attachment of the magazine spring to the magazine base plate in subsequent models were designed by Nagant. Considering the rifle could be easily loaded without using a clip, one cartridge after another, the magazine spring attached to the magazine base plate is the only contribution of Nagant to all rifles after 1930.

===Nagant&#x27;s legal dispute===
Despite the failure of Nagant&#x27;s rifle, he filed a patent suit, claiming he was entitled to the sum the winner was to receive. It appeared that Nagant was the first to apply for the international patent protection over the interrupter, although he borrowed it from Mosin&#x27;s design initially. Mosin could not apply for a patent since he was an officer of the Russian army, and the design of the rifle was owned by the Government and had the status of a military secret.

A scandal was about to burst out, with Nagant threatening he would not participate in trials held in Russia ever again and some officials proposing to expel Nagant from any further trials, as he borrowed the design of the interrupter after it was covered by the secrecy status given in Russia of that time to military inventions and therefore violated Russian law. Taking into consideration that Nagant was one of the few producers not engaged by competitive governments and generally eager to cooperate and share experience and technology, the Commission paid him a sum of 200,000 Russian rubles, equal to the premium that Mosin received as the winner. The rifle did not receive the name of Mosin, because of the personal decision taken by Tsar Alexander III, which was made based on the opinion of the Defence Minister Pyotr Vannovskiy: 
The Tsar himself dashed the word &quot;Russian&quot; from this document with his own hand. The decision to pay off Nagant proved wise, as he remained the major contractor for the Russian Government, and the Nagant M1895 revolver was subsequently adopted by the Russian army as its main sidearm.

However, in spite of the payment, Nagant attempted to use the situation for publicity, resulting in the name &quot;Mosin–Nagant&quot; appearing in the Western press.

From a technical point of view the rifle that came to be called &quot;Mosin–Nagant&quot; is the design proposed by Mosin as further amended by Mosin with some details borrowed from Nagant&#x27;s design. Only since 1924 the rifle was officially named &quot;Mosin&#x27;s rifle&quot; in the USSR, although some variants were still known only by their year of origin.

===Russo-Japanese War===
In 1889 Tsar Alexander III ordered the Russian army to meet or exceed European standards in rifle developments with &quot;rifles of reduced caliber and cartridges with smokeless powder&quot;. The new weapons would entail &quot;high velocities&quot;, exceeding and would result in land battles both commencing and being capable of being fought at longer ranges, nearly two kilometers. The new Mosin rifles would replace the Berdan rifles then in use by the Russian army.

The Mosin rifle was first tested in combat in 1893, during clashes between Russian and Afghan troops in the Pamirs.

The Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905) was the rifle&#x27;s first major conflict. By the time the war broke out in 1904, approximately 3.8 million had been built, with over 1.5 million in the hands of the Russian cavalry and all of its reserves when hostilities commenced.

Between the adoption of the final design in 1891 and the year 1910, several variants and modifications to the existing rifles were made.

===World War I===

With the start of World War I, production was restricted to the M1891 dragoon and infantry models for the sake of simplicity. Due to the desperate shortage of arms and the shortcomings of a still-developing domestic industry, the Russian government ordered 1.5 million M1891 infantry rifles from Remington Arms and another 1.8 million from New England Westinghouse Company in the United States in 1915. Remington produced 750,000 rifles before production was halted by the 1917 October Revolution. Deliveries to Russia had amounted to 469,951 rifles when the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk ended hostilities between the Central Powers and now Soviet-Russia. Henceforth, the new Bolshevik government of Vladimir Lenin cancelled payments to the American companies manufacturing the Mosin–Nagant (Russia had not paid for the order at any time throughout the Great War).
With Remington and Westinghouse on the precipice of bankruptcy from the Communists&#x27; decision, the remaining 280,000 rifles were purchased by the United States Army. American and British expeditionary forces of the North Russia Campaign were armed with these rifles and sent to Murmansk and Arkhangelsk in the late summer of 1918 to prevent the large quantities of munitions delivered for Tsarist forces from being captured by the Central Powers. Remaining rifles were used for the training of U.S. Army troops. Some were used to equip U.S. National Guard, SATC, and ROTC units. Designated &quot;U.S. Rifle, 7.62mm, Model of 1916&quot;, these are among the rarest of American service arms. In 1917, 50,000 rifles were sent via Vladivostok to the Czechoslovak Legions in Siberia to aid in their attempt to secure passage to France.

Many of the New England Westinghouse and Remington Mosin–Nagants were sold to private citizens in the United States before World War II through the office of the Director of Civilian Marksmanship, the predecessor to the federal government&#x27;s current Civilian Marksmanship Program.

Large numbers of Mosin–Nagants were captured by German and Austro-Hungarian forces and saw service with the rear-echelon forces of both armies, and also with the Imperial German Navy. Many of these weapons were sold to Finland in the 1920s.

===Civil War, modernization, and wars with Finland===
During the Russian Civil War, infantry and dragoon versions were still in production, though in dramatically reduced numbers. The rifle was widely used by all belligerents in the civil war. In 1924, following the victory of the Red Army, a committee was established to modernize the rifle, which had by then been in service for over three decades. This effort led to the development of the Model 91/30 rifle, which was based on the design of the original dragoon version. The barrel length was shortened by . The sight measurements were converted from arshins to meters; and the front sight blade was replaced by a hooded post front sight less susceptible to being knocked out of alignment. There were also minor modifications to the bolt, but not enough to prevent interchangeability with the earlier Model 1891 and the so-called &quot;Cossack dragoon&quot; rifles.

Finland was a Grand Duchy in the Russian Empire until 1917, so Finns had long used the Mosin–Nagant in service with the Imperial military. The rifle was used in the short Finnish Civil War and adopted as the service rifle of the new republic&#x27;s army. Finland produced several variants of the Mosin–Nagant, all of them manufactured using the receivers of Russian-made, American-made, French-made or (later) Soviet-made rifles. Finland also utilized a number of captured M91 and M91/30 rifles with minimal modifications. As a result, the rifle was used on both sides of the Winter War and the Continuation War during World War II. Finnish Mosin–Nagants were produced by SAKO, Tikkakoski, and VKT, with some using barrels imported from Switzerland and Germany. In assembling M39 rifles, Finnish armorers reused &quot;hex&quot; receivers that dated back as far as 1891. Finnish rifles are characterized by Russian, French or American-made receivers stamped with a boxed SA, as well as many other parts produced in those countries and barrels produced in Finland, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and Germany. The Finns also manufactured two-piece &quot;finger splice&quot; stocks for their Mosin–Nagant rifles.

In addition, the rifle was distributed as aid to Republican anti-Franco forces in the Spanish Civil War. Spanish Civil War Mosins can be readily identified by the wire sling hangers inserted in the slots in the forearm and buttstock meant to take the Russian &quot;dog collars&quot; for Russian-style slings, so the rifles could accept Western European–style rifle slings.

===World War II===
At the beginning of the war, the Mosin–Nagant 91/30 was the standard-issue weapon of Soviet troops. Millions were produced in World War II for use by the largest mobilized army in history.

The Mosin–Nagant Model 1891/30 was modified and adapted as a sniper rifle from 1932 onwards, first with mounts and scopes from Germany then with domestic designs (PE, PEM) from 1931; from 1942 it was issued with 3.5-power PU fixed focus scopes. It served quite prominently in the brutal urban battles on the Eastern Front, such as the Battle of Stalingrad, which made heroes of such snipers as Vasily Zaitsev, Lyudmila Pavlichenko, Ivan Sidorenko, and Roza Shanina. Finland also employed the Mosin–Nagant as a sniper rifle, with similar success with their own designs and captured Soviet rifles. For example, Simo Häyhä is credited with having killed 505 Soviet soldiers, many of whom fell victim to his Finnish M/28-30 derivative. Häyhä did not use a scope on his Mosin. In interviews Häyhä gave before his death, he said that the scope and mount designed by the Soviets required the shooter to expose himself too much and raise his head too high, increasing the chances of being spotted by the enemy. In addition, scopes tended to reflect sunlight when moved side to side, which gave away a sniper&#x27;s position.

In 1935–1936, the 91/30 was again modified, this time to lower production time. The &quot;hex&quot; receiver was changed to a round receiver. When war with Germany broke out, the need to produce Mosin–Nagants in vast quantities led to a further simplification of machining and a falling-off in finish of the rifles. The wartime Mosins are easily identified by the presence of tool marks and rough finishing that never would have passed the inspectors in peacetime. However, despite a lack of both aesthetic focus and uniformity, the basic functionality of the Mosins was unimpaired.

In addition, in 1938 a carbine version of the Mosin–Nagant, the M38, was issued. It used the same cartridge and action as other Mosins, but the barrel was shortened by to bring the weapon down to an overall length of , with the forearm shortened in proportion. The idea was to issue the M38 to troops such as combat engineers, signal corps, and artillerymen, who could conceivably need to defend themselves from sudden enemy advances, but whose primary duties lay behind the front lines. Significantly, the front sight of the M38 was positioned in such a way that the Model 91/30&#x27;s cruciform bayonet could not be mounted to the muzzle even if a soldier obtained one.

An increase in urban combat led directly to the development of the Model M44 Mosin. In essence, the M44 is an M38 with a slightly modified forearm and with a permanently mounted cruciform bayonet that folds to the right when it is not needed. It was an improvement on the Model 91/30, particularly for urban warfare; but few M44s saw combat on the Eastern Front.

By the end of the war, approximately 19.8 million Mosin–Nagant rifles had been produced.

===Increased world-wide use===

In the years after World War II, the Soviet Union ceased production of all Mosin–Nagants and withdrew them from service in favor of the SKS series carbines and eventually the AK series rifles. Despite its increasing obsolescence, the Mosin–Nagant saw continued service throughout the Eastern bloc and the rest of the world for many decades to come. Mosin–Nagant rifles and carbines saw service on many fronts of the Cold War, from Korea and Vietnam to Afghanistan and along the Iron Curtain in Europe. They were kept not only as reserve stockpiles, but front-line infantry weapons as well. Finland was still producing the M39 Mosin–Nagant in small numbers as late as 1973.

Virtually every country that received military aid from the Soviet Union, China, and Eastern Europe during the Cold War used Mosin–Nagants at various times. Middle Eastern countries within the sphere of Soviet influence—Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Palestinian fighters—have received them in addition to other more modern arms. Mosin–Nagants have also seen action in the hands of Soviet, Afghan and Mujahadeen forces in Afghanistan during the Soviet Afghan War of the 80s and the following civil wars of the late 1980s and 90s. Their use in Afghanistan continued on well into the 1990s and the early 21st century by Northern Alliance forces.

==Variants==
===Russia/USSR===

* Model 1891 Infantry Rifle (): The primary weapon of Russian and Red Army infantry from 1891 to 1930. Between 1891 and 1910 the following modifications were made to the design of the rifle:
** Changed sights.
** Inclusion of a reinforcing bolt through the finger groove (due to the adoption of a higher velocity 147-grain pointed M1908 &#x27;spitzer&#x27; light ball round.)
** Elimination of the steel finger rest behind the trigger guard.
** New barrel bands.
** Installation of slot-type sling mounts to replace the more traditional swivels.
* Dragoon Rifle (): Intended for use by Dragoons: shorter and lighter than the M1891. The Dragoon rifle&#x27;s dimensions are identical to the later M1891/30 rifle, and most Dragoon rifles were eventually reworked into M1891/30s. Most such rifles, known to collectors as &quot;ex-Dragoons&quot;, can be identified by their pre-1930 date stampings, but small numbers of Dragoon rifles were produced from 1930 to 1932 and after reworking became impossible to distinguish from purpose-built M1891/30s.
* Cossack Rifle (): Introduced for Cossack horsemen, it is almost identical to the Dragoon rifle but is sighted for use without a bayonet. These rifles were also issued without a bayonet.
* Model 1907 Carbine: At shorter and lighter than the M1891, this model was excellent for cavalry, engineers, signalers, and artillerymen. It was stocked nearly to the front sight and therefore did not take a bayonet. It was produced until at least 1917 in small numbers.


* Model 1891/30 (): The most prolific version of the Mosin–Nagant. It was produced for standard issue to all Soviet infantry from 1930 to 1945. Most Dragoon rifles were also converted to the M1891/30 standard. It was commonly used as a sniper rifle in World War II. Early sniper versions had a 3.87×30 PE or PEM scope, a Soviet-made copy of a Zeiss design, while later rifles used smaller, simpler, and easier-to-produce 3.5×21 PU scopes. Because the scope was mounted above the chamber, the bolt handle was replaced with a longer handled, bent version on sniper rifles (known to Mosin collectors and shooters as a &quot;bent bolt&quot;) so the shooter could work the bolt without the scope interfering with it. Like the US M1903A4 Springfield sniper rifle, the location of the scope above the receiver prevents the use of stripper clips. Its design was based on the Dragoon rifle with the following modifications:
** Flat rear sights and restamping of sights in metres, instead of arshinii.
** A cylindrical receiver, replacing the octagonal receiver (commonly called &quot;hex&quot;, but actually having five octagonal top flats and a round bottom rather than three octagonal bottom flats. It has six &quot;sides&quot; but is neither hexagonal nor octagonal in normal use of those terms.) Early production 91/30s (from 1930 to 1936) and converted Dragoon rifles retained the octagonal receiver. These rifles are less common and regarded as generally more desirable by collectors.
** A hooded post front sight, replacing the blade on previous weapons.

* Model 1938 Carbine: A carbine based on the M1891/30 design that was produced from 1939 to 1945 at the Izhevsk arsenal and in 1940 and 1944 at Tula. They were intended for use by second-echelon and noncombatant troops. Very few M38 carbines were made in 1945 and are highly sought after by collectors. Essentially a M1891/30 with a shortened barrel and shortened stock (the M38 is 1000 millimeters (40 in) in overall length versus 1230 millimeters (48 in) overall length for the Model 91/30), this carbine did not accept a bayonet and was in fact designed so that the standard Model 91/30 bayonet would not fit it. However many M38 carbines were fitted into M44 stocks by the Soviets as a wartime expedient. M38s in the correct M38 stock command a premium over M38s in M44 pattern stocks. The M38 was replaced by the M44 carbine in 1944.
* Model 1944 Carbine: This carbine was introduced into service in late 1944 (with 50,000 service-test examples produced in 1943) and remained in production until 1948. They were produced from 1943 to 1948 at the Izhevsk arsenal and only 1944 at Tula. Its specifications are very similar to the M1938, with the unique addition of a permanently affixed, side-folding cruciform-spike bayonet. A groove for the folded bayonet is inlet into the right side of the stock. From February 1944, this type of carbine was issued to Red Army infantry troops as a replacement for the standard rifle. These were in use not only by the Soviet Union, but also its various satellite nations. Many of these were counterbored post-war.
* Model 1891/59 Carbine: Commonly called &quot;91/59s,&quot; the M1891/59s were created by shortening M1891/30 rifles to carbine length, with rear sight numbers partially ground off to reflect reduced range. These rifles are almost clones of the M38 except for the ground off M91/30 rear sight. The &quot;1891/59&quot; marking on the receiver suggests the carbines were created in or after 1959. It was initially thought that Bulgaria or another Soviet satellite country performed the conversions in preparation for a Western invasion that never came. Recent evidence suggests that the M91/59 was indeed produced in Bulgaria from Soviet-supplied wartime production M91/30s. Total production of the 91/59 is uncertain; figures as low as one million and as high as three million have appeared in firearm literature.
* AV: Soviet target rifle
* OTs-48/OTs-48K: The OTs-48/OTs-48K (ОЦ-48К) sniper rifle was designed around 2000 in an attempt to make use of many surplus Mosin M1891/30 rifles which were still held in storage in Russia. Developed and manufactured &quot;on order&quot; by Central Design Bureau for Sporting and Hunting Arms (TSKIB SOO) in the city of Tula, this rifle is still in limited use by some Russian law enforcement agencies today.

===Estonia===
After the Estonian War of Independence, Estonia had around 120,000 M/1891s in stock, later the &quot;Kaitseliit&quot;, the Estonian Defence League, received some Finnish M28/30 rifles, a few modernised variants were also made by the Estonian Armory;
* M1933 or 1891/33 was standard rifle of Estonian armed forces.
* M1938: a further variant of M1933, 12,000 rifles.
* KL300: a variant for Kaitseliit, 4,025 were made.
* M1935 &quot;Lühendatud sõjapüss M1935&quot;: &quot;shortened rifle M1935&quot; was a shortened variant of M1933 with 600mm barrel, 6,770 rifles.

===Finland===



Most Finnish rifles were assembled by SAKO, Tikkakoski Oy, or VKT (Valtion Kivääritehdas, State Rifle Factory, after the wars part of Valtion Metallitehtaat (Valmet), State Metalworks). The Finnish cartridge 7.62×53mmR is a slightly modified variation of the Russian 7.62×54mmR, and is considered interchangeable with 54R. However, the older version of the Finnish military cartridge was loaded with the S-type bullet that had nominal diameter of .308. In 1936 the Finnish Army fielded a new standard service cartridge intended for both machine guns and rifles. This new cartridge was loaded with a new bullet designed in 1934–the D-166, which had a nominal diameter of .310. The new service rifle m/39 was designed from the start around the D-166, thus it had nominal barrel diameter of .310.

Handloaded cartridges for Finnish rifles should however use a bullet for use with other Finnish Mosin–Nagant variants instead of the one which gives best results in M/39, Soviet and most of other Mosin–Nagant rifles.
* M/91: When Finland achieved independence from Russia, over 190,000 Model 1891 infantry rifles were already stockpiled in the ex-Russian military depots within Finland. As a result, the rifle was adopted as the standard Finnish Army weapon, and surplus Mosin–Nagants were purchased from other European nations which had captured them during World War I. These rifles were overhauled to meet Finnish Army standards and designated M/91. In the mid-1920s Tikkakoski made new barrels for m/91s. Later starting in 1940, Tikkakoski and VKT began production of new M/91 rifles. VKT production ceased in 1942 in favor of the newer M/39 rifle, but Tikkakoski production continued through 1944. The M/91 was the most widely issued Finnish rifle in both the Winter War and the Continuation War.
* M/91rv: A cavalry rifle built from former Russian Model 1891 Dragoon rifles, modified with a sling slot based on the German Karabiner 98a. The original Russian sling slots were also retained.
* M/24: The &quot;Lotta Rifle&quot;, the Model 24 or Model 1891/24 was the first large-scale Mosin–Nagant upgrade project undertaken by the Finnish Suojeluskunta (Civil Guard), and there were, in fact three separate variations of the rifle. Barrels were produced by SIG (Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft) and by a German consortium. Swiss-produced barrels could be found in both standard Mosin–Nagant 1891 contour and in a heavier contour designed for improved accuracy, while all German-produced barrels were heavy weight barrels. The initial contract for the SIG-produced barrels was let on April 10, 1923, and was for 3,000 new barrels produced with the original Model 1891 barrel contour. A subsequent contract for 5,000 additional heavier barrels, stepped at the muzzle end to accept the standard Mosin–Nagant bayonet, was let the next year. The German contracts, starting in 1924 and running to 1926, were all for the heavier, stepped barrels with two contracts: one for 5,000 barrels and a second for 8,000 barrels. The German-made barrels are marked on the under side of the chamber. All Model 24s are marked with the Civil Guard logo of three fir tree sprigs over a capital &quot;S&quot;. All Model 24s are equipped with a coil spring around the trigger pin to improve the trigger pull and thus the accuracy of the rifle. The Model 24 was called the Lotta&#x27;s Rifle () after the women&#x27;s auxiliary of the Civil Guard, known as the Lotta Svärd which was instrumental in raising funds to purchase and repair or refurbish some 10,000 rifles.
* M/27: The Model 27 was the Finnish Army&#x27;s first almost complete reworking of the Model 1891, it was nicknamed (&quot;spitz&quot;) for the front sight protector&#x27;s resemblance to the upright ears of a spitz dog. The receiver and magazine of the 1891 were retained, but a new shorter-length heavy-weight barrel at was fitted. The sights were modified. The receivers and bolts were modified with &quot;wings&quot; being fitted to the bolt connecting bars that fit into slots machined into the receivers. The stocks were initially produced by cutting down 1891 stocks and opening up the barrel channels to accommodate the heavier barrel. New barrel bands and nose caps were fitted and a new bayonet was issued. The modified stocks proved to be weak, breaking when soldiers practiced bayonet fighting or firing with the bayonet fitted. These and other problems resulted in a slow-down of production in the mid-1930s while solutions to problems were engineered and existing stocks of rifles were modified. Produced from mid-1927 to 1940, the Model 27 was the Finnish Army&#x27;s main battle rifle in the Winter War.
* M/27rv: A cavalry carbine version of the M27 (rv is short for , ), 2217 were made, and were assigned to the most elite Finnish cavalry units. As a result of their heavy use, nearly half were lost over the course of the Winter and Continuation Wars. Most of the surviving examples were deemed beyond repair and scrapped, with slightly over 300 still existing. This makes it the rarest of all Finnish Mosin–Nagant models.
* M/28: A variant designed by the White Guard. The M/28 differs from the Army&#x27;s M/27 primarily in the barrel band design, which is a single piece compared to the M/27&#x27;s hinged band, and an improved trigger design. Barrels for the M/28 were initially purchased from SIG, and later from Tikkakoski and SAKO.
* M/28–30: An upgraded version of the M/28. The most noticeable modification is the new rear sight design. The same sight was used in following M/39 rifle only exception being &quot;1.5&quot; marking for closest range to clarify it for users. According to micrometer measurements and comparison to modern Lapua D46/47 bullet radar trajectory data, markings are matched to Finnish Lapua D46/D46 bullet surprisingly accurately through whole adjustment range between 150 m and 2000 m.The trigger was also improved by adding coil spring to minimize very long pre-travel. Following M/39 does not have this improvement. The magazine was also modified to prevent jamming. Magazines were stamped with &quot;HV&quot; (, ) letters in right side of rifle. Later M/39 uses identical design, but without the &quot;HV&quot; stamp. M/28–30 also have metal sleeve in fore-end of handguard, to reduce barrel harmonics change and to make barrel-stock contact more constant between shots and/or during environmental changes such as moisture and temperature. Later M/39 does not have this upgrade.In addition to its military usage, approximately 440 M/28–30 rifles were manufactured by SAKO for use in the 1937 World Shooting Championships in Helsinki.M/28–30 model, serial number 60974, was also used by Simo Häyhä, a well-known Finnish sniper. M/28–30 was used as Civil Guards competition rifle before World War II, as was the case with Simo Häyhä&#x27;s personal rifle. Therefore, rifles were built very well, with highest grade barrels available and carefully matched headspace. Häyhä&#x27;s rifle was still at PKarPr (Northern Karelia Brigade) museum in 2002, then moved to an unknown place by the Finnish Army.
* M/91–35: A model proposed by the Finnish Army to replace both its M/27 and the White Guard&#x27;s M/28 and M/28–30 rifles. The White Guard strongly objected to this plan, considering the M91/35 to have poor accuracy and excessive muzzle flash. It was never adopted, instead being supplanted by the M/39.
* M/39: nicknamed after the former President Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, a compromise between the Army and White Guard, adopted so as to standardize Mosin–Nagant production. The M/39 was derived largely from the M/28–30, but included some alterations proposed by the Army. The M/39 also incorporated a semi-pistol grip into the stock, though some early examples used typical Mosin–Nagant straight stocks. Only 10 rifles were completed by the end of the Winter War, but 96,800 were produced after the Winter War and used in the Continuation War. Small numbers were assembled from leftover parts in the late 1960s through 1973, bringing the total production to approximately 102,000.
* M/30: Tikkakoski produced improved, high-quality Model 1891/30 rifles in 1943 and 1944, designated M/30, using new barrels and parts from some of the almost 125,000 1891/30s captured in the Winter and Continuation Wars as well as 57,000 rifles bought from the Germans in 1944 (most of which were only suitable for use as parts donors). They were produced with both one- and two-piece stocks and either Soviet globe or Finnish blade foresights.
* M/56: An experimental 7.62×39mm version.
* M/28–57: A military target rifle for sporting purposes with diopter sights, built in two variants from existing accurate M/28–30 rifles, a CISM 300 m standard rifle version, and a biathlon version with a purpose made stock, designated as M/28–57 H.
* M/27–66 A military target rifle for CISM 300 m standard rifle competition, which used existing receivers, bolts and triggers from M/27, but had the receiver walls reinforced, some bolt parts modified, new barrels and new target rifle stocks from walnut as well as diopter sights installed. Modification of the rifles was made by Valmet. Some were also equipped with scope bases to be used as sniper rifles, but without any further modifications from the standard model.
* M/28–76: A dual purpose sniper rifle and target rifle for CISM 300 m standard rifle competition. They were modified from existing M/28–30 and M/28–57 rifles, using the M/28–30 barrel and sights (often with new barrels, but sometimes original from M/28–30) and new birch wood stocks of the same profile as the M/27–66. The target rifle version had a diopter rear sight added and a modified front sight, while the sniper rifle version had a scope base. Modification work for the rifles was carried out by Finnish Defence Forces (&#x27;Arsenal 1&#x27;) in Kuopio.
* M/85: A more comprehensive modernisation based on the Mosin-Nagant action, which features an aluminium bedding block between the stock and the barreled action, attached to the stem of the barrel, while letting the receiver and further barrel float free of the stock. In addition to the changes to the stock, an entirely new trigger pack was designed and the lock time was shortened by removing the safety from the striker assembly of the bolt. The M/85 was built in two variants, the TKIV 85 sniper rifle, and a target rifle for CISM 300 m standard rifle competition: the sniper rifle features a heavy barrel without iron sights and a birch wood stock with an adjustable cheek rest, a bipod and an enclosed fore-end with the upper handguard lifted off the barrel to free-float the barrel past the bedding block, whereas the target rifle features a lighter barrel, diopter sights and a walnut stock without the upper handguard. Although, for possible use in war, a spare sniper version stock was supplied with every target rifle. Modification of existing parts (receiver and bolt assembly) as well as production of new metal parts was carried out by Valmet, and the stocks were made and rifles assembled by FDF . 

===Czechoslovakia===
* VZ91/38 carbine: Very similar to the M91/59, it is an M38-style carbine produced by cutting down Model 1891 infantry, dragoon, and Cossack rifles. Few of these carbines exist, and the reason for their creation remains unclear. Like the M44, they have a bayonet groove cut into the right side of the stock, despite there being no evidence that the VZ91/38 design ever included a bayonet. The front sight features a wide base similar to post World War II M44s.
* VZ54 sniper rifle: Based on the M1891/30, although it has the appearance of a modern sporting firearm. The VZ54 utilizes a Czech-made 2.5× magnification scope, as well as a unique rear sight. It also borrows some features from the Mauser design, such as locking screws and a K98k-style front sight hood.
* VZ54/91 sniper rifle: Updated version of the VZ54 sniper rifle. The VZ54/91 utilizes an adjustable biathlon style stock with fully adjustable comb and butt plate. A rail beneath the forearm accepts adjustable sling swivels as well as a bipod. A Soviet manufactured PSO-1 scope also used on the SVD Dragunov sniper rifle is mounted on a side plate. It retains the front and rear sights of the VZ54.

===China===

* Type 53: A license-built version of the post-war Soviet M1944 carbine. As many of the carbines imported to the United States are constructed of both local Chinese parts and surplus Soviet parts, there is much debate as to when this mixture occurred. Type 53s are found both with and without the permanently attached folding bayonet, though the former is far more common. The Chinese Type 53 carbine saw extensive service with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army from 1953 until the late 1950s/early 1960s when the PLA went over to the Chinese Type 56 carbine and the Chinese Type 56 assault rifle. Many Type 53 carbines were given to the People&#x27;s Militia in China and to North Vietnam (with many carbines ending up in the hands of the National Liberation Front in South Vietnam) and to the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia during the 1960s and 1970s. The People&#x27;s Militia used the Type 53 until 1982 when they were replaced with modern weapons. There is some evidence that the Type 53 carbine saw extensive use in the hands of the People&#x27;s Militia during the years of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution (with many members of the Red Guards being armed and trained by both the People&#x27;s Militia and the PLA during the Cultural Revolution). A significant number of Type 53 carbines were given to Albania and a few African countries as military aid by the Chinese during the 1960s. Some of these carbines appeared in the hands of the Kosovo Liberation Army during the late 1990s.
*T53 Single Shot Initial Bullet Speed Testing Carbine: This very rare variant in 7.62×39 was a purposely built single shot carbine chambered for the testing the 7.62×39 cartridge. The only known examples of this carbine have a barrel shank marking of 1960.11, indicating it was made in the November 1960 time frame. There are only two known examples of these carbines that were exported out of China to the USA. The carbine has a blued finish, 20.5&quot; barrel, hooded post front sight, fixed rear sight, straight bolt handle, smooth wood handguard, straight grip shoulder stock with finger groove forend and smooth metal butt plate. The 7.62×39 cartridge is manually loaded into the chamber. The bolt is a standard Mosin–Nagant bolt with modified bolt head to center cartridge in chamber.

===Hungary===
* Mosin–Nagant Model 1948 Infantry Rifle Gyalogsági Puska, 48.M (48.Minta): Produced by the FÉG (Fémáru- Fegyver- és Gépgyár Rt.) plant in Budapest, these high-quality versions of the Soviet Model 1891/30 were produced from 1949 to possibly as late as 1955. They are characterized by a high-quality finish and the marking of all parts with the &quot;02&quot; stamp.
* (FÉG) manufactured a M1891 sniper version based on the 48 in the 1950s. This model was used extensively by the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) during the Vietnam War.
* M/52: A direct copy of the original Soviet Model 1891/30 sniper rifle. Identifying features include:
** Darkly blued steel and high quality machining.
** An &quot;02&quot; stamp on every component of the rifle, identifying it as manufactured in Hungary.
* M44 Pattern: Domestically produced version of post war pattern Soviet M44 Carbine marked &quot;02&quot;.

===Romania===
* Triangular shaped markings, some with an arrow inside, on many components of the rifle. Normally three &quot;R&quot;&#x27;s surrounded by crossed stalks with leaves pointing outwards are on the top of the breech. Year stamps are quite visible. The trigger assembly is unique in the Romanian 91/30 and is adjustable. It is not interchangeable with other Mosins.
* M44 Pattern: Domestically produced version of post war pattern Soviet M44 Carbine during the years 1953 to 1955. Variances to the Soviet pattern produced minor differences.
* Suppressed M44 Pattern: Domestically produced adaptation of the M44, with a long integral suppressor and an LPS 4×6° TIP2 telescopic sight, same as the one used on the PSL rifle. Only a small number were modified, for use with the USLA – a very small counter-terrorism unit of the Securitate
* M91/30 Pattern: Domestically produced version Soviet pattern M91 during the year 1955. Some of the guns are marked &quot;INSTRUCTIE&quot; and held in reserve for a secondary line of defense in case of invasion. The Instructie mark is typically, but not always, accompanied by a broad red band on the buttstock. Some collectors do not consider these safe to fire, but most appear to be in good working order although well worn and somewhat neglected. The &quot;EXERCITIU&quot; mark is found on rifles that seem to have been used specifically for training purposes only. The &quot;EXERCITIU&quot; rifles are easily recognized by the black paint on the entire butt of the stock. They are not intended to be fired since the firing pin is clipped and many times parts critical to their proper function are missing.

===United States===
* Russian three-line rifle, caliber 7.62mm (.30 inches): Due to the desperate shortage of arms and the shortcomings of a still-developing domestic industry, the Russian government ordered 1.5 million M1891 infantry rifles from Remington Arms and another 1.8 million from New England Westinghouse in the United States. Most of these rifles were not delivered before the outbreak of the October Revolution and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk which ended hostilities between the Central Powers and Soviet Russia. When the Bolsheviks formed a new government, they defaulted on the Imperial Russian contracts with the American arsenals, with the result that New England Westinghouse and Remington were stuck with hundreds of thousands of Mosin–Nagants. The US government bought up the remaining stocks, saving Remington and Westinghouse from bankruptcy. The rifles in Great Britain armed the US and British expeditionary forces sent to North Russia in 1918 and 1919. The rifles still in the US ended up being primarily used as training firearms for the US Army. Some were used to equip US National Guard, SATC and ROTC units. Collectors have taken to calling these rifles, &quot;U.S. Magazine Rifle, 7.62mm, Model of 1916&quot;, though no official source for this designation has ever been cited. Ordnance documents refer to the rifles as &quot;Russian three-line rifle, caliber 7.62mm (.30 inches)&quot;. In 1917, 50,000 of these rifles were sent via Vladivostok to equip the Czechoslovak Legions in Siberia to aid in their attempt to secure passage to France. During the interwar period, the rifles which had been taken over by the US military were sold to private citizens in the United States by the Director of Civilian Marksmanship, the predecessor agency to the current Civilian Marksmanship Program. They were sold for the sum of $3.00 each. If unaltered to chamber the US standard .30-06 Springfield rimless cartridge, these rifles are prized by collectors because they do not have the import marks required by law to be stamped or engraved on military surplus firearms brought into the United States from other countries

===Ukraine===
* : In 2015, the Ukrainian state-owned developed a modernized M1891/30 sniper rifle. It has an aluminum alloy and polymer composite stock, detachable magazine, the Picatinny rail for mounting optical sights, a folding telescopic bipod, and can be fitted with a muzzle brake or suppressor. The prototype was demonstrated on 13 November 2015. On 18 March 2016, ten rifles were delivered for testing to the Sniper Training Center of the National Guard of Ukraine.
==Civilian use==
Mosin–Nagants have been exported from Finland since the 1960s as its military modernized and decommissioned the rifles. Most of these have ended up as inexpensive surplus for Western nations.

In the USSR surplus military carbines (without bayonet) were sold as civilian hunting weapons. Also, the Mosin–Nagant action has been used to produce a limited number of commercial rifles, the most famous are the Vostok brand target rifles exported in Europe in the 1960s and 1970s chambered in the standard 7.62×54mmR round and in 6.5×54mmR, a necked-down version of the original cartridge designed for long range target shooting. Rifles in 6.5×54mmR use a necked-down 7.62×54mmR cartridge and were the standard rifle of the USSR&#x27;s Olympic biathlon team until the International Olympic Committee revised the rules of the event to reduce the range to 50 meters and required all competitors to use rifles chambered in .22 LR.

A number of the Model 1891s produced by New England Westinghouse and Remington were sold to private citizens in the United States by the U.S. government through the Director of Civilian Marksmanship Program in the interwar period. Many of these American-made Mosin–Nagants were rechambered by wholesalers to the American .30-06 Springfield cartridge.

With the fall of the Iron Curtain, a large quantity of Mosin–Nagants have found their way onto markets outside of Russia as collectibles and hunting rifles. Due to the large surplus created by the Soviet small arms industry during World War II and the tendency of the former Soviet Union to retain and store large quantities of old but well-preserved surplus (long after other nations&#x27; militaries divested themselves of similar vintage materials), these rifles (mostly M1891/30 rifles and M1944 carbines) are inexpensive compared to other surplus arms of the same era.

<text>Newington is a district of South London, just south of the River Thames, and part of the London Borough of Southwark. It was an ancient parish and the site of the early administration of the county of Surrey. It was the location of the County of London Sessions House from 1917, in a building now occupied by the Inner London Crown Court.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The name means &quot;new farmstead&quot; to refer to a newer part of the manor of Walworth. It lay on the old Roman road from London to West Sussex, specifically directly to Chichester (also linking to London/Westminster much of Surrey including Kingston and Guildford) (this was one of the Stane Streets). The proximity to London meant stalls, stables and stores were by the late medieval period numerous. The first mention of Newington (or Neweton) occurs in the Testa de Nevill (a survey of feudal tenure officially known as the Book of Fees compiled 1198–1242) during the reign of Henry III, wherein it is stated that &quot;the queen&#x27;s goldsmith holds of the king one acre of land in Neweton, by the service of rendering a gallon of honey&quot;. In 1313 it is mentioned again in the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s Register as &quot;Newington juxta London&quot;. The name survives now in the street names Newington Causeway and Newington Butts and in the open space Newington Gardens, on the site of Horsemonger Lane Gaol (1791–1878).

Newington as a ward currently is a name for one of the equal-electorate drawn divisions of councillors of the London Borough of Southwark, covering from Walworth Road up to the borough&#x27;s western limit with South Lambeth, Lambeth.

===Urban development===

The area remained as a farming village with a low level of population until the second half of the 18th century. There was a little industry, for example, the manufacture of clay pipes for tobacco smoking. In William Shakespeare&#x27;s time, there was a theatre called Newington Butts and later there were further theatres. Newington gained in importance with the creation of the Westminster Bridge in 1750 and the associated improvements of London Bridge which required a series of new roads across St George&#x27;s Fields to interconnect the routes from them and allow traffic from the Georgian West End to travel south and to Southwark without transitting through the City. These routes were Westminster Bridge Road and Borough Road for the West End and Southwark; for the route to the south London Road and St George&#x27;s Road supplemented and by-passed the Borough High Street and Newington Causeway. All of these roads converged at a junction where there was a blacksmith&#x27;s forge and inn called Elephant and Castle which then became a name to signify the area. Traffic heading to the south-east from the West End was connected to the older route from the City of London and Southwark to Kent as New Kent Road from Newington to a junction with the older route at the Bricklayers Arms. New roads brought development opportunities. The local landowner, Henry Penton (Member of Parliament (MP) for Winchester), started to sell some of his farmland. The 19th century brought more dense speculative house building, and some philanthropic provision too. The Trinity House Newington Estate, laid out on property the institution was left in the seventeenth century, became a high class residential district which is still largely in existence. It was built around an 1820s classical church by Francis Octavius Bedford.

Further urban stimulus was given by the arrival of mainline railway routes from the City to the south, the London, Chatham and Dover Railway built a station at Elephant and Castle in 1863. In 1890 the City and South London Railway (now the Northern line City Branch of London Underground) was projected through the area with stations at what was termed &#x27;Kennington&#x27; (but in fact within Newington) and also at Elephant. In 1906 the new Bakerloo line terminated at the Elephant also.

===Local governance===
The parish of Newington St Mary was part of the Brixton Hundred of Surrey and this contained all of the manor of Walworth. Before the creation of elected County Councils, in 1889, the county Magistrates were responsible for ensuring compliance with local bye-laws and ordinances, so that with the creation of the new Surrey County Sessions House at Newington Causeway in 1792 Newington was the County Town, until Kingston on Thames was designated as such in 1893. In 1855 it came within the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works and the parish vestry was incorporated as a local authority. In 1889 it became part of the County of London. There was a reorganisation of local government in 1900 and the parish became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark and the vestry was abolished. The civil parish was finally abolished in 1930. The parish was of and the population peaked in 1901 at 121,863.

Newington is a ward within the London Borough of Southwark and the Parliamentary seat of Bermondsey and Old Southwark. It is represented by Councillors Eleanor Kerslake and Alice Macdonald of the Labour Party and James Coldwell, Independent.

==Ecclesiastical parish==
The ancient parish, dedicated to St Mary, was in the Diocese of Winchester until 1877, then the Diocese of Rochester until 1905, since when it is in the Diocese of Southwark. From 1826, as the population of Newington increased, ten new parishes were formed:
* Holy Trinity, Newington in 1826
* St Peter, Walworth in 1826
* St Paul, Newington in 1857
* St John, Walworth in 1860
* All Saints, Newington in 1866
* St Matthew, Newington in 1868
* St Mark, Walworth in 1870
* St Stephen, Walworth Common in 1871
* All Souls, Grosvenor Park in 1871
* St Andrew, Newington in 1877

Small parts of the above augmented other parishes, later:
* St Agnes, Kennington Park in 1874 &quot;with parts of St Mary, Lambeth&quot;
* St Mark, Camberwell in 1880 &quot;with parts of St Giles, Camberwell&quot;

Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; as such the incorporated vestry of St Mary Newington was divided into four wards (electing vestrymen): No. 1 or St Mary&#x27;s (18), No. 2 or Trinity (18), No. 3 or St Paul&#x27;s (15) and No. 4 or St Peter&#x27;s (21).

In 1894 as its population had increased the incorporated vestry was re-divided into five wards (electing vestrymen): St Mary&#x27;s (15), St Paul&#x27;s (12), St Peter&#x27;s (15), St John&#x27;s (18) and Trinity (12).






In May 2019, Coldwell resigned from Labour in opposition to the then leader Jeremy Corbyn and the parties stance on Brexit. He now sits as an Independent.








==People==
The scientist Michael Faraday was born in Newington Butts, in 1791. Charles Babbage the promoter of the first computing machine was born in Walworth Road; William Jowett, a 19th-century missionary and author, was born in Newington in 1787, Also born in Newington, in Surrey Square in 1805, was the English artist Samuel Palmer, as was William Swainson, the ornithologist and natural history artist (1789–1855) and Tom Smith (1823–1869), the creator of the Christmas cracker.

<doc id="94190" wikidata="Q440346" url="?curid=94190" title="Harald Sverdrup (oceanographer)">
<text>Harald Ulrik Sverdrup (15 November 1888 – 21 August 1957) was a Norwegian oceanographer and meteorologist. He served as director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Norwegian Polar Institute.

==Background==
He was born at Sogndal in Sogn og Fjordane, Norway.
He was the son of Lutheran theologian Edvard Sverdrup (1861–1923) and Maria Vollan (1865–1891). His sister Mimi Sverdrup Lunden (1894–1955) was an educator and author. His brother Leif Sverdrup (1898–1976) was a General with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. His brother 
Einar Sverdrup (1895–1942) was CEO of Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani.

Sverdrup was a student at Bergen Cathedral School in 1901 before graduating in 1906 at Kongsgård School in Stavanger. He graduated cand. real. in 1914 from University of Oslo. He studied under Vilhelm Bjerknes and earned his Dr. Philos. at the University of Leipzig in 1917.

==Career==
He was the scientific director of the North Polar expedition of Roald Amundsen aboard the &quot;Maud&quot; from 1918 to 1925. His measurements of bottom depths, tidal currents, and tidal elevations on the vast shelf areas off the East Siberian Sea correctly described the propagation of tides as Poincare waves. Upon his return from this long expedition exploring the shelf seas to the north of Siberia, he became the chair in meteorology at the University of Bergen.

He was made director of California&#x27;s Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1936, initially for three years but the intervention of World War II meant he held the post until 1948. During 33 expeditions with the research vessel &quot;E. W. Scripps&quot; between 1938 and 1941, he produced a detailed oceanographic dataset off the coast of California. He also developed a simple theory of the general ocean circulation postulating a dynamical vorticity balance between the wind-stress curl and the meridional gradient of the Coriolis parameter, the Sverdrup balance. This balance describes wind-driven ocean gyres away from continental margins at western boundaries.

After leaving Scripps, he became director of the Norwegian Polar Institute in Oslo and continued to contribute to oceanography, ocean biology, and polar research. In biological oceanography, his critical depth hypothesis (published in 1953) was a significant milestone in the explanation of spring blooms of phytoplankton.

Sverdrup was a member of both the United States National Academy of Sciences, the Norwegian Academies of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. He served as President of the International Association of Physical Oceanography and of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). His many publications include his magnum opus &quot;The Oceans: Their Physics, Chemistry and General Biology&quot; by Sverdrup, Martin W. Johnson and Richard H. Fleming (1942, new edition 1970) which formed the basic curriculum of oceanography for the next 40 years around the world.

==Personal life==
In 1928, he married Gudrun (Vaumund) Bronn (1893–1983) and adopted her daughter Anna Margrethe.

==Honors==
He was awarded the William Bowie Medal by the American Geophysical Union, the Alexander Agassiz Medal of the National Academy of Sciences, the Patron&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society, the Vega Medal by the Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography and the Swedish Order of the Polar Star.

==Legacy==

The Sverdrup, a unit describing the volume of water transport in ocean currents, is named after Harald Sverdrup. 1 Sverdrup is a volume flux of one million cubic meters per second (1 Sv = 106 m3 per second).

The Sverdrup Gold Medal Award was named in his honor by the  American Meteorological Society.

The Norwegian research vessel is named in his honor.

In 1977, the UK-APC named a series of peaks in Palmer Land, Antarctica the Sverdrup Nunataks after him.

<text>Norbiton is an area within the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, London. It lies approximately east of Kingston upon Thames town centre, and from Charing Cross. Its main landmarks include Kingston Hospital, Kingsmeadow football stadium, Kingston Cemetery and St Peter&#x27;s Anglican parish church which serves the area.

Norbiton was part of the Municipal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames from its creation in 1835, and became part of the larger Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames in 1965.

==History==

Its name was originally Norberton(e) and it was named in a similar way to Surbiton on the opposite side of the Hogsmill River. The origin of the place-name is from the Old English words &quot;north&quot;, &quot;bere&quot; and &quot;tun&quot; (meaning northern grange or outlying farm).

The area was originally a part of the parish of All Saints Church, Kingston upon Thames. In 1840 a separate Norbiton parish was created, with St Peter&#x27;s Church built between 1840 and 1842 to a design of Gilbert Scott and William Moffatt.

Until the mid-nineteenth century much of Norbiton was made up of country estates, all since sold as housing land. These included:

Norbiton Hall, a manor from the 16th century. Residents included Richard Taverner, who lived there 1547–75 and Sir Anthony Benn, 1605–18. In 1829, the Surrey MP Charles Pallmer sold the estate to Mary, Countess of Liverpool, widow of the late prime minister Lord Liverpool. It was finally demolished in the 1930s to make way for a complex of flats, also called Norbiton Hall. These flats were built between 1933 and 1935 and received local listing in 2018.

Norbiton Place was bought by Sir John Philipps, who died there in 1764. One of the family&#x27;s servants was Cesar Picton, originally an African slave, he was brought to England aged six in 1761. He lived at Norbiton Place for nearly thirty years, before becoming a successful coal-merchant in Kingston. In the early 1800s Norbiton Place became the main residence of Charles Pallmer, owner of neighbouring Norbiton Hall. Pallmer greatly developed the estate, including adding a dairy styled like an Indian temple and a lodge in the form of a doric temple. Living above his means, Pallmer was declared bankrupt in 1831. Much of the main house was pulled down after 1830, with St Peter&#x27;s Church built on part of the grounds.

Kingston Lodge, opposite Norbiton Hall, was leased by Novelist George Meredith in 1865. Disliking the increasing development of the area, he moved away at the end of 1867.

==Norbiton today==
Norbiton&#x27;s housing stock largely consists of large Victorian and Edwardian family houses, plus small localised brownfield redevelopments of 1960s, 1980s and modern flats. It contains more council and social housing than most other areas of Kingston – one of the largest such sites, the Cambridge Road estate, was used as a fictional council estate in TV drama &quot;The Bill&quot;, as well as the BBC sitcom &quot;Some Girls&quot;. In 2020 plans were agreed to regenerate the Cambridge Road estate, including demolishing 865 existing homes and building 2,170 new ones. Homes on the renewed estate will obtain heating by a process that turns treated sewage into clean energy, the first such scheme in England.

As Norbiton is only 25 minutes by train from Waterloo station, the suburban population includes a large concentration of London commuters. Norbiton railway station was used as a location for the British sitcom &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot;. The headquarters of the Fire Brigades Union is located close to the station, on Coombe Road.

Kingsmeadow football stadium in Norbiton was bought by Chelsea FC in 2016 and has been used for the home matches of Chelsea F.C. Women since 2017. It was previously used as a home ground by Kingstonian F.C. (1989–2017) and by AFC Wimbledon (2002–20).

In the 2018 Kingston borough elections, both council seats in Norbiton ward were gained by the Liberal Democrats from Labour, leaving Labour with no seats on the council.

<doc id="94194" wikidata="Q83399" url="?curid=94194" title="Northolt">
<text>Northolt is a town in West London, England, spread across both sides of the A40 trunk road. It is west-northwest of Charing Cross and is one of the seven major towns that make up the London Borough of Ealing and a smaller part in the London Borough of Harrow It had a population of 30,304 at the 2011 UK census.

==History==
The earliest record of Northolt is in 872 as the Anglo Saxon &quot;norð healum&quot;, where norð is North and healum (or hale) is &quot;a nook, corner, or retreat&quot;. By 1610, the Name Northolt appears, with in this case, holt having no relationship with &#x27;wood&#x27;, but an evolution of hala, hale, hal, hall, halle and holt.

Archaeological evidence suggests that the settlement&#x27;s origin was an 8th-century Saxon village close to Northolt Manor behind the present Court Farm Road. It is mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as Northala, part of the Elthorne Hundred in the historic county of Middlesex, England. In 1066 the lord was Esger the constable, and in 1086 was Geoffrey de Mandeville. Northolt Manor itself was built in the fourteenth century and provides much of the archeological information of the area from its excavations in the 1950s and onward. A Tudor barn built in 1595 from Smith&#x27;s farm in Northolt was moved to Chiltern Open Air Museum and is now on display there. In the early part of the 18th century farmland was enclosed in order to provide hay for the City of London, alongside more traditional crops such as peas and beans. Up to late Victorian times, the area was rural with predominantly arable crops being grown.

1795 saw parliamentary approval for construction of Paddington Arm of the Grand Junction Canal later becoming part of the Grand Union Canal. The route from Hayes to Paddington passes through Northolt, opening on 10 July 1801. The Great Central Railway line (now the Chiltern Line) opened in 1906, passing through Northolt on its way from Marylebone to High Wycombe. However, it wasn&#x27;t until 1926 that a station opened at Northolt Park. 1906 also saw the Great Western Railway&#x27;s New North Main Line pass through south of Great Central Railway on its way to Birmingham. The following year Northolt Halt opened on it, eventually becoming Northolt station. In 1948 an extension to the Central line, transformed it into Northolt tube station.

In May 1915 the Royal Flighing Corp established an airfield in neighbouring South Ruislip in the London Borough of Hillingdon, Most early RAF airfields were named after the nearest railway station; in this case Northolt Junction, (now South Ruislip), so it became RAF Northolt. 

WW1 also brought an urgent need for more munitions, and in 1915 the Ministry of Munitions created many national munition factories. The National Filling Factory No 7 in Hayes, Middlesex had an explosives magazine at Northolt which was completed late in 1916. This 93 acre site had 20 stores each able to hold 100 tons of explosives, and was connected by a rail spur at Northolt Junction station. The location was just North-East of the current Ruislip Gardens station, with the rail spur on the south side of Yeading Brook, and the magazines connected by trolleyways on the North side. About 100 tons of explosives per day were sent by rail to Hayes for filling artillery shells - both the Hayes factory and the magazine were removed after the war ended.

Suburban development began in the 1920s. Most of the housing north of the Western Avenue was built in the 1920s–1930s, and is in the private housing sector. Most of the housing built to the south of the Western Avenue was built in the 1960s–1970s, and is in the social housing sectors, particularly along the Kensington and Ruislip Roads.

Two important transport links run through Northolt: the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal and the modern A40 road.

In the 21st century, a new large private housing development was built on the former site of the Taylor Woodrow company, adjacent to the Grand Union Canal. This development is known as &quot;Grand Union Village&quot; and incorporates a new canal boat marina.

==Landmarks==
*St Mary the Virgin church (14th century) stands on the hill overlooking the old village. The Welsh poet Goronwy Owen was briefly a curate here. Bishop Samuel Lisle is buried here.
*In the centre of the village is a freestanding clock tower erected to commemorate the coronation of George VI in 1937.
*The White Hart public house is on the site of an old coaching inn. The roundabout immediately south of it is on the junction of the A312 (Church Road and Hayes Bypass) with the A4180 (Ruislip Road and West End Road). The Yeading Lane also joins the roundabout. (Now closed)
*Willow Cottages on the village green are said to have been built of bricks from the old manor house, which once stood behind the parish church.
*The two towers of the disused RAF radio station north of the town are situated in the Wood End wireless station recreation ground, which is bordered on all sides by housing (Bayshill Rise, Lancaster Road, Blenheim road). The location is now home to a National Air Traffic Control base.
*Northala Fields is a large area alongside the A40 road which has been redeveloped as an extension to the Northolt and Greenford Country Park. The development consists of four large, man-made conical hills (built of rubble from the first Wembley Stadium), which act as a sound barrier to block traffic noise from the Western Avenue. Behind the mounds are new ponds and a visitor centre.
*The Larkspur Rovers F.C. clubhouse is in Rowdell Road, Northolt. It received funding from Ealing Council and an Olympic legacy grant of £50,000 from Sport England&#x27;s Inspired Facilities Fund.
*There is a village community centre building in Ealing Road, opposite St Mary&#x27;s church, which incorporates an open-air miniature railway.
*A leisure centre, incorporating a pool, a fitness centre, a community hall and a library was built on the site of the former Swimarama swimming pool at the junction of Mandeville Road and Eastcote Lane North, and opened in 2010.
*Down Barns Moated Site, a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

The rapid growth of the population in the mid-20th century can be explained by Northolt&#x27;s growth as a dormitory town for nearby Ealing, and the construction in 1935 of the A40 road through the area. Modern family homes were built in the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1950s and 1960s, predominantly local authority rented housing was constructed. 3,423 council houses had been built in Northolt by 1963. Northolt tube station was opened in 1948 to serve the growing population of the area.

==Crime==
Anti-social behaviour has recently been the most common reported crime, followed by violent and sexual offences. Crime levels notably increased, by up to 50% between 2013 and 2014. A knifeman took relatives hostage at a flat in 1985. Jimmy Canning, IRA member, lived undercover in Northolt from 1991 to 1993; he had wooed local Audrey Lamb and moved into her house at 15 Islip Gardens, using it as a weapons and bomb storage depot. He and Lamb were arrested in 1992 following police surveillance.

==Pony racing==

Northolt was famous for the pony racing which took place in Northolt Park. A racecourse was constructed by Sir William Bass and Viscount Lascelles, and opened in 1929 by the Earl of Harewood and his wife the Princess Royal.

During the Second World War, the land was taken over and used as an army depot and prisoner of war camp. Despite numerous attempts to revive pony racing after the war the land was given over to housing construction. The Racecourse Estate was constructed between 1951 and 1955 in order to solve a severe housing shortage within the borough. The gates of the original racecourse remain in Petts Hill, and a section of the track can be observed as a long, flat stretch of land alongside Mandeville Road.

Northwood was first recorded in 1435 as &quot;Northwode&quot;, formed from the Old English &#x27;north&#x27; and &#x27;wode&#x27;, meaning &#x27;the northern wood&#x27;, in relation to Ruislip.

===Early developments===
In the Domesday Book of 1086, the Northwood-embracing parish of Ruislip had immense woodland, sufficient to support one parish with 1,500 pigs per year, and a park for wild beasts (parcus ferarum).

The hamlet of Northwood grew up along the north side of the Rickmansworth-Pinner road which passes across the north-east of the parish. Apart from this road and internal networks in areas of scattered settlement to the east and west, Ruislip had only three ancient roads of any importance of which Ducks Hill Road was the only one in the Northwood hamlet. This followed the course of the modern road from its junction with the Rickmansworth road in the northwest corner of the parish. It then ran south through Ruislip village as Bury Street and continued through the open fields as Down Barns Road (now West End Road) to West End in Northolt.

Northwood had a manorial grange in 1248, which may have occupied the site of the later Northwood Grange. The monks of the Bec Abbey who lived at Manor Farm in Ruislip in the 11th century owned this grange. A few cottages at Northwood are mentioned in the 1565 national survey. Two hundred years later the shape of the hamlet, composed of a few farms and dwellings scattered along the Rickmansworth road, had altered little except for the addition of Holy Trinity church. Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury had of Ruislip cleared of forest.

Northwood, however, elevated and separated from the rest of the parish by a belt of woodland, took until the 19th century to form a village — in the manor of St. Catherine&#x27;s were inclosed under the Ruislip Inclosure Act 1769 (9 Geo. 3. c. &quot;67&quot; ) privatizing land which lay west of Ducks Hill Road, including West Wood (now &quot;Mad Bess Wood&quot;) which was common ground. A further of Ruislip parish were inclosed by the Ruislip Inclosure Act 1804 (44 Geo. 3. c. &quot;45&quot; ). The character of the area in providing for Northwood and Northwood Hills to have the majority of open spaces as opposed to housing land was begun by transfers of open space land to the public as early as 1899. The open nature of the district attracted three hospitals to move or establish in this part of the parish: Mount Vernon Hospital, St. Vincent&#x27;s Orthopaedic Hospital and Northwood, Pinner and District Hospital.

=== Urban development ===

A land survey of Northwood conducted in 1565 by King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, the new lords of the manor of Ruislip, recorded ten houses and several farms.

By 1881, the population of Northwood had reached 257, with 62 houses recorded from 41 people in 1841. David Carnegie owned the large Eastbury Park Estate in the north of the area in 1881. In 1887, the Metropolitan Railway was extended from Harrow-on-the-Hill to Rickmansworth and Carnegie sold his land to Frank Carew for development for £59,422. Northwood station opened in August that year. Carew stipulated the prices for the new housing he had built, with the cottages along the west side of the High Street priced at £120. He had hoped these would be owned by the staff of the larger houses. The High Street itself had been a track leading on from Rickmansworth Road to Gate Hill Farm. The first shops opened in 1895 on the east side of the road, and included a hairdresser, butchers and a fishmongers. Carew sold the majority of the estate to George Wieland in 1892.

By 1902, the population had reached 2,500 in 500 houses and running 36 shops. In 1904, the Emmanuel Church opened in Northwood Hills, designed by Sir Frank Elgood, a local architect. It had been built in 1895, originally to serve as a school. Elgood later served as chairman of the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council.
Northwood and Pinner Cottage Hospital was built in 1926 as a memorial to the First World War, using donations from the Ruislip Cottagers&#x27; Allotments Charity.

Northwood is home to Northwood Headquarters, in the grounds of Eastbury Park, the estate purchased by David Carnegie in 1857. The Royal Air Force took over the site in 1939 for the use of RAF Coastal Command which made use of Eastbury house and also created a network of underground bunkers and operations blocks, at which time the house was used as the leading Officers&#x27; Mess, though was subsequently damaged by fire. The RAF vacated the site in 1969, and it is now the location of the British Armed Forces Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) for planning and controlling overseas military operations, together with the NATO Maritime Command.

A new community centre on the town&#x27;s high street, replacing an older building, was officially opened by the local MP Nick Hurd in September 2012. The new building was named the Kate Fassnidge Community Centre after the Uxbridge landowner who donated some of her land to the borough, and replaced a derelict dining club that had originally been a Ritz cinema.

== 1948 Air Disaster ==
On 4 July 1948 a Scandinavian Airlines Douglas DC-6 on a flight from Amsterdam to RAF Northolt collided with an RAF Avro York coming from Malta over Northwood. Both aircraft crashed, killing all 39 people on both aircraft.

== Geography ==
Northwood post town extends into two neighbourhoods in Hertfordshire named Eastbury and Moor Park. A triangular area of Northwood including the old High Street, Chester Road and Hallowell Road is a place of Local Architectural Special Interest, a restriction to protect the ornate Victorian houses made of high quality brickwork. Dotted across the area are 22 listed buildings (for their architecture).

Elevations range between 177 feet (54m) to 374 feet (114m) AOD, with many ridges and folds in the land creating an undulating terrain.

===Northwood Hills===

Northwood Hills includes Haste Hill and is separated by green buffers on almost all sides, though touches Eastcote Village to the south and had a population of 11,441 in 2008 according to the Office for National Statistics.

The land on which Northwood Hills, Haste Hill Golf Club and most of Northwood now stand was once the Great Common Wood. This covered in the 16th century, which residents would use for grazing their livestock and collecting firewood. Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury achieved inclosure from Parliament and sold of the wood in 1608 for £4000. The remaining woodland became Copse Wood, part of the Ruislip Woods, a national nature reserve.
Northwood Hills has intermixed in its area the only social housing estates beyond one street of the area; much of its private housing stock was built during the 1930s by the Belton Estates company led by Harry Peachey while Harry Neal was responsible for building the shopping parade in Joel Street. Its name was chosen in a competition by a woman from North Harrow as the land was split between Northwood, North Harrow and Ruislip parishes. The first houses were built in Potter Street.
The Namaste Lounge Restaurant (formerly known as Northwood Hills public house and the Northwood Hills Hotel before that) opposite the tube station is accredited as where Sir Elton John first performed professionally. A picture of the pub appears on one of his album covers.

Each May one of the largest Scout Jumble sales in the country is held by 1st Northwood on the land next to their headquarters, the Hogs Back.

Northwood secondary school and Sixth Form is located in Potter Street (the former name of the school). The Olympic boxer Audley Harrison and &quot;Big Brother&quot; contestant Nikki Grahame are alumni of the school.

<doc id="94200" wikidata="Q215354" url="?curid=94200" title="Notting Hill">
<text>Notting Hill is a district of West London, England, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Notting Hill is known for being a and multicultural neighbourhood, hosting the annual Notting Hill Carnival and the Portobello Road Market. From around 1870, Notting Hill had an association with artists.

For much of the 20th century, the large houses were subdivided into multi-occupancy rentals. Continental Europeans, Caribbeans (African Caribbeans, Indian Caribbeans, and White Caribbeans), Africans, Indians, Arabs, Asians, Jewish, Central Americans, South Americans, Pacific Islanders, Irish, Northern Irish, Scottish, Welsh, and other immigrants were drawn to the area in the 1950s and 1960s, partly because of the cheap rents, but were exploited by slum landlords like Peter Rachman and also became the target of white Teddy Boys in the 1958 Notting Hill race riots.

By the early 21st century, after decades of gentrification, Notting Hill had gained a reputation as an affluent and fashionable area, known for attractive terraces of large Victorian townhouses and high-end shopping and restaurants (particularly around Westbourne Grove and Clarendon Cross). A &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; article in 2004 used the phrase &quot;the Notting Hill set&quot; to refer to a group of emerging Conservative politicians, such as David Cameron and George Osborne, who would become respectively Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer and were once based in Notting Hill.

==History==
Notting Hill is in the ceremonial county of Greater London although it was formerly a hamlet on rural land until the expansion of urban London during the 19th century. As late as 1870, even after the hamlet had become a London suburb, Notting Hill was still popularly referred to as being in Middlesex rather than in London.

===Origin of the name===
The origin of the name &quot;Notting Hill&quot; is uncertain though an early version appears in the Patent Rolls of 1356 as Knottynghull, while an 1878 text, Old and New London, reports that the name derives from a manor in Kensington called &quot;Knotting-Bernes&quot;, &quot;Knutting-Barnes&quot;, or &quot;Nutting-barns&quot;, and goes on to quote from a court record during Henry VIII&#x27;s reign that &quot;the manor called Notingbarons, alias Kensington, in the parish of Paddington, was held of the Abbot of Westminster.&quot; For years, it was thought to be a link with Canute, but it is now thought likely that the &quot;Nott&quot; section of the name is derived from the Saxon personal name Cnotta, with the &quot;ing&quot; part generally accepted as coming from the Saxon for a group or settlement of people.

===Potteries and Piggeries===
The area in the west around Pottery Lane was used in the early 19th century for making bricks and tiles out of the heavy clay dug in the area. The clay was shaped and fired in a series of brick and tile kilns. The only remaining 19th-century tile kiln in London is on Walmer Road. In the same area, pig farmers moved in after being forced out of the Marble Arch area. Avondale Park was created in 1892 out of a former area of pig slurry called &quot;the Ocean&quot;. This was part of a general clean-up of the area which had become known as the Potteries and Piggeries.

===19th-century development===

The area remained rural until London&#x27;s westward expansion reached Bayswater in the early 19th century. The Ladbroke family was Notting Hill&#x27;s main landowner, and from the 1820s James Weller Ladbroke began to develop the Ladbroke Estate. Working with the architect and surveyor Thomas Allason, Ladbroke began to lay out streets and houses, with a view to turning the area into a fashionable suburb of the capital (although the development did not get seriously under way until the 1840s). Many of these streets bear the Ladbroke name, including Ladbroke Grove, the area&#x27;s main north–south axis, and Ladbroke Square, London&#x27;s largest private garden square.

The original idea was to call the district Kensington Park, and other roads (notably Kensington Park Road and Kensington Park Gardens) are reminders of this. The local telephone prefix 7727 (originally 727) is based on the old telephone exchange name of PARk.

Ladbroke left the actual business of developing his land to the firm of City solicitors, Smith, Bayley (known as Bayley and Janson after 1836), who worked with Allason to develop the property. In 1823 Allason completed a plan for the layout of the main portion of the estate. This marks the genesis of his most enduring idea – the creation of large private communal gardens, originally known as &quot;pleasure grounds&quot;, or &quot;paddocks&quot;, enclosed by terraces and/or crescents of houses.

Instead of houses being set around a garden square, separated from it by a road, Allason&#x27;s houses would have direct access to a secluded communal garden in the rear, to which people on the street did not have access and generally could not see. To this day these communal garden squares continue to provide the area with much of its attraction for the wealthiest householders.
In 1837 the Hippodrome racecourse was laid out. The racecourse ran around the hill, and bystanders were expected to watch from the summit of the hill. However, the venture was not a success, in part due to a public right of way which traversed the course, and in part due to the heavy clay of the neighbourhood which caused it to become waterlogged. The Hippodrome closed in 1841, after which development resumed and houses were built on the site. The crescent-shaped roads that circumvent the hill, such as Blenheim Crescent, Elgin Crescent, Stanley Crescent, Cornwall Crescent and Landsdowne Crescent, were built over the circular racecourse tracks. At the summit of hill stands the elegant St John&#x27;s church, built in 1845 in the early English style, and which formed the centrepiece of the Ladbroke Estate development.

The Notting Hill houses were large, but they did not immediately succeed in enticing the very richest Londoners, who tended to live closer to the centre of London in Mayfair or Belgravia. The houses appealed to the upper middle class, who could live there in Belgravia style at lower prices. In the opening chapter of John Galsworthy&#x27;s &quot;Forsyte Saga&quot; novels, he housed the Nicholas Forsytes &quot;in Ladbroke Grove, a spacious abode and a great bargain&quot;. In 1862 Thomas Hardy left Dorchester for London to work with architect Arthur Blomfield; during this period he lived in Westbourne Park Villas. He immersed himself in the city&#x27;s literary and cultural life, studying art, visiting the National Gallery, attending the theatre and writing prose and poetry. His first published story, &quot;How I Built Myself a House&quot;, appeared in &quot;Chamber&#x27;s Journal&quot; in 1865. Here he wrote his first―but never published―novel, &quot;The Poor Man and the Lady&quot;, in 1867, and the poem &quot;A Young Man&#x27;s Exhortation&quot;, from which Graham Greene took an epigraph for his own novel &quot;The Comedians&quot;. Arthur Machen (1863–1947), the author of many supernatural and fantastic fictions, lived at 23 Clarendon Road, Notting Hill Gate, in the 1880s; he writes of his life here in his memoirs &quot;Far Off Things&quot; (1922) and &quot;Things Near and Far&quot; (1923). His mystical work &quot;The Hill of Dreams&quot; (1907, though written ten years earlier) has scenes set in Notting Hill; it is here that the protagonist Lucian Taylor encounters the beautiful bronze-haired prostitute who will later connive at his death.

===Early to mid-20th century===

The reputation of the district altered over the course of the 20th century. As middle-class households ceased to employ servants, the large Notting Hill houses lost their market and were increasingly split into multiple occupation. During the Blitz a number of buildings were damaged or destroyed by the Luftwaffe, including All Saints&#x27; Church, which was hit in 1940 and again in 1944. In the postwar period the name Notting Hill evoked a down-at-heel area of cheap lodgings, epitomised by the racketeering landlord Peter Rachman and the murders committed by John Christie in 10 Rillington Place, since demolished. The area to the north east, Golborne, was particularly known for being, in the words of Charles Booth, &quot;one of the worst areas in London&quot;. Southam Street in Kensal Green had 2,400 people living in 140 nine-roomed houses in 1923, and the slum children from this street were documented in the 1950s photographs of Roger Mayne.

In late August and early September 1958, the Notting Hill race riots occurred. The series of disturbances are thought to have started on 30 August when a gang of white youths attacked a Swedish woman, Majbritt Morrison, who was married to a West Indian man (Raymond Morrison), following a previous incident in Latimer Road tube station. Later that night a mob of 300 to 400 white people, including many &quot;Teddy Boys&quot;, were seen on Bramley Road attacking the houses of West Indian residents. The disturbances, racially-motivated rioting and attacks continued every night until they petered out by 5 September.

The dire housing conditions in Notting Hill led Bruce Kenrick to found the Notting Hill Housing Trust in 1963, helping to drive through new housing legislation in the 1960s and found the national housing organisation Shelter in 1966. Nos 1–9 Colville Gardens, now known as Pinehurst Court, had become so run down by 1969 that its owner, Robert Gubay of Cledro Developments, described conditions in the buildings as &quot;truly terrible&quot;.

The slums were cleared during redevelopment in the 1960s and 1970s when the Westway Flyover and Trellick Tower were built. It is now home to a vibrant community, mainly Mediterranean Spanish and Moroccan, together with Portuguese.

===Late 20th-century gentrification===
By the 1980s, single-occupation houses began to return to favour with families who could afford to occupy them, and because of the open spaces and stylish architecture Notting Hill is today one of London&#x27;s most desirable areas. Several parts of Notting Hill are characterised by handsome stucco-fronted pillar-porched houses, often with private gardens, notably around Pembridge Place and Dawson Place and streets radiating from the southern part of Ladbroke Grove, many of which lead onto substantial communal gardens. There are grand terraces, such as Kensington Park Gardens, and large villas as in Pembridge Square and around Holland Park. There is also new construction of modern houses tucked away on backland sites.

Since at least 2000, independent shops in Portobello such as Culture Shack have lost out to multinational standardised chains such as Starbucks. In 2009, Lipka&#x27;s Arcade, a large indoor antiques market, was replaced by the high-street chain AllSaints. Reflecting the increasing demise of one of the most culturally vibrant parts of central London, the 2011 Census showed that in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea, in which Notting Hill is situated, the number of Black or Black British and White Irish residents, two of the traditionally largest ethnic minority groups in Notting Hill, declined by 46 and 28 percent respectively in ten years.

The district adjoins two large public parks, Holland Park and Kensington Gardens, with Hyde Park within to the east. The gentrification has encompassed some streets that were among the 1980s&#x27; most decrepit, including the now expensive retail sections of Westbourne Grove and Ledbury Road, as well as Portobello Road&#x27;s emergence as a top London tourist attraction and Chamberlayne Road as a local shopping street with its boutique independent shops. Notting Hill has a high concentration of restaurants, including the two Michelin-rated The Ledbury and Core by Clare Smyth.

==Geography==

The hill from which Notting Hill takes its name is still clearly visible, with its summit in the middle of Ladbroke Grove, at the junction with Kensington Park Gardens.

Notting Hill has no official boundaries, so definitions of which areas fall under Notting Hill vary. The postcode &quot;W11&quot;, centred on the former site of the Post Office in Westbourne Grove, near the junction with Denbigh Road, is the one most closely associated with Notting Hill. It covers the central part of Notting Hill, and is situated between the A402 (Holland Park Avenue) to the south and the Westway to the north. Notting Hill is made up of four sub areas plus Notting Hill itself. In the north west is Kensal Green…North Kensington in the south west while to the north east is Kensal Town and South east of the area is Westbourne Park and Notting Hill. These areas are separated by the by westway(north-south axis) and Ladbroke Grove which runs through the area north-south.
The local historian Florence Gladstone, in her much reprinted work &quot;Notting Hill in Bygone Days&quot; defines Notting Hill as the whole of that part of Kensington which is north of the road known as Notting Hill Gate.

North Kensington is considered the major neighbourhood of Notting Hill, but Kensal Green, Latimer Road and Westbourne Park are also part of Notting Hill; though estate agents differentiate North Kensington and Notting Hill as distinct areas with Westbourne considered part of Notting Hill and Kensal considered part of North Kensington. Locally the areas of Portobello, North Kensington, Kensal are referred to as Ladbroke Grove, the main thoroughfare and tube station at the heart of Notting Hill. That part of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea roughly encompassed by the electoral wards of Saint Charles, Golborne, Notting Barns, Colville, Norland, and Pembridge, which is bounded on the north by Harrow Road and on the south by Notting Hill Gate and Holland Park Avenue, includes all areas known as Notting Hill, including Notting Barns, the centre of the Notting Hill race riot. David Cameron, former leader of the Conservative Party, is known as part of the &quot;Notting Hill Set&quot;, though he states he lives in North Kensington.

There are five tube stations in the area: Ladbroke Grove, Westbourne Park, Latimer Road, Notting Hill Gate and Kensal Green. Notting Hill is part of the parliamentary constituency of Kensington, represented by Conservative Felicity Buchan since the 2019 general election.

==Areas of Notting Hill==
===Ladbroke Grove===

Ladbroke Grove is a road running down the west side of Notting Hill, stretching up to Kensal Green, straddling the W10 and W11 postal districts, and also the name of the immediate area surrounding the road. Ladbroke Grove tube station is on the road where it is crossed by the Westway.

===Notting Hill Gate===

A turnpike gate was constructed at the foot of the hill on the main road from London to Uxbridge, now Oxford Street, Bayswater Road and Holland Park Avenue along this part of its route. The point at which the turnpike gate stood was known as Notting Hill Gate. The gate was there to stop people passing along the road without paying. The proceeds were applied towards the maintenance of this important road. The gate was removed in the 19th century and the high road was widened and straightened in the 1960s, involving the demolition of many buildings, the linking of two separate tube stations and the construction of two tower blocks.

===Portobello Road===
Portobello Road runs almost the entire length of Notting Hill from north to south. It runs parallel to Ladbroke Grove. It contains Portobello Road Market, one of London&#x27;s best known markets, containing an antique section and second-hand, fruit and veg and clothing stalls. The road was originally a lane leading to Portobello Farm in the north of Notting Hill.

===Westbourne Grove===

Westbourne Grove is a retail road running across Notting Hill from Kensington Park Road in the west to Queensway in the east, crossing over Portobello Road. It was noted as &quot;fashionable&quot; and &quot;up-and-coming&quot; from the 1990s since then it has attracted many designer label outlets as well as independent and chain retailers.

The Notting Hill Carnival passes along the central part of Westbourne Grove.

===Westbourne Green===
Westbourne Green is the area in between Westbourne Park Station and Royal Oak Station and is made up of mainly residential roads with Westbourne Park Road running through the entire area to the east of Notting Hill. The Westbourne Green section of Notting Hill comes under Westminster City Council.

The Notting Hill Carnival also passes through Westbourne Green up Chepstow Road and turns right onto Westbourne Grove.

===Kensal Green===

Kensal Green is in the north of Notting Hill. It is the area north of the respective iron bridges on Ladbroke Grove and Golborne Road. Parts of this area fall under the London Borough of Brent. It has been earmarked for regeneration around the proposed crossrail station next to Sainsbury&#x27;s.

The area is served by Kensal Green station (Underground and Overground)

===North Kensington===
North Kensington is the key neighbourhood of Notting Hill. It is where most of the violence of the race riots occurred, where the Notting Hill Carnival started and where most of the scenes in the film, Notting Hill were shot.

The area&#x27;s main transport hub, Ladbroke Grove tube station, was called Notting Hill from its opening in 1864 until 1919. The name was changed then to avoid confusion with the new Notting Hill Gate station. Ladbroke Grove is the area&#x27;s main thoroughfare.

Estate agents now call the super-rich area to the south Notting Hill when referring to Notting Hill Gate and Holland Park.

North Kensington was once well known for its slum housing. However, North Kensington retains high levels of poverty and unemployment and a high-proportion of social housing for rent. In this area, Grenfell Tower is also found, which burnt down in 2017.

Waves of immigration to the area have occurred for at least a century, including, but certainly not limited to, people of Irish, Jewish, Caribbean, Spanish, and Moroccan extraction. This constant renewal of the population makes the area one of the most cosmopolitan in the world.

==Carnival==
Notting Hill Carnival is an annual Caribbean carnival event in August, over two days (Sunday and the following bank holiday). It has continuously taken place since 1965. It is led by members of the Caribbean population, many of whom have lived in the area since the 1950s. The carnival has attracted up to 1.5million people in the past, putting it among the largest street festivals in Europe.

It attracted press attention in 1976 for clashes with the police, which occurred in 1976 at the conclusion of the Notting Hill Carnival after police arrested a pickpocket and a group of black youths came to his defence. The disturbance escalated and more than 100 police officers were injured. Two notable participants in this riot were Joe Strummer and Paul Simonon, who later formed the seminal London punk band The Clash. Their song &quot;White Riot&quot; was inspired by their participation in this event. Further incidents continued for a few years, but receded for several decades, until 2008 when approximately 500 youths clashed with police on the Monday.

As the event grew, concerns about the size of the event prompted Ken Livingstone to set up a Carnival Review Group to look into &quot;formulating guidelines to safeguard the future of the Carnival&quot;. An interim report by the review resulted in a change to the route in 2002. When the full report was published in 2004, it was recommended that Hyde Park be used as a &quot;savannah&quot;; though this move has attracted some concern that the Hyde Park event may overshadow the original street carnival.

In 2003 Carnival was run by a limited company, the Notting Hill Carnival Trust Ltd. A report by the London Development Agency on the 2002 Carnival estimated that the event contributes around £93million to the London and UK economy.

==Cultural references==
Notting Hill provides the setting for novels by G. K. Chesterton (&quot;The Napoleon of Notting Hill&quot;), Colin MacInnes (&quot;Absolute Beginners&quot;), Michael Moorcock (the Jerry Cornelius quartet), R. C. Sherriff (&quot;The Hopkins Manuscript&quot;), and Alan Hollinghurst (&quot;The Line of Beauty&quot;). Dan Waddel&#x27;s &quot;The Blood Detective&quot; is a murder novel set in the past and present - featuring Notting Dale. The area&#x27;s newer, wealthy residents are satirised in Rachel Johnson&#x27;s novel &quot;Notting Hell&quot; (2006) set in grand houses surrounding a fictional communal garden. Sam Selvon&#x27;s 1956 novel &quot;The Lonely Londoners&quot; set in Notting Hill portrays the lives of Caribbean immigrants making their way in post-World War II London.

The area is also the setting of the films: &quot;The Knack …and How to Get It&quot; (1965), &quot;Performance&quot; (1970) featuring Mick Jagger, &quot;Lava&quot; (2001), and &quot;Paddington&quot; (2014). Notting Hill serves as the locale for the 1999 romantic comedy &quot;Notting Hill&quot;, starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant.

A film set in the same streets but showing a different story of the area is &quot;Pressure&quot; (1976), by Horace Ové, examining the experience of those of Caribbean descent in 1970s Notting Hill including police brutality and discrimination.

The Notting Hillbillies were a country rock project formed by Dire Straits frontman Mark Knopfler in 1986. They released a single album, &quot;Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time&quot;, in 1990.

Notting Hill is often referred to as &#x27;the most Instagrammable district in London&#x27; due to the abundance of photogenic restaurants and pastel-coloured houses.

==Transport==
Along with the majority of west and northwest London, Notting Hill is heavily served by the London Underground. Five lines serve the area, two deep level tubes, the Central and Bakerloo lines, with three sub-surface lines, the Hammersmith &amp; City, Circle and District lines. Firstly, the Central line crosses the area on an east–west axis, with stations at Notting Hill Gate, which also provides an interchange with the Circle (main section) and District lines (Edgware road branch), and Holland Park to the west. The northern half of Notting Hill, comprising various sub districts such as Kensal Green, Ladbroke Grove and North Kensington is served by the western branch of the Circle line, as it shares tracks with the Hammersmith &amp; City line west of Paddington. These lines run through Notting Hill predominantly on a viaduct, calling at Westbourne Park, Ladbroke Grove and Latimer Road respectively, before reaching Shepherds Bush to the west. The Bakerloo line skirts the North East corner running from Warwick Avenue station to Paddington.

===Crossrail Station===
At a site just to the east of the Old Oak Common site, Kensington &amp; Chelsea Council has been pushing for a station at Kensal Green off Ladbroke Grove and Canal Way, as a turn-back facility will have to be built in the area anyway. Siting it at Kensal Green, rather than next to Paddington itself, would provide a new station to regenerate the area. Among the general public there is a huge amount of support for the project and the then-Mayor Boris Johnson stated that a station would be added if it did not increase Crossrail&#x27;s overall cost; in response, Kensington &amp; Chelsea Council agreed to underwrite the projected £33million cost of a Crossrail station, which was received very well by the residents of the Borough. In 2011, Transport for London conducted a feasibility study on the station with the project backed by National Grid, retailers Sainsbury&#x27;s and Cath Kidston Limited, and Jenny Jones (Green Party member of the London Assembly).

<doc id="94204" wikidata="Q310447" url="?curid=94204" title="Ville Ritola">
<text>Vilho &quot;Ville&quot; Eino Ritola (18 January 1896 – 24 April 1982) was a Finnish long-distance runner. Known as one of the &quot;Flying Finns&quot;, he won five Olympic gold medals and three Olympic silver medals in the 1920s. He holds the record of winning most athletics medals at a single Games – four golds and two silvers in Paris 1924 – and ranks second in terms of most athletics gold medals at a single Games.

== Childhood and emigration to the United States ==
Ritola&#x27;s parents, Johannes Ritola (1851–1944) and Serafia Gevär (1863–1919), were farmers in western Finland near Seinäjoki. He was born in Peräseinäjoki, Finland. He was the 14th child in his family and had altogether 19 siblings, five of whom died in infancy. Six of the children were from his father&#x27;s first marriage, 14 from the second, including Ville.

In 1913 he followed seven of his siblings and emigrated to the United States to work as a carpenter. There he started training in 1919 when he was already 23 years old. Later he referred many times to this late start of his sports career, and how it put him at a disadvantage compared to his rivals, especially the more famous of the Flying Finns, Paavo Nurmi, who started systematic training in his teens. In 1919 he joined the Finnish-American Athletic Club and trained together with Hannes Kolehmainen, who had moved to the United States after the 1912 Summer Olympics. In spring 1919 he took part in his first competition, a New York street race, and finished 33rd among 700 competitors. It was only after this that he started to train systematically.

Kolehmainen tried to convince the young Ritola to join the Finnish 1920 Summer Olympics team, but Ritola stated that he was not ready yet. He had also just married Selma née Aaltonen. In 1921 he started to compete systematically, and in 1922 he won his first AAU Championship gold medals. The same year he came second in the Boston Marathon.

== Paris Olympics 1924 ==

In 1923, American Finns started collecting funds to pay for Ville Ritola&#x27;s trip to Finland, where in May 1924 he took part in the Finnish Olympic qualification competitions. In the 10,000 m qualifying race Ritola won with a world record time of 30.35.4. This was Ritola&#x27;s first official world record.

At the 1924 Paris Olympics, he won four gold and two silver medals. He had a start on eight consecutive days to achieve this, all long-distance.

In his first race, the 10,000 m, in the absence of Nurmi, he won by half a lap and obliterated his own fresh world record by more than 12 seconds. Finnish officials had selected Ritola for the race as Nurmi was already running in five other distance events. Three days later, Ritola won the 3000 m steeplechase by 75 metres. The next day he finished second in the 5000 m, 0.2 seconds behind Nurmi. Ritola later earned another silver medal behind Nurmi in the individual cross-country race and gained a gold medal as a member of the Finnish cross-country team. Finally, Ritola joined Nurmi to win the 3000 m team race.

Ritola&#x27;s 1924 triumph in Paris is historical. His six medals from Paris is still the biggest number of medals won by an athlete in one Olympic games event. His four gold medals put him in second place after Paavo Nurmi in the number of gold medals won by an athlete in one Olympic Games event.

== Back to the United States ==

After the Olympics, Ritola had to return to the US to find employment, while his pregnant wife remained in Finland. His daughter Anja was born in November 1924. Selma joined her husband in the US with the baby in March 1925.

In winter 1924–1925, Ritola competed in the United States and Canada and beat world record times in the 3000 m (8 min 26.8 sec), 3000 m steeplechase (9 min 18.6 sec), 5000 m (14 min 23.2 sec), 2 miles, 2 mile steeplechase, 3 miles and 5 miles. These were not official world records as they were run indoors.

== Amsterdam Olympics 1928 ==

In 1928, Ritola was 32 years old and had worked in construction for more than a decade. He had not trained systematically even though he still had won four gold medals in the AAU Championships 1927.

In the 1928 Summer Olympics, Ritola&#x27;s main competitor was again Paavo Nurmi. This time each got one win. The first race was 10,000m. Ritola took the lead at 1,500m, and only four competitors followed. At 3,000m, Ray (US) dropped from the leading group and before 4,000m, Beavers (UK). As Wide (Sweden) dropped at 6,500m, only Nurmi followed Ritola. At 100m before the finish Nurmi sprinted and won by 0.6 seconds. Wide was third, losing by a 45.2s margin.

Ritola&#x27;s last Olympic appearance was in the 5,000 m at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Both Ritola and Nurmi had hurt themselves in the steeplechase qualification competitions. Nurmi had a sore hip and Ritola a sore ankle. However, Ritola again took the lead at 2,500m. At 600m before the finish, only Ritola and Nurmi were left in the leading group. This time, Ritola pulled away from Nurmi in the final curve and won by 12 metres – 3 seconds. Wide nearly caught Nurmi, and Nurmi only held on to silver by a 0.2s margin. This victory brought Ritola&#x27;s career total to five Olympic gold medals and three silver medals.

Ritola never competed in the Finnish championships, but won a handful of medals in the AAU Championships in the United States. He was the AAU champion at in 1927, at road race in 1922, 1923 and from 1925 to 1927, at steeplechase in 1923, 1926 and 1927 and at cross country in 1922, 1923 and from 1925 to 1927.

== After sports career ==
Ritola retired from athletics soon after the 1928 Olympic Games. He took part in only a few US competitions after 1928. He returned to American construction sites and worked in physically demanding jobs until 1959. He took US citizenship in 1937. His daughter, Anja Impola, married and lived in the US until her death in 2013. Ritola&#x27;s wife Selma died in 1965 and he remarried, to Liisa Lauren, in 1967. Ritola moved back to Helsinki, Finland with his wife in 1971 and died in Helsinki aged 86.

== Honours ==

<text>Orpington is a town in Greater London, England, within the London Borough of Bromley. It is 13.4 miles (21.6 km) south east of Charing Cross.

On the south-eastern edge of the Greater London Built-up Area, it is south of St Mary Cray, southwest of Swanley, west of Ramsden, north of Goddington and Green Street Green, and east of Crofton and Broom Hill. Orpington is covered by the Kent BR postcode area.

It is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London.

==History==

Stone Age tools have been found in several areas of Orpington, including Goddington Park, Priory Gardens, the Ramsden estate, and Poverest. Early Bronze Age pottery fragments have been found in the Park Avenue area. During the building of Ramsden Boys School in 1956, the remains of an Iron Age farmstead were excavated. The area was occupied in Roman times, as shown by Crofton Roman Villa and the Roman bath-house at Fordcroft. During the Anglo-Saxon period, Fordcroft Anglo-Saxon cemetery was used in the area.

The first record of the name Orpington occurs in 1038, when King Cnut&#x27;s treasurer Eadsy gave land at &quot;Orpedingetune&quot; to the Monastery of Christ Church at Canterbury. The name means &#x27;Orped&#x27;s farmstead&#x27;, Orped being an Anglo-Saxon first-name. The Church of All Saints was also built in the Anglo-Saxon period. On 22 July 1573, Queen Elizabeth I was entertained at Bark Hart (Orpington Priory) .

Historically, the major local commercial centre was nearby St Mary Cray rather than Orpington. St Mary Cray had a regular market, and industry (paper mills and bell foundry). In contrast, Orpington was a small country village surrounded by soft fruit farms, hop fields and orchards. These crops attracted Romani people, working as itinerant pickers, to annual camps in local meadows and worked-out chalk pits. Although this work has largely ended, the Borough still provides a permanent site for travellers at Star Lane, and historic gatherings are commemorated in local street names, such as Romany Rise. In 1967, Eric Lubbock, then Liberal MP for Orpington, promoted a Private Member&#x27;s Bill to provide permanent Romani sites; this resulted in the Caravan Sites Act 1968 that placed an obligation upon local authorities to provide sites for locally residing travellers. In 1971, an international meeting of Romany people was held at Orpington; this Orpington Congress marked the founding of the International Romani Union, a group seeking political representation for Romanis throughout Europe.

Orpington railway station opened in 1868 to the southwest of the town centre, prompting housing development in the Crofton and Broom Hill areas, with the Derry Downs areas to the east also developed at about the same time. The station was expanded in 1904, prompting a wave of house building that peaked in the 1920-30s, transforming the area into a suburb of London. The Walnuts Shopping Centre was built in the early 1970s.

==Government==

Orpington has been part of the London Borough of Bromley since 1 April 1965. Prior to this Orpington&#x27;s local government was the Orpington Urban District within the county of Kent. Orpington forms part of the Orpington (UK Parliament constituency) and the current MP is Gareth Bacon, who has held the seat since 2019 for the Conservative Party. Orpington constituency, which covers a large swathe of southern Bromley borough, is regarded as a Conservative safe seat, with the party winning the seat in every general election held since 1970. Gareth Bacon is also the London Assembly member for the Bexley and Bromley constituency in which Orpington is located.

Orpington is a town located in Greater London, specifically within the London Borough of Bromley. It has farms, roads, and homes divided by the border with Kent. This characteristic means that some areas of Orpington fall within the administrative boundaries of Bromley, while others extend into Kent.

===By-election of 1962===
After the Conservative member for the Orpington constituency, Donald Sumner, had resigned to become a county court judge, a by-election was held on 15 March 1962. Orpington was considered a safe Conservative seat, but Eric Lubbock, the Liberal candidate, won with a 22% swing away from the Conservatives. The result caused a sensation and was headline news across the nation.
It is from this win that the revival of the Liberal Party is usually dated.

==Demographics==
Data from the 2011 census reported that the population of Orpington was 15,311 with 52% being female and 48% male. The average age is 42, slightly above the national average age of 40. 86% of Orpington&#x27;s population was born in England, with the second highest group being those born in Scotland at 1.1%. 95.1% of Orpington&#x27;s population speak English, with &#x27;Others&#x27; at 0.4%. Christianity is the most prominent religion in Orpington, with 63.1% of the population identifying as Christian; &#x27;no religion&#x27; was second with 24.4% and Islam third at 2.1%. 45 people identify as Jewish and five as Buddhist. 51.1% of the local population is married, 23.8% are single, 8.2% cohabit with a partner of the opposite sex and 0.5% cohabit with a partner of the same sex. The leading occupation is &#x27;professionals&#x27; who make up 19.2% of the population followed by administrative and secretarial at 16.2%.

==Retail and commerce==

The High Street and adjacent Walnuts Shopping Centre contain a variety of high-street shops, pubs and restaurants. A large Tesco supermarket opened in 2009 on the site of a former multi-storey car park. There is also a general market three days a week in front of Orpington College. In 2017 a restricted parking zone was introduced on Orpington High Street, which enabled the council to wipe away road markings indicating parking restrictions. By combining the lack of markings with CCTV monitoring, the council has been able to reduce the amount of street clutter and improve the quality of the High Street environment.

Much of the town&#x27;s retailers reside at the Nugent Shopping Park. This retail park is located to the north of the high street, in the St Mary Cray area. The vicinity of the park also hosts several &#x27;big box&#x27; retail outlets. Following the relocation of Marks &amp; Spencer from their town-centre store to the Nugent Shopping Park, their previous site was taken over by Sainsbury&#x27;s, who moved from their site nearby in the Walnuts.

==Sport and leisure==
The Walnuts Leisure Centre, just east of the High Street, has a six-lane, 33.3-metre indoor swimming pool, squash courts and a gym with sauna and steam room, as well as a sports hall used for activities such as badminton, basketball, trampolining and fitness classes. The sports hall is also used for Women&#x27;s Artistic Gymnastics, and the leisure centre has been the main training venue for Orpington Gymnastic Club since the opening of the centre.

There are also other leisure centres such as one situated at Harris Academy Orpington, which has a floodlit, synthetic pitch for hockey and football, three outdoor tennis courts, two netball courts, four outdoor cricket nets and a sports hall with gymnasium/fitness suite and dance studio. Another is Banaatyne Health Club, a members-only health club on Sandy Lane which was previously LA Fitness but changed causing controversy in late 2015. Other exercise facilities include bodybuilding gym Ripped Muscle And Fitness located on Orpington high street, previously Keddles Gym (now based in Dartford), and Anytime fitness which can be found on Orpington high street.

There are rugby, football, tennis and cricket pitches in Goddington Park which are used by Westcombe Park RFC, Orpington Cricket Club and Orpington Football Club. Westcombe Park RFC competes in National League 3 London &amp; SE (four leagues below premiership rugby). &#x27;Combe&#x27; moved from the Blackheath area to Orpington in 1936. Cray Wanderers F.C., established in 1860 no longer plays in Orpington, but now shares a ground with Bromley F.C. On 3 October 2014 Cray Wanderers signed a conditional contract to purchase Flamingo Park Sports Centre on the A20 Sidcup bypass. The club subsequently obtained planning permission from Bromley Council for a new sporting community hub, featuring a new multi-sport stadium with a spectator capacity of 2,200. However, in July 2016 new London Mayor Sadiq Kahn vetoed the plan as part of his pledge to protect green belt land.

Orpington Boxing Club has produced numerous amateur champions. It moved to Westerham in 1986. The club closed in 2013 due to lack of funding, but reopened in Pettswood in 2024 with a 15 year lease.

Since 1985, members of Orpington Road Runners have met every Tuesday near The Buff Pub and on Sundays at High Elms Country Park. For over 10 years, the club has organised a 10k race and series of 2k fun runs during the summer in conjunction with Darrick Wood School. Bromley Indoor Bowls Club is situated off Gillmans Road. Lawn bowls is played at the Excelsior Club in Poverest Recreation Ground. Knoll Lawn Tennis Club has (despite its name) five tarmac courts tucked away among the houses of Mayfield Avenue and Lynwood Grove. Bromley Tennis Centre (six indoor courts and four floodlit outdoor courts) is in the grounds of Newstead Wood School.

Construction work on a new cinema complex at The Walnuts Centre commenced in 2014; the seven screen Odeon Cinema opened on 26 February 2016. Orpington was without a cinema since 1982, when the old Commodore cinema closed.

==Education==
Education in Orpington is managed by the London Borough of Bromley which is the local education authority. The town contains a range of primary and secondary schools. The state secondary schools include St. Olave&#x27;s Grammar School and Newstead Wood School, which both select students on the basis of their performance in a highly competitive entrance examination.

The Orpington campus of Bromley College, Bromley is a further education college, affiliated with the University of Greenwich and Canterbury Christ Church University. It was originally built as Orpington College in 1972, and remains the tallest building in the area, being refurbished in 2008 and then merging with Bromley College in 2011.

==Transport==

Orpington railway station is a transport hub served by Southeastern with trains to the Central London stations of Charing Cross and Cannon Street via Grove Park, as well as Victoria via Bromley South and Herne Hill. In the other direction services call at Sevenoaks, Tunbridge Wells and Hastings.

Orpington is served by London Buses routes 51, 61, 208, 353, 358, B14, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, school routes 654, 684, night route N199, Go-Coach route 3 and Arriva Kent Thameside route 477.

The M25 motorway around London passes Orpington to the south of the town and three A roads, the A208, A224 and A232, pass through the area. Additionally, the A21 passes along the town&#x27;s southern border.

==Landmarks==
===The Parish Church===

The Parish Church is All Saints Church, which stands upon pre-Norman foundations. Mentioned in the Domesday Book, it is Early English in style, but some Saxon work is still visible. It was endowed by the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1173. The tower and steeple were damaged by a storm in 1771. The rebuilt steeple was struck by lightning in 1809, and it was not replaced. The church was greatly enlarged in 1957. The present Vicar is the Reverend George Rogers.

===The Priory===

The Priory is a medieval hall house. In 1032, Eadsy, chaplain to King Cnut, gave his estate at Orpedingetune to Christ Church Priory, Canterbury. The first Rector of Orpington, Hugh de Mortimer, held court here in 1270. The house was rebuilt in 1290, this time in stone, and extended in 1393 and 1471. In the 17th century the house ceased to be a rectory and passed into private ownership; a timber-framed extension was added, which no longer exists. The house was acquired by Orpington Urban District Council in 1947, and used to house a museum which closed in September 2015 for cost reasons.

=== Priory Gardens ===
The Grade II listed Priory Gardens designed by the last private owners of The Priory, Cecil and Lilian Hughes, consists of Italianate and Arts &amp; Crafts style formal gardens reflecting the Hughes respective interests, a landscaped park with children&#x27;s play area, and a trio of natural ponds where the River Cray rises. Each year the Orpington May Queen is crowned in the gardens.

===Orpington Hospital ===
During the First World War a large military hospital, the &quot;16th Canadian General&quot;, was built south-east of the station, funded by the government of Ontario, Canada. It originally accommodated 1,050 patients; an extra wing was added in 1917. By January 1919 more than 25,000 wounded soldiers had been treated here. Most of the original pre-fabricated buildings remained in use for more than 80 years before a major renovation around the turn of the century. Today Orpington Hospital provides rehabilitation and therapy services, outpatient and diagnostic services (including dermatology and diabetes), but it no longer has an Accident and Emergency Unit. The nearest A&amp;E is Princess Royal University Hospital in Farnborough.

===Orpington War Memorial===

Orpington War Memorial standing at the southern end of the High Street is a focal point for Remembrance Sunday. It was designed by local architect Charles Heaton Comyn and unveiled on Sunday 28 August 1921. It originally contained the names of 111 local men who died in the Great War, however further names were added later, bringing the total for the Great War up to 117.

A campaign in 1997–98 for the remembrance of 432 armed forces personnel who fell in the Second World War resulted in the unveiling of eight more plaques on Sunday 2 August 1999. Another new plaque has been added detailing the eight local men who have died on active duty since 1945.

===Canadian Corner===

In the corner of All Saints&#x27; Church sits Canadian Corner. This is a First World War memorial that marks where 182 soldiers who died being treated at Orpington Hospital are buried. The name derives from the fact 88 of those buried are Canadians. Canadian Corner is unique in that its design resembles that of First World War Cemeteries found in France &amp; Belgium, with the text on the memorial suggesting that the Memorial Cross was the first outside of the Western Front, as the English public were interested in how the war cemeteries looked. The Memorial Cross in Canadian Corner was unveiled in 1921 in the presence of the High Commissioner for Canada. The automatic plunger used to release the Union flag which hid the Cross was the same used by George V during the unveiling of The Cenotaph a year earlier. The Memorial Cross in Canadian Corner was the first Canadian Memorial unveiled in the UK.

==Popular culture==
===Orpington chicken and duck===

Orpington is known for the &quot;Buff&quot;, &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;Speckled&quot; chickens bred locally by William Cook in the 1890s. One could see the Buff Orpington at Tripes Farm, Chelsfield Lane until the late 1990s when the chicken coop was removed from the farm. Buff Orpington Ducks were also developed by Cook. The town still has a pub called The Buff, originally named in honour of the Buff Orpington.

===Orpington car===
The Orpington Car, designed by Frank Smith and built by Smith &amp; Milroy Ltd at their works in Wellington Road, was shown at the 1920 Motor Show. It was a two-seater convertible, with a dickey seat, and a 10 horsepower (7.5 kW) engine. Although briefly successful, Smith and Milroy could not compete with mass production, and the last car was commonly believed to have been built in 1925. The only known survivor at the time reportedly once appeared in the 1970s television series &quot;Crossroads&quot;, but this has not been substantiated. There are now no known surviving examples.

===Orpington man===
Journalists in the 1960s used &quot;Orpington man&quot; to designate a typical member of the lower middle class, for example as the target audience of an electoral or advertising appeal.

<text>Osterley ( ) is an affluent district of Isleworth in west London, England, from Charing Cross in the London Borough of Hounslow. Most of its land use is mixed agricultural and aesthetic parkland at Osterley House (National Trust), charity-run, much of which is open to paying visitors.

Osterley is on elevated soil, bisected by the A4 (Great West Road), and extends north of the M4 motorway. Syon Lane forms the border to the east, while the border with Heston is to the west. Osterley extends south of the A4, including St Mary&#x27;s Church.
Most of the land of Osterley is the large ancestral private estate of Osterley Park (one of the largest open spaces in west London) and its mansion. These were formerly owned by the Jersey family and were used during World War II as the home for Tom Wintringham&#x27;s Home Guard training school. They are now National Trust property. In the 1930s, when the Great West Road was completed, ribbon development housing appeared, and this gradually expanded to form the comparatively small residential sections within Osterley.

Besides Osterley House and Park, the district is also known for one of the London residences of The Sultan of Brunei (Aviary Farm in Windmill Lane).

==Sport and Leisure==

Osterley has a non-League football club CB Hounslow United F.C. who play at the Osterley Sports Ground.

The training ground of Premier League club Brentford is located at 100 Jersey Road, Osterley.

== Demography and housing ==
In the 2011 census, the Osterley ward was recorded as being 30% White British. Other significant ethnic groups were Other Whites (12.8%) and Indians. The proportion who ethnically identify as BAME (Black, Asian and minority Ethnic) was 54.4% of the population.

51.9% of people living in Osterley were born in the U.K. The other most common countries of birth were India (12.7%), Pakistan (2.8%), Kenya (2.2%), Ireland (1.8%), and North Africa (1.3%).

The largest religious affiliations in Isleworth are Christians (39.2%), Muslims (13.8%), Hindus (13.7%), those with no religion (11.9%), and Sikhs (11.8%).

<text>Paddington is an area in the City of Westminster, in central London, England. A medieval parish then a metropolitan borough of the County of London, it was integrated with Westminster and Greater London in 1965. Paddington station, designed by the engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel opened in 1847. It is also the site of St Mary&#x27;s Hospital and the former Paddington Green Police Station.

Paddington Waterside aims to regenerate former railway and canal land. Districts within Paddington are Maida Vale, Westbourne and Bayswater including Lancaster Gate.

==History==
The earliest extant references to &quot;Padington&quot; (or &quot;Padintun&quot;, as in the &quot;Saxon Chartularies&quot;, 959), historically a part of Middlesex, appear in documentation of purported tenth-century land grants to the monks of Westminster by Edgar the Peaceful as confirmed by Archbishop Dunstan. However, the documents&#x27; provenance is much later and likely to have been forged after the 1066 Norman conquest. There is no mention of the place (or Westbourne or Knightsbridge) in the Domesday Book of 1086.

It has been reasonably speculated that a Saxon settlement led by the followers of &quot;Padda&quot;, an Anglo-Saxon chieftain, was located around the intersection of the northern and western Roman roads, corresponding with the Edgware Road (Watling Street) and the Harrow and Uxbridge Roads. From the tenth century, Paddington was owned by Westminster Abbey which was later confirmed by the Plantagenet kings in a charter from 1222. This charter mentions a chapel and a farm situated in the area. While a 12th-century document cited by the cleric Isaac Maddox (1697–1759) establishes that part of the land was held by brothers &quot;Richard and William de Padinton&quot;. They and their descendants carried out activities in Paddington; these were known by records dating from 1168 to 1485. They were the earliest known tenant farmers of the land.

During King Henry VIII&#x27;s dissolution, the property of Paddington was seized by the crown. However, King Edward VI granted the land to the Bishop of London in 1550. Successive bishops would later lease farmlands to tenants and city merchants. One such, in the 1540s was Thomas North who translated Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; into English in 1579. Shakespeare would later use this work and was said to have performed in taverns along Edgware Road.

In the later Elizabethan and early Stuart era, the rectory, manor and associated estate houses were occupied by the Small (or Smale) family. Nicholas Small was a clothworker who was sufficiently well connected to have Holbein paint a portrait of his wife, Jane Small. Nicholas died in 1565 and his wife married again, to Nicholas Parkinson of Paddington who became master of the Clothworkers&#x27; Company. Jane Small continued to live in Paddington after her second husband&#x27;s death, and her manor house was big enough to have been let to Sir John Popham, the attorney general, in the 1580s. They let the building that became in this time &quot;Blowers Inn&quot;.

=== Early Modern period ===
As the regional population grew in the 17th century, Paddington&#x27;s ancient Hundred of Ossulstone was split into divisions; Holborn Division replaced the hundred for most administrative purposes. A church, the predecessor of St Mary was built in Paddington in 1679.

In 1740, John Frederick leased the estate in Paddington and it is from his granddaughters and their families that many of Paddington&#x27;s street names are derived. The New Road was built in 1756–7 to link the villages of Paddington and Islington. By 1773, a contemporary historian felt and wrote that &quot;London may now be said to include two cities (London and Westminster), one borough (Southwark) and forty six antient [ancient] villages [among which]... Paddington and [adjoining] Marybone (Marylebone).&quot;
During the 18th century, several French Huguenots called Paddington village home. These included jewellers, nobility and skilled craftsmen; and men such as Claudius Amyand (surgeon to King George II). The French nobility built magnificent gardens that lasted up until the 19th century.

Roman roads formed the parish&#x27;s northeastern and southern boundaries from Marble Arch: Watling Street (later Edgware Road) and; (the) Uxbridge road, known by the 1860s in this neighbourhood as Bayswater Road. They were toll roads in much of the 18th century, before and after the dismantling of the permanent Tyburn gallows &quot;tree&quot; at their junction in 1759 a junction now known as Marble Arch. The Tyburn gallows might have been a reason why expansion and urban development (from London) slowed in Paddington; as public execution was taking place there up until 1783.Only in 1801 did major construction to Paddington occur. This happened when the bishops leased land to the Grand Junction Canal, where a direct trade link could now take place between London and the Midlands, bringing more employment to the area. The canal would remain dominant until Regent&#x27;s Canal was built in 1820. Construction and building projects would take place from east to west and south to north throughout the 19th century; increasing its population in a rapid pace, overtaking the village scene of Paddington. This population increase would go from 1,881 to 46,305 between 1801 and 1851 respectively; with 10,000 new inhabitants added every decade thereafter.
Paddington station first opened in 1838, with the first underground line in 1863 (Metropolitan). Paddington was one of the few districts in London that had a migrant majority population by 1881. With a thriving Greek and Jewish community present in the mid-19th century. During the period, several Victorian churches were demolished owing to structural decay. Victorian housing developed into slums, giving the area an unsavoury reputation.

However, in the 1930s massive rebuilding and improvements projects were made. However, even as late as the 1950s Paddington was a byword for overcrowding, poverty and vice. Between the 1960s and 1980s, the area would see vast improvements and redevelopments in city planning.

===Tyburnia===

The southeast section of Tyburnia used to be a shanty-town in the 1790s before the Canal was built and brought much needed employment to its inhabitants. The area was built up during the course of the Napoleonic Wars.

In the 19th century the part of the parish most sandwiched between Edgware Road and Westbourne Terrace, Gloucester Terrace and Craven Hill, bounded to the south by Bayswater Road, was known as Tyburnia. The district formed the centrepiece of an 1824 masterplan by Samuel Pepys Cockerell to redevelop the Tyburn Estate (historic lands of the Bishop of London) into a residential area to rival Belgravia.

The area was laid out in the mid-1800s when grand squares and cream-stuccoed terraces started to fill the acres between Paddington station and Hyde Park; however, the plans were never realised in full. Despite this, Thackeray described the residential district of Tyburnia as &quot;the elegant, the prosperous, the polite Tyburnia, the most respectable district of the habitable globe.&quot;

===Etymology===
Derivation of the name is uncertain. Speculative explanations include &quot;Padre-ing-tun&quot; (explained as &quot;father&#x27;s meadow village&quot;), &quot;Pad-ing-tun&quot; (&quot;pack-horse meadow village&quot;), and &quot;Pæding-tun&quot; (&quot;village of the race of Pæd&quot;) the last being the cited suggestion of the Victorian Anglo-Saxon scholar John Mitchell Kemble.

There is another Paddington in Surrey, recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &quot;Padendene&quot; and later as &quot;Paddingdon&quot;, perhaps to be derived from Old English &quot;dene, denu&quot; &quot;valley&quot;, whereas Paddington in Middlesex is commonly traced back to Old English &quot;tūn&quot; &quot;farm, homestead, town&quot;. Both place names share the same first part, a personal name rendered as &quot;Pad(d)a&quot;, of uncertain origin, giving &quot;Padda&#x27;s valley&quot; for the place in Surrey and &quot;homestead of Padda&#x27;s people&quot; for the place in Middlesex. That both place names would refer to the same individual or ancient family, is pure speculation. A lord named Padda is named in the Domesday Book, associated with Brampton, Suffolk.

===Colloquial expressions===
An 18th-century dictionary gives &quot;Paddington Fair Day. An execution day, Tyburn being in the parish or neighbourhood of Paddington. To dance the Paddington frisk; to be hanged.&quot; Public executions were abolished in England in 1868.

==Geography==
The Paddington district is centred around Paddington railway station. The conventional recognised boundary of the district is much smaller than the longstanding pre-mid-19th century parish. That parish was virtually equal to the borough abolished in 1965. It is divided from a northern offshoot Maida Vale by the Regent&#x27;s Canal; its overlap is the artisan and touristic neighbourhood of Little Venice. In the east of the district around Paddington Green it remains divided from Marylebone by Edgware Road (as commonly heard in spoken form, the Edgware Road). In the south west it is bounded by its south and western offshoot Bayswater. A final offshoot, Westbourne, rises to the north west.

==Governance==
Paddington was part of the Metropolitan Borough of Paddington, the headquarters of which was at Paddington Town Hall, until 1965 when the area became part of the enlarged City of Westminster.

==Landmarks==

===Browning&#x27;s Pool===
A lagoon created in the 1810s at the convergence of the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal, the Regent&#x27;s Canal and the Paddington Basin. It is an important focal point of the Little Venice area. It is reputedly named after Robert Browning, the poet. More recently known as the &quot;Little Venice Lagoon&quot; it contains a small islet known as Browning&#x27;s Island. Although Browning was thought to have coined the name &quot;Little Venice&quot; for this spot there are strong arguments Lord Byron was responsible.

===London Paddington Station===

Paddington station is the iconic landmark associated with the area. In the station are statues of its designer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and the children&#x27;s fiction character Paddington Bear.

===Paddington Basin===

The terminus of the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal was originally known as the Paddington Basin and all the land to the south was developed into housing and commercial property and titled The Grand Junction Estate. The majority of the housing was bounded by Praed Street, Sussex Gardens, Edgware Road and Norfolk Place. Land and buildings not used for the canal undertaking remained after 1929 with the renamed Grand Junction Company, which functioned as a property company. While retaining its own name, it was taken over in 1972 by the Amalgamated Investment and Property Company, which went into liquidation in 1976. Prior to the liquidation the Welbeck Estate Securities Group acquired the entire estate comprising 525 houses 15 shops and the Royal Exchange public House in Sale Place.

The surrounding area is now known as Merchant Square. A former transshipment facility, the surrounds of the canal basin named Merchant Square have been redeveloped to provide of offices, homes, shops and leisure facilities. The redeveloped basin has some innovative features including Heatherwicks Rolling Bridge, the Merchant Square Fan Bridge and the Floating Pocket Park.

===Paddington Central===

Situated to the north of the railway as it enters Paddington station, and to the south of the Westway flyover and with the canal to the east the former railway goods yard has been developed into a modern complex with wellbeing, leisure, retail and leisure facilities. The public area from the canal to Sheldon Square with the amphitheatre hosts leisure facilities and special events.

===Paddington Green===

A green space and conservation area in the east of the Paddington district immediately to the north of the Westway and west of Edgware Road. It includes St Mary on Paddington Green Church. The Paddington Green campus of the City of Westminster College is adjacent to the Green. Paddington Green Police Station is immediately to the north west of the intersection of Westway and Edgware Road.

==Transport==
=== Rail ===
Paddington station is on the London Underground and National Rail networks. It is in London fare zone 1.

==== National Rail ====
Great Western Railway services from Paddington run towards Slough, Maidenhead and Reading, with intercity services continuing towards destinations in South West England and South Wales, including Oxford, Worcester, Bristol, Cardiff, Exeter, Plymouth and Penzance.

The Elizabeth line, operated by Transport for London (TfL), runs a stopping service from Paddington to Reading, either as part of through-running services from the central and eastern parts of the Elizabeth line or starting from Paddington. These trains mostly depart from the deep-level Elizabeth line platforms underneath the western side of the mainline station. These deep-level Elizabeth line tracks emerge above ground adjacent to the mainline tracks just west of Royal Oak tube station and join them at that point, thereafter sharing the relief line tracks with some Great Western Railway stopping services as far as the Elizabeth line terminus at Reading. Elizabeth line services link the Paddington area both to destinations in west London and Berkshire and to the centre and eastern side of London.

Trains to Heathrow Airport also depart from Paddington, operated both by the Elizabeth line (stopping services via Ealing Broadway) and the Heathrow Express (no intermediate stops).

==== London Underground ====
There are two London Underground (tube) stations in the Paddington station complex.

The Bakerloo, Circle and District lines call at the station on Praed Street (which, from the main concourse, is opposite platform 3). This links Paddington directly to destinations across Central and West London, including Baker Street, Earl&#x27;s Court, Oxford Circus, South Kensington, Victoria, Waterloo, Westminster and Wimbledon.

The Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines call at the station near the Paddington Basin (to the north of platform 12). Trains from this station link the area directly to Hammersmith via Shepherd&#x27;s Bush to the west. Eastbound trains pass through Baker Street, King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras, Liverpool Street in the City, Whitechapel and Barking.

Lancaster Gate tube station is also in the area, served by Central line trains.

==== Heritage ====
Paddington station was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The permanent building opened in 1854.

Paddington Bear was also named after the station; in Michael Bond&#x27;s 1958 book &quot;A Bear Called Paddington&quot;, Paddington is found at the station by the Brown family. He is lost, having just arrived in London from &quot;darkest Peru.&quot;

=== Buses ===
London Buses 7, 23, 27, 36, 46, 205 and 332, and night buses N7 and N205 serve Paddington station. Buses 23, 27 and 36 operate 24 hours, daily.

Routes 94 and 148 serve Lancaster Gate station to the south of Paddington. Both routes operate 24 hours, daily, supplemented by route N207 at nights.

=== Road ===
Several key routes pass through or around the Paddington area, including:

* A40 (Westway/Marylebone Flyover) – westbound towards White City, Acton and the M40 motorway (towards Oxford and Birmingham).
* A402 (Bayswater Road) – eastbound towards Marble Arch, Oxford Circus and Holborn (via A40/Oxford Street), and Park Lane. Westbound towards Notting Hill, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Chiswick.
* A404 (Harrow Road) – northeast towards Kensal Green, Wembley and Harrow.
* A4205 (Praed Street/Westbourne Terrace) 
* A4206 (Bishop&#x27;s Bridge Road) – southwest towards Notting Hill.
* A4209 (Sussex Gardens)
* A5 (Edgware Road) – southbound to Marble Arch and Park Lane. Northbound to Kilburn, Hendon, the M1 motorway and Edgware. Forms part of the London Inner Ring Road.
* A501 (Marylebone Flyover/Marylebone Road) – eastbound towards Regent&#x27;s Park, King&#x27;s Cross and the City. Forms part of the London Inner Ring Road.

=== Cycling ===
Cycling infrastructure is provided in Paddington by Transport for London (TfL) and the Canal &amp; River Trust.

Several cycle routes pass through the area, including:

* Cycle Superhighway 3 (CS3) – part of the &quot;East–West Superhighway,&quot; CS3 begins just south of Paddington at Lancaster Gate and carries cyclists southbound through Hyde Park to South Kensington. The route continues eastbound, passing Hyde Park Corner, Embankment, Blackfriars, Tower Hill and Canary Wharf &quot;en route&quot; to Barking in the East End. The route runs predominantly on traffic-free cycle track. The route is also unbroken and signposted.
* Quietway 2 (Q2) – runs on traffic-free paths or residential streets. Westbound, the route runs unbroken and signposted to Bayswater and Ladbroke Grove &quot;en route&quot; to East Acton. Eastbound, the route is incomplete, but will run unbroken to Bloomsbury via Marylebone and Fitzrovia. As the route runs on traffic-free or low-traffic routes, it is indirect.
* Grand Union Canal towpath – a shared-use path running direct to Little Venice, Westbourne Park and Willesden, and eventually Hayes. The route is managed by the Canal &amp; River Trust.
* Regent&#x27;s Canal towpath – runs alongside the Regent&#x27;s Canal on residential streets from Little Venice to Lisson Grove. The route then joins the towpath, heading eastbound which provides Paddington with a direct connection to Regent&#x27;s Park, Camden Town and King&#x27;s Cross. The route is managed by the Canal &amp; River Trust.

Sustrans also propose that National Cycle Route 6 (NCR 6) will begin at Paddington and run northwest along the Grand Union Canal towpath. The route, when complete, will run signposted and unbroken to Keswick, Cumbria. Within the M25, the route will pass through Hayes, Uxbridge and Watford.

Santander Cycles, a London-wide bike sharing system, operates in Paddington, with several docking stations in the area.

=== Canal ===

The Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal runs from Paddington to Hayes, via Westbourne Park and Willesden. Beyond Hayes, onward destinations include Slough, the Colne Valley, and Aylesbury. The Paddington Basin is in the area, as is Little Venice. A towpath runs unbroken from Paddington to Hayes.

The Rolling Bridge at the Paddington Basin was designed by Thomas Heatherwick, who wanted to create a bridge that, instead of breaking apart to let boats through, would &quot;get out of the way&quot; instead. Heatherwick&#x27;s website cites the &quot;fluid, coiling tails of the animatronic dinosaurs of Jurassic Park&quot; as the initial influence behind the Bridge.

The Regent&#x27;s Canal begins at Little Venice, heading east towards Maida Vale, Regent&#x27;s Park, Camden Town, King&#x27;s Cross, Old Street and Mile End &quot;en route&quot; to Limehouse. A towpath runs along the canal from Paddington to Limehouse, broken only by the Maida Hill and Islington tunnels.

== Development ==

Commercial traffic on the Grand Junction Canal (which became the Grand Union Canal in 1929) dwindled because of railway competition in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, and freight then moved from rail to road after World War II, leading to the abandonment of the goods yards in the early 1980s. The land lay derelict until the Paddington Waterside Partnership was established in 1998 to co-ordinate the regeneration of the area between the Westway, Praed Street and Westbourne Terrace. This includes major developments on the goods yard site (now branded Paddington Central) and around the canal (Paddington Basin). much of these developments have been completed and are in use.

===Renewal proposal, 2018–2023===
PaddingtonNow BID put forward a renewal bid in 2017 covering the period April 2018 to March 2023, which would be supported by a levy on local businesses. Development schemes for St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital and Paddington Square are likely to commence in this period, and the impact of the opening of the Elizabeth line in 2018 would be soon felt.

==Religion==
Paddington has a number of Anglican churches, including St James&#x27;s, St Mary Magdalene, St David&#x27;s Welsh Church and St Peter&#x27;s. In addition, there is a large Muslim population in and around Paddington.

==People from Paddington==

==Notable residents==
Between 1805 and 1817, the great actress Sarah Siddons lived at Desborough House, (which was demolished before 1853 to make way for the Great Western Railway) and was buried at Paddington Green, near the later graves of the eminent painters Benjamin Haydon and William Collins. Her brother Charles Kemble also built a house, Desborough Lodge, in the vicinity—in which she may have lived later. In later years, the actress Yootha Joyce, best known for her part in the classic television comedy George and Mildred, lived at 198 Sussex Gardens.

One of Napoleon&#x27;s nephews, Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte (1813–1891), a notable comparative linguist and dialectologist, who spent most of his adult life in England, had a house in Norfolk Terrace, Westbourne Park.

The eccentric philanthropist Ann Thwaytes lived at 17 Hyde Park Gardens between 1840 and 1866.

The Victorian poet Robert Browning moved from No. 1 Chichester Road to Beauchamp Lodge, 19 Warwick Crescent, in 1862 and lived there until 1887. He is reputed to have named that locality, on the junction of two canals, &quot;Little Venice&quot;. But this has been disputed by Lord Kinross in 1966 and more recently by londoncanals.uk who both assert that Lord Byron humorously coined the name. The name is now applied, more loosely, to a longer reach of the canal system.

St Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Praed Street is the site of several notable medical accomplishments. In 1874, C. R. Alder Wright synthesised heroin (diacetylmorphine). Also there, in 1928, Sir Alexander Fleming first isolated penicillin, earning the award of a Nobel Prize. The hospital has an Alexander Fleming Laboratory Museum where visitors can see Fleming&#x27;s laboratory, restored to its 1928 condition, and explore the story of Fleming and the discovery and development of penicillin through displays and video.

Edward Wilson, physician, naturalist and ornithologist, who died in 1912 on Captain Robert Scott&#x27;s ill-fated British Antarctic expedition, had earlier practised as a doctor in Paddington. The former Senior Street primary school was renamed the &quot;Edward Wilson School&quot; after him in 1951.

British painter Lucian Freud had his studio in Paddington, first at Delamere Terrace from 1943 to 1962, and then at 124 Clarendon Crescent from 1962 to 1977.

==Education==
==In popular culture==

Timothy Forsyte of John Galsworthy&#x27;s &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; and other relatives resided in Bayswater Road.

Paddington Bear, from &quot;deepest, darkest Peru&quot;, emigrated to England via Paddington station.

<text>Palmers Green is a suburban area and electoral ward in north London, England, within the London Borough of Enfield. It is located within the N13 postcode district, around north of Charing Cross. It is home to the largest population of Greek Cypriots outside Cyprus and is often nicknamed &quot;Little Cyprus&quot; or &quot;Palmers Greek&quot;.

== Etymology ==
Recorded as &quot;Palmers grene&quot; 1608, &#x27;village green associated with a family called Palmer&#x27; (mentioned in local records from the 14th century), from the Middle English &quot;grene&quot;.

==History==
Palmers Green was once a tiny hamlet in the parish of Edmonton, situated at the junction of Green Lanes and Fox Lane. Its population was very small, and there were no more than a few isolated houses in the mid-17th century. Local records mention a Palmers Field in 1204 and a Palmers Grove in 1340. Palmers Green is mentioned as a highway in 1324 (in Westminster Abbey Muniments).

By 1801 the area had grown to a village of 54 buildings, including two inns (according to the Middlesex Record Office). In 1871 the railway line from Wood Green to Enfield was opened and a station was built in Aldermans Hill to serve Palmers Green (half a mile away from the nearest houses).

The area remained largely undeveloped for thirty more years, as local landowners refused to sell their large estates for building. In 1902, however, large tracts of land were sold for building and the area began to develop rapidly. The first large-scale developments were on the Old Park estate between Fox Lane and Aldermans Hill, and the Hazelwood Park Estate between Hazelwood Lane and Hedge Lane, within the latter development the building that now serves as Hazelwood Infant School and Hazelwood Junior School was built in Hazelwood Lane in 1908.Notable local buildings include Broomfield House and Truro House. The former Southgate Town Hall has now been converted into flats. The former Pilgrims Rest (reflecting the name Palmers – &quot;medieval pilgrim who carried a palm branch as a token of having visited the Holy Land&quot;) has already been demolished for housing. The Fox public house, which has been in its present guise since 1904, was once the site of the Electric Mouse comedy venue.

The Intimate Theatre was opened in a building that had been built in 1931 as St Monica&#x27;s Church Hall. Among the actors who performed there were Richard Attenborough, Vivien Leigh, Roger Moore and (in a mime production) David Bowie. It is no longer a repertory theatre and the building is no longer used exclusively for theatrical performances, but it is still often referred to as the Intimate Theatre. In 1992 the building housed a Radio Cracker studio.

In 1988 Palmers Green&#x27;s only hospital, Greentrees Hospital, was closed and demolished.

==Palmers Green today==

There is a parade of shops known as Palmers Green Shopping Centre along Green Lanes, with many restaurants, clothing shops, independently owned cafes, beauty salons, and branches of Superdrug, Wetherspoons (The Alfred Herring), Boots and Morrisons.

Broomfield House, in Broomfield Park, remains a burnt-out shell despite numerous redevelopment proposals and an appearance on the BBC Two programme &quot;Restoration&quot;. The Conservatory in the park has recently reopened after a refurbishment.

After more than 20 years of discussion, the North Circular A406 was widened to two lanes each way at Bounds Green, with various junction improvements. Some major congestion still exists on the A406.

Continuous segregated cycle lanes, junction improvements and rearranged on-street parking on and around Green Lanes have been created by Enfield Council following a successful bid for &quot;Mini Holland&quot; funding from Transport for London. The lanes extend as far south as the A406. The aim is to encourage more commuter, school journeys and leisure cycling than was possible under the previous road layout, which combined four lane sections subject to speeding and other dangers to cyclists. Less than one year into their full opening, automated cycle counts at September 2018 already suggest 10-12k trips by bike per month within Palmers Green.

Public access to the New River waterway has been improved with waterside paths and access gates.

==Demography==
According to the 2011 census, 64% of the ward&#x27;s population is white (34% British, 27% other, 3% Irish). 6% was Indian and 5% of &#x27;any other ethnic group&#x27;. The main foreign languages are Turkish, spoken by 795 people, and Greek, spoken by 605.

==In popular culture==
Green Lanes, the high street of Palmers Green, is featured in the &quot;Knight Bus&quot; sequence in the film &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;.

Palmers Green is mentioned in Jona Lewie&#x27;s song &quot;You&#x27;ll Always Find Me in the Kitchen at Parties&quot; (1980). The song&#x27;s lyrics were written by Lewie&#x27;s friend Keef Trouble, a fellow member of Brett Marvin and the Thunderbolts. The reference to Palmers Green was prompted by the fact that Trouble had split up with his girlfriend and was at a party thrown by his friend Charles &quot;Charlie Farley&quot; Hallinan near The Fox, Palmers Green. Jona Lewie slightly amended the words, but still mentioned the &quot;do in Palmers Green&quot;.

==Transport==
A train service runs at Palmers Green railway station, operated by Great Northern, with southbound trains running to Moorgate. Northbound trains run to Hertford North regularly and on to Stevenage once an hour. Some trains also terminate at Gordon Hill. During May 2019, the train service was disrupted due to platform works at Stevenage.

Bus routes 34, 102, 121, 141, 232, 299, 329, W4, W6, W9 and the N29 operate locally.

The North Circular Road and A10 are the main trunk roads. The A111 through Southgate gives access to the M25 motorway at junction 24.

An electric tramway along Green Lanes as far as Winchmore Hill was developed in 1907, helping to further develop the area. The tramway is now long gone.

<text>The AK-74 (Russian: , &quot;Avtomat Kalashnikova obraztsa 1974 goda&quot;, &#x27;Kalashnikov assault rifle model 1974&#x27;) is an assault rifle designed by small arms designer Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1974 as a successor to the AKM. While primarily associated with the Soviet Union, it has been used by many countries since the 1970s. It is chambered for the 5.45×39mm cartridge, which replaced the 7.62×39mm cartridge of Kalashnikov&#x27;s earlier automatic weapons for the Soviet Armed Forces.

The rifle first saw service with Soviet forces in the Soviet–Afghan War from 1979. The head of the Afghan bureau of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the intelligence agency of Pakistan, claimed that the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) paid $5,000 for the first AK-74 captured by the Afghan mujahideen during the war.

, most countries of the former Soviet Union use the rifle. Licensed copies were produced in Bulgaria (AK-74, AKS-74 and AKS-74U), and in the former East Germany (MPi-AK-74N, MPi-AKS-74N, MPi-AKS-74NK).

==Design details==
The AK-74 was designed by А. D. Kryakushin&#x27;s group under the design supervision of Mikhail Kalashnikov. It is an adaptation of the 7.62×39mm AKM assault rifle and features several important design improvements. These improvements were primarily the result of converting the rifle to the intermediate-calibre high velocity 5.45×39mm cartridge. In fact, some early models are reported to have been converted AKMs, re-barreled to 5.45×39mm. Compared with the preceding AKM, the AK-74 has better effective firing range, accuracy (a main development goal), and reliability. About 50% of the parts in the AK-74 and AKM are the same (including pins, springs and screws).

===Operating mechanism===
The rifle&#x27;s operation during firing and reloading is identical to that of the AKM. After ignition of the cartridge primer and propellant, rapidly expanding propellant gases are diverted into the gas cylinder above the barrel through a vent near the muzzle. The build-up of gases inside the gas cylinder drives the long-stroke piston and bolt carrier rearward and a cam guide machined into the underside of the bolt carrier along with an ejector spur on the bolt carrier rail guide, rotates the bolt approximately 35° and unlocks it from the barrel extension via a camming pin on the bolt. The moving assembly has about of free travel which creates a delay between the initial recoil impulse of the piston and the bolt unlocking sequence, allowing gas pressures to drop to a safe level before the seal between the chamber and the bolt is broken. Like previous Kalashnikov-pattern rifles, the AK-74 does not have a gas valve; excess gases are ventilated through a series of radial ports in the gas cylinder. Since the Kalashnikov operating system offers no primary extraction upon bolt rotation, the 5.45×39mm AK-74 bolt has a larger extractor claw than the 7.62×39mm AKM for increased extraction reliability. Other minor modifications were made to the bolt and carrier assembly.

===Barrel===
The rifle received a new barrel with a chrome-lined bore and 4 right-hand grooves at a 200 mm (1:7.87 in) or 37 calibers rifling twist rate. The front sight base and gas block were redesigned. The gas block contains a gas channel that is installed at a 90° angle in relation to the bore axis to reduce bullet shear at the port hole. A pair of support brackets are cast into the gas block assembly and are used to attach a BG-15c or GP-25 underslung 40 mm grenade launcher. Like the AK-47 and AKM, the muzzle is threaded for the installation of various muzzle devices such as the standard muzzle brake or a blank-firing adaptor, while a spring-loaded detent pin held in the front sight post prevents them from unscrewing while firing. However the muzzle threads have been relocated to the front sight base for both easier and more economic replacement in case of thread damage. The distinctive standard-issue muzzle brake features a large expansion chamber, two symmetrical vertical cuts at the forward end of the brake and three non symmetrical positioned vent holes to counteract muzzle rise and climb as well as lateral shift to the right much like the AKM&#x27;s offset muzzle brake. A flat plate near the end of the brake produces a forward thrust when emerging exhaust gases strike its surface, greatly reducing recoil. The muzzle brake prevents backblast from reaching the firer, although it is reported to be harsh on bystanders as the muzzle gases are dispersed to the sides. The standard-issue AK-74 muzzle brake has been subtly revised several times since the 1970s.

===Sights===
====Iron sights====
The AK-74 uses an adjustable notched rear tangent iron sight calibrated in increments from . The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation in the field. Horizontal adjustment requires a special drift tool and is done by the armoury before issue or if the need arises by an armourer after issue. The sight line elements are approximately over the bore axis. The &quot;point-blank range&quot; battle zero setting &quot;П&quot; standing for &quot;постоянная&quot; (constant/consistent/permanent) the 5.45×39mm AK-74 rear tangent sight element corresponds to a zero, compared with the zero for 7.62×39mm AKs. For the AK-74 combined with the 7N6 or 7N10 service cartridges the 400 m battle zero setting point-blank range limits the apparent &quot;bullet rise&quot; within approximately under the line of sight. At the corresponding maximum point-blank range the bullet will have dropped to approximately relative to the line of sight. Soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing the sights on the center of mass (the belt buckle, according to Russian and former Soviet doctrine) of the enemy target. Any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant, as a well-aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier.

====Optical sights====

While most Russian and CIS armed forces use the AK-74 in its basic configuration with iron sights, many magnified and non-magnified optical sights are available for designated marksmen and other special purpose troops in their respective militaries.

For the 5.45×39mm AK-74, the East German Zeiss ZFK 4×25, USP-1 (1P29), Belorussian BelOMO PO 3.5×21P, PO 4×24P and the 1P78 Kashtan dedicated side rail mounted optical sights were developed. These optical sights are primarily designed for rapid target acquisition and first round hits out to 400 m, but by various means these optical sights also offer bullet drop compensation (BDC) (sometimes referred to as ballistic elevation) for aiming at more distant targets. The BDC feature compensates for the effect of gravity on the bullet at given distances (referred to as &quot;bullet drop&quot;) in flat fire scenarios. The feature must be tuned for the particular ballistic trajectory of a particular combination of gun and cartridge at a predefined muzzle velocity and air density. Since the usage of standardized ammunition is an important prerequisite to match the BDC feature to the external ballistic behaviour of the employed projectiles, these military optical sights are intended to assist with field shooting at varying medium to longer ranges rather than precise long range shots.

The standard Russian side rail mounted optical sight was the 4×26 1P29 Universal sight for small arms. It was copied from and hence similar to the British SUIT (Sight Unit Infantry, Trilux). When mounted the 1P29 sight is positioned centered above the receiver at a height that allows the use of the iron sights. It weighs 0.8 kg, offers 4× magnification with a field of view of 8° and 35 mm eye relief. The 1P29 is issued with a canvas pouch, a lens cleaning cloth, combination tool, two rubber eyecups, two eyecup clamps and three different bullet drop compensation (BDC) cams for the AK-74/AN-94, RPK-74 and PK machine gun. The 1P29 is intended for quickly engaging point and area targets at various ranges and is zeroed for both windage and elevation at . On the right side of the field of view a stadiametric rangefinder is incorporated that can be used to determine the distance from a tall object from . The reticle is an inverted aiming post in the top half of the field of view and is tritium-illuminated for low-light condition aiming.

The current Russian standard side rail mounted optical sight for the AK-74M is the 2.8×17 1P78 Kashtan, an aiming optic similar to the American ACOG. When mounted the 1P78 sight is positioned centered above the receiver. It weighs 0.5 kg, offers 2.8× magnification with a field of view of 13° and 32 mm eye relief. The 1P78 comes in several versions for the AK-74 (1P78-1), RPK-74 (1P78-2), AKM (1P78) and RPK (1P78-3). The 1P78 is intended for quickly engaging point and area targets at various ranges and is zeroed for both windage and elevation at . A stadiametric rangefinder is incorporated that can be used to determine the distance for a soldier sized target from . The reticle consist of a main 400 m &quot;chevron&quot; (^), a holdover dot and smaller additional holdover chevrons for and and is tritium-illuminated for low-light condition aiming.

===New features===
The AK-74 was equipped with a new buttstock, handguard (which retained the AKM-type finger swells) and gas cylinder. The stock has a shoulder pad different from that on the AKM, which is rubber and serrated for improved seating against the shooter. In addition, there are lightening cuts on each side of the buttstock. The buttstock, lower handguard and upper heatguard were first manufactured from laminated wood, this later changed to a synthetic fiberglass-reinforced polyamide 6 colored with &quot;kaprozol brown 4K&quot; disperse dye, the color of which is usually referred to as &quot;Russian Plum&quot;. The introduction of the new material was slow and impeded by very stringent hardness requirements of the military which no Western polymer furniture was able to satisfy as of 1980.

The AK-74 gas tube has a spring washer attached to its rear end designed to retain the gas tube more securely. The lower handguard is fitted with a leaf spring that reduces play in the rifle&#x27;s lateral axis by keeping the wood tensioned between the receiver and the handguard retainer. The receiver remains nearly identical to that of the AKM; it is a U-shaped thick sheet steel pressing supported extensively by pins and rivets. The internal guide rails on which the bolt carrier travels are stamped and spot welded to the inside of the receiver housing. Minor changes were made to the front barrel and rear stock trunnions as well as the magazine well. All external metal surfaces are coated with a glossy black enamel paint.

===Accessories===
Accessories supplied with the military version of the rifle include a 6H4 or 6H5 type bayonet, a quick-loading device, three spare magazines, four 15-round stripper clips, maintenance kit, cleaning rod and sling. The bayonet is installed by slipping the muzzle ring around the flash hider and latching the handle down on the bayonet lug under the front sight base. The 6H5 AK-74 bayonet introduced in 1983 represents a further refinement of the 6H4 AKM bayonet. It introduced a radical blade cross-section, that has a flat milled on one side near the edge and a corresponding flat milled on the opposite side near the false edge. The blade has a new spear point and an improved one-piece molded plastic grip making it a more effective fighting knife. It also has saw-teeth on the false edge and the usual hole for use as a wire-cutter.

===5.45×39mm cartridge===

Relatively small sized, light weight, high velocity military service cartridges like the 5.45×39mm allow a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight compared with their larger and heavier predecessor cartridges, have favourable maximum point-blank range or &quot;battle zero&quot; characteristics and produce relatively low bolt thrust and free recoil impulse, favouring light weight arms design and automatic fire accuracy. Tests measured the free recoil energy delivered by the 5.45×39mm AK-74 rifle at , compared with delivered by the 7.62×39mm in the AKM.

Early 5.45×39mm ballistics tests demonstrated a pronounced tumbling effect with high speed cameras. Some Western authorities believed this bullet was designed to tumble in flesh to increase wounding potential. At the time, it was believed that yawing and cavitation of projectiles were primarily responsible for tissue damage. Martin Fackler conducted a study with an AK-74 assault rifle using live pigs and ballistic gelatin; &quot;The result of our preset test indicate that the AK-74 bullet acts in the manner expected of a full-metal-cased military ammunition – it does not deform or fragment when striking soft tissues&quot;. Most organs and tissue were too flexible to be severely damaged by the temporary cavity effect caused by yaw and cavitation of a projectile. With the 5.45 mm bullet, tumbling produced a temporary cavity twice, at depths of and . This is similar to (but more rapid than) modern 7.62×39mm ammunition and to (non-fragmenting) 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition.

===Magazines===
The original steel-reinforced 30-round AK-74 detachable box magazine was similar to that of the AKM, except for minor dimensional changes required by the 5.45×39mm cartridge.
These magazines discolour over time from yellowish to rust-coloured shades, and are often mistakenly identified as being made of Bakelite (a phenolic resin), but were actually fabricated from two-parts of AG-4S molding compound (a glass-reinforced phenol-formaldehyde binder impregnated composite), assembled using an epoxy resin adhesive. Noted for their durability, these magazines did however compromise the rifle&#x27;s camouflage and lacked the small horizontal reinforcing ribs running down both sides of the magazine body near the front that were added on all later AK-74 magazine generations. A second generation steel-reinforced dark-brown (color shades vary from maroon to plum to near black) 30-round magazine was introduced in the early 1980s, fabricated from ABS plastic. The third generation steel-reinforced 30-round AK-74 magazine is similar to the second generation, but is darker colored and has a matte nonreflective surface finish. With the introduction of the AK-74M the fourth generation of steel-reinforced matte true black nonreflective surface finished 30-round AK-74 magazines was introduced. All AK-74 magazines have a raised horizontal rib on each side of the rear lug to prevent their use in a 7.62×39mm AK. The magazines can be quickly recharged from stripper clips. The empty weight of a 30-round AK-74 box magazine is . The 45-round plastic box magazine of the RPK-74 light machine gun is also interchangeable with that of the AK-74. The empty weight of a 45-round RPK-74 box magazine is . Further 60-round and later 50-round quad-stack 5.45×39mm casket magazines were developed.

The transition to mainly plastic magazines and the relatively small sized, light weight, high velocity 5.45×39mm cartridge yielded a significant weight reduction and allows a soldier to carry considerably more rounds for the same weight compared with the previous Soviet AK-47 and AKM and later 7.62×39mm chambered AK platform assault rifles.

==Variants==
The AK-74 series is also available in several &quot;night-fighting&quot; configurations, equipped with a side dovetail rail for mounting optical sights. These variants, the AK-74N, AKS-74N and AKS-74UN can be used in conjunction with NSPU and NSPU-3 (1PN51) night sights, as well as optical sights such as the USP-1 (1P29). The variants designated AK-74N2 and AKS-74N2 can use the multi-model night vision sight NSPUM (1PN58).

===AKS-74===

The AKS-74 (&quot;S&quot;—Russian: ; &quot;Skladnoy&quot;, or &quot;foldable&quot;), is a variant of the AK-74 equipped with a side-folding metal shoulder stock, designed primarily for use with air assault infantry and developed alongside the basic AK-74. Unlike the AKMS&#x27;s somewhat fragile underfolding stock (modeled after the MP 40 submachine gun stock), the AKS-74 stock is fabricated from stamped sheet metal struts, machine pressed into a &quot;U&quot; shape and assembled by punch fit and welding.

The stock has a triangular shape; it lacks the folding shoulder pad found on the AKMS stock and is folded to the left side of the receiver. The hinged stock is securely locked in its extended position by a spring-loaded button catch located at the rear of the receiver. When folded, the stock is held closed by a spring-loaded capture hook situated on the left side at the front of the receiver housing. A rear-mounted sling swivel is also provided on the right side at the beginning of the stock frame. It retains the pistol grip reinforcement plate the AKMS used, though due to the less complex rear trunnion, only has one riveting hole in place of the three on the AKMS.

===AK-74M===
In 1991, the Izhmash factory in the city of Izhevsk began full-scale production of a modernised variant of the AK-74—the AK-74M (&quot;М&quot;—) assault rifle that offers more versatility compared with its predecessor. Apart from several minor improvements, such as a lightened bolt and carrier assembly to reduce the impulse of the gas piston and bolt carrier during firing, the rifle features a new glass-filled polyamide stock that retains the shape of the original AK-74 fixed laminated wood stock, but side-folds to the left like the skeletonised AKS-74 buttstock. As a result, pistol grip reinforcement plates that were once exclusively used on the folding stock variants are standard on all AK-74Ms. Additionally the AK-74M features an improved muzzle device with extended collar and threads to reduce play and a machine cut beneath to allow easier cleaning rod removal, a reinforced smooth dust cover and a redesigned guide rod return spring retainer that allows firing the GP-25, GP-30 and GP-34 underslung grenade launchers without having to use the previously necessary additional receiver cover fastener. To reduce production costs, barrel hardware, such as the front sight base and gas block, are dimple pressed on to the barrel instead of pinned on (commercial semi-auto variants are still pinned on to maintain user serviceability).

Other economic changes include omission of lightening cuts on the front sight block and gas piston as well as a stamped gas tube release lever, replacing the milled one. The bullet guide and bolt guide were also separated, with the bolt guide becoming a simple bump held in place on the left side of the receiver with an additional rivet (often called a &quot;bump rivet&quot; because of this) making it easier to replace in case of wear. Each AK-74M is fitted with a side-rail bracket for mounting optics that is a simplified version of the 74N mount with less machining cuts. The AK-74M would have been adopted by the Soviet Union as the standard service rifle, and has been accepted as the new service rifle of the Russian Federation.

====AK-74M UUK (Universal Upgrade Kit)====
An AK-74M universal upgrade kit consisting of a new safety, dust cover and furniture featuring improved ergonomics and rails to attach accessories like aiming optics, optoelectronic sights, laser sights, weapon lights and vertical fore grips and a new muzzle device had its official debut on 9 May 2015 in Moscow as part of the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade.
The Kalashnikov Concern has further developed three sets of additional equipment for the modernization of 5.45×39mm and 7.62×39mm chambered AK-pattern assault rifles for normal military units, reconnaissance units, and special forces units.

In 2015, the Kalashnikov Concern announced a contract with the Russian Ministry of Defence to deliver upgrade kits for their AK-74M assault rifles.

===AKS-74U===
In 1973, a design competition (codenamed &quot;Modern&quot;—Модерн) was started for the adoption of a fully automatic carbine.

Soviet planners drew from the unsolicited design AO-46 built in 1969 by Peter Andreevich Tkachev, which weighed only 1.9 kg. The TTT specifications required a weight no greater than , a length of / with the stock unfolded/folded, and an effective firing range of . The competition was joined by designs of Mikhail Kalashnikov (PP1), Igor Stechkin (TKB-0116), S. G. Simonov (AG-043), A. S. Konstantinov (AEK-958), and Yevgeny Dragunov (who called his model &quot;MA&quot;). Kalashnikov also presented an additional design (A1-75) which differed from PP1 by having a modified muzzle for flash and noise suppression.

In 1977, the GRAU decided to adopt Kalashnikov&#x27;s model, which was largely a shortened AKS-74, because its performance was no worse than the competition, and promised significant production cost savings by utilizing existing equipment for the AK-74 line. A final round of large scale testing with Kalashnikov&#x27;s model was performed by airborne divisions in the Transcaucasian Military District in March 1977. The AKS-74U (&quot;U&quot;—Russian: ; &quot;Ukorochenniy&quot;, or &quot;shortened&quot;) was officially adopted in 1979, and given the official, but seldom used GRAU designation 6P26. Production stopped in 1993.

The AKS-74U bridges the tactical deployment gap between a submachine gun and an assault rifle. It was intended for use mainly with special forces, airborne infantry, rear-echelon support units, helicopter and armored vehicle crews. It has been augmented and replaced by various submachine guns, and the less compact AK-105 carbine in Russian military service. It is commonly used by law enforcement; for example, each urban police foot patrol is issued at least one.

The AKS-74U&#x27;s compact dimensions were achieved by using a short barrel (this forced designers to simultaneously reduce the gas piston operating rod to an appropriate length). Due to the shortening of the operating mechanism, the cyclic rate rose slightly to around 700 rounds per minute. In order to effectively stabilize projectiles, the barrel&#x27;s twist rate was increased from 200 mm (1:7.87 in) or 37 calibers rifling twist rate to 160 mm (1:6.3 in) or 29.6 calibers rifling twist rate to adapt the AKS-74U for muzzle velocities of and higher. A new gas block was installed at the muzzle end of the barrel with a muzzle booster, which features an internal expansion chamber inside the cylindrical section of the booster while the conical end acts as a nozzle to increase net pressure inside the gas chamber by supplying an increased amount of propellant gases from the barrel. The chrome-lined muzzle booster also burns any remaining propellant, which would normally reduce muzzle blast. However, due to the extremely short barrel and conical end of the booster, the muzzle blast is nevertheless extremely large and visible. The muzzle device locks into the gas block with a spring-loaded detent pin and features two parallel notches cut into the edge of the flash hider cone, used for unscrewing it using the cleaning rod. Unlike most Kalashnikov variants there is no provision to store the cleaning rod under the barrel. The front sight was integrated into the gas block/forward sling loop.

The sight height above the bore axis is also approximately higher than the AK-74, due to the combined front sight/gas block, rear sight configuration. The AKS-74U has a different rear sight composed of a U-shaped flip sight on the top cover instead of the standard sliding notch tangent rear sight. This rear sight has two settings: &quot;&quot;П&quot; standing for &quot;постоянная&quot; (constant) corresponding to a &quot;point-blank range&quot; battle zero setting and &quot;4-5&quot; (used for firing at distances between ). The rear sight is housed in a semi-shrouded protective enclosure that is riveted to the receiver&#x27;s spring-loaded top cover. This top cover hinges from a barrel trunnion (hinging where the rear sight on a normal AK74 is located), pivoting forward when opened, which also works to unlock the gas tube cover. Both the gas tube and handguard are also of a new type and are wider and shorter than the analogous parts in the AKS-74.

For the AKS-74s combined with the 7N6 or 7N10 service cartridges the 350 m battle zero setting limits the apparent &quot;bullet rise&quot; within approximately relative to the line of sight. Soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing the sights on the center of mass (the belt buckle) of the enemy target. Any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant, as a well-aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier.

The AKS-74U is significantly more maneuverable in tight quarters than the AKS-74; however, the significant decline in muzzle velocity to resulted in a reduction in effective range to (the effective hitting distance for a &quot;running&quot;-type silhouette target was reduced from to ). The AKS-74U cannot mount a bayonet or standard under-barrel grenade launcher. However, a suppressed 30 mm BS-1 grenade launcher was developed specifically for that platform that fires a high-explosive dual purpose (HEDP) grenade. The grenades for the BS-1 are launched by special blank cartridges that are inserted into the grenade launcher via a detachable magazine. The majority of AKS-74U carbines were manufactured at the Tula Arms Factory rather than Izhmash. There were some accessories produced for the AKS-74U including a plastic thigh holster and (shorter than standard) 20-round AK-74 type magazines. The rifle utilizes a proprietary 25 mm wide sling that differs from the standard 35 mm AK sling also in construction. The AKS-74U also exists in a version featuring modernized synthetic furniture made from a black, glass-filled polyamide. The AKS-74U was also used as the basis for several other unique weapons, including the bullpup OTs-14 Groza specialist carbine which is now in limited service in the Russian military, and the Gepard series of multi-caliber submachine guns (none of which evolved past prototype stage).

In the United States, the AKS-74U is sometimes called a &quot;Krinkov&quot;. The origin of this term is uncertain. A hypothesis was circulating that the name came from the Mujahideen who supposedly had captured a high-ranking Soviet officer armed with an AKS-74U, and that they had named it after him. However, investigation by Patrick Sweeney could not confirm this hypothesis, for no Soviet officer with a resembling name was captured in Afghanistan. US journalist C. J. Chivers reported that the gun was nicknamed &quot;the Osama&quot; in jihadist circles, after Osama bin Laden was photographed next to an AKS-74U. Research by The Firearm Blog published in 2016 suggests that the name &quot;Krinkov&quot; is a Pashtun invention that came to the United States with accounts of the Mujahideen.

The AKS-74U is approximately lighter than the NATO equivalent XM177, and shorter with the stock folded.

==== AKS-74UB ====
The AKS-74UB (&quot;B&quot;—Russian: ; &quot;Besshumniy&quot; or &quot;silent&quot;) is a sound-suppressed variant of the AKS-74U adapted for use with the PBS-4 suppressor (used in combination with subsonic 5.45×39mm Russian ammunition).

==Post AK-74M developments and successors==
===AK-100 series===
The modernised variant of the AK-74 — the AK-74M — was used as the technical basis for the new Russian AK-100 family of Kalashnikov firearms:


These original AK-100 series firearms were introduced in 1994 and are categorized by all having black polymer handguards, folding polymer stocks, and use of AK-74M internal systems. Parts are highly interchangeable. The AK-101, AK-102, AK-103 and AK-104 are destined primarily for export, while the AK-105 was developed for replacing the shorter barreled AKS-74U. The AK-105 is used by the Russian Army and Ministry of Internal Affairs.

Additionally, the 5.45×39mm AK-107, 5.56×45mm NATO AK-108 and 7.62×39mm AK-109 assault rifles were developed. These have a technically differing balanced recoil system to reduce felt recoil and muzzle rise. This balanced recoil system designed by Yuriy K. Alexandrov for Kalashnikov-pattern rifles is a significant change to the Kalashnikov operating system of the 1940s. The operating system of these new rifles was derived from the AL-7 experimental rifle of the early 1970s. Since their development, these rifles met little commercial success.

==== AK-200 series ====
The AK-100M/AK-200 rifle family was initially conceived around 2009 as an improved variant of the basic AK-100 series. Most improvements centered on ergonomic improvements and mounting systems for accessories. The development of the AK-200 family was stopped around 2011, but resumed around 2016. In 2017, Kalashnikov unveiled the modernised versions of the AK-100 family of rifles. The AK-200 series are based on the AK-100 series and the AK-12. They can be chambered in 5.45×39mm, 5.56×45mm NATO and 7.62×39mm, and use a barrel and gas system assembly similar to that of the AK-74M/AK-100 rifle family. Improvements added from the AK-12 include Picatinny rails, a new pistol grip, a new adjustable buttstock and a new flash hider. They feed from 30-round magazines, and are compatible with drum magazines from the RPK and RPK-74. After 2017 these arms were assigned AK-200 series designations.

As of 2018, the AK-200 series rifles are offered for export sales and for domestic law enforcement users in Russia.

===AK-12===

In 2010, the AK-12 series of proposed prototype models were unveiled. They differed in weight, introduced a new recoil compensation technology and improved ergonomics. The rear iron sight element was rail-mounted and moved to the back of the upper receiver to lengthen the sight line, and the full length of the weapon featured a Picatinny rail for mounting accessories such as aiming optics on top. The hand guard features Picatinny rails on both sides and its underside for mounting accessories like tactical lights, laser sights and grenade launchers. Throughout its development and evaluation stage the multiple modifications were applied to meet Russian military standards, as well as to improve upon the &quot;range of defects&quot; that were discovered on prototype models and to address concerns regarding the cost of earlier prototypes. In September 2016 the prototype models were replaced by the final production models of the AK-12 (chambered in 5.45×39mm) and AK-15 (chambered in 7.62×39mm) assault rifles.

Parallel developments are the RPK-16 light machine gun and the AM-17 compact assault rifle (both chambered in 5.45×39mm). The AK-12, AK-15 and RPK-16 technically strongly resembles the AK-74M, AK-100 series and RPK-74M than the earlier prototypes and the arms manufacturer Kalashnikov concern hopes they will replace these Russian service guns.

In late 2016 it was reported the AK-12 production model was undergoing troop trials with the Russian Army, where it competes against the Degtyarov A-545 balanced action assault rifle in Ratnik program trials. The AK-12 completed its operational testing and passed military field tests in June 2017, paving the way to Russian Army adoption, potentially under the Ratnik program. Both AK-12 and AK-15 completed testing in December 2017. In January 2018 it was announced that the AK-12 and AK-15 have been adopted by the Russian military.

<text>Peckham ( ) is a district in south-east London, within the London Borough of Southwark. It is south-east of Charing Cross. At the 2001 Census the Peckham ward had a population of 14,720.

==History==
&quot;Peckham&quot; is a Saxon place name meaning the village of the River Peck, a small stream that ran through the district until it was enclosed in 1823. Archaeological evidence indicates earlier Roman occupation in the area, although the name of this settlement is lost. &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names&quot; (1991, 1998) gives the origin as from the Old English *&quot;pēac&quot; and &quot;hām&quot; meaning ‘homestead by a peak or hill’. The name of the river is a back-formation from the name of the village. Peckham Rye is from Old English &quot;rīth&quot;, stream.

Following the Norman Conquest, the manor of Peckham was granted to Odo of Bayeux and held by the Bishop of Lisieux. It was described as being a hamlet on the road from Camberwell to Greenwich.

Peckham came within the newly created Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell and County of London in 1889. In 1965, the borough was abolished and the area then fell roughly within of the newly created London Borough of Southwark.

Peckham appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Pecheham&quot;. It was held by the Bishop of Lisieux from Odo of Bayeux. Its Domesday assets were: 2 hides. It had land for 1 plough, of meadow. It rendered 30 shillings (£1.50).

The manor was owned by King Henry I, who gave it to his son Robert, Earl of Gloucester. When Robert married the heiress to Camberwell the two manors were united under royal ownership. King John probably hunted at Peckham and local anecdotes suggest that the right to an annual fair was granted to celebrate a particularly good day&#x27;s sport. The fair grew to be a rowdy major event lasting three weeks until its abolition in 1827.

Peckham became popular as a wealthy residential area by the 16th century and there are several claims that Christopher Wren had local links. By the 18th century the area was a more commercial centre and attracted industrialists who wanted to avoid paying the expensive rents in central London. Peckham also boasted extensive market gardens and orchards growing produce for the nearby markets of London. Local produce included melons, figs and grapes. The formal gardens of the Peckham Manor House, rebuilt in 1672 by Sir Thomas Bond were particularly noticeable and can be seen on the Rocque map of 1746. The manor house was sacked in 1688, as its then owner Sir Henry Bond was a Roman Catholic and staunch supporter of James II. The house was finally demolished in 1797 for the formation of Peckham Hill Street, as the Shard family developed the area. Today Shard&#x27;s Terrace, the block that contains Manze&#x27;s Pie and Mash shop, and the western side of Peckham Hill Street represent this Georgian planned expansion.

The village was the last stopping point for many cattle drovers taking their livestock for sale in London. The drovers stayed in the local inns (such as the &quot;Red Cow&quot;) while the cattle were safely secured overnight in holding pens. Most of the villagers were agricultural or horticultural workers but with the early growth of the suburbs an increasing number worked in the brick industry that exploited the local London Clay. In the early 18th century nonconformist preacher Samuel Chandler was minister in Peckham.

In 1767 William Blake visited Peckham Rye and had a vision of an angel in a tree. In 1993, at the request of the Dulwich Festival, artist Stan Peskett painted a mural of Blake&#x27;s vision next to the Goose Green playground in East Dulwich.

===19th century===

At the beginning of the 19th century, Peckham was synonymous with Peckham Rye: a &quot;small, quiet, retired village surrounded by fields&quot;. Since 1744 stagecoaches had travelled with an armed guard between Peckham and London to give protection from highwaymen. The rough roads constrained traffic so a branch of the Grand Surrey Canal was proposed as a route from the Thames to Portsmouth. The canal was built from Surrey Commercial Docks to Peckham before the builders ran out of funds in 1826. The abbreviated canal was used to ship soft wood for construction and even though the canal was drained and backfilled in 1970, Whitten&#x27;s timber merchants stood on the site known as Eagle Wharf until it closed in 2019 and the location was designated for development.

In 1851 Thomas Tilling started an innovative omnibus service from Peckham to London. Tilling&#x27;s buses were the first to use pre-arranged bus stops, which helped them to run to a reliable timetable. His services expanded to cover much of London until his horses were requisitioned for the Army in the First World War.

During the mid-19th century, housing had spread north and west of Peckham Rye. The area in the north, towards Old Kent Road, on land previously owned by the Hill family (from whom the name Peckham Hill Street was derived) was initially known as Peckham New Town, although it would later become synonymous with Peckham in general (and the &quot;New Town&quot; was abandoned). In the area west of Peckham Rye Common and Peckham Rye Park, many large houses were built.

Peckham Rye railway station was opened, in 1865. With the arrival of the railway and the introduction of horse-drawn trams about ten years later, Peckham became accessible to artisans and clerical staff working in the city and the docks. Housing for this socio-economic group filled almost all the remaining fields except the Rye. In 1868 the vestry of Camberwell St Giles bought the Rye to keep it as common land. Responding to concerns about the dangerous overcrowding of the common on holidays the vestry bought the adjacent Homestall Farm (the last farm in the area) in 1894 and opened this as Peckham Rye Park.

With the influx of younger residents with money to spend Rye Lane became a major shopping street. Jones &amp; Higgins opened a small shop in 1867 (on the corner of Rye Lane and Peckham High Street) that became the best known department store in south London for many years. It closed in the 1980s. In 1870 George Gibson Bussey moved to Peckham and set up a firm described as &quot;Firearms, Ammunition &amp; Shooting” at the Museum Works, Rye Lane, Peckham. The Museum of Firearms was built in 1867. The Ordnance Survey Map of 1868 shows the museum building with a rifle range at the rear extending along the side of the railway embankment for 150 yards.

The late 19th century also saw the arrival of George Batty, a manufacturer of condiments, whose main business stood at Finsbury Pavement. The company&#x27;s Peckham premises occupied 19 railway arches. It was acquired by the H. J. Heinz Company in 1905 as their first UK manufacturing base.

The southern end of Peckham was the location for the railway line that once served the Crystal Palace in Sydenham. Though the line was eventually dismantled due to the collapse of the embankment into the gardens of Marmora Road it is still possible to see large sections of it. The flats on Wood Vale and the full length of Brenchley Gardens trace its route.

Close by is the Aquarius Golf Club, which is located over the cavernous Honor Oak Reservoir constructed between 1901 and 1909. When it was completed it was the largest brick built underground reservoir in the world and is still one of the largest in Europe. The reservoir now forms part of the Southern extension of the Thames Water Ring Main.

Camberwell Old Cemetery, on Forest Hill Road, is a later example of the ring of Victorian cemeteries that were built to alleviate the overcrowding of churchyards that was experienced with the rapid expansion of London in the 19th century. The Stone House at its main entrance was used as a film location for &quot;Entertaining Mr. Sloane&quot; (1970), adapted from the Joe Orton play. It was gutted by fire in the mid-1970s and rebuilt some years later. Camberwell Old Cemetery did not have the grandeur of nearby Nunhead Cemetery, which was one of the original London necropoleis, and once nearing capacity it was replaced by Camberwell New Cemetery on Brenchley Gardens.

Brenchley Gardens Park follows the route of the old line to the Crystal Palace culminating at the High Level station. The park runs behind Marmora Road and the remains of the embankment then continues along Wood Vale where flats were built on it. The line was closed in 1954 following a decline in its use after the destruction of the Crystal Palace in 1936 and due to slippage in the structure of the embankment.

===20th century===
In the 1930s George Scott Williamson and Innes Pearse opened the Pioneer Health Centre in Queens Road. They planned to conduct a large experiment into the effect of environment on health.
&#x27;The Peckham Experiment&#x27; recruited 950 families who paid one shilling () a week for access to something like a modern sports club with facilities for physical exercise, games, workshops and socialising with no mandatory programme. The centre moved into a purpose-built modernist building by the architect Sir Owen Williams in 1935.
 was heavily redeveloped in the 1960s, consisting mainly of high-rise flats to rehouse people from dilapidated old houses. It was popular on its completion for offering a high quality and modern standard of living. However, high unemployment and a lack of economic opportunities led to urban decay and a period of decline in the late 1970s. The North Peckham Estate became one of the most deprived residential areas in Western Europe. Vandalism, graffiti, arson attacks, burglaries, robberies and muggings were commonplace, and the area became an archetypal London sink estate. As a result, the area was subjected to a £290 million regeneration programme in the late 1990s and early 2000s. After the beginning of the regeneration, the estate gained nationwide notoriety in the media when 10-year-old Nigerian resident Damilola Taylor was stabbed to death on the estate on 27 November 2000. A gang operating in the area is the Peckham Boys.

In the early 1990s Peckham was a centre of underground music partly due to a large squat known as The Dolehouse in a disused, two-floor DHSS building near Peckham High Street. The building was already known for having featured in the cover shot of a 1980s pictorial biography of 1960s&#x27; mods, featuring them on their customised scooters outside the then Camberwell Labour Exchange. In 1989 the squatters adopted the name &quot;Dole House Crew&quot; and along with another local group of squatters called the &quot;Green Circus&quot;, held regular gigs/parties in the building. They moved on to many other South East London venues after the Peckham Dolehouse was evicted in late October 1990. A squatted social centre called the Spike Surplus Scheme ran from 1998 until being evicted by the council in 2009.

Peckham was one of the areas where riots took place during the 2011 England riots.

Peckham was home to the Peckham Black Women&#x27;s Centre until 1990, and to the Black Lesbian and Gay Centre from 1992 to 1995. In 2024 a Rainbow Plaque commemorating the Black Lesbian and Gay Centre was unveiled on Bellenden Road.

==Current status==

Since the 1990s the European Union has invested in the regeneration of the area; partly funding the award-winning Peckham Library, a new town square and new housing to replace the North Peckham Estate. State funding is being provided to improve the housing stock and renovate the streets. This includes funding for public arts projects like the Tom Phillips mosaics on the wall of the Peckham Experiment restaurant.

1994 saw the completion of the Peckham Arch designed by architects Troughton McAslan and funded in part by a £1m SRB (Single Regeneration Budget) grant. The arch is due to be demolished to make way for 19 flats; the decision was made despite public protests.

The main shopping street is Rye Lane and the large Peckham Rye Park is nearby. Bellenden Road is an area of small independent shops.

==Culture and identity==
Peckham has never been an administrative district, or a single ecclesiastical parish in its own right, but it developed a strong sense of identity in the 19th century when Rye Lane was one of the most important shopping streets in south London. The area is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London.

The area known as Peckham covers a large area of south London and takes in many diverse communities. The British Nigerian community forms a sizeable component of the population of the area, with the area being dubbed &quot;Little Lagos&quot; as a result. As of 2011, the whole Peckham area had a Nigerian-born population of 5,250 people. A traditional London working class community now coexists with communities that have their origins in the Caribbean, China, India, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Somalia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Turkey, Eastern Europe and Vietnam. As well as these communities there has been a steady gentrification of some of the areas in the south of Peckham and this has meant an influx of cafés, wine bars, niche shops and artists&#x27; studios.

==Ethnicity==
Peckham is one of the most ethnically diverse areas of the UK. These are the statistics for the ethnic groups in the Peckham ward according to the 2011 Census. This ward is about one-fifth of the place called Peckham, and not representative of the ethnic and cultural distribution in the other four wards.
* 50.4% Black/African/Caribbean
* 29.2% White
* 9.1% Asian
* 7.1% Mixed/multiple ethnic groups
* 4.3% Other ethnic group

==In fiction==

Muriel Spark&#x27;s novel &quot;The Ballad of Peckham Rye&quot; (1960) is set in the area.

Peckham was the setting of the television sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; in its run as a regular series from 1981 to 1991, as well as Christmas specials until 2003. The majority of the scenes were filmed in Bristol, and around other parts of London. The spin-off, &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot;, was also set in Peckham in the 1960s.

The television situation comedy &quot;Desmond&#x27;s&quot;, made by Channel 4, as well as its spin-off, &quot;Porkpie&quot;, were filmed and set in Peckham. Also, the comedies &quot;Meet the Adebanjos&quot; and &quot;The Tboy Show&quot; (both directed by Debra Odutuyo) were set in Peckham.

A 30-minute musical called &quot;We The Ragamuffin&quot; was set in Peckham, and filmed in the area, mainly on the North Peckham Estate. The film used local musicians with an improvised script and was broadcast on Channel 4 in February 1992. The film was written and produced by Russell Newell and directed by Julian Henriques.

Peckham was home of the fictional character Rose Tyler, a former leading character in the British TV show &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Her flat on a fictional council estate in the area is regularly shown during her time on the show.

The E4 show &quot;Youngers&quot; is filmed and set in Peckham.

In the television series &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot;, Series Eight, Adam Wainright, Samantha&#x27;s husband, is elected in 1947 as Labour Member of Parliament for the (fictional) constituency of &#x27;West Peckham&#x27;.

Four of the 12 main characters in Bernardine Evaristo&#x27;s novel &quot;Girl, Woman, Other&quot; are connected to the fictive Peckham School for Boys and Girls as either teachers or pupils.

The film &quot;Rye Lane&quot; is largely set in Peckham, and is named for the street there. The film features real-life locations, including the restaurants Coal Rooms and Il Giardino, Rye Lane Market, the Rye Lane branch of Morley&#x27;s, and the Peckhamplex cinema.

Key scenes in the 2023 romantic comedy &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; take place at the fictional Peckham House.

===Nearest railway stations===

Like most of southeast London, Peckham has never been served by the London Underground. However, if and when the Bakerloo line extension is complete, a new tube station will be built on Asylum Road northeast of the centre of Peckham, near the A2 road and Brimmington Park. It will be located between another new station at Burgess Park and the existing railway station at New Cross Gate. Existing railway stations in the district are as follows:

* Peckham Rye railway station
* Queens Road Peckham railway station
* Nunhead railway station

===Bus transport===
Peckham bus garage is currently operated by London Central and is situated in Blackpool Road. It opened in 1994 and replaced a similar but larger facility in Peckham High Street on part of whose site the present bus station now stands. A viaduct behind it carries the railway east of Peckham Rye railway station.

<text>Penge () is a suburb of South East London, England, now in the London Borough of Bromley, west of Bromley, north east of Croydon and south east of Charing Cross.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Penge&quot; is first attested in charter of 1067, as &quot;penceat&quot;, and in a twelfth-century copy of a charter of 957 as &quot;pænge&quot; (where the place is described as a &quot;wood&quot; (, and in which King Eadwig gives Penge Common to the thane Lyfing). The name comes from the Common Brittonic words that survive in modern Welsh as (&quot;head, end, summit&quot;) and (&quot;woodland&quot;), and thus it once meant &quot;end of the wood&quot;, like a number of similar names, including Pencoed in Wales.

The largest amosite mine in the world, in South Africa, was named Penge apparently because one of the British directors thought the two areas were similar in appearance.

==History==
Penge was once a small hamlet attached to the manor of Battersea; it became independent from the manor in 1888.

===Pensgreene and the Crooked Billet===
Penge was an inconspicuous area with few residents before the arrival of the railways. A traveller passing through Penge would have noticed the large common with a small inn on its boundary. Penge Green appears as Pensgreene on Kip&#x27;s 1607 map. The green was bounded to the north by Penge Lane, the west by Beckenham Road and the southeast by the Crooked Billet. On a modern map that is a very small area, but the modern-day Penge Lane and Crooked Billet are not in their original locations, and Beckenham Road would have been little more than a cart track following the property line on the west side of Penge High Street. Penge Lane was the road from Penge to Sydenham which is now named St John&#x27;s Road and Newlands Park. There was also an old footpath crossing the Green leading to Sydenham, that was known as Old Penge Lane. After the London, Chatham and Dover Railway was built, Penge Lane crossed the line by level crossing. When this crossing was closed, Penge Lane was renamed and Old Penge Lane became the present-day Penge Lane.
The 1868 Ordnance Survey map shows the Old Crooked Billet located to the southeast of the current location. This earlier location was on the eastward side of Penge Green, which disappeared as a result of the (7 &amp; 8 Geo. 4. c. &quot;35&quot; ) which enclosed the whole green. This left the Crooked Billet with no frontage to Beckenham Road; hence, new premises were constructed on the present site in 1827, and subsequently replaced in 1840 with a three-storey building. This was severely damaged by enemy action in the Second World War, and subsequently rebuilt.

The Crooked Billet (pictured above) is by far the oldest public house in Penge. Peter Abbott states that it was there in 1601, and speculates that it might be much more ancient. In modern times it is particularly well known for lending its name to a bus route terminus. From 1914, General Omnibus routes 109 and 609 operated, along different paths, between Bromley Market and the Crooked Billet. The 109 was renumbered 227 by London Transport, and continued to terminate at the Crooked Billet. (Route 609 was shortened, terminating in Beckenham). Around 1950, some services were extended past the Crooked Billet to Crystal Palace. Eventually nearly all buses travelled the extended route. The 354 buses now use the terminus, as do short-running buses on routes 194 and 358.

William Hone wrote about a visit to the Crooked Billet in 1827 and included a detailed sketch of the last building on the original site.

===Expansion===
The London and Croydon Canal was built across Penge Common along what is now the line of the railway through Penge West railway station, deviating to the south before Anerley railway station. There is a remnant at the northern corner of Betts Park, Anerley. Following the closure of the canal, the London and Croydon Railway was built largely along the same course, opening in 1839. Isambard Kingdom Brunel built an atmospheric railway along this alignment as far as Croydon. The Crystal Palace pneumatic railway, which ran underground between the Sydenham and Penge entrances to Crystal Palace Park, operated for a short while but proved not to be economically viable.

In the Victorian era, Penge developed into a fashionable suburb because of the railway line and its proximity to the relocated Crystal Palace. It became a fashionable day out to visit the Crystal Palace during the day and to take the tram down the hill to one of the &#x27;twenty-five pubs to the square mile&#x27; that Penge was reputed to possess, or the two music halls—The King&#x27;s Hall (later the Gaumont cinema) and, established in 1915, the Empire Theatre (later the Essoldo cinema).

By 1862, Stanford&#x27;s map of London and its Suburbs shows large homes had been constructed along Penge New Road (now Crystal Palace Park Road, Sydenham and Penge High Street), Thick Wood (now Thicket) Road and Anerley Road.
This all came to an end in 1875 and 1877, with the notorious Penge murders. In 1875 Frederick Hunt murdered his wife and children, then in 1877 a wealthy heiress, Harriet Staunton, together with her infant son, was starved to death by her husband and his associates. In 1934, Elizabeth Jenkins published the novel &quot;Harriet&quot;, based on the case, whilst Forbes Road was renamed to Mosslea Road because of its connection with the murders.
==Governance==
Penge formed a part of the parish of Battersea, with the historic county boundary between Kent and Surrey forming its eastern boundary. In 1855 both parts of the parish were included in the area of the Metropolitan Board of Works, with Penge Hamlet Vestry electing six members to the Lewisham District Board of Works. The Local Government Act 1888 abolished the Metropolitan Board, with its area becoming the County of London. However, the London Government Act 1899 subsequently made provision for Penge to be removed from the County of London and annexed to either Surrey or Kent. Accordingly, an Order in Council transferred the hamlet to Kent in 1900, constituting it as Penge Urban District. The urban district was abolished in 1965 by the London Government Act 1963, and its former area merged with that of other districts to form the London Borough of Bromley. With the creation of the Penge Urban District, Penge New Road (formerly the part of Beckenham Road north of Kent House Road) was renamed Penge High Street.

The urban district comprised three sub-districts: Anerley, Penge and Upper Norwood. It incorporated the whole of Crystal Palace Park except for part of the eastern side running along Crystal Palace Park Road which was then administered by Beckenham Urban District. 
From 1885, the Hamlet of Penge was part of the Dulwich parliamentary constituency, which was then in Surrey, and remained in that seat until 1918, when it was transferred to the new Bromley constituency. From 1950, it was part of the Beckenham constituency. At the 2010 general election, Penge formed part of the Lewisham West and Penge constituency. In 2024 it again changed to become part of the new Beckenham and Penge constituency. In local government, Penge is contained in the Penge and Cator ward, which had a population of 17,326 in 2011.

==Culture and community==
*Penge is home to a number of taverns and public houses; indeed it was noted in Victorian times for its &#x27;25 pubs to the square mile&#x27;. The Crooked Billet is by far the oldest.
*The Pawleyne Arms is currently the terminus for the 176 bus service. It was previously an intermediate turning point for short-running buses on the 12, 75 and 194 bus services, becoming the southern terminus for route 12 between 1986 and 1988, when the route was again shortened.
*The public houses in Maple Road have nearly all changed their names. The Dew Drop Inn was known as The Market Tavern (and featured in the television series &quot;The Bill&quot; as the Market Tavern in Canley Market) before its closure. The London Tavern became The Hop Exchange and then The Hop House. It was closed by 2006, and in 2009 it was undergoing conversion into residential accommodation. The Lord Palmerston has been delicensed and is now a pizza outlet. The King William IV became The Crown and is now The Maple Tree. Only The Golden Lion (now closed) retained its name, although it extended its premises substantially; it was listed in every edition of the &quot;Good Beer Guide&quot; from 1976 to 1987.
Closed pubs include The Golden Lion, Kent House Tavern, Robin Hood (closed, subsequently destroyed by fire in 2006 and demolished), Royal Oak (closed 2011), Queen Adelaide Arms (closed 2010), The Mitre (closed 2018), The Goat House (destroyed by fire and now demolished), The Waterman&#x27;s Arms (now Superdrug), The Anchor (closed circa 1910), The General Simpson, The General Jackson, The Retreat, The Cornish Arms, The Railway Bell, The Thicket Tavern, The Paxton and Hollywood East (closed 2017) (formerly The Park Tavern). The last-named was the venue for the 1877 inquest into the murder of Harriet Staunton.
*Penge also has several clubs, including a Conservative Club, The Penge &amp; District Trade Union &amp; Labour Social Club (CIU), built by local tradesmen in 1922, and the former Liberal Club, which closed in 2005.
*Penge has a contemporary fine art gallery called Tension, which opened in April 2019 at 135 Maple Road.

===Community facilities===
Fragments of the original Penge Common still survive in Betts Park. Winsford Gardens formed part of the grounds of Chesham Park and later Winsford House.

==Landmarks==
*There are several Victorian almshouses in Penge, the oldest being the Free Watermen and Lightermen&#x27;s Almshouses (also known as the Royal Watermen&#x27;s Almshouses), built in 1840–1841 on Beckenham Road, to designs by George Porter by the Company of Watermen and Lightermen of the City of London, for retired company freemen and their widows. The residents were moved in 1973 to a new site in Hastings and the original buildings were converted into private homes.
*The Queen Adelaide Almshouses, also known as the King William Naval Asylum, St. John&#x27;s Road, founded in 1847 and built in 1848 to designs by Philip Hardwick at the request and expense of Queen Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, the widow of King William IV, to provide shelter for twelve widows or orphan daughters of naval officers. Again, the almshouses are now private residences.
*St. John&#x27;s Cottages on Maple Road were built as almshouses in 1863, designed by the architect Edwin Nash. As with their predecessors, the cottages are now privately owned homes. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1959, No.8 was destroyed by a gas explosion, killing one person. The cottage was rebuilt to closely resemble the original.
*The police station at the corner of the High Street and Green Lane is believed to have been London&#x27;s oldest working police station when it was closed in 2010.
*When completed in 1956 the Crystal Palace Transmitter was the tallest structure in the UK, a record it lost to the Anglia Television transmitter at Belmont, Lincolnshire in 1959. It remained the tallest structure in the London area until 1991.

==Education==
St Johns C.E. Primary School was originally part of the Old Penge Chapel, which opened in 1837. Early in the 1850s, following the completion of St John the Evangelist, the school took over the entire old chapel building. The school&#x27;s site was extended in 1977, and a new school building was opened in September 1978.

The Beckenham and Penge County Grammar School for boys, formerly the Beckenham Technical Institute which opened in 1901, moved to a new site on Penge High Street between Kent House Road and Kingsdale Road in 1931. It moved from Penge to its present location in Eden Park, Beckenham, in January 1969.

==Religious sites==

St John the Evangelist&#x27;s Church, Penge (pictured right) in Beckenham Road, was built in 1850 to designs by Edwin Nash &amp; J. N. Round. Penge Congregational Church was built in 1912 to designs by P. Morley Horder with passage aisles and clerestory, shafts on large, excellently carved corbels, and a stained glass window by William Morris.

==Sport==
Crystal Palace Park contains the National Sports Centre, which includes an international-class athletic stadium, and a former motorsport circuit that was used in the 1969 film &quot;The Italian Job&quot;. The Crystal Palace Park once housed a football ground, which hosted the FA Cup final from 1895 to 1914, as well as London County Cricket Club games from 1900 to 1908, when the club folded, and Crystal Palace FC&#x27;s matches from their formation in 1905 until the club was forced to relocate during the First World War. Other facilities include Alexandra Recreation Ground, Penge Recreation Ground and Royston Playing Fields.

==Cultural references==
After the Crystal Palace was moved to Penge Place, a fashionable day out was to visit the Crystal Palace during the day and to take the tram down the hill to one of the &#x27;twenty-five pubs to the square mile&#x27; or two Music Halls.

*Horace Rumpole, a barrister known as &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;, frequently tells others of his greatest triumph, winning an acquittal in the Penge Bungalow Murders &quot;alone and without a leader.&quot; Author John Mortimer&#x27;s original chronology was incorrect, as the Penge bungalows were prefabricated houses which replaced homes destroyed during the Second World War, long after the date of Rumpole&#x27;s claimed triumph. When the details of the trial were later documented by Mortimer in the novel &quot;Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders&quot; in 2002, he moved the events to the early 1950s.

<text>A muzzle brake or recoil compensator is a device connected to, or a feature integral (ported barrel) to the construction of, the muzzle or barrel of a firearm or cannon that is intended to redirect a portion of propellant gases to counter recoil and unwanted muzzle rise. Barrels with an integral muzzle brake are often said to be ported.

The concept of a muzzle brake was first introduced for artillery. It was a common feature on many anti-tank guns, especially those mounted on tanks, in order to reduce the area needed to take up the strokes of recoil and kickback. They have been used in various forms for rifles and pistols to help control recoil and the rising of the barrel that normally occurs after firing. They are used on pistols for practical pistol competitions, and are usually called compensators in this context.

== History ==
The concept of a muzzle brake had been experimented with for many years prior to its successful implementation: in 1922, a US Army Ordnance Department official stated in US Congress that &quot;the muzzle brake was used in another form 20 years ago, and even longer ago than that, but it has never been successfully applied&quot;.

Antoine Treuille de Beaulieu invented a prototype based on the idea in 1842 and had it tested in 1862, but he himself called the idea &quot;too new&quot;. A US patent was issued for a &quot;recoil obviator&quot; in 1871 (there is no indication it was ever tested), while an experimental British anti-tank rifle in 1918 featured a muzzle brake, but was not adopted.

In the later 1920s, there was some limited progress: around 1926, Cutts compensator became an option in the Thompson SMG (R. M. Cutts&#x27; earliest patent is from 1925), in 1927 Škoda patented a family of muzzle brake designs, one of which was used on 8 cm kanon vz. 28, and in 1928, Schneider et Cie (which was allied with Škoda at the time) updated their 220 mm TR mle 1915/1916 with a muzzle brake patented by Eugène Schneider II way back in 1912.
In mid-1930s, Bofors designed several successful artillery pieces (e. g. 37-mm and 105-mm guns) with new perforated muzzle brakes, so-called pepper-pot muzzle brakes, a design invented by then Swedish artillery captain and therefore known in Sweden as a &quot;Jentzen-brake&quot; (). The Soviet Union started modernizing old artillery systems with new barrels, such as the 107 mm gun M1910/30, 152 mm gun M1910/30 etc., predominantly featuring cylindrical muzzle brakes with long slits on each side. Several European countries started designing and producing anti-tank rifles featuring muzzle brakes. In late 1930s and especially during World War II the device became common on both firearms and artillery pieces.

Overall, the development of the muzzle brake was a gradual process that involved experimentation and refinement over many years.
== Rationale in firearms ==
The interchangeable terms muzzle rise, muzzle flip, or muzzle climb refer to the tendency of a handheld firearm&#x27;s front end (the muzzle end of the barrel) to rise after firing. Firearms with less height from the grip line to the barrel centerline tend to experience less muzzle rise.

The muzzle rises primarily because, for most firearms, the centerline of the barrel is above the center of contact between the shooter and the firearm&#x27;s grip and stock. The reactive forces from the fired bullet and propellant gases exiting the muzzle act directly down the centerline of the barrel. If that line of force is above the center of the contact points, this creates a moment or torque (rotational force) that causes the firearm to rotate and the muzzle to rise.

== Design and construction ==
Muzzle brakes are simple in concept, such as the one employed on the 90 mm M3 gun used on the M47 Patton tank. This consists of a small length of tubing (mounted at right angles) at the end of the barrel. Brakes most often utilize slots, vents, holes, baffles, and similar devices. The strategy of a muzzle brake is to redirect and control the burst of combustion gases following the departure of a projectile.

All muzzle brake designs share a basic principle: to partially divert combustion gases from the muzzle end of the bore at a (generally) perpendicular angle to the long axis of the barrel. The momentum of the diverted gases thus does not add to the recoil. The angle toward which the gases are directed will fundamentally affect how the brake behaves. If gases are directed upward, they will exert a downward force and counteract muzzle rise. Any device that is attached to the end of the muzzle will also add mass, increasing its inertia and moving its center of mass forward; the former will reduce recoil and the latter will reduce muzzle rise.
Construction of a muzzle brake or compensator can be as simple as a diagonal cut at the muzzle end of the barrel to direct some of the escaping gas upward. On the AKM assault rifle, the brake also angles slightly to the right to counteract the sideways movement of the rifle under recoil.

Another simple method is porting, where holes or slots are machined into the barrel near the muzzle to allow the gas to escape.

More advanced designs use baffles and expansion chambers to slow escaping gases. This is the basic principle behind a linear compensator. Ports are often added to the expansion chambers, producing the long, multi-chambered recoil compensators often seen on IPSC raceguns.

== Venting direction ==
Most linear compensators redirect the gases forward. Since that is where the bullet is going, they typically work by allowing the gases to expand into the compensator, which surrounds the muzzle but only has holes facing forward; like any device which allows the gases to expand before leaving the firearm, they are effectively a type of muzzle shroud. They reduce muzzle rise similarly to the mechanism by which a sideways brake does: since all the gas is escaping in the same direction, any muzzle rise would need to alter the velocity of the gas, which costs kinetic energy. When the brake redirects the gases directly backward, instead, the effect is similar to the reverse thrust system on an aircraft jet engine: any blast energy coming back at the shooter is pushing &quot;against&quot; the recoil, effectively reducing the actual amount of recoil on the shooter. Of course, this also means the gases are directed toward the shooter.

When the gases are primarily directed upward, the braking is referred to as &quot;porting&quot;. Porting typically involves precision-drilled ports or holes in the forward top part of the barrel and slide on pistols. These holes divert a portion of the gases expelled prior to the departure of the projectile in a direction that reduces the tendency of the firearm to rise. The concept is an application of Newton&#x27;s third law; the exhaust directed upward causes a reciprocal force downward. This is why firearms are never ported on the bottom of the barrel, as that would exacerbate muzzle rise, rather than mitigate it. Porting has the undesired consequences of shortening the effective barrel length and reducing muzzle velocity, while a muzzle brake is an extension added to the barrel and does not reduce muzzle velocity. Porting has the advantage for faster follow-up shots, especially for 3-round burst operation.

== Effectiveness ==

Although there are numerous ways to measure the energy of a recoil impulse, in general, a 10% to 50% reduction can be measured. Some muzzle brake manufacturers claim greater recoil reduction percentages. Muzzle brakes need sufficient propellant gas volume and high gas pressure at the muzzle of the firearm to achieve well-measured recoil reduction percentages. This means cartridges with a small bore area to case volume ratio (overbore cartridges) combined with a high operating pressure benefit more from recoil reduction with muzzle brakes than smaller standard cartridges.

Besides reducing felt recoil, one of the primary advantages of a muzzle brake is the reduction of muzzle rise. This lets a shooter realign a weapon&#x27;s sights more quickly. This is relevant for fully automatic weapons. Muzzle rise can theoretically be eliminated by an efficient design. Because the rifle moves rearward less, the shooter has little to compensate for. Muzzle brakes benefit rapid-fire, fully automatic fire, and large-bore hunting rifles. They are also common on small-bore vermin rifles, where reducing the muzzle rise lets the shooter see the bullet impact through a telescopic sight. A reduction in recoil also reduces the chance of undesired (painful) contacts between the shooter&#x27;s head and the ocular of a telescopic sight or other aiming components that must be positioned near the shooter&#x27;s eye (often referred to as &quot;scope eye&quot;). Another advantage of a muzzle brake is a reduction of recoil fatigue during extended practice sessions, enabling the shooter to consecutively fire more rounds accurately. Further, flinch (involuntary pre-trigger-release anxiety behavior resulting in inaccurate aiming and shooting) caused by excessive recoil may be reduced or eliminated.

== Disadvantages ==

The shooter, gun crew, or close bystanders may perceive an increase in sound pressure level as well as an increase in muzzle blast and lead exposure. This occurs because the sound, flash, pressure waves, and lead loaded smoke plume normally projected away from the shooter are now partially redirected outward to the side or sometimes at partially backward angles toward the shooter or gun crew. Standard eye and ear protection, important for all shooters, may not be adequate to avoid hearing damage with the muzzle blast partially vectored back toward the gun crew or spotters by arrowhead shaped reactive muzzle brakes found on sniper teams firing anti-materiel rifles like the Barrett M82.

Measurements indicate that on a rifle, a muzzle brake adds 5 to 10 dB to the normal noise level perceived by the shooter, increasing total noise levels up to 160 dB(A) ± 3 dB. Painful discomfort occurs at approximately 120 to 125 dB(A), with some references claiming 133 dB(A) for the threshold of pain.

Brakes and compensators also add length, diameter, and mass to the muzzle end of a firearm, where it most influences its handling and may interfere with accuracy as muzzle rise will occur when the brake is removed and shooting without the brake can throw off the strike of the round.

Another problem can occur when saboted ammunition is used as the sabot tends to break up inside the brake. The problem is particularly pronounced when armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding-sabot (APFSDS), a type of long-rod penetrator (LRP) (or kinetic energy penetrator), are used. Since these APFSDS rounds are the most common armour-piercing ammunition currently, virtually no modern main battle tank guns have muzzle brakes.

A serious tactical disadvantage of muzzle brakes on both small arms and artillery is that, depending on their designs, they may cause escaping gases to throw up dust and debris clouds that impair visibility and reveal one&#x27;s position, not to mention posing a hazard to individuals without eye protection. Troops often wet the ground in front of antitank guns in defensive emplacements to prevent this, and snipers are specially trained in techniques for suppressing or concealing the magnified effects of lateral muzzle blast when firing rifles with such brakes. Linear compensators and suppressors do not have the disadvantages of a redirected muzzle blast; they actually reduce the blast by venting high pressure gas forward at reduced velocity.

The redirection of larger amounts of escaping high-pressure gas can cause discomfort caused by blast-induced sinus cavity concussion. Such discomfort can especially become a problem for anti-materiel rifle shooters due to the larger than normal cartridges with accompanying large case capacities and propellant volumes these rifles use and can be a reason for promoting accelerated shooter fatigue and flinching. Furthermore, the redirected blast may direct pressure waves toward the eye, potentially leading to retinal detachment when repeated shooting is performed with anti-materiel and large caliber weapons.

==Examples==
== Ported chamber ==
A barrel chamber with pressure relief ports that allows gas to leak around the cartridge during extraction. Basically the opposite of a fluted chamber as it is intended for the cartridge to stick to the chamber wall making a slight delay of extraction. This requires a welded-on sleeve with an annular groove to contain the pressure.

== US legislation and regulation ==
The State of California outlaws flash suppressors on semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines, but allows muzzle brakes to be used instead.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) made a regulatory determination in 2013 that the muzzle device of the SIG Sauer MPX Carbine, adapted from the baffle core of the integrally suppressed version&#x27;s suppressor and claimed by SIG to be a muzzle brake, constituted a silencer and rendered the MPX-C a Title II NFA weapon. SIG Sauer, the rifle&#x27;s maker, sued the ATF in 2014 to have the designation overturned. In September 2015, Federal Judge Paul Barbadora upheld the ATF&#x27;s ruling; despite SIG successfully establishing that the muzzle device did not suppress the weapon&#x27;s sound, the ATF successfully established that it was &quot;intended&quot; to suppress the sound, which was legally sufficient.

<doc id="94226" wikidata="Q83294" url="?curid=94226" title="Perivale">
<text>Perivale () is a mainly residential suburban town of Greater London, west of Charing Cross. It is the smallest of the seven towns which make up the London Borough of Ealing.
Perivale is predominately residential, with a library, community centre, a number of parks and open spaces, as well as a large industrial estate. Landmarks include the grade II* listed Art Deco Hoover Building, as well as St Mary&#x27;s Church (c. 12th century), Horsenden Hill park and Perivale Wood Local Nature Reserve run by the Selborne Society. Perivale forms part of the UB6 postcode area, along with Greenford.

==Toponymy==

The name of Perivale was first used in 1508, where it was spelt &quot;Pyryvale&quot;. The word seems to be a compound of perie (pear tree) and vale, a wide valley. Until then, Perivale was often called &quot;Little Greenford&quot; or &quot;Greenford Parva&quot;, to distinguish it from its larger neighbour Great Greenford.

==History==
===Origins and early history===
Historically, it was a parish in the hundred of Elthorne, in the county of Middlesex. Perivale was one of the county&#x27;s smallest parishes up until the early twentieth century, at just and a negligible population.

The church of St Mary&#x27;s, Perivale is one of London&#x27;s oldest churches, dating to at least the early thirteenth century. The church is south of the A40, off Perivale Lane. The neighbouring fifteenth-century Rectory House was demolished in 1958. Perivale was a farming area from at least the fourteenth century. At this date, Perivale consisted of woodland and fields used for arable farming.

During the fifteenth century, a grand, three-storey manor house, &quot;Perivale Manor&quot;, was commissioned by Henry Myllett, a prominent Perivale resident. The house was surrounded by a moat, gardens, orchards and outbuildings. Perivale Manor, which was close to St Mary&#x27;s Church, was demolished around 1784.

From the sixteenth century, wheat was the main crop in the area, a crop for which Perivale gained a high reputation. With industrialisation, much of Perivale&#x27;s land began to be used to grow grass for hay to feed London&#x27;s horses. The building of the Paddington Branch of the Grand Union Canal in 1801 (which still runs through Perivale today) led to a high demand for Perivale&#x27;s hay. By 1839, almost all of Perivale&#x27;s land grew hay for the London market, a scene described in the ending of John Betjeman&#x27;s poem &quot;Return to Ealing&quot;:

&quot;...And a gentle gale from Perivale/blows up the hayfield scent.&quot;

The pre-twentieth-century population of Perivale remained low. Just 28 people lived in Perivale in 1801. An 1841 census recorded just five inhabited residential buildings, all farm houses; Horsenden Farm to the northwest, Grange Farm and Church Farm in the southwest, Manor Farm to the east and Alperton farm to the north. In 1901, the population remained tiny at 60 people.

===Development and urbanisation, 1930s onwards===
Things changed with transportation developments in an increasingly urban and expanding London. The A40 Western Avenue was built, running east–west across central and west London, cutting through Perivale. Perivale was also connected to central London via both Perivale train and the then named Alperton-Perivale Station (now Alperton Underground Station). Perivale&#x27;s close proximity to central London and excellent transport links led to its rapid expansion, with many factories and houses being built. Houses were initially built in the centre of Perivale, on and around Horsenden Lane South and at Bilton Road to the east. The Medway Estate, to the west of Horsenden Lane South, was developed soon after with parkland left in the centre (now named Ealing Central Sports Ground).

The factory of Sanderson Wallpapers Ltd was built in 1929. By 1963, the firm employed almost 2,000 people. The iconic Hoover Building was opened in 1932 by Hoover Limited. Located on the northern side of the Western Avenue, the factory employed more than 3,000 people at its height of production in the 1960s, making vacuum cleaners and other household appliances. Sanderson&#x27;s and Hoover were hailed as model factories, with workers enjoying enviable working conditions. Workers could purchase the reasonably priced local housing stock. Perivale&#x27;s three-bedroom homes had front and rear gardens; many had garages, and sold for around £600-£700 freehold. By 1951, Perivale&#x27;s population had jumped to 9,979. The Hoover Factory closed in the 1980s: part of the building was bought by Tesco, which opened as a superstore in the 1990s. The upper levels of the main building were recently converted into luxury flats.

Perivale Maternity Hospital, built in 1937 and demolished in 1988, was situated south of the A40 Western Avenue. Its location explains the large number of notable births in Perivale.

==Demography==

Perivale has the highest number of Polish residents in London. As such, the widest spoken foreign language in Perivale is Polish, the primary language of 2,024 residents.

Perivale has a relatively high rate of home ownership. 62% of households own their own home. 27% of homes are privately rented with just 9% of households living in rented social housing.

==Literature and the media==

Perivale is one of the settings of Anthony Trollope&#x27;s novel &quot;The Belton Estate&quot; (1865).

Perivale appears in John Betjeman&#x27;s 1954 poem &quot;Middlesex&quot; as a “parish of enormous hayfields”
Perivale was the setting for the 1989 season twenty-six &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Survival&quot; as the hometown of the Seventh Doctor&#x27;s companion Ace. There were several locations used in and around Perivale during filming, including Bleasdale Avenue, Medway Parade, Colwyn Avenue, Woodhouse Avenue, Children&#x27;s Play Area, Ealing Central Sports Ground, Horsenden Lane South, and the nearby Horsenden Hill. Victorian Perivale was also the location for establishing shots of a manor which was the setting of another season twenty-six serial, &quot;Ghost Light&quot;.

Parts of the film &quot;Snatch&quot; were filmed in Perivale and on the nearby Horsenden Hill.

Henry Perowne, the principal character in Ian McEwan&#x27;s novel &quot;Saturday&quot;, was born in Perivale. &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; used Horsenden Hill for location shooting in the episode where Del Boy and Rodney &#x27;look after&#x27; Marlene and Boycie&#x27;s dog (only to feed it reheated pork and give it food poisoning).

<text>Petersham is a village in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames on the east of the bend in the River Thames south of Richmond, which it shares with neighbouring Ham. It provides the foreground of the scenic view from Richmond Hill across Petersham Meadows, with Ham House further along the river. Other nearby places include Twickenham, Isleworth, Teddington, Mortlake, and Roehampton.

==History==

Petersham appears in Domesday Book (1086) as &quot;Patricesham&quot;. It was held by Chertsey Abbey. Its assets were: 4 hides; 1 church, 5 ploughs, 1 fishery worth 1,000 eels and 1000 lampreys, of meadow. It rendered £6 10s 0d.

Archibald Campbell, later 3rd Duke of Argyll and Earl of Islay, was born at Ham House in 1682. He went on to found the Royal Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh in 1727.

The explorer George Vancouver retired to Petersham, where he wrote &quot;A Voyage Of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean, and Round the World&quot;. He lived in a house in River Lane that is now two separate dwellings – Navigator&#x27;s House (formerly known as Craigmyle Cottage) and Glen Cottage. He died in 1798 and is buried in the churchyard of Petersham Parish Church. The Portland stone monument over his grave, renovated in the 1960s, is now Grade II listed in view of its historical associations.

In 1839 Charles Dickens rented Elm Cottage, renamed Elm Lodge, where he wrote &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;.

In 1847 Queen Victoria granted Pembroke Lodge in the Petersham part of Richmond Park to John Russell, 1st Earl Russell, and it became the Russell family home. Lord Russell&#x27;s grandson, Bertrand Russell, spent some of his childhood there. During World War II the GHQ Liaison Regiment (also known as Phantom) established its regimental headquarters nearby at the Richmond Hill Hotel, with its base (including the officers&#x27; mess and billet) at Pembroke Lodge.

In the early 19th century, Charles Stanhope, styled Lord Petersham, later Earl of Harrington, gave the Petersham name to a type of greatcoat. In 1955 Petersham also gave its name to , which was a .


==Landmarks==
===Notable buildings===
Listed buildings include a watchman&#x27;s box, that also served as a village lock-up and dates from 1787.

Petersham Road (part of the A307) includes an extremely sharp right-angled bend edged by a pair of handsome wrought iron gates. This is the entrance to Montrose House, one of the most notable houses in Petersham. After a spate of serious accidents on the bend in the road, the neighbours formed a group in the 1850s called Trustees of the Road. The Hon. Algernon Tollemache of Ham House was their leader and they managed to persuade the owner of Montrose House to part with some land to reduce the sharpness of the bend. But various dents in the brick wall today reveal that motorists are still taken unawares by it.

Adjacent to Montrose House and equally as impressive is Rutland Lodge, built in 1666 for a Lord Mayor of London; it is Grade II* listed.

Another historic house in Petersham is Douglas House, just off the west drive to Ham House. One of its notable inhabitants was Catherine, Duchess of Queensberry. In 1969 it was bought by the Federal Republic of Germany for use as a German school. New buildings have been erected in the grounds, but the original house and stables have been preserved.

==Transport==
Petersham is served by only two bus routes: the 65 and 371, both linking the village with Richmond and Kingston upon Thames. It has only a few bus stops such as Sandy Lane, Sudbrook Lane (The Russell School) and Ham Street and The Dysart.

==Education==

* Deutsche Schule (DSL), London (the German School London), is based at Douglas House.
* The Russell School, now on Petersham Road, was founded in 1851 by Lord John Russell, who served twice as Britain&#x27;s Prime Minister. It was originally located in Richmond Park, near Petersham Gate, but the building was irreparably damaged by a bomb in 1943 and demolished.
* Sudbrook School is a nursery school housed in Petersham&#x27;s village hall on Bute Avenue.

==Religious sites==

===St Peter&#x27;s Church===

Petersham Parish Church is believed to pre-date the Norman conquest of England, as a church at Petersham is mentioned in Domesday Book (1086).

===All Saints&#x27; Church===

All Saints&#x27;, on Bute Avenue, was built as a church but was never consecrated. It was built between 1899 and 1909 by Leeds architect John Kelly for Mrs Rachael Warde (née Walker) (1841–1906) as a memorial to her father Samuel Walker and her aunt Ellen Walker. During World War II it was used as an Anti-Aircraft Command post and it has also been used as a recording studio and as a filming location. It is now a private residence.

==Sport==
Richmond Golf Club, a private golf club, is situated in the historic Sudbrook Park, adjacent to Richmond Park. The Grade I listed building Sudbrook House, in the park, has been its clubhouse since 1898. 

Ham and Petersham Cricket Club, whose home matches are played in Ham, was established in 1815.

Ranelagh Harriers running club is based behind The Dysart restaurant.

<doc id="94232" wikidata="Q123296" url="?curid=94232" title="Petts Wood">
<text>Petts Wood is a town in south-east London, England, previously located in the historic county of Kent. It lies south of Chislehurst, west of St Paul&#x27;s Cray and Poverest, north of Orpington and Crofton, and east of Southborough and Bromley Common. The area forms part of the London Borough of Bromley local authority district in the ceremonial county of Greater London.

==History==
The name appeared first in 1577 as &quot;the wood of the Pett family&quot;, who were shipbuilders and leased the wood as a source of timber. (A pub, The Sovereign of the Seas, is named after a ship built at Woolwich to a design by Phineas Pett.)

The area remained rural right up until the late 19th century; in 1872 just one house (&#x27;Ladywood&#x27;) stood here. Most of the modern suburb of Petts Wood was built in the late 1920s by the Harlow-based developer Basil Scruby together with architect Leonard Culliford who designed the layout of the roads. A number of individual builders developed individual plots, amongst others the master builder, Noel Rees, as well as Walter Reed and George Hoad. Scruby also paid the Southern Railway Company £6,000 to build Petts Wood railway station to serve the new suburb. Shops and a cinema were also built adjacent to the railway.
The generally higher quality of large homes built to the east of the railway line, as compared to smaller and more densely packed development to the west, was due to the fact that Scruby&#x27;s increasing financial difficulties meant he had little control over its developers, Morrell&#x27;s and New Ideal Homesteads.

The area between Petts Wood and Bickley sustained heavy bombing during the Second World War because of its proximity to an important railway junction. Three bombs landed on the town centre itself.

The Jubilee Country Park is to the northwest of the main shopping area. Before this park was created in 1977 the area was known as &#x27;The Gun Sites&#x27;, as it had been the location for anti-aircraft guns in the Second World War, and was the home of the 1st Petts Wood scout group.

According to Keith Waterhouse in his book &quot;Streets Ahead&quot;, Petts Wood was popular with Fleet Street newspaper staff in the 1950s: &quot;… this Kent suburb, recommended in Fleet Street for the all-night train service it afforded sub-editors and reporters coming off late duty, thus giving them a round-the-clock, heaven-sent excuse for one more for the road.&quot;

In 2009, the local Woolworths store gained media attention when its manager, realising his was the last of the chain to close, gathered the remains of the pick and mix section and auctioned the bag of sweets for £14,500.

==The woods==
The eponymous wood itself survives and is managed by the National Trust. Originally just 88 acres (36 hectares) were bought by public subscription and donated to the Trust in 1927, after it became clear that the area would be developed for housing. This asset expanded when the neighbouring Hawkwood Estate and Edlmann Wood, comprising a further 250 acres (100 hectares), were donated to the Trust by landowners Robert and Francesca Hall in 1957. The woodland features oak, birch, rowan, alder, ash, hornbeam and sweet chestnut.

<text>Pinner is a suburb in the London Borough of Harrow, northwest London, England, northwest of Charing Cross, close to the border with Hillingdon, historically in the county of Middlesex. The population was 38,698 in 2021.

Originally a mediaeval hamlet, the St John Baptist church dates from the 14th century and other parts of the historic village include Tudor buildings. The newer High Street is mainly 18th-century buildings, while Bridge Street has a more urban character and many chain stores.

==History==

Pinner was originally a hamlet, first recorded in 1231 as &quot;Pinnora&quot;, although the already archaic &quot;-ora&quot; (meaning &#x27;hill&#x27;) suggests its origins lie no later than circa 900. The name &quot;Pinn&quot; is shared with the River Pinn, which runs through the middle of Pinner. Another suggestion of the name is that it means &#x27;hill-slope shaped like a pin&#x27;.

The oldest part of the town lies around the fourteenth-century parish church of St. John the Baptist, at the junction of the present day Grange Gardens, High Street and Church Lane. The church was originally a chapel of ease to St Mary&#x27;s Church, Harrow on the Hill, and was first mentioned in 1234. It was rebuilt in the early fourteenth-century, and rededicated in 1321. The parish became independent of St Mary&#x27;s in 1766, when the first perpetual curate was appointed; not until the Wilberforce Act of 1868 did it appoint its first vicar, one William Hind. The earliest surviving private dwelling, East End Farm Cottage, dates from the late fifteenth century.

The village expanded rapidly between 1923 and 1939 when a series of garden estates, including the architecturally significant Pinnerwood estate conservation area – encouraged by the Metropolitan Railway – grew around its historic core. It was largely from this time onwards that the area (including Hatch End, which forms the northeastern part of Pinner) assumed much of its present-day suburban character. The area is now contiguous with neighbouring suburban districts including Rayners Lane and Eastcote.

Pinner contains a large number of homes built in the 1930s Art Deco style, the most grand of which is the Grade II listed Elm Park Court at the junction of West End Lane and Elm Park Road. Pinner is also the site of one of the UK&#x27;s oldest chartered fairs, called Pinner Fair, which has been held annually since 1336.

Pinner lay within the historic county of Middlesex; it was located at the western end of the hundred of Gore, before it was in the Hendon Rural District. In 1965 it became a part of the London Borough of Harrow in the newly formed ceremonial county of Greater London.

===Parish church===
Pinner&#x27;s St John the Baptist parish church was consecrated in 1321, but built on the site of an earlier Christian place of worship. The west tower and south porch date from the 15th century.

==Governance==
Harrow Council has been governed by the Conservative Party since 2022. Pinner has two wards, Pinner and Pinner South, each represented by three Conservative councillors.
Pinner is in the Brent and Harrow constituency for the London Assembly which has been represented since 2024 by Krupesh Hirani (Labour). Since the 2010 general election, Pinner has been part of the Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner parliamentary constituency, currently served by David Simmonds.

==Geography==

Pinner includes Pinner Village at its centre, along with the localities of Pinner Green and Pinnerwood Park Conservation Area to the north. To the north east is the larger area of Hatch End, served by Hatch End railway station (originally opened as &quot;Pinner&quot;).

The River Pinn flows through Pinner, flowing in a diagonal direction. Large parks and open spaces are Pinner Memorial Park, Pinner Village Gardens, Roxbourne Gardens, Pinner Wood (woodlands) and Pinner Park (farmland).

Pinner Memorial Park has a large house in it which includes a museum to Illustrator Heath Robinson as well as a cafe which hosts regular music events throughout the summer; while Roxbourne Gardens also hosts a pop-up cafe and music venue on Sundays year-round.

Much of Pinner has an elevation of about to . Nower Hill rises to a peak of about above sea level while Pinner Park peaks at . The semi-rural Pinnerwood area is steep, and rises to a peak of over around Pinner Hill Golf Course.

== Demography ==

Pinner is both a religiously and culturally mixed area, with the ethnic minority population having grown significantly since the 1970s. Pinner ward nonetheless had the highest concentration of people describing themselves as white in the London Borough of Harrow, at 72 per cent of the population in 2011. In 2013 the Pinner South ward had the next highest proportion of white people in the borough at 69.4 per cent. Various churches, a synagogue and others serve the religious needs of the community.

Pinner also has several independent schools and single-sex schools. In the 2014/15 period, the Pinner South ward had a crime rate of 24.5, which was the lowest out of all 628 wards of Greater London. The ward also has (data from 2009 to 2013) the second highest female life expectancy in the capital: 91.7 years, only bettered by Holland ward in Kensington and Chelsea.

To keep the annual tradition going, a small selection of non-operational rides were put up in 2020, and the Vicar came out to bless the showmen.
* Pinner Donkey Derby and Fete, held between 1925 and 1939 was a Charity event organised by Rev. John Caulfield, parish priest of St. Luke&#x27;s, Pinner and Steve Donoghue, a leading flat-race jockey. Huge crowds would turn up to see the Derby, as it was also a chance to see celebrities and sporting personalities of the era.

That elastic old person of Pinner.

<text>Long Beach is a coastal city in southeastern Los Angeles County, California, United States. It is the 44th-most populous city in the United States, with a population of 451,307 as of 2022. A charter city, Long Beach is the 7th-most populous city in California, the 2nd-most populous city in Los Angeles County, and the largest city in California that is not a county seat.

Incorporated in 1897, Long Beach lies in Southern California, in the southern part of Los Angeles County. Long Beach is approximately south of downtown Los Angeles, and is part of the Gateway Cities region. The Port of Long Beach is the second busiest container port in the United States and is among the world&#x27;s largest shipping ports. The city is over an oilfield with minor wells both directly beneath the city as well as offshore.

The city is known for its waterfront attractions, including the permanently docked and the Aquarium of the Pacific. Long Beach also hosts the Grand Prix of Long Beach, an IndyCar race and the Long Beach Pride Festival and Parade. California State University, Long Beach, one of the largest universities in California by enrollment, is within the city.

==History==
===Tongva period===

Indigenous people have lived in coastal Southern California for over 10,000 years, and several successive cultures have inhabited the present-day area of Long Beach. By the 16th-century arrival of Spanish explorers, the dominant group was the Tongva, who had established at least three major settlements within the present-day city. &quot;Tevaaxa&#x27;anga&quot; was an inland settlement near the Los Angeles River, while &quot;Ahwaanga&quot; and &quot;Povuu&#x27;nga&quot; were coastal villages. Povuu&#x27;nga was particularly important to the Tongva, not only as a regional trading center and hub for fishermen, but for its deep ceremonial significance, being understood as their place of emergence as a people from which their lives began.

===Spanish and Mexican period===
In 1784, the Spanish Empire&#x27;s King Carlos III granted Rancho Los Nietos to Spanish soldier Manuel Nieto. The Rancho Los Cerritos and Rancho Los Alamitos were divided from this territory. The boundary between the two ranchos ran through the center of Signal Hill on a southwest to northeast diagonal. A portion of western Long Beach was originally part of the Rancho San Pedro. Its boundaries were in dispute for years, due to flooding changing the Los Angeles River boundary between Rancho San Pedro and Rancho Los Nietos.

By 1805, what had been the major Tongva village of Puvunga was thoroughly depleted of villagers, most of whom were brought to Mission San Gabriel for conversion and as a labor force. Many villagers died at the mission, which had a high rate of death, particularly among children, attributed to many factors like diseases that spread quickly in the close quarters of the mission&#x27;s walls, as well as torture, malnourishment, and overworking.

In 1843, Juan Temple bought Rancho Los Cerritos, having arrived in California in 1827 from New England. He built what is now known as the &quot;Los Cerritos Ranch House&quot;, a still-standing adobe which is a National Historic Landmark. Temple created a thriving cattle ranch and prospered, becoming the wealthiest man in Los Angeles County. Both Temple and his ranch house played important local roles in the Mexican–American War. On an island in the San Pedro Bay, Mormon pioneers made an abortive attempt to establish a colony (as part of Brigham Young&#x27;s plan to establish a continuous chain of settlements from the Pacific to Salt Lake).

===Post-Conquest period===

Following the U.S. Conquest of California, Temple had his Rancho Los Cerritos deeded to him by the Public Land Commission. In 1866, Temple sold Rancho Los Cerritos for $20,000 to the Northern California sheep-raising firm of Flint, Bixby &amp; Company, which consisted of brothers Thomas and Benjamin Flint and their cousin Llewellyn Bixby. Two years previous Flint, Bixby &amp; Co had also purchased along with Northern California associate James Irvine, three ranchos which would later become the city that bears Irvine&#x27;s name. To manage Rancho Los Cerritos, the company selected Llewellyn&#x27;s brother Jotham Bixby, the &quot;Father of Long Beach&quot;. Three years later, Bixby bought into the property and would later form the Bixby Land Company. In the 1870s, as many as 30,000 sheep were kept at the ranch and sheared twice yearly to provide wool for trade. In 1880, Bixby sold of the Rancho Los Cerritos to William E. Willmore, who subdivided it in hopes of creating a farm community, Willmore City. He failed and was bought out by a Los Angeles syndicate that called itself the &quot;Long Beach Land and Water Company&quot;. They changed the name of the community to Long Beach at that time.

===Incorporation===
The City of Long Beach was officially incorporated in 1897. The town grew as a seaside resort with light agricultural uses. The Pike was the most famous beachside amusement zone on the West Coast from 1902 until 1969; it offered bathers food, games and rides, such at the &quot;Sky Wheel&quot; dual Ferris wheel and &quot;Cyclone Racer&quot; roller coaster. Gradually the oil industry, Navy shipyard and facilities and port became the mainstays of the city. In the 1950s it was referred to as &quot;Iowa by the sea&quot;, due to a large influx of people from that and other Midwestern states. Huge picnics for migrants from each state were a popular annual event in Long Beach until the 1960s.
Another Bixby cousin, John W. Bixby, was influential in the city. After first working for his cousins at Los Cerritos, J.W. Bixby leased land at Rancho Los Alamitos. He put together a group: banker I.W. Hellman, Llewellyn and Jotham Bixby, and him, to purchase the rancho. In addition to bringing innovative farming methods to the Alamitos (which under Abel Stearns in the late 1850s and early 1860s was once the largest cattle ranch in the US), J.W. Bixby began the development of the oceanfront property near the city&#x27;s picturesque bluffs. Under the name Alamitos Land Company, J.W. Bixby named the streets and laid out the parks of his new city. This area would include Belmont Heights, Belmont Shore and Naples; it soon became a thriving community of its own. J.W. Bixby died in 1888 of apparent appendicitis. The Rancho Los Alamitos property was split up, with Hellman getting the southern third, Jotham and Llewellyn, the northern third, and J.W. Bixby&#x27;s widow and heirs keeping the central third. The Alamitos townsite was kept as a separate entity, but at first, it was primarily run by Llewellyn and Jotham Bixby, although I.W, Hellman (who had the largest single share) had a significant veto power, an influence made even stronger as the J.W. Bixby heirs began to side with Hellman more and more.

When Jotham Bixby died in 1916, the remaining of Rancho Los Cerritos was subdivided into the neighborhoods of Bixby Knolls, California Heights, Los Cerritos, North Long Beach and part of the city of Signal Hill.

Pine Avenue near 4th became the center of a large shopping district. Besides upscale Buffums (1912; expanded 1926), in 1929 alone Barker Brothers, the Hugh A. Marti Co., and Wise Company and Famous department stores built large new stores, Walker&#x27;s (1933), and nearby at American and 5th, Sears (1928) and Montgomery Ward (1929). It would remain popular until suburban malls sprung up starting in the 1950s. (see also: History of Retail in Southern California)

Oil was discovered in 1921 on Signal Hill, which split off as a separately incorporated city shortly afterward. The discovery of the Long Beach Oil Field, brought in by the gusher at the Alamitos oil well#1, made Long Beach a major oil producer; in the 1920s the field was the most productive in the world. In 1932, the even larger Wilmington Oil Field, fourth-largest in the United States, and which is mostly in Long Beach, was developed, contributing to the city&#x27;s fame in the 1930s as an oil town.

The M6.4 1933 Long Beach earthquake caused significant damage to the city and surrounding areas, killing a total of 120 people. Most of the damage occurred in unreinforced masonry buildings, especially schools. Pacific Bible Seminary (now known as Hope International University) was forced to move classes out of First Christian Church of Long Beach and into a small local home due to damage.

The Ford Motor Company built a factory called Long Beach Assembly at the then address in 1929 as &quot;700 Henry Ford Avenue, Long Beach&quot; where the factory began building the Ford Model A. Production of Ford vehicles continued after the war until 1960, when the plant was closed due to a fire, and January 1991 when the factory was demolished partially due to air quality remediation efforts. Ford had earlier opened a factory in Los Angeles at 12th Street and Olive, with a later factory built at East Seventh Street and Santa Fe Avenue after 1914.

Come 1938, the creation of Housing Authorities for both the City and County of Los Angeles were complete — and North Long Beach was to be home to the County Authority&#x27;s first order of business: the Carmelitos Housing Project, Southern California&#x27;s first affordable housing complex.

===World War II and contemporary history===
Long Beach, as a port city, had a relationship with the U.S. Navy even before the war. The city was part of the Battle of Los Angeles during World War II when observers for the United States Army Air Forces reported shells being fired from the sea. Anti-aircraft batteries fired into the night sky, although no planes were ever sighted.

Long Beach&#x27;s population grew substantially during and after the war, with workers being needed for wartime manufacturing and G.I. bill recipients seeking out homes in California. Suburbs were built by the Bixby land companies and others.

Douglas Aircraft Company&#x27;s largest facility was its Long Beach plant, totaling . The first plane rolled out the door on December 23, 1941. The plant produced C-47 Skytrain transports, B-17 Flying Fortress bombers, and A-20 Havoc attack bombers simultaneously. Douglas merged with the McDonnell Aircraft Company in 1967 where the Douglas DC-8 and the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 were built. In 1997 McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing, which made C-17 Globemaster transport planes in Long Beach until the closure of the manufacturing facility in 2015.

Long Beach also saw an instance of the Chicano(a) movement in 1968.

==Geography==

Long Beach is about south of downtown Los Angeles. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (36.8%) is water. Long Beach completely surrounds the city of Signal Hill.

===Climate===

Long Beach has a climate that can either be described as a hot semi-arid climate or a hot-summer Mediterranean climate. In general, the city features hot summers and mild to warm winters with occasional rainfall. Days in Long Beach are mostly sunny, as in Southern California in general. Temperatures recorded at the weather station at the Long Beach Airport, inland from the ocean, range more greatly than those along the immediate coast. During the summer months, low clouds and fog occur frequently, developing overnight and blanketing the area on many mornings. This fog usually clears by the afternoon, and a westerly sea breeze often develops, keeping temperatures mild. Heat and high humidity can sometimes coincide in summer, which may cause discomfort due to the heat index.

According to data analysis provided by the NWS, The annual average temperature of Long Beach is , of which August is the hottest month with an average temperature of , while December is the coldest month with an average temperature of . In terms of temperature, Long Beach and other California cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco have the hottest month of the year usually in August and the coolest month in December. Long Beach has 23 days of afternoon temperatures above each year, and about two days a year are above .
Long Beach&#x27;s location directly east of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, paired with its south facing coastline, results in the city sometimes experiencing different weather patterns than the Los Angeles metropolitan area coastal communities to the northwest and southeast of Long Beach, which largely have west facing coastlines. The 1200 ft Palos Verdes hills block west to east airflow and a significant amount of the coastal moisture that marks other coastal cities, such as Manhattan Beach, Santa Monica, and Newport Beach.

As in most locations in Southern California, most rainfall in Long Beach occurs during the winter months. Storms can bring heavy rainfall. The annual precipitation in Long Beach is , of which the precipitation from December to March of the following year accounts for 81% of the whole year. June to September is usually rainless, especially August.

===Neighborhoods===

 Long Beach is composed of many different neighborhoods. Some neighborhoods are named after thoroughfares, while others are named for nearby parks, schools, or city features.

===Environment===
====Pollution====

Long Beach suffers from some of the worst air pollution in the entire United States. Most of the city is in proximity to the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, and the prevailing westerly-to-west-south-westerly winds bring a large portion of the twin ports&#x27; air pollution directly into Long Beach before dispersing it northward then eastward. Heavy pollution sources at the ports include the ships themselves, which burn high-sulfur, high-soot-producing bunker fuel to maintain internal electrical power while docked, as well as heavy diesel pollution from drayage trucks at the ports, and short-haul tractor-trailer trucks ferrying cargo from the ports to inland warehousing, rail yards, and shipping centers. Long-term average levels of toxic air pollutants (and the corresponding carcinogenic risk they create) can be two to three times higher in and around Long Beach, and in downwind areas to the east, than in other parts of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, such as the Westside, San Fernando Valley, or San Gabriel Valley. While overall regional pollution in the Los Angeles metropolitan area has declined in the last decade, pollution levels remain dangerously high in much of Long Beach due to the port pollution, with diesel exhaust from ships, trains, and trucks as the largest sources.Additionally, Long Beach is directly downwind of several of the South Bay oil refineries. Any refinery process or chemical upset that results in the atmospheric release of refinery by-products (commonly sulfur dioxide) will usually impact air quality in Long Beach due to the west-south-westerly prevailing wind.

Similarly, the water quality in the Long Beach portion of San Pedro Bay, which is enclosed by the Federal Breakwater, commonly ranks among the poorest on the entire West Coast during rainy periods. Long Beach beaches average a D or F grade on beach water quality during rainy periods in the &quot;Beach Report Card&quot; published by Heal the Bay. However, during dry periods the water may have an A or B rating in the same reports. The Los Angeles River discharges directly into the Long Beach side of San Pedro Bay, meaning a large portion of all the urban runoff from the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area pours directly into the harbor water. This runoff contains most of the debris, garbage, chemical pollutants, and biological pathogens washed into storm drains in every upstream city each time it rains. Because the breakwater prevents tidal flushing and wave action, these pollutants build up in the harbor. The water enclosed by the breakwater, along most of the city&#x27;s beaches, can be subject to red tides due to this stagnation as well. Because of these factors, the water in Long Beach is sometimes unsafe for swimming, up to weeks each year.

====Ecology====

The area has historically included several ecological communities, with coastal scrub dominating.

==Demographics==
The top five countries of origin for Long Beach&#x27;s immigrants are Mexico, the Philippines, Cambodia, El Salvador and Vietnam. The most common foreign languages spoken in Long Beach are Spanish, Khmer and Tagalog. There is a Mexican American/Chicano community in Long Beach. Cambodian people and Filipino Americans also settled in Long Beach. There is a Buddhist community in Long Beach. Christianity is the most common religion.

The city has changed since the 1950s, when its population was predominantly European-American and the city was nicknamed &quot;Iowa by the Sea&quot; or &quot;Iowa under Palm Trees&quot; as it had a slower pace than neighboring Los Angeles. In 1950, whites represented 97.4% of Long Beach&#x27;s population. Since the second half of the 20th century, the city has been a major port of entry for Asian and Latin American immigrants headed to Los Angeles. The Harbor section of downtown Long Beach was once home to people of Dutch, Greek, Italian, Maltese, Portuguese and Spanish ancestry, most of them employed in manufacturing and fish canneries until the 1960s.

According to a report by &quot;USA Today&quot; in 2000, Long Beach is the most ethnically diverse large city in the United States. It has a relatively high proportion of Pacific Islanders (over 1% as of the 2000 Census), from Samoa and Tonga. Most American Indians, about 0.8% of the city&#x27;s population, arrived during the Department of the Interior&#x27;s Bureau of Indian Affairs urban relocation programs in the 1950s.

Long Beach once had a sizable Japanese American population, which largely worked in the fish canneries on Terminal Island and on small truck farms in the area. In 1942, not long after the Attack on Pearl Harbor and subsequent Japanese declaration of war on the United States and the British Empire, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued United States Executive Order 9066 which allowed military commanders to designate areas &quot;from which any or all persons may be excluded&quot;. Under this order, all Japanese and Americans of Japanese ancestry were categorically removed from Western coastal regions and sent to internment camps, without regard for due process.
24,000 Jews live in Long Beach. Jews are concentrated in Rossmor, Los Alamitos, Seal Beach, and Lakewood in the Greater Long Beach area.

===Homelessness===

In 2022, the Long Beach&#x27;s point-in-time Homeless Count counted 3,296 homeless individuals in the city.

==Economy==

The economic base has changed over the years. Oil extraction created a boom and continues to fund portions of the city budget. Long Beach was a Navy town for many years before the base closed. The aerospace industry played an important role. Douglas Aircraft Company (later McDonnell Douglas and now part of Boeing) had plants at the Long Beach Airport where they built aircraft for World War II, and later built DC-8s, DC-9s, DC-10s, and MD-11s. Boeing built the Boeing 717 until 2006 and the C-17 Globemaster III strategic airlifter until 2015, the plants were leased by Mercedes-Benz and Relativity Space. Even after greatly reducing the number of local employees in recent years, Boeing is still the largest private employer in the city. Polar Air Cargo, an international cargo airline, was formerly based in Long Beach. TABC, Inc., a part of Toyota, makes a variety of car parts, including steering columns and catalytic converters, in Long Beach.

Epson America, Inc. the U.S. affiliate of Japan-based Seiko Epson Corporation, is headquartered in Long Beach. Pioneer Electronics, the U.S. affiliate of Japan-based Pioneer Corporation, is also headquartered in Long Beach along with SCAN Health Plan, a non-profit &quot;Medicare Advantage&quot; HMO for seniors. Molina Healthcare, Inc., a Medicaid management healthcare program, is headquartered in Long Beach. The real estate company HCP is based in Long Beach. Jesse James&#x27; West Coast Choppers custom motorcycle shop was in Long Beach, and much of the &quot;Monster Garage&quot; cable TV show was shot in Long Beach.

The North American subsidiary of video game developer and publisher Spike Chunsoft is headquartered in a building adjacent to the Long Beach Airport.

The Long Beach Accelerator was founded in 2019 as a public-private partnership between the city of Long Beach, Sunstone Management, and California State University, Long Beach, with the aim of growing the presence of diverse technology entrepreneurs in the city.

===Top employers===

Trade valued annually at more than $140 billion moves through Long Beach, making it the second busiest seaport in the United States. The Port supports more than 30,000 jobs in Long Beach, 316,000 jobs throughout Southern California and 1.4 million jobs throughout the United States. It generates about $16 billion in annual trade-related wages statewide.

===Retail===
Los Altos Center is the only mall anchored by major department stores within city limits, while Lakewood Center mall is adjacent to Long Beach. Until the 1950s, Long Beach was the major retail hub between Los Angeles and Santa Ana. Buffum&#x27;s, Walker&#x27;s and Robert&#x27;s all had their flagship stores in the city. Later the Long Beach Plaza and Marina Pacifica malls were built, since repurposed as retail power centers. The largest shopping center within the city is the Long Beach Towne Center, a power center opened in 1999 on the site of the Long Beach Naval Hospital. The Pike Outlets and 2nd &amp; PCH are new retail centers.

==Arts and culture==

===Art===

The Long Beach Museum of Art, sited in the historic Elizabeth Milbank Anderson residence, is owned by the City of Long Beach, and operated by the Long Beach Museum of Art Foundation. Long Beach also features the Museum of Latin American Art (MOLAA), founded in 1996 by Dr. Robert Gumbiner. It is the only museum in the western United States that exclusively features modern and contemporary Latin American art.

==Media==
===Print===
Long Beach&#x27;s daily newspaper is the &quot;Long Beach Press-Telegram&quot;, which is distributed throughout most of the Gateway Cities and South Bay areas of southwest Los Angeles County. The &quot;Press-Telegram&quot; is owned by Digital First Media and is part of the Los Angeles Newspaper Group, which has several newspapers in the Southern California area which share resources and reporters.

On September 30, 1933, the &quot;Press-Telegram&quot; published what David Dayen called &quot;One of the more influential letters to the editor in American history&quot;: Francis Townsend&#x27;s letter outlining the Townsend Plan, a proposal that sparked a national campaign which influenced the establishment of the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s Social Security system.

California State University, Long Beach also has a student newspaper published four times a week during the fall and spring semesters, the &quot;Daily Forty-Niner&quot;.

The Gazette newspapers called &quot;The Grunion Gazette&quot;, &quot;The Downtown Gazette&quot;, and &quot;The Uptown Gazette&quot; are free, weekly newspapers that focus on various parts of the city. The Gazettes were sold to MediaNews (now Digital First Media), owner of the &quot;Press-Telegram&quot;, in 2004.

&quot;Palacio Magazine&quot; (formerly &quot;Palacio de Long Beach&quot;) is a free quarterly, bilingual magazine which runs stories focusing on community, education, art, health and wellness side by side in English and Spanish.

Although not based in Long Beach, the alternative weeklies &quot;OC Weekly&quot; and &quot;LA Weekly&quot; are distributed widely in Long Beach. Starting in 2007, Long Beach was served by its own &quot;The District Weekly&quot;, an alternative weekly that covered news, the arts, restaurants, and the local music scene. The District Weekly ceased publication in March 2010, citing lack of advertiser support.

In 2013 Freedom Communications, owner of the &quot;Orange County Register&quot;, launched a five-day daily newspaper, the &quot;Long Beach Register&quot;, aimed at competing with the &quot;Press-Telegram&quot;. In September 2014, the &quot;Long Beach Register&quot; was reduced to Sundays only, and was distributed as an insert in the &quot;Orange County Register&quot;. In August of the same year, just sixteen months after its much-publicized launch, Freedom Communications announced it would cease publication of the &quot;Long Beach Register&quot; completely, citing lack of reader and advertiser interest.

===Radio===
Long Beach is part of the Los Angeles DMA radio and television markets. Although a few radio stations have had studios in Long Beach over the years, including the 1980s alternative music and later hard rock station KNAC, the only remaining radio stations in Long Beach are the jazz and blues station KKJZ on the Cal State Long Beach campus, and the Christian radio broadcaster KFRN. The most recent radio station to grace the Long Beach airways is public radio station KLBP, 99.1, a low-power station, which started broadcasting in December 2018.

===Online===
Long Beach has a number of online news outlets, including the Long Beach Post, Long Beach Local News, The Modern Times of Long Beach, FORTHE, and LBReport.com.

==In popular culture==

Balboa Amusement Producing Company, also known as Balboa Studios, was at Sixth Street and Alamitos Avenue; they used on Signal Hill for outdoor locations. Silent film stars who lived in Long Beach included Fatty Arbuckle and Theda Bara. The 1917 film &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, starring Theda Bara, was shot at the Dominguez Slough just west of Long Beach, and Moses parted the Red Sea for Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s 1923 version of &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; on the flat seashore of Seal Beach, southeast of Long Beach. Long Beach was the famous location of Paramount newsreel footage of the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, out-takes from the W.C. Fields 1933 featurette &quot;International House&quot; was possibly the first earthquake to be captured in action on film.

Because of its proximity to LA-area studios and its variety of locations, today Long Beach is regularly used for movies, television shows, and advertisements. The city has filled in for locations across the nation and around the globe. One advantage for Long Beach is that the video and film industry uses a zone that extends from Beverly Blvd. and La Cienega Blvd. in the West Hollywood area. It is cheaper to shoot within that zone, so Long Beach and other South Bay cities often stand in for areas of Orange County (such as for &quot;The O.C.&quot; TV show) because almost all of Orange County is outside of the zone.

One of the most famous Long Beach film locations is the home of Ferris Bueller in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. Though the film was set in the North Shore suburbs of Chicago the house is at 4160 Country Club Dr.

Long Beach Polytechnic High School has played host to numerous films, featuring its outdoor grounds in movies such as &quot;Coach Carter&quot;, among others. Robert A. Millikan High School has also lent its classrooms and hallways to films such as &quot;American Pie&quot;, among others. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo High School has been a very popular place to shoot movies as well, with 2–4 films shot per year, and is being used to shoot 20th Century Fox&#x27;s musical comedy-drama, &quot;Glee&quot;. St. Anthony High School&#x27;s, Jack Errion Memorial Gymnasium has also been featured in a few movies and television shows, including &quot;Sunset Park&quot;, &quot;American Wedding&quot;, &quot;Coach Carter&quot; and &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot;. Long Beach Woodrow Wilson High School was used to shoot &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel&quot; and has been used for commercials for Nike and Adidas, particularly one with Los Angeles Sparks basketball star Candace Parker. The film &quot;Freedom Writers&quot;, although not shot there, was based on Long Beach Woodrow Wilson High School.

Other locations in Long Beach have been used frequently as well. An episode of &quot;The Lone Wolf&quot;, &quot;The Long Beach Story&quot;, features the Wilton Hotel. Shoreline Drive visually approximates a freeway but is a municipal roadway and permits are accepted for its closure for shooting video and film – it has become a frequent movie and television freeway stand-in. Many car chase and crash scenes have been shot on stretches of road near the Long Beach harbor and along the city&#x27;s Shoreline Drive. Among these are the 1963 movie &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; and numerous episodes of the 1970s TV drama &quot;CHiPs&quot; (as well as the 2017 film &quot;CHiPs&quot;). Long Beach&#x27;s downtown neighborhood has stood in for various urban areas in a variety of movies. &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds (1974 film)&quot;, &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)&quot;, and &quot;Speed&quot; were shot in Long Beach. &quot;&quot; was also shot in Long Beach as was &quot;Big Momma&#x27;s House 2&quot;. &quot;&quot;, &quot;Dexter&quot;, and &quot;Jane the Virgin&quot;, although set in Miami, Florida, regularly get shot in Long Beach. Much of &quot;Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny&quot; was shot in Long Beach. Although there was a chase scene downtown, most of Tenacious D was shot at Alex&#x27;s Bar at 2913 E. Anaheim St., a punk rock/alternative rock venue. Most of the viral hit &quot;Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus&quot; was also shot by the Belmont Veterans Memorial Pier and Alamitos Energy Center in Long Beach.
The Long Beach Terrace Theatre has also been used for various commercials, an episode of &quot;Glee&quot;, as well as the film &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;. Several scenes from this David Spade comedy, &quot;Lost &amp; Found&quot;, were shot around the Belmont Park area. The final scene from the Jim Carrey comedy remake &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; features Long Beach&#x27;s scenic E. Ocean Blvd. route. &quot;La La Land&quot; features both a Long Beach apartment house and bar.

The Long Beach Naval Station and Naval Shipyard were featured in episodes of &quot;Visiting... with Huell Howser&quot;. The Pike and SoundWalk art show have also been featured.

The city was used as a filming location for the MSNBC reality television series &quot;To Catch a Predator&quot;.

<text>Plumstead is an area in southeast London, within the Royal Borough of Greenwich, England. It is located east of Woolwich.

==History==

Plumstead has been settled since ancient times, and London&#x27;s earliest timber structure has been found here. During the excavation of a peat bog near Belmarsh Prison in 2009, an ancient timber trackway, radiocarbon dated to be nearly 6,000 years old, was discovered by archaeologists.

In 960 King Edgar gave four plough lands, collectively called Plumstead, to a monastery - St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey near Canterbury, Kent. These were subsequently taken from the monastery by Earl Godwin for his fourth son, Tostig.

King Edward the Confessor restored them again to the monastery on taking power, however Tostig saw the opportunity to take possession of them once again after Edward&#x27;s death in 1066 when King Harold seized his brother&#x27;s estates.

After the Battle of Hastings in 1066, William the Conqueror gifted Plumstead to his half-brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, whom he also titled Earl of Kent. The Archbishop of Canterbury Lanfranc of Pavia and the Norman abbot of St Austin&#x27;s successfully interceded to reclaim a portion of the land on behalf of the monastery. In 1074 Odo then granted by deed the remainder of the parish and also the right of the abbot to be &quot;Chief Lord of the Fee&quot;.

However, the Domesday Book of 1086 holds the details of Plumstead as two separate entries. Under the title of the land of the church of St. Augustine it reads 
while under the general title of the Bishop of Bayeux&#x27;s lands

Around this time Reginald, son of Gervase de Cornhill, released to the abbot and convent all claims in this manor from David and Robert de Cornhill who had rented it from them.

By 1273 Nicholas de Spina was elected abbot of the monastery and by the following year he was receiving eleven pounds from Plumstead residents.

Lora de Ros, lady of Horton, gave her right to two carucates of land and of woods in Plumstead to the abbot, Thomas, in return for the rights of her and her heirs to partake of prayers performed in the church during 1287. It appears that Robert, the last abbot but one, had recovered a share of this land from her ancestor, Richard de Ros. It was found by a jury of grand assizes that his ancestors held this land in tenancy from the abbot and convent at a rent of twelve pound per annum.

In 1314, during the reign of Edward II of England, the abbot was summoned before Hervey de Stanton, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He was asked to show by what right he claimed sundry liberties and free warren on the manor of Plumstead amongst others. Other questions included the right for a weekly market in Plumstead on a Wednesday and a fair yearly for three days &quot;on the Eve day, and morrow of St. Nicholas&quot;.

For reasons that remain unclear, King Edward III exempted the men and tenants of the manor of Plumstead from providing four men from the borough for the sheriff as was the requirement elsewhere. A writ to Roger de Reynham, Sheriff of Kent, in 1332 directed and commanded him that the residents of Plumstead should be allowed to send one man only. By 1363 Edward also decreed to the monastery in his charter of infpeximus that he released all manors and possessions given to it by former kings, including William the Conqueror. He also confirmed all the grants of liberties previously bestowed on the abbot and monastery.

By the time of Richard II of England the taxes from Plumstead were valued at 69 pounds, 10 shillings and sixpence, and Henry VI of England reconfirmed the liberties and rights of the monastery.

Plumstead manor, together with the church of Plumstead and the chapel of Wickham annexed to it, remained part of the possessions of the monastery until its final dissolution in 1539, the 30th year of the reign of Henry VIII, when the abbey and all its revenues were surrendered into the King&#x27;s hands by the then abbot, John Essex, and its thirty members.
Plumstead expanded rapidly in the 1880s with housing developed for workers at the Royal Arsenal; two-up two-down terraced housing was common in the area close to the river and the Arsenal, whereas larger and smarter properties were developed uphill from the Thames, around Plumstead Common. The Plumstead Common Act 1878 (41 &amp; 42 Vict. c. cxlv) protected Plumstead Common as public open space forever. In the late 19th century, Woolwich cemetery was developed in two phases (1856, 1855) on land formerly part of the southern edge of the Common.

Plumstead was also the home of the Peculiar People and an account of this Protestant sect is recorded in &#x27;Unorthodox London&#x27; by the journalist Charles Maurice Davies. The Plymouth Brethren have had numerous meeting rooms in the area since about 1845. The present Brethren meeting places are at Plum Lane (1865), Willenhall Road (ca 1910) and Brewery Road (Richmond Gospel Hall). Quakers met nearby in Woolwich from 1905, and in their own Meeting House from 1924.

Plumstead had rapid housing growth but still retained large areas of green land i.e. Winns Common, Plumstead Common, Shrewsbury Park and Rockcliffe Gardens. The urban sprawl of lower Plumstead adjacent to Woolwich was not initially matched by upper Plumstead.

==Education==

Plumstead Manor School is located in the area. The school was first established as Plumstead County School for Girls in 1913, and was later renamed Kings Warren Grammar School before becoming a comprehensive school in 1967. The school was a girls school until September 2018, after which it began accepting students of all genders.

There are a number of primary schools in Plumstead including St. Patricks RC Primary School, St. Margaret&#x27;s CofE Primary School, Gallions Mount Primary School, Timbercroft Primary School, Bannockburn Primary School, Plumcroft Primary School, Greenslade Primary School, South Rise Primary School, and Conway Primary School.

==Sport==
Arsenal Football Club (then known as Royal Arsenal or Woolwich Arsenal) played in Plumstead between 1886 and 1913, at various grounds in the Plumstead area, but mainly at the Manor Ground, on the north side of Plumstead Common Road and the Invicta Ground, where the Royal Ordnance Factories F.C. also played.

<text>Poplar is a district in East London, England and is in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It is an inner-city suburb located five miles (8 km) east of Charing Cross. It lies on the western bank of the River Lea and is part of the London Docklands.

Poplar is identified as a major district centre in the London Plan, with its district centre being Chrisp Street Market, a significant commercial and retail centre surrounded by extensive residential development.

Originally part of the Manor and Ancient Parish of Stepney, the &quot;Hamlet of Poplar&quot; had become an autonomous area of Stepney by the 17th century, and an independent parish in 1817. The Parish and later Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. After a series of mergers, Poplar became part of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in 1965.

==History==
===Origin and administrative history===

Poplar was formerly part of the Manor and Ancient Parish of Stepney, and was first recorded in either 1327 or 1350. It took its name from the Black Poplar trees which once flourished in the area. Black Poplar is a very rare and exceptionally large tree that grows well in the wet conditions which the Thames and Lea historically brought to much of the neighbourhood. A specimen persisted in the area until at least 1986 when the naturalist Oliver Rackham noted &quot;Nearby, in the midst of railway dereliction, a single Black Poplar even now struggles for life&quot;.

By the seventeenth century the area had become a &quot;Hamlet&quot;, a territorial sub-division of Stepney, with a degree of independence. The &quot;Hamlet of Poplar&quot; became an independent civil and ecclesiastical parish in 1817.

The area was part of the historic (or ancient) county of Middlesex, but military and most (or all) civil county functions were managed more locally, by the Tower Division (also known as the Tower Hamlets).

The role of the &quot;Tower Division&quot; ended when Poplar became part of the new County of London in 1889. The County of London was replaced by Greater London in 1965.

In 1855, Poplar joined with neighbouring Bromley and Bow to form the Poplar District of the Metropolis — though it remained an independent parish for some administrative purposes. The Poplar District (including Bromley and Bow) became the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar in 1900; population (1901), 168,822. In 1965 it merged with the Metropolitan Boroughs of Stepney and Bethnal Green to form the new London Borough of Tower Hamlets.

===Social and economic history===
In 1654, as the population of the district began to grow, the East India Company ceded a piece of land upon which to build a chapel and this became the nucleus of the settlement.
St Matthias Old Church is located on Poplar High Street, opposite Tower Hamlets College.

There was a major ship fitting industry from at least the 15th century, and the maritime trades became more important after the East and West India Docks were opened in 1806. Thames Ironworks at Leamouth Wharf was a major employer till its closure in 1912, its works team becoming known as West Ham United F.C. The docks attracted very heavy bombing to the area during the Blitz.

In 1921, the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar was the location of the Poplar Rates Rebellion, led by then-Mayor George Lansbury, who was later elected as leader of the Labour Party. As part of the 1951 Festival of Britain, a new council housing estate was built to the north of the East India Dock Road and named the Lansbury Estate after him. This estate includes Chrisp Street Market, which was greatly commended by Lewis Mumford. The same era also saw the construction of the Robin Hood Gardens housing complex (overlooking the northern portal of the Blackwall Tunnel) – designed by architects Peter and Alison Smithson – and the similarly brutalist Balfron Tower, Carradale House and Glenkerry House (to the north) – designed by Ernő Goldfinger. Other notable buildings in Poplar include Poplar Baths which closed in 1989 and reopened in 2016 after the efforts of local campaigners.

The importance of the maritime industries attracted many overseas migrant to the area, including the Chinese community in the &quot;Pennyfields&quot; area of Poplar. This area, on the border with Limehouse was a part of the old East End &quot;Chinatown&quot;, most closely associated with Limehouse.

The West India Dock and other local docks had all closed by the end of 1980, so the British Government adopted policies to redevelop the docklands areas, including the creation of the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) in 1981 and the granting of Urban Enterprise Zone status to the Isle of Dogs in 1982.

In 1998, following ballots of the residents, Tower Hamlets Council transferred parts of the Lansbury estate and six other Council housing estates within Poplar to Poplar HARCA, a new housing association set up for the purpose of regenerating the area. The following year, tenants on further estates voted to remain with the council. However, after a lengthy consultation of all Council estates in Tower Hamlets begun in 2002, most estates in Poplar did transfer to Poplar HARCA, East End Homes and other landlords between 2005 and 2007.

===Wartime bombings===
The first airborne terror campaign in Britain took place during the First World War, which caused significant damage and took many lives. German raids on Britain, for example, caused 1,413 deaths and 3,409 injuries. Air raids provided an unprecedented means of striking at resources vital to an enemy&#x27;s war effort. Many of the novel features of the war in the air between 1914 and 1918—the lighting restrictions and blackouts, the air raid warnings and the improvised shelters—became central aspects of the World War II less than 30 years later.

The East End of London was one of the most heavily targeted places. Poplar, in particular, was struck badly by some of the air raids during the World War I. Initially these were at night by Zeppelins which bombed the area indiscriminately, leading to the death of innocent civilians.

The first daylight bombing attack on London by a fixed-wing aircraft took place on 13 June 1917. Fourteen German Gotha G.IV bombers led by &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Ernst Brandenberg flew over Essex and began dropping their bombs. It was a hot day and the sky was hazy; nevertheless, onlookers in London&#x27;s East End were able to see &#x27;a dozen or so big aeroplanes scintillating like so many huge silver dragonflies&#x27;. These three-seater bombers were carrying shrapnel bombs which were dropped just before noon. Numerous bombs fell in rapid succession in various districts. In the East End alone 104 people were killed, 154 seriously injured and 269 slightly injured.

The gravest incident that day was a direct hit on a primary school in Poplar. In the Upper North Street School at the time were a girls&#x27; class on the top floor, a boys&#x27; class on the middle floor and an infant class of about 50 pupils on the ground floor. The bomb fell through the roof into the girls&#x27; class; it then proceeded to fall through the boys&#x27; classroom before finally exploding in the infant class. Eighteen pupils were killed, of whom sixteen were aged from 4 to 6 years old. The tragedy shocked the British public at the time.

In World War II, Poplar suffered heavily in the Blitz of that war, the Metropolitan Borough losing 770 civilian dead as a result of enemy action. At the height of the bombing, ten Poplar schools were evacuated to Oxford.

==Built environment==
Architecturally, the area is a mixture of 18th- and 19th-century terraced houses and 20th-century council estates. Notable examples include the Lansbury Estate and the Balfron Tower.

A new Church Green next to St. Mary and St. Joseph Church was created in 2012 on the site of the former Blitz-bombed Catholic church, across the road from the current church designed by Adrian Gilbert Scott. It is open to the public during the day and public sculptures include, the former Catholic Boys&#x27; School entrance statue dedicated to dockers and seafarers, a 15-foot crucifix that stood on the site of the old high altar and a contemporary granite and light sculpture, &quot;A Doorway of Hope&quot;, by sculptor Nicolas Moreton.

Poplar High Street is host to a number of landmarks as it had previously been the principal street in Poplar. These include the Old Town Hall, which has mosaic detail and is now a hotel. Poplar Bowls Club, founded in 1910, is part of Poplar Recreation Ground A recently reopened sports centre called &quot;The Workhouse&quot; stands on the site of Poplar Workhouse, where local politician Will Crooks spent some of his earliest years (a nearby council housing estate is named after him). Another is the designated Grade II* listed St Matthias Old Church, now a community centre and formerly a chapel that was built by the East India Company in 1654.

The original Poplar Baths opened in 1852, costing £10,000. It was built to provide public wash facilities for the East End&#x27;s poor as a result of the Baths and Washhouses Act 1846. The Baths were rebuilt in 1933 to a design by Harley Heckford and the larger pool was covered over to convert the building into a theatre and designated the East India Hall. Poplar Baths reopened in 1947 after the Second World War and continued to be used as a swimming facility, attracting on average 225,700 bathers every year between 1954 and 1959, the Baths closed again and was conversion to an industrial training centre in 1988. The Baths once again re-opened on 25 July 2016 and were removed from the Buildings at Risk register.

The Museum of London Docklands in West India Quay, opened in 2003 on the site of a grade I listed early-19th century Georgian &quot;low&quot; sugar warehouses built in 1802 on the side of West India Docks in the Port of London.

==Industry==
Poplar still remains a part of the Port of London as Northumberland Wharf is still retained as a working wharf with special status from the Mayor of London and the Port of London Authority (PLA) as a safeguarded wharf. It is run by Cory Riverside Energy who also managed the Reuse and Recycling Centre which is next to the wharf and for the transportation of waste by barge along the River Thames.

&quot;Poplar Borough Council&quot; had been authorised in 1893 to supply electricity to the borough. Electricity supplies began in October 1900 from a power station on the corner of Glaucus Street and Yeo Street. The station was later known as Poplar Watts Grove (off Devons Road). The generating capacity of the station and the electricity generated over the operational life is as follows:

In 1903-04 there were estimated to be 320 arc lights, 1,649 incandescent lamps, and 130 electric motors connected to the public electricity supply in Poplar. The power station used water from the adjacent Limehouse Cut canal together with cooling towers to condense steam and for cooling.

Upon nationalisation of the electricity industry in 1948 ownership of the station passed to the British Electricity Authority and later to the Central Electricity Generating Board. The CEGB closed the station in 1967 when the thermal efficiency was only 8.39 per cent.

==Politics==

Until 1965, Poplar had its own council which was based at Poplar Town Hall. Since 1965, the area has formed part of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, with its council based at Mulberry Place. The council moved to a new Tower Hamlets Town Hall in Whitechapel Road on 1 March 2023.

The Isle of Dogs and Poplar proper in general achieved notoriety in 1993 when Derek Beackon of the British National Party became a councillor for Millwall ward, in a by election. This was the culmination of years of resentment by local residents of perceived neglect by both Liberal Democrat and Labour Party politicians. Labour regained the ward in the full council election of May 1994, and held all three seats until a further by election in September 2004.

==Education==
Langdon Park School is a mixed secondary school and sixth form, located northeast of Chrisp Street Market.

The George Green&#x27;s School was founded in 1828 by George Green, a shipbuilder and shipwright. It was originally located on East India Dock Road. Today it is a voluntary controlled school supported by the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights located on the Isle of Dogs peninsula.

<text>Populus is a genus of 25–30 species of deciduous flowering plants in the family Salicaceae, native to most of the Northern Hemisphere. English names variously applied to different species include poplar (), aspen, and cottonwood.

The western balsam poplar (&quot;P. trichocarpa&quot;) was the first tree to have its full DNA code determined by DNA sequencing, in 2006.

==Description==

The genus has a large genetic diversity, and can grow from tall, with trunks up to in diameter.
The bark on young trees is smooth and white to greenish or dark gray, and often has conspicuous lenticels; on old trees, it remains smooth in some species, but becomes rough and deeply fissured in others. The shoots are stout, with (unlike in the related willows) the terminal bud present. The leaves are spirally arranged, and vary in shape from triangular to circular or (rarely) lobed, and with a long petiole; in species in the sections &quot;Populus&quot; and &quot;Aigeiros&quot;, the petioles are laterally flattened, so that breezes easily cause the leaves to wobble back and forth, giving the whole tree a &quot;twinkling&quot; appearance in a breeze. Leaf size is very variable even on a single tree, typically with small leaves on side shoots, and very large leaves on strong-growing lead shoots. The leaves often turn bright gold to yellow before they fall during autumn.
The flowers are mostly dioecious (rarely monoecious) and appear in early spring before the leaves. They are borne in long, drooping, sessile or pedunculate catkins produced from buds formed in the axils of the leaves from the previous year. The flowers are each seated in a cup-shaped disk which is borne on the base of a scale which is itself attached to the rachis of the catkin. The scales are obovate, lobed, and fringed, membranous, hairy or smooth, and usually caducous. The male flowers are without calyx or corolla, and comprise a group of four to 60 stamens inserted on a disk; filaments are short and pale yellow; anthers are oblong, purple or red, introrse, and two-celled; the cells open longitudinally. The female flower also has no calyx or corolla, and comprises a single-celled ovary seated in a cup-shaped disk. The style is short, with two to four stigmata, variously lobed, and numerous ovules. Pollination is by wind, with the female catkins lengthening considerably between pollination and maturity. The fruit is a two- to four-valved dehiscent capsule, green to reddish-brown, mature in midsummer, containing numerous minute, light-brown seeds surrounded by tufts of long, soft, white hairs aiding wind dispersal.

==Classification==

The genus &quot;Populus&quot; has traditionally been divided into six sections on the basis of leaf and flower characters; this classification is followed below. Recent genetic studies have largely supported this, confirming some previously suspected reticulate evolution due to past hybridisation and introgression events between the groups. Some species (noted below) had differing relationships indicated by their nuclear DNA (paternally inherited) and chloroplast DNA sequences (maternally inherited), a clear indication of likely hybrid origin. Hybridisation continues to be common in the genus, with several hybrids between species in different sections known. There are currently 57 accepted species in the genus.

=== Phylogeny ===
Some of the most easily identifiable fossils of this genus belongs to &quot;Poplus wilmattae&quot;, which come from the Late Paleocene of North America about 58 million years ago. However, fossils from the Cretaceous of this genus have been found in Tibet and Heilongjiang, China.

==Ecology==
Poplars of the cottonwood section are often wetlands or riparian trees. The aspens are among the most important boreal broadleaf trees.

Poplars and aspens are important food plants for the larvae of a large number of Lepidoptera species. &quot;Pleurotus populinus&quot;, the aspen oyster mushroom, is found exclusively on dead wood of &quot;Populus&quot; trees in North America.

Several species of &quot;Populus&quot; in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe have experienced heavy dieback; this is thought in part to be due to &quot;Sesia apiformis&quot; which bores into the trunk of the tree during its larval stage.

==Cultivation==

Many poplars are grown as ornamental trees, with numerous cultivars used. They have the advantage of growing to a very large size at a rapid pace. Almost all poplars take root readily from cuttings or where broken branches lie on the ground (they also often have remarkable suckering abilities, and can form huge colonies from a single original tree, such as the famous &quot;Pando&quot; forest made of thousands of &quot;Populus tremuloides&quot; clones).

Trees with fastigiate (erect, columnar) branching are particularly popular, and are widely grown across Europe and southwest Asia. However, like willows, poplars have very vigorous and invasive root systems stretching up to from the trees; planting close to houses or ceramic water pipes may result in damaged foundations and cracked walls and pipes due to their search for moisture.

A simple, reproducible, high-frequency micropropagation protocol in eastern cottonwood &quot;Populus deltoides&quot; has been reported by Yadav et al. 2009.

===India===
In India, the poplar is grown commercially by farmers, mainly in the Punjab region. Common poplar varieties are:
*G48 (grown in the plains of Punjab, Haryana, UP)
*w22 (grown in mountainous regions, e.g., Himachal Pradesh, Pathankot, Jammu)

The trees are grown from &quot;kalam&quot; or cuttings, harvested annually in January and February, and commercially available up to 15November.

Poplars are most commonly used to make plywood: Yamuna Nagar in Haryana state has a large plywood industry reliant upon poplar. It is graded according to sizes known as &quot;over&quot; (over ), &quot;under&quot; (), and &quot;sokta&quot; (less than ).

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, poplar is grown on a commercial level by farmers in Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provinces. However, all varieties are seriously susceptible to termite attack, causing significant losses to poplar every year. Logs of poplar are therefore also used as bait in termite traps for biocontrol of termites in crops.

==Uses==

Although the wood from &quot;Populus&quot; is known as poplar wood, a common high-quality hardwood &quot;poplar&quot; with a greenish colour is actually from an unrelated genus &quot;Liriodendron&quot;. &quot;Populus&quot; wood is a lighter, more porous material.

Its flexibility and close grain make it suitable for a number of applications, similar to those of willow. The Greeks and Etruscans made shields of poplar, and Pliny the Elder also recommended poplar for this purpose. Poplar continued to be used for shield construction through the Middle Ages and was renowned for a durability similar to that of oak, but with a substantial reduction in weight.

===Food===
In addition to the foliage and other parts of &quot;Populus&quot; species being consumed by animals, the starchy sap layer (underneath the outer bark) is edible to humans, both raw and cooked.

===Manufacturing===
*In many areas, fast-growing hybrid poplars are grown on plantations for pulpwood
*Poplar is widely used for the manufacture of paper.
*It is also sold as inexpensive hardwood timber, used for pallets and cheap plywood; more specialised uses including matches and matchboxes and the boxes for Camembert cheese.
*Poplar wood is also widely used in the snowboard industry for the snowboard core, because it has exceptional flexibility, and is sometimes used in the bodies of electric guitars and drums.
*Poplar wood, particularly when seasoned, makes a good hearth for a bow drill.
*Because of its high tannic acid content, the bark has been used in Europe for tanning leather.
*Poplar wood can be used to produce chopsticks or wooden shoes.
*Baking moulds from peeled poplar may be used in the freezer, oven, or microwave oven.

===Energy===
Interest exists in using poplar as an energy crop for biomass, in energy forestry systems, particularly in light of its high energy-in to energy-out ratio, large carbon mitigation potential, and fast growth.
In the United Kingdom, poplar (as with fellow energy crop willow) is typically grown in a short rotation coppice system for two to five years (with single or multiple stems), then harvested and burned - the yield of some varieties can be as high as 12 oven-dry tonnes per hectare every year.
In warmer regions like Italy this crop can produce up to 13.8, 16.4 oven-dry tonnes of biomass per hectare every year for biannual and triennial cutting cycles also showing a positive energy balance and a high energy efficiency.

===Fuel===
Biofuel is another option for using poplar as bioenergy supply. In the United States, scientists studied converting short rotation coppice poplar into sugars for biofuel (e.g. ethanol) production.
Considering the relative cheap price, the process of making biofuel from SRC can be economically feasible, although the conversion yield from short rotation coppice (as juvenile crops) were lower than regular mature wood. Besides biochemical conversion, thermochemical conversion (e.g. fast pyrolysis) was also studied for making biofuel from short rotation coppice poplar and was found to have higher energy recovery than that from bioconversion.

===Art===
Poplar was the most common wood used in Italy for panel paintings; the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; and most famous early Italian Renaissance paintings are on poplar. The wood is generally white, often with a slightly yellowish colour.

Some stringed instruments are made with one-piece poplar backs; violas made in this fashion are said to have a particularly resonant tone. Similarly, though typically it is considered to have a less attractive grain than the traditional sitka spruce, poplar is beginning to be targeted by some harp luthiers as a sustainable and even superior alternative for their sound boards: in these cases another hardwood veneer is sometimes applied to the resonant poplar base both for cosmetic reasons, and supposedly to fine-tune the acoustic properties.

===Land management===
Lombardy poplars are frequently used as a windbreak around agricultural fields to protect against wind erosion.

===Agriculture===
Logs from the poplar provide a growing medium for shiitake mushrooms.

===Phytoremediation===
Poplar represents a suitable candidate for phytoremediation since it has the ability to remove and store harmful pollutants in its trunk while also removing air pollution. This plant has been successfully used to target many types of pollutants including trace element (TEs) in soil and sewage sludge, Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCBs), Trichloroethylene (TCE), Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAHs).

==Culture==
Two notable poems in English lament the cutting down of poplars, William Cowper&#x27;s &quot;The Poplar Field&quot; and Gerard Manley Hopkins&#x27; &quot;Binsey Poplars felled 1879&quot;.

In Billie Holiday&#x27;s &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;, she sings &quot;Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze/Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees…&quot;.

The Odd Poplars Alley, in Iași, Romania, is one of the spots where Mihai Eminescu sought inspiration in his works (the poem &quot;Down Where the Lonely Poplars Grow&quot;). In 1973, the 15 white poplars still left (with age ranges between 233 and 371 years) were declared natural monuments.

In Ukraine, one of neighborhoods of Kyiv is named after &quot;Populus nigra&quot; as Osokorky, a local name.

<text>Thranduil is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth legendarium. He first appears as a supporting character in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, where he is simply known as the Elvenking, the ruler of the Elves who lived in the woodland realm of Mirkwood. The character is properly named in Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and appears briefly in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;.

The character has appeared in adaptations of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in other media. The 2010s film adaptations of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; expands the character&#x27;s role within the narrative, using information from Tolkien&#x27;s later works about the character and original material by the filmmakers. Thranduil is portrayed by the American actor Lee Pace; he has been well received by fans and critics.

==Development==

Thranduil is one of the Sindar or Grey Elves who speak Sindarin as opposed to Quenya, the language spoken by Noldorin Elves like Galadriel. The name &quot;Thranduil&quot; means &quot;vigorous spring&quot; in Sindarin. Following the end of the First Age and the destruction of much of Beleriand during the War of Wrath, many Sindar migrate into the east of Middle-earth. Crossing the Misty Mountains, they found populations of Silvan Elves living in the woodlands that bordered the River Anduin. The Sindar were welcomed by these people, and some were made leaders and rulers over them. In Appendix B of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; Tolkien states that Thranduil was one of the Sindar who migrated eastward early in the Second Age and established kingdoms among the Silvan Elves. Later writings in &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; make Thranduil&#x27;s father Oropher the founder of the realm, which originally included the southern portions of the forest of Greenwood the Great, later known as Mirkwood.

Tolkien described Thranduil in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as having &quot;golden hair&quot; with a crown made of red leaves and berries in the autumn, and wearing a similar crown of flowers in the spring.

==Biography==

Thranduil marched with his father and a large army of their people to join the Last Alliance of Elves and Men in their war against Sauron at the end of the Second Age. The Elves suffered serious losses, including Oropher, who was killed in the Battle of Dagorlad before the Black Gate of Mordor. Following the war, Thranduil, now king of his people, led the remnants of his army, only a third of what had set out, back to their woodland home in Mirkwood. Hearing word of the Disaster of the Gladden Fields shortly after their return, Thranduil set out to aid the Dúnedain; he arrived too late to save them, but was able to finish the destruction of the Orc horde and prevent the mutilation of the dead.

During the Third Age, Thranduil led his people to the north-east corner of the forest and there created an underground fortress and series of great halls. He was inspired in this enterprise by Thingol&#x27;s halls of Menegroth in Doriath during the First Age, and like Thingol, he used the skill of the Dwarves to aid in making his stronghold.

Being far in the north, and on the eastern edge of an increasingly perilous Mirkwood, Thranduil&#x27;s realm was somewhat isolated, but he traded with the Dwarves and Men who lived nearby in Erebor, Dale, and Esgaroth (Laketown). An attack by the dragon Smaug destroyed Erebor and Dale, and reduced Esgaroth to a shell of its former self, though there remained a healthy wine trade between the lake and the wood.
This situation changed with the arrival of Bilbo Baggins and a company of Dwarves, on their quest to reclaim Erebor. 
The Dwarves were captured by Thranduil&#x27;s guards and, suspicious of their intentions, he had them locked in his dungeons from which they later escaped inside barrels.

After the death of Smaug, Thranduil along with the people of Esgaroth demanded a share of the treasure of Erebor, beginning a confrontation with Thorin&#x27;s company, who were reinforced by an army from the Iron Hills, that nearly led to war. War with the Dwarves was averted by the intervention of the wizard Gandalf upon the arrival of the allied forces of Orcs and wargs. The combined army of Elves, Dwarves, and Men was victorious in the ensuing Battle of the Five Armies, but at great cost of life.

During the events of the War of the Ring as depicted in the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, Thranduil does what he can to aid his allies, including holding the creature Gollum in his dungeons for interrogation by Gandalf on the history of the One Ring. Gollum later escapes with the aid of Orcs who attack Thranduil&#x27;s realm, and his son Legolas is sent to Rivendell to seek the counsel of Elrond and Gandalf. Thranduil and his people withstood attacks by Sauron&#x27;s forces during northern battles of the war. Having routed their foes in the north, Thranduil&#x27;s forces moved south, and joined with the armies of Lorien under Celeborn and Galadriel in destroying Dol Guldur, cleansing Mirkwood of Sauron&#x27;s taint of evil. In the aftermath, Thranduil, along with Celeborn, renamed Mirkwood &quot;Eryn Lasgalen&quot;, The Wood of Greenleaves. Thranduil&#x27;s realm expands after the wars, and he and his people enjoyed peace.

==Adaptations==

===&quot;The Hobbit&quot; film series===


Peter Jackson cast Lee Pace for his 2012–2014 film trilogy &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, stating that Pace had been the filmmakers&#x27; favourite for the part after his performance in the 2006 film &quot;The Fall&quot;.

The New Zealand screenwriter and film producer Philippa Boyens, a co-writer of the screenplay for &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, noted that Tolkien only revealed further detailed information about the character, including his name and backstory, in the book&#x27;s sequel. Boyens suggested that there was &quot;a lot more story&quot; behind Thranduil, and that he was an interesting character in terms of what they had to make up or expand as part of the films&#x27; storytelling as there is not a lot of information present in the original source material.

The Elves of Mirkwood are a minor element in the novel, and Thranduil in particular has no quarrel with Thorin or his company of Dwarves, who are only imprisoned because they are trespassing on the Elvenking&#x27;s territory and refuse to tell him why. The existing story narrative of Thranduil as an isolationist leader was identified by the writers, who worked with Pace to develop the character&#x27;s backstory. In the film series, Thranduil rides a giant elk resembling a &quot;Megaloceros&quot;; the &quot;elk&quot; was a horse named Moose, made up to look like a deer. This version of the character is depicted as somewhat unhinged.

Pace called Thranduil the &quot;Elvenking&quot; instead of his actual name during interviews, following Tolkien&#x27;s usage in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, which Pace read as a high school student. In an interview with &quot;The Georgia Straight&quot;, Pace explained that Thranduil, unlike other villainous characters he had played like Ronan the Accuser, is morally ambiguous, as he is only at odds with the Dwarves. Pace felt that it was important for him to find enjoyment in playing characters who are larger-than-life, and that it was on him to try to figure out who his character was with what little that he knew. Pace praised the rest of the cast and crew members of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film project as inspirational, noting that they were collectively telling a big story which was intended to be fully fleshed out on the green screen and which they had no idea how it would ultimately turn out.

===In other media===

In the 1977 animated version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Thranduil is voiced by Otto Preminger.

Thranduil is one of the playable heroes in &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II&quot; (2006) real-time strategy game, joining Elrond, Arwen, Glorfindel, and the Dwarves in destroying Dol Guldur in the final battle of the good storyline, and falling to the Goblins mustered by the Mouth of Sauron in the alternate evil storyline.

In 2020, Weta Workshop released a limited edition of a statue featuring &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film series iteration of Thranduil, depicted seated on his throne with a guard standing in attention before him. The statue recreates Pace&#x27;s likeness for the character and is designed at 1:6 scale, measuring 41.33 inches in width and 39.37 inches in height.

==Reception and analysis==

===Tolkien===
In an article published by &quot;Tor.com&quot; as part of a bi-weekly series titled &quot;Exploring the People of Middle-earth&quot;, Megan N. Fontenot found it surprising that in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, none of the attendees at the Council of Elrond pays much attention to Legolas&#x27; status as Thranduil&#x27;s heir. Fontenot found the lore behind Thranduil to be underdeveloped, as his name appeared more often in the Appendices than in the main narrative.

Tom Loback, writing in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, attempts to evaluate the strength of the orc forces that attacked Thranduil in the battle under Mirkwood&#x27;s dark trees (Dagor Dauroth). He estimated, on the basis of the standard words that Tolkien uses for military forces, and the need for the forces to be superior to Thranduil&#x27;s, that the Witch-king used a &quot;legion&quot; of around 10,000 orcs for the initial reconnaissance, and an &quot;army&quot; of 2 or 3 legions of orcs, for the main attack.

===&quot;The Hobbit&quot; film trilogy===
Lee Pace&#x27;s portrayal of the Elvenking in Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy was received warmly. Dennis Perkins from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; found that Pace&#x27;s &quot;eerie intensity&quot; made him a &quot;fine elf king&quot;. Alisha Coelho from &quot;India Times&quot; described Pace&#x27;s Thranduil as &quot;a cold, calculative and condescending king&quot; who is prettier than Galadriel but has less heart than Elrond. &quot;Business Review&quot; praised Pace&#x27;s &quot;aggressive&quot; Thranduil as one of the better performances of &quot;The Battle of the Five Armies&quot;, and said that the movie gives audiences a better insight into the Elvenking&#x27;s motivations as well as the reasons behind his isolationist outlook.

Nathan Caddell from &quot;The Georgia Straight&quot; observed that Pace &quot;tried to stay as loyal as he could to the source material that he loved, using any small crumbs to try to gain more information about his role&quot;, and noted that while it is debatable as to whether Thranduil is an evil character, the &quot;vindictive elf&quot; is a departure from Pace&#x27;s previous roles, which reflected his warm personality. In a review of the 4K Ultra HD Blu-Ray edition of &quot;The Desolation Of Smaug&quot;, M. Enois Duarte from &quot;High-Def Digest&quot; wrote that the confrontation between Thorin and Thranduil was one of the more interesting aspects of the expanded material introduced by Jackson&#x27;s vision of Tolkien&#x27;s original narrative for &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

Conversely, Kirsten Acuna from &quot;Business Insider&quot; found the depiction of Thranduil&#x27;s motivations in the film series contradictory; she observed that he repeatedly stresses the prioritization of his people&#x27;s lives to justify his unwillingness to help other communities in &quot;The Desolation of Smaug&quot;, and yet in the sequel is willing to risk the same over a war for the White Gems. Nevertheless, she found Thranduil to be much more likeable by the end of &quot;The Battle of the Five Armies&quot;.

Tanja Välisalo, in an empirical study of the audience reception of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; films, found that Thranduil was mentioned by just under 5% of respondents, placing him 7th in the list of people&#x27;s favourites among the films&#x27; cast of characters. They found the character sexually attractive, along with Thorin (played by the &quot;handsome&quot; Richard Armitage). In addition, the audience had an &quot;allegiance&quot; to the character; Välisalo cites as illustration comments like &quot;Thranduil truly captured me&quot; and &quot;this character&#x27;s make-up and character design ... were a perfect success.&quot;&#x27;

<text>Pratt&#x27;s Bottom is a village in Greater London, England, within the London Borough of Bromley and, prior to 1965, within the historic county of Kent. It is south of its parent parish of Orpington, lies about 100 metres above sea level and beyond London&#x27;s urban sprawl.

It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.

It is a small village, consisting of a main road (Rushmore Hill) on which is situated a school, a village shop (the post office was closed as part of the widespread branch closures of June 2008) and the Bulls Head pub, two small churches and a few side roads. There is a village hall behind the green.

==History==

A &quot;bottom&quot; in this context means a valley or hollow, and the Pratts were a noble family once seated in the area. Pratt&#x27;s Bottom formed part of the ancient, and later civil, parish of Chelsfield in Kent and was part of the Bromley Rural District from 1896. The parish was abolished in 1934 and the village became part of Orpington Urban District. In 1965 it was transferred to Greater London, to form part of the London Borough of Bromley.

A tollgate stood in the village for many years. The turnpike cottage was demolished in the 1930s but is still seen as emblematic of the village, so much so that it is the basis of the recent village sign placed on the green.
Sue Short has written a book about the history of the village titled &quot;Pratts Bottom: A Journey Through Life&quot;.

<doc id="94251" wikidata="Q49191" url="?curid=94251" title="Portsmouth, New Hampshire">
<text>Portsmouth is a city in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. At the 2020 census it had a population of 21,956. A historic seaport and popular summer tourist destination on the Piscataqua River bordering the state of Maine, Portsmouth was formerly the home of the Strategic Air Command&#x27;s Pease Air Force Base, since converted to Portsmouth International Airport at Pease.

==History==
American Indians of the Abenaki and other Algonquian languages-speaking nations, and their predecessors, inhabited the territory of coastal New Hampshire for thousands of years before European contact.

The first known European to explore and write about the area was Martin Pring in 1603. The Piscataqua River is a tidal estuary with a swift current, but forms a good natural harbor. The west bank of the harbor was settled by European colonists in 1630 and named Strawbery Banke, after the many wild strawberries growing there. The village was protected by Fort William and Mary on what is now New Castle Island. Strategically located for trade between upstream industries and mercantile interests abroad, the port prospered. Fishing, lumber and shipbuilding were principal businesses of the region. Enslaved Africans were imported as laborers as early as 1645 and were integral to building the city&#x27;s prosperity. Portsmouth was part of the Triangle Trade, which made significant profits from slavery.

At the town&#x27;s incorporation in 1653, it was named &quot;Portsmouth&quot; in honor of the colony&#x27;s founder, John Mason. He had been captain of the English port of Portsmouth, Hampshire, after which New Hampshire is named. Richard Martyn was one of the founders of the first church in Portsmouth, and served as Selectman, Representative to the General Court, Speaker of the House, and Chief Justice. 
When Queen Anne&#x27;s War ended in 1712, Governor Joseph Dudley selected the town to host negotiations for the 1713 Treaty of Portsmouth, which temporarily ended hostilities between the Abenaki Indians and the colonies of Massachusetts Bay and New Hampshire.

In 1774, in the lead-up to the Revolution, Paul Revere rode to Portsmouth warning that the British Royal Navy was coming to capture the port. Although Fort William and Mary protected the harbor, the Patriot government moved the capital inland to Exeter, which ensured that it would be under no threat from the Royal Navy, which bombarded Falmouth (now Portland, Maine) instead on October 18, 1775. Portsmouth was the destination for several of Beaumarchais&#x27;s ships containing materiel, such as artillery, tents, and gunpowder, to help the American revolutionary effort. African Americans helped defend Portsmouth and New England during the war. In 1779, 19 enslaved African Americans from Portsmouth wrote a and asked that it abolish slavery, in recognition of their war contributions and in keeping with the principles of the Revolution. The legislature tabled their petition. New Hampshire abolished slavery in 1857, by which time the institution was effectively extinct in the state.

Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s 1807 embargo against American trade with Britain severely disrupted New England&#x27;s trade with Canada, and several local businessmen went bankrupt. Portsmouth was host to numerous privateers during the War of 1812. In 1849, Portsmouth was incorporated as a city.

Once one of the nation&#x27;s busiest ports and shipbuilding cities, Portsmouth expressed its wealth in fine architecture. It has significant examples of Colonial, Georgian, and Federal style houses, some of which are now museums. Portsmouth&#x27;s heart has stately brick Federalist stores and townhouses, built all-of-a-piece after devastating early 19th-century fires. The worst was in 1813 when 244 buildings burned. A fire district was created that required all new buildings within its boundaries to be built of brick with slate roofs; this created the downtown&#x27;s distinctive appearance. The city was also noted for the production of boldly wood-veneered federal-style (neoclassical) furniture, particularly by the master cabinet maker Langley Boardman.

The Industrial Revolution spurred economic growth in New Hampshire mill towns such as Dover, Keene, Laconia, Manchester, Nashua and Rochester, where rivers provided water power for the mills. It shifted growth to the new mill towns. The port of Portsmouth declined, but the city survived Victorian-era doldrums, a time described in the works of Thomas Bailey Aldrich, particularly in his 1869 novel &quot;The Story of a Bad Boy&quot;.

In the 20th century, the city founded a Historic District Commission, which has worked to protect much of the city&#x27;s irreplaceable architectural legacy. In 2008, the National Trust for Historic Preservation named Portsmouth one of the &quot;Dozen Distinctive Destinations&quot;. The compact and walkable downtown on the waterfront draws tourists and artists, who each summer throng the cafes, restaurants and shops around Market Square. Portsmouth annually celebrates the revitalization of its downtown (in particular Market Square) with Market Square Day, a celebration dating back to 1977, produced by the non-profit Pro Portsmouth, Inc.

This emphasis on historic preservation and revitalization was the result of much pain and destruction. Portsmouth is largely walkable due to its network of streets and tight blocks filled with preserved Revolution-era homes. However, like many other cities all over the region (and nation), Portsmouth was hit by Urban Renewal, a planning tool used nationwide to provide Federal funds to address “urban blight” and revitalize downtown cores after decades of suburbanization and loss of tax revenue. An urban renewal district for Portsmouth was its North End neighborhood, which similar to Boston’s, was home to an Italian-American population.

In 1964, federal funds were allocated to the North End project area in Portsmouth, for urban renewal. Prior to redevelopment, the North End was a mix of residential and commercial buildings, with many older houses converted into storefronts with apartments above. In the mid-1960s, the area was considered overcrowded, run down, and a fire hazard. As a result, the Portsmouth Housing Authority proposed the destruction of approximately 200 buildings, a school, and a church and redevelopment for commercial, industrial, and public use, rather than for residences. The project would displace approximately 300 families as a result. In 1968, Portsmouth Preservation Inc., a preservation organization was formed to attempt to save some of the historic building stock in the area slated for redevelopment. After bitter fighting and preservation advocacy, just fourteen houses were saved and mostly moved to an area known today as “The Hill”. This preservation was only the beginning, and eventually efforts conspired to created the afformentioned historic district. Urban renewal was many events that led to its creation.

Portsmouth shipbuilding history has had a long symbiotic relationship with Kittery, Maine, across the Piscataqua River. In 1781–1782, the naval hero John Paul Jones lived in Portsmouth while he supervised construction of his ship &quot;Ranger&quot;, which was built on nearby Badger&#x27;s Island in Kittery. During that time, he boarded at the Captain Gregory Purcell house, which now bears Jones&#x27; name, as it is the only surviving property in the United States associated with him. Built by the master housewright Hopestill Cheswell, an African American, it has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. It now serves as the Portsmouth Historical Society Museum.

The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, established in 1800 as the first federal navy yard, is on Seavey&#x27;s Island in Kittery, Maine. The base is famous for being the site of the 1905 signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth which ended the Russo-Japanese War. Though US President Theodore Roosevelt orchestrated the peace conference that brought Russian and Japanese diplomats to Portsmouth and the Shipyard, he never came to Portsmouth, relying on the Navy and people of New Hampshire as the hosts. Roosevelt won the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize for his diplomacy in bringing about an end to the war.

Portsmouth is drained by Berrys Brook, Sagamore Creek and the Piscataqua River, which is the boundary between New Hampshire and Maine. The highest point in the city is above sea level, within Pease International Airport.

<text>Obadele &quot;Oba&quot; Thompson BSS (born 30 March 1976) is a Barbados-born former sprinter, lawyer, author, and speaker. He won Barbados&#x27;s first and only Olympic medal as an independent country by placing third in the 100 metres at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. He is a three-time Olympian (1996, 2000, and 2004), and a finalist at each Olympics. His personal best performances are 9.87 seconds for the 100 m, 19.97 seconds for the 200 metres (both Barbadian records), and 45.38 seconds for the 400 metres. He has held the indoor 55 metres world record (5.99 sec.) since 1997.

Obadele&#x27;s Olympic success followed a collegiate career at the University of Texas-El Paso (UTEP) where he amassed several prestigious awards for his academics, athletics, and leadership. As a collegian, he won four individual NCAA sprint titles: indoor 200 m (1996 and 1997) and the outdoor 100 and 200 metres (1997). He set two NCAA records: indoor 55 m (1997) and indoor 200 m (1996). He established two world records: 55 m (1997) and the World Junior 100 m (1994). In 1996, he ran the then-fastest 100 m recorded under all conditions (9.69 sec.).

He was an eleven-time NCAA All-American and a sixteen-time Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Champion. Thompson won several Athlete of the Year awards, including the UTEP Athlete of the Year (1996 and 1997), US Track &amp; Field and Cross Country Coaches Association (USTFCCCA) NCAA Division I Male Indoor Athlete of the Year (1997), and the Stan Bates WAC Male Student-Athlete of the Year (1997). He has also been listed as one of UTEP&#x27;s all-time top 10 male athletes.

Thompson was a three-time USTFCCCA Academic All-American (1995–1997). In 1996, he became a member of Beta Gamma Sigma (BGS) honor society, the highest recognition business students worldwide can receive from an Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) accredited business program. In 1997, he was named a College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) First-Team At-Large Academic All-American (formerly the GTE First-Team At-Large Academic All-American award) and received the State of Texas Certificate of Merit for his exemplary achievement in academics and athletics. In 1998, he became a UTEP Alumni Association Top Ten Senior awardee, and received the NCAA Today&#x27;s Top VIII Award (now the NCAA Today&#x27;s Top 10) for outstanding leadership, athletics and academics, along with two-time NFL Super Bowl Champion, Peyton Manning, who attended the University of Tennessee.

After retiring from a decade-long professional athletics career, Thompson published his first book, &quot;Secrets of a Student-Athlete: A Reality Check&quot;, which was endorsed by legendary Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski. Thompson was a keynote speaker at the official launch of the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup in Barbados and has participated in leadership development programs, including with the West Indies Cricket Team. He has also served variously as a speaker and panellist on matters related to sports management, performance, and anti-doping.

Thompson was inducted into the UTEP Track and Field Hall of Fame in 2007, and into the UTEP Athletics and Drake Relays Halls of Fame in 2011.

He graduated from UTEP summa cum laude in economics and marketing and received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Texas School of Law. He practices international arbitration and litigation.

==Athletics career==

===Junior athletics===
Obadele began his athletic career at about six years old in Barbados at the Charles F. Broomes Primary School before transferring to Wesley Hall Junior School. However, his talents blossomed at his secondary school, Harrison College, under the tutelage of his physical education teacher, Orlando Greene (Barbados 800 m national record holder). He was also coached by respected Barbadian coaches Frank &quot;Blackie&quot; Blackman and the late Anthony Lovell.

====1990–1993====
Thompson first represented Barbados at age 14, winning the 100 and 200 metres at the 1990 Caribbean Union of Teachers (CUT) Games in Georgetown, Guyana. He again showed promise by winning the 100 m in the under-17 age division at the 1991 CARIFTA Games in Port of Spain, Trinidad. The CARIFTA Games is an annual Caribbean junior track and field championship that has produced notable Caribbean sprinters including Usain Bolt, Merlene Ottey and Pauline Davis-Thompson. Over the next three years, Thompson dominated the 100 m at the regional junior level, winning four successive CARIFTA Games 100 m titles (twice in both the under-17 and under-20 divisions), and not losing to a Caribbean junior sprinter at this distance since he was 14 years old. In 1993, Thompson became the Barbados national senior 100 m champion, and placed third and second in the 100 and 200 metres, respectively, at the Pan American Junior Athletics Championships in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. A few weeks later, at only 17 years old, he won his first 100 m title at the 1993 Senior Central American and Caribbean Championships (CAC) in Cali, Colombia, clocking a slightly wind-assisted 10.30 sec. (+2.1 m/s wind).

Despite attending one of the top academic high schools in the Caribbean and being among the best sprinters in his age group in the world, he was initially not recruited by any universities because Barbados was then only known for being a top tourist destination and producing outstanding cricketers, not sprinters. He was also not invited to the top American junior track meets for similar reasons. Not deterred, in early 1993, Thompson contacted Hall of Fame former UTEP head track coach, Bob Kitchens, who had trained Nigerian sprinter, Olapade Adeniken, to the 1992 NCAA Outdoor 100 and 200 metres titles.

In August 1993, Thompson left Barbados on an athletic scholarship to become part of UTEP&#x27;s long legacy of outstanding track and field athletes, which includes: Bob Beamon (1968 Olympic long jump champion), Suleiman Nyambui (1980 Olympic 5000 m silver medalist), Bert Cameron (1983 World Champion in the 400 m), Blessing Okagbare (2008 Olympic long jump silver medalist), and Churandy Martina (European Champion in the 100 and 200 metres).

====1994====
Thompson made an immediate impact on the collegiate scene, while still only 17 years old, he reached the finals at the 1994 NCAA Indoor Championships in the 55 and 200 metres—the only male athlete to do so that year—while helping his team finish third overall. He opened his outdoor season before his home crowd at the CARTIFA Games in Barbados, defending his under-20 100 m title in a new meet record (10.33 sec.), and winning the 200 m for the first time (20.71 sec.). His record-setting 100 m run earned him the Austin Sealy Award for Most Outstanding Performance of the championships. Two weeks later at the Sierra Medical Center/UTEP Invitational in El Paso, Texas, Thompson established his first global mark by equaling the World Junior Record of 10.08 sec. in the 100 m (broken in 1998 by Dwain Chambers).

Unfortunately, shortly afterward he sustained his first major injury, a non-displaced fracture in his neck, which went improperly diagnosed for several months. Despite this season-altering injury, Thompson helped UTEP finish second overall at the NCAA Outdoor Championships, as part of the 4 × 100 m and 4 × 400 m relays. He also won the Jamaica Junior National Championships in the 100 m (as a visiting athlete), the CAC Junior Championships in the 100 and 200 metres, placed fourth in the 100 m at the World Junior Championships and was the youngest semifinalist in 100 m at the Commonwealth Games in Victoria, Canada.

====1995====

Obadele completed his final year in the junior (under-20) category by dominating the yearly global 100 m performance list. He twice recorded the fastest junior 100 m time (10.18 sec.) and ran 8 of the 11 fastest junior 100 m times that year. His most memorable victory came in the 100 m invitational race at the Drake Relays in Des Moines, Iowa, where he defeated his idol Carl Lewis (nine-time Olympic gold medalist), Mark Witherspoon (member of the 1992 US Olympic 100 m team), and Sam Jefferson (1994 NCAA 100 m champion).

Internationally, Thompson successfully defended his title in the 100 m at the Senior CAC Championships in Guatemala, while adding the 200 m title in a new championship record of 20.49 sec., which was the third-fastest time by a junior athlete that season. He was the youngest semifinalist in the 200 m at the World (Senior) Championships in Gothenburg, Sweden, and won a silver medal in the 100 m at the World University Games in Fukuoka, Japan.

===Senior athletics===

====1996====
Obadele started the 1996 season on fire, winning his first NCAA Indoor Championship in an NCAA indoor 200 m record. His time of 20.36 sec. shattered the old mark of 20.59 sec. set seven years earlier by four-time Olympic Champion, Michael Johnson, and equaling the then third-fast time in that event.
To celebrate his 20th birthday, Thompson ran 45.38 sec. in his first competitive 400 m since he was 13 years old. Two weeks later, in his season-opening 100 m, he clocked the fastest time ever recorded by a human under any conditions—a wind-assisted time of 9.69 sec.—which could not be ratified as an official world record because the tailwind (+5 m/s) far exceeded the +2.0 m/s legal limit. This performance broke the mark set by Carl Lewis in 1988 (9.78 sec.) and stood for 12 years until Tyson Gay ran a wind-aided 9.68 sec. at the 2008 US Olympic Trials.

Thompson sustained a groin injury during that race, forcing him to miss practice for a week. Injuries struck again months later in the semifinals of the 100 and 200 metres (groin and hamstring strains, respectively) at the 1996 NCAA Outdoor Championships in Eugene, Oregon. He withdrew from the meet, extinguishing the anticipated showdown with Trinidadian sprinter, Ato Boldon of UCLA.

Sidelined by those injuries for three weeks, Thompson&#x27;s once bright Olympic prospects darkened grimly as he returned to training with only one month to prepare for his first Olympic Games. At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, he reached the 100 m semifinals, but exceeded expectations by finishing fourth in the 200 m finals behind Michael Johnson, who set an amazing new world record of 19.32 sec., Frankie Fredericks of Namibia (19.68 sec.) and Boldon (19.80 sec.). Obadele&#x27;s fourth-place run of 20.14 sec. established a new Barbados national record, and placed him ahead of Mike Marsh (the defending Olympic 200 m champion) and Jeff Williams (1995 World Championship 200 m bronze medalist). At only 20 years old, &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; magazine ranked Thompson #5 in the 200 m in the world.

====1997====

Obadele started his senior collegiate season by winning the WAC indoor 55 m in 5.99 sec.—a new NCAA record and his second world record. He is the first and only man to go under the 6-second barrier in that event. At the NCAA Indoor Championships, he became the third male athlete to win back-to-back 200 m titles. Unfortunately, he false started in the 55 m finals, despite being heavily favoured to win after running 6.08 sec. in the semifinals, which was 0.10 sec. faster than all competitors at the entire meet. In May, he defeated the 1996 Olympic 100 m champion and world record holder, Donovan Bailey, in the 100 m in Tempe, Arizona. Thompson also co-captained his team to back-to-back WAC Outdoor titles. In rainy conditions at the NCCA Outdoor Championships in Bloomington, Indiana, he won the NCAA 100 and 200 metres in 10.13 sec. and 20.03 sec., respectively, running the latter into a heavy headwind. He became only the sixth person since 1969 to win this double.

====Professional athletics career====

=====1997=====
After the collegiate season, Thompson placed sixth in the 200 m at the 1997 World Championships in Athens, Greece. He also finished second in the same event at the IAAF Grand Prix Finals in Fukuoka, Japan. He moved up the &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; rankings to #4 in the 200 m in the world.

=====1998=====
In the summer of 1998, Thompson relocated to Austin, Texas to work with Dan Pfaff, who had coached Bailey to the 1996 Olympic 100 m title. Pfaff helped Thompson shake off mid-season woes and finish the last two months of competition strongly. During that period, he broke the Barbados national 100 m record four times. On 5 September, he placed second in a photo finish to Fredericks in the 100 m Grand Prix Final in Moscow, Russia. A week later, on 11 September, he recorded his all-time personal best of 9.87 sec. en route to winning the 100 m at the World Cup in Athletics in Johannesburg, South Africa, erasing the championship record set by Ben Johnson in 1985. At the time, Thompson&#x27;s performance was the fourth-fastest legal 100 m in history (only 0.03 sec. outside Bailey&#x27;s world record Olympic victory of 9.84 sec.), and the second-fastest 100 m in 1998 (0.01 sec. behind Boldon&#x27;s 9.86 sec.). Days later, on 17 September, he won the 100 m bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, behind Boldon and Fredericks, after leaving the starting blocks last. &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; ranked him #6 in the world in the 100 m.

=====1999=====
In March, Thompson won the silver medal in the 200 m at the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Maebashi, Japan. His time of 20.26 sec. was the then third-fastest all-time performance. Later that season, Thompson placed fourth in the 100 and 200 metres at the World Championships in Seville, Spain and &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; ranked him #5 and #6 in those events, respectively.

=====2000=====

Obadele reached the zenith of his athletic career in 2000. After rounding into form on European track circuit, he injured his big toe while placing second to Maurice Greene in the 100 m at the Monaco Golden League meeting, forcing him to return to the US for treatment six weeks before the 2000 Sydney Games. He returned to competition ten days before the Games to set a 200 m personal best of 19.97 sec. in Yokohama, Japan. At the Games, he won the bronze medal in the 100 m in 10.04 sec. behind Greene (9.87 sec.) and Boldon (9.99 sec.) and placed fourth in the 200 m, although he and Boldon both ran 20.20 sec.

His bronze medal was Barbados&#x27; first and only Olympic medal and only the second Olympic medal won by a Barbadian athlete (at the 1960 Rome Olympics, Barbadian Jim Wedderburn won bronze with three Jamaicans on the West Indies Federation 4 x 400 metres relay team).

By season end, &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; ranked Thompson #3 in the world in the 100 and 200 metres, while the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) ranked him #3 in the 100 m and #2 in the 200 m.

====Injury years====

=====2001=====

Injuries ravished Thompson&#x27;s 2001 season, and he competed sparing. Ironically, although he never ran a 200 m that season, he reached a career-high IAAF #1 world ranking in that event for several weeks based on his accumulated IAAF points. Three weeks before the 2001 World Championships in Edmonton, Alberta, Thompson sustained a pectoral tear during training but rebounded and narrowly missed making the 100 m finals while heavily bandaged.

=====2002–2009=====

The years 2002–2009 were very lean ones for Obadele, characterised primarily by recurring and new injuries and scant appearances on the track. After not racing for almost one year, he qualified for 2003 World Championships in Paris, France, but had the misfortune of encountering the eventual World Champion, Kim Collins, as well as Greene and Chambers (1999 World Championship 100 m bronze medallist) in the quarterfinals. Thompson&#x27;s 10.14 sec. fourth-place clocking became the then-fastest performance not to make a 100 m semifinal.

Thompson raced sparingly and unremarkably in 2004, and just weeks before the 2004 Athens Olympics his participation was doubtful due to various injuries. However, he once more defied the odds when he reached and placed seventh in the 100 m finals in 10.10 sec., despite his injuries and not competing for six weeks entering the Games.

In 2005, Thompson returned to competing in the 200 m outdoors for the first time since the 2000 Sydney Olympic finals five years earlier. He placed fourth at the CAC Championships in Nassau, Bahamas in a season-best 20.53 sec. behind the 19-year-old emerging sprint sensation, Usain Bolt, who won in 20.03 sec.

In 2008, Thompson sustained another hamstring injury during the Barbados Olympic trials that ended his hopes of participating in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In April 2009, he retired from athletics by winning his final race, a 200 m at a college invitational race in Austin, Texas.

==Personal life==

Thompson was born in St. Michael to Professor Alvin O. Thompson, a Guyanese professor emeritus of African and Caribbean history at the University of the West Indies (UWI) Cave Hill, Barbados, and Hilda Thompson, a registered nurse from Bermuda. Although Prof. Thompson never earned an athletic scholarship nor had formal coaching, he won the 100 m at the 1963 Jamaica National Championships, while studying at UWI in Mona, Jamaica. In 1966, as a postgraduate student at the University of London, he won the 100 m at British Universities Championships, earned the Arthur Wint Award for the most significant performance at the London University&#x27;s Athletic Championships, and was awarded the prestigious University of London&#x27;s &quot;Purple&quot; for his sporting excellence.

In February 2007, Thompson married former American sprinter and basketball player, Marion Jones. They have three children.

== Recognition in Barbados ==

In 1995, Barbadian soca band, Krosfyah, released the song &quot;Obadele&quot;&quot;praising &quot;Thompson&#x27;s outstanding achievements. Lead singer, Edwin Yearwood, won the 1995 Pic-O-De-Crop Calypso Monarch singing this tune, which became highly popular throughout in the Caribbean region and with the Caribbean diaspora.

On his return to Barbados after his Olympic medal-winning performance, Thompson was greeted by thousands of well-wishers who lined the streets as his motorcade travelled from the airport to the Barbados Government headquarters, where the former Prime Minister, Owen Arthur, conferred on him the title of Ambassador and Special Envoy for Youth. Thompson was awarded the country&#x27;s fourth highest award, the Barbados Service Star Award, for his outstanding contribution to sports (1997), the Barbados Minister&#x27;s Award for Sports (2004), and was three times named the Barbados National Sports Personality of the year (1994, 1996, and 2000).

Thompson has been involved with the Barbados Special Olympics and featured in an advertising campaign against drug abuse for the United Nations Drug Control Programme. He also filmed a television commercial for UNICEF&#x27;s &quot;The Rights of Children&quot; to draw attention to the treatment and rights of children. An asthmatic since three years old, Thompson participated in the 2001 World Asthma Day and filmed a television commercial based on his experience as a lifelong asthmatic.
