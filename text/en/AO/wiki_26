<text>Galvanism is a term invented by the late 18th-century physicist and chemist Alessandro Volta to refer to the generation of electric current by chemical action. The term also came to refer to the discoveries of its namesake, Luigi Galvani, specifically the generation of electric current within biological organisms and the contraction/convulsion of biological muscle tissue upon contact with electric current. While Volta theorized and later demonstrated the phenomenon of his &quot;Galvanism&quot; to be replicable with otherwise inert materials, Galvani thought his discovery to be a confirmation of the existence of &quot;animal electricity,&quot; a vital force which gave life to organic matter.

==History==

=== Johann Georg Sulzer ===

Galvanic phenomena were described in the literature before it was understood that they were of an electrical nature. In 1752, when the Swiss mathematician and physicist Johann Georg Sulzer placed his tongue between a piece of lead and a piece of silver, joined at their edges, he perceived a taste similar to that of iron(II) sulfate. Neither of the metals alone produced this taste. He realized that the contact between the metals probably did not produce a solution of either on the tongue. He did, however, not realize that this was an electrical phenomenon. He concluded that the contact between the metals caused their particles to vibrate, producing this taste by stimulating the nerves of the tongue.
=== Luigi Galvani ===

According to popular legend, Galvani discovered the effects of electricity on muscle tissue when investigating an unrelated phenomenon which required skinned frogs in the 1780s and 1790s. His assistant is claimed to have accidentally touched a scalpel to the sciatic nerve of the frog and this resulted in a spark and animation of its legs. This was building on the theories of Giovanni Battista Beccaria, Felice Fontana, Leopoldo Marco Antonio Caldani, and . Galvani was investigating the effects of distant atmospheric electricity (lightning) on prepared frog legs when he discovered the legs convulsed not only when lightning struck but also when he pressed the brass hooks attached to the frog&#x27;s spinal cord to the iron railing they were suspended from. In his laboratory, Galvani later discovered that he could replicate this phenomenon by touching metal electrodes of brass connected to the frog&#x27;s spinal cord to an iron plate. He concluded that this was proof of &quot;animal electricity,&quot; the electric power which animated living things.

=== Alessandro Volta ===

Alessandro Volta, a contemporary physicist, believed that the effect was explicable not by any vital force but rather it was the presence of two different metals that was generating the electricity. Volta demonstrated his theory by creating the first chemical electric battery. Despite their differences in opinion, Volta named the phenomenon of the chemical generation of electricity &quot;Galvanism&quot; after Galvani.

=== Galvani publishes his work ===
On March 27, 1791, Galvani published a book about his work on animal electricity. It contained comprehensive details of his 11 years of research and experimentation on the topic.

The 1797 edition of &quot;Gren’s Grundriss der Naturlehre&quot; provides the first explicit definition of &#x27;galvanism&#x27; as clearly reflecting Volta’s opinion in the following terms: 
Galvani from Bologna was the first to observe muscular motions elicited by the contact between two different metals; after him, the phenomena of this sort were termed and included under the name of Galvanism.

=== Giovanni Aldini ===
Giovanni Aldini, Galvani&#x27;s nephew, continued his uncle&#x27;s work after Luigi Galvani died in 1798. In 1803, Aldini performed a famous public demonstration of the electro-stimulation technique of deceased limbs on the corpse of an executed criminal George Foster at Newgate in London. The Newgate Calendar describes what happened when the galvanic process was used on the body:

Galvani has been called the father of electrophysiology. The debate between Galvani and Volta &quot;would result in the creation of electrophysiology, electromagnetism, electrochemistry and the electric battery.&quot;

==Scientific and intellectual legacy==

===Literature===

Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, wherein a man stitches together a human body from corpses and brings it to life, was inspired in part by the theory and demonstrations of Galvanism which may have been conducted by James Lind. Although the Creature was described in later works as a composite of whole body parts grafted together from cadavers and reanimated by the use of electricity, this description is not consistent with Shelley&#x27;s work; both the use of electricity and the cobbled-together image of Frankenstein&#x27;s monster were more the result of James Whale&#x27;s popular 1931 film adaptation of the story.

===Abiogenesis===
Galvanism influenced metaphysical thought in the domain of abiogenesis, the underlying process of the generation of living forms. In 1836, Andrew Crosse recorded what he referred to as &quot;the perfect insect, standing erect on a few bristles which formed its tail,&quot; as having appeared during an experiment wherein he used electricity to produce mineral crystals. While Crosse himself never claimed to have generated the insects, even in private, the scientific world at the time viewed the connection between life and electricity to be sufficiently clear that he received threats against his life for this &quot;blasphemy.&quot;

===Medicine===
Giovanni Aldini is claimed to have applied Galvanic principles (application of electricity to biological organisms) in successfully alleviating the symptoms of &quot;several cases of insanity&quot;, and with &quot;complete success&quot;. Today, electroconvulsive therapy is used as a treatment option for severely depressed pregnant mothers (as it is the least harmful for the developing fetus) and people suffering treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. It is found to be effective for half of those who receive treatment while the other half may relapse within 12 months.

The modern application of electricity to the human body for medical diagnostics and treatments is practiced under the term electrophysiology. This includes the monitoring of the electric activity of the heart, muscles, and even the brain, respectively termed electrocardiography, electromyography, and electrocorticography.

<doc id="88344" wikidata="Q1589" url="?curid=88344" title="Luigi Galvani">
<text>Luigi Galvani (, ; ; ; 9 September 1737 – 4 December 1798) was an Italian physician, physicist, biologist and philosopher who studied animal electricity. In 1780, using a frog, he discovered that the muscles of dead frogs&#x27; legs twitched when struck by an electrical spark. This was an early study of bioelectricity, following experiments by John Walsh and Hugh Williamson.

== Early life ==
Luigi Galvani was born to Domenico Galvani and Barbara Caterina Foschi, in Bologna, then part of the Papal States. The house in which he was born may still be seen on Via Marconi, 25, in the center of Bologna. Domenico was a goldsmith. His family had produced several illustrious men.

Galvani then began taking an interest in the field of &quot;medical electricity&quot;. This field emerged in the middle of the 18th century, following electrical researches and the discovery of the effects of electricity on the human body by scientists including Bertrand Bajon and in the 1760s, and by John Walsh and Hugh Williamson in the 1770s.

==Galvani vs. Volta==


Alessandro Volta, a professor of experimental physics in the University of Pavia, was among the first scientists who repeated and checked Galvani’s experiments. At first, he embraced animal electricity. However, he started to doubt that the conductions were caused by specific electricity intrinsic to the animal&#x27;s legs or other body parts. Volta believed that the contractions depended on the metal cable Galvani used to connect the nerves and muscles in his experiments.

Every cell has a cell potential; biological electricity has the same chemical underpinnings as the current between electrochemical cells, and thus can be duplicated outside the body. Volta&#x27;s intuition was correct. Volta, essentially, objected to Galvani’s conclusions about &quot;animal electric fluid&quot;, but the two scientists disagreed respectfully and Volta coined the term &quot;Galvanism&quot; for a direct current of electricity produced by chemical action.

Since Galvani was reluctant to intervene in the controversy with Volta, he trusted his nephew, Giovanni Aldini, to act as the main defender of the theory of animal electricity.

==Death==
Galvani actively investigated animal electricity until the end of his life. The Cisalpine Republic, a French client state founded in 1797 after the French occupation of Northern Italy, required every university professor to swear loyalty to the new authority. Galvani, who disagreed with the social and political confusion, refused to swear loyalty, along with other colleagues. This led to the new authority depriving him of all his academic and public positions, which took every financial support away. Galvani died peacefully surrounded by his mother and father, in his brother’s house depressed and in poverty, on 4 December 1798.

==Legacy==
Galvani&#x27;s legacy includes:
* Galvani&#x27;s report of his investigations were mentioned specifically by Mary Shelley as part of the summer reading list leading up to an ad hoc ghost story contest on a rainy day in Switzerland—and the resultant novel&quot; Frankenstein&quot;—and its reanimated construct. In &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, Victor studies the principles of galvanism but it is not mentioned in reference to the creation of the Monster.
* Galvani&#x27;s name also survives in everyday language as the verb &#x27;galvanize&#x27; as well as in more specialized terms: Galvani potential, galvanic anode, galvanic bath, galvanic cell, galvanic corrosion, galvanic couple, galvanic current, galvanic isolation, galvanic series, galvanic skin response, galvanism, galvanization, hot-dip galvanization, galvanometer, Galvalume, and psycho-galvanic reflex.

Galvani, according to William Fox, was &quot;by nature courageous and religious.&quot; Jean-Louis-Marc Alibert said of Galvani that he never ended his lessons “without exhorting his hearers and leading them back to the idea of that eternal Providence, which develops, conserves, and circulates life among so many diverse beings.”

<doc id="88349" wikidata="Q168976" url="?curid=88349" title="Eastern imperial eagle">
<text>The eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca) is a large bird of prey that breeds in southeastern Europe and extensively through West and Central Asia. Most populations are migratory and winter in northeastern Africa, the Middle East and South and East Asia. Like all eagles, the eastern imperial eagle is a member of the family Accipitridae. Furthermore, its feathered legs mark it as a member of the subfamily Aquilinae. It is a large, dark-colored eagle, with a resemblance to other members of the genus &quot;Aquila&quot;, but it is usually the darkest species in its range. It is an opportunistic predator that mostly selects smallish mammals as prey but also a fairly large proportion of birds, reptile and other prey types, including carrion. Compared to other &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles, it has a strong preference for the interface of tall woods with plains and other open, relatively flat habitats, including the wooded mosaics of the steppe. Normally, nests are located in large, mature trees and the parents raise around one or two fledglings. The global population is small and declining due to persecution, loss of habitat and prey. It has therefore been IUCN Red Listed as Vulnerable since 1994.

==Taxonomy==
The eastern imperial eagle is a member of the Aquilinae or booted eagles, a rather monophyletic subfamily of the accipitrid family. At least 38 species are currently housed in the subfamily, all with signature well-feathered tarsi. This species is a member of the genus &quot;Aquila&quot;, which are mostly large, fairly dark colored eagles distributed largely through the more open habitats of Eurasia and Africa (with one in North America and a couple in Australasia). Studies on DNA have indicated that the imperial eagle is part of a subgroup with other moderately sized &quot;Aquila&quot; such as the steppe eagle (&quot;Aquila nipalensis&quot;) and the tawny eagle (&quot;Aquila rapax&quot;). Despite the outward resemblance to the imperial eagle, the 4 species in the golden eagle subgroup appear to be rather more closely related to the dissimilarly smallish and pale-bellied sister species, African hawk eagle (&quot;Aquila spilogaster&quot;) and Bonelli&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Aquila fasicata&quot;). The Spanish imperial eagle, which is found in Spain and Portugal, was formerly lumped with this species, the name imperial eagle having been previously used in both circumstances. However, the two are now regarded as separate species due to significant differences in morphology, ecology and molecular characteristics. It is likely that the eastern imperial eagle is the paraspecies for the Spanish imperial eagle and that the imperial eagle complex reached the Iberian peninsula sometimes between the late Pleistocene era and early Holocene. The Spanish imperial eagle may be considered an ice age relict due to its isolation.

==Description==

The eastern imperial eagle is a large eagle, but usually falls near the average size of the large-bodied genus &quot;Aquila&quot;. Adult total length can range from with a typical wingspan of . The average wingspan of a small sample showed males to average while a small sample of females averaged . Although otherwise outwardly similar, the species displays reverse sexual dimorphism as do most birds of prey, in which males are usually smaller than the females. For the eastern imperial eagle, females are up to 10% larger linearly and 40% heavier in body mass in some cases. In terms of body mass, one survey found five males to weigh from and five females to weigh from . The average weight of this sample of imperial eagles was reportedly in the males and in the females. A sample of unknown size showed males to weigh an average while females reportedly weighed an average of . A further two mature females weighed an average of . Among standard measurements, males may range in wing chord length from , in tail length from and in tarsus length from . Meanwhile, females may range in wing chord length from , in tail length from and in tarsus length from . A sample of imperial eagles ranged in total bill length from .

In general, compared to other species in their taxonomic group, the eastern imperial eagle has a relatively long and thick neck, a big head and bill (with a gape line level with middle of eye), a longish square tipped tail, somewhat long and well-feathered legs and strong feet. The species tends to perch in a fairly upright position often on rather exposed tree branch or low mound, rock, haystack or similar convenient site. For an &quot;Aquila&quot; eagle, it is seemingly relatively less shy and bolder in the presence of humans. The adult plumage is largely a tar-like blackish-brown but for a well-demarcated and highly contrasting creamy to golden buff colour about the crown, hindneck and neck sides. Furthermore, adults have bold white ”epaulettes” on their shoulder braces, which are usually fairly conspicuous on perched birds. The adult&#x27;s tail is narrowly dark barred over a greyish ground colour and has a broad black subterminal band, while a white tail tip sometimes manifest in adults that are freshly molted. The undertail coverts are sometimes indistinctly paler, rust to creamy, combined with grey tail base to give the appearance of a paler rear end. At rest, the wing tips tend to reach the tail tip. The juvenile eastern imperial eagle is mostly pale tawny-buff to sandy yellow with fairly heavy dark brown streaks from the throat down to the breast, mantle, scapulars and forewing coverts. The juvenile&#x27;s scapulars and forewing coverts also have sometimes noticeable white tipped feathers while the median coverts are perceptibly browner and greater coverts blackish both with broad creamy-yellow tips forming clear wing bars. The flight feathers and tail on juveniles are often blackish and tipped whitish, however the white parts on the lower back to tail coverts are only lightly streaked in the centre and often not visible when perched. Below the streaked breast, the remainder of the juvenile&#x27;s underparts are plain pale buff. By the 2nd year, the brown streaking on the underside fades to a plainer sandy hue and the pale bars also start to fade on wings. Especially later into the 2nd year into the 3rd year, some young eastern imperial-eagles show an erratic blotching of blackish-brown feathers below. By about the 4th winter, as the birds enter their subadult plumage, the forefront of the eagle is often a rather patchy mix of sandy and darker adult-like feathers. During slow annual molts, the dark feathers expand initially from the throat and upper breast outward. Late into the subadult stage, the birds also start to develop a pale crown and nape but usually the rear body still more juvenile-like, such as the pale rump-band and crissum despite the otherwise darkening tail and wing feathers. The full adult plumage is attained at 5–6 years of age but some subadults are already breeding before this.

In flight, the eastern imperial eagle is a large raptor that has for an &quot;Aquila&quot; a very projecting neck and &quot;huge&quot; head and bill. The long wings may appear fairly broad when compared to other, smaller raptors, but are relatively narrow with even parallel edges when compared to other &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles. Their flight style is relatively heavy but steady with deep powerful beats but they are not uncommonly clumsy at first takeoff. They tend to soar with forward pressed but rather flat wings, the outer wing feathers may sometimes curve up but as a rule they do not fly with a V as do some other &quot;Aquila&quot;. The species may also hold their wings flat while engaging in a glide but as it accelerates they may arch wings back. In flight, the adult from above shows dark brown with small white braces, greyish tail with fine dark bars and a very broad, blackish subterminal band. The adult is essentially all dark colored when seen from below relieved only by some very dusky grey flight feathers on the primaries (against the black wing tips), a grey crissum and thinly barred grey tail base. However, these features may be only obvious in good light and at reasonable distances. In flight, the juvenile is largely pale buff with brown streaking. The lower back, rump, tail coverts and leg feathers are all whitish cream in colour which contrasts noticeably with their white-tipped blackish greater coverts, primary coverts and quills. On their mantle, juveniles manifest two white wing bars above and a narrow whitish lower trailing edge. Meanwhile, the juvenile&#x27;s inner primaries are much paler creamy-buff hue than their other flight feathers. The dusky brown wing linings of the juvenile plumage, when compared to the darker ones of adults, show more extensive coarse patterning. Some birds by 2nd to 3rd year are so worn in their flight feathers as to appear almost unstreaked sandy while, from the 3rd year on, darker feathers start to appear below with various untidy variations.

===Confusion of species===

The eastern imperial eagle is typically smaller, being more slender and less bulky and powerful in appearance despite its proportionately larger head and longer neck, than the golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;). In some parts of the range, the female imperial eagle probably averages similar size and body mass to the smaller male golden eagle. However, apparently the species can be reliably distinguished by the size of its hallux claw (the enlarged rear talon that accipitrids used as a killing apparatus) which is consistently larger in the golden species. Two female eastern imperial eagles measured in hallux claw length while a male was about , whereas the smallest talon measured for an immature male American golden eagle was . Nonetheless, besides its wider ranging golden cousin, this species is typically the largest, with the largest extremities (i.e. tarsal, tail and bill length) and most powerful booted eagle species in the majority of its range (apart from its rare African winter range) when compared to similar eagles such as others in the genera &quot;Aquila&quot; and &quot;Clanga&quot;. In their winter quarters in South Asia, this species rivals a fish eagle as the largest and most dominant eagle species. Usually, the plumage of the adult eastern imperial eagle is very distinctive. It is considerably darker than other adult &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles in central Eurasia. Furthermore, all other Eurasian eagles in their range lack the white spots on the wing mantle and greyish under-tail. Given reasonable views, the juvenile imperial eagle is no less distinctive, with its unique tawny-buff covered in brownish streaking, a colour combination not seen in other species. From a distance, the juvenile may give the impression of a dark mantle and chest band with very pale rear body and a blackish tail and remiges against strikingly pale primary wedges. Adults do however strongly resemble their considerably extralimital cousins, the Spanish imperial eagle, but the eastern species has more restricted white on the shoulder and has a slightly more brownish hue in the dark underside feathers, while juvenile Spanish imperials are richly tawny in colour rather than pale buffy and lack brownish streaking on the body. The Spanish species is similar in size and proportions to the eastern imperial but is marginally heavier on average and has an even more protruding head and neck.

The subadult eastern imperial eagle may be confused with older immature greater spotted eagles (&quot;Clanga clanga&quot;) but the latter is less contrastingly patterned, without a paler shawl and has greater covert band below (despite the rare hint of one on some imperials) and densely bared flight feathers. Adult greater spotted eagles have similar underwing contrast as juvenile eastern imperial eagles but, beyond plumage characteristics, are distinct for their much smaller head, slightly smaller overall size and more compact frame with a relatively broader and shorter wings. More similar to the juvenile eastern imperial eagle is the &quot;fulvescens&quot; morph of the greater spotted eagle which is fairly rare (more so in the west) but is similarly or even as pale buffy. However this spotted eagle morph lacks the brownish streaks below of the juvenile imperial and further has contrasting much darker feathering on the wing coverts (heavily spotted in juvenile greater spotteds) and mantle as well as sometimes the facial feathers, and can further be distinguished by the same aforementioned differences in form. Indian spotted eagles (&quot;Clanga hastata&quot;) tend to show paler lesser under-wing coverts like juvenile eastern imperial eagles but are considerably smaller and differ in all other proportions and plumage features. Although at times described as “very similar”, the eastern imperial eagles are fairly easily told from the golden eagle by being much darker with less broad wings that are held much flatter. The golden eagle, unlike imperial eagles, tends to fly with its wings pointed upwards and have a gradual tapering wing shape (somewhat narrower at the base, broader at the primaries). In golden eagles, the tail generally appears narrower and squarer in shape. At closer range, the pale area on the back of the head and neck in eastern imperial eagle may be suggestive to some of the golden eagle&#x27;s golden nape but is always much paler and chalkier in colour, as well as more strongly contrasted by the otherwise dark feathers and is more extensive. Against the somewhat similarly sized but more compact juvenile steppe eagle (&quot;Aquila nipalensis&quot;), the juvenile eastern imperial eagle does not show a white band on underwing like the steppe. More obviously, the steppe eagle lacks the paler overall colours and contrasting brownish streaking of juvenile imperials. Feather wear can make the wing shape of the two resemble the other but the larger head and less compact frame of the imperial species render its flight profile distinctive. The only darker large booted eagle encountered by the eastern imperial eagle, in its African winter quarters, is the jet-black Verreaux&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Aquila verreauxii&quot;) which is more suggestive in size and proportions of the golden eagle. An unlikely source of confusion, the Verreaux&#x27;s differs in almost all plumage characteristics and has far more tapered wings that pinch in at the base and, like the golden eagle, tends to fly in a fairly strong dihedral. In Asia, its proportions and size may be suggestive of the perhaps even rarer Pallas&#x27;s fish eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucoryphus&quot;) and the two can potentially be mistaken in strongly backlit conditions which obscure their obviously distinct plumages. The large headed and flat winged shape of the imperial eagle may too suggest in silhouette the white-tailed eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus albicilla&quot;) but that species is usually rather larger bodied and even larger headed with much broader wings and a proportionately shorter tail. Cinereous vulture (&quot;Aegypius monachus&quot;), being similarly dusky overall below, have been suggested as confusion species, but are much larger than imperial eagles with differing proportions (far broader wings, proportionately smaller head and shorter tail) and lack any of the contrasting pale parts of the imperial eagle&#x27;s plumage.

===Vocalizations===

The eastern imperial eagle is quite vocal on their breeding ground but tends to be silent or nearly so elsewhere. The main call of the species is a deep, harsh bark &quot;owk owk&quot;, &quot;gok gok&quot; or &quot;kraw-kraw&quot;. The call tends to be repeated rapidly up to 8-10 times. Their call is perceptibly deeper and harsher than that of the golden eagle, somewhat incongruously also being more resonant and commanding. Sometimes when extending to a prolonged version, its call is sometimes considered reminiscent of the croak of a large frog. The eastern imperial eagle most frequently calls during their aerial displays. In extreme cases, the call may be repeated up to 13 times during an aerial display. Furthermore, they may repeat the call from a perch. Females may also call when a male arrives with prey. Alarm calls recorded for the species include a soft &quot;ko-gok, wk wk wk&quot;, uttered in response to a distant intruder, a closer approach also may cause a harder &quot;gek&quot; call by the mother. A rising and falling trill has been additionally recorded in captivity is also probably an alarm call.

==Distribution and habitat==

===Breeding range===

The eastern imperial eagle is found as far west as east-central and southeastern Europe. The European part of its breeding range includes eastern Austria, eastern Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, eastern Croatia, Serbia, northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova and northern, western and much of the eastern part of Ukraine. The species distribution continues across central Russia, where it is found through most of the Central Federal District, essentially all of the North Caucasian Federal District, most of the Volga and Ural Federal Districts (excluding the northern parts), and the southern part of Siberia past Lake Baikal to the Transbaikalia in the landlocked southwest of the Russian Far East. Out of Russia, their breeding extends south to mostly the northern portions of the following nations: Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, much of Kazakhstan, northwestern China (Xinjiang) and northern Mongolia. Isolated populations also persist in northwestern, central and eastern Turkey, Cyprus, and northern Iran. As a breeding species, they are probably extirpated from Afghanistan and Pakistan.

===Migration and wintering range===

Unlike the Spanish imperial eagle, the eastern imperial eagle is fairly strongly migratory in most of its range, though a variable amount of residency or very local wandering during winter in the western and southern parts of its range may lend it to be described as a partial migrant. The species has been recorded overwintering as far north as Mongolia. In Bulgaria, of three-post dispersal juveniles, two remained within the country and only one migrated a long distance to Israel. Migratory movements occur during fall any time from September to November and in spring anytime from February to May, shifting earlier in the fall and later in spring the farther north that the eagles breed. Differentiating the large areas used merely for passage migration or vagrancy from regular wintering grounds can be difficult. Though typically seen in very small numbers at main raptor migration sites, the species may occur as a passage migrant through much of the Middle East down to Yemen, with pockets of wintering eagles in Israel, northern Jordan, central Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, northeastern Iraq and adjacent southwestern Iran. A radio-tagging study of a few wintering eagles in Arabia found they returned variously to Russia in four cases and Kazakhstan and China in a single case, with a range of ground covered in spring migration of . The eastern imperial eagle winters locally and in quite small numbers in Africa&#x27;s Nile valley, mostly being reported in southern Sudan, central Ethiopia and northern Kenya, irregularly down as far as southern Kenya and once even in northern Tanzania. Most migrants to Africa apparently originate in the western part of the breeding range such as Europe. Further east, such as the imperial eagles that breed around Lake Baikal, will generally migrate to south Asia. Moderate to quite low numbers of this species are usually noted at migration sites in the Himalayas. The eastern imperial eagle winters fairly broadly in the Indian subcontinent, from eastern Pakistan, eastward through southern Nepal to Bangladesh and down as far south in India as the states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and northwestern Jharkhand. Other semi-regular wintering areas include southern Bhutan, Thailand and north Indochina (recorded across Chinese border in southwestern Yunnan) and spottily in east China where wildlands still occur. Occasionally, wintering birds are doing in central Cambodia and discontinuously in Laos and Vietnam, as well as in the Korean peninsula, Taiwan and southern Japan (mostly Honshu). Vagrants have been reported in over 20 countries, mainly in Europe, including Poland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Italy.

===Habitat===

The eastern imperial eagle is distributed as a breeding species largely along the southern edge of the vast taiga forests. The habitat preferred by the species is often rather open country with scattered trees or more enclosed woodlands, as well as around or near wetlands. The imperial eagle often forages mainly in open areas, extending to beyond typical assorted grasslands to wetlands and agricultural areas. In more extensive wooded areas, eastern imperial eagles require glades or meadows in order to executive hunting. The central part of their range as a breeding species occurs in vast areas of steppe and here the species often inhabits forest-steppe mosaics, as well as open woodlands, river valleys and even agricultural areas with trees or wooded patches. Lowland areas tend to be preferred, albeit not exclusively. In Turkestan and Kazakhstan, they may extend their breeding habitat into semi-desert. True desert is used during winter so long as foods are available. Largely where golden eagles are absent, the species has been reported to range into secondary habitats such as forested lower mountains and montane steppe and meadowland. In Europe at least, this is due to human pressures, which caused them to abandon open lowlands, timbered plains and river-fringed forests for forested, precipitous uplands. A slow repopulation of their preferred lowlands reported since the 1990s in Slovakia and Hungary. Often, eastern imperial eagles winter in more open habitats such as nearly continuous grassland, plains, semi-desert and cultivation with scattered trees as well as various marshes, lakes and other wetlands. The species resides mainly from sea level to , locally to , and has been recorded on passage at in Asia.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The eastern imperial eagle is somewhat varied in hunting techniques but almost exclusively takes its prey on the ground. It is possible some prey, such as fledgling birds, are taken from low perches in ambushes but this is seemingly unverified. They are also known to capture prey in water or from the edge of waterways and may even become waterlogged, especially when capturing water birds. Imperial eagles typically still hunt, watching for prey at length from a moderately low perch (usually a tree branch but virtually any perch from rocks to bushes to power poles), then often making a short stoop or dive to the ground once prey is spotted. Alternately, they may make a longer dive onto prey from a low soaring flight, often using any vegetation available to obscure their approach. Some prey are known to be captured on foot, including insects and ground squirrels, the latter reportedly by waiting by the entrance of the animal&#x27;s burrow. Occasionally, this species pirates foods from other eagles and other birds of prey, especially during winter, and also tandem hunts in pairs as well. The eastern Imperial eagle is, like most active predators, an opportunist who exploits any prey they are capable of overpowering. Their prey spectrum is highly varied, including somewhere between 200 and 300 prey species, a total number of prey species only a bit short of the occasionally sympatric common buzzard (&quot;Buteo buteo&quot;) which may be 500 times more numerous overall. In the nations of Kazakhstan and Hungary alone, the total recorded prey spectrum is 154 and 126 species, respectively. Small to medium-sized mammals are the most regularly selected prey, with a preference for hares, various rodents, especially ground squirrels, hamsters and voles, as well as insectivores. Furthermore, various birds are taken, at times as much as or more so than mammals, especially the young or fledglings of various medium-sized to larger birds. Birds may locally become the primary foods in some parts of the winter range. Reptiles are taken secondarily in most of the range but can be locally somewhat important and fish and invertebrates, including insects, may be taken rarely.

The prey type historically most often associated with the eastern imperial eagle, at least in Europe, has been ground squirrels and hamsters. While these are significant, the primary prey type can vary and often hares or hedgehogs appear to take the primary position in recent studies. The largest European dietary study to date, a multi-year analysis from Hungary, showed that European hare (&quot;Lepus europaeus&quot;) were the primary foods, making up 27.4% of a total of 8,543 prey items. The second best represented prey in Hungary was the European hamster (&quot;Cricetus cricetus&quot;), at 12.71% of the diet. Similarly, in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, the European hare was the main prey, comprising 40.2% of 562 prey items and 41.3% of 109 prey items, respectively. The European hamster was the 4th most frequent prey in Slovakia but second most common prey species in the Czech Republic. As presented in the multi-year studies from Hungary, a seeming decline of the European ground squirrel (&quot;Spermophilus citellus&quot;) population is the cause of their reduced importance in the imperial eagle&#x27;s diet, with this species being the primary prey in 1975-1991 (51% of 606 prey items from 1975 to 1985) to contributing almost nothing in 2005-2017. It is possible with reintroductions of the European ground squirrel underway in central Europe, that this prey species may again become more significant in the eastern imperial eagle&#x27;s diet again here. In Tyva Republic, the long-tailed ground squirrel (&quot;Spermophilus undulatus&quot;) still dominates the food of imperial eagles, making up 60.1% of 168 prey items. In studies of two different areas of Bulgaria, one showed European hares as the main prey (25%) in the Dervent heights and southern white-breasted hedgehog (&quot;Erinaceus concolor&quot;) (32.5%) in the other, Saker mountain. In East Thrace, Turkey, the same hedgehog was the most important prey, comprising 23.1% of 582 prey items and 21.2% of the prey biomass. 

In warmer, southerly areas, the primary prey species seem to generally be smaller. In Georgia, social voles (&quot;Microtus socialis&quot;) were the primary food, comprising about 15% of 341 prey items. For wintering imperial eagles, the most frequent live prey (though carrion was mainly eaten) was Sundevall&#x27;s jird (&quot;Meriones crassus&quot;). Both of these small rodents probably average only about in body mass. Numerous other small mammals may also be occasionally taken including several species each of hedgehogs, shrews and moles, beyond the common hare, at least 7 other species of lagomorphs, about a dozen species each of murid rodents and cricetid rodents (especially hamsters and voles), 5 species of zokor and assorted dormice and jerboas. Thus, eastern imperial eagles appear to prefer rodents and similar small mammals that are burrow-dwelling and/or partial to ground dwelling in open grass or fields along wooded edges.

Assorted bird species may factor heavily into the diet of eastern imperial eagles. More than 120 bird species are known to be taken by this eagle. European studies reflect the high importance of common pheasants (&quot;Phasianus colchicus&quot;), in Europe a non-native gamebird (although the imperial eagle also encounters and hunts the species extensively in its native range as well), in their foods. In the aforementioned large Hungarian study, pheasants were the third most frequently taken prey species, making up 12% of the diet. In the Czech Republic, the pheasant ranked third as well. In Slovakia, the pheasant was second only to the hare in frequency, comprising 17.3% of the foods, although exclusively juvenile and hen pheasants (no cocks) were reportedly taken. In Bulgarian studies, the domestic chicken (&quot;Gallus gallus domesticus&quot;) seems to take the place of pheasants in their diet, making up 10.8% and 20.8% at Saker mountain and Dervent heights and second most frequently taken prey at both, respectively. The largest study of the eastern imperial eagle&#x27;s dietary habits known occurred in the vast Naurzum Nature Reserve in Kazakhstan, where 11,079 prey items were reviewed. The prey spectrum was exceptionally diverse here, with no one prey reliably being favored by the imperial eagle pairs, despite an ample colony of yellow ground squirrel (&quot;Spermophilus fulvus&quot;) and russet ground squirrel (&quot;Spermophilus major&quot;) being nearby and at least three other species of eagles with nearby nesting sites presenting possible resource competition. Without presenting the metrics, apparently birds were the highest volume prey for the imperial eagles, especially corvids, namely the rook (&quot;Corvus frugilegus&quot;) and Eurasian magpie (&quot;Pica pica&quot;), numerous species of duck as well as Eurasian kestrels (&quot;Falco tinnunculus&quot;) and little bustards (&quot;Tetrax tetrax&quot;). In East Thrace, Turkey, the second most regularly taken prey species is the yellow-legged gull (&quot;Larus michahellis&quot;), which comprised more than 12% of the diet by number and 13.8% of the prey biomass. Additionally in East Thrace, a high volume of white storks (&quot;Ciconia ciconia&quot;) was taken, making up 11.3% of the biomass. In Bulgaria, similar prey were important secondary foods, i.e. Caspian gulls (&quot;Larus cachinnans&quot;) at 9.78% of the diet in the Saker mountain area, while white stork made up 10.42% of the diet at Dervent heights. A study of wintering eastern imperial eagles in the Bharatpur district of India showed that this species was generally more inactive but also more likely to capture its own food (rather than through scavenging or kleptoparasitism) than 4 assorted other eagle species in the area. Like other eagles here, the imperial eagles most often fed on various water birds, mainly the nestlings of late-nesting painted storks (&quot;Ciconia leucocephalus&quot;), black-headed ibis (&quot;Threskiornis melanocephalus&quot;), Oriental darters (&quot;Anhinga melanogaster&quot;) and a couple of species of cormorant. However, the imperial eagle in particularly here took to regularly hunting various adult water birds especially ducks, geese and large rails and had a mean daily food intake (not mean prey size) of . In the Saurashtra region of India, imperial eagles were observed to show a preference for hunting diving water birds, including Eurasian coots (&quot;Fulica atra&quot;) and diving ducks, which they would hunt in a style reminiscent of the white-tailed eagle, forcing them to dive as they circled over the water and capturing them as they came to the water&#x27;s surface to breathe. Numerous pigeons and doves may also be taken fairly often, such as in Slovakia where rock doves (&quot;Columba livia&quot;) were the 3rd most often regular prey at 11.79% of the diet. In general, a picture emerges of the imperial eagle&#x27;s dietary preference for relatively large birds with conspicuous behaviour, relatively slow flight, who can be struck on or near the ground and/or have vulnerable nesting sites or conspicuous young, such as gamebirds, waterfowl, other water birds and corvids.

European studies of the eastern imperial eagle&#x27;s diet rarely reflect prey outside of the main preferred classes of mammals and birds, however studies from somewhat outside Europe show respectable numbers of reptiles may be taken. In Georgia, reptiles amounted to 29.62% of the food, comprised largely either of Caucasian agama (&quot;Paralaudakia caucasia&quot;) or other unidentified smallish lizards. A larger class of reptiles were regular secondary prey in East Thrace in Turkey, namely Greek tortoise (&quot;Testudo graeca&quot;) and Hermann&#x27;s tortoise (&quot;Testudo hermanni&quot;), with tortoises altogether comprising 11.1% of the diet by number and 13.7% of the prey biomass. Tortoises, along with lizards such as spiny-tailed lizards (&quot;Uromastix hardwickii&quot;) and monitor lizards (&quot;Varanus&quot; spp.) can be significant in the diet elsewhere as well, especially in more arid climes. Although snakes do not seem to be typically quantitatively important, eastern imperial eagles have no problem occasionally subduing large snakes, such as Aesculapian snakes (&quot;Zamenis longissimus&quot;), or very aggressive venomous snakes, such as Russell&#x27;s viper (&quot;Daboia russelii&quot;) (the latter taken in their wintering Indian quarters). In Hungary, very small numbers of invertebrates (mostly insects such as ground beetles) and fish were found amongst the foods of imperial eagles. Carrion is eaten through the year by eastern imperial eagles, but most heavily during winter. For example, in the wintering population of Jordan, 53.7% of the dietary intake of the species was made up of carrion. However, in some breeding populations, apparently the eagles can come to rely on dead or already injured prey inadvertently provided by humans, largely due to intensive agricultural practices, as was the case in the Czech Republic. In one area of Slovakia, although imperial eagles also hunted, the adult eagles routinely practiced kleptoparasitism while nesting, regularly robbing other species of raptorial bird of their fresh catches. Almost any mammal or bird will be readily eaten when dead or dying by imperial eagles, with at least 10 species of ungulate known to be consumed thusly and providing an ample source of meat.
The size of prey taken by eastern imperial eagles can be fairly variable. Most live prey taken by eastern imperial eagles weighs less than . According to Watson (2010), the prey of imperial eagles is fairly evenly spread from up to , with a peak focus (at around 25%) on prey weighing and a mean estimated prey size of . The prefferd sized of prey can be slightly varied throughout the region. In Hungary, staple prey size was estimated at between and . By contrast, in Slovakia, maximum weight of live-caught prey was estimated at .

Many of the prey species taken by imperial eagles are relatively large as adults such as European hares and bobak marmots (&quot;Marmota bobac&quot;), which were the second most often taken mammalian prey species in Kazakhstan, but generally, these eagles take juvenile specimens of both hares and marmots rather than prime adults. The suggested weight of European hares and bobak marmots taken in Kazakhstan was estimated at and , in both cases no less than a third of the average adult weight attainable by the species, indicating that most of the marmot and hare are mainly young. However, the eastern imperial eagle is capable of taking large prey as well. In some cases, they are capable of taking large sized marmots and adult European hares. Imperial eagles also known to prey on other species such as mountain hare (&quot;Lepus timidus&quot;) and the Tolai hare (&quot;Lepus tolai&quot;). They have taken adults of numerous larger water birds averaging over the expected prey weight of , although nestlings are most often preyed upon, including greylag goose (&quot;Anser anser&quot;), greater white-fronted goose (&quot;Anser albifrons&quot;), bean goose (&quot;Anser fabalis&quot;), bar-headed goose (&quot;Anser indicus&quot;), knob-billed duck (&quot;Sarkidiornis melanotos&quot;), common crane (&quot;Grus grus&quot;), great cormorant (&quot;Phalacrocorax carbo&quot;), white stork and black stork (&quot;Ciconia nigra&quot;). These avian prey can possibly weigh up to in case of common cranes or large geese. Additionally, it is known that eastern imperial eagles will also prey upon great bustards (&quot;Otis tarda&quot;), though the female is possibly taken as she is about as large as a crane or large goose, it is unlikely that the eagle can take the much larger adult males of this huge ground bird since imperial eagles apparently even avoid adult male birds of much smaller species such as pheasants. Eastern imperial eagles select broadly overlapping prey with mammalian carnivorans but also fairly regularly attack these as prey. Foxes are widely known in the foods of imperial eagles but at times visited as carrion. Red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) and corsac foxes (&quot;Vulpes corsac&quot;) are known to be taken and a predation attempt on Bengal foxes (&quot;Vulpes bengalensis&quot;) has been reported. Beyond small weasels, which are probably no issue for large eagles to attack, larger mustelids may be attacked including European (&quot;Mustela putorius&quot;) and steppe polecats (&quot;Mustela eversmanii&quot;) and stone martens (&quot;Martes foina&quot;). On some occasions, domestic cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;) are sometimes prey for eastern imperial eagles and Pallas&#x27;s cats (&quot;Otocolobus manul&quot;) may too be vulnerable to this eagle. Eastern imperial eagles also attack the young of ungulates at times, reportedly neonatal and mildly older calves and lambs of similar size to the eagles themselves, including species such as argali (&quot;Ovis ammon&quot;), roe deer (&quot;Capreolus capreolus&quot;), Arabian sand gazelle (&quot;Gazella marica&quot;) and goitered gazelle (&quot;Gazella subgutturosa&quot;). In Africa, the Imperial eagle consumes mammals up to as live prey, which is similar in weight to the largest avian kill in Europe. At the opposite end of the scale in vertebrate prey, imperial eagles are known to take mammals down to the size of the Eurasian harvest mouse (&quot;Micromys minutus&quot;) and birds down to the size of the Eurasian tree sparrow (&quot;Passer montanus&quot;). Much smaller invertebrate prey such as locust was taken in Kazakhstan.

===Interspecies predatory relationships===
The eastern imperial eagle is a powerful bird of prey but frequently overlaps in range with multiple other eagle species and that may require them to share both habitats and prey. The golden eagle is generally a larger, more powerful bird. It also tends to be a bolder, more aggressive predator than the imperial eagle and may be able to attack much larger prey. While the mean prey body mass relative to the eagle&#x27;s weight is probably similar between the two species, an estimated 15% of golden eagle prey will weigh over . In its very extensive range, the golden eagle&#x27;s distribution includes nearly all areas occupied by breeding eastern imperial eagles. Furthermore, there is considerable overlap in prey species selected by these species. There is a natural partitioning between the two &quot;Aquila&quot; species and that comes in the form of habitat preferences. The golden eagle takes to, usually but not always, rocky and uneven terrain, so favors mountainous areas with alpine meadows to access for prey. This is quite different from the eastern imperial eagle&#x27;s preference for a flat or somewhat rolling interface between wood stands and fields at low elevations. However, in some areas, especially eastern Europe, eastern imperial eagles have been driven to higher elevations and more montane habitats that are typically the haunts of golden eagles by persecution, habitat destruction, and other interferences by humans, usually with mixed to minor success as the golden species is scarce at best locally and unlikely to produce competition. There is surprisingly little information on conflicts between these two eagle species. In the Naurzum Nature Reserve of Kazakhstan the golden and eastern imperial eagle, and to some extent also both white-tailed eagles and steppe eagles, were recorded nesting with fairly close proximity to each other. The eagle species here would even use nests built by the other species and seemed to have similar or broadly overlapping food habits, but no interspecies conflicts were detected. On the contrary, in the Altai Republic, it appears that golden and eastern imperial eagles are considered to fill a largely similar ecological niche in abutting areas and do compete for nesting sites. In some cases in Europe, golden and eastern imperial eagles will engage in a territorial display if prompted against one another.

Of a similar distribution to eastern imperial eagles, both in their mid-Eurasian breeding ground and southerly Indo-African wintering grounds, are the steppe eagle and the greater spotted eagle. There is a fair amount of habitat partitioning between the three species, however, with the steppe eagle preferring flat, often almost treeless steppe while the greater spotted eagle prefers more densely wooded and wetter habitats generally than imperial eagles such as taiga bogs. Diet however can overlap considerably, especially with steppe eagles as both it and the imperial species are largely attracted to colonies of ground squirrels in Central Asia. While steppe eagles occur much more broadly in Africa during winter and a similarly narrow extent in the Indian subcontinent as eastern imperials, greater spotted eagles are similarly as rare as imperial eagles in Africa but spread farther in Asia than either the steppe or imperial species. In all three species, by winter they are attracted to more open habitats ranging from savanna to wetlands and even semi-desert. The ecology of wintering eastern imperials was studied at length in Bharatpur district of India in contrast to the steppe and greater spotted eagle as well as the resident Indian spotted eagle and shorter-distance migrant Pallas&#x27;s fish eagle. It was found that the feeding opportunities sought were largely similar (nestling water birds were often favored) by all five eagle species and that a hierarchy was formed, though each species competed most regularly with others of their own species. The eastern imperial eagle was, by and large, dominant in correspondence to its slightly larger size than the other booted eagles and rivaled the similarly-sized Pallas&#x27;s fish eagle as the top avian predator in this raptor community. The steppe eagle, despite being only scarcely smaller than an imperial eagle, was usually subordinate to imperial eagles and had a much lower estimated average daily food intake, against an average of for the imperial. However, the mean daily intake of Pallas&#x27;s fish eagle was slightly higher still at and the fish eagle would perch slightly higher than the imperials as well. In one case, a flock of 9 steppe eagles was able to pirate a freshly caught coot from an imperial eagle. The imperial was the most inactive forager here, having spent 36% of observed hours foraging, against 45% for steppe eagles, 46% for Pallas&#x27;s fish eagle, 49% for greater spotted eagle and 65% for Indian spotted eagle. Other studies on the interactions of eastern imperial eagles also support that it is dominant during winter over similar species such as steppe and the spotted eagles at competitive feeding spots. In the Korean peninsula, similarly as in the Indian subcontinent, wintering eastern imperial eagles (though rare) can reportedly be seen more than singly concentrated where there are ample numbers of water birds along with other large eagles. Next to nothing is known about the ecology of the rare, seldom-observed wintering population of eastern imperial eagles in east Africa but it is claimed to usually be seen in the company of “other brown eagles”.

As its preferred habitat seldom overlaps with larger eagles such as golden eagles and white-tailed eagles, the eastern imperial eagle is usually the top avian predator in its breeding grounds. In particular, smaller raptors with largely overlapping diets (i.e. ground squirrels, hamsters, voles &amp; lagomorphs) and habitat preferences such as saker falcons (&quot;Falco cherrug&quot;) and long-legged buzzards (&quot;Buteo rufinus&quot;) are often at a disadvantage in direct competition with the eagle species. In Slovakia, some pairs of imperial eagle were reported to kleptoparasitize other raptors as a matter of routine. Here, four species consisting of saker falcons, western marsh harrier (&quot;Circus aeruginosus&quot;), black-winged kite (&quot;Elanus caeruleus&quot;) and Eurasian sparrowhawk (&quot;Accipiter nisus&quot;) as well as red foxes were all robbed of their catches with a remarkable degree of success by imperial eagles. The eagles so heavily depleted the falcons&#x27; catches that the falcons’ nesting attempts failed. A still swifter falcon than the saker, the peregrine falcon (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;) was observed successfully robbing imperial eagles and a few other raptorial birds several times when the species nested near each other in the lower Sakmara river of Russia (although in one case, a juvenile peregrine was killed by the golden eagle it was attempting to rob). Interestingly, many of the imperial eagle kills that were robbed by the peregrines were other species of bird of prey. In Tatarstan, Russia it was found that eastern imperial eagles have begun nesting in atypical habitats and locations, namely the old nests of white-tailed eagles in isolated trees amongst open wetlands and old nests of a greater spotted eagle in densely wooded bogs. Despite the remaining presence of both other eagle species in the area, competition is probably not the driver for the imperial eagle altering its nesting habits but instead, it is likely due to the heavy human-caused depletion of the imperial eagles preferred prey of ground squirrels and hamsters in the area, with the wetland-located nests putting them close to currently reliable alternate primary foods, mainly water birds.

The eastern imperial eagle may be characterized as an occasional and opportunistic predator of other birds of prey. The following raptorial birds have been known to fall prey this eagle: the lesser spotted eagle (&quot;Clanga pomarina&quot;), European honey buzzard (&quot;Pernis apivorus&quot;), black kite (&quot;Milvus migrans&quot;), hen harrier (&quot;Circus cyaneus&quot;), Montagu&#x27;s harrier (&quot;Circus pygargus&quot;), western marsh harrier, Eurasian sparrowhawk, northern goshawk (&quot;Accipiter gentilis&quot;), common buzzard (&quot;Buteo buteo&quot;), long-legged buzzard, rough-legged buzzard (&quot;Buteo lagopus&quot;), Ural owl (&quot;Strix uralensis&quot;), tawny owl (&quot;Strix alucco&quot;), little owl (&quot;Athene noctua&quot;), long-eared owl (&quot;Asio otus&quot;), short-eared owl (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;), Eurasian hobby (&quot;Falco subbuteo&quot;), common kestrel (&quot;Falco tinnunculus&quot;), lesser kestrel (&quot;Falco naumanni&quot;), merlin (&quot;Falco columbarius&quot;), red-footed falcon (&quot;Falco vespertinus&quot;), saker falcon and peregrine falcon. Although it may be classed properly as an apex predator, eastern imperial eagles have fallen prey to other birds of prey on rare occasions. An instance of predation was reportedly committed by a white-tailed eagle. Furthermore, imperial eagles may be vulnerable at their nest to nighttime ambushes by Eurasian eagle-owls (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;).

==Breeding==

The eastern imperial eagle is a fairly solitary bird, with rarely more than a pair occurring, although some small gatherings recorded at waterholes or food during migrant or winter. Pairs on the breeding grounds engage in aerial displays with loud calling and extensive high circling, which like most of accipitrids is likely for the purposes territorial proclamation to other eagles of their species. The display is often interspersed with mock dives and talon showing. One or both members of a pair may participate in the aerial display. If an interloper does not leave during the first part of the display, the territorial skirmish then may become physical and it sometimes leads to cartwheeling with interlocked talons, falling until they nearly hit the ground. Despite the fairly impressive display, it is generally of slightly shorter duration than the similar one done by golden eagles. In East Thrace, Turkey, the mean nearest nest distance between actively breeding pairs was . In the Irkutsk Oblast near Lake Baikal, the mean distance of the central area of nests (each pair had more than one nest on territory) was . The breeding season lasts from late March to September throughout the range but in their former range in Pakistan (where it is now extirpated as a breeder) was said to extend from November to April. The pair constructs a very large nest of sticks, which may average up to across and in depth. However, nests for the species have been recorded to measure up to or more across and deep. Nests can outmatch in size those even of larger species such as golden eagles. Nests are frequently lined with various materials, including twigs, grass, fur, debris and greenery. Usually eastern imperial eagles build their nest in tall trees but recorded down to as low as in low scrub or, rarely, on cliff or ground (later as recorded in the Sayan Mountains of Kazakhstan). Nest sites have been found anywhere from in the depth of a forest to forest edge to a solitary tree that may be visible for miles in open plains. Nesting sites in both Turkey and Georgia were consistently under elevation. In Georgia, denser mixed forests with openings were favored alternately with more arid, isolated stands of juniper (&quot;Juniperus ssp&quot;.) and pistachio (&quot;Pistacia vera&quot;); in Turkey, poplar (&quot;Populus ssp&quot;.) (44%) and oak (&quot;Quercus ssp&quot;.) (40%) were favored. In extensive Russian studies, 78% of nests were in conifers when compared with Kazakhstan where deciduous trees are more prevalent, however in the latter country conifers are still used where they are found. Unusual nest sites in agricultural land of Slovakia include one next to a railroad and another next to a busy road. The eastern imperial eagle has also been recorded as nesting on electric poles and towers in Russia and Kazakhstan. In several cases they aggressively took over the nests from steppe eagles that were previously nesting on the electric towers. Often one nest is used but sometimes a 2nd or 3rd is constructed by the imperial eagle pair may exist on a home range.

The mother eastern imperial eagle lays 2 to 3 eggs at intervals of 2 or more days. The average clutch size in Georgia was 2.09. In the Czech Republic, the average clutch size was 2.27. 81 nests from Russia had a mean clutch size of 2.1. Exceptional clutch sizes of up to four eggs have been recorded in Kazakhstan. The eggs are a dull buffish white colour overall and are sparsely marked with grey, purplish or, occasionally, brown spots. A sample of 150 eggs were found to have measured from in height by , with an average of . In Georgia, the average dimensions of eggs was measured in a sample of 20 as with a mean weight of . As was recorded in 13 cases in Slovakia, if eggs are lost early into incubation, around March or April, a replacement clutch may be laid, though always the parent eagles used an alternate nest when this occurred. In southeast Europe egg laying peaks at about mid-February to March while in central Asia, it is in first half of April shifting late April further north. The incubation starts with the 1st egg, with males only infrequently taking a shift. The incubation stage lasts for 43 days. In Bulgaria, two females were recorded to do 90.8-94.1% of the incubating. The eaglets hatch at intervals of several days, with one usually being distinctly larger than the rest. However, cases of siblicide are infrequent compared to the golden eagle and, when not interrupted by human interference, prey population crashes and nest collapses, nest frequently bear two fledglings. At 14 days of age, the first feathers through down, while feathers on the back starting at 21 days. Feathers cover the down by 35–40 days but sometimes the down persists about head and neck for up to 45 days. Feathering is complete at 55 days and first flight attempts by 60 days onward. Mostly the female broods the young and male captures prey in this species (as is often the case in booted eagles in which males rarely engage in direct brooding). From when the young are 40 days onward, the female eastern imperial eagle typically resumes hunting and takes to a perch nearby. Male does not appear to bring prey directly to the nest instead to nearby branch for female to dismantle. One or two large prey items last 1–2 days but small prey may require up to 5-6 daily prey deliveries. Fledgling may variously occur at anywhere from 63 to 77 days. After leaving the nest the young linger near it for 2–3 days. Breeding success was once considerable in Russia at about 1.5 young per pair.

===Breeding success and survivorship===

Breeding success is somewhat variable in the eastern imperial eagle. In the Czech Republic the 1-3 pairs found to be nesting in 1998-2009 had an average number of 1.53 fledglings. In the Hungarian population, it was recorded that from fewer than one fledgling per pair that average had increased to 1.15 fledglings per pair in 2001-2009. In 2011 in Bulgaria, with a gradual increase of the population to 20 occupied territories, success rate was shown to be about 1 fledgling per pair. By 2014, productivity was reported as averaging similarly at 1.03 fledgling per pair in Bulgaria. In Austria, the average number of fledglings per successful pair was 1.63. Of 27 breeding Austrian breeding attempts, 22 were successful. In East Thrace, Turkey, the breeding success was estimated at 1.01 fledglings per pair. Pairs living in the Marmara region were more productive than those in the Dervent heights (1.05 vs 0.91). Breeding success in Hungary reportedly was driven largely by the age of the nesting pair, with mature adults more likely to show adaptability to changes in habitat and prey, and secondarily to habitat composition. In particular, nesting success tends to higher in lowland areas against higher elevation nests. Post-dispersal in Bulgaria, the most significant cause of juvenile mortality per radio-tagging studies was shown to be electrocution (59% of the mortalities), followed by poisoning and shooting. The radio-tracking studies of Bulgarian juveniles showed survival rates were 59.1% in the 1st year of life, 83.3% for the 2nd year, 80% for the 3rd year. Furthermore, 50% of the mortalities of the Bulgarian juveniles occurred in Bulgaria while 43% occurred after they&#x27;d migrated to Turkey. Electrocution by collision with power lines are likely major causes of mortality almost throughout the range. Furthermore, other deadly collisions with manmade objects, including automobiles and wind turbines, are also a persistent threat. Like other birds of prey, eastern imperial eagles are occasionally vulnerable to Haematozoa, helminths and viruses as well as maggot infection in a wound by blowflies. Studies to determine if there&#x27;s a skewered sex ratio of offspring for eastern imperial eagles in Kazakhstan and secondarily in Serbia determined that the ratio of males to females was nearly equal and stable. For example pairs in the Naurzum Nature Reserve showed during study to produce 123 males and 116 females from 1998-2004. Further study in Kazakhstan showed that adult survivorship was about 84%, which is somewhat low for long-lived raptor, but nonetheless reproductive rate shown to be sufficient to maintain a stable breeding population. While breeding success in areas such as Naurzum reserve may be successful, in non-pristine habitats of Kazakhstan the breeding population may not necessarily be self-sustaining. In Bulgaria, estimates of adult survivorship were from 75 to 94%. Against the overall stability of Kazakhstani imperial eagles and the gradual increased success of European nesting eagles, a rapidly declining population has been noted with alarm, in nearly at the species’ eastern limits as breeder in Lake Baikal. Here fledgling success has decreased from roughly 71% to about 52%.

==Status==

The eastern imperial eagle has declined greatly through history. At one time, people of eastern Europe and adjacent parts of Russia used to admire and even revere this eagle as a &quot;sacred bird&quot;. It was widely referred to as the &quot;cross-bearing eagle&quot; (because of the shape of the white spots on its wings). According to folklore, the imperial eagle was able to divert the hailstorm clouds from the area it inhabited, and it was thus able to save farmers&#x27; crops. Therefore, the monarchy of Austria-Hungary once chose the imperial eagle to be its heraldic animal. Despite the historic reverence for the species, it was not spared the negative and hostile view of all birds of prey that arose throughout Europe and its colonies in the 17th century onwards, and the resulting persecution of essentially all birds of prey, including the eastern imperial eagle. However, almost certainly the leading cause of this species&#x27; decline was the practice of felling old trees on field boundaries that were the nest sites for the eagle. Among other reasons for its decline were the depletion (both incidental and intentional) of prey species and the incidental consumption by the eagles of poison baits, left out to eliminate wolves. As with other eagles in Eurasia, the Industrial Revolution allowed access to poisons and firearms, which made the killing of eagles far easier and hastened their decline. Towards the end of the 19th century, 1824 nests were recorded in Bulgaria, but by 1979 only 5 to 12 pairs remained in the country. Similarly, from a population once numbering in the thousands, the Hungarian population of imperial eagles was driven down to only 10-15 pairs by 1975-1980. In Greece, the eastern imperial eagle was extirpated altogether as a breeding species. While the declines further east in the species range have been less studied, more or less the same threats likely persist throughout the range. Some reserves in central Russia and Kazakhstan have retained semi-stable populations, due in no small part to their isolation. However, the eastern imperial eagle has also been extirpated as a breeding species from Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Today, dedicated conservationists and biologists are working extensively to remediate and reverse the decline of eastern imperial eagle. The species was uplisted to Vulnerable in 1994 and global protection initiatives were begun around this time. By 1996, it was estimated that there were 363-604 pairs in all of Europe (including European Russia). After a couple of decades of recovery efforts, by 2000-2010, the number of breeding pairs in Europe was estimated at up to 1800-2200, a significant increase. Peak numbers in Europe may fall along the European Green Belt. The strongest increases were in Hungary where from 10-15 pairs in the late 1970s an estimated total of 105 nesting pairs by the late 2000s. Conversions and conservation of lowland wildlands, has allowed the numbers of pairs using less ideal mountainous habitat decrease from 50% to 15% of breeding imperials, as they&#x27;ve shifted to more ideal lowland habitat. The nation&#x27;s imperial eagle population has been continuously protected and monitored since 1975. Further efforts in Hungary were the mitigation of human-eagle conflicts through education in Hungary as poisoning (whether these eagles are the main target or not) continues, as well as general coordination with landowners and agricultural interests as the eastern imperial eagles are often required to forage in such areas. Other increases or returns to former parts of their range include have been noted in the Morava region of southwestern Slovakia as well as some parts of the Czech Republic, Serbia and Austria. However, overall 85% of the population in the Carpathian mountains region that forms the bulk of the land in eastern Europe was restricted to the Great Hungarian Plain, and were isolated from other populations. In Slovakia, the gap in the distribution in the Carpathian basin has led to concern about genetic isolation. Upon review, the genetic isolation of the two Slovakian populations was determined to be &quot;marginally significant&quot;. The number of pairs of eastern imperial eagles increased in Bulgaria from 20 in 2009 to 24 in 2013. Among the efforts untaken to restore the Bulgarian populations were mitigating hazardous electrical poles, 608 were insulated within eagle territories, while also 483 supplemental feedings were given to 14 pairs from October to March. In Turkey, the number of imperial eagle pairs in recent estimates during the 21st century was widely placed at 35-150 pairs, probably closer to the higher number as there is evidence for there being 30-50 pairs in the East Thrace region alone.

In some areas of western Russia and in Kazakhstan, the eastern imperial eagle has maintained the nearest thing to a population stronghold. In 2011, the total estimated number of pairs was estimated at 3000-3500 in Russia and 3500-4000 in Kazakhstan. Though only 1534 breeding territories found firsthand, only some parts of the range were surveyed. According to Russian and Kazakh studies, cattle grazing in taiga forest edge appeared to benefit imperial eagles since they encourage habitat for prey, especially ground squirrels. In Kazakhstan moister conditions, possibly correlated with climate change seems to have increased populations of yellow ground squirrels and 2nd growth trees which both are likely to have caused a localized increase there. In Naurzum Nature Reserve alone nearly 300 imperial eagles may congregate in winter, making it a “critical refugium” for this species. On the other hand, precipitous decline has been detected in the Lake Baikal region of Russia and the species may be on its way to local extinction there. In the 1950s, imperial eagle pairs in the Baikal area numbered 250-300 strong. A strong decline was already noted by the mid-1980s when 150-200 pairs remained. However, the reduction hastened even more to merely 70 pairs in 1999. The Baikal imperial eagles during monitoring from 1950 to 1999 showed no overall changes in habitat or pair occupancy. In the 1998-1999 period, fledgling success was also found to drop considerably. Satellite study of migrating birds from Lake Baikal at migration stopovers and winter sites was reviewed but only 4 eagles were studied so results could not clearly determine whether depletions were mostly occurring at this time rather than during breeding. The reason for the sharp declines of the Baikal imperial eagles are not fully understood but are likely correlated with habitat destruction and human land use changes followed by pesticide use and other toxic threats through bioaccumulation. Reductions have also been reported in the lower Ural Mountains region of Russia with largely similar threats but it is not known what the exact rate of reduction is here. Although gone from Pakistan as a breeding species, it continues to be a key wintering site as around 150 eagles are estimated to winter in Pakistan.

<text>America (Limburgish: &quot;Amerika,&quot; ) is a parish village in the Dutch province of Limburg, known historically for its peat extraction.

==Geography==
America is part of the municipality of Horst aan de Maas in Limburg, and lies approximately northwest of Venlo, east of Helmond, and west of the German border. The town is located within the agricultural Peel region of the Netherlands where peat extraction has been practiced since the Middle Ages. The town is situated approximately above sea level on the Kabroeksebeek, a stream that flows northeasterly to the Groote Molenbeek stream and eventually to the Meuse.

The area of the town is and the population as of 2019 is 2,030.

==History==
America was founded in the late 19th century on the Venlo–Eindhoven railway to serve peat extraction in the area by providing transportation for workers and resources. The town&#x27;s etymology is uncertain, but it is likely the town was named after the Americas. Other villages with similar foreign names in the Peel region, including California and Siberia, were founded in the same era.

The town&#x27;s railway station, America Station, opened in 1866 and was rebuilt in 1894. The parish church for America, Saint Joseph&#x27;s Church, was completed in 1892. The railway station closed in 1938 and the town was captured by the Germans during World War II before being liberated by the British on 22 November 1944. America Station was eventually demolished in 1970, although it has been immortalized by the 1993 album &quot;Station America&quot; by the local band Rowwen Hèze.

In recent years, as peat extraction has declined surrounding America, reclaimed peatlands have been converted as holiday villages and bungalow resorts including Limburgse Peel and Het Meerdal, both operated by Center Parcs Europe.

<doc id="88351" wikidata="Q276010" url="?curid=88351" title="Diane de Poitiers">
<text>Diane de Poitiers (9 January 1500 – 25 April 1566) was a French noblewoman and courtier who wielded much power and influence as King Henry II&#x27;s royal mistress and adviser until his death. Her position increased her wealth and family&#x27;s status. She was a major patron of French Renaissance architecture.

==Early life==
Diane de Poitiers was born on 9 January 1500, in the Château de Saint-Vallier, Drôme, France. Her parents were Jean de Poitiers, Seigneur de Saint Vallier, and Jeanne de Batarnay. She became a keen athlete, and frequently went riding and swimming for exercise.
When still a girl, Diane was briefly in the retinue of Princess Anne de Beaujeu, King Charles VIII&#x27;s eldest sister who skillfully held the regency of France during his minority. Like her fellow charges, Diane was educated according to the principles of Renaissance humanism, including Greek and Latin, rhetoric, etiquette, finance, law, and architecture.

==Grand Seneschal of Normandy==

On 29 March 1515, at the age of 15, Diane was married to Louis de Brézé, seigneur d&#x27;Anet, Count of Maulévrier, and Grand Seneschal of Normandy, who was 39 years her senior. He was a grandson of King Charles VII by his mistress Agnès Sorel and served as a courtier to King Francis I. They had two daughters, Françoise (1518–1574) and
Louise (1521–1577).

Shortly after her marriage, Diane became lady-in-waiting to Queen Claude of France. After the Queen died, she served in the same capacity to Louise of Savoy, the King&#x27;s mother, and then Queen Eleanor of Austria. 
In 1523, her husband uncovered Constable Charles de Bourbon&#x27;s plot against King Francis I, but did not know at the time that his father-in-law was involved as well. In 1524, Jean de Poitiers was accused of treason and sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted. He instead was confined to prison until the Treaty of Madrid in 1526.

After her husband died in 1531 in Anet, Diane adopted the habit of wearing black and white for the rest of her life. They were among the permitted colours of mourning and the symbolic colours of the sides of the moon, playing on her name which derived from the Roman moon goddess. She commissioned sculptor Jean Goujon to build 
a tomb for Louis in the Cathedral of Rouen.

Diane&#x27;s keen interest in financial matters and legal acumen became apparent for the first time during this period. She managed to retain her late husband&#x27;s emoluments as grand seneschal of Normandy and challenged in court the obligation to return the family&#x27;s appanages to the royal domain. Impressed, King Francis I allowed the widowed Diane to manage her inherited estates without the supervision of a male guardian and keep their considerable revenues.

==Royal favourite==

Charles V&#x27;s troops captured Francis during the battle of Pavia (1525), and in 1526 the princes Francis and Henry were sent to Spain as hostages for their father. Because the ransom was not paid, the two boys (eight and seven at the time) spent nearly four years isolated in a bleak castle. The experience may account for the strong impression that Diane made on Henry, as the very embodiment of the ideal gentlewoman: as his mother was already dead, his grandmother&#x27;s lady-in-waiting gave him the farewell kiss when he was sent to Spain. At the tournament held in 1531 for the coronation of Francis&#x27;s new wife, Eleanor of Austria, the Dauphin Francis wore the colors of the new Queen as expected, but Henry wore Diane&#x27;s colors.

In 1533, Henry married Catherine de&#x27; Medici despite opposition to the alliance, since the Medicis were no more than merchant upstarts in the eyes of many in the French court. However, Diane approved of the choice of bride, to whom she was related (Catherine&#x27;s maternal grandfather and Diane&#x27;s paternal grandmother being siblings, making them second cousins). Based on allusions in their correspondence, it is generally believed that Diane became his mistress in 1534, when she was 35 years old and Henry was 15. As the couple remained childless and she became concerned by rumours of a possible repudiation of a royal wife that she had in control, Diane made sure that Henry&#x27;s visits to the marital bedroom would be frequent, to the point that he had ten legitimate children. In another act of self-preservation toward the royal family, Diane helped nurse Catherine back to health when she fell ill.
Despite his occasional affairs with other women, such as Philippa Duci, Janet Fleming, and Nicole de Savigny, Diane remained Henry&#x27;s lifelong companion. For the next 25 years, she was one of the most powerful women in France. When Francis I was still alive, Diane had to compete at the court with his mistress, Anne de Pisseleu d&#x27;Heilly. In 1544, Anne convinced Francis I that Henry (now the Dauphin) and Diane were working to reinstate Constable Montmorency at court. After his father banished Diane, Henry and his supporters retreated to the chateau of Anet; father and son wouldn&#x27;t reconcile until 1545. After Francis&#x27;s death, Henry had Anne banned from court and confiscated her duchy of Étampes. By then, Diane&#x27;s position in the Court was such that when Pope Paul III sent the new Queen the &quot;Golden Rose&quot;, he also presented the royal mistress with a pearl necklace. She received the prestigious title of Duchess of Valentinois in 1548 and was made Duchesse d&#x27;Étampes in 1553. Through the extensive patron-client network she cultivated, her sons-in-law received important positions.

Although she was not openly involved, Diane&#x27;s sharp intellect, confident maturity and loyalty to Henry II made her his most dependable ally in the court. He trusted her to write many of his official letters, which were signed jointly with the one name: &quot;HenriDiane&quot;. Until 1551, she was in charge of the education of Henry&#x27;s children, and gave orders to their governors, Jean and Françoise d&#x27;Humières. Diane also took care of raising Diane of France (1538 - 1619), natural daughter of Henry and Filippa Ducci, whom she treated as if she were her own, to the point that some contemporary chroniclers wrote that Diane was actually the biological mother of the girl. Her daughter Françoise managed the Queen&#x27;s household as &quot;première dame d&#x27;honneur&quot; (chief lady-in-waiting). The King&#x27;s adoration for Diane caused a great deal of jealousy on the part of Queen Catherine, particularly when Henry entrusted Diane with the Crown Jewels of France and gave her the Château de Chenonceau, a piece of royal property that Catherine had wanted for herself. However, as long as the King lived, the Queen was powerless to change that.

==Construction projects==

Most of the sources in Diane&#x27;s hand are accounts, demonstrating her meticulous attention to finances. She profited from the confiscation of Anne de Pisseleu&#x27;s estates and managed the lands well, to the point where she became the beneficiary of 300,000 écus. One of the most successful royal mistresses in acquiring wealth, Diane used her income to build castles by commissioning architect Philibert de l&#x27;Orme. Making strikingly effective use of Renaissance arts and rhetoric, she constructed an image of herself as a paragon of virtue and presented the image of Henry II as a model of chivalry.

Diane supervised the remodeling of Château d&#x27;Anet, her late husband&#x27;s feudal castle of stone. It has a porch with widely spaced paired ionic columns between towers crowned by pyramidal spires. The château is noted for its exterior, notably the Fountain of Diana, in which the mistress represented the goddess reclining with her two dogs and stag. There is the mortuary chapel built according to Diane&#x27;s wishes to contain her tomb, commissioned from architect Claude de Foucques by her daughter Louise, Duchess of Aumale.

Although its ownership remained with the crown until 1555, Diane was the unquestioned mistress of Château de Chenonceau, the jewel of the Loire Renaissance palaces. In 1555, she asked de l&#x27;Orme to build the arched bridge joining the château to its opposite bank and oversaw the planting of extensive gardens filled with varieties of fruit trees. Set along the banks of the river, her exquisite gardens were famous and copied.

==Later years==

Despite wielding such power over the court, Diane&#x27;s status depended on the King&#x27;s welfare and remaining in power. In 1559, Henry was critically wounded in a jousting tournament, when his lance wore her favour (ribbon), rather than his wife&#x27;s. Queen Catherine soon assumed control, restricting access to the royal chambers. Although Henry was alleged to have called out repeatedly for Diane, she was not admitted to his deathbed nor invited to his funeral (the latter as was custom and tradition). She was immediately obliged to give to the Queen Mother the Château de Chenonceau in exchange for the less attractive Château de Chaumont, a punishment much less severe than the ones suffered by other royal mistresses.

Diane lived out her remaining years in her château in Anet, Eure-et-Loir, where she lived in comfortable obscurity as a virtual exile. At the age of 64, she suffered a fall during a ride from which she never fully recovered and died a year later. In accordance with Diane&#x27;s wishes and to provide a resting place for her, her daughter completed the funeral chapel, built near the castle. During the French Revolution, her tomb was opened, her corpse desecrated, and her remains thrown into a mass grave.
In 1866, Georges Guiffrey published her correspondence. When French experts dug up her remains in 2009, they found high levels of gold in her hair. It is suggested that the &quot;drinkable gold&quot; that she &quot;reportedly&quot; regularly took, believed to preserve youth, may have ultimately killed her. In May 2010, she was reburied at her original tomb in the Château d&#x27;Anet.

<text>Shadow Puppets is a science fiction novel by American author Orson Scott Card, published in 2002. It is the sequel to &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; and the third book in the Ender&#x27;s Shadow series (often called the Bean Quartet). It was originally to be called &quot;Shadow of Death&quot;.

==Plot summary==

Peter, Ender&#x27;s brother, is now Hegemon of Earth. Accepting a tip from inside China, where Achilles is held prisoner, Peter had planned for Bean to operate the mission, but at the last minute (because he doubted Bean would cooperate) assigns Suriyawong, a Battle School student from Thailand, to rescue Achilles in transport. Peter believes that he can spy on Achilles, take over his network, and then turn Achilles over to some country for trial, since Achilles has previously betrayed Russia, Pakistan, and India.

Achilles is known to kill anyone who has seen him vulnerable. Bean and his friend Petra, who also served under Ender and who is travelling with Bean, have both seen Achilles so and immediately go into hiding, preparing for a future confrontation. Bean believes Peter has seriously underestimated Achilles, and that he himself is not safe unless he is hidden. During their travels, Petra convinces Bean to marry her and have children with her by taking him to Anton, the person who Anton&#x27;s Key (Bean&#x27;s Condition) was named after. Bean is reluctant to have children, as he does not want his Anton&#x27;s Key gene to be passed on. He finds Volescu, the original doctor who activated the key in his genes, and has him prepare nine embryos through artificial insemination. Volescu pretends to identify three embryos with Anton&#x27;s Key and they are discarded. One of the remaining six is implanted into Petra, while the rest of them are placed under guard.

At the same time, a message is passed to Bean that Han Tzu, a comrade from Battle School, was not in fact the informant in the message sent to Peter about Achilles. Realizing that it had been a setup, Bean gets a message to Peter&#x27;s parents, and they flee with Peter from the Hegemon&#x27;s compound, located in Brazil, which Achilles takes over. Bean narrowly escapes an assassination attempt himself, and escapes to Damascus. There they find that another Battle School comrade, Alai, is the unrivaled Caliph of a nearly unified Muslim world. Meanwhile, Bean and Petra&#x27;s embryos are stolen; Bean expects Achilles to use them to bait a trap for them.

Peter and his parents escape to the colonization platform in space that used to be the battle school, relying on the protection of Colonel Graff, the former commander of the school, now Minister of Colonization. Shortly after they arrive, however, a message is sent betraying their presence. Faking their departure from the space station, Peter and his parents discover the traitor, one of the teachers at battle school. The unmanned shuttle sent as a decoy is shot down over Brazil.

In the previous novel, China had conquered India and Indochina. Alai plans to liberate them by invading first China in a feint, and then India once China has withdrawn its armies to defend the homeland. His invasion is successful, and in the midst of realizing their danger, the Chinese government disavows Achilles, providing evidence that he stole the missile launcher that destroyed the decoy space shuttle. Left with nowhere to turn, Achilles contacts Bean and offers the embryos in exchange for safe passage.

Bean and Peter return to the Hegemon&#x27;s compound. Achilles expects Bean to be so distracted with the idea of retrieving his children that he can be killed with a bomb in the embryo transport container. When Bean sees through that trap, Achilles offers up fake embryos in petri dishes, expecting to lure Bean into a vulnerable position. However, Bean sees through the deception. He pulls out a pistol and shoots Achilles in the eye - a similar fashion to Achilles&#x27; first victim, Poke, whom he killed with a knife to the eye in Ender&#x27;s Shadow.

The novel ends with Peter restored as Hegemon, Petra reunited with Bean, a Caliph in command of the world&#x27;s Muslims, a China severely reduced in territory and forced to accept humiliating surrender terms, and the embryos still lost.

<text>An athame or athamé (, , , or ) is a ceremonial blade, generally with a black handle. It is the main ritual implement or magical tool among several used in ceremonial magic traditions, and by other neopagans, witchcraft, as well as satanic traditions. A black-handled knife called an &quot;arthame&quot; appears in certain versions of the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot;, a grimoire dating to the Renaissance.

The &quot;athame&quot; stands as one of the four elemental tools in modern occultism, traditionally standing for fire, for witches, and air, for ceremonial magicians. It is mentioned in the writings of Gerald Gardner in the 1950s, who claimed to have been initiated into a surviving tradition of Witchcraft, the New Forest Coven. The athame was their most important ritual tool, with many uses, but was not to be used for actual physical cutting. The other three elemental tools are the wand, the pentacle (the element of earth), and the cup or chalice (the element of water). These four magical tools correspond to four significant &quot;weapons&quot; or talismans in Celtic myth: The sword, the spear, the shield, and the cauldron (and / or &#x27;grail&#x27;).

These same four ritual tools also appear in the magical practices of the western hermetic tradition, derived from The Golden Dawn, who pioneered the modern occult tradition and new age spirituality; and they appear in tarot decks as the four card suits: swords, cups, wands, and pentacles. The athame is an elemental tool, while the sword is often a tool representing power, used to keep spirits in check during goetic evocation. Wiccans sometimes use the sword as a substitute for the athame.

== Appearance ==
An &quot;athame&quot; can take many forms. Contrary to popular belief, athames are not required to have double-edged blades or specially-coloured handles. Contemporary magical practitioners often choose a double-edged blade since this carries symbolic meaning.

Some witches will choose a single edge athame and use the straight edge to ring the bell for rituals. The handle of the athame is usually black, and is required in most covens which practice some variant of British tradition Wicca, including Gardnerian and Alexandrian. The handle may be inscribed with particular symbols dictated by the tradition.
Janet and Stewart Farrar in &quot;A Witches&#x27; Bible&quot; suggest that the point of an athame be dulled so as to prevent un-intended physical harm during ritual use.

In eclectic forms of Witchcraft the handle decorations range from astrological glyphs to runes, the symbols being chosen by the owner. Many fantasy-themed athames are also available from medieval and neopagan supply shops.

Ceremonial witches, on the other hand, use the symbolic colours purple and yellow, representing the alchemical element of air, to colour the athame, and it is then inscribed with specific sigils. This is to invoke the powers it corresponds to, and make a proper impression upon the subconscious.

==Use==
The athame&#x27;s primary use is to channel and direct psychic energy, generally conceived as etheric fire. They are usually not supposed to harm or draw blood. Some modern day magical practitioners believe that if things such as herbs or cords need to be cut, another knife called a &quot;boline&quot; is used. The boline is often confused or mislabeled the &quot;white-handled knife&quot;, a completely different magical blade. In fact, a boline was more similar to a sickle than a knife and thus would have made chopping herbs very difficult (the boline was, however, handy for harvesting herbs). In the &quot;kitchen witchcraft&quot; tradition, witches are encouraged to use magical tools for mundane purposes to increase the witch&#x27;s familiarity with them.

The ritual drawing of the boundary of the magic circle – also known as &quot;casting the circle&quot; – is usually done with either a ritual sword or an athame, in traditional coven practice. For open rituals in public places, this is sometimes done with a ritual wand or staff instead, since there may be legal complications involved with swords and daggers in public places, even when the edges have been dulled. In most traditional covens, the athame is associated with the magical element of fire, so the circle is considered to be cast in etheric fire. This fire is traditionally envisioned as blue, indigo or violet; although it may equally well be envisioned as other colors. When the circle is ritually purified after being cast, that is traditionally done with the remaining three elements—air (incense), water (salt-water), and earth (salt) – because the element of fire has already been imbued into the circle during the casting, by the use of the athame.

After the casting, the athame is the tool traditionally used to invoke the elemental guardians of the four directions (also termed &quot;calling the quarters&quot;), typically by drawing invoking pentagrams at each quarter.

As a masculine principle, the black-handled athame is often used in combination with the chalice, as feminine principle, evoking the act of procreation, as a symbol of universal creativity. The athame represents the magical element of fire, associated with the Sun and the Horned God; while the chalice represents the magical element of water, associated with the Moon and the Goddess. The union of the two then represents the union of God and Goddess, male and female, sun and moon, fire and water. The marriage of the Sun and Moon—the union of opposites—is an ancient idea in alchemy; and the &quot;hieros gamos&quot; or sacred marriage of god and goddess is an even more ancient idea in pagan religions. (For example, in ancient Greece—from whence the term &quot;hieros gamos&quot; comes.) This rite is done by dipping the athame into the chalice to bless the wine. This is a symbol of the Great Rite in Wiccan rituals. Some modern witchcraft traditions may prefer not to use iron blades, instead preferring alternatives such as copper, bronze, or stone such as obsidian. This is most common amongst traditions that have a particular fondness of the Sidhe, to whom iron is supposedly baneful.

== Associations ==
Some Wiccan traditions associate the black-handled athame with the masculine principle and with the element of fire, as did Gardner; while the wand is associated with air. Other traditions may reverse these elemental associations, and use the athame to represent air and the wand to represent fire. Farrar &amp; Farrar (1984, 1996) suggested this difference is due to the Golden Dawn releasing false information in the hopes of preventing its rituals being used in the correct way. They add that a witch should always choose the association which seems the most correct to them.

Fire and water are considered to be polar opposite elements, classically and in alchemy and traditional magical practice. They are sometimes considered to be the two primordial elements, the combination of which gave rise to the other two elements of earth and air. Fire and water are also the elements most associated with Sun and Moon, and thus the Horned God and the Goddess within Wicca. For this reason, covens that associate the athame with air (and the wand with fire) may decide to use the wand to bless the wine chalice, instead of using the athame. A union of air and water does not carry the same symbolic significance of the &quot;conjunctio oppositorum&quot; (union of opposites) that the union of fire and water does. Also, covens that regard the athame as air and the wand as fire, may choose to cast the ritual circle with the wand or staff, instead of the sword or athame – if they conceive of this casting in the traditional way, as a casting of etheric fire via a projection of psychic energy. If they conceive of the circle casting as cutting a line in the air with the tool of air, then they may choose to purify the circle with the remaining three elements of fire, water, and earth; this would involve using a candle to purify the circle, and omitting the incense, since the circle has already been imbued with the element of air.

The athame is the most important ritual tool in Wicca, and like other ritual tools it is generally purified and consecrated to the gods before being used for ritual and magical purposes. There are various ways of accomplishing ritual purification and consecration, depending on the specific tradition of Wicca being followed, and also whether the individual Wiccan is practicing with a coven or as a solitary witch. One common way to do this is by using the four magical elements of fire (candle), air (incense), water, and salt; and perhaps anointing the blade with an oil infused with magical herbs. Touching another person&#x27;s athame without permission is considered a ritual &quot;faux pas&quot; in almost all traditions of Wicca: It is an intrusion of the owner&#x27;s personal space; and more importantly, it is an act that violates the magical bond between the athame and its owner. Some witches will go to great lengths to ritually purify, reconsecrate, and rededicate an athame after it has been touched by another person.

== Acquisition ==
There are rituals of consecration for a newly acquired athame, be it new from its maker, or acquired after ritually used by some other person.

== Etymology ==

The term athame derives, via a series of corruptions, from the late Latin &quot;artavus&quot; (&quot;quill knife&quot;), which is well attested in the oldest manuscripts of the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot;. It means &quot;a small knife used for sharpening the pens of scribes&quot; (&quot;Cultellus acuendis calamis scriptorii&quot;). &quot;Artavus&quot; is well-attested in medieval Latin, although it is not a common word. This explains why it was left untranslated in some French and Italian manuscripts, and ultimately became garbled
in various manuscripts as &quot;artavo&quot;, &quot;artavus&quot;, &quot;arthana&quot;, &quot;artanus&quot;, &quot;arthany&quot;, or &quot;arthame&quot;.
Latham described the etymology of &quot;artavus&quot; as being dubious, but Johannes Balbus de Janua
derives it from &quot;arto&quot;, &quot;artas&quot;, etc. (&quot;to narrow&quot;).

An alternate etymology is given by de Garlande, ():
: &quot;Artavus dicitur Gallice &quot;‘kenivet’&quot;, scilicet cultellus qui tendit in altum; vel dicitur ab arte, quia eo artifices utuntur.&quot;

: &quot;Artavus, called &quot;kenivet&quot; in French, namely a small knife which stretches in length, is named after &quot;ars&quot; (art or craft), because it is used by artisans.&quot;
(As distinguished either from a weapon, or from a table knife &quot;cultellos ad mensam&quot;, &quot;mensaculos&quot;.)

Idries Shah, who was personal secretary and close friend of Gerald Gardner, provides yet another etymology from an alleged Arabic &quot;al-dhammé&quot; (&quot;blood-letter&quot;), which was supposed to be the ritual knife of a medieval magical cult of Morocco and Andalusia. This etymology is controversial, however: It appears in his book &quot;The Sufis&quot; as a quotation from &quot;A History of Secret Societies&quot; by Daraul – a probable pseudonym of Shah. Graves (an acquaintance of Shah) suggests an Arabic derivation from &quot;al thame&quot; (or &quot;adh-dhame&quot;), which he translates as &quot;the arrow&quot;.

A Latin manuscript version of the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot; has a drawing that looks like a sickle, labeled &quot;artavo&quot;. Gerald Gardner&#x27;s use of &#x27;athame&#x27; probably came from modern French versions of the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot;, probably via de Givry (1931), who misinterpreted the term as applying to the main ritual knife, as shown by his index entries &quot;arthane&quot;, &quot;arthame&quot;, and &quot;athane&quot;.

== Historical parallels ==
* The Javanese &quot;kris&quot; is a ritual knife regarded as having magical powers, and Gerald Gardner was a recognized authority on these knives before he was involved in Wicca. There has been speculation that Gardner&#x27;s interest and expertise in antique swords and knives, and in particular the &quot;kris&quot; knives of Malaysia and Indonesia, may have contributed to the tool&#x27;s central importance in modern Wicca.
* The Roman &quot;secespita&quot; was a ritual knife; however, it was used for killing a sacrificial animal.
* Zoroastrian priests (&quot;magi&quot;) traditionally used a knife (&quot;kaplo&quot;), a spear (or stick with a nail on the end), or even the forefinger, to draw ritual furrows (&quot;karsha&quot;) for purpose of delineating the protected sacred ritual space from evil and ritual pollution.
* The Tibetan three-sided ceremonial knife, the &quot;phurba&quot;, also known as the magical dagger, or &quot;kīla&quot;.

<doc id="88358" wikidata="Q745760" url="?curid=88358" title="Book of Shadows">
<text>A Book of Shadows is a book containing religious text and instructions for magical rituals found within the Neopagan religion of Wicca. Since its conception, it has made its way into many pagan practices and paths. The most famous Book of Shadows was created by the pioneering Wiccan Gerald Gardner sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s, and which he utilised first in his Bricket Wood coven and then in other covens which he founded in following decades. The Book of Shadows is also used by other Wiccan traditions, such as Alexandrian Wicca and Mohsianism, and with the rise of books teaching people how to begin following non-initiatory Wicca in the 1970s onward, the idea of the Book of Shadows was then further propagated amongst solitary practitioners unconnected to earlier, initiatory traditions.

Initially, when Wicca was still dominated by covens, &quot;only one copy [of the Book] existed for an entire coven, kept by the high priestess or high priest. That rule has proved unfeasible, and it is [now] commonplace for all Witches to have their own copies.&quot; In the various traditions that make up British Traditional Wicca, copies of the original Book composed by Gerald Gardner with the aid of his High Priestess Doreen Valiente, along with alterations and additions that have been made since then, is followed by adherents. Though originally a secret text only given to initiates of Wicca, many initiate and non-initiates alike have gone on to print various Books of Shadows. These figures include Charles Cardell, Lady Sheba, and Janet and Stewart Farrar to name a few. In other Wiccan traditions and amongst a number of solitary practitioners, alternate versions of the Book of Shadows have been written, which are independent of Gardner&#x27;s original.

Numerous associations and traditions have since grown up around the Book of Shadows. Traditionally, &quot;a Witch&#x27;s book of shadows is destroyed upon death.&quot; It can be an experimental practice, everyday ritual works, or a record of magic. This is also a book of inspiration and can be used in future rituals. The concept of the Book of Shadows has subsequently appeared in popular culture, for instance being used in the American television series &quot;Charmed&quot;, which popularised the Book of Shadows.

==History==
===Origins===

Gerald Gardner, the &quot;father of Wicca&quot;, first introduced the Book of Shadows to people that he had initiated into the craft through his Bricket Wood coven in the 1950s. He claimed that it was a personal cookbook of spells that have worked for the owner; they could copy from his own book and add material as they saw fit. He said that the practice of Witches keeping such a book was ancient, and was practised by the Witch-cult throughout history. According to tradition, Gardner claimed that the Book of Shadows was burned after a person died, so that it would not be discovered that they had been a witch.

Gerald Gardner did not mention any such thing as a &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; in his fictitious 1949 novel about mediaeval witchcraft, &quot;High Magic&#x27;s Aid&quot;. High Priestess Doreen Valiente claimed that this was because at the time, Gardner had not yet conceived of the idea, and only invented it after writing his novel.

Valiente made the claim that Gardner found the term &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; from a 1949 edition (Volume I, Number 3) of a magazine known as &quot;The Occult Observer&quot;. In this edition, she claimed, was an advertisement for Gardner&#x27;s novel, &quot;High Magic&#x27;s Aid&quot;, which was opposite an article titled &quot;The Book of Shadows&quot; written by the palmist Mir Bashir. The article in question was about an allegedly ancient Sanskrit divination manual which explained how to foretell things based upon the length of a person&#x27;s shadow. Valiente theorised that Gardner then adopted this term for his Witches&#x27; grimoire. She maintained that &quot;It was a good name, and it is a good name still, wherever Gardner found it&quot;.
A leather bound manuscript written in Gardner&#x27;s handwriting that was titled &quot;Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical&quot; was later found amongst his papers from the Museum after his death by Aidan Kelly and was later obtained by Richard and Tamarra James of the Wiccan Church of Canada. It appeared to be a first draft of Gardner&#x27;s Book of Shadows, and featured sections based upon the rituals of Ordo Templi Orientis which had been devised by the occultist Aleister Crowley. Gardner had gained access to these rituals in 1946, when he had purchased a charter from Crowley giving him permission to perform the OTO rituals.

Some people have taken this as evidence that Gardner invented the idea of a Witches&#x27; Grimoire, perhaps sometime between 1946 (when he finished his novel &quot;High Magic&#x27;s Aid&quot;), and 1949, and had named it &quot;Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical&quot;. In 1949, he had renamed it to the &quot;Book of Shadows&quot;, and soon began to make use of it with his Bricket Wood Coven.

Adding weight to the evidence indicating Gardner invented the Book was that other Neo-pagan witches of the time, such as Robert Cochrane, never made use of such a book.

===Valiente&#x27;s rewriting===
In 1953, Doreen Valiente joined Gardner&#x27;s Bricket Wood coven, and soon rose to become its High Priestess. She noticed how much of the material in his Book of Shadows was taken not from ancient sources as Gardner had initially claimed, but from the works of the occultist Aleister Crowley, from &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot;, from the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot; and also from the rituals of Freemasonry. She confronted Gardner with this, who admitted that the text he had received from the New Forest coven had been fragmentary and he had had to fill much of it using various sources. He also stated that &quot;well, if you think you can do any better, go ahead&quot;, and Valiente thought that she could, later stating that:

Valiente rewrote much of it, cutting out a lot of sections that had come from Crowley (whose negative reputation she feared), though retaining parts that originated with &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot;, which she felt was genuine witchcraft practice. Valiente dramatically rewrote sections such as the &quot;Charge of the Goddess&quot; and also wrote several poems for the book, such as &quot;The Witches Rune&quot;. She also helped to create a poem to include the Wiccan Rede within it.

Valiente also noticed that a chant in one ritual in the book was based upon the poem &quot;A Tree Song&quot; from &quot;Puck of Pook&#x27;s Hill&quot; by Rudyard Kipling, which she had enjoyed as a child. The chant in question stated that:
:Oh, do not tell the priest our plight,
:Or he would call it sin;
:But - we have been in the woods all night,
:A-conjuring summer in !
:And we bring you news by word of mouth -
:Good news for cattle and corn -
:Now is the Sun come up from the South,
:With Oak, and Ash, and Thorn!

(These eight lines are exactly the final stanza of &quot;A Tree Song&quot;.)

This version of the ritual, written by both Gardner and Valiente, but containing sections adopted from various sources, such as Aleister Crowley, &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot;, and even Rudyard Kipling, went on to become the traditional text for Gardnerian Wicca.

==In British Traditional Wicca==
In forms of British Traditional Wicca, which include Gardnerian Wicca, Alexandrian Wicca and Algard Wicca, the Book of Shadows used by adherents is based upon that written by Gardner and Valiente.

Although his own book had been put together with the help of Doreen Valiente and included material from a variety of modern sources, (notably from &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot; and the writings of Aleister Crowley) it also included sections written in an antique (or mock-antique) style, including advice for witches brought to trial and tortured. Gardner claimed that these sections were genuinely historical in origin, and that witches had not been allowed to write anything down until recently, to avoid incrimination; when at last Books of Shadows were allowed, the rituals and spells had to be written in a jumbled manner to prevent any non-initiate from using them. More recent scholars however have doubted their authenticity.

It seems likely that Gardner told his three subsequent initiatory lines that the book should be copied word for word, and Wiccans descended from Eleanor Bone, Patricia Crowther and Monique Wilson have widely believed that the book was of ancient provenance.

===Contemporary usage===
There sometimes exist two Books of Shadows kept by more traditional Wiccans, one being a coven book of core rituals and practises which remains unchanged and from which new initiates copy, and the second, intended for personal use, which differs from witch to witch and contains magical material collected by the initiate, such as astrology, herbal lore, and information regarding divination.

===Publication===
After Gardner&#x27;s death, his rival, Charles Cardell, published much of the material from the Gardnerian Book of Shadows. In the 1970s, the then Alexandrians Janet Farrar and Stewart Farrar decided, with the consent of Doreen Valiente, that much of the Gardnerian book should be published in its true form. Much of it was published by the Farrars in their 1984 book &quot;The Witches&#x27; Way&quot;.

==In Eclectic Wicca==
In non-traditional or &quot;eclectic&quot; forms of Wiccan or Neo-pagan practice, the term &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; is more often used to describe a personal journal, rather than a traditional text. This journal records rituals, spells, and their results, as well as other magical information. This can be either an individual or coven text, and is not normally passed from teacher to student. In many cases, this kind of Book of Shadows is an electronic document (disk or website) instead of a hand-written one. Some reserve the Book of Shadows for recording spells and keep a separate book, sometimes called the &quot;Book of Mirrors&quot;, to contain thoughts, feelings and experiences.

==Other traditions==
Not all traditions of Wicca utilize the term &quot;Book of Shadows&quot;. In Seax-Wica, a tradition founded by Raymond Buckland, the Book of Shadows is called &quot;The Tree&quot;, and in Devotional Wicca, the book is titled &quot;The Book of Ways&quot;; many traditions refer to their Books of Shadows as simply &quot;The Book&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The television fantasy series &quot;Charmed&quot; features a fictional &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; which contains spells and arcane law, and has a supernatural ability to defend itself from harm. In the 1996 film &quot;The Craft&quot;, which some critics saw as a major influence on the series &quot;Charmed&quot;, the &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; was referred to as an object in which a witch keeps her &quot;power thoughts&quot;.

The 2000 sequel to &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; was titled &quot;Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2&quot; and featured a Wiccan character, despite there being no mention of a &quot;Book of Shadows&quot;, during the film. But in the film&#x27;s teaser trailer, reveals the &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; itself but never appeared in the film. In the trailer, the &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; was found by a half-naked woman with a twana symbol behind her back, at the woods of Black Hills, until she was attacked by an unknown man. The title was seen as an attempt to capitalise on the &quot;Charmed&quot; series&#x27; established market.

In the 2011 television series &quot;The Secret Circle&quot;, each family is shown to have their own &quot;Book of Shadows&quot;, with each book containing unique spells. As the book is passed down from generation to generation, each generation appears to write their own spells or notes, as indicated by Cassie&#x27;s recognition of her mother&#x27;s handwriting in her own family&#x27;s &quot;Book of Shadows&quot;.

The Japanese horror adventure game &quot;Corpse Party: Book of Shadows&quot; deals with the eponymous book during its final chapter, in which it is revealed to be an actual Book of Shadows very much in keeping with the description in this article (albeit in the game, there is only one Book of Shadows that exists, containing a complete chronicle of all spells that exist in the entire world, be they Wiccan or not). The Book of Shadows returns in &quot;Corpse Party: Blood Drive&quot; where it becomes a key element to the story throughout the game.

In the Australian television series &quot;Nowhere Boys&quot; two characters are known to possess a &quot;Book of Shadows&quot;. One being one of the protagonists, Felix Ferne, and one being an antagonist, Alice Hartley. Felix&#x27;s book was first thought to be his diary as he tried to hide its true existence from his friends, and Alice&#x27;s book was thought to be her sister&#x27;s.

In the fifth edition of roleplaying game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, members of the warlock class can gain a Book of Shadows, which enables them to learn extra spells and rituals regardless of whether or not such magic is ordinarily accessible through the warlock class.

In the roguelike video game &quot;Binding of Isaac&quot;, the &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; is featured as an active item the player can find. When used, it grants the player invulnerability which lasts for 10 seconds. It can be used multiple times as long as the player can recharge it by clearing hostile rooms/waves or by manually charging the item by other means.

<doc id="88360" wikidata="Q77056" url="?curid=88360" title="Edam, Netherlands">
<text>Edam () is a city in the northwest Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. Combined with Volendam, Edam forms the municipality of Edam-Volendam. Approximately 7,380 people live in Edam. The entire municipality of Edam-Volendam has 28,492 inhabitants. The name Edam originates from a dam on the little river E or IJe where the first settlement was located and which was therefore called IJedam.

Edam is famous as the original source of the cheese with the same name.

== History ==
The town of Edam was founded around a dam crossing the river E or IJe close by the Zuiderzee, now known as the IJsselmeer. Around 1230 the channel was dammed. At the dam goods had to be transferred to other vessels and the inhabitants of Edam could levy a toll. This enabled Edam to grow as a trade town. Shipbuilding and fishing brought Edam more wealth.

Count Willem V of Holland granted Edam rights as a borough in 1357. One of the reasons he did that was because of the war between the Hoeken and the Kabeljauwen. They fought a battle for the rule over the towns of Holland.

Thanks to their rights as a borough, the people of Edam transferred make a new harbour. The building of the new harbour gave Edam connections to the major cities in Holland and the international trading routes. By the 16th century there were as many as 33 wharves in Edam, which, along with the fact that Edam was also granted the right to hold a market three times every year, provided a great boost to the local economy – making it one of the more important towns of North Holland, vying with Enkhuizen, Hoorn and Amsterdam.

However, the open sea mouth caused flooding problems in the hinterland and in 1544 the Emperor Charles V gave orders to close the harbour with lock gates, which were built in the town centre in 1569. This resulted in the harbour silting up and the ship building industry went into a decline by the end of the 17th century.

The cheese market was the primary resource of the economy of Edam in the 16th century. On 16 April 1526 Emperor Charles V gave Edam the right to have a market every week. In 1594 this right was given in perpetuity by Prince Willem I as a mark of his appreciation for the town&#x27;s support during the Siege of Alkmaar.

== The old city centre ==
The old town centre, within the borders of the old city walls, is nowadays protected by the government, both the main structures and architectural details. A number of notable buildings survive in good condition.

=== St. Nicolas church ===
Grote Kerk or St. Nicholaaskerk, of cathedral dimensions, was probably built at the beginning of the 15th Century. In both 1602 and 1699 the church suffered extensive fires after lightning strikes to the tower. Consequently, when rebuilt (in 1701) the height of the tower was significantly reduced. St Nicholas church is one of the largest 3-ridged churches in Europe. Built on piles, the weight of the church was an important consideration and the vaulted ceiling is a wooden copy of a stone ceiling. The church also contains many stained glass windows donated as gifts from neighbouring towns or by the flourishing Edam guilds (such as the guild of ships&#x27; carpenters) after the fire in 1602.

=== The town hall ===
Built in 1737 the town hall is on a somewhat larger scale than the rest of Edam. The entrance with its heavy double doors and sandstone surrounds are in the Louis XIV style and a wooden tower completes the picture. The town hall is still in active use for marriage ceremonies.

=== The Edam Museum ===
Opposite the Town hall, across the dam, is Edam&#x27;s oldest brick house. This was built around 1530 as a private house and converted to a museum in 1895. The house represents typical Dutch construction of the period, and the internal layout is completely original. The house has a deeper kitchen with mezzanine living quarters above it. The kitchen leads to a floating cellar; a brick box room floating freely on ground water. According to folklore the cellar was built by a sea captain who missed the sea. However, it is more likely that cellar was built simply to keep the contents dry, while at the same time not requiring waterproof foundations.

=== Carillon ===
Records suggest that the Church of Our Dear Lady was present on the site since 1350 and its tower dates from the 15th and 16th centuries. Though the church was demolished in 1882 the late Gothic Carillon tower survives. In 1972 the tower threatened to fall, but it was shored up with steel girders and subsequently completely restored. The bells, protruding from the open lantern, were made by Pieter van den Ghein in 1566 and still ring out a short melody every 15 minutes. This melody may be varied: for example typical Saint Nicholas songs ring out on December 5.

== Cheese market ==
After Edam was granted the right to have weekly markets, commercial cheese markets stayed(?) in the town until 1922. The cheese was brought to the market by local farmers on little boats, and when the cheese was lifted out of the boats it was carried to the market by cheese sledges. At the market, the cheese was shown to the merchants. After being tested for their quality, the price was settled by haggling until there was agreement. After that, the cheese was brought to a warehouse where it was kept until the quality was at its best.

Since 1989, the cheese market in Edam has been revived as a re-enactment for tourists. It is held on each Wednesday in July and August.

<text>The Lattice C Compiler was released in June 1982 by Lifeboat Associates and was the first C compiler for the IBM Personal Computer. The compiler sold for $500 and would run on PC DOS or MS-DOS (which at the time were the same product with different brandings). The first hardware requirements were given as 96KB of RAM and one (later two) floppy drives. It was ported to many other platforms, such as mainframes (MVS), minicomputers (VMS), workstations (UNIX), OS/2, Amiga, Atari ST, and Sinclair QL.

The compiler was subsequently repackaged by Microsoft under a distribution agreement as Microsoft C version 2.0. Microsoft developed their own C compiler that was released in April 1985 as Microsoft C Compiler 3.0. Lattice was purchased by SAS Institute in 1987 and rebranded as SAS/C. After this, support for other platforms dwindled until compiler development ceased for all platforms except IBM mainframes. The product is still available in versions that run on other platforms, but these are cross compilers that only produce mainframe code.

Some of the early 1982 commercial software for the IBM PC was ported from CP/M (where it was written for the BDS C subset of the C language) to MS-DOS using Lattice C including Perfect Writer, PerfectCalc, PerfectSpeller and PerfectFiler. This suite was bundled with the Seequa Chameleon and Columbia Data Products.
* LMK, make tool
* LSE, screen editor
* TMN, text management utilities

==Reception==
In a 1983 review of five C compilers for the IBM PC, &quot;BYTE&quot; chose Lattice C as the best in the &quot;superior quality, but expensive and unsuited to the beginner&quot; category. It cited the software&#x27;s &quot;quick compile and execution times, small incremental code, best documentation and consistent reliability&quot;. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; that year similarly praised Lattice C&#x27;s documentation and compile-time and runtime performance, and stated that it was slightly superior to the CI-C86 and c-systems C compilers.

<text>In the United States, a county or county equivalent is an administrative or political subdivision of a U.S. state or other territories of the United States which consists of a geographic area with specific boundaries and usually some level of governmental authority. The term &quot;county&quot; is used in 48 states, while Louisiana and Alaska have functionally equivalent subdivisions called parishes and boroughs, respectively. Counties and other local governments exist as a matter of U.S. state law, so the specific governmental powers of counties may vary widely between the states, with many providing some level of services to civil townships, municipalities, and unincorporated areas. Certain municipalities are in multiple counties; New York City is uniquely partitioned into five counties, referred to at the city government level as boroughs. Some municipalities have been consolidated with their county government to form consolidated city-counties or have been legally separated from counties altogether to form independent cities. Conversely, counties in Connecticut and Rhode Island, eight of Massachusetts&#x27;s 14 counties, and Alaska&#x27;s Unorganized Borough have no government power, existing only as geographic distinctions.

The United States Census Bureau uses the term &quot;county equivalent&quot; to describe places that are comparable to counties, but called by different names. Louisiana parishes, the organized boroughs of Alaska, independent cities, and the District of Columbia are equivalent to counties for administrative purposes. Alaska&#x27;s Unorganized Borough is further divided into 11 census areas that are statistically equivalent to counties. In 2024, the U.S. Census Bureau began to also count Connecticut&#x27;s Councils of Governments, which took over some of the regional powers from the state&#x27;s former county governments, as county equivalents.

Territories of the United States do not have counties; instead, the United States Census Bureau also divides them into county equivalents. The U.S. Census Bureau counts American Samoa&#x27;s districts and atolls as county equivalents. American Samoa locally has places called &quot;counties&quot;, but these entities are considered to be &quot;minor civil divisions&quot; (not true counties) by the U.S. Census Bureau.

The number of counties per state ranges from the three counties of Delaware to the 254 counties of Texas. County populations also vary widely: in 2017, according to the Census Bureau, more than half the U.S. population was concentrated in just 143 of the more than 3,000 counties, or just 4.6% of all counties; the five most populous counties, ordered from most to least, are Los Angeles County, California; Cook County, Illinois; Harris County, Texas; Maricopa County, Arizona; and San Diego County, California.

, there are 3,144 counties and county-equivalents in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. If the 100 county equivalents in the U.S. territories are counted, then the total is 3,244 counties and county-equivalents in the United States.

==History==
The idea of counties originated with the counties of England. English (after 1707, British) colonists brought to their colonies in North America a political subdivision that they already used in the British metropole: the counties. Counties were among the earliest units of local government established in the Thirteen Colonies that would become the United States. Virginia created the first counties in order to ease the administrative workload in Jamestown. The House of Burgesses divided the colony first into four &quot;incorporations&quot; in 1617 and finally into eight shires (or counties) in 1634: James City, Henrico, Charles City, Charles River, Warrosquyoake, Accomac, Elizabeth City, and Warwick River. America&#x27;s oldest intact county court records can be found at Eastville, Virginia, in Northampton (originally Accomac) County, dating to 1632. Maryland established its first county, St. Mary&#x27;s in 1637. In 1639, the Province of Maine founded York County. Massachusetts followed in 1643. Pennsylvania and New York delegated significant power and responsibility from the colony government to county governments and thereby established a pattern for most of the United States, although counties remained relatively weak in New England.

When independence came, the framers of the Constitution left the matter to the states. Subsequently, state constitutions conceptualized county governments as arms of the state. Louisiana instead adopted the local divisions called &quot;parishes&quot; that dated back to both the Spanish colonial and French colonial periods when the land was dominated by the Catholic Church. In the twentieth century, the role of local governments strengthened and counties began providing more services, acquiring home rule and county commissions to pass local ordinances pertaining to their unincorporated areas. In 1955, delegates to the Alaska Constitutional Convention wanted to avoid the traditional county system and adopted their own unique model with different types of &quot;boroughs&quot; varying in powers and duties.

In some states, these powers are partly or mostly devolved to the counties&#x27; smaller divisions usually called townships, though in New York, New England and Wisconsin they are called &quot;towns&quot;. The county may or may not be able to override its townships on certain matters, depending on state law.

The newest county in the United States of America is the city and county of Broomfield, Colorado, established in 2001 as a consolidated city-county, previously part of four counties. The newest county equivalents are the Alaskan census areas of Chugach and Copper River, both established in 2019, and the Alaskan boroughs of Petersburg established in 2013, Wrangell established in 2008, and Skagway established in 2007.

==County variations==

===Consolidated city-counties===

A consolidated city-county is simultaneously a city, which is a municipality (municipal corporation), and a county, which is an administrative division of a state, having the powers and responsibilities of both types of entities. The city limit or jurisdiction is synonymous with the county line, as the two administrative entities become a non-dichotomous single entity. For this reason, a consolidated city-county is officially remarked as &quot;name of city – name of county&quot; (i.e., Augusta–Richmond County in Georgia). The same is true of the boroughs of New York City, each of which is coextensive with a county of New York State. For those entities in which the city uses the same name as the county, &quot;city and county of name&quot; may be used (i.e., City and County of Denver in Colorado).

Similarly, some of Alaska&#x27;s boroughs have merged with their principal cities, creating unified city-boroughs. Some such consolidations and mergers have created cities that rank among the geographically largest cities in the world, though often with population densities far below those of most urban areas.

There are 40 consolidated city-counties in the U.S., including Augusta–Richmond County; the City and County of Denver, Colorado; the City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii; Indianapolis–Marion County, Indiana; Jacksonville–Duval County, Florida; Louisville–Jefferson County, Kentucky; Lexington–Fayette County, Kentucky; Kansas City–Wyandotte County, Kansas; Nashville–Davidson County, Tennessee; New Orleans–Orleans Parish, Louisiana; the City and County of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; City and County of San Francisco, California; and Lynchburg-Moore County, Tennessee

A consolidated city-county may still contain independent municipalities maintaining some governmental powers that did not merge with the rest of the county. For example, the government of Jacksonville–Duval County, Florida, still provides county-level services to the four independent municipalities within its borders: Atlantic Beach, Baldwin, Jacksonville Beach, and Neptune Beach.

===County equivalents===
The term &quot;county equivalents&quot; is used by the United States Census Bureau to describe divisions that are comparable to counties but called by different names:
* Alaska boroughs: The state adopted the term &quot;borough&quot; instead of &quot;county&quot; to reflect Alaska&#x27;s system with different classes of boroughs varying in governmental powers.
* Alaska census areas: Nearly half of the land area of Alaska is not contained within any of Alaska&#x27;s 19 organized boroughs. This vast area, larger than France and Germany combined, is officially referred to by the Alaska state government as the &quot;Unorganized Borough&quot; and outside of other incorporated borough limits, has no independent &quot;county&quot; government, although several incorporated city governments exist within its boundaries; the majority of it is governed and run by the State of Alaska as an extension of state government. The United States Census Bureau, in cooperation with the Alaska state government for census and electoral districting purposes, has divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 census areas for statistical purposes only.
* Louisiana parishes: The usage of the term &quot;parish&quot; for a territorial entity or local government in Louisiana dates back to both the Spanish colonial and French colonial periods when the land was dominated by the Catholic Church. New Orleans is a consolidated city-parish. 
* Independent cities: These are cities that legally belong to no county. They differ from consolidated city-counties in that in the case of a consolidated city-county, the county at least nominally exists, whereas in the case of an independent city, no county even nominally exists. There are 41 such cities in the United States: Baltimore, Maryland; Carson City, Nevada; St. Louis, Missouri; and all 38 cities in Virginia, where any area incorporated as a city is outside of the county jurisdiction.
* Washington, D.C., outside the jurisdiction of any state, has a special status. The City of Washington comprises the entirety of the District of Columbia, which, in accordance with Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, is under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress. When founded in 1801, the District consisted of two counties and three cities. In 1846, Alexandria County (which now forms Arlington County and a portion of the independent city of Alexandria)—including the then City of Alexandria—was given back to Virginia. In 1871, the three remaining entities—the City of Washington, City of Georgetown, and Washington County (which was coterminous with the district)—were merged into a consolidated government of District of Columbia by an act of Congress. Georgetown was abolished as a city by another act in 1895.
* Connecticut councils of governments (beginning in 2024): County governments were abolished in Connecticut in 1960. Regional councils of governments (COGs) have since been developed as a means of cooperation and coordination between municipalities. Application for the COGs to be considered county equivalents for statistical purposes was made to the Census Bureau in 2019, approved in 2022, and was fully implemented by 2024.

Consolidated city-counties are not designated county equivalents for administrative purposes; since both the city and the county at least nominally exist, they are properly classified as counties in their own right. Likewise, the boroughs of New York City are coextensive with counties and are therefore by definition also not county equivalents.

====Territories====

There are technically no counties in U.S. territories. American Samoa has its own counties, but the U.S. Census Bureau does not treat them as counties (instead, the U.S. Census Bureau treats American Samoa&#x27;s three districts and two atolls as county equivalents). American Samoa&#x27;s counties are treated as minor civil divisions. Most territories are directly divided into municipalities or similar units, which are mostly treated as equivalent of counties for statistical purposes:

==Names and etymologies==

Common sources of county names are names of people, geographic features, places in other states or countries, and animals. Quite a few counties bear names of Native American, French, or Spanish origin.

Counties are most often named for people, often political figures or early settlers, with over 2,100 of the 3,144 total so named. The most common county name, with 31, is Washington County, for America&#x27;s first president, George Washington. Up until 1871, there was a Washington County within the District of Columbia, but it was dissolved by the District of Columbia Organic Act. Jefferson County, for Thomas Jefferson, is next with 26. The most recent president to have a county named for him was Warren G. Harding, reflecting the slowing rate of county creation since New Mexico and Arizona became states in 1912. The most common names for counties not named after a president are Franklin (25), Clay (18), and Montgomery (18).

After people, the next most common source of county names are geographic features and locations, with some counties even being named after counties in other states, or for places in other countries, such as the United Kingdom (the latter is most common in the area of the original Thirteen Colonies in the case of the United Kingdom, or in places which had a large number of immigrants from a particular area for other countries). The most common geographic county name is Lake. Words from Native American languages, as well as the names of Native American leaders and tribes, lend their names to many counties. Quite a few counties bear names of French or Spanish origin, such as Marquette County being named after French missionary Father Jacques Marquette.

The county&#x27;s equivalent in the state of Louisiana, the parish (Fr. &quot;paroisse civile&quot; and Sp. &quot;parroquia&quot;) took its name during the state&#x27;s French and Spanish colonial periods. Before the Louisiana Purchase and granting of statehood, government was often administered in towns where major church parishes were located. Of the original 19 civil parishes of Louisiana that date from statehood in 1807, nine were named after the Roman Catholic parishes from which they were governed.

==County government==

=== Organization ===
The structure and powers of a county government may be defined by the general law of the state or by a charter specific to that county. States may allow only general-law counties, only charter counties, or both. Generally, general-law local governments have less autonomy than chartered local governments.

Counties are usually governed by an elected body, variously called the county commission, board of supervisors, commissioners&#x27; court, county council, county court, or county legislature. In cases in which a consolidated city-county or independent city exists, a city council usually governs city/county or city affairs. In some counties, day-to-day operations are overseen by an elected county executive or by a chief administrative officer or county administrator who reports to the board, the mayor, or both.

In many states, the board in charge of a county holds powers that transcend all three traditional branches of government. It has the legislative power to enact laws for the county; it has the executive power to oversee the executive operations of county government; and it has quasi-judicial power with regard to certain limited matters (such as hearing appeals from the planning commission if one exists).

In many states, several important officials are elected separately from the board of commissioners or supervisors and cannot be fired by the board. These positions may include county clerk, county treasurer, county surrogate, sheriff, and others.

District attorneys or state attorneys are usually state-level as opposed to county-level officials, but in many states, counties and state judicial districts have coterminous boundaries.

The site of a county&#x27;s administration, and often the county courthouse, is generally called the county seat (&quot;parish seat&quot; in Louisiana, &quot;borough seat&quot; in Alaska, or &quot;shire town&quot; in several New England counties). The county seat usually resides in a municipality. However, some counties may have multiple seats or no seat. In some counties with no incorporated municipalities, a large settlement may serve as the county seat.

===Scope of power===
The power of county governments varies widely from state to state, as does the relationship between counties and incorporated cities.

The powers of counties arise from state law and vary widely.
In Connecticut and Rhode Island,
counties are geographic entities, but not governmental jurisdictions. At the other extreme, Maryland counties and the county equivalent City of Baltimore handle almost all services, including public education, although the state retains an active oversight authority with many of these services. Counties in Hawaii also handle almost all services since there is no formal level of government (municipality, public education, or otherwise) existing below that of the county in the state.

In most Midwestern and Northeastern states, counties are further subdivided into townships or towns, which sometimes exercise local powers or administration. Throughout the United States, counties may contain other independent, self-governing municipalities.

====Minimal scope====
In New England, counties function at most as judicial court districts and sheriff&#x27;s departments (presently, in Connecticut only as judicial court districts—and in Rhode Island, they have lost both those functions and most others but they are still used by the United States Census Bureau and some other federal agencies for some federal functions), and most of the governmental authority below the state level is in the hands of towns and cities. In several of Maine&#x27;s sparsely populated counties, small towns rely on the county for law enforcement, and in New Hampshire several social programs are administered at the state level. In Connecticut, Rhode Island, and parts of Massachusetts, counties are now only geographic designations, and they do not have any governmental powers. All government is either done at the state level or at the municipal level. In Connecticut and parts of Massachusetts, regional councils have been established to partially fill the void left behind by the abolished county governments. The regional councils&#x27; authority is limited compared with a county government—they have authority only over infrastructure and land use planning, distribution of state and federal funds for infrastructure projects, emergency preparedness, and limited law enforcement duties.

====Moderate scope====
In the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, counties typically provide, at a minimum, courts, public utilities, libraries, hospitals, public health services, parks, roads, law enforcement, and jails. There is usually a county registrar, recorder, or clerk (the exact title varies) who collects vital statistics, holds elections (sometimes in coordination with a separate elections office or commission), and prepares or processes certificates of births, deaths, marriages, and dissolutions (divorce decrees). The county recorder normally maintains the official record of all real estate transactions. Other key county officials include the coroner/medical examiner, treasurer, assessor, auditor, comptroller, and district attorney.

In most states, the county sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer in the county. However, except in major emergencies where clear chains of command are essential, the county sheriff normally does not directly control the police departments of city governments, but merely cooperates with them (e.g., under mutual aid pacts). Thus, the most common interaction between county and city law enforcement personnel is when city police officers deliver suspects to sheriff&#x27;s deputies for detention or incarceration in the county jail.

In most states, the state courts and local law enforcement are organized and implemented along county boundaries, but nearly all of the substantive and procedural law adjudicated in state trial courts originates from the state legislature and state appellate courts. In other words, most criminal defendants are prosecuted for violations of state law, not local ordinances, and if they, the district attorney, or police seek reforms to the criminal justice system, they will usually have to direct their efforts towards the state legislature rather than the county (which merely implements state law).

A typical criminal defendant will be arraigned and subsequently indicted or held over for trial before a trial court in and for a particular county where the crime occurred, kept in the county jail (if he is not granted bail or cannot make bail), prosecuted by the county&#x27;s district attorney, and tried before a jury selected from that county. But long-term incarceration is rarely a county responsibility, execution of capital punishment is never a county responsibility, and the state&#x27;s responses to prisoners&#x27; appeals are the responsibility of the state attorney general, who has to defend before the state appellate courts the prosecutions conducted by locally elected district attorneys in the name of the state. Furthermore, county-level trial court judges are officers of the judicial branch of the state government rather than county governments.

In many states, the county controls all unincorporated lands within its boundaries. In states with a township tier, unincorporated land is controlled by the townships. Residents of unincorporated land who are dissatisfied with county-level or township-level resource allocation decisions can attempt to vote to incorporate as a city, town, or village.

A few counties directly provide public transportation themselves, usually in the form of a simple bus system. However, in most counties, public transportation is provided by one of the following: a special district that is coterminous with the county (but exists separately from the county government), a multi-county regional transit authority, or a state agency.

====Broad scope====
In western and southern states, more populated counties provide many facilities, such as airports, convention centers, museums, recreation centers,
beaches, harbors, zoos, clinics, law libraries, and public housing. They provide services such as child and family services, elder services, mental health services, welfare services, veterans assistance services, animal control, probation supervision, historic preservation, food safety regulation, and environmental health services. They have many additional officials like public defenders, arts commissioners, human rights commissioners, and planning commissioners.

There may be a county fire department and a county police department – as distinguished from fire and police departments operated by individual cities, special districts, or the state government. For example, Gwinnett County, Georgia, and its county seat, the city of Lawrenceville, each have their own police departments. (A separate county sheriff&#x27;s department is responsible for security of the county courts and administration of the county jail.) In several southern states, public school systems are organized and administered at the county level.

==Statistics==

, there were 2,999 counties, 64 Louisiana parishes, 19 organized boroughs and 11 census areas in Alaska, 9 Councils of Government in Connecticut, 41 independent cities, and the District of Columbia for a total of 3,144 counties and county equivalents in the 50 states and District of Columbia. There are an additional 100 county equivalents in the territories of the United States. The average number of counties per state is 62, with a range from the three counties of Delaware to the 254 counties of Texas.

Southern and Midwestern states generally tend to have more counties than Western or Northeastern states, as many Northeastern states are not large enough in area to warrant a large number of counties, and many Western states were sparsely populated when counties were created by their respective state legislatures. The five counties of Rhode Island and eight of the 14 counties of Massachusetts no longer have functional county governments, but continue to exist as legal and census entities. Connecticut abolished county governments in 1960, leaving its eight counties as mere legal and census entities. In 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau recognized the state&#x27;s nine Councils of Governments as replacement for the state&#x27;s eight legacy counties for all statistical purposes; full implementation was completed in 2024.

===Population===

The average U.S. county population was 104,435 in 2019, while the median county, which is Nicholas County, West Virginia, had a population of 25,965 in 2019. The most populous county is Los Angeles County, California, with 10,014,009 residents in 2020. This number is greater than the populations of 41 U.S. states, and is only slightly smaller than the combined population of the 10 least populous states and Washington, D.C. It also makes the population of Los Angeles County 17.4 times greater than that of the least populous state, Wyoming.

The second most populous county is Cook County, Illinois, with a population of 5,275,541. Cook County&#x27;s population is larger than that of 28 individual U.S. states and the combined populations of the six smallest states.

The least populous county is Loving County, Texas, with 64 residents in 2020. Eight county equivalents in the U.S. territories have no human population: Rose Atoll, Northern Islands Municipality, Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, and Navassa Island. The remaining three islands in the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands (Midway Atoll, Palmyra Atoll and Wake Island) have small non-permanent human populations. The county equivalent with the smallest non-zero population counted in the census is Swains Island, American Samoa (17 people), although since 2008 this population has not been permanent either.

The most densely populated county or county equivalent is New York County, New York (coextensive with the New York City Borough of Manhattan), with in 2015. The Yukon–Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska, is both the most extensive and the least densely populated county or county equivalent with in 2015.

In the 50 states (plus the District of Columbia), a total of 981 counties have a population over 50,000; 592 counties have a population over 100,000; 137 counties have a population over 500,000; 45 counties have a population over 1,000,000; and 14 counties have a population over 2,000,000. At the other extreme, 35 counties have a population under 1,000; 307 counties have a population under 5,000; 709 counties have a population under 10,000; and 1,492 counties have a population between 10,000 and 50,000.

===Area===
At the 2000 U.S. census, the median land area of U.S. counties was , which is two-thirds of the median land area of a ceremonial county of England, and a little more than a quarter of the median land area of a French &quot;département&quot;. Counties in the western United States typically have a much larger land area than those in the eastern United States. For example, the median land area of counties in Georgia is , whereas in Utah it is .

The most extensive county or county equivalent is the Yukon–Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska, with a land area of 145,505 square miles (376,856 km2). All nine of the most extensive county equivalents are in Alaska. The most extensive county is San Bernardino County, California, with a land area of 20,057 square miles (51,947 km2). The least extensive county is Kalawao County, Hawaii, with a land area of 11.991 square miles (31.058 km2). The least extensive county equivalent in the 50 states is the independent city of Falls Church, Virginia, with a land area of 1.999 square miles (5.177 km2). If U.S. territories are included, the least extensive county equivalent is Kingman Reef, with a land area of 0.01 square miles (0.03 km2).

==Geographic relationships between cities and counties==
In some states, a municipality may be in only one county and may not annex territory in adjacent counties, but in the majority of states, the state constitution or state law allows municipalities to extend across county boundaries. At least 32 states include municipalities in multiple counties. Dallas, for example, contains portions of five counties, while numerous other cities comprise portions of four counties. New York City is an unusual case because it encompasses multiple entire counties in one city. Each of those counties is coextensive with one of the five boroughs of the city: Manhattan (New York County), The Bronx (Bronx County), Queens (Queens County), Brooklyn (Kings County), and Staten Island (Richmond County).

<doc id="88369" wikidata="Q2616305" url="?curid=88369" title="Obfuscation">
<text>Obfuscation is the of the intended meaning of communication by making the message difficult to understand, usually with confusing and ambiguous language. The obfuscation might be either unintentional or intentional (although intent usually is connoted), and is accomplished with circumlocution (talking around the subject), the use of jargon (technical language of a profession), and the use of an argot (ingroup language) of limited communicative value to outsiders.

In expository writing, unintentional obfuscation usually occurs in draft documents, at the beginning of composition; such obfuscation is illuminated with critical thinking and editorial revision, either by the writer or by an editor. Etymologically, the word &quot;obfuscation&quot; derives from the Latin , from ; synonyms include the words and .

==Medical==
Doctors are faulted for using jargon to conceal unpleasant facts from a patient; the American author and physician Michael Crichton said that medical writing is a &quot;highly skilled, calculated attempt to confuse the reader&quot;. The psychologist B. F. Skinner said that medical notation is a form of multiple audience control, which allows the doctor to communicate to the pharmacist things which the patient might oppose if they could understand medical jargon.

==Eschew==
&quot;Eschew obfuscation&quot;, also stated as &quot;eschew obfuscation, espouse elucidation&quot;, is a humorous fumblerule used by English teachers and professors when lecturing about proper writing techniques. Literally, the phrase means &quot;avoid being unclear&quot; or &quot;avoid being unclear, support being clear&quot;, but the use of relatively uncommon words causes confusion in much of the audience (those lacking the vocabulary), making the statement an example of irony, and more precisely a heterological phrase. The phrase has appeared in print at least as early as 1959, when it was used as a section heading in a NASA document.

An earlier similar phrase appears in Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s Literary Offenses&quot;, where he lists rule fourteen of good writing as &quot;eschew surplusage&quot;.

==Secure communication==

Obfuscation of oral or written communication achieves a degree of secure communication without a need to rely upon technology. This technique is sometimes referred to as &quot;talking around&quot; and is a form of security through obscurity.

A notable example of obfuscation of written communication is a message sent by September 11 attacks ringleader Mohamed Atta to other conspirators prior to the attacks occurring:

In this obfuscated message, the following code words are believed to exist:
* &quot;semester&quot; refers to planned September 11 attacks
* &quot;19 confirmations&quot; refers to the Hijackers in the September 11 attacks
* &quot;faculty of law&quot; refers to a target, the United States Capitol
* &quot;faculty of urban planning&quot; refers to a target, the World Trade Center
* &quot;faculty of fine arts&quot; refers to a target, the White House
* &quot;faculty of engineering&quot; refers to a target, The Pentagon

Within the illegal drug trade, obfuscation is commonly used in communication to hide the occurrence of drug trafficking. A common spoken example is &quot;420&quot;, used as a code word for cannabis, a drug which, despite some recent prominent decriminalization changes, remains illegal in most places. The Drug Enforcement Administration reported in July 2018 a total of 353 different code words used for cannabis.

==White box cryptography==
In white-box cryptography, obfuscation refers to the protection of cryptographic keys from extraction when they are under the control of the adversary, e.g., as part of a DRM scheme.

==Network security==
In network security, obfuscation refers to methods used to obscure an attack payload from inspection by network protection systems.

== In popular culture ==

* In Animal Farm, the pigs such as Squealer and Snowball use obfuscation to confuse the other animals with doublespeak in order to prevent any uprisings.
*In the British Sitcom Yes Minister, the character Sir Humphrey Appleby often uses obfuscation for comedic effect while trying to confuse and prevent Jim Hacker from taking charge.

<doc id="88371" wikidata="Q190076" url="?curid=88371" title="Joe Cocker">
<text>John Robert &quot;Joe&quot; Cocker (20 May 1944 – 22 December 2014) was an English singer known for his gritty, bluesy voice and dynamic stage performances that featured expressive body movements. Most of his best known singles, such as 
&quot;Feelin&#x27; Alright?&quot; and &quot;Unchain My Heart&quot;, were recordings of songs written by other song writers, though he composed a number of songs for most of his albums as well, often in conjunction with songwriting partner Chris Stainton.

His first album featured a recording of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;, which brought him to near-instant stardom. The song reached number one in the UK in 1968, became a staple of his many live shows (Woodstock and the Isle of Wight in 1969, the Party at the Palace in 2002) and was also known as the theme song for the late 1980s American TV series &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;. He continued his success with his second album, which included a second Beatles song, &quot;She Came In Through the Bathroom Window&quot;. A hastily thrown together 1970 US tour led to the live double-album &quot;Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen&quot;, which featured an all-star band organized by Leon Russell. His 1974 recording of &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot; reached number five in the US, and became his signature song. Cocker&#x27;s best-selling song was the US number one &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot;, a duet with Jennifer Warnes that earned a 1983 Grammy Award. He released a total of 22 studio albums over a 43-year recording career.

In 1993, Cocker was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Male Solo Artist. He was awarded a bronze Sheffield Legends plaque in his hometown in 2007, and received an OBE the following year for services to music. Cocker was ranked number 97 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 100 greatest singers list.

== Early life (1944–1960) ==

Cocker was born on 20 May 1944 at 38 Tasker Road, Crookes, Sheffield. He was the youngest son of a civil servant, Harold Norman Cocker (1907–2001), at the time of his son&#x27;s birth serving as an aircraftman in the Royal Air Force, and Madge (née Lee). According to differing family stories, Cocker received his nickname of Joe either from playing a childhood game called &quot;Cowboy Joe&quot;, or from a local window cleaner named Joe.

Cocker&#x27;s main musical influences growing up were Ray Charles and Lonnie Donegan. Cocker&#x27;s first experience singing in public was at age 12 when his elder brother Victor invited him on stage to sing during a gig of his skiffle group. In 1960, along with three friends, Cocker formed his first group, the Cavaliers. For the group&#x27;s first performance at a youth club, they were required to pay the price of admission before entering. The Cavaliers eventually broke up after a year and Cocker left school to become an apprentice gasfitter working for the East Midlands Gas Board, later British Gas Corporation, while simultaneously pursuing a career in music.

Cocker is not related to fellow Sheffield-born musician Jarvis Cocker, despite a rumour to this effect (particularly in Australia, where Jarvis Cocker&#x27;s father, radio presenter Mac Cocker, allowed listeners to believe that he was Joe&#x27;s brother), although Joe was a friend of the family and even did some babysitting for Jarvis when the latter was an infant.

==Career (1961-2014)==
=== Early career and the Grease Band (1961–1969) ===
In 1961, under the stage name &quot;Vance Arnold&quot;, Cocker started a new group, Vance Arnold and the Avengers. The name was a combination of Vince Everett, Elvis Presley&#x27;s character in &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; (which Cocker misheard as Vance), and country singer Eddy Arnold. The group mostly played in the pubs of Sheffield, performing Chuck Berry and Ray Charles songs. Cocker developed an interest in blues music and sought out recordings by John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins and Howlin&#x27; Wolf. In 1963, they booked their first significant gig when they supported the Rolling Stones at Sheffield City Hall.

In 1964, Cocker signed a recording contract as a solo act with Decca and released his first single, a recording of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Instead&quot; (with Big Jim Sullivan and Jimmy Page playing guitars). Despite extensive promotion from Decca lauding his youth and working-class roots, the record was a flop and his recording contract with Decca lapsed at the end of 1964. After Cocker recorded the single, he dropped his stage name and formed a new group, Joe Cocker&#x27;s Blues Band. There is only one known recording of Joe Cocker&#x27;s Blues Band on an EP given out by The Sheffield College during Rag Week and called &quot;Rag Goes Mad at the Mojo&quot;.

In 1966, after a year-long hiatus from music, Cocker teamed up with Chris Stainton, whom he had met several years before, to form the Grease Band. The Grease Band was named after Cocker read an interview with jazz keyboardist Jimmy Smith, where Smith positively described another musician as &quot;having a lot of grease&quot;. Like the Avengers, Cocker&#x27;s group mostly played in pubs in and around Sheffield. The Grease Band came to the attention of Denny Cordell, the producer of Procol Harum, the Moody Blues and Georgie Fame. Cocker recorded the single &quot;Marjorine&quot; without the Grease Band for Cordell in a London studio. He then moved to London with Chris Stainton, and the Grease Band was dissolved. Cordell set Cocker up with a residency at the Marquee Club in London, and a &quot;new&quot; Grease Band was formed with Stainton and keyboardist Tommy Eyre.
In 1968, Cocker found commercial success with a rearrangement of &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;, another Beatles song, which, many years later, was used as the opening theme for &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;. The recording features lead guitar from Jimmy Page, drumming by B. J. Wilson, backing vocals from Sue and Sunny, and Tommy Eyre on organ. The single remained in the top ten of the UK Singles Chart for thirteen weeks before eventually reaching number one, on 9 November 1968. It also reached number 68 on the US charts.

The new touring line-up of Cocker&#x27;s Grease Band featured Henry McCullough on lead guitar, who would go on to briefly play with McCartney&#x27;s Wings. After touring the UK with the Who in autumn 1968 and Gene Pitney and Marmalade in early winter 1969, the Grease Band embarked on their first tour of the US in spring 1969. Cocker&#x27;s album &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; was released soon after their arrival and made number 35 on the American charts, eventually going gold.
During his US tour, Cocker played at several large festivals, including the Newport Rock Festival and the Denver Pop Festival. In August, Denny Cordell heard about the planned concert in Woodstock, New York and convinced organiser Artie Kornfeld to book Cocker and the Grease Band for the Woodstock Festival. The group had to be flown into the festival by helicopter due to the large crowds. They performed several songs, including &quot;Feelin&#x27; Alright?&quot;, &quot;Something&#x27;s Comin&#x27; On&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Get Stoned&quot;, &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot; and &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;. Cocker would later say that the experience was &quot;like an eclipse ... it was a very special day.&quot;

Directly after Woodstock, Cocker released his second album, &quot;Joe Cocker!&quot; Impressed by his version of &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;, Paul McCartney and George Harrison allowed Cocker to use their songs &quot;She Came In Through the Bathroom Window&quot; and &quot;Something&quot; for the album. Recorded during a break in touring in the spring and summer, the album reached number 11 on the US charts and garnered a second UK hit with the Leon Russell song, &quot;Delta Lady&quot;.

In August 1969, Cocker performed at the Isle of Wight Festival at Wootton Bridge, Isle of Wight, England. Throughout 1969 he was featured on variety TV shows like &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and &quot;This Is Tom Jones&quot;. Onstage, he exhibited an idiosyncratic physical intensity, flailing his arms and playing air guitar. At the end of the year Cocker was unwilling to embark on another US tour, so he dissolved the Grease Band.

=== Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen (1970–1971) ===

Despite Cocker&#x27;s reluctance to venture out on the road again, an American tour had already been booked so he had to quickly form a new band in order to fulfill his contractual obligations. It proved to be a large group of more than 20 musicians, including pianist and bandleader Leon Russell, three drummers – Jim Gordon, Jim Keltner, and Chuck Blackwell, and backing vocalists Rita Coolidge and Claudia Lennear. Denny Cordell christened the new band &quot;Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen&quot;, after the Noël Coward song of the same name (with its refrain, &quot;Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun&quot;). Cocker&#x27;s music evolved into a more bluesy type of rock, comparable to that of the Rolling Stones.

During the ensuing Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen tour (later described by drummer Jim Keltner as &quot;a big, wild party&quot;), Cocker toured 48 cities, recorded a live album, and received positive reviews from &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; for his performances. However, the pace of the tour was exhausting. Russell and Cocker had personal problems; Cocker became depressed and began drinking excessively as the tour wound down in May 1970. Meanwhile, he enjoyed several chart entries in the United States with cover versions of &quot;Feelin&#x27; Alright&quot; (originally recorded by Traffic) and &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;.

His version of the Box Tops&#x27; hit &quot;The Letter&quot;, which appeared on the live album and film, &quot;Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen&quot;, became his first US Top Ten hit. After spending several months in Los Angeles, Cocker returned home to Sheffield, where his family became increasingly concerned with his deteriorating physical and mental health. In the summer of 1971, A&amp;M Records released the single &quot;High Time We Went&quot;. This became a hit, reaching number 22 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, but was not issued on an album until November 1972 on the &quot;Joe Cocker&quot; album.

=== On the road (1972–1979) ===
In early 1972, after nearly two years away from music, Cocker went on tour with a group that Chris Stainton had formed. He opened with a performance in Madison Square Garden which was attended by about 20,000 people. After touring the United States, he embarked on a European tour where he played to large audiences in Milan and Germany. He then returned to the United States for another tour in autumn 1972. During these tours the group cut the songs that would be part of his newest album, &quot;Joe Cocker&quot;. A mixture of live songs and studio recordings, the album peaked at number 30 on the US charts.
In October 1972, when Cocker toured Australia, he and six members of his entourage were arrested in Adelaide for possession of marijuana. The next day, in Melbourne, assault charges were laid after a brawl at the Commodore Chateau Hotel, and the Australian Federal Police gave Cocker 48 hours to leave the country. This caused huge public outcry in Australia, as Cocker was a high-profile overseas artist and had a strong support base, especially among the baby boomers who were coming of age and able to vote for the first time. It sparked hefty debate about the use and legalisation of marijuana in Australia, and gained Cocker the nickname &quot;the Mad Dog&quot;.

Shortly after the Australian tour, Stainton retired from his music career to establish his own recording studio. After his friend&#x27;s departure and his estrangement from his longtime producer Denny Cordell, Cocker sank into depression and began using heroin. In June 1973, he kicked the habit but continued to drink heavily.

At the end of 1973, Cocker returned to the studio to record a new album, &quot;I Can Stand a Little Rain&quot;. The album, released in August 1974, was number 11 on the US charts and one single, a recording of Billy Preston&#x27;s &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot;, reached the number 5 slot. Despite positive reviews for the album, Cocker struggled with live performances, largely due to his problems with alcohol. One such instance was reported in a 1974 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which said that during two West Coast performances in October of that year he threw up onstage.

In January 1975, he released a second album that had been recorded at the same time as &quot;I Can Stand a Little Rain&quot;, &quot;Jamaica Say You Will&quot;. To promote his new album, Cocker embarked on another tour of Australia, made possible by the country&#x27;s new Labor government. In late 1975, he contributed vocals on a number of the tracks on Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;The 20th Anniversary of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; all-star album. He also recorded a new album in a Kingston, Jamaica studio, &quot;Stingray&quot;. However, record sales were disappointing; the album reached only number 70 on the US charts.

In May 1976, Cocker headlined an 11-date tour of Canada, and on 2 October, Cocker performed &quot;Feelin&#x27; Alright&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. John Belushi joined him onstage doing his famous impersonation of Cocker&#x27;s stage movements. At the time, Cocker was $800,000 in debt to A&amp;M Records and struggling with alcoholism. Several months later, he met producer Michael Lang, who agreed to manage him on the condition that he stay sober. With a new band, Cocker embarked on a tour of New Zealand, Australia and South America. He then recorded a new album with session work by Steve Gadd and Chuck Rainey. In the autumn of 1978, Cocker toured North America promoting his album, &quot;Luxury You Can Afford&quot;. Despite this effort, it received mixed reviews, selling around 300,000 copies.

In 1979, Cocker joined the &quot;Woodstock in Europe&quot; tour, which featured musicians like Arlo Guthrie and Richie Havens who had played at the 1969 Woodstock Festival. He also performed in New York&#x27;s Central Park to an audience of 20,000 people. The concert was recorded and released as the live album, &quot;Live in New York&quot;.

=== 1980s (1980-1989) ===
In 1982, Cocker recorded two songs with the jazz group the Crusaders on their album &quot;Standing Tall&quot;. One song, &quot;I&#x27;m So Glad I&#x27;m Standing Here Today&quot;, was nominated for a Grammy Award and Cocker performed it with the Crusaders at the awards ceremony. The Crusaders wrote this song with Cocker in mind to sing it. Cocker then released a new reggae-influenced album, &quot;Sheffield Steel&quot;, recorded with the Compass Point All Stars, produced by Chris Blackwell and Alex Sadkin.

Also in 1982, Cocker recorded the duet &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot; with Jennifer Warnes for the soundtrack of the film &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;. The song was an international hit, reaching number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and winning a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo. The duet also won an Academy Award for Best Original Song, and Cocker and Warnes performed the song at the awards ceremony. Several days later, he was invited to perform &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot; with Ray Charles in a television tribute to the musician. In 1983, Cocker joined a star-studded line-up of British musicians, including Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Steve Winwood and Bill Wyman for singer Ronnie Lane&#x27;s 1983 tour to raise money for the London-based organisation Action for Research into Multiple Sclerosis, in particular because Lane was beginning to suffer from the degenerative disease.

While on another tour that year, Cocker was arrested by Austrian police after refusing to perform because of inadequate sound equipment. The charges were eventually dropped and Cocker was released. Shortly after the incident, he released his ninth studio album, &quot;Civilized Man&quot;. His next album &quot;Cocker&quot; was dedicated to his mother, Madge, who died when he was recording in the studio with producer Terry Manning. A track from the album, &quot;You Can Leave Your Hat On&quot; was featured in the 1986 film &quot;9½ Weeks&quot;. The album eventually went Platinum on the European charts. His song &quot;Love Lives On&quot; was featured in the 1987 film Harry and the Hendersons. His 1987 album &quot;Unchain My Heart&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award, although it did not win. &quot;One Night of Sin&quot; was also a commercial success, surpassing &quot;Unchain My Heart&quot; in sales and yielding his final Top 20 hit in the United States, &quot;When The Night Comes&quot;, written by Bryan Adams, Jim Vallance and Diane Warren that peaked at number 11 in January 1990.

Throughout the 1980s, Cocker continued to tour around the world, playing to large audiences in Europe, Australia and the United States. In 1986, he met the Italian singer Zucchero Fornaciari, who dedicated a song (&quot;Nuovo, meraviglioso amico&quot;, in &quot;Rispetto&quot;) to the English bluesman. After that Cocker took part in some concerts of the promotional tours for the albums &quot;Blue&#x27;s&quot; (1987) and &quot;Oro Incenso &amp; Birra&quot; (1989). In 1988, he performed at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall and appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. After Barclay James Harvest and Bob Dylan, Cocker was the first to give rock concerts in the German Democratic Republic, in East Berlin and Dresden. The venue, the &quot;Blüherwiese&quot;, next to the Rudolf–Harbig–Stadion, bears the vernacular name &quot;Cockerwiese&quot; (&#x27;Cocker meadow&#x27;) today. He also performed for US President George H. W. Bush at an inauguration concert in 1989.

=== Later career (1990-2014) ===
In 1992, Cocker&#x27;s version of Bryan Adams&#x27; &quot;Feels Like Forever&quot; made the UK Top 40. Also in 1992, Cocker teamed with Canadian rocker Sass Jordan to sing &quot;Trust in Me&quot;, which was featured on &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; soundtrack. At the 1993 Brit Awards, Cocker was nominated for British Male Solo Artist. Cocker performed the Saturday opening set at Woodstock &#x27;94 as one of the few alumni who played at the original Woodstock Festival in 1969 and was well received.
On 3 June 2002, Cocker performed &quot;With A Little Help From My Friends&quot; accompanied by Phil Collins on drums and Queen guitarist Brian May at the Party at the Palace concert in the grounds of Buckingham Palace, an event in commemoration of the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II. In 2007, Cocker appeared playing minor characters in the film &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, as the lead singer on another Beatles&#x27; hit, &quot;Come Together&quot;, Cocker was awarded an OBE in the Queen&#x27;s 2007 Birthday Honours list for services to music. To celebrate receiving his award in mid December 2007, Cocker played two concerts in London and in his home town of Sheffield where he was awarded a bronze Sheffield Legends plaque outside Sheffield Town Hall.
In April and May 2009, Cocker conducted a North American tour in support of his album &quot;Hymn for My Soul&quot;. He sang the vocals on &quot;Little Wing&quot; for the Carlos Santana album, &quot;Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time&quot;, released on 21 September 2010. In the autumn of 2010, Cocker toured Europe promoting his studio album &quot;Hard Knocks&quot;.

In 2000, Cocker was the opening act in select cities in the United States and Europe for Tina Turner&#x27;s Twenty Four Seven Tour.
He returned to Australia in 2008 and again in 2011, the latter of which featured George Thorogood and the Destroyers as an opening act.

On 20 March 2011, Cocker took part in a benefit concert for Cornell Dupree at B.B. King&#x27;s Blues Club in New York City. Dupree played on four Cocker albums: &quot;I Can Stand A Little Rain&quot; (1974), &quot;Jamaica Say You Will&quot; (1975), &quot;Stingray&quot; (1976) and &quot;Luxury You Can Afford&quot; (1978). Dupree&#x27;s band Stuff was also Cocker&#x27;s backing band on a tour promoting &quot;Stingray&quot; in 1976.

Cocker kept recording and touring throughout his later years. 2012&#x27;s &quot;Fire it up&quot;, which would turn out to be Cocker&#x27;s last studio album, was followed by an extensive tour, consisting of a US leg in 2012 and a European run in 2013. He played 25 shows in Germany alone on the European leg of the tour, which reflects the popularity Cocker enjoyed there. The full show of 22 April at Cologne&#x27;s Lanxess Arena was recorded and released on CD and DVD under the title &quot;Fire it up Live&quot; later in 2013. The last concert on the tour, which was to be Cocker&#x27;s final live performance, was at the Loreley Open Air Theatre in Sankt Goarshausen on 7 September 2013.

=== Tributes and acclaim ===

In 1994, fellow Yorkshire musician Philip Oakey, on behalf of his group, the Human League, said that Cocker was their &quot;hero&quot;.

The two remaining living ex-Beatles, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, were among those who paid tribute to the singer following his death, while Cocker&#x27;s agent, Barrie Marshall, said that Cocker was &quot;without doubt the greatest rock/soul singer ever to come out of Britain&quot;. McCartney commented:

On 11 September 2015, a &quot;Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen&quot; tribute concert to Joe Cocker was performed at the Lockn&#x27; Festival featuring Tedeschi Trucks Band, Chris Stainton, Leon Russell, Rita Coolidge, Claudia Lennear, Pamela Polland, Doyle Bramhall II, Dave Mason, John Bell, Warren Haynes and Chris Robinson, among others. In commemoration, a Joe Cocker Mad Dogs and Englishmen Memory Book was created by Linda Wolf to celebrate the event. In late 2021, the feature-length documentary &quot;Learning to Live Together&quot; was released documenting the reunion concert.

In 2017, a feature-length documentary film about Cocker titled &quot;Joe Cocker: Mad Dog with Soul&quot; was released.

In 1963, Cocker began dating Eileen Webster, also a resident of Sheffield. The couple dated intermittently for the next 13 years.

In 1978, Cocker moved onto a ranch owned by Jane Fonda in Santa Barbara, California. Pam Baker, a local summer camp director and fan of Cocker&#x27;s music, had persuaded the actress to lend the house to Cocker. Baker began dating Cocker, and they married on 11 October 1987.

While performing a concert at Madison Square Garden on 17 September 2014, fellow pop musician Billy Joel stated that Cocker was &quot;not very well right now&quot; and endorsed Cocker for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame before his tribute performance of &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;. Cocker died from lung cancer on 22 December 2014 in Crawford, Colorado at the age of 70. He had smoked two packs of cigarettes a day until he quit in 1991.

<text>The five counties of Hawaii on the Hawaiian Islands enjoy somewhat greater status than many counties on the United States mainland. Counties in Hawaii are the only legally constituted government bodies below that of the state. No formal level of government (such as city governments) exists below that of the county in Hawaii.

Unlike the other 49 states, Hawaii does not delegate educational responsibility to local school boards; public education is carried out by the Hawaii State Department of Education. Hawaiian counties collect property taxes and user fees in order to support road maintenance, community activities, parks (including life guards at beach parks), garbage collection, police (the state police force, called the Hawaii Department of Public Safety, is limited in scope), ambulance, and fire suppression services.

All the counties were created in 1905 from unorganized territory, seven years after the Territory of Hawaii was created. The county of Kalawao was historically exclusively used as a leper colony, and does not have many of the elected officials the other counties do. Many services for Kalawao County are provided by Maui County. For example, the web site for the office of the Maui County Clerk says &quot;The office is also responsible for the elections in the County of Maui and the County of Kalawao&quot;.

==County information==
The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify counties, is provided with each entry. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county.

<text>Flensburg (; Danish and ; ; ) is an independent town in the far north of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. After Kiel and Lübeck, it is the third-largest town in Schleswig-Holstein.

Flensburg&#x27;s city centre lies about from the Danish border.

==Known for==
In Germany, Flensburg is known for:
* the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (roughly: National Driver and Vehicle Register) with its &quot;Verkehrssünderkartei&quot; (literally: &quot;traffic sinner card file&quot;), where details of traffic offences are stored
* its beer &quot;Flensburger Pilsener&quot;, also called &quot;Flens&quot;
* the centre of the Danish national minority in Germany
* the greeting &quot;moin&quot;
* the large erotic mail-order companies &quot;Beate Uhse&quot; and &quot;Orion&quot;
* its handball team, SG Flensburg-Handewitt
* the Naval Academy at Mürwik 
* being the final seat of the Third Reich from 1 May 1945, following Adolf Hitler&#x27;s death, until the Third Reich&#x27;s final, formal dissolution in early June 1945.

==Geography==

Flensburg is in the north of the German state Schleswig-Holstein, very close to the German-Danish border. After Glücksburg and Westerland, it is Germany&#x27;s northernmost town. Flensburg lies at the innermost tip of the Flensburg Firth, an inlet of the Baltic Sea. Flensburg&#x27;s eastern shore is part of the Angeln peninsula.

===Neighbouring municipalities===
Clockwise from the northeast, beginning at the German shore of the Flensburg Firth, the following communities in Schleswig-Flensburg district and Denmark&#x27;s Southern Denmark Region all border Flensburg:

Glücksburg (Amt-free town), Wees (Amt Langballig), Maasbüll, Hürup, Tastrup and Freienwill (all in Amt Hürup), Jarplund-Weding, Handewitt (Amt Handewitt), Harrislee (Amt-free community) and Aabenraa Municipality on the Danish shore of the Flensburg Firth.

===Constituent communities===
The town of Flensburg is divided into 13 communities, which are further divided into 38 statistical areas. Constituent communities have a two-digit number and the statistical areas a three-digit number.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
Flensburg was founded at the latest by 1200 at the innermost end of the Flensburg Firth by Danish settlers, who were soon joined by German merchants. In 1284, its town rights were confirmed and the town quickly became one of the most important in the Duchy of Schleswig. Unlike Holstein, Schleswig did not belong to the German Holy Roman Empire. Therefore, Flensburg was not a member of the Hanseatic League, but did maintain contacts with it.

Historians presume that there were several reasons this spot was chosen for settlement:
*Shelter from heavy winds
*A trade route between Holstein and North Jutland (namely the &quot;Hærvejen&quot; or &quot;Ochsenweg&quot;, a series of roads between Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein and Jutland, possibly dating from the Bronze Age)
* The Angelnway: a trade route between North Frisia and Angeln
*A good herring fishery

Herrings, especially kippered, brought about the blossoming of the town&#x27;s trade in the Middle Ages. They were sent inland and to almost every European country.

On 28 October 1412, Queen Margaret I of Denmark died of the plague aboard a ship in Flensburg Harbour.

From time to time plagues such as bubonic plague, caused mainly by rat fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis, a parasite found on brown rats), &quot;red&quot; dysentery and other scourges killed much of Flensburg&#x27;s population. Lepers were strictly isolated at the St.-Jürgen-Hospital (&quot;Helligåndshospital&quot;, built before 1290), far outside the town&#x27;s gates, where St. Jürgen Church is now. About 1500, syphilis also appeared. The church hospital &quot;Zum Heiligen Geist&quot; (&quot;To the Holy Ghost&quot;) stood in Große Straße, now Flensburg&#x27;s pedestrian precinct.

A Flensburger&#x27;s everyday life was very hard, and the old roads and paths were bad. The main streets were neither paved nor lit at night. When the streets became really bad, citizens made the dung-filled streets passable with wooden pathways. Only the few upper-class houses had windows. In 1485, a great fire struck Flensburg. Storm tides also beset the town occasionally. Every household in the town kept livestock in the house and the yard. Townsfolk furthermore had their own cowherds and a swineherd.

===Early modern times===
After the fall of the Hanseatic League in the 16th century, Flensburg was said to be one of the most important trading towns in the Scandinavian area. Flensburg merchants were active as far away as the Mediterranean, Greenland, and the Caribbean. The most important commodities, after herring, were sugar and whale oil, the latter from whaling off Greenland. But the Thirty Years&#x27; War put an end to this boom time. The town was becoming Protestant and thereby ever more German culturally and linguistically, while the neighbouring countryside remained decidedly Danish.

In the 18th century, thanks to the rum trade, Flensburg had yet another boom. Cane sugar was imported from the Danish West Indies (now the US Virgin Islands) and refined in Flensburg. Only in the 19th century, as a result of industrialization, was the town at last outstripped by the competition from cities such as Copenhagen and Hamburg.

The rum produced in Flensburg was then reintegrated into West Indian trade routes, which as of 1864 moved away from the Danish West Indies to the British colony of Jamaica instead. It was imported from there, blended, and sold all over Europe. There is now only one active rum distillery in Flensburg, &quot;A. H. Johannsen&quot;.
===History as a German town===
Between 1460 and 1864, Flensburg was, after Copenhagen, the Kingdom of Denmark&#x27;s second-biggest port, but it passed to the Kingdom of Prussia after the Second Schleswig War in 1864. The Battle of Flensburg was on February 6, 1864: near the city a small Hungarian mounted regiment chased a Danish infantry and Dragoon regiment. At the election for the North German Reichstag in 1867, there had still been a Danish majority in Flensburg, and it continued until around 1880. However, thereafter, the majority shifted partly due to immigration of workers from other parts of Germany and because the bureaucracy was largely replaced with Germans from the south. Today, a sizable Danish community remains in the town. Some estimates put the percentage of Flensburgers who belong to it as high as 25%; other estimates put it much lower. The SSW political party representing the minority usually gains 20–25% of the votes in local elections, but not all its voters are Danes. Before 1864, Danes consisted of the vast majority, which belonged to what is now the minority; even today there are many Danish surnames in the Flensburg telephone directory (Asmussen, Claussen, Jacobsen, Jensen, Petersen, etc.). However, the upper classes at that time, comprising merchants, bureaucrats, academics, and the clergy, were predominantly German.

On 1 April 1889, Flensburg became an independent city (&quot;kreisfreie Stadt&quot;) within the Province of Schleswig-Holstein, and at the same time still kept its status as seat of the Flensburg district. In 1920, the League of Nations decided that the matter of the German–Danish border would be settled by a vote. As a result of the plebiscite, and the way the voting zones were laid out, some of Flensburg&#x27;s northern neighbourhoods were ceded to Denmark, whereas Flensburg as a whole voted by a large margin to stay in Germany.

In return for this pro-German vote, Flensburg was given a large hall, the &quot;Deutsches Haus&quot;, which the government endowed as &quot;thanks for German loyalty&quot;.

During the Second World War, the town was left almost unscathed by the air raids that devastated other German cities. But in 1943, 20 children died when a nursery school was bombed, and shortly after the war ended, an explosion at a local munitions storage site claimed many victims.
In 1945, Admiral Karl Dönitz, who was briefly President (&quot;Reichspräsident&quot;) of Nazi Germany after Adolf Hitler appointed him his successor and then killed himself, fled to Flensburg with what was left of his government. The so-called Flensburg Government, led by Dönitz, was in power from 1 May, the announcement of Hitler&#x27;s death, for one week, until German troops surrendered and the town was occupied by Allied troops. The regime was effectively dissolved on 23 May, when the British Army arrested Dönitz and his ministers in Mürwik and detained them in the Navy School in Mürwik (). The Berlin Declaration promulgated on 5 June formalized the dissolution. Flensburg was therefore, for a few weeks, the seat of the last Third Reich government.

===Since the Second World War===
After the Second World War, the town&#x27;s population broke the 100,000 mark for a short time, making Flensburg a city (&quot;Großstadt&quot;) under one traditional definition. The population later sank below that mark.

In the years after the Second World War, South Schleswig, and particularly Flensburg, had a strong pro-Danish movement connected with the idea of the &quot;Eider Politics&quot;. Its goal was for the town and all or most of Schleswig, the whole area north of the Eider River, to be united with Denmark. After 1945, Flensburg&#x27;s town council was for years dominated by Danish parties, and the town had a Danish mayor.

The town profited from the planned location of military installations. Since German Reunification, the number of soldiers has dropped to about 8,000. Since Denmark&#x27;s entry into the European Economic Community (now the European Union), border trade has played an important role in Flensburg&#x27;s economic life. Some Danish businesses, such as Danfoss, have set up shop just south of the border for tax reasons.

In 1970, the Flensburg district was expanded to include the municipalities in the Amt of Medelby, formerly in the Südtondern district, and in 1974 it was united with the Schleswig district to form the district of Schleswig-Flensburg, whose district seat was the town of Schleswig. Flensburg thereby lost its function as a district seat but remained an independent (district-free) town.

===Amalgamations===
Until the middle of the 19th century, Flensburg&#x27;s municipal area comprised an area of 2 639 ha. Beginning in 1874, the following communities or rural areas (&quot;Gemarkungen&quot;) were annexed to the town of Flensburg:

===Population development===
Population figures are for respective municipal areas through time. Until 1870, figures are mostly estimates, and thereafter census results (¹) or official projections from either statistical offices or the town administration itself.


¹ Census results

==Danish minority==
The Danish minority in Flensburg (Danish: &quot;Flensborg&quot;) and the surrounding towns runs its own schools, libraries, and Lutheran churches, from which the German majority is not excluded. These two groups&#x27; coexistence is considered a sound and healthy symbiosis. A form of mixed Danish–German, Petuh, is used on the ferries.

There is also a Danish Consulate-General in Flensburg.

In Denmark, Flensburg seems to be mainly known for its &quot;border shops&quot; where, among other things, spirits, beer and candy are for sale at lower prices than in Denmark. The prices are lower because the value-added tax is lower and excise taxes are either lower (e.g., on alcohol) or do not exist (e.g., on sugar). The border shops may sell canned beer to Scandinavia residents without paying deposits as long as it is not consumed in Germany.

==Politics==
For centuries, two mayors led the town council, one for the north town (St. Marien) and one for the south town (St. Nikolai and St. Johannis). The council members and mayors were chosen by the council itself: retiring officials&#x27; successors were named by the remaining councillors in such a way that both halves of the town had as many members. These councillors usually bore the title &quot;Senator&quot;.

This &quot;town government&quot; lasted until 1742 when the &quot;northern mayor&quot; was made the &quot;directing mayor&quot; by the Danish King. From this position came what was later known as the First Mayor. The second mayor simply bore the title &quot;mayor&quot; (&quot;Bürgermeister&quot;). After the town was ceded to Prussia, the townsfolk elected the mayors as of 1870, and the First Mayor was given the title &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot;, still the usual title in German towns and cities. During the Third Reich, the town head was appointed by those who held power locally.

In 1945, after the Second World War, a twofold leadership based on a British model was introduced. Heading the town stood foremost the &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot;, who was chosen by the town council and whose job was as chairman of council and the municipality. Next to him was an &quot;Oberstadtdirektor&quot; (&quot;Higher Town Director&quot;), who was leader of administration. In 1950, when Schleswig-Holstein brought its new laws for municipalities into force, the title &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot; was transferred (once again) to this latter official. At first, and for a while, he was chosen by the council. Since that time, the former official has been called the &quot;Stadtpräsident&quot; (&quot;Town President&quot;), and is likewise chosen by the council after each municipal election. Since 1999, the &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot; has been chosen directly by the voters, as before.

The first directly elected &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot;, Hermann Stell, died on 4 May 2004 of a stroke. On 14 November 2004, the independent candidate suggested by the CDU, Klaus Tscheuschner, was elected to replace Stell with 59% of the vote. In the 2003 municipal election, Hans Hermann Laturnus was elected &quot;Stadtpräsident&quot;.

In the 2008 municipal election, the local list WiF (Wir in Flensburg) was elected the largest group in the Council Assembly of Flensburg, with 10 city councillors out of 43, closely followed by the South Schleswig Voter Federation (&quot;Südschleswigscher Wählerverband&quot;) (9 councillors) and the CDU (9 councillors). Also elected was the SPD (seven councillors), the Greens (3 councillors), the Left (3 councillors) and the FDP (2 councillors). Nevertheless, since the WiF-group was divided into two different caucuses, the SSW-group has been the assembly&#x27;s largest group. The City President is Christian Dewanger (WiF).

In the 2010 mayoral election, Simon Faber (SSW) was elected Lord Mayor of the town in a runoff election with 54.8% of the vote. He was the first person from the Danish Minority to occupy this office since the end of World War II.

===Mayor===
The mayor of Flensburg is Fabian Geyer, who was elected in 2022. He took office on 15 January 2023.

===City council===
The Flensburg city council governs the city alongside the mayor. The most recent city council election was held on 14 May 2023, and the results were as follows:

==Coat of arms==
Flensburg&#x27;s coat of arms shows in gold above blue and silver waves rising to the left a six-sided red tower with a blue pointed roof, breaking out of which, one above the other, are the two lions of Schleswig and Denmark; above is a red shield with the silver Holsatian nettle leaf on it. The town&#x27;s flag is blue, overlaid with the coat of arms in colour.

The lions symbolize Schleswig, and the nettle leaf Holstein, thus expressing the town&#x27;s unity with these two historic lands. The tower recalls Flensburg&#x27;s old town rights and the old castle that was the town&#x27;s namesake (&quot;Burg&quot; means &quot;castle&quot;). The waves refer to the town&#x27;s position on the Flensburg Fjord.

The coat of arms was granted the town by King Wilhelm II of Prussia in 1901, and once again in modified, newly approved form on 19 January 1937 by Schleswig-Holstein&#x27;s High President (&quot;Oberpräsident&quot;)

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Flensburg is twinned with:
* Carlisle, United Kingdom
* Neubrandenburg, Germany
* Słupsk, Poland

==Economy and infrastructure==

===Energy===

The town has a well-established Combined Heat and Power and District Heating scheme, installed between 1970 and 1980. It is owned by the town.

===Transport===
West of Flensburg runs the A 7 Autobahn, leading north to the Danish border, whence it continues as European route E45. Federal Highways (&quot;Bundesstraßen&quot;) B 200 and B 199 also pass through the municipal area.

West of the town lies the Flensburg-Schäferhaus airport.

Local transport is provided by several buslines, including Aktiv Bus GmbH and Allgemeinen Flensburger Autobus Gesellschaft (AFAG). They all operate on an integrated fare system within the Flensburg transport community (&quot;Verkehrsgemeinschaft Flensburg&quot;). They also all subscribe to the Schleswig-Holstein tariff system, whereby anyone travelling from anywhere in Schleswig-Holstein or Hamburg may use Flensburg buses free to connect with their final destinations. This works both ways: a rider boarding any bus in Flensburg need only name a destination anywhere in Schleswig-Holstein or Hamburg, pay the fare, and travel to that destination on one ticket.

The Flensburg station opened in 1927 south of the Old Town. From there, trains run on the main line to Neumünster, Hamburg, and Fredericia, among them some InterCity connections as well as trains serving the line running to Eckernförde and Kiel. Another stop for regional trains to Neumünster is in Flensburg-Weiche. The stretch of line to Niebüll has been out of service since 1981, efforts to open it again notwithstanding. The secondary line to Husum and lesser lines to Kappeln and Satrup no longer exist. The tramway, which opened in 1881 to horse-drawn trams, was electrified in 1906, and at one point ran four lines, was replaced by buses in 1973.

===Media===

In Flensburg, the &quot;Flensburger Tageblatt&quot;, from the &quot;Schleswig-Holsteinischer Zeitungsverlag&quot; (newspaper publisher) is published daily, as is the bilingual (German and Danish) &quot;Flensborg Avis&quot;. There are also two weekly advertising flyers, &quot;MoinMoin&quot; (named for a common regional greeting) and &quot;Wochenschau&quot; (&quot;Newsweek&quot;) as well as an illustrated town paper (&quot;Flensburg Journal&quot;), the Flensburg &quot;campus newspaper&quot; and a town magazine (&quot;Partout&quot;). Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) runs one of its oldest studios near the Deutsches Haus. Flensburg is the site of a number of radio transmission facilities: on the Fuchsberg in the community of Engelsby, Norddeutscher Rundfunk runs a transmission facility for VHF, television and medium wave. A cage aerial is mounted on a guyed, earthed steel-lattice mast. This transmitter is successor to the Flensburg transmitter through which Germany&#x27;s surrender was announced on 8 May 1945.

The broadcasting tower on the Fuchsberg is used for the programmes of Norddeutscher Rundfunk and Danmarks Radio while the countrywide VHF radio programmes of R.SH, delta radio, Deutschlandfunk and Deutschlandradio air from the Flensburg-Freienwill tower.

Flensburg has no local transmitter of its own because Schleswig-Holstein&#x27;s state broadcasting laws allow only transmitters that broadcast statewide. From 1993 to 1996, &quot;Radio Flensburg&quot; tried to establish a local Flensburg radio station by using a local transmitter just across the border in Denmark, but it had to be shut down, owing to the Danish transmitter&#x27;s own financial problems. Since October 2006, Radio Flensburg has broadcast as internet radio.

The &quot;Offener Kanal&quot; (&quot;Open Channel&quot;) shows programmes made by local citizens seven days a week, mostly in the evenings, and can also be seen on cable television.

===Public institutions===
Flensburg is home to the following institutions:
*Handwerkskammer Flensburg (Chamber of Skilled Crafts)
*IHK Flensburg (Chamber of Trade and Industry)
*Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (federal government office for road traffic)

===Education===
* University of Flensburg has about 6,000 students as of 2019/20. Founded in 1946 as a pedagogical college, it became a university in 1994. Unlike the much larger University of Kiel it is not a full university; theology, medicine, law and some other programs are not offered here. But it does have the right to confer doctorates.
* Flensburg University of Applied Sciences is a Fachhochschule with more than 3,000 students. Its origins lie in a royal steamship machinist school, which was established in 1886. Over time, it developed into a ship&#x27;s engineers&#x27; school. From this grew the &quot;Fachhochschule for Technology&quot;, which was converted into the Fachhochschule Flensburg in 1973. At this time the economics program was introduced. In May 2016, the University decided to change its name to Flensburg University of Applied Sciences.
* Marineschule Mürwik (Naval Academy at Mürwik), the main educational establishment for all German Navy officers.
* Flensburger Volkshochschule (German Folk high school)
* Voksenundervisningen (Danish)

Also in Flensburg is a complete range of training and professional schools, including a number of Danish ones. Flensburg is home to Schleswig-Holstein&#x27;s Central State Library, a university library, a town bookshop and the Danish Central Library for South Schleswig, which offers not only intensive courses in Danish, but also, with its &quot;Slesvigsk samling&quot; collection, a vast repository of unique material about the border area&#x27;s history and culture. Flensburg has an extensive town archive. The Danish minority&#x27;s archive is housed at the Danish Central Library.

===Buildings===

Flensburg has a well-preserved Old Town with many things to see from centuries past. Characteristic is the row along the waterfront. Three of the four old town cores are along this north–south axis. The building boom in imperial times led to a partial rebuilding of the Old Town, but without destroying its structure, and leading to notable expansion of the town. Virtually unscathed in the Second World War, Flensburg, like other places in Germany, adopted a policy of getting rid of old buildings and rebuilding in the style of the time. Lack of money limited this trend in Flensburg, but before the policy ended in the late 1970s, countless old buildings had been demolished in the north and east Old Town, to be replaced by newer structures. Despite great losses, Flensburg still has a compact, well-preserved Old Town in the valley with good additions to what was built in the founders&#x27; time on the surrounding heights.

<text>An amusement arcade, also known as a video arcade, amusements, arcade, or penny arcade (an older term), is a venue where people play arcade games, including arcade video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games, merchandisers (such as claw cranes), or coin-operated billiards or air hockey tables. In some countries, some types of arcades are also legally permitted to provide gambling machines such as slot machines or &quot;pachinko&quot; machines. Games are usually housed in cabinets.

Video games were introduced in amusement arcades in the late 1970s and were most popular during the golden age of arcade video games, the early 1980s.

==History==
===Penny arcade===


A penny arcade can be any type of venue for coin-operated devices, usually for entertainment. The term came into use about 1905–1910. The name derives from the penny, once a staple coin for the machines. The machines used included:

* bagatelles, a game with elements of billiards and non-electrical pinball,
* early forms of non-electrical pinball machines,
* fortune-telling machinery,
* slot machines,
* coin-operated Amberolas
* peep show machines (in the original, non-pornographic, usage of the term), which allowed the viewer to see various objects and pictures
* Mutoscopes
* love tester machines.
* coin-operated shooter games and gun games

Between the 1940s and 1960s, mechanical arcade games evolved into electro-mechanical games (EM games). Popular examples of EM games in the 1960s included shooters such as Sega&#x27;s &quot;Periscope&quot; (1965) and &quot;Rifleman&quot; (1967), and racing games such as Kasco&#x27;s &quot;Indy 500&quot; (1968) and Chicago Coin&#x27;s &quot;Speedway&quot; (1969). Penny arcades later led to the creation of video arcades in the 1970s.

===1970s and 1980s===
Video game arcades began to gain momentum in the late 1970s with games such as &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978) and &quot;Galaxian&quot; (1979) and became widespread in 1980 with &quot;Pac-Man,&quot; &quot;Centipede&quot; and others. The central processing unit in these games allowed for more complexity than earlier discrete-circuitry games such as Atari&#x27;s &quot;Pong&quot; (1972).

During the late 1970s video-arcade game technology had become sophisticated enough to offer good-quality graphics and sounds, but it remained fairly basic (realistic images and full motion video were not yet available, and only a few games used spoken voice) and so the success of a game had to rely on simple and fun gameplay. This emphasis on the gameplay explains why many of these games continue to be enjoyed today, despite the progress made by modern computing technology.

The golden age of arcade video games in the 1980s became a peak era of video arcade game popularity, innovation, and earnings. Color arcade games became more prevalent and video arcades themselves started appearing outside their traditional bowling-alley and bar locales. Designers experimented with a wide variety of game genres, while developers still had to work within strict limits of available processor-power and memory. The era saw the rapid spread of video arcades across North America, Western Europe and Japan. The number of video-game arcades in North America, for example, more than doubled between 1980 and 1982, reaching a peak of 13,000 video game arcades across the region (compared to 4,000 today). Beginning with &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, video arcade games also started to appear in supermarkets, restaurants, liquor stores, filling stations and many other retail establishments looking for extra income. This boom came to an end in the mid-1980s, in what has been referred to as &quot;the great coin-op video crash of 1983&quot;.

On November 30, 1982, Jerry Parker, the Mayor of Ottumwa, Iowa, declared his city the &quot;Video Game Capital of the World&quot;. This initiative resulted in many firsts in video game history. Playing a central role in arcade history, Ottumwa saw the birth of the Twin Galaxies Intergalactic Scoreboard and the U.S. National Video Game Team, two organizations that still exist today. Other firsts that happened in the Video Game Capital of the World included:
* the first video-game-themed parade (Jan. 8, 1983)
* the first video game world championship (Jan. 8–9, 1983)
* the first study of the brain waves of video-game champions (July 12, 1983)
* the first billion-point video-game performance (Jan. 16, 1984)
* the first official day to honor a video-game player (Jan. 28, 1984)

High game-turnover in Japanese arcades required quick game-design, leading to the adoption of standardized systems like JAMMA, Neo-Geo and CPS-2. These systems essentially provided arcade-only consoles where the video game ROM could be swapped easily to replace a game. This allowed easier development and replacement of games, but it also discouraged the hardware innovation necessary to stay ahead of the technology curve.

Most US arcades didn&#x27;t see the intended benefit of this practice since many games weren&#x27;t exported to the US, and if they were, distributors generally refused to release them as simply a ROM, preferring to sell the entire ROM, console, and sometimes the cabinet as a package. In fact, several arcade systems such as Sega&#x27;s NAOMI board are arcade versions of home systems.

Other problems were that many arcades focused on quantity more than quality, and that games showed a rising difficulty curve, making them increasingly inaccessible to casual players and more expensive for the skilled players.

===1990s===
The rise of the fighting game genre with games such as &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, combined with the release of popular sports titles such as &quot;NBA Jam&quot; and &quot;NFL Blitz&quot;, led to a brief resurgence in the popularity of video arcades, with new locations opening in shopping malls and strip malls throughout the country in the early 90s.

The arcade industry entered a major slump in mid-1994. Arcade attendance and per-visit spending, though not as poor as during the 1983 crash, declined to the point where several of the largest arcade chains either were put up for sale or declared bankruptcy, while many large arcade machine manufacturers likewise moved to get out of the business. In the second quarter of 1996, video game factories reported 90,000 arcade cabinets sold, as compared to 150,000 cabinets sold in 1990.

The main reason for the slump was increasing competition from console ports. During the 1980s it typically took several years for an arcade game to be released on a home console, and the port usually differed greatly from the arcade version; during the mid-1990s it became common for a game publisher to release a highly accurate port of an arcade game that had yet to peak in popularity, thus severely cutting into arcade owners&#x27; profits.

===2000s and beyond===
In the late 1990s, a bar opened in the new Crown Casino complex in Melbourne, Australia named &quot;Barcode&quot;. Barcode was a &#x27;games bar&#x27; with the latest arcade games, the classics, pool tables, air hockey and pinball machines which players could play while consuming alcohol. The bar was very popular with other bars later opening in the early 2000s in King Street alongside the strip clubs and at the shopping centre Melbourne Central. A Barcode opened in Times Square, New York in May 2000 and was very popular, with the launch featuring on an episode of TV series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. Barcode Times Square closed in March 2003. Barcode Crown Casino closed in 2006, followed later by King Street and Melbourne Central.

In the mid-2000s, Madrid businessman Enrique Martínez updated the video arcade for the new generation by creating a &quot;hybrid movie theater with...fog, black light, flashing green lasers, high-definition digital projectors, vibrating seats, game pads and dozens of 17-inch screens attached to individual chairs.&quot; At the Yelmo Cineplex in Spain, $390,000 was spent refitting a theater into a &quot;high-tech video gaming hall seating about 50 people.&quot; In Germany, the CinemaxX movie theater company was in 2007 also considering this approach. It conducted a four-month trial with video games to test the level of demand for video gaming in a theater setting.

Manufacturers started adding innovative features to games in the 2000s. Konami used motion and position sensing of the player in &quot;Police 911&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Mocap Boxing&quot; in 2001. Sega started using &quot;Tuning cards&quot; in games such as the &quot;Initial D&quot; series of games allowing the customer to save game data on a card vended from the game; Namco copied the idea with the &quot;Maximum Tune&quot; series. Arcade games continued to use a variety of games with enhanced features to attract clients, such as motorized seating areas, interconnected games, and surround sound systems. Redemption and merchandiser games are also a staple of arcades in the 2000s. One of the most popular redemption games, &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; by ICE, simulates the popular television game show. Merchandiser games such as Stacker by LAI Games gives the player the chance to win high end prizes like iPods and video game consoles.

At the same time as these innovations, a small resurgence in the interest of classic video games and arcades grew with the opening of Barcade in Brooklyn, New York in 2004. Barcade combined a video arcade and a full bar, with a strict focus on classic machines from the 1970s and 1980s, known as the golden age of arcade video games. The idea proved popular and Barcade received recognition as a good place to play classic video game cabinets, because it is &quot;one of the few places where classic arcade games can still be found in public, and in good working order.&quot; Barcade&#x27;s success influenced other similarly themed businesses which opened across the country. Other arcades, like Ground Kontrol in Portland, Oregon, began including full bars in their arcades. Even regular bars added classic arcade games to their venues.

As the trend grew, the industry and press looked for ways to classify these arcade bar hybrids, with the DNA Association branding them &quot;social-tainment&quot; and also referring to them as &quot;game bars&quot;. Many of these newer game bars proved to be popular and expansion continued.

In the UK, classic arcades such as Casino and Trocadero, both located in London, closed, with some of the games from Trocadero finding their way to a new arcade, Heart of Gaming in North Acton. The newer Loading Soho Gaming Cafe features arcade machines manufactured by Bespoke Arcades for its customers to use. The UK is also home to the largest arcade in Europe, Arcade Club, located in Bury, Greater Manchester. Home to over 400 original arcade machines, it is recognised as the largest collection in Europe. In May 2019 Arcade Club opened a second venue in Leeds with a third announced for Blackpool opening in 2020.

==Types of games==
===Video games===
The video games are typically in arcade cabinets. The most common kind are &quot;uprights&quot;, tall boxes with a monitor and controls in front. Customers insert coins or tokens into the machines (or, in newer models, use credit cards or mobile devices) and stand in front of them to play the game. These traditionally were the most popular arcade format, although presently American arcades make much more money from deluxe driving games and ticket redemption games. However, Japanese arcades, while also heavily featuring deluxe games, continue to do well with traditional JAMMA arcade video games.

Some machines, such as &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; and &quot;Joust&quot;, are occasionally in smaller boxes with a flat, clear glass or acrylic glass top; the player sits at the machine playing it, looking down. This style of arcade game is known as a &quot;cocktail-style arcade game table&quot; or tabletop arcade machine, since they were first popularized in bars and pubs. For two player games on this type of machine, the players sit on opposite sides with the screen flipped upside down for each player. A few cocktail-style games had players sitting next to rather than across from one another. Both &quot;Joust&quot; and &quot;Gun Fight&quot; had these type of tables.

Some arcade games, such as racing games, are designed to be sat in or on. These types of games are sometimes referred to as &quot;sit-down&quot; games. Sega and Namco are two of the largest manufacturers of these types of arcade games.
===Other games===
Other games include pinball machines, redemption games and merchandiser games. Pinball machines have a tilted, glass-covered play area in which the player uses mechanical flippers to direct a heavy metal ball towards lighted targets. Redemption games reward winners with tickets that can be redeemed for prizes such as toys or novelty items. The prizes are usually displayed behind a counter or in a glass showcase, and an arcade employee gives the items to players after counting their tickets. Merchandiser games reward winners with prizes such as stuffed toys, CDs, DVDs, or candy which are dispensed directly from the machine.

In some countries, some types of video arcades are legally allowed to provide gambling machines such as slot machines and pachinko machines. Large arcades may also have small coin-operated ride-on toys for small children. Some businesses, such as Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s, combine a bar and restaurant with a video arcade. The ROUND1 entertainment chain combines a large arcade with a full-service bowling alley, along with billiards and karaoke.

Arcades typically have change machines to dispense tokens or quarters when bills are inserted, although larger chain arcades, such as Dave and Busters and Chuck E. Cheese are deviating towards a refillable card system. Retro Arcades are going towards a pay by admission system with the games themselves set to free play. Arcades may also have vending machines which sell soft drinks, candy, and chips. Arcades may play recorded music or a radio station over a public address system. Video arcades typically have subdued lighting to inhibit glare on the screen and enhance the viewing of the games&#x27; video displays, as well as of any decorative lighting on the cabinets.

<text>There are 23 counties and one independent city in the U.S. state of Maryland. Many of the counties in Maryland were named for relatives of the Barons Baltimore, who were the proprietors of the Maryland colony from its founding in 1634 through 1771. The Barons Baltimore were Catholic, and George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, originally intended that the colony be a haven for English Catholics, though for most of its history Maryland has had a majority of Protestants.

Though formally an independent city rather than a county, the City of Baltimore is considered the equal of a county for most purposes and is functionally a county-equivalent in most respects.

==History==
The most recent county formation in Maryland occurred in 1872 when Garrett County was split from Allegany County. However, there have been numerous changes to county borders since that time, most recently when portions of the city of Takoma Park that had previously been part of Prince George&#x27;s County were absorbed into Montgomery County in 1997.

Within Maryland the county is the default unit of local government. Under Maryland law, counties exercise powers reserved in most other states at the municipal or state levels. Many of the state&#x27;s most populous and economically important communities, such as Bethesda, Silver Spring, Columbia, and Towson are unincorporated and receive their municipal services from the county. In fact, there are no incorporated municipalities at all in Baltimore County or Howard County. The county-equivalent is also the provider of public schools as school districts do not exist as a separate level of government in Maryland.

The City of Baltimore is an entity nearly surrounded by but separate from the County of Baltimore. The City has been considered on par with the counties within the state since it became an independent city after it separated from Baltimore County in 1851.

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry. Maryland&#x27;s code is 24, which when combined with any county code would be written as 24XXX. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county.

<text>Brewster Lurton Kahle ( ; born October 21, 1960) is an American digital librarian, computer engineer, Internet entrepreneur, and advocate of universal access to all knowledge. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1982 with a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science and engineering. Kahle founded the Internet Archive and co-founded Alexa Internet in 1996. He was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Biography==

=== Early life and education ===
Kahle was born in New York City and raised in Scarsdale, New York, the son of Margaret Mary (Lurton) and Robert Vinton Kahle, a mechanical engineer. He went to Scarsdale High School. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1982, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in computer science and engineering, where he was a member of Chi Phi fraternity. The emphasis of his studies was artificial intelligence; he studied under Marvin Minsky and W. Daniel Hillis.

=== Career ===
After graduation, Kahle joined the Thinking Machines team, where he was the lead engineer on the company&#x27;s main product, the Connection Machine, for six years (1983–1989). There, he and others developed the WAIS system, the first Internet distributed search and document retrieval system, a precursor to the World Wide Web. In 1992, he co-founded, with Bruce Gilliat, WAIS, Inc. (sold to AOL in 1995 for $15 million), and, in 1996, Alexa Internet (sold to Amazon.com in 1999 for $250 million in stock). At the same time as he started Alexa, he founded the Internet Archive, which he continues to direct.

In 2001, he implemented the Wayback Machine, which allows public access to the World Wide Web archive that the Internet Archive has been gathering since 1996. Kahle was inspired to create the Wayback Machine after visiting the offices of Alta Vista, where he was struck by the immensity of the task being undertaken and achieved: to store and index everything that was on the Web. Kahle states: &quot;I was standing there, looking at this machine that was the size of five or six Coke machines, and there was an &#x27;aha moment&#x27; that said, &#x27;You can do everything.&#x27;

Kahle and his wife, Mary Austin, run the Kahle/Austin Foundation. The Foundation supports the Free Software Foundation for its GNU Project, among other projects, with a total giving of about $4.5 million in 2011.

In 2012, Kahle and banking veteran Jordan Modell established Internet Archive Federal Credit Union to serve people in New Brunswick, N.J. and Highland Park, New Jersey, as well as participants in programs that alleviate poverty in those areas. Following legal violations and a cease-and-desist from the National Credit Union Administration, the credit union was liquidated in December 2015.

=== Social reception ===
Kahle was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering (2010) for archiving, and making available, all forms of digital information. He is also a member of the Internet Hall of Fame, a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Kahle serves on the boards of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Public Knowledge, the European Archive (now Internet memory) and the Television Archive. He is a member of the advisory board of the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program of the Library of Congress, and is a member of the National Science Foundation Advisory Committee for Cyberinfrastructure.

In 2010, Kahle received an honorary doctorate from Simmons University.

== Career emphasis ==

===Digitization advocacy===
In 1997, Kahle explained that apart from the value for historians&#x27; use of these digital archives, they might also help resolve some common infrastructure complaints about the Internet, such as adding reliability to &quot;404 Document not found&quot; errors, contextualizing information to make it more trustworthy, and maintaining navigation to aid in finding related content. Kahle also explained the importance of packaging enough meta-data (information about the information) into the archive, since it is unknown what future researchers will be interested in, and that it might be more problematic to find data than to preserve it.

Kahle has been critical of Google&#x27;s book digitization, especially of Google&#x27;s exclusivity in restricting other search engines&#x27; digital access to the books they archive. In a 2011 talk Kahle described Google&#x27;s &#x27;snippet&#x27; feature as a means of tiptoeing around copyright issues, and expressed his frustration with the lack of a decent lending system for digital materials. He said the digital transition has moved from local control to central control, non-profit to for-profit, diverse to homogeneous, and from &quot;ruled by law&quot; to &quot;ruled by contract&quot;. Kahle stated that even public-domain material published before 1923, and not bound by copyright law, is still bound by Google&#x27;s contracts and requires permission to be distributed or copied. Kahle reasoned that this trend has emerged for a number of reasons: distribution of information favoring centralization, the economic cost of digitizing books, the issue of library staff without the technical knowledge to build these services, and the decision of administrators to outsource information services.

Kahle advocated in 2009:

It&#x27;s not that expensive. For the cost of 60 miles of highway, we can have a 10 million-book digital library available to a generation that is growing up reading on-screen. Our job is to put the best works of humankind within reach of that generation. Through a simple Web search, a student researching the life of John F. Kennedy should be able to find books from many libraries, and many booksellers—and not be limited to one private library whose titles are available for a fee, controlled by a corporation that can dictate what we are allowed to read.

===Physical media===
&quot;Knowledge lives in lots of different forms over time,&quot; Kahle said in 2011. &quot;First it was in people&#x27;s memories, then it was in manuscripts, then printed books, then microfilm, CD-ROMs, now on the digital internet. Each one of these generations is very important.&quot; Voicing a strong reaction to the idea of books simply being thrown away, and inspired by the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, Kahle envisioned collecting one physical copy of every book ever published. &quot;We&#x27;re not going to get there, but that&#x27;s our goal,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to see books live forever.&quot; Pointing out that even digital books have a physical home on a hard drive somewhere, he sees saving the physical artifacts of information storage as a way to hedge against the uncertainty of the future. Alongside the books, Kahle plans to store the Internet Archive&#x27;s old servers, which were replaced in 2010.

Kahle began by having conventional shipping containers modified as climate-controlled storage units. Each container can hold about 40,000 volumes, the size of a branch library. As of 2011, Kahle had gathered about 500,000 books. He thinks the warehouse is large enough to hold about a million titles, with each one given a barcode that identifies the cardboard box, pallet and shipping container in which it resides. A given book may be retrieved in about an hour, not to be loaned out but to be used to verify contents recorded in another medium. Book preservation experts commented he will have to contend with vermin and about a century&#x27;s worth of books printed on wood pulp paper that disintegrates over time because of its own acidity. Peter Hanff, deputy director of UC Berkeley&#x27;s Bancroft Library, said that just keeping the books on the west coast of the US will save them from the climate fluctuations that are the norm in other parts of the country.

<doc id="88380" wikidata="Q269770" url="?curid=88380" title="Boarding school">
<text>A boarding school is a school where pupils live within premises while being given formal instruction. The word &quot;boarding&quot; is used in the sense of &quot;room and board&quot;, i.e. lodging and meals. They have existed for many centuries, and now extend across many countries. Their functioning, codes of conduct, and ethos vary greatly. Children in boarding schools study and live during the school year with their fellow students and possibly teachers or administrators. Some boarding schools also have day students who attend the institution during the day and return home in the evenings.

Boarding school pupils are typically referred to as &quot;boarders&quot;. Children may be sent for one to twelve years or more in boarding school, until the age of eighteen. There are several types of boarders depending on the intervals at which they visit their family. Full-term boarders visit their homes at the end of an academic year, semester boarders visit their homes at the end of an academic term, weekly boarders visit their homes at weekends. There are also semi-boarders who attend a boarding school in the school hours for formal instruction and activities but return home by the end of the day. In some cultures, boarders spend the majority of their childhood and adolescent life away from their families.

Boarding schools are relatively more prevalent in the United Kingdom, India, China, and parts of Africa. These countries begin boarding schools at a very early age and for a longer span of time. Boarding schools are less prevalent in Europe and the U.S., where it is mostly seen for grades seven or nine through grade twelve—the high school years. Some are for either boys or girls, while others are co-educational. The United Kingdom has a long tradition of boarding school education, and the term public school has an elitist association. There are also some state boarding schools, many of which serve children from remote areas.

In some societies and cultures, boarding schools are the most privileged educational option (such as Eton and Winchester in the U.K., which have produced several prime ministers), whereas in other contexts, they serve as places to segregate children deemed a problem to their parents or wider society.

The United States and Canada forcibly assimilated indigenous children in the Canadian Indian residential school system and American Indian boarding school institutions. Some functioned essentially as orphanages, e.g. the G.I. Rossolimo Boarding School Number 49 in Russia. Tens of millions of rural children are educated at boarding schools in China. Therapeutic boarding schools offer treatment for psychological difficulties. Military academies provide strict discipline. Education for children with special needs has a long association with boarding; see, for example, deaf education and Council of Schools and Services for the Blind. Some boarding schools offer an immersion into democratic education, such as Summerhill School. Others are international, such as the United World Colleges.

==Description==
===Typical characteristics===
The term &quot;boarding school&quot; often refers to classic British boarding schools and many boarding schools around the world which are modeled on these.

====House system====


A typical boarding school has several separate residential houses, either within the school grounds or in the surrounding area.

A number of senior teaching staff are appointed as housemasters, housemistresses, dorm parents, prefects, or residential advisors, each of whom takes quasi-parental responsibility (&quot;in loco parentis&quot;) for anywhere from 5 to 50 students resident in their &quot;house&quot; or dormitory at all times but particularly outside school hours. Each may be assisted in the domestic management of the house by a housekeeper often known in U.K. or Commonwealth countries as &quot;matron&quot;, and by a &quot;house tutor&quot; for academic matters, often providing staff of each gender. In the U.S., boarding schools often have a resident family that lives in the dorm, known as dorm parents. They often have janitorial staff for maintenance and housekeeping, but typically do not have tutors associated with an individual dorm. Nevertheless, older students are often less supervised by staff, and a system of monitors or prefects gives limited authority to senior students. Houses readily develop distinctive characters, and a healthy rivalry between houses is often encouraged in sport.

Houses or dorms usually include study-bedrooms or dormitories, a dining room or refectory where students take meals at fixed times, a library and possibly study carrels where students can do their homework. Houses may also have common rooms for television and relaxation and kitchens for snacks, and occasionally storage facilities for bicycles or other sports equipment. Some facilities may be shared between several houses or dorms.

In some schools, each house has students of all ages, in which case there is usually a prefect system, which gives older students some privileges and some responsibility for the welfare of the younger ones. In others, separate houses accommodate the needs of different years or classes. In some schools, day students are assigned to a dorm or house for social activities and sports purposes.

Most school dormitories have an &quot;in your room by&quot; and a &quot;lights out&quot; time, depending on their age when the students are required to prepare for bed, after which no talking is permitted. Such rules may be difficult to enforce; students may often try to break them, for example by using their laptop computers or going to another student&#x27;s room to talk or play computer games. International students may take advantage of the time difference between countries (e.g. 7 hours between China and the U.K.) to contact friends or family. Students sharing study rooms are less likely to disturb others and may be given more latitude.

====Other facilities====
As well as the usual academic facilities such as classrooms, halls, libraries, and laboratories, boarding schools often provide a wide variety of facilities for extracurricular activities such as music rooms, gymnasiums, sports fields and school grounds, boats, squash courts, swimming pools, cinemas, and theaters. A school chapel is often found on site. Day students often stay on after school to use these facilities. Many North American boarding schools are located in beautiful rural environments and have a combination of architectural styles that vary from modern to hundreds of years old.

Food quality can vary from school to school, but most boarding schools offer diverse menu choices for many kinds of dietary restrictions and preferences. Some boarding schools have a dress code for specific meals like dinner or for specific days of the week. Students are generally free to eat with friends, teammates, as well as with faculty and coaches. Extra curricular activities groups, e.g. the French Club, may have meetings and meals together. The Dining Hall often serves as a central place where lessons and learning can continue between students and teachers or other faculty mentors or coaches. Some schools welcome day students to attend breakfast and dinner, in addition to the standard lunch, while others charge a fee.

Many boarding schools have an on-campus school store or snack hall where additional food and school supplies can be purchased; may also have a student recreational center where food can be purchased during specified hours.

Boarding schools also have infirmary, a small room with first aid or other emergencies medical aid.

====Time====
Students generally need permission to go outside defined school bounds; they may be allowed to travel off-campus at certain times.

Depending on country and context, boarding schools generally offer one or more options: full (students stay at the school full-time), weekly (students stay in the school from Monday through Friday, then return home for the weekend), or on a flexible schedule (students choose when to board, e.g. during exam week).

Each student has an individual timetable, which in the early years allows little discretion. Boarders and day students are taught together in school hours and in most cases continue beyond the school day to include sports, clubs and societies, or excursions.

British boarding schools have three terms a year, approximately twelve weeks each, with a few days&#x27; half-term holidays during which students are expected to go home or at least away from school. There may be several exeats, or weekends, in each half of the term when students may go home or away (e.g. international students may stay with their appointed guardians, or with a host family). Boarding students nowadays often go to school within easy traveling distance of their homes, and so may see their families frequently; e.g. families are encouraged to come and support school sports teams playing at home against other schools, or for school performances in music, drama, or theatre. It is recommended that international boarding school students have an appointed educational guardian.

Some boarding schools allow only boarding students, while others have both boarding students and day students who go home at the end of the school day. Day students are sometimes known as day boys or day girls. Some schools welcome day students to attend breakfast and dinner, while others charge a fee. For schools that have designated study hours or quiet hours in the evenings, students on campus (including day students) are usually required to observe the same &quot;quiet&quot; rules (such as no television, students must stay in their rooms, library or study hall, etc.). Schools that have both boarding and day students sometimes describe themselves as semi-boarding schools or day boarding schools. Some schools also have students who board during the week but go home on weekends: these are known as weekly boarders, quasi-boarders, or five-day boarders.

===Other forms of boarding schools===


Boarding schools are residential schools; however, not all residential schools are &quot;classic&quot; boarding schools. Other forms of residential schools include:
* Therapeutic boarding schools are tuition-based, out-of-home placements that combine therapy and education for children, usually teenagers, with emotional, behavioral, substance abuse, or learning disabilities.
* Traveling boarding schools, such as Think Global School, are four-year high schools that immerse the students in a new city each term. Traveling boarding schools partner with a host school within the city to provide the living and educational facilities.
* Sailing boarding schools, such as A+ World Academy, are high schools based on ships that sail around the world and combine high school education with travel, and personal development. Classes typically take place both, onboard and in some of the ports they visit.
* Outdoor boarding schools, which teach students independence and self-reliance through survival style camp outs and other outdoor activities.
* Residential education programs, which provide a stable and supportive environment for at-risk children.
* Residential schools for students with special educational needs, who may or may not be disabled
* Semester schools, which complement a student&#x27;s secondary education by providing a one semester residential experience with a central focusing curricular theme—which may appeal to students and families uninterested in a longer residential education experience
* Specialist schools focused on a particular academic discipline, such as the public North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics or the private Interlochen Arts Academy.
* The Israeli youth villages, where children stay and are educated in a commune, but also have everyday contact with their parents at specified hours.
* Public boarding schools, which are operated by public school districts. In the U.S., general-attendance public boarding schools were once numerous in rural areas, but are extremely rare today. As of the 2013–2014 school year, the SEED Foundation administered public charter boarding schools in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland. One rural public boarding school is Crane Union High School in Crane, Oregon. Around two-thirds of its more than 80 students, mostly children from remote ranches, board during the school week in order to save a one-way commute of up to across Harney County.
* Ranch school, once common in the western United States, incorporating aspects of the &quot;dude ranch&quot; (Guest ranch)

===Applicable regulations===
In the U.K., most boarding schools are independent schools, which are not subject to the national curriculum or other educational regulations applicable to state schools. Nevertheless, there are some regulations, primarily for health and safety purposes, as well as the general law. The Department for Children, Schools and Families, in conjunction with the Department of Health of the United Kingdom, has prescribed guidelines for boarding schools, called the National Boarding Standards.

One example of regulations covered within the National Boarding Standards are those for the minimum floor area or living space required for each student and other aspects of basic facilities. The minimum floor area of a dormitory accommodating two or more students is defined as the number of students sleeping in the dormitory multiplied by 4.2 m2, plus 1.2 m2. A minimum distance of 0.9 m should also be maintained between any two beds in a dormitory, bedroom, or cubicle. In case students are provided with a cubicle, then each student must be provided with a window and a floor area of 5.0 m2 at the least. A bedroom for a single student should be at least of the floor area of 6.0 m2. Boarding schools must provide a total floor area of at least 2.3 m2 living accommodation for every boarder. This should also be incorporated with at least one bathtub or shower for every ten students.

==History==
Boarding schools manifest themselves in different ways in different societies. For example, in some societies children enter at an earlier age than in others. In some societies, a tradition has developed in which families send their children to the same boarding school for generations. One observation that appears to apply globally is that a significantly larger number of boys than girls attend boarding school and for a longer span of time. The practice of sending children, particularly boys, to other families or to schools so that they could learn together is of very long-standing, recorded in classical literature and in U.K. records going back over 1,000 years.

In Europe, a practice developed by early medieval times of sending boys to be taught by literate clergymen, either in monasteries or as pages in great households. The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury, arguably the world&#x27;s oldest boarding school, dates its foundation from the development of the monastery school in around 597 AD. The author of the &quot;Croyland Chronicle&quot; recalls being tested on his grammar by Edward the Confessor&#x27;s wife Queen Editha in the abbey cloisters as a Westminster schoolboy, in around the 1050s. Monastic schools as such were generally dissolved with the monasteries themselves under Henry VIII, although Westminster School was specifically preserved by the King&#x27;s letters patent, and it seems likely that most schools were immediately replaced. Winchester College founded by Bishop William of Wykeham in 1382 and Oswestry School founded by David Holbache in 1407 are the oldest boarding schools in continuous operation.

===United Kingdom===
Boarding schools in Britain started in medieval times when boys were sent to be educated by literate clerics at a monastery or noble household. In the 12th century, the Pope ordered all Benedictine monasteries such as Westminster to provide charity schools, and many public schools started when such schools attracted paying students. These public schools reflected the collegiate universities of Oxford and Cambridge, as in many ways they still do, and were accordingly staffed almost entirely by clergymen until the 19th century. Private tuition at home remained the norm for aristocratic families, and for girls in particular, but after the 16th century, it was increasingly accepted that adolescents of any rank might best be educated collectively. The institution has thus adapted itself to changing social circumstances over 1,000 years.

Boarding preparatory schools tend to reflect the public schools they feed. They often have a more or less official tie to particular schools.

The classic British boarding school became highly popular during the colonial expansion of the British Empire. British colonial administrators abroad could ensure that their children were brought up in British culture at public schools at home in the U.K., and local rulers were offered the same education for their sons. More junior expatriates would send their children to local British-run schools, which would also admit selected local children who might travel from considerable distances. The boarding schools, which inculcated their own values, became an effective way to encourage local people to share British ideals, and so help the British achieve their imperial goals.

One of the reasons sometimes stated for sending children to boarding schools is to develop wider horizons than their family can provide. A boarding school a family has attended for generations may define the culture parents aspire to for their children. Equally, by choosing a fashionable boarding school, parents may aspire to better their children by enabling them to mix on equal terms with children of the upper classes. However, such stated reasons may conceal other reasons for sending a child away from home. These might apply to children who are considered too disobedient or underachieving, children from families with divorced spouses, and children to whom the parents do not much relate. These reasons are rarely explicitly stated, though the child might be aware of them.

In 1998, there were 772 private-sector boarding schools in the United Kingdom with over 100,000 children attending them all across the country. They are an important factor in the British class system. About one percent of British children are sent to boarding schools. Also in Britain children as young as 5 to 9 years of age are sent to boarding schools.

===United States===
Before the advent of universal public education in the United States, boarding school was often the only secondary school option for students in rural New England communities. Some states, especially Massachusetts, sponsored and subsidized semi-public boarding schools, often called &quot;academies,&quot; to educate students from the surrounding rural areas. Some of the oldest remaining academies include West Nottingham Academy (est. 1744), Linden Hall (est. 1756), The Governor&#x27;s Academy (est. 1763), Phillips Academy (est. 1778), and Phillips Exeter Academy (est. 1781).

The market for semi-public academies narrowed in the second half of the nineteenth century as local governments began establishing free, public secondary day schools. Some academies joined the public school system, and others shut down. Towards the turn of the twentieth century, a new generation of boarding schools was established. These schools generally followed the British public school model and focused on preparing students aged roughly 14–18 for college entrance examinations. Because of their college-preparatory approach, they were dubbed prep schools, although most American prep schools educate only day students. At the turn of the twenty-first century, 0.5% of U.S. school children attended boarding schools, about half the percentage of British children.

In recent years, various governments have established public boarding schools. Some provide additional resources for academically promising students, like the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (est. 1980). Others provide a more focused environment for students from at-risk backgrounds.

Boarding schools for students below the age of 13 are called &quot;junior boarding schools&quot;, and are relatively uncommon. The oldest junior boarding school is the Fay School in Southborough, Massachusetts (est. 1866).

==== Native American schools ====

In the late 19th century, the United States government undertook a policy of educating Native American youth in the ways of the dominant Western culture so that Native Americans might then be able to assimilate into Western society. At these boarding schools, managed and regulated by the government, Native American students were subjected to a number of tactics to prepare them for life outside their reservation homes.

In accordance with the assimilation methods used at the boarding schools, the education that the Native American children received at these institutions centered on the dominant society&#x27;s construction of gender norms and ideals. Thus boys and girls were separated in almost every activity and their interactions were strictly regulated along the lines of Victorian ideals. In addition, the instruction that the children received reflected the roles and duties that they were to assume once outside the reservation. Thus girls were taught skills that could be used in the home, such as &quot;sewing, cooking, canning, ironing, child care, and cleaning&quot; (Adams 150). Native American boys in the boarding schools were taught the importance of an agricultural lifestyle, with an emphasis on raising livestock and agricultural skills like &quot;plowing and planting, field irrigation, the care of stock, and the maintenance of fruit orchards&quot; (Adams 149). These ideas of domesticity were in stark contrast to those existing in native communities and on reservations: many indigenous societies were based on a matrilineal system where the women&#x27;s lineage was honored and the women&#x27;s place in society respected in different ways. For example, women in native society held powerful roles in their own communities, undertaking tasks that Western society deemed only appropriate for men: indigenous women could be leaders, healers, and farmers.

While the Native American children were exposed to and were likely to adopt some of the ideals set out by the whites operating these boarding schools, many resisted and rejected the gender norms that were being imposed upon them.

===Canada===
In Canada, the largest independent boarding school is Columbia International College, with an enrollment of 1,700 students from all over the world. Robert Land Academy in Wellandport, Ontario is Canada&#x27;s only private military-style boarding school for boys in Grades 6 through 12.

===Other Commonwealth countries===

Most societies around the world decline to make boarding schools the preferred option for the upbringing of their children. However, boarding schools are one of the aspirational modes of education in some former British colonies or Commonwealth countries like India, Pakistan, Nigeria, and other former African colonies of Great Britain. For instance, in Ghana the majority of the secondary schools are boarding. In some countries, such as New Zealand and Sri Lanka, a number of state schools have boarding facilities. These state boarding schools are frequently traditional single-sex state schools, whose ethos is much like that of their independent counterparts. Furthermore, the proportion of boarders at these schools is often much lower than at independent boarding schools, typically around 10%.

=== Malaysia ===
=== Russia and former Soviet Union ===

In the former Soviet Union these schools were sometimes known as Internat-schools (Russian: &quot;Школа-интернат&quot;) (from Latin: &quot;school-internat&quot;). They varied in their organization. Some schools were a type of specialized schools with a specific focus in a particular field or fields such as mathematics, physics, language, science, sports, etc. For example, in the 1960s Soviet official established a new type of boarding school, an AESC - Advanced educational scientific center (Russian: &quot;СУНЦ - Специализированный учебно-научный центр&quot;) (SESC - Specialized Educational and Scientific Center ). Those schools were parts of some major universities and prepared students to study there. Now, only a few exist in Russia - in Moscow, Novosibirsk, and Yekaterinburg, though several boarding schools still operate in former Soviet republics, and even some new ones are being opened (e.g. MSU Gymnasium in Moscow, Russia, or Nazarbayev schools all over Kazakhstan).
Other schools were associated with orphanages after which all children enrolled in Internat-school automatically. Also, separate boarding schools were established for children with special needs (schools for the blind, deaf, and others). General schools offered &quot;extended stay&quot; programs (Russian: Группа продленного дня) featuring cheap meals for children and preventing them from coming home too early before parents were back from work (education in the Soviet Union was free). In post-Soviet countries, the concept of boarding school differs from country to country.

===Switzerland===

The Swiss government developed a strategy of fostering private boarding schools for foreign students as a business integral to the country&#x27;s economy. Their boarding schools offer instruction in several major languages and have a large number of quality facilities organized through the &quot;Swiss Federation of Private Schools&quot;. In 2015, a Swiss boarding school named A+ World Academy was established on the Norwegian Tall Ship Fullriggeren Sørlandet. Some of the most expensive boarding schools in the world include the Swiss schools Institut auf dem Rosenberg, Institut Le Rosey, Beau Soleil, Collège du Léman, Collège Champittet and Leysin American School.

===Japan===

In Japan, there are several international boarding schools operated by private institution. Notable examples of privately-run institutions include NUCB International College and Hallow International School. These boarding schools are affiliated with various educational boards, such as the IB (International Baccalaureate), A-Level, and Article1 of the Japanese School Education Law. English is predominantly used as the primary medium of instruction in these institutions.

=== China ===

 there were about 100,000 boarding schools in rural areas of Mainland China, with about 33 million children living in them. In China some children are sent to boarding schools at 2 years of age. The majority of boarding schools are in western China, which generally is not as wealthy as eastern and central China. Many migrant workers and farmers send their children to boarding schools.

===India===
In India, there exists a variety of boarding schools, which are operated by both private entities and governmental bodies at the state and central levels. Some notable examples government run institute include are Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Ekalavya Model Residential School, and Ashram Schools. Boarding schools in India are affiliated with various educational boards such as CBSE, ICSE, IB, NIOS, and AISSCE. Those institutions predominantly use English as the primary medium of instruction.

==Sociological issues==
Some elite university-preparatory boarding schools for students from age 13 to 18 are seen by sociologists as centers of socialization for the next generation of the political upper class and reproduces an elitist class system. This attracts families who value power and hierarchy for the socialization of their family members. These families share a sense of entitlement to social class or hierarchy and power.

Boarding schools are seen by certain families as centres of socialization where students mingle with others of similar social hierarchy to form what is called an old boy network. Elite boarding school students are brought up with the assumption that they are meant to control society. Significant numbers of them enter the political upper class of society or join the financial elite in fields such as international banking and venture capital. Elite boarding school socialization causes students to internalize a strong sense of entitlement and social control or hierarchy. This form of socialization is called &quot;deep structure socialization&quot; by Peter Cookson &amp; Caroline Hodges (1985). This refers to the way in which boarding schools not only manage to control the students&#x27; physical lives but also their emotional lives.

Boarding school establishment involves control of behavior regarding several aspects of life including what is appropriate and/or acceptable which adolescents would consider as intrusive. This boarding school socialization is carried over well after leaving school and into their dealings with the social world. Thus it causes boarding school students to adhere to the values of the elite social class which they come from or which they aspire to be part of. Nick Duffell, author of &quot;Wounded Leaders: British elitism and the Entitlement Illusion – A Psychohistory&quot;, states that the education of the elite in the British boarding school system leaves the nation with &quot;a cadre of leaders who perpetuate a culture of elitism, bullying and misogyny affecting the whole of society&quot;. According to Peter W Cookson Jr (2009) the elitist tradition of preparatory boarding schools has declined due to the development of modern economy and the political rise of the liberal west coast of the United States of America.

===Socialization of role control and gender stratification===
The boarding school socialization of control and hierarchy develops deep rooted and strong adherence to social roles and rigid gender stratification. In one studied school the social pressure for conformity was so severe that several students abused performance drugs like Adderall and Ritalin for both academic performance and to lose weight. The distinct and hierarchical nature of socialization in boarding school culture becomes very obvious in the manner students sit together and form cliques, especially in the refectory, or dining hall. This leads to pervasive form of explicit and implicit bullying, and excessive competition between cliques and between individuals. The rigid gender stratification and role control is displayed in the boys forming cliques on the basis of wealth and social background, and the girls overtly accepting that they would marry only for money, while choosing only rich or affluent males as boyfriends. Students are not able to display much sensitivity and emotional response and are unable to have closer relationships except on a superficial and politically correct level, engaging in social behaviour that would make them seem appropriate and rank high in social hierarchy. This affects their perceptions of gender and social roles later in life.

==Psychological issues==
The aspect of boarding school life with its round the clock habitation of students with each other in the same environment, involved in studying, sleeping, and socializing can lead to pressures and stress in boarding school life. This is manifested in the form of hypercompetitiveness, use of recreational or illegal drugs and psychological depression that at times may manifest in suicide or its attempt. Studies show that about 90% of boarding school students acknowledge that living in a total institution like boarding school has a significant impact and changed their perception and interaction with social relationships.

===Total institution and child displacement===
It is claimed that children may be sent to boarding schools to be given more opportunities than their families can provide. However, that involves spending significant parts of one&#x27;s early life in what may be seen as a total institution and possibly experiencing social detachment, as suggested by social-psychologist Erving Goffman. This may involve long-term separation from one&#x27;s parents and culture, leading to the experience of homesickness and emotional abandonment and may give rise to a phenomenon known as the &#x27;TCK&#x27; or third culture kid.

The celebrated British classicist and poet, Robert Graves (1895–1985), who attended six different preparatory schools at a young age during the early 20th century, wrote:

Some modern philosophies of education, such as constructivism and new methods of music training for children including Orff Schulwerk and the Suzuki method, make the everyday interaction of the child and parent an integral part of training and education. In children, separation involves maternal deprivation. The European Union–Canada project &quot;Child Welfare Across Borders&quot; (2003), an international venture on child development, considers boarding schools as one form of permanent displacement of the child. This view reflects a new outlook towards education and child growth in the wake of more scientific understanding of the human brain and cognitive development.

Data have not yet been tabulated regarding the statistical ratio of boys to girls that matriculate boarding schools, the total number of children in a given population in boarding schools by country, the average age across populations when children are sent to boarding schools, and the average length of education (in years) for boarding school students. There is also little evidence or research about the complete circumstances or complete set of reasons about sending kids to boarding schools.

===Boarding school syndrome===
The term &quot;boarding school syndrome&quot; was coined by psychotherapist Joy Schaverien in 2011. It is used to identify a set of lasting psychological problems that are observable in adults who, as children, were sent away to boarding schools at an early age.

Scharverien&#x27;s observations are echoed by a boarding schoolboy, George Monbiot, who goes so far as to attribute some dysfunctionalities of the U.K. government to boarding schools. British psychotherapist Nick Duffell refers to adults who have gone through boarding school separation as &#x27;Boarding school survivors&#x27;. He has described some of these individuals to exhibit behaviors such as a sense of detachment from any relationships, workaholism, compulsive behavior, and a penchant to control.

==In popular culture==
===Books===

Boarding schools and their surrounding settings and situations became in the late Victorian period a genre in British literature with its own identifiable conventions. (Typically, protagonists find themselves occasionally having to break school rules for honorable reasons the reader can identify with and might get severely punished when caught – but usually, they do not embark on a total rebellion against the school as a system.)

Notable examples of the school story include:
* Sarah Fielding&#x27;s &quot;The Governess, or The Little Female Academy&quot; (1749)
* Charles Dickens&#x27;s serialised novel &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (1838)
* Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s novels &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1847) and &quot;Villette&quot; (1853)
* Thomas Hughes&#x27;s novel &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; (1857)
* Frederic W. Farrar&#x27;s &quot;Eric, or, Little by Little&quot; (1858), a particularly religious and moralistic treatment of the theme
* L. T. Meade&#x27;s &quot;A World of Girls&quot; (1886) and dozens more girls school stories
* &quot;O Ateneu&quot; (1888), written by the Brazilian Raul Pompeia and dealing openly with the issue of homosexuality in the boarding school
* Frances Hodgson Burnett&#x27;s serial &quot;Sara Crewe: or what Happened at Miss Minchin&#x27;s&quot; (1887), revised and expanded as &quot;A Little Princess&quot; (1905)
* Greyfriars School, created by Charles Hamilton (writing as Frank Richards) in 1910 in the first of what became 1,670 stories, many featuring Billy Bunter.
* George Orwell&#x27;s essay &quot;Boys&#x27; Weeklies&quot; suggested in 1940 that Frank Richards created a taste for public schools stories in readers who could never have attended public schools
* &quot;Boy&quot; by Roald Dahl
* Dozens of boys&#x27; school novels by Gunby Hadath (1871–1954)
* Elinor Brent-Dyer&#x27;s &quot;Chalet School&quot; series of about sixty children&#x27;s novels (1925–1970)
* Erich Kästner&#x27;s &quot;The Flying Classroom&quot; (&quot;Das Fliegende Klassenzimmer&quot;) (1933) is a conspicuous non-British example.
* James Hilton&#x27;s novel &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1934) centers on a teacher, rather than on the students
* Ludwig Bemelmans&#x27; &quot;Madeline&quot; series of children&#x27;s picture books (1939–present)
* Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Cat Among the Pigeons&quot; (1959), involving a murder at a boarding school for girls
* Penelope Farmer&#x27;s &quot;Charlotte Sometimes&quot; (1969)
* In Jill Murphy&#x27;s &quot;The Worst Witch&quot; stories (from 1974), the traditional boarding school themes are explored in a fantasy school that teaches magic.
* Dianna Wynne Jones&#x27;s novel &quot;Witch Week&quot; (1982) features Larwood House where magic is not taught —its use is a capital crime— but many students grow into magic powers
* J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series (1997–2007) features Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
* Jenny Nimmo&#x27;s &quot;Children of the Red King&quot; series (2002–2009) features magically endowed children at Bloor Academy, which most students leave on weekends
* Libba Bray&#x27;s &quot;Gemma Doyle Trilogy&quot;, volumes one and two (2003, 2006), features a girl&#x27;s discovery of magical capabilities and realms
* Enid Blyton&#x27;s &quot;Malory Towers&quot;, &quot;St Clare&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Naughtiest Girl&quot; series
* John van de Ruit&#x27;s &quot;Spud&quot; book and movie series, that take place at a school based on Michaelhouse

The setting has also been featured in notable North American fiction:
* J.D. Salinger&#x27;s novel &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; (1951)
* John Knowles&#x27;s novels &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; (1959) and &quot;Peace Breaks Out&quot; (1981)
* Robert Cormier&#x27;s young adult novel &quot;The Chocolate War&quot; (1974)
* David Foster Wallace&#x27;s novel &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; (1996)
* Edward Kay&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;STAR Academy&quot; (2009)
* John Green&#x27;s 2006 young adult novel &quot;Looking for Alaska&quot;

There is also a huge boarding-school genre literature, mostly uncollected, in British comics and serials from the 1900s to the 1980s.

The subgenre of books and films set in a military or naval academy has many similarities with the above.

<text>The Institutional Revolutionary Party (, , PRI) is a political party in Mexico that was founded in 1929 as the National Revolutionary Party (, PNR), then as the Party of the Mexican Revolution (, PRM) and finally as the PRI beginning in 1946. The party held uninterrupted power in the country and controlled the presidency twice: the first one was for 71 years, from 1929 to 2000, the second was for six years, from 2012 to 2018.

The PNR was founded in 1929 by Plutarco Elías Calles, Mexico&#x27;s paramount leader at the time and self-proclaimed (Supreme Chief) of the Mexican Revolution. The party was created with the intent of providing a political space in which all the surviving leaders and combatants of the Mexican Revolution could participate to solve the severe political crisis caused by the assassination of president-elect Álvaro Obregón in 1928. Although Calles himself fell into political disgrace and was exiled in 1936, the party continued ruling Mexico until 2000, changing names twice until it became the PRI.

The PRI governed Mexico as a one-party state for the majority of the twentieth century; besides holding the Presidency of the Republic, all members of the Senate belonged to the PRI until 1976, and all state governors were also from the PRI until 1989. Throughout the seven decades that the PRI governed Mexico, the party used corporatism, co-option, electoral fraud, and political repression to maintain political power. In particular, the presidential elections of 1940, 1952 and 1988 were characterized by massive irregularities and fraudulent practices denounced by both domestic and international observers. While Mexico benefited from an economic boom which improved the quality of life of most people and created political stability during the early decades of the party&#x27;s rule, issues such as inequality, corruption, and a lack of political freedoms cultivated growing opposition against the PRI. Amid the global climate of social unrest in 1968 dissidents, primarily students, protested during the Olympic games held in Mexico City. Tensions escalated culminating in the Tlatelolco massacre in which the Mexican Army killed hundreds of unarmed demonstrators in Mexico City. Subsequently, a series of economic crises beginning in the 1970s drastically lowered the living standards of much of the country&#x27;s population.

Throughout its nine-decade existence, the party has represented a very wide array of ideologies, typically following from the policies of the President of the Republic. Formed from an amalgamation of the various ideologies of the Constitutionalists, the party originated as a centre-left party on the political spectrum. It experienced a sharp, leftward turn during the presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas who instituted extensive reforms, including the nationalization of Mexico&#x27;s petroleum and telecommunication industries. Furthermore his administration carried out extensive land reform and oversaw the largest campaign of land expropriation in Latin American history. With his term expiring in 1940 Cárdenas left office as the final military general of the revolution and returned political power to civilian leadership. His successor Manuel Ávila Camacho, presided over a rightward shift that escalated in the 1980s. At the start of the decade, the party moved to the centre-right and later right pursuing policies such as privatizing state-run companies, establishing closer relations with the Catholic Church, and embracing free-market capitalism. Subsequently, many left-wing members of the party abandoned the PRI and founded the Party of the Democratic Revolution (, PRD) in 1989 following the controversial, and fraudulent 1988 presidential election.

In 1990, Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa famously described Mexico under the PRI as being &quot;the perfect dictatorship&quot;, stating: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that there has been in Latin America any case of a system of dictatorship which has so efficiently recruited the intellectual milieu, bribing it with great subtlety. The perfect dictatorship is not communism, nor the USSR, nor Fidel Castro; the perfect dictatorship is Mexico. Because it is a camouflaged dictatorship.&quot; The phrase became popular in Mexico and around the world until the PRI fell from power in 2000.

Despite losing the presidency in the 2000 elections, and 2006 presidential candidate Roberto Madrazo finishing in third place without carrying a single state, the PRI continued to control most state governments through the 2000s and performed strongly at local levels. As a result, the PRI won the 2009 legislative election, and in 2012 its candidate Enrique Peña Nieto regained the presidency. However, dissatisfaction with corruption in Peña Nieto&#x27;s administration, the escalation of the Mexican drug war, and rising crime led to PRI going on to lose the 2018 and 2024 presidential elections with the worst performances in the party&#x27;s history.

==Overview==
===Profile===
The adherents of the PRI are known in Mexico as &quot;Priístas&quot; and the party is nicknamed &quot;El tricolor&quot; (the Tricolor) because of its use of the Mexican national colors of green, white and red as they appear on the Mexican flag.

Some scholars characterise the PRI as a &quot;state party&quot; due to its dominance of domestic politics and the inextricable connection between the party and the identity of the Mexican nation-state for much of the 20th century.

According to Austin Bay, for more than seven decades, the PRI ran Mexico under an &quot;autocratic, endemically corrupt, crony-ridden government&quot;. The elites of the PRI controlled the police and the judicial system, and were susceptible to bribery. During its time in power, the PRI became a symbol of corruption, repression, economic mismanagement, and electoral fraud; many educated Mexicans and urban dwellers in the 21st century worried that its return to power would lead to regression to its worst excesses.

The PRI became a full member of the Socialist International in 2003.
It is also considered a social democratic party.

The name &quot;Institutional Revolutionary Party&quot; appears as an oxymoron or paradox, as the term &quot;revolution&quot; may imply the destruction of institutions. According to Rubén Gallo, the concept of institutionalizing the revolution refers to the corporatist nature of the party; the PRI subsumed the &quot;disruptive energy&quot; of the Mexican Revolution by co-opting and incorporating its enemies into the party&#x27;s bureaucratic régime. 

===Party practices===
There is a lexicon of terms used to describe people and practices of the PRI, that were fully operative until the 1990s. The most important was the , with the finger () of the president pointing to the next PRI candidate for the presidency, meaning the president choosing his successor. Right up to the moment the president considered optimal, several pre-candidates would attempt to demonstrate their loyalty to the President and their high competence in their respective positions, usually as prominent members of the cabinet. Until the 2000 election, the party had no direct input into the president&#x27;s decision, although he could consult with constituencies. The president&#x27;s decision was a closely-kept secret, even from the victor.

The (the unveiling), that is, the announcement of the president&#x27;s choice, would occur at the PRI&#x27;s National Assembly (which would typically take place in November of the year prior to the elections), with losing pre-candidates learning only then themselves. Once the occurred, in general the members of the PRI would demonstrate their enthusiasm for the candidate and their loyalty to the party, known as the . But the was also a delicate moment, for party unity depended on the losers acceding to the president&#x27;s choice without public rancor or dissent. When President Miguel de la Madrid (in office: 1982 to 1988) chose Carlos Salinas de Gortari as the candidate in 1988, Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas and Porfirio Muñoz Ledo left the PRI to form a separate party, and Cárdenas challenged Salinas at the polls. The 1988 presidential election which followed is widely considered to have been fraudulent, and was confirmed as such by former president Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado and in an analysis by the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot;.

The term (alchemists) referred to PRI specialists in vote-rigging. To achieve a complete sweep of elections – the (&quot;full car&quot;) – the party used the campaign mechanism of the (&quot;hauling&quot;), the practice of trucking PRI-supporters to rallies to cheer the candidate and to polling places to cast votes – in exchange for gifts of some kind. The party would shift voting booths from one place to another, making it difficult for people to cast their votes.

==Presidential succession before the party, 1920–1928==

When it was founded in 1929, the party structure created a means to control political power and to perpetuate it with regular elections validating the party&#x27;s choice. Before the party was founded, political parties were not generally the means in which to achieve the presidency. The creation of the party in the wake of the assassination of revolutionary general, former president, and in 1928 president-elect Alvaro Obregón had laid bare the problem of presidential succession with no institutional structures. Obregón was one of three revolutionary generals from Sonora, with Plutarco Elías Calles and Adolfo de la Huerta, who were important for the post-revolutionary history of Mexico. Their collective and then internecine struggles for power in the decade after the end of the military phase of the Mexican Revolution had a direct impact on the formation of the party in 1929.
In 1920, the Sonorans staged a coup against President Venustiano Carranza, the civilian First Chief of the Constitutionalist faction that had won the Mexican Revolution. Carranza had attempted to impose his own candidate for the presidency, Ignacio Bonillas. Bonillas had zero revolutionary credentials and no power base of his own, with the implication that Carranza intended to hold onto power after the end of his term. This would have been a violation of the no re-election principle of post-revolutionary Mexico, which had its origins in the 19th century. With the support of the revolutionary army, the Sonoran generals&#x27; Plan of Agua Prieta successfully challenged Carranza&#x27;s attempt to perpetuate his power; Carranza was killed as he was fleeing the country. De la Huerta became interim president of Mexico and Obregón was elected president for a four-year term, 1920–1924.

As Obregón&#x27;s four-year term was ending, Calles made a bid for the presidency. De la Huerta, a fellow Sonoran, challenged Calles with a massive and bloody uprising, supported by other revolutionary generals opposed to Calles. The De la Huerta rebellion was crushed, but the outbreak of violence was only a few years after the apparent end of the Mexican Revolution, raising the specter of renewed violence. Calles succeeded Obregón in 1924, and shortly thereafter he began enforcing the restrictions on the Catholic Church in the year of 1917 Constitution, resulting in a huge rebellion by those opposed to such restrictions, known as the Cristero War (1926–29). The Cristero War was ongoing when elections were to be held.

Obregón sought to run again for the presidency in 1928 to succeed Calles, but because of the principle of no-re-election in the Mexican Constitution, the two Sonorans sought a loophole to allow the former president to run. The Constitution was amended to allow re-election if the terms were not-consecutive. With that change, Obregón ran in the 1928 election and won; but before his inauguration he was assassinated by a religious fanatic. Given that Calles had just served as president, even with the constitutional change to allow a form of re-election, he was ineligible to run. The founding of a national political party that had an existence beyond elections became the mechanism to control the power through peaceful means.

==Founding of the Party==
The party had two names before taking its third and current name; however, its core has remained the same. It has been characterized as &quot;in the 1960s as &#x27;strongly dominant party&#x27;, in the 1970s a &#x27;pragmatic hegemonic state&#x27;, and in the 1990s as a &#x27;single party&#x27;&quot;. The close relationship between the PRI and the Mexican state has been examined by a number of scholars.

===PNR (1929–1938)===

Even though the armed phase of the Mexican Revolution had ended in 1920, Mexico continued to encounter political unrest. A grave political crisis caused by the July 1928 assassination of president-elect Álvaro Obregón led to the founding on 4 March 1929 of the National Revolutionary Party (, PNR) by Plutarco Elías Calles, Mexico&#x27;s president from 1924 to 1928. Emilio Portes Gil was interim president of Mexico from December 1928 until February 1930, while a political rather than military solution was sought for presidential succession.

The intent to found the party was to institutionalize the power of particular victors of Mexican Revolution. Calles was ineligible to run for president, since he had just completed a four-year term, because of the prohibition in the 1917 Constitution of re-election directly after serving a term as president. Calles sought to stop the violent struggle for power between the victorious factions of the Revolution, particularly around the presidential elections and to guarantee the peaceful transmission of power for members of the party. A conclave of revolutionary generals including Calles met to create a national party, forging together their various regional strongholds. They were not primarily concerned with ideology, but rather to hold power. Formally, the PNR was a political party, but it has been labeled a &quot;confederation of caciques&quot; (&quot;political bosses&quot;).

The new party-in-formation did not contain any labor elements. At the time, the strongest labor organization was the Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers (CROM) controlled by Luis N. Morones, the political wing of which was the Laborist Party. Calles went to the Laborist Party convention and addressed the membership in a conciliatory fashion, but Morones launched into a diatribe against Emilio Portes Gil, the interim president of Mexico, for disrespecting Morones personally. It was a political gaffe for Calles, and he withdrew from the organizing committee of the party, but he turned it to his advantage in the long run, appearing to be a referee or arbiter in the party, and impartial senior statesman.
The PNR incorporated other political parties under its umbrella, the &quot;Partido Radical Tabasqueño&quot;, of Tomás Garrido Canabal; the Yucatán-based &quot;Partido Socialists del Sureste&quot;, of Felipe Carrillo Puerto; and the &quot;Partido Socialista Fronterizo&quot; of Emilio Portes Gil, the current interim president. CROM&#x27;s political arm, the Laborist Party, was not part of the coalition. The party developed a written set of principles and a platform that drew support from &quot;agraristas&quot; and workers in the Laborist Party. &quot;The PNR is the instrument of political action by means of which Mexico&#x27;s great campesino and worker masses fight to keep control of the public power in their hands, a control wrested from the landowning and privileged minorities through the great armed movement that began in 1910.&quot;

One possible presidential candidate for the PNR was Aarón Sáenz Garza, former governor of the state of Nuevo León, who was the brother-in-law of Calles&#x27;s son, and was involved with Calles family businesses, but his political views were too far to the right of the PNR to be considered. Ideology trumped family connections. The choice fell to Pascual Ortiz Rubio, a revolutionary general who had been out the country, serving as Mexico&#x27;s ambassador to Brazil, so had no political base in Mexico.

When the 1929 Mexican general election was held, the first political test of the newly founded party. Calles made a speech in June 1929 saying that while the Revolution had produced achievements in the economic and social spheres that in the political sphere it was a failure. He called for a &quot;struggle of ideas&quot; that invited the formation of new parties. The PNR had as its candidate Pascual Ortiz Rubio, but running against him as the candidate for the Anti-Reelectionist Party was the high-profile former Secretary of Education, José Vasconcelos. Vasconcelos had considerable support among university students, the middle class, intellectuals, and some workers from Mexico&#x27;s northeast. According to historian Enrique Krauze, the 1929 campaign saw the PNR&#x27;s &quot;initiation into the technology of electoral fraud, a &#x27;science&#x27; that later became its highly refined speciality.&quot; Tactics included breaking up political meetings and insults, to the extreme of murder of Vasconcelos supporters. Ortiz Rubio won the election in a landslide, but the results would likely have been different were the election clean. The party did largely contain the political violence of former revolutionary generals.

In the first years of the party&#x27;s existence, the PNR was the only political machine in existence. During this period, known as &quot;Maximato&quot; (named after the title Calles gave himself as &quot;Maximum Chief of the Revolution&quot;), Calles remained the dominant leader of the country and Ortiz Rubio (1929–32) and Abelardo L. Rodríguez (1932-34), have been considered in practice subordinates of Calles.

Calles chose revolutionary general Lázaro Cárdenas as the PNR candidate for the 1934 Mexican general election. Cárdenas was originally from the southern state of Michoacan, but he joined the Revolution in the north, serving with Calles. The &quot;Jefe Máximo&quot; had no idea that Cárdenas would take his own path as he settled into the presidency. He had campaigned widely throughout the country, making a national reputation for himself and forming personal connections throughout the country outside the corridors of power. Calles had become increasingly conservative in his views, ending land reform for all practical purposes and cracking down on organized labor. Under Cárdenas, unions went on strike and were not suppressed by the government. As Cárdenas increasingly diverged in his thinking and practice from Calles, Calles sought to regain control. Cárdenas, however, had outmaneuvered Calles politically, gaining allies among labor unions and peasants as well as the Catholic Church. Calles had attempted to strictly enforce the anticlerical provisions of the Constitution, which led directly to conflict with the Catholic Church and its loyalists, so that in the conflict between the two generals, the Church sided with Cárdenas. Cárdenas had Calles arrested along with many of his allies, exiling the former president to the United States.

===PRM (1938–1946)===

Cárdenas became perhaps Mexico&#x27;s most popular 20th-century president, most renowned for the 1938 expropriating the oil interests of the United States and European petroleum companies in the run-up to World War II. That same year Cárdenas put his own stamp on the party, reorganizing it in 1938 as the Party of the Mexican Revolution (Spanish: &quot;Partido de la Revolución Mexicana&quot;, PRM) whose aim was to establish a democracy of workers and socialism. However, this was never achieved.

Cárdenas&#x27;s intention was to establish the broad-based political alliances necessary for the party&#x27;s long-term survival, as a national party with territorial presence in state and municipal governments, and organization of mass interest groups, via corporatism. The structure he established has remained intact. He created sectors of the party and structured them into mass organizations to represent different interest groups within the party, to protect the interests of workers and peasants.

The PRM had four sectors: labor, peasant (&quot;campesino&quot;), &quot;popular&quot;, mainly teachers and civil servants; and the military. The labor section was organized via the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM); the peasant sector by the National Confederation of Campesinos, (CNC); and the middle class sector by the Federation of Unions of Workers in Service to the State (FSTSE). The party incorporated the majority of Mexicans through their mass organizations, but absent from the structure for ideological reasons were two important groups, private business interests and adherents of the Catholic Church. Those two came together in 1939 to form the National Action Party, which grew to be the major opposition party, winning the presidency in 2000.

The most powerful labor union prior to the formation of the party was the Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers (CROM), headed by Luis N. Morones, an ally of Obregón and Calles. A dissident within the CROM, Marxist Vicente Lombardo Toledano, formed a rival labor confederation, the CTM in 1936, which became the mass organization of labor within the PRM. Lombardo stepped down from the leadership of the CTM in 1941, after Cárdenas left the presidency. He was replaced by Fidel Velázquez, who remained head of the CTM until his death at age 97. Within the party structure and the government, labor has had a continuous, formalized, visual corporate role, but with Velazquez&#x27;s death in 1997, organized labor has fractured.

Peasants were organized via the &quot;Confederación Nacional Campesina&quot; (CNC), or National Peasant Confederation, which Cárdenas saw as a force against landowners, but it became the vehicle for patron-client / state-campesino relationships. Whether the intention or not of Cárdenas, the CNC became a means to channel and control the peasantry.

The so-called &quot;popular&quot; sector of the party was organized via the &quot;Confederación Nacional de Organizaciones Populares&quot; (CNOP), which was formed in 1943 to integrate sectors of the urban middle class into the party. Unlike the peasantry or labor, the popular sector was a more ill-defined segment, but it did include the large Federation of Unions of Civil Servants (&quot;Federación de Sindicatos de Trabajadores al Servicio del Estado&quot; (FSTSE).

By incorporating the military into the PRM structure, Cárdenas&#x27;s aim was to make it politically dependent on the party rather than allow it to be a separate group outside the party and potentially a politically interventionist force. Although some critics questioned the military&#x27;s incorporation into the party, Cárdenas saw it as a way to assert civilian control. He is quoted as saying, &quot;We did not put the Army in politics. It was already there. In fact it had been dominating the situation, and we did well to reduce its voice to one in four.&quot; In general, the corporatist model is most often associated with fascism, whose rise in Germany and Italy in the 1930s coincided with Cárdenas&#x27;s presidency.
But Cárdenas was emphatically opposed to fascism; however, he created the PRM and organized the Mexican state on authoritarian lines. That reorganization can be seen as the enduring legacy of the Cárdenas presidency. Although the PRM was reorganized into the Institutional Revolutionary Party in 1946, the basic structure was retained. Cárdenas&#x27;s calculation that the military&#x27;s incorporation into the PRM would undermine its power was essentially correct, since it disappeared as a separate sector of the party, but was absorbed into the &quot;popular&quot; sector. The organizational change in the PNR to the PRM, and later the PRM to the PRI, were &quot;imposed by Mexican presidents without any discussion within the party.&quot;

Cárdenas followed the pattern of Calles and Obregón before him, designating his choice in the upcoming elections; for Cárdenas this was Manuel Ávila Camacho. In the 1940 election, Ávila Camacho&#x27;s main rival was former revolutionary general Juan Andreu Almazán, with PRM victory coming via fraud after a violent campaign period. Cárdenas is said to have secured the support of the CTM and the CNC for Ávila Camacho by personally guaranteeing their interests would be respected.

In the final year of Ávila Camacho&#x27;s term, the party assembly decided on a new name, pushed by the circle of Miguel Alemán, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, pairing seemingly contradictory terms of &quot;institutional&quot; and &quot;revolutionary.&quot;

==PRI and Dominant-party state (1946–1988)==
===Change in structure and ideology===

The party&#x27;s name was changed in 1946, the final year of Manuel Ávila Camacho&#x27;s term of office. The sectoral representation in the party continued for the workers, peasants, and the popular sector, but the military was no longer represented by its own sector. The Mexican president was at the apex of the political system with the PRI. To reach the top of the government, as the candidate and then president of the republic, the path was only through membership and leadership in the party and government service. Within the party, there were factions, the &quot;técnicos&quot;, bureaucrats with specialized knowledge and training, especially with the economy, and &quot;políticos&quot;, the seasoned politicians, many of whom had regional roots in state politics.

Miguel Alemán was the PRI&#x27;s candidate in the 1946 elections, but he did not run unopposed. Alemán and his circle had hoped to abandon sectoral representation in the party and separate the party as an organism of the state, but there was considerable pushback from the labor sector and the CTM, which would have lost influence, along with the other sectors. The structure of the party remained sectoral, but the Alemanistas abandoned the goal that had been &quot;the preparation of the people for the implementation of a workers&#x27; democracy and for the arrival of a socialist regime.&quot; The party slogan was changed from the PRM&#x27;s &quot;[f]or a workers&#x27; democracy&quot; (&quot;Por una democracia de trabajadores&quot;) to the PRI&#x27;s &quot;[d]emocracy and justice&quot; (&quot;Democracia y justicia&quot;).

In practice after Cárdenas left office, the party became more centrist, and his more radical agrarian policies were abandoned. With Lombardo Toledano&#x27;s replacement as leader of the CTM, labor under the CTM&#x27;s Fidel Velázquez became even more closely identified with the party. The more radical left of the labor movement, under Vicente Lombardo Toledano, split from the PRI, the Partido Popular. Although the party gave voice to workers&#x27; demands, since it was outside the umbrella of the PRI and lost power and influence. The leadership of component unions became advocates of PRI policy at the expense of the rank and file in exchange for political backing from the party and financial benefits. These &quot;charro&quot; (&quot;cowboy&quot;) unions turned out the labor vote at election time, a guaranteed base of support for the party. During prosperous years, CTM could argue for benefits of the rank-and-file, such as higher wages, networking to provide jobs for union loyalists, and job security. The principle of no-reelection did not apply to the CTM, so that the party loyalist Velázquez provided decades of continuity even as the presidency changed every six years.
The PRI won every presidential election from 1929 to 1982, by well over 70 percent of the votemargins that were usually obtained by massive electoral frauds. Toward the end of his term, the incumbent president in consultation with party leaders, selected the PRI&#x27;s candidate in the next election in a procedure known as &quot;the tap of the finger&quot; (), which was integral in the continued success of the PRI towards the end of the 20th century. In essence, given the PRI&#x27;s overwhelming dominance, and its control of the electoral apparatus, the president chose his successor. The PRI&#x27;s dominance was near-absolute at all other levels as well. It held an overwhelming majority in the Chamber of Deputies, as well as every seat in the Senate and every state governorship.

The political stability and economic prosperity in the late 1940s and the 1950s benefited the party, so that in general Mexicans did not object to the lack of real democracy.

===Mexican Miracle===
Starting with the Alemán administration (1946–1952) until 1970, Mexico embarked on a sustained period of economic growth, dubbed the Mexican Miracle, fueled by import substitution and low inflation. From 1940 to 1970 GDP increased sixfold while the population only doubled, and peso-dollar parity was maintained at a stable exchange rate.

Economic nationalist and protectionist policies implemented in the 1930s effectively closed off Mexico to foreign trade and speculation, so that the economy was fueled primarily by state investment and businesses were heavily reliant on government contracts. As a result of these policies, Mexico&#x27;s capitalist impulses were channeled into massive industrial development and social welfare programs, which helped to urbanize the mostly-agrarian country, funded generous welfare subsidies for the working class, and fueled considerable advances in communication and transportation infrastructure. This period of commercial growth created a significant urban middle class of white-collar bureaucrats and office workers, and allowed high-ranking PRI officials to graft large personal fortunes through their control over state-funded programs. State monopoly over key industries like electricity and telecommunication allowed a small clique of businessmen to dominate their sectors of the economy by supplying government-owned companies with goods and commodities.

A major impact of Mexico&#x27;s economic growth was urban population growth, transforming the country from a largely rural one to urban. The middle class grew substantially. The overall population of Mexico grew substantially with a greater proportion being under the age of 16. These factors combined to decrease the pull of the past. The policies promoting industrial growth helped fuel the growth of Mexico&#x27;s north as a center of economic dynamism, with the city of Monterrey becoming Mexico&#x27;s second-largest.

The general economic prosperity served to legitimize PRI hegemony in the eyes of most Mexicans, and for decades the party faced no real opposition on any level of government. On the rare occasions when an opposition candidate, usually from the conservative National Action Party, whose strength was in Mexico&#x27;s north, garnered a majority of votes in an election, the PRI often used its control of local government to rig election results in its favor. Voter apathy was characteristic in this period, with low turnout in elections. The PRI co-opted criticism by incorporating sectors of society into its hierarchy. PRI-controlled labor unions (&quot;&quot;charro&quot; unions&quot;) maintained a tight grip over the working classes; the PRI held rural farmers in check through its control of the &quot;ejidos&quot; (state-owned plots of land that peasants could farm but not own), and generous financial support of universities and the arts ensured that most intellectuals rarely challenged the ideals of the Mexican Revolution. In this way, PRI rule was supported by a broad national consensus that held firm for decades, even as polarizing forces gradually worked to divide the nation in preparation for the crises of the 1970s and 1980s. The consensus specifically held that Mexico would be capitalist in its economic model; that the masses of workers and peasants would be kept in checkas separate units and not allowed to merge into a single sector that would have too much strength; that the state and the party would be the agent for this control; and that the state and private entrepreneurs would compete in the mixed economy. So long as there was general prosperity, the system was stable economically and politically. Political balance meant that sectors had a voice within the party, but the party and the state were the arbiters of the system. Those supporting the system received material rewards that the state distributed. In this period, there was a continuing rapprochement with the United States, which built on their alliance in World War II. Although there was rhetoric about economic nationalism and defense of Mexican sovereignty, there was broad-based cooperation between the two countries.

Cracks appeared in the system. There was significant labor unrest with strikes by railway workers, electricians, and even medical doctors that were brutally suppressed. Culturally the mood was changing as well, with Carlos Fuentes publishing &quot;The Death of Artemio Cruz&quot; (&quot;La Muerte de Artemio Cruz&quot;) in 1962, metaphorically the death of the ideals of the Mexican Revolution. The fictional Cruz had been a revolutionary soldier, corrupt politician, and businessman, now on his deathbed. Considered a landmark in Latin American literature, it highlighted aspects of Mexican history and its political system.

===Attempts at party reform===

When Alemán became president in 1946, the PRI had begun experiments in internal primaries, but Alemán cracked down on this democratic opening and had congress pass a law against parties holding primaries. Revolutionary general Rodolfo Sánchez Taboada, president of the party, had been in favor of primaries, but Alemán&#x27;s viewpoint prevailed and PRI candidates were chosen in closed party assemblies. Sánchez was replaced as titular head of the party, and the president of the republic remained firmly in control.

During the early presidency of Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, Carlos A. Madrazo was appointed president of the party and undertook serious reforms in 1964–65. PRI legislators were attempting to negate the principle of no-reelection for members of congress, which many of supported. Madrazo went further in reform attempts, seeking to democratize the electoral process for municipal candidates, which sectoral leaders and local PRI bossed opposed because it would undermine their hold on local elections. It was implemented in just seven states. Madrazo was forced to resign. Madrazo died in an airplane crash in 1969, which at the time was considered suspicious.

Only in 2000 did the PRI choose its presidential candidate through a primary, but its candidate Francisco Labastida lost that election.

===Political impact of the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre===

The improvement of the economy had a disparate impact in different social sectors and discontent started growing within the middle class as well as the popular classes. The doctors&#x27; strike in 1965 was a manifestation of middle-class discontent. Seeking better wages and workplace conditions, doctors demanded redress from the government. Rather than give into such demands, President Díaz Ordaz sent in riot troops to suppress the strike with brute force and arrest leaders. Two hundred doctors were fired. Díaz Ordaz&#x27;s hard line on this strike by a sector of the middle class presaged even harsher suppression during the summer of 1968.

With the choice of capital for the venue for the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games slated for October, the government poured huge resources into preparing facilities. Mexico wanted to showcase its economic achievements and sought the international focus on the country. Maintaining an image of a prosperous and well-ordered Mexico was important for the Mexican government. In a relatively low-level conflict in late July 1968 between young people in Mexico City, the &quot;Granadero&quot; riot police used violence to tamp down the incident. However, the crackdown had the opposite effect, with students at the National University (UNAM) and the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) putting aside their traditional rivalries and joining together in protest in the Mexican Student Movement.
They protested lack of democracy and social justice in Mexico. Middle-class university students had largely been apolitical up until this point. President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz (1964–1970) ordered the army to occupy the university to suppress the mobilization and minimize the disruption of the Olympic Games. Orderly large-scale protests in downtown Mexico City showed the discontent of students and their largely middle-class supporters. As the opening ceremonies of the Olympics approached, the government sought help from the United States in dealing with the protests. Unaccustomed to this type of protest, the Mexican government made an unusual move by asking the United States for assistance, through LITEMPO, a spy-program to inform the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the US to obtain information from Mexico. The CIA responded by sending military radios, weapons and ammunition. The LITEMPO had previously provided the Díaz Ordaz government with 1,000 rounds of .223 Remington ammunition in 1963.

After weeks of huge and largely peaceful demonstrations in Mexico City in August and September by students and middle-class Mexicans, the government cracked down on 2 October, with army and special tactical units opening fire on a relatively small demonstration in Tlatelolco, a section of the metropolis. They killed and wounded a large but unknown number of protesters. Despite that the Olympics went forward on schedule, with the president of the Olympic Committee declaring that the protests were against the Mexican government and not the Olympics themselves, so the games proceeded.

Political life in Mexico was changed that day. 2 October 1968, the date of what is known as the Tlatelolco massacre, is a turning point in Mexican history. That date &quot;marks a psychological departure in which Mexicans – particularly urban, well-educated citizens, intellectuals, and even government officials themselves – began to question the efficiency and morality of an authoritarian state that required violence against middle-class students to maintain its position of authority and legitimacy to govern.&quot; Intellectuals were alienated from the regime, after decades of cooperation with the government and receiving benefits for that service. The poet and essayist Octavio Paz, who would later win the Nobel Prize in Literature, resigned as Mexican Ambassador to India. Novelist Carlos Fuentes denounced the repression.

Díaz Ordaz chose Luis Echeverría as the PRI candidate in the 1970 election. As the Minister of the Interior, Echeverría was operationally responsible for the Tlatelolco massacre.

=== Economic crisis of the 1970s ===

By the early 1970s, fundamental issues were emerging in the industrial and agricultural sectors of Mexico&#x27;s economy. Regional underdevelopment, technological shortages, lack of foreign competition, and uneven distribution of wealth led to chronic underproduction of investment and capital goods, putting the long-term future of Mexican industry in doubt. Meanwhile, ubiquitous poverty combined with a dearth of agricultural investment and infrastructure caused continuous migration from rural to urban areas; in 1971, Mexican agriculture was in such a state that the country had become a net importer of food. Overvaluation of the peso led to a decline in the tourism industry (which had previously compensated for failures in industry and agriculture) meant that by the early 1970s, the economy had begun to falter, and they believed the only sure source of capital was external borrowing.

Díaz Ordaz chose his government secretary, Luis Echeverría, to succeed him as president. Echeverría&#x27;s administration (1970–76) increased social spending, through external debt, at a time when oil production and prices were surging. However, the growth of the economy came accompanied by inflation and then by a plummeting of oil prices and increases in interest rates. Investment started fleeing the country and the peso became overvalued, to prevent a devaluation and further fleeing of investments, the Bank of Mexico borrowed 360 million dollars from the Federal Reserve with the promise of stabilizing the economy. External debt reached the level of $25 billion. Unable to contain the fleeing of dollars, Echeverría allowed the peso to float for the first time on 31 August 1976, then again later and the peso lost half of its value. Echeverría designated José López Portillo, his Secretary of Finance, as his successor for the term 1976–82, hoping that the new administration would have a tighter control on inflation and to preserve political unity.

===Election of 1976, PRI runs unopposed===
In the 1976 election, the PRI presidential candidate José López Portillo faced no real opposition, not even the National Action Party, which did not field a candidate in this election due to an ideological split. The lack of the appearance of democracy in the national elections undermined the legitimacy of the system. He proposed a reform called &quot;Ley Federal de Organizaciones Políticas y Procesos Electorales&quot; which gave official registry to opposition groups such as the Mexican Democratic Party and the Mexican Communist Party. This law also created positions in the lower chamber of congress for opposition parties through proportionality of votes, relative majority, uninominal and plurinominal. As a result, in 1979, the first independent (non-PRI) communist deputies were elected to the Congress of Mexico. Within the PRI, party president Carlos Sansores pushed for what he called &quot;transparent democracy&quot;, but the effort went nowhere.

Although López Portillo&#x27;s term started with economic difficulties, the discovery of significant oil reserves in Mexico allowed him to borrow funds from foreign banks to be repaid in dollars against future revenues to allocate funds for social spending immediately. The discovery of significant oil sites in Tabasco and Campeche helped the economy to recover and López Portillo promised to &quot;administer the abundance.&quot; The development of the promising oil industry was financed through external debt which reached 59 billion dollars (compared to 25 billion during Echeverría). Oil production increased from at the beginning of his administration to at the end of his administration and Mexico became the fourth largest oil producer in the world. The price for a barrel of oil also increased from three dollars in 1970 to 35 dollars in 1981. The government attempted to develop heavy industry. However, waste became the rule as centralized resource allocation and distribution systems were accompanied by inefficiently located factories incurring high transport costs.

Mexico increased its international presence during López Portillo: in addition to becoming the world&#x27;s fourth oil exporter, Mexico restarted relations with the post Franco-Spain in 1977, allowed Pope John Paul II to visit Mexico, welcomed U.S. president Jimmy Carter and broke relations with Somoza and supported the Sandinista National Liberation Front in its rebellion against the United States supported government. López Portillo also proposed the Plan Mundial de Energéticos in 1979 and summoned a North-South World Summit in Cancún in 1981 to seek solutions to social problems. In 1979, the PRI founded the COPPPAL, the Permanent Conference of Political Parties of Latin America and the Caribbean, an organization created &quot;to defend democracy and all lawful political institutions and to support their development and improvement to strengthen the principle of self determination of the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean&quot;.

Social programs were also created through the Alliance for Production, Global Development Plan, el COPLAMAR, Mexican Nourishing System, to attain independence on food, to reform public administration. López Portillo also created the secretaries of Programming and Budgeting, Agriculture and Water Resources, Industrial Support, Fisheries and Human Settlements and Public Works. Mexico then obtained high economic growth, a recuperation of salaries and an increase in spending on education and infrastructure. This way, social and regional inequalities started to diminish. The attempted industrialization had not been responsive to consumer needs. Therefore, unprecedented urbanization and overcrowding followed and so, substandard pre-fabricated apartment blocs had to be built in large cities.

All this prosperity ended when the over-supply of oil in early 1982 caused oil prices to plummet and severely damaged the national economy. Interest rates skyrocketed in 1981 and external debt reached 86 billion dollars and exchange rates went from 26 to 70 pesos per dollar and inflation of 100%. This situation became so desperate that Lopez Portillo ordered the suspension on payments of external debt and the nationalization of the banking industry in 1982 consistent with the Socialist goals of the PRI. Capital fled Mexico at a rate never seen before in history. The Mexican government provided subsidies to staple food products and rail travel; this diminished the consequences of the crises on the populace. Job growth stagnated and millions of people migrated North to escape the economic stagnation. López Portillo&#x27;s reputation plummeted and his character became the butt of jokes from the press. In his last presidential address on 1 September 1982, he nationalized foreign banks. During his campaign, López Portillo promised to defend the peso &quot;como un perro&quot; (&quot;like a dog&quot;), López Portillo refused to devalue the currency saying &quot;The president who devalues, devalues himself.&quot;

===First of the technocratic presidents, 1982===
When López Portillo left office in December 1982, the economy was in shambles. He designated Miguel de la Madrid as the PRI candidate, the first of a series of economists to rule the country, a technocrat who turned his back on populist policies to implement neoliberal reforms, causing the number of state-owned industries to decline from 1155 to a mere 412. After the 1982 default, crisis lenders were unwilling to loan Mexico and this resulted in currency devaluations to finance spending. An earthquake in September 1985, in which his administration was criticised for its slow and clumsy reaction, added more woe to the problems. As a result of the crisis, black markets supplied by goods stolen from the public sector appeared. Galloping inflation continued to plague the country, hitting a record high in 1987 at 159%.

==Transition to multi-party system: 1988–2000==
===Left-wing splits from the PRI===
In 1986, Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas (former Governor of Michoacán and son of the former president of Mexico Lázaro Cárdenas) formed the &quot;Democratic Current&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Corriente Democrática&quot;) of the PRI, which criticized the federal government for reducing spending on social programs to increase payments on foreign debt. The members of the Democratic Current were expelled from the party and formed the National Democratic Front (FDN, Spanish: &quot;Frente Democrático Nacional&quot;) in 1987. The following year, the FDN elected Cárdenas as presidential candidate for the 1988 presidential election which was won by Carlos Salinas de Gortari, obtaining 50.89% of the votes (according to official figures) versus 32% of Cárdenas. The official results were delayed, with the Secretary of the Interior (until then, the organizer of elections) blaming it on a computer system failure. Cárdenas claimed to have won and claimed such computer failure was caused by a manipulation of the system to count votes. Manuel Clouthier of the National Action Party (PAN, ) also claimed to have won, although not as vocally.

Miguel de la Madrid, Mexico&#x27;s president at the time of the 1988 election, admitted in 2004 that, on the evening of the election, he received news that Cárdenas was going to win by a majority, and that he and others rigged the election as a result.

Clouthier, Cárdenas and Rosario Ibarra de Piedra then complained before the building of the Secretary of the Interior. Clouthier and his followers then set up other protests, among them one at the Chamber of Deputies, demanding that the electoral packages be opened. In 1989, Clouthier presented an &quot;alternative cabinet&quot; (a British style Shadow Cabinet) with Diego Fernández de Cevallos, Jesús González Schmal, Fernando Canales Clariond, Francisco Villarreal Torres, Rogelio Sada Zambrano, María Elena Álvarez Bernal, Moisés Canales, Vicente Fox, Carlos Castillo Peraza and Luis Felipe Bravo Mena as cabinet members and Clouthier as cabinet coordinator. The purpose of this cabinet was to vigilate the actions of the government. Clouthier died next October in an accident with Javier Calvo, a federal deputy. The accident has been claimed by the PAN as a state assassination since then. That same year, the PRI lost its first state government with the election of Ernesto Ruffo Appel as governor of Baja California.

===Attempt at internal reform, 1990s===
Luis Donaldo Colosio at the time party president attempted a &quot;democratic experiment&quot; to open up the party at the level of candidates for gubernatorial and municipal elections, which would bar precandidates from campaigning for the nomination, but without a democratic tradition within the party and as basic a fact as the lack of lists of party membership meant the experiment failed. Carlos Salinas de Gortari resisted any attempts to reform the party. At the end of 1994, after the assassination of Colosio who had been designated the PRI presidential candidate, the party did move toward greater internal democracy.

===Political turmoil and decline of power===

In 1990, Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa called the government under the PRI &quot;la dictadura perfecta&quot; (&quot;the perfect dictatorship&quot;). Despite that perception, a major blow came with the assassination of the 1994 PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, the first high-level assassination since that of president-elect Alvaro Obregón in 1928, which led to Calles forming the PRN to deal with the political vacuum. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari designated Colosio&#x27;s campaign director, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, as the new PRI candidate, who was subsequently elected. The 1994 elections were the first Mexican presidential election monitored by international observers.

A number of factors, including the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, caused the PRI to lose its absolute majority in both chambers of the federal congress for the first time in 1997.

After several decades in power the PRI had become a symbol of corruption and electoral fraud. The conservative National Action Party (PAN) became a stronger party after 1976 when it obtained the support from businessmen after recurring economic crises. Consequently, the PRI&#x27;s left wing separated and formed its own party, the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) in 1989.

Critics claim electoral fraud, with voter suppression and violence, was used when the political machine did not work and elections were just a ritual to simulate the appearance of a democracy. However, the three major parties now make the same claim against each other (PRD against Vicente Fox&#x27;s PAN and PAN vs. López Obrador&#x27;s PRD, and the PRI against the PAN at the local level and local elections such as the 2007 Yucatán state election). Two other PRI presidents Miguel de la Madrid and Carlos Salinas de Gortari privatized many outmoded industries, including banks and businesses, entered the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and also negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement.

In the final decades of the PRI regime, the connections between the party and drug cartels became more evident, as the drug trade saw a massive increase, which worsened corruption in the party and at all spheres of Government. In 1984, journalist Manuel Buendía was murdered by agents of the Federal Security Directorate (Buendía had been investigating possible ties between Drug cartels, the CIA and the FSD itself). In 1997, general Jesús Gutiérrez Rebollo, who had been appointed by president Ernesto Zedillo as head of the Instituto Nacional de Combate a las Drogas, was arrested after it was discovered that he had been collaborating with the Juárez Cartel. In another infamous incident, Mario Villanueva, a member of the PRI and outgoing governor of Quintana Roo, was accused in 1999 of drug trafficking. When the evidence against him became strong enough to warrant an arrest, he disappeared from the public eye two days before the end of his term, being absent at the ceremony at which he was to hand the office over to his elected successor, Joaquín Hendricks Díaz. Villanueva remained a fugitive from justice for many months, until being captured and arrested in 2001.

==First time in opposition: 2000–2012==
===Loss of the presidency of Mexico===

Prior to the 2000 general elections, the PRI held its first primaries to elect the party&#x27;s presidential candidate. The primary candidates, nicknamed &quot;los cuatro fantásticos&quot; (Spanish for &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot;), were:
* Francisco Labastida Ochoa (former governor of Sinaloa and Secretary of the Interior)
* Roberto Madrazo Pintado (former governor of Tabasco)
* Manuel Bartlett (former governor of Puebla and Secretary of the Interior)
* Humberto Roque Villanueva

The favorites in the primaries were Labastida and Madrazo, and the latter initiated a campaign against the first, perceived as Zedillo&#x27;s candidate since many former secretaries of the interior were chosen as candidates by the president. His campaign, produced by prominent publicist Carlos Alazraki, had the motto &quot;Dale un Madrazo al dedazo&quot; or &quot;Give a Madrazo to the &quot;dedazo&quot;&quot; with &quot;madrazo&quot; being an offensive slang term for a &quot;strike&quot; and &quot;dedazo&quot; a slang used to describe the unilaterally choosing of candidates by the president (literally &quot;finger-strike&quot;).

The growth of the PAN and PRD parties culminated in 2000, when the PAN won the presidency, and again in 2006 (won this time by the PAN with a small margin over the PRD.) Many prominent members of the PAN (Manuel Clouthier, Addy Joaquín Coldwell and Demetrio Sodi), most of the PRD (most notably all three Mexico City mayors Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas and Marcelo Ebrard), the PVEM (Jorge González Torres) and New Alliance (Roberto Campa) were once members of the PRI, including many presidential candidates from the opposition (Clouthier, López Obrador, Cárdenas, González Torres, Campa and Porfirio Muñoz Ledo, among many others).

In the presidential elections of 2 July 2000, its candidate Francisco Labastida Ochoa was defeated by Vicente Fox, after getting only 36.1% of the popular vote. It was to be the first Presidential electoral defeat of the PRI. In the senatorial elections of the same date, the party won with 38.1%, or 33 out of 128 seats in the Senate of Mexico.

===As an opposition party===
After much restructuring, the party was able to make a recovery, winning the greatest number of seats (5% short of a true majority) in Congress in 2003: at these elections, the party won 224 out of 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, remaining as the largest single party in both the Chamber of Deputies and Senate. In the Federal District the PRI obtained only one borough mayorship &quot;(jefe delegacional)&quot; out of 16, and no first-past-the-post members of the city assembly. The PRI recouped some significant losses on the state level (most notably, the governorship of former PAN stronghold Nuevo León). On 6 August 2004, in two closely contested elections in Oaxaca and Tijuana, PRI candidates Ulises Ruiz Ortiz and Jorge Hank Rhon won the races for the governorship and municipal presidency respectively. The PAN had held control of the president&#x27;s office of the municipality of Tijuana for 15 years. Six out of eight gubernatorial elections held during 2005 were won by the PRI: Quintana Roo, Hidalgo, Colima, Estado de México, Nayarit, and Coahuila. The PRI then controlled the states on the country&#x27;s northern border with the US except for Baja California.

Later that year Roberto Madrazo, president of the PRI, left his post to seek a nomination as the party&#x27;s candidate in the 2006 presidential election. According to the statutes, the presidency of the party would then go to Elba Esther Gordillo as party secretary. The rivalry between Madrazo and Gordillo caused Mariano Palacios Alcocer instead to become president of the party. After what was perceived an imposition of Madrazo as candidate a group was formed called &quot;Unidad Democrática&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Democratic Unity&quot;), although nicknamed &quot;Todos Unidos Contra Madrazo&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Everybody United Against Madrazo&quot; or &quot;TUCOM&quot;) which was formed by governors and former state governors:
* Arturo Montiel (former governor of the State of Mexico)
* Enrique Jackson (federal senator)
* Tomás Yarrington (governor of Tamaulipas)
* Enrique Martínez (former governor of Coahuila)
* Manuel Núñez (governor of Hidalgo)

Montiel won the right to run against Madrazo for the candidacy but withdrew when it was made public that he and his French wife owned large properties in Europe. Madrazo and Everardo Moreno contended in the primaries which was won by the first. Madrazo then represented the PRI and the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM) in the Alliance for Mexico coalition.

During his campaign Madrazo declared that the PRI and PRD were &quot;first cousins&quot;; to this Emilio Chuayffet Chemor responded that if that were the case then Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), candidate of the PRD, would also be a first cousin and he might win the election.

AMLO was by then the favorite in the polls, with many followers within the PRI. Madrazo, second at the polls, then released TV spots against AMLO with little success; his campaign was managed again by Alazraki. Felipe Calderón of the ruling PAN ran a more successful campaign, later surpassing Madrazo as the second favorite. Gordillo, also the teachers&#x27; union leader, resentful against Madrazo, helped a group of teachers constitute the New Alliance Party. Divisions within the party and a successful campaign of the PAN candidate caused Madrazo to fall to third place. The winner, as announced by the Federal Electoral Institute and evaluated by the Mexican Election Tribunal amidst a controversy, was Calderón. On 20 November that year, a group of young PRI politicians launched a movement that was set to reform and revolutionize the party. The PRI candidate failed to win a single state in the 2006 presidential election.

In the 2006 legislative elections the party won 106 out of 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 35 out of 128 Senators.

The PRI regained the governorship of Yucatán in 2007, and was the party with the most mayorships and state congresspeople in the elections in Yucatán (tying with the PAN in the number of deputies), Chihuahua, Durango, Aguascalientes, Veracruz, Chiapas and Oaxaca. The PRI obtained the most mayorships in Zacatecas and the second-most deputies in the congressional elections of Zacatecas and Baja California.

In 2009, the PRI regained plurality control of the Mexican congress; this was the first time the congress had fallen to PRI control since PAN&#x27;s victory in 2000.

The PRI benefited from both the growing unpopularity of Felipe Calderón&#x27;s administration as president due to the notorious increase in the homicide rate as a result of his war on drugs, as well as internal conflicts in the left-wing Partido de la Revolucion Democratica (PRD) that deteriorated its image.

==Return to power: 2012–2018==
===Return of the PRI===
Under Enrique Peña Nieto and after ruling for most of the past century in Mexico, the PRI returned to the presidency as it had brought hopes to those who gave the PRI another chance and fear to those who worry about the old PRI tactics of making deals with the cartels in exchange for relative peace. According to an article published by &quot;The Economist&quot; on 23 June 2012, part of the reason why Peña Nieto and the PRI were voted back to the presidency after a 12-year struggle lay in the disappointment of PAN rule. Buffeted by China&#x27;s economic growth and the economic recession in the United States, the annual growth of Mexico&#x27;s economy between 2000 and 2012 was 1.8%. Poverty grew worse, and without a ruling majority in Congress, the PAN presidents were unable to pass structural reforms, leaving monopolies and Mexico&#x27;s educational system unchanged. In 2006, Felipe Calderón chose to make the battle against organized crime the centerpiece of his presidency. Nonetheless, with over 60,000 dead and a lack of any real progress, Mexican citizens became tired of a fight they had first supported, and not by majority. &quot;The Economist&quot; alleged that these signs were &quot;not as bad as they look&quot;, since Mexico was more democratic, it contained a competitive export market, had a well-run economy despite the crisis, and there were tentative signs that the violence in the country may be plummeting. But if voters wanted the PRI back, &quot;The Economist&quot; claimed, it was because &quot;the alternatives [were] weak&quot;. The magazine also alleged that Mexico&#x27;s preferences should have gone left-wing, but the candidate that represented that movement – Andrés Manuel López Obrador – engaged in &quot;disgraceful behaviour&quot;. The conservative candidate, Josefina Vázquez Mota, was deemed worthy but was considered by &quot;The Economist&quot; to have carried out a &quot;shambolic campaign&quot;. Thus, Peña Nieto won by default, having been perceived (per the magazine) as the &quot;least bad choice&quot; for reform in Mexico.

====Aftermath of the return of the PRI====
When the PRI lost the presidency in 2000, few expected that the &quot;perfect dictatorship&quot;, a description coined by Mario Vargas Llosa, would return again in only 12 years. The Associated Press published an article in July 2012 noting that many immigrants living in the United States were worried about the PRI&#x27;s return to power and that it could dissuade many from returning to their homeland. The vast majority of the 400,000 voters outside of Mexico voted against Peña Nieto, and said they were &quot;shocked&quot; that the PRI – which largely convinced them to leave Mexico – had returned. Voters who favored Peña Nieto, however, believed that the PRI &quot;had changed&quot; and that more jobs would be created under the new regime. Moreover, some U.S. officials were concerned that Peña Nieto&#x27;s security strategy meant the return to the old and corrupt practices of the PRI regime, where the government made deals with and overlooked the cartels in exchange for peace. They worried that Mexico&#x27;s drug war, which had already cost over 50,000 lives, would make Mexicans question on why they should &quot;pay the price for a US drug habit&quot;. Peña Nieto denied, however, that his party would tolerate corruption, and stated he would not make deals with the cartels. In spite of Peña&#x27;s words, a poll from 20 September 2016, revealed that 83% of Mexican citizens perceived the PRI as the most corrupt political party in Mexico.

The return of the PRI brought some perceived negative consequences, among them:
* Low levels of presidential approval and allegations of presidential corruption: The government of President Enrique Peña Nieto faced multiple scandals and allegations of corruption. Reforma, which has conducted polls of presidential approval since 1995, revealed that Peña Nieto had received the lowest presidential approval in modern history since it had begun polling on the subject in 1995; he had received a mere 12% approval rating. The second-lowest approval was for Ernesto Zedillo (1994-2000), also from the PRI. It also revealed that both presidents elected from the National Action Party (PAN), Vicente Fox (2000–2006) and Felipe Calderón (2006–2012), had higher presidential approvals than the PRI presidents.
* PRI corrupt ex-governors declared criminals by the Mexican government: During Peña Nieto&#x27;s government multiple members of the PRI political party were declared criminals by the Mexican government, which surprised the public given they were elected as PRI members and state governors within the Mexican government, among them Tomas Yarrington from Tamaulipas (along his predecessor Eugenio Hernández Flores), Javier Duarte from Veracruz, César Duarte Jáquez from Chihuahua (no family relation between both Duarte), and Roberto Borge from Quintana Roo, along their unknown multiple allies who enabled their corruption. All of them supported Peña Nieto during his presidential campaign.
* State of Mexico allegations of electoral fraud (2017): The 2017 elections within the state of Mexico were highly controversial, with multiple media outlets feeling there was electoral fraud committed by the PRI. In November 2017, magazine &quot;Proceso&quot; published an article accusing the PRI of breaking at least 16 state laws during the elections, which were denounced 619 times. They said that all of them were broken in order to favor PRI candidate for governor Alfredo del Mazo (who is the cousin of Enrique Peña Nieto and whom several of his relatives have also been governors of said entity). The article claims it has been the most corrupt election in modern Mexican history, and directly blames the PRI. Despite all the evidence, Alfredo del Mazo was declared winner of the election by the electoral tribunals, and served a term as governor.

The Chamber of Deputies also suffered from controversies from members of the PRI:
* Law 3 of 3 Anticorruption controversy: In early 2016, a controversy arose when all the Senate disputes from the PRI, voted against the &quot;Ley 3 de 3 (Law 3 of 3)&quot;, a law that would have obligated every politician to announce three items: a public patrimonial declaration, an interests declaration, and a fiscal declaration. A revised, less comprehensive version of the law was accepted but it does not oblige politicians to make the three items. While it was completely legal for the deputies from the PRI to vote against such a law, some news media outlets interpreted the votes against the promulgation of such law as the political party protecting itself from the findings that could surface if such declarations were to be made.
* In November 2017, Aristegui Noticias reported that &quot;the PRI and their allies were seeking to approve the &quot;Ley de Seguridad Interior (Law of Internal Security)&quot;. The Mexican National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) had previously said that law violated human rights, because it favors the discretional usage of the army forces. The CNDH said it &quot;endangered citizens by giving a blank check to the army&quot; and the president to order an attack towards any group of people they consider a danger without requiring an explanation. This could include people such as social activists.

==Second time in opposition: 2018–present==
On 27 November 2017, José Antonio Meade announced he would compete in the 2018 presidential election, representing the PRI. He was reported to have been handpicked directly by president Peña Nieto through the traditional and now controversial practice known as &quot;El Dedazo&quot; (literally, &quot;the finger strike&quot;, evoking an image of the incumbent president directly pointing towards his successor).

There were concerns about the possibility of fraud in the presidential election following allegations of electoral fraud concerning the election of Enrique Peña Nieto&#x27;s cousin Alfredo del Mazo Maza as governor of the state of Mexico, in December 2017. The Mexican newspaper &quot;Regeneración&quot;, which is officially linked to the MORENA party, warned about the possibility of the PRI committing an electoral fraud. Cited was the controversial law of internal security that the PRI senators approved as the means to diminish the protests towards such electoral fraud. &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; also supported that possible outcome, with Tony Payan, director of the Houston&#x27;s Mexico Center at Rice University&#x27;s Baker Institute, suggesting that both vote buyouts and computer hackings were possible, citing the 1988 previous electoral fraud committed by the PRI. Bloomberg&#x27;s article also suggested Meade could also receive unfair help from the over-budget amounts of money spent in publicity by incumbent president Enrique Peña Nieto (who also campaigned with the PRI). A December 2017 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported Peña Nieto spending about US$2 billion on publicity during his first five years as president, the largest publicity budget ever spent by a Mexican president. Additionally, the article noted the concerns of news journalists, 68 percent of whom claimed to not believe they had enough freedom of speech. To support the statement, the cited award-winning news reporter Carmen Aristegui, who was controversially fired shortly after revealing the Mexican White House scandals concerning a conflict of interest regarding a house owned by Peña Nieto.

In April 2018, Forbes republished a British news program Channel 4 News story claiming the existence of proof of ties between the PRI and Cambridge Analytica, which was previously implicated in Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, suggesting a &quot;modus operandi&quot; in Mexico similar to the one in the United States. The information indicated they worked together at least until January 2018. An investigation was requested. The PRI has denied ever contracting Cambridge Analytica. &quot;The New York Times&quot; acquired the 57-page proposal of Cambridge Analytica&#x27;s outlining a strategy of collaboration to benefit the PRI by hurting MORENA&#x27;s candidate López Obrador. The political party rejected Cambridge Analytica&#x27;s offer but paid the firm to not help the other candidates.

In the 2018 general election, as part of the Todos por México coalition, the PRI suffered a monumental legislative defeat, scoring the lowest number of seats in the party&#x27;s history. Presidential candidate José Antonio Meade also only scored 16.4% of the votes, finishing in third place, while the party only managed to elect 42 deputies (down from 203 of 2015) and 14 senators (down from 61 in 2012). The PRI was also defeated in each of the nine elections for state governor; the National Regeneration Movement won four, PAN three, and the Social Encounter Party and Citizens&#x27; Movement each with one.

Amid the party&#x27;s worsening electoral performance, it has attempted to redefine itself as a social democratic party since 2021. 

In the 2024 general election, as part of the Fuerza y Corazón por México coalition, the party supported independent candidate Xóchitl Gálvez (considered close to the National Action Party) for President, who finished in second place. The party recorded its worst result by vote share in its history, although narrowly managed to avoid its worst seat results thanks to a slight gain made in the Senate. It was also the first time in its history that the party failed to win at least 10 constituency seats in the Chamber of Deputies.

==In popular culture==
The 1999 film &quot;Herod&#x27;s Law&quot;, directed by Luis Estrada, is a political satire of corruption in Mexico under the PRI regime. It was notably the first film to criticize the PRI explicitly by name and carried some controversy and censorship attempts from the Mexican government because of it.

A latter Estrada film, &quot;The Perfect Dictatorship&quot; (2014), dealt with the political favoritism of Televisa towards the PRI, and the concept of the &quot;cortinas de humo (smoke screens)&quot; was explored in the Mexican black-comedy film, whose plot directly criticizes both the PRI and Televisa. Taking place in a Mexico with a tightly controlled media landscape, the plot centers around a corrupt politician (a fictional stand-in for Enrique Peña Nieto) from a political party (serving as a fictional stand-in for the PRI), and how he makes a deal with TV MX (which serves as a stand-in to Televisa) to manipulate the diffusion of news towards his benefit, in order to save his political career. The director made it based on the perceived media manipulation in Mexico.

<text>The Battle of Valcour Island, also known as the Battle of Valcour Bay, was a naval engagement that took place on October 11, 1776, on Lake Champlain. The main action took place in Valcour Bay, a narrow strait between the New York mainland and Valcour Island. The battle is generally regarded as one of the first naval battles of the American Revolutionary War, and one of the first fought by the United States Navy. Most of the ships in the American fleet under the command of Benedict Arnold were captured or destroyed by a British force under the overall direction of General Guy Carleton. However, the American defense of Lake Champlain stalled British plans to reach the upper Hudson River valley.

The Continental Army had retreated from Quebec to Fort Ticonderoga and Fort Crown Point in June 1776 after British forces were massively reinforced. They spent the summer of 1776 fortifying those forts and building additional ships to augment the small American fleet already on the lake. General Carleton had a 9,000 man army at Fort Saint-Jean, but needed to build a fleet to carry it on the lake. The Americans, during their retreat, had either taken or destroyed most of the ships on the lake. By early October, the British fleet, which significantly outgunned the American fleet, was ready for launch.

On October 11, Arnold drew the British fleet to a position he had carefully chosen to limit their advantages. In the battle that followed, many of the American ships were damaged or destroyed. That night, Arnold sneaked the American fleet past the British one, beginning a retreat toward Crown Point and Ticonderoga. Unfavorable weather hampered the American retreat, and more of the fleet was either captured or grounded and burned before it could reach Crown Point. Upon reaching Crown Point Arnold had the fort&#x27;s buildings burned and retreated to Ticonderoga.

The British fleet included four officers who later became admirals in the Royal Navy: Thomas Pringle, James Dacres, Edward Pellew, and John Schank. Valcour Bay, the site of the battle, is now a National Historic Landmark, as is , which sank shortly after the October 11 battle, and was raised in 1935. The underwater site of , located in 1997, is on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Background==

The American Revolutionary War, which began in April 1775 with the Battles of Lexington and Concord, widened in September 1775 when the Continental Army embarked on an invasion of the British Province of Quebec. The province was viewed by the Second Continental Congress as a potential avenue for British forces to attack and divide the rebellious colonies and was at the time lightly defended. The invasion reached a peak on December 31, 1775, when the Battle of Quebec ended in disaster for the Americans. In the spring of 1776, 10,000 British and German troops arrived in Quebec, and General Guy Carleton, the provincial governor, drove the Continental Army out of Quebec and back to Fort Ticonderoga.

Carleton then launched his own offensive intended to reach the Hudson River, whose navigable length begins south of Lake Champlain and extends down to New York City. Control of the upper Hudson would enable the British to link their forces in Quebec with those in New York, recently captured in the New York campaign by Major General William Howe. This strategy would separate the American colonies of New England from those farther south and potentially quash the rebellion. Lake Champlain, a long and relatively narrow lake formed by the action of glaciers during the last ice age, separates the Green Mountains of Vermont from the Adirondack Mountains of New York. Its length and maximum width creates more than of shoreline, with many bays, inlets, and promontories. More than 70 islands dot the surface, although during periods of low and high water, these numbers can change. The lake is relatively shallow, with an average depth of . Flowing south to north, the lake empties into the Richelieu River, where waterfalls at Saint-Jean in Quebec mark the northernmost point of navigation.

The American-held strongholds of Fort Crown Point and Fort Ticonderoga near the lake&#x27;s southern end protected access to the of the Hudson River. Elimination of these defenses required the transportation of troops and supplies from the British-controlled St. Lawrence Valley to the north. Roads were either difficult or nonexistent, making water transport on the lake the best option. The only ships on the lake after the American retreat from Quebec were a small fleet of lightly armed ships that Benedict Arnold had assembled following the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775. This fleet, even if it had been in British hands, was too small to transport the large British Army to Fort Ticonderoga.

==Prelude==
During their retreat from Quebec, the Americans carefully took or destroyed all ships on Lake Champlain that might prove useful to the British. When Arnold and his troops, making up the rear guard of the army, abandoned Fort Saint-Jean, they burned or sank all the boats they could not use, and set fire to the sawmill and the fort. These actions effectively denied the British any hope of immediately moving onto the lake.

The two sides set about building fleets: the British at Saint-Jean and the Americans at the other end of the lake in Skenesborough (present-day Whitehall, New York). While planning Quebec&#x27;s defenses in 1775, General Carleton had anticipated the problem of transportation on Lake Champlain, and had requested the provisioning of prefabricated ships from Europe. By the time Carleton&#x27;s army reached Saint-Jean, ten such ships had arrived. These ships and more were assembled by skilled shipwrights on the upper Richelieu River. Also assembled there was the &quot;Inflexible&quot;, a 180-ton warship they disassembled at Quebec City and transported upriver in pieces. In total, the British fleet (25 armed vessels) had more firepower than the Americans&#x27; 15 vessels, with more than 80 guns outweighing the 74 smaller American guns. Two of Carleton&#x27;s ships, &quot;Inflexible&quot; (18 12-pounders) and &quot;Thunderer&quot; (six 24-pound guns, six 12-pound guns, and two howitzers), by themselves outgunned the combined firepower of the American fleet. In addition to &quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Thunderer&quot;, the fleet included the schooners , (14 guns), (12 guns), and &quot;Loyal Convert&quot; (6 guns), and 20 single-masted gunboats each armed with two cannons.

The American generals leading their shipbuilding effort encountered a variety of challenges. Shipwright was not a common occupation in the relative wilderness of upstate New York, and the Continental Navy had to pay extremely high wages to lure skilled craftsmen away from the coast. The carpenters hired to build boats on Lake Champlain were the best-paid employees of the navy, excepting only the Navy&#x27;s Commodore, Esek Hopkins. By the end of July there were more than 200 shipwrights at Skenesborough. In addition to skilled help, materials and supplies specific to maritime use needed to be brought to Skenesborough, where the ships were constructed, or Fort Ticonderoga, where they were fitted out for use.

The shipbuilding at Skenesborough was overseen by Hermanus Schuyler (possibly a relation of Major General Philip Schuyler), and the outfitting was managed by military engineer Jeduthan Baldwin. Schuyler began work in April to produce boats larger and more suitable for combat than the small shallow-draft boats known as bateaux that were used for transport on the lake. The process eventually came to involve General Arnold, who was an experienced ship&#x27;s captain, and David Waterbury, a Connecticut militia leader with maritime experience. Major General Horatio Gates, in charge of the entire shipbuilding effort, eventually asked Arnold to take more responsibility in the effort, because &quot;I am intirely uninform&#x27;d as to Marine Affairs.&quot;

Arnold took up the task with relish, and Gates rewarded him with command of the fleet, writing that &quot;[Arnold] has a perfect knowledge in maritime affairs, and is, besides, a most gallant and deserving officer.&quot; Arnold&#x27;s appointment was not without trouble; Jacobus Wynkoop, who had been in command of the fleet, refused to accept that Gates had authority over him and had to be arrested. The shipbuilding was significantly slowed in mid-August by an outbreak of disease among the shipwrights. Although the army leadership had been scrupulous about keeping people infected with smallpox segregated from others, the disease that slowed the shipbuilding for several weeks was some kind of fever.

While both sides busied themselves with shipbuilding, the growing American fleet patrolled the waters of Lake Champlain. At one point in August, Arnold sailed part of the fleet to the northernmost end of the lake, within of Saint-Jean, and formed a battle line. A British outpost, well out of range, fired a few shots at the line without effect. On September 30, expecting the British to sail soon, Arnold retreated to the shelter of Valcour Island. During his patrols of the lake Arnold had commanded the fleet from the schooner , carrying 12 guns and captained by David Hawley. When it came time for the battle, Arnold transferred his flag to , a row galley. Other ships in the fleet included and , also two-masted schooners carrying 8 guns, as well as , a sloop (12 guns), and 8 gundalows outfitted as gunboats (each with three guns): , , , , , &quot;Connecticut&quot;, &quot;Jersey&quot;, , the cutter &quot;Lee&quot;, and the row galleys and . &quot;Liberty&quot; was not present at the battle, having been sent to Ticonderoga for provisions.

Arnold, whose business activities before the war had included sailing ships to Europe and the West Indies, carefully chose the site where he wanted to meet the British fleet. Reliable intelligence he received on October 1 indicated that the British had a force significantly more powerful than his. Because his force was inferior, he chose the narrow, rocky body of water between the western shore of Lake Champlain and Valcour Island (near modern Plattsburgh, New York), where the British fleet would have difficulty bringing its superior firepower to bear, and where the inferior seamanship of his relatively unskilled sailors would have a minimal negative effect. Some of Arnold&#x27;s captains wanted to fight in open waters where they might be able to retreat to the shelter of Fort Crown Point, but Arnold argued that the primary purpose of the fleet was not survival but the delay of a British advance on Crown Point and Ticonderoga until the following spring.

==Battle==
Carleton&#x27;s fleet, commanded by Captain Thomas Pringle and including 50 unarmed support vessels, sailed onto Lake Champlain on October 9. They cautiously advanced southward, searching for signs of Arnold&#x27;s fleet. On the night of October 10, the fleet anchored about to the north of Arnold&#x27;s position, still unaware of his location. The next day, they continued to sail south, assisted by favorable winds. After they passed the northern tip of Valcour Island, Arnold sent out &quot;Congress&quot; and &quot;Royal Savage&quot; to draw the attention of the British. Following an inconsequential exchange of fire with the British, the two ships tried to return to Arnold&#x27;s crescent-shaped firing line. However, &quot;Royal Savage&quot; was unable to fight the headwinds, and ran aground on the southern tip of Valcour Island. Some of the British gunboats swarmed toward her, as Captain Hawley and his men hastily abandoned ship. Men from &quot;Loyal Convert&quot; boarded her, capturing 20 men in the process, but were then forced to abandon her under heavy fire from the Americans. Many of Arnold&#x27;s papers were lost with the destruction of &quot;Royal Savage&quot;, which was burned by the British.

The British gunboats and &quot;Carleton&quot; then maneuvered within range of the American line. &quot;Thunderer&quot; and &quot;Maria&quot; were unable to make headway against the winds, and did not participate in the battle, while &quot;Inflexible&quot; eventually came far enough up the strait to participate in the action. Around 12:30 pm, the battle began in earnest, with both sides firing broadsides and cannonades at each other, and continued all afternoon. &quot;Revenge&quot; was heavily hit; &quot;Philadelphia&quot; was also heavily damaged and eventually sank around 6:30 pm. &quot;Carleton&quot;, whose guns wrought havoc against the smaller American gundalows, became a focus of attention. A lucky shot eventually snapped the line holding her broadside in position, and she was seriously damaged before she could be towed out of range of the American line. Her casualties were significant; eight men were killed and another eight wounded. The young Edward Pellew, serving as a midshipman aboard &quot;Carleton&quot;, distinguished himself by ably commanding the vessel to safety when its senior officers, including its captain, Lieutenant James Dacres, were injured. Another lucky American shot hit a British gunboat&#x27;s magazine and the vessel exploded.

Toward sunset, &quot;Inflexible&quot; finally reached the action. Her big guns quickly silenced most of Arnold&#x27;s fleet. The British also began landing Native allies on both Valcour Island and the lakeshore, in order to deny the Americans the possibility of retreating to land. As darkness fell, the American fleet retreated, and the British called off the attack, in part because some boats had run out of ammunition. Lieutenant James Hadden, commanding one of the British gunboats, noted that &quot;little more than one third of the British Fleet&quot; saw much action that day.

==Retreat==
When the sun set on October 11, the battle had clearly gone against the Americans. Most of the American ships were damaged or sinking, and the crews reported around 60 casualties. The British reported around 40 casualties on their ships. Aware that he could not defeat the British fleet, Arnold decided to try reaching the cover of Fort Crown Point, about to the south. Under the cover of a dark and foggy night, the fleet, with muffled oars and minimal illumination, threaded its way through a gap about one mile (1.6 km) wide between the British ships and the western shore, where Indian campfires burned. By morning, they had reached Schuyler Island, about south. Carleton, upset that the Americans had escaped him, immediately sent his fleet around Valcour Island to find them. Realizing the Americans were not there, he regrouped his fleet and sent scouts to find Arnold.

Adverse winds as well as damaged and leaky boats slowed the American fleet&#x27;s progress. At Schuyler Island, &quot;Providence&quot; and &quot;Jersey&quot; were sunk or burned, and crude repairs were effected to other vessels. The cutter &quot;Lee&quot; was also abandoned on the western shore and eventually taken by the British. Around 2:00 pm, the fleet sailed again, trying to make headway against biting winds, rain, and sleet. By the following morning, the ships were still more than from Crown Point, and the British fleet&#x27;s masts were visible on the horizon. When the wind finally changed, the British had its advantage first. They closed once again, opening fire on &quot;Congress&quot; and &quot;Washington&quot;, which were in the rear of the American fleet. Arnold first decided to attempt grounding the slower gunboats at Split Rock, short of Crown Point. &quot;Washington&quot;, however, was too badly damaged and too slow to make it, and she was forced to strike her colors and surrender; 110 men were taken prisoner.

Arnold then led many of the remaining smaller craft into a small bay on the Vermont shore now named Arnold&#x27;s Bay 2 miles south of Buttonmold Bay, where the waters were too shallow for the larger British vessels to follow. These boats were then run aground, stripped, and set on fire, with their flags still flying. Arnold, the last to land, personally torched his flagship &quot;Congress&quot;. The surviving ships&#x27; crews, numbering about 200, then made their way overland to Crown Point, narrowly escaping an Indian ambush. There they found &quot;Trumbull&quot;, &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and &quot;Revenge&quot;, all of which had escaped the British fleet, as well as &quot;Liberty&quot;, which had just arrived with supplies from Ticonderoga.

==Aftermath==
Arnold, convinced that Crown Point was no longer viable as a point of defense against the large British force, destroyed and abandoned the fort, moving the forces stationed there to Ticonderoga. General Carleton, rather than shipping his prisoners back to Quebec, returned them to Ticonderoga under a flag of truce. On their arrival, the released men were so effusive in their praise of Carleton that they were sent home to prevent the desertion of other troops.

With control of the lake, the British landed troops and occupied Crown Point the next day. They remained for two weeks, pushing scouting parties to within three miles (4.8 km) of Ticonderoga. The battle-season was getting late as the first snow began to fall on October 20 and his supply line would be difficult to manage in winter, so Carleton decided to withdraw north to winter quarters; Arnold&#x27;s plan of delay had succeeded. Baron Riedesel, commanding the Hessians in Carleton&#x27;s army, noted that, &quot;If we could have begun our expedition four weeks earlier, I am satisfied that everything could have ended this year.&quot;

The 1777 British campaign, led by Lieutenant General John Burgoyne, was halted by Continental forces, some led with vigor by General Arnold, in the Battles of Saratoga. Burgoyne&#x27;s subsequent surrender paved the way for the entry of France into the war as an American ally.

The captains of &quot;Maria&quot;, &quot;Inflexible&quot;, and &quot;Loyal Convert&quot; wrote a letter criticizing Captain Pringle for making Arnold&#x27;s escape possible by failing to properly blockade the channel, and for not being more aggressive in directing the battle. Apparently the letter did not cause any career problems for Pringle or its authors; he and John Schank, captain of &quot;Inflexible&quot;, became admirals, as did midshipman Pellew and Lieutenant Dacres. Carleton was awarded the Order of the Bath by King George III for his success at Valcour Island. On December 31, 1776, one year after the Battle of Quebec, a mass was held in celebration of the British success, and Carleton threw a grand ball.

The loss of Benedict Arnold&#x27;s papers aboard &quot;Royal Savage&quot; was to have important consequences later in his career. For a variety of reasons, Congress ordered an inquiry into his conduct of the Quebec campaign, which included a detailed look at his claims for compensation. The inquiry took place in late 1779, when Arnold was in military command of Philadelphia and recuperating from serious wounds received at Saratoga. Congress found that he owed it money since he could not produce receipts for expenses he claimed to have paid from his own funds. Although Arnold had already been secretly negotiating with the British over a change of allegiance since May 1779, this news contributed to his decision to resign the command of Philadelphia. His next command was West Point, which he sought with the intention of facilitating its surrender to the British. His plot was however exposed in September 1780, at which time he fled to the British in New York City.

==Legacy==
In the 1930s, Lorenzo Hagglund, a veteran of World War I and a history buff, began searching the strait for remains of the battle. In 1932 he found the remains of &quot;Royal Savage&quot;″s hull, which he successfully raised in 1934. Stored for more than fifty years, the remains were sold by his son to the National Civil War Museum. As of March 2009, the remains were in a city garage in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The city of Plattsburgh, New York, has claimed ownership of the remains and would like them returned to upstate New York.

In 1935, Hagglund followed up his discovery of &quot;Royal Savage&quot; with the discovery of &quot;Philadelphia&quot;″s remains, sitting upright on the lake bottom. He raised her that year; she is now on display at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is designated a National Historic Landmark. The site of the battle, Valcour Bay, was declared a National Historic Landmark on January 1, 1961, and added to the National Register on October 15, 1966. A small stone monument commemorating the battle sits on the mainland along U.S. Route 9 overlooking Valcour Island.

In 1997, another pristine underwater wreck was located during a survey by the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum. Two years later it was conclusively identified as the gundalow &quot;Spitfire&quot;; this site was listed on the National Register in 2008, and it has been named as part of the U.S. government&#x27;s Save America&#x27;s Treasures program.

<doc id="88384" wikidata="Q4176" url="?curid=88384" title="Cologne Cathedral">
<text>Cologne Cathedral (, , officially , English: Cathedral Church of Saint Peter) is a cathedral in Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia belonging to the Catholic Church. It is the seat of the Archbishop of Cologne and of the administration of the Archdiocese of Cologne. It is a renowned monument of German Catholicism and Gothic architecture and was declared a World Heritage Site in 1996. It is Germany&#x27;s most visited landmark, attracting an average of 6 million people a year. At , the cathedral is the tallest twin-spired church in the world, the second tallest church in Europe after Ulm Minster, and the third tallest church of any kind in the world.

Construction of Cologne Cathedral began in 1248 but was halted in the years around 1560, unfinished. Attempts to complete the construction began around 1814 but the project was not properly funded until the 1840s. The edifice was completed to its original medieval plan in 1880. The towers for its two huge spires give the cathedral the largest façade of any church in the world.

Cologne&#x27;s medieval builders had planned a grand structure to house the reliquary of the Three Kings and fit for its role as a place of worship for the Holy Roman Emperor. Despite having been left incomplete during the medieval period, Cologne Cathedral eventually became unified as &quot;a masterpiece of exceptional intrinsic value&quot; and &quot;a powerful testimony to the strength and persistence of Christian belief in medieval and modern Europe&quot;. In Cologne, only the telecommunications tower is higher than the cathedral.

== Predecessor buildings ==

=== Merovingian episcopal church ===

Maternus of Cologne was the first bishop of Cologne in around 313. However, Cologne&#x27;s Christian community, still small at this time, did not gather in a church, but in a residential building, which is thought to have been located on the cathedral hill below today&#x27;s choir. After the collapse of Roman rule on the Rhine, the Merovingian petty kings residing in Cologne built an episcopal church on this site in the 6th century, which was eventually around 40 to 50 meters long and equipped with an ambon. This building, which was probably built by King Theudebert I, served as a burial place for the royal family; among others, the king&#x27;s wife Wisigard was buried here around 537. However, the excavation finds under the cathedral choir do not allow a complete reconstruction of the buildings from the Merovingian period.

=== Baptistry ===

Work on Cologne Cathedral was finally finished in 1880. At that time, the Cathedral had a height of 157 metres, making it the tallest building in the world — after a total of 632 years of construction. And except for a few centimetres, the two towers are even the same height. Already in late antiquity, there was a baptistery to the east of the cathedral choir, where the early Christians, following the rite of the time, stepped into knee-deep water and were completely doused. It is assumed that the baptismal font (piscina), which dates back to the 5th century, was originally located in the garden of the Roman house that served as a Christian meeting place. Later, the baptistry built above the pool was presumably combined with the cathedral church to form a single building complex, although there is no archaeological evidence of this today. When Hildebold Cathedral was built and equipped with a baptismal font due to the changed rite, only the baptismal piscina remained from the baptistery. Today, this piscina, which is accessible in the base of the cathedral, is considered the oldest evidence of Christian worship in Cologne.

=== Hildebold Cathedral ===


In Carolingian times, the Old Cathedral was built on Cologne Cathedral Hill and consecrated in 870. The cathedral is now known as Hildebold Cathedral after Bishop Hildebold, who was a close advisor to Charlemagne and died in 818. However, it is unclear how much the bishop contributed to the building. He probably started the new construction, which Charlemagne also generously supported. The bishop&#x27;s residence was originally located next to the cathedral.

With a length of around 95 meters, Hildebold Cathedral was one of the largest Carolingian churches ever built and became the architectural rolemodel for numerous churches in the early Holy Roman Empire. It was built in the Carolingian tradition as a basilica with two choirs, with the east choir dedicated to Mary, mother of Jesus and the more important choir in the west to the memory of Saint Peter. Through its patronage, but also in its architecture, Hildebold Cathedral made reference to Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome and was regarded as the St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica of the North. This was intended to underline Cologne&#x27;s claim to be a holy city and faithful daughter of the Roman Church. The so-called reliquary-staff of Saint Peter and the chains of Saint Peter were among the church&#x27;s most important relics. The Hillinus Codex from the 11th century shows Hildebold Cathedral in an unusually realistic depiction for the time. Today, the foundation walls of the Carolingian basilica have been revealed by the cathedral excavations.

On 23 July 1164, the Archbishop of Cologne and Imperial Archchancellor Rainald of Dassel brought the bones of the Three Wise Men from Milan to Cologne, which was perceived as a &quot;propaganda success&quot;. The relics had been left to the archbishop by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa from his spoils of war. They had been considered worthy of veneration at least since their transfer. Whether Rainald von Dassel himself or the Milanese patricians should be regarded as the &quot;inventors&quot; of the relics is disputed in academic literature. In any case, between 1190 and 1225, the Shrine of the Three Kings was made for the highly respected saints in Cologne, which is considered one of the most sophisticated goldsmith&#x27;s works of the Middle Ages; the shrine was placed in the center of the Old Cathedral. Cologne thus became an internationally renowned place of pilgrimage in Europe. To oversee the pilgrim crowds, an office of custos regum (&quot;guardian of the kings&quot;) was established after 1162. However, the only narrow side portal of the cathedral was not very suitable for the crowds of pilgrims, as it had to be used as an entrance and an exit at the same time.

With the construction of the Gothic cathedral in 1248, the Old Cathedral was to be demolished step by step. However, careless demolition work and fire destroyed not only the east choir, but almost the entire cathedral; the Shrine of the Three Kings was saved from the fire. The western parts of Hildebold Cathedral were provisionally rebuilt and were only taken down after 1322, when the Gothic choir was completed and construction of the Gothic nave began.

== Building history of the Gothic cathedral ==

=== Medieval beginning ===

The foundation stone was laid on Saturday, 15 August 1248, by Archbishop Konrad von Hochstaden. The eastern arm was completed under the direction of Master Gerhard, was consecrated in 1322 and sealed off by a temporary wall so it could be used as the work continued. Eighty-four misericords in the choir date from this building phase.. This work ceased in 1473, leaving the south tower complete to the belfry level and crowned with a huge crane that remained in place as a landmark of the Cologne skyline for 400 years. Some work proceeded intermittently on the structure of the nave between the west front and the eastern arm, but during the 16th century this also stopped.

=== 19th-century completion ===

With the 19th-century Romantic enthusiasm for the Middle Ages, and spurred by the discovery of the original plan for the façade, the Protestant Prussian Court working with the church, committed to complete the cathedral. It was achieved by civic effort; the &quot;Central-Dombauverein&quot;, founded in 1842, raised two-thirds of the enormous costs, while the Prussian state supplied the remaining third. The state saw this as a way to improve its relations with the large number of Catholic subjects it had gained in 1815, but especially after 1871, it was regarded as a project to symbolize German nationhood.

Work resumed in 1842 to the original design of the surviving medieval plans and drawings, but using more modern construction techniques, including iron roof girders. The nave was completed and the towers were added. The bells were installed in the 1870s. The largest bell is &quot;St. Petersglocke&quot;.

The completion of Germany&#x27;s largest cathedral was celebrated as a national event on 15 October 1880, 632 years after construction had begun. The celebration was attended by Emperor Wilhelm I. With a height of , it was the tallest building in the world for four years until the completion of the Washington Monument.

=== World War II and post-war history ===

The twin spires of the cathedral were an easily recognizable navigational landmark for Allied aircraft bombing during World War II. The cathedral suffered fourteen hits by aerial bombs during the war. Badly damaged, it nevertheless remained standing in an otherwise completely flattened city.

On 6 March 1945, an area west of the cathedral (Marzellenstrasse/Trankgasse) was the site of intense combat between American tanks of the 3rd Armored Division and a Panther Ausf. A of Panzer brigade 106 Feldherrnhalle. A nearby Panther, a German medium tank, was sitting by a pile of rubble near a train station right by the twin spires of the Cologne Cathedral. The Panther successfully knocked out two Sherman tanks, killing three men, before it was destroyed by a T26E3 Pershing, nicknamed Eagle 7, minutes later. Film footage of that battle survives.

Repairs of the war damage were completed in 1956. A repair to part of the northwest tower, carried out in 1944 using poor-quality brick taken from a nearby ruined building, remained visible as a reminder of the war until 2005, when it was restored to its original appearance.

To investigate whether the bombings had damaged the foundations of the Dom, archaeological excavations began in 1946 under the leadership of Otto Doppelfeld and were concluded in 1997. One of the most meaningful excavations of churches, they revealed previously unknown details of earlier buildings on the site.

Repair and maintenance work is constantly being carried out in the building, which is rarely free of scaffolding, as wind, rain, and pollution slowly eat away at the stones. The &quot;Dombauhütte&quot;, established to build the cathedral and keep it in repair, employs skilled stonemasons for the purpose. Half the costs of repair and maintenance are still borne by the Dombauverein.

=== 21st century ===
On 18 August 2005, Pope Benedict XVI visited the cathedral during his apostolic visit to Germany, as part of World Youth Day 2005 festivities. An estimated one million pilgrims visited the cathedral during this time. Also as part of the events of World Youth Day, Cologne Cathedral hosted a televised gala performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Missa Solemnis, performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Choir conducted by Gilbert Levine.

On 25 August 2007, the cathedral received a new stained glass window in the south transept. The glass work was created by the German artist Gerhard Richter with the €400,000 cost paid by donations. It is composed of 11,500 identically sized pieces of coloured glass resembling pixels, randomly arranged by computer, which create a colourful &quot;carpet&quot;. Since the loss of the original window in World War II, the space had been temporarily filled with plain glass. The then archbishop of the cathedral, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, who had preferred a figurative depiction of 20th-century Catholic martyrs for the window, did not attend the unveiling. Holder of the office since 2014 is Cardinal Rainer Maria Woelki.
On 5 January 2015, the cathedral remained dark as floodlights were switched off to protest a demonstration by PEGIDA.

===World Heritage Site===

In 1996, the cathedral was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List of culturally important sites. In 2004, it was placed on the &quot;World Heritage in Danger&quot; list, as the only Western site in danger, due to plans to construct several high-rise buildings nearby, which would have visually impacted the site. The cathedral was removed from the &quot;in danger&quot; list in 2006, following the authorities&#x27; decision to limit the heights of buildings constructed near and around the cathedral.

As a World Heritage Site and host to the Shrine of the Three Kings, Cologne Cathedral is a major attraction for tourists and pilgrims, and is one of the oldest and most important pilgrimage sites of Northern Europe. Visitors can climb 533 stone steps of the spiral staircase to a viewing platform about above the ground. The platform gives a scenic view over the Rhine.

== Ongoing renovation ==

The cathedral is a medieval building that was built very solidly from a structural point of view. At the same time, however, the stone structure requires continuous maintenance and renovation. The cathedral&#x27;s master builder Barbara Schock-Werner said: &quot;Cologne Cathedral without scaffolding is not a pipe dream, but a nightmare. It would mean that we would no longer be able to afford the cathedral.&quot;

In fact, the completed cathedral was only visible without scaffolding for a few years. After the official completion of the cathedral in 1880, finishing work continued for around 20 years. Shortly before his death in 1902, master builder Richard Voigtel publicly stated that the cathedral had finally been completed. However, after the wings of an angel figure fell from the façade in 1906, the cathedral master builders resumed the renovation work.

The cathedral is built from different types of rock, which weather to varying degrees due to their characteristics. The filigree buttresses and arches are exposed to the weather from all sides and are attacked by water, the sulphur content of the air and bird droppings. Especially from the 1960s onwards, acid rain severely affected the stones and turned them increasingly black. It was only from the 1990s onwards that air pollution control measures reduced the level of pollution.

The Schlaitdorf sandstone, which was used from 1842 onwards for the transept façades and the upper parts of the nave and transept, shows the most intensive weathering. It is therefore constantly being renewed and until the 1980s was preferably replaced with Londorf basalt lava, which is considered to be very weather-resistant, but is not sandy beige, but grey in color. Since the 1990s, however, the cathedral master builders have endeavored to carry out the restoration with stones that come as close as possible to the original sandstone. The cathedral works (Dombauhütte) has already tested numerous means of preserving the stones. A convincing method has not yet been found. In addition, the iron anchors and dowels that hold the many parts of the architectural decoration are also beginning to rust. They are threatening to crack the stones and need to be replaced with steel parts. &quot;It is therefore foreseeable that no one alive today will ever see the cathedral without scaffolding.&quot;

Regular renovation work is required due to sporadic earthquake damage. For example, during the 1992 Roermond earthquake, the 400 kg finial on the eastern pinnacle of the southern transept gable broke off, smashed through the roof and damaged the roof truss. Four other finials were loosened.

From May to November 2021, a remote-controlled drone took 200,000 high-resolution photos of all parts of the façade from a distance of five to seven meters and assembled them into a digital 3D model of the cathedral, which offers a very accurate representation with 25 billion polygons. This makes it possible to precisely document the current condition and the need for conservation and restoration, even in remote areas. The 3D model has a size of 50 gigabytes. The cost of creating the model was in the six-figure range.

== Architecture ==
The ground plan design of Cologne Cathedral was based closely on that of Amiens Cathedral, as is the style and the width to height proportion of the central nave. The plan is in the shape of a Latin Cross, as is usual with Gothic cathedrals. It has two aisles on either side, which help support one of the very highest Gothic vaults in the world, being nearly as tall as that of the Beauvais Cathedral, much of which was never built or had collapsed. Externally the outward thrust of the vault is taken by flying buttresses in the French manner. The eastern end has a single ambulatory, the second aisle resolving into a &quot;chevet&quot; of seven radiating chapels.

Internally, the medieval choir is more varied and less mechanical in its details than the 19th-century building. It presents a French style arrangement of very tall arcade, a delicate narrow triforium gallery lit by windows and with detailed tracery merging with that of the windows above. The clerestory windows are tall and retain some old figurative glass in the lower sections. The whole is united by the tall shafts that sweep unbroken from the floor to their capitals at the spring of the vault. The vault is of plain quadripartite arrangement.

The choir retains a great many of its original fittings, including the carved stalls, despite French Revolutionary troops having desecrated the building. A large stone statue of St Christopher looks down towards the place where the earlier entrance to the cathedral was, before its completion in the late 19th century.

The nave has many 19th century stained glass windows. A set of five on the south side, called the &quot;Bayernfenster&quot;, were a gift from Ludwig I of Bavaria, and strongly represent the painterly German style of the time.

Externally, particularly from a distance, the building is dominated by its huge spires, which are entirely Germanic in character, being openwork like those of Ulm, Vienna, Strasbourg and Regensburg Cathedrals.

== Dimensions ==

== Treasures ==
One of the treasures of the cathedral is the high altar, which was installed in 1322. It is constructed of black marble, with a solid slab long forming the top. The front and sides are overlaid with white marble niches into which are set figures, with the Coronation of the Virgin at the centre. Joan Holladay has discussed the iconography of the high altar in the cathedral.

The most celebrated work of art in the cathedral is the &quot;Shrine of the Three Kings&quot;, commissioned by Philip von Heinsberg, archbishop of Cologne from 1167 to 1191 and created by Nicholas of Verdun, begun in 1190. It is traditionally believed to hold the remains of the Three Wise Men, whose relics were acquired by Frederick Barbarossa at the conquest of Milan in 1164. The shrine takes the form of a large reliquary in the shape of a basilican church, made of bronze and silver, gilded and ornamented with architectonic details, figurative sculpture, enamels and gemstones. The shrine was opened in 1864 and was found to contain bones and garments.

Near the sacristy is the &quot;Gero Crucifix&quot;, a large crucifix carved in oak and with traces of paint and gilding. Believed to have been commissioned around 960 for Archbishop Gero, it is the oldest large crucifix north of the Alps and the earliest-known large free-standing Northern sculpture of the medieval period.

In the Sacrament Chapel is the &quot;Mailänder Madonna&quot; (&quot;Milan Madonna&quot;), a high Gothic carving, depicting the Blessed Virgin and the infant Jesus. It was made in the Cologne Cathedral workshop sometime around 1290 as a replacement for the original which was lost in a fire. The altar of the patron saints of Cologne with an altarpiece by the International Gothic painter Stefan Lochner is in the &quot;Marienkapelle&quot; (&quot;St. Mary&#x27;s Chapel&quot;).

After completion in 1265, the radiating chapels were immediately taken into service as a burial place. The relics of Saint Irmgardis found a final resting place in the St. Agnes&#x27; Chapel. Her trachyte sarcophagus is considered to be created by the cathedral masons&#x27; guild around 1280.
Other works of art are in the Cathedral Treasury.

Embedded in the interior wall are a pair of stone tablets on which are carved the provisions formulated by Archbishop Englebert II (1262–67) under which Jews were permitted to reside in Cologne.

== Church music ==
Cologne Cathedral has two pipe organs by Klais Orgelbau: the Transept Organ, built in 1948, and the Nave Organ, built in 1998. Cathedral organists have included Josef Zimmermann, Clemens Ganz (1985–2001) and Winfried Bönig (2001).

=== Bells ===
The cathedral has eleven church bells, four of which are medieval. The first was the 3.8-tonne &quot;Dreikönigsglocke&quot; (&quot;Bell of the Three Kings&quot;), cast in 1418, installed in 1437, and recast in 1880. Two of the other bells, the &quot;Pretiosa&quot; (10.5 tonnes; at that time the largest bell in the Western world) and the &quot;Speciosa&quot; (5.6 tonnes) were installed in 1448 and remain in place today.
During the 19th century, as the building neared completion, there was a desire to increase the number of bells. This was facilitated by Kaiser Wilhelm I who gave French bronze cannon, captured in 1870–71, for this purpose. The 22 pieces of artillery were displayed outside the cathedral on 11 May 1872. Andreas Hamm in Frankenthal used them to cast a bell of over 27,000 kilos on 19 August 1873. The tone was not harmonious and another attempt was made on 13 November 1873. The Central Cathedral Association, which had agreed to take over the costs, did not want this bell either. Another attempt took place on 3 October 1874. The colossal bell was shipped to Cologne and on 13 May 1875, installed in the cathedral. This &quot;Kaiserglocke&quot; was eventually melted in 1918 to support the German war effort. The Kaiserglocke was the largest free-swinging bell in history.
The 24-tonne &quot;St. Petersglocke&quot; (&quot;Bell of St. Peter&quot;, &quot;&quot;&quot; in the Kölsch language or in common parlance known as &quot;Dicker Pitter&quot;&quot;), was cast in 1922 and was the largest free-swinging bell in the world, until a new bell was cast in Innsbruck for the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral in Bucharest, Romania. This bell is only rung on eight major holidays such as Easter and Christmas.

On Thursday, 3 March 2022, landmark cathedrals across Europe chimed in unison &quot;in a gesture of solidarity with Ukraine, as bystanders gathered to mourn those killed during Russia&#x27;s invasion and pray for peace.&quot; The &quot;Kölner Dom&quot; was among them.

<text>Helheim is a Norwegian black metal band from Bergen, formed in 1992.

== History ==

Helheim was founded in 1992 by V&#x27;gandr (bass, vocals) and H&#x27;grimnir (guitar, vocals), who added drummer Hrymr. The band began performing in local Bergen festivals, and in 1993, the band released their debut demo, &quot;Helheim&quot;, distributed only within Norway.

Soon after the release of their first demo, the band began working on new material, again as a three-piece after Nidhogg, who had joined the band briefly, left the band again. In mid-1994, the band&#x27;s second demo, &quot;Nidr ok Nordr liggr Helvegr&quot;, (&quot;Netherwards and Northwards lies Helheim&quot;) was released, and caught the attention of German label Solistitium (now Millennium Music). The band signed to the label and released their debut album, &quot;Jormundgand&quot; (named for the World Serpent, Jörmungandr), which was recorded in Grieghallen in 1995. In 1996, Helheim followed up with a European tour.

After the tour, the band began recording their second album, &quot;Av Norrøn Ætt&quot; (&quot;Of Norse Lineage&quot;). With the release of the second album, the band&#x27;s contract to Solistitium Records was fulfilled, and the band was without a label for two years. Finally, in 1999, the label Ars Metalli got in touch with Helheim, wanting to sign them for a one-album contract. The band members were initially apprehensive that the mainly underground label would be able to promote them adequately, but they were eager to begin work on new material. After the band signed to the label, they were joined by Lindheim on synthesizer and Thorbjørn on lead guitars.

Utilizing a new producer, Odd Kronheim of the S.J.E.F Studio, the band recorded the MCD &quot;Terrorveldet&quot; (&quot;The Realm of Terror&quot;), and then another full-length album, &quot;Blod &amp; Ild&quot; (&quot;Blood &amp; Fire&quot;). Both albums received acclaim from the Norwegian metal press, the international press, and metal scenes. The CD also included their first music video, for the song &quot;Jernskogen&quot; (&quot;The Ironforest&quot;) taken from the &quot;Blod &amp; Ild&quot; release. In 2001, the band attempted to publish another MCD, &quot;Helsviti&quot; (&quot;Hell&#x27;s Punishment&quot;), but due to difficulties with Ars Metalli this release was postponed indefinitely.

Despite these troubles, the band returned to Grieghallen to begin work on their next album, &quot;Yersinia Pestis&quot;. Massacre Records took the responsibility of releasing and distributing the album, which was well received by both critics and fans. Due to a lack of promotion, however, the album did not reach many fans outside of Norway. Massacre Records had initially agreed to publish the previously recorded MCD &quot;Helsviti&quot; as well, but this never came about.

In 2005, Lindheim decided to leave the band. In June 2006, the band released their fifth full-length album, &quot;The Journeys and Experiences of Death&quot;, a concept album focusing mainly on the Vikings&#x27; beliefs concerning death. The first 2,000 copies of the album were published through local label Dark Essence Records as a double digipack, which included, finally, the release of the MCD &quot;Helsviti&quot;.

<text>AppleScript is a scripting language created by Apple Inc. that facilitates automated control of Mac applications. First introduced in System 7, it is currently included in macOS in a package of automation tools. The term &quot;AppleScript&quot; may refer to the scripting language, to a script written in the language, or to the macOS Open Scripting Architecture that underlies the language.

AppleScript is primarily a mechanism for driving Apple events an inter-application communication (IAC) technology that exchanges data between and controls applications. Additionally, AppleScript supports basic calculations and text processing, and is extensible via scripting additions that add functions to the language. 

AppleScript is tightly bound to the MacOS environment as are other command languages such as Unix shell, Windows Script Host and Rexx. In other words, AppleScript is not a general purpose scripting language like Python. One way that AppleScript is bound to the unique aspects of its environment is that it relies on applications to publish &quot;dictionaries&quot; of addressable objects and operations.

As is typical of a command language, AppleScript is not designed to directly perform intensive processing. For example, a script cannot efficiently perform intensive math operations or complicated text processing. However, AppleScript can be used in combination with other tools and technologies which allows it to leverage more efficient programming contexts.

The language has aspects of structured, procedural, object-oriented and natural language programming, but does not strictly conform to any of these paradigms.

== History ==
In the late 1980s, Apple considered using HyperCard&#x27;s HyperTalk scripting language as the standard language for end-user development across the company and within its classic Mac OS operating system, and for interprocess communication between Apple and non-Apple products. HyperTalk could be used by novices to program a HyperCard stack. Apple engineers recognized that a similar, but more object-oriented scripting language could be designed to be used with any application, and the AppleScript project was born as a spin-off of a research effort to modernize the Macintosh as a whole and finally became part of System 7.

AppleScript was released in October 1993 as part of System 7.1.1 (System 7 Pro, the first major upgrade to System 7). QuarkXPress (ver. 3.2) was one of the first major software applications that supported AppleScript. This, in turn, led to AppleScript being widely adopted within the publishing and prepress world, often tying together complex workflows. This was a key factor in retaining the Macintosh&#x27;s dominant position in publishing and prepress, even after QuarkXpress and other publishing applications were ported to Microsoft Windows.

After some uncertainty about the future of AppleScript on Apple&#x27;s next generation OS, the move to Mac OS X (around 2002) and its Cocoa frameworks greatly increased the usefulness and flexibility of AppleScript. Cocoa applications allow application developers to implement basic scriptability for their apps with minimal effort, broadening the number of applications that are directly scriptable. At the same time, the shift to the Unix underpinnings and AppleScript&#x27;s ability to run Unix commands directly, with the codice_1 command, allowed AppleScripts much greater control over the operating system itself. AppleScript Studio, released with Mac OS X 10.2 as part of Xcode, and later AppleScriptObjC framework, released in Mac OS X 10.6, allowed users to build Cocoa applications using AppleScript.

In a 2006 article, &quot;Macworld&quot; included AppleScript among its rankings of Apple&#x27;s 30 most significant products to date, placing it at #17.

In a 2013 article for &quot;Macworld&quot;, veteran Mac software developer and commentator John Gruber concluded his reflection on &quot;the unlikely persistence of AppleScript&quot; by noting: &quot;In theory, AppleScript could be much better; in practice, though, it&#x27;s the best thing we have that works. It exemplifies the Mac&#x27;s advantages over iOS for tinkerers and advanced users.&quot;

In October 2016, longtime AppleScript product manager and automation evangelist Sal Soghoian left Apple when his position was eliminated &quot;for business reasons&quot;. Veterans in the Mac community such as John Gruber and Andy Ihnatko generally responded with concern, questioning Apple&#x27;s commitment to the developer community and pro users. Apple senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi responded in an email saying that &quot;We have every intent to continue our support for the great automation technologies in macOS!&quot;, though Jeff Gamet at &quot;The Mac Observer&quot; opined that it did little to assuage his doubt about the future of Apple automation in general and AppleScript in particular. For the time being, AppleScript remains one component of macOS automation technologies, along with Automator, Shortcuts, Services, and shell scripting.

==Intent==
AppleScript was designed to be used as an accessible end-user scripting language, offering users an intelligent mechanism to control applications, and to access and modify data and documents. AppleScript uses Apple events, a set of standardized data formats that the Macintosh operating system uses to send information to applications, roughly analogous to sending XPath queries over XML-RPC in the world of web services. Apple events allow a script to work with multiple applications simultaneously, passing data between them so that complex tasks can be accomplished without human interaction. For example, an AppleScript to create a simple web gallery might do the following:
# Open a photo in a photo-editing application (by sending that application an &quot;Open File&quot; Apple event).
# Tell the photo-editing application to manipulate the image (e.g. reduce its resolution, add a border, add a photo credit)
# Tell the photo-editing application to save the changed image in a file in some different folder (by sending that application a &quot;Save&quot; and/or &quot;Close&quot; Apple event).
# Send the new file path (via another Apple event) to a text editor or web editor application.
# Tell that editor application to write a link for the photo into an HTML file.
# Repeat the above steps for an entire folder of images (hundreds or even thousands of photos).
# Upload the HTML file and folder of revised photos to a website, by sending Apple events to a graphical FTP client, by using built-in AppleScript commands, or by sending Apple events to Unix FTP utilities.
For the user, hundreds or thousands of steps in multiple applications have been reduced to the single act of running the script, and the task is accomplished in much less time and with no possibility of random human error. A large complex script could be developed to run only once, while other scripts are used again and again.

An application&#x27;s scriptable elements are visible in the application&#x27;s Scripting Dictionary (distributed as part of the application), which can be viewed in any script editor. Elements are generally grouped into &quot;suites,&quot; according to loose functional relationships between them. There are two basic kinds of elements present in any suite: classes and commands.
* &quot;Classes&quot; are scriptable objects—for example, a text editing application will almost certainly have classes for windows, documents, and texts—and these classes will have properties that can be changed (window size, document background color, text font size, etc.), and may contain other classes (a window will contain one or more documents, a document will contain text, a text object will contain paragraphs and words and characters).
* &quot;Commands&quot;, by contrast, are instructions that can be given to scriptable objects. The general format for a block of AppleScript is to &quot;tell&quot; a scriptable object to run a command.

All scriptable applications share a few basic commands and objects, usually called the Standard Suite—commands to open, close or save a file, to print something, to quit, to set data to variables—as well as a basic &quot;application&quot; object that gives the scriptable properties of the application itself. Many applications have numerous suites capable of performing any task the application itself can perform. In exceptional cases, applications may support plugins which include their own scripting dictionaries.

AppleScript was designed with the ability to build scripts intuitively by recording user actions. Such AppleScript recordability has to be engineered into the app—the app must support Apple events and AppleScript recording; as Finder supports AppleScript recording, it can be useful for reference. When AppleScript Editor (Script Editor) is open and the Record button clicked, user actions for recordable apps are converted to their equivalent AppleScript commands and output to the Script Editor window. The resulting script can be saved and re-run to duplicate the original actions, or modified to be more generally useful.

=== Natural language metaphor ===
Whereas Apple events are a way to send messages into applications, AppleScript is a particular language designed to send Apple events. In keeping with the objective of ease-of-use for beginners, the AppleScript language is designed on the natural language metaphor, just as the graphical user interface is designed on the desktop metaphor. A well-written AppleScript should be clear enough to be read and understood by anyone, and easily edited. The language is based largely on HyperCard&#x27;s HyperTalk language, extended to refer not only to the HyperCard world of cards and stacks, but also theoretically to any document. To this end, the AppleScript team introduced the AppleEvent Object Model (AEOM), which specifies the objects any particular application &quot;knows&quot;.

The heart of the AppleScript language is the use of terms that act as nouns and verbs that can be combined. For example, rather than a different verb to print a page, document or range of pages (such as printPage, printDocument, printRange), AppleScript uses a single &quot;print&quot; verb which can be combined with an object, such as a page, a document or a range of pages.
print page 1

print document 2

print pages 1 thru 5 of document 2
Generally, AEOM defines a number of objects—like &quot;document&quot; or &quot;paragraph&quot;—and corresponding actions—like &quot;cut&quot; and &quot;close&quot;. The system also defines ways to refer to properties of objects, so one can refer to the &quot;third paragraph of the document &#x27;Good Day&#x27;&quot;, or the &quot;color of the last word of the front window&quot;. AEOM uses an application &quot;dictionary&quot; to associate the Apple events with human-readable terms, allowing the translation back and forth between human-readable AppleScript and bytecode Apple events. To discover what elements of a program are scriptable, dictionaries for supported applications may be viewed. (In the Xcode and Script Editor applications, this is under &quot;File → Open Dictionary&quot;.)

To designate which application is meant to be the target of such a message, AppleScript uses a &quot;tell&quot; construct:
tell application &quot;Microsoft Word&quot;
 quit
end tell
Alternatively, the tell may be expressed in one line by using an infinitive:
tell application &quot;Microsoft Word&quot; to quit
For events in the &quot;Core Suite&quot; (activate, open, reopen, close, print, and quit), the application may be supplied as the direct object to transitive commands:
quit application &quot;Microsoft Word&quot;
The concept of an object hierarchy can be expressed using nested blocks:
tell application &quot;QuarkXPress&quot;
 tell document 1
 tell page 2
 tell text box 1
 set word 5 to &quot;Apple&quot;
 end tell
 end tell
 end tell
end tell
The concept of an object hierarchy can also be expressed using either nested prepositional phrases or a series of possessives:
pixel 7 of row 3 of TIFF image &quot;my bitmap&quot;
TIFF image &quot;my bitmap&quot;&#x27;s 3rd row&#x27;s 7th pixel
which in another programming language might be expressed as sequential method calls, like in this pseudocode:
getTIFF(&quot;my bitmap&quot;).getRow(3).getPixel(7);
AppleScript includes syntax for ordinal counting, &quot;the first paragraph&quot;, as well as cardinal, &quot;paragraph one&quot;. Likewise, the numbers themselves can be referred to as text or numerically, &quot;five&quot;, &quot;fifth&quot; and &quot;5&quot; are all supported; they are synonyms in AppleScript. Also, the word &quot;the&quot; can legally be used anywhere in the script in order to enhance readability: it has no effect on the functionality of the script.

==Examples==

===Hello, world!===

A &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program can be written as a single line. To show a modal window with &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; buttons:
display dialog &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
To show a modal window with an &quot;OK&quot; button and an alert icon:
display alert &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
To output audio using a synthesized voice:
say &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
===Failsafe calculator===
tell application &quot;Finder&quot;
 -- Set variables
 set the1 to text returned of (display dialog &quot;1st&quot; default answer &quot;Number here&quot; buttons {&quot;Continue&quot;} default button 1)
 set the2 to text returned of (display dialog &quot;2nd&quot; default answer &quot;Number here&quot; buttons {&quot;Continue&quot;} default button 1)
 try
 set the1 to the1 as integer
 set the2 to the2 as integer
 on error
 display dialog &quot;You may only input numbers into a calculator.&quot; with title &quot;ERROR&quot; buttons {&quot;OK&quot;} default button 1
 return
 end try
 -- Add?
 if the button returned of (display dialog &quot;Add?&quot; buttons {&quot;No&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;} default button 2) is &quot;Yes&quot; then
 set ans to (the1 + the2)
 display dialog ans with title &quot;Answer&quot; buttons {&quot;OK&quot;} default button 1
 say ans
 -- Subtract? 
 else if the button returned of (display dialog &quot;Subtract?&quot; buttons {&quot;No&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;} default button 2) is &quot;Yes&quot; then
 set ans to (the1 - the2)
 display dialog ans with title &quot;Answer&quot; buttons {&quot;OK&quot;} default button 1
 say ans
 -- Multiply? 
 else if the button returned of (display dialog &quot;Multiply?&quot; buttons {&quot;No&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;} default button 2) is &quot;Yes&quot; then
 set ans to (the1 * the2)
 display dialog ans with title &quot;Answer&quot; buttons {&quot;OK&quot;} default button 1
 say ans
 -- Divide? 
 else if the button returned of (display dialog &quot;Divide?&quot; buttons {&quot;No&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;} default button 2) is &quot;Yes&quot; then
 set ans to (the1 / the2)
 display dialog ans with title &quot;Answer&quot; buttons {&quot;OK&quot;} default button 1
 say ans
 else
 delay 1
 say &quot;You haven&#x27;t selected a function. The operation has cancelled.&quot;
 end if
end tell
===Drive login===

This script controls the Finder application to login with username &quot;John&quot; and password &quot;app123&quot;:
tell application &quot;Finder&quot;
 set passAns to &quot;app123&quot;
 set userAns to &quot;John&quot;
 if the text returned of (display dialog &quot;Username&quot; default answer &quot;&quot;) is userAns then
 display dialog &quot;Correct&quot; buttons {&quot;Continue&quot;} default button 1
 if the text returned of (display dialog &quot;Username : John&quot; &amp; return &amp; &quot;Password&quot; default answer &quot;&quot; buttons {&quot;Continue&quot;} default button 1 with hidden answer) is passAns then
 display dialog &quot;Access granted&quot; buttons {&quot;OK&quot;} default button 1
 else
 display dialog &quot;Incorrect password&quot; buttons {&quot;OK&quot;} default button 1
 end if
 else
 display dialog &quot;Incorrect username&quot; buttons {&quot;OK&quot;} default button 1
 end if
end tell
== Development tools ==

===Script editors===
The development tools below provide a programing environment for scripting with AppleScript supporting composing, validating, compiling, running and debugging scripts. Some also provide for listing AppleScript dictionaries, saving scripts in a number of formats, syntax highlighting and inserting code snippets.

; AppleScript Editor: An editor from Apple packaged with macOS, called &quot;AppleScript Editor&quot; in Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) through OS X Mavericks (10.9) and &quot;Script Editor&quot; in all earlier and later versions of macOS. Scripts are written in document editing windows where they can be compiled and run, and these windows contain various panes in which logged information, execution results, and other information is available for debugging purposes. Access to scripting dictionaries and prewritten code snippets is available through the application menus. Since OS X Yosemite (10.10), Script Editor includes the ability to write in both AppleScript and JavaScript.

; Xcode: A suite of tools from Apple for developing applications with features for editing scripts and creating standalone applications written in AppleScript.

;Script Debugger: An commercial IDE from Late Night Software, Script Debugger is a relatively advanced AppleScript environment that allows the script writer to debug AppleScripts via single stepping, breakpoints, stepping in and out of functions/subroutines, variable tracking, etc. Script Debugger also contains an advanced dictionary browser that allows the user to see the dictionary in action in real world situations. That is, rather than just a listing of what the dictionary covers, one can open a document in Pages, for example, and see how the dictionary&#x27;s terms apply to that document, making it easier to determine which parts of the dictionary to use. Script Debugger is not designed to create scripts with a GUI, other than basic alerts and dialogs, but is focused more on the coding and debugging of scripts.

;Smile and SmileLab: A third-party freeware/commercial IDE for AppleScript, itself written entirely in AppleScript. Smile is free, and primarily designed for AppleScript development. SmileLab is commercial software with extensive additions for numerical analysis, graphing, machine automation and web production. Smile and SmileLab use an assortment of different windows—AppleScript windows for running and saving full scripts, AppleScript terminals for testing code line-by-line, unicode windows for working with text and XML. Users can create complex interfaces—called dialogs—for situations where the built-in dialogs in AppleScript are insufficient.

;ASObjC Explorer 4: A discontinued commercial IDE from Shane Stanley for AppleScript, especially for AppleScriptObjC. The main feature is Cocoa-object/event logging, debugging and code-completion. Users can read Cocoa events and objects like other scriptable applications. This tool was originally built for AppleScript Libraries (available in OS X Mavericks). AppleScript Libraries aims for re-usable AppleScript components and supports built-in AppleScript dictionary (sdef). ASObjC Explorer 4 can be an external Xcode script editor, too.

;FaceSpan: A discontinued commercial IDE from Late Night Software for creating AppleScript applications with graphic user interfaces.

===Script launchers===
For development and ad hoc scenarios, a script can be run from a script editor, but to support automation a script must run without opening another application. There are a number of options for doing so:

;Applets: AppleScripts can be saved from a script editor as applications (called &quot;applets&quot;, or &quot;droplets&quot; when they accept input via drag and drop). Applets can be run from the Dock, from the toolbar of Finder windows, from Spotlight, from third-party application launchers, or from any other place where applications can be run.

;Folder actions: Using AppleScript folder actions, scripts can be launched when specific changes occur in folders (such as adding or removing files). Folder actions can be assigned by clicking on a folder and choosing &quot;Folder Actions Setup...&quot; from the contextual menu; the location of this command differs slightly in Mac OS X 10.6.x from earlier versions. This same action can be achieved with third-party utilities such as Hazel.

;Hotkey launchers: Keyboard shortcuts can be assigned to AppleScripts in the script menu using the &quot;Keyboard &amp; Mouse Settings&quot; Preference Pane in System Preferences. In addition, various third-party utilities are available—Alfred, FastScripts, Keyboard Maestro, QuicKeys, Quicksilver, TextExpander—which can run AppleScripts on demand using key combinations.

;Script menu: This system-wide menu provides access to AppleScripts from the macOS menu bar, visible no matter what application is running. (In addition, many Apple applications, some third-party applications, and some add-ons provide their own script menus. These may be activated in different ways, but all function in essentially the same manner.) Selecting a script in the script menu launches it. Since Mac OS X 10.6.x, the system-wide script menu can be enabled from the preferences of Script Editor; in prior versions of Mac OS X, it could be enabled from the AppleScript Utility application. When first enabled, the script menu displays a default library of fairly generic, functional AppleScripts, which can also be opened in Script Editor and used as examples for learning AppleScript. Scripts can be organized so that they only appear in the menu when particular applications are in the foreground.

;Unix command line and launchd: AppleScripts can be run from the Unix command line, or from launchd for scheduled tasks, by using the osascript command line tool. The osascript tool can run compiled scripts (.scpt files) and plain text files (.applescript files—these are compiled by the tool at runtime). Script applications can be run using the Unix open command.

==Resources==

===AppleScript Libraries===
Re-usable AppleScript modules (available since OS X Mavericks), written in AppleScript or AppleScriptObjC and saved as script files or bundles in certain locations, that can be called from other scripts. When saved as a bundle, a library can include an AppleScript dictionary (sdef) file, thus functioning like a scripting addition but written in AppleScript or AppleScriptObjC.

===AppleScript Studio=== 
A framework for attaching Cocoa interfaces to AppleScript applications, part of the Xcode package in Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5, now deprecated in favor of AppleScriptObjC.

===AppleScriptObjC===
A Cocoa development software framework, also called AppleScript/Objective-C or ASOC, part of the Xcode package since Mac OS X Snow Leopard. AppleScriptObjC allows AppleScripts to use Cocoa classes and methods directly. The following table shows the availability of AppleScriptObjC in various versions of macOS:
AppleScriptObjC can be used in all subsequent Mac OS X versions.

===Automator===

A graphical, modular editing environment in which &quot;workflows&quot; are built up from &quot;actions&quot;. It is intended to duplicate many of the functions of AppleScript without the necessity for programming knowledge. Automator has an action specifically designed to contain and run AppleScripts, for tasks that are too complex for Automator&#x27;s simplified framework.

===Scriptable core system applications===
These background-only applications, packaged with macOS, are used to allow AppleScript to access features that would not normally be scriptable. As of Mac OS X 10.6.3 they include the scriptable applications for:
:* VoiceOver (scriptable auditory and braille screen reader package)
:* System Events (control of non-scriptable applications and access to certain system functions and basic file operations)
:* Printer Setup Utility (scriptable utility for handling print jobs)
:* Image Events (core image manipulation)
:* HelpViewer (scriptable utility for showing help displays)
:* Database Events (minimal SQLite3 database interface)
:* AppleScript Utility (for scripting a few AppleScript related preferences)

===Scripting Additions (OSAX)===
Plug-ins for AppleScript developed by Apple or third parties. They are designed to extend the built-in command set, expanding AppleScript&#x27;s features and making it somewhat less dependent on functionality provided by applications. macOS includes a collection of scripting additions referred to as Standard Additions (&quot;StandardAdditions.osax&quot;) that adds a set of commands and classes that are not part of AppleScript&#x27;s core features, including user interaction dialogs, reading and writing files, file system commands, date functions, and text and mathematical operations; without this OSAX, AppleScript would have no capacity to perform many basic actions not directly provided by an application.

==Language==

===Typing===
Variables are not strictly typed, and do not need to be declared. Variables can take any data type (including scripts and functions). For example:
-- create an integer variable called variable1
set variable1 to 1

-- create a text variable called variable2
set variable2 to &quot;Hello&quot; 

-- create a list variable called variable3
copy {17, &quot;doubleday&quot;} to variable3 

-- copy the list items of variable3 into separate variables variable4 and variable5
set {variable4, variable5} to variable3 

-- set a variable to an instance of a script
set variable6 to script myScript
===Scoping===

A subroutines cannot be called directly from an application tell block. Use of codice_2 or codice_3 is required.
tell application &quot;Finder&quot;
 set x to my myHandler()
 -- or
 set x to myHandler() of me
end tell

on myHandler()
 --commands
end myHandler

Using the same technique for scripting addition commands can reduce errors and improve performance.

tell application &quot;Finder&quot;
 set anyNumber to my (random number from 5 to 50)
end tell
===Types and objects===
A script can define custom data types, or use one of the many built-in classes and objects which are provided by the language and tend to be recognized by scriptable applications. Notable built-in types and objects include:
; Basic objects
* application: used mostly as a specifier for tell statements (codice_4)
* script: script objects are containers for scripts; every AppleScript creates a script object when run, and script objects may be created within AppleScripts
* class: meta-object that specifies the type of other objects
* reference: object that encapsulates an unevaluated object specifier that may or may not point to a valid object; can be evaluated on-demand by accessing its codice_5 property
; Standard data objects
* constant: constant value; language-defined constants include codice_6, codice_7 and codice_8
* boolean: Boolean (true/false) value; subclass of codice_9
* number: abstract superclass of codice_10 and codice_11; rarely used directly
* integer: integer; can be manipulated with built-in mathematical operators
* real: floating-point (real) number; can be manipulated with built-in mathematical operators
* date: date and time
* text: before AppleScript 2.0 (Mac OS X 10.4 and below) the codice_12 class was distinct from codice_13 and codice_14, and the three behaved somewhat differently; in 2.0 (10.5) and later, they are all synonyms and all text is handled as UTF-16
; Containers
* list: ordered list of objects; can contain any class, including other lists and classes defined by applications
* record: keyed list of objects; like a list, except structured as key–value pairs; runtime keyed access is unsupported; all keys must be compile-time constant identifiers
; File system
* alias: reference to an existing file system object (file or folder); maintains link to file system object if moved or renamed
* file: reference to a file system object; can can refer to an object that does not exist
* POSIX file: reference to a file system object, in plain text, using Unix (POSIX)-style slash (/) notation; not a true data type, as AppleScript automatically converts a POSIX file to an ordinary file
; Miscellaneous
* RGB color: specifies an RGB triplet (in 16-bit high color format), for use in commands and objects that work with colors
* unit types: converts between standard units; for instance, a value can be defined as codice_15, then converted to codice_16 by casting between unit types using the codice_17 operator

===Block===

AppleScript supports compound statement code structure via either single or multiple line syntax. The multiple line syntax ends a code block with a phrase that like codice_18 where &quot;keyword&quot; is the statement keyword at the start of the block. For example:
-- Simple form
tell application &quot;Safari&quot; to activate

-- Compound
tell application &quot;MyApp&quot;
 -- commands for app
end tell
===Script===

A script object is full object encapsulating methods and data and inheriting data and behavior from a parent script. Script objects can use the same &#x27;tell&#x27; constructs that are used for application objects and can be loaded from and saved to files. Runtime performance can be enhanced in some cases by using script objects. A script object is defined as:

script scriptName
 -- commands and handlers specific to the script
end script
===Loop===

The loop construct has multiple variations; all using the keyword repeat. The loop can be exited via exit repeat.

; Unconditional
repeat
 -- commands to be repeated
end repeat

; Repeat a number of times
repeat 10 times
 -- commands to be repeated
end repeat

; Conditional
For repeat while, the block is executed as long as a condition evaluates to true. The repeat until loop is the same except that the block is executed as long as the condition evaluates to false.
set x to 5
repeat while x &gt; 0
 set x to x - 1
end repeat

set x to 5
repeat until x ≤ 0
 set x to x - 1
end repeat
; With a variable
A variable is initialized to a value and after each execution of the block, the variable is incremented by the step value; 1 if not specified.

-- repeat the block 2000 times, i gets all values from 1 to 2000
repeat with i from 1 to 2000
 -- commands to be repeated
end repeat

-- repeat the block 4 times, i gets values 100, 75, 50 and 25
repeat with i from 100 to 25 by -25
 -- commands to be repeated 
end repeat
; Enumerate
A variable has the value of each list item as the loop progresses.
set total to 0
repeat with loopVariable in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
 set total to total + loopVariable
end repeat
===Handler===

A handler, a variation of the block structure defines a subroutine.

;Function handler

on myFunction(parameters...)
 -- subroutine commands 
end myFunction
;Folder actions block

on adding folder items to thisFolder after receiving theseItems
 -- commands to apply to the folder or items 
end adding folder items to
;Run handler

on run
 -- commands
end run
Handlers can also be defined using &quot;to&quot; in place of &quot;on&quot; and can be written to accept labeled parameters, not enclosed in parens.

;Handler with labeled parameters
on rock around the clock
 display dialog (clock as string)
end rock
-- called with:
rock around the current date
;Handler using &quot;to&quot; and labeled parameters

to check for yourNumber from bottom thru top
 if bottom ≤ yourNumber and yourNumber ≤ top then
 display dialog &quot;Congratulations! You scored.&quot;
 end if
end check
--called with:
check for 8 from 7 thru 10
There are four types of predefined handlers in AppleScript—run, open, idle, and quit—each of which is created in the same way as the run handler shown above.
;Run handler: Defines the main code of the script, which is called when the script is run. Run handler blocks are optional, unless arguments are being passed to the script. If an explicit run handler block is omitted, then all code that is not contained inside handler blocks is executed as though it were in an implicit run handler.
;Open handler: Defined using &quot;on open theItems&quot;.
on open theItems
 repeat with thisItem in theItems
 tell application &quot;Finder&quot; to update thisItem
 end repeat 
end open

When a script containing an &quot;open handler&#x27; is saved as an applet, the applet becomes a droplet. A droplet can be identified in the Finder by its icon, which includes an arrow, indicating items can be dropped onto the icon. The droplet&#x27;s open handler is executed when files or folders are dropped onto droplet&#x27;s icon. References to the items dropped on the droplet&#x27;s icon are passed to the droplet&#x27;s script as the parameter of the open handler. A droplet can also be launched the same way as an ordinary applet, executing its run handler.
;Idle handler: A subroutine that is run periodically by the system when the application is idle.

on idle
 --code to execute when the script&#x27;s execution has completed
 return 60 -- number of seconds to pause before executing idle handler again
end idle

An idle handler can be used in applets or droplets saved as stay-open applets, and is useful for scripts that watch for particular data or events. The length of the idle time is 30 seconds by default, but can be changed by including a &#x27;return x&#x27; statement at the end of the subroutine, where x is the number of seconds the system should wait before running the handler again.
;Quit handler: A handler that is run when the applet receives a Quit request. This can be used to save data or do other ending tasks before quitting.
on quit
 --commands to execute before the script quits
 continue quit -- required for the script to actually quit
end quit

===Comment===

A comment can be formatted various ways. A line comment begins with codice_19 or alternatively in later versions (AppleScript 2.0, first released in Mac OS X Leopard) with . The latter permits an AppleScript script to run as an executable if it begins with a shebang line codice_20. For example:

--This is a line comment
# So is this! (in later versions)
A block comment (can be multiple lines) is delimited by codice_21 and codice_22. For example: 
(* This is a
multiple
line
comment *)
===User interaction===

AppleScript has several user interface options, including dialogs, alerts, and list of choices. (The character, produced by typing in the Script Editor, denotes continuation of a single statement across multiple lines.)
-- Dialog
set dialogReply to display dialog &quot;Dialog Text&quot;
 default answer &quot;Text Answer&quot;
 hidden answer false
 buttons {&quot;Skip&quot;, &quot;Okay&quot;, &quot;Cancel&quot;}
 default button &quot;Okay&quot;
 cancel button &quot;Skip&quot;
 with title &quot;Dialog Window Title&quot;
 with icon note
 giving up after 15

-- Choose from list
set chosenListItem to choose from list {&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;3&quot;}
 with title &quot;List Title&quot;
 with prompt &quot;Prompt Text&quot;
 default items &quot;B&quot;
 OK button name &quot;Looks Good!&quot;
 cancel button name &quot;Nope, try again&quot;
 multiple selections allowed false
 with empty selection allowed

-- Alert
set resultAlertReply to display alert &quot;Alert Text&quot;
 as warning
 buttons {&quot;Skip&quot;, &quot;Okay&quot;, &quot;Cancel&quot;}
 default button 2
 cancel button 1
 giving up after 2
Each user interaction method can return the values of buttons clicked, items chosen or text entered for further processing. For example:
display alert &quot;Hello, world!&quot; buttons {&quot;Rudely decline&quot;, &quot;Happily accept&quot;}
set theAnswer to button returned of the result
if theAnswer is &quot;Happily accept&quot; then
 beep 5
else
 say &quot;Piffle!&quot;
end if
== Open Scripting Architecture ==
Apple provides the Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) for other scripting languages and third-party scripting/automation products (such as QuicKeys and UserLand Frontier) to function on an equal status with AppleScript. AppleScript is implemented as a component of Component Manager, and the basic specs for interfacing such components to the OSA are public, allowing other developers to add their own scripting components to the system. Public client APIs for loading, saving and compiling scripts work the same for all such components, which means that applets and droplets can hold scripts in any of those scripting languages.

One feature of the OSA is scripting additions, or OSAX for &quot;Open Scripting Architecture eXtension&quot;, which were inspired by HyperCard&#x27;s External Commands. Scripting additions are libraries that allow programmers to extend the function of AppleScript. Commands included as scripting additions are available system-wide, and are not dependent on an application (see also ). The AppleScript Editor is also able to directly edit and run some of the OSA languages.

===JavaScript for Automation===
Under OS X Yosemite and later versions of macOS, the JavaScript for Automation (JXA) component remains the only serious OSA language alternative to AppleScript, though the Macintosh versions of Perl, Python, Ruby, and Tcl all support native means of working with Apple events without being OSA components.

JXA also provides an Objective-C (and C language) foreign language interface. Being an environment based on WebKit&#x27;s JavaScriptCore engine, the JavaScript feature set is in sync with the system Safari browser engine. JXA provides a JavaScript module system and it is also possible to use CommonJS modules via browserify.

<text>The Château de Chaumont (), officially Château de Chaumont-sur-Loire, is a castle (&quot;château&quot;) in Chaumont-sur-Loire, Centre-Val de Loire, France. The castle was founded in the 10th century by Odo I, Count of Blois. After Pierre d&#x27;Amboise rebelled against Louis XI, the king ordered the castle&#x27;s destruction. Later in the 15th century Château de Chaumont was rebuilt by Charles I d&#x27;Amboise. Protected as a &quot;monument historique&quot; since 1840, the château was given into state ownership in 1938 and is now open to the public.

==History==
The name &quot;Chaumont&quot; derives from the French &quot;chauve mont&quot;, meaning &quot;bald hill&quot;. The first castle on this site, situated between Blois and Amboise, was built by Odo I, Count of Blois, in the 10th century, with the purpose of protecting his lands from attacks by his feudal rival, Fulk Nerra, Count of Anjou. On his behalf the Norman Gelduin received it, improved it and held it as his own. His great-niece Denise de Fougère, having married Sulpice d&#x27;Amboise, passed the château into the Amboise family for five centuries.

Pierre d&#x27;Amboise unsuccessfully rebelled against King Louis XI and his property was confiscated, and the castle was dismantled on royal order in 1465. It was later rebuilt by Charles I d&#x27;Amboise from 1465 to 1475 and then finished by his son, Charles II d&#x27;Amboise de Chaumont from 1498 to 1510, with help from his uncle, Cardinal Georges d&#x27;Amboise; some Renaissance features were to be seen in buildings that retained their overall medieval appearance.

The château was acquired by Catherine de Medici in 1550. There she entertained numerous astrologers, among them Nostradamus. When her husband, Henry II, died in 1559 she forced his mistress, Diane de Poitiers, to accept the Château de Chaumont in exchange for the Château de Chenonceau which Henry had given to de Poitiers. Diane de Poitiers only lived at Chaumont for a short while.
In 1594, at the death of Diane&#x27;s granddaughter Charlotte de la Marck, the château passed to her husband, Henri de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon, who sold it to a tax farmer Largentier, who had grown rich on gathering in the salt tax called the &quot;gabelle&quot;. Largentier eventually being arrested for peculation, the château and the title of &quot;sieur de Chaumont&quot; passed into a family originating at Lucca, who possessed it until 1667, when it passed by family connections to the seigneurs de Ruffignac.

Paul de Beauvilliers, duc de Beauvilliers and later duc de Saint-Aignan, bought the château in 1699, modernized some of its interiors and decorated it with sufficient grandeur to house the duc d&#x27;Anjou on his way to become king of Spain in 1700. His eventual heir was forced to sell Chaumont to pay his debts to a &quot;maître des requêtes ordinaire&quot; to Louis XV, Monsieur Bertin, who demolished the north wing built by Charles II d&#x27;Amboise and the Cardinal d&#x27;Amboise, to open the house towards the river view in the modern fashion.

In 1750, Jacques-Donatien Le Ray purchased the castle as a country home where he established a glassmaking and pottery factory. He was considered by the French as a &quot;Father of the American Revolution&quot; because he loved America. However, in 1789, the new French Revolutionary government seized Le Ray&#x27;s assets, including his beloved Château de Chaumont.
Madame de Staël acquired the château in 1810. The Comte d&#x27;Aramon bought the neglected château in 1833, undertook extensive renovations under the architect Jules Potier de la Morandière of Blois, who was later inspector of the works at the château de Blois; M. d&#x27;Aramon installed a museum of medieval arts in the &quot;Tour de Catherine de Médicis&quot;. By 1851 the &quot;Chaumont suite&quot; of the early-16th century Late Gothic tapestries with subjects of country life emblematic of the triumph of Eternity, closely associated with Chaumont and now at the Cleveland Museum of Art, was still hanging in the &quot;Chambre de Catherine de Médicis&quot;; the tapestries had been cut and pieced to fit the room.

The castle has been designated as a &quot;Monument historique&quot; since 1840 by the French Ministry of Culture. Marie-Charlotte Say, heiress to the Léon Say sugar fortune, acquired Chaumont in 1875. Later that year, she married Amédée de Broglie, who commissioned the luxurious stables in 1877 to designs by Paul-Ernest Sanson, further restored the château under Sanson&#x27;s direction and replanted the surrounding park in the English naturalistic landscape fashion. She donated Château de Chaumont to the government in 1938. The Château de Chaumont is currently a museum and every year hosts a Garden Festival from April to October where contemporary garden designers display their work in an English-style garden.

<text>The Château de Montsoreau is a Flamboyant Gothic castle in the Loire Valley, directly built in the Loire riverbed. It is located in the market town of Montsoreau, in the Maine-et-Loire &quot;département&quot; of France, close to Saumur, Chinon, Fontevraud-l&#x27;Abbaye, and Candes-Saint-Martin. The Château de Montsoreau is situated at the confluence of two rivers, the Loire and the Vienne, and the meeting point of three historical regions: Anjou, Poitou, and Touraine. It is the only château of the Loire Valley built directly in the Loire riverbed.

A Gallo-Roman origin has been verified for the settlement of Montsoreau but not confirmed for the castle, even though a fluted column made of stone from a Gallo-Roman temple or a public building was found in the moat during the restoration works of the end of the 20th century. The first written sources are from the 6th century with the domain of Restis, but it was only with the construction of a fortress at the end of the 10th century that the market town began to become prosperous. One part of this first castle was found during the same restoration works by the archaeologists. The castle was reconstructed in a Flamboyant Gothic style between 1450 and 1460 by Jean de Chambes, one of the kingdom&#x27;s wealthiest men, a senior councillor and chamberlain to King Charles VII and King Louis XI.

The Château de Montsoreau was written about by Alexandre Dumas in his novel &quot;La Dame de Monsoreau&quot; (1845–1846). This novel is the second part of a trilogy on the Renaissance between &quot;La Reine Margot&quot; and &quot;The Forty-Five Guardsmen&quot;.

Parts of the Château de Montsoreau were listed as a &quot;monument historique&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture in 1862, 1930, and 1938. The Loire Valley between Sully-sur-Loire and Chalonnes has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 30 November 2000.

In 2015, the French contemporary art collector Philippe Méaille signed with Christian Gillet, president of the French department of the Maine-et-Loire an emphyteutic lease of 25 years of the real property of the Château de Montsoreau. The Château houses Méaille&#x27;s collection of the conceptual art collective Art &amp; Language as a museum named Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art.

== Etymology ==

=== Latin ===
The name Montsoreau first appeared in 1086 on a Latin map as &quot;Castrum Monte Sorello&quot; or &quot;Mons Sorello&quot;. &quot;Mons&quot; or &quot;Monte&quot; refers to a rocky promontory. The origin and interpretation of the name &quot;Sorello&quot; remain unknown but may mean bald or red. Before the fortress was built, an administrative or cult building had already occupied the site since Gallo-Roman times.

=== Literary ===
In &quot;La Dame de Monsoreau&quot;, Alexandre Dumas alludes to the origin of the name of the castle:
== History ==
=== Middle Ages ===
The first written source describing the site under the name &quot;Restis&quot; dates back to the 6th century. It was transformed into a fortified castle by Eudes, the First count of Blois, in 990. In 1001, it was taken by the Anjou realm, and Foulques Nerra gave it to Gautier I of Montsoreau. Gautier I belonged to one of the most pre-eminent families of Anjou. Thus, the &quot;Castrum Monsorelli&quot; became one of the forty fortified castles in Anjou and one of the few to be given the title of lordship at the turn of the year 1000. A town developed quickly near the castle, and in the &quot;narratio de commendatione Turonice provincie&quot;, edited by Salmon in 1854, the site was mentioned as one of &quot;oppidis munitissimi et populosis&quot; by the second half of the 11th century Written sources from the 12th century attested to a right to raise taxes

When the order of Fontevraud was settled in 1101, Fontevraud Abbey was supervised by Gautier de Montsoreau, who took direct orders from the Count of Anjou. Gautier&#x27;s stepmother, Hersende de Champagne, was the first prior and co-founder of the Abbey with Robert d&#x27;Arbrissel.

Guillaume IV de Montsoreau was on Geoffrey Plantagenet&#x27;s side against his brother Henri II Plantagenet, the future King of England, and Eleanor of Aquitaine&#x27;s husband. The latter besieged the &quot;castrum&quot; and took it at the end of August 1152, despite its fortification. He captured Guillaume and his defenders. Guillaume IV, however, was restored to the castle later. An order of King Henry II of England (about 1068) concerning the landscape project of the Loire was signed by Guillaume de Montsoreau and his son Guillaume. In 1171, Guillaume&#x27;s son gave the Turpenay monks the right to build tax-free houses inside the &quot;castrum&quot;. Gauthier, his eldest son, had no sons and so the lordship passed to the Savary de Montbazon family, on the marriage of his daughter Ferrie in 1213 to Pierre II Savary de Montbazon, lord of Montbazon.

After his victory at Bouvines, Philippe-Auguste chose him in 1214, with Guy Turpin, archdeacon of Tours, to negotiate peace with King John. The second house of Montsoreau disappeared in 1362, with the wedding of the only daughter of Renaud VII and Guillaume II de Craon. The fourth house, one of the Chabot family, lasted only a few decades.

In 1450, to pay off debts, Louis II Chabot sold his domains of Montsoreau and Coutancière to his brother-in-law Jean II de Chambes, who undertook to rebuild the castle at Montsoreau. A descendant of Angoumois old noble family (near the city of Angoulême), Jean II de Chambes began in Charles VII service as an esquire in 1426, the years before the interview between the King and Jeanne d&#x27;Arc in the Castle of Chinon. Baker in chief, Councillor and Chamberlain, he became in 1444 &quot;first master of ostel&quot; of the King; at the same time he associated with Jacques Coeur. Jean II de Chambes received a considerable amount of money that was owed to him. He performed diplomatic missions as an ambassador to Venice in 1459 to prepare a new crusade. His lordships of Montsoreau and Argenton, but also his governorship of La Rochelle and Lord Provost and Captain of Niort, Talmont-sur-Gironde and Aigues-Mortes assured him revenues.

=== Modern times ===

From 1450 to 1460, played a role as ambassador, and was called out of Anjou, while the castle was being built. His political and financial influence rose during these years including his closeness to Charles VII. Closer to Charles VII than Louis XI, Jean II de Chambes gradually withdrew from politics from 1461.

Jean III de Chambes succeeded his father, who died in 1473 and married Marie de Chateaubriant, who founded in 1519 the Holy Cross Collegiate Church across the moat surrounding the castle. In 1530, Philippe de Chambes, who lived in Montsoreau, married Anne de Laval-Montmorency. His eldest son, inherited the field of Coutancière and saw his lands made up into a barony in 1560.

Montsoreau was sacked by the Protestants in 1568. The Holy Cross Collegiate and the fortifications of the city were destroyed. Four years later, Jean VI de Chambes acquitted himself in the organisation of the &quot;Saint Bartholomew Angevine&quot; in Saumur and Angers. His Barony was confirmed by Letters Patent in 1573 and 1575.

After his death in 1575, his brother Charles de Chambes became Count of Montsoreau and the following year he married Françoise de Maridor, whose name was attached to the murder of Louis de Bussy d&#x27;Amboise.

Garrisons of seventy warriors lived in the castle in the course of the last decade of the 16th century. This ceased to exist during the reign of Louis XIII, and René de Chambes sought a garrison of royal troops but was refused by Richelieu. As a counterfeiter, he was sentenced to death and had to flee to England and was never able to return. After the death of his successor Bernard de Chambes, the castle of Montsoreau was rarely occupied by its various owners. The eldest daughter of Bernard de Chambes married Louis Francis Bouchet, who died in 1716, leaving 400,000 &quot;livres&quot; of debts. His eldest son Louis I de Bouchet, married Jeanne Pocholle Hamel who brought a 200,000 &quot;livres&quot; dowry.

=== Contemporary period ===
The widow of Louis Francois II de Bouchet Sourches, Marquis of Tourzel, sold the château and what remained of the domain of Montsoreau after 1804. Following the sale of the property, the building was occupied by 19 different homeowners who reshaped the site. The external condition of the main building is known through various representations and descriptions made in the second half of the nineteenth century, which reflect the disrepair of the property. By 1910, the château had deteriorated and this moved the members of the French Archaeological Society (). Senator Geoffre asked the Maine et Loire department General Council to intervene. The department gradually acquired each property after 1913, Restoration works were undertaken in 1923 and continued until the Second World War.

After a new programme of restoration between 1997 and 2001, the château opened to visitors on 6 July 2001 with a &quot;son-et-lumiere&quot; entitled &quot;The Imaginaries of Loire&quot; which attracted about 35,000 visitors a year.

In June 2015, the Maine and Loire council leased the Château to Philippe Méaille, to create the Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art which opened to the public in April 2016. Its collection holds artworks by the Art &amp; Language group, and organizes temporary shows, conferences and symposia.

== Geography: the site and its natural environment ==
=== Situation ===
The Château de Montsoreau is located at the convergence of two rivers, the Loire and the Vienne, and the intersection of three historical political regions Anjou, Poitou and Touraine. It is situated in a nationally protected region, the Loire-Anjou-Touraine Regional Nature Park.

The castle was built into the bed of the Loire River, at the foot of the hillside, in tufa – the local bedrock, still visible in many places. Many local properties are built from this stone and there are many local houses built into the hillsides, and in the local caves. Its topographic position is said to be militarily impregnable, as it is located between two small valleys on a plateau of some thirty hectares with steep slopes to the east and the west.

== Architecture ==
=== Description ===
Jean II de Chambes built the Château de Montsoreau in 1455. The building marks the transition from military architecture to architecture for pleasure, as shown by the large windows, the numerous chimneys, and the attention paid to sanitation problems. The castle&#x27;s central dwelling was built directly on the banks of the Loire. Unusually, two right-angled wings, looking like two square towers framing the main building, were built a few years later, at a time when round towers were usually built. This odd choice prefigures the corner pavilions of classical architecture. A spiral staircase probably existed before the current Renaissance staircase.

The ground floor and courtyard side cellars permit control of navigation on the Loire. One of those rooms has direct access to the river. The main staircase on the left side leads to the ground floor dwelling and to the first floor salon. This very bright room, lit by five windows and with a length of seventeen metres, is heated by two monumental chimneys.

Small rooms surround the dwelling and show the transition between public and private areas. In 1473, Jean III de Chambes succeeded his father. He built a Renaissance staircase tower with a polygonal shaft topped by a terrace. The steps lead to an eight-wedged palmtree-shaped vault, quite similar to those found in Angers’ Barrault dwelling and Saumur’s town hall. The stairs are decorated by pilasters bordering the windows; medallions, putti and candelabra carried by lion&#x27;s paws.

A central panel shows a helmet bearing the family&#x27;s motto &quot;&quot;Chambe Crie&quot;. The register above represents two monkeys holding the end of a chain. This chain is fixed around a loop belt under which is inscribed &quot;Je le feray&quot;&quot;. At the other extreme of the chain, an ovoid object embellished by a leaf decoration is suspended through a hoop. A little monkey is crouching down the hoop&#x27;s left side. The upper panel is carved with trees and branches representing a coppice in front of which stand a deer, the chief symbol of the hunt.

== The Château de Montsoreau in the Arts ==
=== Visual arts ===
==== Joseph Mallord William Turner ====
In October 1826, William Turner spent a short stay on the banks of the Loire and took twenty-one views of the river. He painted the château de Montsoreau and surrounding scenery. This watercolour conserved at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford was engraved in 1832; one copy is kept at the Château de Montsoreau – Museum of Contemporary Art.
==== Auguste Rodin ====
Auguste Rodin had the pavilion of the Exposition Universelle (to which he added a portico recovered from the Château d&#x27;Issy) reinstalled on the heights of Meudon in 1895. Two years later, around 1897, fascinated by the architecture of the château Montsoreau, he drew an idealized view of its north facade.

==== Paul-Désiré Trouillebert ====
Paul-Désiré Trouillebert, a painter of the school of Barbizon, worked in Paris and Candes-Saint-Martin. He painted several Loire landscapes in which the château de Montsoreau appears.

=== Popular culture ===
In 2019, the English magazine &quot;All About History&quot; (Future plc) publishes its &quot;101 World&#x27;s Greatest castles&quot; list and ranked the château de Montsoreau with the number 53.

<text>Þökk (also Thökk) (Old Norse / Icelandic &quot;Thanks&quot;) is a jötunn in Norse mythology, presumed to be Loki in disguise, who refuses to weep for the slain Baldr, thus forcing Baldr to stay in Hel.

==&quot;Prose Edda&quot;==
After Baldr was killed, Hermóðr rode to Hel. Hel, the ruler of the realm of the same name, agreed that Baldr should go back to the living if all things in the world wept for him. So the Æsir sent messengers all over the world, and all wept for him, but:

:&quot;Then, when the messengers went home, having well wrought their errand, they found, in a certain cave, where a giantess sat: she called herself Thǫkk. They prayed her to weep Baldr out of Hel; she answered:
::Thǫkk will weep
::waterless tears
::For Baldr&#x27;s bale-fare;
::Living or dead,
::I loved not the churl&#x27;s son;
::Let Hel hold to that she hath!
:And men deem that she who was there was Loki Laufeyarson, who hath wrought most ill among the Æsir.&quot;
::::—&quot;Gylfaginning&quot; , Brodeur&#x27;s translation

<doc id="88401" wikidata="Q125133" url="?curid=88401" title="Víctor Jara">
<text>Víctor Lidio Jara Martínez (; 28 September 1932 – 16 September 1973) was a Chilean teacher, theater director, poet, singer-songwriter and Communist political activist. He developed Chilean theater by directing a broad array of works, ranging from locally produced plays to world classics, as well as the experimental work of playwrights such as Ann Jellicoe. He also played a pivotal role among neo-folkloric musicians who established the &quot;Nueva canción chilena&quot; (New Chilean Song) movement. This led to an uprising of new sounds in popular music during the administration of President Salvador Allende.

Jara was arrested by the Chilean military shortly after the 11 September 1973 coup led by Augusto Pinochet, which overthrew Allende. He was tortured during interrogations and ultimately shot dead, and his body was thrown out on the street of a shantytown in Santiago. The contrast between the themes of his songs—which focused on love, peace, and social justice—and his murder transformed Jara into a &quot;potent symbol of struggle for human rights and justice&quot; for those killed during the Pinochet regime. His prominent role as an admirer and propagandist for Che Guevara and Allende&#x27;s government, in which he served as a cultural ambassador through the late 1960s and until 1973, made him a target.

In June 2016, a Florida jury found former Chilean Army officer Pedro Barrientos liable for Jara&#x27;s murder. In July 2018, eight retired Chilean military officers were sentenced to 15 years and a day in prison for Jara&#x27;s murder. Barrientos, who had his U.S. citizenship revoked in July 2023, was arrested in Deltona, Florida, in October 2023. Barrientos would be successfully deported back to Chile on 1 December 2023, and was immediately taken into PDI custody.

==Early life==

Víctor Lidio Jara Martinez was born on 28 September 1932. His parents were tenant farmers who lived near the town of La Quiriquina, located twelve kilometers from Chillán Viejo; he had five brothers. His exact place of birth is uncertain, but he was born in the Ñuble Region. At the age of five, his family moved to Lonquén, a town near Santiago de Chile, where his father, Manuel Jara, had rented a small parcel of land. His father was illiterate and did not want his children going to school, so that they could help him in the fields instead. His mother, on the other hand, knew how to read a little and from the beginning she insisted that they at least learn the alphabet.

Jara&#x27;s mother was a mestiza with Mapuche ancestry from southern Chile, who had taught herself to play the guitar and piano. She also performed as a singer, with a repertory of traditional folk songs that she used for local events like weddings and funerals. The relationship between his parents became more tense with each passing day, his father began to drink and disappeared from the house several days in a row, leaving all the work in the hands of Amanda. Later, his mother moved to Santiago and took a job as a cook in a restaurant in Vega Poniente. Because she was so skilled she did well there and so she was able to educate three of her children, including Victor. 

She died when Jara was 15. Jara began to study accounting, but soon moved into a seminary, where he studied for the priesthood. After a couple of years, however, he became disillusioned with the Catholic Church and left. Subsequently, he spent several years in the Chilean Army before returning to his hometown to pursue interests in folk music and theatre.

==Musical career==
After joining the choir at the University of Chile in Santiago, Jara was convinced by a fellow chorus member to pursue a career in theater. He subsequently joined the university&#x27;s theater program and, through his talent, earned a scholarship. He appeared in several of the university&#x27;s plays, gravitating toward those with social themes, such as Russian playwright Maxim Gorky&#x27;s &quot;The Lower Depths&quot;.

In 1957, he met Violeta Parra, a singer who had steered folk music in Chile toward modern song composition rooted in traditional forms, and who had established musical community centers called &quot;peñas&quot; to incorporate folk music into everyday life. Jara absorbed these lessons and began singing with a group called Cuncumén, with whom he continued his explorations of Chile&#x27;s traditional music. He worked as a guitarist and vocalist from 1957 to 1963. He was deeply influenced by the folk music of Chile and other Latin American countries, and by artists such as Parra, Atahualpa Yupanqui, and the poet Pablo Neruda. In the 1960s, Jara started specializing in folk music and sang at Santiago&#x27;s La Peña de Los Parra, owned by Ángel Parra. Through these activities, he became involved in the Nueva canción movement of Latin American folk music.

In 1966, Víctor released his self-titled first album; it was the only album released by the Demon label and was Víctor Jara&#x27;s first solo work. The album would later be re-released under the titles &quot;Canto a lo humano&quot; and &quot;Sus mejores canciones&quot;, and in 2001 an reissue on CD by Warner Music Chile was released with the original title. This version on CD also included five bonus tracks, four of which are songs by Víctor Jara along with Cuncumén.

The album includes Jara&#x27;s versions of some Latin American folk songs, such as &quot;La flor que anda de mano en mano&quot;, and &quot;Ojitos verdes&quot;; as well as two Chilean folk songs, &quot;La cocinerita&quot;, an Argentinian folk song, or &quot;Ja jai&quot;, a Bolivian traditional. The authorship of this album, as well as its singles, was in the hands of Camilo Fernández, owner of the Demon label from its launch in 1966 until 2001, when he transferred the rights to the widow of Víctor Jara.

In 1967, released their second album homonymous, this album apart from the controversial song &quot;The appeared&quot; includes Jara&#x27;s covers of folk songs from Latin America and Spain. The album was later released under the name of &quot;Desde Lonquén hasta siempre&quot;. In 1968, Jara released his first collaborative album entitled, &quot;Canciones folklóricas de América&quot; (Folkloric Songs of America), with Quilapayún. In 1970, Jara left theater to devote himself to music.

==Political activism==
Early in his recording career, Jara showed a knack for antagonizing conservative Chileans, releasing a traditional comic song called &quot;La beata&quot; that depicted a religious woman with a crush on the priest to whom she goes for confession. The song was banned on radio stations and removed from record shops, but the controversy only added to Jara&#x27;s reputation among young and progressive Chileans. More serious in the eyes of the Chilean right wing was Jara&#x27;s growing identification with the socialist movement led by Salvador Allende. After visits to Cuba and the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, Jara joined the Communist Party. The personal met the political in his songs about the poverty he had experienced firsthand.
Jara&#x27;s songs spread outside Chile and were performed by American folk artists. His popularity was due not only to his songwriting skills but also to his exceptional power as a performer. He took a turn toward political confrontation with his 1969 song &quot;Preguntas por Puerto Montt&quot; (&quot;Questions About Puerto Montt&quot;), whose subject was Edmundo Pérez Zujovic, a government official who had ordered police to attack squatters in the town of Puerto Montt. The Chilean political situation deteriorated after the official was assassinated, and right-wing thugs beat up Jara on one occasion.

In 1970, Jara supported Allende, the Popular Unity coalition candidate for president, volunteering for political work and playing free concerts. He composed &quot;Venceremos&quot; (&quot;We Will Triumph&quot;), the theme song of Allende&#x27;s Popular Unity movement, and welcomed Allende&#x27;s election to the Chilean presidency in 1970. After the election, Jara continued to speak in support of Allende and played an important role in the new administration&#x27;s efforts to reorient Chilean culture.

He and his wife, Joan Jara, were key participants in organizing cultural events that supported the Chile&#x27;s new socialist government. He set poems by Pablo Neruda to music and performed at a ceremony honoring him after Neruda received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1972. During this time, Jara continued to teach at Chile&#x27;s Technical University. His popular success during this time, as both a musician and a Communist, earned him a concert in Moscow. He was so successful that the Soviet Union claimed in their media that his vocal prowess was the result of surgery he had undergone while in Moscow.

On 11 September 1973, the Chilean military, with the support of the United States, overthrew the Allende government, resulting in Allende&#x27;s suicide and the installation of Augusto Pinochet as dictator. On the day of the coup, Jara was on his way to work at the Technical University. He slept that night at the university along with other teachers and students and sang to raise their morale.

==Torture and murder==

After the coup, Pinochet&#x27;s soldiers rounded up Chileans who were believed to be involved with leftist groups, including Allende&#x27;s Popular Unity party. On the morning of 12 September 1973, Jara was taken prisoner, along with thousands of others, and imprisoned inside Estadio Chile. Soon after, he was killed with a gunshot to the head, and his body was riddled with more than 40 bullets. According to the BBC:

There are many conflicting accounts of Jara&#x27;s last days but the 2019 Netflix documentary &quot;&quot; pieces together a convincing narrative. As a famous musician and prominent supporter of Allende, Jara was swiftly recognised on his way into the stadium. An army officer threw a lit cigarette on the ground, made Jara crawl for it, then stamped on his wrists. Jara was first separated from the other detainees, then beaten and tortured in the bowels of the stadium. At one point, he defiantly sang &quot;Venceremos (We Will Win)&quot;, Allende&#x27;s 1970 election anthem, through split lips. On the morning of the 16th, according to a fellow detainee, Jara asked for a pen and notebook and scribbled the lyrics to &quot;Estadio Chile&quot;, which were later smuggled out of the stadium: &quot;How hard it is to sing when I must sing of horror. / Horror which I am living, horror which I am dying.&quot; Two hours later, he was shot dead, then his body was riddled with machine-gun bullets and dumped in the street. He was 40.

After his murder, Jara&#x27;s body was displayed at the entrance of Chile Stadium for other prisoners to see. It was later discarded outside the stadium along with the bodies of other prisoners who had been killed by the Chilean Army. His body was found by civil servants and brought to a morgue, where one of them was able to identify him and contact his wife, Joan. She took his body and gave him a quick and clandestine burial in the general cemetery before she fled the country into exile.

In July 2015, 42 years later, former Chilean military officers were charged with his murder. In August 2023, a Chilean court confirmed a ruling convicting seven former soldiers, who were aged between 73 and 85 at the time of their sentencing, and sentencing them to jail terms from 8 up to 25 years.

==Legal actions==
On 16 May 2008, retired colonel Mario Manríquez Bravo, who was the chief of security at Chile Stadium as the coup was carried out, was the first to be convicted in Jara&#x27;s death. Judge Juan Eduardo Fuentes, who oversaw Bravo&#x27;s conviction, then decided to close the case, a decision Jara&#x27;s family soon appealed. In June 2008, Judge Fuentes re-opened the investigation and said he would examine 40 new pieces of evidence provided by Jara&#x27;s family.

On 28 May 2009, José Adolfo Paredes Márquez, a former Army conscript arrested the previous week in San Sebastián, Chile, was formally charged with Jara&#x27;s murder. Following his arrest, on 1 June 2009, the police investigation identified the officer who had shot Jara in the head. The officer played Russian roulette with Jara by placing a single round in his revolver, spinning the cylinder, placing the muzzle against Jara&#x27;s head, and pulling the trigger. The officer repeated this a couple of times until a shot fired and Jara fell to the ground. The officer then ordered two conscripts (one of them Paredes) to finish the job by firing into Jara&#x27;s body. A judge ordered Jara&#x27;s body to be exhumed in an effort to gather more information about his death.

On 3 December 2009, Jara was reburied after a massive funeral in the Galpón Víctor Jara, across from Santiago&#x27;s Plaza Brasil.

On 28 December 2012, a judge in Chile ordered the arrest of eight former army officers for alleged involvement in Jara&#x27;s murder. He issued an international arrest warrant for one of them, Pedro Barrientos Núñez, the man accused of shooting Jara in the head during a torture session.

On 4 September 2013, Chadbourne &amp; Parke attorneys Mark D. Beckett and Christian Urrutia, with the assistance of the Center for Justice and Accountability, filed suit in a United States court against Barrientos, who at the time lived in Florida, on behalf of Jara&#x27;s widow and children. The suit accused Barrientos of arbitrary detention; cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; extrajudicial killing; and crimes against humanity under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), and of torture and extrajudicial killing under the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA). It alleged that Barrientos was liable for Jara&#x27;s death as a direct perpetrator and as a commander.

The specific claims were that:
* On 11 September 1973, troops from the Arica Regiment of the Chilean Army, specifically from La Serena, attacked the university where Jara taught. The troops prohibited civilians from entering or leaving the university premises. During the afternoon of 12 September 1973, military personnel entered the university and illegally detained hundreds of professors, students, and administrators. Víctor Jara was among those arbitrarily detained on the campus and was subsequently transferred to Chile Stadium, where he was tortured and killed. 
* In the course of transporting and processing the civilian prisoners, Captain Fernando Polanco Gallardo, a commanding officer in military intelligence, recognized Jara as the well-known folk singer whose songs addressed social inequality, and who had supported President Allende&#x27;s government. Captain Polanco separated Jara from the group and beat him severely. He then transferred Jara, along with some of the other civilians, to the stadium.
* Throughout his detention in the locker room of the stadium, Jara was in the physical custody of Lieutenant Barrientos, soldiers under his command, or other members of the Chilean Army who acted in accordance with the army&#x27;s plan to commit human rights abuses against civilians.
* The arbitrary detention, torture, and extrajudicial killing of Jara and other detainees were part of a widespread, systematic attack on civilians by the Chilean Army from 11 to 15 September 1973. Barrientos knew, or should have known, about these attacks, if for no other reason than that he was present for and participated in them.

A 2009 Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) legal petition which was published in December 2019 described Polanco as having been a &quot;Captain of Army Intelligence,&quot; and noted that he had been detained through the jurisdiction of the Criminal Justice of Santiago in May 2004 for his role in a separate murder and was convicted in 2007.

On 15 April 2015, a US judge ordered Barrientos to stand trial in Florida. On 27 June 2016, he was found liable for Jara&#x27;s killing, and the jury awarded Jara&#x27;s family $28 million.

On 3 July 2018, eight retired Chilean military officers were sentenced to 15 years in prison for Jara&#x27;s murder and the murder of his Communist associate and former Chilean prison director Littre Quiroga Carvajal. They received three extra years for kidnapping both men. A ninth suspect was sentenced to five years in prison for covering up the murders. 

In November 2018, it was reported that a Chilean court ordered the extradition of Barrientos.

On 28 August 2023, the Chilean Supreme Court ratified the previous judicial resolutions. The retired Army Brigadier, Hernán Chacón Soto, upon learning of the Supreme Court&#x27;s now final and unappealable sentence, committed suicide the next day, before he could be arrested and taken to prison.

On 5 October 2023, Barrientos was arrested in Deltona, Florida, during a traffic stop. His U.S. citizenship had been previously revoked by a U.S. Federal Court on 14 July 2023 after it was found that he willfully concealed material facts related to his military service.

On 9 November 2023, it was revealed that Barrientos was ordered to be extradited back to Chile. On 12 November 2023, Jara&#x27;s widow Joan, who was a key witness in the 2016 civil trial against Barrientos and who also played a crucial role in raising awareness to Jara&#x27;s murder, died. Barrientos was reportedly two weeks away from extradition at the time of her death. 

It was first reported that Barrientos was scheduled to be extradited on 28 November 2023. However, it was later claimed that the date for his departure from the United States was changed to 30 November 2023, with his arrival in Chile expected to be the next day on 1 December. It was also revealed that upon his arrival in Chile, Barrientos would be immediately transferred into PDI custody and will have defendant status. His planned transfer to Chile would be confirmed by the nation&#x27;s Supreme Court on 30 November. However, lawyer Almudena Bernabeudue and an ICE spokesman revealed that due to the fact that Barrientos answered to immigration proceedings and was now an undocumented illegal immigrant, his departure from the United States would count as a deportation rather than an extradition. Barrientos would be deported back to Chile on 1 December 2023. Upon his return, Barrientos left escorted by PDI personnel and was transferred to the Peñalolén Military Police Battalion, where he would remain in preventive detention as a defendant for his role in not only Jara&#x27;s murder, but also the murder of the former director of prisons Littré Quiroga.

==Cultural references==

Joan Jara lived the rest of her life in Chile running the Víctor Jara Foundation, which was established on 4 October 1994 with the goal of promoting and continuing Jara&#x27;s work. She publicized a poem that Jara wrote before his death about the conditions of the prisoners in the stadium. The poem, written on a piece of paper that was hidden inside the shoe of a friend, was never named, but it is commonly known as &quot;Estadio Chile&quot; (Chile Stadium, now known as Víctor Jara Stadium).

On 22 September 1973, the Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh found an asteroid that he initially called &quot;SO2&quot;, but later he would end up calling it &quot;2644 Victor Jara&quot;.

In the late 1990s, British actress Emma Thompson started to work on a screenplay that she planned to use as the basis for a movie about Jara. Thompson, a human rights activist and fan of Jara, saw his murder as a symbol of human rights violations in Chile, and believed a movie about his life and death would raise awareness. The movie was to feature Antonio Banderas as Jara and Thompson as his wife, Joan.

<text>Hermóðr (Old Norse: , &quot;war-spirit&quot;; anglicized as Hermod) is a figure in Norse mythology, a son of the god Odin and brother of Baldr.

==Attestations==

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
Hermóðr appears distinctly in section 49 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;. There, it is described that the gods were speechless and devastated at the death of Baldr, unable to react due to their grief. After the gods gathered their wits from the immense shock and grief of Baldr&#x27;s death, Frigg asked the Æsir who amongst them wished &quot;to gain all of her love and favor&quot; by riding the road to Hel. Whoever agreed was to offer Hel a ransom in exchange for Baldr&#x27;s return to Asgard. Hermóðr agreed to this and set off with Sleipnir to Hel.

Hermóðr rode Odin&#x27;s horse Sleipnir for nine nights through deep and dark valleys to the Gjöll bridge covered with shining gold, the bridge being guarded by the maiden Móðguðr &#x27;Battle-frenzy&#x27; or &#x27;Battle-tired&#x27;. Móðguðr told Hermóðr that Baldr had already crossed the bridge and that Hermóðr should ride downwards and northwards.

Upon coming to Hel&#x27;s gate, Hermóðr dismounted, tightened Sleipnir&#x27;s girth, mounted again, and spurred Sleipnir so that Sleipnir leapt entirely over the gate. So at last Hermóðr came to Hel&#x27;s hall and saw Baldr seated in the most honorable seat. Hermóðr begged Hel to release Baldr, citing the great weeping for Baldr among the Æsir. Thereupon Hel announced that Baldr would only be released if all things, dead and alive, wept for him.

Baldr gave Hermóðr the ring Draupnir which had been burned with him on his pyre, to take back to Odin. Nanna gave a linen robe for Frigg along with other gifts and a finger-ring for Fulla. Thereupon Hermóðr returned with his message.

Hermóðr is called &quot;son&quot; of Odin in most manuscripts, while in the Codex Regius version—normally considered the best manuscript—Hermóðr is called &quot;sveinn Óðins&quot; &#x27;Odin&#x27;s boy&#x27;, which in the context is as likely to mean &#x27;Odin&#x27;s servant&#x27;. However Hermóðr in a later passage is called Baldr&#x27;s brother and also appears as son of Odin in a list of Odin&#x27;s sons. See Sons of Odin.

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
The name Hermóðr seems to be applied to a mortal hero in the eddic poem &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot; (stanza 2):
The favour of the Highfather       we seek to find,&lt;br&gt;
To his followers gold       he gladly gives;&lt;br&gt;
To Hermóðr he gave       helm and mail-coat,&lt;br&gt;
And to Sigmund he gave       a sword as a gift.

===Skaldic poetry===
In the skaldic poem &quot;Hákonarmál&quot; (stanza 14) Hermóðr and Bragi appear in Valhalla receiving Hákon the Good. It is not certain that either Hermóðr or Bragi is intended to be a god in this poem.

===&quot;Beowulf&quot;===
In the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, Heremod is a Danish king who was driven into exile and in Old English genealogies Heremod appears appropriately as one of the descendants of Sceafa and usually as the father of Scyld.

<doc id="88406" wikidata="Q597473" url="?curid=88406" title="Edam cheese">
<text>Edam ( ) is a semi-hard cheese that originated in the Netherlands, and is named after the town of Edam in the province of North Holland. Edam is traditionally sold in flat-ended spheres with a pale yellow interior and a coat, or rind, of red paraffin wax. Edam ages and travels well and hardens, instead of spoiling, for an extended time. These qualities (among others) made it the world&#x27;s most popular cheese between the 14th and 18th centuries, both at sea and in remote colonies.

==Content==

Most &quot;young&quot; Edam cheeses sold in stores have a very mild flavour, slightly salty or nutty, and almost no smell when compared to other cheeses. As the cheese ages, its flavour sharpens, and it becomes firmer. Edam may have as little as 28% fat in dry matter. Modern Edam is softer than other cheeses, such as Cheddar cheese, because of its low fat content.

==Accompaniments==
Mild Edam goes well with fruit such as peaches, melons, apricots, and cherries. Aged Edam is often eaten with traditional &quot;cheese fruits&quot; like pears and apples. Like most cheeses, it is commonly eaten on crackers and bread, and may be eaten with crackers following the main course of a meal as a dessert of &quot;cheese and biscuits&quot;. Pinot gris, dry Riesling, semidry Riesling, sparkling wine, Chardonnay, and Shiraz/Syrah are some recommended wines to accompany this cheese.

==Regional uses==
===Spain and former colonies===
In Spain and some of its former colonies, such as the Philippines and many Latin American countries, the cheese is known as &quot;queso de bola&quot; (ball cheese) and was long considered a delicacy.

In the Mexican state of Yucatán, &quot;queso de bola&quot; is prepared as &quot;queso relleno&quot; (&quot;stuffed cheese&quot;). A ball of cheese is cut in half and carved out; it is then stuffed with a mixture of seasoned ground meat, raisins, capers, and olives. Finally, it is braised in chicken stock, and served sliced with the chicken stock that has been thickened with cornstarch and spiced tomato sauce.

===Czech Republic and Slovakia===

Edam is the most common cheese used in the Czech Republic, where it is usually sold under the name &quot;eidam&quot;. It is often used as the base of the snack &quot;smažený sýr&quot; (&quot;fried cheese&quot;), which is popular in the country and also in neighbouring Slovakia () where it may be served with a slice of ham (), and always with tartar sauce (&quot;tatarská omáčka&quot;) or mayonnaise.

===Belize===

In Belize, where it was once one of the few commercially available cheeses, it may also be known as &quot;queso de calavera,&quot; &quot;queso de colorado&quot;, or &quot;dutch cheese&quot; and usually eaten when well-aged and sharp, commonly with bread and coffee.

===Indonesia===

In Indonesia, Edam cheese is quite popular—due to historical ties with the Netherlands—and is known as &quot;keju edam&quot;. Generally, it is Edam cheese that is used for cooking &quot;kaasstengels&quot;, a snack that is served during Eid ul-Fitr, Christmas, and Chinese New Year. Other Indonesian dishes such as &quot;roti bakar&quot;, &quot;kue cubit&quot; and &quot;pannenkoek&quot; can be served with Edam cheese as a topping.

===Philippines===

In the Philippines, &quot;queso de bola&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;keso de bola&quot;) is popular during Christmas in the Philippines, when Filipinos feast with family and friends. It is customarily served with &quot;jamón&quot; and &quot;pandesal&quot; during the &quot;Noche Buena&quot;, the traditional feast taken around midnight of Christmas Eve and lasting until the early hours of Christmas Day.

===Scandinavia===
The cheese is also associated with Christmas in Sweden and Norway due to its red color, and is often found on the Christmas &quot;Julbord&quot; buffet.

==In popular culture==

Edam has been treated dramatically and humorously in a variety of cultural art forms. In the novel &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, the main character believes its red outer covering is a sign of impending death. It is a wine aroma nuance in &quot;Sideways&quot; and an object of desire in the animated film &quot;Shopper 13&quot;. Edam is a seriocomic pivot in the Australian film &quot;Three Dollars&quot;. Actor Jason Flemyng advertised Edam in the UK. Edam was tested by &quot;MythBusters&quot; in episode 128 for its putative suitability as cannon ammunition against a ship&#x27;s sail, but it bounced off the sail without damaging it.

In Season 2 episode 24 of Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Colin Mochrie playing &quot;Cheese Man&quot; claims he doesn&#x27;t &quot;give edam&quot;, a cheese pun. Drew Carey then describes it as &quot;crossword puzzle cheese&quot;. (&quot;Dutch cheese that&#x27;s &quot;made backwards&quot;&quot; is a well known clue for Edam in cryptic crosswords.)

<doc id="88411" wikidata="Q509048" url="?curid=88411" title="Holler (Spice Girls song)">
<text>&quot;Holler&quot; is a song by British girl group Spice Girls, from their third studio album, &quot;Forever&quot; (2000). It was written by the group, with additional writing by Rodney &quot;Darkchild&quot; Jerkins, LaShawn Daniels and Fred Jerkins III, with Darkchild also serving as the producer. The track was released on 23 October 2000 in the United Kingdom by Virgin Records as the lead single from &quot;Forever&quot;, as a double A-side single with &quot;Let Love Lead the Way&quot;; the group had previously premiered the song on their official website on 11 September. &quot;Holler&quot; is an R&amp;B and dance song, depicting a departure from the group&#x27;s past bubblegum pop works. Lyrically, it consists of the members singing &quot;come-ons&quot; to a male. 

&quot;Holler&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics; while some complimented the song&#x27;s production and the Spice Girls&#x27; vocals, others found it too similar to works by Destiny&#x27;s Child, Sister Sledge and TLC and thought it was too different from the group&#x27;s previous sounds. The song was a commercial success, topping the UK Singles Chart and becoming the band&#x27;s ninth number-one single in the region. This gave the Spice Girls the record for being the girl group with the most number-one singles. Internationally, it was also commercially successful, peaking inside the top ten in countries such as Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, and Spain. In the United States, it did not reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, but managed to reach number 12 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart.

The music video for &quot;Holler&quot; was directed by Jake Nava, and filmed around the same time as the video for &quot;Let Love Lead the Way&quot;. It depicted the girls playing one of the four elements each, with them also appearing together inside a glass pyramid. The song was promoted by the Spice Girls with performances on British televised shows such as &quot;SMTV Live&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, as well as on the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards in Stockholm, Sweden. &quot;Holler&quot; was performed on three of their concert tours, Christmas in Spiceworld Tour (1999), The Return of the Spice Girls Tour (2007-08) and the Spice World - 2019 Tour (2019).

==Background and release==
After finishing the Spiceworld Tour in September 1998 and releasing their single &quot;Goodbye&quot; in December, the Spice Girls went into a hiatus period, during which the members of the group focused on their personal lives. The group resumed work on their third studio album, &quot;Forever&quot;, in August 1999. They recruited American recording producers such as Rodney Jerkins and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to work on the album; the former was signed up to give the project a &quot;tougher&quot; sound. He stated that he hoped to bring an &quot;urban, danceable&quot; feel to the project, with &quot;a little harder&quot; beats, while still maintaining a pop appeal. Darkchild traveled to London to work with the group, and together they wrote three songs in five days; the producer also revealed that although he knew he had scheduled recording sessions with them 10 months beforehand, he did not write anything before meeting the girls in London. He also revealed that &quot;everybody I&#x27;ve been playing them for can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the Spice Girls&quot;.

The girls embarked on the brief Christmas in Spiceworld Tour in December 1999, where they debuted three new tracks recorded for &quot;Forever&quot;, &quot;Right Back at Ya&quot;, &quot;W.O.M.A.N.&quot; and &quot;Holler&quot;, known at the time as &quot;Holler Holler&quot;. In May 2000, member Melanie Chisholm told &quot;Heat&quot; magazine that the lead single from &quot;Forever&quot; would be a ballad titled &quot;Let Love Lead the Way&quot; and would be released in August; however, months later, a representative for the group stated that the first single had not been chosen yet. Finally, in late July, Chisholm confirmed to BBC Radio 1 that the lead single would be a double A-side of &quot;Let Love Lead the Way&quot; and &quot;Holler&quot;, with the latter being available for streaming through the band&#x27;s official website on 11 September. The girls wrote on their official website that the decision was made because they &quot;love[d] both just as much as each other and couldn&#x27;t decide which to release [first]&quot;. The single was released in the United Kingdom on 23 October 2000 as a CD and cassette single. &quot;Holler&quot; was later sent to US contemporary hit radio on 24 October 2000.

==Composition==

&quot;Holler&quot; was recorded in September 1999 at Sarm Hook End and Whitfield Street Studios in London, United Kingdom by Brad Gilderman, who also provided audio mixing for the track. It was written by the members of the group along with Rodney &quot;Darkchild&quot; Jerkins, LaShawn Daniels and Fred Jerkins III. Production was handled by Darkchild, while vocal production was done by LaShawn Daniels. Mason Jr. was in charge of the Pro Tools for the track, whereas Dave Russell and Ian Robertson served as assistants during its production. &quot;Holler&quot; was mixed at Larrabee North Studios in Los Angeles, California, by Gilderman and Darkchild, while being mastered by Bernie Grundman at Bernie Grundman Mastering, along with all other tracks present on &quot;Forever&quot;.

Musically, &quot;Holler&quot; is an R&amp;B and dance song, representing a shift from the previous bubblegum pop works from the group, transitioning into a more mature and sexier sound. Quentin Harrison from Albumism also noted a &quot;contemporaneous electronic sheen&quot; into its composition. The track also contains vocoder effects on the vocals. It starts with Darkchild&#x27;s voice announcing, &quot;Spice Girls, Darkchild, 2000&quot;; he became the first male vocalist to be featured on a Spice Girls track. During the song, the members sing &quot;come-ons&quot; to a male, with lyrics such as &quot;Let me take you into my fantasy room&quot; and &quot;I wanna make you holler, and hear you scream my name&quot;. At one point, Chisholm sings &quot;I want to make you do things you thought you&#x27;d never do&quot;. Luke Abrahams for the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; commented on the lyrical content, &quot;Geri [Halliwell] was gone, and so was all the subtlety.&quot; According to &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Chuck Taylor, &quot;each of the girls is given the chance to shine&quot; on the song. Emma Bunton commented on &quot;Holler&quot;&#x27;s production:

&quot;[I]t&#x27;s a real dance track that everyone can groove to. Then, as soon as you hear our voices and our melodies, you can tell straight away that it&#x27;s the Spice Girls, and that is what we wanted to achieve. We wanted to make it funkier, and we&#x27;re all grown up [...] But we still wanted it to have a Spice-y feel, and I think it&#x27;s definitely worked out well.&quot;
==Critical reception==

Upon its release, &quot;Holler&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. Taylor highlighted the quality and confidence of the members&#x27; vocals, as well as the &quot;bold, saucy attitude evident here that&#x27;s more convincing than in the past.&quot; He also complimented the &quot;swift, clever, kicky&quot; production. Craig Seymour of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the track a B− rating, writing that the girls &quot;sound like they really, really wanna be Destiny&#x27;s Child&quot; on the song. Seymour also praised &quot;its charms&quot;, praising the &quot;easy yet funky groove, their exaggerated British accents&quot;, as well as Darkchild&#x27;s &quot;familiar slapping, kinetic beats&quot;. He also called it &quot;their most compelling reason to dance&quot; since their single &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot; (1996). Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic simply picked the song as one of the best from &quot;Forever&quot;. According to Jackson Langford from MTV Australia, &quot;Holler&quot; was &quot;easily the biggest surprise the Spice Girls ever managed to pull off&quot;, but it &quot;feels so far apart from what fans are used to&quot;, although being &quot;at least somewhat enjoyable&quot;. Similarly, Julia Jafaar from the &quot;New Straits Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Those who have heard the hit single, Holler, from the new album, would probably attest that the music arrangement and style&quot; were atypical of the group and its previous hits.

Jenny North from &quot;Dotmusic&quot; considered the track &quot;slick, fun, as catchy as crabs and the girls are sounding sexier than ever before&quot;, predicting it would &quot;lodge itself in your head with the rest of their back catalogue&quot; after a few listens. Writing for the same website, Cyd Jaymes wrote that &quot;Holler&quot; and &quot;Let Love Lead The Way&quot; were the best songs on &quot;Forever&quot; &quot;by a country mile&quot;, but they still did not &quot;deserve to be singles&quot;. Whitney Matheson of &quot;USA Today&quot; called it similar to the works of Sister Sledge, Destiny&#x27;s Child and Nu Shooz songs, writing that, &quot;while the No Scrubs-y vibe briefly tempted me to shout a dirty word and bare my navel, styrofoam phrases such as &#x27;Don&#x27;t be afraid to play my game&#x27; are more Teletubby than T-Boz.&quot; Arion Berger of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; compared the track to &quot;catching your little sister making out with some guy at the mall&quot;. In a review for the album, the &quot;Lincoln Journal Star&quot; staff considered that &quot;attempts at uptempo, funky sounds&quot; such as &quot;Holler&quot; &quot;fall flat almost instantly&quot;.

Retrospective reviews for the single have also been mixed. Will Stroude of &quot;Attitude&quot; considered the track &quot;funky, attitude-filled&quot;, but acknowledged that retrospective reviews of the song &quot;haven’t always been kind, but they make the mistake of defining the era based on the cultural craze that had come before, rather than taking it on its own terms&quot;, but asserted that &quot;connoisseurs know that ‘Holler’ still slaps almost two decades later.&quot; While reviewing their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, Nick Levine of &quot;Digital Spy&quot; stated that &quot;Jerkins&#x27; slick, stuttering R&amp;B numbers&quot; from &quot;Forever&quot;, which included &quot;Holler&quot;, failed to capitalise on the group&#x27;s &quot;very British sense of mischief&quot;. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Alexis Petridis, Jerkins was a &quot;great signing&quot; as producer, although his &quot;more avant tendencies&quot; were &quot;hemmed in by the necessity of making Spice Girls records with direct pop appeal&quot;; hence, he described &quot;Holler&quot; as &quot;serviceable, rather than thrilling&quot;. Dom Passantino of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; rated the single 3/10, saying the song is his &quot;personal pick for the worst production job in musical history, ol&#x27; Darkchild took the most unique, epoch-defining, cultural maelstrom of a group he could find, and turned them into a facsimile of Fanmail-era TLC.&quot; Tom Ewing of e-zine &quot;Freaky Trigger&quot; said the song &quot;shifts and shuffles in a competent, modish way&quot;, but criticized the group and the producer for &quot;not trying to change any games&quot;. He also described the intro as sounding dated: &quot;Like &#x27;Holler&#x27; needed to sound any more 2000.&quot;

==Chart performance==

On 24 October 2000, early sales figures reported that &quot;Holler&quot;/&quot;Let Love Lead the Way&quot; was set to debut at number one on the UK Singles Chart, selling 31,000 copies during the first day on sale. On 29 October 2000, the song debuted at the top of the charts, selling 106,000 copies on its first week. With this feat, the Spice Girls became the first female group to have nine number-one singles, sharing the same amount with ABBA. They were placed only behind The Beatles, Elvis Presley, Cliff Richard and Madonna overall. The song also became Chisholm&#x27;s 11th number-one single as a songwriter in the region, making her the female artist with more number ones than any other in chart history at the time. She remains the only female performer to top the charts as a solo artist, as part of a duo, quartet and quintet. The single stayed at number one for one week, remaining inside the chart for 21 weeks, and was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) only four days after it was released, on 27 October 2000. As of May 2019, it has sold 287,000 copies in the United Kingdom, becoming their 10th biggest selling single in the region.

Around the world, &quot;Holler&quot;/&quot;Let Love Lead the Way&quot; was also successful. In Europe, it reached number two on the Eurochart Hot 100; and reached number one in Scotland; peaked inside the top ten in countries such as Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, and Spain; and inside the top twenty in Belgium&#x27;s Walloon region, Germany and the Netherlands. In Oceania, the release entered at its peak of number two on Australia&#x27;s ARIA Charts, staying there for another week, becoming their highest charting-single in the country since &quot;Viva Forever&quot; (1998). It remained on the chart for 15 weeks, and was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). In New Zealand, &quot;Holler&quot;/&quot;Let Love Lead the Way&quot; debuted at number 47 on the charts, remaining for another week at the position. The following weeks, it rose to its peak of number two, becoming the band&#x27;s 10th consecutive top-10 single, and was certified gold by Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ).

&quot;Holler&quot; was released separately from &quot;Let Love Lead the Way&quot; in Canada. It debuted at number two on the chart compiled by Nielsen Soundscan, only behind the Backstreet Boys&#x27; &quot;Shape of My Heart&quot;, whereas &quot;Let Love Lead the Way&quot; peaked at number five the same week. On the &quot;RPM&quot; magazine&#x27;s chart, the song managed to reach number 12, until publication was ceased in November 2000. In the United States, the track peaked at number 12 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, an extension of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. &quot;Holler&quot; additionally reached numbers 31 and 40 on the Dance Club Songs and Rhythmic charts, compiled by &quot;Billboard&quot;.

==Music video==

The music video for &quot;Holler&quot; was filmed at the Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, England, during July of 2000, and was directed by Jake Nava. It was filmed around the same time as the music video for &quot;Let Love Lead the Way&quot;. Before its release, Chisholm revealed that the girls would play one of the four elements each – water, air, fire and earth – in both videos: &quot;We liked the theme coz&#x27; we’re all so different and we all come together and make the Spice Girls and the elements come together to make the earth.&quot; For her part, Brown described the visual as &quot;very, very futuristic and it&#x27;s very funky. We had a great time doing it.&quot; The clip first premiered through the Spice Girls&#x27; official website on 11 September 2000, before airing on television for the first time through MuchMusic the following day.

The video begins zooming into a seemingly glass pyramid where the four girls are dancing on a square platform in a circle. Melanie Brown represents fire as she sits in a dark room with fire rolling along the floor. Chisholm is seen levitating above cracked mud inside a room with wooden walls as the floor blooms into plant life, representing earth. Bunton wears a short blue dress with a white coat, while dancing in a blue room under water with reflections bouncing off the walls. Finally, Victoria Beckham, who embodies the element of air, is seen inside a wind tunnel playing with shiny prisms as they are blown by. All the girls are then seen together in the pyramid watching their respective male dancers – who are seen in each of their solo shots – dancing on the square platform. At the end of the video, the group embrace in a hug.

&quot;Rockol&quot; website commented that &quot;the four put aside striped trousers and improbable outfits with preposterous colors to focus, also in this case, on black and above all on sexy winks and at least naughty necklines.&quot; According to Mark Elliott from Yahoo! Music, it &quot;suggests much of what might have proved a fascinating new musical direction if the band hadn’t taken a lengthy break after the album’s release.&quot; Niellah Arboine of &quot;Bustle&quot; noted that &quot;it all feels a bit more grown. Mel B’s gone blonde, Emma’s not in pink, and can we take a moment to appreciate Victoria Beckham with long hair in a white jumpsuit and sunglasses getting &quot;Matrix&quot;-style blown around in a wind tunnel?&quot;. John Dingwall from the &quot;Daily Record&quot; compared the video to works by Robbie Williams and Kylie Minogue, as the group &quot;squeezed into leather and looking mean and moody&quot;. The clip received the &quot;Worst Video&quot; prize at the 2000 Smash Hits Poll Winners Party. It was ripped off in the music video for Nawal El Zoghbi&#x27;s song &quot;Elli Tmaneito&quot; (2002), which was called &quot;a total copycat&quot; of &quot;Holler&quot;.

==Live performances==

The group first performed &quot;Holler&quot; on their Christmas in Spiceworld tour in December 1999, as one of the songs to be included on their then-upcoming third studio album. The song was later performed at the 2000 Brit Awards and was excluded from the TV broadcast due to technical problems arising during the performance but the song was heard on the live radio broadcast. During the ceremony, the Spice Girls received an award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In order to promote &quot;Forever&quot;, the group performed it on British televised shows such as &quot;SMTV Live&quot;, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;&quot;. They also performed the track at the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards on 16 November 2000 in Stockholm, Sweden; before the performance, Chisholm declared that it could be their last appearance together before going on a hiatus to focus on their solo careers. For the number, the group wore leather outfits, ending with them going through the floor with large orange pyrotechnic flames blazing up.

The Spice Girls performed the song on their first reunion tour, The Return of the Spice Girls Tour in 2007 and 2008. They were dressed in dominatrix leather outfits, and had their dancers on leashes, on their knees. Jon Pareles from &quot;The New York Times&quot; considered the performance the &quot;raciest stage moment&quot; of the show, while according to &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Alison Bonaguro, the number &quot;took things too far with the Spice Girls dressed in black leather and the dancers in collars and leashes.&quot; Though Halliwell had returned to the group at this point, she did not take part in the performance. For their second reunion tour, the Spice World - 2019 Tour, &quot;Holler&quot; was performed with elements of &quot;Sound Off&quot;; it also marked the first time Halliwell performed the song live with the group. Holly Williams from &quot;The Independent&quot; reacted negatively to the number, saying it reminds &quot;why they stopped making music&quot;. She also called a &quot;real misstep&quot; when &quot;over a marching band (very budget Beyoncé) they revive their old chant &#x27;we know how we got this far/strength and courage in a Wonderbra&#x27;. As a vision of feminism, this maybe – maybe – passed muster in the Nineties, but sounds woefully out of step in 2019&quot;.

<text>In Norse mythology, Hœnir (also Hǿnir; modern Icelandic , modern Swedish ) is one of the Æsir. He is mentioned in Vǫluspá as one of the three gods (along with Odin and Lóðurr) that created the first humans.

==Attestations== 
In &quot;Völuspá&quot;, at the creation of the first human beings, Ask and Embla, Hœnir and Lóðurr help Odin. According to the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Hœnir is said to have given reason to man.

In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Vili and Vé are mentioned instead. As Snorri Sturluson knew &quot;Völuspá&quot;, it is possible that Hœnir was another name for Vili. Also according to &quot;Völuspá&quot;, Hœnir was one of the few gods that would survive Ragnarök. In &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, along with Mímir, he went to the Vanir as a hostage to seal a truce after the Æsir-Vanir War. Upon arrival in Vanaheim, Hœnir, described here as large, handsome, and thought of by the vanir well-suited to be a chief, was immediately made chief. There, Hœnir was indecisive and relied on Mímir for all of his decisions, grunting noncommital answers when Mímir was absent.

Hœnir also has a minor role in &quot;Haustlöng&quot; and &quot;Reginsmál&quot;.

In the medieval Faroese ballad Lokka táttur, Hœnir protects a farmer&#x27;s boy through summoning seven swans.

==Theories==
According to Viktor Rydberg and other scholars, such as Gudbrand Vigfusson, the epithets &quot;langifótr&quot; &#x27;Long-legs&#x27; and &quot;aurkonungr&quot; &#x27;mud-king&#x27;, together with the Greek cognate &#x27;swan&#x27; and Sanskrit (&quot;śakuna&quot;) &#x27;bird of omen&#x27;, suggest that Hœnir was connected with the stork. This seems to be supported by Hœnir&#x27;s connection with the European folkloric legend of the stork delivering babies to their parents, and his role in the medieval folktale &quot;Loka Táttur&quot;, which further confirms his association with birds.

<doc id="88417" wikidata="Q3280441" url="?curid=88417" title="Tostada (tortilla)">
<text>Tostadas ( or ; , ) are various dishes in Mexican and Guatemalan cuisine based on toasted tortillas.

They are generally a flat or bowl-shaped tortilla that is deep-fried or toasted, but may also be any dish using a &quot;tostada&quot; as a base. They can be consumed alone, or used as a base for other foods. Corn tortillas are usually used for tostadas, although tostadas made of wheat or other ingredients are also found.

== Preparation ==


Just as stale bread can be made palatable as toast, a stale tortilla can be repurposed as a tostada by frying it in boiling oil until it becomes golden, rigid, and crunchy. Commercial tostadas are similar in taste and consistency to tortilla chips.

Tostadas are a standalone dish in Mexico and the American Southwest, and are also served as a companion to various Mexican foods, mostly seafood and stews, such as menudo, birria and pozole. Tostadas can be found across Mexico.

Toppings for tostadas are mostly the same as those used for tacos: a base layer of beans, cheese, sour cream, chopped lettuce, sliced onions, and salsa, which is then topped with diced and fried meat, usually chicken or pork, and also beef. They are also popular with seafood such as tuna, shrimp, crab, chopped octopus, and ceviche. Vegetarian tostadas, while not as common, can also be found. Due to the fragile nature of a tostada, the main topping (usually beans or cream) must be pasty enough to stay on; this keeps the other toppings or garnishes from falling off while being eaten. The Oaxaca region is known for its large &quot;tlayuda&quot; tostada, which is the size of a pizza and sometimes topped with fried chapulines (a variety of grasshopper).

Tostadas can be an appetizer (&quot;botana&quot;), cut into small triangles to make tortilla chips to dip into salsa, guacamole, beans, cream, cream cheese or served with chile con queso. This version of the tostada has its origins both in the &quot;totopos de maiz&quot; and the New Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine. Commercial tortilla chips, sometimes known as &quot;nachos&quot;, are also commonly sold in stores and supermarkets.

In Guatemala, tostadas are often prepared with black beans, parsley, ground beef, and curtido.

<doc id="88426" wikidata="Q1419737" url="?curid=88426" title="Guildhall School of Music and Drama">
<text>The Guildhall School of Music and Drama is a music and drama school located in the City of London, England. Established in 1880, the school offers undergraduate and postgraduate training in all aspects of classical music and jazz along with drama and production arts. The school has students from over seventy countries. It was ranked first in both the Guardian&#x27;s 2022 League Table for Music and the Complete University Guide&#x27;s 2023 Arts, Drama and Music league table. It is also ranked the fifth university in the world for performing arts in the 2024 QS World University Rankings.

Based within the Barbican Centre in the City of London, the school currently numbers just over 1,000 students, approximately 800 of whom are music students and 200 on the drama and technical theatre programmes. The school is a member of Conservatoires UK, the European Association of Conservatoires and the Federation of Drama Schools. It also has formed a creative alliance with its neighbours, the Barbican Centre and the London Symphony Orchestra. Notable alumni of the school include Sir Bryn Terfel, Sir James Galway, Michaela Coel, Daniel Craig and Sir George Martin.

==History==

===1880–1977===
The Guildhall School of Music first opened its doors on 27 September 1880, housed in a disused warehouse in the City of London. With 64 part-time students, it was the first municipal music college in Great Britain. The school quickly outgrew its first home, however, and in 1887 it moved to new premises in John Carpenter Street in a complex of educational buildings built by the Corporation of London to house it and the city&#x27;s two state schools.

The new building was completed by 9 December 1886 and the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Reginald Hanson, attended the opening ceremony. Teaching continued under the first principal of the school, Thomas Henry Weist Hill, who eventually had some ninety teaching staff.
The new site, designed by the architect Sir Horace Jones, comprised a common room for professors and 45 studios, each surrounded by a one-foot thick layer of concrete to &quot;deaden the sound&quot;. Each room contained both a grand piano and an upright piano. Additionally, there was an organ room and a &quot;practice&quot; room, in reality a small concert hall which was used for orchestral and choir rehearsals. The practice room was also the venue for the fortnightly school concerts

Initially, all tuition was on a part-time basis, but full-time courses were introduced to meet demand in 1920. Departments of speech, voice, and acting were added, and by 1935 the school had added &quot;and Drama&quot; to its title.

===1977–2005===
The school moved to its present premises in the heart of the City of London&#x27;s Barbican Centre in 1977 and continues to be owned, funded and administered by the City of London.

In 1993, the Corporation of London leased a nearby courtyard of buildings that in the 18th century had been the centre of Samuel Whitbread&#x27;s first brewery, and renovated and converted this to provide the school with its hall of residence, Sundial Court. About three minutes&#x27; walk from the school, Sundial Court offers self-catering single-room accommodation for 178 students.

In 2001, the Secretary of State, Baroness Blackstone, announced that the Barbican Centre, including the Guildhall School, was to be Grade II listed.

===2005–present===
In 2005, the school was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize for its development and outreach programme, Guildhall Connect, and, in 2007, it won a further Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize in recognition of the work of the opera programme over the last two decades. The school was rated No. 1 specialist institution in the UK in the Guardian University Guide 2013 and 2014.

The most significant investment in the Guildhall School&#x27;s future came to fruition via the £90 million redevelopment of the neighbouring Milton Court site. The new building, which opened in 2013, houses three new performance spaces: a concert hall (608 seats), a theatre (223 seats) and a studio theatre (up to 128 seats) in addition to drama teaching and administration spaces.

The school offers both undergraduate and graduate degree programs as well as the Junior Guildhall, a Saturday school serving students from 4 to 18 years of age.
The school was awarded a further Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize in 2007 in recognition of the achievements and work of the Opera Programme.

In August 2014, the Guildhall had a logo change to a more minimalist modern style. It was changed due to the school thinking that it needed to reflect its types of teachings.

==Programmes==
The Guildhall School was awarded taught-degree awarding powers in 2014 by the Privy Council. Doctoral degrees are validated by City, University of London.

===Music===
The Guildhall offers a four-year undergraduate program for musicians along with the Guildhall Artist Masters in performance or composition and the highly advanced Artist Diploma programme. Students can specialise in classical or jazz performance (either as an instrumentalist or vocalist), composition, historical performance and electronic music. At master&#x27;s level, vocal students are able to specialise in Opera Studies. In addition to this, the school offers postgraduate degrees in opera writing (in association with The Royal Opera) and in music therapy.

===Drama===
The Guildhall School offers a three-year BA Honours in Acting and the MA in Acting preparing students for the world of professional theatre. The School also delivers the BA Honours in Acting Studies in partnership with the Central Academy of Drama in Beijing. A full time, four-year programme with two years of training at each institution, the BA Honours in Acting Studies takes in a cohort of students every other year, exploring cross-cultural approaches to acting.

===Production Arts===
The School also offers a three-year vocational degree in production arts where students can specialise in either Stage Management, Costume, Theatre Technology or Design Realisation. The school is one of a handful to offer specialist training in stage automation, with computer controlled flying installations in three of the venues provided by TAIT, based upon their eChameleon platform.

===Youth Learning===
Guildhall School offers a Saturday school for advanced young musicians under the age of 18. In addition to this, the school became the UK&#x27;s largest provider of music education to under 18s by incorporating the Centre for Young Musicians (CYM) and creating new music &quot;hubs&quot; in Norfolk and Somerset; the school achieved recognition for Guildhall&#x27;s music outreach and opera programmes through two Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prizes (2005 and 2007).

==Admission==
Admission to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama is by a highly competitive audition. The School holds auditions for their music programmes in London, New York, Hong Kong, Seoul, Taipei and Tokyo and from 2021 drama auditions will be held in cities across the UK (including London, Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Leeds and Nottingham) along with international auditions in New York.

For the Production Arts course, admission is through interview at the school&#x27;s Milton Court building in London, or at the United States Institute of Theatre Technology conference held each year, where prospective students meet and take part in various activities which simulate the teaching offered on the course.

In the year 2018/19, the Acting course had 2,610 applications and awarded offers to only 1% of the applicants, giving it one of the lowest acceptance rates for any U.K. higher education institution. Unlike other UK conservatoires, Guildhall operates a separate applications procedure and applications are made directly to the school, as opposed to through UCAS Conservatoires.

==Facilities==

The Milton Court Concert Hall is a 608-seat professional concert venue, with the largest audience capacity of any of the London conservatoires. The school works in association with the Barbican Centre to stage public performances from world-renowned ensembles, such as the Academy of Ancient Music and Britten Sinfonia within Milton Court. In addition to Guildhall&#x27;s flagship concert hall, the Milton Court building also contains a 223-seat proscenium arch theatre, a flexible 128-seat studio theatre and several rehearsal rooms. The school&#x27;s Grade II listed Silk Street building houses a 308-seat drama and opera theatre, along with a second smaller concert hall, a recital room, theatrical workshops and labs, electronic music studios, recording and sound studios, and over 40 teaching and practice rooms. The school also owns the John Hosier Annexe, a nearby building with a further 44 teaching and practice rooms. The Guildhall School library (located within the Silk Street building) houses one of the most extensive specialised collections of music and drama print in Europe. The Guildhall Symphony Orchestra and Chorus perform regularly in the neighbouring 1,943-seat Barbican Hall, whilst chamber musicians give recitals there as part of the acclaimed LSO Platforms: Guildhall Artists series.

<text>In Norse mythology, Vígríðr or Óskópnir is a large field foretold to host a battle between the forces of the gods and the forces of Surtr as part of the events of Ragnarök. The field is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material, and in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century. The &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; briefly mentions the field as where the two forces will battle, whereas the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; features a fuller account, foretelling that it is the location of the future death of several deities (and their enemies) before the world is engulfed in flames and reborn.

==Etymology==
The Old Norse place name &quot;Vígríðr&quot; means &quot;battle-surge&quot; or &quot;place on which battle surges&quot;. The name &quot;Vígríðr&quot; is sometimes modernly anglicized as Vigrid, Vigrith, or Wigrid. The etymology of the name &quot;Óskópnir&quot; is a matter of scholarly debate, but has been proposed as meaning &quot;the (not yet) created&quot;, &quot;not made&quot; or &quot;mismade&quot;.

==Attestations==

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, the god Odin, disguised as &quot;Gagnráðr&quot; faces off with the wise jötunn Vafþrúðnir in a battle of wits. Among numerous other questions, Vafþrúðnir asks Odin to tell him what the name of the plain is where the gods and Surtr will meet. Odin responds that the name of the plain is Vígríðr, and that the size of the field is 100 leagues in every direction:


In his translation notes for these stanzas, Henry Adams Bellows notes that &quot;a hundred miles&quot; is a &quot;general phrase for a vast distance&quot;.

In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Fáfnismál&quot;, the dying wyrm Fáfnir is asked by the hero Sigurd what the name of the island is where Surtr and the gods will battle is called. Fáfnir replies that the island is called &quot;Óskópnir&quot;.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===

In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, the enthroned figure of High foretells the events of Ragnarök. High says the Muspell&#x27;s forces will gather at the field Vígríðr, a field which he adds is &quot;a hundred leagues in each direction&quot;. Then the monstrous wolf Fenrir and the immense serpent Jörmungandr will arrive. By that time, the jötunn Hrym with all of the frost-jötnar and Loki with &quot;all Hel&#x27;s people&quot; will have also arrived.

As these forces gather, the god Heimdallr will stand and blow into his horn, Gjallarhorn, which will awaken the gods. The gods will meet and hold a thing. Odin will ride to the well Mímisbrunnr and will consult Mímir on behalf of himself and his people. Yggdrasil, the cosmological tree, will shiver and all beings will be fearful. The gods and the einherjar will don their war gear and advance to Vígríðr. Odin, wearing a golden helmet, a coat of mail, and brandishing his spear Gungnir, will ride in the front.

Odin will make directly for Fenrir and the god Thor, by Odin&#x27;s side, will be unable to help him because he will be fighting Jörmungandr. The god Freyr will engage the fiery being Surtr and, since Freyr lacks the sword he gave his servant Skírnir, Freyr will fall after a rough struggle. The god Tyr will fight the hound Garmr and the two will kill one another. Thor will kill the serpent Jörmungandr but after nine steps will collapse to the ground, dead from Jörmungandr&#x27;s venom. Fenrir will eat Odin, but immediately after Odin&#x27;s son Víðarr will come forward and set his foot on to the wolf&#x27;s lower jaw, and grasp its upper jaw, ripping its mouth apart, killing it. Loki and Heimdallr will kill one another and, after their death, Surtr will spray fire over the earth and burn the entire world.

Later in the same chapter, High quotes Odin&#x27;s response from the above-mentioned chapter of &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;.

<text>Chilaquiles () are a traditional Mexican breakfast dish made with tortillas.

== Ingredients and variations ==
Typically, left over tortillas are the basis of the dish. Green or red salsa is poured over the crisp tortilla triangles. The mixture is simmered until the tortilla starts softening. Pulled chicken is sometimes added to the mix. It is commonly garnished with crema, crumbled &quot;queso fresco&quot;, sliced onion, and avocado slices. Chilaquiles can be served with refried beans, eggs (scrambled or fried) and guacamole as side dishes.

As with many Mexican dishes, regional and family variations are quite common. Usually, chilaquiles are eaten at breakfast or brunch. This makes them a popular recipe to use leftover tortillas and salsas.

== Etymology ==

== Regional variations ==
In central Mexico, it is common for the tortilla chips to remain crisp. To achieve this, all ingredients except the salsa are placed on a plate and the salsa is poured at the last moment before serving. In Guadalajara, &quot;cazuelas&quot; are kept simmering, filled with chilaquiles that become thick in texture, similar to &quot;polenta&quot;. In the state of Sinaloa, chilaquiles are sometimes prepared with cream. In the state of Tamaulipas, on the northeast side of the country, red tomato sauce is commonly used. In the state of San Luis Potosí, it is also common to serve chilaquiles with cecina rather than pulled chicken.

== History in the United States ==
Encarnación Pinedo published &quot;El cocinero español&quot; (&quot;The Spanish Cook&quot;) in 1898 in California and included recipes for &quot;chilaquiles tapatíos a la mexicana&quot;, &quot;chilaquiles a la mexicana&quot;, and &quot;chilaquiles con camarones secos&quot; (chilaquiles with dry shrimp).

<text>In Norse mythology, Naglfar or Naglfari (Old Norse &quot;nail farer&quot;) is a boat made entirely from the fingernails and toenails of the dead. During the events of Ragnarök, &quot;Naglfar&quot; is foretold to sail to Vígríðr, ferrying hordes of monsters that will do battle with the gods. &quot;Naglfar&quot; is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, also composed in the 13th century. The boat itself has been connected by scholars with a larger pattern of ritual hair and nail disposal among Indo-Europeans, stemming from Proto-Indo-European custom, and it may be depicted on the Tullstorp Runestone in Scania, Sweden.

==Etymology==
Some dispute has waged over the etymology of &quot;Naglfar&quot;. In the late 19th century, Adolf Noreen proposed that &quot;nagl-&quot; here does not have its usual meaning of &quot;nail&quot;, but, instead, is a variant of Old Norse &quot;nár&quot; (meaning &quot;corpse&quot;) and ultimately derives from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;nok-w-i&quot;. Noreen claimed that the notion of &quot;Naglfar&quot; as a &#x27;nail-ship&#x27; is due to a folk etymology; that elaboration on the folk etymology produced the concept of a &quot;nail-ship&quot;.

However, Sigmund Feist (1909) rejects the theory on etymological grounds, as does Albert Morley Sturtevant (1951) on the grounds of major difficulties, and their points have led Bruce Lincoln (1977) to comment that &quot;there is no reason whatever to contend that &quot;nagl-&quot; does not have its usual meaning of &#x27;nail&#x27; and that &quot;Naglfar&quot; is anything other than the nail-ship, just as Snorri describes it.&quot; In addition, Lincoln finds the ship to be a part of a larger pattern of religious disposal and sacrifice of hair and nails among the Indo-Europeans (see below).

==Attestations==
Naglfar is attested in both the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, &quot;Naglfar&quot; is solely mentioned in two stanzas found in the poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;. In the poem, a deceased völva foretells that the ship will arrive with rising waters, carrying Hrym and Loki and with them a horde of others:
In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, &quot;Naglfar&quot; is mentioned four times. The ship is first mentioned in chapter 43 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, where the enthroned figure of High notes that while Skíðblaðnir is the best ship—constructed with the finest skill—&quot;the biggest ship is &quot;Naglfari&quot;, it belongs to Muspell&quot;.

In chapter 51, High foretells the events of Ragnarök. Regarding &quot;Naglfar&quot;, High says that after the stars disappear from the sky, the landscape will shake so severely that mountains fall apart, trees uproot, and all binds will snap, causing the wolf Fenrir to break free. After, the Midgardr Serpent Jörmungandr will fly into a rage and swim to the shore, causing the ocean to swell unto land. &quot;Naglfar&quot;, too, will be break free from its moorings. High describes the composition of &quot;Naglfar&quot; as that of the untrimmed nails of the dead, and warns about burying the dead with untrimmed nails, stating that &quot;the ship is made of dead people&#x27;s nails, and it is worth taking care lest anyone die with untrimmed nails, since such a person contributes much material to the ship &quot;Naglfar&quot; which gods and men wish would take a long time to finish&quot;. High adds that the ship will be captained by the jötunn Hrym, and that Naglfar will be carried along with the surging waters of the flood. Further in chapter 51, High quotes the &quot;Völuspá&quot; stanzas above that references the ship.

&quot;Naglfar&quot; receives a final mention in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, where it is included among a list of ships.

==Tullstorp Runestone==
If the images on the Tullstorp Runestone are correctly identified as being from Ragnarök, then &quot;Naglfar&quot; is shown below the monstrous wolf Fenrir. It has been pointed out that the ship image has beakheads both fore and aft unlike any known Viking ship, and is thus likely to be a symbolic ship.

The inscription mentions the name &quot;Ulfr&quot; (&quot;wolf&quot;), and the name &quot;Kleppir&quot;/&quot;Glippir&quot;. The last name is not fully understood, but may have represented &quot;Glæipiʀ&quot; which is similar to &quot;Gleipnir&quot; which was the rope with which the Fenrir wolf was bound. The two male names may have inspired the theme depicted on the runestone.

==Interpretations and theories==
In his study of treatment of hair and nails among the Indo-Europeans, Bruce Lincoln compares Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot; comments about nail disposal to an Avestan text, where Ahura Mazdā warns that daevas and xrafstras will spring from hair and nails that lay without correct burial, noting their conceptual similarities. Lincoln comments that &quot;the specific image of Naglfar, the &#x27;Nail-ship&#x27;, is undoubtedly specific to the Germanic world, although it does date to an ancient date within that area. But the basic idea on which it is based – that the improper disposal of hair and nails is an act which threatens the well-being of the cosmos – does ascend to the Indo-European period, as can be seen from comparisons [with Iranian myth].&quot;

== Cultural influence ==

The ship appears in the videogame &quot;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&quot; and in its spin-off game as the vehicle the evil Wild Hunt uses to travel between worlds.

The ship also appears in the videogame &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; in the &quot;Legion&quot; expansion. In the dungeon, Maw of Souls, players completed the last half of the 2 part dungeon on the Naglfar. This culminates as you defeat the final boss of the dungeon, Helya.

In &quot;EVE Online&quot;, the Naglfar is a dreadnought capital ship.

The magic tome of the boss character Lyon in &quot;Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones&quot; is named Naglfar.

John Myers Myers made Naglfar the name of the ship sunk in the opening paragraphs of &quot;Silverlock&quot;, setting his hero loose from the modern world to traipse his adventurous way into realms of myth and legend.

Naglfar is the name of a Swedish black metal band.

Naglfar is the central focus of the novel &quot;The Ship of the Dead&quot; by Rick Riordan, where the main characters go on a quest to prevent its launching.

<text>Hymir (Old Norse: ) is a jötunn in Norse mythology, and the owner of a brewing-cauldron fetched by the thunder god Thor for Ægir, who wants to hold a feast for the Æsir (gods). In &quot;Hymiskviða&quot;, Hymir is portrayed as the father of Týr, but in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Odin is Týr&#x27;s father.

== Name ==
The etymology of the Old Norse name &quot;Hymir&quot; remains unclear. It is perhaps related to the Norwegian &quot;humen&quot; (&#x27;limp, weary&#x27;) or &quot;humre&quot; (&#x27;whinny&#x27;; compare with MHG &quot;hummen&quot; &#x27;hum&#x27;). Andy Orchard has proposed the translation &#x27;creeper&#x27;.

&quot;Hymir&quot; is often used in kennings as a modifier for &quot;jötnarr&quot;.

== Attestations ==
===&quot;Hymiskviða&quot; and &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;===
&quot;Hymiskviða&quot; recounts how Thor and Týr obtain the cauldron from Hymir. His skull is unusually hard, and Thor breaks a cup by throwing it at Hymir&#x27;s head.

&quot;Hymiskviða&quot; also recounts Thor&#x27;s fishing for Jörmungandr, the Midgard serpent. Thor goes fishing with Hymir, using the head of Hymir&#x27;s best ox for bait, and catches Jörmungandr, who then either breaks loose or, as told in the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, is cut loose by Hymir. The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; provides the additional detail that while Thor was attempting to pull Jörmungandr in, his feet went through the bottom of the boat.

Hymir is also portrayed in &quot;Hymiskviða&quot; as a jötunn and the father of the god Týr. Scholar John Lindow notes that this may be a unique situation in Norse mythology, for if Loki also has a jötunn father, Fárbauti, he is only &quot;enumerated among the Æsir&quot; as Snorri Sturluson puts it in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, and thus not really part of their group.

===Picture stones===
This encounter between Thor and Jörmungandr seems to have been one of the most popular motifs in Norse art. Three picture stones have been linked with the story and show Hymir: the Ardre VIII image stone, the Hørdum stone, and the Gosforth Cross. A stone slab that may be a portion of a second cross at Gosforth also shows a fishing scene using an ox head for bait. The legend is also depicted on the Altuna Runestone, but its image does not show Hymir, possibly due to the narrow shape of that stone.

<text>Hróðr (Old Norse: &quot;famed&quot;) is a female jötunn in Norse mythology, mentioned in the Eddic poem &quot;Hymiskviða&quot;, in which Thor is referred to as &quot;Hróðr&#x27;s adversary.&quot; But the context is unclear, so the name could equally refer to an otherwise unknown giantess adversary of Thor, of which many are mentioned in other sources such as &quot;Hárbarðsljóð&quot;.

Some readings of &quot;Hymiskviða&quot; have identified Hróðr as the name of the mother of Týr, who appears in the poem, a giantess friendly to the Æsir and the wife of the jötunn Hymir. If Hróðr is Tyr&#x27;s mother, the poem suggests that Hymir is the father, but the later &quot;Prose Edda&quot; states that Odin is his father. Since fosterage of hero figures by giantesses is a common trope in Norse folklore, Hymir could be a foster-father, an important relationship in Viking culture.

== Name ==
The Old Norse name &quot;hróðr&quot; has been translated as &#x27;glorious, famed&#x27;.
