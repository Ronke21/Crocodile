<text>Lewes ( ) is an incorporated city on the Delaware Bay in eastern Sussex County, Delaware, United States. According to the 2020 census, its population was 3,303. Along with neighboring Rehoboth Beach, Lewes is one of the principal cities of Delaware&#x27;s rapidly growing Cape Region. The city lies within the Salisbury, Maryland–Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area. Lewes proudly claims to be &quot;The First Town in The First State.&quot;

==History==
Lewes was the site of the first European settlement in Delaware, a whaling and trading post that Dutch settlers founded on June 3, 1631, and named Zwaanendael (Swan Valley). The colony had a short existence, as a local tribe of Lenape Indians killed all 32 settlers in 1632.

The area remained rather neglected by the Dutch until, under the threat of annexation from the colony of Maryland, the city of Amsterdam made a grant of land at the Hoernkills (the area around Cape Henlopen, near the current town of Lewes) to a group of Mennonites for settlement in 1662. A total of 35 men were to be included in the settlement, led by a Pieter Cornelisz Plockhoy of Zierikzee and funded by a sizable loan from the city to get them established. 41 persons came with Plockhoy from the Netherlands to the Hoernkill onboard the Dutch ship the Sint Jacob, one of whom was Otto Wolgast from the town of Wolgast, Pomerania. The settlement was established in 1663, and lasted until the very next year; in 1664, the English captured New Netherland from the Dutch, and they ordered the settlement razed with reports indicating that “not even a nail” was left there.

The Dutch colonists proved slow to regroup, but a new settlement gradually regrew around the Hoernkills. In late December 1673, when the area was briefly held again by the Dutch, the settlement was attacked and burned down again by a group of Maryland colonists. In 1680, under the authority of the Duke of York, who had been granted such authority by his brother, King Charles II, the village (and county) was reorganized and known for two years as New Deale, Deale County, Delaware. A log courthouse was authorized to be built at this time. An Anglican congregation was established by 1681 and a Presbyterian church was built in 1682.

In 1682, the Delaware colonies were given to William Penn by King Charles II as payment for a family debt. When Penn arrived in the New World later that year, he renamed the county as Sussex and the Hoernkills settlement as Lewes, in commemoration of the county and town in England. Lewes became and remained the county seat of Sussex County until 1791, when it was moved to a more west-central county location, the current town of Georgetown. The town was also known as &quot;Lewistown&quot; or &quot;Lewestown&quot;.

On April 6 and 7, 1813, during the War of 1812, Royal Navy vessels led by HMS &quot;Poictiers&quot; under the command of Captain Sir John Beresford briefly and ineffectually bombarded the town. A cannonball from the bombardment is lodged in the foundation of Cannonball House, which now serves as the town&#x27;s maritime museum.

Lewes was incorporated by an act of the state assembly on Feb. 2, 1818. The act provided for five persons to be chosen as commissioners to be known as &quot;Trustees of the Town of Lewes.&quot;

Lewes Beach itself was an important stop on the Underground Railroad in the years leading up to the American Civil War. As a &quot;border state,&quot; Delaware was not part of the Confederacy, but was still quite dangerous for fugitive slaves. Several houses in Lewes thus housed escaping slaves; these &quot;safe houses&quot; were identified by the residents placing a single candle in the top window of the house.

In 1941, the United States built Fort Miles on Cape Henlopen, immediately east of Lewes, to defend Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the oil refineries and factories on its shores, as well as the city of Philadelphia.

Fort Miles never saw any major action; except for range practice, it fired its guns only once between its establishment and the end of World War II. Fort Miles ceased operation altogether in 1991 and was deeded to the State of Delaware.
In addition to Fort Miles, the Cape Henlopen Archeological District, Coleman House, Cool Spring Presbyterian Church, De Vries Palisade, Delaware Breakwater and Lewes Harbor, Fisher Homestead, Fisher&#x27;s Paradise, Col. David Hall House, Hopkins Covered Bridge Farm, Lewes Historic District, Lewes Presbyterian Church, Lightship WAL 539, Maull House, National Harbor of Refuge and Delaware Breakwater Harbor Historic District, Pagan Creek Dike, Roosevelt Inlet Shipwreck, William Russell House, St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Lewes, Townsend Site, and Wolfe&#x27;s Neck Site are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
===Home to governors===
Six men who served as Delaware governor were born in or made their home in Lewes. Three of those men lived on Lewes&#x27; Second Street. Brothers Daniel and Caleb Rodney, sons of John Rodney, first cousin of Caesar Rodney, each served as governor of Delaware. Each a member of the Federalist Party, Daniel served from 1814 to 1817, while Caleb served as acting governor from 1822 to 1823. Ebe Walters Tunnell moved to Lewes in 1873 to enter the drug and hardware business in part of the old Caleb Rodney House on Second Street. Tunnell worked his way up the state government hierarchy before unsuccessfully running for governor in 1892. Four years later, the Democrat won the election, and served from 1897 to 1901.

===City motto and name===
As Lewes was the earliest settlement in the state, and Delaware was the first state to ratify the Constitution, the town refers to itself as &quot;The First Town in the First State.&quot; Lewes is named after the town of Lewes in England, which is situated in a county named Sussex (from which Sussex County, Delaware, takes its name). Lewes, Sussex, England, also has the same seal.

Lewes serves as a vacation and resort spot popular with residents of Washington, D.C., and the surrounding suburbs. Even though the city limits primarily sit on the lower reach of the Delaware Bay, it is nonetheless considered an ocean resort, particularly as the ocean is nearby at Cape Henlopen. Lewes is among those communities which have banned smoking in its public parks.

===Transportation===
Delaware Route 1 (DE 1) passes just outside city limits at Five Points where DE 1, U.S. Route 9 (US 9), DE 404, DE 23 and DE 1D (Plantation Road) intersect. There are three main arterial roads that connect Lewes to DE 1: New Road, Savannah Road (US 9 Business) and King&#x27;s Highway (US 9). US 9 passes to the southeast of downtown on the Theodore C. Freeman Memorial Highway. Parking meters are in effect for on-street parking and parking lots in the downtown area between May 1 and October 14 and at parking lots at Lewes Beach between May 1 and September 30.
The southern terminus of the Cape May–Lewes Ferry is located in Lewes. The ferry provides passenger and automobile ferry service between southern Delaware and southern New Jersey, crossing the Delaware Bay to North Cape May, New Jersey, and serves as part of US 9. The ferry crossing is long and takes 85 minutes. Cape Water Tours &amp; Taxi operates a round-trip water taxi service between Lewes and Dewey Beach via the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal on Friday evenings in the summer months, offering access to dining and nightlife in Dewey Beach.

DART First State operates the Lewes Transit Center park and ride just outside Lewes along DE 1. The transit center serves local bus routes providing service across Sussex County, with expanded Beach Bus service to the Delaware Beaches in the summer months, and inter-county bus service to other part of Delaware. This park and ride serves the Route 201 bus to the Rehoboth Beach Boardwalk, the Route 204 bus which heads along Savannah Road into Lewes to Cape Henlopen Drive and the Cape May–Lewes Ferry terminal and south to Rehoboth Beach, the Route 206 bus to Georgetown, and the Route 208 bus to Ocean City, Maryland. The Route 305 &quot;Beach Connection&quot; bus provides service on weekends and holidays in the summer to the Lewes Transit Center Park and Ride from Wilmington, the Christiana Mall, Middletown, and Dover. The Route 307 bus provides year-round service to Milford, Frederica, and Dover. The Delaware Department of Transportation built the Lewes Transit Center Park and Ride, with groundbreaking taking place on March 9, 2016 and the park and ride opening in May 2017. The Delaware River and Bay Authority operates a shuttle bus route in the summer months that connects the Cape May–Lewes Ferry to the Tanger Outlets and Rehoboth Beach. The city of Lewes formerly operated the Lewes Line bus service serving points of interest in the city daily from May to September.

Lewes was served by a branch of the Delaware Coast Line Railroad that originated in Georgetown, whereupon transfers could be made to trains north to Dover and Wilmington. Passenger trains operated on this branch by its predecessor company, the Pennsylvania Railroad, but ended between 1936 and 1938. The Maryland, Delaware &amp; Virginia Railway operated a passenger train route from Lewes that followed a path to the north of the DCL route. It followed a path through Milton, Ellendale, Greenwood, crossing the state border into Maryland, then continuing further west to Love Point, whereupon travelers would connect with a ferry to Baltimore. This service was replaced by bus service by early 1932.

A rail with trail known as the Georgetown-Lewes Trail opened along the railroad line on October 19, 2016, with future plans to extend the trail to Georgetown. In 2017, it was announced the Delaware Coast Line Railroad would be abandoned between Cool Spring and Lewes after the swing bridge over the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal was closed due to being structurally unsound and repairs were determined to be too costly. The Junction and Breakwater Trail is a rail trail for bicyclists and hikers that connects Lewes and Rehoboth Beach, running mostly along a former Penn Central Railroad right-of-way.

===Utilities===

The Lewes Board of Public Works (BPW) provides electricity, water, and sewer service to the city. The BPW was established by an act of the Delaware General Assembly on March 15, 1901. Lewes formerly had a power plant that generated electricity for the city, but the plant&#x27;s usage was reduced as the city brought in power from outside and the plant was shut down in the 1970s due to rising fuel costs. Lewes currently purchases power from Constellation which is transmitted to the city over Delmarva Power lines. The BPW is a member of the Delaware Municipal Electric Corporation. Trash collection is provided by the city while recycling collection is provided under contract by Republic Services. Natural gas service in Lewes is provided by Chesapeake Utilities.

<text>Match play is a scoring system for golf in which a player, or team, earns a point for each hole in which they have bested their opponents; as opposed to stroke play, in which the total number of strokes is counted over one or more rounds of 18 holes. In match play the winner is the player, or team, with the most points at the end of play.

Although most professional tournaments are played using the stroke play scoring system, there are, or have been, some exceptions, for example the WGC Match Play and the Volvo World Match Play Championship, and most team events, for example the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup, all of which are in match play format.

==Scoring system==
Unlike stroke play, in which the unit of scoring is the total number of strokes taken over one or more rounds of golf, match play scoring consists of individual holes won, halved or lost. On each hole, the most that can be gained is one point. Golfers play as normal, counting the strokes taken on a given hole. The golfer with the lowest score on a given hole receives one point. If the golfers tie, then the hole is tied (or halved). For example, in an 18-hole match, the first hole is a par-4 and Player A scores a 3 (birdie) and Player B scores a 4 (par); Player A is now 1-up with 17 to play. In the same match on the second hole, a par-5, Player A takes 8 strokes and Player B takes 5 (par); Player B wins the hole and the match is now tied (or &quot;all square&quot;) with 16 to play. On the third hole, a par-3, both players take 3 strokes and the match is tied with 15 holes to play. Once a player is &quot;up&quot; more holes than there are holes remaining to play the match is over. For example, if after 12 holes Player A is 7-up with six left to play, Player A is said to have won the match &quot;7 and 6&quot;.

A team that is leading by &quot;x&quot; holes with &quot;x&quot; holes remaining is said to be &quot;dormie-&quot;x&quot;&quot; or simply &quot;dormie&quot;, meaning that they need one more halved hole to win the match (or that the other team must win all the remaining holes in order to tie the match). For example, if Player A is 2-up with 2 to play, he is dormie; the worst outcome for Player A at that point is a tie, unless the format calls for extra holes to determine a winner.

In a tournament event where the score is tied after the last hole (usually 18 or 36), the players will play on until a player wins a hole (sudden death). In the Ryder Cup and other similar team events, the match is not finished this way, and the teams each receive a half point. In such events there are points accumulated over several days, playing different formats, and the total determines the winning team.

==Scoring using handicaps==
Scoring match play using handicaps is not done exactly the same way it is done in a stroke play event. In 18-hole stroke play where Player A is a 10 handicap and Player B is a 19 handicap, one stroke is deducted from Player A&#x27;s score on the ten hardest holes (by handicap rating on scorecard). For Player B, two strokes are deducted on the hardest hole and one stroke deducted on the other 17 holes. In match play, Player A would play as &quot;scratch&quot; (zero handicap) and Player B would deduct one stroke on the nine hardest holes. In other words, the 10 handicap becomes zero and the 19 handicap becomes nine.

In team match play competition, all player handicaps are compared to the lowest of the handicaps. Consider an example where Team A consists of Player A1 (a 10 handicap) and Player A2 (a 15 handicap), and where Team B consists of Player B1 (a 19 handicap) and Player B2 (a 30 handicap). In this example, Player A1 plays as &quot;scratch&quot; (zero handicap), A2 deducts one stroke on the five hardest holes, B1 deducts one stroke on the nine hardest holes, and B2 deducts two strokes on the two hardest holes and one stroke on the other 16 holes.

Some competitions may restrict the handicap differential between playing partners. This is not required by the USGA but may be used by local clubs and tournaments. Using the above team play example and if a local rule limits any player to having a handicap that is at most 8 strokes higher than their partner, Player B2&#x27;s handicap would be adjusted to 27 for the purposes of that competition (Player B1&#x27;s handicap of 19 + 8 = 27).

==Tournaments featuring match play==
Currently, there are few professional tournaments that use match play. They include the biennial Ryder Cup played by two teams, one representing the USA and the other representing Europe; the biennial Presidents Cup for teams representing the US and International (non-European) players; and the older Volvo World Match Play Championship, an invitational event which is now part of the European Tour. The PGA Championship, one of the majors, used match play for its first 39 editions (1916–1957), but changed to stroke play in 1958.

Women&#x27;s professional golf had no event directly comparable to the Accenture Championship until the HSBC Women&#x27;s World Match Play Championship was introduced in 2005. After it was canceled in 2007, the LPGA was without a match play event until the Sybase Match Play Championship was played from 2010 to 2012. Women&#x27;s golf also has the biennial Solheim Cup staged between two teams, one including USA-born players and one including players born in Europe. In 2014, a new women&#x27;s match play tournament began, the International Crown – a biennial match play competition featuring teams from eight countries. From 2005 to 2008, women&#x27;s golf held the Lexus Cup, an event pitting an International team against an Asian team.

The USGA championships – Amateur, Junior Amateur, Mid-Amateur, Senior Amateur, and team (four-ball) for both men and women – are conducted with two rounds of stroke play to cut the field to 64 (individual) or 32 (teams), and then proceed to a single-elimination match play tournament. All elimination matches are 18 holes except for the final in individual competitions, which is 36 holes.

The European Tour and PGA Tour Australasia co-sanction a Perth (Australia) tournament that in 2017 adopts a match play format. It is conducted with three rounds of stroke play, with two cuts—one to 65 at the end of the second round, and one to 24 at the end of the third round, then proceeds on the final day to a single-elimination match play tournament with the top eight exempt from the first round. All elimination matches are six holes, with a tie-breaker hole played twice. The first hole will be a standard par-3, and the second time around closest to pin will end the round.

The European Tour also has the GolfSixes, which uses 16 pairs of players, by country, and uses a round robin grouping of four groups of four, with each group playing three matches with a similar format to the elimination matches in Perth, and the results determine second-day matches. Each group will play a maximum of 36 holes (six matches).

==Strategy==
Golfers can employ a slightly different strategy during a match play event since the scoring is different. The situation in the match and the outcome of each shot already played on a hole will both be taken into account. On the whole, match play encourages more aggressive play, especially at the professional level, where a par is not usually good enough to win a hole. Since a very poor result for a hole is no worse than a slightly-below-average result when playing against an opponent with an average score, it often makes sense to accept the higher risk connected with aggressive tactics. However, in some circumstances players will be especially cautious in match play. For instance, a player may choose to play more conservatively if the opponent has hit a poor tee shot or is otherwise under pressure to compensate for a poor start on a particular hole, reasoning that there is a good chance to win the hole with an average result.

==Alternative forms of match play==
Forms of match play that allow three or more players to compete individually include &quot;Irish match play&quot;, &quot;Rowan match play&quot; and skins.

Another form is &quot;medal match play&quot;, which combines the head-to-head match play style with medal or stroke play scores. Each match between two players or teams of players is determined by the 18-hole medal score instead of on a hole-by-hole basis. The advantage is that ties in group or pool play can be broken by overall medal scores. This format was used in the Piccadilly Medal, the Liggett &amp; Myers Open Match Play Championship, the 1986 Seiko-Tucson Match Play Championship, the Dunhill Cup, World Golf Final, and starting in 2018, albeit with a nine-hole medal score, the Belgian Knockout.

<doc id="92731" wikidata="Q5281646" url="?curid=92731" title="Disconnection (Scientology)">
<text>Disconnection is the severance of all ties between a Scientologist and a friend, colleague, or family member deemed to be antagonistic towards Scientology. The practice of disconnection is a form of shunning. Among Scientologists, disconnection is viewed as an important method of removing obstacles to one&#x27;s spiritual growth. In some circumstances, disconnection has ended marriages and separated children from their parents.

The Church of Scientology has repeatedly denied that such a policy exists, though its website acknowledged the practice and described it as a human right. In the United States, the Church has tried to argue in court that disconnection is a constitutionally protected religious practice. However, this argument was rejected because the pressure put on individual Scientologists to disconnect means it is not voluntary.

==Policy==
Antagonists to the Church of Scientology are declared by the Church to be suppressive persons (SPs) or potential trouble sources (PTSes). The Church teaches that association with these people impedes a member&#x27;s progress along the Bridge to Total Freedom.

In &quot;Introduction to Scientology Ethics&quot;, L. Ron Hubbard sets out the doctrine that by being connected to suppressive persons, a Scientologist could become a Potential Trouble Source (PTS):

Hubbard defined &quot;handling&quot; as an action to lessen a situation towards an antagonistic individual by means of communication, and &quot;disconnection&quot; as a decision to cut communication with another individual. Hubbard also wrote that ethics officers should recommend handling rather than disconnection when the antagonistic individual is a close relative. He also stated that failure, or refusal, to disconnect from a suppressive person is a suppressive act by itself. In one case cited by the UK government, a six-year-old girl was declared suppressive for failing to disconnect from her mother. Sociologist Roy Wallis reports that Scientologists connected to a suppressive would usually be required to handle &quot;or&quot; disconnect, although he found some &quot;Ethics Orders&quot; which ordered unconditional disconnection.

According to Church statements, disconnection is used as a &quot;last resort&quot;, only to be employed if the people antagonistic to Scientology do not cease their antagonism—even after being provided with &quot;true data&quot; about Scientology, since it is taught that usually only people with false data are antagonistic to the Church.

Originally, disconnection involved not only ending communication with someone but also declaring it publicly. The Scientology publication &quot;The Auditor&quot; included notices of disconnection from named individuals. It was also common for Scientologists to send short letters to the suppressive person, to warn them that they were disconnected. Roy Wallis interviewed a number of people who had been declared suppressive, some of whom had received hundreds of these letters. The Scientologist was also required to take &quot;any required civil action such as disavowal, separation or divorce&quot; to cut off contact with the suppressive.

The policy was introduced in 1965 in a policy letter written by Hubbard. The &quot;Code of Reform&quot; introduced by Hubbard in 1968 discontinued fair game and security checks, and cancelled &quot;disconnection as a relief to those suffering from familial suppression&quot;. However, although the words &quot;fair game&quot;, &quot;disconnection&quot;, and &quot;security checking&quot; were discontinued due to them causing bad public relations, the practices continued with alternate labels. When the New Zealand Government set up a Commission of Inquiry into Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard wrote to them saying that disconnection had been cancelled and that there was no intention to bring it back. The Commission welcomed the letter, but noted Hubbard did not promise never to re-introduce the practice of disconnection.

In his book &quot;A Piece of Blue Sky&quot;, Jon Atack cites an internal document dated August 1982 that, he alleges, re-introduced the disconnection policy. A belief that disconnection was being used again, and not as a last resort, led a group of British Scientologists to resign from the Church in 1984, while keeping their allegiance to the beliefs of Scientology. Their interpretation was that the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard &quot;encourage the unity of the family&quot; and therefore that the disconnection policy was &quot;a misrepresentation or misapplication&quot;.

==Examples of application==

===The 1960s===
In 1966, UK newspaper the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; quoted a disconnection letter from Scientologist Karen Henslow to her mother:

Henslow, a thirty-year-old sufferer from manic depression, had been a Scientology staff member for two weeks when she disconnected. The message was accompanied by a second letter apologising for the first and saying that it had been mailed without her permission.

Raymond Buckingham, a singer who ran a voice school in Manhattan, was recruited into Scientology by one of his pupils. He was asked to disconnect from a business associate who had been labelled suppressive. When he spoke out publicly against Scientology, his Scientologist pupils disconnected from him and refused to pay him. One of these was a famous singer for whom he had arranged a series of performances.

Roy Wallis reproduced a &quot;Disconnection Order&quot; from 1965 which orders a Scientologist to disconnect from the publications of the Food and Drug Administration. It states, &quot;The FDA literature he comes in contact with is not to be read by him at all.&quot;

Disconnection was the subject of a 1970 court case in which the Church of Scientology unsuccessfully attempted to sue the Member of Parliament (MP) Geoffrey Johnson-Smith over negative comments he had made on BBC television. To defend his claims that families were being alienated, he produced evidence of specific cases in court. The judge described it as &quot;astonishing&quot; that the Scientologists did not contest these allegations.

In 1969, the New Zealand government set up an official inquiry into the Church of Scientology. The ensuing Dumbleton-Powles Report quoted from a number of disconnection letters and also reproduced some &quot;Ethics Orders&quot; which identified suppressive persons who were &quot;not to be communicated with in any way&quot;. Teenage Scientologist Erin O&#x27;Donnell had written to her non-Scientologist aunt, &quot;If you try to ring me I will not answer, I will not read any mail you send, and I refuse to have anything to do with you in any way whatsoever. All communication is cut completely.&quot; The Commission concluded that Scientologists had been required to choose between family relationships and continued involvement in Scientology.

The 1971 UK government investigation into Scientology and ensuing &quot;Foster Report&quot; reproduced a number of internal &quot;Ethics Orders&quot;. One of these, dating from November 1967, concerns a member who had asked for a refund. It declares him to be a suppressive person and continues, &quot;Any and all persons connected [to him] are declared Potential Trouble Sources and are not to be Trained or Processed before they have presented evidence in writing ... of handling or disconnecting&quot;.

Joe Boyd, the manager of the Incredible String Band, was a Scientologist for a time in the early 1970s. He left when he was told that friends who were hostile to Scientology were interfering with his progress and he must disassociate from them.

Cyril Vosper received a &quot;Declaration of Enemy&quot; in response to his violations of Scientology ethics and justice codes. It is reproduced in his book &quot;The Mind Benders&quot; and states, &quot;Anyone connected to him is not to be processed or trained until he or she has disconnected from him in writing.&quot;

===The 1980s and 1990s===
In 1982, David Mayo and other former Church of Scientology executives were subjected to an internal &quot;Committee of Evidence&quot; for alleged transgressions. The committee issued a permanent writ of Disconnection, forbidding all other Scientologists from having contact with the accused.

In &quot;A Piece of Blue Sky&quot;, Jon Atack describes being ordered to disconnect from a friend in 1983, shortly after the policy was re-introduced.

In his 1984 High Court judgment, which considered many aspects of Scientology, English judge Justice Latey wrote that &quot;many examples [of disconnection] have been given and proved in evidence.&quot; As examples, he reproduced two disconnection letters. One is written by a Scientologist to his fiancée. In the other, a man writes to his business partner and former friend, &quot;What you are now doing in setting yourself against the Church is not only very suppressive but also non-survival for you, your family and any group you are associated with.&quot;

That year, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; brought up further examples of disconnection, including a 13-year-old boy who disconnected from his father and a woman who said her fiancé was forced to abandon her. The fiancé concerned said &quot;it was a personal decision&quot; and a Church of Scientology spokesman was quoted denying that there is a policy to split up relationships.

Also in 1984, &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; interviewed Gulliver Smithers, a former Scientologist who had left the group&#x27;s base at Saint Hill Manor when he was 14 years old. Smithers explained that disconnection was an everyday part of life in Saint Hill, &quot;It goes round by word of mouth when someone is an outcast. He or she is just ignored and shunned. It was what we were brought up to do.&quot;

In a lengthy court case in the 1980s, ex-member Lawrence Wollersheim successfully argued that he had been coerced into disconnecting from his wife, parents, and other family members. Since the disconnection was not voluntary, it did not count as protected religious practice.

In 1995, the UK local paper &quot;Kent Today&quot; talked to Pauline Day, whose Scientologist daughter Helen had sent a disconnection letter and then dropped all contact, even changing her phone number. A spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology denied that this decision had anything to do with the Church.

===21st century===
A &quot;Buffalo News&quot; investigation in 2005 spoke to the sisters and brother of Fred Lennox, a Scientologist who, according to them, was being manipulated and exploited financially by the group. The paper also quoted an internal so-called &quot;Ethics Order&quot; instructing him to &quot;handle or disconnect&quot; from his sister Tanya because of anti-Scientology comments she had made online. Lennox himself and Church of Scientology spokesmen denied this.

Ex-Scientologist Tory Christman told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine that her Scientologist husband and friends refused to talk to her after she left the Church.

In January 2008, Jenna Miscavige Hill, niece of David Miscavige, spoke out about the policy&#x27;s effect on her family. She revealed that, once her parents left the Church while she remained, she had been forbidden to answer the telephone in case she spoke to them and that her parents only restored occasional access to her by threatening legal action. Another second-generation Scientologist, Astra Woodcraft, told ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot; that she had been forbidden any contact with her father once he left the Church and she was still a member. She used her weekly laundry time to secretly meet up with him.

To make the television documentary &quot;Scientology and Me&quot;, the BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; team spoke to two mothers whose daughters had disconnected, one for nearly seven years. Mike Henderson, an ex-Scientologist, told &quot;Panorama&quot; how he had not spoken to his father during his time as a member. When Henderson left Scientology, he re-established communication with his father, but most of the rest of the family disconnected from Henderson as a result.

Actor Jason Beghe has alleged that after he left the Church of Scientology in 2007, former friends who remained in the Church disconnected from him.

In 2009, a man named Shane Clark was about to be declared a suppressive person for being employed by Marc Headley, author of &quot;Blown for Good: Behind the Iron Curtain of Scientology&quot;. Clark secretly recorded a meeting between himself and Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis and his wife Jessica Feshbach. In the tape, Davis is heard not only threatening Clark with suppressive person declaration, but telling him he will be the subject of disconnection. Clark was later declared, and his family disconnected from him. Despite the direct evidence to the contrary, Davis denied the existence of the disconnection policy in a television interview on CNN. Paul Haggis, a film director, disputed this in his 2009 resignation letter from Scientology. Haggis wrote, &quot;We all know this policy exists&quot;, and said his wife had been ordered to disconnect from her ex-Scientologist parents, &quot;although it caused her terrible personal pain. For a year-and-a-half, [she] didn&#x27;t speak to her parents and they had limited access to their grandchild. It was a terrible time.&quot; In response, Davis reiterated that there is no Church policy of disconnection.

When actress Leah Remini publicly left the Church in 2013, Remini&#x27;s sister, Nicole, revealed that she and the rest of Remini&#x27;s family did as well to avoid being split up by the Church&#x27;s disconnection policy.

==Comments by religious scholars==
The &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; consulted three religious scholars about disconnection in Scientology, two of whom had been recommended by the organization itself. One, F. K. Flinn of Washington University in St. Louis, said that shunning practices such as disconnection are common to young religions. He drew parallels with the dis-fellowship practiced by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

This view is not shared by all religious scholars. J. Gordon Melton, of the Institute for the Study of American Religion, said that disconnection goes much further than the policies of most modern religions, and commented &quot;I just think it would be better for all concerned if they just let them go ahead and get out and everyone goes their own way, and not make such a big deal of it. The policy hurts everybody.&quot; Newton Maloney of Fuller Theological Seminary also described the policy as &quot;too extreme&quot;.

&quot;Buffalo News&quot; consulted Stephen A. Kent of the University of Alberta, who said that hostility towards critics, including the member&#x27;s own family, is an ingrained part of Scientology ethics and justice, according to which the survival of the Church is all-important.

==In popular culture==
William S. Burroughs, who briefly dabbled with Scientology, wrote extensively about it during the late 1960s, weaving some of its jargon into his fictional works, as well as authoring nonfiction essays about it. He uses the term &quot;Disconnect&quot; in a Scientological context in &quot;Ali&#x27;s Smile: Naked Scientology&quot; and other works. In the end, however, he abandoned Scientology and publicly criticized it in an editorial for the &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot; in 1970.

<doc id="92733" wikidata="Q127234" url="?curid=92733" title="Albert A. Michelson">
<text>Albert Abraham Michelson (surname pronunciation anglicized as Michael-son; December 19, 1852 – May 9, 1931) was an American physicist known for his work on measuring the speed of light and especially for the Michelson–Morley experiment. In 1907, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics, becoming the first American to win the Nobel Prize in a science. He was the founder and the first head of the physics departments of Case School of Applied Science (now Case Western Reserve University) and the University of Chicago.

== Life ==
Michelson was born in Strelno, Posen, Kingdom of Prussia (modern-day Strzelno, Poland), to Jewish parents, the son of Samuel Michelson and his wife, Rozalia Przyłubska. He moved to the US with his parents in 1855, at the age of two. He grew up in the mining towns of Murphy&#x27;s Camp, California, and Virginia City, Nevada, where his father was a merchant. His family was non-religious, and Michelson himself was a lifelong agnostic. He spent his high school years in San Francisco in the home of his aunt, Henriette Levy (née Michelson), who was the mother of author Harriet Lane Levy.
His sister was the novelist Miriam Michelson.

President Ulysses S. Grant awarded Michelson a special appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1869. During his four years as a midshipman at the Academy, Michelson excelled in optics, heat, climatology and technical drawing. After graduating in 1873 and two years at sea, he returned to the Naval Academy in 1875 to become an instructor in physics and chemistry until 1879. In 1879, he was posted to the Nautical Almanac Office, Washington (part of the United States Naval Observatory), to work with Simon Newcomb. In the following year he obtained leave of absence to continue his studies in Europe. He visited the Universities of Berlin and Heidelberg, and the Collège de France and École Polytechnique in Paris.

Michelson was fascinated with the sciences, and the problem of measuring the speed of light in particular. While at Annapolis, he conducted his first experiments on the speed of light, as part of a class demonstration in 1877. His Annapolis experiment was refined, and in 1879, he measured the speed of light in air to be kilometres per second, and estimated the speed of light in vacuum as , or . After two years of studies in Europe, he resigned from the Navy in 1881. In 1883 he accepted a position as professor of physics at the Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland, Ohio, and concentrated on developing an improved interferometer. In 1887 he and Edward Morley carried out the famous Michelson–Morley experiment which failed to detect evidence of the existence of the luminiferous ether. He later moved on to use astronomical interferometers in the measurement of stellar diameters and in measuring the separations of binary stars.

In 1889 Michelson became a professor at Clark University at Worcester, Massachusetts, and in 1892 was appointed professor and the first head of the department of physics at the newly organized University of Chicago. In 1902, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

In 1907, Michelson had the honor of being the first American to receive a Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for his optical precision instruments and the spectroscopic and metrological investigations carried out with their aid&quot;. He also won the Copley Medal in 1907, the Henry Draper Medal in 1916 and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1923. A crater on the Moon is named after him.

He returned to military service in the closing months of World War One as a Lieutenant Commander in the Naval Reserve, serving in the Bureau of Ordnance. He was promoted to Commander in the reserve in May 1919 and was recalled briefly to active duty in the 9th Naval District before being released from service on 30 September 1921.

Michelson died in Pasadena, California, at the age of 78. The University of Chicago Residence Halls remembered Michelson and his achievements by dedicating &#x27;Michelson House&#x27; in his honor. Case Western Reserve has dedicated a Michelson House to him, and Michelson Hall (an academic building of science classrooms, laboratories and offices) at the United States Naval Academy also bears his name. Michelson Laboratory at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in Ridgecrest, California, is named for him. There is a display in the publicly accessible area of the Lab which includes facsimiles of Michelson&#x27;s Nobel Prize medal, the prize document, and examples of his diffraction gratings. In 2017, a newly renovated physics research center at the University of Chicago was renamed in honor of Michelson as well.

Numerous awards, lectures, and honors have been created in Albert A. Michelson&#x27;s name. Some of the current awards and lectures named for Michelson include the following: the Bomem-Michelson Award and Lecture annually presented until 2017 by the Coblentz Society; the Michelson–Morley Award and Lecture, along with the Michelson Lecture Series, and the Michelson Postdoctoral Prize Lectureship, all of which are given annually by Case Western Reserve University; the A.A. Michelson Award presented every year by the Computer Measurement Group; the Albert A. Michelson Award given by the Navy League of the United States; and the Michelson Memorial Lecture Series presented annually by the Division of Mathematics and Science at the U.S. Naval Academy.

== Family ==
In 1877 Michelson married Margaret Hemingway, daughter of a wealthy New York stockbroker and lawyer and the niece of his commander William T. Sampson. They had two sons and a daughter.

In 1899, he married Edna Stanton. They raised three daughters.

He is a great uncle of physicist Peter Michelson.

== Speed of light ==


=== Early measurements ===
Michelson was fascinated by light all his life. Once asked why he studied light, he reputedly said, &quot;because it&#x27;s so much fun&quot;.

As early as 1869, while serving as an officer in the United States Navy, Michelson started planning a repeat of the rotating-mirror method of Léon Foucault for measuring the speed of light, using improved optics and a longer baseline. He conducted some preliminary measurements using largely improvised equipment in 1878, about the same time that his work came to the attention of Simon Newcomb, director of the Nautical Almanac Office who was already advanced in planning his own study.

Michelson&#x27;s formal experiments took place in June and July 1879. He constructed a frame building along the north sea wall of the Naval Academy to house the machinery. Michelson published his result of 299,910 ± 50 km/s in 1879 before joining Newcomb in Washington DC to assist with his measurements there. Thus began a long professional collaboration and friendship between the two.

Simon Newcomb, with his more adequately funded project, obtained a value of 299,860 ± 30 km/s, just at the extreme edge of consistency with Michelson&#x27;s. Michelson continued to &quot;refine&quot; his method and in 1883 published a measurement of 299,853 ± 60 km/s, rather closer to that of his mentor.

=== Mount Wilson and Lookout Mountain ===
In 1906, a novel electrical method was used by E. B. Rosa and the National Bureau of Standards to obtain a value for the speed of light of 299,781 ± 10 km/s. Though this result has subsequently been shown to be severely biased by the poor electrical standards in use at the time, it seems to have set a fashion for rather lower measured values.

From 1920, Michelson started planning a definitive measurement from the Mount Wilson Observatory, using a baseline to Lookout Mountain, a prominent bump on the south ridge of Mount San Antonio (&quot;Old Baldy&quot;), some 22 miles distant.

In 1922, the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey began two years of painstaking measurement of the baseline using the recently available invar tapes. With the baseline length established in 1924, measurements were carried out over the next two years to obtain the published value of 299,796 ± 4 km/s.

Famous as the measurement is, it was beset by problems, not least of which was the haze created by the smoke from forest fires which blurred the mirror image. It is also probable that the intensively detailed work of the geodetic survey, with an estimated error of less than one part in 1 million, was compromised by a shift in the baseline arising from the Santa Barbara earthquake of June 29, 1925, which was an estimated magnitude of 6.3 on the Richter scale.

The now-famous Michelson–Morley experiment also influenced the affirmation attempts of peer Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity and special relativity, using similar optical instrumentation. These instruments and related collaborations included the participation of fellow physicists Dayton Miller, Hendrik Lorentz, and Robert Shankland.
=== Michelson, Pease, and Pearson ===
The period after 1927 marked the advent of new measurements of the speed of light using novel electro-optic devices, all substantially lower than Michelson&#x27;s 1926 value.

Michelson sought another measurement, but this time in an evacuated tube to avoid difficulties in interpreting the image owing to atmospheric effects. In 1929, he began a collaboration with Francis G. Pease and Fred Pearson to perform a measurement in a 1.6 km tube 3 feet in diameter at the Irvine Ranch near Santa Ana, California. In multiple reflections the light path was increased to 5 miles. For the first time in history the speed of light was measured in an almost perfect vacuum of 0.5 mm of mercury. Michelson died with only 36 of the 233 measurement series completed and the experiment was subsequently beset by geological instability and condensation problems before the result of , consistent with the prevailing electro-optic values, was published posthumously in 1935.

=== Application of basic statistical principles in Michelson&#x27;s study of speed of light ===
During June and early July 1879, Michelson refined experimental arrangements from those developed by Hippolyte Fizeau and Léon Foucault. The experimental setup was as follows: Light generated from a source is directed towards a rotating mirror through a slit on a fixed plate; the rotating mirror reflects the incoming light and at a certain angle, towards the direction where another fixed flat mirror is placed whose surface is perpendicular to the incoming ray of light; the rotating mirror should have rotated by an angle &quot;α&quot; by the time the ray of light travels back and is reflected again towards the fixed plate (the distance between the fixed mirror and the rotating one is recorded as &quot;D&quot;); a displacement from the slit is detected on the plate which measures &quot;d&quot;; the distance from the rotating mirror to the fixed plate is designated as the radius &quot;r&quot; while the number of revolutions per second of the mirror is recorded as &quot;ω&quot;. In this way, ; ; speed of light can be derived as .

While at plain sight, four measured quantities are involved: distance &quot;D&quot;, radius &quot;r&quot;, displacement &quot;d&quot; and rotating mirror revolution per second &quot;ω&quot;, which seems simple; yet based on the limitation of the measurement technology at that time, great efforts were made by Michelson to reduce systematic errors and apply subsequent corrections. For instance, he adopted a steel measuring tape with a said length of 100 feet and he intended to measure tens of times across the distance; still, he measured its length against a copy of the official standard yard to find out it as 100.006 feet, thus eliminating a systematic error, albeit small.

Aside from the efforts to reduce as much as possible the systematic errors, repeated measurements were performed at multiple levels to obtain more accurate results. As R.J. MacKay and R.W. Oldford remarked in their article, &#x27;It is clear that Michelson appreciated the power of averaging to reduce variability in measurement&#x27;, it is clear that Michelson had in mind the property that averages vary less which should be formally described as: the standard deviation of the average of &quot;n&quot; independent random variables is less than that of a single random variable by a factor of the square root of &quot;n&quot;. To realize that, he also strived to have each measurement not influencing each other, thus being mutually independent random variables.

A statistical model for repeated measurements with the assumption of independence or identical distributions is unrealistic. In the case of light speed study, each measurement is approached as the sum of quantity of interest and measurement error. In the absence of systematic error, the measurement error of speed of light can be modeled by a random sample from a distribution with unknown expectation and finite variance; thus, the speed of light is represented by the expectation of the model distribution and the ultimate goal is to estimate the expectation of the model distribution on the acquired dataset. The law of large numbers suggests to estimate the expectation by the sample mean.

=== Michelson–Morley interferometry experiment ===
In 1887 he collaborated with colleague Edward Williams Morley of Western Reserve University, now part of Case Western Reserve University, in the Michelson–Morley experiment. Their experiment for the expected motion of the Earth relative to the aether, the hypothetical medium in which light was supposed to travel, resulted in a null result. Surprised, Michelson repeated the experiment with greater and greater precision over the next years, but continued to find no ability to measure the aether. The Michelson–Morley results were immensely influential in the physics community, leading Hendrik Lorentz to devise his now-famous Lorentz contraction equations as a means of explaining the null result.

There has been some historical controversy over whether Albert Einstein was aware of the Michelson–Morley results when he developed his theory of special relativity, which pronounced the aether to be &quot;superfluous&quot;. In a later interview, Einstein said of the Michelson–Morley experiment, &quot;I was not conscious it had influenced me directly ... I guess I just took it for granted that it was true.&quot; Regardless of Einstein&#x27;s specific knowledge, the experiment is today considered the canonical experiment in regards to showing the lack of a detectable aether.

The precision of their equipment allowed Michelson and Morley to be the first to get precise values for the fine structure in the atomic spectral lines for which in 1916 Arnold Sommerfeld gave a theoretical explanation, introducing the fine-structure constant.

== Astronomical interferometry ==
=== Optical ===

In 1920 Michelson and Francis G. Pease made the first measurement of the diameter of a star other than the Sun. Michelson had invented astronomical interferometry and built such an instrument at the Mount Wilson Observatory which was used to measure the diameter of the red giant Betelgeuse. A periscope arrangement was used to direct light from two subpupils, separated by up to 20 feet (6m), into the main pupil of the 100 inch (2.5m) Hooker Telescope, producing interference fringes observed through the eyepiece. The measurement of stellar diameters and the separations of binary stars took up an increasing amount of Michelson&#x27;s life after this.

Beginning in the 1970s, astronomical interferometry was revived, with the configurations using two (or more) separate apertures (with diameters small compared to their separation) being often referred to as &quot;Michelson Stellar Interferometry&quot;. This was to distinguish it from speckle interferometry, but should not be confused with the Michelson interferometer which is one common &quot;laboratory&quot; interferometer configuration of which the interferometer used in the Michelson–Morley experiment was an instance. Michelson&#x27;s concept of interfering light from two relatively small apertures separated by a substantial distance (but with that distance, or &quot;baseline&quot;, now often as long as hundreds of meters) is employed at modern operational observatories such as VLTI, CHARA and the U.S. Navy&#x27;s NPOI.

=== Gravitational wave ===
Gravitational waves are detected using a Michelson interferometer with a laser light source. In 2020 there were three Michelson interferometer gravitational wave detectors operational, and a fourth under construction. These Michelson interferometers have arms 4 kilometers in length, set at 90 degree angles to each other, with the light passing through 1 m diameter vacuum tubes running their entire length. A passing gravitational wave will slightly stretch one arm as it shortens the other. This is precisely the motion to which these Michelson interferometers are most sensitive. As of 2020 fifteen gravitational wave events had been observed using these Michelson interferometers.

== Harmonic analyzer ==

In the 1890s Michelson built a mechanical device called the harmonic analyzer, for computing coefficients of Fourier series and drawing graphs of their partial sums. He and S. W. Stratton published a paper about this machine in the &quot;American Journal of Science&quot; in 1898.

== Michelson in popular culture ==

In Season 3 Episode 26 of the television series &quot;Bonanza&quot; (&quot;Look to the Stars&quot;, broadcast March 18, 1962), Ben Cartwright (Lorne Greene) helps the 16-year-old Michelson (portrayed by 25-year-old Douglas Lambert (1936–1986)) obtain an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy, despite the opposition of the bigoted town schoolteacher (played by William Schallert). &quot;Bonanza&quot; was set in and around Virginia City, Nevada, where Michelson lived with his parents prior to leaving for the Naval Academy. In a voice-over at the end of the episode, Greene mentions Michelson&#x27;s 1907 Nobel Prize.

The home in which Michelson lived as a child in Murphys Camp, California, was in the store of his father, first on Main Street, across from the Sperry &amp; Perry Hotel, and after the 1859 fire in a store next to the hotel. His aunt Bertha Meyers owned a house on Main Street toward the east end of town and Michelson probably visited her family there frequently.

New Beast Theater Works in collaboration with High Concept Laboratories produced a &#x27;semi-opera&#x27; about Michelson, his obsessive working style and its effect on his family life. The production ran from February 11 to February 26, 2011, in Chicago at The Building Stage. Michelson was portrayed by Jon Stutzman. The play was directed by David Maral with music composed by Joshua Dumas.

Norman Fitzroy Maclean wrote an essay &quot;Billiards Is a Good Game&quot;; published in &quot;The Norman Maclean Reader&quot; (ed. O. Alan Weltzien, 2008), it is an appreciation of Michelson from Maclean&#x27;s vantage point as a graduate student regularly watching him play billiards.

<doc id="92734" wikidata="Q223288" url="?curid=92734" title="Tenerife airport disaster">
<text>The Tenerife airport disaster occurred on 27 March 1977, when two Boeing 747 passenger jets collided on the runway at Los Rodeos Airport (now Tenerife North Airport) on the Spanish island of Tenerife. The Incident occurred at 5:06 pm WET (UTC+0) in dense fog, when KLM Flight 4805 initiated its takeoff run, colliding with the right side of Pan Am Flight 1736 still on the runway. The impact and the resulting fire killed all 248 people on board the KLM plane and 335 of the 396 people on board the Pan Am plane, with only 61 survivors in the front section of the latter aircraft. With a total of 583 fatalities, the disaster is the deadliest accident in aviation history.

The two aircraft had landed at Los Rodeos earlier that Sunday, and were among a number of aircraft diverted to Los Rodeos due to a bomb explosion at their intended destination of Gran Canaria Airport. The airport had become congested with parked airplanes blocking the only taxiway, forcing departing aircraft to taxi on the runway. Patches of thick fog were drifting across the airfield, so visibility was greatly reduced for pilots and the control tower.

The subsequent investigation by Spanish authorities concluded that the primary cause of the accident was the KLM captain&#x27;s decision to take off in the mistaken belief that a takeoff clearance from air traffic control (ATC) had been issued. Dutch investigators placed a greater emphasis on a mutual misunderstanding in radio communications between the KLM crew and ATC, but ultimately KLM admitted that their crew was responsible for the accident and the airline agreed to financially compensate the relatives of all of the victims.

The disaster had a lasting influence on the industry, highlighting in particular the vital importance of using standard phraseology in radio communications. Cockpit procedures were also reviewed, contributing to the establishment of crew resource management as a fundamental part of airline pilots&#x27; training. The captain is no longer considered infallible, and combined crew input is encouraged during aircraft operations.

== Flight history ==
Tenerife was an unscheduled stop for both flights. Their destination was Gran Canaria Airport (also known as Las Palmas Airport or Gando Airport), serving Las Palmas on the nearby island of Gran Canaria.

=== KLM Flight 4805 ===

KLM Flight 4805 was a charter flight for Holland International Travel Group and had arrived from Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Netherlands. Its cockpit crew consisted of Captain Jacob Veldhuyzen van Zanten (age 50), First Officer Klaas Meurs (42), and Flight Engineer Willem Schreuder (48). At the time of the accident, Veldhuyzen van Zanten was KLM&#x27;s chief flight instructor, with 11,700 flight hours, of which 1,545 hours were on the 747. Meurs had 9,200 flight hours, of which 95 hours were on the 747. Schreuder had 17,031 flight hours, of which 543 hours were on the 747.

The aircraft was a Boeing 747-206B, registration PH-BUF, named &quot;Rijn (Rhine)&quot;. The KLM jet was carrying 14 crew members and 235 passengers, including 52 children. Most of the KLM passengers were Dutch; also on board were four Germans, two Austrians, and two Americans. After the aircraft landed at Tenerife, the passengers were transported to the airport terminal. One of the inbound passengers, Robina van Lanschot, who lived on the island with her boyfriend, chose not to re-board the 747, leaving 234 passengers on board.

=== Pan Am Flight 1736 ===
Pan Am Flight 1736 had originated at Los Angeles International Airport, with an intermediate stop at New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). The aircraft was a Boeing 747-121, registration N736PA, named &quot;Clipper Victor&quot;. It was the first 747 to be delivered to an airline. Of the 380 passengers (mostly of retirement age but including two children), 14 had boarded in New York, where the crew was also changed. All but five passengers onboard the aircraft were Americans; the non-American passengers were all Canadian nationals.

The new crew consisted of Captain Victor Grubbs (age 56), First Officer Robert Bragg (39), Flight Engineer George Warns (46), and 13 flight attendants. At the time of the accident, Grubbs had 21,043 hours of flight time, of which 564 hours were on the 747. Bragg had 10,800 flight hours, of which 2,796 hours were on the 747. Warns had 15,210 flight hours, of which 559 hours were on the 747.

This particular aircraft had operated the inaugural 747 commercial flight on January 22, 1970. On August 2, 1970, in its first year of service, it also became the first 747 to be hijacked: en route between JFK and Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, it was diverted to José Martí International Airport in Havana, Cuba.

==Accident==
===Diversion of aircraft to Los Rodeos===

Both flights had been routine until they approached the islands. At 13:15, a bomb planted by the separatist Canary Islands Independence Movement exploded in the terminal of Gran Canaria Airport, injuring eight people. Due to the threat of a second bomb, the civil aviation authorities closed the airport temporarily after the initial explosion, and all incoming flights bound for Gran Canaria were diverted to Los Rodeos, including the two aircraft involved in the disaster. The Pan Am crew indicated that they would prefer to circle in a holding pattern until landing clearance was given (they had enough fuel to safely stay in the air for two more hours), but they were ordered to divert to Tenerife.

Los Rodeos was a regional airport that could not easily accommodate all of the traffic diverted from Gran Canaria, which included five large airliners. The airport had only one runway and one major taxiway running parallel to it, with four short taxiways connecting the two. While waiting for Gran Canaria airport to reopen, the diverted airplanes took up so much space that they had to park on the long taxiway, making it unavailable for the purpose of taxiing. Instead, departing aircraft needed to taxi along the runway to position themselves for takeoff, a procedure known as a backtaxi or backtrack.

The authorities reopened Gran Canaria airport once the bomb threat had been contained. The Pan Am plane was ready to depart from Tenerife, but access to the runway was obstructed by the KLM plane and a refueling vehicle; the KLM captain had decided to fully refuel at Los Rodeos instead of Las Palmas, apparently to save time. The Pan Am aircraft was unable to maneuver around the refueling KLM in order to reach the runway for takeoff, due to a lack of safe clearance between the two planes, which was just . The refueling took about 35 minutes, after which the passengers were brought back to the aircraft. The search for a missing Dutch family of four, who had not returned to the waiting KLM plane, delayed the flight even further. Additionally, Robina van Lanschot, a tour guide, had chosen not to reboard for the flight to Las Palmas, because she lived on Tenerife and thought it impractical to fly to Gran Canaria only to return to Tenerife the next day. She was therefore not on the KLM plane when the accident happened, and was the only survivor of those who flew from Amsterdam to Tenerife on Flight 4805.

=== Taxiing and takeoff preparations ===
The tower instructed the KLM plane to taxi down the entire length of the runway and then make a 180° turn to get into takeoff position. While the KLM was backtaxiing on the runway, the controller asked the flight crew to report when it was ready to copy the ATC clearance. Because the flight crew was performing the checklist, copying the clearance was postponed until the aircraft was in takeoff position.

Shortly afterward, the Pan Am was instructed to follow the KLM down the same runway, exit it by taking the third exit on their left and then use the parallel taxiway. Initially, the crew was unclear as to whether the controller had told them to take the first or third exit. The crew asked for clarification and the controller responded emphatically by replying: &quot;The third one, sir; one, two, three; third, third one.&quot; The crew began the taxi and proceeded to identify the unmarked taxiways using an airport diagram as they reached them.

The crew successfully identified the first two taxiways (C1 and C2), but their discussion in the cockpit indicated that they had not sighted the third taxiway (C3), which they had been instructed to use. There were no markings or signs to identify the runway exits and they were in conditions of poor visibility. The Pan Am crew appeared to remain unsure of their position on the runway until the collision, which occurred near the intersection with the fourth taxiway (C4).

The angle of the third taxiway would have required the plane to perform a 148° turn, which would lead back toward the still-crowded main apron. At the end of C3, the Pan Am would have to make another 148° turn, in order to continue taxiing towards the start of the runway, similar to a mirrored letter Z. Taxiway C4 would have required two 35° turns. A study carried out by the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) after the accident concluded that making the second 148° turn at the end of taxiway C3 would have been &quot;a practical impossibility&quot;. The official report from the Spanish authorities explained that the controller instructed the Pan Am aircraft to use the third taxiway because this was the earliest exit that they could take to reach the unobstructed section of the parallel taxiway. These instructions issued by the airport controllers indicated their lack of familiarity with the difficulty of handling large aircraft such as the 747.

=== Weather conditions at Los Rodeos ===
Los Rodeos airport is at above sea level, which gives rise to weather conditions that differ from those at many other airports. Clouds at above ground level at the nearby coast are at ground level at Los Rodeos. Drifting clouds of different densities cause wildly varying visibilities, from unhindered at one moment to below the legal minimum the next. The collision took place in a high-density cloud.

The Pan Am crew found themselves in poor and rapidly deteriorating visibility almost as soon as they entered the runway. According to the ALPA report, as the Pan Am aircraft taxied to the runway, the visibility was about . Shortly after they turned onto the runway it decreased to less than .

Meanwhile, the KLM plane was still in good visibility, but with clouds blowing down the runway towards them. The aircraft completed its 180-degree turn in relatively clear weather and lined up on Runway 30. The next cloud was down the runway and moving towards the aircraft at about .

=== Communication misunderstandings ===
Immediately after lining up, the KLM captain advanced the throttles and the aircraft started to move forward. Meurs advised him that ATC clearance had not yet been given and Veldhuyzen van Zanten responded: &quot;No, I know that. Go ahead, ask.&quot; Meurs then radioed the tower that they were &quot;ready for takeoff&quot; and &quot;waiting for our ATC clearance&quot;. ATC radioed the KLM aircraft (addressing them by the wrong call sign, although the KLM still interpreted the transmission as theirs), providing instructions that specified the route that the aircraft was to follow after takeoff, but did not clear them for takeoff. To add to the confusion, the controller had used the word &quot;takeoff&quot; in his clearance, potentially convincing Veldhuyzen van Zanten that a takeoff clearance had been issued.

Meurs read the flight clearance back to the controller, completing the readback with the statement &quot;We are now at takeoff&quot;, although it is still not known whether &quot;We are at takeoff&quot; or &quot;We are taking off&quot; was said. Veldhuyzen van Zanten interrupted the first officer&#x27;s readback with the comment &quot;We&#x27;re going.&quot;

The controller, who could not see the runway due to the fog and did not have any ground radar to use at the airport, initially responded with &quot;OK&quot; (terminology that is nonstandard), which reinforced the KLM captain&#x27;s misinterpretation that they had takeoff clearance. The controller&#x27;s response of &quot;OK&quot; to the first officer&#x27;s nonstandard statement that they were &quot;now at takeoff&quot; was likely due to his misinterpretation that they were in takeoff position and ready to begin the roll when takeoff clearance was received, but not in the process of taking off. The controller then immediately added, &quot;Stand by for takeoff; I will call you&quot;, indicating that he had not intended the instruction to be interpreted as a takeoff clearance.

A simultaneous radio call from the Pan Am crew caused mutual interference on the radio frequency, which was audible in the KLM cockpit as a three-second-long shrill sound (or heterodyne). This caused the KLM crew to miss the crucial latter portion of the tower&#x27;s response. The Pan Am crew&#x27;s transmission was &quot;We&#x27;re still taxiing down the runway, Clipper 1736!&quot; This message was also blocked by the interference and inaudible to the KLM crew. Either message, if heard in the KLM cockpit, would have alerted the crew to the situation and given them time to abort the takeoff attempt.

Due to the fog, neither crew was able to see the other plane on the runway ahead of them. In addition, neither of the aircraft could be seen from the control tower, as the airport was not equipped with ground radar.

After the KLM plane had started its takeoff roll, the tower instructed the Pan Am crew to &quot;report the runway clear.&quot; The Pan Am crew replied, &quot;OK, will report when we&#x27;re clear.&quot; Upon hearing this, the KLM flight engineer expressed his concern about the Pan Am not being clear of the runway by asking the pilots in his own cockpit, saying &quot;Is he not clear, that Pan American?&quot; Veldhuyzen van Zanten emphatically replied, &quot;Oh, yes&quot;, and continued with the takeoff.

=== Collision ===
According to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), the Pan Am captain said, &quot;There he is!&quot; when he spotted the KLM&#x27;s landing lights through the fog just as his plane approached exit C4. When it became clear that the KLM aircraft was approaching at takeoff speed, Captain Grubbs exclaimed, &quot;Goddamn, that son-of-a-bitch is coming!&quot;, while first officer Robert Bragg yelled, &quot;Get off! Get off! Get off!&quot; Grubbs applied full power to the throttles and made a sharp left turn towards the grass in an attempt to avoid the impending collision. 

By the time the KLM pilots saw the Pan Am aircraft, they had already exceeded their V1 speed and were moving too fast to stop. In desperation, the pilots prematurely rotated the aircraft nose upward and attempted to clear the Pan Am by lifting off, causing a tailstrike. The KLM 747 was within of the Pan Am and moving at approximately when it left the ground. Its nose landing gear cleared the Pan Am, but its left-side engines, lower fuselage, and main landing gear struck the upper right side of the Pan Am&#x27;s fuselage, ripping apart the center of the Pan Am jet almost directly above the wing. The right-side engines crashed through the Pan Am&#x27;s upper deck immediately behind the cockpit, instantly killing all of the passengers seated there.

The KLM plane remained briefly airborne, but the impact had sheared off the outer left engine, caused significant amounts of shredded materials to be ingested by the inner left engine, and damaged the wings. The plane immediately went into a stall, rolled sharply, and hit the ground approximately past the collision, sliding down the runway for a further . Upon impact with the runway, the full load of fuel, which had caused the earlier delay, ignited immediately into a fireball that could not be subdued for several hours. One of the 61 survivors of the Pan Am flight said that sitting in the nose of the plane probably saved his life: &quot;We all settled back, and the next thing an explosion took place and the whole port side, left side of the plane, was just torn wide open.&quot;

Veldhuyzen van Zanten was KLM&#x27;s chief of flight training and one of their most senior pilots. About two months before the accident, he had conducted the Boeing 747 qualification check on the first officer of Flight 4805. His photograph was used for publicity materials such as magazine advertisements, including the inflight magazine on board PH-BUF. KLM had suggested initially that Veldhuyzen van Zanten should help with the investigation, unaware that he was the captain who had been killed in the accident.

== Victims ==

Both airplanes were destroyed in the collision. All 248 passengers and crew aboard the KLM plane died, as did 335 passengers and crew aboard the Pan Am plane, primarily due to the fire and explosions resulting from the fuel spilled and ignited in the impact. The other 61 passengers and crew aboard the Pan Am aircraft survived. There were initially 70 survivors, but 9 passengers later died of their injuries. Among the survivors were the captain, first officer and flight engineer. Most of the survivors on the Pan Am plane walked out onto the intact left wing, the side away from the collision, through holes in the fuselage structure. 

The Pan Am&#x27;s engines were still running for a few minutes after the accident despite first officer Bragg&#x27;s intention to turn them off. The roof of the cockpit, where the engine switches were located, had been destroyed in the collision, and all control lines were severed, leaving no means for the flight crew to control the aircraft&#x27;s systems, including engine fire extinguishers. Survivors waited for rescue, but it did not come promptly, as the firefighters were initially unaware that there were two aircraft involved and were concentrating on the KLM wreck hundreds of metres away in the thick fog and smoke. Eventually, most of the survivors on the wing dropped to the ground below.

The PanAm flight fatalities included 53 travelers from Orange County, California, mostly retirees on package tours.

=== Notable fatalities ===
*Jacob Veldhuyzen van Zanten, chief flight instructor for KLM and the captain of the KLM flight.
*Eve Meyer, a pin-up model, film actress and producer and second wife of film director Russ Meyer, was on the Pan Am flight.
*A. P. Hamann, the former city manager of San Jose, California, was on the Pan Am flight.

== Aftermath ==
The following day, the Canary Islands Independence Movement, responsible for the bombing at Gran Canaria that started the chain of events that led to the disaster, denied responsibility for the accident.

Los Rodeos Airport was closed to all fixed-wing traffic for two days. The first crash investigators to arrive at Tenerife the day after the crash travelled there by way of a 3-hour boat ride from Las Palmas. The first aircraft that was able to land was a U.S. Air Force C-130 transport, which landed on the airport&#x27;s main taxiway at 12:50 on March 29. The C-130 was arranged by Lt. Col Dr. James K. Slaton, who arrived before the crash investigators and started a triage of surviving passengers. Slaton was dispatched from Torrejon Air Base just outside of Madrid, Spain. Slaton, a flight surgeon attached to the 613th Tactical Fighter Squadron, worked with local medical staff and remained on scene until the last survivor was airlifted to awaiting medical facilities. The C-130 transported all surviving and injured passengers from Tenerife airport to Las Palmas; many of the injured were taken from there to other Air Force bases in the U.S. for further treatment.

Spanish Army soldiers were tasked with clearing crash wreckage from the runways and taxiways. By March 30, a small plane shuttle service was approved, but large jets still could not land. Los Rodeos was fully reopened on April 3, after wreckage had been removed from the runway and engineers had repaired it.

== Investigation ==

The accident was investigated by Spain&#x27;s Civil Aviation Accident and Incident Investigation Commission (CIAIAC). About 70 personnel were involved in the investigation, including representatives from the United States, the Netherlands and the two airline companies. Facts showed that there had been misinterpretations and false assumptions before the accident. Analysis of the CVR transcript showed that the KLM captain thought that he had been cleared for takeoff, while the Tenerife control tower believed that the KLM 747 was stationary at the end of the runway, awaiting takeoff clearance.

=== Probable cause ===
The investigation concluded that the fundamental cause of the accident was that Veldhuyzen van Zanten attempted to take off without clearance. The investigators suggested the reason for this was a desire to leave as soon as possible in order to comply with KLM&#x27;s duty-time regulations (which were put in place earlier that year) and before the weather deteriorated further.

Other major factors contributing to the accident were:
* The sudden fog greatly limited visibility and the control tower and the crews of both planes were unable to see one another.
* Interference from simultaneous radio transmissions made hearing messages difficult.

The following factors were considered contributing but not critical:
* The use of ambiguous non-standard phrases by the KLM first officer (&quot;We&#x27;re at take off&quot;) and the Tenerife control tower (&quot;OK&quot;).
* The Pan Am aircraft did not leave the runway at the third exit as instructed.
* The airport was forced to accommodate a great number of large aircraft rerouted by the terrorist incident, disrupting the normal use of taxiways.

=== Dutch response ===

The Dutch authorities were reluctant to accept the Spanish report blaming the KLM captain for the accident. The Netherlands Department of Civil Aviation published a response that, while accepting that the KLM captain had taken off &quot;prematurely&quot;, argued that he alone should not be blamed for the &quot;mutual misunderstanding&quot; that occurred between the controller and the KLM crew, and that limitations of using radio as a means of communication should have been given greater consideration.

In particular, the Dutch response pointed out that:
* The crowded airport had placed additional pressure on all parties, including the KLM cockpit crew, the Pan Am cockpit crew, and the controller;
* Sounds on the CVR suggested that during the accident the Spanish control tower crew had been listening to a football match on the radio and may have been distracted;
* The transmission from the tower in which the controller passed KLM their ATC clearance was ambiguous and could have been interpreted as also giving take-off clearance. In support of this part of their response, the Dutch investigators pointed out that Pan Am&#x27;s messages &quot;No! Eh?&quot; and &quot;We are still taxiing down the runway, the Clipper 1736!&quot; indicated that Grubbs and Bragg had recognized the ambiguity (this message was not audible to the control tower or KLM crew due to simultaneous cross-communication);
* The Pan Am had taxied beyond the third exit. Had the plane turned at the third exit as instructed, the collision would not have occurred.

Although the Dutch authorities were initially reluctant to blame Veldhuyzen van Zanten and his crew, the airline ultimately accepted responsibility for the accident. KLM paid the victims&#x27; families compensation ranging between $58,000 and $600,000 (or $ to $ million today, adjusted for inflation). The sum of settlements for property and damages was $110 million (or $ million today), an average of $189,000 (or $ today) per victim, due to limitations imposed by European Compensation Conventions in effect at the time.

=== Speculations ===
This was one of the first accident investigations to include a study into the contribution of &quot;human factors&quot;. These included:
* Veldhuyzen van Zanten, a KLM training captain and instructor for over ten years working on simulators regularly, had not flown on regular routes for twelve weeks prior to the accident.
* The KLM flight crew, including Veldhuyzen van Zanten, were concerned about exceeding their maximum legally allowable on-duty hours for the day, which Dutch law had recently tightened. This influenced Veldhuyzen van Zanten&#x27;s decision to refuel at Tenerife for the flight to Amsterdam after as brief a stop as possible at Las Palmas.
* The apparent hesitation of the flight engineer and the first officer to challenge Veldhuyzen van Zanten further. The official investigation suggested that this might have been due to not only the captain&#x27;s seniority in rank but also his being one of the most respected pilots working for the airline. This view is questioned by Jan Bartelski, a former KLM captain and the president of the International Federation of Air Line Pilots&#x27; Associations (IFALPA), who knew both officers and believes this explanation to be inconsistent with his knowledge of their personalities. The first officer had intervened when Veldhuyzen van Zanten first opened the throttles, but had then failed to do so on the second occasion. Even though the flight engineer had indeed asked the captain whether or not the Pan Am was clear of the runway, he seemed reassured by the captain&#x27;s answer. The co-pilots had clearly challenged the captain&#x27;s decisions, but were not insistent enough to convince him to abort the attempted takeoff.
* The flight engineer was the only member of the KLM&#x27;s flight crew to react to the control tower&#x27;s instruction to &quot;report the runway clear&quot;; this might have been due to his having completed his pre-flight checks, whereas his colleagues were experiencing an increased workload, just as the visibility worsened. 
* The ALPA study group concluded that the KLM crew did not realize that the transmission &quot;Papa Alpha One Seven Three Six, report the runway clear&quot; was directed at the Pan Am, because this was the first and only time the Pan Am was referred to by that name. Previously, the Pan Am had been called &quot;Clipper One Seven Three Six&quot;, using its proper call-sign.

The extra fuel taken on by the KLM added several factors:
* Takeoff was delayed by an extra 35 minutes, allowing time for the fog to settle in;
* More than 45 tonnes of additional weight was added to the aircraft, increasing the takeoff distance and making it more difficult to clear the Pan Am when taking off;
* The increased severity of the fire caused by the additional fuel led ultimately to the deaths of all those on board.

== Legacy ==

As a consequence of the accident, sweeping changes were made to international airline regulations and to aircraft. Aviation authorities around the world introduced requirements for standard phrases and a greater emphasis on English as a common working language.

Air traffic instruction must not be acknowledged solely with a colloquial phrase such as &quot;OK&quot; or even &quot;Roger&quot; (which simply means the last transmission was received), but with a readback of the key parts of the instruction, to show mutual understanding. The word &quot;takeoff&quot; is now spoken only when the actual takeoff clearance is given, or when canceling that same clearance (i.e., &quot;cleared for takeoff&quot; or &quot;cancel takeoff clearance&quot;). Until that point, aircrew and controllers should use the word &quot;departure&quot; in its place (e.g., &quot;ready for departure&quot;). Additionally, an ATC clearance given to an aircraft already lined-up on the runway must be prefixed with the instruction &quot;hold position&quot;.

Cockpit procedures were also changed after the accident. Hierarchical relations among crew members were played down, and greater emphasis was placed on team decision-making by mutual agreement. Less experienced flight crew members were encouraged to challenge their captains when they believed something to be incorrect, and captains were instructed to listen to their crew and evaluate all decisions in light of crew concerns. This course of action was later expanded into what is known today as crew resource management (CRM), which states that all pilots, no matter how experienced they are, are allowed to contradict each other. This was a problem in the crash when the Flight Engineer asked if they were not clear, but Veldhuyzen van Zanten (with over 11,000 hours flown) said that they were obviously clear and the Flight Engineer decided that it was best not to contradict the captain. CRM training has been mandatory for all airline pilots since 2006.

In 1978, a second airport was opened on the island of Tenerife, the new Tenerife South Airport (TFS), which now serves the majority of international tourist flights. Los Rodeos, renamed Tenerife North Airport (TFN), was then used only for domestic and inter-island flights until 2002, when a new terminal was opened and Tenerife North began to carry international traffic again.

The Spanish government installed a ground radar system at Tenerife North Airport following the accident.

== Memorials ==
A Dutch national memorial and final resting place for the victims of the KLM plane is located in Amsterdam, at Westgaarde cemetery. There is also a memorial at the Westminster Memorial Park and Mortuary in Westminster, California, US.

In 1977, a cross in Rancho Bernardo, San Diego, California was dedicated to 19 area residents who died in the disaster.

In 2007, the 30th anniversary marked the first time that Dutch and American next-of-kin and aid helpers from Tenerife joined an international commemoration service, held at the Auditorio de Tenerife in Santa Cruz. The International Tenerife Memorial March 27, 1977 was inaugurated at the Mesa Mota on March 27, 2007. The monument was designed by Dutch sculptor Rudi van de Wint (1942–2006).

== Documentaries ==
The disaster has been featured in many TV shows, podcasts and documentaries. These include:
* Episode 1 of &quot;Survival in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Blaming the Pilot&quot; (1996).
* Episode 12 of &quot;Seconds From Disaster&quot;, &quot;Collision on the Runway&quot; (2004).
* Episode 625 of PBS&#x27;s &quot;NOVA&quot;, &quot;The Deadliest Plane Crash&quot; (2006).
* The PBS special &quot;Surviving Disaster: How the Brain Works Under Extreme Duress&quot; (2011), which was based on Amanda Ripley&#x27;s book &quot;The Unthinkable: Who Survives When Disaster Strikes - and Why&quot;.
* An episode of &quot;Destroyed in Seconds&quot;.
* Episode 133 (S16E03) of the Canadian TV series &quot;Mayday&quot; (known by different names in different countries), &quot;Disaster at Tenerife&quot; (2016), as well as the earlier in-depth 90-minute special &quot;Crash of the Century&quot; (2005).
* Footage of the wreckage appears in the disaster documentary &quot;Days of Fury&quot; (1979), directed by Fred Warshofsky.
* Episode 5 of the Nebula series &quot;Under Exposure&quot; (2023) by Neo.
* Series 5 episodes 1 and 2 of the &quot;Cautionary Tales&quot; podcast (2025) by Pushkin Industries, hosted by Tim Harford.

<doc id="92737" wikidata="Q1129448" url="?curid=92737" title="Preamble">
<text>A preamble () is an introductory and expressionary statement in a document that explains the document&#x27;s purpose and underlying philosophy. When applied to the opening paragraphs of a statute, it may recite historical facts pertinent to the subject of the statute. It is distinct from the long title or enacting formula of a law.

In parliamentary procedure using Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order, a preamble consists of &quot;Whereas&quot; clauses that are placed before the resolving clauses in a resolution (formal written motion). However, preambles are not required to be placed in resolutions. According to Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order, including such background information may not be helpful in passing the resolution.

==Legal effect==
While preambles may be regarded as unimportant introductory matter, their words may have effects that may not have been foreseen by their drafters.

===France===

In France, the preamble to the constitution of the Fifth Republic of 1958 was considered ancillary and therefore non-binding until a major jurisprudential reversal by the Constitutional Council in the . This decision, which began with the words &quot;Having regard to the constitution and its preamble,&quot; effected a considerable change in French constitutional law, as the preamble and the texts it referred to, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789 and the preamble to the constitution of the Fourth Republic, took their place alongside the constitution proper as texts understood as being invested with constitutional value. The Charter of the Environment of 2004 was later appended to the preamble, and the Constitutional Council identified three informal categories consisting of the fundamental principles recognized by the laws of the Republic, the , and the .

===Canada===
In Canada, the preamble to the Constitution Act, 1867 was cited by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Provincial Judges Reference, to increase guarantees to judicial independence. The Bosnian Constitutional Court, particularly citing the case law of the Supreme Court of Canada, also declared that the provisions of the preamble of the Bosnian Constitution are invested with a normative force thereby serving as a sound standard of judicial review for the Constitutional Court.

===European Union===
Due to concern over its potential effects, the draft preamble of the proposed European Constitution, in 2002, caused much controversy because of the possible inclusion of a reference to the Christian heritage of Europe. 

===Australia===
Likewise, in Australia in 1999, a referendum on whether to adopt a new preamble was accompanied by a promise that the preamble, if adopted, could not be enforceable by the courts, as some were worried with how the preamble could be interpreted and applied.

===India===

The Preamble to the Constitution of the Republic of India is based on the Objectives Resolution, which was moved in the Constituent Assembly by Jawaharlal Nehru on 13 December 1946 accepted on 22 January 1947 and adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 26 November 1949, coming into force on 26 January 1950, celebrated as the Republic Day of India, and was initially drafted by Jawaharlal Nehru. In India, the Supreme Court frequently rules unconstitutional amendments which violate the Basic Structure of the Constitution, especially its Preamble.

<text>The Omotic languages are a group of languages spoken in southwestern Ethiopia, in the Omo River region and southeastern Sudan in Blue Nile State. The Geʽez script is used to write some of the Omotic languages, the Latin script for some others. They are fairly agglutinative and have complex tonal systems (for example, the Bench language). The languages have around 7.9 million speakers.
The group is generally classified as belonging to the Afroasiatic language family, but this is disputed by some linguists.

Four separate &quot;Omotic&quot; groups are accepted by &quot;Glottolog&quot; 4.0 and Güldemann (2018): North Omotic, Dizoid (Maji), Mao, and Aroid (&quot;South Omotic&quot;).

==Languages==

The North and South Omotic branches (&quot;Nomotic&quot; and &quot;Somotic&quot;) are universally recognized, with some dispute as to the composition of North Omotic. The primary debate is over the placement of the Mao languages. Bender (2000) classifies Omotic languages as follows:
*Omotic
**South Omotic / Aroid (Hamer-Banna, Aari, Dime, Karo)
**North Omotic / Non-Aroid
***Mao
****Bambassi
****West Mao (Hozo, Seze, Ganza)
***Dizoid (Dizi, Sheko, Nayi)
***Gonga–Gimojan
****Gonga/Kefoid (Boro, Anfillo, Kafa, Shekkacho)
****Gimojan
*****&quot;Yemsa&quot;
*****Ometo–Gimira
******&quot;Bench&quot;
******&quot;Chara&quot;
******Ometo languages
Apart from terminology, this differs from Fleming (1976) in including the Mao languages, whose affiliation had originally been controversial, and in abolishing the &quot;Gimojan&quot; group. There are also differences in the subclassification of Ometo, which is not covered here.

===Hayward (2003)===
Hayward (2003) separates out the Mao languages as a third branch of Omotic and breaks up Ometo–Gimira:
*Omotic
**South Omotic
**Mao
**North Omotic
***Dizoid
***Ta–Ne languages
****Gonga
****Gimojan
*****&quot;Yemsa&quot;
*****&quot;Bench&quot;
*****Ometo–Chara
===Blench (2006)===
Blench (2006) gives a more agnostic classification:
*Omotic
**South Omotic
**North Omotic
***Mao
***Dizoid
***Gonga (Kefoid)
***&quot;Yem&quot;
***Gimira
***Ometo (?Chara)
Bosha† is unclassified; &quot;Ethnologue&quot; lists it as a dialect of Kafa but notes it may be a distinct language.

==Classification==
Omotic is generally considered the most divergent branch of the Afroasiatic languages. In early work up to Greenberg (1963), the languages had been classified in a subgroup of Cushitic, called most often &quot;West Cushitic&quot;. Fleming (1969) argued that it should instead be classified as an independent branch of Afroasiatic, a view which Bender (1971) established to most linguists&#x27; satisfaction, though a few linguists maintain the West Cushitic position or that only South Omotic forms a separate branch, with North Omotic remaining part of Cushitic. Blench notes that Omotic shares honey-related vocabulary with Cushitic but not cattle-related vocabulary, suggesting that the split occurred before the advent of pastoralism. A few scholars have raised doubts that the Omotic languages are part of the Afroasiatic language family at all, and Theil (2006) proposes that Omotic be treated as an independent family. However, the general consensus, based primarily on morphological evidence, such as pronominal prefixes, grammatical number and plural form, as well as prefix conjugation is that membership in Afroasiatic is well established.

The Aroid (South Omotic) languages were first included in &quot;West Cushitic&quot; by Greenberg; they were excluded from earlier classifications by Italian Cushiticists such as Enrico Cerulli and Mario Martino Moreno, and their inclusion in Omotic remains contested.

===&quot;Glottolog&quot;===
Hammarström, et al. in &quot;Glottolog&quot; does not consider Omotic to be a unified group, and also does not consider any of the &quot;Omotic&quot; groups to be part of the Afroasiatic phylum. &quot;Glottolog&quot; accepts the following as independent language families.

*Ta-Ne-Omotic
*Dizoid (Maji)
*Mao
*Aroid (Ari-Banna; &quot;South Omotic&quot;)

These four families are also accepted by Güldemann (2018), who similarly doubts the validity of Omotic as a unified group.

==Characteristics==
===General===
The Omotic languages have a morphology that is partly agglutinative and partly fusional:
* Agglutinating: Yem &quot;am-se-f-∅-à&quot; go+plural+present+3. Person+Femininum “they go”
* Fusional: Aari &quot;ʔíts-eka&quot; eat+3. Person Pl. Converb “by eating”
Inflection through suprasegmental morphemes is found in individual languages such as Dizi and Bench; Historically, these are partly reflexes of affixes: 
* Bench &quot;sum˩&quot; &quot;name&quot;, &quot;sum-s˦&quot; &quot;to name&quot;
The nominal morphology is based on a nominative-accusative-absolutive system; For verbal morphology, a complex inflection according to categories such as tense/aspect, interrogative - declarative and affirmative - negative as well as agreement is more predicative characterizing forms with the subject. In syntax, the word order subject-object-verb (SOV) is generally valid; Postpositions are used, which can be considered typical for both SOV languages in general and for the Ethiopian region.
===Phonology===
The Omotic languages have on average slightly less than thirty consonant phonemes, which is a comparatively high number, but is also found in other primary branches of Afro-Asiatic. Commonly used are bilabial, alveolar, velar and glottal plosive, various fricative, alveolar affricates and /w/, /y/, /l/, /r/, /m/, /n/. What is typical for the non-glottal plosives is that they are each represented by a voiced, a voiceless, and an ejective phoneme; All three types can also be found in fricatives and affricates. Most Omotic languages have additional consonants. Examples of this are the Implosive in South Omotic (/ɓ/, /ɗ/, /ɠ/) and the Retroflex of the Bench. In some cases, consonants can also occur geminated. Representatives of the Nordomotic and Mao have five to six vowel phonemes, the quantity is partly a difference in meaning; In contrast, much more extensive vowel systems are typical for South Omotic.

All Omotic languages for which sufficient data is available are tonal languages, which usually only distinguish two tones (high and low), some languages have more tones: Dizi distinguishes three, Bench six. Certain Omotic languages such as Aari and Ganza (Mao) have tonal accent systems in which each independent word has exactly one high tone, whereas in most languages the tones are freely distributed.

===Morphology===
====Nouns====
The Omotic languages distinguish between the nominal categories number, case, and definiteness. These categories are marked by different suffixes, which can be fusional or analytic depending on the language. The two genders in all omotic languages for which sufficient data are available are masculine and feminine; they essentially correspond to natural gender. The case system distinguishes the omotic languages as accusative languages; other cases form various adverbial determinations. A number of omotic languages have an absolutive case, which marks the citation form and the direct object (examples from Wolaita):
* Absolute &quot;keett-a&quot; &quot;the house&quot;
* Nominative &quot;keett-i&quot; &quot;the house&quot;
Some common case suffixes are:
* Nominative *-&quot;i&quot; (Gonga-Gimojan, Dizi-Sheko)
* Accusative *-&quot;m&quot; (South Domotic)
* Genitive *-&quot;kV&quot; (Gonga-Gimojan, Dizi-Sheko, Mao, Dime)
* Dative *-&quot;s&quot; (Gonga-Gimojan, Dizi-Sheko, Mao?)
A typological peculiarity, which is also isolated within Omotic, is the person and gender dependency of the nominative in Bench (either -&quot;i&quot;˧ or -&quot;a&quot;˧, depending on the person):
* &quot;a˦tsin˦-a˧&quot; “a woman” (3rd person sg. femininum)
* &quot;nun˧-a˧&quot; &quot;we&quot; (1st person plural exclusive)
* &quot;nas˦i˧&quot; “a man” (3rd person sg. masculine)

In most languages, the singular is unmarked, while the plural has its own suffix. It is possible that plural suffixes in some languages arose from a partitive construction. This is supported by the length of certain plural suffixes, formal relationships to the genitive singular and the fact that the determining suffix sometimes comes before the plural suffix, which is typologically unusual:
* Dizi &quot;kìan-à-kʾankàs&quot; dog+det.+plural “the dogs”
* Yem &quot;ʔasú-nì-kitó&quot; human+gene+plural “people”

====Pronouns====
The personal pronouns distinguish similar categories to the nouns in most omotic languages; However, the genera are usually only marked in the 3rd person singular. The personal pronouns usually have their own stem for each number-person-gender combination, to which case suffixes are then added, which are the same for all persons. Some of the pronouns show similarities with other Afro-Asian language families and can therefore be traced back to Proto-Afro-Asiatic; Certain South Omotic personal pronouns can be explained as borrowings from the neighboring Nilo-Saharan:

The case endings of the personal pronouns and the nouns are usually identical:
* Aari: Accusative -m: &quot;yé-m&quot; &quot;you&quot;, &quot;fatir-in-ám&quot; &quot;the corn&quot;
Possessive pronouns in particular have their own forms:
* Aari: &quot;yé&quot; &quot;yours,&quot; &quot;ʔéed-te&quot; &quot;a man&#x27;s&quot;

==Reconstruction==
Bender (1987: 33–35) reconstructs the following proto-forms for Proto-Omotic and Proto-North Omotic, the latter which is considered to have descended from Proto-Omotic.

<doc id="92742" wikidata="Q790468" url="?curid=92742" title="Baritone horn">
<text>The baritone horn, sometimes called baritone, is a low-pitched brass instrument in the saxhorn family. It is a piston-valve brass instrument with a bore that is mostly conical, like the smaller and higher pitched flugelhorn and tenor horn, but it has a narrower bore compared to the similarly pitched euphonium. It uses a wide-rimmed cup mouthpiece like that of its peers, the trombone and euphonium. Like the trombone and the euphonium, the baritone horn can be considered either a transposing or non-transposing instrument.

In the UK, the baritone horn is part of the standardised instrumentation of brass bands. In concert band music, there is often a part marked &quot;baritone&quot;, but these parts are most commonly intended for, and played on, the euphonium. A baritone can also play music written for a trombone due to similarities in timbre and range.

== Construction and general characteristics ==

The baritone, like the trombone and euphonium, is a nine-foot brass tube. Valves are most often piston-style. It is predominantly of conical bore, like the euphonium, but has a narrower bore than the euphonium. The smaller bore renders its attack more distinct than the rounder attack of the euphonium, and also provides it with a brighter sound than the dark-sounding euphonium.

===Key===
The baritone is pitched in concert B, meaning that when no valves are actuated, the instrument will produce partials of the B harmonic series. Music for the baritone horn can be written in either the bass clef or the treble clef. When written in the bass clef, the baritone horn is a non-transposing instrument. However, when written in the treble clef, it is often used as transposing instrument, transposing downward a major ninth from the music as written, so that written middle C for the baritone is concert B below low C (B2 in scientific pitch notation), with the fingerings thus matching those of the trumpet but sounding an octave lower. It is often used to play parts written for the similarly pitched tenor trombone or euphonium.

===Range===
The baritone is part of the tenor section of a band. Its second partial with no valves pressed is concert B on the second line from the bottom of the bass clef (B2 in scientific pitch notation). The eighth partial with no valves pressed is concert B in the center of the treble clef (B4). Virtuosi can reach certain pedal tones below the E2 second partial with all valves depressed, which is the nominal lowest note on the instrument, and several half-tones above the B4, which is the nominal top of the instrument&#x27;s range.

===Tone===
The baritone sounds with a timbre between the brightness of the trombone and the more mellow tone of the euphonium.

=== Distinguishing the baritone horn from the euphonium ===
Although both baritone horn and euphonium produce partials of the B harmonic series in the same range, and both have a nine-foot-long main tube, the baritone horn tends to have a smaller and more cylindrical bore than the euphonium which is more conical. The baritone horn usually has a tighter wrap and a smaller bell, and is thus smaller and lighter overall, and produces a &quot;lighter&quot; and more direct sound versus the more solid, round timbre of the euphonium.

There is a common misconception that the three-valve instrument is a baritone and that the four-valve instrument is a euphonium. Euphoniums often have a fourth valve as an alternate fingering for 1&amp;3 split fingering with improved intonation. The fourth valve can also be viewed in the same way as an F trigger on trombone, repitching the instrument to expand the lower range. A fourth valve is less common on baritones, but absence of a fourth valve is not a defining characteristic.

An &quot;American baritone&quot;, featuring three valves on the front of the instrument and a curved forward-pointing bell, was common in American school bands throughout most of the twentieth century. While this instrument is in reality a conical-cylindrical bore hybrid, neither truly euphonium nor baritone, it was almost universally labeled a &quot;baritone&quot; by both band directors and composers.

===Marching baritone horn===

Specially wrapped versions of the baritone horn have been created for use in marching bands and drum and bugle corps. They have three valves and a front-facing bell and are the tenor voice of a drum and bugle corps, below the soprano voice of the trumpet, the alto voice of alto horn or mellophone, and above the low tubas.

===Artists===
Notable artists who are today referenced as great baritone horn players include Ruth Mellor, Simone Mantia, Helen Harrelson, Katrina Marzella, and Leonard Falcone. The Leonard Falcone International Tuba and Euphonium Festival is a notable venue for aspiring artists on euphonium, but its namesake played baritone horn on his many recordings.

Trumpeter Maynard Ferguson used a baritone horn in the song &quot;Gospel John&quot; and in one of his three solos (the other two involving a valved trombone and a trumpet) in a live performance of his song &quot;Great Guns&quot;.

Japanese free-improvisation trumpeter Toshinori Kondo has played baritone horn on some dates and recordings (e.g., &quot;Jazz Bunker&quot;), as has saxophonist Ralph Carney (e.g., &quot;Night on Earth&quot;).

<doc id="92751" wikidata="Q3153799" url="?curid=92751" title="Inua">
<text>In Inuit mythology, an inua (ᐃᓄᐊ; plural inuat ᐃᓄᐊᑦ) is a spirit or soul that exists in all people, animals, lakes, mountains, and plants. This is not an individual soul, but rather &quot;the vital force representing a chain or continuum of all the individual spirits of that genus which had lived, were living, or were to live.&quot;

Among the Yup&#x27;ik near Kuskokwim Bay of Coastal Alaska, the word yua (absolutive case form of the word &quot;yuk&quot; &quot;human; human-like spirit&quot;) has similar connotations as that of the Iñupiaq of Northern Alaska, who, similarly to the Inuit, call it &quot;iñua&quot; or &quot;inua&quot;. This meaning is based in a common understanding of most Arctic peoples, including both the Yup&#x27;iak and Iñupiaq, that &quot;all the world is animate, and that animals have souls or spirits&quot;, a foundational belief of the continuum and inter-connectivity of all life and spirit of all that is, has been, and is yet to be. The concept is similar to mana.

Masks worn by shamans and non-shamanic dancers can represent animal spirits. Spirit masks represent the inua of the genus, not of an individual of that genus. A spirit mask of a seal, for example, represents an abstraction or communal essence of the spirit of all seals.

For Arctic people, human and animals are equal in that all life shares a common kind of soul or &quot;life essence&quot; (inua). This creates a predicament that, in order to survive, people must kill other creatures that are like them. Recognition of this dilemma lies at the centre of hunting practice, which is based upon respect and reciprocity. The hunter will only succeed if the animal chooses to give its life as a gift in return for moral and respectful behaviour on the part of the whole community. For example, after a seal has been killed fresh water is poured into its mouth so that its soul will not be thirsty and it will tell the other seals of the respect shown to it.

Inua were sometimes personified in mythology, as in Tarqiup Inua (&quot;Master of the Moon&quot;) or infrequently Silap Inua. Sila has a wide variety of meanings. Discussing the meaning of Silap Inua, sometimes translated as &quot;the owner of sila&quot; or possessor of spirit, it has been suggested that Silap Inua may more appropriately indicate animation by or participation in &quot;the Life-Giving Spirit.&quot;

<text>Sedna (, previously &quot;Sedna&quot; or &quot;Sidne&quot;) is the goddess of the sea and marine animals in Inuit religion, also known as the Mother of the Sea or Mistress of the Sea. The story of Sedna, which is a creation myth, describes how she came to rule over Adlivun, the Inuit equivalent of the underworld. In sculptures, Sedna is often depicted with the head and upper body of a woman and the tail of a marine mammal, similar to a mermaid.

==Other names==
Sedna is known as Arnakuagsak or Arnaqquassaaq in parts of Greenland. She is called Sassuma Arnaa (&#x27;Mother of the Deep&#x27;) in West Greenlandic and Nerrivik (&#x27;Table&#x27;, Inuktun) or Nuliajuk (Kivalliq Region, Nunavut, Canada). She is sometimes known by other names by different Inuit groups such as Arnapkapfaaluk (&#x27;Big Bad Woman&#x27;) of the Copper Inuit from the Coronation Gulf area and Takánakapsâluk or Takannaaluk (Igloolik). In Killiniq, Labrador, she was referred to as &#x27;Old-woman-who-lived-in-the-sea&#x27;.

==Myth==

More than one version of the Sedna legend exists. Some legends have her as the daughter of a goddess named Isarrataitsoq, while others only mention her father. 

In one legend Sedna is a giant, the daughter of the creator-god Anguta, with a great hunger that causes her to attack her parents. Angered, Anguta takes her out to sea and throws her over the side of his kayak. As she clings to the sides, he chops off her fingers and she sinks to the underworld, becoming the ruler of the monsters of the deep. Her huge fingers become the ringed seals, walruses, and whales hunted by Inuit.

In another version of the legend, she is dissatisfied with men found for her by her father and so marries a dog. Her father is so angry at this that he throws her into the sea and, when she tries to climb back into the boat, he cuts off her fingers. Her fingers become the first seals and she becomes a mighty sea goddess. When she is angered, the angakkuq (shaman) travels to wash and comb her hair for her, after which she is placated and releases the animals to the hunters. In other versions, she is unable to comb her hair because she lacks fingers, so a shaman must brush it for her.

In the Netsilik region, the story states that Nuliayuk was a mistreated orphan. One day the people tried to get rid of her by attempting to drown her by chopping off her fingertips, which transformed into seals and walruses. Eventually, Nuliayuk marries a sculpin and lives in the sea controlling all sea mammals.

Other versions of the legend depict Sedna as a beautiful maiden who rejects marriage proposals from the hunters of her village. When an unknown hunter appears, Sedna&#x27;s father agrees to give her to him as wife in return for fish. Sedna&#x27;s father gives Sedna a sleeping potion and gives her to the hunter who takes her to a large nest on a cliff, revealing his true form: a great bird-spirit (variously described as a raven, a fulmar or a Kokksaut / petrel-spirit). She wakes surrounded by birds. Her father attempts to rescue her, but the bird-spirit becomes angry, causing a great storm. In desperation, Sedna&#x27;s father throws her into the raging sea. Attempting to cling to the kayak, her hands freeze and her fingers fall off becoming the creatures of the sea. She falls to the bottom of the sea and grows a fishtail.

Sedna is kidnapped or deceived by a different bird creature in yet another version. Her father then leaves in his kayak to rescue her from the floating ice-island where she is imprisoned while the bird creature is away. The creature, enraged by her disappearance, calls to a spirit of the sea to help him. The sea spirit locates the kayak with the two humans aboard and creates huge waves to kill them. Her father throws Sedna overboard in the hope that this will appease the angry god. Sedna clings to the kayak but her father grabs a little ax and chops three of her fingers off before striking her on the head. The three fingers each become a different species of seal. The stroke to her head sends Sedna to the ocean floor where she resides, commanding the animals of the sea.

In an additional version of the story Sedna marries a man who claims to be a fantastic hunter. He then takes her away to a distant island and once there he reveals himself to be a birdman. Being a birdman he was not a good hunter and could only hunt fish. Unable to escape the island she resigned herself to her situation, until her father came to visit one day. Her father decided to kill the birdman upon realizing he lied about who he was, attempting to rescue his daughter. They left the island on her father&#x27;s kayak, when the birdman&#x27;s friends attacked them in retaliation. They flew above the kayak and created great waves to attack the kayak with. Sedna&#x27;s father was so frightened he threw her overboard; she then grabbed onto the edge of the kayak holding on for her life. Fearing she would tip over the boat her father cut off her fingers, making her fall into the water. The fingers that were cut off then became sea animals and she sank to the ocean floor where she became a spirit of the ocean.

In one Baffin Island tradition, Sedna was in a kayak with her family when a storm started. Her parents thought she was to blame for the storm and threw her into the sea. She clung to the kayak, but her father cut her fingers off: first the tips, then the second knuckle, then the last knuckle. Her disembodied fingers turned into sea creatures. Sedna gained control over the animals. If humans angered her, she could stop the animals from coming to their hunting sites, thus causing famine.

The varying legends each give different rationales for Sedna&#x27;s death. Yet, in each version, her father takes her to sea in his kayak, chopping off her fingers. In each version she sinks to the bottom of the sea, worshipped by hunters who depend on her goodwill to supply food. She is generally considered a vengeful goddess, and hunters must placate and pray to her to release the sea animals from the ocean depths for their hunt. At Killiniq, people threw worn-out harpoon-heads, broken knives, and morsels of meat and bone into the sea as offerings.

==In astronomy==
90377 Sedna, a trans-Neptunian object discovered by Michael Brown (Caltech), Chad Trujillo (Gemini Observatory) and David Rabinowitz (Yale University) on November 14, 2003, is named after her.

<text>In Inuit mythology, Arnakuagsak (&quot;old woman from the sea&quot;. Alternative: Arnarquagsag, Arnakua&#x27;gsak) was an Inuit goddess, one of the primary deities of the religion, who was responsible for ensuring the hunters were able to catch enough food and that the people remained healthy and strong. She was worshipped primarily in Greenland, but was essentially equivalent to the Canadian Sedna or Arnapkapfaaluk and the Alaskan Nerrivik.

<text>In Inuit religion, Nerrivik or Nerivik was the sea-mother and provider of food for Inuit. She was the patron of fisherman and hunters. In Canada, she was known as either Sedna or Arnapkapfaaluk and in Greenland, she was Arnakuagsak.

== Myth ==
Nerrivik married the storm-god, who afterwards produced a storm at sea while her male relatives were ferrying her back to their homeland secretly when her husband had been absent hunting. Her relatives having cast her overboard in order to calm the storm, her grandfather cut off the hand with which she continued to grasp the boat; therefore she is now, one-handed, at the bottom of the sea. (Rasmussen, 1921, p. 113) This myth is from the Inughuit (Polar Eskimos), of Smith Sound (in northern Greenland).

<text>In Innu mythology, Matshishkapeu (&quot;The Farting God&quot;) is considered to be one of the most powerful spirits, and thought to be even more powerful than the Caribou Master. According to legend, the Caribou Master withheld caribou from the Innu out of greed, causing them to begin starving. Matshishkapeu approached the Caribou Master and asked him to provide the Innu with enough caribou to eat, but the Caribou Master refused. Matshishkapeu then said if he did not give the Innu caribou, he would be struck with illness. The Caribou Master refused again, subsequently being cursed with a painful case of constipation. Finally, the Caribou Master relented, and Matshishkapeu then cured him of his ailment.

The souls are purified there, in preparation for the travel to the Land of the Moon (Quidlivun or Qudlivun, &quot;the uppermost ones&quot;), where they find eternal rest and peace. Sedna, Torngarsuk and the tornat (spirits of animals and natural formations) and tupilaq (souls of dead people) live in Adlivun, which is usually described as a frozen wasteland. Sedna is the ruler of the land, and is said to imprison the souls of the living as part of the preparation for the next stage of their journey.

When an Inuk dies, they are wrapped in caribou skin and buried. Elderly corpses have their feet pointing towards west or southwest, while children&#x27;s feet point east or southeast and young adults towards the south. Three days of mourning follow, with relatives staying in the deceased&#x27;s hut with nostrils closed by a piece of caribou skin. After three days, the mourners ritualistically circle the grave three times, promising venison to the spirit, which is then brought when the grave is visited.

The psychopomps Pinga and Anguta bring the souls of the dead to Adlivun, where they must stay for one year before moving on.

She would become angry if people killed more caribou than they could eat, so Caribou communities were careful not to over-hunt. Pinga is also a psychopomp, receiving the souls of the newly deceased and preparing them for reincarnation. &quot;Angakkuit&quot; (shamans) might see or communicate with Pinga or sometimes she&#x27;d send a spirit to speak with them.

<doc id="92791" wikidata="Q758907" url="?curid=92791" title="Audio power amplifier">
<text>An audio power amplifier (or power amp) amplifies low-power electronic audio signals, such as the signal from a radio receiver or an electric guitar pickup, to a level that is high enough for driving loudspeakers or headphones. Audio power amplifiers are found in all manner of sound systems including sound reinforcement, public address, home audio systems and musical instrument amplifiers like guitar amplifiers. It is the final electronic stage in a typical audio playback chain before the signal is sent to the loudspeakers.

The preceding stages in such a chain are low-power audio amplifiers which perform tasks like pre-amplification of the signal, equalization, mixing different input signals. The inputs can also be any number of audio sources like record players, CD players, digital audio players and cassette players. Most audio power amplifiers require these low-level inputs, which are line level.

While the input signal to an audio power amplifier, such as the signal from an electric guitar, may measure only a few hundred microwatts, its output may be a few watts for small consumer electronics devices, such as clock radios, tens or hundreds of watts for a home stereo system, several thousand watts for a nightclub&#x27;s sound system or tens of thousands of watts for a large rock concert sound reinforcement system. While power amplifiers are available in standalone units, typically aimed at the hi-fi audiophile market (a niche market) of audio enthusiasts and sound reinforcement system professionals, many consumer electronics audio products such as an integrated amplifier, a receiver, clock radios, boomboxes and televisions have both a preamplifier and a power amplifier contained in a single chassis.

== History ==
The audio amplifier was invented around 1912 by Lee de Forest. This was made possible by his invention of the first practical amplifying electrical component, the triode vacuum tube (or &quot;valve&quot; in British English) in 1907. The triode was a three-terminal device with a control grid that can modulate the flow of electrons from the filament to the plate. The triode vacuum amplifier was used to make the first AM radio. Early audio power amplifiers were based on vacuum tubes and some of these achieved notably high audio quality (e.g., the Williamson amplifier of 1947–9).
Audio power amplifiers based on transistors became practical with the wide availability of inexpensive transistors in the late 1960s. Since the 1970s, most modern audio amplifiers are based on solid-state transistors, especially the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) and the metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). Transistor-based amplifiers are lighter in weight, more reliable and require less maintenance than tube amplifiers.

The MOSFET was invented at Bell Labs between 1955 and 1960. was adapted into a power MOSFET for audio by Jun-ichi Nishizawa at Tohoku University in 1974. Power MOSFETs were soon manufactured by Yamaha for their hi-fi audio amplifiers. JVC, Pioneer Corporation, Sony and Toshiba also began manufacturing amplifiers with power MOSFETs in 1974. In 1977, Hitachi introduced the LDMOS (lateral diffused MOS), a type of power MOSFET. Hitachi was the only LDMOS manufacturer between 1977 and 1983, during which time LDMOS was used in audio power amplifiers from manufacturers such as HH Electronics (V-series) and Ashly Audio, and were used for music and public address systems. Class-D amplifiers became successful in the mid-1980s when low-cost, fast-switching MOSFETs were made available. Many transistor amps use MOSFET devices in their power sections, because their distortion curve is more tube-like.

In the 2010s, there are still audio enthusiasts, musicians (particularly electric guitarists, electric bassists, Hammond organ players and Fender Rhodes electric piano players, among others), audio engineers and music producers who prefer tube-based amplifiers, and what is perceived as a &quot;warmer&quot; tube sound.
== Design parameters ==
Key design parameters for audio power amplifiers are frequency response, gain, noise, and distortion. These are interdependent; increasing gain often leads to undesirable increases in noise and distortion. While negative feedback actually reduces the gain, it also reduces distortion. Most audio amplifiers are linear amplifiers operating in class AB.

Until the 1970s, most amplifiers used vacuum tubes. During the 1970s, tube amps were increasingly replaced with transistor-based amplifiers, which were lighter in weight, more reliable, and lower maintenance. Nevertheless, tube preamplifiers are still sold in niche markets, such as with home hi-fi enthusiasts, audio engineers and music producers (who use tube preamplifiers in studio recordings to &quot;warm up&quot; microphone signals) and electric guitarists, electric bassists and Hammond organ players, of whom a minority continue to use tube preamps, tube power amps and tube effects units. While hi-fi enthusiasts and audio engineers doing live sound or monitoring tracks in the studio typically seek out amplifiers with the lowest distortion, electric instrument players in genres such as blues, rock music and heavy metal music, among others, use tube amplifiers because they like the natural overdrive that tube amps produce when pushed hard.

The class-D amplifier, which is much more efficient than class-AB amplifiers, is now widely used in consumer electronics audio products, bass amplifiers and sound reinforcement system gear, as class-D amplifiers are much lighter in weight and produce much less heat.

==Filters and preamplifiers==
Since modern digital devices, including CD and DVD players, radio receivers and tape decks already provide a &quot;flat&quot; signal at line level, the preamp is not needed other than as a volume control and source selector. One alternative to a separate preamp is to simply use passive volume and switching controls, sometimes integrated into a power amplifier to form an integrated amplifier.

==Power output stages==

The final stage of amplification, after preamplifiers, is the output stage, where the highest demands are placed on the transistors or tubes. For this reason, the design choices made around the output device (for single-ended output stages, such as in single-ended triode amplifiers) or devices (for push-pull output stages), such as the class of operation of the output devices is often taken as the description of the whole power amplifier. For example, a class-B amplifier will probably have just the high power output devices operating cut off for half of each cycle, while the other devices (such as differential amplifier, voltage amplifier and possibly even driver transistors) operate in class A. In a transformerless output stage, the devices are essentially in series with the power supply and output load (such as a loudspeaker), possibly via some large capacitor and/or small resistances.

==Further developments==
For some years following the introduction of solid-state amplifiers, their perceived sound did not have the excellent audio quality of the best valve amplifiers (see valve audio amplifier). This led audiophiles to believe that &quot;tube sound&quot; or valve sound had an intrinsic quality due to the vacuum tube technology itself. In 1970, Matti Otala published a paper on the origin of a previously unobserved form of distortion: transient intermodulation distortion (TIM), later also called slew-induced distortion (SID) by others. TIM distortion was found to occur during very rapid increases in amplifier output voltage.

TIM did not appear at steady state sine tone measurements, helping to hide it from design engineers prior to 1970. Problems with TIM distortion stem from reduced open loop frequency response of solid-state amplifiers. Further works of Otala and other authors found the solution for TIM distortion, including increasing slew rate, decreasing preamp frequency bandwidth, and the insertion of a lag compensation circuit in the input stage of the amplifier. In high-quality modern amplifiers the open loop response is at least 20 kHz, canceling TIM distortion.

The next step in advanced design was the Baxandall Theorem, created by Peter Baxandall in England. This theorem introduced the concept of comparing the ratio between the input distortion and the output distortion of an amplifier. This new idea helped audio design engineers to better evaluate the distortion processes within an amplifier.

== Applications ==

Important applications include public address systems, theatrical and concert sound reinforcement systems, and domestic systems such as a stereo or home-theatre system. Instrument amplifiers including guitar amplifiers and electric keyboard amplifiers also use audio power amplifiers. In some cases, the power amplifier for an instrument amplifier is integrated into a single amplifier &quot;head&quot; which contains a preamplifier, tone controls, and electronic effects. These components may be mounted in a wooden speaker cabinet to create a &quot;combo amplifier&quot;. Musicians with unique performance needs and/or a need for very powerful amplification may create a custom setup with separate rackmount preamplifiers, equalizers, and a power amplifier mounted in a 19&quot; road case.

Power amplifiers are available in standalone units, which are used by hi-fi audio enthusiasts and designers of public address systems (PA systems) and sound reinforcement systems. A hi-fi user of power amplifiers may have a stereo power amplifier to drive left and right speakers and a single-channel (mono) power amplifier to drive a subwoofer. The number of power amplifiers used in a sound reinforcement setting depends on the size of the venue. A small coffeehouse may have a single power amp driving two PA speakers. A nightclub may have several power amps for the main speakers, one or more power amps for the monitor speakers (pointing towards the band) and an additional power amp for the subwoofer. A stadium concert may have a large number of power amps mounted in racks. Most consumer electronics sound products, such as TVs, boom boxes, home cinema sound systems, Casio and Yamaha electronic keyboards, &quot;combo&quot; guitar amps and car stereos have power amplifiers integrated inside the chassis of the main product.

<text>In Inuit religion, Silap Inua (&#x27;possessor of spirit&#x27;, ᓯᓚᑉ ᐃᓄᐊ) or Sila (&#x27;breath, spirit&#x27;, ᓯᓪᓚ) (Iñupiaq: &quot;siḷam iñua&quot;) is similar to mana or ether, the primary component of everything that exists; it is also the breath of life and the method of locomotion for any movement or change. Silla was believed to control everything that goes on in one&#x27;s life.

==Description==

Silla is a spirit of the sky, the wind, and the weather. Though identified as male, he is never depicted, and thought to be formless. There are very few myths in which Silla is a character, because he is not thought to have many personality characteristics. He also represents a concept somewhat akin to the Hindu idea of Paramatman, or Emerson’s idea of the great Over soul: Silla is also believed to be the substance which souls are made of. Contrary to the Christian missionaries who have identified Nanook the polar bear spirit as the supreme deity of the Inuit, Silla is much closer to this role. However Silla also has a somewhat malevolent aspect: he is known to lure children away from their play off into the tundra, never to be seen again.

Among the many various Inuit cultures, term &quot;silap inua&quot; / &quot;sila&quot;, &quot;hillap inua&quot; / &quot;hilla&quot; (among Inuit), &quot;siḷam iñua&quot; (among Inupiaq), &quot;ellam yua&quot; / &quot;ella&quot; (among Yup&#x27;ik) is used with some diversity. In many instances it refers “outer space”, “intellect”, “weather”, “sky”, “universe”: there may be some correspondence with the presocratic concept of logos.

Shamanhood among Eskimo peoples was a diverse phenomenon, just like the various Inuit cultures themselves. Among Copper Inuit, shamans were believed to obtain their power from this “Wind Indweller”, thus even their helping spirits were termed as &quot;silap inue&quot;.

Among Siberian Yupik, was depicted as a mighty hunter, catching game just like earthly men, but being capable of controlling whether people paid attention to customs and traditions.

In Sireniki Eskimo language, the word has meanings &#x27;universe&#x27;, &#x27;outer world&#x27;, &#x27;space&#x27;, &#x27;free space&#x27;, or &#x27;weather&#x27;.

==History==
According to the interpretations of anthropologists, Silla is one of the oldest Inuit deities, but was recently (in the last thousand years) supplanted by Sedna, (the goddess of sea mammals) and the Caribou Mother (the goddess of caribou) when these became the major food sources of the Inuit. Anthropologists believe that the belief is extremely old because of the widespread nature of this deity.

<text>Qiqirn is a large, bald dog spirit in Inuit mythology, from around the area of Baffin Island. It has hair only on its feet, mouth and the tips of its ears and tail. Its presence will send men and dogs into convulsions, sometimes fatal. However, it is frightened of humans and will run away if an angakkuq sees it. A similar term, also from Inuit mythology, is keelut, a malevolent earth spirit which also appears as a hairless dog.

Daniel Merkur suggested that the fits caused by the qiqirn were allusions to shamanic initiations.

==Popular culture==
In Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s short story &quot;Quiquern&quot;, the creature is described as a giant, phantasmal, toothless and hairless dog with six or eight pairs of legs. Quiquern is seen wandering before important events, and makes dogs go mad. Two young Inuit hunters, desperate to find food for their starving tribe, believe they are being guided by Quiquern, only to discover that the many-legged &quot;spirit&quot; is actually a pair of sled dogs whose collars had become entangled. Nevertheless, once they see that the dogs are well-fed, the hunters realise the &quot;spirit&quot; has guided them to find food after all.

<doc id="92801" wikidata="Q2748289" url="?curid=92801" title="Guarani mythology">
<text>The Tupi-Guarani mythology is the set of narratives about the gods and spirits of the different Tupi-Guarani peoples, ancient and current. Together with the cosmogonies, anthropogonies and rituals, they form part of the religion of these peoples.

The Guarani people live in the south-central part of South America, especially in Paraguay and parts of the surrounding areas of Argentina, Brazil, and Bolivia. The Tupi people were one of the most numerous peoples indigenous to Brazil, occupying largely the Atlantic coast of Brazil and In the Amazon where there are Tupi towns with no connection to the outside, heavily mixing with the Portuguese colonizers.

==Overview==
There exist no written records of the ancient myths and legends associated with the Guarani people. The Guarani language was not a written language until modern times, so their religious beliefs have largely been passed down through word of mouth. As such, accounts of the various gods and related myths and legends can vary from one locale to the next, and the regional differences may be so extreme as to completely redefine the role a specific deity plays in the Guarani belief system.

Although many of the indigenous Guarani people have been assimilated into modern society and their belief system altered or replaced by Christianity (due in large part to the work of Jesuit missionaries in the 16th century), several of the core beliefs are still active in many rural areas in the Guarani region. As a result, the myths and legends continue to evolve to this day.

==Guarani creation myth==
The primary figure in most Guarani creation legends is Tupã, the supreme god of all creation. With the help of the moon goddess Arasy, Tupã descended upon the Earth in a location specified as a hill in the region of Areguá, and from that location created all that is found upon the face of the earth, including the ocean, forests, and the animals. It is also said that the stars were placed in the sky at this point.

Tupã then created humanity (according to most Guarani myths, the Guarani were naturally the first race of people to be made, with every other civilization being born from it) in an elaborate ceremony, forming clay statues of man and woman with a mixture of various elements from nature. After breathing life into the human forms, he left them with the spirits of good and evil and departed.

==Early humanity==
The original humans created by Tupã were Rupave and Sypave, whose names mean &quot;Father of the people&quot; and &quot;Mother of the people&quot;, respectively. The pair had three sons and a large but unspecified number of daughters. The first of their sons was Tumé Arandú, considered to be the wisest of men and the great prophet of the Guarani people. Second of their sons was Marangatú, a benevolent and generous leader of his people, and father of Kerana, the mother of the seven legendary monsters of Guarani myth (see below). Their third son was Japeusá, who was from birth considered a liar, a thief and a trickster, always doing things backwards to confuse people and take advantage of them. He eventually committed suicide, drowning himself in the water, but he was resurrected as a crab, and since then all crabs are cursed to walk backwards much as Japeusá did.

Among the daughters of the Rupave and Supave was Porâsý, notable for sacrificing her own life in order to rid the world of one of the seven legendary monsters, diminishing their power (and thus the power of evil as a whole).

Several of the first humans were considered to have ascended upon their deaths and become minor deities.

==Seven legendary monsters==

Kerana, the beautiful daughter of Marangatu, was captured by the personification or spirit of evil called Tau. Together the two had seven sons who were cursed of the high goddess Arasy, and all but one were born as hideous monsters. The seven are considered primary figures in Guarani mythology, and while several of the lesser gods or even the original humans are forgotten in the verbal tradition of some areas, these seven were generally maintained in the legends. Some of them are even believed in down to modern times in some rural areas. The seven sons of Tau and Kerana are, in order of their births:
*Teju Jagua, god or spirit of caverns and fruits
*Mbói Tu&#x27;ĩ, god of waterways and aquatic creatures
*Moñái, god of the open fields. He was defeated by the sacrifice of Porâsý
*Jasy Jatere, god of the yerba mate plant and also of the siesta, only of the seven to not appear as a monster
*Kurupi, god of sexuality and fertility
*Ao Ao, god of hills and mountains
*Luison (or &quot;Luisõ&quot;), god of death and all things related to it

==Other gods or important figures==
*, spirit or personification of good, opposite to Tau
*Pytajovái, god of war 
*Pombero, a popular spirit of mischief
*Abaangui, a god credited with the creation of the moon; may only figure as an adaptation of outlying Guarani tribes
*, a god limited to worship by men, generally limited to isolated tribes in Brazil
*Jande Jari, &quot;our grandmother&quot;, spirit of the river Parapetí in Bolivia
*, (&quot;Buried Treasure&quot;), many treasures were buried during the Paraguayan War, it&#x27;s a tradition that if someone is to see a headless white dog that disappears and re-appears all the time in their own house, it means that Plata Yvyguy is buried under it. 

* The Celestial Jaguar, According to a version of the legend, the mother of the heavenly twins, known as Sun and Moon, was killed by the Celestial Jaguars. The twins were raised by the jaguars until a bird told them how their mother had been killed. The twins went on a rampage, killing all jaguars except one which was pregnant and the mother of today&#x27;s primitive jaguars. Now, jaguars are a wild beast that are to be feared by the Guarani. It is common for the animal to be part of the beginning and end of a person&#x27;s life. The meat will be eaten by a child&#x27;s mother while she is pregnant and the jaguars themselves represent the souls of the dead in temples. Those that are sick, elderly, and slow-moving have also been known to have been left behind to the jaguars.

<text>Pictographs of a [[Anishinaabe traditional beliefs|&#x27; as well as two giant serpents and a canoe, from [[Lake Superior Provincial Park]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Attributed to the Ojibwe.]]Anishinaabe traditional beliefs cover the traditional belief system of the Anishinaabeg peoples, consisting of the Algonquin/Nipissing, Ojibwa/Chippewa/Saulteaux/Mississaugas, Odawa, Potawatomi and Oji-Cree, located primarily in the Great Lakes region of North America.

==Medicine Societies==
The Anishinaabe have four different Medicine Societies.

===Midewiwin===

The &#x27; (also spelled &#x27; and ) is the Grand Medicine Society of the indigenous groups of the Maritimes, New England and Great Lakes regions in North America. Its practitioners are called and the practices of referred to as the . The society is a secretive animistic religion, requiring an initiation, and then progressing to four levels of practitioners, called &quot;degrees&quot;. Occasionally, male are called , which sometimes is very loosely translated into English as &quot;medicine man&quot;.

The &#x27; (also spelled &#x27;, &#x27; and &#x27;) is the Dawn Society, also sometime improperly called the &quot;Magical Dawn Society&quot;. Its practitioners are called and the practices of referred to as the . The are distinct society of visionaries. Like the , the is a secretive animistic religion, requiring an initiation. But unlike the , the have sometimes two levels and sometimes four, with this variation being dependent on the particular lodge. They were systematically imprisoned in mental hospitals by the United States government in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Because of this persecution the went underground and have just begun to reemerge since the passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act. The ceremonies and traditions are closely guarded.
The are also known as the Shaking Tent or the Juggler&#x27;s Tent. Among the Anishinaabeg, a particularly powerful and well-respected spiritual practice. Those who had trained from childhood are called a or , also known as a &quot;Juggler&quot; or &quot;Shaking-tent Seer.&quot;

==Migration story==
According to the oral history of the Anishinaabeg, they originally lived on the shores of the &quot;Great Salt Water&quot; (presumably the Atlantic Ocean near the Gulf of St. Lawrence). They were instructed by seven prophets to follow a sacred shell (whiteshell) toward the west, until they reached a place where food grew upon the water. They began their migration some time around 950, stopping at various points several times along the way, most significantly at , Sault Ste. Marie, where they stayed for a long time, and where two subgroups decided to stay (these became the Potawatomi and Odawa). Eventually, after a trick by two of the clans, the other clans travelled west (see William Warren&#x27;s account of this incident) and arrived at the wild ricing lands of Minnesota and Wisconsin (wild rice being the food that grew upon the water) and made (Madeline Island: &#x27;Island of the yellow-shafted flicker&#x27;) their new capital. In total, the migration took around five centuries.

Following the migration there was a cultural divergence separating the Potawatomi from the Ojibwa and Ottawa. Particularly, the Potawatomi did not adopt the agricultural innovations discovered or adopted by the Ojibwa, such as the Three Sisters crop complex, copper tools, conjugal collaborative farming, and the use of canoes in rice harvest.

== Importance of storytelling ==
Storytelling is one of the most important aspects of Anishinaabe life. Many Anishinaabe people believe that stories create worlds, are an essential part of generational connection by way of teaching and listening, and facilitate connection with the nonhuman, natural world. Oral storytelling is often considered unimportant in settler colonial society; however, this form of communication, connection, and teaching has been used for centuries, and is still used to pass down Anishinaabe traditional beliefs through generations.

Storytelling is often used to teach life lessons relating to traditional and current beliefs. In Anishinaabe traditional stories, Nanabush, Amik (beaver), and Nokomis (grandmother figure) are important characters. Anishinaabe stories feature activities and actions involving generation, an important concept among Anishinaabe peoples such as participating in ceremonies, experimenting with new ideas and people, and reflecting on the outcome of events. Nanabush stories carry the message to young Indigenous peoples that it is okay to make mistakes, and that things are not always black and white. This is different from many settler colonial narratives which usually clearly define story characters as good or bad.

Amik (beaver) is a being in traditional Anishinaabe stories that creates shared worlds. The stories of Amik’s creations and how Amik teaches their child about the world serves to provide a greater understanding of relationships and what is important in life. Nokomis (grandmother) is another being from Anishinaabe folklore. Nokomis and Nanabush stories are usually utilized to teach about important life lessons.

Generational storytelling creates a bond between tribal elders and younger Indigenous people. Elders are known as &quot;knowledge keepers&quot; and are highly respected for their knowledge about stories, language, and history. Teaching through storytelling and learning to listen and understand requires a strong connection between the storyteller and the ones hearing the story. In this way, storytelling connects generations of Anishinaabe people. 

===Nanabozho stories===
Nanabozho (also known by a variety of other names and spellings, including &quot;Wenabozho&quot;, &quot;Menabozho&quot;, and &quot;Nanabush&quot;) is a trickster figure and culture hero who features as the protagonist of a cycle of stories that serve as the Anishinaabe origin belief. The cycle, which varies somewhat from community to community, tells the story of Nanabozho&#x27;s conception, birth, and his ensuing adventures, which involve interactions with spirit and animal beings, the creation of the Earth, and the establishment of the Midewiwin. The myth cycle explains the origin of several traditions, including mourning customs, beliefs about the afterlife, and the creation of the sacred plant (tobacco).

* Nokomis
* Shingebiss

== Relationships to the Other-Than-Human ==
In Anishinaabe traditional belief, everything in the environment is interconnected and has important relationships with the things around it. Non-humans, and ecosystems are viewed as having great worth and importance, in addition to humans. One such relationship in Anishinaabe homeland (what is now known as the Great Lake region) is between (lake sturgeon), (wild rice), (water), and humans. Similar relationships are exemplified in stories. For example, in her book &quot;A Short History of the Blockade&quot;, Leanne B. Simpson tells a story about Amik (beaver), stating &quot;They [beavers] are consenting to giving up their bodies to help the Nishnaabeg feed their families.&quot;

These relationships between humans and the other-than-human can continue to be used in current times with regard to conservation and the environment. According to Potawatomi scholar Kyle Powys Whyte, &quot;...indigenous conservationists and restorationists tend to focus on sustaining particular plants and animals whose lives are entangled locally—and often over many generations—in ecological, cultural and economic relationships with human societies and other nonhuman species.&quot; Having an understanding of the relationships between humans and the other-than-human strengthens the desire to respect the environment and practice Nishnaabeg conservation.

== The Seven Grandfather Teachings ==

The Seven Grandfather Teachings are traditional guiding principles for living a good life still in use by Anishnaabe peoples today. (They originate from the Potowatomi and Ojibwe tribes specifically.) These teachings include wisdom, respect, love, honesty, humility, bravery, and truth, and are supposed to be practiced towards humans, the earth, and everything in the environment. According to Leanne B. Simpson in &quot;A Short History of the Blockade&quot;, the Seven Grandfather Teachings were &quot;...gifted to the Nishnaabeg by Seven Ancestors, a group of loving Elders and advisors that taught a young child these practices as recorded in one of our Sacred Stories.&quot; Each of the teachings has an animal that represents it.

<text>The Horned Serpent appears in the mythologies of many cultures including Native American peoples, European, and Near Eastern mythology. Details vary among cultures, with many of the stories associating the mystical figure with water, rain, lightning, thunder, and rebirth. Horned Serpents were major components of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex of North American prehistory.

== In Native American cultures ==
Horned serpents appear in the oral history of numerous Native American cultures, especially in the Southeastern Woodlands and Great Lakes.

Muscogee Creek traditions include a Horned Serpent and a Tie-Snake, &quot;estakwvnayv&quot; in the Muscogee Creek language. These are sometimes interpreted as being the same creature and sometimes different—similar, but the Horned Serpent is larger than the Tie-Snake. To the Muscogee people, the Horned Serpent is a type of underwater serpent covered with iridescent, crystalline scales and a single, large crystal in its forehead. Both the scales and crystals are prized for their powers of divination. The horns, called &quot;chitto gab-by&quot;, were used in medicine. Jackson Lewis, a Muscogee Creek informant to John R. Swanton, said, &quot;This snake lives in the water has horns like the stag. It is not a bad snake. ... It does not harm human beings but seems to have a magnetic power over game.&quot; In stories, the Horned Serpent enjoyed eating sumac, &quot;Rhus glabra&quot;.

Alabama people call the Horned Serpent &quot;tcinto såktco&quot; or &quot;crawfish snake&quot;, which they divide into four classifications based on its horns&#x27; colors, which can be blue, red, white, or yellow.

Yuchi people made effigies of the Horned Serpent as recently as 1905. An effigy was fashioned from stuffed deerhide, painted blue, with the antlers painted yellow. The Yuchi Big Turtle Dance honors the Horned Serpent&#x27;s spirit, which was related to storms, thunder, lightning, disease, and rainbows.

Among Cherokee people, a Horned Serpent is called an &quot;uktena&quot;. Anthropologist James Mooney, describes the creature:

Those who know say the Uktena is a great snake, as large around as a tree trunk, with horns on its head, and a bright blazing crest like a diamond on its forehead, and scales glowing like sparks of fire. It has rings or spots of color along its whole length, and can not be wounded except by shooting in the seventh spot from the head, because under this spot are its heart and its life. The blazing diamond is called Ulun&#x27;suti—&quot;Transparent&quot;—and he who can win it may become the greatest wonder worker of the tribe. But it is worth a man&#x27;s life to attempt it, for whoever is seen by the Uktena is so dazed by the bright light that he runs toward the snake instead of trying to escape. As if this were not enough, the breath of the Uktena is so pestilential, that no living creature can survive should they inhale the tiniest bit of the foul air expelled by the Uktena. Even to see the Uktena asleep is death, not to the hunter himself, but to his family.

According to Sioux belief, the &quot;Unhcegila&quot; (&quot;Ųȟcéǧila&quot;) are dangerous reptilian water monsters which lived in ancient times. They were of various shapes. In the end the Thunderbirds destroyed them, except for small species like snakes and lizards. This belief may have been inspired by finds of dinosaur fossils in Sioux tribal territory. The Thunderbird may have been inspired partly by finds of pterosaur skeletons.

== Eurasia ==

===In Europe===

==== In Celtic iconography ====

The ram-horned serpent was a cult image found in north-west Europe before and during the Roman period. It appears three times on the Gundestrup cauldron, and in Romano-Celtic Gaul was closely associated with the horned or antlered god Cernunnos, in whose company it is regularly depicted. This pairing is found as early as the fourth century BC in Northern Italy, where a huge antlered figure with torcs and a serpent was carved on the rocks in Val Camonica.

A bronze statuette called the God of Étang-sur-Arroux and a stone sculpture from Sommerécourt depict Cernunnos&#x27; body encircled by two horned snakes which feed from bowls of fruit and corn-mash balanced in the god&#x27;s lap. Also at Sommerécourt is a sculpture of a goddess holding a cornucopia and a pomegranate, with a horned serpent eating from a bowl of food. At Yzeures-sur-Creuse a carved youth has a ram-horned snake twined around his legs, with its head at his stomach. In a relief at a museum in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, Cernunnos&#x27; legs are depicted as two ram-horned snakes which rear up on each side of his head and are eating fruit or corn. 

According to Miranda Green, the snakes reflect the peaceful nature of the god, associated with nature and fruitfulness, and perhaps accentuate his association with regeneration.

Other deities occasionally accompanied by ram-horned serpents include &quot;Celtic Mars&quot; and &quot;Celtic Mercury&quot;. The horned snake, and also conventional snakes, appear together with the solar wheel, apparently as attributes of the sun or sky god.

==== In Northern and Central Europe ====
Variations on the horned serpent appear throughout the folklores of Northern and Central Europe. For example, there are the many incarnations of the Lindworm. There are tales of a serpent in Icelandic folklore known as the Lagarfljót Worm. While in Southern Sweden, there are claims of a huge water snake, the sight of which was deadly, called Storsjöodjuret . This latter characteristic is reminiscent of the basilisk.

==== Greek ====
The cerastes is a creature described in Greek mythology as a snake with either two large ram-like horns or four pairs of smaller horns. Isidore of Seville described it as hunting by burying itself in sand while leaving its horns visible, and attacking creatures that came to investigate them.

===In Mesopotamia===
In Mesopotamian mythology, Ningishzida is sometimes depicted as a serpent with horns. In other depictions, he is shown as human but is accompanied by &quot;bashmu&quot;, mushussu, and ushumgal (three horned snakes in Akkadian mythology). Ningishzida shares the epithet, &quot;ushumgal&quot;, &quot;great serpent&quot;, with several other Mesopotamian gods.

== In Africa ==
A horned serpent cave art is known from the La Belle France cave in South Africa, often conflated with the Dingonek. It may be based on dicynodont fossils.

<text>The Chickasaw ( ) are an Indigenous people of the Southeastern Woodlands, United States. Their traditional territory was in northern Mississippi, northwestern and northern Alabama, western Tennessee and southwestern Kentucky. Their language is classified as a member of the Muskogean language family. In the present day, they are organized as the federally recognized Chickasaw Nation.

Chickasaw people have a migration story in which they moved from a land west of the Mississippi River to reach present-day northeast Mississippi, northwest Alabama, and into Lawrence County, Tennessee. They had interaction with French, English, and Spanish colonists during the colonial period. The United States considered the Chickasaw one of the Five Civilized Tribes of the Southeast, as they adopted numerous practices of European Americans. Resisting European-American settlers encroaching on their territory, they were forced by the U.S. government to sell their traditional lands in the 1832 Treaty of Pontotoc Creek and move to Indian Territory (Oklahoma) during the era of Indian removal in the 1830s.

Most of their descendants remain as residents of what is now Oklahoma. The Chickasaw Nation in Oklahoma is the 13th-largest federally recognized tribe in the United States. Its members are related to the Choctaw and share a common history with them. The Chickasaw were divided into two groups (moieties): the &quot;Imosak Cha&#x27;a&#x27;&quot; (chopped hickory) and the &quot;Inchokka&#x27; Lhipa&quot;&#x27; (worn out house), though the characteristics of these groups in relation to Chickasaw villages, clans, and house groups is uncertain. They traditionally followed a kinship system of matrilineal descent, in which inheritance and descent are traced through the maternal line. Children are considered born into the mother&#x27;s family and clan, and gain their social status from her. Women controlled most property and hereditary leadership in the tribe passed through the maternal line.

==Etymology==
The name Chickasaw, as noted by anthropologist John Swanton, belonged to a Chickasaw minko&#x27;, or leader. &quot;Chickasaw&quot; is the English spelling of &quot;Chikashsha&quot; (), meaning &quot;comes from Chicsa&quot;. In an 1890 extra census bulletin on the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muskogee, and Seminole, a history of the Choctaw and Chickasaw was included that was written by R.W. McAdam. McAdam claimed that the word &quot;Chikasha&quot; meant &quot;rebel&quot; in the Choctaw language. Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto had recorded the people as &quot;Chicaza&quot; when his expedition came into contact with them in 1540; the Spanish were the first known Europeans to explore the North American Southeast.

The suffix &quot;-mingo&quot; (Chickasaw: &quot;minko&quot;) is used to identify a chief. For example, &quot;Tishomingo&quot; was the name of a famous Chickasaw chief. The towns of Tishomingo in Mississippi and Oklahoma were named for him, as was Tishomingo County in Mississippi.

==History==

The origin of the Chickasaw is uncertain; 20th-century scholars, such as the archaeologist Patricia Galloway, theorize that the Chickasaw and Choctaw split into distinct peoples in the 17th century from the remains of Plaquemine culture and other groups whose ancestors had lived in the lower Mississippi Valley for thousands of years. When Europeans first encountered them, the Chickasaw were living in villages in what is now northeastern Mississippi.

The Chickasaw are believed to have migrated into Mississippi from the west, as their oral history attests. They and the Choctaw were once one people and migrated from west of the Mississippi River into present-day Mississippi in prehistoric times; the Chickasaw and Choctaw split along the way. The Mississippian Ideological Interaction Sphere spanned the Eastern Woodlands. The Mississippian cultures emerged from previous moundbuilding societies by 880 CE. They built complex, dense villages supporting a stratified society, with centers throughout the Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys and their tributaries.

In the 15th century, proto-Chickasaw people left the Tombigbee Valley after the collapse of the Moundville chiefdom. Chickasaw culture believe that the foundation of Chickasaw from proto-Chickasaw peoples was determined by the Mississippi River. The Mississippi River is referred to as &quot;Sakti Lhafa’ Okhina&quot; in &quot;Chikashanompa&#x27;,&quot; which means “scored bluff waterway&quot;, known today as the Chickasaw Bluffs. Settling upon the river provided the people with a symbolic sense of new beginngings, washing away the past of the proto-Chickasaw and entering into a new modern age of the Chickasaw. The migration marked their split from other Native American communities like the Choctaws. They settled into the upper Yazoo and Pearl River valleys in present-day Mississippi. Historian Arrell Gibson and anthropologist John R. Swanton believed the Chickasaw Old Fields were in Madison County, Alabama.

The Choctaws relayed to Bernard Romans their creation myth, saying that they came &quot;out of a hole in the ground, which they shew between their nation and the Chickasaws.&quot; Another version of the Chickasaw creation story is that they arose at &quot;Nanih Waiya,&quot; a great earthwork mound built about 300 CE by Woodland peoples. It is also sacred to the Choctaw, who share a similar story. The mound was built about 1400 years before the coalescence of each of these peoples as ethnic groups.

The first European contact with the Chickasaw was in 1540 when Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto encountered the tribe and stayed in one of their towns, most likely near present-day Starkville, Mississippi. The Chickasaw were alert around the Spanish, placing war banners implying their intentions for when they would meet the Spanish. The Chickasaw additionally gathered intel that the Spanish recently fought a nearly-lost battle in the town of Mabila, led by leader Tascalusa, only a few months prior to the Spanish entering their territory. In the winter of 1540, conflict finally struck between Chickasaw warriors and the Spanish Explorers. The reasonings for the battle vary from Spanish looting Chickasaw food storages, to general heated animosity between the two groups. After various disagreements, the Chickasaw attacked the De Soto expedition in a nighttime raid, nearly destroying the force. The Spanish moved on quickly.

The Chickasaw began to establish trading relationships with English colonists in the Province of Carolina after that colony was established in 1670. After acquiring firearms from colonial merchants in Carolina, Chickasaw raiders began to attack settlements belonging to a rival tribe, the Choctaw, in order to acquire captives which they sold to the colonists. These raids largely subsided after the Choctaw acquired firearms of their own from the French.

Allied with British colonists in the Southern Colonies, the Chickasaw were often at war with the French and the Choctaw in the 18th century, such as in the Battle of Ackia on May 26, 1736. Skirmishes continued until France ceded its claims to the region east of the Mississippi River after being defeated by the British in the Seven Years&#x27; War (called the French and Indian War in North America).

Following the American Revolutionary War, in 1793–94, the Chickasaw under Chief Piomingo fought as allies of the new United States under General Anthony Wayne against the Indians of the old Northwest Territory. The Shawnee and other allied Northwest Indians were defeated in the Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794.

A 19th-century historian, Horatio Cushman, wrote, &quot;Neither the Choctaws nor Chicksaws ever engaged in war against the American people, but always stood as their faithful allies.&quot; Cushman believed the Chickasaw, along with the Choctaw, may have had origins in present-day Mexico and migrated north. Frenchman Le Clerc Milfort, when writing about the Creek Indians, echoed the same view. That theory, however, does not have consensus; archeological research, as noted above, has revealed the peoples had long histories in the Mississippi area and independently developed complex cultures.

== Trade ==
Despite being smaller than many surrounding tribes, the Chickasaw established themselves as a trade power within the region. Aided by their strategic location on the Mississippi, the tribe was able to exchange goods with neighboring parties. The tactical importance of the Chickasaw was not lost on the British; in 1755, the Imperial Indian Superintendent Edmund Atkin recognized the tribe’s position: &quot;It is not possible to cast an Eye ever so lightly over a Map, without being struck with the Importance of the [Chickasaws&#x27;] situation.&quot;

The Chickasaw made their first formal contact with the British shortly after the founding of Charles Town in 1670; this occurred when Dr. Woordward of Carolina attempted to establish trade ties while on course to Alabama. Although the British outpost of Charles Town was located over 850 km from Chickasaw territory, the two groups managed to engage initially in an exchange of deerskin. Shortly after making contact with the British, the Chickasaw began to trade with the French as the Europeans established themselves within Louisiana.

Within Chickasaw society, trade was categorized under either white (peace) or red (war) routes. To maintain this duality, a War Chief and Peace chief oversaw the respective red and white divisions. Over time, the French union would be dictated by the leaders of the white division, while the English relationship was defined by the red. Ultimately, despite French proximity to Chickasaw land, the tribe elected to prioritize their trade routes with the British. The alliance between the British and the Chickasaw was a strategic defense against the French and their native allies. Supported by the slave trade, the Chickasaw sought weapons in exchange for captured members of rival tribes. As they were smaller than the Choctaw and other abutting indigenous groups, the weapons were critical to the defense of their native land.

==Tribal lands==

In 1797, a general appraisal of the tribe and its territorial bounds was made by Abraham Bishop of New Haven, who wrote:

===United States relations===
George Washington (first U.S. President) and Henry Knox (first U.S. Secretary of War) proposed the cultural transformation of Native Americans. Washington believed that Native Americans were equals, but that their society was inferior. He formulated a policy to encourage the &quot;civilizing&quot; process, and Thomas Jefferson continued it. Historian Robert Remini wrote, &quot;They presumed that once the Indians adopted the practice of private property, built homes, farmed, educated their children, and embraced Christianity, these Native Americans would win acceptance from white Americans.&quot; Washington&#x27;s six-point plan included impartial justice toward Indians; regulated buying of Indian lands; promotion of commerce; promotion of experiments to civilize or improve Indian society; presidential authority to give presents; and punishing those who violated Indian rights.
The government-appointed Indian agents, such as Benjamin Hawkins, who became Superintendent of Indian Affairs for all the territory south of the Ohio River. He and other agents lived among the Indians to teach them, through example and instruction, how to live like whites. Hawkins married a Muscogee Creek woman and lived with her people for decades. In the 19th century, the Chickasaw increasingly adopted European-American practices, as they established schools, adopted yeoman farming practices, converted to Christianity, and built homes in styles like their European-American neighbors.

Due to settlers encroaching into Chickasaw territory, the United States constructed Fort Hampton in 1810 in present-day Limestone County, Alabama. The fort was designed to keep settlers out of Chickasaw territory and was one of the few forts constructed in the United States to protect Native American land claims.

====Treaty of Hopewell (1786)====
The Chickasaw signed the Treaty of Hopewell in 1786. Article 11 of that treaty states: &quot;The hatchet shall be forever buried, and the peace given by the United States of America, and friendship re-established between the said States on the one part, and the Chickasaw nation on the other part, shall be universal, and the contracting parties shall use their utmost endeavors to maintain the peace given as aforesaid, and friendship re-established.&quot; Benjamin Hawkins attended this signing.

====Treaty of 1818====
In 1818, leaders of the Chickasaw signed several treaties, including the Treaty of Tuscaloosa, which ceded all claims to land north of the southern border of Tennessee up to the Ohio River (the southern border of Indiana and the Illinois Territory). This was known as the &quot;Jackson Purchase.&quot; The Chickasaw were allowed to retain a four-square-mile reservation but were required to lease the land to European immigrants.

====Colbert legacy (19th century)====
In the mid-18th century, an American-born trader of Scots and Chickasaw ancestry by the name of James Logan Colbert settled in the Muscle Shoals area of Alabama. He lived there for the next 40 years, where he married three high-ranking Chickasaw women in succession. Chickasaw chiefs and high-status women found such marriages of strategic benefit to the tribe, as it gave them advantages with traders over other groups. Colbert and his wives had numerous children, including seven sons: William, Jonathan, George, Levi, Samuel, Joseph, and Pittman (or James). Six survived to adulthood (Jonathan died young.)

The Chickasaw had a matrilineal system, in which children were considered born into the mother&#x27;s clan; and they gained their status in the tribe from her family. Property and hereditary leadership passed through the maternal line, and the mother&#x27;s eldest brother was the main male mentor of the children, especially of boys. Because of the status of their mothers, for nearly a century, the Colbert-Chickasaw sons and their descendants provided critical leadership during the tribe&#x27;s greatest challenges. They had the advantage of growing up bilingual.

Of these six sons, William &quot;Chooshemataha&quot; Colbert (named after James Logan&#x27;s father, Chief/Major William d&#x27;Blainville &quot;Piomingo&quot; Colbert) served with General Andrew Jackson during the Creek Wars of 1813–14. He also had served during the Revolutionary wars and received a commission from President George Washington in 1786 along with his namesake grandfather. His brothers Levi (&quot;Itawamba Mingo&quot;) and George Colbert (&quot;Tootesmastube&quot;) also had military service in support of the United States. In addition, the two each served as interpreters and negotiators for chiefs of the tribe during the period of removal. Levi Colbert served as principal chief, which may have been a designation by the Americans, who did not understand the decentralized nature of the chiefs&#x27; council, based on the tribe reaching broad consensus for major decisions. An example is that more than 40 chiefs from the Chickasaw Council, representing clans and villages, signed a letter in November 1832 by Levi Colbert to President Andrew Jackson, complaining about treaty negotiations with his appointee General John Coffee. After Levi&#x27;s death in 1834, the Chickasaw people were forced upon the Trail of Tears. His brother, George Colbert, reluctantly succeeded him as chief and principal negotiator, because he was bilingual and bicultural. George &quot;Tootesmastube&quot; Colbert never reached the Chickasaw&#x27;s &quot;Oka Homa&quot; (red waters); he died on Choctaw territory, Fort Towson, en route.

===Treaty of Pontotoc Creek and Removal (1832-1837)===
In 1832 after the state of Mississippi declared its jurisdiction over the Chickasaw Indians, outlawing tribal self-governance, Chickasaw chiefs assembled at the national council house on October 20, 1832 and signed the Treaty of Pontotoc Creek, ceding their remaining Mississippi territory to the U.S. and agreeing to find land and relocate west of the Mississippi River. Between 1832 and 1837, the Chickasaw would make further negotiations and arrangements for their removal. 

Unlike other tribes who received land grants in exchange for ceding territory, the Chickasaw held out for financial compensation: they were to receive $3 million U.S. dollars from the United States for their lands east of the Mississippi River.
In 1836 after a bitter five-year debate within the tribe, the Chickasaw had reached an agreement to purchase land in Indian Territory from the previously removed Choctaw. They paid the Choctaw $530,000 for the westernmost part of their land. The first group of Chickasaw moved in 1837.

The Chickasaw gathered at Memphis, Tennessee, on July 4, 1837, with all of their portable assets: belongings, livestock, and enslaved African Americans. Three thousand and one Chickasaw crossed the Mississippi River, following routes established by the Choctaw and Creek. During the journey, often referred to as the Trail of Tears, more than 500 Chickasaw died of dysentery and smallpox.

When the Chickasaw reached Indian Territory, the United States began to administer to them through the Choctaw Nation, and later merged them for administrative reasons. The Chickasaw wrote their own constitution in the 1850s, an effort contributed to by Holmes Colbert.

After several decades of mistrust between the two peoples, in the twentieth century, the Chickasaw re-established their independent government. They are federally recognized as the Chickasaw Nation. The government is headquartered in Ada, Oklahoma.

===American Civil War (1861)===
The Chickasaw Nation was the first of the Five Civilized Tribes to become allies of the Confederate States of America. In addition, they resented the United States government, which had forced them off their lands and failed to protect them against the Plains tribes in the West. In 1861, as tensions rose related to the sectional conflict, the US Army abandoned Fort Washita, leaving the Chickasaw Nation defenseless against the Plains tribes. Confederate officials recruited the American Indian tribes with suggestions of an Indian state if they were victorious in the Civil War.

The Chickasaw passed a resolution allying with the Confederacy, which was signed by Governor Cyrus Harris on May 25, 1861.
At the beginning of the American Civil War, Albert Pike was appointed as Confederate envoy to Native Americans. In this capacity, he negotiated several treaties, including the Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws in July 1861. The treaty covered sixty-four terms, covering many subjects such as Choctaw and Chickasaw nation sovereignty, Confederate States of America citizenship possibilities and an entitled delegate in the House of Representatives of the Confederate States of America. Because the Chickasaw sided with the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War, they had to forfeit some of their land afterward. In addition, the US renegotiated their treaty, insisting on their emancipation of slaves and offering citizenship to those who wanted to stay in the Chickasaw Nation. If they returned to the United States, they would have US citizenship.

====Government====

The Chickasaws were first combined with the Choctaw Nation and their area was called the Chickasaw District. Although originally the western boundary of the Choctaw Nation extended to the 100th meridian, virtually no Chickasaw lived west of the Cross Timbers. The area was subject to continual raiding by the Indians on the Southern Plains. The United States eventually leased the area between the 100th and 98th meridians for the use of the Plains tribes. The area was referred to as the &quot;Leased District&quot;.

====Treaties====

====Post–Civil War====

Because the Chickasaw allied with the Confederacy, after the Civil War the United States government required the nation to make a new peace treaty in 1866. It included the provision that they emancipate the enslaved African Americans and provide full citizenship to those who wanted to stay in the Chickasaw Nation.

These people and their descendants became known as the Chickasaw Freedmen. Descendants of the Freedmen continue to live in Oklahoma. Today, the Choctaw-Chickasaw Freedmen Association of Oklahoma represents the interests of Freedmen descendants in both of these tribes.

But the Chickasaw Nation never granted citizenship to the Chickasaw Freedmen. The only way that African Americans could become citizens at that time was to have one or more Chickasaw parents or to petition for citizenship and go through the process available to other non-Natives, even if they were of known partial Chickasaw descent in an earlier generation. Because the Chickasaw Nation did not provide citizenship to their Freedmen after the Civil War (it would have been akin to formal adoption of individuals into the tribe), they were penalized by the U.S. Government. It took more than half of their territory, with no compensation. They lost territory that had been negotiated in treaties in exchange for their use after removal from the Southeast.

==State-recognized groups==

The Chaloklowa Chickasaw Indian People, an organization that alleges to be composed of descendants of Chickasaw who did not leave the Southeast, were recognized as a &quot;state-recognized group&quot; in 2005 by South Carolina. They are headquartered in Hemingway, South Carolina. Historian Edward J. Cashin, a professor of colonial era history and Director of the Center for the Study of Georgia History at Augusta State University, was unable to ascertain the organization&#x27;s connection to the Savannah River Chickasaws or other bands of Chickasaw. After receiving letters of complaint concerning the Chaloklowa Chickasaw Indian People&#x27;s later petition for recognition as a State Recognized tribe in October 2005, the Commission of Minority Affairs review committee, upon rereview, found that the indigenous ancestry originally being claimed by the group was incorrect. The organization remains recognized as a group as of 2023. In 2003, they unsuccessfully petitioned the US Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs to try to gain federal recognition as an Indian tribe.

== Culture ==
For many tribes in the region, corn was one of the most important foods. The Green Corn Ceremony, which occurs annually and starts when the corn crops begin to develop, usually in late June or early July, ties corn into the culture of the Chickasaw. This ceremony celebrated both the crop and the sense of community in the tribe. It was also a time of starting from scratch in a sense. Villages were cleaned, old pottery was broken, and most old fires were put out. Fasting was done by most tribes to obtain purity, and the Chickasaw specifically would fast from the afternoon of the first day of the ceremony until the second sunrise.

In 2010, the tribe opened the Chickasaw Cultural Center in Sulphur, Oklahoma. It includes the &quot;Chikasha Inchokka’&quot; Traditional Village, Honor Garden, Sky and Water pavilion, and several in-depth exhibits about the diverse culture of the Chickasaw. The Chikasha Inchokka&#x27; Traditional Village features a Council House, two winter and summer houses, a replica mound, a corn crib and a stickball field. There are often stomp dances or stickball demonstrations, and cultural performers often display traditional Chickasaw culture, including art, cooking, language and storytelling.

To the Chickasaw, the Mississippi River helped &quot;define their geographic homeland and history&quot;, and was important for trade, transportation, and irrigation. Referred to as &quot;scored bluff waterway&quot;, Chickasaw warriors limited the movement of Europeans along the river.

== Marriage traditions ==
Before marriage, a Chickasaw man would send a gift with his mother or sister to be given to the parents of the woman he would like to marry. If the parents consented, they would offer the gift to the woman. If the woman accepted, the family member of the man would return with the news of approval. The man would put on his finest clothing and apply vermilion, a paint associated with love, power, and purity. The man would go to the house of the woman he wanted to marry, and would have supper alone with his future father-in-law, without the company of the wife or mother-in-law. The bed of the wife would be prepared, and the bride would go to sleep before the groom joined. Once they were both in the same bed, they were officially married.

== Religion ==
The Chickasaw people held ancient beliefs about four &quot;Beloved Things&quot;: the sun, the clouds, the sky and Aba&#x27; Binni&#x27;li, also known as &quot;He that lives in the clear sky&quot;. He was believed to be the sole creator of light, life, and warmth. He was believed to reside both in the clouds and in the holy fire, and due to this, fire was respected. It became unlawful to extinguish any fire, even a small cooking fire, with water, as this was considered to be the work of evil spirits. Bad weather such as rain, thunder and heavy wind was thought to be holy people at war above the clouds. Warriors would fire their guns at the sky to show that they were willing to die if they could aid the holy spirits above.

== Repatriation efforts ==
After they signed the treaty of Pontotoc Creek in 1832 and were forced from their native land in Mississippi, the Chickasaw tribe immigrated to its now-home in Oklahoma. While their current residence is far from their native territory, the ancestral remains of many Chickasaw members are still located in Mississippi, Tennessee, and Alabama. Among these remains, many were excavated and stored within the Mississippi Department of Archives and History (MDAH). In 2021 the MDAH repatriated 403 Chickasaw ancestors to the tribe. The organizations director of archaeology, Meg Cook, addressed the MDAH’s efforts: “We’re doing everything that we can to reconcile the past and move forward, in a very transparent way. It’s our responsibility to tell the Mississippi story. And that means all of the bad parts, too.&quot;

== Population history ==
The tribal traditions say that the Chickasaw once had 10,000 men fit for war. In 1687 Louis Hennepin estimated the Chickasaw population as at least 4,000 warriors (and therefore at least 20,000 people). In 1702 according to Iberville there were ca. 2,000 Chickasaw families. Their number then decreased a lot during the 18th century and early 19th century, including the Trail of Tears. Indian Affairs 1836 reported the number of the Chickasaw in year 1836 at around 5,400 people (another source says that the pre-removal population was 4,914 Chickasaws and 1,156 Black slaves). A report by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs dated 25 November 1841 says that around 4,600 Chickasaws already lived in Oklahoma (Indian Territory) while around 400 stayed in the east. In 1875 the Office of Indian Affairs reported that there were around 6,000 Chickasaws. This figure of 6,000 continued to be reported in 1886 and in all subsequent reports until 1897. Indian Affairs 1910 reported that there were 5,688 Chickasaws by blood, 645 by intermarriage and 4,651 freedmen. While the census of 1910 counted only 4,204 Chickasaws.

Chickasaw population has rebounded in the 20th and 21st centuries. In 2020 they numbered 70,096 (including 32,579 in Oklahoma).

<doc id="92815" wikidata="Q5103733" url="?curid=92815" title="Choctaw mythology">
<text>Choctaw mythology is part of the culture of the Choctaw, a Native American tribe originally occupying a large territory in the present-day Southeastern United States: much of the states of Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana. In the 19th century, the Choctaw were known to European Americans as one of the &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot; even though controversy surrounds their removal.

Today the Choctaw have three federally recognized tribes: the largest is the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, next is the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, made up of descendants of individuals who did not remove in the 1830s, and the smallest is the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, located in Louisiana. Also, the Choctaw Apache Tribe of Ebarb, state recognized by Louisiana and resides in Sabine Parish, Louisiana. In addition, the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians is state-recognized by Alabama, but it has not achieved federal recognition. It, too, is made up of descendants of individuals who remained in the Southeast in the 1830s.

The Choctaw and their ancestors have lived in the Mississippi region in what is now the southeastern region of the US for centuries. Thousands of years of myth and story-making have contributed to a rich collection of history. The Choctaw continue to tell and write about their legends.

==Choctaw migration==

The Choctaw tell the following creation story of their coming to this land, and how Nanih Waiya Mound, built of earthwork by ancestors, came to be.

Two brothers, Chata and Chicksah

After travelling for a mind-bogglingly long time, they finally came to a place where the pole stood upright. In this place, they laid to rest the bones of their ancestors, which they had carried in buffalo sacks from the original land in the west.

The earthwork mound developed from that great burial. After the burial, the brothers discovered that the land could not support all the people. Chicksah took half the people and departed to the North, where they eventually emerged as the historic Chickasaw tribe.

Chata and the others remained near the mound, which became known as Nanih Waiya (The mound of all creation), and became known as the Choctaw tribe.

==Choctaw Creation story==
At the beginning there was a great mound. It was called Nanih Waiya. It was from this mound that the Creator fashioned the first of the people. These people crawled through a long, dark cave into daylight and became the first Choctaw. For many years they lived in this area until a great shift occurred. At this time a great flood arose covering the lands. The Choctaw people had to flee by canoes to an island as guided by a dove. They prospered and then over populated the island. They then traveled back to the coast of Turtle Island. Once they arrived again the people who remained were not friendly. They then traveled for hundreds of years down the coast down south. They finally traveled across what is now the Yucatán again in canoes. Once they landed up on the land of giants and fought for territory. They then rebuilt their sacred Nanih Waya and found a sacred home for their ancestor&#x27;s bones that they lovingly carried with them all those many years. (Caitlin, Letters and Notes, 1841)

==Supernatural Native America==

Some early writers, and in later times Cushman and Bushnell, report that the Choctaw believed in a great good spirit and a great evil spirit. Choctaw oral histories mentioned numerous supernatural beings. In addition to their terms for what might also be called the Great Spirit or God and the Devil, the Choctaw believed they had many other &quot;powerful beings&quot; in their midst.

=== Ancient religion===
The Great Spirit of the Choctaw was referred to by various names. Rev. Alfred Wright wrote that the Great Spirit was referred to as , , or , , and or . is a term anglicized to mean The Great Spirit. means The Great One. The terms or are applied to any person or object thought to possess some occult or superior power – such as a witch.

 is from (sun) and (to complete an action). is believed to have originated as a Choctaw term without European influence; the Choctaw were believed to be Sun worshippers. Fire was the &quot;most striking representation of the sun&quot;; it was believed to have intelligence, and was considered to be in constant communication with the Sun.

===Interactions between animals and people===

The Choctaw venerated , a horned serpent that visited unusually wise young men.

===Little people and other human-like creatures===
They believed in a little man, about two feet high, who dwelled alone in the thick, dark woods. The little man was called or , both names being used alone or together. The translation of is the &quot;Thrower&quot;. The translation of is &quot;The one who stays in the woods&quot;, or to give a more concise translation, &quot;Forest dweller&quot;. Little man can be compared to the European counterparts- dwarfs, elves, gnomes, and leprechauns.

The little wood sprite () was known to be rather mischievous, but not malicious. The Choctaw believed that he often playfully threw sticks and stones at them. All unexplained sounds heard in the woods were attributed to Bohpoli. The Choctaw believed that he took a special pleasure in hitting the pine trees to create noise.

 was never seen by the common Choctaw, only by the prophets and shaman. The Indian shamans or doctors would report that Bohpoli assisted them in creating their medicines. Some stories said that would &quot;steal&quot; little children and take them into the woods, to teach them about herbs and medicines. After returning the children to their homes, would leave them alone, letting them grow up to become doctors of the tribe.

Some of the history writings refer to , a combination of man and deer who delighted in frightening hunters. He was much admired for his speed and agility. If the Choctaw angered , he would race ahead of them and warn the enemy or animals being hunted.

 or (white people of the water) dwelled in deep pools and had light skins like the skins of trout. They were believed to sometimes capture human beings, whom they converted into beings like themselves.

 was a bad spirit who could assume any shape it desired; it was believed to read people&#x27;s thoughts.

===Shadow-like beings===
The Choctaw have stories about shadow beings. , also known as a , was the soul-eater, a great black being. If individuals allowed evil thoughts or depression to enter their minds, would creep inside them and eat their souls. Many people of Choctaw Nation will not say his name, in fear of summoning the spirit.

 (long black being) resembled a man, but with very small eyes and long, pointed ears. He sometimes frightened hunters or transferred his power of doing harm. Some believed that preferred to approach men by sliding on his stomach like a snake.

 (Grass Water Drop) was believed to have a connection to what is termed will-o-the-wisp. Only its heart is visible, and that only at night. leads astray anyone who looks at it.

It was also believed that every man had a (the outside shadow) which always followed him, and (the inside shadow, or ghost) which after death goes to the land of ghosts. The was supposed to remain upon the earth, and wander restlessly about its former home, often moaning, to frighten its surviving friends. It tried to make them forsake the spot, and seek another place to live. It was also supposed to assume the form of a fox, or owl; and by barking like the one, and screeching like the other at night, cause great consternation, for the cry was considered ominous of bad things. The Choctaw could differentiate between the and the animals it imitates. When a fox barks, or an owl screeches, another fox or owl replies. But when the imitates the sound of either animal, no response is heard. The shadow-like beings would often stalk children of younger adult age.

The is a creature that is neither man nor beast. While having the legs and hoofs of a deer, its body is that of a man. His head and face are small and shriveled, and it is said that a person who looks at it will be visited by evil. When hunters go near the swamps it inhabits, it sneaks behind them to call loudly before quickly fleeing. Although it does not harm man, it takes delight in their fright as it yells a sound that resembles a woman&#x27;s scream. For that reason it was named (, &quot;woman&quot;; , &quot;call&quot;).

===Birds of the dark===
, or the horned owl, was believed to prowl about at night killing men and animals. Many believed that when screeched, it meant sudden death, such as a murder. If the (screech owl) was heard, it was a sign that a child under seven in the family was going to die. Such a child was likened to a small owl. If (a common owl) perched in a barn or on trees near the house and hooted, its call was a foreboding of death among the near relatives of the residents.

, the sapsucker, was known as the news bird. If he landed on a tree in a family&#x27;s yard early in the morning, some &quot;hasty&quot; news would come before noon. If he perched there late at night, the news would come before morning.

===Animal-explained occurrences===
Animals figure significantly in Choctaw mythology, as they do in most Native American myth cycles. For example, in Choctaw history, solar eclipses were attributed to black squirrels, and maize was a gift from the birds.

 (thunder) and (lightning) were responsible for the dramatic thunderstorms. In Choctaw mythology, they were two huge birds. would lay her giant eggs in the clouds, and they would rumble as they rolled around atop the clouds. Despite his size, her mate, , was extremely fast and left a trail of sparks as he streaked across the sky.

== Mythological tales ==

=== Origin of Poison ===
In a shallow pool of water where the Choctaw people would bathe, there was a poison vine. All that would touch the vine would die. The vine liked the Choctaw people and did not want them to die, but could not warn them when its poison would infect the water. It decided to rid itself of its poison and called the chiefs of the snakes, bees, and wasps because they had all been trampled on and accidentally killed by the men. The chiefs of these small creatures came to an agreement to take and share the vine&#x27;s poison among themselves as a warning and deterrent against being trampled.

The bees were the first to take the poison, and said that they will take a small amount so as to protect their hives. They too liked the Choctaw people and did not want to kill them with the poison. To show that they were not man&#x27;s enemy, the bees promised that, after they had been forced to use their stinger, they would die.

The next to take the poison were the wasps, who said they would buzz in the ear of man as a warning before they attacked to protect their nests.

Finally, the snakes took the rest of the poison. They promised that they would always warn man with their rattle before they strike, in order to give man a chance to flee.

From then on, it was only the foolish persons who did not heed the warnings of the small, who were hurt from the vine&#x27;s poison.

=== Brothers Tashka and Walo ===
Two brothers named Tashka and Walo followed the sun for many years from childhood to adulthood. They would follow it throughout its life in the day, until it died over the horizon in the evening. One day, the sun rested over a great expanse of water, and the boys swam into it, going underneath.

They emerged in the home of the sun, finding women all around. These women were the moon and the stars. The moon was the sun&#x27;s wife and asked the brothers how they entered this realm. The brothers said that they followed the sun for many years since they were boys. The sun then told his wife to boil water, and he placed the brothers in it, keeping them there until their skin fell off. The sun asked if they knew their way back home. The boys replied &quot;no&quot;, as they looked over the edge of the sky, seeing land, but were not able to discern their home from such a height.

The sun asked why they had followed him for all these years, to which the brothers replied only to see where he had died. The sun agreed to send them home, but instructed them not to talk for four days after they returned, or they would surely die. He called a giant buzzard to fly them home, and after they had landed, an old man recognized them and went to tell their mother. The mother, frightened since she had not seen them for many days, made them tell her where they had been. They told her of their journey and said that they will now surely die because they did not keep their promise to the sun of silence for four days.

After this the mother was very worried, but they all returned home. The brothers told the tales of the many years they had followed the sun. After telling all of what they knew, they died and entered heaven.

=== Dog&#x27;s Lifespan ===
Soon after the Great Spirit created all the animals and humans, he asked each how long their lives should be. The dog was the first to respond, excited by the promise of a long life, and asked for 10 years. The rest of the animals did not know how long they wanted, so the spirit gave them the years he thought was best.

He gave humans three centuries of life and told the dog that, although its life was short, its quality of life will be determined by its master. If the master was good to the dog, feeding, loving, and caring for it, it will prosper and live long. If the master neglected and abused it, it will live a short and miserable life.

===Origin of Grasshoppers and Ants===
During the emergence from , the grasshoppers journeyed with man to reach the surface and spread in all directions. But in the travel to the surface, the mother of the grasshoppers was stepped on by the men, which stopped the rest of her children from reaching the surface. Those already above ground spread in all directions, just as the first tribes of man had done. From then on the Choctaw called the creatures (&quot;mother dead&quot;).

As the men emerged from the hill and spread throughout the lands, they would trample on many other grasshoppers, killing and harming the orphaned children. Fearing that they would all be killed as the men multiplied while continuing to emerge from , the grasshoppers pleaded to , the great spirit, for aid. Soon after, closed the passageway, trapping many men within the cavern who had yet to reach the surface.

In an act of mercy, transformed these men into ants, allowing them to rule the caverns in the ground for the rest of history.

== Choctaw legends ==

=== The Hunter of the Sun ===

The hunter of the Sun is a myth about what happens to the Sun when it disappears. None of the prophets or chief leaders could answer this question. A young man embarked on a mission to understand what happens to the Sun when it sets. He left his family, community, and country to dedicate his life to answering this question. He said he would one day return with the answer to this question. Many years passed—the young men became old and the old men died—and people continued to talk about him. He finally returned, as an old man, with the answer to this question. He journeyed to the ocean and found that the sun sets and rises from the water. After sharing this, the old man died.
Before the existence of man, there was a hill that had a path to the center of the Earth. Animals began populating the Earth; plants, trees, rivers, and the raw environment began to form. When the Choctaw people emerged at the top of the hill from the passageway called the , they experienced the light of the Sun. After emerging, they scattered throughout the lands.

More information on Myths and Sacred Stories

The book &quot;Choctaw Tales,&quot; by Tom Mould and Chief Phillip Martin, explains how difficult it could be to pass down sacred stories through the generations in the Choctaw Nation, while keeping the story accurate as possible. Storytelling can be difficult if someone is not sharing the same accurate information. Storytelling is important to the Choctaw Nation and many other Indigenous groups because the person sharing the story helps the younger generation understand their history and people. If the story is told inaccurately, it will lose its value. Storytelling is very beneficial in the Choctaw Nation to share Choctaw legacies because it helps people get a better understanding of their culture.

For example, before the creation of a written language, history was established by sacred myths, legend, and personal reminiscences. These sacred myths were the record of the history of the Choctaw and many other Indigenous groups, as they were for other cultures around the world. During these sacred stories and myths, names were mentioned, but dates were hardly included. An example was Choctaw Chief Pushmataha. While he is known to have lived from 1764 to 1824, the stories told about him emphasize his character and the influence he had on people&#x27;s lives. They are stories told by family members to others close to them. If accounts are told by people outside his circle, the stories lose their passion.

<text>Kennewick Man or Ancient One was a Native American man who lived during the early Holocene, whose skeletal remains were found washed out on a bank of the Columbia River in Kennewick, Washington, on July 28, 1996. Radiocarbon tests show the man lived about 8,400 to 8,690 years Before Present, making his skeleton one of the most complete ever found this old in the Americas, and thus of high scientific interest for understanding the peopling of the Americas.

The discovery precipitated a nearly twenty-year-long dispute involving the Federal government, Native Americans, and the science community. The Federal government, through the United States Army Corps of Engineers, held jurisdiction over the land where the remains were found and thus had legal custody. However, Native American tribes asserted legal rights to rebury the man under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), a federal law to repatriate Indian remains. Nevertheless, some members of the scientific community believed it was essential to conduct research on the skeleton, and asserted he was only distantly related to today&#x27;s Native Americans and was more closely related to Polynesian or Southeast Asian peoples, which would exempt the case from NAGPRA.

The controversial case wound its way through courts for many years, including a period when scientists won access to study the remains. At the same time, technology for analyzing ancient DNA had been steadily improving; in June 2015, scientists at the University of Copenhagen published a study of Kennewick Man&#x27;s sequenced genome, which found that Kennewick Man is within a diverse group of contemporary Native Americans, though he is not associated with any specific modern tribe. This finding, that he is of Native American background, gave decisive weight to the NAGPRA argument. In September 2016, the US House and Senate passed legislation to return the remains to a coalition of Columbia basin tribes. Kennewick Man was buried according to Indian traditions on February 18, 2017, with 200 members of five Columbia basin tribes in attendance, at an undisclosed location in the area. Within the scientific community since the 1990s, arguments for a non-Indian ancient history of the Americas, including by ancient peoples from Europe, have been losing ground in the face of ancient DNA analysis. The identification of Kennewick Man as closely related to modern Native Americans symbolically marked the &quot;end of a [supposed] non-Indian ancient North America&quot;.

==Discovery==
Kennewick Man was discovered by accident by two college students, Will Thomas and David Deacy, on July 28, 1996. They were at the Columbia River to watch a hydroplane race near Kennewick. Thomas was wading in about of water, about from shore, when his foot struck something hard and round. He pulled up a human skull. They stashed it in the bushes, waited for the race to finish, then found a plastic bucket and took the skull to a Kennewick police officer. The police returned with the students to the location. Further searching found more bones underwater and along the shore. The county coroner determined the skull was not modern, and it was given to archaeologist James Chatters, who over the course of ten visits to the site, assembled 350 bones and bone fragments creating a nearly complete articulated skeleton.

==Scientific analysis==
===Description===
The cranium was fully intact including all of its teeth from the time of death. All major bones were found except the sternum and a few in the hands and feet. After further study, Chatters concluded it was &quot;a male of late middle age (40–55 years), and tall (170 to 176 cm, 5′7″ to 5′9″), and was fairly muscular with a slender build&quot;. The Owsley team in 2005 reported he may have been as young as 38 at the time of death.

A small bone fragment submitted to the University of California, Riverside for radiocarbon dating estimated he lived between 9,300 and 9,600 years ago (8,400 uncalibrated &quot;radiocarbon years&quot;), and not the 19th century, as had originally been thought. Subsequent radiocarbon dating indicated a somewhat younger age of 8,900 to 9,000 years BP, and later 8,400 to 8,690 calibrated years Before Present.

===Geography===
Measurements of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotope ratios in the bone collagen indicate that the man lived almost exclusively on a diet of marine mammals for the last 20 or so years of his life, and that the water he drank was glacial melt. The closest marine coastal environment where this water could have been found during his lifetime was in Alaska. That, combined with the location of the find, led to the conclusion that the individual led a highly mobile, water-borne lifestyle centered on the northern coast.

===Injuries===
Chatters found a stone projectile lodged in his ilium (part of the pelvic bone). There was new bone growing around it indicating a painful but old wound. Chatters made a CT scan which determined the projectile was made from a siliceous gray stone with igneous (volcanic) origins. The projectile, leaf-shaped, long, and broad, with serrated edges, fit the description of a Cascade point, characteristic of the Cascade phase from 12,000 to 7,500 years BP.

Forensic anthropologist Douglas Owsley, who later led the scientific team that examined Kennewick Man&#x27;s skeleton in 2005, discovered that the bones in Kennewick Man&#x27;s arms were bent. Owsley theorized that this was the result of powerful muscles built up over the course of a lifetime of hunting and spearfishing. Kennewick Man was found to be right-handed, as the bones of the right arm are noticeably larger than the left.

Owsley also found that Kennewick Man had arthritis in his right elbow, both of his knees, and several vertebrae but not severe enough to be crippling. Kennewick Man had suffered some trauma in his lifetime, which was evident by a fractured rib that had healed, a depression fracture on his forehead, and a similar indentation on the left side of the head, and a spear jab that healed.

===Genetic and cultural origins===
Chatters, who initially investigated the skeleton, early on concluded that the &quot;presence of Caucasoid traits [and a] lack of definitive Native-American characteristics&quot;, as well as the apparent context of the skeleton as part of an early Paleo-American group led him to state that the body was &quot;Caucasian&quot; (an anthropological term not synonymous with &quot;white&quot; or &quot;European&quot;).

Scientists attempted DNA analysis within a few years of discovery, but reported &quot;available technology and protocols do not allow the analysis of ancient DNA from these remains&quot; ie. multiple experts were unable to extract enough DNA for analysis.

Chatters &quot;et al.&quot; (2000) conducted a graphic comparison, including size, of Kennewick Man to eighteen modern populations. They found Kennewick Man to be most closely related to the Ainu, a recognized indigenous people of Northern Japan. However, when size was excluded as a factor, no association to any population was established. In 2001, Chatters wrote that the &quot;craniofacial characteristics of Paleo-Americans, Asians, and early Europeans, loosely resemble the Ainu, Polynesian, and Australian peoples&quot;, but that no group was the major contributor to the Paleo-American gene pool. Anthropologist C. Loring Brace maintained in a 2006 interview that, by his analysis, Kennewick Man was &quot;likely related&quot; to the Ainu of Japan.

Anthropologist Joseph Powell of the University of New Mexico was also allowed to examine the remains. Powell used craniometric data obtained by anthropologist William White Howells of Harvard University and anthropologist Tsunehiko Hanihara of Saga University; this had the advantage of including data drawn from Asian and North American populations. Powell said that Kennewick Man was not European but most resembled the Ainu and Polynesians. Powell said that the Ainu descend from the Jōmon people, an East Asian population with &quot;closest biological affinity with south-east Asians rather than western Eurasian peoples&quot;. Powell said that dental analysis showed the skull to have a 94-percent consistency with being of a Sundadont group like the Ainu and Polynesians and only a 48-percent consistency with being of a Sinodont group like that of North Asia. Powell said analysis of the skull showed it to be &quot;unlike American Indians and Europeans&quot;. Powell concluded that the remains were &quot;clearly not a Caucasoid unless Ainu and Polynesians are considered Caucasoid&quot;.

Later studies criticised claims made about the ancestry of the Kennewick Man purely based on skull morphology, noting that a single skull is too small a sample size to accurately determine affinities with any degree of certainty, and that the Kennewick Man&#x27;s skull morphology falls within the variation of known Native American skulls.

Advances in genetic research made it possible to analyze ancient DNA (aDNA) more accurately than earlier attempts when the skeleton was found. In June 2015, a study was published which analysed his sequenced nuclear genome, which concluded that his genome was nested within the diversity of contemporary Native Americans. The study concluded Kennewick Man belonged to a population closely related to contemporary Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest, including Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. Of the five tribes that originally claimed Kennewick Man as an ancestor, their members were the only ones to donate DNA samples for evaluation. The low sequencing depth (approximately 1x) of the Kennewick Man&#x27;s genome, along lack of genomes from North American aboriginal populations have made it impossible to ascertain Kennewick Man&#x27;s nearest living relatives among regional Native American tribes. His Y-DNA haplogroup is Q-M3 and his mitochondrial DNA is X2a, both uniparental genetic markers found almost exclusively in Native Americans.

===Burial===
Kennewick Man had been buried deliberately. By examining the calcium carbonate left behind as underground water collected on the underside of the bones and then evaporated, scientists were able to conclude that Kennewick Man was lying on his back with his feet rolled slightly outward and his arms at his side, with the palms facing down, a position that could not have been accidental.

==Scientific initiatives and significance==
===Scientific initiatives===
There have been three major scientific initiatives to study and report on Kennewick Man.

Between 1998 and 2000, the Department of the Interior and National Park Service, in cooperation with the Corps of Engineers, the federal agency responsible for the Kennewick remains, conducted a series of scientific examinations of the remains. Eighteen nationally and internationally recognized scientists and scholars conducted a variety of historical and scientific examinations, analyses, tests, and studies. Nevertheless, the &quot;analysis was quickly suspended by the U.S. government&quot; because of the controversy over custodianship of the remains.

After the suspension of the government studies, anthropologists sued the government, and in 2002 won the right to study the bones. For the next six years beginning in 2005, Douglas Owsley of the Smithsonian Institution coordinated more than a dozen experts, who analyzed the bones in numerous ways including forensic anthropology, physical anthropology, and isotope chemistry. Their report was published in 2014, in the book titled &quot;Kennewick Man, The Scientific Investigation of an Ancient American Skeleton&quot;.

In 2015, a paper in &quot;Nature&quot; titled &quot;The Ancestry and Affiliations of Kennewick Man&quot; analyzed ancient DNA from Kennewick Man, and determined he is associated with modern day Indians.

===Scientific significance===
According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;Scientists have found only about 50 skeletons of such antiquity, most of them fragmentary. Any new find can thus add crucial insight into the ongoing mystery of who first colonized the New World.&quot;

Since the mid-1990s within the science community, &quot;Palaeoamericans&quot; have vied with &quot;Palaeoindians&quot; over the identity of the first people of the Americas. &quot;Palaeoamericans&quot; posit the earliest inhabitants are not related to modern day Indians, possibly they were Asians from an extinct lineage, or even from Europe. &quot;Palaeoindians&quot; assert modern Indians are the descendants of the earliest settlers of North America. Kennewick Man, and DNA from other ancient skeletons, has played a significant role in eroding Palaeoamerican theories. Kennewick Man&#x27;s DNA results mark an &quot;end of a [supposed] non-Indian ancient North America&quot;.

The discovery of Kennewick Man, along with other ancient skeletons, has furthered scientific debate over the origin and history of early Native American people. One hypothesis holds that a single source of migration occurred, consisting of hunters and gatherers following large herds of game who wandered across the Bering land bridge. An alternative hypothesis is that more than one source population was involved in migration immediately following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which occurred ~22k to ~18k years BP, and that the land migration through Beringia was either preceded by or roughly synchronous with a waterborne migration from coastal Asia.

The similarity of some ancient skeletal remains in the Americas, such as Kennewick Man, to coastal Asian phenotypes is suggestive of more than one migration source. Classification of DNA from ancient skeletons such as Kennewick Man and others of similar phenotype may or may not reveal genetic affiliation between them, with either Beringian or coastal Asian source populations.

Regardless of the debate over whether there were more than one source of migration following the LGM, Kennewick Man has yielded insight into the marine lifestyle and mobility of early coastal migrants.

===Owsley study criticisms===
In 2012, Burke Museum archeologists voiced concern and criticism of the Owsley team&#x27;s preliminary findings (not published fully until 2014). First, it was noted that no one outside of Owsley&#x27;s team had an opportunity to examine the Smithsonian&#x27;s data to see how the team reached its conclusions. Second, the absence of peer-reviewed articles published prior to Owsley unveiling the bones&#x27; &quot;secrets&quot; was criticized. Third, Owsley&#x27;s non-Native argument hinged on the assumption that Kennewick Man&#x27;s skull was a reliable means of assessing ancestry. This was a &quot;nineteenth-century skull science paradigm&quot;, said David Hurst Thomas, a curator at the American Museum of Natural History. Skulls are no longer used as the basis for classifying remains, as DNA evidence is more reliable.

===Racial issues===
In 2005, author Jack Hitt wrote an essay &quot;Mighty White of You: Racial Preferences Color America&#x27;s Oldest Skulls and Bones&quot;, in which he describes a systemic &quot;racial preference&quot; for Kennewick Man, and other old skeletons, to be of European origin. If this theory held true (and DNA evidence shows it does not), it would turn the tables on Indian claims of being the first inhabitants, white Europeans would be the victims of Indian invaders, and politically modern Indians would have less claim to sovereignty.

The use of the word &quot;Caucasoid&quot; to describe Kennewick Man, and his facial reconstruction that appeared plausibly European, were taken by many to mean that Kennewick Man was &quot;Caucasian&quot;, European, or &quot;white&quot;, rather than an ancestor of present-day Native Americans, although the term &quot;Caucasoid&quot; had also been applied to the Ainu of northern Japan. In 1998, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported &quot;White supremacist groups are among those who used Kennewick Man to claim that Caucasians came to America well before Native Americans.&quot; Additionally, Asatru Folk Assembly, a racialist neopagan organization, sued to have the bones genetically tested before it was adjudicated that Kennewick Man was an ancestor of present-day Native Americans.

==Custody of Kennewick Man==
In October 1998, the remains were deposited at the Burke Museum at the University of Washington. The Burke Museum was the court-appointed neutral repository for the remains, and did not exhibit them. They were then still legally the property of the US Army Corps of Engineers, as they were found on land under its custody.

According to NAGPRA, if human remains are found on federal lands and their cultural affiliation to a Native American tribe can be established, the affiliated tribe may claim them. Two months after discovery in 1996, the Umatilla tribe requested custody of the remains so they could be reburied according to tribal tradition. It was contested by researchers who believed Kennewick Man was not affiliated with modern Indians. The Umatilla argued that their oral history goes back 10,000 years, and they had been present on the territory since the dawn of time. Native American tribes asserted that the claims that Kennewick Man was of non-Indian origin was an attempt to evade the law governing custodianship of ancient bones. The Corps of Engineers and the Clinton administration supported the Native American claim in what became a long-running lawsuit.

Robson Bonnichsen and seven other anthropologists sued the United States for the right to conduct research. The anthropologists won the case in 2002, and on February 4, 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit panel rejected an appeal brought by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Umatilla, Colville, Yakama, Nez Perce, and other tribes on the grounds that they were unable to show sufficient evidence of kinship. Furthermore, the presiding judge found that the US government had acted in bad faith and awarded attorney&#x27;s fees of $2,379,000 to the plaintiffs.

On April 7, 2005, during the 109th Congress, United States senator John McCain introduced an amendment to NAGPRA, which (section 108) would have changed the definition of &quot;Native American&quot; from being that which &quot;is indigenous to the United States&quot; to &quot;is or was indigenous to the United States&quot;. However, the 109th Congress concluded without enacting the bill. By the bill&#x27;s definition, Kennewick Man would have been classified as Native American regardless of whether any link to a contemporary tribe could be found.

===Reburial===
In September 2016, in light of new DNA evidence associating Kennewick Man with modern day Native Americans, the 114th US House and Senate passed legislation to return the ancient bones to a coalition of Columbia Basin tribes. The coalition included the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, and the Wanapum Band of Priest Rapids.

The remains of Kennewick Man were cataloged and removed from the Burke Museum on February 17, 2017. The following day, more than 200 members of five Columbia Plateau tribes were present at a burial of the remains, according to their traditions, at an undisclosed location.

<text>Muscogee mythology (previously referred to by its exonym &quot;Creek&quot;) is related to a Muscogee tribe who are originally from the southeastern United States, also known by their original name Mvskoke (or Muskogee), the name they use to identify themselves today. &quot;Mvskoke&quot; is their name in traditional spelling. Modern Muscogees live primarily in Oklahoma, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. Their language, &quot;Mvskoke&quot;, is a member of the Eastern branch of the Muskogean language family. The Seminole are close kin to the Mvskoke and speak an Eastern Muskogean language as well. The Muscogee were considered one of the Five Civilized Tribes. After the Creek War many of the Muscogee escaped to Florida to create the Seminole.

==History==
The early historic Muscogee were probably descendants of the Mississippian culture peoples who lived along the Tennessee River, in what is now modern Tennessee and Alabama, and possibly related to the Utinahica of southern Georgia. More of a loose confederacy than a single tribe, the Mvskoke lived in autonomous villages in river valleys throughout what are today the states of Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama also consisted of many ethnic groups speaking several distinct languages, such as the Hitchiti, Alabama, and Coushatta. Those who lived along the Ocmulgee River and the Oconee River were called &quot;Creek Indians&quot; by British traders from South Carolina; eventually the name was applied to all of the various natives of creek towns, becoming increasingly divided between the Lower Towns of the Georgia frontier on the Chattahoochee River (see Apalachicola Province), Ocmulgee River, and Flint River and the Upper Towns of the Alabama River Valley.

The Lower Towns included Coweta, Cusseta (Kasihta, Cofitachequi), Upper Chehaw (Chiaha), Hitchiti, Oconee, Ocmulgee, Okawaigi, Apalachicola, Yamasee (Altamaha), Ocfuskee, Sawokli, and Tamali. The Upper Towns included Tuckabatchee, Abihka, Coosa (Kusa; the dominant people of East Tennessee and North Georgia during the Spanish explorations), Itawa (original inhabitants of the Etowah Indian Mounds), Hothliwahi (Ullibahali), Hilibi, Eufaula, Wakokai, Atasi, Alibamu, Coushatta (Koasati; they had absorbed the Kaski/Casqui and the Tali), and Tuskegee (&quot;Napochi&quot; in the de Luna chronicles).

Cusseta (Kasihta) and Coweta are the two principal towns of the Muscogee Nation to this day. Traditionally the Cusseta and Coweta bands are considered to the earliest members of the Muscogee Nation.

==Creation==
The Muscogee believe that the world was originally entirely underwater. The only land was a hill called Nunne Chaha on which is the home of 
Hesaketvmese (meaning &quot;master of breath&quot;; pronounced Hisakita imisi), a solar deity also called Epofvnkv (&quot;the one who is sitting above (us)&quot;). He created humanity from the clay on the hill.

In the underworld, there was only chaos and odd creatures. Master of Breath created Brother Moon and Sister Sun, as well as the four directions to hold up the world. The Muscogee also venerate the Horned Serpent Sint Holo, who appeared to suitably wise young men. The first people were the offspring of Sister Sun and the Horned Serpent. These first two Muscogee were Lucky Hunter and Corn Woman, denoting their respective roles in Muscogee Society.

<text>Rafael José Diaz (born April 22, 1955) is a Puerto Rican actor, singer and television host.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Rafael was born in Manatí, Puerto Rico, where his father, a physician born in the Dominican Republic, was the medical director of the local hospital. His family eventually moved to Mayagüez in Western Puerto Rico where he grew up. While living in Mayagüez he sang and acted in various amateur radio and television broadcasts, as well as in high school talent shows. His reputation as a powerful singer followed him to San Juan, Puerto Rico, while attending medical school. His family supported his singing career on the condition that he finished the dentistry program at the University of Puerto Rico School of Dental Medicine. He interrupted his studies for close to eight years when his singing career took off, but eventually finished his degree and became a dentist (although he rarely practices his profession nowadays).

=== OTI Festival ===
In 1978, he was selected by Telemundo to represent Puerto Rico in the seventh edition of the OTI Festival, which was held in Santiago, Chile. His song entitled &quot;Háblame&quot; (Talk to me), which was warmly received by the audience and by the international jurors gave him the fourth place.

In 1980, he won the ninth edition of the Festival OTI, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with his interpretation of the song &quot;Contigo Mujer&quot;, which scored 36 points in the event and became an instant hit all over the Puerto Rican radio. The song was composed by singer Ednita Nazario (Who had represented Puerto Rico in the same festival the previous year) and Laureano Brizuela. Another radio hit was &quot;Yo Quiero Hacerte Olvidar&quot;, the theme song for the telenovela &quot;Martha Llorens&quot;.

=== New projects ===
He soon began acting on television in various telenovelas and in 1983 became co-host of the Saturday night program &quot;A Millón&quot;, along with Héctor Marcano and Sonia Noemí on WAPA-TV. He proved to be a talented TV host and lasted there for various seasons. During this time, he and his then wife, actress Magali Carrasquillo, had a son, Juan Pablo.

In 1986, he joined Roberto Vigoreaux in hosting another WAPA-TV game show, &quot;Sabado En Grande&quot;, when &quot;A Millón&quot; was moved to Sunday nights. During this time, he also performed with Antonio Sánchez in the hit sitcoms &quot;El Cuartel de la Risa&quot; and &quot;Adultos Solteros&quot;. In the late 90s, he was hired as a television host by Univision in Miami, Florida.

José then became a recognizable face with Latino audiences in the United States with the movie showcase program &quot;Tu Pelicula&quot;. Later on he joined the morning show &quot;¡Despierta América!&quot;, along with Fernando Arau, Ana María Canseco, Neyda Sandoval and fellow Puerto Rican Giselle Blondet. In 1998, Jose covered the 1998 Fifa World Cup as a commentator for Univision.

In 2005, he started hosting Univision-Puerto Rico&#x27;s successful night show Anda Pa&#x27;l Cara. At present, he is a co-host of the night program &quot;Que Noche&quot; on WIPR-TV in San Juan.

In 2013 he starred in the Puerto Rican premiere of Jerry Herman&#x27;s La Cage Aux Folles as Albin/Zaza, opening in August 2013 at the Luis A Ferré Performing Arts Center in San Juan.

In 2018, José joined WAPA as one of the show hosts and television reporters of variety show &quot;Lo sé todo&quot; where he remained until 2019 when he shifted to the station&#x27;s daytime variety show !Viva La Tarde! alongside Tita Guerrero and Jaime Mayol where he currently (as of 2023) remains as host.

<text>Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. is an American multinational hospitality company that manages and franchises a broad portfolio of hotels, resorts, and timeshare properties. Founded by Conrad Hilton in May 1919, the company is now led by Christopher J. Nassetta. Hilton is headquartered in Tysons, Virginia, United States.

As of December 31, 2023, the company&#x27;s portfolio includes 7,530 properties (including timeshare properties) with 1,182,937 rooms in 118 countries and territories. Hilton owns or leases 51 properties, manages 800 properties, and franchises out 6,679 properties to independent franchisees or companies.

Hilton has 22 brands across different market segments, including Conrad Hotels &amp; Resorts, Canopy by Hilton, Curio, Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts, DoubleTree by Hilton, Embassy Suites by Hilton, Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton by Hilton, Homewood Suites by Hilton, Home2 Suites by Hilton, Hilton Grand Vacations Club, Hilton Vacation Club, Hilton Club, LXR Hotels and Resorts by Hilton, Waldorf Astoria Hotels &amp; Resorts, Signia by Hilton, Tru by Hilton, Tapestry Collection by Hilton, Tempo by Hilton, Motto by Hilton, and Spark by Hilton.

On December 12, 2013, Hilton again became a public company, raising an estimated $2.35 billion in its second IPO. At the time, Blackstone Inc. held a 45.8 percent stake in the company. In October 2016, China&#x27;s HNA Group agreed to acquire a 25 percent equity interest in Hilton from Blackstone. The transaction was expected to close in the first quarter of 2017. Hilton&#x27;s largest stockholders were until mid-2018 HNA Group, Blackstone, and Wellington Management Company, which as of March 2017 owned 25%, 15.2%, and 6.7% of Hilton common stock respectively.

The company was founded by Conrad Hilton in 1919 as Hilton Hotels Corporation in Cisco, Texas, and it had its headquarters in Beverly Hills, California, from 1969 until 2009. In August 2009, the company moved to Tysons Corner, unincorporated Fairfax County, Virginia, near McLean.

== History ==
===Foundation and early years===
In 1919, Conrad Hilton purchased his first hotel, the 40-room Mobley Hotel in Cisco, Texas, and bought additional Texas hotels as the years passed.

In 1925, the Dallas Hilton became the first hotel to use the Hilton name. In 1927, Hilton expanded to Waco, Texas, where he opened the first hotel with air-conditioning in public areas and cold running water.

In 1943, Hilton assumed management of the Roosevelt Hotel and purchased the Plaza Hotel, both well-established high-end luxury hotels less than a mile apart in New York City&#x27;s Midtown Manhattan neighborhood. With this pair of acquisitions, Hilton established the first hospitality company to span the contiguous United States.

The company was incorporated in 1946 as the Hilton Hotels Corporation and subsequently began public trading of shares on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1947, the Roosevelt Hotel became the first hotel in the world to have televisions in its rooms.

In 1947, Hilton assumed management of the Palacio Hilton hotel in Chihuahua, Mexico, which became the chain&#x27;s first international property. That same year, they assumed management of four hotels on the island of Bermuda.

Hilton International was founded as a wholly-owned subsidiary in 1948, just before the 1949 opening of the Caribe Hilton Hotel in Puerto Rico. Barman Ramon &quot;Monchito&quot; Marreno claimed he created the piña colada cocktail at this resort. Hilton purchased The Waldorf-Astoria in New York in the same year.

===Hilton in the 1950s - 1980s===

In 1953, Hilton opened its first hotel in Europe, the Castellana Hilton in Madrid, Spain.

The Hotels Statler Company was acquired in 1954 for $111 million in what was then the world&#x27;s most expensive real estate transaction. 

Hilton is credited with several early innovations. In 1954, Hilton created the world&#x27;s first central reservations office, titled &quot;HILCRON&quot;. The reservations team in 1955 consisted of eight members on staff booking reservations for any of Hilton&#x27;s then 28 hotels. Reservations agents used the &quot;availability board&quot; to track records. The chalkboard measured by and allowed HILCRON to make over 6,000 reservations in 1955. Bookings could be made for any Hilton via telephone, telegram, or Teletype. Later in 1955, Hilton launched a program to ensure every hotel room would include air conditioning. Hilton is also credited with pioneering the airport hotel concept with the opening of the Hilton Inn at San Francisco International Airport in 1959.

International expansion continued in this era. In late 1955, Hilton opened the Istanbul Hilton, the first post–World War II property in Istanbul, Turkey. In 1957, Hilton assumed management of its first hotel in Central America, the El Panama Hilton in Panama City, Panama. In 1958, Hilton opened its first hotel in Canada, The Queen Elizabeth in Montreal, Quebec. In 1959, Hilton opened its first hotel in Africa, the Nile Hilton in Cairo, Egypt. In 1960, Hilton opened its first hotel in Oceania, the Chevron Hilton in Sydney, Australia. In 1961, Hilton assumed management of its first hotel in South America, the Hotel Carrera in Santiago, Chile. In 1963, Hilton opened its first hotels in Asia, the Hong Kong Hilton and the Tokyo Hilton, and the Royal Tehran Hilton.

In 1965, Hilton launched Lady Hilton, the first hotel concept created specifically for women guests. To appeal to female travelers, many properties offered floors occupied by only women along with distinct amenities for their usage.

The iconic Hilton hotel logo, which features the stylized &quot;H&quot; in a circle, was created in 1969 by the legendary graphic designer Saul Bass. Bass was also responsible for designing logos for other well-known brands, including AT&amp;T, United Airlines, and the Girl Scouts of the USA.

Between 1970 and 1971, Hilton acquired the International Leisure Company, including the International Hotel and the Flamingo Hotel, which were renamed the Las Vegas Hilton and the Flamingo Hilton. The properties would become the first in the domestic gaming business to be listed on the NYSE.

In 1977, Hilton International opened its first property behind the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; in Communist Europe, the Budapest Hilton.

In 1979, founder Conrad Hilton died at the age of 91. Hilton Hotels Corporation later created the Conrad Hotels brand in honor of Hilton.

Hilton Honors (formerly Hilton HHonors), the company&#x27;s guest loyalty program, was initiated in 1987. In 1994, the Honors surpassed competing hotel loyalty programs by offering members both hotel credit points and airline credit miles.

In 1998, Hilton spun off its gambling operations into a separate, publicly held company called Park Place Entertainment (later Caesars Entertainment, Inc.) In 1999, Hilton acquired Promus Hotel Corporation, which included the DoubleTree, Red Lion, Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn, and Homewood Suites brands.

=== Two chains with one name ===
The company spun off its international operations into a separately traded company on December 1, 1964, known as &quot;Hilton International Co.&quot; It was acquired in 1967 by Trans World Corp., the holding company for Trans World Airlines. 

As a result, there were two separate, fully independent companies operating hotels under the Hilton name. Because the two chains were contractually forbidden to operate hotels in the other&#x27;s territory under the Hilton name, for many years hotels run by Hilton International in the U.S. were called Vista International Hotels, while hotels operated by the American arm of Hilton outside the U.S. were named Conrad Hotels. Those Hilton Hotels outside the U.S. were, until 2006, styled as &quot;Hilton International&quot; hotels. 

In 1986, Hilton International was sold to UAL Corp., the holding company for United Airlines, for $980 million. UAL was reorganized as Allegis Corp. in an attempt to re-incarnate itself as a full-service travel company, encompassing Westin Hotels and Hertz rental cars in addition to Hilton International and United Airlines. In 1987, after a corporate putsch, the renamed Allegis sold Hilton International to Ladbroke Group plc, a British leisure and gambling company, for $1.07 billion. In May 1999, Ladbrokes was reorganized as &quot;Hilton Group plc.&quot;

In 1997, to minimize longtime consumer confusion, the American-owned Hilton and British-owned Hilton International companies adopted a joint marketing agreement, under which they shared the same logos, promoted each other&#x27;s brands, and maintained joint reservation systems. At that point, the Vista chain was phased out, while Conrad was restyled as one of the luxury brands of Hilton, operating hotels within the U.S. and abroad. 

=== 21st century ===

In 2001, Hilton agreed to sell Red Lion to WestCoast Hospitality.

On December 29, 2005, Hilton Hotels Corporation agreed to re-acquire the Hilton International chain from its British owner, Hilton Group plc, for £3.3 billion ($5.71 billion). As well as bringing the two Hilton companies back together as a single entity, this deal also included Hilton plc properties operating as Conrad Hotels, Scandic Hotels, and LivingWell Health Clubs. On February 23, 2006, the deal closed, making Hilton Hotels the world&#x27;s fifth-largest hotel operator in number of rooms. Scandic Hotels was sold the next year on March 1 to EQT AB.

On July 3, 2007, Hilton Hotels Corp. agreed to an all-cash buyout from the Blackstone Group LP in a $26 billion (including debt) deal that would make Blackstone the world&#x27;s largest hotel owner. At $47.50 per share, the buyout price was 32 percent higher than the closing value of a share of Hilton stock on July 3. The deal was the culmination of a year of on and off discussions with Blackstone. In October 2007, Christopher J. Nassetta was appointed president and chief executive officer of Hilton. In February 2009, Hilton Hotels Corp. announced that its headquarters were moving from Beverly Hills, California to Fairfax County, Virginia.

While Blackstone saw an opportunity to streamline the company and push Hilton&#x27;s expansion overseas when Blackstone pursued Hilton in 2006 and 2007, the buyout saddled the company with $20 billion of debt just as the economy was turning down. In April 2010, Hilton and Blackstone restructured the debt with Blackstone invested a further $800 million of equity and the debt was reduced to $16 billion.

Hilton returned to being a public company on December 12, 2013. This second IPO in the company&#x27;s history raised an estimated $2.35 billion. The Blackstone Group retained a 45.8% stake in the company.

The company announced in February 2016 that Hilton would turn its hotel holdings into a real estate investment trust. 

In February 2016, Hilton announced its intention to spin off its timeshare and real estate businesses, creating three independent public companies. The spin-offs of Park Hotels &amp; Resorts and Hilton Grand Vacations were completed in January 2017. As of 2018, the company is a fully independent publicly traded company after the exits of Blackstone and HNA.

On February 7, 2024, Hilton announced an exclusive partnership with Small Luxury Hotels of the World.

On April 3, 2024, Hilton announced its acquisition of a majority controlling interest in Sydell Group, the owner of NoMad Hotels, aiming to expand the luxury lifestyle brand with up to 100 new NoMad hotels globally.

== Brands ==


Hilton&#x27;s business model for its various brands is based on largely on franchising rather than direct ownership and management of properties. Hilton Worldwide has full ownership of the hotel and resort brands as well as the intellectual property associated with them, however the vast majority of Hilton branded properties are not owned and operated by Hilton, instead they are independently owned and operated by independent franchisees or hospitality companies. As of 2024, Hilton Worldwide owns 22 hotel and resort brands that cover a variety of areas in the hospitality sector in six internal categories:

=== Luxury ===
* Waldorf Astoria Hotels &amp; Resorts
* Conrad Hotels
* LXR Hotels &amp; Resorts
* NoMad Hotels

=== Lifestyle ===
* Canopy by Hilton
* Curio Collection by Hilton
* Graduate by Hilton
* Tapestry Collection by Hilton
* Tempo by Hilton
* Motto by Hilton

=== Full Service ===
* Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts
* DoubleTree by Hilton

=== Focused Service ===
* Hilton Garden Inn
* Hampton by Hilton
* Tru by Hilton
* Spark by Hilton

=== All Suites ===
* Embassy Suites by Hilton
* Homewood Suites by Hilton
* Home2 Suites by Hilton
* LivSmart Studios by Hilton

=== Vacation Ownership ===
* Hilton Vacation Club
* Hilton Club
* Hilton Grand Vacations

=== Franchising ===
As of February 2024, 6,679 of Hilton&#x27;s 7,530 hotels and timeshare resorts worldwide are owned and operated by independent franchisees or companies and not by Hilton Worldwide itself, this includes Hilton Grand Vacations which was a division of Hilton Worldwide until it was spun off into a separate company to act as a franchisee for Hilton&#x27;s timeshare brands. Through this franchising model Hilton Worldwide owns the Hilton hotel and resort brands along with the Intellectual property associated with them, but does own or operate the physical hotels and resorts that bear those brand names. Additionally, Hilton Worldwide does not employ the staff that works at these franchised properties, instead the staff are employed by the independent franchisees or companies. The practice of franchising means that Hilton Worldwide is not responsible for the operational costs, real estate costs, maintenance costs, staff wages, and other costs that they would be if they were the ones owning and operating the properties, instead the independent franchisee or company incurs those costs. Hilton Worldwide profits from the franchisees through franchise fees, licensing fees, and agreements which give Hilton Worldwide a certain percentage the income. In order to utilize the Hilton brands, the independent franchisees and companies must follow strict brand standards to maintain a licensing agreement with Hilton Worldwide. The franchise model makes Hilton Worldwide a more profitable company along with increasing its value for shareholders due to it having less capital and being able to focus more on its brand. Many of Hilton&#x27;s flagship properties, airport properties, and largest resorts, however, are corporately managed.

== Corporate affairs ==
=== Head offices ===

The company has its headquarters in Tysons, Virginia, and an operations center in Memphis. Its Asia-Pacific operations are managed out of Singapore, its Middle East and Africa operations are managed out of Dubai, and its European operations are based in Watford, UK.

=== Loyalty program ===
Hilton Honors (formerly &quot;Hilton HHonors&quot;) is Hilton&#x27;s guest loyalty program, through which frequent guests can accumulate points and airline miles by staying within the Hilton portfolio. The program is one of the largest of its type, with approximately 195 million members. There are four levels of elite status within the Hilton Honors program including Member, Silver, Gold, and Diamond. Hilton points average a value of 0.58¢ each. Hilton renamed the Hilton HHonors program to &quot;Hilton Honors&quot; in February 2017.

=== Company culture ===
According to Careerbliss.com, Hilton ranked first in the list of &quot;2012 Happiest Companies in America&quot;, with a score of 4.36 out of 5. The survey looked at job reviews from more than 100,000 employees, with such characteristics life as work-life balance, company culture and reputation, and the relationships employees have with their bosses. Hilton has scored 100% on the Corporate Equality Index each year from 2014 to 2017.

In 2016, Hilton was named one of the &quot;World&#x27;s 25 Best Multinational Workplaces&quot; by &quot;Fortune&quot; and Great Place to Work. In 2017, &quot;Fortune&quot; ranked Hilton number 26 in their list of &quot;The 100 Best Companies to Work For&quot;. In 2019, &quot;Fortune&quot; ranked Hilton number 1 in their list of &quot;The 100 Best Companies to Work For&quot;.

<text>The Bourne shell (codice_1) is a shell command-line interpreter for computer operating systems. It first appeared on Version 7 Unix, as its default shell. Unix-like systems continue to have codice_2—which will be the Bourne shell, or a symbolic link or hard link to a compatible shell—even when other shells are used by most users.

The Bourne shell was once standard on all branded Unix systems, although historically BSD-based systems had many scripts written in csh. As the basis of POSIX codice_1 syntax, Bourne shell scripts can typically be run with Bash or dash on Linux or other Unix-like systems; Bash itself is a free clone of Bourne.

==History==
===Origins===

Work on the Bourne shell initially started in 1976. Developed by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs, it was a replacement for the Thompson shell, whose executable file had the same name—codice_1. The Bourne shell was also preceded by the Mashey shell. Bourne was released in 1979 in the Version 7 Unix release distributed to colleges and universities. Although it is used as an interactive command interpreter, it was also intended as a scripting language and contains most of the features that are commonly considered to produce structured programs.

It gained popularity with the publication of &quot;The Unix Programming Environment&quot; by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike—the first commercially published book that presented the shell as a programming language in a tutorial form.

Some of the primary goals of the shell were:
* To allow shell scripts to be used as filters.
* To provide programmability including control flow and variables.
* Control over all input/output file descriptors.
* Control over signal handling within scripts.
* No limits on string lengths when interpreting shell scripts.
* Rationalize and generalize string quoting mechanism.
* The environment mechanism. This allowed context to be established at startup and provided a way for shell scripts to pass context to sub scripts (processes) without having to use explicit positional parameters.

===Features of the original version===
Features of the Version 7 UNIX Bourne shell include:

* Scripts can be invoked as commands by using their filename
* May be used interactively or non-interactively
* Allows both synchronous and asynchronous execution of commands
* Supports input and output redirection and pipelines
* Provides a set of built-in commands
* Provides flow control constructs and quotation facilities.
* Typeless variables
* Provides local and global variable scope
* Scripts do not require compilation before execution
* Does not have a goto facility, so code restructuring may be necessary
* Command substitution using backquotes: codice_5.
* Here documents using codice_6 to embed a block of input text within a script.
* codice_7 loops, in particular the use of codice_8 to loop over arguments, as well as codice_9 loops for iterating over lists.
* codice_10 selection mechanism, primarily intended to assist argument parsing.
* codice_1 provided support for environment variables using keyword parameters and exportable variables.
* Contains strong provisions for controlling input and output and in its expression matching facilities.

The Bourne shell also was the first to feature the convention of using file descriptor codice_12 for error messages, allowing much greater programmatic control during scripting by keeping error messages separate from data.

Stephen Bourne&#x27;s coding style was influenced by his experience with the ALGOL 68C compiler that he had been working on at Cambridge University. In addition to the style in which the program was written, Bourne reused portions of ALGOL 68&#x27;s codice_13, codice_10 and codice_15&quot; (using codice_16 instead of codice_17) clauses in the common Unix Bourne shell syntax. Moreover, – although the v7 shell is written in C – Bourne took advantage of some macros to give the C source code an ALGOL 68 flavor. These macros (along with the finger command distributed in Unix version 4.2BSD) inspired the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC).

===Features introduced after 1979===
Over the years, the Bourne shell was enhanced at AT&amp;T. The various variants are thus called like the respective AT&amp;T Unix version it was released with (some important variants being Version7, System III, SVR2, SVR3, SVR4). As the shell was never versioned, the only way to identify it was testing its features.

Features of the Bourne shell versions since 1979 include:

* Built-in command – System III shell (1981)
* # as comment character – System III shell (1981)
* Colon in parameter substitutions &quot;${parameter:=word}&quot; – System III shell (1981)
* with argument – System III shell (1981)
* for indented here documents – System III shell (1981)
* Functions and the builtin – SVR2 shell (1984)
* Built-ins , , – SVR2 shell (1984)
* Source code de-ALGOL68-ized – SVR2 shell (1984)
* Modern &quot;&quot; – SVR3 shell (1986)
* Built-in – SVR3 shell (1986)
* Cleaned up parameter handling allows recursively callable functions – SVR3 shell (1986)
* 8-bit clean – SVR3 shell (1986)
* Job control – SVR4 shell (1989)
* Multi-byte support – SVR4 shell (1989)

==Variants==

===DMERT shell===
Duplex Multi-Environment Real-Time (DMERT) is a hybrid time-sharing/real-time operating system developed in the 1970s at Bell Labs Indian Hill location in Naperville, Illinois uses a 1978 snapshot of Bourne Shell &quot;VERSION sys137 DATE 1978 Oct 12 22:39:57&quot;. The DMERT shell runs on 3B21D computers still in use in the telecommunications industry.

===Korn shell===
The Korn shell (ksh) written by David Korn based on the original Bourne Shell source code, was a middle road between the Bourne shell and the C shell. Its syntax was chiefly drawn from the Bourne shell, while its job control features resembled those of the C shell. The functionality of the original Korn Shell (known as ksh88 from the year of its introduction) was used as a basis for the POSIX shell standard. A newer version, ksh93, has been open source since 2000 and is used on some Linux distributions. A clone of ksh88 known as pdksh is the default shell in OpenBSD.

===Schily Bourne Shell===
Jörg Schilling&#x27;s Schily-Tools includes three Bourne Shell derivatives.

==Relationship to other shells==

===C shell===

Bill Joy, the author of the C shell, criticized the Bourne shell as being unfriendly for interactive use, a task for which Stephen Bourne himself acknowledged C shell&#x27;s superiority. Bourne stated, however, that his shell was superior for scripting and was available on any Unix system, and Tom Christiansen also criticized C shell as being unsuitable for scripting and programming.

===Almquist shells===

Due to copyright issues surrounding the Bourne Shell as it was used in historic CSRG BSD releases, Kenneth Almquist developed a clone of the Bourne Shell, known by some as the Almquist shell and available under the BSD license, which is in use today on some BSD descendants and in low-memory situations. The Almquist Shell was ported to Linux, and the port renamed the Debian Almquist shell, or dash. This shell provides faster execution of standard codice_1 (and POSIX-standard codice_1, in modern descendants) scripts with a smaller memory footprint than its counterpart, Bash. Its use tends to expose bashisms – bash-centric assumptions made in scripts meant to run on sh.

===Other shells===
* Bash (the &quot;Bourne-Again shell&quot;) was developed in 1989 for the GNU project and incorporates features from the Bourne shell, csh, and ksh. It is meant to be POSIX-compliant.
* rc was created at Bell Labs by Tom Duff as a replacement for sh for Version 10 Unix. It is the default shell for Plan 9 from Bell Labs. It has been ported to UNIX as part of Plan 9 from User Space.
* Z shell, developed by Paul Falstad in 1990, is an extended Bourne shell with a large number of improvements, including some features of Bash, ksh, and tcsh.

<text>Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts (formerly known as Hilton Hotels) is a global brand of full-service hotels and resorts and the flagship brand of American multinational hospitality company Hilton Worldwide.

The original company was founded by Conrad Hilton. As of December 30, 2019, 584 Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts properties with 216,379 rooms in 94 countries and territories are located across six continents. This includes 61 properties that are owned or leased with 219,264 rooms, 272 that are managed with 119,612 rooms, and 251 that are franchised with 77,451 rooms. In 2020, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine ranked Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts at number one on their &quot;Fortune&quot; List of the Top 100 Companies to Work For in 2020 based on an employee survey of satisfaction.

==Overview==
Conrad Hilton founded the Hilton hotel chain in 1919, when he bought his first property, the Mobley Hotel, in Cisco, Texas. The first hotel to feature the Hilton brand was the Dallas Hilton. In late 2010, Hilton announced a name change of the Hilton Hotels brand to Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts along with a new logo design, as part of a rebranding effort for the flagship brand.

Today, Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts is Hilton&#x27;s flagship brand and one of the largest hotel brands in the world. The brand is targeted at both business and leisure travelers with locations in major city centers, near airports, convention centers, and popular vacation destinations around the world.

Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts participates in Hilton Honors, Hilton&#x27;s guest-loyalty program established in 1989. Members who book directly through Hilton-owned channels receive exclusive discounts and amenities such as free Wi-Fi, digital check-in, keyless entry, and the ability to use a mobile app to choose specific rooms.

In 2015, approximately 20 Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts properties were inducted into the Historic Hotels of America organization. Among these hotels were Hilton Fort Worth, which hosted John F. Kennedy&#x27;s final speech, and Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort, the setting of the film &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;.

* Singapore: 
** The Singapore Hilton was developed alongside its sister property in Kuala Lumpur in 1963, but its opening was delayed to 1970, owing to the administrative logjam caused by Singapore&#x27;s departure from Malaysia. It is known for hosting the popular European restaurant Iggy&#x27;s. In 2022, it left the Hilton chain and has been managed by IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts through its Voco conversion brand.

* Taba, Egypt: Hilton began managing the Aviya-Sonesta Beach Hotel in 1990, a hotel built by Israel during its occupation of the Sinai Peninsula, after an international panel ruled that the strip of land it sat on belonged to Egypt. Rebranded as Hilton Taba, the hotel was popular with Israeli tourists on account of its location near Eilat and its tax-free status (to this day, it is the only hotel in Egypt where Israelis do not need to pay a tax to travel to). It left the Hilton chain in 2017 and subsequently joined Deutsche Hospitality.
* Tallinn, Estonia: In June 2016, Hilton opened their first hotel in Estonia and the Baltic states, Hilton Tallinn Park.

* Washington, D.C., United States: 
** The Capital Hilton was originally part of the Statler Hotels chain before it was acquired by Hilton. It notably accepted Larry Doby of the Cleveland Indians as its first black guest when the team was in town in 1947. Much of the film &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; (1950) is set in the hotel, although only some scenes were shot there.
** The Washington Hilton regularly hosts the annual National Prayer Breakfast, as well as the annual dinners of the White House Correspondents Association and Radio and Television Correspondents&#x27; Association.

==Planned projects==

A commercial space station project known as &quot;Space Islands&quot; was proposed by Hilton International in 1999 to be constructed from used Space Shuttle fuel tanks. When completed, it was to be called the Hilton Orbital Hotel. The tanks were to be connected together to form a ring, resulting in a space station similar to that pictured in the film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. Plans were also drawn up for the Lunar Hilton, a 5000-room hotel on the Moon, though Steve Hilton noted in 2009 that both these plans were more symbolic than practical at this stage.

In October 2012, Hilton announced a property in the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka, the Hilton Dhaka, designed by Mustapha Khalid Palash. As of 2023, the hotel has yet to open, though Hilton currently has a targeted 2025 opening date.

In March 2013, Hilton announced that it would be entering Myanmar for the first time with the construction of a 300-room hotel in Yangon. While the Yangon hotel has yet to materialize, Hilton did manage to open properties in Mandalay and Naypyidaw in the north of the country (although the Mandalay Hilton has since closed).

In 2018, Hilton announced two hotel projects in Kampala, Uganda: the Kampala Hilton Hotel and the Hilton Garden Inn Kampala. Both projects are still in development. A previous Hilton project in Kampala and announced in 2006 was repurposed into The Pearl of Africa Hotel Kampala, after Hilton exited the venture.

==Other ventures==
In 2017, Hilton announced that it would remain the sponsor for McLaren until 2021. Hilton was one of the oldest sponsors of F1 series and sponsored McLaren since 2005.

In October 2017, Hilton announced it had committed a total of $50m (£37.8m) over five years to its Hilton Africa Growth Initiative to support the continued expansion of its Sub-Saharan African portfolio.

<doc id="92847" wikidata="Q2186618" url="?curid=92847" title="Cherokee spiritual beliefs">
<text>Cherokee spiritual beliefs are held in common among the Cherokee people – Native American peoples who are Indigenous to the Southeastern Woodlands, and today live primarily in communities in North Carolina (the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians), and Oklahoma (the Cherokee Nation and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians). Some of the beliefs, and the stories and songs in which they have been preserved, exist in slightly different forms in the different communities in which they have been preserved. But for the most part, they still form a unified system of theology.

==Principal beliefs==
To the traditional Cherokee, spirituality is woven into the fabric of everyday life. The physical world is not separated from the spiritual world. They are one and the same. In her book &quot;Cherokee Women: Gender and Culture Change, 1700–1835&quot;, historian Theda Perdue wrote of the Cherokee&#x27;s historical beliefs:&quot;The Cherokee did not separate spiritual and physical realms but regarded them as one, and they practiced their religion in a host of private daily observances as well as in public ceremonies.&quot;

Cherokee cosmology traditionally includes a conception of the universe being composed of three distinct but connected worlds: the Upper World and the Under World, which are the domains of the spirits, and This World, where humans live.

Unlike some other religions, in the Cherokee belief system, humans do not rule or have dominion over the earth, plants or animals. Instead, humans live in coexistence with all of creation. Humans mediate between all worlds in an attempt to maintain balance between them. Plants, animals, and other features of the natural world such as rivers, mountains, caves and other formations on the earth all have spiritual powers and attributes. Theda Perdue and Michael Green write in their book &quot;The Columbia Guide to American Indians of the Southeast&quot;,&quot;These features served as mnemonic devices to remind them of the beginning of the world, the spiritual forces that inhabited it, and their responsibilities to it.&quot; Perdue also outlines the ways that Cherokee culture persisted through multiple attempts by Christian missionaries to convert them. Their strong ties to Selu, the corn mother in their creation story, put women in a position of power in their communities as harvesters of corn, a role they did not give up easily.

===Sacred fire===
Fire is important in traditional Cherokee beliefs, as well as in other Indigenous cultures of the Southeastern United States. In his book &quot;Where the Lightning Strikes: The Lives of American Indian Sacred Places&quot;, anthropologist Peter Nabokov writes:
&quot;Fire was the medium of transformation, turning offerings into gifts for spiritual intercessors for the four quarters of the earth.&quot; 
From The Cherokee People by T.Mails, the sacred fire was a special gift to the Cherokee people and in their dance around that blessed fire they would become united as one mind.

===Balance===
To the traditional Cherokee, the concept of balance is central in all aspects of social and ceremonial life. In &quot;Cherokee Women: Gender and Culture Change, 1700–1835&quot;, Theda Perdue writes: &quot;In this belief system, women balanced men just as summer balanced winter, plants balanced animals, and farming balanced hunting.&quot;

===Sickness and healing===
Author John Reid, in his book titled &quot;A Law of Blood: The Primitive Law of the Cherokee Nation&quot;, writes: &quot;All human diseases were imposed by animals in revenge for killing and each species had invented a disease with which to plague man.&quot;
According to Reid, some believed animal spirits who had been treated badly could retaliate by sending bad dreams to the hunter. These would cause the hunter to lose their appetite, become sick and die. To prevent this from happening the hunter must follow traditional protocols when hunting, to honor the animal and spiritual world and continually maintain balance.

===Purity and sacred places===
Ritual purification is traditionally important for ceremonial and ongoing spiritual balance. Bathing in rivers, year-round, is one traditional method, even in the winter when ice is on the river. Anthropologist Peter Nabokov writes of a river known as &quot;Long Man&quot;:&quot;For the Cherokee who bathed in his body, who drank from him and invoked his curative powers, the Long Man always helped them out.&quot;
He went on to say: &quot;At every critical turn in a man&#x27;s life, the river&#x27;s blessings were imparted through the &#x27;going to the water&#x27; rite, which required prayers that were lent spiritual force with &#x27;new water&#x27; from free-flowing streams.&quot;

==Creation beliefs==
The first people were a brother and sister. Once, the brother hit his sister with a fish and told her to multiply. Following this, she gave birth to a child every seven days and soon there were too many people, so women were forced to have just one child every year.

===The Story of Corn and Medicine===
The Story of Corn and Medicine begins with the creation of the earth and animals. Earth was created out of mud that grew into land. Animals began exploring the earth, and it was the Buzzard that created valleys and mountains in the Cherokee land by the flapping of his wings. After some time, the earth became habitable for the animals, once the mud of the earth had dried and the sun had been raised up for light.

According to the Cherokee medicine ceremony, the animals and plants had to stay awake for seven nights. The reasons weren&#x27;t well known. Only the owl, panther, bat, and unnamed others were able to fulfill the requirements of the ceremony, so these animals were given the gift of night vision, which allowed them to hunt easily at night. Similarly, the only trees able to remain awake for the seven days were the cedar, pine, spruce, holly, laurel, and oak. These trees were given the gift of staying green year-round.

The first woman argued with the first man and left their home. The first man, helped by the sun, tried tempting her with blueberries and blackberries to return, but was unsuccessful. He finally persuaded her to return by giving to her strawberries.
Humans began to hunt animals and quickly grew in numbers. The population grew so rapidly that a rule was established that women can only have one child per year. Two early humans, a man and his wife, were Kanáti and Selu. Their names meant &quot;The Lucky Hunter&quot; and &quot;Corn&quot;, respectively. Kanáti would hunt and bring an animal home for Selu to prepare. Kanáti and Selu had a child, and their child befriended another boy who had been created out of the blood of the slaughtered animals. The family treated this boy like one of their own, except they called him &quot;The Wild Boy&quot;.
Kanáti consistently brought animals home when he went hunting, and one day, the boys decided to secretly follow him. They discovered that Kanáti would move a rock concealing a cave, and an animal would come out of the cave only to be killed by Kanáti. The boys secretly returned to the rock and opened the entrance to the cave. The boys didn&#x27;t realize that when the cave was opened many different animals escaped. 

Kanáti saw the animals and realized what must have happened. He journeyed to the cave and sent the boys home so he could try to catch some of the escaped animals for eating. This explains why people must hunt for food now.

The boys returned to Selu, who went to get food from the storehouse. She instructed the boys to wait behind while she was gone, but they disobeyed and followed her. They discovered Selu&#x27;s secret, which was that she would rub her stomach to fill baskets with corn, and she would rub her sides to fill baskets with beans. 

Selu knew her secret was out and made the boys one last meal. She and Kanáti then explained to the boys that the two of them would die because their secrets had been discovered. Along with Kanáti and Selu dying, the easy life the boys had become accustomed to would also die. However, if the boys dragged Selu&#x27;s body seven times outside a circle, and then seven times over the soil within the circle, a crop of corn would appear in the morning if the boys stayed up all night to watch. The boys did not fulfill the instructions completely, which is why corn can only grow in certain places around the earth. Today, corn is still grown, but it does not come overnight. 

During the early times, the plants, animals, and people all lived together as friends, but the dramatic population growth of humans crowded the earth, leaving the animals with no room to roam. Humans also would kill the animals for meat or trample them for being in the way. As a punishment for these horrendous acts, the animals created diseases to infect the humans.

Like other creatures, the plants decided to meet, and they came to the conclusion that the animals&#x27; actions had to be too harsh and that they would provide a cure for every disease. This explains why all kinds of plant life help to cure many varieties of diseases. Medicine was created in order to counteract the animals&#x27; punishments.

===The Thunder beings===
The Cherokee believe that there is the Great Thunder and his sons, the two Thunder Boys, who live in the land of the west above the sky vault. They dress in lightning and rainbows. The priests pray to the thunder and he visits the people to bring rain and blessings from the South. It was believed that the thunder beings who lived close to the Earth&#x27;s surface in the cliffs, mountains, and waterfalls could harm the people at times, which did happen. These other thunders are always plotting mischief.

===Medicine and disease===
It is said that all plants, animals, beasts and people once lived in harmony with no separation between them. At this time, the animals were bigger and stronger until the humans became more powerful. When the human population increased, so did the weapons, and the animals no longer felt safe. The animals decided to hold a meeting to discuss what should be done to protect themselves.

The Bears met first and decided that they would make their own weapons like the humans, but this only led to further chaos. Next the Deer gathered to discuss their plan of action and they came to the conclusion that if a hunter was to kill a Deer, they would develop a disease. The only way to avoid this disease was to ask the Deer&#x27;s spirit for forgiveness. Another requirement was that the people only kill when necessary. The council of Birds, Insects and small animals met next and they decided that humans were too cruel, therefore they concocted many diseases to infect them with.

The plants heard what the animals were planning and since they were always friendly with the humans, they vowed that for every disease made by the animals, they would create a cure. Every plant serves a purpose and the only way to find the purpose is to discover it for yourself. When a medicine man does not know what medicine to use, the spirits of the plants instruct him.

===Origins of fire===

Fire is a very important tool in everyday use. The first written account of the Cherokee fire origin story was recorded by the Westerner James Mooney. This appears to be when the spider heroine was first named &quot;Water Spider.&quot; However the Cherokee story teller made sure to also describe the spider: &quot;This is not the water spider that looks like a mosquito, but the other one, with black downy hair and red stripes on her body.&quot; Modern Cherokee language forums agree the character&#x27;s actual name is ᏗᎵᏍᏙᏗ &quot;dilsdohdi&quot; or a derivation of that word, which means scissors or scissoring action referring to the motion this stocky spider is able to use to move across water. &quot;Phidippus johnsoni&quot;, the red-backed jumping spider is most likely the actual spider who inspired the character in this Cherokee legend as it is endemic to the original Cherokee homelands and has the body features and colors described in the legends as well as the ancient bone etchings of the character.)

==Unetlanvhi==
The Cherokee revere the Great Spirit Unetlanvhi (ᎤᏁᏝᏅᎯ &quot;Creator&quot;), who presides over all things and created the Earth. The Unetlanvhi is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient, and is said to have made the earth to provide for its children, and should be of equal power to Dâyuni&#x27;sï, the Water Beetle. The Wahnenauhi Manuscript adds that God is Unahlahnauhi (ᎤᏀᎳᎿᎤᎯ &quot;Maker of All Things&quot;) and Kalvlvtiahi (ᎧᎸᎸᏘᎠᎯ &quot;The One Who Lives Above&quot;). In most oral and written Cherokee theology the Great Spirit is not personified as having human characteristics or a physical human form.

===Other venerated spirits===
* Uktena (ᎤᎧᏖᎾ): A horned serpent
* Tlanuwa (ᏝᏄᏩ): A giant raptor

==Signs, visions, and dreams==
The Cherokee traditionally hold that signs, visions, dreams, and powers are all gifts of the spirits, and that the world of humans and the world of the spirits are intertwined, with the spirit world and presiding over both.

Spiritual beings can come in the form of animal or human and are considered a part of daily life. A group of spiritual beings are spoken about as Little People and they can only be seen by humans when they want to be seen. It is said that they choose who they present themselves to and appear as any other Cherokee would, except that they are small with very long hair. The Little People can be helpful but one should be cautious while interacting with them because they can be very deceptive. It is not common to talk about an experience one has with the Little People. Instead, one might relay an incident that happened to someone else. It is said that if you bother the Little People too often you will become confused in your day-to-day life. Although they possess healing powers and helpful hints, the Little People are not to be disturbed.

==Evil==

Traditionally there is no universal evil spirit in Cherokee theology.

An Asgina (ᎠᏍᎩᎾ) is any sort of spirit, but it is usually considered to be a malevolent one.

Kalona Ayeliski (ᎪᎳᏅ ᎠᏰᎵᏍᎩ &quot;Raven Mockers&quot;) are spirits who prey on the souls of the dying and torment their victims until they die, after which they eat the hearts of their victims. Kalona Ayeliski are invisible, except to a medicine man, and the only way to protect a potential victim is to have a medicine man who knows how to drive Kalona Ayeliski off, since they are scared of him.

U&#x27;tlun&#x27;ta (ᎤᏢᏔ &quot;Spearfinger&quot;) is a monster and witch said to live along the eastern side of Tennessee and western part of North Carolina. She has a sharp forefinger on her right hand, which resembles a spear or obsidian knife, which she uses to cut her victims. Her mouth is stained with blood from the livers she has eaten. She is also known as &quot;Nûñ&#x27;yunu&#x27;ï&quot;, which means &quot;Stone-dress&quot;, for her stone-like skin.

Uya (ᎤᏯ), sometimes called Uyaga (ᎤᏯᎦ), is an evil earth spirit which is invariably opposed to the forces of right and light.

<text>Zuni religion is the oral history, cosmology, and religion of the Zuni people. The Zuni are a Pueblo people located in New Mexico. Their religion is integrated into their daily lives and respects ancestors, nature, and animals. Because of a history of religious persecution by non-native peoples, they are very private about their religious beliefs. Roman Catholicism has to some extent been integrated into traditional Zuni religion.

Cultural institutions that provide religious instruction and cultural stability include their priests, clans, kivas (kachina society), and healing societies. A ceremonial cycle brings the community together. While some ceremonies are open to non-Zuni peoples, others are private; for instance the Shalako ceremony and feast has been closed to outsiders since 1990.

== Creation ==
In Frank Cushing&#x27;s The Genesis of the Worlds, Or the Beginning of Newness, only Áwonawílona had being. This All-Father, Maker and Container of All, made himself into the Sun Father, Yatoka. The mist clouds formed into the Great Waters, where Earth Mother, Áwitelin Tsíta, and Sky Father, Ápoyan Ta&#x27;chu, formed, the two of whom conceived all men and creatures in the four-fold womb of the world. The Sun Father and Earth Mother then brought forth the Twin Children of the Sun, the twin brothers Ko&#x27;wituma and Wats&#x27;usi. These twins were endowed with sacred knowledge, caps, bows, arrows and shields to have dominion over all men and creatures as Twin War Gods. They descended into Ánosin Téhuli, the first Underworld where they formed a ladder for some of the men and creatures to ascend to the second cave-world called Moss World, K&#x27;ólin Téhuli. Once again the twins formed a ladder for entry into the third world called the World of Mud, Áwisho Téhuli, and finally the last cave-world called Wing World, Tépahaian Téhuli. Here, the twins instructed men in the ways of life and to seek the Sun Father, before they gained entry into the Daylight World, Ték&#x27;ohaian Úlahnane. Initially covered in scaly skin and having webbed feet and hands, the men eventually grew accustomed to the light and clothed themselves in girdles and sandals.

In Ruth Benedict&#x27;s The Emergence and Other Kachina Tales, people initially dwelt crowded tightly together in total darkness in a place deep in the earth known as the fourth world. The daylight world then had hills and streams but no people to live there or to present prayer sticks to Awonawilona, the Sun and creator. Awonawilona took pity on the people and his two sons were stirred to lead them to the daylight world. The sons, who have human features, located the opening to the fourth world in the southwest, but they were forced to pass through the progressively dimming first, second and third worlds before reaching the overcrowded and blackened fourth world. The people, blinded by the darkness, identified the two brothers as strangers by touch and called them their bow priests. The people expressed their eagerness to leave to the bow priests, and the priests of the north, west, south and east who were also consulted agreed. To prepare for the journey, four seeds were planted by Awonawilona&#x27;s sons, and four trees sprang from them: a pine, a spruce, a silver spruce and an aspen. The trees quickly grew to full size, and the bow priests broke branches from them and passed them to the people. Then the bow priests made a prayer stick from a branch of each tree. They plunged the first, the prayer stick made of pine, into the ground and lightning sounded as it quickly grew all the way to the third world. The people were told that the time had come and to gather all their belongings, and they climbed up it to a somewhat lighter world but were still blinded. They asked if this is where they were to live and the bow priests said, &quot;Not yet&quot;. After staying four days, they traveled to the second world in similar fashion: the spruce prayer stick was planted in the earth and when it grew tall enough the people climbed it to the next world above them. And again, after four days they climbed the length of silver spruce prayer stick to the first world, but here they could see themselves for the first time because the sky glowed from a dawn-like red light. They saw they were each covered with filth and a green slime. Their hands and feet were webbed and they had horns and tails, but no mouths or anuses. But like each previous emergence, they were told this was not to be their final home. On their fourth day in the first world, the bow priests planted the last prayer stick, the one made of aspen. Thunder again sounded, the prayer stick stretched through the hole to the daylight world, and the people climbed one last time. When they all had emerged, the bow priests pointed out the Sun, Awonawilona, and urged the people to look upon him despite his brightness. Unaccustomed to the intense light, the people cried and sunflowers sprang from the earth where their tears fell. After four days, the people traveled on, and the bow priests decided they needed to learn to eat so they planted corn fetishes in the fields and when these had multiplied and grown, harvested it and gave the harvest to the men to bring home to their wives. The bow priests were saddened to see the people were smelling the corn but were unable to eat it because they had no mouths. So when they were asleep, the bow priests sharpened a knife with a red whetstone and cut mouths in the people&#x27;s faces. The next morning they were able to eat, but by evening they were uncomfortable because they could not defecate. That night when they were asleep the bow priests sharpened their knife on a soot whetstone and cut them all anuses. The next day the people felt better and tried new ways to eat their corn, grinding it, pounding, and molding it into porridge and corncakes. But they were unable to clean the corn from their webbed hands, so that evening as they slept the bow priests cut fingers and toes into their hands and feet. The people were pleased when they realized their hands and feet worked better, and the bow priests decided to make one last change. That night as they slept, the bow priests took a small knife and removed the people&#x27;s horns and tails. When the people awoke, they were afraid of the change at first, but they lost their fear when sun came out and grew pleased that the bow priests were finally finished.

==Kachina==
The Zuni were encouraged to continue looking for the Middle, itiwana, and the priest Ka&#x27;wimosa, Kachina Maker, was asked to send his eldest son Kiaklo northward as part of the search. When he was not heard from, Ka&#x27;wimosa&#x27;s next two sons, the Ánahoho áchi, were sent southward. When they were not heard from, the youngest son and daughter, Síweluhsiwa and Síwiluhsitsa, were sent eastward. During their journey, they had 10 children from an incestuous encounter. The first child was a man-woman combined, while the other nine were sexless men. Father and sons became the Koyemshi, attendants and interpreters of the kachinas, in the words of Cushing, &quot;they behaved one moment as simpletons speaking idocies and yet uttering wise words and prophecies from the ancients the next.&quot; In the meantime, not wanting to wait for Ka&#x27;wimosa&#x27;s return, the Zuni divided into three groups and continued their search for itiwana, led by the Beloved Twins. The Bear and Crane clans came upon a broad river which they attempted to cross. During the crossing, many of their children fell below the waves becoming lizards, frogs, turtles and newts, as they sank into the waters of Koyemshi and the abode of ghosts, Hápanawan, and Kóthluwalawan, the council of the god priests. These priests taught the Dance of Good, Kókokshi, to the dead, including these children. The Chief of Kóthluwalawan, Páutiwa, learned of Kiaklo&#x27;s plight from Duck, and sent Duck and the Koyemshi to bring Kiaklo to the council hall. Escorted by the Sálimopia and Shúlawitsi, the Little Fire God, Kiaklo entered the council hall and the assembled gods and soul-beings. Guided by Duck, Kiaklo learned the story of creation, followed by a sacred dance that included the Little Ones. Kiaklo was then tasked with conveying the customs and rites of the kachinas, the words of the gods, to the Zuni, including comforting messages for the mothers of the lost Little Ones, and how they made a pathway that all the dead follow to the spirit world.

According to Ruth Bunzel&#x27;s Introduction to Zuni Ceremonialism, the Kachina Society is responsible for performing the rites of the Kachina. Males are initiated into the society by the age of 12. The Lost Children instructed the Zuni to copy their costumes, headdresses, and dances, when they would be with them in spirit. The masks are guarded in a back room of the owner, and are given a daily offering of food. The mask guarantees the owner admission into the dance house of the gods, and are buried with the owner four days after their death.

<doc id="92855" wikidata="Q369681" url="?curid=92855" title="Chen Duxiu">
<text>Chen Duxiu (8 October 187927 May 1942) was a Chinese revolutionary socialist, educator, philosopher and author, who co-founded the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with Li Dazhao in 1921. From 1921 to 1927, he served as the Communist Party&#x27;s first general secretary. Chen was a leading figure in both the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty and the May Fourth Movement for scientific and democratic developments in the early Republic of China. After his expulsion from the CCP in 1929, Chen was for a time the leader of China&#x27;s Trotskyist movement.

Chen&#x27;s ancestral home was in Anqing, Anhui, where he established the influential vernacular Chinese periodical &quot;New Youth&quot;. In order to support overthrowing the Qing government, Chen Duxiu had joined Yue Fei Loyalist Society () which emerged from Gelaohui in Anhui and Hunan province.

==Biography==

===Life in the Qing dynasty===
Chen Duxiu was born on 8 October 1879 in the city of Anqing, in the Anhui province of the Qing Empire. He was the youngest of four children born to a wealthy family of officials. In his youth, he was described as volatile, emotional, intuitive, non-intellectual, and a defender of the underdog. His father died when Chen was two years old, and he was raised primarily by his grandfather; and, later, by his older brother.

Chen was given a traditional Confucian education by his grandfather, several private tutors, and his elder brother. A thorough knowledge of Confucian literary and philosophical works was the pre-requisites for civil service in Imperial China. Chen was an exceptional student, but his poor experiences taking the Confucian civil service exams resulted in a lifelong tendency to advocate unconventional beliefs and to criticize traditional ideas.

Chen passed the county- and provincial-level imperial examinations in 1896 and 1897 respectively. In a sardonic memoir, he recalled the filthy conditions, the dishonesty, and the incompetence during the exams. In 1898, he enrolled at Qiushi Academy (now Zhejiang University) in Hangzhou after passing the entrance exam and studied French, English, and naval architecture. In October 1901, Chen went to Imperial Japan, studying Japanese at the Tokyo Higher Normal School before attending the Tokyo Special School (the predecessor of Waseda University). He moved to Nanjing in 1902, after reportedly making speeches attacking the Qing government, and then back to Japan the same year under a government scholarship to study at the Tokyo Shimbu Gakko, a military preparatory academy. He returned to China in March 1902 and, together with Bo Wenwei and others, formed the &quot;Youth Self-Strengthening Society.&quot; It was the first time in China that the slogan &quot;Science and Democracy&quot; was proposed. It was in Japan where Chen became influenced by socialism and the growing Chinese dissident movement. While studying in Japan, Chen helped to found two radical political parties, but refused to join Tongmenghui Revolutionary Alliance, which he regarded as narrowly racist. In 1908, he accepted a teaching position at the Army Elementary School in Hangzhou.

===Life in the early republic===
From the late 19th century, the Qing dynasty suffered a series of military defeats against the colonial foreign powers, most recently in the First Sino-Japanese War and the war against the Alliance of Eight Nations, which invaded China in response to the 1901 Boxer Rebellion. Government corruption resulted in economic paralysis and widespread impoverishment. During this time, Chen became increasingly influential within the revolutionary movement against both foreign imperialism and the Qing.

Influenced by his time in Japan, Chen founded the Anhui Patriotic Association in 1903 and the Yue Fei Loyalist Society in 1905. By 1905, the Yue Fei included anti-Qing gentry like Sun Yujing and Bo Wenwei. Chen was an outspoken writer and political leader by the time of the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, which started the Xinhai Revolution and led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty. Yue Fei branches were added in Wuhu and Anqing, with those in Anqing infiltrating and agitating within the Qing military. In 1912, Chen became secretary general to the new military governor of Anhui, while also serving as the dean of a local high school. He used the Yue Fei Loyalist Society to establish an organization of students from Anhui public school, pro-rebel Qing soldiers and secret society members. However, Chen fled to Japan again in 1913 following the short-lived &quot;Second Revolution&quot; against Yuan Shikai, but returned to China soon afterwards. He also created the Anhui Patriotic Society associated with the Anhui public school. These organizations won Chen recognition in Anhui, and contact with nationally prominent revolutionaries.

In the summer of 1915, Chen founded the journal &quot;Youth&quot; – renamed to &quot;New Youth&quot; (&quot;La Jeunesse&quot;) in 1916 – in Shanghai. It quickly became the most popular and widely distributed journal amongst the intelligentsia of the Republic of China. The journal criticized conservative Chinese morality and Confucianism; it supported individualism and a Western moral system valuing human rights, democracy and science, which Chen believed Confucianism opposed. The journal also promoted vernacular writing instead of traditional Confucian writing conventions.

Chen joined the faculty of Peking University in the January 1917 as the university&#x27;s dean, at the invitation of Cai Yuanpei, who also paid for moving Chen&#x27;s journal to Beijing. As a professor and dean at Peking University, he wrote &quot;If we wish to construct a new state and organize a new society in order to seek an existence suitable to our modern times, then the fundamental issue is that we must import the foundation of a Western-style society and country, that is to say, the new faith in equality and human rights... Unless [Confucianism] is suppressed, [the new Way] will not prevail; unless [supporters of Confucianism] are stopped, [the new Way] will not be practiced.&quot; Chen definition of Western civilization focused on egalitarianism rather than competition. He wrote: &quot;socialism is, therefore, a theory of social revolution succeeding political revolution; its aim is to eliminate all inequality and oppression. We can call it &#x27;contemporary&#x27; European civilization, which opposes the (merely) &#x27;modern&#x27;.&quot; A Marxist study group at the university, led by Li Dazhao, attracted his attention in 1919. Chen published a special edition of &quot;New Youth&quot; on Marxism with Li as the edition&#x27;s general editor; the edition provided the most detailed analysis of Marxism then published in China, and the journal&#x27;s popularity ensured its wide dissemination. Chen was involved with the May Fourth Movement, where his and Hu Shih&#x27;s ideas were labelled as being anti-government and the core of the &quot;New Culture Movement&quot;. In the fall of 1919, conservative opponents at the university forced Chen to resign. Around that time he was jailed for three months by the Peking authorities for distributing &quot;inflammatory&quot; literature that demanded the resignation of pro-Japanese ministers, and government guarantees for the freedoms of speech and assembly. After his release, Chen moved to the French Concession in Shanghai and became more interested in Marxism and the promotion of rapid social change; there he pursued his intellectual and scholarly interests free from official persecution. After reading the Bible in prison, he was said to have been a Nondenominational Christian or liberal Protestant before becoming dissatisfied with Christianity. In 1921, he also lived and worked at a Protestant church school.

The newspaper &quot;Shen Bao&quot; categorized academics into factions (&quot;xuepai&quot;). It portrayed Chen and Hu as victims of government persecution, and their opponents as allies of the warlords.

===Career within the Chinese Communist Party===

====Founding the Chinese Communist Party====

In 1921, Chen, Li and other prominent revolutionaries (including Mao Zedong) founded the CCP. It has been generally asserted that the group had diligently studied Marxist theories, inspired by the Russian Revolution of 1917. Chen was elected (in absentia) as the first General Secretary at the first party congress in Shanghai. He remained the undisputed leader of the party until 1927, and was often referred to as &quot;China&#x27;s Lenin&quot; during this period.

Chen, with Li&#x27;s assistance, developed a cooperative – and later troublesome – relationship with the Communist International (Comintern). Over the next decade, the Comintern sought to use the CCP as tools of Soviet foreign policy, leading to policy disagreements between CCP leaders and Comintern advisors.

By 1922, the party had only about 200 members, not counting those overseas.

====Subsequent efforts to spread communism====
Soon after the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, in 1921, Chen accepted an invitation from Chen Jiongming to serve on the education board in Guangzhou in the aftermath of the June 16 Incident, but this position dissolved when Guangzhou was recaptured by the Kuomintang. At the direction of the Comintern, Chen and the Chinese Communists formed an alliance with Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang (KMT or Nationalist Party) in 1922. Although Chen was not convinced of the utility of collaborating with the Kuomintang, he reluctantly carried out the Comintern&#x27;s orders to do so. Pursuing collaboration with the Kuomintang, he was elected into that party&#x27;s Central Committee in January 1924.

In 1927, after the Shanghai massacre, he and other high-ranking Communists, including Mao Zedong and Mikhail Borodin, collaborated closely with Wang Jingwei&#x27;s Nationalist government in Wuhan, convincing Wang&#x27;s regime to adopt various proto-Communist policies. The Wuhan government&#x27;s subsequent land reform policies were considered provocative enough to influence various KMT-aligned generals to attack Wang&#x27;s regime, suppressing it. Chen was forced to resign as General Secretary in 1927, due to his public dissatisfaction with the Comintern order to disarm during the April 12 Incident, which had led to the deaths of thousands of Communists – now known as the Shanghai massacre of 1927, and because of his disagreement with the Comintern&#x27;s new focus on peasant rebellions.

====Conflict with Mao====
Chen came into conflict with Mao Zedong in 1925 over Mao&#x27;s essay &quot;An Analysis of Classes in Chinese Society&quot;. Mao opposed Chen&#x27;s analyses of China. While Chen believed that the focus of revolutionary struggle in China should primarily concern the workers, Mao had started to theorize about the primacy of the peasants. According to Han Suyin in &quot;Mortal Flower&quot;, Chen &quot;opposed the opinions expressed [in Mao&#x27;s analysis], denied that a radical land policy and the vigorous organization of the rural areas under the Communist party was necessary, and refused the publication of the essay in the central executive organs of publicity.&quot;

Although he recognized the value of Mao&#x27;s interpretation of Marxism in inciting the Chinese peasants and labourers to revolution, Chen opposed Mao&#x27;s rejection of the strong role of the bourgeoisie that Chen had hoped to achieve. During the last years of his life, Chen denounced Stalin&#x27;s dictatorship, and held that various democratic institutions, including independent judiciaries, opposition parties, a free press, and free elections, were important and valuable. Because of Chen&#x27;s opposition to Mao&#x27;s interpretation of Communism, Mao believed that Chen was incapable of providing a robust historical materialist analysis of China. This dispute would eventually lead to the end of Chen and Mao&#x27;s friendship and political association.

====Expelled by the party====
After the collaboration between the Communist Party and the KMT fell apart in 1927, the Comintern blamed Chen, and systematically removed him from all positions of leadership. In November 1929, he was expelled. Afterwards, Chen became associated with the International Left Opposition of Leon Trotsky. Like Chen, Trotsky opposed many of the policies of the Comintern, and publicly criticized the Comintern&#x27;s effort to collaborate with the Nationalists. Chen eventually became the voice of the Trotskyists in China, attempting to regain support and influence within the party, but failed. Chen continued to oppose measures like &quot;New Democracy&quot; and the &quot;Block of Four Classes&quot; advocated by Mao Zedong.

After the communist movement in the late 1920s, Chen Duxiu and Leon Trotsky started to have a complex relationship that was not known in the west. Their relationship reveals the developments of Trotskyism in China and deepen the understanding of the relationship between the Communists of China and Soviet Union. Due to lack of related resources, the public did not have a full understanding of the relationship between Chen Duxiu and Leon Trotsky. Nowadays, this situation has already improved a lot by following reasons. Firstly, more printed Chinese materials about Chen Duxiu are available. Secondly, in 1980, the &quot;Exile papers of Leon Trotsky&quot; which includes letters, personal notes, manuscripts, and many unpublished resource were accessible.

===Last years===

In 1932, Chen was arrested by the government of the Shanghai International Settlement, where he had been living since 1927, and extradited to Nanjing. In 1933, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison by the Nationalist government, but was released on parole in 1937 after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Chen was one of the few early leaders of the Communist party to survive the turmoil of the 1930s, but he was never able to regain any influence within the party he had founded. For the last decade of his life, he faded into obscurity. 
At the time that he was released, both the supporters of Chen and the pro-Comintern leaders who opposed him had either been killed or had fallen out of favor with the Communist membership. The Chinese Communist Party managed to survive the purges only by fleeing to the northern frontier in the Long March of 1934–1935, during which Mao Zedong emerged as leader. If only for sheer survival, the Communists had to flee the cities where China&#x27;s fledgling industrial working class was concentrated, seek refuge in remote rural areas, and there mobilize the support of peasants; this was naturally taken as a vindication of Mao&#x27;s position in his debate with Chen. Mao and this new generation of Communists would lead the party in China for the next fifty years.

On 23 August, Chen was released from prison and refused multiple offers of positions from the Kuomintang. He said that despite the importance of the war effort, &quot;Chiang Kai-shek killed many of my comrades. He also killed my two sons. He and I are absolutely irreconcilable.&quot; In August 1937, Chen met with the heads of the Chinese Communist Party Office in Nanjing. This led to a concerted attempt by Luo Han and Ye Jianying to allow Chen to return to the Party. In September Mao responded saying that Chen could rejoin the party if he agreed to publicly renounce Trotskyism and express support for the United Front against Japan. Chen responded by letter to the Central Committee of the CCP that he agreed with its line of resistance but would not renounce Trotskyism. This was the end of the last serious attempt to rejoin the CCP.

Chen then travelled from place to place until the summer of 1938, when he arrived at the wartime capital of Chongqing and took a position teaching at a junior high school. In poor health and with few remaining friends, Chen Duxiu later retired to Jiangjin, a small town west of Chongqing, where he died in 1942 at the age of 62. Today, he is buried at his birthplace of Anqing.

===Legacy===
After the founding of the PRC in 1949, Chen&#x27;s example was used to warn Communist Party members not to deviate from party orthodoxy. In the Hundred Flowers Campaign, the example of Chen in collaborating with Wang Jingwei&#x27;s Wuhan government, leading to the ostracism of his peers and the failure of Communist policies at the time, was used by Peng Zhen as a warning never to &quot;forgive&quot; anti-Maoists. After Mao died in 1976, Hua Guofeng gave a speech praising Mao&#x27;s suppression of &quot;Right and &#x27;Left&#x27; Opportunist lines of the Party&quot; as one of the late chairman&#x27;s greatest achievements: Chen was the first person to be named as being correctly suppressed; Deng Xiaoping was the last.

Hu Qiaomu&#x27;s 1951 &quot;Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party&quot;, which was deemed by the Party as its authoritative history, denounced Chen as:

* a bourgeois democracy opportunist;
* Right opportunist;
* Right capitulationist;
* factionalist;
* anti-Soviet;
* anti-Comintern;
* anti-Party;
* counter-revolutionary;
* traitor to China; and
* a turncoat.

In 1956, Mao Zedong said that Chen represented the gravest of all of the deviations to the Right in the party&#x27;s history up to that time.

Chen&#x27;s contributions to the Party have subsequently been reassessed, however. Hong Kong historian Tang Baolin called Hu&#x27;s verdict on Chen the greatest miscarriage of justice in the Party&#x27;s history and although his reassessment of Chen has not been officially endorsed by the Party, it was published in 2009 by the Chinese Literature and History Press which is run by the National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference.

==Literature==

===Writing style===
Chen felt that his articles should reflect the needs of society. He believed that the progress of society could not be achieved without those who accurately report social weaknesses and sicknesses.

Chen&#x27;s articles were always expressive. He criticized the traditional Chinese officials as corrupt and guilty of other wrongdoings. He was under constant attack from conservatives in China, and had to flee to Japan four times. In China, he spent much of his life in the French Concession and the Shanghai International Settlement in order to pursue his writing and scholarly activities free from official harassment.

Chen&#x27;s articles strove to attract publicity, and often arouse discussion by using hyperbole. He lashed out against the backwardness and corruption in China. In &quot;New Youth&quot;, he wrote various articles using pseudonyms to form &quot;discussions&quot;, in order to arouse public interest.

Chen&#x27;s publications emphasized the responses from their audience. In &quot;New Youth&quot; there were forums and citizens&#x27; columns. On average, there were 6 letters from the public in each issue. Whether in praise or strong opposition, Chen encouraged all to write. He also thought that teamwork was very important in journalism, and consequently asked for help from many talented authors and journalists, including Hu Shih and Lu Xun.

===Journalistic works===

====&quot;Anhui Suhua Bao&quot;====
On 31 March 1904, Chen founded &quot;Anhui Suhua Bao&quot;, a newspaper that he established with Fang Zhiwu and Wu Shou in Tokyo to promote revolutionary ideas using vernacular Chinese, which was simple to understand and easy for the general public to read. While Chen was the chief secretary of the newspaper, its circulation increased from only a thousand copies to more than three times that figure in less than half a year, becoming one of the most popular vernacular Chinese newspapers in print at that time. During 1904 and 1905, a total of twenty-three issues were published. Each issue had 40 pages – about 15,000 words. However, due to political pressures, the paper was barred from publishing in 1905.

Chen had three main objectives in publishing &quot;Anhui Suhua Bao&quot;: to let his countrymen in Anhui keep abreast of the politics of the Qing dynasty; to spread knowledge to the paper&#x27;s readers through vernacular Chinese; and, to promote revolutionary ideas to the public. Chen believed that most Chinese believed that the importance of the family was greater than that of the state, and that this limited their interest in political events. He also found Chinese people in general to be excessively superstitious. Chen urged Chinese people to participate in politics through the publication of &quot;Anhui Suhua Bao&quot;. After its sixteenth issue, the newspaper added an extra 16 columns; the most popular were on military events, Chinese philosophy, hygiene, and astronomy. Almost all of these additional topics were written by Chen. His pen-name was San&#x27;ai (三爱/三愛). At least 50 articles were published under this name.

====&quot;Tokyo Jiayin Magazine&quot;====
In early 1914, Chen went to Japan, where he worked as an editor and writer in the &quot;Tokyo Jiayin Magazine&quot;, which was published by Zhang Shizhao. Chen once wrote an article entitled &quot;Self Consciousness on Patriotism&quot; (爱国心与自觉/愛國心與自覺) which conveyed a strong sense of patriotism and encouraged people to fight for their freedom. It promoted the idea that those who love their country should spare no pains to protect it, and should fight for the rights of its citizens. This group of people should work together towards the same goal harmoniously. The article was threatening to Yuan Shikai&#x27;s government, as it tried to arouse the self-consciousness of the Chinese people. This preliminary magazine was released for 10 issues in total, before it was prevented from publishing. The magazine was resumed in 1925 in Beijing with the new name &quot;Tokyo Jiayin Weekly&quot;.

====&quot;New Youth&quot; magazine====
In 1915, Chen started an influential monthly periodical in the French Concession of Shanghai, &quot;The Youth Magazine&quot; (青年杂志/青年雜誌), which was later renamed &quot;New Youth&quot; (新青年, literally &quot;New Youth&quot;). It became one of the most influential magazines among the students who participated in the May Fourth Movement. Chen was the chief editor of this periodical. It was published by Qunyi Shushe, and ended publication in 1926. The magazine mainly advocated the use of vernacular language, socialism, and Marxism, and was strongly against feudalism.

In 1917, Chen became a lecturer of Chinese Literature, and a Dean of Peking University. Having the approval from the Cai Yuanpei, the Chancellor of the Peking University, Chen collected the writings of the students which he appreciated most, which especially included Li Dazhao, Hu Shih, Lu Xun and Qian Yuan. In order to expand the editorial department, &quot;New Youth&quot; was moved to Beijing at this time, and in February 1917, Chen used &quot;New Youth&quot; to promote science, democracy and modern literature, and to discourage the study of paleography and classical Chinese literature. The magazine began to advocate the use of the scientific method and Logical arguments towards the achievement of political, economic, social, ethical, and democratic goals.

&quot;New Youth&quot; focused on different concerns during various phases of its development. From 1915 to 1918 it opposed Chinese conservatism (especially conservatism associated with Confucianism) and promoted the development of democracy. During this phase, it became influential among the New Culture Movement. From 1919 to 1921, until the formation of the Chinese Communist Party, it focused on promoting socialism, and Marxism. From 1921 to 1926, it published and disseminated the prevailing views of the members of the Communist Party.

====Minor publications====

The Shanghai local government banned the sale of a publication called &quot;&quot;Guomin Ribao&quot; (国民日报/國民日報) on 1 December 1903. After this, Chen twice planned to found a paper called &quot;Aiguo Xinbao&quot;&quot; but failed because of pressure from different groups. Chen continued to express his discontent towards the government in his later publications. When &quot;Anhui Suhua Bao&quot; was published on 31 March 1904, Chen was responsible for all editing and distribution.

On 27 November 1918, Chen started another magazine, the &quot;Weekly Review&quot; (每周评论/每週評論) with Li Dazhao in order to criticize the politics of his time in a more direct way and to promote democracy, science, and modern literature. Chen also edited &quot;Tokyo Jiayin Magazine&quot; (甲寅杂志/甲寅雜誌) and &quot;Science Magazine&quot; (科学杂志/科學雜誌). Later, he became the Editor-in-Chief of the newspapers &quot;Minli Bao&quot; (民立报/民立報) and &quot;Shenzhou Daily&quot; (神州日报/神州日報).

From 1908 to 1910, two students at Peking University, Deng Zhongxia and Xu Deheng, founded the &quot;Guomin&quot; magazine and invited Li Dazhao to be a consultant for the magazine. From 1912 to 1913, Chen, with the assistance of Luo Jialun and Fu Sinian, published a paper named &quot;Xinchao She&quot;.

====Chen&#x27;s contribution to Chinese journalism====
Chen set a precedent for future writers via the intentionally controversial nature of his publications. He insisted on telling the truth to the Chinese people and strengthening the Chinese media for later generations. By publishing newspapers and magazines concerning political issues, Chen provided a channel for the general public to express their ideas or discontent towards the existing government. Chen believed that the purpose of mass media was to reveal the truth. At a young age, Chen had already established his first periodical, Guomin Ribao, in which he criticized many social and political problems evident in the late Qing dynasty. With a view to the things mentioned above, his contribution was said to be influential to journalism as a whole. Chen&#x27;s writing brought the standards of Chinese journalism closer to those of other, more liberal societies of his time.

===Poetry===
In 1918, &quot;New Youth&quot; published contemporary poetry by Hu Shih and Liu Bannong, written in vernacular Chinese, becoming one of the first publications in China to encourage poetry in vernacular Chinese. Eventually, every article in &quot;New Youth&quot; was written in vernacular Chinese. &quot;New Youth&quot; was one of the first publications in China to adopt and use punctuations marks, and popularized their use through its popularity and wide readership.

===Final letters and articles===
Gregor Benton compiled and translated into English the last of Chen Duxiu&#x27;s writings, publishing them under the title &quot;Chen Duxiu&#x27;s last articles and letters, 1937–1942&quot;.

==Intellectual contributions and disputes==

===Crisis with Cai Yuanpei===

In the second edition of &quot;New Youth,&quot; Chen prepared to publish Cai Yuanpei&#x27;s speech, the &quot;Speech on Freedom of Religion&quot; (蔡元培先生在信教自由会之演说/蔡元培先生在信教自由會之演說), along with an editorial interpreting its meaning and significance. Before its appearance in &quot;New Youth&quot;, Cai criticized Chen for misinterpreting this speech. Chen later admitted that &quot;the publication of my speech in &quot;New Youth&quot; included a number of mistakes.&quot; Fortunately, Cai did not become angry with Chen and the publication was then amended before publishing.

===Crisis with Hu Shih===

This crisis was about the political stand of &quot;New Youth&quot;. Hu Shih insisted that &quot;New Youth&quot; should be politically neutral and the publication should be concerned with Chinese philosophy. Chen attacked his rationale by publishing &quot;Talking Politics&quot; (谈政治/談政治) in the 8th edition. Because Chen was invited by Chen Jiongming to be the Education officer in Guangzhou in mid-December 1920, he decided to assign the publication to Mao Dun, who belonged to the Shanghai Communist Party.

Hu Shih was dissatisfied with this responsibility and their friendship and professional relationship ended. Later, Chen wrote to Hu Shih about his dissatisfaction with Hu&#x27;s intimacy with many conservative faculty members of Peking University. Especially troubling to Chen was Hu&#x27;s relationship with Liang Qichao, a supporter of the Duan Qirui government and their anti-new wave ideology, which made Chen greatly dissatisfied.

=== Crisis with Liang Shuming ===
Chen Duxiu viewed human history as a whole thing, as a single entity. A monistic evolutionary historical model was suggested by Chen Duxiu&#x27;s argument. On the other hand, Liang Shuming clearly divided cultures into three types: European culture, Chinese culture and Indian culture. European culture is characterized as the “primary, forward-seeking orientation”; Chinese culture is the “secondary, harmony and middle-ground-seeking orientation”; and Indian culture, the “tertiary, self-reflective and backward-looking orientation.” Chen Duxiu said &quot;In many people’s estimation, the differences among Chinese, Indian, and European culture are almost entirely differences in ethnicity, and thus are not limited to those of culture.” This argument is clearly about criticizing Liang&#x27;s Eastern and Western Cultures and Philosophies.

===Views on Confucianism and traditional values===

Chen suggested six guiding principles in &quot;New Youth&quot; with an article called &quot;Warning the youth&quot; (). This article was aimed at removing the old beliefs of Confucianism. &quot;Warning the Youth&quot; promoted six values:

#Independence instead of servility;
#Progressivism instead of conservatism;
#Aggression instead of passivity;
#Cosmopolitanism instead of isolationism;
#Utilitarian beliefs instead of impractical traditions;
#Scientific knowledge instead of visionary insight.

&quot;New Youth&quot; was one of the most influential magazines in early modern Chinese history. Chen introduced many new ideas into popular Chinese culture, including individualism, democracy, humanism, and the use of the scientific method, and he advocated the abandonment of Confucianism for the adoption Communism.

Seen in this light, &quot;New Youth&quot; found itself in a position to provide an alternative intellectual influence for many young people. Under the banners of democracy and science, traditional Confucian ethics became the target of attack from &quot;New Youth&quot;. In its first issue, Chen called for young generation to struggle against Confucianism by &quot;theories of literary revolution&quot; ().

To Chen, Confucianism was to be rooted out because:

#It advocated superfluous ceremonies and preached the morality of meek compliance, making the Chinese people weak and passive, unfit to struggle and compete in the modern world.
#It promoted family values and rejected the idea that the individual was the basic unit of society.
#It upheld the inequality of the status of individuals.
#It stressed filial piety, which made men subservient and dependent.
#It preached orthodoxy of thought, disregarding freedom of thinking and expression.

Chen called for the destruction of tradition, and his attacks on traditionalism gave new options to the youth of his time. New Youth was a major influence within the May Fourth Movement.

===Views on democracy and the Soviet Union===

In &quot;My Fundamental Opinions&quot; written in November 1940, Chen Duxiu wrote about his views concerning democracy, socialism and the Soviet Union. He reflected on the Communist movement and provided his thoughts on related issues, fundamentally rejecting some of the core tenets of Communism. 
#We should understand the lessons of Soviet Union in the past two decades without prejudices, scientifically rather than religiously reevaluate Bolshevik theory and its leadership. We can not attribute all the crimes to Stalin, such as the problems about democratic institutions under the dictatorship of proletariat.
# Democracy of the proletariat is not a meaningless noun. It shares common content with bourgeoise democracy like the freedom of assembly, association, speech, publication and strike. What is especially important is the freedom of opposition parties. Without those things, parliament would also become as worthless as a soviet. 
# Democracy in politics and socialism in economy is mutually supportive instead of opposing things. Democracy is not inseparable from capitalism and bourgeoisie. If the political parties of the proletariat also oppose democracy because of their opposition against capitalism, even if so called &#x27;the revolution of proletariat&#x27; really appears, without democracy&#x27;s disinfection of bureaucracy, only bureaucratic regimes like Stalin&#x27;s would appear in the world, brutal, corrupted, hypocritical, deceptive, rotten. Socialism is absolutely impossible. There is absolutely no such thing like &#x27;the dictatorship of proletariat&#x27;. It is just the dictatorship of the party, finally the dictatorship of the leader. Any kind of dictatorship is bound with brutality, obscurantism, deception and corruption and rotten bureaucratic politics.

<text>Kokopelli () is a fertility deity, usually depicted as a humpbacked flute player (often with feathers or antenna-like protrusions on his head), who is venerated by some Native American cultures in the Southwestern United States. Like most fertility deities, Kokopelli presides over both childbirth and agriculture. He is also a trickster god and represents the spirit of music.

==Myths==

Among the Hopi, Kokopelli carries unborn children on his back and distributes them to women; for this reason, young girls often fear him. He often takes part in rituals relating to marriage, and Kokopelli himself is sometimes depicted with a , a woman called Kokopelmimi by the Hopi. It is said that Kokopelli can be seen on the full and waning moon, much like the &quot;man&quot; or the &quot;rabbit&quot; on the moon.

Kokopelli also presides over the reproduction of game animals, and for this reason, he is often depicted with animal companions such as rams and deer. Other common creatures associated with him include sun-bathing animals such as snakes, or water-loving animals such as lizards and insects.

In his domain over agriculture, Kokopelli&#x27;s flute-playing chases away the winter and brings about spring. Many tribes, such as the Zuni, also associate Kokopelli with the rains. He frequently appears with Paiyatamu, another flutist, in depictions of maize-grinding ceremonies. Some tribes say he carries seeds and babies on his back.

In recent years, the emasculated (i.e. non-ithyphallic) version of Kokopelli has been adopted as a broader symbol of the Southwestern United States as a whole. His image adorns countless items such as t-shirts, ball caps, key-chains, and patio decor. He is also noticeable on the wall by the swimming pool on the home of Walter White (Bryan Cranston) in several episodes of Breaking Bad. A bicycle trail between Grand Junction, Colorado, and Moab, Utah, is now known as the Kokopelli Trail.
==Origins and development==

Kokopelli has been revered since at least the time of the Hohokam, Yuman, and Ancestral Puebloan peoples. The first known images of him appear on Hohokam pottery dated to sometime between 750 and 850 AD.

Kokopelli may have originally been a representation of Aztec traders, known as &quot;pochtecas&quot;, who may have traveled to this region from northern Mesoamerica. These traders brought their goods in sacks slung across their backs and this sack may have evolved into Kokopelli&#x27;s familiar hump; some tribes consider Kokopelli to have been a trader. These men may also have used flutes to announce themselves as friendly as they approached a settlement. This origin is still in doubt, however, since the first known images of Kokopelli predate the major era of Mesoamerican-Ancestral Pueblo peoples trade by several hundred years, as well as the Aztec Empire and its &quot;pochtecas&quot;.

Many believe that Kokopelli was more than a trader, and more significantly, an important conveyor of information and trinkets from afar. As a storyteller par excellence, Kokopelli had the gift of languages, with a formidable repertoire of body-language storytelling skills to complement his many talents. Kokopelli&#x27;s usual noisy announcement upon arrival secured both the identity, and therefore the safety, of his unique presence into a community. Often accompanied by an apprentice in his travels and trade, Kokopelli was important in linking distant and diverse communities together. In the South American Andes, the &#x27;Ekeko&#x27; character functioned in much the same way. Upon arrival, his banging and clanging of his wares dangling all about his person signaled to all that a night of entertainment and trade of his goods and talismans was at hand.

Even today, occasional outside visitors may be called or referred to as &#x27;Kokopelli&#x27; when they bring news, stories, and trinkets from the outside world to share with the little pueblos or villages.

Another theory is that Kokopelli is actually an anthropomorphic insect. Many of the earliest depictions of Kokopelli make him very insect-like in appearance. The name &quot;Kokopelli&quot; may be a combination of &quot;Koko&quot;, another Hopi and Zuni deity, and &quot;pelli&quot;, the Hopi and Zuni word for the robber fly, an insect with a prominent proboscis and a prominently rounded back. A more recent etymology is that Kokopelli means literally &quot;kachina hump&quot;. Because the Hopi were the tribe from whom the Spanish explorers first learned of the god, their name is the one most commonly used.
Kokopelli is one of the most easily recognized figures found in the petroglyphs and pictographs of the Southwest. The earliest known petroglyph of the figure dates to about 1000 AD. The Spanish missionaries in the area convinced the Hopi craftsmen to usually omit the phallus from their representations of the figure. As with most kachinas, the Hopi Kokopelli was often represented by a human dancer. 

A similar humpbacked figure is found in artifacts of the Mississippian culture of the United States southeast. Between approximately 1200 to 1400 AD, water vessels were crafted in the shape of a humpbacked woman. These forms may represent a cultural heroine or founding ancestor, and may also reflect concepts related to the life-giving blessings of water and fertility.

<doc id="92858" wikidata="Q2254583" url="?curid=92858" title="Hopi mythology">
<text>The [[Hopi]] maintain a complex religious and mythological tradition stretching back over centuries. However, it is difficult to definitively state what all Hopis as a group believe. Like the oral traditions of many other societies, Hopi mythology is not always told consistently and each Hopi mesa, or even each village, may have its own version of a particular story, but &quot;in essence the variants of the Hopi myth bear marked similarity to one another.&quot; It is also not clear that the stories told to non-Hopis, such as anthropologists and ethnographers, represent genuine Hopi beliefs or are merely stories told to the curious while keeping safe the more sacred Hopi teachings. As folklorist Harold Courlander states, &quot;there is a Hopi reticence about discussing matters that could be considered ritual secrets or religion-oriented traditions.&quot; 

In addition, the Hopis have always been willing to assimilate foreign ideas into their cosmology if they are proven effective for such practical necessities as bringing rain. The Hopi had at least some contact with Europeans as early as the 16th century, and some believe that European Christian traditions may have entered Hopi cosmology at some point. Indeed, Spanish missions were built in several Hopi villages starting in 1629 and were in operation until the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. However, after the revolt, it was the Hopi alone of all the Pueblo peoples who kept the Spanish out of their villages permanently, and regular contact with whites did not begin again until nearly two centuries later. The Hopi mesas have therefore been seen as &quot;relatively unacculturated&quot; at least through the early 20th century, and it may be posited that the European influence on the core themes of Hopi mythology was slight.

==Major deities==
Most Hopi creation stories center around Tawa, the sun spirit. Tawa is the creator, and it was he who formed the &quot;First World&quot; out of Tokpella, or endless space, as well as its original inhabitants. It is still traditional for Hopi mothers to seek a blessing from the sun for their newborn children. Other accounts have it that Tawa, or Taiowa, first created Sotuknang, whom he called his nephew, and sent him to create the nine universes according to his plan. Sotuknang also created Spider Woman, who served as a messenger for the creator and was an intercessor between the deity and the people. In some versions of the Hopi creation myth, she creates all life, under the direction of Sotuknang. Yet other stories tell that life was created by Hard Being Woman of the West and Hard Being Woman of the East, while the sun merely observed the process.

Masauwu (Maasaw, Mausauu), Skeleton Man, was the Spirit of Death, Earth God, door keeper to the Fifth World, and the Keeper of Fire. He was also the Master of the Upper World, or the Fourth World, and was there when the good people escaped the wickedness of the Third World for the promise of the Fourth. Masauwu is described as wearing a hideous mask, but again showing the diversity of myths among the Hopi, Masauwu was alternately described as a handsome, bejewelled man beneath his mask or as a bloody, fearsome creature. He is also assigned certain benevolent attributes. One story has it that it was Masauwu who helped settle the Hopi at Oraibi and gave them stewardship over the land. He also charged them to watch for the coming of the Pahana (see section below), the Lost White Brother. Other important deities include the twin war gods, the kachinas, and the trickster, Coyote.

Maize is vital to Hopi subsistence and religion. &quot;For traditional Hopis, corn is the central bond. Its essence, physically, spiritually, and symbolically, pervades their existence. For the people of the mesas corn is sustenance, ceremonial object, prayer offering, symbol, and sentient being unto itself. Corn is the Mother in the truest sense that people take in the corn and the corn becomes their flesh, as mother milk becomes the flesh of the child.&quot;

==Four Worlds==
Barry Pritzker writes: &quot;According to Hopi legend, when time and space began, the sun spirit (Tawa) created the First World, in which insectlike creatures lived unhappily in caves. With the goal of improvement, Tawa sent a spirit called Spider Grandmother to the world below. Spider Grandmother led the first creatures on a long trip to the Second World, in which they took on the appearance of wolves and bears. As these animals were no happier than the previous ones, however, Tawa created a new, Third World, and again sent Spider Grandmother to convey the wolves and bears there. By the time they arrived, they had become people.&quot; Spider Grandmother taught them weaving and pottery, and a hummingbird brought them a fire drill.

===Entrance into the Fourth World===

Two main versions exist as to the Hopis&#x27; emergence into the present Fourth World.

In one version, after evil broke out amongst the people in the Third World, with the help of Spider Grandmother, or bird spirits, a hollow bamboo reed grew at the opening of the Third World into the Fourth World. This opening, &quot;sipapu&quot;, is traditionally viewed to be the Grand Canyon. According to Barry Pritzker, &quot;the people with good hearts (kindness) made it to the Fourth World.&quot;

The other version (mainly told in Oraibi) has it that Tawa destroyed the Third World in a great flood. Before the destruction, Spider Grandmother sealed the more righteous people into hollow reeds which were used as boats. On arrival on a small piece of dry land, the people saw nothing around them but more water, even after planting a large bamboo shoot, climbing to the top, and looking about. Spider Woman then told the people to make boats out of more reeds, and using island &quot;stepping-stones&quot; along the way, the people sailed east until they arrived on the mountainous coasts of the Fourth World.

While it may not be possible to positively ascertain which is the original or &quot;more correct&quot; story, Harold Courlander writes, at least in Oraibi (the oldest of the Hopi villages), little children are often told the story of the &quot;sipapu&quot;, and the story of an ocean voyage is related to them when they are older. He states that even the name of the Hopi Water Clan (Patkinyamu) literally means &quot;a dwelling-on-water&quot; or &quot;houseboat&quot;. However, he notes the &quot;sipapu&quot; story is centered on Walpi and is more accepted among Hopis generally.

According to Barry Pritzker, &quot;In this Fourth World, the people learned many lessons about the proper way to live. They learned to worship Masauwu, who ensured that the dead return safely to the Underworld and who gave them the four sacred tablets that, in symbolic form, outlined their wanderings and their proper behavior in the Fourth World. Masauwu also told the people to watch for the &quot;Pahána&quot;, the Lost White Brother.&quot;

===Migrations===
Upon their arrival in the Fourth World, the Hopis divided and went on a series of great migrations throughout the land. Sometimes they would stop and build a town, then abandon it to continue on with the migration. They would leave their symbols behind on the rocks to show that Hopi had been there. Long the divided people wandered in groups of families, eventually forming clans named after an event or sign that a particular group received upon its journey. These clans would travel for some time as a unified community, but almost inevitably a disagreement would occur, the clan would split and each portion would go its separate way. However, as the clans traveled, they would often join together forming large groups, only to have these associations disband, and then be reformed with other clans. These alternate periods of harmonious living followed by wickedness, contention, and separation play an important part of the Hopi mythos. This pattern seemingly began in the First World and continues even into recent history.

In the course of their migration, each Hopi clan was to go to the farthest extremity of the land in every direction. Far in the north was a land of snow and ice which was called the &quot;Back Door&quot;, but this was closed to the Hopi. However, the Hopi say that other peoples came through the Back Door into the Fourth World. &quot;Back Door&quot; could refer to the Bering land bridge, which connected Asia with North America. The Hopi were led on their migrations by various signs, or were helped along by Spider Woman. Eventually, the Hopi clans finished their prescribed migrations and were led to their current location in northeastern Arizona.

Most Hopi traditions have it that they were given their land by Masauwu, the Spirit of Death and Master of the Fourth World.

===Sacred Hopi tablets===

Hopi tradition tells of sacred tablets which were imparted to the Hopi by various deities. Like most of Hopi mythology, accounts differ as to when the tablets were given and in precisely what manner.

Perhaps the most important was said to be in the possession of the Fire Clan, and is related to the return of the Pahana. In one version, an elder of the Fire Clan worried that his people would not recognize the Pahana when he returned from the east. He therefore etched various designs including a human figure into a stone, and then broke off the section of the stone which included the figure&#x27;s head. This section was given to Pahana and he was told to bring it back with him so that the Hopi would not be deceived by a witch or sorcerer.

==Kachinas==
One of the Hopi religious societies is the &quot;katsina&quot; society. According to Barry Pritzker, &quot;Reflecting the close association between the world of the living and that of the dead, spirits play an integral role in the land of the living. They are associated with clouds and with benevolent supernatural entities called &quot;katsinam&quot; (the plural of katsina), which inhabit the San Francisco Peaks just north of Flagstaff, Arizona.&quot; According to Susanne and Jake Page, the katsinam are &quot;the spirits of all things in the universe, of rocks, stars, animals, plants, and ancestors who have lived good lives.&quot;

Around Kachina masks and Kachina dancers appear as rock art. 

Raymond Friday Locke discusses the Hopi legend of the Pahana writing that &quot;The Hopis...had long anticipated the coming of Pahana and, either by coincidence or because of a common root of the legends, Pahana was due to visit the Hopi in the very same year that Quetzalcoatl was expected to return to the Aztecs. He arrived some twenty-one years later in the person of the Spaniard Pedro de Tovar, one of Coronado&#x27;s conquistadors, and was the first white man to be seen by the Hopis and very probably the Navajo. Unlike the Aztecs, the Hopis put this Spanish Pahana to a series of tests, and when he failed them they sent him on his way.&quot;
The Hopi say that during a great drought, they heard singing and dancing coming from the San Francisco Peaks. Upon investigation, they met the Kachinas who returned with the Hopi to their villages and taught them various forms of agriculture. The Hopi believe that for six months of the year, Kachina spirits live in the Hopi villages. The nine day &quot;Niman&quot; or Going Home ceremony concludes the Kachina season with an outdoor Kachina Dance where the line of Kachinas bring harvest gifts for the spectators and Kachina dolls for the young girls. Different sets of Kachinas perform each year. Most favored is the Hemis group of Kachinas who perform accompanied by a variety of Kachina manas. After the Going Home Dance in late-July or early-August, the Kachinas return to the San Francisco Peaks for six months. The Hopi believe that these dances are vital for the continued harmony and balance of the world. It serves the further and vital purpose of bringing rain to the Hopi&#x27;s parched homeland.

==Pahana==

The true Pahana (or Bahana) is the Lost White Brother of the Hopi. Most versions have it that the Pahana or Elder Brother left for the east at the time that the Hopi entered the Fourth World and began their migrations. However, the Hopi say that he will return again and at his coming the wicked will be destroyed and a new age of peace, the Fifth World, will be ushered into the world. As mentioned above, it is said he will bring with him a missing section of a sacred Hopi stone in the possession of the Fire Clan, and that he will come wearing red. Traditionally, Hopis are buried facing east in expectation of the Pahana who will come from that direction.

The Hopi realized that the Spanish were not the Pahana based upon the destruction of a Hopi town by the Spanish. Thus when the Spanish arrived at the village of Awatovi, they drew a line of cornmeal as a sign for the Spanish not to enter the village, but this was ignored. While some Hopi wanted to fight the invaders, it was decided to try a peaceful approach in the hope that the Spanish would eventually leave. However, Spanish accounts record a short skirmish at Awatovi before the Hopis capitulated.

== In popular culture ==
The 1982 art film/avant-garde opera &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot; references both the Hopi term &quot;Ko.yan.nis.qatsi&quot; (&quot;life out of balance&quot;), and three Hopi prophecies —i.e. warnings or eschatology.
* &quot;If we dig precious things from the land, we will invite disaster.&quot;
* &quot;Near the day of Purification, there will be cobwebs spun back and forth in the sky.&quot;
* &quot;A container of ashes might one day be thrown from the sky, which could burn the land and boil the oceans.&quot;

David Lanz and Paul Speer&#x27;s 1987 new-age album &quot;Desert Vision&quot; has a track named &quot;Tawtoma.&quot;

The novel by Tony Hillerman, &quot;The Dark Wind&quot;, first published in 1982, discusses Hopi mythology throughout the story, as key characters are Hopi men, and events of the story occur near important shrines or during an important ceremony. The fictional Navajo sergeant Jim Chee works with fictional Hopi Albert &quot;Cowboy&quot; Dashee, who is a deputy for Coconino County, Arizona, and speaks Hopi and English, translating for Chee on occasion, as well as explaining shrines and ceremonies to him.

In the 2001 novel &quot;American Gods&quot; by Neil Gaiman, Mr. Ibis (an incarnation of the ancient Egyptian god Thoth) discusses the reluctance of scientists to accept evidence of pre-Columbian visitors to the Americas, and refers to the &quot;sipapu&quot; story as historical fact: &quot;Heaven knows what&#x27;ll happen if they ever actually find the Hopi emergence tunnels. That&#x27;ll shake a few things up, you just wait.&quot;

In the Jordan Peele film &quot;Us&quot;, Addy as a little girl in 1986 walks up to and into the Shaman&#x27;s Vision Quest attraction, the entrance of which is topped by a Native American man with a headdress on and his right hand pointing at potential questers. Underneath him, just above the entrance, light bulbs form the words &quot;FIND YOURSELF&quot; and an arrow slowly flashing on and off. Although difficult to hear, closed captioning makes clear that a recorded narration on the speaker system for the attraction is recounting aspects of the Hopi creation story:

:These, the earth and water, he divided into places from which life could spring. The mountains and the valleys and the waters were all where they belonged. Then Sotuknang went to Taiowa and said, &quot;I want you to see what I have done. And I have done well.&quot; And Taiowa looked and said, &quot;It is very good. But you are not done with it. Now you must create life of all kinds and set it in motion according to my plan.&quot; [A fake owl, hooting, pops out of a fake tree, so a few words are obscured.] ... and went into space and gathered substance to create his helper, the Spider Woman. &quot;Look all about you, Spider Woman,&quot; said Sotuknang. &quot;Here now is endless space, but in the world, there is no joyful movement. The world ...&quot; [Then the electricity goes out.]

Decades later, when the adult Addy, with her husband and children, return to the same boardwalk where Shaman&#x27;s Vision Quest was, it is now called Merlin&#x27;s Forest.

<doc id="92862" wikidata="Q324956" url="?curid=92862" title="Conrad Hilton">
<text>Conrad Nicholson Hilton (December 25, 1887 – January 3, 1979) was an American hotel magnate and politician who founded the Hilton Hotels chain. From 1912 to 1916, Hilton was a Republican representative in the first New Mexico Legislature, but became disillusioned with the &quot;inside deals&quot; of politics. In 1919, he purchased his first hotel, the Mobley Hotel in Cisco, Texas, for and subsequently capitalized on the oil boom. The rooms were rented out in eight-hour shifts. He continued to buy and sell hotels, and eventually established the world&#x27;s first international hotel chain. When he died in 1979, he left the bulk of his estate to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation.

==Early life==
Hilton was born on December 25, 1887, in San Antonio, Socorro County, New Mexico, to Norwegian-born Augustus Halvorsen Hilton (1854–1919) and Mary Genevieve Laufersweiler, a devout Catholic of German descent. He attended the Goss Military Academy (since renamed as the New Mexico Military Institute) and St. Michael&#x27;s College (later called the Santa Fe University of Art and Design), and the New Mexico School of Mines (now New Mexico Tech). From 1912 to 1916, Hilton was a Republican representative in the first New Mexico Legislature, when the state was newly formed. Hilton became frustrated with the &quot;bureaucracy, slowness, cheating, lying, and inside deals of politics,&quot; and in 1916, he refused to run for a fourth term, instead endorsing his longtime political ally, Quianu Robinson.

He served two years in the United States Army during World War I. After completing Officer Training School, he became a second lieutenant, and served in Paris in the Quartermaster Corps. While Conrad was in France with the army after the war, his father was killed in a car accident.

The most enduring influences to shape Hilton&#x27;s philanthropic philosophy, beyond that of his parents, were the Catholic Church and his sisters. He credited his mother with guiding him to prayer and the church whenever he was troubled or dismayed—from the boyhood loss of a beloved pony, to severe financial losses during the Great Depression. His mother continually told him that prayer was the best investment he would ever make.

==Career==
As a young boy, Hilton developed entrepreneurial skills working at his father&#x27;s general store in Socorro County, New Mexico, which was partially converted into a 10-room hotel. This was followed by varied experiences, including a stint as a representative in New Mexico&#x27;s first State Legislature, and a career decision to become a banker.

It was intending to buy a bank that he arrived in Texas at the height of the Texas oil boom. In 1919, he bought his first hotel instead, the 40-room Mobley Hotel in Cisco, Texas, when a bank purchase fell through. The hotel did such brisk business that rooms changed hands as often as three times a day, and the dining room was converted into additional rooms to meet the demand. He went on to buy and build hotels throughout Texas, including the high-rise Dallas Hilton, which opened in 1925; the Abilene Hilton in 1927; Waco Hilton in 1928; and El Paso Hilton in 1930. The first hotel outside of Texas that Hilton built was in 1939 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Today, it is known as the Hotel Andaluz. During the Great Depression, Hilton was nearly forced into bankruptcy and lost several of his hotels. Nevertheless, he was retained as manager of a combined chain, and eventually regained control of his remaining eight hotels.

Over the next decade, he expanded west to California and east to Chicago and New York, crowning his expansions with such acquisitions as the Stevens Hotel in Chicago (then the world&#x27;s largest hotel; it was renamed the Conrad Hilton), and the fabled Waldorf-Astoria in New York City. He formed the Hilton Hotels Corporation in 1946, and Hilton International Company in 1948.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Hilton Hotels&#x27; worldwide expansion facilitated both American tourism and overseas business by American corporations. It was the world&#x27;s first international hotel chain, at the same time establishing a certain worldwide standard for hotel accommodations. In 1954, Hilton Hotels bought The Hotels Statler Company, Inc. for $111 million, then the world&#x27;s largest real estate transaction. In all, Hilton eventually owned 188 hotels in 38 cities across the U.S., including the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C.; the Palmer House in Chicago; and the Plaza Hotel and Waldorf-Astoria in New York City, along with 54 hotels abroad. He later purchased the Carte Blanche Credit Company and an interest in the American Crystal Sugar Company, as well as other enterprises.

Hilton received honorary degrees from the University of Detroit (1953), DePaul University (1954), Barat College (1955), Adelphi College (1957), Sophia University, Tokyo (1963), and the University of Albuquerque (1975). Hilton&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Be My Guest&quot;, was published in 1958 by Prentice Hall. In 1966, Hilton was succeeded as president by his son, Barron, and was elected chairman of the board.

==Personal life==
In 1925, Hilton married Mary Adelaide Barron (1906–1966). They had three sons, Conrad Hilton Jr., Barron Hilton, and Eric Hilton, before divorcing in 1934.

In 1942, Hilton married actress Zsa Zsa Gabor. They had one child, a daughter, Francesca Hilton, before divorcing in 1947. Gabor wrote in her 1991 autobiography &quot;One Lifetime Is Not Enough&quot; that she became pregnant by Hilton only after he raped her during their marriage. Francesca died in 2015, at age 67, from a stroke.

In 1950, Hilton bought Casa Encantada at 10644 Bellagio Road in Bel Air, Los Angeles, and occupied the house until he died in 1979. Hilton described his enchantment with the house as &quot;... a case of love at first sight... I couldn&#x27;t resist it, one of the fabulous houses of the world.&quot; He renamed the property the &quot;Casa Encantada&quot; (&quot;enchanted house&quot;).

In 1957, Hilton was initiated as a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity at New Mexico State University.

In 1976, Hilton married Mary Frances Kelly. Their marriage lasted until his death three years later in 1979.

On January 3, 1979, Hilton died of pneumonia at the age of 91. He was interred at Calvary Hill Cemetery, a Catholic cemetery in Dallas, Texas. He left US$500,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to his two surviving sons, US$100,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to his daughter, Francesca, and US$15,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to each of his grandchildren.

===Hilton family fortune===
In 1969, James C. Taylor presented plans to build a hospitality college on the campus of the University of Houston to Barron Hilton. Barron then presented the plans to his father, who donated US$1.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) for the completion of the project. The Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management opened to students in September 1969.

The bulk of Conrad Hilton&#x27;s estate was left to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, which he established in 1944. His son, Barron Hilton, who spent much of his career helping build the Hilton Hotels Corporation, contested the will—despite having left the company as acting president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board of directors. A settlement was reached, and as a result, Barron Hilton received 4 million shares of the hotel enterprise, the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation received 3.5 million shares, and the remaining 6 million shares were placed in the W. Barron Hilton Charitable Remainder Unitrust. Upon Barron Hilton&#x27;s death, Unitrust assets were transferred to the Hilton Foundation, of which Barron previously served on the Board of Directors as chairman.

In 1983, the Hilton Foundation donated US$21.3 million (equivalent to $ in ) to expand facilities and increase endowment. That gift led to the construction of the South Wing, which opened in 1989, and added of education and meeting space to Hilton College.

On December 25, 2007, Barron Hilton announced that he would leave about 97% of his fortune, then estimated at US$2.36 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ), to a charitable unitrust that would eventually be merged with the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation.

<text>New Youth, also known as La Jeunesse, was a Chinese literary magazine founded by Chen Duxiu and published between 1915 and 1926. It strongly influenced both the New Culture Movement and the later May Fourth Movement.

==Publishing history==

Chen Duxiu founded &quot;Youth Magazine&quot; (Chinese:《青年杂志》) (later renamed &quot;New Youth&quot;) in 1915 in Shanghai, with the initial aim of spreading new thoughts and cultures–especially Western ideals of democracy and science–in order to promote the modernization and progress of Chinese society. In 1921, Chen Duxiu became the cofounder of the Chinese Communist Party. He created the magazine with the hope that young people would express their opinions and thoughts to help save China, and that authors could offer new thoughts for young people at that time. He also sought to advocate for a literary revolution by promoting the use of vernacular Chinese instead of classical Chinese, making literature more accessible to the general public. Another factor in his founding of the magazine was his desire to enlighten the youth; he considered them as the future of the nation, and he therefore wanted to foster in them a sense of patriotism and social responsibility. Chen Duxiu also aimed to critique feudal traditions and promote individual freedom and equality, driving social reform and progress.

In September 1916, the Youth Magazine was renamed New Youth. The reason for the name change was that the Shanghai YMCA accused the Youth Magazine of having a similar name, and demanded that the name be changed. Historians have inferred from this that &quot;the word &#x27;new&#x27; was added to match the name with its advocacy of new ideas and culture.&quot; Chen Duxiu agreed to the name change, possibly to avoid conflict and possibly to give the magazine a fresh and distinctive identity that aligned with its mission of promoting new thoughts and culture.

The term &quot;youth&quot; was not originally part of the Chinese lexicon, but it was introduced by missionaries around the turn of the 20th century. The YMCA, which was established globally in 1844 and introduced to China in 1876, had a significant influence on the use of the term. The YMCA&#x27;s focus on youth work and publications aimed at educating and influencing young people underscored the term&#x27;s adoption in Chinese society.

Its headquarters moved to Beijing in January 1917 when Chen was appointed Chairman of the Chinese Literature Department at Peking University. The team of editors and authors gradually expanded. In Volume 3 of the magazine, senior scholars such as Zhang Shizhao, Cai Yuanpei, and Qian Xuantong were added to the group of authors; however, there were also contributions from young students such as Yun Daiying, Mao Zedong, Chang Naide, and Huang Lingshuang. In August 1917, after the publication of the third volume of New Youth, the Qunyi Book Club found it difficult to continue publishing because of the lack of wide distribution and poor sales, and suspended the publication for a while. After Chen Duxiu&#x27;s vigorous negotiation, the book club reluctantly agreed to renew the publication at the end of the year. In January 1918, New Youth was republished after a 4-month hiatus. Volume 4 was joined by Zhou Zuoren, Shen Yinmo, Shen Jianshi, Chen Daqi and Wang Xingqiong. Volume 6 was edited by Chen Duxiu, Qian Xuantong, Gao Yihan, Hu Shih, Li Dazhao, Shen Yinmo, all of whom were professors at Peking University. Thus, New Youth was transformed from a local publication dominated by Anhui people to a &quot;national&quot; publication dominated by Peking University professors. Those editors initiated the New Culture Movement, promoting science, democracy, and Vernacular Chinese literature.

Influenced by the 1917 Russian October Revolution, &quot;La Jeunesse&quot; increasingly began to promote Marxism, becoming increasingly aligned with the Chinese Communist Party. The trend accelerated after the departure of Hu Shih, who later became the Republic of China&#x27;s Education Minister. Beginning with the September 1, 1920 issue, &quot;La Jeunesse&quot; began to openly support communism when its editorial office was moved back to Shanghai, and with the June 1923 issue it became the official Chinese Communist Party theoretical journal. It was shut down in 1926 by the Nationalist government. &quot;La Jeunesse&quot; influenced thousands of Chinese young people, including many leaders of the Chinese Communist Party.

== Notable contributors ==

===Chen Duxiu===
New Youth magazine was established due to the failure of the Anhui Common Speech Journal, which only lasted for two years. After that, Chen bounced back and forth between Japan and China as the Qing Dynasty crumbled to wait for an opportunity to engage in Chinese politics. Then, Chen Duxiu founded &quot;La Jeunesse&quot; and also edited it in the early years. The editorial policies clearly reflected his personal values by supporting the new and growing vernacular literature movement and the revolution against established societal norms, Confucian values, and the use of Classical Chinese. Chen was the leader of the May Fourth Movement student demonstrations. He was also a founding member of the Chinese Communist Party and provided their theoretical platform.
 
Chen published &quot;A Letter to Youth&quot; (Chinese: 敬告青年) in the first issue of September 15, 1915. The letter issued six challenges:
* Be independent and not enslaved (Chinese: 自由的而非奴隶的)
* Be progressive and not conservative (Chinese: 进步的而非保守的)
* Be in the forefront and not lagging behind (Chinese: 进取的而非退隐的)
* Be internationalist and not isolationist (Chinese: 世界的而非锁国的)
* Be practical and not rhetorical (Chinese: 实利的而非虚文的)
* Be scientific and not superstitious (Chinese: 科学的而非想象的)

The letter further emphasized the urgency of pursuing science and liberty in order to remove the twin chains of feudalism and ignorance from the general population.

===Chen Hengzhe===
Chen Hengzhe was famous for being the first Chinese female professor, Western history professor, and the first person who published non-Chinese Western history. Chen Hengzhe published her short story “Raindrops&quot; (Chinese: 小雨点) in September 1920, making her the first female writer to use the new vernacular style. It was the first Chinese children&#x27;s story. She also published a collection of her works entitled &quot;Raindrops&quot; in 1928. Chen was among the first ten women to study overseas on government scholarships. She graduated from Vassar College and the University of Chicago. The first vernacular Chinese fiction was her short story &quot;One Day&quot; (Chinese: 一日), published 1917 in an overseas student quarterly (Chinese:《留美学生季报》). This was a year before the publication of Lu Xun&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, which has often been incorrectly credited as the first vernacular Chinese fiction.

===Hu Shih===
Hu Shih was arguably the most influential Chinese intellectual in the 20th century. He frequently published speeches at Beijing University and other places. Over his lifetime authored 44 books and numerous articles which influenced tens of thousands of Chinese people. Hu Shih promoted family planning, female equality, free marriage, and the need to have a child or not. Hu Shih was one of the early editors. He published a landmark article &quot;Essay on Creating a Revolutionary `New Literature&quot; (Chinese: 建设的文学革命论) in the April 18, 1918 issue. He wrote that the mission of this language revolution is &quot;a literature of the national language (Guoyu, Chinese: 国語), a national language of literature&quot; (Original Text: 国语的文学，文学的国语。). Hu then went on to reason that for thousands of years, the written language was bound by scholars using Classical Chinese, a dead language. The vernacular, on the other hand, is living and adapts to the age. He urged authors to write in the vernacular in order to describe life as it is, reasoning that Chinese literature had a limited range of subject matter because it used a dead language. Using a living language would therefore open up a wealth of material for writers. He also argued that massive translations of western literature would both increase the range of literature and serve as examples to emulate. This was a seminal and prescient essay about the modern Chinese language. Hu Shih was an important figure in the transformation of the modern Chinese written and printed language.

In the July 15 issue, Hu published an essay entitled, &quot;Chastity&quot; (Chinese: 贞操问题). In the traditional Chinese context, this refers not only to virginity before marriage, but specifically to women remaining chaste before they marry and after their husband&#x27;s death (Chinese: 守贞). He wrote that this is an unequal and illogical view of life, that there is no natural or moral law upholding such a practice, that chastity is a mutual value for both men and women, and that he vigorously opposes any legislation favoring traditional practices on chastity. (There was a movement to introduce traditional Confucian value systems into law at the time.) Hu Shih also wrote a short play on the subject (see Drama section below).

These are examples of Hu Shih&#x27;s progressive views. They were quite radical at that time, which was only a short six years after the overthrow of the Chinese imperial system. The Xinhai Revolution, as it was called, created two branches in the 1920s: the Nationalist (Kuomintang) and Chinese communist parties. Hu Shi tried to focus the editorial policy on literature. Chen Duxiu and others insisted on addressing social and political issues. Hu was a lifelong establishment figure in the Nationalist government and left &quot;La Jeunesse&quot; when its communist direction became clear.

=== Lu Xun ===

Lu Xun was an important contributor to the magazine. His first short story, &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, (Chinese: 狂人日记) was published in &quot;La Jeunesse&quot; in 1918. The story was inspired by Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s story &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;. While Chinese literature has an ancient tradition, the short story was a new form at that time, so this was one of the first Chinese short stories. It was later included in Lu&#x27;s first collection, &quot;A Call to Arms&quot;, (Chinese: 呐喊) which also included his most well known novella, &quot;The True Story of Ah Q&quot;, (Chinese: 阿Q正传). &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; records a scholar&#x27;s growing suspicion that the Confucian classics brainwash people into cannibalism. Lu Xun symbolized the cruel and inhumane nature of old traditional Chinese society&#x27;s structure in this manner. Despite being a harsh metaphor, it was not seen as exceptional due to numerous other contemporary indictments of the old society which were equally scathing. Other fiction by Lu Xun published in &quot;La Jeunesse&quot; includes &quot;Kong Yiji&quot; (Chinese: 孔乙己) and &quot;Medicine&quot; (Chinese: 药).The madness in Lu Xun’s Diary of Madman not only indicates a self-consciousness that is radically modern in breaking with a tradition, but also demarcates an oppositional and new symbolic practice and order.

=== Li Dazhao ===

Li Dazhao (1889–1927), had played an important role in the New Culture Movement and would soon become the cofounder of the Chinese Communist Party. Li Dazhao was the magazine&#x27;s chief collaborator in the Chinese Communist Party, and published, among other things, an introduction to Marxist theory in the May 1919 issue of &quot;New Youth&quot;. In it, he also argued that China, while not possessing a significant urban proletariat, could be viewed as an entire nation that had been exploited by capitalist imperialist countries.

=== Mao Zedong ===
Mao Zedong, the founding father of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, contributed articles against the oppression of women under Confucianism and on the importance of physical fitness to the magazine in his youth. &quot;The well-known quotation of Mao Zedong (1893–1976), cited above, which compares young people to the morning sun, claimed for youth the authority to define the nation’s future and endowed it with all the power to make changes that would revolutionize society.&quot; In April 1927, the 38-year-old Li Daozhao was arrested and then killed by a warlord in Beijing University.

=== Liu Bannong ===

Liu Bannong was an important contributor to the magazine starting from 1916, invited by Chen Duxiu. His article &quot;&quot;&quot;My View on Literary Reform: What is literature?&quot; () was published in &quot;La Jeunesse&quot; in 1917. He suggested both on the content and the form of literary reform.

== Significant articles ==

=== &quot;The Draft of Literature Revolution&quot; (Chinese: 文学改良刍议) ===
The ideas behind Hu Shi&#x27;s literary revolution were rooted in his various personal experiences. Initially, it was the pamphlets from Zhong Wen&#x27;ao, a secretary at Tsinghua University&#x27;s student supervision office, that sparked his thoughts on Chinese script reform. In 1915, he discussed the issue of romanizing Chinese characters with his friend Zhao Yuanren. However, Hu believed that Chinese characters, as an educational medium, could not be abolished, leading him to propose that teaching methods be improved. The real motivation for Hu to consider replacing classical Chinese with vernacular Chinese came from his discussions with friends like Mei Guangdi and Ren Shuyong at Ithaca from the summer of 1915 to August 1916. These debates made Hu more radical, leading him to propose the slogan &quot;literary revolution,&quot; which he first mentioned in a poem in 1915. Despite opposition from Mei and others, Hu became more convinced of the potential of vernacular literature and decided to stop writing in classical Chinese, focusing instead on vernacular poetry.

On January 1, 1917, Volume 2, Number 5, Hu Shi published &quot;Wen xue gai liang chu yi&quot;, which put &quot;not avoiding vulgar words and phrases&quot; at the end, with the purpose of &quot;solemnly putting forward my proposition of vernacular literature&quot;, and ultimately came to the conclusion that &quot;vernacular literature will be the authentic literature of China&quot;, which became the &quot;fuse&quot; that ignited the &quot;Literary Revolution&quot;. Wen xue gai liang chu yi was published in &quot;New Youth&quot;, Vol. 2, No. 5, and the correspondence between Hu and Chen in Vol. 2, No. 2, already reveals the mystery. Hu Shih&#x27;s letter briefly mentions his proposed literary revolution, which &quot;must begin with eight things,&quot; which are, in order, not to use diction, not to use stereotyped phrases, not to speak of counterpoints, not to avoid vulgar words and phrases, and to emphasize the structure of grammar, not to make a sickly speech, and not to be excessively sentimental, not to use classical expressions, and to be meaningful&quot;. In addition to his slight doubts about the fifth and eighth items, Chen Duxiu said, &quot;The rest of the six things, they all join hands in admiration&quot;.

=== &quot;A Madman&#x27;s Diary&quot; ===
On May 15, 1918, Volume 4, Number 5, Lu Xun published his first vernacular fiction, A Madman&#x27;s Diary on New Youth. Lu Xun&#x27;s works in New Youth are mainly a critique of nationalism, a loving compassion for distorted life, and a sense of self-torture and self-sacrifice. In these levels of expression, an extremely vivid discourse of self-examination is formed. A Madman&#x27;s Diary aesthetically creates a rhetoric of freedom contrary to the eight-legged literary style, introducing elements of modernity into the expression of the mother tongue in strangeness and tearing. Rather than closing off the mother tongue, it reopens the door to it. Traditional meaningful forms wormed their way to life under its pen.

=== &quot;Plea to a crime&quot; (Chinese: 罪案之答辩书) ===
&quot;An Open Letter to the Youth&quot; is the inaugural work of &quot;Youth Magazine.&quot; In this article, Chen Duxiu expresses his earnest hopes for the youth, emphasizing their crucial role in the nation&#x27;s survival and urging them to be conscious and courageous in their endeavors. He advocates for the equal importance of science and human rights, marking the beginning of the New Culture Movement and sounding its clarion call. Chen Duxiu critiques Confucianism and other feudal theories and morals, promoting democracy and opposing feudal autocracy. He champions a scientific attitude, rejects superstition, and underscores the need to use scientific rationality to address social issues, arguing that superstition is a root cause of national decline. Chen Duxiu&#x27;s propositions aim to dismantle traditional beliefs, establish independent and autonomous character, and drive social progress.

In 1919, Vol. 6, No. 1, Chen Duxiu published &quot;Zui an zhi da bian shu&quot;, and the &quot;Da bian shu&quot;, which contained the following passage:

&quot;My fellow-citizens were originally innocent, but it was only because of their support for Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science that they committed these monstrous sins. To support Mr. De one has to oppose Confucianism, ritual, chastity, old ethics, and old politics; to support Mr. Sai, one has to oppose old art and old religion; to support Mr. Deand Mr. Sai, one has to oppose the national essence and old literature. If you think about it carefully and calmly, do you know if there are any other crimes in this magazine apart from supporting Mr. De and Mr. Sai? If not, please do not to make special difficulties for this magazine, but to have the strength and courage to oppose Mr. De and Mr. Sai is the only way to be considered a good man, the only way to be considered fundamental.&quot;

This passage has been quoted repeatedly by later historians. A closer look at Chen&#x27;s argument suggests that support for Mr. De and Mr. Sai was the basic position of the New Youth, and that opposition to old ethics, old politics, old art, old religion, old literature, and other specific ideas were all based on this principle. Since the late Qing Dynasty, the concepts of democracy (civil rights, constitutionalism, republicanism) and science have been repeatedly advocated by the people of China (with different emphasis in different periods), and have become mainstream discourse among intellectual circles in the May Fourth Period.

==Poetry, drama, and other fiction ==
Though perhaps most famous for publishing short fiction, &quot;La Jeunesse&quot; also published vernacular poetry and drama. Hu Shih&#x27;s &quot;Marriage&quot; (Chinese: 终身大事) was one of the first dramas written in the new literature style. Published in the March 1919 issue (Volume 6 Number 3), this one-act play highlights the problems of traditional marriages arranged by parents. The female protagonist eventually leaves her family to escape the marriage in the story. Poems published included those by Li Dazao (Chinese:李大钊), Chen Duxiu (Chinese: 陈独秀), Lu Xun (Chinese: 鲁迅), Zhou Zuoren (Chinese: 周作人), Yu Pingbo (Chinese: 俞平伯), Kang Baiqing (Chinese: 康白情), Shen Jianshi (Chinese: 沈兼士), Shen Xuanlu (Chinese: 沈玄庐), Wang Jingzhi (Chinese: 汪静之), Chen Hengzhe (Chinese: 陈衡哲), Chen Jianlei (Chinese: 陈建雷), among others.

== Ideological tendency ==
The New Youth fought against the feudalistic and revivalist literati and other feudalistic literary trends. This mainly included the struggle against the feudal revivalist forces of the &quot;Wenxuan School&quot; (Chinese: 文选派) and the &quot;Tongcheng School&quot; (Chinese: 桐城派) represented by Liu Shipei and Lin Qinnan, who opposed the vernacular language and defended the literary language, and opposed the new morality and defended the old morality. Chen Duxiu wrote &quot;Zui an zhi da bian shu&quot;, in which he frankly admitted that the world&#x27;s accusation that the New Youth had &quot;undermined propriety and religion,&quot; among other things, was true. He believed that only Mr. De (Democracy) and Mr. Sai (Science) could save China from all the darkness in politics, morality, academics and ideology. On behalf of the magazine, Chen Duxiu swore, &quot;If I support these two gentlemen, I will not shirk all government oppression, social attacks and ridicule, or even the breaking of my head and the shedding of blood&quot;.

The so-called New Youth &quot;at first advocated literary revolution, but later turned to communism&quot;, the ideological orientation of the New Youth magazine before 1918 was basically of the nature of the old democratic revolution. The victory of the October Revolution aroused a strong interest in Marxism among the Chinese advanced elements, and the intellectuals quickly accepted and studied Marxism, using the proletarian worldview as a tool for observing the destiny of the country.The publication of New Youth, Volume 5, No. 5, published on October 15, 1918, contained Li Dazhao&#x27;s &quot;Shu min de sheng li&quot;(Chinese: 庶民的胜利) and &quot;Triumph of Bolshevism&quot; (Chinese: Bolshevism的胜利), which produced a significant reaction among the advanced elements and progressive young students in China. The publication of Li Dazhao&#x27;s &quot;Shu min de sheng li&quot; and &quot;Triumph of Bolshevism&quot; in the fifth volume of New Youth, published on October 15, 1918, had a significant impact on the Chinese advanced elements and progressive young students, he was an early group of intellectuals who carried out the dissemination of Marxism. The social trends after the May Fourth Movement and the increasing radicalization of the academic world made it difficult for the leading newspaper New Youth to be confined to university campuses. Published on September 1, 1920, New Youth, Vol. 8, No. 1, was reorganized as the organ of the Shanghai Initiation Group of the CCP. The Nouvelle Jeunesse became an ideological position for the propagation of Marxism.

==Comments==
Hu Shih wrote a letter to a friend in 1923: &quot;In the past 25 years, there have only been three magazines that can represent three eras. It can be said that three new eras have been created: one is &quot;Current Affairs Daily&quot;, one is &quot;Xinmin Congbao&quot;, and one is &quot;New Youth&quot;.&quot; The new era created by &quot;New Youth&quot; refers to the era of democratic science.

In 1936, Mao Zedong recalled: &quot;I started reading this magazine (referring to &quot;New Youth&quot;) when I was studying in Normal University. I admired the articles of Hu Shih and Chen Duxiu very much. They replaced Liang Qichao and Kang Youwei who had been abandoned by me. It became my role model for a while.&quot; &quot;New Youth&quot; had a huge appeal to the young Mao Zedong, primarily due to the fact that it promoted and advocated democratic science.

Zheng Zhenduo recalled in &quot;Chinese New Literature Series·Literary Debate Collection·Introduction&quot; that it was a youth magazine that advocated &quot;moral, intellectual and physical&quot; education, and was indifferent from other ordinary magazines at that time. In fact, apart from asking young people to establish a correct outlook on life, there is not much practical content. It can be said that in the early days, &quot;New Youth&quot; was a truly ordinary magazine with a younger generation as its intended readers.

Bei jing Xin bao reported that: &quot;Recently, Peking University faculty members Chen Duxiu, Hu Shizhi, Liu Bannong and Qian Xuantong advocated a new Chinese literature, advocating a change to the vernacular style, and for China&#x27;s 2,000 years of obstacles to the cultural shackles of the most thought of Confucianism and Mencius, and the parallelism of the Pianwen prose style. For the doctrinal analysis.&quot;

In 1926, Ge Gongzhen wrote China&#x27;s first History of Chinese Newspapers. The timing of his book coincided with the final publication of New Youth. The book&#x27;s introduction to New Youth was very brief: &quot;At first it advocated literary revolution, but later it turned communist.&quot; After the May Fourth Movement, New Youth turned to socialism; in September 1920 it was reorganized as a branch of the Shanghai Communist Group. In 1923–1926, it became the theoretical journal of the CCP Central Committee. Ge Gongzhen saw the whole process of the development of New Youth.

Guo Zhanbo published A History of Chinese Thought in the Last Fifty Years (Chinese: 《近五十年中国思想史》), in which he claimed that &quot;from the New Youth, we can see the changes in his personal thought, and at the same time, we can see the changes in the world of thought at that time,&quot; formally confirming the self-expectation and self-positioning of the New Youth&#x27;s colleagues. From then on, commenting on New Youth from the perspective of the history of ideas became the mainstream discourse in the academic world while the literary revolution, which was the most popular concern and the one with the most actual achievements, gradually faded out of the historians&#x27; view.

<text>The Hocągara (Ho-Chungara) or Hocąks (Ho-Chunks) are a Siouan-speaking Native American Nation originally from Wisconsin and northern Illinois. Due to forced emigration in the 19th century, they now constitute two individual tribes; the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin and the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska. They are most closely related to the Chiwere peoples (the Ioway, Oto, and Missouria), and more distantly to the Dhegiha (Quapaw, Kansa, Omaha, Ponca, and Osage).

==Migration myth==
In the story that follows, the Bear Clan assumes the foundation role for the whole nation, and when they land they find the nation&#x27;s friendship tribe, the Menominee. The Bear Clan is strongly associated with the &quot;kaǧi&quot;, a term that denotes the raven and northern crow. It is also the name by which the Hocągara know the Menominee.

On account of his vision, a great Menominee (&quot;Kaǧi&quot;) chief commanded that all manner of supplies be assembled at a white sand beach on Lake Michigan. And when all this had been done and set in order, as the sun reached its zenith the vision came to life: in the pure blue sky of the eastern horizon a single dark cloud began to form and move irresistibly towards them. It was a great flock of ravens (&quot;kaǧi&quot;), spirit birds with rainbow plumage of iridescent colors. The instant that the first of these landed, he materialized into a naked, kneeling man. The Menominee chief said to his people, &quot;Give this man clothing, for he is a chief.&quot; And the others landed in like fashion, and were given great hospitality. They were the Hocąk nation, and that is how they came to Red Banks.

Red Banks (Wisconsin) is the traditional homeland of the Hocąk Nation. It is situated on Green Bay, which the Hocągara called &quot;Te-rok&quot;, the &quot;Within Lake&quot;. Lake Michigan as a whole was called &quot;Te-šišik&quot;, &quot;Bad Lake&quot;, which may well have led the Algonquian peoples round about Lake Winnebago to call them &quot;the people of the Bad Waters&quot;, or &quot;Winnibégo&quot; in Menominee.

== Trickster tales ==
Trickster tales played a major role in the Winnebago tribe. These stories were passed down orally and depicted humorous lessons through animals, nature and trickery. For example, &quot;The Trickster and Talking Bulb&quot; tells the story of &quot;The Old Man&quot;, who disregards the warnings of a bulb and, in turn, gets punished for his defiance. The trickster later learns to respect nature and not go against it.

==Red Horn==
Red Horn (also known as &#x27;He Who Wears (Human) Faces on His Ears&#x27;) is found in the oral traditions of the Ioway, and Hocągara (Winnebago) (whose ethnology was recorded by anthropologist Paul Radin, 1908–1912). The Red Horn Cycle depicts his adventures with Turtle, the thunderbird Storms-as-He-Walks (&quot;Mą’e-manįga&quot;) and others who contest a race of giants, the &quot;Wąge-rucge&quot; or &quot;Man-Eaters&quot;, who have been killing human beings whom Red Horn has pledged to help. Red Horn eventually took a red haired giant woman as a wife. Archaeologists have speculated that Red Horn is a mythic figure in Mississippian art, represented on a number of Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC) artifacts. Hall has shown that the mythic cycle of Red Horn and his sons has some interesting analogies with the Hero Twins mythic cycle of Mesoamerica.

<text>The Adlet (or Erqigdlet) are a race of creatures in the Inuit mythology of Greenland, as well as the Labrador and Hudson Bay coasts. While the word refers to inland native American tribes, it also denotes a humanoid dog-legged tribe. The lower part of the body of the canine Adlet is like that of a dog and their upper part is like a man&#x27;s. All Adlet run quickly, and their encounters with men usually end with man as the victor.

In Inuit lore, they are often portrayed as in conflict with humans, and are supposed to be taller than Inuit and white people. In some stories they are cannibals. Inuit from Labrador use the term Adlet, tribes west of the Hudson Bay use the word Erqigdlit. The monstrous race begotten by the Adlet was identified with inland Native Americans by the Labrador and Hudson Bay tribes; Inuit from Greenland and Baffin Land, which had no native American neighbors, use the term to refer to the half human, half canine creatures.

An etymology of the word is proposed by H. Newell Wardle: &quot;adlet&quot; might come from &quot;ad&quot;, &quot;below,&quot; and thus denote &quot;those below.&quot; Alternatively, he argues, it might come from the stem &quot;agdlak&quot;, &quot;striped, streaked,&quot; thus &quot;the striped ones,&quot; in reference to American Indians who lived to the west and painted their faces. &quot;Erqigdlet&quot; might be a derogatory term denoting the same people. &quot;Atlat&quot; means &quot;others,&quot; denoting American Indians from the Inuit perspective, though Newell Wardle considers this possibility secondary and deriving from phonetic similarity.

==Origin==
Franz Boas, an ethnologist who recorded many Inuit stories, gives an account of the origin of the Adlet; he had heard the story in Baffin Land, specifically in Cumberland Sound from an Inuit named Pakaq. His transcription, a translation by H. Rink, and an explanation (by Boas) were published in &quot;The Journal of American Folklore&quot; in 1889. The Inuit of Greenland, according to Rink, tell the same story as those in Baffin Land. The story is often referred to as &quot;The Girl and the Dogs&quot; on the west coast of Greenland; on the east coast of Greenland it is known as &quot;The Origin of the Qavdlunait and Irqigdlit&quot; (that is, Scandinavians or Nordic people and Indians).

A woman, Niviarsiang (&quot;the girl&quot;), lives with her father, Savirqong, but will not marry, and hence is also called Uinigumissuitung (&quot;she who wouldn&#x27;t take a husband&quot;). After rejecting all her suitors, she marries a dog, Ijirqang, with white and red spots. Of their ten children, five are dogs and the others are Adlet, with dog&#x27;s bodies for their lower half and man&#x27;s bodies for their upper half. Since Ijirqang does not go hunting and the children are very hungry, it falls to Savirqong to provide for the noisy household. At last he puts them into a boat and carries them off to a small island, telling Ijirqang to come and get meat daily. Niviarsiang hangs a pair of boots around his neck and he swims ashore, but Savirqong, instead of giving him meat, puts stones in the boots and Ijirqang drowns. In revenge, Niviarsiang sends the young dogs over to gnaw off her father&#x27;s feet and hands. He, in return kicks her overboard when she happens to be in his boat, and when she hangs on the gunwale he cuts off her fingers, which, when they fall in the ocean, turn into whales and seals.

Since Niviarsiang is scared her father might kill the Adlet, she sends them inland, and from them a numerous people springs. The young dogs she sends across the ocean in a makeshift boat, and arriving beyond the sea they became the Scandinavian ancestors.

==Anthropological interpretation==
One interpretation of the phenomenon of the Adlet (and the theme of the &quot;Dog Husband&quot;) sees the difference between the dog-like children and the other, the Adlet, as crucial. The dogs are sent overseas and will return as white Scandinavians to bring things favorable to the Inuit, whereas the Adlet, &quot;swift runners of an aggressive disposition,&quot; become a kind of inland spirit, to be kept at bay. Thus, the &quot;Dog Husband&quot; myth carries the value of a cargo cult: &quot;by offering their [sexual] favors to the dog-like Whites aka Nords, the Inuit daughters serve as mediators in obtaining their desirable goods.&quot; A reading of the account as a &quot;Whaler myth,&quot; in a culture in which the Inuit were economically dependent on the mechanically superior products supplied by the Scandinavian whalers, the story transforms material dependence on the white whaler into a reciprocal relationship, whereby the Scandinavian Nord comes back to repay his mother.

Franz Boas and Hinrich Rink offer two options for the occurrence of a legend explaining the origin of whites aka Nordic people. Either the tradition dates back to when the Inuit first made contact with Scandinavians (which they consider highly unlikely), or, more likely, it is the adaptation of an already existing tradition, modified to account for the coming of the Scandinavians aka Nords. Signe Rink proposes a similar explanation in a hypothetical historical narrative that also takes linguistic evidence into account.

The &quot;Dog Husband&quot; theme is paralleled in other tribal mythologies. The Dakelh (formerly known as the &quot;Carrier tribe&quot;), the indigenous people of the inland of British Columbia, tell a number of similar stories. In one of those stories, a woman suspects she is being violated nightly, and throws a little bag of vermilion paint on the violator; the next day, she identifies him as a big dog, and later gives birth to four dogs. Father Morice, writing about this and other stories he had been told by the Carrier people, posits that there might be &quot;a sort of national tradition among the hyperborean races of America, since even the Eskimo have a story which is evidently the equivalent of it,&quot; proceeding to summarize the account as given by Franz Boas in &quot;The Central Eskimo&quot; (1888). Similar stories (both about the Adlet and the woman who marries a dog) are told on the Siberian side of the Bering Strait, among the Chukchi.

==Adlet stories==
A number of stories containing Adlet were written down by ethnographers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

===&quot;The Tornit and the Adlit&quot;===
Many tales were told by the &quot;Smith Sound Eskimo,&quot; an Inuit from Smith Sound who was in New York City in the winter of 1897–1898, and published by A.L. Kroeber for the &quot;Journal of American Folklore&quot;. Two Tornits (another fabulous race from Inuit lore) find themselves among savage and cannibalistic Adlet. They sneak out at night and as they are leaving they cut the thongs on the Adlet&#x27;s sledges that fasten the crossbars to the runners. The dogs start barking, but as the Adlet mount their sledges the runners fall off and the Tornit get away. The same Smith Sound Eskimo also told a variant of the Adlet story related by Boas in &quot;The Central Eskimo.&quot; In this version, the Tornit are the woman&#x27;s offspring as well, but Kroeber remarks that they are &quot;ordinarily not connected with this tale.&quot; Other stories told by the Smith Sound Eskimo, such as &quot;The Origin of the Narwhal,&quot; also contain murderous Adlet.

===Aselu===
In Inuit folklore from Point Barrow, Alaska, there exists a tale of a dog named Aselu who plays a central role in an unusual origin story. Aselu is bound to a stick but manages to free himself by gnawing through it. After gaining his freedom, he enters a dwelling where he has intercourse with a woman. This union results in offspring who are both human and canine in nature, underscoring themes of interconnection between humans and animals in Inuit belief. This story, while not explicitly involving the Adlet, shares a similar theme of hybrid beings, with humans and dogs sharing bloodlines, hinting at an ancestral bond that may also extend to the Adlet&#x27;s mythical origins.

=== The Origin of the Narwhal&quot; ===
Another tale featuring the Adlet is &quot;The Origin of the Narwhal,&quot; also told by the same Smith Sound Inuit. This story, while primarily concerned with explaining the existence of the narwhal, includes a reference to the Adlet as merciless hunters or murderers. The presence of the Adlet in stories that revolve around creation or origin myths reflects the danger and struggle inherent in Inuit life, where survival is constantly threatened by the unknown and the untamable forces of nature.

<doc id="92881" wikidata="Q108356" url="?curid=92881" title="Sabines">
<text>The Sabines (, , , ;  ) were an Italic people who lived in the central Apennine Mountains (see Sabina) of the ancient Italian Peninsula, also inhabiting Latium north of the Anio before the founding of Rome.

The Sabines divided into two populations just after the founding of Rome, which is described by Roman legend. The division, however it came about, is not legendary. The population closer to Rome transplanted itself to the new city and united with the preexisting citizenry, beginning a new heritage that descended from the Sabines but was also Latinized. The second population remained a mountain tribal state, coming finally to war against Rome for its independence along with all the other Italic tribes. Afterwards, it became assimilated into the Roman Republic.

==Etymology==
The Sabines derived directly from the ancient Umbrians and belonged to the same ethnic group as the Samnites and the Sabelli, as attested by the common ethnonyms of &quot;Safineis&quot; (in ancient Greek ) and by the toponyms &quot;safinim&quot; and &quot;safina&quot; (at the origin of the terms &quot;Samnium&quot; and &quot;Sabinum&quot;). The Indo-European root &quot;&quot; or evolved into the word , which later became &quot;Safin&quot;. From &quot;Safinim&quot;, &quot;Sabinus&quot;, &quot;Sabellus&quot; and &quot;Samnis&quot;, an Indo-European root can be extracted, , which becomes in Latino-Faliscan and in Osco-Umbrian: and .

At some point in prehistory, a population speaking a common language extended over both Samnium and Umbria. Salmon conjectures that it was common Italic and puts forward a date of 600 BC, after which the common language began to separate into dialects. This date does not necessarily correspond to any historical or archaeological evidence; developing a synthetic view of the ethnology of proto-historic Italy is an incomplete and ongoing task.

Linguist Julius Pokorny carries the etymology somewhat further back. Conjecturing that the -a- was altered from an -o- during some prehistoric residence in Illyria, he derives the names from an o-grade extension *&quot;swo-bho-&quot; of an extended e-grade *&quot;swe-bho-&quot; of the possessive adjective, *&quot;s(e)we-&quot;, of the reflexive pronoun, *&quot;se-&quot;, &quot;oneself&quot; (the source of English &quot;self&quot;). The result is a set of Indo-European tribal names (if not the endonym of the Indo-Europeans): Germanic Suebi and Semnones, Suiones; Celtic Senones; Slavic Serbs and Sorbs; Italic Sabelli, Sabini, etc., as well as a large number of kinship terms.

==Language==
There is little record of the Sabine language; however, there are some glosses by ancient commentators, and one or two inscriptions have been tentatively identified as Sabine. There are also personal names in use on Latin inscriptions from the Sabine country, but these are given in Latin form. Robert Seymour Conway, in his &quot;Italic Dialects&quot;, gives approximately 100 words which vary from being well-attested as Sabine to being possibly of Sabine origin. In addition to these he cites place names derived from the Sabine, sometimes giving attempts at reconstructions of the Sabine form. Based on all the evidence, the Linguist List tentatively classifies Sabine as a member of the Umbrian group of Italic languages of the Indo-European family, while Glottolog classifies it as an Old Sabellic dialect alongside South Picene and Pre-Samnite.

==Historical geography==
Latin-speakers called the Sabines&#x27; original territory, straddling the modern regions of Lazio, Umbria, and Abruzzo, &quot;Sabinum&quot;. , it bears the ancient tribe&#x27;s name in the Italian form of &quot;Sabina&quot;. Within the modern region of Lazio (or Latium), Sabina constitutes a sub-region, situated north-east of Rome, around Rieti.

==History==
===Origin and early history===
The Sabines settled in Sabinum, around the tenth century BC, founding the cities of Reate, Trebula Mutuesca and Cures Sabini. Dionysius of Halicarnassus mentions the Sabines in relation to the Aborigines, from whom they allegedly stole their capital Lista, with a surprise war action starting from Amiternum. Ancient historians debated the specific origins of the Sabines. According to Strabo the Sabines, after a long war with the Umbrians, migrated to the land of the Opici, following the ancient Italic rite of the Ver Sacrum. The Sabines then drove out the Opici and encamped in that region. Zenodotus of Troezen claimed that the Sabines were originally Umbrians that changed their name after being driven from the Reatine territory by the Pelasgians. Porcius Cato argued that the Sabines were a populace named after Sabus, the son of Sancus (a divinity of the area sometimes called Jupiter Fidius). In another account mentioned in Dionysius&#x27;s work, a group of Lacedaemonians fled Sparta since they regarded the laws of Lycurgus as too severe. In Italy, they founded the Spartan colony of &quot;Foronia&quot; (near the Pomentine plains) and some from that colony settled among the Sabines. According to the account, the Sabine habits of belligerence and frugality were known to have derived from the Spartans. Plutarch also mentions, in the Life of Numa Pompilius, &quot;Sabines, who declare themselves to be a colony of the Lacedaemonians&quot;. Plutarch also wrote that the Pythagoras of Sparta, who was Olympic victor in the foot-race, helped Numa arrange the government of the city and many Spartan customs introduced by him to the Numa and the people.

==At Rome==

===Legend of the Sabine women===

Legend says that the Romans abducted Sabine women to populate the newly built Rome. The resultant war ended only by the women throwing themselves and their children between the armies of their fathers and their husbands. The Rape of the Sabine Women became a common motif in art; the women ending the war is a less frequent but still reappearing motif.

According to Livy, after the conflict, the Sabine and Roman states merged, and the Sabine king Titus Tatius jointly ruled Rome with Romulus until Tatius&#x27; death five years later. Three new centuries of Equites were introduced at Rome, including one named Tatienses, after the Sabine king.

A variation of the story is recounted in the pseudepigraphal &quot;Sefer haYashar&quot; (see ).

===Traditions===
Tradition suggests that the population of the early Roman kingdom was the result of a union of Sabines and others. Some of the gentes of the Roman republic were proud of their Sabine heritage, such as the Claudia gens, assuming Sabinus as a cognomen or agnomen. Some specifically Sabine deities and cults were known at Rome: Semo Sancus and Quirinus, and at least one area of the town, the Quirinale, where the temples to those latter deities were located, had once been a Sabine centre. The extravagant claims of Varro and Cicero that augury, divination by dreams and the worship of Minerva and Mars originated with the Sabines are disputable, as they were general Italic and Latin customs, as well as Etruscan, even though they were espoused by Numa Pompilius, second king of Rome and a Sabine.

Many of these deities were shared with the Etruscan religion, and were also adopted into the derivative Samnite and ancient Roman religion.
Roman author Varro, who was himself of Sabine origin, gives a list of Sabine gods who were adopted by the Romans.
Elsewhere, Varro claims Sol Indiges – who had a sacred grove at Lavinium – as Sabine but at the same time equates him with Apollo. Of those listed, he writes, &quot;several names have their roots in both languages, as trees that grow on a property line creep into both fields. Saturn, for instance, can be said to have another origin here, and so too Diana.&quot;

Varro makes various claims for Sabine origins throughout his works, some more plausible than others, and his list should not be taken at face value. But the importance of the Sabines in the early cultural formation of Rome is evidenced, for instance, by the bride abduction of the Sabine women by Romulus&#x27;s men, and in the Sabine ethnicity of Numa Pompilius, second king of Rome, to whom are attributed many of Rome&#x27;s religious and legal institutions. Varro, however, says that the altars to most of these gods were established at Rome by King Tatius as the result of a vow (&quot;votum&quot;).

==State==
During the expansion of ancient Rome, there were a series of conflicts with the Sabines. Manius Curius Dentatus conquered the Sabines in 290 BC. The citizenship without the right of suffrage was given to the Sabines in the same year. The right of suffrage was granted to the Sabines in 268 BC.

<text>Tivoli ( ; ; ) is a town and in Lazio, central Italy, north-east of Rome, at the falls of the Aniene river where it issues from the Sabine Hills. The city offers a wide view over the Roman Campagna.

==History==
Gaius Julius Solinus cites Cato the Elder&#x27;s lost &quot;Origines&quot; for the story that the city of Tibur was founded by Catillus the Arcadian, a son of Amphiaraus, who came there having escaped the slaughter at Thebes, Greece. Catillus and his three sons Tiburtus, Coras, and Catillus drove out the Siculi from the Aniene plateau and founded a city they named Tibur in honor of Tiburtus. According to another account, Tibur was a colony of Alba Longa. Historical traces of settlement in the area date back to the thirteenth century BC. &quot;Tibur&quot; may share a common root with the river Tiber and the Latin praenomen &quot;Tiberius&quot;.

From Etruscan times Tibur, a Sabine city, was the seat of the Tiburtine Sibyl. There are two small temples above the falls, the rotunda traditionally associated with Vesta and the rectangular one with the Sibyl of Tibur, whom Varro calls &quot;Albunea&quot;, the water nymph who was worshipped on the banks of the Aniene as a tenth Sibyl added to the nine mentioned by the Greek writers. In the nearby woods, Faunus had a sacred grove. During the Roman age Tibur maintained a certain importance, being on the way (the Via Tiburtina, extended as the Via Valeria) that Romans had to follow to cross the mountain regions of the Apennines towards the Abruzzo, the region where lived some of its fiercest enemies such as Volsci, Sabines, and Samnites.

===Roman age===

At first an independent ally of Rome, Tibur allied itself with the Gauls in 361 BC. Vestiges remain of its defensive walls of this period, in &quot;opus quadratum&quot;. In 338 BC, however, Tibur was defeated and absorbed by the Romans. The city acquired Roman citizenship in 90 BC and became a resort area famed for its beauty and its good water, and was enriched by many Roman villas. The most famous one, of which the ruins remain, is the &quot;Villa Adriana&quot; (Hadrian&#x27;s Villa). Maecenas and Augustus also had villas at Tibur, and the poet Horace had a modest villa: he and Catullus and Statius all mention Tibur in their poems. In 273, Zenobia, the captive queen of Palmyra, was assigned a residence here by the Emperor Aurelian. The second-century temple of Hercules Victor is being excavated. The present Piazza del Duomo occupies the Roman forum.

In 547, in the course of the Gothic War, the city was fortified by the Byzantine general Belisarius, but was later destroyed by Totila&#x27;s army. After the end of the war it became a Byzantine duchy, later absorbed into the Patrimony of St. Peter. After Italy was conquered by Charlemagne, Tivoli was under the authority of a count, representing the emperor.

====Roman gentes with origins in Tibur====

* Coponia (gens)
* Cossinia (gens)
* Rabiria gens
* Rubellia gens

===Middle Ages===
From the tenth century onwards, Tivoli, as an independent commune governed by its elected consuls, was the fiercest rival of Rome in the struggle for the control over the impoverished central Lazio. Emperor Otto III conquered it in 1001, and Tivoli fell under the papal control. Tivoli however managed to keep a level of independence until the 15th century: symbols of the city&#x27;s strength were the Palace of Arengo, the &quot;Torre del Comune&quot; and the church of St. Michael, all built in this period, as well as the new line of walls (authorized in 1155), needed to house the increasing population. Reminders of the internal turbulence of communal life are the tower houses that may be seen in Vicolo dei Ferri, Via di Postera, Via del Seminario and Via del Colle.

In the 13th century Rome imposed a tribute on the city, and gave itself the right to appoint a count to govern it in conjunction with the local consuls. In the fourteenth century, Tivoli sided with the Guelphs and strongly supported Urban VI against Antipope Clement VII. King Ladislaus of Naples was twice repulsed from the city, as was the condottiero Braccio da Montone.

In the city there was also a Jewish community.

=== Renaissance ===
During the Renaissance, popes and cardinals did not limit their embellishment program to Rome; they also erected buildings in Tivoli. In 1461 Pope Pius II built the massive Rocca Pia to control the always restive population, and as a symbol of the permanence of papal temporal power here.

From the sixteenth century the city saw further construction of villas. The most famous of these is the Villa d&#x27;Este, a World Heritage Site, whose construction was started in 1550 by Pirro Ligorio for Cardinal Ippolito II d&#x27;Este and which was richly decorated with an ambitious program of frescoes by painters of late Roman Mannerism, such Girolamo Muziano, Livio Agresti (a member of the &quot;Forlì painting school&quot;) or Federico Zuccari. In 1527 Tivoli was sacked by bands of the supporters of the emperor and the Colonna, important archives being destroyed during the attack. In 1547 it was again occupied, by the Duke of Alba in a war against Paul IV, and in 1744 by the Austrians.

In 1835 Pope Gregory XVI added the Villa Gregoriana, a villa complex pivoting around the Aniene&#x27;s falls. The &quot;Great Waterfall&quot; was created through a tunnel in the Monte Catillo, to give an outlet to the waters of the Aniene sufficient to preserve the city from inundations like the devastating flood of 1826.

===Modern times===
In 1944, Tivoli suffered heavy damage under an Allied bombing, which destroyed the Jesuit Church of Jesus.

==Main sights==


===Archaeological sites===

* Sanctuary of Hercules Victor (second century BC) was one of the largest structures in central Italy at the time, and was located outside the ancient city, across the road leading to Rome and Samnium. Measuring , it included a theatre, a large porticoed square and the temple. It was reached through a series of terraces, in a similar fashion to the Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia in Palestrina. The sanctuary also housed one of the more frequented council of musicians in Roman Italy;
* Roman amphitheatre of Blaesus of first half of the second century AD, coincided with the construction of Hadrian&#x27;s monumental villa not far away. It held about 6,000 spectators. An inscription (CIL XIV, 4259) gives the benefactor, M. Tullius Blaesus;
* Cryptoporticus (below Piazza Tani);
* Mensa Ponderaria and Sacello di Augusto;
* Roman age bridge (Viale Roma);
* Ponte Lucano and Plauzi Mausoleum;
* Porta Maior (Via del Colle);
* San Pietro alla Carità Romanesque architecture Catholic Church of Tivoli, Lazio;
* Circular Temple of Vesta on the acropolis, (probably of the Sibyl);
* Rectangular Temple of &quot;Tiburtine Sibyl&quot; (probably of Tiburno). It was built in the second century BC on an artificial platform in the acropolis. Characterized by Ionic columns (only two of which remain today), it measures . The interior was decorated by frescoes and stuccoes, now lost;
* Tomb of the Vestal Virgin Cossinia;
* Hadrian&#x27;s Villa, Unesco World Heritage;
* Villa of the Pisoni;
* Villa known as of Brutus; 1km south of Tivoli centre on the road to San Gregorio are the remains of this large terraced late Republican villa supported by double cryptoportici around a central area of several spacious rooms. Many fountains were used in the design;
* Villa known as of Cassius;
* Villa of Manlius Vopiscus (Villa Gregoriana);
* Villa of Quintilius Varus;
* Roman so-called Temple della Tosse, located on the ancient via Tiburtina near the Temple of Hercules and the Villa d&#x27;Este. It is a circular structure with a hole in the diameter dome. From the discovery of a plaque it seems that the building was built in the first half of the fourth century during the reign of Constantine I, on the ruins of a Roman villa of the first century BC, to commemorate the works carried out on the Via Tiburtina. Several hypotheses have been advanced, including that it was a nymphaeum, a temple dedicated to Venus or the Sun or a tomb of the gens Tuscia, from which the current name would later derive. The dome is similar to that of the Pantheon (i.e. with an oculus). The central brick body is divided into two levels, one older on which the entrances were located, the other above on which there are three large rectangular niches and four semicircular niches. In ancient times it was covered with marble, as evidenced by the fixing holes. It rests on a base of &quot;opus reticulatum&quot; of the villa from the 1st century BC and of reused material from ancient buildings;
* Roman basilica of the forum in the cathedral.

===Other sites===

* Villa d&#x27;Este, part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site list since 2001;
* Villa Gregoriana;
* &quot;Rocca Pia&quot;, a fortress built by Pope Pius II in 1461 to counter the urban strife between the Colonna and Orsini families;
* Tivoli Cathedral (Duomo, rebuilt from 1635 to 1641).

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Tivoli&#x27;s quarries produce travertine, a particular white calcium-carbonate rock used in building most Roman monuments. The water power of the falls supplies some of the electricity that lights Rome. The slopes of the neighbouring hills are covered with olives, vineyards and gardens; the most important local industry is the manufacture of paper.

==Influences==
Tivoli&#x27;s reputation as a stylish resort and the fame of the gardens of the Villa d&#x27;Este have inspired the naming of other sites after Tivoli: for example, the Jardin de Tivoli, Paris (France) and the Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen (Denmark). The Wörlitz Synagogue in the Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm (Germany) is a replica of the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli.

== Notable people ==
*Antinous (born 111), Lover of Hadrian
*Emilio Segrè (born 1905), Italian-American physicist and Nobel laureate
*Hadrian (born 76), Roman Emperor
*Luigi Stillo (born 1984), professional footballer
*Little Tony (born 1941), Italian singer
*Nicola Zalewski (born 2002), Polish footballer

== Climate ==
Tivoli has a Mediterranean climate with warm and dry summers and cool and wet winters.

<doc id="92886" wikidata="Q182609" url="?curid=92886" title="Jacques Rogge">
<text>Jacques Jean Marie, Count Rogge (, ; 2 May 1942 – 29 August 2021) was a Belgian sports administrator and physician, who served as the eighth president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) from 2001 to 2013. In 2013, Rogge became the IOC&#x27;s honorary president, a lifetime position, which he held until his death from Parkinson&#x27;s disease in August 2021.

==Early life and education==
Rogge was born on 2 May 1942 in Ghent, Belgium amid the Nazi German occupation during World War II. He is the son of Suzanne and Charles Rogge, an engineer. Rogge was by profession an orthopedic surgeon and was educated at the Jesuit private school Sint-Barbaracollege and the University of Ghent.
==Career==
Rogge was a noted athlete in his home country. He was a 16-time Belgian national champion in rugby and a one-time yachting world champion. He also competed in the Finn class of sailing on three Summer Olympic Games; in 1968, 1972, and 1976.

Rogge served as president of the Belgian Olympic Committee from 1989 to 1992, and as president of the European Olympic Committees from 1989 to 2001. He became a member of the IOC in 1991 and joined its executive board in 1998. He was knighted in 1992, and in 2002 made a count in the Belgian nobility by King Albert II. When Rogge stepped down as President of the IOC he was awarded by his successor a gold Olympic Order. 

===President of the IOC (2001–2013)===
Rogge was elected as President of the IOC on 16 July 2001 at the 112th IOC Session in Moscow as the to Juan Antonio Samaranch, who had previously led the IOC since 1980.

At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Rogge became the first ever IOC President to stay in the Olympic village, thereby enjoying closer contact with the athletes.

In October 2009, Rogge was re-elected for a new term as President of the IOC.

In 2011, a &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine list of the 68 most powerful people in the world listed Rogge at no. 67.

On 27 July 2011, one year prior to London 2012, Rogge attended a ceremony at Trafalgar Square where he invited athletes worldwide to compete in the forthcoming Olympic Games. Former Olympians the Princess Royal and Sebastian Coe unveiled the medals up for grabs, after both Prime Minister David Cameron and London Mayor Boris Johnson had given speeches.

In December 2011, Rogge was invested as an Officer of the by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.

On 10 September 2013, Rogge came to an end of his IOC presidency at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina after the session awarded the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics (Later postponed to 2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic in Japan). German lawyer, former foil fencer, and Olympic gold medalist Thomas Bach was elected as the new IOC President at the session. Rogge was then made Lifetime Honorary President of the IOC, a position which he held until his death in 2021.

====Controversies====
;PRC internet censorship
For the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, People&#x27;s Republic of China, Rogge pronounced in mid-July 2008 that there would be no Internet censorship by PRC government authorities: &quot;for the first time, foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in China&quot;. However, by 30 July 2008, IOC spokesman Kevan Gosper had to retract this optimistic statement, admitting that the Internet would indeed be censored for journalists. Gosper, who said he had not heard about this, suggested that high IOC officials (probably including the Dutch Hein Verbruggen and IOC Director of the Olympic Games, Gilbert Felli, and most likely with Rogge&#x27;s knowledge) had made a secret deal with PRC officials to allow the censorship, without the knowledge of either the press or most members of the IOC. Rogge later denied that any such meeting had taken place, but failed to insist that the PRC adhere to its prior assurances that the Internet would not be censored.

The play &quot;Dear Mr. Rogge&quot;, written by Dinah Lee Küng in 2012, depicts an imprisoned PRC dissident who wrote a letter challenging Rogge to walk from the Birds Nest stadium to Beijing Prison No. 2 in order to check the truth of Rogge&#x27;s claim that hosting the Olympics would serve as a catalyst only for good in the country.

;Criticism of Bolt&#x27;s jubilation
Rogge commented that Usain Bolt&#x27;s gestures of jubilation and excitement after winning the 100 meters in Beijing are &quot;not the way we perceive being a champion,&quot; and also said &quot;that he should show more respect for his competitors.&quot; In response to his comments, Yahoo! Sports columnist, Dan Wetzel, who covered the Games, described him as &quot;a classic stiff-collared bureaucrat,&quot; and further contended that &quot;[the IOC] has made billions off athletes such as Bolt for years, yet he has to find someone to pick on&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Irish Times&quot;&#x27; reporter Ian O&#x27;Riordan, Rogge clarified, &quot;Maybe there was a little bit of a misunderstanding... What he does before or after the race I have no problem with. I just thought that his gesticulation during the race was maybe a little disrespectful&quot;.

;Munich Massacre moment of silence
Rogge rejected calls for a minute of silence to be held to honor the 11 Israeli Olympians killed 40 years prior in the Munich massacre, during the opening ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics. He did this despite the standing request of the families of the 11 Israeli Olympic team members and political pressure from the United States, Britain, and Germany, stating: &quot;We feel that the opening ceremony is an atmosphere that is not fit to remember such a tragic incident.&quot; Speaking of the decision, Israeli Olympian Shaul Ladany, who had survived the Munich massacre, commented: &quot;I do not understand. I do not understand, and I do not accept it.&quot; Rogge and the IOC instead opted for a ceremony at Guildhall, London, on 6 August, and one at Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base on the anniversary of the attack, 5 September.

==Later life==
On 25 February 2014, the Princess Royal presented him with his appointment as an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) at Buckingham Palace in London for his years of service to the Olympics and in particular for his work on 2012 London Summer Olympic Games.

<doc id="92888" wikidata="Q1012797" url="?curid=92888" title="Ostia Antica">
<text>Ostia Antica () is an ancient Roman city and the port of Rome located at the mouth of the Tiber. It is near modern Ostia, southwest of Rome. Due to silting and the invasion of sand, the site now lies from the sea. The name &quot;Ostia&quot; (the plural of &quot;ostium&quot;) derives from Latin &quot;os&quot; &#x27;mouth&#x27;.

Ostia is now a large archaeological site noted for the excellent preservation of its ancient buildings, magnificent frescoes and impressive mosaics. The city&#x27;s decline after antiquity led to harbor deterioration, marshy conditions, and reduced population. Sand dunes covering the site aided its preservation. Its remains provide insights into a city of commercial importance. As in Pompeii, Ostia&#x27;s ruins provide details about Roman urbanism that are not accessible within the city of Rome itself.

==History==

===Origins===
Ostia may have been Rome&#x27;s first &quot;colonia&quot;. According to legend, Ancus Marcius, the fourth king of Rome, was the first to destroy Ficana, an ancient town that was only from Rome and had a small harbour on the Tiber, and then proceeded with establishing the new colony further west and closer to the sea coast. An inscription seems to confirm the establishment of the old &quot;castrum&quot; of Ostia in the 7th century BC. The oldest archaeological remains so far discovered date back to only the 4th century BC. The most ancient buildings currently visible are from the 3rd century BC, notably the &quot;Castrum&quot; (military camp); of a slightly later date is the &quot;Capitolium&quot; (temple of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva). The &quot;opus quadratum&quot; of the walls of the original &quot;castrum&quot; at Ostia provide important evidence for the building techniques that were employed in Roman urbanisation during the period of the Middle Republic.

Ostia probably developed originally as a naval base, and in 267 BC, during the first Punic war, it was the seat of the &quot;quaestor Ostiensis&quot; in charge of the fleet. During the 2nd century BC its role as a commercial port gradually became prevalent for the imports of grain for the city of Rome, and buildings began to spread outside the castrum.

===Civil wars===

Ostia was a scene of fighting during the period of civil wars in the 80s BC. In 87 BC Marius attacked the city in order to cut off the flow of trade to Rome, aided by his generals Cinna, Carbo and Sertorius, and captured the city and plundered it.

===Sacking by pirates===

In 68 BC, the town was sacked by pirates, who set the port on fire, destroyed the consular war fleet, and kidnapped two prominent senators. This attack caused such panic in Rome that Pompey the Great arranged for the tribune Aulus Gabinius to pass a law, the &quot;lex Gabinia&quot;, to allow Pompey to raise an army and destroy the pirates. Within a year, the pirates had been defeated.

The town was then re-built and provided with defensive walls started under Marcus Tullius Cicero according to an inscription.

===Imperial Ostia===

Ostia was further developed during the first century AD under the influence of Tiberius, who ordered the building of the town&#x27;s first forum.

Due to the small size of the harbour at Ostia, Claudius commissioned a new harbour at Portus on the northern mouths of the Tiber (&quot;Fiumara Grande&quot;). Insufficiently protected from storms, Claudius&#x27; project was later supplemented by the hexagonal harbour built by Trajan and finished in 113 AD. Trajan also developed the harbour of Civitavecchia (&quot;Centum Cellae&quot;), a relatively short distance away. These ports took business away from Ostia and began its commercial decline.

Nevertheless, Ostia grew to a peak of some 100,000 inhabitants in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.

Ostia itself was provided with all the services a town of the time could require; a large theatre, many public baths (such as the Thermae Gavii Maximi, or Baths at Ostia), numerous taverns and inns and a firefighting service. The popularity of the cult of Mithras is evident in the discovery of eighteen Mithraea. Ostia also contained the Ostia Synagogue, the earliest synagogue yet identified in Europe.

===Late-Roman and sub-Roman Ostia===
Although it used to be thought that the city entered a period of slow decline after Constantine the Great made Portus a municipality, indicated by some apartment blocks being replaced by houses of the rich, recent excavations show that the town continued to thrive. Numerous baths are recorded as still operating in the 4th and 5th centuries with major repairs of the city&#x27;s Neptune Baths in the 370s. During the 4th century, the city spilled over the southern walls to the sea south of Regions III and IV.

The poet Rutilius Namatianus reported the lack of maintenance of the city ports in 414 AD. This view has been challenged by Boin who states Namatianus&#x27; verse is a literary construct and inconsistent with the archaeological record.

Prosperity in the 5th century is indicated by repairs on baths (26 remained in operation during the 4th century), public buildings, church construction, street repaving, residential and business expansion beyond the perimeter of the south wall (the presence of a small harbour, the Porta Marina on the sea, is attested). A huge 4th century villa east of the Maritime baths was built. The river port on the western edge of the town was expanded with the &quot;navalia&quot;, a squarish basin built in from the river. A warehouse on the east side and, behind it, a large bath complex were built.

It became an episcopal see as part of the Diocese of Rome as early as the 3rd century AD. The episcopal church sponsored by Constantine the Great is located in the south-east of the city. The city was mentioned by St Augustine when he passed there in the late 4th century. On their way back to Africa after Augustine&#x27;s conversion to Christianity, Augustine&#x27;s mother, Saint Monica, died in 387 in Ostia. The church (&quot;titulus&quot;) of Santa Aurea in Ostia was built on her burial site.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, Ostia fell slowly into decay as the population of Rome, 700–800,000 in AD 400 contracted to 200,000 or less in 500 AD. A naval battle, the Battle of Ostia, was fought there in 849 between Christians and Saracens; the remaining inhabitants moved to Gregoriopolis a short distance away.

==Surroundings==
South of Ostia many rich villa-estates were developed from the Republican era along the coast road to Laurentum. Pliny described the route towards his villa there: “There are two different roads to it: if you go by that of Laurentum, you must turn off at the fourteenth mile-stone; if by that of Ostia, at the eleventh. Both of them are sandy in places, which makes it a little heavier and longer by carriage, but short and easy on horseback. The landscape affords plenty of variety, the view in some places being closed in by woods, in others extending over broad meadows, where numerous flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, which the severity of the winter has driven from the mountains, fatten in the spring warmth, and on the rich pasturage”.

Today several well-preserved Roman villas south of Ostia have been excavated in the area of Castel Fusano, including the Villa della Palombara excavated in 1989–2008.

==Excavations==

The remains were used over the centuries as a quarry for marble for the &quot;palazzi&quot; built in Rome.

The Papacy started organising its own digs for sculptures with Pope Pius VII.

Under Benito Mussolini massive excavations were undertaken from 1939 to 1942 during which several remains, particularly from the Republican Period, were brought to light. These were interrupted when Italy became a major battlefield of World War II.

In the post-war period, the first volume of the official series &quot;Scavi di Ostia&quot; appeared in 1954; it was devoted to a topography of the town by Italo Gismondi and after a hiatus the research still continues today. Though untouched areas adjacent to the original excavations were left undisturbed awaiting a more precise dating of Roman pottery types, the &quot;Baths of the Swimmer&quot;, named for the mosaic figure in the &quot;apodyterium&quot;, were meticulously excavated, in 1966–70 and 1974–75, in part as a training ground for young archaeologists and in part to establish a laboratory of well-understood finds as a teaching aid.

It has been estimated that two-thirds of the ancient town are as yet unexcavated.

In 2014, a geophysical survey using magnetometry, among other techniques, revealed the existence of a boundary wall on the north side of the Tiber enclosing an unexcavated area of the city containing three massive warehouses.

==Modern day==
The site of Ostia Antica is open to the public. Finds from the excavation are housed onsite in the Museo Ostiense.

<doc id="92892" wikidata="Q345420" url="?curid=92892" title="Tostig Godwinson">
<text>Tostig Godwinson ( 102925 September 1066) was an Anglo-Saxon Earl of Northumbria and brother of King Harold Godwinson. After being exiled by his brother, Tostig supported the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada&#x27;s invasion of England, and was killed alongside Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066.

== Background ==

Tostig was the third son of the Anglo-Saxon nobleman Godwin, Earl of Wessex and Gytha Thorkelsdóttir, the daughter of Danish chieftain Thorgil Sprakling. In 1051, he married Judith of Flanders, the only child of Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders by his second wife, Eleanor of Normandy. In 1086, the Domesday Book recorded twenty-six vills or townships as being held by Earl Tostig, forming the Manor of Hougun which now forms part of the county of Cumbria in north-west England.

== Earl of Northumbria ==

In the 19th century, the antiquarian Edward Augustus Freeman posited a hypothesis claiming that Edward the Confessor, King of England, was pursuing a policy of &quot;Normanisation&quot; of England and, by doing so, was reducing the influence of the House of Godwin. In 1051, Earl Godwin&#x27;s opposition to Edward&#x27;s policies had brought England to the brink of civil war. Eventually, the Godwins&#x27; opposition convinced Edward to banish them in 1051. Freeman&#x27;s explanation of the banishment has many critics, as it does not explain fully the relationship between the Godwins and the king.

The banished Godwin family, including Gytha and Tostig, together with Sweyn and Gyrth, sought refuge with his brother-in-law the Count of Flanders. They returned to England the following year with armed forces, gaining support and demanding that Edward restore Tostig&#x27;s earldom. Three years later in 1055, Tostig became the Earl of Northumbria upon the death of Earl Siward. He was on intimate terms with his brother-in-law, Edward the Confessor, and in 1061 he visited Pope Nicholas II at Rome in the company of Ealdred, archbishop of York.

Tostig appears to have governed in Northumbria with some difficulty. He was never popular with the Northumbrian ruling class, a mix of Danish invaders and Anglo-Saxon survivors of the last Norse invasion. Tostig was said to have been heavy-handed with those who resisted his rule, including murdering several members of leading Northumbrian families. In late 1063 or early 1064, Tostig had Gamal son of Orm and Ulf son of Dolfin assassinated when Gamal visited him under safe conduct. The &quot;Vita Edwardi&quot;, otherwise sympathetic to Tostig, states that he had &#x27;repressed [the Northumbrians] with the heavy yoke of his rule&#x27;.

He was frequently absent from the court of King Edward in the south, and, possibly, showed a lack of leadership against the raiding Scots. Their king was a personal friend of Tostig, and Tostig&#x27;s unpopularity made it difficult to raise local levies to combat them. He resorted to using a strong force of Danish mercenaries (housecarls) as his main force, an expensive and resented policy (the housecarls&#x27; leaders were later slaughtered by rebels).

In addition, it is likely that local biases played a part in his unpopularity. Tostig was from the south of England, a distinctly different culture from the north, which had not had a southern earl in several lifetimes. In 1063, still immersed in the confused local politics of Northumbria, his popularity apparently plummeted. Many of the inhabitants of Northumbria were Danes, who had enjoyed lesser taxation than in other parts of England. Yet, the wars in Wales, of which Tostig&#x27;s constituents were principal beneficiaries, needed to be paid for. Tostig had been a major commander in these wars attacking in the north while his brother Harold Godwinson marched up from the south.

==Deposition by his brother Harold and the thegns of Northumbria==
On 3 October 1065, the thegns of York and the rest of Yorkshire descended on York and occupied the city. They killed Tostig&#x27;s officials and supporters, then declared Tostig outlawed for his unlawful actions and sent for Morcar, younger brother of Edwin, Earl of Mercia. The northern rebels marched south to press their case with King Edward. They were joined at Northampton by Earl Edwin and his forces. There, they were met by Earl Harold, who had been sent by King Edward to negotiate with them and thus did not bring his forces. After Harold, by then the king&#x27;s right-hand man, had spoken with the rebels at Northampton, he likely realized that Tostig would not be able to retain Northumbria. When he returned to Oxford, where the royal council was to meet on 28 October, he had probably already made up his mind.

==Exile and rebellion==
Harold Godwinson persuaded King Edward the Confessor to agree to the demands of the rebels. Tostig was outlawed a short time later, possibly early in November, because he refused to accept his deposition as commanded by Edward. This led to the fateful confrontation and enmity between the two Godwinsons. At a meeting of the king and his council, Tostig publicly accused Harold of fomenting the rebellion. Harold was keen to unify England in the face of the grave threat from William of Normandy, who had openly declared his intention to take the English throne. It was likely that Harold had exiled his brother to ensure peace and loyalty in the north. Tostig, however, plotted vengeance.

Tostig, along with his family and some loyal thegns, took refuge with his brother-in-law, Baldwin V, Count of Flanders. He travelled to Normandy and attempted to form an alliance with William, who was related to his wife. Baldwin provided him with a fleet and he landed in the Isle of Wight in May 1066, where he collected money and provisions. He raided the coast as far as Sandwich but was forced to retreat when King Harold called out land and naval forces. He moved north and after an unsuccessful attempt to get his brother Gyrth to join him, he raided Norfolk and Lincolnshire. The Earls Edwin and Morcar defeated him decisively. Deserted by his men, he fled to his ally, King Malcolm III of Scotland. Tostig spent the summer of 1066 in Scotland.

He made contact with King Harald III Hardrada of Norway and persuaded him to invade England. One of the sagas claims that he sailed for Norway, and greatly impressed the Norwegian king and his court, managing to sway a decidedly unenthusiastic Hardrada, who had just concluded a long and inconclusive war with Denmark, into raising a levy to take the throne of England. With Hardrada&#x27;s aid, Tostig sailed up the Humber and defeated Morcar and Edwin at the Battle of Fulford.

==Battle of Stamford Bridge==

Hardrada&#x27;s army and Tostig invaded York, taking hostages after a peaceful surrender and while acquiring provisions. King Harold Godwinson raced northward with an English army from London and, on 25 September 1066, surprised his brother Tostig at Stamford Bridge. Hardrada, Tostig, and many of their men were killed. The Norwegians and the Flemish mercenaries hired by Tostig were largely without armour and carried only personal weapons. The day was very hot and they had not expected resistance. Moreover, Hardrada&#x27;s 11,000-man force had been split, with many guarding the Norse ships beached miles away at Riccall.

==Aftermath==
After his death at Stamford Bridge, Tostig&#x27;s body was buried at York Minster. Tostig&#x27;s two sons fled to Norway, while his wife Judith married Duke Welf of Bavaria. The victorious Harold, at the head of troops still exhausted by their previous fight with Tostig and Hardrada, would go to confront and suffer defeat at the hands of the Normans at the Battle of Hastings nineteen days later.

Tostig had two sons, probably born to an Anglo-Danish woman before his marriage to Judith; their names indicate an Anglo-Danish ancestry. They were fostered at the Norwegian court, probably before his marriage in 1051:
* Skuli Tostisson Kongsfostre. He was the great-great-grandfather of King Inge II of Norway and Duke Skule Bårdsson, and the matrilineal great-great-grandfather of Estrid Bjørnsdotter.
* Ketil Tostisson.

==In popular culture==
Popular (as opposed to scholarly) non-fiction books that cover Tostig&#x27;s life and role in history include:
*

He is portrayed by Luther Ford in the 2025 TV series &quot;King and Conqueror&quot;.
