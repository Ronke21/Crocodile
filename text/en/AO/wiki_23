<text>Japan was occupied and administered by the Allies of World War II from the surrender of the Empire of Japan on September 2, 1945, at the war&#x27;s end until the Treaty of San Francisco took effect on April 28, 1952. The occupation, led by the American military with support from the British Commonwealth and under the supervision of the Far Eastern Commission, involved a total of nearly one million Allied soldiers. The occupation was overseen by the US General Douglas MacArthur, who was appointed Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers by the US president Harry S. Truman; MacArthur was succeeded as supreme commander by General Matthew Ridgway in 1951. Unlike in the occupations of Germany and Austria, the Soviet Union had little to no influence in Japan, declining to participate because it did not want to place Soviet troops under MacArthur&#x27;s direct command.

This foreign presence marks the only time in the history of Japan that it has been occupied by a foreign power. However, unlike in Germany, the Allies never assumed direct control over Japan&#x27;s civil administration. In the immediate aftermath of Japan&#x27;s military surrender, the country&#x27;s government continued to formally operate under the provisions of the Meiji Constitution. 

Furthermore, at General MacArthur&#x27;s insistence, Emperor Hirohito remained on the imperial throne and was effectively granted full immunity from prosecution for war crimes after he agreed to replace the wartime cabinet with a ministry acceptable to the Allies and committed to implementing the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, which among other things called for the country to become a parliamentary democracy. Under MacArthur&#x27;s guidance, the Japanese government introduced sweeping social reforms and implemented economic reforms that recalled American &quot;New Deal&quot; priorities of the 1930s under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1947, a sweeping amendment to the Meiji Constitution was passed that effectively repealed it in its entirety and replaced it with a new, American-written constitution, and the Emperor&#x27;s theoretically vast powers, which for many centuries had been constrained only by conventions that had evolved over time, became strictly limited by law as a constitutional monarchy.

While Article 9 of the constitution explicitly forbade Japan from maintaining a military or pursuing war as a means to settle international disputes, this policy soon became problematic especially as neighboring China fell under the control of the Chinese Communist Party and the Korean War broke out. As a result, the National Police Reserve (NPR) was founded in 1950. The NPR was reorganized into the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) in 1954, effectively completing the &quot;de facto&quot; remilitarization of Japan.

The occupation officially ended with the coming into force of the Treaty of San Francisco, signed on September 8, 1951, and effective from April 28, 1952, after which the US military ceased any direct involvement in the country&#x27;s civil administration thus effectively restoring full sovereignty to Japan with the exception of the Ryukyu Islands (Okinawa Prefecture). The simultaneous implementation of the US-Japan Security Treaty (replaced by the revised treaty in 1960) allowed tens of thousands of American soldiers to remain based in Japan indefinitely, albeit at the invitation of the Japanese government and not as an occupation force.

The occupation of Japan can be usefully divided into three phases: the initial effort to punish and reform Japan; the so-called &quot;Reverse Course&quot; in which the focus shifted to suppressing dissent and reviving the Japanese economy to support the US in the Cold War as a country of the Western Bloc; and the final establishment of a formal peace treaty with the 48 Allies of the Second World War and an enduring military alliance with the United States.

== Background ==
=== Initial planning ===
American planning for a post-war occupation of Japan began as early as February 1942, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt established an Advisory Committee on Postwar Foreign Policy to advise him on the postwar reconstruction of Germany, Italy, and Japan (Axis powers). On matters related to Japan, this committee was later succeeded by the smaller Inter-Departmental Area Committee on the Far East (IDAFE), which met 234 times between the autumn of 1942 and the summer of 1945 and had frequent discussions with two US presidents, Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman.

During the war, the Allied Powers had planned to divide Japan amongst themselves for the purposes of occupation, as was done for the Allied-occupied Germany. Under the final plan, however, Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) was to be given direct control over the main islands of Japan (Honshu, Hokkaido, Shikoku, and Kyushu) and the immediately surrounding islands, while outlying possessions were divided between the Allied Powers as follows:
* Soviet Union: Northern Korea, South Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands
* United States: Southern Korea, Okinawa Islands, the Amami Islands, the Ogasawara Islands and Japanese possessions in Micronesia
* China: Taiwan and Penghu

In early August 1945, with Japan&#x27;s surrender seeming probable, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to President Harry S. Truman that Pacific Theatre Commander General Douglas MacArthur be named Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) to oversee the surrender and occupation of Japan. Truman agreed, and MacArthur asked his staff in Manila to begin making concrete preparations for the occupation of Japan.

As the Soviets moved in to occupy their allotted territories, some Japanese forces continued to resist even after the Japanese surrender. Such operations included final battles on the Kuril Islands and South Sakhalin well past the end of August in 1945. In the end, despite its initial hopes, the Soviet Union did not manage to occupy any part of the Japanese home islands, largely due to significant U.S. opposition that was backed by the leverage gained by its then newly realized status as the world&#x27;s only nuclear-armed state.

In any case, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was not inclined to press the Americans very far following Japan&#x27;s surrender. He was not willing to place Soviet troops under MacArthur&#x27;s direct command. Furthermore, in terms of both strategic interests and prestige the Soviets had achieved most of their war aims in the Far East. Moreover, whereas China, Korea and Japan were all a considerable distance from the USSR&#x27;s European heartland, Stalin regarded establishing a powerful buffer against further military threats from the west to be vital to the Soviet Union&#x27;s future existence. He therefore placed a far greater priority on establishing Soviet communist influence in Europe rather than in Asia.

===Japanese surrender and initial landings===
Following the dropping of atomic bombs and the entry of the Soviet Union into the war against Japan, on the night of 9–10 August 1945, Emperor Hirohito announced his decision that the Japanese government should accept the terms demanded by the Allies in the Potsdam Declaration to Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki and his administration. On August 15, 1945, Emperor Hirohito announced Japan&#x27;s surrender to the Japanese people in a nationwide radio broadcast. Two days after Japanese Emperor&#x27;s first radio broadcast informing the surrender of Japan, Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni (a member of Japanese imperial family and father-in-law of Hirohito&#x27;s eldest daughter, Shigeko Higashikuni) became first post-war Prime Minister on August 17, 1945.

Japanese officials left for Manila on August 19 to meet MacArthur and to discuss surrender terms. On August 28, 1945, a week before the official surrender ceremony, 150 US personnel flew to Atsugi, Kanagawa Prefecture. They were followed by the USS &quot;Missouri&quot;, whose accompanying vessels landed the 4th Marine Regiment on the southern coast of Kanagawa. The 11th Airborne Division was airlifted from Okinawa to Atsugi Airdrome, from Tokyo. Other Allied personnel followed.

MacArthur arrived in Tokyo on August 30 and immediately decreed several laws. No Allied personnel were to assault Japanese people or eat the scarce Japanese food. Flying the &quot;Hinomaru&quot; (sun disc), national flag of Japan was initially severely restricted (although individuals and prefectural offices could apply for permission to fly it); this restriction was partially lifted in 1948 and completely lifted the following year.

On September 2, 1945, Japan formally surrendered with the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. On September 6, U.S. President Truman approved a document titled &quot;U.S. Initial Post-Surrender Policy for Japan&quot;. The document set two main objectives for the occupation: eliminating Japan&#x27;s war potential and turning Japan into a democratic nation with pro-United Nations orientation.

===Size and scope===
By the end of 1945, around 430,000 American soldiers were stationed throughout Japan. Of the main Japanese islands, Kyushu was occupied by the 24th Infantry Division, with some responsibility for Shikoku. Honshu was occupied by the First Cavalry Division and Sixth Army. Hokkaido was occupied by the 77th Infantry and 11th Airborne Divisions. By the beginning of 1946, replacement troops began to arrive in the country in large numbers and were assigned to MacArthur&#x27;s Eighth Army, headquartered in Tokyo&#x27;s Dai-Ichi building. In total, including rotations of replacement troops throughout the seven years, nearly 1 million American soldiers would serve in the Occupation, in addition to thousands of civilian contractors and tens of thousands of dependents.

The American forces were supplemented by around 40,000 troops from the British Commonwealth. The official British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF), composed of Australian, British, Indian and New Zealand personnel, did not begin deployment to Japan until February 21, 1946. While U.S. forces were responsible for the overall occupation, BCOF was responsible for supervising demilitarization and the disposal of Japan&#x27;s war industries. BCOF was also responsible for occupation of several western prefectures and had its headquarters at Kure. At its peak, the force numbered about 40,000 personnel. During 1947, BCOF began to decrease its activities in Japan, and officially wound up in 1951.

The Far Eastern Commission and Allied Council for Japan were also established to supervise the occupation of Japan. The establishment of a multilateral Allied council for Japan was proposed by the Soviet government as early as September 1945, and was supported partially by the British, French and Chinese governments.

==Initial phase==

The initial phase of the Occupation focused on punishing Japan for having made war on the Allies, and undertook a thorough reformation of Japanese society to ensure that Japan would never again be a threat to world peace. Reforms targeted all major sectors of Japanese society, government, and economy. Historians have emphasized similarities to the American New Deal programs of the 1930s. Moore and Robinson note that, &quot;New Deal liberalism seemed natural, even to conservative Republicans such as MacArthur and Whitney.&quot;

===Feeding the starving populace===
Before reforms could be undertaken, MacArthur&#x27;s first priority was to set up a food distribution network. Following the collapse of the ruling government and the wholesale destruction of most major cities, virtually the entire Japanese populace was starving. The air raids on Japan&#x27;s urban centers left millions displaced, and food shortages (created by bad harvests and the demands of the war) worsened when the seizure of foodstuffs from Korea, Taiwan, and China ceased. Repatriation of Japanese people living in other parts of Asia and hundreds of thousands of demobilized prisoners of war only aggravated the hunger problem in Japan, as these people put more strain on already scarce resources. Around 5.1 million Japanese returned to Japan in the fifteen months following October 1, 1945, and another million returned in 1947. As expressed by Kazuo Kawai, &quot;Democracy cannot be taught to a starving people&quot;. Initially, the U.S. government provided emergency food relief through Government Aid and Relief in Occupied Areas (GARIOA) funds. In fiscal year 1946, this aid amounted to US$92 million in loans. From April 1946, under the guise of Licensed Agencies for Relief in Asia, private relief organizations were also permitted to provide relief. Even with these measures, millions of people were still on the brink of starvation for several years after the surrender.

===Preserving the Emperor===
Once the food network was in place, MacArthur set out to win the support of Hirohito. The two men met for the first time on September 27, 1945; the photograph of the two together is one of the most famous in Japanese history. Some were shocked that MacArthur wore his standard duty uniform with no tie, instead of his dress uniform, when meeting the Emperor Hirohito. The difference in height between the towering MacArthur and the diminutive Hirohito also impressed upon Japanese citizens who was in charge now. With the cooperation of Japan&#x27;s reigning monarch, MacArthur had the political ammunition he needed to begin the real work of the occupation. While other Allied political and military leaders pushed for Hirohito to be tried as a war criminal, MacArthur resisted such calls, arguing that any such prosecution would be overwhelmingly unpopular with the Japanese people. He also rejected calls for abdication, promoted by some members of the imperial family such as Takahito, Prince Mikasa (younger brother of Hirohito) and former prime minister Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni (father-in-law of Hirohito&#x27;s eldest daughter, Princess Shigeko) and demands of intellectuals like Tatsuji Miyoshi.

=== Disarmament and demobilization ===
Japanese soldiers were rapidly disarmed and demobilized en masse. On September 15, 1945, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters was dissolved. By December, all Japanese military forces in the Japanese home islands were fully disbanded. Occupation forces also exploded or dumped into the sea over 2 million tons of unused munitions and other war materiel.

=== Release of political prisoners ===

The issuing of the Removal of Restrictions on Political, Civil, and Religious Liberties directive by SCAP on October 4, 1945, led to the abolition of the Peace Preservation Law and the release of all political prisoners. Japanese communists were released from jail, and the Japan Communist Party was granted legal status.

===Disestablishment of State Shinto===
On December 15, 1945, the Shinto Directive was issued, abolishing Shinto as a state religion and prohibiting some of its teachings and rites that were deemed to be militaristic or ultra-nationalistic.

=== Trade Union Act ===
On December 22, 1945, at SCAP&#x27;s direction, the Diet passed Japan&#x27;s first ever trade union law protecting the rights of workers to form or join a union, to organize, and take industrial action. There had been pre-war attempts to do so, but none that were successfully passed until the Allied occupation. A new Trade Union Law was passed on June 1, 1949, which remains in place to the present day. According to Article 1 of the Act, the purpose of the act is to &quot;elevate the status of workers by promoting their being on equal standing with the employer&quot;.

===Purge of wartime public officials===
In January 1946, SCAP issued directives calling for the purge of wartime officials from public offices. Individuals targeted in the purge included accused war criminals, military officers, leaders of ultranationalist societies, leaders in the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, business leaders involved in Japanese overseas economic expansion, governors of former Japanese colonies, and national leaders involved in the decisions leading Japan into war. Ultimately, SCAP screened a total of 717,415 possible purgees, and wound up excluding 201,815 of them from holding public office. However, as part of the &quot;Reverse Course&quot; in Occupation policy, most of the purgees would be de-purged and allowed to return to public life by 1951.

===Enfranchisement of women===

After Japan&#x27;s surrender, women&#x27;s leaders in Japan began calling for women&#x27;s enfranchisement. In August 1945, Ichikawa Fusae (a leader of the pre-war women&#x27;s suffrage movement) organized the Women&#x27;s Committee to Cope with Postwar Conditions, a group of 70 Japanese women whose top priorities included women&#x27;s enfranchisement. Swayed by the urges of female leaders, Home Minister Horiuchi Zenjiro advocated for granting women enfranchisement in a meeting of the Japanese male leaders of the Shidehara Cabinet on October 9, 1945. Convinced, the cabinet voted unanimously to grant women the right to vote. Two days later, before any action was taken to enact the cabinet&#x27;s decision, General MacArthur issued his five-point reform directive, one of the points being an order to liberate Japanese women through enfranchisement. After MacArthur issued his directive, the Japanese government officially lowered the voting age and extended the voting franchise to women in future elections. On April 10, 1946, first post-war Japanese general election with 78.52% voter turnout among men and 66.97% among women was held, giving Japan its first prime minister partially elected by men and women, Shigeru Yoshida succeeded Kijūrō Shidehara as prime minister, took office on May 22, 1946.

=== Hirohito renounces his divinity===
At SCAP&#x27;s insistence, as part of a New Year&#x27;s Day message, Emperor Hirohito publicly renounced his own divinity, declaring:
=== Constitutional amendment ===

In 1947, the Diet ratified a new Constitution of Japan through amendment of Meiji Constitution that followed closely a &quot;model copy&quot; drafted by American civilian officials within SCAP, and was promulgated to replace the old Prussian-style Meiji Constitution that had granted the Emperor theoretically unlimited powers. The new constitution drew inspiration from the U.S. Bill of Rights, New Deal social legislation, the liberal constitutions of several European states and even the Soviet Union, and transferred sovereignty from the Emperor to the people in an attempt to depoliticize the Throne and reduce it to the status of a state symbol. Included in the revised charter was the famous Article Nine, whereby Japan forever renounced war as an instrument of state policy and became forbidden to maintain a standing army. The 1947 Constitution also officially enfranchised women, guaranteed fundamental human rights, strengthened the powers of Parliament and the Cabinet, and decentralized the police and local government.

=== Zaibatsu dissolution ===

To further remove Japan as a potential future threat to the United States, the Far Eastern Commission decided that Japan was to be partly de-industrialized. In the end, SCAP adopted a program of de-industrialization and de-concentration in Japan that was implemented to a lesser degree than the similar U.S. &quot;industrial disarmament&quot; program in Germany. To this end, the prewar &quot;zaibatsu&quot; industrial conglomerates were pressured into undergoing &quot;voluntary&quot; dissolution into smaller independent companies. Although SCAP originally planned to break up 325 Japanese companies, as a result of changes in priorities in connection with the &quot;Reverse Course,&quot; in the end only the 11 largest companies were dissolved.

=== Labor Standards Act ===
The Labor Standards Act was enacted on April 7, 1947, to govern working conditions in Japan. According to Article 1 of the Act, its goal was to ensure that &quot;Working conditions shall be those which should meet the needs of workers who live lives worthy of human beings.&quot; Support stemming from the Allied occupation has introduced better working conditions and pay for numerous employees in Japanese business. This allowed for more sanitary and hygienic working environments along with welfare and government assistance for health insurance, pensions plans and work involving other trained specialists. While it was created while Japan was under occupation, the origins of the Act have nothing to do with the occupation forces. It appears to have been the brainchild of Kosaku Teramoto, a former member of the Thought Police, who had become the head of the Labor Standards section of the Welfare Ministry.

=== Education reform ===
Before and during the war, Japanese education was based on the German system, with &quot;Gymnasien&quot; (selective grammar schools) and universities to train students after primary school. During the occupation, Japan&#x27;s secondary education system was changed to incorporate three-year junior high schools and senior high schools similar to those in the United States: Junior high school became compulsory, but senior high school remained optional. The Imperial Rescript on Education was repealed, and the Imperial University system reorganized. The longstanding issue of Japanese script reform, which had been planned for decades but continuously opposed by more conservative elements, was also resolved during this time. The Japanese writing system was drastically reorganized with the Tōyō kanji-list in 1946, predecessor of today&#x27;s Jōyō kanji, and orthography was greatly altered to reflect spoken usage.

===Land reform===

A sweeping land reform was also conducted, led by Wolf Ladejinsky from SCAP. However, Ladejinsky would claim that the real architect of the reform was , former Japanese Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. Between 1947 and 1949, approximately of land (approximately 38% of Japan&#x27;s cultivated land) were purchased from the landlords under the government&#x27;s reform program and resold at extremely low prices (after inflation) to the farmers who worked them. MacArthur&#x27;s land reform redistribution resulted in only 10% of the land being worked by non-owners. By 1950, three million peasants had acquired land, dismantling a power structure that the landlords had long dominated.

=== Punishing war criminals ===


While these other reforms were taking place, various military tribunals, most notably the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Ichigaya, were trying Japan&#x27;s war criminals and sentencing many to death and imprisonment. However, many suspects such as Masanobu Tsuji, Nobusuke Kishi, Yoshio Kodama and Ryōichi Sasakawa were never judged, while the Emperor Hirohito, all members of the imperial family implicated in the war such as Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu (younger brother of Hirohito), Prince Yasuhiko Asaka, Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu, former prime minister Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni (father-in-law of Princess Shigeko, Hirohito&#x27;s eldest daughter) and Prince Tsuneyoshi Takeda, and all members of Unit 731—including its director Dr. Shirō Ishii—were granted immunity from criminal prosecution by General MacArthur.

Before the war crimes trials actually convened, the SCAP, its International Prosecution Section (IPS) and Shōwa officials worked behind the scenes not only to prevent the imperial family from being indicted, but also to slant the testimony of the defendants to ensure that no one implicated the Emperor. High officials in court circles and the Shōwa government collaborated with Allied GHQ in compiling lists of prospective war criminals, while the individuals arrested as &quot;Class A&quot; suspects and incarcerated in Sugamo prison solemnly vowed to protect their sovereign against any possible taint of war responsibility. Thus, months before the Tokyo tribunal commenced, MacArthur&#x27;s highest subordinates were working to attribute ultimate responsibility for attack on Pearl Harbor to former prime minister Hideki Tojo by allowing &quot;the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment.&quot; According to historian John W. Dower, &quot;With the full support of MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters, the prosecution functioned, in effect, as a defense team for the emperor.&quot;

In Dower&#x27;s view, 

== The &quot;Reverse Course&quot; ==
The is the name commonly given to a major shift in the Occupation policies that began in 1947 in response to the emerging global Cold War. In particular, U.S. priorities shifted from punishing and reforming Japan to ensuring internal political stability, rebuilding the shattered economy, and remilitarizing Japan to the extent possible under Article 9, in support of U.S. Cold War objectives in East Asia. This involved relaxing and in some cases even partially undoing earlier reforms the Occupation had enacted in 1945 and 1946. As a U.S. Department of State official history puts it, &quot;this &#x27;Reverse Course&#x27;...focused on strengthening, not punishing, what would become a key Cold War ally.&quot;

An early sign of the shift in SCAP&#x27;s thinking came in January 1947 when MacArthur announced that he would not permit a massive, nationwide general strike that labor unions had scheduled for February 1. Thereafter, the broader shift in Occupation policies became more and more apparent. Thousands of conservative and nationalist wartime leaders were de-purged and allowed to reenter politics and government ministries. In the industrial sector, plans for further anti-trust actions against the remains of the old &quot;zaibatsu&quot; industrial conglomerates were scrapped, and some earlier anti-trust policies were partially undone. The incomplete suppression of the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; allowed them to partially reform as &quot;informal associations&quot; known as &quot;keiretsu.&quot; SCAP also attempted to weaken the labor unions they had recently empowered, most notably issuing an edict stripping public-sector workers of their right to go on strike.

In order to stabilize the Japanese economy as soon as possible, American banker Joseph Dodge was brought in as an economic consultant. Dodge implemented the &quot;Dodge Line&quot; in 1949, a set of draconian contractionary fiscal and monetary policies that caused much hardship for the Japanese populace but succeeded in getting rampant inflation under control. Dodge also fixed the exchange rate at 360 yen to the dollar, a favorable rate that would help boost Japanese exports in the years to come and power the Japanese economic miracle.

As part of the Reverse Course, the United States also began pressuring Japan to remilitarize. In 1950, SCAP established the National Police Reserve (NPR), which would later become the basis of the present-day Japan Self Defense Forces (JSDF), founded in 1954.

The climax of the Reverse course came in the so-called &quot;Red Purge&quot; (&quot;reddo pāji&quot;) of 1950. The &quot;fall&quot; of China to the communists in 1949 and the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 had heightened conservative fears that communism was on the march in East Asia. Against this backdrop, the Japanese government and business leaders, with the connivance and encouragement of SCAP, purged tens of thousands of communists, alleged communists, and other leftists from government posts, private sector jobs, and teaching positions at schools and universities.

The Reverse Course significantly weakened left-wing forces and strengthened conservatives, laying the foundations for decades of conservative rule. At the same time, it did not completely destroy leftist forces that had been deliberately unleashed in the Occupation&#x27;s early stages, setting the stage for extremely contentious political struggles and labor strife in the 1950s, culminating in the massive Anpo protests and Miike Coal Mine Strike, both in 1960.

== Ending the occupation ==

In 1949, MacArthur made a sweeping change in the SCAP power structure that greatly increased the power of Japan&#x27;s native rulers, and the Occupation began to draw to a close. The Treaty of San Francisco, which was to end the occupation, was signed on September 8, 1951. It came into effect on April 28, 1952, formally ending all occupation powers of the Allied forces and restoring full sovereignty to Japan, except for the island chains of Iwo Jima and Okinawa, which the United States continued to hold. American occupation forces remained in Japan in a diminished capacity, until the dissolution of the Far East Command on July 1, 1957. Iwo Jima was returned to Japan in 1968, and most of Okinawa was returned in 1972.

As a condition of securing the end of the Occupation and the restoration of Japanese sovereignty, Japan was compelled by the United States to agree to the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, which has allowed US troops to remain based on Japanese soil on an indefinite basis. Even after the Occupation officially ended in 1952, a
total of 260,000 American soldiers remained based on mainland Japan (exclusive of U.S.-controlled Okinawa, which based tens of thousands more). Even today, some 31,000 US military personnel remain based in Japan, including at major bases near Tokyo, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Aomori, Sapporo, and Ishikari.

Popular anger at the continuing presence of these U.S. military bases in Japan even after the official end of the Occupation continued to grow over the course of the 1950s, leading to a nationwide anti-base movement and a number of spectacular protests, including Bloody May Day in 1952, the Sunagawa Struggle from 1955 to 1957, and the Girard Incident protests in 1957. Partially in response to these protests, the original 1951 Security Treaty was revised into a somewhat less one-sided pact in 1960, resulting in the current U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, which has had the effect of establishing a military alliance between the United States and Japan. However, even the revised treaty was opposed by many in Japan, leading to the massive 1960 Anpo protests, which were the largest protests in Japan&#x27;s modern history.

Since the end of the Occupation, the United States has continuously pressured Japan to revise its American-imposed constitution to remove Article 9 and fully remilitarize. As a result, in 1954 the National Police Reserve was reorganized into the Japan Self-Defense Forces, a &quot;de facto&quot; military force, with U.S. assistance. However, thus far Japan has resisted U.S. pressures to fully rearm and remilitarize. Under the Yoshida Doctrine, Japan continued to prioritize economic growth over defense spending, relying on American military protection to ensure it could focus mainly on economic recovery. Through &quot;guided capitalism,&quot; Japan was able to use its resources to economically recover from the war and revive industry, eventually sparking a lengthy period of unprecedented economic growth remembered as the Japanese economic miracle occurred from the 1960s to the Lost Decades of the 1990s.

== Impact ==

=== Prostitution ===

With the acceptance of the Allied occupation authorities, the Japanese organized a brothel system (the euphemistically named &quot;Recreation and Amusement Association,&quot; or RAA) for the benefit of the more than 300,000 occupation troops. Many Japanese civilians and government officials feared that the Allied occupation troops were likely to rape Japanese women. &quot;The strategy was, through the special work of experienced women, to create a breakwater to protect regular women and girls.&quot; A large contributor to this system being hastily implemented was the experience of the prior comfort women system.

In December 1945, a senior officer with the Public Health and Welfare Division of the occupation&#x27;s General Headquarters wrote regarding the typical prostitute: &quot;The girl is impressed into contracting by the desperate financial straits of her parents and their urging, occasionally supplemented by her willingness to make such a sacrifice to help her family&quot;, he wrote. &quot;It is the belief of our informants, however, that in urban districts the practice of enslaving girls, while much less prevalent than in the past, still exists. The worst victims ... were the women who, with no previous experience, answered the ads calling for &#x27;Women of the New Japan.&#x27;&quot;

MacArthur issued an order, SCAPIN 642 (SCAP Instruction), on January 21 ending licensed brothels for being &quot;in contravention of the ideals of democracy&quot;. Although SCAPIN 642 ended the RAA&#x27;s operations, it did not affect &quot;voluntary prostitution&quot; by individuals. Ultimately, SCAP responded by making all brothels and other facilities offering prostitution off-limits to Allied personnel on March 25, 1946. By November, the Japanese government had introduced the new system in which prostitution was permissible only in certain designated areas.

=== Rape ===
According to Toshiyuki Tanaka, 76 cases of rape or rape-murder were reported during the first five years of the American occupation of Okinawa. However, he asserts this is probably not the true figure, as most cases were unreported. Some historians have estimated that U.S. troops committed thousands of rapes among the population of the Ryukyu Islands during the Okinawa Campaign and the beginning of the American occupation in 1945. One Okinawan historian estimated as many as 10,000 Okinawan women may have been raped in total.

As described above, Japanese authorities had set up a large system of prostitution facilities in order to protect the population from sexual assault. According to John W. Dower, precisely as the Japanese government had hoped when it created the prostitution facilities, while the RAA was in place &quot;the incidence of rape remained relatively low given the huge size of the occupation force.&quot; However, there was a resulting large rise in venereal disease among the soldiers, which led MacArthur to close down the prostitution in early 1946. The incidence of rape increased after the closure of the brothels, possibly eight-fold; Dower states that &quot;According to one calculation the number of rapes and assaults on Japanese women amounted to around 40 &quot;daily&quot; while the RAA was in operation, and then rose to an average of 330 a day after it was terminated in early 1946.&quot; Brian Walsh disputes Dower&#x27;s numbers and states that rape was uncommon throughout the Occupation, with the number of daily rapes being much lower. According to Walsh, the increase in rapes during the termination of the RAA was brief in duration, and the numbers quickly declined thereafter. Michael S. Molasky states that while rape and other violent crime were widespread in naval ports like Yokosuka and Yokohama during the first few weeks of occupation, according to Japanese police reports and journalistic studies, the number of incidents declined shortly after and they were not common on mainland Japan throughout the rest of occupation.

=== Censorship ===
After the surrender of Japan in 1945, SCAP abolished all forms of Japanese censorship and controls on freedom of speech, which would later be enshrined in Article 21 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan. However, two weeks into the Occupation, SCAP began censoring all media; on September 10, 1945, SCAP &quot;issued press and pre-censorship codes outlawing the publication of all reports and statistics &#x27;inimical to the objectives of the Occupation&#x27;.&quot; This included any mention of rape or other sensitive social issues.

According to David M. Rosenfeld:
=== Japanese women ===

It has been argued that the granting of rights to women played an important role in the radical shift Japan underwent from a war nation to a democratized and demilitarized country. In the first postwar general election of 1946, for which Japanese women had suffrage for the first time, over a third of the votes were cast by women. This unexpectedly high female voter turnout led to the election of 39 female candidates, and the increasing presence of women in politics was perceived by Americans as evidence of an improvement of Japanese women&#x27;s condition.

American feminists saw Japanese women as victims of feudalistic and chauvinistic traditions that had to be broken by the Occupation. American women assumed a central role in the reforms that affected the lives of Japanese women: they educated Japanese about Western ideals of democracy, and it was an American woman, Beate Sirota, who wrote the articles guaranteeing equality between men and women for the new constitution. General Douglas MacArthur did not mean for Japanese women to give up their central role in the home as wives and mothers, but rather that they could now assume other roles simultaneously, such as that of worker.

In 1953, journalist Ichirō Narumigi commented that Japan had received &quot;liberation of sex&quot; along with the &quot;four presents&quot; that it had been granted by the occupation (respect for human rights, gender equality, freedom of speech, and women&#x27;s enfranchisement). Indeed, the occupation also had a great impact on relationships between men and women in Japan. The &quot;modern girl&quot; phenomenon of the 1920s and early 1930s had been characterized by greater sexual freedom, but, despite this, sex was usually not perceived as a source of pleasure (for women) in Japan. Westerners, as a result, were thought to be promiscuous and sexually deviant. The sexual liberation of European and North American women during World War II was unthinkable in Japan, especially during wartime where rejection of Western ways of life was encouraged.

The Japanese public was thus astounded by the sight of some 45,000 so-called &quot;pan pan girls&quot; (prostitutes) fraternizing with American soldiers during the occupation. In 1946, the 200 wives of U.S. officers landing in Japan to visit their husbands also had a similar impact when many of these reunited couples were seen walking hand-in-hand and kissing in public. Both prostitution and marks of affection had been hidden from the public until then, and this &quot;democratization of eroticism&quot; was a source of surprise, curiosity, and even envy. The occupation set new models for relationships between Japanese men and women: The Western practice of &quot;dating&quot; spread, and activities such as dancing, movies and coffee were not limited to &quot;pan pan girls&quot; and American troops anymore, and became popular among young Japanese couples.

== Politics ==

Unlike Allied-occupied Germany, the government of Japan continued to exist during the occupation. Although MacArthur&#x27;s official staff history of the occupation referred to &quot;the Eighth Army Military Government System&quot;, it explained that while &quot;In Germany, with the collapse of the Nazi regime, all government agencies disintegrated, or had to be purged&quot;, the Japanese retained an &quot;integrated, responsible government and it continued to function almost intact&quot;:

General Horace Robertson of Australia, head of BCOF, wrote:
The Japanese government&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; authority was strictly limited at first, however, and senior figures in the government such as the Prime Minister effectively served at the pleasure of the occupation authorities before the first post-war elections were held. Political parties had begun to revive almost immediately after the occupation began. Left-wing organizations, such as the Japan Socialist Party and the Japan Communist Party, quickly reestablished themselves, as did various conservative parties. The old Seiyukai and Rikken Minseito came back as, respectively, the Liberal Party (Nihon Jiyuto) and the Japan Progressive Party (Nihon Shimpoto). The first postwar elections were held in 1946 (women were given the franchise for the first time), and the Liberal Party&#x27;s vice president, Shigeru Yoshida (1878–1967), became prime minister. For the 1947 elections, anti-Yoshida forces left the Liberal Party and joined forces with the Progressive Party to establish the new Japan Democratic Party (Minshuto). This divisiveness in conservative ranks gave a plurality to the Japan Socialist Party, which was allowed to form a cabinet, which lasted less than a year. Thereafter, the socialist party steadily declined in its electoral successes. After a short period of Democratic Party administration, Yoshida returned in late 1948 and continued to serve as prime minister until 1954.

== Japanese American contribution ==
Japan accepted the terms of the Potsdam Declaration on August 15, and officially surrendered on September 2, 1945. Over 5,000 Japanese Americans served in the occupation of Japan. Dozens of Japanese Americans served as translators, interpreters, and investigators in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Thomas Sakamoto served as press escort during the occupation of Japan. He escorted American correspondents to Hiroshima, and the USS &quot;Missouri&quot; in Tokyo Bay. Sakamoto was one of three Japanese Americans to be on board the USS &quot;Missouri&quot; when the Japanese formally surrendered. Arthur S. Komori served as personal interpreter for Brig. Gen. Elliot R. Thorpe. Kay Kitagawa served as personal interpreter of Fleet Admiral William Halsey Jr. Kan Tagami served as personal interpreter-aide for General Douglas MacArthur. Journalist Don Caswell was accompanied by a Japanese American interpreter to Fuchū Prison, where the Japanese government imprisoned communists Tokuda Kyuichi, Yoshio Shiga, and Shiro Mitamura.

== Criticism ==
On the day the occupation of Japan was over, the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; published a very critical essay on the occupation, calling it &quot;almost akin to colonialism&quot; and claiming it turned the Japanese population &quot;irresponsible, obsequious and listless... unable to perceive issues in a forthright manner, which led to distorted perspectives&quot;.

<text>Educational reform in [[Occupation of Japan|occupied Japan]] (August 1945 – April 1952) encompasses changes in philosophy and goals of education; nature of the student-teacher relationship; coeducation; the structure of the compulsory education system; textbook content and procurement system; personnel at the Ministry of Education (MEXT); kanji script reform; and establishment of a university in every prefecture. The reforms were directed by the Education Division (Joseph C. Trainor) of the Civil Information and Education Section (CIE; Kermit R. Dyke, followed by Donald M. Nugent) of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP, in Japanese: &quot;GHQ&quot;). Also influential were the two reports of the United States Education Mission to Japan (March 1946; September 1950).

==Background==
During World War II, many Japanese students were mobilized for the war effort, practicing military drills and working in factories, while schools became factory-like production centers. Bombings destroyed some schools, and others were used as refuge centers. After Japan&#x27;s defeat, the occupation forces (SCAP) undertook the task of reconstruction.

SCAP philosophy regarded a reformed educational system as vital for Japan to become a democratic nation. Traditional Japanese methods were nearly opposite to that of the United States: control of schools was highly centralized and rote memorization of textbooks without much interaction described the standard student-teacher relationship, and the study texts were described as boring. Over the period of occupation, these and many other systems were changed. A less centralized hierarchy of school administrators was introduced and parents were allowed to vote for school boards for the first time. A new textbook industry was also created.. The division of school years was made to resemble that of the United States&#x27; at the time which was 6 years Primary education (elementary schools) : 3 years Lower Secondary education (junior high schools); 3 years Upper Secondary education (senior high schools) : 4 years Higher Education (Universities or colleges).

Much of the reform was focused on conditioning students to more readily accept democratic, liberal and egalitarian ideals, directly competing with the prevailing hierarchical structures deeply ingrained in every level of Japanese society, from family life to government institutions. Classes became co-educational single track system composed of 9 compulsory years, moving away from the former 6-year, single-sex, multi-track system. The use of kanji script was overhauled and greatly simplified, eliminating all but 1,850 more commonly used characters, referred to as the &quot;tōyō kanjihyō&quot;.

Initially, before the Japanese Ministry of Education (MEXT) and Allied command&#x27;s Civil Information and Education Section (CI&amp;E) produced new textbooks to replace them, narratives in existing Japanese textbooks found to extol feudalistic, nationalistic, militaristic, authoritarian, State Shinto-religious, or anti-American views were censored during class by students through a process of s&quot;uminuri-kyōkasho&quot;, or &quot;blackening-over textbooks&quot; with ink, under orders of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP).

== Reform Philosophy ==
The Civil Information and Education Division (CIE) under SCAP followed seven principles for implementing education reforms in occupied Japan. The CIE&#x27;s objective was to eliminate practices that contradicted the tenets of democracy and employ democratic models. Some of the CIE&#x27;s main reforms include the 6-3-3-4 school ladder, core curriculum, the program of tests and policies, graduation requirements, collaborative style of learning, and a new course in social studies.

The primary strategy was to establish standards of education common among democratic societies. CIE was aware patterns built from these theories were relative to circumstances. Principles were general, but their expression was comparative. Eventually, these standards became benchmarks for the CIE to ascertain genuine progress in education reforms. The position was militarism and ultra-nationalism (promoting Japanese cultural unity) must not be a segment of school curriculum. The Division removed the military from academic institutions. Decision-making was left to the civilian population. The Americans decentralized administration and authority. At the same time, equality was practiced in education, and discrimination was eliminated. The basis of education must be facts and the experimental method applied whenever necessary. Last but not least teaching must be regarded as a profession that requires special training programs. These principles were published in three documents during the early part of the occupation: The Civil Affairs Handbook (1944), Education in Japan (1946), and Report of the United States Mission to Japan (1946).

Efforts to develop a comprehensive program of a democratic educational platform had to be deferred until after The USA Education Mission to Japan headed by George D. Stoddard concluded its visit in March 1946. This delegation included 26 education experts sent by the government upon the request of occupation leaders. A Japanese team worked hand in hand with the American group.

=== Adopting mixed-sex education ===

Under the rule of occupation by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers after World War II and the reformed School Education Act of Japan, former secondary schools were converted into , established as part of the democratization policy. At that time many public schools with single-sex education were made into mixed-sex education with exception of some schools in Miyagi prefecture, Fukushima prefecture, Gumma prefecture, and Saitama prefecture. 

Rare cases occurred such as in Yamaguchi Prefecture, where former high schools were integrated with nearby former secondary schools and transformed into upper secondary schools under a new school system. Osaka Prefecture converted upper secondary schools under its administration into the new system; however, instead of integrating with neighboring junior/upper secondary schools, they replaced the whole population of students and teachers in school A with those who had belonged to school B.

=== Amami Islands ===

The Amami Islands left Japanese administrative power in 1946 (Showa 21), and the Provisional Government of Northern Ryukyu Islands (ja) introduced their new school system in 1949, delayed by one year.

== Transition from the former to the new school system ==
Various transitional measures were taken to alleviate the turmoil caused by the major changes in the school system due to academic reform. A transitional system was applied between 1947 (Showa 22) and 1950 (Showa 25), when schools consolidated under the former and the new systems coexisted. There were cases that fifth-graders in the former secondary school of 1947 (Showa 22) were given the choice whether to graduate with a diploma of the former secondary school, or to transfer to the senior year in the secondary education in Japan, for one additional year of schooling before graduation.

=== Transition measures for the former primary and secondary education (1946–1950) ===
Public schools

Up to March 1946, compulsory education in the secondary level was offered up to the senior level at public , a level providing lower secondary education equivalent to Senior elementary school called . Graduates were admitted to those surviving Middle schools (ja) or under former system. All those who graduated from elementary schools after March 1947 (Showa 22) were admitted to the current , or for their lower secondary education. Starting in 1935, in some public primary schools, continued education for working youth was offered along with military drills at 
Youth Schools or (ja).

In August 1945, there were three sub-systems to middle schools; for boys , for girls , and for both sexes vocational school . It was in April 1947 (Showa 22) a measure was taken to provide to each faculty of public middle school: although new students admitted in April 1947 were admitted to the current junior high schools at once, those entered middle school level in 1945 and 1946 (sophomore and senior students) were advanced to the attached middle schools as a transition phase to secondary higher education.

Private schools

The private middle schools were given choice of whether they will change to new school system at once, or to apply transitional system. There were cases that private schools decided to continue the attached middle school after 1950, and they offered continued six-year period of secondary education.

University of Tokyo Junior High School

During WWII, they suspended recruiting students for , and in 1946 (Showa 21) very few public secondary schools admitted students as (ja) did, but none in 1947. The freshmen of 1946 became isolated as no new students followed them under former school regulation, and in their senior year in 1948 (Showa 23), the school was reformed into the University of Tokyo Junior High School, recruited new freshmen and sophomores to fill the classrooms. It is reformed later to become the current affiliated to the University of Tokyo.
* 1946 (Showa 21)
* A 6th grader in shotoka, kokumin gakko would enter a reformed junior high in 1947, then graduate and would enter an upper secondary in 1950;
* A 1st grader in , kokumin gakko would transfer to a 2nd grade in a reformed junior high in 1947, then graduate and would enter an upper secondary in 1949;
* A 1st grader at Youth school: in Regular course would transfer to a 2nd grade in a reformed junior high in 1947, then graduate and would enter an upper secondary in 1949;

=== Higher education : 1948–1950, converting to modern universities ===

Under the system former to reformation, the last students were admitted in spring of 1948; Kyusei kotogakko was introduced in 1894 and expired in 1950 after the reformation in 1918, in 1903 as a single major normal school specializing in elementary school education was called with for training educators for high schools and college level.

 along with Kyusei kotogakko had been established as the primary higher education for those who would continue to universities. For Kyusei kotogakko, the senior year graduates, or the 3rd graders who commenced from kotogakko in 1947 were the last generation finishing the full three years&#x27; term of high school education. Those freshmen entered in 1948 completed their first year under the former system, and as it expired at the end of the academic year 1948 or March 1949, they did not qualify to transfer for their choice of colleges under a new system, or . They applied for admission examination and entered colleges and universities in the spring of 1949.

The idea of 1949 educational system reform was to reform so-called high schools under the old system as colleges and universities. As shinsei daigaku or universities under a new system, those high schools under the old system including single major semmon gakko and shihangakko for future educators were renamed.

For students, those who had studied for the full four years&#x27; term and qualify as graduates in 1947 were offered two options. They either could enter kyuseikoko and transfer, or enter shinsei koko, the present day high school and continue to prepare for college/ university. As for special transition measure, those 3rd graders in old high schools were also given those two options. Like on the Komaba campus of University of Tokyo, there were rivalry seen among those high school students of Daiichi Kotogakko against the university students. While the last kyusei daigaku, or old system universities admitted students till 1950, there were considerable number of graduates of old system high schools who either failed at the admission examinations or postponed their applications. Universities established administered by the new system held special examinations for those graduates of past academic years as transfer students.

==== Medical schools ====
In 1949 (Showa 24), under the academic system reform, the qualification for admission to the medical and dental departments became &quot;a person who has completed two years of college and who meets specific requirements (in defined subjects and credits)&quot;. Therefore, a single department (medical/dental) schools and nursing schools transformed and adapted those under 
as two years&#x27; undergraduate course after the academic reformation. The four-year university which had established the “Science Department” made a two-years&#x27; preparatory courses, called , or the “Preparatory Course, Science Department”, especially for medical and dental students: requirements of &quot;two-year university graduates&quot; were hence cleared. 
preparatory two-years colleges
:Fr:Loi sur l&#x27;université
The anomalous state of mixed students with academic achievement under the new and old systems lasted by 1955, when the new regulation for department of medical and dental studies went into effect, and surviving preparatory courses as well as those university preparatory courses was merged into Faculty of Science. Nursing school reform followed the course as well.

<doc id="88003" wikidata="Q83864" url="?curid=88003" title="Menstrual cycle">
<text>The menstrual cycle is a series of natural changes in hormone production and the structures of the uterus and ovaries of the female reproductive system that makes pregnancy possible. The ovarian cycle controls the production and release of eggs and the cyclic release of estrogen and progesterone. The uterine cycle governs the preparation and maintenance of the lining of the uterus (womb) to receive an embryo. These cycles are concurrent and coordinated, normally last between 21 and 35 days, with a median length of 28 days. Menarche (the onset of the first period) usually occurs around the age of 12 years; menstrual cycles continue for about 30–45 years.

Naturally occurring hormones drive the cycles; the cyclical rise and fall of the follicle stimulating hormone prompts the production and growth of oocytes (immature egg cells). The hormone estrogen stimulates the uterus lining (endometrium) to thicken to accommodate an embryo should fertilization occur. The blood supply of the thickened lining provides nutrients to a successfully implanted embryo. If implantation does not occur, the lining breaks down and blood is released. Triggered by falling progesterone levels, menstruation (a &quot;period&quot;, in common parlance) is the cyclical shedding of the lining, and is a sign that pregnancy has not occurred.

Each cycle occurs in phases based on events either in the ovary (ovarian cycle) or in the uterus (uterine cycle). The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase; the uterine cycle consists of the menstrual, proliferative and secretory phases. Day one of the menstrual cycle is the first day of the period, which lasts for about five days. Around day fourteen, an egg is usually released from the ovary.

The menstrual cycle can cause some women to experience premenstrual syndrome with symptoms that may include tender breasts, and tiredness. More severe symptoms that affect daily living are classed as premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and are experienced by 3–8% of women. During the first few days of menstruation some women experience period pain that can spread from the abdomen to the back and upper thighs. The menstrual cycle can be modified by hormonal birth control.

== Cycles and phases ==
The menstrual cycle encompasses the ovarian and uterine cycles. The ovarian cycle describes changes that occur in the follicles of the ovary, whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the endometrial lining of the uterus. Both cycles can be divided into phases. The ovarian cycle consists of alternating follicular and luteal phases, and the uterine cycle consists of the menstrual phase, the proliferative phase, and the secretory phase. The menstrual cycle is controlled by the hypothalamus in the brain, and the anterior pituitary gland at the base of the brain. The hypothalamus releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which causes the nearby anterior pituitary to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Before puberty, GnRH is released in low steady quantities and at a steady rate. After puberty, GnRH is released in large pulses, and the frequency and magnitude of these determine how much FSH and LH are produced by the pituitary.

Measured from the first day of one menstruation to the first day of the next, the length of a menstrual cycle varies but has a median length of 28 days. The cycle is often less regular at the beginning and end of a woman&#x27;s reproductive life. At puberty, a child&#x27;s body begins to mature into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction; the first period (called menarche) occurs at around 12 years of age and continues for about 30–45 years. Menstrual cycles end at menopause, which is usually between 45 and 55 years of age.

=== Ovarian cycle ===
Between menarche and menopause the ovaries regularly alternate between luteal and follicular phases during the monthly menstrual cycle. Stimulated by gradually increasing amounts of estrogen in the follicular phase, discharges of blood flow stop and the uterine lining thickens. Follicles in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one, or occasionally two, become dominant, while non-dominant follicles shrink and die. About mid-cycle, some 10–12 hours after the increase in luteinizing hormone, known as the LH surge, the dominant follicle releases an oocyte, in an event called ovulation.

After ovulation, the oocyte lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization, while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a corpus luteum – a body with the primary function of producing large amounts of the hormone progesterone. Under the influence of progesterone, the uterine lining changes to prepare for potential implantation of an embryo to establish a pregnancy. The thickness of the endometrium continues to increase in response to mounting levels of estrogen, which is released by the antral follicle (a mature ovarian follicle) into the blood circulation. Peak levels of estrogen are reached at around day thirteen of the cycle and coincide with ovulation. If implantation does not occur within about two weeks, the corpus luteum degenerates into the corpus albicans, which does not produce hormones, causing a sharp drop in levels of both progesterone and estrogen. This drop causes the uterus to lose its lining in menstruation; it is around this time that the lowest levels of estrogen are reached.

In an ovulatory menstrual cycle, the ovarian and uterine cycles are concurrent and coordinated and last between 21 and 35 days, with a population average of 27–29 days. Although the average length of the human menstrual cycle is similar to that of the lunar cycle, there is no causal relation between the two.

==== Follicular phase ====

The ovaries contain a finite number of egg stem cells, granulosa cells and theca cells, which together form primordial follicles. At around 20 weeks into gestation some 7 million immature eggs have already formed in an ovary. This decreases to around 2 million by the time a girl is born, and 300,000 by the time she has her first period. On average, one egg matures and is released during ovulation each month after menarche. Beginning at puberty, these mature to primary follicles independently of the menstrual cycle. The development of the egg is called oogenesis and only one cell survives the divisions to await fertilization. The other cells are discarded as polar bodies, which cannot be fertilized. The follicular phase is the first part of the ovarian cycle and it ends with the completion of the antral follicles. Meiosis (cell division) remains incomplete in the egg cells until the antral follicle is formed. During this phase usually only one ovarian follicle fully matures and gets ready to release an egg. The follicular phase shortens significantly with age, lasting around 14 days in women aged 18–24 compared with 10 days in women aged 40–44.

Through the influence of a rise in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few ovarian follicles are stimulated. These follicles, which have been developing for the better part of a year in a process known as folliculogenesis, compete with each other for dominance. All but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle – the one that has the most FSH receptors – will continue to maturity. The remaining follicles die in a process called follicular atresia. Luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulates further development of the ovarian follicle. The follicle that reaches maturity is called an antral follicle, and it contains the ovum (egg cell).

The theca cells develop receptors that bind LH, and in response secrete large amounts of androstenedione. At the same time the granulosa cells surrounding the maturing follicle develop receptors that bind FSH, and in response start secreting androstenedione, which is converted to estrogen by the enzyme aromatase. The estrogen inhibits further production of FSH and LH by the pituitary gland. This negative feedback regulates levels of FSH and LH. The dominant follicle continues to secrete estrogen, and the rising estrogen levels make the pituitary more responsive to GnRH from the hypothalamus. As estrogen increases this becomes a positive feedback signal, which makes the pituitary secrete more FSH and LH. This surge of FSH and LH usually occurs one to two days before ovulation and is responsible for stimulating the rupture of the antral follicle and release of the oocyte.

==== Ovulation ====
Around day fourteen, the egg is released from the ovary. Called ovulation, this occurs when a mature egg is released from the ovarian follicles into the pelvic cavity and enters the fallopian tube, about 10–12 hours after the peak in LH surge. Typically only one of the 15–20 stimulated follicles reaches full maturity, and just one egg is released. Ovulation only occurs in around 10% of cycles during the first two years following menarche, and by the age of 40–50, the number of ovarian follicles is depleted. LH initiates ovulation at around day 14 and stimulates the formation of the corpus luteum. Following further stimulation by LH, the corpus luteum produces and releases estrogen, progesterone, relaxin (which relaxes the uterus by inhibiting contractions of the myometrium), and inhibin (which inhibits further secretion of FSH).

The release of LH matures the egg and weakens the follicle wall in the ovary, causing the fully developed follicle to release its oocyte. If it is fertilized by a sperm, the oocyte promptly matures into an ootid, which blocks the other sperm cells and becomes a mature egg. If it is not fertilized by a sperm, the oocyte degenerates. The mature egg has a diameter of about , and is the largest human cell.

Which of the two ovaries – left or right – ovulates appears random; no left and right coordinating process is known. Occasionally both ovaries release an egg; if both eggs are fertilized, the result is fraternal twins. After release from the ovary into the pelvic cavity, the egg is swept into the fallopian tube by the fimbria – a fringe of tissue at the end of each fallopian tube. After about a day, an unfertilized egg disintegrates or dissolves in the fallopian tube, and a fertilized egg reaches the uterus in three to five days.

Fertilization usually takes place in the ampulla, the widest section of the fallopian tubes. A fertilized egg immediately starts the process of embryonic development. The developing embryo takes about three days to reach the uterus, and another three days to implant into the endometrium. It has reached the blastocyst stage at the time of implantation: this is when pregnancy begins. The loss of the corpus luteum is prevented by fertilization of the egg. The syncytiotrophoblast (the outer layer of the resulting embryo-containing blastocyst that later becomes the outer layer of the placenta) produces human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is very similar to LH and preserves the corpus luteum. During the first few months of pregnancy, the corpus luteum continues to secrete progesterone and estrogens at slightly higher levels than those at ovulation. After this and for the rest of the pregnancy, the placenta secretes high levels of these hormones – along with hCG, which stimulates the corpus luteum to secrete more progesterone and estrogens, blocking the menstrual cycle. These hormones also prepare the mammary glands for milk production.

==== Luteal phase ====

Lasting about 14 days, the luteal phase is the final phase of the ovarian cycle and it corresponds to the secretory phase of the uterine cycle. During the luteal phase, the pituitary hormones FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. The level of FSH and LH fall quickly, and the corpus luteum atrophies. Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle at 10 to 16 days (average 14 days).

=== Uterine cycle ===

The uterine cycle has three phases: menses, proliferative and secretory.

==== Menstruation ====

Menstruation (also called menstrual bleeding, menses or a period) is the first and most evident phase of the uterine cycle and first occurs at puberty. Called menarche, the first period occurs at the age of around twelve or thirteen years. The average age is generally later in the developing world and earlier in the developed world. In precocious puberty, it can occur as early as age eight years, and this can still be normal.

Menstruation is initiated each month by falling levels of estrogen and progesterone and the release of prostaglandins, which constrict the spiral arteries. This causes them to spasm, contract and break up. The blood supply to the endometrium is cut off and the cells of the top layer of the endometrium (the stratum functionalis) become deprived of oxygen and die. Later the whole layer is lost and only the bottom layer, the stratum basalis, is left in place. An enzyme called plasmin breaks up the blood clots in the menstrual fluid, which eases the flow of blood and broken down lining from the uterus. The flow of blood continues for 2–6 days and around 30–60 milliliters of blood is lost, and is a sign that pregnancy has not occurred.

The flow of blood normally serves as a sign that a woman has not become pregnant, but this cannot be taken as certainty, as several factors can cause bleeding during pregnancy. Menstruation occurs on average once a month from menarche to menopause, which corresponds with a woman&#x27;s fertile years. The average age of menopause in women is 52 years, and it typically occurs between 45 and 55 years of age. Menopause is preceded by a stage of hormonal changes called perimenopause.

&quot;Eumenorrhea&quot; denotes normal, regular menstruation that lasts for around the first 5 days of the cycle. Women who experience menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) are more susceptible to iron deficiency than the average person.

==== Proliferative phase ====
The proliferative phase is the second phase of the uterine cycle when estrogen causes the lining of the uterus to grow and proliferate. The latter part of the follicular phase overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle. As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of estradiol, an estrogen. The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus with the spiral arterioles.

As estrogen levels increase, cells in the cervix produce a type of cervical mucus that has a higher pH and is less viscous than usual, rendering it more friendly to sperm. This increases the chances of fertilization, which occurs around day 11 to day 14. This cervical mucus can be detected as a vaginal discharge that is copious and resembles raw egg whites. For women who are practicing fertility awareness, it is a sign that ovulation may be about to take place, but it does not mean ovulation will definitely occur.

==== Secretory phase ====
The secretory phase is the final phase of the uterine cycle and it corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. During the secretory phase, the corpus luteum produces progesterone, which plays a vital role in making the endometrium receptive to the implantation of a blastocyst (a fertilized egg, which has begun to grow). Glycogen, lipids, and proteins are secreted into the uterus and the cervical mucus thickens. In early pregnancy, progesterone also increases blood flow and reduces the contractility of the smooth muscle in the uterus and raises basal body temperature.

If pregnancy does not occur the ovarian and uterine cycles start over again.

==Anovulatory cycles and short luteal phases==

Only two-thirds of overtly normal menstrual cycles are ovulatory, that is, cycles in which ovulation occurs. The other third lack ovulation or have a short luteal phase (less than ten days) in which progesterone production is insufficient for normal physiology and fertility. Cycles in which ovulation does not occur (anovulation) are common in girls who have just begun menstruating and in women around menopause. During the first two years following menarche, ovulation is absent in around half of cycles. Five years after menarche, ovulation occurs in around 75% of cycles and this reaches 80% in the following years. Anovulatory cycles are often overtly identical to normally ovulatory cycles. Any alteration to balance of hormones can lead to anovulation. Stress, anxiety and eating disorders can cause a fall in GnRH, and a disruption of the menstrual cycle. Chronic anovulation occurs in 6–15% of women during their reproductive years. Around menopause, hormone feedback dysregulation leads to anovulatory cycles. Although anovulation is not considered a disease, it can be a sign of an underlying condition such as polycystic ovary syndrome. Anovulatory cycles or short luteal phases are normal when women are under stress or athletes increasing the intensity of training. These changes are reversible as the stressors decrease or, in the case of the athlete, as she adapts to the training.

== Menstrual health ==
Although a normal and natural process, some women experience premenstrual syndrome with symptoms that may include acne, tender breasts, and tiredness. More severe symptoms that affect daily living are classed as premenstrual dysphoric disorder and are experienced by 3 to 8% of women. Dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps or period pain) is felt as painful cramps in the abdomen that can spread to the back and upper thighs during the first few days of menstruation. Debilitating period pain is not normal and can be a sign of something severe such as endometriosis. These issues can significantly affect a woman&#x27;s health and quality of life and timely interventions can improve the lives of these women.

There are common culturally communicated misbeliefs that the menstrual cycle affects women&#x27;s moods, causes depression or irritability, or that menstruation is a painful, shameful or unclean experience. Often a woman&#x27;s normal mood variation is falsely attributed to the menstrual cycle. Much of the research is weak, but there appears to be a very small increase in mood fluctuations during the luteal and menstrual phases, and a corresponding decrease during the rest of the cycle. Changing levels of estrogen and progesterone across the menstrual cycle exert systemic effects on aspects of physiology including the brain, metabolism, and musculoskeletal system. The result can be subtle physiological and observable changes to women&#x27;s athletic performance including strength, aerobic, and anaerobic performance. 

Changes to the brain have also been observed throughout the menstrual cycle but do not translate into measurable changes in intellectual achievement – including academic performance, problem-solving, and memory. Improvements in spatial reasoning ability during the menstruation phase of the cycle are probably caused by decreases in levels of estrogen and progesterone.

In some women, ovulation features a characteristic pain called &quot;mittelschmerz&quot; (a German term meaning &quot;middle pain&quot;). The cause of the pain is associated with the ruptured follicle, causing a small amount of blood loss.

Even when normal, the changes in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle can increase the incidence of disorders such as autoimmune diseases, which might be caused by estrogen enhancement of the immune system.

Around 40% of women with epilepsy find that their seizures occur more frequently at certain phases of their menstrual cycle. This catamenial epilepsy may be due to a drop in progesterone if it occurs during the luteal phase or around menstruation, or a surge in estrogen if it occurs at ovulation. Women who have regular periods can take medication just before and during menstruation. Options include progesterone supplements, increasing the dose of their regular anticonvulsant drug, or temporarily adding an anticonvulsant such as clobazam or acetazolamide. If this is ineffective, or when a woman&#x27;s menstrual cycle is irregular, then treatment is to stop the menstrual cycle occurring. This may be achieved using medroxyprogesterone, triptorelin or goserelin, or by sustained use of oral contraceptives.

=== Hormonal contraception ===

Hormonal contraceptives prevent pregnancy by inhibiting the secretion of the hormones, FSH, LH and GnRH. Hormonal contraception that contains estrogen, such as combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs), stop the development of the dominant follicle and the mid-cycle LH surge and thus ovulation. Sequential dosing and discontinuation of the COCP can mimic the uterine cycle and produce bleeding that resembles a period. In some cases, this bleeding is lighter.

Progestin-only methods of hormonal contraception do not always prevent ovulation but instead work by stopping the cervical mucus from becoming sperm-friendly. Hormonal contraception is available in a variety of forms such as pills, patches, skin implants and hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs).

==Evolution and other species==

Most female mammals have an estrous cycle, but only ten primate species, four bat species, the elephant shrews and the Cairo spiny mouse (&quot;Acomys cahirinus&quot;) have a menstrual cycle. The cycles are the same as in humans apart from the length, which ranges from 9 to 37 days. The lack of immediate relationship between these groups suggests that four distinct evolutionary events have caused menstruation to arise. There are four theories on the evolutionary significance of menstruation:

# Control of sperm-borne pathogens. This hypothesis held that menstruation protected the uterus against pathogens introduced by sperm. Hypothesis 1 does not take into account that copulation can take place weeks before menstruation and that potentially infectious semen is not controlled by menstruation in other species.
# Energy conservation. This hypothesis claimed that it took less energy to rebuild a uterine lining than to maintain it if pregnancy did not occur. Hypothesis 2 does not explain other species that also do not maintain a uterine lining but do not menstruate.
# A theory based on spontaneous decidualization (a process that results in significant changes to cells of the endometrium in preparation for, and during, pregnancy). Decidualization leads to the differentiation of the endometrial stroma, which involves cells of the immune system, the formation of a new blood supply, hormones and tissue differentiation. In non-menstruating mammals, decidualization is driven by the embryo, not the mother. According to this theory, menstruation is an unintended consequence of the decidualization process and the body uses spontaneous decidualization to identify and reject defective embryos early on. This process happens because the decidual cells of the stroma can recognize and respond to defects in a developing embryo by stopping the secretion of cytokines needed for the embryo to implant.
# Uterine pre-conditioning. This hypothesis claims that a monthly pre-conditioning of the uterus is needed in species, such as humans, that have deeply invasive (deep-rooted) placentas. In the process leading to the formation of a placenta, maternal tissues are invaded. This hypothesis holds that menstruation was not evolutionary, rather the result of a coincidental pre-conditioning of the uterus to protect uterine tissue from the deeply rooting placenta, in which a thicker endometrium develops. Hypothesis 4 does not explain menstruation in non-primates.

<text>In Norse mythology (a subset of Germanic mythology), Elli (Old Norse: , &quot;old age&quot;) is a personification of old age who, in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, defeats Thor in a wrestling match.

==&quot;Gylfaginning&quot;==
In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Thor and his companions Loki and Þjálfi are in the hall of the jötunn Útgarða-Loki where they meet difficult challenges testing their strength and skill. Thor has just been humiliated in a drinking challenge and wants to get even.

Then said Thor: &#x27;Little as ye call me, let any one come up now and wrestle with me; now I am angry.&#x27; Then Útgarda-Loki answered, looking about him on the benches, and spake: &#x27;I see no such man here within, who would not hold it a disgrace to wrestle with thee;&#x27; and yet he said: &#x27;Let us see first; let the old woman my nurse be called hither, Elli, and let Thor wrestle with her if he will. She has thrown such men as have seemed to me no less strong than Thor.&#x27; Straightway there came into the hall an old woman, stricken in years. Then Útgarda-Loki said that she should grapple with Ása-Thor. There is no need to make a long matter of it: that struggle went in such wise that the harder Thor strove in gripping, the faster she stood; then the old woman attempted a hold, and then Thor became totty on his feet, and their tuggings were very hard. Yet it was not long before Thor fell to his knee, on one foot. Then Útgarda-Loki went up and bade them cease the wrestling, saying that Thor should not need to challenge more men of his body-guard to wrestling.
Later, when Thor and his company are safely out of Útgarða-Loki&#x27;s hall the jötunn explains that Thor&#x27;s opponent was much more formidable than she appeared to be and that Thor&#x27;s prowess was, in fact, astonishing.
It was also a great marvel concerning the wrestling-match, when thou didst withstand so long; and didst not fall more than on one knee, wrestling with Elli; since none such has ever been and none shall be, if he become so old as to abide &quot;Old Age,&quot; that she shall not cause him to fall.
The story of Thor&#x27;s visit to Útgarða-Loki is only related in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and, unusually, Snorri does not quote any old poems to support it. His sources for the story are unknown and it has been suggested that he largely composed it himself.

Elli is not mentioned in any other extant source but the notion that not even the gods are immune to the effects of aging is supported by the fact that they must consume the apples of Iðunn regularly to stay young.

<text>In Norse mythology, Gleipnir (Old Norse &quot;open one&quot;) is the binding that holds the mighty wolf Fenrir (as attested in chapter 34 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;). Its name means &quot;the entangled one&quot; or &quot;the deceiver&quot;, and has also been translated as &quot;wolf lock&quot; and &quot;absurd lock&quot;.

== &quot;The making of Gleipnir&quot; ==
In Norse mythology, Gleipnir is the third iron rope created by the Norse gods to bind the demon wolf Fenrir. The Gods had attempted to bind Fenrir twice before with huge chains of metal, the iron chains of Leyding and Dromi, which Fenrir had torn apart. Therefore, they commissioned the dwarves to forge a chain that was impossible to break. After the gods failed to bind the demon wolf twice in a row, they asked Freyr&#x27;s messenger Skírnir to find the strongest ropes made by the dwarves. The materials of the chains are:

* The sound of a cat&#x27;s footfall
* The beard of women
* The roots of mountains
* The of the bear
* The breath of the fish
* The spittle of the birds

The dwarves made the chain magically from six things in the world (and these things are now missing in the world because they were taken away to be part of the chain) Even though Gleipnir is as thin as a silken ribbon, it is stronger than any iron chain. It was forged by the dwarves in their underground realm of Niðavellir.

Gleipnir, having bound Fenrir securely, was the cause of Týr&#x27;s lost hand, for Fenrir bit it off in revenge when he was not freed. Gleipnir is said to hold until Ragnarök, when Fenrir will finally break free and devour Odin.

<doc id="88021" wikidata="Q490584" url="?curid=88021" title="Flint, Michigan">
<text>Flint is the largest city and seat of Genesee County, Michigan, United States. Located along the Flint River, northwest of Detroit, it is a principal city within the region known as Mid Michigan. At the 2020 census, Flint had a population of 81,252, making it the twelfth-most populous city in Michigan. The Flint metropolitan area is located entirely within Genesee County. It is the fourth-largest metropolitan area in Michigan with a population of 406,892 in 2020. The city was incorporated in 1855.

Flint was founded as a village by fur trader Jacob Smith in 1819 and became a major lumbering area on the historic Saginaw Trail during the 19th century. From the late 19th century to the mid 20th century, the city was a leading manufacturer of carriages and later automobiles, earning it the nickname &quot;Vehicle City&quot;. General Motors (GM) was founded in Flint in 1908, and the city grew into an automobile manufacturing powerhouse for GM&#x27;s Buick and Chevrolet divisions, especially after World War II up until the early 1980s recession. Flint was also the home of a sit-down strike in 1936–37 that played a vital role in the formation of the United Auto Workers.

Since the late 1960s, Flint has faced several crises. The city experienced an economic downturn after GM significantly downsized its workforce in the area from a high of 80,000 in 1978 to under 8,000 by 2010. From 1960 to 2010, the population of the city nearly halved, from 196,940 to 102,434. In the mid-2000s, Flint became known for its comparatively high crime rates and has repeatedly been ranked among the most dangerous cities in the United States according to crime statistics. The city was under a state of financial emergency from 2002 to 2004 and again from 2011 to 2015.

From 2014 to 2019, Flint faced a public health emergency due to lead contamination in parts of the local water supply as well as an outbreak of Legionnaires&#x27; disease. The acute lead crisis has been addressed as the city has secured a new source of clean water, installed modern copper pipes to nearly every home, and distributed filters to all residents who want them. However, a legacy of distrust in public authorities remains.

==History==
The region was home to several Ojibwe tribes at the start of the 19th century, with a particularly significant community established near present-day Montrose. The Flint River had several convenient fords which became points of contention among rival tribes, as attested by the presence of nearby arrowheads and burial mounds. Some of the city currently resides atop ancient Ojibwe burial grounds.

===19th century: lumber and the beginnings of the automobile industry===
In 1819, Jacob Smith, a fur trader on cordial terms with both the local Ojibwe and the territorial government, founded a trading post at the Grand Traverse of the Flint River. On several occasions, Smith negotiated land exchanges with the Ojibwe on behalf of the U.S. government, and he was highly regarded on both sides. Smith apportioned many of his holdings to his children. As the ideal stopover on the overland route between Detroit and Saginaw, Flint grew into a small but prosperous village and incorporated in 1855. The 1860 U.S. census indicated that Genesee County had a population of 22,498 of Michigan&#x27;s 750,000.

In the latter half of the 19th century, Flint became a center of the Michigan lumber industry. Revenue from lumber funded the establishment of a local carriage-making industry. As horse-drawn carriages gave way to the automobiles, Flint then naturally grew into a major player in the nascent auto industry. Buick Motor Company, after a rudimentary start in Detroit, soon moved to Flint. AC Spark Plug originated in Flint. These were followed by several now-defunct automobile marques such as the Dort, Little, Flint, and Mason brands. Chevrolet&#x27;s first (and for many years, main) manufacturing facility was also in Flint, although the Chevrolet headquarters were in Detroit. For a brief period, all Chevrolets and Buicks were built in Flint.

The first Ladies&#x27; Library Association in Michigan was started in Flint in 1851 in the home of Maria Smith Stockton, daughter of the founder of the community. This library, initially private, is considered the precursor of the current Flint Public Library.

===Early and mid-20th century: the auto industry takes shape===
In 1904, local entrepreneur William C. Durant was brought in to manage Buick, which became the largest manufacturer of automobiles by 1908. In 1908, Durant founded General Motors (GM), filing incorporation papers in New Jersey, with headquarters in Flint. GM moved its headquarters to Detroit in the mid-1920s. Durant lost control of GM twice during his lifetime. On the first occasion, he befriended Louis Chevrolet and founded Chevrolet, which was a runaway success. He used the capital from this success to buy back share control. He later lost decisive control again, permanently. Durant experienced financial ruin in the stock market crash of 1929 and subsequently ran a bowling alley in Flint until the time of his death in 1947.

The city&#x27;s mayors were targeted for recall twice, Mayor David R. Cuthbertson in 1924 and Mayor William H. McKeighan in 1927. Recall supporters in both cases were jailed by the police. Cuthbertson had angered the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) by the appointment of a Catholic police chief. The KKK led the recall effort and supported Judson Transue, Cuthbertson&#x27;s elected successor. Transue however did not remove the police chief. McKeighan survived his recall only to face conspiracy charges in 1928. McKeighan was under investigation for a multitude of crimes which angered city leaders enough to push for changes in the city charter.

In 1928, the city adopted a new city charter with a council-manager form of government. Subsequently, McKeighan ran the &quot;Green Slate&quot; of candidates who won in 1931 and 1932 and he was select as mayor in 1931. In 1935, the city residents approved a charter amendment establishing the Civil Service Commission.

For the last century, Flint&#x27;s history has been dominated by both the auto industry and car culture. The Sit-Down Strike of 1936–1937 saw the fledgling United Automobile Workers triumph over General Motors and establish itself as a major union, leading to widespread unionization in US industry. The successful mediation of the strike by Governor Frank Murphy, culminating in a one-page agreement recognizing the Union and rehiring workers fired due to strike participation began an era of successful organizing by the UAW. The city was a major contributor of tanks and other war machines during World War II due to its extensive manufacturing facilities. For decades, Flint remained politically significant as a major population center as well as for its importance to the automotive industry.

A freighter named after the city, the SS &quot;City of Flint&quot;, was the first US ship to be captured during the Second World War, in October 1939. The vessel was later sunk in 1943. On June 8, 1953, the Flint-Beecher tornado, a large F5 tornado, struck the city, killing 116 people.

The city&#x27;s population peaked in 1960 at almost 200,000, at which time it was the second largest city in the state. The decades of the 1950s and 1960s are seen as the height of Flint&#x27;s prosperity and influence. They culminated with the establishment of many local institutions, most notably the Flint Cultural Center. This landmark remains one of the city&#x27;s chief commercial and artistic draws to this day. The city&#x27;s Bishop International Airport was the busiest in Michigan for United Airlines apart from Detroit Metropolitan Airport, with flights to many destinations in the Mid-West and the Mid-Atlantic.

===Late 20th century: deindustrialization and demographic changes===
Since the late 1960s through the end of the 20th century, Flint has suffered from disinvestment, deindustrialization, depopulation and urban decay, as well as high rates of crime, unemployment and poverty. Initially, this took the form of &quot;white flight&quot; that afflicted many urban industrialized American towns and cities. Given Flint&#x27;s role in the automotive industry, this decline was exacerbated by the 1973 oil crisis with spiking oil prices and the U.S. auto industry&#x27;s subsequent loss of market share to imports, as Japanese manufacturers were producing cars with better fuel economy.

In the 1980s, the rate of deindustrialization accelerated again with local GM employment falling from a 1978 high of 80,000 to under 8,000 by 2010. Only 10% of the manufacturing work force from its height remains in Flint. Many factors have been blamed, including outsourcing, offshoring, increased automation, and moving jobs to non-union facilities in right to work states and foreign countries.

This decline was highlighted in the film &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot; by Michael Moore (the title refers to Roger B. Smith, the CEO of General Motors during the 1980s). Also highlighted in Moore&#x27;s documentary was the failure of city officials to reverse the trends with entertainment options (e.g. the now-demolished AutoWorld) during the 1980s. Moore, a native of Davison (a Flint suburb), revisited Flint in his later movies, including &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;, &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;,
and &quot;Fahrenheit 11/9&quot;.

===21st century===

====First financial emergency: 2002–2004====
By 2002, Flint had accrued $30 million in debt. On March 5, 2002, the city&#x27;s voters recalled Mayor Woodrow Stanley. On May 22, Governor John Engler declared a financial emergency in Flint, and on July 8 the state appointed an emergency financial manager, Ed Kurtz. The emergency financial manager displaced the temporary mayor, Darnell Earley, in the city administrator position.

In August 2002, city voters elected former Mayor James Rutherford to finish the remainder of Stanley&#x27;s term of office. On September 24, Kurtz commissioned a salary and wage study for top city officials from an outside accounting and consulting firm. The financial manager then installed a new code enforcement program for annual rental inspections and emergency demolitions. On October 8, Kurtz ordered cuts in pay for the mayor (from $107,000 to $24,000) and the City Council members (from $23,000 to $18,000). He also eliminated insurance benefits for most officials. After spending $245,000 fighting the takeover, the City Council ended the lawsuits on October 14. Immediately thereafter on October 16, a new interim financial plan was put in place by the manager. This plan initiated controls on hiring, overnight travel and spending by city employees. On November 12, Kurtz directed the city&#x27;s retirement board to stop unusual pension benefits, which had decreased some retiree pensions by 3.5%. Kurtz sought the return of overpayments to the pension fund. However, in December, the state attorney general stated that emergency financial managers do not have authority over the retirement system. With contract talks stalled, Kurtz stated that there either need to be cuts or layoffs to union employees. That same month, the city&#x27;s recreation centers were temporarily closed.

Emergency measures continued in 2003. In May, Kurtz increased water and sewer bills by 11% and shut down operations of the ombudsman&#x27;s office. In September, a 4% pay cut was agreed to by the city&#x27;s largest union. In October, Kurtz moved in favor of infrastructure improvements, authorizing $1 million in sewer and road projects. Don Williamson was elected a full-term mayor and sworn in on November 10. In December, city audits reported nearly $14 million in reductions in the city deficit. For the 2003–2004 budget year, estimates decreased that amount to between $6 million and $8 million.

With pressure from Kurtz for large layoffs and replacement of the board on February 17, 2004, the City Retirement Board agreed to four proposals reducing the amount of the city&#x27;s contribution into the system. On March 24, Kurtz indicated that he would raise the City Council&#x27;s and the mayor&#x27;s pay, and in May, Kurtz laid off 10 workers as part of 35 job cuts for the 2004–05 budget. In June 2004, Kurtz reported that the financial emergency was over.

====Redevelopment====

In November 2013, American Cast Iron Pipe Company, a Birmingham, Alabama based company, became the first to build a production facility in Flint&#x27;s former Buick City site, purchasing the property from the RACER Trust. Commercially, local organizations have attempted to pool their resources in the central business district and to expand and bolster higher education at four local institutions. Examples of their efforts include the following:
* Landmarks such as the First National Bank building have been extensively renovated, often to create lofts or office space, and filming for the Will Ferrell movie &quot;Semi-Pro&quot; resulted in renovations to the Capitol Theatre.
* The Paterson Building at Saginaw and Third street has been owned by the Collison Family, Thomas W. Collison &amp; Co., Inc., for the last 30 years. The building is rich in Art Deco throughout the interior and exterior. The building also houses its own garage in the lower level, providing heated valet parking to The Paterson Building Tenants.
* In 2004, University Park, the first planned residential community in Flint in over 30 years, was built north of Fifth Avenue off Saginaw Street, Flint&#x27;s main thoroughfare.
* Local foundations have funded the renovation and redecoration of Saginaw Street and have begun work turning University Avenue (formerly known as Third Avenue) into a mile-long &quot;University Corridor&quot; connecting University of Michigan–Flint with Kettering University.
*Atwood Stadium, located on University Avenue, received extensive renovations, and the Cultivating Our Community project landscaped 16 different locations as a part of a $415,600 beautification project.
* Wade Trim and Rowe Incorporated made major renovations to transform empty downtown Flint blocks into business, entertainment, and housing centers. WNEM-TV, a television station based in Saginaw, uses space in the Wade Trim building facing Saginaw Street as a secondary studio and newsroom.
* The long-vacant Durant Hotel, formerly owned by the United Hotels Company, was turned into a mixture of commercial space and apartments intended to attract young professionals or college students, with 93 units.
* In March 2008, the Crim Race Foundation put up an offer to buy the vacant Character Inn and turn it into a fitness center and do a multimillion-dollar renovation.
Similar to a plan in Detroit, Flint is in the process of tearing down thousands of abandoned homes to create available real estate. As of June 2009, approximately 1,100 homes have been demolished in Flint, with one official estimating another 3,000 more will have to be torn down.

====Second financial emergency: 2011–2015====
On September 30, 2011, Governor Rick Snyder appointed an eight-member team to review Flint&#x27;s financial state with a request to report back in 30 days (half the legal time for a review). On November 8, Mayor Dayne Walling defeated challenger Darryl Buchanan 8,819 votes (56%) to 6,868 votes (44%). That same day, the Michigan State review panel declared Flint to be in a state of a &quot;local government financial emergency&quot; recommending the state again appoint an emergency manager. On November 14, the City Council voted 7 to 2 to not appeal the state review with Mayor Walling concurring the next day. Governor Snyder appointed Michael Brown as the city&#x27;s emergency manager. On December 2, Brown dismissed a number of top administrators. Pay and benefits from Flint&#x27;s elected officials were automatically removed. On December 8, the office of ombudsman and the Civil Service Commission were eliminated by Brown.

On January 16, 2012, protestors against the emergency manager law including Flint residents marched near the governor&#x27;s home. The next day, Brown filed a financial and operating plan with the state as mandated by law. The next month, each ward in the city had a community engagement meeting hosted by Brown. Governor Snyder on March 7 made a statewide public safety message from Flint City Hall that included help for Flint with plans for reopening the Flint lockup and increasing state police patrols in Flint.

On March 20, 2012, days after a lawsuit was filed by labor union AFSCME, and a restraining order was issued against Brown, his appointment was found to be in violation of the Michigan Open Meetings Act, and Mayor Walling and the City Council had their powers returned. The state immediately filed an emergency appeal, claiming the financial emergency still existed. On March 26, the appeal was granted, putting Brown back in power. Brown and several unions agreed to new contract terms in April. Brown unveiled his fiscal year 2013 budget on April 23. It included cuts in nearly every department including police and fire, as well as higher taxes. An Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District was created by Manager Brown in June 2012 for 11 downtown Flint properties. On July 19, the city pension system was transferred to the Municipal Employees Retirement System by the city&#x27;s retirement board which led to a legal challenge.

On August 3, 2012, the Michigan Supreme Court ordered the state Board of Canvassers to certify a referendum on Public Act 4, the Emergency Manager Law, for the November ballot. Brown made several actions on August 7 including placing a $6 million public safety millage on the ballot and sold Genesee Towers to a development group for $1 to demolish the structure. The board certified the referendum petition on August 8, returning the previous Emergency Financial Manager Law into effect. With Brown previously temporary mayor for the last few years, he was ineligible to be the Emergency Financial Manager. Ed Kurtz was once again appointed Emergency Financial Manager by the Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board.

Two lawsuits were filed in September 2012, one by the city council against Kurtz&#x27;s appointment, while another was against the state in Ingham County Circuit Court claiming the old emergency financial manager law remains repealed. On November 30, State Treasurer Andy Dillon announced the financial emergency was still ongoing, and the emergency manager was still needed.

Michael Brown was re-appointed Emergency Manager on June 26, 2013, and returned to work on July 8. Flint had an $11.3 million projected deficit when Brown started as emergency manager in 2011. The city faced a $19.1 million combined deficit from 2012, with plans to borrow $12 million to cover part of it. Brown resigned from his position in early September 2013, and his last day was October 31. He was succeeded by Saginaw city manager (and former Flint temporary mayor) Darnell Earley.

Earley formed a blue ribbon committee on governance with 23 members on January 16, 2014, to review city operations and consider possible charter amendments. The blue ribbon committee recommend that the city move to a council-manager government. Six charter amendment proposals were placed on the , ballot with the charter review commission proposal passing along with reduction of mayoral staff appointments and budgetary amendments. Proposals which would eliminate certain executive departments, the Civil Service Commission and the ombudsman office were defeated. Flint elected a nine-member Charter Review Commission on May 5, 2015.

With Earley appointed to be emergency manager for Detroit Public Schools on , city financial adviser Jerry Ambrose was selected to finish out the financial emergency with an expected exit in April. On , the state moved the city from under an emergency manager receivership to a Receivership Transition Advisory Board. On November 3, 2015, Flint residents elected Karen Weaver as their first female mayor. On January 22, 2016, the Receivership Transition Advisory Board unanimously voted to return some powers, including appointment authority, to the mayor. The Receivership Transit Authority Board was formally dissolved by State Treasurer Nick Khouri on April 10, 2018, returning the city to local control.

====Water state of emergency====
In April 2014, during a financial crisis, state-appointed emergency manager Darnell Earley changed Flint&#x27;s water source from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (sourced from Lake Huron) to the Flint River. The problem was compounded with the fact that anticorrosive measures were not implemented. After two independent studies, lead poisoning caused by the water was found in the area&#x27;s population. This has led to several lawsuits, the resignation of several officials, fifteen criminal indictments, and a federal public health state of emergency for all of Genesee County.

==Geography==
Flint lies in the Flint/Tri-Cities region of Michigan. Flint and Genesee County can be categorized as a subregion of Flint/Tri-Cities. It is located along the Flint River, which flows through Lapeer, Genesee, and Saginaw counties and is long.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. Flint lies just to the northeast of the Flint hills. The terrain is low and rolling along the south and east sides, and flatter to the northwest.

===Neighborhoods===

Flint has several neighborhoods grouped around the center of the city on the four cardinal sides. The downtown business district is centered on Saginaw Street south of the Flint River. Just west, on opposite sides of the river, are Carriage Town (north) and the Grand Traverse Street District (south). Both neighborhoods boast strong neighborhood associations. These neighborhoods were the center of manufacturing for and profits from the nation&#x27;s carriage industry until the 1920s and are the site of many well-preserved Victorian homes and the setting of Atwood Stadium.

The University Avenue corridor of Carriage Town is home to the largest concentration of Greek housing in the area, with fraternity houses from both Kettering University, and the University of Michigan-Flint. Chapter houses include Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Delta Chi, Theta Chi, Lambda Chi Alpha, Theta Xi, Alpha Phi Alpha, Phi Gamma Delta, and Delta Tau Delta Fraternities.

Just north of downtown is River Village, an example of gentrification via mixed-income public housing. To the east of I-475 is Central Park and Fairfield Village. These are the only two neighborhoods between UM-Flint and Mott Community College and enjoy strong neighborhood associations. Central Park piloted a project to convert street lights to LED and is defined by seven cul-de-sacs.

The North Side and 5th Ward are predominantly African American, with such historic districts as Buick City and Civic Park on the north, and Sugar Hill, Floral Park, and Kent and Elm Parks on the south. Many of these neighborhoods were the original centers of early Michigan blues. The South Side in particular was also a center for multi-racial migration from Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Deep South since World War II. These neighborhoods are most often lower income but have maintained some level of economic stratification. The East Side is the site of the Applewood Mott Estate, and Mott Community College, the Cultural Center, and East Village, one of Flint&#x27;s more prosperous areas. The surrounding neighborhood is called the College/Cultural Neighborhood, with a strong neighborhood association, lower crime rate and stable housing prices.

Just north is Eastside Proper, also known as the State Streets, and has much of Flint&#x27;s Hispanic community.
The West Side includes the main site of the 1936–37 sit-down strike, the Mott Park neighborhood, Kettering University, and the historic Woodcroft Estates, owned in the past by legendary automotive executives and current home to prominent and historic Flint families such as the Motts, the Manleys, and the Smiths.

Facilities associated with General Motors in the past and present are scattered throughout the city, including GM Truck and Bus, Flint Metal Center and Powertrain South (clustered together on the city&#x27;s southwestern corner); Powertrain North, Flint Tool and Die and Delphi East. The largest plant, Buick City, and adjacent facilities have been demolished.
Half of Flint&#x27;s fourteen tallest buildings were built during the 1920s. The 19-story Genesee Towers, formerly the city&#x27;s tallest building, was completed in 1968. The building became unused in later years and fell into severe disrepair: a cautionary sign warning of falling debris was put on the sidewalk in front of it. An investment company purchased the building for $1, and it was demolished (by implosion) on December 22, 2013.

===Climate===

===American football===
There is semi-pro football at Atwood Stadium with the Flint Fury. Atwood is an 11,000+ seat stadium in downtown Flint which has hosted many events, including baseball. When artificial turf was installed, it was no longer able to host baseball games. The Flint Fury have been in action since 2003, and are currently a part of the Great Lakes Football League. The team was founded by two of its players; Charles Lawler and Prince Goodson, who both played for the defunct Flint Falcons semi-pro team. The team is now solely owned by Lawler.

The 2009 Heisman Trophy winner Mark Ingram II, born and raised in Grand Blanc, attended his final year of high school at Flint Southwestern Academy. He won the Heisman with 1304 total votes. Ingram attended the University of Alabama and is their first Heisman winner. He was a member of the National Champion 2009 Alabama Crimson Tide football team.

===Basketball===
Many Flint natives have played basketball in the National Basketball Association (NBA), NCAA Division 1 or European professional basketball. NBA champion Glen Rice, Eddie Robinson and three-time NBA champion JaVale McGee, and Washington Wizards forward Kyle Kuzma all hail from Flint, as do Morris Peterson, Mateen Cleaves, and Charlie Bell (four of the five starters from Michigan State University&#x27;s &quot;Flintstones&quot; 2000 National Championship team).

Local teacher and independent film maker Marcus Davenport chronicles Flint&#x27;s ties to basketball and the basketball culture in his documentary &quot;Flint Star: The Motion Picture&quot;. Will Ferrell&#x27;s 2008 movie &quot;Semi-Pro&quot; is based on the fictional basketball team the &quot;Flint Tropics&quot;.

===Ice hockey===
On January 14, 2015, the Ontario Hockey League&#x27;s Plymouth Whalers were relocated to Flint after a sale of the team to the owner of Perani Arena for the 2015–16 season.

===Other sports===
Flint is twinned with Hamilton, Ontario, and its amateur athletes compete in the CANUSA Games, held alternatively between the two cities since 1957.

===Former sports teams===
==Government==

The city levies an income tax of 1 percent on residents and 0.5 percent on nonresidents. The 1974 Charter is the city&#x27;s current charter that gives the city a strong mayor form of government. It also instituted the appointed independent office of Ombudsman, while the city clerk is solely appointed by the city council. The city council is composed of members elected from the city&#x27;s nine wards. A Charter Review Commission is currently impaneled to review the charter for a complete overhaul. The city operated under state-led financial receivership from April 30, 2015, to April 10, 2018, which saw the city under an Emergency Manager as the State of Michigan had declared a state of local government financial emergency. The Receivership Transition Advisory Board had the authority to override council decisions related to financial matters. The city has operated under at least four charters (1855, 1888, 1929, 1974).

===Law enforcement===
Law enforcement in Flint is the responsibility of the Flint Police Department, the Genesee County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, and the Michigan State Police. Flint has been consistently ranked as one of the most dangerous cities in the United States by multiple sources. From 2007 to 2009, violent crime in Flint was ranked in the top five among U.S. cities with a population of at least 50,000 people. From 2010 to 2012, Flint ranked as the city with the highest violent crime rate among cities with over 100,000 population. In 2015, &quot;CQ Press&quot; (using FBI statistics) ranked the crime index for Flint as seventh-highest in cities with population greater than 75,000. In 2018, the FBI reported Flint was ranked as America&#x27;s sixth most violent city among those with population of 50,000 or more in 2017. Violent crimes were up 23% compared to 2016 according to the report.

===Politics===
Most politicians are affiliated with the Democratic party despite the city&#x27;s elections being nonpartisan. In 2006, Flint was the tenth most liberal city in the United States, according to a nationwide study by the non-partisan Bay Area Center for Voting Research, which examined the voting patterns of 237 cities with a population over 100,000.

The city elected Karen Weaver as its first female mayor in 2015. She was succeeded in 2020 by Sheldon Neeley.

* Mott Community College
* Michigan State University College of Human Medicine

===Primary and secondary schools===
Public K-12 education is provided under the umbrella of the Flint Community Schools. Students attend ten elementary schools, one middle school, and one high school (Flint Southwestern Academy). The city&#x27;s original high school, Flint Central High School, was closed in 2009 because of a budget deficit and a lack of maintenance on the building by the Flint School District. The building, however, still stands. Flint Northern High School was converted to an alternative education school at the start of the 2013–14 school year and was closed later in 2014. The state-run Michigan School for the Deaf is located in Flint, and Michigan School for the Blind was previously there, having moved from Lansing in 1995.

The Catholic high school is Fr. Luke M. Powers Catholic High School which is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lansing and serves the entire county. The school moved from its location just north of Flint in Mt. Morris Township in 2013 into the former Michigan School for the Deaf building off of Miller Road in Flint, which received a $22 million renovation. The Valley School is a small private K–12 school. Flint also has several charter schools, including International Academy of Flint, Flint Cultural Center Academy and Eagle&#x27;s Nest Academy.

===Print===
The county&#x27;s largest newspaper is &quot;The Flint Journal&quot;, which dates back to 1876. Effective June 2009 the paper ceased to be a daily publication, opting to publish on Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays. The move made Genesee County the largest county in the United States without a daily newspaper. The Flint Journal began publishing a Tuesday edition in March 2010.
&quot;The East Village Magazine&quot; is a non-profit news magazine providing information about neighborhood issues since 1976. The monthly magazine centers on the East Village neighborhood, outside downtown Flint, but is distributed throughout the city. &quot;The Uncommon Sense&quot; was a monthly publication featuring investigative journalism, political analysis, satirical cartoons, and articles about Flint music, art, nightlife and culture; it stopped publishing in 2007.

This monthly publication features local and nationally recognized comic artists, as well as editorials, and other news.

Two quarterly magazines have appeared in recent years: &quot;Innovative Health Magazine&quot; and &quot;Downtown Flint Revival Magazine&quot;. Debuting in 2008, &quot;Innovative Health&quot; highlights the medical advancements, health services and lifestyles happening in and around Genesee County, while &quot;Downtown Flint Revival&quot; reports on new developments, building renovations and the many businesses in the Downtown area. A new monthly magazine which began publishing in June 2013 is known as &quot;My City Magazine&quot; which highlights events, arts and culture in Genesee County.
Online news source FlintBeat.com was launched in 2017 by Flint-area native, Jiquanda Johnson. The hyper local news website focuses on Flint City Hall, solutions journalism and public health in addition to their work covering neighborhoods and telling community stories.
University publications include University of Michigan–Flint&#x27;s student newspaper &quot;The Michigan Times&quot;, Kettering University&#x27;s &quot;The Technician&quot; and the &quot;MCC Chronicle&quot;, formerly the MCC Post, which is a monthly magazine from Mott Community College.

===Television===
WJRT-TV (ABC), formerly one of ten ABC owned-and-operated stations, is currently the only area station to operate from Flint. WSMH (Fox) is licensed to Flint, but its programming originates from outside of Flint proper (the suburb Mt. Morris Township), WEYI (NBC), licensed to Saginaw, and WBSF (The CW), licensed to Bay City, share studios with WSMH. Other stations outside the Flint area that serve the area include Saginaw-based WNEM-TV (CBS) (which has a news bureau in Downtown Flint), Delta College&#x27;s WDCQ-TV (PBS), and Saginaw&#x27;s WAQP (TCT).

===Radio===
The Flint radio market has a rich history. WAMM-AM 1420 (started in 1955, now gospel station WFLT) on the city&#x27;s eastside was one of the first stations in the country to program to the black community and was also where legendary DJ Casey Kasem had his first radio job. WTAC-AM 600 (now religious station WSNL) was a highly rated and influential Top 40 station in the 1960s and 1970s, showcasing Michigan artists and being the first in the U.S. to play acts like The Who and AC/DC. WTAC changed its format to country music in 1980 and then became a pioneering contemporary Christian music station a few years later; the calls are now on 89.7 FM, a member of the &quot;Smile FM&quot; network. WTRX-AM 1330 also played Top 40 music for a time in the 1960s and &#x27;70s. The city&#x27;s first radio station, AM 910 WFDF, first went on the air in 1922. It has since relocated south into the Detroit market, changing its city of license to Farmington Hills and increasing its power to 50,000 watts.

===Railroads===

Amtrak provides intercity passenger rail service on the &quot;Blue Water&quot; line from Chicago to Port Huron at the border to Canada. The Amtrak station is located on Dort Highway, just north of I-69. The station was built in 1989 and replaced an earlier Grand Trunk Western Railroad (GTW) station closer to downtown. Canadian National Railway (GTW&#x27;s successor) and Lake State Railway provide freight service to Flint, with CN operating from Bristol Yard on the western side of the city and LSRC operating from the former CSX Transportation McGrew Yard to the north. While CSX ceded control of their former Saginaw Subdivision north of Plymouth to LSRC in 2019, they continue to operate trackage rights trains over CN from Flint to Port Huron several times per week as of 2020. Into the late 1940s, the Pere Marquette Railway operated daily passenger trains through a separate station miles away, with trains heading north to Saginaw and Bay City and south to Detroit&#x27;s Fort Street Union Depot.

===Airports===

In 1992, St. Joseph Health Systems changed its name to Genesys Health System and the names of its four hospitals to Genesys Regional Medical Center (GRMC). On February 15, 1997, all the former GHS hospitals were consolidated into one hospital at Genesys Regional Medical Center at Health Park in suburban Grand Blanc Township (now owned by Ascension Health who later changed its name to Ascension Genesys Hospital) and Flint Osteopathic Hospital was razed during the Spring/Summer of 2015.

<doc id="88022" wikidata="Q1435524" url="?curid=88022" title="Fólkvangr">
<text>In Norse mythology, Fólkvangr (Old Norse &quot;field of the host&quot; or &quot;people-field&quot; or &quot;army-field&quot;) is a meadow or field ruled over by the goddess Freyja where half of those that die in combat go upon death, whilst the other half go to the god Odin in Valhalla. Others were also brought to Fólkvangr after their death; &quot;Egils Saga&quot;, for example, has a world-weary female character declare that she will never taste food again until she dines with Freyja. 
Fólkvangr is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. According to the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, within Fólkvangr is Freyja&#x27;s hall Sessrúmnir. Scholarly theories have been proposed about the implications of the location.

==Attestations==
In the poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot; collected in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, Odin (disguised, or &quot;Grímnir&quot;) tells the young Agnar that Freyja allots seats in her hall Fólkvangr to half of those that die, while Odin receives the other half (&quot;Fólkvangr&quot; is here anglicized to &quot;Fôlkvang&quot; and &quot;Folkvang&quot;):

In chapter 24 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, High tells Gangleri (described as king Gylfi in disguise) that Freyja is &quot;the most glorious of the ásynjur&quot;, that Freyja has a dwelling in the heavens called Fólkvangr, and that &quot;whenever she rides to battle she gets half of the slain, and the other half Odin, as it says here: [the stanza above from &quot;Grímnismál&quot; is then quoted]&quot;. High then continues with a description of Freyja&#x27;s hall Sessrúmnir.

==Theories==

===&quot;Egils saga&quot;===
In &quot;Egils saga&quot;, when Egill Skallagrímsson refuses to eat, his daughter Þorgerðr (here anglicized as &quot;Thorgerd&quot;) says she will go without food and thus starve to death, and in doing so will meet the goddess Freyja:

:Thorgerd replied in a loud voice, &#x27;I have had no evening meal, nor will I do so until I join Freyja. I know no better course of action than my father&#x27;s. I do not want to live after my father and brother are dead.&#x27;

Britt-Mari Näsström says that &quot;as a receiver of the dead her [Freyja&#x27;s] abode is also open for women who have suffered a noble death.&quot; Näsström cites the above passage from &quot;Egils saga&quot; as an example, and points to a potential additional connection in the saga &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot;, where the queen hangs herself in the dísarsalr (Old Norse &quot;the Hall of the Dís&quot;) after discovering that her husband has betrayed both her father and brother. Näsström comments that &quot;this Dís could hardly be anyone but Freyja herself, the natural leader of the collective female deities called dísir, and the place of the queen&#x27;s suicide seems thus to be connected with Freyja.&quot;

===Implications===
John Lindow says that if the &quot;Fólk-&quot; element of &quot;Fólkvangr&quot; is to be understood as &quot;army&quot;, then Fólkvangr appears as an alternative to Valhalla. Lindow adds that, like Odin, Freyja has an association with warriors in that she presides over the eternal combat of Hjaðningavíg.

Rudolf Simek theorizes that the name &quot;Fólkvangr&quot; is &quot;surely not much older than &quot;Grímnismál&quot; itself&quot;, and adds that the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; description keeps close to the &quot;Grímnismál&quot; description, yet that the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; descriptions adds that Sessrúmnir is located within Fólkvangr. According to Hilda Ellis Davidson, Valhalla &quot;is well known because it plays so large a part in images of warfare and death,&quot; yet the significance of other halls in Norse mythology such as Ýdalir, where the god Ullr dwells, and Freyja&#x27;s Fólkvangr have been lost.

Britt-Mari Näsström places emphasis on that &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; relates that &quot;whenever she rides into battle she takes half of the slain,&quot; and interprets &quot;Fólkvangr&quot; as &quot;the field of the Warriors.&quot; Näsström comments that:

Freyja receives the slain heroes of the battlefield quite respectfully as Óðinn does. Her house is called Sessrumnir, &#x27;filled with many seats&#x27;, and it probably fills the same function as Valhöll, &#x27;the hall of the slain&#x27;, where the warriors eat and drink beer after the fighting. Still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse View of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn and the other to Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally &#x27;the one who chooses the slain&#x27;.

Siegfried Andres Dobat comments that &quot;in her mythological role as the chooser of half the fallen warriors for her death realm Fólkvangr, the goddess Freyja, however, emerges as the mythological role model for the Valkyrjar and the dísir.&quot;

===Stone ships and Proto-Germanic afterlife location===
In a 2012 paper, Joseph S. Hopkins and Haukur Þorgeirsson propose a connection between Fólkvangr, Sessrúmnir, and numerous stone ships found throughout Scandinavia. According to Hopkins and Haukur, Fólkvangr and Sessrumir together paint an image of a ship and a field, which has broader implications and may connect Freyja to the &quot;Isis&quot; of the Suebi:

Perhaps each source has preserved a part of the same truth and Sessrúmnir was conceived of as both a ship and an afterlife location in Fólkvangr. &#x27;A ship in a field&#x27; is a somewhat unexpected idea, but it is strongly reminiscent of the stone ships in Scandinavian burial sites. &#x27;A ship in the field&#x27; in the mythical realm may have been conceived as a reflection of actual burial customs and vice versa. It is possible that the symbolic ship was thought of as providing some sort of beneficial property to the land, such as good seasons and peace brought on by Freyr’s mound burial in &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;.

Evidence involving ships from the pre-Christian period and from folklore may be similarly re-examined with this potential in mind. For example, if Freyja is taken as a possessor of a ship, then this ship iconography may lend support to positions arguing for a connection between a Vanir goddess and the &quot;Isis&quot; of the Suebi, who is associated with ship symbolism in Tacitus’s &quot;Germania&quot;. Afterlife beliefs involving strong nautical elements, and, separately, afterlife fields, have been identified in numerous Indo-European cultures …&quot;
Hopkins and Haukur additionally propose a connection between Fólkvangr and a variety of other Germanic words referring to the afterlife that contain extensions of Proto-Germanic *&quot;wangaz&quot;, including Old English &quot;Neorxnawang&quot;, potentially pointing to an early Germanic &quot;&#x27;*wangaz&quot; of the dead&#x27;.

==Modern influence==
Early in the 20th century, Karl Ernst Osthaus developed the &quot;Folkwang-Gedanke&quot; or &quot;Folkwang-Konzept&quot;, that art and life can be reconciled. Several cultural institutions bearing the name &quot;Folkwang&quot; (the German spelling of Fólkvangr) were founded on this concept. These institutions include the Museum Folkwang in Essen (opened 1902), the publishing house Folkwang-Verlag (founded 1919), Folkwang Kammerorchester Essen (founded 1958), Folkwang-Musikschule in Essen (founded 1974), and Folkwang University of the Arts, focusing on music, theater, dance, design and academic studies.

<text>In Norse mythology, Sessrúmnir (Old Norse &quot;seat-room&quot; or &quot;seat-roomer&quot;) is both the goddess Freyja&#x27;s hall located in Fólkvangr, a field where Freyja receives half of those who die in battle (Odin takes the other half to Valhalla), and also the name of a ship. Both the hall and the ship are attested in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholarly theories have been proposed regarding a potential relation between the hall and the ship.

==Attestations==
Sessrúmnir is specifically referred to as a hall in chapter 24 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;. After describing Fólkvangr, High tells Gangleri (described as king Gylfi in disguise) that Freyja has the hall Sessrúmnir, and that &quot;it is large and beautiful&quot;.

Sessrúmnir is secondly referred to in chapter 20 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;. In the chapter, means of referring to Freyja are given, including a reference to Sessrúmnir: &quot;possessor of the fallen slain and of Sessrúmnir [...]&quot;. Sessrúmnir is referenced a third and final time within a list of ship names in chapter 75.

==Theories==
Rudolf Simek theorizes that one of the two notions of Sessrúmnir (as a ship or as a hall) may come from a misunderstanding, as the meaning of the name can be understood in both cases as &quot;space with many or roomy seats.&quot; In a 2012 paper, Joseph S. Hopkins and Haukur Þorgeirsson propose a connection between Fólkvangr, Sessrúmnir, and numerous stone ships found throughout Scandinavia. According to Hopkins and Haukur, Fólkvangr and Sessrumir together paint an image of a ship and a field, which has broader implications and may connect Freyja to the &quot;Isis&quot; of the Suebi mentioned by Roman senator Tacitus in his first century &quot;Germania&quot;.

<doc id="88039" wikidata="Q1404831" url="?curid=88039" title="Fensalir">
<text>In Norse mythology, Fensalir (Old Norse &quot;Fen Halls&quot;) is a location where the goddess Frigg dwells. Fensalir is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the location, including that the location may have some connection to religious practices involving springs, bogs, or swamps in Norse paganism, and that it may be connected to the goddess Sága&#x27;s watery location Sökkvabekkr.

==Attestations==

In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, Frigg is described as weeping over her son Baldr&#x27;s death in Fensalir. This stanza is absent in the &quot;Hauksbók&quot; manuscript of the poem. The portion of the stanza mentioning Fensalir foretells that vengeance will come for the death of Baldr and that:

:while Frigg wept
:in Fen Halls
:for Valhǫll&#x27;s woe.

In chapter 35 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, High tells Gangleri (described as king Gylfi in disguise) that Frigg is the highest among the ásynjur or Aesir, and that &quot;she has a dwelling called Fensalir and it is very splendid.&quot; In chapter 49, High says that when Loki witnessed that Baldr had gained invincibility due to the oath all things took not to harm him, Loki went to Fensalir appearing as a woman. In his disguise, Loki there asked Frigg why Baldr was not harmed by the objects. Frigg revealed that it is due to the oath they have taken. The disguised Loki asks if nothing can hurt Baldr, and Frigg reveals that only mistletoe can, for it seemed to her too young to demand an oath from. After this, Loki immediately disappears, and subsequently engineers the death of Baldr with a mistletoe projectile.

In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Fensalir receives a third and final mention. In chapter 19, ways to refer to Frigg are provided, including that Frigg may be referred to as &quot;queen of Æsir and Asyniur, of Fulla and falcon form and Fensalir.&quot;

==Theories==
In 1882, the German scholar Anton Edzardi proposed that Fensalir may point to religious practices involving springs. John Lindow comments that &quot;I have no idea why Frigg should live in a boggy place, despite the old argument that there is an association with a cult situated at a spring.&quot; Rudolf Simek comments that Edzardi&#x27;s theory &quot;must remain unanswered.&quot; In addition, Edzardi theorized a connection between Fensalir and a belief in folklore that particular swamps act as an entrance to the realm of Holda, whom he connects with Frigg.

In a 19th-century work, Paul Henri Mallet and Walter Scott write that the &quot;fen&quot; element of &quot;Fensalir&quot; &quot;may also be made to sig[nify] the watery deep, or the sea.&quot; This etymology has resulted in theories that the name &quot;Fensalir&quot; may mean &quot;Sea Halls&quot; rather than &quot;Fen Halls.&quot; In his 19th-century translation of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, Henry Adams Bellows comments that &quot;some scholars have regarded [Frigg] as a solar myth, calling her the sun-goddess, and pointing out that her home in &quot;Fensalir&quot; (&quot;the sea-halls&quot;) symbolizes the daily setting of the sun beneath the ocean horizon.&quot;

John Lindow says that due to similarity between the goddess Sága&#x27;s Sökkvabekkr and Fensalir, the open drinking between Sága and Odin, and the potential etymological basis for Sága being a seeress &quot;have led most scholars to understand Sága as another name for Frigg.&quot; Stephan Grundy states that &quot;Sága&quot; and &quot;Sökkvabekkr&quot; may be by-forms of &quot;Frigg&quot; and &quot;Fensalir&quot; used for the purpose of composing alliterative verse.

Britt-Mari Näsström theorizes that &quot;Frigg&#x27;s role as a fertility goddess is revealed in the name of her abode, Fensalir [...]&quot;, that Frigg is the same as Sága, and that both the names &quot;Fensalir&quot; and &quot;Sökkvabekkr&quot; &quot;imply a goddes living in the water and recall the fertility goddess Nerthus.&quot;

<doc id="88042" wikidata="Q168403" url="?curid=88042" title="Myopia">
<text>Myopia, also known as near-sightedness and short-sightedness, is an eye disease where light from distant objects focuses in front of, instead of on, the retina. As a result, distant objects appear blurry while close objects appear normal. Other symptoms may include headaches and eye strain. Severe myopia is associated with an increased risk of macular degeneration, retinal detachment, cataracts, and glaucoma.
Myopia results from the length of the eyeball growing too long or less commonly the lens being too strong. It is a type of refractive error. Diagnosis is by the use of cycloplegics during eye examination.

Tentative evidence indicates that the risk of myopia can be decreased by having young children spend more time outside. This decrease in risk may be related to natural light exposure. Myopia can be corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or by refractive surgery. Eyeglasses are the simplest and safest method of correction. Contact lenses can provide a relatively wider corrected field of vision, but are associated with an increased risk of infection. Refractive surgeries such as LASIK and PRK permanently change the shape of the cornea. Other procedures include implantable collamer lens (ICL) inside the anterior chamber in front of the natural eye lens. ICL doesn&#x27;t affect the cornea.
Myopia is the most common eye problem and is estimated to affect 1.5 billion people (22% of the world population). Rates vary significantly in different areas of the world. Rates among adults are between 15% and 49%. Among children, it affects 1% of rural Nepalese, 4% of South Africans, 12% of people in the US, and 37% in some large Chinese cities. In China the proportion of girls is slightly higher than boys. Rates have increased since the 1950s. Uncorrected myopia is one of the most common causes of vision impairment globally along with cataracts, macular degeneration, and vitamin A deficiency.
==Signs and symptoms==

A myopic individual can see clearly out to a certain distance (the far point of the eye), but objects placed beyond this distance appear blurred. If the extent of the myopia is great enough, even standard reading distances can be affected. Upon routine examination of the eyes, the vast majority of myopic eyes appear structurally identical to nonmyopic eyes.

Onset is often in school children, with worsening between the ages of 8 and 15.

Myopic individuals have larger pupils than far-sighted (hypermetropic) and emmetropic individuals, likely due to requiring less accommodation (which results in pupil constriction).

==Causes==
The underlying cause is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include doing work that involves focusing on close objects, greater time spent indoors, urbanization, and a family history of the condition. It is also associated with a high socioeconomic class and higher level of education.

A 2012 review could not find strong evidence for any single cause, although many theories have been discredited. Twin studies indicate that at least some genetic factors are involved. Myopia has been increasing rapidly throughout the developed world, suggesting environmental factors are involved.

A single-author literature review in 2021 proposed that myopia is the result of corrective lenses interfering with emmetropization.

===Genetics===
A risk for myopia may be inherited from one&#x27;s parents. Genetic linkage studies have identified 18 possible loci on 15 different chromosomes that are associated with myopia, but none of these loci is part of the candidate genes that cause myopia. Instead of a simple one-gene locus controlling the onset of myopia, a complex interaction of many mutated proteins acting in concert may be the cause. Instead of myopia being caused by a defect in a structural protein, defects in the control of these structural proteins might be the actual cause of myopia. A collaboration of all myopia studies worldwide identified 16 new loci for refractive error in individuals of European ancestry, of which 8 were shared with Asians. The new loci include candidate genes with functions in neurotransmission, ion transport, retinoic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling and eye development. The carriers of the high-risk genes have a tenfold increased risk of myopia. Aberrant genetic recombination and gene splicing in the OPNLW1 and OPNMW1 genes that code for two retinal cone photopigment proteins can produce high myopia by interfering with refractive development of the eye.

Human population studies suggest that contribution of genetic factors accounts for 60–90% of variance in refraction. However, the currently identified variants account for only a small fraction of myopia cases, suggesting the existence of a large number of yet unidentified low-frequency or small-effect variants, which underlie the majority of myopia cases.

===Environmental factors===
Environmental factors that increase the risk of myopia include insufficient light exposure, low physical activity, near work, and increased years of education.

One hypothesis is that a lack of normal visual stimuli causes improper development of the eyeball. Under this hypothesis, &quot;normal&quot; refers to the environmental stimuli that the eyeball evolved to. Modern humans who spend most of their time indoors, in dimly or fluorescently lit buildings may be at risk of development of myopia.

People, and children especially, who spend more time doing physical exercise and outdoor play, have lower rates of myopia, suggesting the increased magnitude and complexity of the visual stimuli encountered during these types of activities decrease myopic progression. There is preliminary evidence that the protective effect of outdoor activities on the development of myopia is due, at least in part, to the effect of long hours of exposure to daylight on the production and the release of retinal dopamine.

Myopia can be induced with minus spherical lenses, and overminus in prescription lenses can induce myopia progression. Overminus during refraction can be avoided through various techniques and tests, such as fogging, plus to blur, and the duochrome test.

The near work hypothesis, also referred to as the &quot;use-abuse theory&quot;, states that spending time involved in near work strains the intraocular and extraocular muscles. Some studies support the hypothesis, while other studies do not. While an association is present, it is not clearly causal.

Myopia is also more common in children with diabetes, childhood arthritis, uveitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

===Other factors===
Research indicates a relationship between body mass index (BMI) and myopia, with both low and high BMI associated with an increased risk of developing myopia. A nationwide study of 1.3 million Israeli adolescents found that individuals with underweight status had higher chances of mild-to-moderate and high myopia compared to those with low-normal BMI.

Similarly, a study involving Korean young adult men reported that those who were of average or shorter height and lean had a higher prevalence of high myopia.

==Mechanism==
Because myopia is a refractive error, the physical cause of myopia is comparable to any optical system that is out of focus. Borish and Duke-Elder classified myopia by these physical causes:
* Axial myopia is attributed to an increase in the eye&#x27;s axial length.
* Refractive myopia is attributed to the condition of the refractive elements of the eye. Borish further subclassified refractive myopia:
** Curvature myopia is attributed to excessive, or increased, curvature of one or more of the refractive surfaces of the eye, especially the cornea. In those with Cohen syndrome, myopia appears to result from high corneal and lenticular power.
** Index myopia is attributed to variation in the index of refraction of one or more of the ocular media.

As with any optical system experiencing a defocus aberration, the effect can be exaggerated or masked by changing the aperture size. In the case of the eye, a large pupil emphasizes refractive error and a small pupil masks it. This phenomenon can cause a condition in which an individual has a greater difficulty seeing in low-illumination areas, even though there are no symptoms in bright light, such as daylight.

Under rare conditions, edema of the ciliary body can cause an anterior displacement of the lens, inducing a myopia shift in refractive error.

==Diagnosis==
A diagnosis of myopia is typically made by an eye care professional, usually an optometrist or ophthalmologist. This is by refracting the eye with the use of cycloplegics such as atropine with responses recorded when accommodation is relaxed. Diagnosis of progressive myopia requires regular eye examination using the same method.

===Types===
Myopia can be classified into two major types; anatomical and clinical. The types of myopia based on anatomical features are axial, curvature, index and displacement of refractive element. Congenital, simple and pathological myopia are the clinical types of myopia.

Various forms of myopia have been described by their clinical appearance:
* Simple myopia: Myopia in an otherwise normal eye, typically less than 4.00 to 6.00 diopters. This is the most common form of myopia.
* Degenerative myopia, also known as malignant, pathological, or progressive myopia, is characterized by marked fundus changes, such as posterior staphyloma, and associated with a high refractive error and subnormal visual acuity after correction. This form of myopia gets progressively worse over time. Degenerative myopia has been reported as one of the main causes of visual impairment.
* Pseudomyopia is the blurring of distance vision brought about by spasm of the accommodation system.
* Nocturnal myopia: Without adequate stimulus for accurate accommodation, the accommodation system partially engages, pushing distance objects out of focus.
* Nearwork-induced transient myopia (NITM): short-term myopic far point shift immediately following a sustained near visual task. Some authors argue for a link between NITM and the development of permanent myopia.
* Instrument myopia: over-accommodation when looking into an instrument such as a microscope.
* Induced myopia, also known as acquired myopia, sometimes , results from various medications, increases in glucose levels, nuclear sclerosis, oxygen toxicity (e.g., from underwater diving or from oxygen and hyperbaric therapy) or other anomalous conditions. Sulphonamide therapy can cause ciliary body edema, resulting in anterior displacement of the lens, pushing the eye out of focus. Elevation of blood-glucose levels can also cause edema (swelling) of the crystalline lens as a result of sorbitol accumulating in the lens. This edema often causes temporary myopia. Scleral buckles, used in the repair of retinal detachments may induce myopia by increasing the axial length of the eye.
* Index myopia is attributed to variation in the index of refraction of one or more of the ocular media. Cataracts may lead to index myopia.
* Form deprivation myopia occurs when the eyesight is deprived by limited illumination and vision range, or the eye is modified with artificial lenses or deprived of clear form vision. In lower vertebrates, this kind of myopia seems to be reversible within short periods of time. Myopia is often induced this way in various animal models to study the pathogenesis and mechanism of myopia development.

===Degree===
The degree of myopia is described in terms of the power of the ideal correction, which is measured in diopters:
* Myopia between −0.00 and −0.50 diopters is usually classified as emmetropia.
* Low myopia usually describes myopia between −0.50 and −3.00 diopters.
* Moderate myopia usually describes myopia between −3.00 and −6.00 diopters. Those with moderate amounts of myopia are more likely to have pigment dispersion syndrome or pigmentary glaucoma.
* High myopia usually describes myopia of −6.00 or more. People with high myopia are more likely to have retinal detachments and primary open angle glaucoma. They are also more likely to experience floaters, shadow-like shapes which appear in the field of vision. In addition to this, high myopia is linked to macular degeneration, cataracts, and significant visual impairment.
The highest myopia ever recorded was -108 diopters by a Slovak, Jan Miskovic.

===Age at onset===
Myopia is sometimes classified by the age at onset:
* Congenital myopia, also known as infantile myopia, is present at birth and persists through infancy.
* Youth onset myopia occurs in early childhood or teenage, and the ocular power can keep varying until the age of 21, before which any form of corrective surgery is usually not recommended by ophthalmic specialists around the world.
* School myopia appears during childhood, particularly the school age years. This form of myopia is attributed to the use of the eyes for close work during the school years. A 2004–2015 Singapore–Sydney study of children of Chinese descent found that time spent on outdoor activities was a factor.
* Adult onset myopia

:* Early adult onset myopia occurs between ages 20 and 40.
:*Late adult onset myopia occurs after age 40.

==Prevention and control==
Various methods have been employed in an attempt to decrease the progression of myopia, although studies show mixed results. Many myopia treatment studies have a number of design drawbacks: small numbers, lack of adequate control group, and failure to mask examiners from knowledge of treatments used. The best approach is to combine multiple prevention and control methods. A test of repeated low-level red-light therapy (LLRL) on myopic Chinese children showed it to be a promising alternative treatment for myopia control in children.

=== Spending time outdoors ===
Some studies have indicated that having children spend time outdoors reduces the incidence of myopia. A 2017 study investigated the leading causal theory of association between greenspace exposure and spectacles use as a proxy for myopia, finding a 28% reduction in the likelihood of spectacles use per interquartile range increase in time spent in greenspace. In Taiwan, government policies that require schools to send all children outdoors for a minimum amount of time have driven down the prevalence of myopia in children.

=== Glasses and contacts ===
The use of reading glasses when doing close work may improve vision by reducing or eliminating the need to accommodate. Altering the use of eyeglasses between full-time, part-time, and not at all does not appear to alter myopia progression. The American Optometric Association&#x27;s Clinical Practice Guidelines found evidence of effectiveness of bifocal lenses and recommends it as the method for &quot;myopia control&quot;. In some studies, bifocal and progressive lenses have not shown differences in altering the progression of myopia compared to placebo.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved myopia control contact lenses such as CooperVision’s MiSight and Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision’s Acuvue Abiliti. Yet the agency has yet to approve any myopia control spectacle lenses.

===Medication===
Anti-muscarinic topical medications in children under 18 years of age may slow the worsening of myopia. These treatments include pirenzepine gel, cyclopentolate eye drops, and atropine eye drops. While these treatments were shown to be effective in slowing the progression of myopia and reducing eyeball elongation associated with the condition, side effects included light sensitivity and near blur.

=== Other methods ===
Scleral reinforcement surgery is aimed to cover the thinning posterior pole with a supportive material to withstand intraocular pressure and prevent further progression of the posterior staphyloma. The strain is reduced, although damage from the pathological process cannot be reversed. By stopping the progression of the disease, vision may be maintained or improved. The use of orthoK can also slow down axial lens elongation.

==Treatment==
The National Institutes of Health says there is no known way of preventing myopia, and the use of glasses or contact lenses does not affect its progression, unless the glasses or contact lenses are too strong of a prescription. There is no universally accepted method of preventing myopia and proposed methods need additional study to determine their effectiveness. Optical correction using glasses or contact lenses is the most common treatment; other approaches include orthokeratology, and refractive surgery. Medications (mostly atropine) and vision therapy can be effective in addressing the various forms of pseudomyopia. 

===Glasses and contacts===
Corrective lenses bend the light entering the eye in a way that places a focused image accurately onto the retina. The power of any lens system can be expressed in diopters, the reciprocal of its focal length in meters. Corrective lenses for myopia have negative powers because a divergent lens is required to move the far point of focus out to the distance. More severe myopia needs lens powers further from zero (more negative). However, strong eyeglass prescriptions create distortions such as prismatic movement and chromatic aberration. Strongly myopic wearers of contact lenses do not experience these distortions because the lens moves with the cornea, keeping the optic axis in line with the visual axis and because the vertex distance has been reduced to zero.

===Surgery===
Refractive surgery includes procedures which alter the corneal curvature of some structure of the eye or which add additional refractive means inside the eye.

====Photorefractive keratectomy====

Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) involves ablation of corneal tissue from the corneal surface using an excimer laser. The amount of tissue ablation corresponds to the amount of myopia. While PRK is a relatively safe procedure for up to 6 dioptres of myopia, the recovery phase post-surgery is usually painful.

====LASIK====
In a LASIK pre-procedure, a corneal flap is cut into the cornea and lifted to allow the excimer laser beam access to the exposed corneal tissue. After that, the excimer laser ablates the tissue according to the required correction. When the flap again covers the cornea, the change in curvature generated by the laser ablation proceeds to the corneal surface. Though LASIK is usually painless and involves a short rehabilitation period post-surgery, it can potentially result in flap complications and loss of corneal stability (post-LASIK keratectasia).

====Phakic intra-ocular lens====
Instead of modifying the corneal surface, as in laser vision correction (LVC), this procedure involves implanting an additional lens inside the eye (i.e., in addition to the already existing natural lens). While it usually results in good control of the refractive change, it can induce potential serious long-term complications such as glaucoma, cataract and endothelial decompensation.

===Orthokeratology===

Orthokeratology or simply Ortho-K is a temporary corneal reshaping process using rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses. Overnight wearing of specially designed contact lenses will temporarily reshape cornea, so patients may see clearly without any lenses in daytime. Orthokeratology can correct myopia up to –6D. Several studies shown that Ortho-K can reduce myopia progression also. Risk factors of using Ortho-K lenses include microbial keratitis, corneal edema, etc. Other contact lens related complications such as corneal aberration, photophobia, pain, irritation, redness etc. are usually temporary conditions, which may be eliminated by proper usage of lenses.

===Intrastromal corneal ring segment===
The Intrastromal corneal ring segment (ICRS), commonly used in keratoconus treatment now, was originally designed to correct mild to moderate myopia. The thickness is directly related to flattening and the diameter of the ring is proportionally inverse to the flattening of cornea. So, if diameter is smaller or thickness is greater, resulting myopia correction will be greater.

===Alternative medicine===
A number of alternative therapies have been claimed to improve myopia, including vision therapy, &quot;behavioural optometry&quot;, various eye exercises and relaxation techniques, and the Bates method. Scientific reviews have concluded that there was &quot;no clear scientific evidence&quot; that eye exercises are effective in treating myopia and as such they &quot;cannot be advocated&quot;.

==Epidemiology==
Global refractive errors have been estimated to affect 800 million to 2.3 billion. The incidence of myopia within sampled population often varies with age, country, sex, race, ethnicity, occupation, environment, and other factors. Variability in testing and data collection methods makes comparisons of prevalence and progression difficult.

The prevalence of myopia has been reported as high as 70–90% in some Asian countries, 30–40% in Europe and the United States, and 10–20% in Africa. Myopia is about twice as common in Jewish people than in people of non-Jewish ethnicity. Myopia is less common in African people and associated diaspora. In Americans between the ages of 12 and 54, myopia has been found to affect African Americans less than Caucasians.

A 2024 study published in the &quot;British Journal of Ophthalmology&quot; revealed that more than one-third of children worldwide were nearsighted in 2023, with this figure projected to rise to nearly 40% by 2050. The prevalence of myopia among children and adolescents has increased significantly over the past 30 years, rising from 24% in 1990 to almost 36% in 2023, with researchers noting a sharp spike in cases following the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighting regional differences in myopia rates.

A 2025 South Korean analysis of 45 studies, involving 335,524 participants and largely based on data from children, adolescents and young adults, that looked at the use of digital screen devices such as mobile phones, game consoles and television, revealed that an additional hour of daily screen time is, on average, associated with 21% higher odds of having myopia.

===Asia===

In some parts of Asia, myopia is very common.
* Singapore is believed to have the highest prevalence of myopia in the world; up to 80% of people there have myopia, but the accurate figure is unknown.
* China&#x27;s myopia rate is 31%: 400 million of its 1.3 billion people are myopic. The prevalence of myopia in high school in China is 77%, and in college is more than 80%.
* In some areas, such as China and Malaysia, up to 41% of the adult population is myopic to 1.00 dpt, and up to 80% to 0.5 dpt.
* A study of Jordanian adults aged 17 to 40 found more than half (54%) were myopic.
* A study indicated that the prevalence of myopia among urban children in India of aged 5 to 15 increased from 4.44% in 1999 to 21.15% in 2019. Projections suggest that by 2050, this figure could reach 48.14%. 
* Some research suggests the prevalence of myopia in Indian children is less than 15%. 
* In South Korea among the general population, national data indicates that 70.6% of the adult population has myopia, with 8.0% affected by high myopia. The prevalence decreases with age, from 81.3% in individuals aged 19 to 24 years to 55.2% in those aged 45 to 49 years.

===Europe===

* In first-year undergraduate students in the United Kingdom 50% of British whites and 53% of British Asians were myopic.
* A recent review found 27% of Western Europeans aged 40 or older have at least −1.00 diopters of myopia and 5% have at least −5.00 diopters.

===North America===
Myopia is common in the United States, with research suggesting this condition has increased dramatically in recent decades. In 1971–1972, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey provided the earliest nationally representative estimates for myopia prevalence in the U.S., and found the prevalence in persons aged 12–54 was 25%. Using the same method, in 1999–2004, myopia prevalence was estimated to have climbed to 42%.

A study of 2,523 children in grades 1 to 8 (age, 5–17 years) found nearly one in 10 (9%) have at least −0.75 diopters of myopia. In this study, 13% had at least +1.25 D hyperopia (farsightedness), and 28% had at least 1.00-D difference between the two principal meridians (cycloplegic autorefraction) of astigmatism. For myopia, Asians had the highest prevalence (19%), followed by Hispanics (13%). Caucasian children had the lowest prevalence of myopia (4%), which was not significantly different from African Americans (7%).

A recent review found 25% of Americans aged 40 or older have at least −1.00 diopters of myopia and 5% have at least −5.00 diopters.

===Australia===
In Australia, the overall prevalence of myopia (worse than −0.50 diopters) has been estimated to be 17%. In one recent study, less than one in 10 (8%) Australian children between the ages of four and 12 were found to have myopia greater than −0.50 diopters. A recent review found 16% of Australians aged 40 or older have at least −1.00 diopters of myopia and 3% have at least −5.00 diopters.

===South America===
In Brazil, a 2005 study estimated 6% of Brazilians between the ages of 12 and 59 had −1.00 diopter of myopia or more, compared with 3% of the indigenous people in northwestern Brazil. Another found nearly 1 in 8 (13%) of the students in the city of Natal were myopic.

==History==
The difference between the near-sighted and far-sighted people was noted already by Aristotle. Graeco-Roman physician Galen first used the term &quot;myopia&quot; (from Greek words &quot;myein&quot; meaning &quot;to close or shut&quot; and &quot;ops&quot; (gen. opos) meaning &quot;eye&quot;) for near-sightedness. The first spectacles for correcting myopia were invented by a German cardinal in the year 1451. Johannes Kepler in his &quot;Clarification of Ophthalmic Dioptrics&quot; (1604) first demonstrated that myopia was due to the incident light focusing in front of the retina. Kepler also showed that myopia could be corrected by concave lenses. In 1632, Vopiscus Fortunatus Plempius examined a myopic eye and confirmed that myopia was due to a lengthening of its axial diameter.

The idea that myopia was caused by the eye strain involved in reading or doing other work close to the eyes was a consistent theme for several centuries. In Taiwan, faced with a staggering rise in the number of young military recruits needing glasses, the schools were told to give students&#x27; eyes a 10-minute break after every half-hour of reading; however, the rate of myopia continued to climb. The policy that reversed the epidemic of myopia was the government ordering all schools to have the children outside for a minimum of 80 minutes every day.

== Society and culture ==
The terms &quot;myopia&quot; and &quot;myopic&quot; (or the common terms &quot;short-sightedness&quot; or &quot;short-sighted&quot;, respectively) have been used metaphorically to refer to cognitive thinking and decision making that is narrow in scope or lacking in foresight or in concern for wider interests or for longer-term consequences. It is often used to describe a decision that may be beneficial in the present, but detrimental in the future, or a viewpoint that fails to consider anything outside a very narrow and limited range. Hyperopia, the biological opposite of myopia, may also be used metaphorically for a value system or motivation that exhibits &quot;farsighted&quot; or possibly visionary thinking and behavior; that is, emphasizing long-term interests at the apparent expense of near-term benefit.

Keeping children indoors, whether to promote early academic activities, because urban development choices leave no place for children to play outside, or because people avoid sunlight because of a preference for lighter skin color, causes myopia. Taiwan has developed an aggressive program to identify pre-school-age children with pre-myopia and treat them with atropine, and to have schools send students outdoors every day. The &quot;Tian-tian 120&quot; program (&quot;Every day 120&quot;) encourages 120 minutes of outdoor time each day. Compared to the cost of lifelong treatment for myopia with glasses, and in some cases, preventable blindness, the US$13 spent on screening young children for pre-myopia is considered a good investment in public health.

Because myopia can be mitigated through lifestyle choices, it is possible that being myopic will become a marker of an impoverished or neglected childhood, with wealthy families ensuring that their children spend enough time outdoors to prevent or at least reduce it, and poor families, who rely on lower-quality childcare arrangements or not having access to a safe outdoor space, being unable to provide the same benefits to their children.

===Correlations===
Numerous studies have found correlations between myopia, on the one hand, and intelligence and academic achievement, on the other; it is not clear whether there is a causal relationship. Myopia is also correlated with increased microsaccade amplitude, suggesting that blurred vision from myopia might cause instability in fixational eye movements.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;myopia&quot; is of Koine Greek origin: and () . It is derived from the ancient Greek () (man), from () and () ( ()). The opposite of &quot;myopia&quot; in English is &quot;hypermetropia&quot;, or far-sightedness.

<text>Claudia Maria Schiffer (; born 25 August 1970) is a German model and actress based in England. She rose to fame in the 1990s as one of the world&#x27;s most successful models, attaining supermodel status.

Born in Rheinberg, Germany, she initially aspired to join the legal profession, but her life took a turn when she was discovered at 17 in a Düsseldorf nightclub by Michel Levaton, the CEO of Metropolitan Models. This discovery led her to Paris and onto the cover of &quot;Elle&quot;, marking the start of her modeling career.

Schiffer&#x27;s breakthrough came with Guess? campaigns in 1989, elevating the brand and her career. Notably resembling Brigitte Bardot in her early career, she became Chanel&#x27;s new face in 1990, walking in Karl Lagerfeld&#x27;s fashion show. Her striking looks and appeal garnered international success, making her a fixture on magazine covers across &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;, among others. Schiffer appeared on over 1,000 magazine covers and walked for high-profile fashion houses, boasting a runway fee of $20,000 per show in 1992. She holds the record for model with the most covers, listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. Her endorsements span luxury and high street brands, including Chanel, Versace, and Mango. Beyond modeling, Schiffer ventured into acting, with roles in films like &quot;Richie Rich&quot; and &quot;Love Actually&quot;, and engaged in charity work with UNICEF and Make Poverty History. She launched her own cashmere collection in 2011. In 2023, her net worth was estimated at US$70 million.

Schiffer&#x27;s personal life attracted significant attention, including her engagement to magician David Copperfield, followed by high-profile relationships and her marriage to film director Matthew Vaughn in 2002. The couple owns several properties, including the Tudor manor house, Coldham Hall in Suffolk.

== Early life ==
Claudia Maria Schiffer was born in Rheinberg, a small town northwest of Duisburg, on 25 August 1970, to mother Gudrun and father Heinz Schiffer (1937–2007), a lawyer. She has two brothers, Stefan and Andreas, and one sister, Ann Carolin (born 1975). Schiffer is fluent in three languages – German, English and French.

== Career ==

=== Modelling ===

Schiffer originally aspired to become a lawyer and used to work in her father&#x27;s law firm. In October 1987, at age 17, she was scouted in a nightclub in Düsseldorf by Michel Levaton, the founder and CEO of the French modeling agency &quot;Metropolitan Models&quot;, and was later signed to the agency as a model. After leaving high school, Schiffer flew to Paris for a trial photo shoot, and subsequently appeared on the cover of &quot;Elle&quot;.

In 1989, she starred in campaigns for Guess?. Early on in her career, Schiffer was said to resemble Brigitte Bardot. After several other magazine appearances including the cover of British &quot;Vogue&quot;, shot by Herb Ritts, Schiffer was selected by Karl Lagerfeld to become the new face of Chanel, where she walked in her first fashion show in January 1990.

In addition to &quot;Elle&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot;, Schiffer has appeared on the covers of numerous other magazines including &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot;, and was the first model to be featured on the covers of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;People&quot;. She was one of 10 models on &quot;Vogue&quot;″s 100th anniversary cover in 1992. In May 1997, Schiffer was featured on the cover and in the pictorial of &quot;Playboy&quot;. She has appeared on a total of more than 1,000 magazine covers.

Schiffer has walked in fashion shows for various fashion houses, including Versace, Karl Lagerfeld, Chloé, Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Dior, Fendi, Michael Kors, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Ralph Lauren, Balmain, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Anna Sui, Oscar de la Renta, Jil Sander, Donna Karan, Helmut Lang, Thierry Mugler, Chanel and Valentino. In 1992, she was earning a runway fee of $20,000 per show.

She has appeared in advertising campaigns for Chanel, Versace, Balmain, Giorgio Armani, Karl Lagerfeld, Dom Pérignon, Alberta Ferretti, Bulgari, Chloé, Escada, Blumarine, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Fendi, Max Mara, Louis Vuitton, Michael Kors, Oscar de la Renta, Ralph Lauren, Emporio Armani, Liz Claiborne, Prada, Yves Saint Laurent, Marc Jacobs, Guess?, Salvatore Ferragamo, Neiman Marcus, Gap, Dillard&#x27;s, Saks Fifth Avenue, Revlon, Intergaz and Pepsi. In 1994, she starred in a campaign for Valentino, photographed by Arthur Elgort in Rome, which was inspired by the film &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;. In 1997, Schiffer signed an exclusive worldwide contract with L&#x27;Oréal. Schiffer still holds a contract with L&#x27;Oréal and is one of their longest standing ambassadors.

As well as endorsing luxury brands, Schiffer has appeared as the face of high street retailers including Mango and Accessorize, and had her ears pierced for the first time specially for the 2006 Autumn/Winter Accessorize campaign. From her appearances in a 1998 Citroën advertisement she allegedly earned £3 million.

Schiffer was a judge on &quot;Fashion Fringe&quot; in 2011. In 2012, she posed for Guess? again, marking the brand&#x27;s 30th anniversary. She made her runway return in September 2023, closing out Versace&#x27;s Spring 2024 show at Milan Fashion Week.

=== Acting and media ===
Schiffer made her film debut in the children&#x27;s movie &quot;Richie Rich&quot; (1994, as the title character&#x27;s personal fitness trainer). She then starred opposite Dennis Hopper and Matthew Modine in &quot;The Blackout&quot; (1997). She then went on to appear in &quot;Friends &amp; Lovers&quot;, &quot;Black and White&quot; (both 1999), &quot;In Pursuit&quot;, &quot;Life Without Dick&quot; (both 2001), and &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003) in a semi-cameo role. Films in which Schiffer has made cameo appearances include Ben Stiller&#x27;s &quot;Zoolander&quot; (2001).

Schiffer has appeared on several talk shows such as &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, &quot;The Jonathan Ross Show&quot;, and sitcoms &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot; and &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. She made a cameo appearance in the music video for Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;Say It Isn&#x27;t So&quot; in 2000, and appeared in the music video for &quot;Comic Relief&quot;&#x27;s 2001 charity single, Westlife&#x27;s &quot;Uptown Girl&quot;.

=== Charity work ===
Schiffer began her involvement with UNICEF by becoming a member of the Arts &amp; Entertainment Support Committee, and is currently a UK Goodwill Ambassador for the organisation. Schiffer was also a spokeswoman for Make Poverty History, and appeared in their &quot;Click&quot; campaign. In July 2005, she appeared as a presenter at both the Berlin and Edinburgh Live 8 concerts.

=== Other work ===
Schiffer has released four exercise videos, entitled &quot;Claudia Schiffer&#x27;s Perfectly Fit&quot;, which reached the best seller list. Starting in 1992, Schiffer was the star of her own line of annual calendars. Her initial 1992 calendar sold more than 300,000 copies. Schiffer has hosted the French Fashion Awards, and also the 1995 World Music Awards in Monaco.

Along with fellow models Christy Turlington, Naomi Campbell, and Elle Macpherson, Schiffer was joint owner of a chain of restaurants called the Fashion Café in 1995. Schiffer helped present and carry the trophy with Pelé during the opening ceremonies at the 2006 World Cup. She also presented Prince William with a polo trophy in 2002.

Schiffer launched her eponymous cashmere collection during Paris Fashion Week in March 2011.

== Personal life ==

In 1993, at a Berlin celebrity gala, Schiffer met the American magician David Copperfield when he brought her on stage to participate in a mind reading act and in his flying illusion, and they became engaged in January 1994. During this engagement, Schiffer sometimes appeared on stage with Copperfield to act as his special guest assistant in illusions including being levitated, guillotined, and sawn in half. She also appeared alongside Copperfield in &quot;David Copperfield: 15 Years of Magic&quot;, a 1994 documentary in which she played the role of a reporter interviewing him, and at the end of which they reprised their performance of the flying illusion. In September 1999, they announced they had ended their relationship, citing work schedules.

In 1997, Copperfield and Schiffer both sued &quot;Paris Match&quot; after the magazine claimed their relationship was a sham, that Schiffer &quot;[was] paid for pretending to be Copperfield&#x27;s fiancée and [didn&#x27;t] even like him&quot;. In 1999, Schiffer won an undisclosed sum and a retraction from &quot;Paris Match&quot; when a French court ruled that the magazine&#x27;s story was false. Copperfield&#x27;s publicist confirmed that while Schiffer had a contract to appear in the audience at Copperfield&#x27;s show in Berlin where they met, she was not under contract to be his &quot;consort&quot;.

Following her break-up with Copperfield, Schiffer had a short relationship with art dealer and Green Shield Stamps heir Tim Jefferies until 2000. On 25 May 2002, she married English film director Matthew Vaughn in Suffolk. Schiffer and Vaughn have a son and two daughters.

Schiffer and Vaughn bought Coldham Hall, a Tudor manor house in Suffolk, in 2002. The couple has homes in Notting Hill, London, Northamptonshire and Coldham Hall, Stanningfield, Suffolk.

In 2002 an Italian kitchen porter was arrested after making nine visits to Coldham Hall; he was subsequently sectioned under the Mental Health Act. In 2004, a Canadian man was accused of harassing Schiffer, repeatedly leaving letters at her Suffolk residence.

The Pandora Papers list Schiffer as one of many celebrities who have used offshore financial constructs.

<text>Carl Michael Yastrzemski Sr. ( ; born August 22, 1939), nicknamed &quot;Yaz&quot;, is an American former professional baseball player who played his entire career with the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). He started his career primarily as a left fielder, but also played 33 games as a third baseman. Later in his career, he was mainly a first baseman and designated hitter.

Yastrzemski is an 18-time All-Star, the possessor of seven Gold Gloves, a member of the 3,000 hit club, and the first American League player in that club to also accumulate over 400 home runs. He is second on the all-time list for games played, and third for total at-bats. He is the Red Sox&#x27;s all-time leader in career RBIs, runs, hits, singles, doubles, total bases, and games played, and is third on the team list for home runs, behind Ted Williams and David Ortiz. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989 in his first year of eligibility.

In Yastrzemski achieved a peak in his career, leading the Red Sox to the American League pennant for the first time in over two decades and being voted the 1967 American League MVP. Yastrzemski also won the Triple Crown that year, something not accomplished again in the Major Leagues until Miguel Cabrera did so in 2012.

==Early life==
Yastrzemski was born in Southampton, New York, to Karol Yastrzemski (anglicized to Carl) and Hattie Skonieczny. Both his parents were of a Polish background, and young Carl was bilingual from an early age. Raised on his father&#x27;s potato farm, Carl played on sandlot baseball teams with his father, who, he maintains, was a better athlete than he was. He graduated in 1957 from Bridgehampton School. Yastrzemski also played Little League Baseball, and became the first Little League player to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He attended Notre Dame on a basketball scholarship (his career Long Island high school scoring mark at Bridgehampton broke one previously held by Jim Brown) briefly before embarking on his baseball career.

Yastrzemski signed with the Red Sox organization, which sent him to the minor-league Raleigh Capitals in , where he led the league with a .377 batting average. The organization moved him to the Minneapolis Millers for that post-season and the season. Yastrzemski, who had studied business at Notre Dame, fulfilled a promise to his parents by finishing his degree at Merrimack College in North Andover, Massachusetts, in 1966.

==Major League career==

===Early career===
Yastrzemski began his major-league career in and hit his first home run off of former Red Sox pitcher Jerry Casale. From the beginning, there was tremendous pressure on him to perform as he succeeded to the position of the great Red Sox legend Ted Williams. He proved to be a worthy successor at the plate and a far superior defensive player with a strong arm, expert in playing off the Green Monster, Fenway Park&#x27;s left-field wall. In 12 years as a left fielder, Yastrzemski won seven Gold Gloves and led the team in assists seven times.

While his first two years were viewed as solid but unspectacular, he emerged as a rising star in , winning the American League batting championship with a batting average of .321, and also leading the league in doubles and walks, finishing sixth in the Most Valuable Player voting.

===1967===
Yastrzemski enjoyed his best season in , when he won the American League Triple Crown with a .326 batting average, 44 home runs (tied with Harmon Killebrew), and 121 RBIs. Yastrzemski&#x27;s Triple Crown win in 1967 was the last time a major league hitter won the Batting Triple Crown until Miguel Cabrera in the 2012 season (conversely, six different pitchers have since won the pitchers&#x27; version). He was voted Most Valuable Player almost unanimously (one voter chose César Tovar of the Twins). His 12.4 WAR was the highest since Babe Ruth&#x27;s 1927 season.

1967 was the season of the &quot;Impossible Dream&quot; for the Red Sox (referring to the hit song from the musical &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;), who rebounded from a ninth-place finish a year before to win the American League pennant (their first since ) on the last day of the season. With the Red Sox battling as part of a four-team pennant race, Yastrzemski hit .513 (23 hits in 44 at-bats) with five home runs and 16 runs batted in over the last two weeks of the season, and finished a mere one game ahead of the Detroit Tigers and Minnesota Twins. The Red Sox went into the final two games of the season trailing the Twins by one game and leading the Tigers by one-half game. Their final two games were against Minnesota with the pennant and home run title (hence, the triple crown) on the line. In the Saturday game, Yastrzemski went 3 for 4 with a home run and 4 RBI. Killebrew also homered, but the Red Sox won, 6–4. Thus the teams went into the final game tied for first place, and Yastrzemski and Killebrew were tied with 44 home runs apiece. In the final game, neither player homered, but Yastrzemski went 4 for 4 with 2 RBI in a 5-3 Red Sox win. In the two games with the pennant on the line, Yastrzemski was 7 for 8 with six RBIs.

The Red Sox lost the World Series four games to three to the St. Louis Cardinals, losing three times to Bob Gibson. Yastrzemski batted .400 with 3 home runs and 5 RBI in the series. That season, he also won the Hickok Belt as top professional athlete of the year and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; Award.

In an article he co-wrote for the November 1967 issue of &quot;SPORT&quot; magazine, Yastrzemski credited Boston&#x27;s remarkable season to manager Dick Williams and an infusion of youth, including Rico Petrocelli and Tony Conigliaro. Of Williams, Yastrzemski wrote: &quot;He got rid of all the individuality, made us into a team, gave us an incentive, and made us want to win.&quot;

===Later career===

In Yastrzemski again won the batting championship. Because of the competitive advantages pitchers enjoyed between 1963 and 1968 (before the lowering of the pitcher&#x27;s mound following the 1968 season), Yastrzemski&#x27;s .301 mark in &quot;The Year of the Pitcher&quot; is the lowest average of any batting champion in major league history; he was the only hitter in the American League to hit .300 that season against such formidable pitching, and led the league in on-base percentage and walks.

In , Yastrzemski had the first of two consecutive 40-home run seasons as he led the Red Sox to third-place finishes that year and the next. In the All-Star Game he got four hits, tying the record, and was named the game MVP in a losing effort. He is one of two players to win the All-Star Game MVP Award despite playing for the losing team, Brooks Robinson having done so in 1966. Yastrzemski&#x27;s .329 batting average that season was his career high, but he finished second behind the California Angels&#x27; Alex Johnson for the batting title by less than .001. In 1970, Yastrzemski led the league in slugging and on-base percentage, finishing third in home runs. In the early 1970s, Yastrzemski suffered hand injuries that drastically reduced his power and productivity until healed. He also suffered a permanent shoulder injury that reduced his power, causing him to change his distinctive batting stance. Although he hit but 61 home runs over the next four years (1971–1974) as the Red Sox finished second twice and third twice, he finished in the top 10 in batting, and top three in on-base percentage and walks in 1973 and 1974, and led the league in runs scored in 1974.
In the 1975 All-Star Game, Yastrzemski was called to pinch-hit in the sixth inning, with two men on base and the American League down 3–0. Without wearing a batting helmet, he hit Tom Seaver&#x27;s first pitch for a home run to tie the score. The three-run homer was the only scoring the American League did that night as they lost 6–3.

Yastrzemski and the Red Sox suffered another World Series loss in , losing four games to three to the Cincinnati Reds. He made the final out in Game 7 on a fly out to center, trailing by one run. Coincidentally, he also made the final out of the 1978 American League East tie-breaker game with a foul pop to third base. This game featured Bucky Dent&#x27;s famous homer (although Reggie Jackson&#x27;s was the eventual winning run). Earlier in the game, Yastrzemski began the scoring with a home run off left-handed pitcher Ron Guidry, who was having a career year (25 wins, 3 losses and a 1.74 ERA). It was the only homer the Cy Young Award winner allowed to a left-hander all season.

On May 19, 1976, Yastrzemski hit three home runs against the Detroit Tigers at Tiger Stadium. He then went to Yankee Stadium and hit two more, tying the major league record of five home runs in two consecutive games.
In 1978 Yastrzemski, then 39, was one of the five oldest players in the league. On September 12, 1979, Yastrzemski achieved another milestone, becoming the first American League player with 3,000 career hits and 400 home runs. In 1982, playing primarily as a designated hitter, an early season hitting streak placed him among the league&#x27;s leading hitters and saw him featured on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and played in that year&#x27;s All-Star game.

===Retirement===

Yastrzemski retired at the end of the 1983 season at age 44, though he wrote in his autobiography &quot;Yaz&quot; that he was planning on playing the 1984 season until he was tired from a long midseason slump. He also said that had he known how good Roger Clemens would be, he would have played in 1984 to have had a chance to play with him.

No player has had a longer career with only one team, 23 seasons, a record he shares with Brooks Robinson of the Baltimore Orioles. His final career statistics include 3,308 games played (second all-time and the most with a single team), 3,419 hits, 646 doubles, 452 home runs, 1,844 RBIs, and a batting average of .285. He had 1,845 walks in his career, and 1,157 extra base hits. Yastrzemski was the first player to collect over 3,000 hits and 400 home runs solely in the American League (the feat has since been accomplished by Cal Ripken Jr.). He was named to the All-Star Game 18 times. Yastrzemski won three American League batting championships in his career. In addition, he trails only Ty Cobb and Derek Jeter in hits collected with a single team, and trails only Cobb, Jeter and Tris Speaker in hits collected playing in the American League. Yastrzemski is also Fenway Park&#x27;s all-time leader in hits, doubles, and RBIs. By the time of his retirement, he was the all-time leader in plate appearances, since surpassed by Pete Rose.
As one of the top players of his era, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989, his first year of eligibility, with the support of 94% of voters. He is one of the few Hall of Famers to directly succeed another Hall of Famer at the same position. For his entire career with the Red Sox, he wore uniform number 8. The Red Sox retired this number on August 6, 1989, after Yastrzemski was elected to the Hall of Fame. In 1999, Yastrzemski ranked 72nd on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. That same season, he was named a finalist to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Prior to his induction in the Baseball Hall of Fame, in 1986, Yastrzemski was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Baseball Category with the Class of 1990.

Yastrzemski was well known for his batting stance, holding his bat exceptionally high, giving his swing a large, dramatic arc (unexpectedly so for a well-known &quot;fastball hitter&quot;), and more power at the plate. In his later years, he adjusted his stance and held the bat lower. In his autobiography, Yastrzemski revealed that he played his last eight years with a damaged left shoulder he kept secret, and said this injury reduced his home run power. Before that, he could hit home runs to all fields, but afterward, his home run power was mainly in pulling the ball. This is why Yastrzemski no longer held the bat high and used several batting stances to adjust to the injured shoulder. He explained that with each new stance, he had to change the way he swung. This is why Yastrzemski never came close to hitting 40 home runs again. He was also known for modifying his batting helmets by enlarging the right earhole (for comfort) and removing part of the right earflap (for better vision of the ball as it was being pitched).

&quot;Yaz&quot; stood out for his cagey approach to the game. He decoyed opposing baserunners with his left-field play. On fly balls headed for Fenway&#x27;s Wall, Yastrzemski lined up as if about to make the catch just in front of the wall, waiting until the last possible moment before wheeling around to play the carom. This would fool baserunners into tagging up for precious extra seconds, preventing them from taking an extra base, and if they tried anyway, his deft handling of the bounce and accurate throwing arm were liable to make them pay the price. Once while running the basepaths himself, Yastrzemski found a unique way to induce a throwing error. Thrown out at second base, he failed to head immediately for the dugout, as is customary. Opponents made a protracted attempt at tagging out another runner in a rundown or &quot;pickle&quot;, but soon were flabbergasted to see a Red Sox player rounding third and heading for home. A panicked throw to the catcher far missed the mark, allowing Yastrzemski to appear to score, but more importantly, allowing the runner behind him to advance.

A record album of the 1967 Red Sox season, aptly titled &quot;The Impossible Dream&quot;, featured a song by DJ Jess Cain of praise for &quot;The man they call Yaz&quot;, which included the line &quot;Although &#x27;Yastrzemski&#x27; is a lengthy name / It fits quite nicely in our Hall of Fame.&quot; The song can be heard, and the album cover seen, in the apartment of Ben Wrightman (played by Jimmy Fallon) in the 2005 film &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;. Earlier in the film, Ben&#x27;s girlfriend, Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore), not yet familiar with the triumphs and tribulations of the Red Sox, is unable to properly pronounce Yastrzemski&#x27;s name, and has to be corrected by the surrounding fans: &quot;Ya-STREM-ski!&quot; The final scene of the movie indicates that if the couple&#x27;s unborn child is a girl she will be named &quot;Carla Yastrzemski Wrightman&quot;.

Yastrzemski thought that Tommy John was one of the hardest pitchers for him to hit against. This surprised John, who remembered Yastrzemski hitting him well while he was with the White Sox (1965-71). John concluded that Yastrzemski must be remembering his years with the Yankees beginning in 1979, when John fared better in their matchups.

Along with Johnny Pesky, Yastrzemski raised the 2004 World Series championship banner over Fenway Park. He is currently a roving instructor with the Red Sox, and was honored by throwing out the ceremonial first pitch for Game 1 of the 2004, 2007, 2013, and 2018 World Series. In August 2008, Yastrzemski underwent successful triple bypass heart surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital. The Red Sox honored him with a statue outside Fenway Park on September 23, 2013.

==Family==
His son Carl Michael Yastrzemski Jr., known as Mike, played college baseball for the Florida State Seminoles and was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the third round in 1984. He started his professional career with the Durham Bulls and eventually played for two Chicago White Sox affiliated teams in the Triple-A Pacific Coast League, first with the Hawaii Islanders in 1987 and then ending his playing career with the Vancouver Canadians in 1988. He died in 2004 at age 43 from a blood clot after having hip surgery.

Carl&#x27;s grandson Mike Yastrzemski, Carl Jr.&#x27;s son, was drafted by the Red Sox in 2009 and the Seattle Mariners in 2012. However, he did not sign with either team, as he played college baseball for the Vanderbilt Commodores. He signed with the Baltimore Orioles after being selected in the 2013 MLB draft. He rose through Baltimore&#x27;s farm system, reaching Triple-A with the Norfolk Tides by 2016. In March 2019, he was traded to the San Francisco Giants organization, and he made his MLB debut with the Giants on May 25, 2019. On September 17, as a member of the Giants, in his first game played at Fenway Park, Mike went 2-for-7 with a home run and a double. In the next game of the series on September 18, Carl threw out the ceremonial first pitch to Mike.

==Career regular season statistics==
Through the end of the 2017 season, on the all-time lists for Major League Baseball, Yastrzemski ranks first for games played for one team, second for games played, third for at-bats, sixth for bases on balls, eighth for doubles, ninth for hits, ninth for total bases, 13th for extra-base hits, and 14th for RBIs.

<doc id="88051" wikidata="Q3290131" url="?curid=88051" title="The Gong Show">
<text>The Gong Show is an American amateur talent contest franchised by Sony Pictures Television to many countries. It was broadcast on NBC&#x27;s daytime schedule from June 14, 1976, through July 21, 1978, and in first-run syndication from 1976 to 1980 and 1988 to 1989, and was revived in 2017 for broadcast on ABC. The show was created and originally produced by Chuck Barris, who also served as host for the NBC run and from 1977 to 1980 in syndication. Its most recent version was executive-produced by Will Arnett and hosted by Tommy Maitland, a fictional character performed by Mike Myers (uncredited in Season 1). &quot;The Gong Show&quot; is known for its absurdist humor and style, with the actual competition secondary to the often outlandish acts presented; a small cash prize has typically been awarded to each show&#x27;s winner.

==Format==
Each show presented a competition of amateur performers of often dubious talent, with a panel of three celebrity judges. If any judge considered an act to be particularly bad, they could force it to stop by striking a large gong, a trope adapted from the durable radio show &quot;Major Bowes Amateur Hour&quot;. The host would then ask the judges in question why they had gonged the act, usually receiving a facetious response.

Any act that survived without being gonged was given a score by each of the three judges on a scale of 0 to 10, for a maximum possible score of 30. On the NBC series, the contestant who achieved the highest combined score won the grand prize: a check for $516.32 (a &quot;highly unusual amount&quot;, in Barris&#x27;s words; reportedly the Screen Actors Guild&#x27;s minimum pay for a day&#x27;s work at the time) and a &quot;Golden Gong&quot; trophy. In the show&#x27;s opening monologue, Barris would describe the amount as &quot;five hundred and sixteen big ones, and thirty-two little ones&quot;. The syndicated series&#x27; top prize was originally $712.05 (the first episode was $996.83) and later increased to $716.32. In the event of a tie, three different tiebreakers were used at various times during the show&#x27;s run. Originally the studio audience determined the winner by applause, but this was later changed to a decision by the producers, and later by the celebrity judges. On a few, rare occasions, both winning acts each received a check and a trophy. No prize was awarded if all of the acts on a particular episode were gonged, which occurred at least twice. Runners-up received various prizes; Maureen Orth, on her February 24, 1977, appearance, reported receiving a clothes iron valued at $33.95 for her second-place finish.

The original program&#x27;s regular judges included Jamie Farr, Jaye P. Morgan, Arte Johnson, Patty Andrews, Steve Garvey, Anson Williams, Rex Reed, Pat McCormick, Rip Taylor, Phyllis Diller, Charlie Brill, Mitzi McCall and Wayland Flowers. Throughout the program&#x27;s run, several other celebrities occasionally appeared as judges including David Letterman, Steve Martin, Mort Sahl, Pat Paulsen, Chuck Woolery, Allen Ludden and Sandy Duncan.

When Barris announced the final score, little person actor Jerry Maren (a former Munchkin) ran onstage in top hat and tails, throwing confetti while balloons dropped from overhead.

The daily &quot;Gong Show&quot; also gave out a &quot;Worst Act of the Week&quot; award (later changed to the &quot;Most Outrageous Act of the Week&quot;), selected by the producers and each week&#x27;s judges. The winner of this award was announced following the trophy presentation on the Friday show, and the performer received a dirty tube sock and a check for $516.32.

===Legitimate talent===
The two biggest &quot;Gong Show&quot;-related showbiz successes were Andrea McArdle and Cheryl Lynn. Twelve-year-old McArdle appeared on an early episode in 1976, shortly before she won the leading role in the hit Broadway musical &quot;Annie&quot;. Following Lynn&#x27;s &quot;Gong Show&quot; appearance in 1976, she received a recording contract with Columbia Records and recorded the Top 40 disco hit &quot;Got To Be Real&quot;, released in 1978.

Among the other true talents that appeared on the show were country singer Boxcar Willie; actor Kevin Peter Hall who later appeared as the original &quot;Predator&quot; in the 1987 film and as Harry in &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot;; comics and actors Paul Reubens and John Paragon (best known as Pee Wee Herman and Jambi the Genie); Joey D&#x27;Auria (&quot;Dr. Flameo&quot;, later WGN&#x27;s second &quot;Bozo the Clown&quot;); impressionist/comic Michael Winslow; novelty rock band Green Jellÿ; and an unknown band called The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo which evolved into Oingo Boingo, led by future film and television score composer Danny Elfman. In 1979, Crips founder and executed murderer Stanley Tookie Williams appeared on the show as a bodybuilder. Future Academy Award-nominated actress Mare Winningham sang the Beatles song &quot;Here, There, and Everywhere&quot; on the program in 1976. Future Super Bowl XXXV winning head coach Brian Billick also made an appearance, performing a routine known as the &quot;spider monkey&quot;. Dancer Danny Lockin, who had played Barnaby in the film &quot;Hello Dolly!&quot;, was murdered hours after winning the show taped August 21, 1977. Television personality, actress and entrepreneur, Rhonda Shear appeared on the program in 1979. Journalist Maureen Orth, then writing for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, won second-place on a 1977 show, appearing as &quot;The World&#x27;s Oldest Cheerleader.&quot;

==Personnel==

===Barris as emcee===

An established game show producer (&quot;The Dating Game&quot;, &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;), Barris was originally creator and co-producer of &quot;The Gong Show&quot; and had no intention of hosting the show himself. He was an emergency replacement for original host John Barbour, who had objected to the show&#x27;s satirical concept and tried to adopt more of a traditional amateur-hour format.
Barbour would eventually serve as producer and co-host of the hit NBC Reality TV series, &quot;Real People&quot; (1979–84) 
Barris initially appeared somewhat ill at ease as host, but before long he was working so loosely on camera that many viewers assumed that he was intoxicated from alcohol or other drugs. In a later interview with the Archive of American Television, Barris recounted that he was never drunk and forbade the use of drugs by anyone in his production company.

Producer Chris Bearde, formerly of &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; and &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot;, clashed with Barris over the program&#x27;s content, favoring more scripted comedy over chaotic nonsense. (Bearde&#x27;s &quot;new talent&quot; segments on &quot;Laugh-In&quot; had featured oddball performers, the most celebrated being Tiny Tim.) After a violent argument between Barris and Bearde over the future direction of the show came to blows and resulted the throwing of chairs and other objects, Bearde resigned, leaving Barris fully in charge of &quot;The Gong Show&quot;.

===Musical direction===
Milton DeLugg was a popular musician and bandleader during the 1940s and 1950s. He got the &quot;Gong Show&quot; job by default; as the longtime music director of NBC, he was responsible for any network project that required special music (like the annual telecasts of the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade). Although DeLugg had previously arranged the theme for &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;, Barris initially regarded him as &quot;an anachronism&quot;; however, Barris was soon pleased to discover that DeLugg was very much attuned to the facetious tone of the show and he appeared alongside Barris in recurring comedy skits as various characters including bad-joke perveyor, &quot;Naso Literatus&quot; and the aged philosopher, &quot;Old Drool&quot;.

Veteran composer Joey Carbone provided musical arrangements for the late 1980s revival with his own lineup of studio musicians, known as &quot;The Gong Show Guys&quot;.

===Announcers===
Johnny Jacobs, who had worked for Barris for many years, was the main announcer from 1976 to 1980. When Jacobs was sidelined with an extended illness, Jack Clark substituted from October 3 through December 23, 1977. Charlie O&#x27;Donnell served as announcer for the late 1980s revival.

===Hostesses===
Hostesses included Siv Åberg (a Swedish-born model and actress who appeared on Barris&#x27;s syndicated &quot;New Treasure Hunt&quot;), actress Marlena Clark, porn star Carol Connors and Barris&#x27;s teenage daughter, Della.

==Broadcast history==

===NBC===
NBC first broadcast the show at 12:30 p.m. (11:30 a.m. Central and Pacific). This was the network&#x27;s least important time slot, as programs running at that time had to share the half-hour with a five-minute NBC newscast anchored by Edwin Newman. As a result, the first six-plus months of &quot;The Gong Show&quot; featured approximately twenty minutes of program content in a twenty-five-minute episode.

Many NBC affiliates in some larger markets opted not to run network programming during the noon hour at all, preferring to broadcast local news and talk shows instead. Thus &quot;Gong&quot; made its debut mainly on medium-market and smaller stations or on large-market rival stations that had picked up the program from the NBC affiliate that had rejected it. For example, in Boston, then-NBC affiliate WBZ-TV did not run the series, allowing local UHF independent outlet WSBK-TV to broadcast it.

&quot;Gong&#x27;s&quot; time slot was given to a new soap opera, &quot;Lovers and Friends&quot;, on January 3, 1977, and the show replaced the cancelled &quot;Another World&quot; spinoff &quot;Somerset&quot; at 4:00 p.m. The time change allowed &quot;Gong&quot; to expand to a full half-hour.

NBC broadcast a one-hour prime-time &quot;Gong Show&quot; special on April 26, 1977, featuring in-studio special guests Tony Randall, Alice Cooper and Harry James and His Orchestra. The winning act on this special was The Bait Brothers, and the panelists were Jaye P. Morgan, Jamie Farr and Arte Johnson.

====&quot;Popsicle Twins&quot; incident====
During &quot;The&quot; &quot;Gong Show&quot;&#x27;s run, Barris became well known for his clashes with the network censors, intentionally bringing in risque acts as a diversion to allow some of the less racy acts to slip by. In 1977, one of these bait acts, called &quot;Have You Got a Nickel?&quot;, made it onto the show. The act consisted of two teenage girls, both wearing shorts, sitting cross-legged on the stage floor and silently eating popsicles in a manner that suggested they were performing fellatio on the frozen treats. The nature of their act led to the two girls being referred to as the &quot;Popsicle Twins&quot;.

While the girls were able to complete their act without being gonged, they were given low scores by two of the judges. Phyllis Diller gave them a zero, while Jamie Farr followed with a marginally better 2. Jaye P. Morgan awarded them a 10, quipping, &quot;Do you know that&#x27;s the way I started (in show business)?&quot; and proceeded to eat one of the girls&#x27; popsicles.

The girls&#x27; act was approved by the NBC censors, who apparently did not see anything wrong with it during the rehearsals. However, after the episode was shown in the Eastern Time Zone, NBC cut the act from the later tape delay broadcast for western time zones. KNBC, alerted to the content, was able to preempt it. The act was not cut from all the tapes, and the &quot;Popsicle Twins&quot; incident has been seen in reruns and retrospectives. Barris said in a 2001 interview with &quot;Salon&quot; that this particular act began making him reconsider his career.

Despite its popularity and respectable ratings for a non-soap-opera midday show, NBC cancelled &quot;The Gong Show&quot;, with its final episode broadcast on July 21, 1978. At the time, there was much speculation as to the network&#x27;s true motivations for dumping the popular show. Barris has commented that he heard that NBC&#x27;s official reason was because of both &quot;lower than expected ratings&quot; and a desire by the network to &quot;re-tailor the morning shows to fit the standard morning demographics&quot; (the move coincided with the arrival of new NBC president Fred Silverman, who was well known for such programming overhauls and was reported to have disliked &quot;The Gong Show&quot;). &quot;America Alive!&quot;, a magazine-style variety program hosted by Art Linkletter&#x27;s son Jack, replaced &quot;Gong&quot;.

Following the cancellation, many critics and industry analysts – including Gene Shalit and Rona Barrett – reported having heard comments from within the NBC programming department from &quot;sources preferring anonymity&quot; that the true reason behind the cancellation was Barris&#x27;s refusal to tone down the increasingly risqué nature of the show. According to the sources, after the &quot;Popsicle Twins&quot; incident and an episode in which Jaye P. Morgan spontaneously exposed her breasts on air during a Gene Gene the Dancing Machine segment, Barris had been given an ultimatum by the network&#x27;s Standards and Practices department to deliver less racy shows for his audience, which included many younger viewers, or NBC would cancel the program.

====Finale====
NBC allowed Barris to continue the show for the rest of his contract, and Barris made no perceptible change in preparation for the finale. In the finale, staff member Larry Gotterer appeared as &quot;Fenwick Gotterer&quot; to host the show after Barris started the show doing a &quot;Chuckie&#x27;s Fables&quot; sketch. The rest of the final episode tried to explain the life of the show and its cancellation. Barris managed to have the last word on the show&#x27;s demise, appearing as a contestant. Playing in a country music band called &quot;The Hollywood Cowboys&quot; with the house band&#x27;s rhythm section, Barris sang a slightly modified version of Johnny Paycheck&#x27;s &quot;Take This Job and Shove It&quot;, giving NBC the finger during the song to accentuate his point. NBC censored the gesture, with the word &quot;OOPS!&quot; superimposed over a still shot of the set. Barris was gonged by Jamie Farr, who quipped, &quot;Because that little fella&#x27;s been saying that I&#x27;ve been long of nose, I&#x27;m also long of gong, fella.&quot;

The group &quot;Lobster Repair&quot; (who performed Harry Belafonte&#x27;s song &quot;Day-O&quot;) won the final $516.32 and trophy of the NBC era. Gotterer presented the award as Barris had been escorted off the set by NBC security.

===Syndication (1976–80)===
Immediately after taping the final NBC episode, Barris was evicted from NBC&#x27;s Burbank studios and &quot;The Gong Show&quot; set was moved to the studios of Golden West Broadcasters (now Sunset Bronson Studios) in Hollywood. Production of the syndicated nighttime/weekend version of &quot;The Gong Show&quot; continued there for two years. The entire syndicated run from September 1976 to September 1980 was distributed by Firestone Program Services. While the series eventually met its demise in syndication as it had on NBC, according to Barris, the problem did not lie with any outrageous acts, but instead the controversy and public outcry over another series he had produced.

In September 1979, Barris launched the game show &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;, which was a spin-off of &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;. Instead of recently married couples trying to match answers, the wives and secretaries of married men would compete to show who knew the men better. Religious activists and feminist groups protested against &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; and its ratings eventually forced the show&#x27;s cancellation during the middle of the season.

In Barris&#x27;s autobiography &quot;The Game Show King&quot;, he wrote that &quot;the public backlash from &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; not only caused the program to be canceled, but it took three other TV shows of mine with it. I went to my house in Malibu and stayed there for a year.&quot; &quot;Gong&quot; was one of those shows to be canceled, and Barris never hosted another series. The trauma from the &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&#x27;s&quot; backlash was so severe, in the last several weeks of the &quot;Gong Show&quot;, Barris reportedly had &quot;a small nervous breakdown&quot; on-air, because he was &quot;bored to death&quot; with broadcasting. His next two series, revivals of the 1960s game show &quot;Camouflage&quot; (the replacement for &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;) and his 1973–77 series &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot; (of which Barris had very little to zero involvement, according to host Geoff Edwards), both failed to find audiences and Barris went further into his self-imposed exile from television. Barris would not have another hit series until the 1985 syndication revival of &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;.

Reruns of the NBC shows began in syndication during the autumn of 1979. In the 1980s, the NBC and syndicated episodes were rerun on the USA Network and later, the Game Show Network, although by the time GSN picked up the series, many episodes had to be edited or were not broadcast due to musical performance clearance issues. No episodes from the first syndicated season, hosted by Gary Owens, were rerun.

===Later incarnations===
A syndicated weekday revival of &quot;The Gong Show&quot;, hosted by San Francisco disc jockey Don Bleu, ran during the 1988–89 season from September 12, 1988, to May 26, 1989, with reruns airing through September 15. Each winner was paid $701.
The last show of the Don Bleu&#x27;s revival is dedicated for a long-week tribute to France.

&quot;Extreme Gong&quot;, a later incarnation of &quot;The Gong Show&quot; on the Game Show Network had viewers vote on its acts by telephone. It was hosted by George Gray and ran from October 5, 1998, to August 31, 1999, with reruns continuing to air up until Fall of 2000. Winners received $317.69. This version was well known for two known incidents: one episode featuring &quot;Cody the Talking Dog&quot; for which he tried to say things like &quot;I love you&quot; and &quot;ice cream&quot; but did not succeed in talking, and another featuring a Village People parody as &quot;The Village Little People&quot; where they sang a cover of &quot;YMCA&quot;. Orange County comedy punk band the Radioactive Chicken Heads (then called Joe &amp; the Chicken Heads) made their national television debut on &quot;Extreme Gong&quot;, though they were gonged midway through their performance. Near the end of the show&#x27;s run, an hour-long &quot;Tournament of Talent&quot; special was aired in August 1999, with twelve previous winning acts (chosen by viewers via a phone-in poll) competing for a payoff of $10,000.

Comedy Central debuted a new incarnation called &quot;The Gong Show with Dave Attell&quot;, which lasted for eight weeks in the summer of 2008. The show&#x27;s format was similar to the original, but its scoring was based on a scale of 0 to 500, and winning acts received $600. The $600 was shown as paid in cash on the spot, rather than being paid by check as in earlier versions, but in reality (because of contestant eligibility regulations by Sony) was paid as a check from Sony Pictures. In place of a typical trophy, winners were awarded a belt in the style of boxing championship belts.

A live stage version of &quot;The Gong Show&quot; took place at B.B. King&#x27;s Blues Club, in the Times Square district of New York City on August 12, 2010. It was produced by The Radio Chick, and is the Sony authorized stage production. This production went into development in 2011–12 and now runs regularly in New York City, with engagements in other U.S. cities.

====2017 revival====
On October 3, 2016, ABC and Sony Pictures announced a 10-episode summer 2017 revival of &quot;The Gong Show&quot; executive produced by Will Arnett.

The broadcast of the 2017 revival premiered on ABC on June 22, 2017, hosted by previously unknown &quot;British comedian&quot; Tommy Maitland. Maitland was, in fact, a character portrayed by Mike Myers, although neither ABC nor Myers confirmed this and ABC officially credited Maitland as host and executive producer. Maitland&#x27;s catchphrase was &quot;Who&#x27;s a cheeky monkey?&quot; He also periodically used Barris&#x27;s &quot;back with more stuff&quot; catchphrase to lead into commercials.

Celebrity guest judges for the 2017 revival included Arnett, Zach Galifianakis, Alison Brie, Andy Samberg, Elizabeth Banks, Tracee Ellis Ross, Joel McHale, Megan Fox, Courteney Cox, Dana Carvey, Will Forte, Jack Black, Jennifer Aniston, Ken Jeong, Fred Armisen, Maya Rudolph and Anthony Anderson. Among the more notable acts featured on the revival are the Radioactive Chicken Heads, making their second appearance on a &quot;Gong Show&quot; incarnation since &quot;Extreme Gong&quot; in 1998. The first season of this version also features a regular segment featuring a staff performer leading the audience in a sing-along of the novelty song &quot;Shaving Cream&quot;, reminiscent of the recurring gag acts on the earlier version.

The winner of each show received a gong trophy and an oversized check in the amount of US$2,000.17, later increased by a penny the following year. The final episode of the first season featured a memorial to Barris, who died prior to the series&#x27; premiere in 2017.

On January 8, 2018, ABC announced that the revival would be picked up for a second season, officially confirmed Myers as the portrayer of Maitland and crediting Myers as an executive producer by name. The second (and final) season premiered on June 21, 2018. Celebrity guest judges for season 2 included Jimmy Kimmel, Jason Sudeikis, Brad Paisley, Dana Carvey, Alyson Hannigan, Ken Jeong, Kristen Schaal, and Rob Riggle. However, the series was not renewed for a third season and was quietly cancelled.

===Film===
In May, 1980, Universal Pictures released &quot;The Gong Show Movie&quot; to scathing reviews and the film was rapidly withdrawn from wide release. Advertising proclaimed it as &quot;&quot;The Gong Show&quot; That Got Gonged by the Censor&quot;. It was seen periodically on cable TV, but was never released on home video until March 29, 2016, after the film, which achieved cult status was released on Blu-ray by Shout! Factory.

&quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot;, a film directed by George Clooney and written by Charlie Kaufman, was based on the semi-fictional autobiography of the same name by Chuck Barris. Part of the film chronicles the making of &quot;The Gong Show&quot;, and features several clips from the original series.

Following the success of the print and screen versions of &quot;Confessions&quot;, GSN produced a documentary called &quot;The Chuck Barris Story: My Life on the Edge&quot;, which included rare footage from the Gary Owens pilot.

==International versions==
==Spinoffs==
At the height of the &quot;Gong Show&quot;&#x27;s popularity, NBC gave Barris a prime-time variety hour, &quot;The Chuck Barris Rah Rah Show&quot;. This was played somewhat more seriously than the &quot;Gong Show&quot;, with Jaye P. Morgan singing straight pop songs as in her nightclub and recording days, and bygone headliners like Slim Gaillard reprising their old hits for a studio audience. Other spinoffs include &quot;The $1.98 Beauty Show&quot; hosted by Rip Taylor and &quot;The Gong Show Movie&quot;.

<text>Cate Tiernan (born July 24, 1961) is the pen name of Gabrielle Charbonnet, an American author.

Writing as Cate Tiernan, she is best known for her &quot;Sweep&quot; series, which follows the Wiccan adventures of a cast of high school students. The stories are sold as the &quot;Wicca&quot; series in the UK, Belgium, The Netherlands and Australia, and as &quot;White Magic&quot; (&quot;Magie Blanche&quot;) in Italy and France. Under her own name, she is chiefly known for children&#x27;s books in the &quot;Princess&quot;, &quot;American Gold Gymnasts&quot;, and &quot;Disney Girls&quot; series. In 2008 and 2009, Charbonnet collaborated with author James Patterson on two &quot;young adult&quot; novels, &quot;Sundays at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Witch &amp; Wizard&quot;.

==Biography==
Charbonnet was born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1961. She began her college education at New York University studying writing and Russian language and literature, then transferred to Loyola University in New Orleans, where she graduated with a degree in Russian. She began her career as an assistant to the head of the Juvenile Audio and Video department at Random House in New York City, where she wrote her first children&#x27;s books. She also participated in the editing of &quot;The Secret Circle&quot; by L.J. Smith during this period.

After eight years in New York, Charbonnet and her husband moved back to New Orleans, where they began a family (two children) and she embarked on her &quot;Sweep&quot; series. While not a Wiccan herself, she asserts that she &quot;can really relate to Wicca&quot;, and appreciates its &quot;woman-centeredness and its essentially female identity.&quot;

After five years in New Orleans, Charbonnet moved to Durham, North Carolina, where she now lives with her husband Paul, two children, two stepsons, a poodle, and &quot;an unfortunate number of cats.&quot;

Charbonnet has written about 75 books under her own name, her pseudonym Cate Tiernan, and miscellaneous other pen names as a ghost writer.

<doc id="88056" wikidata="Q655040" url="?curid=88056" title="Oden">
<text>is a type of nabemono (Japanese one-pot dishes) consisting of several ingredients such as boiled eggs, daikon or konjac, and processed fishcakes stewed in a light, soy-flavored dashi broth. 

Oden was originally what is now commonly called &quot;&quot; or simply &quot;dengaku&quot;; konjac (&quot;konnyaku&quot;) or tofu was boiled and eaten with miso. Later, instead of using miso, ingredients were cooked in dashi, and oden became popular. Ingredients vary according to region and between each household. Karashi is often used as a condiment.

Oden is often sold from food carts, though some izakayas and several convenience store chains also serve it, and dedicated oden restaurants exist. Many different varieties are sold, with single-ingredient dishes sometimes as cheap as 100 yen. While it is usually considered a winter food, some carts and restaurants offer oden year-round. Many of these restaurants keep their broth as a master stock, replenishing it as it simmers to let the flavor deepen and develop over many months and years.

== Regional variations ==
=== Japan ===
In Nagoya, it may be called and soy sauce is used as a dipping sauce.
Miso oden is simmered in hatchomiso broth, which tastes lightly sweet. Konjac and tofu are common ingredients.

In the Kansai area, this dish is sometimes called and tends to be more strongly flavored than the lighter Kantō version.

Shizuoka oden uses a dark-colored broth flavored with beef stock and dark soy sauce, and all ingredients are skewered. Dried and ground fish (sardine, mackerel, or katsuobushi) and aonori powder are sprinkled on top before eating.

Udon restaurants in Kagawa Prefecture in Shikoku almost always offer oden as a side dish, to be eaten with sweet miso while waiting for udon.
=== Outside Japan ===
==== China ====
In China, 7-11 markets oden as &quot;haodun&quot; () a word play on &quot;good pot&quot;.

==== South Korea ====

In South Korea, the loanword &quot;odeng&quot; () borrowed from Japanese &quot;oden&quot; is a synonym of &quot;eomuk&quot; (fishcakes). The boiled dish consisting of fishcakes is called by the names such as &quot;odeng-tang&quot; () or &quot;eomuk-jeongol&quot; (), with the words such as &quot;tang&quot; (soup) or &quot;jeongol&quot; (hot pot) attached to the ingredient name. The street food version is sold from small carts and is usually served with a spicy soup. It is very common on the streets of South Korea and there are many restaurants that have it on the menu or specialize in it.

==== Taiwan ====

Oden was introduced to Taiwanese cuisine during Japanese rule and is referred to in Taiwanese Hokkien as &quot;olen&quot; (), which has been further loaned into Taiwanese Mandarin as &quot;hēilún&quot; (). &quot;Tianbula&quot; () is a common ingredient for oden and is a popular snack at night markets. Tianbula is actually Japanese satsuma-age and was introduced to Taiwan by people from Kyushu (where satsuma-age is commonly known as &quot;tempura&quot;) when Taiwan was under Japanese rule. Besides the more traditional ingredients, the Taiwanese &quot;olen&quot; also uses many local ingredients, such as pork meatballs and blood puddings. More recently, oden is offered in convenience stores where it is sold as &quot;guāndōngzhǔ&quot; (), the Mandarin reading of the Japanese characters for &quot;Kantō-ni&quot;.

<text>In Norse mythology, Garmr or Garm (Old Norse: ) is a wolf or dog associated with both Hel and Ragnarök, and described as a blood-stained guardian of Hel&#x27;s gate.

==Name==
The etymology of the name &quot;Garmr&quot; remains uncertain. Bruce Lincoln brings together Garmr and the Greek mythological dog Cerberus, relating both names to a Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*ger-&quot; &quot;to growl&quot; (perhaps with the suffixes &quot;-*m/*b&quot; and &quot;-*r&quot;). However, Daniel Ogden notes that this analysis actually requires &quot;Cerberus&quot; and &quot;Garmr&quot; to be derived from two &quot;different&quot; Indo-European roots (*&quot;ger-&quot; and *&quot;gher-&quot; respectively), and in this opinion does not establish a relationship between the two names.

==Attestations==

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
The &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot; mentions Garmr:

&lt;poem&gt;The best of trees | must Yggdrasil be,
Skíðblaðnir best of boats;
Of all the gods | is Óðinn the greatest,
And Sleipnir the best of steeds;
Bifröst of bridges, | Bragi of skalds,
Hábrók of hawks, | and Garm of hounds.&lt;/poem&gt;

One of the refrains of &quot;Völuspá&quot; uses Garmr&#x27;s howling to herald the coming of Ragnarök:

&lt;poem&gt;Now Garm howls loud | before Gnipahellir,
The fetters will burst, | and the wolf run free;
Much do I know, | and more can see
Of the fate of the gods, | the mighty in fight.&lt;/poem&gt;

After the first occurrence of this refrain the Fimbulvetr is related; the second occurrence is succeeded by the invasion the world of gods by jötnar; after the last occurrence, the rise of a new and better world is described.

&quot;Baldrs draumar&quot; describes a journey which Odin makes to Hel. Along the way he meets a dog.

&lt;poem&gt;Then Óðinn rose, | the enchanter old,
And the saddle he laid | on Sleipnir&#x27;s back;
Thence rode he down | to Niflhel deep,
And the hound he met | that came from hell.

Bloody he was | on his breast before,
At the father of magic | he howled from afar;
Forward rode Óðinn, | the earth resounded
Till the house so high | of Hel he reached.&lt;/poem&gt;

Although unnamed, this dog is sometimes assumed to be Garmr. Alternatively, Garmr is sometimes assumed to be identical to Fenrir. Garmr is sometimes seen as a hellhound, comparable to Cerberus.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; assigns him a role in Ragnarök:
:Then shall the dog Garmr be loosed, which is bound before Gnipahellir: he shall do battle with Týr, and each become the other&#x27;s slayer.

== In popular culture ==
Garmr is the namesake and emblem of the protagonist&#x27;s squadron, Galm Team, in the combat flight simulation game &quot;Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War.&quot; The name &quot;Galm&quot; is a mistransliteration of &quot;Garmr&quot; into English due to the singular liquid phoneme in the Japanese language.

Garmr appears as a boss fight in the 2017 video game &quot;&quot; and 2022&#x27;s &quot;God of War Ragnarök&quot;.

In episode 12 of the anime The Most Notorious &quot;Talker&quot; Runs the World&#x27;s Greatest Clan, the new group Wild Tempest must fight in the Quartz Valley against Garmr, who is a rank 9 beastly dog. This version of Garmr is intelligent, can speak, has 3 tails, 3 pairs of eyes, and has an open chest.

==Legacy==
Sheila E. has been regarded as one of the greatest musicians of her generation. She has been referred to as the &quot;Queen of Percussion&quot; for having become the first female drummer and percussionist in mainstream pop music. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Sheila at number 58 on its list of 100 Greatest Drummers of All Time in 2016.

As a performer, she became known for her showmanship as a percussionist and drummer. Eventually in the 1980s, she came to be regarded as a sex symbol by the media for her innovative and revealing outfits. She later expressed her frustration for being viewed as a sexual image. Sheila told &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;No one knows me for what I do best. But people don&#x27;t realize I can play drums--I mean really play.&quot; She wrote the song &quot;Sex Cymbal&quot; as response to the &quot;sex symbol&quot; imagery given by the media and released it as the lead single of her fourth album in 1991.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
In 1975, Sheila dated musician Carlos Santana, whom she met during the time her father Pete Escovedo played percussion in rock band Santana. Their relationship ended when she discovered that he was married to his then-wife Deborah King. 
In 1984, she was in a romantic relationship with Prince while he was still in a relationship with Susannah Melvoin. In the late 1989, they became engaged during Prince&#x27;s Lovesexy Tour. She later ended the engagement in late 1989.

===Health===
In late 1991, Sheila was hospitalized shortly after returning from her tour in Japan. She experienced a collapsed lung after a failed acupuncture treatment punctured her left lung. Following the collapsed lung, she also became semi-paralyzed due to her calf muscle becoming degraded due to wearing high heels while playing drums. She underwent a two-week long treatment to rebuild her calf muscle and regain the ability to walk. She described herself as &quot;semi-paralyzed from playing drums in heels for so long&quot;.

==Achievements==
Throughout her career, Sheila E. has earned numerous awards and honors.

<text>St. Mary&#x27;s University is a private Roman Catholic university in San Antonio, Texas. Founded by the Society of Mary (Marianists) in 1852, St. Mary&#x27;s is the oldest Catholic university in Texas and the American Southwest.

With a student population of nearly 4,000, St. Mary&#x27;s is home to a College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences; School of Science, Engineering and Technology; the Greehey School of Business; and the St. Mary&#x27;s University School of Law.

==History==

Founded as St. Mary&#x27;s Institute, the school opened on Aug. 25, 1852, with a faculty of five and an enrollment of twelve boys. In 1921, all college classes were transferred from downtown to the St. Louis College campus. In 1923, St. Louis College became St. Mary&#x27;s College with an enrollment of twelve in the freshman class. Grade school and high school students remained at the downtown school, which adopted the name St. Mary&#x27;s Academy. The new St. Mary&#x27;s College quickly gained senior college status and in 1927 the first class of bachelor&#x27;s degree candidates graduated from the newly renamed St. Mary&#x27;s University.

In 1932, the high school programs at St. Mary&#x27;s Academy relocated from the College Street campus to become Central Catholic High School. After over a century as an all-male institution, St. Mary&#x27;s opened its doors to female students in 1963 and became a coeducational university. In 1987, Polish-American silent film star Pola Negri left most of her estate to St. Mary&#x27;s University, including a collection of memorabilia and several rare prints of her films. St. Mary&#x27;s University also set up a scholarship in her name.

==Academics==

St. Mary&#x27;s is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. In addition, the Greehey School of Business is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Electrical and industrial engineering programs in the School of Science, Engineering and Technology are recognized through accreditation by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). St. Mary’s has a student to faculty ratio of 11 to 1.

===Admissions===
In 2024, the university accepted 86.2% of applicants, with those admitted having an average 3.61 GPA. Submission of SAT or ACT scores is not required, St. Mary&#x27;s University being a test optional school. Those submitting test scores had an average 1120 SAT or average 23 ACT score.

===Rankings===
For 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked St. Mary&#x27;s #17 out of 118 Regional Universities West, #1 in Regional Universities West Best Value Schools, tied for #9 in Regional Universities West Top Performers on Social Mobility, #12 in Regional Universities West Best Colleges for Veterans, and tied for #131 in Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs at schools where a doctorate is not offered.

===Law school===

In October 1927, the San Antonio Bar Association established the San Antonio School of Law, and for seven years after its founding was administered by a board of governors under the control of the bar association. Until the School of Law became associated with a physical campus, classes were held at the Bexar County Courthouse. In an attempt to maximize educational and material resources of the fledgling institution, the Board of Governors negotiated with St. Mary&#x27;s University regarding a transfer of the School of Law&#x27;s administrative control. The transfer was completed on October 1, 1934, and St. Mary&#x27;s University School of Law was officially established.

The School of Law was then housed at St. Mary&#x27;s University&#x27;s then downtown campus at 112 College Street, situated near the San Antonio River Walk. Possessing several military bases, San Antonio experienced a surge of population and industry in the years immediately following World War II. This exponential growth resulted in more law students. To meet these new demands adequately, the School of Law organized itself to meet the requirements of the American Bar Association and the Association of American Law Schools. It received accreditation from the ABA in February 1948 and became a member of the AALS in December 1949.

On December 19, 1967, the School of Law relocated from the College Street campus to join the main campus of St. Mary&#x27;s. A multimillion-dollar expansion project had provided for the addition of eight new buildings to the main University campus, including a lecture hall, law library, and faculty building. The school held its first classes in January, 1968.

Since 1968, the school has had several structures rededicated, renovated, or expanded, including the Law Administration Building, housing the office of the dean; the Law Classroom Building; and the Sarita Kenedy East Law Library, named after Sarita Kenedy East and dedicated in 1984 after the John G. and Marie Stella Kenedy Memorial Foundation gave the School of Law $7.5 million to fund its construction in January 1982.

In 2024, the School of Law was ranked tied for 153rd out of 196 law schools by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

==Athletics==

St. Mary&#x27;s University is a member of NCAA Division II and the Lone Star Conference and sponsors 12 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports at the varsity level. St. Mary&#x27;s has won four team national championships in men&#x27;s basketball (1989), baseball (2001), softball (1986 and 2002), and one individual national title in men&#x27;s golf (2006). In 2020, St. Mary&#x27;s launched an E-Sports team.

==Student life==
There are a total of 68 registered organizations. During the beginning of the semester, the Office of Resident Life, in cooperation with student organizations, hosts a &quot;Rattler Round Up&quot; for incoming freshmen and other students.

Most of the students live in one of the 13 residence halls. These halls are divided among upper and lower classmen with some being mixed, but no strict enforcement is placed upon the assignment of rooms.

===Events===
In April, St. Mary&#x27;s University and the city of San Antonio plays host to Fiesta San Antonio. On campus, the university hosts Oyster Bake, a combination of concerts, food stalls, and carnival rides. The university has played host to the event since 1916 and it has since become a major event in the city culturally and economically. The event is open to students, who are also able to participate in &quot;Rattler Fest&quot; which is a exclusive festival for St. Mary&#x27;s students prior to the larger Oyster Bake.

===Greek Life===
St. Mary&#x27;s University is home to twelve Greek organizations, while no Greek organization is permitted to have a house due to a city ordinance preventing boarding homes. Every Friday Greek Life hosts &quot;Quad&quot; where every active social fraternity and sorority hangout in the morning behind St. Louis Hall.

Many of the events that are open to the university community are organized by the campus IFC chapter.

<doc id="88066" wikidata="Q429168" url="?curid=88066" title="Syllable Desktop">
<text>Syllable Desktop is a discontinued free and open-source lightweight hobbyist operating system for Pentium and compatible processors. Its purpose was to create an easy-to-use desktop operating system for the home and small office user. Its development began in 2002 as a fork of AtheOS Another version of Syllable OS is the Syllable Server, which is based on Linux core.

== History ==
Syllable Desktop is a fork of AtheOS, a free and open source operating system that was discontinued. AtheOS was originally developed to be an Amiga clone for x86 processors, and also took inspiration from BeOS for the file system it used. Syllable was started around July 2002 because the sole developer of AtheOS went inactive for nine months. Syllable Desktop aimed to be a successor to AtheOS and expand on it, such as adding additional hardware support. Further development aimed at porting additional software and libraries. The last source code commit was in 2012, but the developer is working on restarting the project according to information on the website.

== Features ==
Syllable Desktop has a native Webkit-based web browser named Webster (formerly ABrowse), an email client named Whisper, a media player, an IDE, and other applications.

Features according to the official website include:
* Native 64-bit journaled file system, the AtheOS File System (AFS)
* C++ oriented API
* Object-oriented graphical desktop environment on a native GUI architecture
* Mostly POSIX compliant
* Software ports, including Vim, Perl, Python, Apache, others.
* GNU toolchain (GCC, Glibc, Binutils, Make)
* Preemptive multitasking with multithreading
* Symmetric multiprocessing (multiple processor) support
* Device drivers for most common hardware (video, sound, network chips)
* File system drivers for FAT (read/write), NTFS (read) and ext2 (read)
* Rebol as system scripting language

== Reception ==
OSNews gave a positive review of Syllable, calling it &quot;astoundingly complete for a hobbyist OS at version 0.5&quot; and praising the speed of the OS, but noting that some features and subsystems were not yet implemented, the limited range of apps, and the occasional stability issues. Linux.com noted similar points in their review. pro-linux.de stated that Syllable was a promising upcoming operating system. A review by Root.cz was negative, stating that &quot;for now, Syllable is just one of the less successful alternatives to Linux or *BSD.&quot;

<text>This Modern World is a weekly satirical comic strip by cartoonist and political commentator Tom Tomorrow (real name Dan Perkins) that covers current events from a left-wing point of view. Published continuously for more than 30 years, &quot;This Modern World&quot; appears regularly in more than 80 newspapers across the United States and Canada as of 2015, as well as in &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The Nib&quot;, &quot;Truthout&quot;, and the &quot;Daily Kos&quot;.

&quot;This Modern World&quot; has won a number of awards, including the Society of Professional Journalists James Madison Freedom of Information Award and the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award (twice); the strip was a finalist for the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning.

== Overview ==
While &quot;This Modern World&quot; often ridicules those in power, the strip also focuses on the average American&#x27;s support for contemporary leaders and their policies, as well as the popular media&#x27;s role in shaping public perception.

The series has been through several incarnations through the years, the first of which appeared in the &quot;Suburban High Life&quot; comic books published by Slave Labor in the late 1980s. A recurring theme in the comic books (though far less so in subsequent comic strip) was that of &quot;reality engineering&quot;, wherein &quot;the very fabric of space and time&quot; is mined for &quot;the good of mankind&quot;. This periodically generates &quot;reality discontinuities&quot;, where reality breaks down. These are (generally) resolved by reality engineers.

Visually &quot;This Modern World&quot; draws inspiration from a retro, 1950s sensibility, with brightly colored illustrations that are also inspired by clip art. Initially, the strip was almost completely composed of actual vintage clip art and magazine cutouts, assembled collage-style and often manipulated and retouched. However, Tomorrow has gradually replaced cutouts with his own drawings, which merely mimic the clip art look. Usually drawn in four panels, it is not uncommon for all panels to be identical or nearly so, with only the dialogue and/or facial expressions changing.

The &#x27;50s theme extends to the typically verbose dialogue of the strip&#x27;s human characters, which is often bubbly, over-enthusiastic, and naïve. The stupidity of the humans is countered by Sparky, a fast-talking penguin (although the strip occasionally postulates he is actually an auk) with a red visor, who provides much of the strip&#x27;s political commentary.

== Publication history ==
Perkins was first published in the Spring 1986 issue of &quot;Processed World&quot;. He adopted the subject matter of the consumer culture and the drudgery of work, a theme shared by the magazine, and entitled his comic strip &quot;This Modern World&quot;. In 1990, the strip began to be run in the &quot;SF Weekly&quot;, before being picked up in the fall of 1991 by the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;. As his audience expanded, Perkins shifted the focus of the strip to politics. Perkins added papers throughout the 1990s, distributing his comic via self-syndication, a practice he has continued throughout his career.

In 2009, Village Voice Media, publishers of 16 alternative weeklies, suspended all syndicated cartoons across their entire chain. Perkins thereby lost twelve client papers in cities, including Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, and Seattle, prompting his friend Eddie Vedder to post an open letter on the Pearl Jam website in support of the cartoonist.

==Characters==
In addition to any politicians and celebrities depicted, the strip has several recurring characters:

;Tom Tomorrow
Tom occasionally appears in his own strips as himself, breaking the fourth wall.

;Tom Tomorrow (fictional)
In an &quot;intermediate&quot; version of the strip, a character &quot;named&quot; Tom Tomorrow was in the strip. He was a private investigator who was dressed in a radiation suit so his face was never seen. He was eventually phased out.

;Dippy the Wonder-Penguin
Fictional Tom Tomorrow&#x27;s sidekick. His vocabulary was limited to &quot;wank&quot;.

;Sparky the Wonder Penguin
A sort of upgraded version of Dippy (who had been phased out by the time of Sparky&#x27;s introduction), Sparky is a sunglasses-wearing penguin that can actually talk. Similar to Dippy, Sparky&#x27;s first words in the strip are &quot;George [H. W.] Bush is a wanker&quot;. A strong liberal advocate, he briefly became a Republican after being hit on the head with a random falling toilet.

;Blinky the Dog
A small Boston Terrier who shares most of Sparky&#x27;s political sympathies. Normally very mellow, he briefly became a radical when steroids were put into his food when he was intended to replace the then-Republican Sparky.

;Bob Friendly
Mr. Friendly is in charge of the advertising section of &quot;This Modern World&quot; (thus breaking the fourth wall). It was he who introduced Sparky the Penguin. He appears only occasionally.

;Dr. Wilbur von Philbert
One of the longest-running characters in the strip, Dr. von Philbert is the person who discovered how to mine reality for energy.

;Biff and Wanda
Two blow-dried news presenters of &quot;Action McNews&quot;, a newscast in which Tomorrow suggests that most TV news is little more than PR spin. A Biff and Wanda strip almost always ends with a cut to a commercial break (&quot;Now, these messages!&quot;).

;Biff and Betty
Biff and Betty are two archetypes of 1950s people, who sometimes share their thoughts on the modern world. Biff often appears alone with Sparky, expressing a naive conservative opinion which invariably prompts an exasperated liberal rebuttal from the penguin.

;Invisible Hand of the Free Market Man
Invisible Hand of the Free Market Man (abbreviated I.H.O.T.F.M.-Man in dialog in the strip) is a superhero character, wearing what is basically a Superman costume, with an I.H.O.T.F.M.-Man logo (a hand with a letter of IHOTF on each finger, and M in the palm) where the Superman logo would be. I.H.O.T.F.M.-Man&#x27;s head is a giant left hand with facial features in the palm. I.H.O.T.F.M.-Man is an ardent defender of Adam Smith&#x27;s invisible hand metaphor, and usually intervenes in situations where the purity of free market economics is in jeopardy. His declarations are often based on principles of free-market economics taken to their logical extreme. The first panel of a comic featuring I.H.O.T.F.M-Man is usually a parody of the cover of &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1. Often, another character will point out that he is, in fact, not invisible.

;Conservative Jones and Moonbat McWacky
Conservative Jones and Moonbat McWacky are two children used in the strip to satirize conservative talking points. Conservative is dressed as a boy detective and asks Moonbat questions about politics. Moonbat gives reasonable answers, which the Conservative turns into illogical statements about liberals.

;Public figures
All the presidents since Ronald Reagan have appeared, as well as other political and media figures. Rush Limbaugh is a favorite caricature subject, although he usually talks through a radio and is not personally shown. (He was once, however, depicted as a pig, in a strip parodying the film &quot;The Mask&quot;.) Conservative columnist Ann Coulter is often the target of particularly unflattering caricatures, usually popping up in the middle of a strip to make a typically inflammatory remark, ending with a guttural &quot;Haw haw haw!&quot; laugh. In a few strips, George W. Bush gets hold of what appears to be the DeLorean from &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and goes back in time to meet America&#x27;s Founding Fathers. Karl Rove and Bill O&#x27;Reilly make frequent appearances.

;Parallel Earth
The strip occasionally visits a parallel Earth, a deliberate parody of our own world. In some strips, Parallel Earth makes wacky political choices which are exaggerated versions of real-world events. In others, the inhabitants of Parallel Earth have made sensible political choices, in contrast to the people of our own world (but wear odd, brightly-colored clothing featuring polka dots).

;Small Cute Dog
A small cute dog who was accidentally elected president of Parallel Earth in the year 2000 (and re-elected in 2004), and whose subsequent actions mirrored those of President George W. Bush.

;Planet Glox
A pair of tentacle-waving anchor-aliens host a newscast from Planet Glox, resembling Fox News. They report about news strikingly similar to that on Earth, but in factual scientific terminology (i.e., Coneheads-style), thereby making fun, for example, of the public obsession with the sexual activities of public figures, by referring to the global importance of touching reproductive organs.

===Other recurring elements===

; Supergiant Conglomerated Corporation
A fictitious, stereotypical big business or megacorporation in an unspecified industry, but appears to represent the military-industrial complex. This company has been portrayed as being unethical, manipulative, obsessed with spin, and environmentally unfriendly. Occasionally written as &quot;Supergiant Amalgamated Corporation&quot;.

; &quot;Action McNews&quot;
The (presumably local) TV news program on which Biff and Wanda are anchors.

==In other media==
From 2000 to 2001, an animated &quot;This Modern World&quot; series was produced by Flickerlab for Mondo Media, with Bob Harris as the voice of Sparky. The show was the top-billed attraction in Mondo Media&#x27;s lineup of mini-shows; each episode was approximately five minutes long.

<text>Dan Perkins (born April 5, 1961), better known by his pen name Tom Tomorrow, is an American editorial cartoonist. His weekly comic strip, &quot;This Modern World&quot;, which comments on current events, appears regularly in more than 80 newspapers across the United States and Canada as of 2015, as well as in &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The Nib&quot;, &quot;Truthout&quot;, and the &quot;Daily Kos&quot;, where he was the former comics curator and now is a regular contributor. His work has appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;Salon&quot;, &quot;The American Prospect&quot;, &quot;CREDO Action&quot;, and &quot;AlterNet&quot;.

==Career==
Perkins was first published in the San Francisco-based anarchist magazine &quot;Processed World&quot;. He adopted the subject matter of the consumer culture and the drudgery of work, a theme shared by the magazine, and entitled his comic strip &quot;This Modern World&quot; when it was launched in 1988. (Like many of the magazine&#x27;s contributors he adopted a pseudonym to avoid retribution from potential employers.)

In 1990, the strip began to be run in the &quot;SF Weekly&quot;, before being picked up in the fall of 1991 by the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;. During this time of expanding audiences for Perkins, he shifted the focus of his work to politics. Perkins added papers throughout the 1990s, distributing his comic via self-syndication, a practice he has continued throughout his career.

In 1998, Perkins was asked by editor James Fallows to contribute a bi-weekly cartoon to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, but was fired less than six months later, reportedly at the direction of owner Mort Zuckerman.

In 1999, Perkins had an animation deal with &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and produced three animated spots that were never aired. In 2000 and 2001, his online animated series was the top-billed attraction in Mondo Media&#x27;s lineup of mini-shows, in which the voice of Sparky the Penguin was provided by &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; champion and author Bob Harris. Perkins has also collaborated with Michael Moore, according to a 2005 interview with the &quot;Santa Cruz Metro&quot;.

In December 2007, Keith Olbermann devoted the closing segment of an episode of his show to a reading of &quot;Bill O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Very Useful Advice for Young People&quot;, a two-page cartoon-cover story by Perkins for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

In 2009, Village Voice Media, publishers of 16 alternative weeklies, suspended all syndicated cartoons across their entire chain. Perkins thereby lost twelve client papers in cities including Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, and Seattle, prompting his friend Eddie Vedder to post an open letter on the Pearl Jam website in support of the cartoonist. Vedder and Perkins had become friends after meeting at a campaign rally for Ralph Nader in 2000. The collaboration between Pearl Jam and Perkins continued with an invitation to submit cover art for the &quot;Backspacer&quot; album in 2009. After being selected to provide the cover art for &quot;Backspacer&quot;, Perkins went on to create a series of Halloween-themed posters for the concerts supporting the album.

In 2015, Perkins was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and later in the year, ran a Kickstarter campaign that raised more than $300,000 to publish a career retrospective, &quot;25 Years of Tomorrow&quot;.

==&quot;This Modern World&quot;==

&quot;This Modern World&quot; is Perkins&#x27; ongoing comic strip that has been published continuously for more than 31 years. While it often ridicules those in power, the strip also focuses on the average American&#x27;s support for contemporary leaders and their policies, as well as the popular media&#x27;s role in shaping public perception.

In addition to any politicians and celebrities depicted, the strip has several recurring characters:
* A sunglasses-wearing penguin named &quot;Sparky&quot; and his Boston terrier friend, &quot;Blinky&quot;
* &quot;Biff&quot;, a generic conservative often used by Sparky as a foil
* &quot;Conservative Jones&quot;, a boy detective whose deductive reasoning satirizes the logic of conservative news analysts and politicians
* The tentacle-waving aliens of planet Glox
* The &quot;Small Cute Dog&quot;, who was accidentally elected president on &quot;parallel earth&quot;, and whose subsequent actions mirrored those of President George W. Bush
* The &quot;Invisible Hand of the Free Market Man&quot;, a superhero figure whose head is shaped like a human hand

In September 2001, he began his blog, also called &quot;This Modern World&quot;.

==Personal life==
Perkins, a longtime resident of both San Francisco and Brooklyn, lives in New York City according to his Twitter bio.

<text>Shakespeare in Love is a 1998 period romantic comedy film directed by John Madden, written by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, and produced by Harvey Weinstein. It stars Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench. The film depicts a fictional love affair involving playwright William Shakespeare (Fiennes) and Viola de Lesseps (Paltrow) during the writing of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Several characters are based on historical figures, and many of the characters, lines, and plot devices allude to Shakespeare&#x27;s plays.

&quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; received acclaim from critics and was a box-office success, grossing $289 million worldwide and becoming the ninth-highest-grossing film of 1998. The film was noted for its highly skilled plotting and balancing of comedy and drama and for the high quality of its dialogue, performances, and production design. It received numerous accolades; it won three Golden Globe Awards (including Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Best Actress - Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for Paltrow), two Screen Actors Guild Awards (Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture and Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role for Paltrow), and four British Academy Film Awards (including Best Film). The film ultimately won a leading seven Oscars out of thirteen nominations at the 71st Academy Awards: Best Picture (Parfitt, Gigliotti, Weinstein, Zwick, &amp; Norman), Best Actress (Paltrow), Best Supporting Actress (Dench), Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen (Norman &amp; Stoppard), Best Original Musical or Comedy Score (Warbeck), Best Art Direction (Childs &amp; Quertier), and Best Costume Design (Powell).

==Plot==
In 1593 London, William Shakespeare is a sometime player in the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men and playwright for Philip Henslowe, owner of The Rose Theatre. Suffering from writer&#x27;s block with a new comedy, &quot;Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, Shakespeare attempts to seduce Rosaline, mistress of Richard Burbage, owner of the rival Curtain Theatre, and to convince Burbage to buy the play from Henslowe. Shakespeare receives advice from rival playwright Christopher Marlowe, but is despondent to learn Rosaline is sleeping with Master of the Revels Edmund Tilney. The desperate Henslowe, in debt to ruthless moneylender Fennyman, begins auditions anyway.

Viola de Lesseps, daughter of a wealthy merchant, who has seen Shakespeare&#x27;s plays at court, disguises herself as a man named Thomas Kent to audition. Kent gains Shakespeare&#x27;s interest with a speech from &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;, but runs away when Shakespeare questions her. He pursues Kent to Viola&#x27;s house and leaves a note with her nurse, asking Kent to begin rehearsals at the Rose.

Shakespeare sneaks into a ball at the house, where Viola&#x27;s parents arrange her betrothal to Lord Wessex, an aristocrat in need of money. Dancing with Viola, Shakespeare is struck speechless. Confronted by Wessex, Shakespeare introduces himself as Christopher Marlowe. Wessex ejects &quot;Marlowe&quot; and threatens to kill him. Shakespeare finds Viola on her balcony, where they confess their mutual attraction before he is discovered by her nurse and flees.

Inspired by Viola, Shakespeare quickly transforms the play into what will become &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Rehearsals begin, with Thomas Kent as Romeo, the leading tragedian Ned Alleyn as Mercutio, and the stagestruck Fennyman in a small role. After Shakespeare discovers Viola&#x27;s true identity, they begin a secret affair.

Viola is summoned to court to receive approval for her proposed marriage to Wessex. Shakespeare accompanies her, disguised as her nurse&#x27;s female cousin, and anonymously persuades Wessex in public to wager £50 that a play can capture the true nature of love, the amount Shakespeare requires to buy a share in the Chamberlain&#x27;s Men. Queen Elizabeth I declares that she will judge the matter.

Burbage learns Shakespeare has seduced Rosaline and cheated him out of payment for the play, and starts a brawl at the Rose with his company. The Rose players repel Burbage and his men and celebrate at the pub, where a drunken Henslowe lets slip to Viola that Shakespeare is married, albeit separated from his wife. News arrives that Marlowe has been murdered. A guilt-ridden Shakespeare assumes Wessex had Marlowe killed, believing him to be Viola&#x27;s lover, while Viola believes Shakespeare to be the victim. Shakespeare appears at her church, allaying Viola&#x27;s fears and terrifying Wessex, who believes he is a ghost. Viola confesses her love for Shakespeare, but both recognize she cannot escape her duty to marry Wessex.

John Webster, an unpleasant boy who hangs around the theatre, spies on Shakespeare and Viola making love and informs Tilney, who closes the Rose for breaking the ban on women actors. Viola&#x27;s identity is exposed, leaving Shakespeare without a stage or a lead actor, until Burbage offers his theatre and the heartbroken Shakespeare takes the role of Romeo. Following her wedding, Viola learns the play will be performed that day, and runs away to the Curtain. She overhears that the boy playing Juliet cannot perform, his voice having broken, and Henslowe asks her to replace him. She plays Juliet to Shakespeare&#x27;s Romeo to an enthralled audience.

Just after the play has concluded, Tilney arrives to arrest everyone for indecency due to Viola&#x27;s presence, but the Queen reveals herself in attendance and restrains him, pretending that Kent is a man with a &quot;remarkable resemblance&quot; to a woman. Powerless to end a lawful marriage, she orders Viola to sail with Wessex to Virginia. The Queen also tells Wessex, who followed Viola to the theatre, that &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; has won the bet for Shakespeare, and has Kent deliver his £50 to Shakespeare with instructions to write &quot;something more cheerful next time, for Twelfth Night&quot;.

Viola and Shakespeare say their goodbyes, and he vows to immortalize her, as he imagines the beginning of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, in character as a castaway disguised as a man after a voyage to a strange land.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
The original idea for &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; was suggested to screenwriter Marc Norman in the late 1980s by his son Zachary. Norman wrote a draft screenplay which he presented to director Edward Zwick, which attracted Julia Roberts, who agreed to play Viola. However, Zwick disliked Norman&#x27;s screenplay and hired the playwright Tom Stoppard to improve it (Stoppard&#x27;s first major success had been with the Shakespeare-themed play &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;).

The film went into production in 1991 at Universal, with Zwick as director, but although sets and costumes were in construction, Shakespeare had not yet been cast, because Roberts insisted that only Daniel Day-Lewis could play the role. Day-Lewis was uninterested, and when Roberts failed to persuade him, she withdrew from the film, six weeks before shooting was due to begin. Zwick and the studio had tried to hold chemistry tests between Roberts and several then-unknown actors, including Hugh Grant, Ralph Fiennes, Jeremy Northam, Rupert Graves, Colin Firth, and Sean Bean, but Roberts either skipped the meetings or found faults with them all. After one last screen test with Paul McGann, Roberts pulled out of the production, which Zwick attributed to insecurity about the pressure she was under to succeed in the role. The production went into turnaround, and Zwick was unable to persuade other studios to take up the screenplay. Canceling the film cost Universal $6 million.

Eventually, Zwick got Miramax Films interested in the screenplay, but Miramax Films chose John Madden as director. Miramax Films boss Harvey Weinstein acted as producer. For the president of a studio to have given himself a producer credit created a firestorm within the industry that resulted in what has come to be known as “&quot;the Harvey Rule&quot;,” which stipulates that to earn the Producers Guild credit, a producer must have performed some real role in making the finished film. To justify his producer credit, Harvey claimed he took a leave of absence from his executive duties at Miramax Films to work on this movie, which longtime Miramax Films senior executive, Mark Gill, dismissed as “complete bullshit.”

Weinstein persuaded Ben Affleck to take a small role as Ned Alleyn. Kate Winslet was offered the role of Viola after the success of &quot;Titanic&quot;, but she rejected it to pursue independent films. Winona Ryder, Diane Lane and Robin Wright were also considered for the lead role.

Principal photography began on March 2, 1998, and ended on June 10, 1998.

The film was considerably reworked after the first test screenings. The scene with Shakespeare and Viola in the punt was re-shot, to make it more emotional, and some lines were re-recorded to clarify the reasons why Viola had to marry Wessex. The ending was re-shot several times, until Stoppard eventually came up with the idea of Viola suggesting to Shakespeare that their parting could inspire his next play.

Among the locations used in the production were Hatfield House, Hertfordshire (for the fireworks scene), Broughton Castle, Oxfordshire (which played the role of the de Lesseps mansion), the beach at Holkham in Norfolk, the chapel at Eton College, Berkshire, and the Great Hall of Middle Temple, London.

== References to Elizabethan literature ==
Much of the action of the film echoes that of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Will and Viola play out the famous balcony and bedroom scenes; like Juliet, Viola has a witty nurse, and is separated from Will by a gulf of duty (although not the family enmity of the play: the &quot;two households&quot; of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; are supposedly inspired by the two rival playhouses). In addition, the two lovers are equally &quot;star-crossed&quot;they are not ultimately destined to be together (since Viola is of rich and socially ambitious merchant stock and is promised to marry Lord Wessex, while Shakespeare himself is poor and already married). Rosaline, with whom Will is in love at the beginning of the film, is a namesake of Romeo&#x27;s love-interest at the beginning of the play. There are references to earlier cinematic versions of Shakespeare, such as the balcony scene pastiching the Zeffirelli &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

Many other plot devices used in the film are common in Shakespearean comedies and other plays of the Elizabethan era: the monarch moving unrecognized among the common people (cf. &quot;Henry V&quot;), the cross-dressing disguises, mistaken identities, the sword fight, the suspicion of adultery, the ostensible appearance of a ghost (cf. &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;), and the &quot;play within a play&quot;. According to Douglas Brode, the film deftly portrays many of these devices as though the events depicted were the inspiration for Shakespeare&#x27;s own use of them in his plays.

Christopher Marlowe is presented in the film as the master playwright whom the characters consider the greatest English dramatist of that time – this is historically accurate, yet also humorous, since the film&#x27;s audience knows what will eventually happen to Shakespeare&#x27;s reputation. Marlowe gives Shakespeare a plot for his next play, &quot;Romeo and Ethel the Pirate&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (&quot;Romeo is Italian...always in and out of love...until he meets...Ethel. The daughter of his enemy! His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel&#x27;s brother or something. His name is Mercutio.&quot;) Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; is quoted repeatedly: &quot;Was this the face that launched a thousand ships/ And burned the topless towers of Ilium?&quot; A reference is also made to Marlowe&#x27;s final, unfinished play &quot;The Massacre at Paris&quot; in a scene wherein Marlowe (Rupert Everett) seeks payment for the final act of the play from Richard Burbage (Martin Clunes). Burbage promises the payment the next day, so Marlowe refuses to part with the pages and departs for Deptford, where he is killed. The only surviving text of &quot;The Massacre at Paris&quot; is an undated octavo that is probably too short to represent the complete original play. It has been suggested that it is a memorial reconstruction by the actors who performed the work.

The child John Webster (Joe Roberts), who plays with rats, is a reference to a leading figure in the next, Jacobean, generation of playwrights. His plays (&quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;, &quot;The White Devil&quot;) are known for their &#x27;blood and gore&#x27;, which is humorously referred to by the child saying that he enjoys &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, and also saying of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, when asked his opinion by the Queen, &quot;I liked it when she stabbed herself.&quot; Likewise, the Thames waterman who ferries Shakespeare to the estate of Robert de Lesseps, and tries to get Shakespeare&#x27;s opinion of his own writing, references John Taylor.

When the clown Will Kempe (Patrick Barlow) says to Shakespeare that he would like to play in a drama, he is told that &quot;they would laugh at Seneca if you played it&quot;, a reference to the Roman tragedian renowned for his sombre and bloody plot lines which were a major influence on the development of English tragedy.

Will is shown signing a paper repeatedly, with many relatively illegible signatures visible. This is a reference to the fact that several versions of Shakespeare&#x27;s signature exist, and in each one he spelled his name differently.

== Plot precedents and similarities ==
After the film&#x27;s release, certain publications, including &quot;Private Eye&quot;, noted strong similarities between the film and the 1941 novel &quot;No Bed for Bacon&quot;, by Caryl Brahms and S. J. Simon, which also features Shakespeare falling in love and finding inspiration for his later plays. In a foreword to a subsequent edition of &quot;No Bed for Bacon&quot; (which traded on the association by declaring itself &quot;A Story of Shakespeare and Lady Viola in Love&quot;) Ned Sherrin, &quot;Private Eye&quot; insider and former writing partner of Brahms&#x27;, confirmed that he had lent a copy of the novel to Stoppard after he joined the writing team, but that the basic plot of the film had been independently developed by Marc Norman, who was unaware of the earlier work.

The film&#x27;s plot can claim a tradition in fiction reaching back to Alexandre Duval&#x27;s &quot;Shakespeare amoureux ou la Piece a l&#x27;Etude&quot; (1804), in which Shakespeare falls in love with an actress who is playing Richard III.

The writers of &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; were sued in 1999 by bestselling author Faye Kellerman. She claimed that the plotline was stolen from her 1989 novel &quot;The Quality of Mercy&quot;, in which Shakespeare romances a Jewish woman who dresses as a man, and attempts to solve a murder. Miramax Films spokesman Andrew Stengel derided the claim, filed in the US District Court six days before the 1999 Academy Awards, as &quot;absurd&quot;, and argued that the timing &quot;suggests a publicity stunt&quot;. An out-of-court settlement was reached, but the sum agreed between the parties indicates that the claim was &quot;unwarranted&quot;.

== Historical inaccuracies ==
The film is &quot;not constrained by worries about literary or historical accuracy&quot; and includes anachronisms such as a reference to Virginia tobacco plantations, at a time before the Colony of Virginia existed. Queen Elizabeth I never entered a public theatre, as she does in the film. Between &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, Shakespeare wrote ten other plays over a period of six years. Another historical liberty concerns the central theme of Shakespeare struggling to create the story of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, as in real life he simply adapted an existing story for theatre. Arthur Brooke translated the Italian verse tale &quot;The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet&quot; into English in 1562, 32 years before Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

A leading character is an Earl of Wessex, a title which in Shakespeare&#x27;s time had not existed for over 500 years. &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; reported that Prince Edward, Elizabeth II&#x27;s third son, was drawn to the earldom of Wessex, which became his title upon marriage, after watching the film and seeing the character.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; was among 1999&#x27;s box office number-one films in the United Kingdom. The U.S. and Canadian box office reached over $100 million and in the U.K. it grossed $34 million; including the box office from the rest of the world, the film took in over $289 million.

===Critical reception===
Rotten Tomatoes gives &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; a 92% approval rating based on 141 critical reviews, averaging 8.30/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;Endlessly witty, visually rapturous, and sweetly romantic, &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; is a delightful romantic comedy that succeeds on nearly every level.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 87 out of 100 based on 33 critical reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; made the film an &quot;NYT Critics&#x27; Pick&quot;, calling it &quot;pure enchantment&quot;. According to Maslin, &quot;Gwyneth Paltrow, in her first great, fully realized starring performance, makes a heroine so breathtaking that she seems utterly plausible as the playwright&#x27;s guiding light.&quot;

Roger Ebert, who gave the film four stars out of four, wrote: &quot;The contemporary feel of the humor (like Shakespeare&#x27;s coffee mug, inscribed &#x27;Souvenir of Stratford-Upon-Avon&#x27;) makes the movie play like a contest between &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; and Mel Brooks. Then the movie stirs in a sweet love story, juicy court intrigue, backstage politics and some lovely moments from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;... Is this a movie or an anthology? I didn&#x27;t care. I was carried along by the wit, the energy and a surprising sweetness.&quot;

Filmmaker David Cronenberg was critical of the film stating that it &quot;really annoyed me&quot; as it was &quot;deconstructionist film-making, but it&#x27;s also just &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; again&quot;.

&quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; claimed that the film prompted the revival of the title of Earl of Wessex. Prince Edward was originally to have been titled Duke of Cambridge following his marriage to Sophie Rhys-Jones in 1999, the year after the film&#x27;s release. However, after watching &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, he reportedly became attracted to the title of the character played by Colin Firth, and asked his mother Queen Elizabeth II to be given the title of Earl of Wessex instead.

==Awards and nominations==
===Oscar controversy===
&quot;Shakespeare In Love&quot; won the Best Picture Oscar at the 71st Academy Awards, controversially defeating critically favored &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and becoming the first comedy to win the award since &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977). The Academy&#x27;s decision was criticized by many for awarding the film over &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, and Gwyneth Paltrow winning Best Actress over frontrunner Cate Blanchett for &quot;Elizabeth&quot;.

Many industry pundits speculated that this win was attributed to the awards campaign led by Weinstein. Weinstein was reported to have strong-armed the movie&#x27;s talent into participating in an unprecedented blitzkrieg of press. Terry Press, an executive at DreamWorks at the time, stated that Weinstein and Miramax &quot;tried to get everybody to believe that &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; was all in the first 15 minutes&quot;. Mark Gill, an executive at Miramax at the time, claimed that Weinstein had a reliance on relatively cheap publicity. He stated, &quot;This was not saying to the stars, &#x27;O.K., you can go on a couple of talk shows to open the movie and do a weekend of interviews at a junket and thanks so much for helping, Gill said. &quot;That was just &#x27;Good morning. You&#x27;ve got three more months of shaking hands and kissing babies in you.

In 2015, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; magazine, stating it had interviewed hundreds of Academy members, indicated that, having to choose between &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, a majority of them would award the Oscar for Best Picture to the latter. (The same article stated that the results of four other Best Picture winners would also be different, referring to their survey as &quot;a referendum on what films have stood the test of time&quot;.) In 2020, Glenn Close stated in an interview with Peter Travers that she thought Paltrow winning Best Actress over Fernanda Montenegro for &quot;Central Station&quot; did not &quot;make sense&quot;. In response to that, Montenegro said she was grateful for Close&#x27;s praise, but thought the Oscar should have gone to Blanchett.

===Accolades===
In 2005, the Writers Guild of America ranked its script the 28th greatest ever written.

American Film Institute recognition:
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – #50

== Stage adaptation ==

=== Lee Hall&#x27;s &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; ===

In November 2011, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Disney Theatrical Productions intended to produce a stage version of the film in London with Sonia Friedman Productions. The production was officially announced in November 2013. Based on the film screenplay by Norman and Stoppard, it was adapted for the stage by Lee Hall. The production was directed by Declan Donnellan and designed by Nick Ormerod, the joint founders of Cheek by Jowl.

The production opened at the Noël Coward Theatre in London&#x27;s West End on 23 July 2014, receiving rave reviews from critics. It was called &quot;A joyous celebration of theatre&quot; in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Joyous&quot; in &quot;The Independent&quot;, and &quot;A love letter to theatre&quot; in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

===Japanese adaptation===
From December 2016 to January 2017, &quot;Shakespeare of True Love&quot; (), a Japanese adaptation of &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; written by Shigeki Motoiki and Sakurako Fukuyama, was produced in Kanagawa Arts Theatre. It was not related to Lee Hall&#x27;s play. Takaya Kamikawa played Will Shakespeare and Alisa Mizuki played Viola.

<doc id="88077" wikidata="Q120582" url="?curid=88077" title="Camille Claudel">
<text>Camille Rosalie Claudel (; 8 December 1864 19 October 1943) was a French sculptor known for her figurative works in bronze and marble. She died in relative obscurity, but later gained recognition for the originality and quality of her work. The subject of several biographies and films, Claudel is well known for her sculptures including &quot;The Waltz&quot; and &quot;The Mature Age&quot;.

The national Camille Claudel Museum in Nogent-sur-Seine opened in 2017. Claudel was a longtime associate of sculptor Auguste Rodin, and the Musée Rodin in Paris has a room dedicated to her works.

Sculptures created by Claudel are also held in the collections of several major museums including the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in Paris, the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C., the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles.

== Early years ==
Camille Claudel was born in Fère-en-Tardenois, Aisne, in northern France, the first child of a family of farmers and gentry. Her father, Louis-Prosper Claudel, dealt in mortgages and bank transactions. Her mother, the former Louise-Athanaïse Cécile Cerveaux, came from a Champagne family of Catholic farmers and priests. The family moved to Villeneuve-sur-Fère while Camille was still a baby. Her younger brother Paul Claudel was born there in 1868. Subsequently, they moved to Bar-le-Duc (1870), Nogent-sur-Seine (1876), and Wassy-sur-Blaise (1879), although they continued to spend summers in Villeneuve-sur-Fère, and the stark landscape of that region made a deep impression on the children.

From the ages of 5 to 12, Claudel was educated by the Sisters of Christian Doctrine. While living in Nogent-sur-Seine at age 12, Claudel began working with the local clay, regularly sculpting the human form.

As Camille grew older, she enriched her artistic education with literature and old engravings.

Her mother Louise did not approve of Claudel&#x27;s &quot;unladylike desire to become an artist.&quot; Her father was more supportive and took examples of her artwork to their artist neighbor Alfred Boucher, to assess her abilities. Boucher confirmed that Claudel was a capable, talented artist and encouraged her family to support her study of sculpture. Camille’s family proceeded to provided her with the same education as her brother, leading her to eventually reach a limitation in facilities in the area. Camille moved with her mother, brother, and younger sister to the Montparnasse area of Paris in 1881. Her father remained behind, working to support them.

== Creative period ==

===Study with Alfred Boucher===

Claudel was fascinated with stone and soil as a child, and as a young woman she studied at the Académie Colarossi, one of the few places open to female students. Once in Paris, she studied with sculptor Alfred Boucher. The Académie Colarossi was more progressive than other arts institutions in that it not only allowed female students at the school but also permitted them to work from nude male models. At the time, the barred women from enrolling to study.

In 1882, Claudel rented a studio workshop on rue Notre-Dame des Champs in Paris that she shared with three British sculptors: Jessie Lipscomb, Emily Fawcett and Amy Singer (daughter of John Webb Singer, whose foundry in Frome, Somerset, made large-scale bronze statues.) Boucher often came by the studio giving free lessons to the three sculptors multiple times a week. Several prominent Frome works are in London, including the &quot;Boadicea&quot; group on the Embankment, Cromwell, which graces the lawn in front of the Houses of Parliament, and the figure of Justice atop the Old Bailey. General Gordon on his camel at Chatham Barracks was also cast in Frome, as were the eight lions that form part of the Rhodes Memorial in Cape Town. Claudel visited Frome and the families of her fellow sculptors. All of these English friends had studied at the South Kensington Schools – that would become the Royal College of Art – before moving to Paris to be at the Academie Colarossi, where they had all met. Claudel prolonged her stay with Singer&#x27;s family in Frome.

Alfred Boucher had become Claudel&#x27;s mentor, and provided inspiration and encouragement to the next generation of sculptors such as Laure Coutan. Claudel was depicted by Boucher in &quot;Camille Claudel lisant&quot;, and later she sculpted a bust of her mentor.

After teaching Claudel and the other sculptors for over three years, Boucher moved to Florence following an award for the Grand Prix du Salon. Before he left he asked Auguste Rodin to take over the instruction of his pupils. Rodin and Claudel met, and their artistic association and the tumultuous and passionate relationship soon began.

===Auguste Rodin===
Claudel started working in Rodin&#x27;s workshop in 1883 and became a source of inspiration for him. Under Rodin’s guidance Claudel was able to perfect her own work in a variety of materials like plaster, bronze, marble, and onyx. She acted as his model, his confidante, and his lover. She never lived with Rodin, who was reluctant to end his 20-year relationship with Rose Beuret.

Knowledge of the affair agitated her family, especially her mother, who already detested her for not being a boy and never approved of Claudel&#x27;s involvement in the arts. As a consequence, Claudel was forced to leave the family home.

In 1891, Claudel served as a jurist at the National Society of Fine Arts, reported to be &quot;something of a boys&#x27; club at the time.&quot;

In 1892, after an abortion, Claudel ended the intimate aspect of her relationship with Rodin, although they saw each other regularly until 1898.

Le Cornec and Pollock state that after the sculptors&#x27; physical relationship ended, she was not able to get the funding to realise many of her daring ideas – because of sex-based censorship and the sexual element of her work. Claudel thus had either to depend on Rodin or to collaborate with him and see him get the credit as the lionised figure of French sculpture. She also depended on him financially, especially after her loving and wealthy father&#x27;s death, which allowed her mother and brother, who disapproved of her lifestyle, to maintain control of the family fortune and leave her to wander the streets dressed in beggars&#x27; clothing.

Claudel&#x27;s reputation survived not because of her once notorious association with Rodin, but because of her work. The novelist and art critic Octave Mirbeau described her as &quot;A revolt against nature: a woman genius.&quot; Her early work is similar to Rodin&#x27;s in spirit but shows imagination and lyricism quite her own, particularly in the famous &quot;The Waltz&quot; (1893).

The contemporary French critic Louis Vauxcelles stated that Claudel was the only sculptress on whose forehead shone the sign of genius like Berthe Morisot, the only well-known female painter of the century, and that Claudel&#x27;s style was more virile than many of her male colleagues&#x27;. Others, like Morhardt and Caranfa, concurred, saying that their styles had become so different, with Rodin being more soft and delicate and Claudel being vehement with vigorous contrasts, which might have been one reason for their break up, with her becoming ultimately his rival.

As historian Farah Peterson describes, Claudel&#x27;s &quot;Clotho,&quot; exhibited at the 1893 Salon of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, serves as an &quot;important example of how sharply Claudel’s vision diverged from Rodin’s.&quot;
Claudel depicted Clotho, one of the Three Fates in Greco-Roman mythology responsible for deciding human destiny, as a very elderly woman. Unlike Rodin and other male artists of the time, Claudel &quot;did not shy away from exploring the female grotesque;&quot; indeed, &quot;she could find power in grotesquerie.&quot; In this way, &quot;Clotho&quot; can be seen as exemplifying something rare and exhilarating: an &quot;utter indifference to the male gaze.&quot;

Claudel&#x27;s onyx and bronze small-scale &quot;La Vague (The Wave)&quot; (1897) was also conscious break in style from her Rodin period. It has a decorative quality quite different from the &quot;heroic&quot; feeling of her earlier work.

===&quot;The Mature Age&quot; and other works===


After Rodin saw Claudel&#x27;s &quot;The Mature Age&quot; for the first time, in 1899, he reacted with shock and anger. He suddenly and completely stopped his support for Claudel. According to Ayral-Clause, Rodin might have put pressure on the ministry of fine arts to cancel the funding for the bronze commission.

&quot;The Mature Age&quot; (1900) is usually interpreted as an allegory of the three stages of life: the man who represents Maturity is drawn into the hands of the old woman who represents Old Age and Death, while the young woman who represents Youth tries to save him. Her brother interpreted it as an allegory of her break with Rodin. Angelo Caranfa comments that &quot;The life that was, is, and will be in &quot;Maturity&quot; contains within its movement both the relentless movement of &quot;Clotho&quot; and the rhythmic, graceful, whirling movement of &quot;Fortune&quot;, generating a single and sustaining movement or image out of the differences within&quot; . According to Caranfa, &quot;Clotho&quot; (1893) and &quot;Fortune&quot; (1905) represent the two ideas of life: life in &quot;Clotho&quot; is portrayed as closed, hopeless existence and &quot;consummated in an unending death&quot;; life in &quot;Fortune&quot; is celebrated as the madness of eternal present with ups and downs, its &quot;rapture or total harmony&quot; (&quot;Fortune&quot; itself is a variation of the dancing woman in &quot;The Waltz&quot;). 

One of Claudel&#x27;s figures, &quot;The Implorer&quot;, was produced as an edition of its own and has been interpreted not as purely autobiographical but as an even more powerful representation of change and purpose in the human condition. Modelled for in 1898 and cast in 1905, Claudel didn&#x27;t actually cast her own bronze for this work, but instead &quot;The Implorer&quot; was cast in Paris by Eugene Blot.

Claudel&#x27;s masterful study of a young girl, &quot;La Petite Châtelaine,&quot; was completed in marble in 1895. Successive versions of &quot;La Petite Châtelaine&quot; demonstrate Claudel&#x27;s talent for carving in marble, a skill Rodin himself did not have. &quot;La Petite Châtelaine&quot; stands alone as a portrayal of young girlhood in 19th-century sculpture; &quot;there is no trace here of the pubescent figure with noticeable nipples or of the decorative, soft-cheeked cherub,&quot; Peterson observes.

In 1902 Claudel completed a large sculpture of &quot;Perseus and the Gorgon&quot;. Beginning in 1903, she exhibited her works at the Salon des Artistes français or at the Salon d&#x27;Automne.

&quot;Sakuntala&quot;, 1888, is described by Angelo Caranfa as expressing Claudel&#x27;s desire to reach the sacred, the fruit of the lifelong search of her artistic identity, free from Rodin&#x27;s constraints. Caranfa suggests that Claudel&#x27;s impressions of Rodin&#x27;s deceptions and exploitation of her, as someone who could not become obedient as he wanted her to be and who was expected to conform to society&#x27;s expectation of what women should be, were not false. Thus &quot;Sakuntala&quot; could be called a clear expression of her solitary existence and her inner search, her journey within.

In &quot;The Chatterboxes,&quot; Claudel depicted subject matter that was exceedingly rare in European sculpture at that time: &quot;platonic female intimacy, not as an excuse to display a breast or a hip for the onlooker, but as women actually experience it.&quot; The sculpture shows a group of three women listening to a story told by a fourth companion. Tellingly, in an 1893 letter to her brother Paul, Claudel emphasized that &quot;The Chatterboxes&quot; was &quot;no longer anything like Rodin.&quot;

Ayral-Clause says that even though Rodin clearly signed some of her works, he was not treating her as different because of her gender; artists at this time generally signed their apprentices&#x27; work. Others also criticise Rodin for not giving her the acknowledgment or support she deserved. Walker argues that most historians believe Rodin did what he could to help her after their separation, and that her destruction of her own oeuvre was partly responsible for the long-time neglect the art world showed her. Walker also says that what truly defeated Camille, who was already recognised as a leading sculptor by many, were the sheer difficulties of the medium and the market: sculpting was an expensive art, and she did not receive many official commissions because her style was highly unusual for the contemporary conservative tastes. Despite this, Le Cornec and Pollock believe she changed the history of arts.

Other authors write that it is still unclear how much Rodin influenced Claudel – and vice versa, how much credit has been taken away from her, or how much he was responsible for her woes. Most modern authors agree that she was an outstanding genius who, starting with wealth, beauty, iron will and a brilliant future even before meeting Rodin, was never rewarded and died in loneliness, poverty, and obscurity. Others like Elsen, Matthews and Flemming suggest it was not Rodin, but her brother Paul who was jealous of her genius, and that he conspired with her mother, who never forgave her for her supposed immorality, to later ruin her and keep her confined to a mental hospital. Kavaler-Adler notes that her younger sister Louise, who desired Camille&#x27;s inheritance and was also jealous of her, was delighted at her sister&#x27;s downfall.

Less well known than her love affair with Rodin, the nature of her relationship with Claude Debussy has also been the object of much speculation. Stephen Barr reports that Debussy pursued her: it was unknown whether they ever became lovers. They both admired Degas and Hokusai, and shared an interest in childhood and death themes. When Claudel ended the relationship, Debussy wrote: &quot;I weep for the disappearance of the Dream of this Dream.&quot; Debussy admired her as a great artist and kept a copy of &quot;The Waltz&quot; in his studio until his death. By thirty, Claudel&#x27;s romantic life had ended.

== Alleged mental illness and confinement ==

After 1905, Claudel appeared to be mentally ill. She destroyed many of her statues, disappeared for long periods of time, exhibited signs of paranoia and was diagnosed as having schizophrenia. She accused Rodin of stealing her ideas and of leading a conspiracy to kill her. After the wedding of her brother in 1906 and his return to China, she lived secluded in her workshop. Claudel&#x27;s father approved of her career choice, and he tried to help and support her financially. But when he died on 2 March 1913, Claudel was not informed of his death. Instead, eight days later, on 10 March 1913, at the request of her younger brother Paul, she was admitted to the psychiatric hospital of Ville-Évrard in Neuilly-sur-Marne.

The form read that she had been &quot;voluntarily&quot; committed, although her admission was signed only by a doctor and her brother. There are records to show that, while she did have mental outbursts, she was clear-headed while working on her art. Doctors tried to convince Paul and their mother that Claudel did not need to be in the institution, but they still kept her there. According to Cécile Bertran, a curator from the Musée Camille Claudel, the situation was not easy to judge, because modern experts who have looked at her records say she was indeed ill.

In 1914, to be safe from advancing German troops, the patients at Ville-Évrard were at first relocated to Enghien. On 7 September 1914, Claudel was transferred with a number of other women, to the Montdevergues Asylum, at Montfavet, six kilometres from Avignon. Her certificate of admittance to Montdevergues was signed on 22 September 1914; it reported that she suffered &quot;from a systematic persecution delirium mostly based upon false interpretations and imagination&quot;.

For a while, the press accused her family of committing a sculptor of genius. Her mother forbade her to receive mail from anyone other than her brother. The hospital staff regularly proposed to her family that Claudel be released, but her mother adamantly refused each time. On 1 June 1920, physician Dr. Brunet sent a letter advising her mother to try to reintegrate her daughter into the family environment. Nothing came of this. Paul Claudel visited his confined older sister seven times in 30 years, in 1913, 1920, 1925, 1927, 1933, 1936, and 1943. He always referred to her in the past tense. Their sister Louise visited her just one time in 1929. Her mother, who died in June 1929, never visited Claudel.

In 1929, sculptor and Claudel&#x27;s former friend Jessie Lipscomb visited her, and afterwards insisted &quot;it was not true&quot; that Claudel was insane. Rodin&#x27;s friend, Mathias Morhardt, insisted that Paul was a &quot;simpleton&quot; who had &quot;shut away&quot; his sister of genius.

Camille Claudel died on 19 October 1943, after having lived 30 years in the asylum at Montfavet (known then as the Asile de Montdevergues, now the modern psychiatric hospital Centre hospitalier de Montfavet). Her brother Paul had been informed of his sister&#x27;s terminal illness in September and, with some difficulty, had crossed Occupied France to see her, although he was not present at her death or funeral. Her sister did not make the journey to Montfavet.

Claudel was interred in the cemetery of Montfavet, and eventually her remains were buried in a communal grave at the asylum.
From the 2002 book, &quot;Camille Claudel, A Life&quot;: &quot;Ten years after her death, Camille&#x27;s bones had been transferred to a communal grave, where they were mixed with the bones of the most destitute. Joined forever to the ground she tried to escape for so long, Camille never, ever, returned to her beloved Villeneuve. Paul&#x27;s neglect regarding his sister&#x27;s grave is hard to forgive...while Paul decided not to be burdened with his sister&#x27;s grave, he took great pains, on the contrary, in choosing his own final resting place, naming the exact location – in Brangues, under a tree, next to his grandchild – and citing the precise words to be written on the stone. Today his admirers pay homage to his memory at his noble grave; but of Camille there is not a trace. In Villeneuve, a simple plaque reminds the curious visitor that Camille Claudel once lived there, but her remains are still in exile, somewhere, just a few steps away from the place where she was sequestered for thirty years.&quot;

== Legacy ==

=== Musée Camille Claudel ===


The Musée Camille Claudel was opened in March, 2017, as a French national museum dedicated to Claudel&#x27;s work. It is located in her teenage home town of Nogent-sur-Seine. The Musée Camille Claudel displays approximately half of Claudel&#x27;s 90 surviving works.

Plans to turn the Claudel family home at Nogent-sur-Seine into a museum were announced in 2003, and the museum negotiated with the Claudel family to buy Camille&#x27;s works. These include 70 pieces, including a bust of Rodin.

=== Surviving works ===

Though she destroyed much of her work, about 90 statues, sketches and drawings survive. She was at first censored as she portrayed sexuality in her work. Her response was a symbolic, intellectual style as opposed to the &quot;expressive&quot; approach normally attributed to women artists. In 1951, Paul Claudel organised an exhibition at the Musée Rodin, which continues to display her sculptures. A large exhibition of her works was organised in 1984. In 2005 a large art display featuring the works of Rodin and Claudel was exhibited in Quebec City (Canada), and Detroit, Michigan, in the US. In 2008, the Musée Rodin organised a retrospective exhibition including more than 80 of her works.

In 2005, Sotheby&#x27;s sold a second edition &quot;La Valse&quot; (1905, Blot, number 21) for $932,500. In a 2009 Paris auction, Claudel&#x27;s &quot;Le Dieu Envolé&quot; (1894/1998, foundry Valsuani, signed and numbered 6/8) had a high estimate of $180,000, while a comparable Rodin sculpture, &quot;L&#x27;éternelle Idole&quot; (1889/1930, Rudier, signed) had a high estimate of $75,000.

In 2023, The Art Institute of Chicago and the J. Paul Getty Museum co-organized a major retrospective of her work, featuring 60 sculptures from more than 30 institutional and private lenders. The show gathered many of her key compositions in terracotta, plaster, bronze, and stone. 

== Commemorations ==

=== In theatre and musicals ===

Some authors argue that Henrik Ibsen based his last play, 1899&#x27;s &quot;When We Dead Awaken&quot;, on Rodin&#x27;s relationship with Claudel.

The Seattle playwright S.P. Miskowski&#x27;s &quot;La Valse&quot; (2000) is a well-researched look at Claudel&#x27;s life.

In 2012, the world premiere of the play &quot;Camille Claudel&quot; took place. Written, performed and directed by Gaël Le Cornec, premiered at the Pleasance Courtyard Edinburgh Festival, the play looks at the relationship of master and muse from the perspective of Camille at different stages in her life.

The composer Frank Wildhorn and lyricist Nan Knighton&#x27;s musical &quot;Camille Claudel&quot; was produced by Goodspeed Musicals at The Norma Terris Theatre in Chester, Connecticut in 2003.

=== In film ===

The 1988 film &quot;Camille Claudel&quot; was a dramatisation of her life based largely on historical records. Directed by Bruno Nuytten, co-produced by Isabelle Adjani, starring Adjani as Claudel and Gérard Depardieu as Rodin, the film was nominated for two Academy Awards in 1989. Another film, &quot;Camille Claudel 1915&quot;, directed by Bruno Dumont and starring Juliette Binoche as Claudel, premiered at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival in 2013. The 2017 film &quot;Rodin&quot; co-stars Izïa Higelin as Claudel.

=== In music ===

The composer Jeremy Beck&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Little Girl with Doves&quot; (1998), an operatic soliloquy for soprano and orchestra, is based on the life and letters of Camille Claudel. This composition has been recorded by Rayanne Dupuis, soprano, with the Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra. Beck&#x27;s composition has been described as &quot;a deeply attractive and touching piece of writing ... [demonstrating] imperious melodic confidence, fluent emotional command and yielding tenderness.&quot;

=== In dance ===
In 2011, the world premiere of Boris Eifman&#x27;s new ballet &quot;Rodin&quot; took place in St Petersburg, Russia. The ballet is dedicated to the life and creative work of sculptor Auguste Rodin and his apprentice, lover and muse, Camille Claudel.

In 2014, the Columbus Dance Theatre and the Carpe Diem String Quartet performed the premiere of &quot;Claudel&quot; in Columbus, Ohio, with music by Korine Fujiwara, original poetry by Kathleen Kirk, and choreography by Tim Veach.

In 2021, Australian choreographer Meryl Tankard choreographed &quot;Claudel&quot; for the Sydney Opera House, presented by Tinderbox Productions. The ballet was written and directed by playwright Wendy Beckett, and is based on the life of Claudel and her relationship with Rodin.

=== In literature ===

In 1982, the publication of the fictionalized biography &quot;Une femme&quot;, by author Anne Delbée, sparked a resurgence of interest in her work.

A 2015 novel by Carol Bruneau, &quot;These Good Hands&quot;, imagines the end of Claudel&#x27;s life in 1943, through the relationship with her caregiving nurse.

<text>Prostate cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system below the bladder. Abnormal growth of the prostate tissue is usually detected through screening tests, typically blood tests that check for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Those with high levels of PSA in their blood are at increased risk for developing prostate cancer. Diagnosis requires a biopsy of the prostate. If cancer is present, the pathologist assigns a Gleason score; a higher score represents a more dangerous tumor. Medical imaging is performed to look for cancer that has spread outside the prostate. Based on the Gleason score, PSA levels, and imaging results, a cancer case is assigned a stage 1 to 4. A higher stage signifies a more advanced, more dangerous disease.

Most prostate tumors remain small and cause no health problems. These are managed with active surveillance, monitoring the tumor with regular tests to ensure it has not grown. Tumors more likely to be dangerous can be destroyed with radiation therapy or surgically removed by radical prostatectomy. Those whose cancer spreads beyond the prostate are treated with hormone therapy which reduces levels of the androgens (male sex hormones) that prostate cells need to survive. Eventually cancer cells can grow resistant to this treatment. This most-advanced stage of the disease, called castration-resistant prostate cancer, is treated with continued hormone therapy alongside the chemotherapy drug docetaxel. Some tumors metastasize (spread) to other areas of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes. There, tumors cause severe bone pain, leg weakness or paralysis, and eventually death. Prostate cancer prognosis depends on how far the cancer has spread at diagnosis. Most men diagnosed have low-risk tumors confined to the prostate; 99% of them survive more than 10 years from their diagnoses. Tumors that have metastasized to distant body sites are most dangerous, with five-year survival rates of 30–40%.

The risk of developing prostate cancer increases with age; the average age of diagnosis is 67. Those with a family history of any cancer are more likely to have prostate cancer, particularly those who inherit cancer-associated variants of the &quot;BRCA2&quot; gene. Each year 1.2 million cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed, and 350,000 die of the disease, making it the second-leading cause of cancer and cancer death in men. One in eight men is diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime and one in forty dies of the disease. Prostate tumors were first described in the mid-19th century, during surgeries on men with urinary obstructions. Initially, prostatectomy was the primary treatment for prostate cancer. By the mid-20th century, radiation treatments and hormone therapies were developed to improve prostate cancer treatment. The invention of hormone therapies for prostate cancer was recognized with the 1966 Nobel Prize to Charles B. Huggins and the 1977 Prize to Andrzej W. Schally.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Early prostate cancer usually causes no symptoms. As the cancer advances, it may cause erectile dysfunction, blood in the urine or semen, or trouble urinating – commonly including frequent urination and slow or weak urine stream. More than half of men over age 50 experience some form of urination problem, typically due to issues other than prostate cancer such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate).

Advanced prostate tumors can metastasize to nearby lymph nodes and bones, particularly in the pelvis, hips, spine, ribs, head, and neck. There they can cause fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and back or bone pain that does not improve with rest. Metastases can damage the bones around them, and around a quarter of those with metastatic prostate cancer develop a bone fracture. Growing metastases can also compress the spinal cord causing weakness in the legs and feet, or limb paralysis.

== Screening ==

Most cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed through screening tests, when tumors are too small to cause any symptoms. This is done through blood tests to measure levels of the protein prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which are elevated in those with enlarged prostates, whether due to prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia. The typical man&#x27;s blood has around 1 nanogram (ng) of PSA per milliliter (mL) of blood tested. Those with PSA levels below average are very unlikely to develop dangerous prostate cancer over the next 8 to 10 years. Men with PSA levels above 4 ng/mL are at increased risk – around 1 in 4 will develop prostate cancer – and are often referred for a prostate biopsy. PSA levels over 10 ng/mL indicate an even higher risk: over half of men in this group develop prostate cancer. Men with high PSA levels are often recommended to repeat the blood test four to six weeks later, as PSA levels can fluctuate unrelated to prostate cancer. Benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate infection, recent ejaculation, and some urological procedures can increase PSA levels; taking 5α-reductase inhibitors can decrease PSA levels.

Those with elevated PSA may undergo secondary screening blood tests that measure subtypes of PSA and other molecules to better predict the likelihood that a person will develop aggressive prostate cancer. Many measure &quot;free PSA&quot; – the fraction of PSA unbound to other blood proteins, usually around 10% to 30%. Men who have a lower percentage of free PSA are more likely to have prostate cancer. Several common tests more accurately detect prostate cancer cases by also measuring subtypes of free PSA, including the Prostate Health Index (measures a fragment called −2proPSA) and 4K score (measures intact free PSA). Other tests measure blood levels of additional prostate-related proteins such as kallikrein-2 (also measured by 4K score), or urine levels of mRNA molecules common to prostate tumors like PCA3 and TMPRSS2 fused to ERG.

Several large studies have found that men screened for prostate cancer have a reduced risk of dying from the disease; however, detection of cancer cases that would not have otherwise impacted health can cause anxiety, and lead to unneeded biopsies and treatments, both of which can cause unwanted complications. Major national health organizations offer differing recommendations, attempting to balance the benefits of early diagnosis with the potential harms of treating people whose tumors are unlikely to impact health. Most medical guidelines recommend that men at high risk of prostate cancer (due to age, family history, ethnicity, or prior evidence of high blood PSA levels) be counseled on the risks and benefits of PSA testing, and be offered access to screening tests. Medical guidelines generally recommend against screening for men over age 70, or with a life expectancy of less than 10 years, as a newly diagnosed prostate cancer is unlikely to impact their natural lifespan. Uptake of screening varies by geography – more than 80% of men are screened in the US and Western Europe, 20% of men in Japan, and screening is rare in regions with a low Human Development Index.

== Diagnosis ==
Men suspected of having prostate cancer may undergo several tests to assess the prostate. One common procedure is the digital rectal examination, in which a doctor inserts a lubricated finger into the rectum to feel the nearby prostate. Tumors feel like stiff, irregularly shaped lumps against the rest of the prostate. Hardening of the prostate can also be due to benign prostatic hyperplasia; around 20–25% of those with abnormal findings on their rectal exams have prostate cancer. Several urological societies&#x27; guidelines recommend magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the prostate for potential tumors in men with high PSA levels. MRI results can help distinguish those who have potentially dangerous tumors from those who do not.

A definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer requires a biopsy of the prostate. Prostate biopsies are typically taken by a needle passing through the rectum or perineum, guided by transrectal ultrasonography, MRI, or a combination of the two. Ten to twelve samples are taken from several regions of the prostate to improve the chances of finding any tumors. Biopsies are sent for a histopathologic diagnosis of prostate cancer, wherein they are examined under a microscope by a pathologist, who determines the type and extent of cancerous cells present. Cancers are first classified based on their appearance under a microscope. Over 95% of prostate cancers are classified as adenocarcinomas (resembling gland tissue), with the rest largely squamous-cell carcinoma (resembling squamous cells, a type of epithelial cell) and transitional cell carcinoma (resembling transitional cells).

Next, tumor samples are graded based on how much the tumor tissue differs from normal prostate tissue; the more different the tumor appears, the faster the tumor is likely to grow. The Gleason grading system is commonly used, where the pathologist assigns numbers ranging from 3 (most similar to healthy prostate tissue) to 5 (least similar) to different regions of the biopsied tissue. They then calculate a &quot;Gleason score&quot; by adding the two numbers that represent the largest areas of the biopsy sample. The lowest possible Gleason score of 6 represents a biopsy most similar to healthy prostate; the highest Gleason score of 10 represents the most severely cancerous. Gleason scores are commonly grouped into &quot;Gleason grade groups&quot;, which predict disease prognosis: a Gleason score of 6 is Gleason grade group 1 (best prognosis). A score of 7 (with Gleason scores 4 + 3, or Gleason scores 3 + 4, with the most prominent listed first) can be grade group 2 or 3; it is grade group 2 if the less severe Gleason score (3) covered more area; grade group 3 if the more severe Gleason score (4) covered more area. A score of 8 is grade group 4. A score of 9 or 10 is grade group 5 (worst prognosis).

The extent of cancer spread is assessed by MRI or PSMA scan – a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technique where a radioactive label that binds the prostate protein prostate-specific membrane antigen is used to detect metastases distant from the prostate. CT scans may also be used, but are less able to detect spread outside the prostate than MRI. Bone scintigraphy is used to test for spread of cancer to bones.

=== Staging ===

After diagnosis, the tumor is staged to determine the extent of its growth and spread. Prostate cancer is typically staged using the American Joint Committee on Cancer&#x27;s (AJCC) three-component TNM system, with scores assigned for the extent of the tumor (T), spread to any lymph nodes (N), and the presence of metastases (M). Scores of T1 and T2 represent tumors that remain within the prostate: T1 is for tumors not detectable by imaging or digital rectal exam; T2 is for tumors detectable by imaging or rectal exam, but still confined within the prostate. T3 is for tumors that grow beyond the prostate – T3a for tumors with any extension outside the prostate; T3b for tumors that invade the adjacent seminal vesicles. T4 is for tumors that have grown into organs beyond the seminal vesicles. The N and M scores are binary (yes or no). N1 represents any spread to the nearby lymph nodes. M1 represents any metastases to other body sites.

The AJCC then combines the TNM scores, Gleason grade group, and results of the PSA blood test to categorize cancer cases into one of four stages, and their subdivisions. Cancer cases with localized tumors (T1 or T2), no spread (N0 and M0), Gleason grade group 1, and PSA less than 10 ng/mL are designated stage I. Those with localized tumors and PSA between 10 and 20 ng/mL are designated stage II – subdivided into IIA for Gleason grade group 1, IIB for grade group 2, and IIC for grade group 3 or 4. Stage III is the designation for any of three higher risk factors: IIIA is for a PSA level about 20 ng/mL; IIIB is for T3 or T4 tumors; IIIC is for a Gleason grade group of 5. Stage IV is for cancers that have spread to lymph nodes (N1, stage IVA) or other organs (M1, stage IVB).
The United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends a five-stage system based on disease prognosis called the Cambridge Prognostic Group, with prognostic groups CPG 1 to CPG 5. CPG 1 is the same as AJCC stage I. Cases with localized tumors (T1 or T2) and either Gleason grade group 2 or higher PSA levels (10 to 20 ng/mL) are designated CPG 2. CPG 3 represents either Gleason grade group 3, or the combination of the CPG 2 criteria. CPG 4 is similar to AJCC stage 3 – any of Gleason grade group 4, PSA levels above 20 ng/mL, or a tumor that has grown beyond the prostate (T3). CPG 5 is for the highest risk cases: either a T4 tumor, Gleason grade group 5, or any two of the CPG 4 criteria.

== Prevention ==
No drug or vaccine is approved by regulatory agencies for the prevention of prostate cancer. Several studies have shown 5α-reductase inhibitors – both finasteride and dutasteride, which are used to treat non-cancerous enlarged prostate – to reduce the total incidence of prostate cancer; however, it is unclear whether they reduce any cases of dangerous disease.

== Management ==

Treatment of prostate cancer varies based on how advanced the cancer is, the risk it may spread, and the affected person&#x27;s health and personal preferences. Those with localized disease at low risk for spread are often more likely to be harmed by the side effects of treatment than the disease itself, and so are regularly tested for a worsening of their disease. Those at higher risk may receive treatment to eliminate the tumor – typically prostatectomy (surgery to remove the prostate) or radiation therapy, sometimes alongside hormone therapy. Those with metastatic disease are treated with chemotherapy, as well as radiation or other agents to alleviate the symptoms of metastatic tumors. Blood PSA levels are monitored every few months to assess the effectiveness of treatments, and whether the disease is recurring or advancing.

=== Localized disease ===

Men diagnosed with low-risk cases of prostate cancer often defer treatment and are monitored regularly for cancer progression by active surveillance, which involves testing for tumor growth at fixed intervals by PSA tests (around every six months), digital rectal exam (annually), and MRI or repeat biopsies (every one to three years). This program continues until increases in PSA levels, Gleason grade, or tumor size indicate a higher-risk tumor that may require intervention. At least half of men remain on active surveillance, never requiring more direct treatment for their prostate tumors.

Those who elect to have therapy receive radiation therapy or a prostatectomy; these have similar rates of cancer control, but different side effects. Radiation can be delivered by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), which allows for high doses (greater than 80 Gy) to be delivered to the prostate with relatively little radiation to other organs, or by brachytherapy, where a radioactive source is surgically inserted into the prostate. IMRT is given over several sessions, with treatments repeated five days per week for several weeks. Brachytherapy is typically performed in a single session, with the radioactive source permanently implanted into the prostate, where it expends its radioactivity within the next few months. With either technique, radiation damage to nearby organs can increase the risk of subsequent bladder cancer and cause erectile dysfunction, infertility, irreversible lumbar plexopathy and radiation proctitis – damage to the rectum that can cause diarrhea, bloody stools, fecal incontinence, and pain.
Radical prostatectomy aims to surgically remove the cancerous part of the prostate, along with the seminal vesicles, and the end of the vas deferens (the duct that delivers sperm from the testes). In wealthier countries, this is typically done by robot-assisted surgery, where robotic tools inserted through small holes in the abdomen allow a surgeon to make small and exact movements during surgery. This method results in shorter hospital stays, less blood loss, and fewer complications than traditional open surgery. In places where robot-assisted surgery is unavailable, prostatectomy can be performed laparoscopically (using a camera and hand tools through small holes in the abdomen), or through traditional open surgery with an incision above the penis (retropubic approach) or below the scrotum (perineal approach). The four approaches result in similar rates of cancer control. Damage to nearby tissue during surgery can result in erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. Erectile dysfunction is more likely in those who are older or had previous erectile issues. Incontinence is more common in those who are older and have shorter urethras. Both for cancer progression outcomes and surgical side effects, the skill and experience of the individual surgeon doing the procedure are among the greatest determinants of success.

After prostatectomy, PSA levels drop rapidly, reaching very low or undetectable levels within two months. Radiotherapy also substantially reduces PSA levels, but more slowly and less completely, with PSA levels reaching their nadir two years after radiotherapy. After either treatment, PSA levels are monitored regularly. Up to half of those treated will eventually have a rise in PSA levels, suggesting the tumor or small metastases are growing again. People with high or rising PSA levels are often offered another round of radiation therapy directed at the former tumor site. This reduces risk for further progression by 75%. Those suspected of metastases can undergo PET scanning with sensitive radiotracers C-11 choline, F-18 fluciclovine, and F-18 or Ga-68 attached to a PSMA-targeting drug, each of which is able to detect small metastases more sensitively than alternative imaging methods.

=== Metastatic disease ===

For those with metastatic disease, the standard of care is androgen deprivation therapy (also called &quot;chemical castration&quot;), drugs that reduce levels of androgens (male sex hormones) that prostate cells require to grow. Various drugs are used to lower androgen levels by blocking the synthesis or action of testosterone, the primary androgen. The first line of treatment typically involves GnRH agonists like leuprolide, goserelin, or triptorelin by injection monthly or less frequently as needed. GnRH agonists cause a brief rise in testosterone levels at treatment initiation, which can worsen disease in people with significant symptoms of metastases. In these people, GnRH antagonists like degarelix or relugolix are given instead, and can also rapidly reduce testosterone levels. Reducing testosterone can cause various side effects, including hot flashes, reduction in muscle mass and bone density, reduced sex drive, fatigue, personality changes, and an increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and depression. Hormone therapy halts tumor growth in more than 95% of those treated, and PSA levels return to normal in up to 70%.

Despite reduced testosterone levels, metastatic prostate tumors eventually continue to grow – manifested by rising blood PSA levels, and metastases to nearby bones. This is the most advanced stage of the disease, called castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC tumors continuously evolve resistance to treatments, necessitating several lines of therapy, each used in sequence to extend survival. The standard of care is the chemotherapy docetaxel along with antiandrogen drugs, namely the androgen receptor antagonists enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide, as well as the testosterone production inhibitor abiraterone acetate. An alternative is the cell therapy procedure Sipuleucel-T, where the affected person&#x27;s immune cells are removed, treated to more effectively target prostate cancer cells, and re-injected. Tumors that evolve resistance to docetaxel may receive the second-generation taxane drug cabazitaxel.

Some CRPC treatments are used only in men whose tumors have certain characteristics that make the therapy more likely to be effective. Men whose tumors express the protein PSMA may receive the radiopharmaceutical Lu-177 PSMA, which binds to and destroys PSMA-positive cells. Those whose tumors have defective DNA damage repair benefit from treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor drug pembrolizumab and PARP inhibitors, namely olaparib, rucaparib, or niraparib.

=== Supportive care ===

Bone metastases – present in around 85% of those with metastatic prostate cancer – are the primary cause of symptoms and death from metastatic prostate cancer. Those with constant pain are prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, people with bone metastases can experience &quot;breakthrough pain&quot;, sudden bursts of severe pain that resolve within around 15 minutes, before pain medications can take effect. Single sites of pain can be treated with external beam radiation therapy to shrink nearby tumors. More dispersed bone pain can be treated with radioactive compounds that disproportionately accumulate in bone, like radium-223 and samarium-153-EDTMP, which help reduce the size of bone tumors. Similarly, the systemic chemotherapeutics used for metastatic prostate cancer can reduce pain as they shrink tumors. Other bone modifying agents like zoledronic acid and denosumab can reduce prostate cancer bone pain, even though they have little effect on tumor size. Metastases compress the spinal cord in up to 12% of those with metastatic prostate cancer causing pain, weakness, numbness, and paralysis. Inflammation in the spine can be treated with high-dose steroids, as well as surgery and radiotherapy to shrink spinal tumors and relieve pressure on the spinal cord.

Those with advanced prostate cancer suffer fatigue, lethargy, and a generalized weakness. This is caused in part by gastrointestinal problems, with loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, and constipation all common. These are typically treated with appetite-increasing drugs – megestrol acetate or corticosteroids – antiemetics, or treatments that focus on underlying gastrointestinal issues. General weakness can also be caused by anemia, itself caused by a combination of the disease itself, poor nutrition, and damage to the bone marrow from cancer treatments or bone metastases. Anemia can be treated in various ways depending on the cause, or can be addressed directly with blood transfusions. Organ damage and metastases in the lymph nodes can lead to uncomfortable accumulation of fluid (called lymphedema) in the genitals or lower limbs. These swellings can be extremely painful, curtailing an affected person&#x27;s ability to urinate, have sex, or walk normally. Lymphedema can be treated by applying pressure to aid drainage, surgically draining pooled fluid, and cleaning and treating nearby damaged skin.

People with prostate cancer are around twice as likely to experience anxiety or depression compared to those without cancer. When added to normal prostate cancer treatments, psychological interventions such as psychoeducation and cognitive behavioral therapy can help reduce anxiety, depression, and general distress.

As those severely ill with metastatic prostate cancer approach the end of their lives, most experience confusion and may hallucinate or have trouble recognizing loved ones. Confusion is caused by various conditions, including kidney failure, sepsis, dehydration, and as a side effect of various drugs, especially opioids. Most people sleep for long periods, and some feel drowsy when awake. Restlessness is also common, sometimes caused by physical discomfort from constipation or urinary retention, sometimes caused by anxiety. In their last few days, affected men&#x27;s breathing may become shallow and slow, with long pauses between breaths. Breathing may be accompanied by a rattling noise as fluid lingers in the throat, but this is not uncomfortable for the affected person. Their hands and feet may cool to the touch, and skin become blotchy or blue due to weaker blood circulation. Many stop eating and drinking, resulting in dry-feeling mouth, which can be aided by moistening the mouth and lips. The person becomes less and less responsive, and eventually the heart and breathing stop.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis of diagnosed prostate cancer varies widely based on the cancer&#x27;s grade and stage at the time of diagnosis; those with lower stage disease have vastly improved prognoses. Around 80% of prostate cancer diagnoses are in men whose cancer is still confined to the prostate. These men can survive long after diagnosis, with as many as 99% still alive 10 years from diagnosis. Men whose cancer has metastasized to a nearby part of the body (around 15% of diagnoses) have poorer prognoses, with five-year survival rates of 60–80%. Those with metastases in distant body sites (around 5% of diagnoses) have relatively poor prognoses, with five-year survival rates of 30–40%.

Those who have low blood PSA levels at diagnosis, and whose tumors have a low Gleason grade and less-advanced clinical stage tend to have better prognoses. After prostatectomy or radiotherapy, those who have a short time between treatment and a subsequent rise in PSA levels, or quickly rising PSA levels are more likely to die from their cancers. Castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer is incurable, and kills a majority of those whose disease reaches this stage.

== Cause ==
Prostate cancer is caused by the accumulation of genetic mutations to the DNA of cells in the prostate. These mutations affect genes involved in cell growth, replication, cell death, and DNA damage repair. With these processes dysregulated, some cells replicate abnormally, forming a clump of cells called a tumor. As the tumor grows, its cells accumulate more mutations, allowing it to stimulate the growth of new blood vessels to support further growth. Eventually, a tumor can grow large enough to invade nearby organs such as the seminal vesicles or bladder. In advanced tumors, cells can develop the ability to detach from their original tissue site, and evade the immune system. These cells can spread through the lymphatic system to nearby lymph nodes, or through the bloodstream to the bone marrow and (more rarely) other body sites. At these new sites, the cancer cells disrupt normal body function and continue to grow. Metastases cause most of the discomfort associated with prostate cancer, and can eventually kill the affected person.

== Pathophysiology ==

Most prostate tumors begin in the peripheral zone – the outermost part of the prostate. As cells begin to grow out of control, they form a small clump of disregulated cells called a prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Some PINs continue to grow, forming layers of tissue that stop expressing genes common to their original tissue location – p63, cytokeratin 5, and cytokeratin 14 – and instead begin expressing genes typical of cells in the innermost lining of the pancreatic duct – cytokeratin 8 and cytokeratin 18. These multilayered PINs also often overexpress the gene AMACR, which is associated with prostate cancer progression.

Some PINs can eventually grow into tumors. This is commonly accompanied by large-scale changes to the genome, with chromosome sequences being rearranged or copied repeatedly. Some genomic alterations are particularly common in early prostate cancer, namely gene fusion between TMPRSS2 and the oncogene ERG (up to 60% of prostate tumors), mutations that disable SPOP (up to 15% of tumors), and mutations that hyperactivate FOXA1 (up to 5% of tumors).

Metastatic prostate cancer tends to have more genetic mutations than localized disease. Many of these mutations are in genes that protect from DNA damage, such as p53 (mutated in 8% of localized tumors, more than 27% of metastatic ones) and RB1 (1% of localized tumors, more than 5% of metastatic ones). Similarly mutations in the DNA repair-related genes BRCA2 and ATM are rare in localized disease but found in at least 7% and 5% of metastatic disease cases respectively.

The transition from castrate-sensitive to castrate-resistant prostate cancer is also accompanied by the acquisition of various gene mutations. In castrate-resistant disease, more than 70% of tumors have mutations in the androgen receptor signaling pathway – amplifications and gain-of-function mutations in the receptor gene itself, amplification of its activators (for example, FOXA1), or inactivating mutations in its negative regulators (for example, ZBTB16 and NCOR1). These androgen receptor disruptions are only found in up to 6% of biopsies of castrate-sensitive metastatic disease. Similarly, deletions of the tumor suppressor PTEN are harbored by 12–17% of castrate-sensitive tumors, but over 40% of castrate-resistant tumors. Less commonly, tumors have aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway via disruption of members APC (9% of tumors) or CTNNB1 (4% of tumors); or dysregulation of the PI3K pathway via PI3KCA/PI3KCB mutations (6% of tumors) or AKT1 (2% of tumors).

== Epidemiology ==
Prostate cancer is the second-most frequently diagnosed cancer in men, and the second-most frequent cause of cancer death in men (after lung cancer). Around 1.2 million new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed each year, and over 350,000 people die of the disease, annually. One in eight men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, and around one in forty die of the disease. Rates of prostate cancer rise with age. Due to this, prostate cancer rates are generally higher in parts of the world with higher life expectancy, which also tend to be areas with higher gross domestic product and higher human development index. Australia, Europe, North America, New Zealand, and parts of South America have the highest incidence. South Asia, Central Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa have the lowest incidence of prostate cancer; though incidence is increasing quickly in these regions. Prostate cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in men in over half of the world&#x27;s countries, and the leading cause of cancer death in men in around a quarter of countries.

Prostate cancer is rare in those under 40 years old, and most cases occur in those over 60 years, with the average person diagnosed at 67. The average age of those who die from prostate cancer is 77. Only a minority of prostate cancer cases are diagnosed. Autopsies of men who died at various ages have shown cancer in the prostates of over 40% of men over age 50. Incidence rises with age, and nearly 70% of men autopsied at age 80–89 had cancer in their prostates.

=== Genetics ===
Prostate cancer is more common in families with a history of any cancer. Men with an affected first-degree relative (father or brother) have more than twice the risk of developing prostate cancer, and those with two first-degree relatives have a five-fold greater risk compared with men with no family history. Increased risk also runs in some ethnic groups, with men of African and African-Caribbean ancestry at particularly high risk – having prostate cancer at higher rates, and having more-aggressive prostate cancers that develop at earlier ages. Large genome-wide association studies have identified over 100 gene variants associated with increased prostate cancer risk. The greatest risk increase is associated with variations in BRCA2 (up to an eight-fold increased risk) and HOXB13 (three-fold increased risk), both of which are involved in repairing DNA damage. Variants in other genes involved in DNA damage repair have also been associated with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer – particularly early-onset prostate cancer – including BRCA1, ATM, NBS1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, CHEK2, RAD51D, and PALB2. Additionally, variants in the genome near the oncogene MYC are associated with increased risk. As are single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor common in African-Americans, and in the androgen receptor, CYP3A4, and CYP17 involved in testosterone synthesis and signaling. Together, known gene variants are estimated to cause around 25% of prostate cancer cases, including 40% of early-onset prostate cancers.

=== Body and lifestyle ===
Men who are taller are at a slightly increased risk for developing prostate cancer, as are men who are obese. High levels of blood cholesterol are also associated with increased prostate cancer risk; consequently, those who take the cholesterol-lowering drugs, statins, have a reduced risk of advanced prostate cancer. Chronic inflammation can cause various cancers. Potential links between infection (or other sources of inflammation) and prostate cancer have been studied but none definitively found, and one large study found no link between prostate cancer and a history of gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, or infection with various human papillomaviruses.

Regular vigorous exercise may reduce one&#x27;s chance of developing advanced prostate cancer, as can several dietary interventions. Those with a diet rich in cruciferous vegetables (certain leafy greens, broccoli, and cauliflower), fish, genistein (found in soy), or lycopene (found in tomatoes) are at a reduced risk of symptomatic prostate cancer. Conversely, those who consume high levels of dietary fats, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (from cooking red meats), or calcium may be at an increased risk of developing advanced prostate cancer. Several dietary supplements have been studied and found not to impact prostate cancer risk, including selenium, vitamin C, vitamin D, and vitamin E.

== Special populations ==
Transgender women and gender non-conforming people who have prostates can develop prostate cancer. Those who have undergone gender-affirming hormone therapy or gender-affirming surgery have reduced risk of developing prostate cancer, relative to cisgender men of similar age. Screening tests in this group are complicated, as transgender women may have lower PSA levels than cisgender men due to their reduced testosterone levels. PSA levels greater than 1 ng/mL are generally considered above normal by gender care specialists. Digital rectal exams of the prostate are often impossible in women who have undergone vaginoplasty, as the length and rigidity of the new vagina can obstruct access to the prostate from the rectum.

== History ==
A prostate mass was first described in 1817 by the English surgeon George Langstaff, following the autopsy of a man who had died at age 68 with lower-body pain and urinary issues. In 1853, London Hospital surgeon John Adams described another prostate tumor from a man who had died with urinary issues; Adams had a pathologist examine the tumor, providing the first confirmed case of a cancerous tumor in the prostate. The disease was initially rarely described; an 1893 report found only 50 cases described in the medical literature. Around the turn of the 19th century, prostate surgery to relieve urinary obstruction became more common, allowing surgeons and pathologists to examine the removed prostate tissue. Two studies around the time found cancer in as many as 10% of surgical specimens, suggesting prostate cancer was a fairly common cause of prostate enlargement.

For much of the 20th century, the primary therapy for prostate cancer was surgery to remove the prostate. Perineal prostatectomy was first performed in 1904 by Hugh H. Young at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Young&#x27;s method became the widespread standard, initially done primarily to relieve symptoms of urinary blockage. In 1931 a new surgical method, transurethral resection of the prostate, became available, replacing perineal prostatectomy for symptomatic relief of obstruction. In 1945, Terence Millin described a retropubic prostatectomy approach, which provided easier access to pelvic lymph nodes to assist in staging the extent of disease, and was easier for surgeons to learn. This was improved upon by Patrick C. Walsh&#x27;s 1983 description of a retropubic prostatectomy approach that avoided damage to the nerves near the prostate, preserving erectile function.

Radiation therapy for prostate cancer was used occasionally in the early 20th century, with radium implanted into the urethra or rectum to reduce the tumor size and associated symptoms. In the 1950s the advent of more powerful radiation machines allowed for external beam radiotherapy to reach the prostate. By the 1960s, this was often combined with hormone therapy to improve the potency of therapy. In the 1970s, Willet Whitmore pioneered an open surgery technique where needles of Iodine-125 were placed directly into the prostate. This was improved upon by Henrik H. Holm in 1983 by using transrectal ultrasound to guide the implantation of radioactive material.

The observation that the testicles (and the hormones they secrete) influence prostate size was made as early as the late 18th century via castration experiments in animals. However, occasional experimentation over the next century bore mixed results, likely due to the inability to separate prostate tumors from prostates enlarged due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. In 1941, Charles B. Huggins and Clarence V. Hodges published two studies using surgical castration or oral estrogen to reduce androgen levels and improve prostate cancer symptoms. Huggins was awarded the 1966 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this discovery, the first systemic therapy for prostate cancer. In the 1960s, large studies showed estrogen therapy to be as effective as surgical castration at treating prostate cancer, but that those on estrogen therapy were at increased risk of suffering blood clots. Through the 1980s, Andrzej W. Schally&#x27;s studies of GnRH led to the development of GnRH agonists, which were found to be as effective as estrogen without the increased risk of clotting. Schally was awarded the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on GnRH and prostate cancer.

Systemic chemotherapy for prostate cancer has been studied since the 1950s but clinical trials failed to show benefits in most people who receive the drugs. In 1996, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the systemic chemotherapy mitoxantrone for those with castration-resistant prostate cancer based on trials showing that it improved symptoms even though it failed to enhance survival. In 2004, docetaxel was approved as the first chemotherapy to increase survival in those with castration-resistant prostate cancer. After additional trials in 2015, docetaxel use was extended to those with castration-sensitive prostate cancer.

== Society and culture ==
Prostate cancer screening and awareness have been widely promoted since the early 2000s by Prostate Cancer Awareness Month in September and Movember in November. However, an analysis of internet searches suggests neither event changes the level of prostate cancer interest or discussion much, in contrast to the more established Breast Cancer Awareness Month. 

== Research ==

Prostate cancer is a major topic of ongoing research. From 2016 to 2020, over $1.26 billion was invested in prostate cancer research, representing around 5% of global cancer research funds. This places prostate cancer 10th among 18 common cancer types in funding per cancer death, and 9th in funding per disability-adjusted life year lost.

Research into prostate cancer relies on a number of laboratory models to test aspects of the disease. Several prostate immortalized cell lines are widely used, namely the classic lines DU145, PC-3, and LNCaP, as well as more recent cell lines 22Rv1, LAPC-4, VCaP, and MDA-PCa-2a and −2b. Research requiring more complex models of the prostate uses organoids – clusters of prostate cells that can be grown from human prostate tumors or stem cells. Modeling tumor growth and metastasis requires a model organism, typically a mouse. Researchers can either surgically implant human prostate tumors into immunocompromised mice (a technique called a patient derived xenograft), or induce prostate tumors in mice with genetic engineering. These genetically engineered mouse models typically use a Cre recombinase system to disrupt tumor suppressors or activate oncogenes specifically in prostate cells. 

 studies exploring the relationship between ejaculation frequency and prostate cancer risk are inconclusive and age, urinary health, and lifestyle are important factors to consider.

<text>Jonathan Scott Frakes (born August 19, 1952) is an American actor and director. He is best known for his portrayal of William Riker in the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and subsequent films and series. He has also hosted the anthology series &quot;Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction&quot;, voiced David Xanatos in the Disney television series &quot;Gargoyles&quot;, and narrated the History Channel documentary, &quot;Lee and Grant&quot;. He is the credited author of the novel &quot;The Abductors: Conspiracy&quot;, which was ghostwritten by Dean Wesley Smith.

Frakes began directing episodes of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; during its third season, and went on to direct the feature films &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; (1996) and &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; (1998) and episodes of the later &quot;Star Trek&quot; series &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;Voyager&quot;, &quot;Discovery&quot;, &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot;, and &quot;Picard&quot;. He also directed the feature films &quot;Clockstoppers&quot; (2002) and &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; (2004). He has since directed prolifically for television, including for &quot;The Librarian&quot; television films and series, &quot;Roswell&quot;, &quot;Leverage&quot;, &quot;Castle&quot;, and &quot;Burn Notice&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Frakes was born in 1952 in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, to Doris J. (&quot;née&quot; Yingling; 1926–2020) and James R. Frakes (1924–2002). Frakes&#x27;s father was a professor of English literature and American studies at Lehigh University from 1958 to 2001, and was also a reviewer and critic for &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;. Frakes had a younger brother, Daniel, who died in 1997 from pancreatic cancer. Raised in Bethlehem in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania, he attended Liberty High School in Bethlehem, where he ran track, played with the Liberty High School Grenadier Band as a trombonist, and graduated in 1970.

Frakes attended Pennsylvania State University, where he was a member of the Thespians, and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theater Arts in 1974. Although he had enjoyed performing in plays throughout junior high and high school, it was not until he entered Penn State that he began to take acting seriously. While he was working a summer job as an usher at the Festival of America Theatre, a director spotted him and suggested he would make a great addition to his play&#x27;s chorus. Transformed by the experience, Frakes immediately changed his major from psychology to theater.

Frakes then went on to attend Harvard University, where he became a member of the university&#x27;s acting company, the Loeb Drama Center, and graduated with a Master of Arts degree in 1976.

==Career==
=== Early work ===
For a time in the late 1970s, Frakes worked for Marvel Comics, appearing in costume as Captain America at conventions and other promotional events as well as for special appearances; he credits the experience in helping to hone his skills on interacting with fans on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; convention circuit. After graduating from Harvard, Frakes moved to New York City and became a member of the Impossible Ragtime Theater. In that company, Frakes did his first off-Broadway acting in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Hairy Ape&quot; directed by George Ferencz. His first Broadway appearance was in 1976 in the musical &quot;Shenandoah&quot;. Around the same time, he landed a role in the NBC soap opera &quot;The Doctors&quot;. When his character, Vietnam veteran Tom Carroll, was dismissed from the show, Frakes, urged by his agent, moved to Los Angeles, where he obtained guest spots in many of the top television series of the 1970s and 1980s, including &quot;The Waltons&quot;, &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;, &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, &quot;Matlock&quot;, &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, and &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;.

He played the part of Charles Lindbergh in a 1983 episode of &quot;Voyagers!&quot; titled &quot;An Arrow Pointing East&quot;. In 1983, he had a role in the short-lived NBC prime time soap opera &quot;Bare Essence&quot; (which also starred his future wife Genie Francis), and a supporting role in the equally short-lived primetime soap &quot;Paper Dolls&quot; in 1984. He also had recurring roles in &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; and the miniseries &quot;North and South&quot;. Frakes appeared in the 1986 miniseries &quot;Dream West&quot;.

=== &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1987) ===

In 1987, Frakes was cast in the role of Commander William T. Riker on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. He was one of only two actors to appear in every episode (the other being Patrick Stewart). While appearing on the show, Frakes was allowed to sit in on casting sessions, concept meetings, production design, editing, and post-production, which gave him the preparation he needed to become a director. He directed eight episodes of the show and 21 episodes of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. After the TV series ended in 1994, Frakes reprised his role in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; films, two of which (&quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot;) he directed.

Frakes has appeared in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot;, making him the only &quot;Star Trek&quot; regular to appear in six &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. He has also directed episodes in six of the series (&quot;TNG&quot;, &quot;DS9,&quot; &quot;VOY&quot;, &quot;DIS&quot;, &quot;PIC&quot;, and &quot;SNW&quot;). Frakes is also one of six &quot;Star Trek&quot; actors (the other actors being Kate Mulgrew, Michael Dorn, George Takei, Avery Brooks and Majel Barrett) to lend their voices to the video game &quot;Star Trek: Captain&#x27;s Chair&quot;, reprising his role as Riker when users visit the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E bridge featured in the game.

=== After &quot;Star Trek&quot; ===

Branching out from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, Frakes directed the 2002 family film &quot;Clockstoppers&quot;. However, his next film, 2004&#x27;s &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, was a box-office bomb, which he has said single-handedly almost destroyed what had been a successful directing career: &quot;[My] name was taken off the lists ... I went from 60 to zero. It was a wake-up for me. I had been so positive, and so blessed, and so fortunate.&quot; It was several years before Frakes was given another opportunity to direct for television, and &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; remains his final theatrical directorial credit.

Much of Frakes&#x27;s acting work after &quot;Star Trek&quot; has been animation voice acting, most notably voicing the recurring role of David Xanatos in the animated series &quot;Gargoyles&quot;, and he provided the voice of his own head in a jar in the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;Where No Fan Has Gone Before&quot;. He had a small, uncredited role in the 1994 film &quot;Camp Nowhere&quot;. Frakes also voiced Finn the Human&#x27;s adult version in the episodes &quot;Puhoy&quot; and &quot;Dungeon Train&quot; on &quot;Adventure Time&quot;.

Frakes was an executive producer for the WB series &quot;Roswell&quot;, directed several episodes, and guest-starred in three episodes. His relationship with &quot;Star Trek&quot; is downplayed in the season 3 episode &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot;, in which the alien character Max auditions for a guest role as an alien for &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;.

Frakes appeared on the 1994 Phish album &quot;Hoist&quot;, playing trombone on the track titled &quot;Riker&#x27;s Mailbox&quot;. Frakes would occasionally perform on the trombone during his tenure as Commander Riker, drawing on his college marching band experience. He was also a member of &quot;The Sunspots&quot;, a vocal backup group of &quot;Star Trek&quot; cast members that appeared on Brent Spiner&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Ol&#x27; Yellow Eyes Is Back&quot;.

Frakes hosted &quot;The Paranormal Borderline&quot;, a short-lived television series on UPN, which dealt with the paranormal and mysterious happenings and creatures. In one episode, Frakes presented an interview of reporter Yolanda Gaskins with veteran astronaut Gordon Cooper, where they discussed the possibility of aliens having visited Earth in the past. He hosted seasons 2 through 6 of &quot;Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction,&quot; which also dealt with the paranormal world.

Frakes and Francis appeared together in &quot;Lois &amp; Clark&quot; in the episode &quot;Don&#x27;t Tug on Superman&#x27;s Cape&quot; as a creepily too-good-to-be-true couple. He narrated the History Channel&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s Impossible&quot;.

In addition to &quot;Roswell&quot;, Frakes has directed episodes of &quot;Leverage&quot;, &quot;Castle&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Burn Notice&quot;, &quot;Falling Skies&quot; and most recently Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, &quot;Switched at Birth&quot;, &quot;Hit the Floor&quot;, &quot;The Librarians&quot;, and &quot;The Orville&quot;. So far, &quot;The Librarians&quot; has been one of the most positively rated and recommended work of his out of the previous, following the debut film &quot;The Librarian and the Quest for the Spear&quot;.

Frakes works with the Workshops, the Waterfall Arts Center, and the Saltwater Film Society, all located in Maine, where he teaches classes on film direction. He has also previously taught directing and filmmaking courses at Rockport College, now called Maine Media College. He and Francis owned a home furnishings store in Belfast, Maine, called &quot;The Cherished Home&quot;, which closed in August 2012 due to her being too busy with her acting to spend adequate time at the store.

==Personal life==
Frakes and actress Debralee Scott met at an exercise class in Los Angeles. They married after about a year and lived in a 2-bedroom house in Sherman Oaks, California.

Frakes first met actress Genie Francis on the set of the television soap opera &quot;Bare Essence&quot;, and again while filming the mini-series &quot;North and South&quot;. They began dating in 1985, became engaged in 1986, and married on May 28, 1988. The couple have two children, Jameson Ivor Frakes (born August 20, 1994) and Elizabeth Frances Frakes (born May 30, 1997).

In 2008, they moved from Belfast, Maine, to Beverly Hills, California, and later to Calabasas, California.

<text>Lorenzo Mascheroni (; May 13, 1750 – July 14, 1800) was an Italian mathematician.

== Biography ==
He was born near Bergamo, Lombardy. At first mainly interested in the humanities (poetry and Greek language), he eventually became professor of mathematics at Pavia.
In his &quot;Geometria del Compasso&quot; (Pavia, 1797), he proved that any geometrical construction which can be done with compass and straightedge, can also be done with compasses alone. However, the priority for this result (now known as the Mohr–Mascheroni theorem) belongs to the Dane Georg Mohr, who had previously published a proof in 1672 in an obscure book, &quot;Euclides Danicus&quot;.

In his &quot;Adnotationes ad calculum integralem Euleri&quot; (1790) he published a calculation of what is now known as the Euler–Mascheroni constant, usually denoted as (gamma).

He died in Paris.

Berríos was born in Aibonito, Puerto Rico. He attended high school at Colegio San Ignacio (class of 1957). He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration and economy from Georgetown University in 1961, his juris doctor and master&#x27;s degree in law from Yale Law School, and his doctoral degree in international rights from Oxford University. He also did some post-doctoral research in Sweden. His first wife was Swedish and his son Rubén Axel was born in Stockholm. He has been a tenured professor of law at the University of Puerto Rico School of Law since 1967.

Berríos became president of the Independence Party PIP when he was thirty-one years old and has been president of it five times during fifty years. Under his leadership, the PIP adopted a democratic socialist program. Although he has had limited success at the voting booth regarding his candidacy for the post of Governor of Puerto Rico in 1976, 1980, 1988, 2000 and 2004 — losing every time to either the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) or the New Progressive Party (PNP) candidate — he, nevertheless, has enjoyed great electoral success regarding his candidacy to the Senate, receiving more votes than any other candidate in the Puerto Rican senatorial elections of 1972, 1984, 1992 and 1996.

In 1972, the thirty-three-year-old Berríos was elected to his first term as an at-large senator. He was also re-elected to at-large senatorial seats at the Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly on three additional occasions: 1984, 1992, and 1996.

Berríos founded the Permanent Conference of Political Parties of Latin America and the Caribbean (COPPPAL), is a member of the Executive Council of the Latin American Human Rights Association (ALDHU), and Honorary President of the Socialist International (SI).

He has published the books &quot;The Independence of Puerto Rico: Cause and Struggle&quot;, &quot;Puerto Rico: Nationality and Plebiscite&quot;, and &quot;Towards Puerto Rican Socialism&quot;, and has collaborated with various publications enjoying wide international prestige such as Foreign Affairs.

In 2015, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega named Berrios as his political advisor.

Berríos is widely admired by many in Puerto Rico, including those who do not follow his political ideology. In 1984, for example, he received 84% of the general vote in his candidacy for senator.

===Political views===
Berríos believes that there should be a change in the U.S. maritime laws that force Puerto Rico to import and export goods only via U.S. ships. Such laws increase the price of products entering or leaving the island. He also believes that the U.S. Selective Service laws should not apply to Puerto Rico without the consent of the Puerto Rican legislature.

=== Civil disobedience ===
In 1971, Berríos led the Navy-Culebra protests that criticized the United States Navy&#x27;s use of the Puerto Rican island of Culebra for military exercises. He squatted in Culebra&#x27;s Flamenco Beach for three days. He was then arrested and imprisoned for three months. In part because of his efforts, the U.S. Navy abandoned its facilities in Culebra.

On May 8, 1999, Berríos began camping inside the U.S. Navy bombing practice grounds in the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico (see Navy-Vieques protests). He stayed in the Gilberto Concepción de Gracia encampment — baptized in honor of the PIP founder — for 362 consecutive days, enduring both camp devastations due to storms and declining health due to a new diagnosis of prostate cancer. In December 1999, he resigned his Senate seat due to the uncertainty and prolongation of his stay at the encampment.

On May 4, 2000, the encampments were evacuated by federal marshals and United States Marines, and Berríos was arrested. Berríos&#x27; arrest was televised island-wide in Puerto Rico.

Five days later, Berríos reentered the Vieques target practice grounds. As a result, he was arrested and went to trial at the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, in San Juan, and sentenced to six hours of detention. Similar to what Berríos Martínez had done in Culebra thirty years before, Berríos did not recognize the jurisdiction of the American judicial forum in Puerto Rico during his trial for the Vieques trespassing, and did not present any legal defense. Speaking to Berríos Martínez, the sentencing judge said, &quot;Odd as it may seem to you, we both are on the side of democracy on this one; you are complying with your conscience. I am also complying with mine.&quot;

With the continuation of bombing practices by the U.S. Navy, Berríos announced his intention to enter the restricted grounds for a third time. He stayed for five days in the target practice area, before being arrested violently and forced to lie on a hot gravel road for an extended period of time after being handcuffed with his hands to his back with the other PIP members that accompanied him at the U.S. Navy bombing range. This time, convicted for the fourth time (one in Culebra and three additional civil disobedience arrests) by a United States District Court, Berríos was sentenced to four months in prison.

The U.S. Navy abandoned its facilities in Vieques on May 1, 2003, by order of President George W. Bush.

<text>The Saab 37 Viggen (&quot;The Tufted Duck&quot;, ambiguous with &quot;The Thunderbolt&quot;) is a single-seat, single-engine multirole combat aircraft designed and produced by the Swedish aircraft manufacturer Saab. It was the first canard-equipped aircraft to be produced in quantity and the first to carry an airborne digital central computer with integrated circuits for its avionics, arguably making it the most modern/advanced combat aircraft in Europe at the time of introduction. The digital central computer was the first of its kind in the world, automating and taking over tasks previously requiring a navigator/copilot, facilitating handling in tactical situations where, among other things, high speeds and short decision times determined whether attacks would be successful or not, a system not surpassed until the introduction of the Panavia Tornado into operational service in 1981.

Development work begun during the early 1950s to develop a successor to the Saab 32 Lansen in the attack role, as well as to the Saab 35 Draken as a fighter. Saab&#x27;s design team opted for a relatively radical delta wing configuration, and operation as an integrated weapon system in conjunction with Sweden&#x27;s STRIL-60 national electronic air defense system. It was also designed to be operated from runways as short as 500 meters. Development work was aided by the &quot;37-annex&quot; under which Sweden could access advanced U.S. aeronautical technology to accelerate both design and production. The aircraft&#x27;s aerodynamic design was finalised in 1963. The prototype performed its maiden flight on 8 February 1967 and the following year the Swedish government ordered an initial batch of 175 Viggens. The first of these entered service with the Swedish Air Force on 21 June 1971.

Even as the initial AJ 37 model entered service, Saab was working on further variants of the Viggen. Several distinct variants of the Viggen would be produced to perform the roles of fighter bomber/strike fighter (AJ 37), aerial reconnaissance (SF 37), maritime patrol/anti-surface (SH 37) and a two-seat trainer (Sk 37). During the late 1970s, the all-weather interceptor/strike fighter JA 37 variant was introduced. Attempts to export the Viggen to other nations were made, but ultimately proved unsuccessful. In November 2005, the last Viggens were withdrawn from service by the Swedish Air Force, its only operator; by this point, it had been replaced by the newer and more advanced Saab JAS 39 Gripen.

== Name ==
&quot;Viggen&quot; is the definite form of the Swedish word &quot;vigg&quot;, which has two meanings. According to Saab, the aircraft&#x27;s name alluded to both.

The first meaning refers to the Swedish name for the tufted duck, a small diving duck common in Sweden. In this sense, it serves as a reference to the aircraft&#x27;s canard configuration, as &quot;canard&quot; is French for duck.

&quot;Vigg&quot; is also &quot;åskvigg&quot;, or &quot;thunderbolt&quot; (thunder wedge), stemming from the thunderstones of Nordic folklore, called &quot;åskviggar&quot;, said to come from the lightning strikes of Norse god Thor when he hunted giants with his war hammer, Mjölnir.

== Development ==
=== Origins ===
The Viggen was initially developed as an intended replacement for the Saab 32 Lansen in the attack role and later the Saab 35 Draken as a fighter. In 1955, as Saab&#x27;s prototype Draken, the most aerodynamically advanced fighter in the world at that point, performed its first flight, the Swedish Air Force was already forming a series of requirements for the next generation of combat aircraft; due to the challenging nature of these requirements, a lengthy development time was anticipated, with the first flight intended to be no earlier than the middle of the next decade. Between 1952 and 1957, the first studies towards what would become the Viggen were carried out, involving the Finnish aircraft designer Aarne Lakomaa. Over 100 different concepts were examined in these studies, involving both single- and twin engine configurations, both traditional and double delta wings, and canard wings. Even VTOL designs were considered, with separate lift engines, but were soon identified as being unacceptable.

From the onset, the Viggen was planned as an integrated weapon system, to be operated in conjunction with the newest revision of Sweden&#x27;s national electronic air defense system, STRIL-60. It was used as the nation&#x27;s standard platform, capable of being efficiently adapted to perform all tactical mission roles. Other requirements included supersonic ability at low level, Mach 2 performance at altitude, and the ability to make short landings at low angles of attack (to avoid damaging improvised runways). The aircraft was also designed from the beginning to be easy to repair and service, even for personnel without much training.

One radical requirement of the proposed aircraft was the ability for it to be operated from relatively short runways only 500 meters long; this was part of the Bas 60 air base system that had been introduced by the Swedish Air Force in the late 1950s. Bas 60 revolved around force dispersal of aircraft across many wartime air bases, including road runways acting as backup runways. Utilizing partially destroyed runways was another factor that motivated STOL capability. Bas 60 was developed into Bas 90 in the 1970s and 1980s, and included short runways only 800 meters in length. Enabling such operations imposed several critical demands upon the design, including a modest landing speed, no-flare touchdown, powerful post-landing deceleration, accurate steering even in crosswinds on icy surfaces, and high acceleration on take-off.

In 1960, the U.S. National Security Council, led by President Eisenhower, formulated a security guarantee for Sweden, promising U.S. military help in the event of a Soviet attack against Sweden; both countries signed a military-technology agreement. In what was known as the &quot;37-annex&quot;, Sweden was allowed access to advanced U.S. aeronautical technology that made it possible to design and produce the Viggen much faster and more cheaply than would otherwise have been possible. According to research by Nils Bruzelius at the Swedish National Defence College, the reason for this officially unexplained U.S. support was to protect U.S. Polaris submarines deployed just outside the Swedish east coast against the threat of Soviet anti-submarine aircraft. However, Bruzelius&#x27; theory has been discredited by Simon Moores and Jerker Widén. The connection also appears doubtful due to the time scale – the Viggen&#x27;s strike version only became operational in 1971, and the fighter version in 1978, by which time Polaris had already been retired.

=== Project launch ===
In December 1961, the Swedish government gave its approval for the development of &quot;Aircraft System 37&quot;, which would ultimately become the Viggen. By 1962, all elements for the project either existed or were close to fully developed; these included the aircraft itself, the powerplant, ejector seat, armaments, reconnaissance systems, ground servicing equipment, and training equipment such as simulators. In February 1962, approval of the overall configuration was given and was followed by a development contract in October 1962. According to aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, the project was &quot;by far the largest industrial development task ever attempted in Sweden&quot;. During the 1960s, the Viggen accounted for 10 percent of all Swedish R&amp;D funding.

In 1963, Saab finalized the aerodynamic design of the aircraft; the aerodynamic configuration was radical: it combined an aft-mounted double delta wing with a small, high-set canard foreplane, equipped with powered trailing flaps mounted ahead of and slightly above the main wing; this would be judged to be the best means to satisfy the conflicting demands for STOL performance, supersonic speed, low turbulence sensitivity at low level flight, and efficient lift for subsonic flight. Canard aircraft have since become common in fighter aircraft, notably with the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, Saab JAS 39 Gripen and the IAI Kfir, but principally for the purposes of providing agility during flight rather than for its STOL capabilities. Further aerodynamic refinements during the later stage of development included the addition of dog-tooth patterns upon the main wing to generate vortices, allowing for the elimination of blown flaps from the canard. The use of a thrust reverser enabled the sought short landing performance.
During development, Saab had opted to power the type using a single large turbofan engine. Originally, the British Rolls-Royce Medway engine had been selected to power the Viggen, which was then considered to be ideal for the basis for a supersonic engine equipped with a fully modulated afterburner; however, development of the Medway engine was cancelled due to the intended launch aircraft, the de Havilland Trident, being downsized during development. In place of the Medway, Saab chose to adopt a licence-production version of the American Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D engine, the Volvo RM8, instead. The RM8 was heavily redesigned, using new materials to accommodate flight at Mach-2 speeds, a Swedish-built afterburner, and a fully variable nozzle.

During 1964, construction of the first prototype aircraft commenced; on 8 February 1967, the first of an eventual seven prototypes conducted its maiden flight, which had occurred as per the established development schedule. This first flight, which lasted for 43 minutes, was flown by Erik Dahlström, Saab&#x27;s chief test pilot, who reported the prototype to have been easy to handle throughout. Writing at the time, aerospace publication Flight International described the flight as having been &quot;Sweden&#x27;s astonishing unilateral stand in the front rank of advanced aircraft-building nations…&quot;

Each of the seven prototypes were assigned different roles, although the initial aircraft were focused on supporting the development of the initial production variant, the AJ37. In 1967, the Swedish Government concluded that the in-development AJ 37 Viggen would be both cheaper than and superior to the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. In April 1968, the Swedish government formally issued the authorization for manufacturing of the Viggen to proceed, issuing an order for 175 Viggens that year. Also in 1968, Saab began work on the Viggen&#x27;s maritime reconnaissance and photo reconnaissance variants. In May 1969, the Viggen made its first public appearance outside of Sweden at the Paris Air Show. On 23 February 1971, the first production aircraft, an AJ37 model, conducted its first flight. In July 1971, the first production aircraft was delivered to the Swedish Air Force.

=== Further development ===

As the initial AJ 37 Viggen was being introduced to service, further variants of the Viggen proceeded to complete development and enter production. In 1972, the first SK 37, an operational trainer variant with a staggered second canopy for an instructor, was delivered to the Swedish Air Force. On 21 May 1973, the first prototype of SF 37 Viggen, a tactical reconnaissance variant featuring a modified nose to accommodate seven sensors, conducted its first flight.

While other variants entered production during the 1960s, Saab continued the development of the more capable all-weather interceptor version of the aircraft, the JA 37. In 1970, Sweden&#x27;s air defenses had been closely inspected and it was determined that the prospective JA 37 Viggen was highly suited to the role. In 1972, the Swedish government authorized the development of the fighter-interceptor variant to proceed, which was followed by several major contracts for the JA 37&#x27;s further development. A total of five prototypes would be produced, four of which being modified AJ 37s and one being a sole pre-production JA 37 model, to test the control systems, engine, avionics, and armaments respectively. In June 1974, the first of these prototypes conducted its maiden flight; later that year, an initial order for 30 JA 37s was issued by the Swedish government.

The JA 37 Viggen featured various changes from its predecessor, including revisions to the design of the airframe, the use of the more powerful RM8B powerplant, a new generation of electronics being adopted, and a revised armament configuration employed; the principal externally visible changes from most earlier variants were a taller tailfin and the underfuselage gunpack arrangement. The JA 37, in addition to its principal aerial combat mission, also retained a secondary ground-attack capability, and was better suited to low-level operations. In November 1977, the first production JA 37 Viggen conducted its maiden flight. Operational trials for the new variant were conducted between January and December 1979, which resulted in the type being introduced to operational service that year. According to Flight International, at the time of the JA 37&#x27;s introduction, it was the most advanced European fighter then in service.
In April 1964, the Swedish government revealed its budget proposal for the Swedish Air Force, in which it had been envisioned that 800 or more Viggens would be produced, which was in turn intended to allow all other combat aircraft then in service with the Swedish Air Force to be replaced with this single type. However, a combination of inflation and other factors eventually reduced the total number of aircraft manufactured to 329. By 1980, up to 149 JA 37 Viggens were projected to be built, and the line to be closed within the decade as the Swedish aerospace industry changed focus to the impending Saab JAS 39 Gripen, the Viggen&#x27;s eventual replacement. Over time, advances in computing, such as the microprocessor, had enabled greater flexibility than the physical configuration of the Viggen, so further development of the Viggen platform was not viewed as cost-effective. In 1990, production of the Viggen ceased and the final aircraft was delivered.

In May 1991, a SEK 300-million program to upgrade 11 AJ37, SF37 and SH37 Viggens to a common multirole variant, designated AJS37, was announced. Amongst the changes involved, interchangeable armaments and sensor payloads were implemented in addition to the adoption of new mission planning and threat analysis computer systems. The onboard ECM systems were also improved. Specifically, the implementation of a new stores management system and MIL-STD-1553 serial data bus, similar to that used on the newer JAS 39 Gripen, allowed for the integration of the AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missile; an upgraded Ericsson PS-46A radar was installed, and a new tactical radio. On 4 June 1996, the first upgraded prototype JA37 Viggen performed its first flight.

In 1996, according to Swedish air force material-department chief General Steffan Nasstrom, the various upgrades performed to the Viggen since its introduction had &quot;doubled the effectiveness of the overall system&quot;.

== Design ==
=== Propulsion ===

The Viggen was powered by a single Volvo RM8 turbofan. This was essentially a heavily modified licence-built variant of the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D engine that powered commercial airliners of the 1960s, with an afterburner added for the Viggen. The airframe also incorporated a thrust reverser to use during landings and land manoeuvres, which, combined with the aircraft having flight capabilities approaching a limited STOL-like performance, enabled operations from 500 m airstrips with minimal support. The thrust reverser could be pre-selected in the air to engage when the nose-wheel strut was compressed after touchdown via a pneumatic trigger.

The requirements from the Swedish Air Force dictated Mach 2 capability at high altitude and Mach 1 at low altitude. At the same time, short-field take-off and landing performance was also required. Since the Viggen was developed initially as an attack aircraft instead of an interceptor (the Saab 35 Draken fulfilled this role), some emphasis was given to low fuel consumption at high subsonic speeds at low level for good range. With turbofan engines just emerging and indicating better fuel economy for cruise than turbojet engines, the former was favoured, since the latter were mainly limited by metallurgy development resulting from limitations in turbine temperature. Mechanical simplicity was also favoured, so the air intakes were simple D-section types with boundary layer splitter plates, while the fixed inlet had no adjustable geometry for improved pressure recovery. The disadvantage was that the required engine would be very large. In fact, at the time of introduction, it was the second-largest fighter engine, with a length of 6.1 m and 1.35 m diameter; only the Tumansky R-15 was bigger.
Saab had originally wanted the Rolls-Royce Medway as the Viggen&#x27;s powerplant. Owing to the cancellation of the Medway, the JT8D was instead chosen as the basis for modification. The RM8 became the second operational afterburning turbofan in the world, and also the first equipped with a thrust reverser. According to aviation author Christopher Chant, the RM8 has the distinction of being the first engine to be fitted with both an afterburner and a thrust reverser. It had a bypass ratio of around 1.07:1 in the RM8A, which reduced to 0.97:1 in the RM8B. The RM8A was the most powerful fighter engine in the late 1960s.

The AJ, SF, SH and SK 37 models of the Viggen had the first version of the RM8A engine with uprated internal components from the JT8D that it was based on. Thrust was 65.6 kN dry and 115.6 kN with afterburner. For the JA 37, the RM8A was developed into the RM8B, achieved by adding a third low-pressure compressor stage over the preceding model, increasing the turbine inlet temperature and fuel diffusion within the combustion chamber. Thrust is 72.1 kN dry and 125.0 kN with afterburner. Owing to the increased length and weight of the RM8B engine over its predecessor, the airframe of the JA 37 was stretched in order to accommodate it. Onboard electrical power was provided by a 60 kVA generator. In the event of an in-flight engine failure, emergency power was provided by an automatically deploying ram air turbine (RAT), capable of generating 6 kVA.

=== Avionics ===

In the early 1960s, it was decided that the Viggen should be a single seat aircraft, Saab having recognized that advanced avionics such as a digital central computer and a head-up display could perform the workload of a human navigator and entirely replace the need for a second crew member. The use of a digital computer would reduce or entirely replace analogue systems, which had proven to be expensive to maintain and alter, as had been the case of the earlier Draken, in addition to accuracy issues. The computer, called &quot;&quot; (short for &quot;Centralkalkylator 37&quot;, &quot;central calculator 37&quot;), was the world&#x27;s first airborne computer to use integrated circuits. Developed by Datasaab, the CK 37 was the integrating unit for all electronic equipment to support the pilot, performing functions such as navigation, flight control, and weapon-aiming calculations. In practice, the CK 37 proved to be more reliable than predicted.

On later variants of the Viggen, from the JA37 onwards, it was decided to adopt a newer and more powerful Singer-Kearfott SKC-2037 digital central processor, license-manufactured and further developed by Saab as the CD 107. The computing techniques and concepts, such as distributed computing, went beyond use of the Viggen, in addition to civil-orientated derivatives, it directly contributed to the computers used on board the Viggen&#x27;s replacement, the Saab JAS 39 Gripen. Various electronic countermeasures (ECM) were installed upon the Viggen, these were typically provided by Satt Elektronik. The ECM systems consisted of a Satt Elektronik radar warning receiver system in the wings and the tail, an optional Ericsson Erijammer pod and BOZ-100 chaff/flare pod. Infrared warning receivers were also later installed. In total, the electronics weighed 600 kg, a substantial amount for a single-engine fighter of the era.

The aircraft&#x27;s principal sensor was an Ericsson PS 37 X-band monopulse radar, which used a mechanically steered parabolic reflector housed in a radome. This radar performed several functions, including air-to-ground and air-to-air telemetry, search, track, terrain-avoidance and cartography. On the JA 37 fighter-interceptor model, the PS 37 radar was replaced by the more capable Ericsson PS 46 X-band pulse-doppler radar, which had an all-weather look-down/shoot-down capability reportedly in excess of 50 kilometers and continuous-wave illumination for the Skyflash missiles as well as the ability to track two targets while scanning. According to Ericsson, it had a 50 percent chance of spotting a low-flying McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II within a single scan and possessed a high level of resistance to interference from ECM.

Saab and Honeywell co-developed an automatic digital flight control system for the JA 37 Viggen, which has been claimed to be the first such system in a production aircraft. To assist low altitude flight, a Honeywell radar altimeter with transmitter and receiver in the canard wings was used. The aircraft was also fitted with a Decca Type 72 Doppler navigation radar. TILS (Tactical Instrument Landing System), a landing-aid system made by Cutler-Hammer AIL, improved landing accuracy to 30 m from the threshold on the short highway airbase system. In order to effectively enforce Sweden&#x27;s air space, the Viggen was integrated with STRIL 60 national defence system. The JA 37 Viggen was also equipped with a Garrett AiResearch digital Central Air Data Computer, modified from the unit used upon the Grumman F-14 Tomcat.

Initially, only a single reconnaissance (S) variant was considered, but fitting cameras as well as a radar proved to be impossible. The SH 37 maritime strike and reconnaissance variant was very similar to the AJ 37 and differed mainly in a maritime-optimized PS 371/A radar with longer range, a cockpit air-data camera and tape recorder for mission analysis. &quot;Red Baron&quot; and a SKa 24D 600 mm LOROP camera pods were usually carried on the fuselage pylons. The centreline fuel tank was converted for a short period of time to a camera pod with two Recon/Optical CA-200 1676 mm cameras. In addition to the reconnaissance equipment, the SH 37 could also use all weapons for the AJ 37. For the photographic SF version, the radar in the nose was omitted in favour of four SKa 24C 120 mm and two SKa 31 570 mm photographic cameras as well as one 57 mm VKa 702 Infrared linescan camera and air-data camera; all of which were integrated with and controlled by the aircraft&#x27;s central computer. Additional equipment, such as more camera pods, fuel tanks, ECM pods, and self-defense air-to-air missiles could also be carried upon the fuselage pylons.

The fighter-interceptor version of the Viggen, the JA 37, featured various avionics changes, including the extensive use of digital electronics alongside mechanical technology. In 1985, the &quot;fighter link&quot; entered service, permitting encrypted data communication between up to four fighters; this enabled one fighter to &quot;paint&quot; an airborne enemy with guidance radar for the Skyflash missiles of the three other fighters in a group while they had their own search and guidance radars switched off. This system was operational ten years before any other country&#x27;s. The autopilot was also slaved to the radar control to obtain better precision firing the cannon. Once in service, the Viggen&#x27;s software was regularly updated every 18 months. In 1983, the mean time between failures (MTBF) was reported as 100 hours, a very high reliability level for the generation of avionics systems involved.

=== Cockpit ===

The displays in the original cockpit were all of the traditional analogue/mechanical type with the exception of an electronic head-up display (HUD), which Saab has claimed makes the Viggen easier to fly, especially at low altitudes during air-to-ground strike missions. Unusually for a 1970s fighter, the JA 37 variant of the Viggen featured three multi-purpose cathode-ray tube (CRT) display screens fitted within the cockpit, in a system called AP-12, developed by Saab and Ericsson. These displays would be used to display processed radar information, computer-generated maps, flight and weapons data, along with steering cues during precision landings.
Between 1989 and 1992, the AP-12 display system was subject to a substantial upgrade. In 1999, a new tactical liquid-crystal display (LCD) system derived from the Saab JAS 39 Gripen, which replaced the CRT-based AP-12 system, began flight tests with the Swedish Air Force. On the twin-seat SK 37 trainer, the rear cockpit used by the instructor is only fitted with conventional instrumentation and lacks a HUD, computer controls and other features.

The ejection seat was the Raketstol 37 (literally; Rocket chair 37) and was the last Saab designed seat in service. A derivative of the Saab 105 trainer seat, the seat was optimized for low altitude, high speed ejections. Once activated by the pilot via triggers built into the armrests (on twin-seat models, the occupant of the forward cockpit position is able to initiate the ejection of both seats), the ejection sequence is automated, including the removal of the canopy; in the event of a malfunction, a reserve trigger can be activated. A combined parachute and seat harness is used, which features a barometric interlock to appropriately release the occupant and harness from the seat during the ejection sequence, a manual override handle is also provided for this function.

There were dedicated warning caption panels on each side of the pilot&#x27;s legs. On the right console panel were numerous dedicated controls and indicators, including weapons and missile controls, nav panel, oxygen on/off, windshield de-fogging, IFF control, lighting controls. Situated on the left console panel were radar controls, canopy handle, landing gear handle, radio controls and the cabin pressure indicator. As per then-standard practice within the Swedish Air Force, all cockpit instrumentation and labeling were in Swedish.

=== Wings and airframe ===
With the performance requirements to a large extent dictating the choice of the engine, the airframe turned out to be quite bulky compared to contemporary slimmer designs with turbojet engines. The first prototypes had a straight midsection fuselage that was later improved with a &quot;hump&quot; on the dorsal spine for reduced drag according to the area rule. The wing had the shape of a double delta with a dogtooth added to improve longitudinal stability at high incidence angles.
A consequence of a tailless delta design, such as in the Viggen, is that the elevons, which replace more conventional control surfaces, operate with a small effective moment arm; their use adds substantial weight to the aircraft at takeoff and landing. Hinged leading edge surfaces can help counteract this, but an even more effective tool is the canard. The canard surfaces were positioned behind the inlets and placed slightly higher than the main wing, with a higher stall angle than the wing, and were equipped with flaps. The lifting canard surfaces act as a vortex generator for the main wing and therefore provide more lift. An added benefit was that they also improved roll stability in the transonic region. The canard flaps were deployed in conjunction with the landing gear to provide even more lift for takeoff and landing.

To withstand the stresses of no-flare landings, Saab made extensive use of aluminium in the airframe of the Viggen, which was constructed using a bonded metal honeycomb structure; the entire rear section of the fuselage, downstream of the engine nozzle, formed a heat-resistant ring composed of titanium. The main landing gear, manufactured by Motala Verkstad, was highly strengthened as well; each leg held two small wheels fitted with anti-skid brakes placed in a tandem arrangement. The design requirements imposed by the large anti-ship missiles employed upon the Viggen necessitated that both the undercarriage and vertical stabilizer be quite tall. To accommodate this, and to allow the main landing gear to be stowed outside of the wing root, the undercarriage legs shortened during retraction. The vertical stabilizer could also be folded via an actuator in order that the aircraft could be stored in smaller hangars, hardened aircraft shelters, and underground hangars, the latter of which were employed by the Swedish military to limit the damage of preemptive attacks.

The six tanks in the fuselage and wings held approximately 5,000 litres of fuel with an additional 1,500 litres in an external drop tank. The specific fuel consumption was only 0.63 for cruise speeds (fuel consumption was rated 18 mg/Ns dry and 71 with afterburner). The Viggen&#x27;s consumption was around 15 kg/s at maximum afterburner. A pair of inlets placed alongside the cockpit feed air to the engine; simple fixed-geometry inlets were adopted, similar to the Draken, except for being larger and standing clear of the fuselage.

=== Armament ===

A weapons load of up to 7,000 kg could be accommodated on nine hardpoints: one centreline pylon, two fuselage pylons, two inner and two outer wing pylons and two pylons behind the wing landing gear. The centreline pylon was the only pylon plumbed for carrying an external fuel tank, and was usually so occupied. A pair of air-to-air missiles were intended to be placed on the outboard wing pylons, which were more lightweight than the other attachment points. The pylons behind the landing gear were not used until the JA 37D modification when BOL countermeasure dispensers were fitted to them. Ground crew would enter the munitions fitted into the aircraft&#x27;s central computer using a load-selector panel, which would automatically choose the correct values for fire control, fuel consumption, and other calculations.

==== AJ 37 ====
The AJ 37 was typically equipped with a total of seven hardpoints, three underneath the fuselage and two under each wing, a further two wing-mounted hardpoints could be optionally fitted but this facility was rarely used. Various munitions could be carried, such as several types of rockets: the 135 mm M56GP 4 kg armour-piercing, the M56B with 6.9 kg of high explosives, and the M70 with a 4.7 kg HEAT warhead.

The AJ 37 was designed to carry two RB 04E anti-ship missiles on the inboard wing pylons with an optional third missile on the centreline pylon. The RB-04 was a relatively simple cruise missile that was further developed to become the more capable RBS-15, also integrated on the Viggen. An optional load consisted of two Rb 05 air-to-surface missiles on the fuselage pylons. The RB 05 was later replaced by AGM-65 Maverick (Swedish designation &quot;RB 75&quot;) television-guided missiles. In a ground-attack role, a combination of unguided 135 mm rockets in sextuple pods and 120 kg fragmentation bombs on quadruple-mounts could be used. Other armaments include explosive mines, and 30 mm ADEN cannon pods with 150 rounds of ammunition on the inboard wing pylons.

Self-defence measures included various ECM systems, as well as either the AIM-4 Falcon (Swedish designation &quot;RB 28&quot;) or AIM-9 Sidewinder (Swedish designation &quot;RB 24&quot;) air-to-air missiles. At one point, the AJ 37 Viggen was under consideration as a carrier of both a Swedish nuclear weapon and chemical weapons, although no nuclear or chemical weapons were ultimately adopted by Sweden.

====JA 37====
The JA 37 fighter interceptor, introduced in 1979, featured the Ericsson PS 46/A radar which was capable of guiding the medium-range semi-active radar homing RB 71 &quot;Skyflash&quot; air-to-air missiles. Both the RB 71 and the PS 46/A radar were designed to provide the Viggen with a look-down/shoot-down capability and to engage targets at beyond visual range distances. The JA 37 could carry up to two RB 71s on the inner wing pylons; in a typical air defense loadout, these would typically have been combined with four RB 24J air-to-air missiles, a more capable and newer version of the Sidewinder missile than employed on earlier Viggen variants.

Following the evaluation of several alternative cannons, including the British ADEN cannon, the American M61 Vulcan, and French DEFA cannon, an Oerlikon KCA 30mm cannon was selected for the JA 37. The KCA was carried, along with 126 rounds of ammunition, in a conformal pod under the fuselage. The firing rate of the cannon was selectable at 22 or 11 rounds per second. It fired the same cartridge as the GAU-8, reportedly 50% heavier shells at a higher velocity than the ADEN cannon, resulting in six and a half times the kinetic energy on impact, and was effective up to 2,000 meters. This, in conjunction with the fire control system, allowed air-to-air engagements at longer range than other fighters.

Perhaps the most important improvement was the expanded STRIL datalink which entered service in 1982–85. It allowed not only ground control-aircraft communication, but also between up to four aircraft simultaneously regardless if airborne or on the ground. Datalink information was displayed on the Horizontal Situation Display and a tactical display, the latter using link symbology that could be overlaid with an electronic map on a multifunction display.

== Operational history ==

In July 1971, the first production AJ 37 Viggen was delivered to the Swedish Air Force. The Skaraborg Wing (F 7) became the first wing to receive deliveries of both the single-seat AJ 37 attack model and the twin-seat SK 37 training model of the Viggen, where upon the type began to replace their existing Lansen aircraft. Conversion training to pilot the Viggen involved a minimum of 450 flight hours performed on an initial mixture of the Saab 105, the Lansen, and finally the Viggen itself; dedicated Viggen simulators were also used, the latter of which was seen as a decisive factor in the ease of conversion to the type.

In October 1973, Skaraborg Wing was reportedly close to achieving full operational effectiveness; by May 1974, the Swedish Air Force had two operational squadrons using the Viggen along with a third squadron in the final process of achieving that status. By 1974, the safety and reliability levels of the Viggen were reportedly above expectations, despite the overall complexity and relative newness of the aircraft. In practice, one of the most significant issues encountered with the Viggen during low-level flight, as extensively performed during a typical attack mission profile, was the threat posed by birds; thus, the Swedish Air Force paid close attention to their migratory patterns.

During the later half of the 1970s and into the 1980s, the introduction of various variants of the Viggen proceeded; these included the SK 37, a two-seat operational-conversion trainer, introduced in 1972, the SF 37, an overland reconnaissance model, introduced in 1977, and the SH 37, a maritime reconnaissance version, introduced in 1975. By September 1980, the JA 37 fighter-interceptor model of the Viggen was introduced, Bråvalla Wing (F 13) being the first wing of the Swedish Air Force to convert to the new type. The Viggen went on to become Sweden&#x27;s primary air defense platform for many years.

The Viggen was designed to be simple to maintain, even by conscripted flight line mechanics with limited technical training. A single Viggen could be maintained by a team of five conscripts under the supervision of a single chief mechanic. Standard turnaround, including refueling and rearming, took less than ten minutes to perform; while an engine replacement took four hours. Over the long term, the Viggen required 22-man hours per flight hour of maintenance work at the depot level, and nine-man hours per flight hour at the front line.

By the mid-1980s, Swedish Viggen fighter pilots, using the predictable patterns of Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird routine flights over the Baltic Sea, had managed to achieve radar lock-on with radar on the SR-71 on numerous occasions. Despite heavy jamming from the SR-71, target illumination was maintained by feeding target location from ground-based radars to the fire-control computer in the Viggen. The most common site for the lock-on to occur was the thin stretch of international airspace between Öland and Gotland that the SR-71 used on the return flight. The Viggen is the only aircraft to get an acknowledged radar lock on the SR-71.&lt;ref name = &quot;I&amp;F6/05&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement===
By 1994, the replacement of the Viggen by the later and more advanced Saab JAS 39 Gripen was in progress, the type being progressively phased out as greater numbers of Gripen aircraft were delivered. On 25 November 2005, the last front line Viggen was formally retired by the Swedish Air Force. A few aircraft were kept in an operational condition for electronic warfare training against the Gripen at F 17M in Linköping; the last of these Viggen flights took place in June 2007.

=== Overseas sales efforts ===
Although Saab offered the Viggen for sale worldwide, and was the subject of a heavy marketing campaign in both European and developing countries during the 1970s, ultimately no export sales were made.

During the 1970s, Saab proposed a new variant of the Viggen, designated the Saab 37E Eurofighter (unrelated to the later Eurofighter Typhoon), for the United States Air Force Air Combat Fighter competition to find a replacement for the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. The 37E Eurofighter competed against Dassault-Breguet&#x27;s proposed Mirage F1M-53, the SEPECAT Jaguar, Northrop&#x27;s P-530 Cobra (on which the YF-17 was based), and General Dynamics&#x27;s YF-16; on 13 January 1975, United States Secretary of the Air Force John L. McLucas announced the YF-16 had been selected as the winner of the ACF competition.

In 1978, the United States blocked a major prospective sale to India, which would have involved selling a number of Swedish-built Viggens in addition to a licensed production agreement under which the Viggen would also have been built in India, by not issuing an export license for the RM8/JT8D engine and other American technologies used. India later opted to procure the SEPECAT Jaguar in its place. According to leaked United States diplomatic cables, India&#x27;s interest in the Viggen was reported to be entirely due to Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s influence, and had alleged have been without any input from the Indian Air Force. According to author Chris Smith, the Viggen had been the favoured candidate for the Indian Air Force prior to the deal being blocked by the US.

<doc id="88138" wikidata="Q2794866" url="?curid=88138" title="Thunderbolt">
<text>A thunderbolt or lightning bolt is a symbolic representation of lightning when accompanied by a loud thunderclap. In Indo-European mythology, the thunderbolt was identified with the &#x27;Sky Father&#x27;; this association is also found in later Hellenic representations of Zeus and Vedic descriptions of the &quot;vajra&quot; wielded by the god Indra. It may have been a symbol of cosmic order, as expressed in the fragment from Heraclitus describing &quot;the Thunderbolt that steers the course of all things&quot;.

In its original usage the word may also have been a description of the consequences of a close approach between two planetary cosmic bodies, as Plato suggested in &quot;Timaeus&quot;, or, according to Victor Clube, meteors, though this is not currently the case. As a divine manifestation the thunderbolt has been a powerful symbol throughout history, and has appeared in many mythologies. Drawing from this powerful association, the thunderbolt is often found in military symbolism and semiotic representations of electricity.

== In religion and mythology ==
Lightning plays a role in many mythologies, often as the weapon of a sky god and weather god. As such, it is an unsurpassed method of dramatic instantaneous retributive destruction: thunderbolts as divine weapons can be found in many mythologies.
*in the Torah, the word for &#x27;arrow&#x27;, , is used for the &quot;arrows&quot; of YHWH/Elohim, which are represented as lightnings in Habakuk 3:11, but also as general calamities inflicted on men as divine punishment in Deuteronomy 32:42, Psalm 64:7, Job 6:4, etc.
*In Christianity, One of its most significant verses is Deuteronomy 6:4, Verses 6:4–5 were also quoted by Jesus in Mark 12:28–34 as the Great Commandment. The Second Coming of Jesus is compared to lightning (, ). With the establishment of Christianity, it passed into popular belief that lightning is the fire that leaves behind the chariot of the Prophet Elijah as it runs through the sky, while thunder is the rattle of the feet of the horses that drag his chariot. According to another tradition, lightning and thunder are more island-like, as the cannons fired by the Archangel Michael against Satan.
* In Hittite (and Hurrian) mythology, a triple thunderbolt was one symbol of Teshub (Tarhunt).
* In Vedic religion (and later Hindu mythology) the god Indra is the god of lightning. His main weapon is the thunderbolt (Vajra).
* In Greek mythology, the thunderbolt is a weapon given to Zeus by the Cyclopes. Based on this, in Roman mythology, the thunderbolt is a weapon given to Jupiter by the Cyclopes, and is thus one of the emblems of Jupiter, often depicted on Greek and Roman coins and elsewhere as an eagle holding in its claws a thunderbolt which resembles in form a bundle of crossed sticks.
* In Celtic mythology, Taranis is the god of thunder, in Irish, Tuireann.
* In Norse mythology, Thor is specifically the god of thunder and lightning, wielding Mjölnir.
* In Slavic mythology, Perun is the god of the sky, controlling storms, thunder and lightning and wields the Axe of Perun.
* In Finnish mythology, Ukko is the god of thunder and lightning, wielding Ukonvasara.
* In Turkish mythology, Bayülgen creates the thunderbolts.
* In Maya mythology, Huracan is sometimes represented as three thunderbolts.
* In Guaraní mythology, Tupã is the embodiment of thunder and has power over lightning.
* In Cherokee mythology, the Ani Hyuntikwalaski (&quot;thunder beings&quot;) cause lightning fire in a hollow sycamore tree.
* In Ojibway mythology, thunder is created by the Thunderbirds (Nimkiig or Binesiiwag), which can be both benevolent and malevolent to human beings.
* In Igbo mythology, the thunderbolt is the weapon of Amadioha/Amadiora.
* In Yoruba mythology, the thunderbolt is the weapon of Shango.
* In Tibetan Buddhism, the Vajra or thunderbolt is symbol of Vajrayana branch.
* In Paleo-Balkan mythology, Zibelthiurdos (also &quot;Zbelsurdos&quot;, &quot;Zibelthurdos&quot;): a god recognized as similar to the Greek Zeus as a wielder of lightning and thunderbolts.
* In Navajo mythology, the hero twins, Naʼídígishí and Naayééʼ Neizghání, have bows that shoot thunderbolts as arrows.

=== Thunderstones ===
The name &quot;thunderbolt&quot; or &quot;thunderstone&quot; has also been traditionally applied to the fossilised rostra of belemnoids. The origin of these bullet-shaped stones was not understood, and thus a mythological explanation of stones created where a lightning struck has arisen.

== In the modern world ==
The thunderbolt or lightning bolt continues into the modern world as a prominent symbol; it has entered modern heraldry and military iconography.

=== In iconography ===
* The thunderbolt is used as an electrical symbol.
* The thunderbolt is also used as a hazard symbol indicating dangers from electricity.

* In the DC Universe, the thunderbolt is the symbol seen on the chest (or entire torso) of the costumes worn by Shazam, the Flash, Lightning Lad, Lightning Lass, Black Lightning, and Static.
* In the Marvel Universe the thunderbolt is the symbol seen on the torso of the costumes worn by Electro, Quicksilver, Black Bolt, Speed Demon, Ms. Marvel, and is also the name of a superhero team.
* The thunderbolt is used in the logo of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise.

** The letter &quot;P&quot; in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; logo is also stylized in the shape of a thunderbolt.
* In the novel &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;being hit with the thunderbolt&quot; is an Italian expression (&quot;colpo di fulmine&quot;) referring to a man being spellbound at the sight of a beautiful woman (like the so-called &quot;love at first sight&quot;).

<doc id="88145" wikidata="Q909286" url="?curid=88145" title="Dos Pilas">
<text>Dos Pilas is a Pre-Columbian site of the Maya civilization located in what is now the department of Petén, Guatemala. It dates to the Late Classic Period, and was founded by an offshoot of the dynasty of the great city of Tikal in AD 629 in order to control trade routes in the Petexbatún region, particularly the Pasión River. In AD 648 Dos Pilas broke away from Tikal and became a vassal state of Calakmul, although the first two kings of Dos Pilas continued to use the same emblem glyph that Tikal did. It was a predator state from the beginning, conquering Itzan, Arroyo de Piedra and Tamarindito. Dos Pilas and a nearby city, Aguateca, eventually became the twin capitals of a single ruling dynasty. The kingdom as a whole has been named as the Petexbatun Kingdom, after Petexbatún Lake, a body of water draining into the Pasión River.

Dos Pilas gives an important glimpse into the great rivalries and political strife that characterised the Late Classic. Much of the history of Dos Pilas can now be reconstructed, with a level of detail which is almost unparalleled in the Maya area.

On June 12, 1970, the site was declared a National Monument according to Article 1210 of the Guatemalan Ministry of Education.

==Etymology==
ʼʼDos Pilasʼʼ is Guatemalan Spanish for ʼʼtwo wellsʼʼ (or water containers), and this is the generally accepted meaning of the name, even though early investigator Pierre Ivanoff stated that it meant ʼʼtwo stelaeʼʼ. The emblem glyph for the site and/or the polity of Dos Pilas is the same as that of Tikal, Mutal. Its exact meaning is obscure but the drawing suggests a hair knot.

==Location==
Dos Pilas is located in the Petexbatún region of the Petén Basin, in the southwest of the department of Petén, in northern Guatemala. It lies between the Pasión and the Salinas rivers. The site has an elevation of above mean sea level. Dos Pilas falls within the municipality of Sayaxché, a town on the banks of the Pasión River. Dos Pilas lies about east of the border with Mexico, to the southwest of the Maya ruins of Tikal, and west of Tamarindito. Lake Petexbatún and the Pasión River form a part of the drainage of the Usumacinta River.

At the height of its power the kingdom covered an area of some 1,500 square miles (3,885 square km).

The local landscape consists of heavily forested ridges interspersed with low lying wetlands, rivers and lakes. The area is subject to high annual rainfall, averaging .

==Known rulers==


Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil (Ruler 1) (c. 648–692+) was born on 15 October AD 625. He claimed to be a member of the Tikal royal line. On Dos Pilas Panel 6 he names a king of Tikal as his father. He probably saw himself as the legitimate heir to the Tikal throne and defected from Tikal in AD 648 to found Dos Pilas as a rival kingdom under the overlordship of Calakmul. Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil is known to have taken two wives, one of them from the nearby Petexbatún kingdom of Itzan. His father was , who was either the 23rd or 24th ruler in Tikalʼs dynastic line. A daughter of Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil, Wak Chanil Ajaw, left Dos Pilas to found a dynasty at Naranjo.

Itzamnaaj Bʼalam (c. 697) had a short reign. He was the son of Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil and his wife from Itzan.

Itzamnaaj Kʼawiil (Ruler 2) (698–726), another son of Bʼalaj Chan Kawiil, was born in AD 673, probably in Calakmul during his familyʼs exile after Dos Pilas was defeated by Tikal. His birth abroad seems to have been cause for embarrassment, with discrepancies in the calendar dates recorded on monuments likely to be the result of attempts to show that he was born in Dos Pilas itself. He reigned for 28 years. He died on October 726. A stele erected by his successor records that he was buried four days later, at night and within Dos Pilas. A tomb believed to be that of this king was found under Structure L5-1 in the site core.

Uchaʼan Kʼin Bʼalam (Ruler 3, &quot;Master of Sun Jaguar&quot;) (727–741) seems not to have been a direct heir to the throne but rather a regent providing strong leadership while the heir was still a child. Twenty years before his rise to the throne he was already a prominent figure in Dos Pilas, responsible for the capture of the lord of Tikal in AD 705 and being closely involved in rituals performed by the previous king. Uchaʼan Kʼin Bʼalam took a wife from Cancuén, a city that controlled the upper reaches of the Pasión River. &quot;Master of Sun Jaguar&quot; died in May 741, his death is recorded on Stela 1 at his twin capital of Aguateca where it is believed that he was buried, although his tomb has not yet been found.

Kʼawiil Chan Kʼinich (Ruler 4) (741–761+) was installed on the throne of Dos Pilas in June of AD 741, 26 days after the death of &quot;Master of Sun Jaguar&quot;. It is not known when he died but he was forced to flee Dos Pilas in AD 761 and was never mentioned again after that.

==History==
===Early history (pre-A.D. 629)===
The early history of the Dos Pilas site is unclear; there are traces of an earlier indigenous dynasty predating the arrival of Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil from Tikal. From the Early Classic the Petexbatún region had been dominated by a Maya kingdom centred on the sites of Tamarindito and Arroyo de Piedra. Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil founded Dos Pilas within the territory of this pre-existing kingdom and the new city quickly came to dominate the region.

===Founding and consolidation===
The interactions between Classic Period Maya city-states were deeply linked to the long-running power struggle between the two Maya &quot;superpowers&quot;, Tikal and Calakmul, and the history of Dos Pilas is no exception.

====629: Aligned to Tikal====
In AD 629, the Tikal king Kʼinich Muwaan Jol II installed his son Balaj Chan K’awiil, aged four, as ruler of Dos Pilas. With the establishment of the new kingdom, Dos Pilas advertised its origin by adopting the emblem glyph of Tikal as its own. For the next two decades he fought loyally for his brother and overlord at Tikal.

====648: Aligned to Calakmul====
In AD 648, king Yuknoom Chʼeen II (&quot;Yuknoom the Great&quot;) of Calakmul attacked and defeated Dos Pilas, capturing Balaj Chan K’awiil. At about the same time, the king of Tikal was killed. Yuknoom Cheʼen II then reinstated Balaj Chan Kʼawiil upon the throne of Dos Pilas as his vassal. In an extraordinary act of treachery for someone claiming to be of the Tikal royal family, he thereafter served as a loyal ally of Calakmul, Tikalʼs sworn enemy. The exact methods used by Calakmul to induce Balaj Chan Kʼawiil to switch sides are unknown.

====672: Recovered by Tikal====
King Nuun Ujol Chaak of Tikal attacked and captured Dos Pilas in AD 672, driving Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil into a five-year exile, probably in Calakmul.

====677: Restored to Calakmul====
This exile was only ended in AD 677, on the same day that Calakmul celebrated a success over Tikal, revealing Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiilʼs obvious dependency on his foreign overlord.

Tikal and Dos Pilas went to battle again in AD 679 and Tikal suffered a humiliating defeat by its smaller rival. Although Dos Pilas celebrated this as the victorious conclusion of the war, neither side had gained any real advantage over the other. For Dos Pilas, this battle represented the consolidation of its kingdom and the failure of Tikal to crush its splinter state before it gained a foothold. The hieroglyphic texts at Dos Pilas describe the victory in graphic terms, recording &quot;pools of blood&quot; and &quot;piles of heads&quot; as the result of a major battle between the two cities, with Dos Pilas very likely having received military aid from Calakmul. Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil consolidated his power with marriage alliances. He took at least two wives; his main wife was a noblewoman from Itzan, another city in the Pasión drainage. Their marriage produced Balaj Chan Kʼawiilʼs heirs, Itzamnaaj Balam and Itzamnaaj Kʼawiil. Balaj Chan Kʼawiil had a famous daughter with a second wife, this daughter was Lady Six Sky who was despatched to Naranjo to refound its obliterated dynasty. Balaj Chan Kʼawiil is known to have made several further visits to Calakmul; in 682 he celebrated a period ending ceremony there under Yuknoom the Great and in 686 he attended the enthroning of his successor, Yuknoom Yichʼaak Kʼakʼ.

====695: Victory of Tikal over Calakmul====
Calakmul and its allies suffered after the defeat of Calakmul by Tikal in 695, shifting the balance of power in the Maya lowlands. Around this time Balaj Chan Kʼawiil died and was succeeded by one of his sons, Itzamnaaj Balam, although the exact year is not clear from the hieroglyphic texts. Itzamnaaj Balam did not reign for long and he was replaced by his brother Itzamnaaj Kʼawiil in 698.

====705: Tikal defeated====
The war with Tikal continued under the new king and in AD 705 Tikal was again defeated and its lord captured. This victory was overseen by Itzamnaaj Kʼaawiilʼs general Uchaʼan Kʼin Bʼalam, who would later become king himself. After this victory Dos Pilas benefitted from tribute in the form of labour and wealth, resulting in the rapid expansion of the city. At this time Itzamnaaj Kʼawiil ordered the building of the El Duende group centred on a sizeable temple on a hilltop east of the Main Group. Victories over unknown, presumably minor, enemies are recorded to have taken place in AD 717 and 721. Itzamnaaj Kʼawiil raised five stelae in the El Duende group to celebrate his military victories. Itzamnaaj Kʼawiilʼs died in 726 and was buried four days later, as recorded on Stela 8. A royal tomb excavated under Structure 5-1 is probably that of this ruler.

===Campaigns of aggression===

Uchaʼan Kʼin Bʼalam was enthroned in 727, probably as regent for Kʼawiil Chan Kʼinich, Itzamnaaj Kʼawiilʼs young son and heir. By the 8th century AD, Dos Pilas was powerful enough to attack the much larger city of Seibal on the Pasión River. In AD 735 the Lord of Dos Pilas (Ruler 3, &quot;Master of Sun Jaguar&quot;) attacked the city, capturing Yichʼaak Bʼalam, its king. The captive king was not executed but rather became a vassal under the lord of Dos Pilas. At about this time, the nearby site at Aguateca became a twin capital of the Dos Pilas kingdom, with victory monuments being erected simultaneously in both cities.

In AD 743 Kʼawiil Chan Kʼinich, went to war against the sites of Ahkul and El Chorro. Two years later, in AD 745, he went to war against the distant cities of Yaxchilán, on the Usumacinta River, and Motul de San José on Lake Petén Itzá. The capture of the lords of both cities, and also the lord of El Chorro, is depicted on Hieroglyphic Stairway 3.

Dos Pilas continued to exert control over Seibal even after the death of &quot;Master of Sun Jaguar&quot;, with his successor Kʼawiil Chan Kinich presiding over rituals performed at the vassal site in AD 745–7.

===Collapse and abandonment===
Ongoing conflict in the Maya region soon destabilised the whole area following the defeat of Dos Pilasʼ patron Calakmul and in 761 the city was dramatically abandoned after Tamarindito and other Petexbatún centres rebelled against their Dos Pilas overlord. A hieroglyphic stairway at Tamarindito mentions the enforced flight of Kʼawiil Chan Kʼinich, who was never mentioned again. The Dos Pilas royal family probably transported itself to the more defensible Aguateca, which lies only 10 km to the southeast. The violent end of Dos Pilas is evident from the smashed remains of a royal throne recovered from the Bat Palace. The entire Petexbatún region was engulfed by warfare in the late 8th century AD until almost all the settlements of the former Dos Pilas kingdom were abandoned. The monuments of Ixlú in the central Petén lakes region bear some hieroglyphic texts that closely resemble texts from Dos Pilas, suggesting that the lords of Ixlú may have been refugees from the collapse of the Petexbatún region.

A small group of refugees occupied Dos Pilas after its abandonment, throwing up hastily built defensive walls constructed from stone stripped from the deserted temples and palaces. These palisaded walls formed concentric patterns with no regard for the pre-existing architecture at the site. This village was overrun and itself abandoned in the early years of the 9th century AD, at which point the history of Dos Pilas as a settlement ends.

The collapse of the Dos Pilas state seems to have benefited other sites in the region, such as Itzan, Cancuén and Machaquila, which all demonstrate renewed strength coincident with the fall of the city.

===Rediscovery and exploration===
The ruins of Dos Pilas were first reported in 1953–4 by two brothers from Sayaxché, José and Lisandro Flores, but local residents probably already knew of their existence. Pierre Ivanoff lead an expedition to the site in 1960. He described the ruins, which he called ʼʼDos Pozosʼʼ (ʼʼtwo wellsʼʼ in Spanish) in his 1973 book ʼʼMonuments of a Civilization: Mayaʼʼ, in which he claimed to have discovered the ruins.

Archaeologist Arthur Demarest of Vanderbilt University and Juan Antonio Valdés of the University of San Carlos of Guatemala started excavations at Dos Pilas in 1989. Hieroglyphic Stairway 4 was discovered in 1990 and a year later the tomb of Itzamnaaj Kʼawiil was excavated. The project continued through to 1994, supported by the National Geographic Society, the Instituto de Antropología e Historia (IDAEH - Institute of Anthropology and History), Vanderbilt University and several other organisations.

==The site==
Dos Pilas is a modest sized site, covering about . It was founded in an area with little previous occupation at a distance of only 4 km from the pre-existing settlement at Arroyo de Piedra. The general preservation of the site is poor due to the desperate stripping of stone from the principal buildings in order to build defensive walls immediately prior to the complete abandonment of the site. Hieroglyphic inscriptions at the site have been identified as belonging to the Chʼolan Maya language.

The site is laid out around three monumental complexes aligned upon an east-west axis, in a form that is reminiscent of the Preclassic layouts at El Mirador and Nakbe in the far north of Petén. The Main Group is the westernmost of the monumental complexes, while the El Duende group is the easternmost.

A series of concentric rubble walls were built immediately before the cityʼs abandonment, surrounding the Main Group and the El Duende Group. These hastily built fortifications were topped with a wooden palisade.

===Main Group===
The Main Group was laid out around a central plaza by Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil. Stelae 1 and 2 are located in the centre of the plaza. Stela 1 depicts an elaborately attired Itzamnaaj Kʼawiil and dates to AD 706. It records the defeat of a Tikal lord and contains the last known reference to that city so far recovered from inscriptions at Dos Pilas. Stela 2 is badly damaged and depicts the defeat of Yichʼaak Bʼalam of Seibal by &quot;Master of Sun Jaguar&quot;. The plaza is enclosed on all four sides by structures; at least two of the surrounding structures were accessed via hieroglyphic stairways. South of the main plaza are a series of smaller elevated plazas with more restricted access, bordered by multi-roomed buildings. A further two hieroglyphic stairways have been found in this area.

*ʼʼʼL4-35ʼʼʼ is a structure located on the west side of the plaza. At its base is Hieroglyphic Stairway 1, which records events during the life of Itzamnaaj Kʼawiil.
*ʼʼʼLD-49ʼʼʼ (also referred to as L5-49) is a large pyramid to the south of the plaza and is topped by three temple sanctuaries. The pyramid is the largest structure in the site core and rises about 20 meters over the plaza. This pyramidʼs main stairway (known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 2) contains at least eighteen hieroglyphic steps, describing the arrival and life of Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil. The discovery of eight new hieroglyphic steps in 2001–2002 and their interpretation lead to a complete reevaluation of the early history of the site, throwing light upon the wider Maya politics involved with the break from Tikal, formerly seen as an internal affair. The steps currently ʼʼin situʼʼ are replicas put in place after looters stole a section of Step 6 containing four glyphs in January 2003. The original steps were removed to a secure location. Flanking the stairway at the east and west ends are Panel 6 and Panel 7, both bearing hieroglyphic inscriptions. The well-preserved Panel 10 is located part of the way up the east side of the pyramid. Panel 10 was originally a stela at Arroyo de Piedra, it was moved and re-erected here after Dos Pilas conquered its neighbour.
*ʼʼʼLD-25ʼʼʼ is a temple pyramid built by Kʼawiil Chan Kʼinich. Hieroglyphic Stairway 3 is located 120 meters south of the southeast corner of the plaza, it is a part of this structure and describes some of this kingʼs victories in AD 743 and 745.
*Structure ʼʼʼL5-1ʼʼʼ is a ruined building on the east side of the plaza containing a vaulted crypt 9 meters beneath its summit. Inside were found the remains of an individual wearing a heavy jade collar and wristlets accompanied by offerings of fine painted ceramics and almost 400 pieces of shell mosaic that once formed a headdress. Due to the nearby Stela 8, positioned in front of this structure and containing a text relating the life, death and burial of king Itzamnaaj Kʼawiil, the tomb is presumed to be that of this king.
*The ʼʼʼpalaceʼʼʼ of Bʼalaj Chan K’awiil was torn down by the last inhabitants of Dos Pilas in order to build defensive walls immediately prior to the abandonment of the city. It lies about 100 meters south of the plaza, behind Structure LD-49. Hieroglyphic Stairway 4 is located on the east side of the destroyed palace and was discovered when the defensive wall that crosses it was being excavated. Hieroglyphic Stairway 4 details the history of Bʼalaj Chan K’awiil and the founding of the Dos Pilas dynasty.
*A ʼʼʼball courtʼʼʼ lies at the northeast corner of the plaza. The structures forming its sides are designated as L4-16 and L4-17. These structures bear the heavily eroded Panel 11 and Panel 12, both of which show a standing lord wielding a spear.

===El Duende group===
The El Duende group lies about 1 km to the east of the site core. This group was built by Itzamnaaj Kʼawiil after his victory over Tikal in 705. El Duende is the largest pyramid in the city, built by enlarging and terracing a natural hill some way from the site core, giving the impression of a single massive structure. The terraces supported five stelae and altar pairs, commissioned by Itzamnaaj Kʼawiil in the early 8th century AD. During excavations in 1991, a sinkhole near the western limit of the El Duende complex discovered a 1.5 km long cave that passes directly under the temple, which was named ʼʼCueva de Río El Duendeʼʼ (River Cave of El Duende) by archaeologists. Within the cave were found abundant artifacts and human bones. Smaller buildings flank the main platform.

===The Bat Palace===
The Bat Palace (also known as the Murciélagos Group, from ʼʼmurciélagoʼʼ, Spanish for &quot;bat&quot;) lies halfway between the site core and the El Duende group, being 0.5 km to the east of the main plaza and 0.5 km to the west of the El Duende pyramid. The Bat Palace was the political centre of Dos Pilas from AD 725 until the city was abandoned in AD 761. Excavations of the Bat Palace revealed that it was an exclusive, closed elite compound with ritual significance, with a cave entrance emerging within the palace and being marked by a shrine with offerings over the buried entrance. The Bat Palace is believed to have been the most important elite area of Dos Pilas during the reigns of the last two rulers of the city. The entrance to the palace complex was flanked by two small temples built of masonry, leading to two courtyards. The courtyards were enclosed by masonry buildings with perishable roofs. A smashed royal throne was found in the Bat Palace, evidence of the violent conquest of the city in the Late Classic.

===Monuments===
ʼʼʼStela 8ʼʼʼ was raised in front of Structure L5-1. Its text describes the principal events of king Itzamnaaj Kʼawiilʼs life, and mentions his death and burial in AD 726.

===Caves===

During excavations, a total of 22 caves were located in the immediate vicinity of the Dos Pilas, totaling over 11 km in length. There are five major caves; Cueva de El Duende, Cueva de Río El Duende, Cueva de Río Murciélagos, Cueva de Sangre and Cueva de Kaxon Pec. Only these major caves were excavated and the offerings recovered from these caves included a sizeable amount of Preclassic pottery. The strong Preclassic traces found in the caves would imply that the caves were important long before the warlike Dos Pilas state was founded in the Late Classic. All the major architecture at Dos Pilas dates from the Late Classic and is aligned with important cave systems, showing that the builders of the city incorporated a thousand-year-old sacred landscape into the design of their city.

On the hill forming the base of the El Duende group were erected several stelae containing toponym glyphs. One of these glyphs refers to water and the cave contains an underground lake directly underneath the hill, making it likely that the toponym is referring to this particular body of water. The fact that the El Duende group were originally named after this subterranean water source demonstrates how important this cave was to the ancient inhabitants of Dos Pilas.

The entrance to the ʼʼʼCave of Batsʼʼʼ (Cueva de Río Murciélagos) lies 75 meters to the northwest of the Bat Palace. Although relatively dry in the dry season, after rainfall water can pour out through the cave mouth at a rate of 8m³/second, creating enough noise to be heard in the main plaza 500 meters away. Although the seasonal flow of water has washed away almost all archaeological remains from the cave, archaeologists consider that the Cave of Bats was of ceremonial importance to the inhabitants of Dos Pilas due to the dramatic torrent that flows through it in the wet season.

Investigation of the various caves at Dos Pilas revealed that all of the larger caves were part of a single drainage system and that the Cave of Bats is the drainage outlet for the system, this cave therefore being connected to the Cueva de Río El Duende. A continuation of the Cave of Bats was found to emerge inside the Bat Palace, where it was marked by a shrine.

A plaza group directly overlies the principal chamber of the ʼʼʼCueva de El Duendeʼʼʼ (not to be confused with the similarly named Cueva de Río El Duende), which lies just southwest of the El Duende pyramid. A 2 meter deep midden was discovered in this cave showing heavy use during the Preclassic and Classic periods. A ceramic vessel bearing the earliest dynastic text yet recovered from Dos Pilas was found in this midden. A thick cap of sterile yellow clay covers much of the floor of the main chamber, it appears to have been deliberately deposited in order to cover the entrance to the caveʼs longest tunnel, which passes underneath the El Duende pyramid and connects with the Cueva de Río El Duende. In the entrance of the cave were found large quantities of rubble, much of it consisting of finely dressed stone that had been stripped from nearby buildings and used to block the cave entrance. James E. Brady believes that the blocking of this sacred cave was a part of a termination ritual carried out by the conquerors of Dos Pilas, who also blocked the entrances of the Cueva de Sangre (Cave of Blood) and possibly the western entrance of the Cueva de Río El Duende, suggesting that the caves were enormously important.

The ʼʼʼCueva de Sangreʼʼʼ (Cave of Blood) is located about 2 km east of the El Duende group, it has more than 3 km of tunnel running underneath a small hill. The cave has four entrances, two of which had been blocked with rubble as at Cueva de El Duende. The west entrance appears to have been the principal entrance used by the ancient inhabitants of Dos Pilas. A small building was built above this entrance, the function of this building must have been linked to the use of the cave itself. A stone wall enclosed both the cave entrance and the building itself. Preclassic ceramic fragments were found inside the Cueva de Sangre.

<text>Baden (Central Bavarian: &quot;Bodn&quot;), unofficially distinguished from other Badens as Baden bei Wien (Baden near Vienna), is a spa town in Austria. It serves as the capital of Baden District in the state of Lower Austria. Located about south of Vienna, the municipality consists of cadastral areas Baden, Braiten, Gamingerhof, Leesdorf, Mitterberg, Rauhenstein, and Weikersdorf.

In 2021, the town became part of the transnational UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name &quot;Great Spa Towns of Europe&quot; because of its famous medicinal springs and its architectural testimony to the international spa culture on the 18th and 19th centuries.

==Geography and Geology==

Baden is located at the mouth of the Schwechat River&#x27;s St Helena Valley (&#x27;) in the Vienna Woods (&#x27;) range. It takes its name from the area&#x27;s 14 hot springs, which vary in temperature from and contain mineral salts including calcium carbonate, calcium chloride and magnesium sulphate. They lie for the most part at the foot of Mt Calvary (&quot;&quot;; ) in the north-central part of town. These springs are caused by runoff from the Northern Limestone Alps and tectonic fissures within the Vienna Basin.

The highest point in the area is the Iron Gate (&#x27; or &#x27;), whose can be ascended in about three hours.

==History==
The celebrity of Baden dates back to the days of the Romans, who knew it by the name of &#x27; or &#x27;. Some ruins are still visible. The settlement was mentioned as Padun in a deed from AD 869. The nearby abbey of Heiligenkreuz&#x27;s Romanesque church was constructed in the 11th century; it subsequently served as the burial place for members of the Babenberg family. The castle Rauheneck was constructed on the right bank of the river at the entrance to the valley in the 12th century; the castle Rauhenstein was built on the opposite bank at the same time. The town received its legal privileges in 1480. Although repeatedly sacked by Hungarians and Turks, it soon flourished again each time. 
The town was largely destroyed by a fire in 1812 but was excellently rebuilt in a Biedermeier style according to plans by architect Joseph Kornhäusel, it is therefore sometimes referred to as the &quot;Biedermeierstadt&quot;. Archduke Charles, the victor of Aspern, constructed the Weilburg Palace at the foot of Rauheneck between 1820 and 1825. In the 19th century, it was connected to the railway running between Vienna and Graz, which led to thousands of Viennese visiting each year to take the waters, including members of the imperial family, who constructed extensive villas nearby. In 1820, the Sauerhof became the first freestanding spa hotel in Europe. The composer Ludwig van Beethoven stayed a number of times in Baden and his residences still form local tourist spots. The location at Rathausgasse 10 now forms a museum open to the public. Mayerling, a hunting lodge about up the valley, was the site of Crown Prince Rudolf&#x27;s murder-suicide in 1889. Its primary export in the 19th century were steel razors, which were reckoned of excellent quality.

The town boasted a theater, military hospital, and casino, all constructed in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The City Theater (&#x27;) was built in 1909 by Ferdinand Fellner. By the time of the First World War, Baden was Vienna&#x27;s principal resort: came each year, double the town&#x27;s local population. In addition to a modern &quot;spa house&quot; (&#x27;), there were 15 separate bathing establishments and several parks. During the war, Baden served as a temporary seat of the Austro-Hungarian high command. A new casino in 1934 made the town the premier resort throughout Austria. The Château Weilburg was destroyed during World War II. After World War II, Baden served as the headquarters of Soviet forces within occupied Austria until 1955.

==Transport==
Baden can be reached by the Süd Autobahn (A2). It lies on the Südbahn (Southern Railway), the Baden railway station is served by S-Bahn, regional trains, and the Cityjet Xpress train connecting it directly to Vienna and Wiener Neustadt every 30 minutes during peak hours.

It also the terminus of the local Badner Bahn tram-train.

==Government==
Kurt Staska (ÖVP) was Baden&#x27;s Bürgermeister as a result of elections of 2015, but he resigned at the end of 2016 and Stefan Szirucsek became the new Bürgermeister (Mayor). His deputy is Helga Krismer from the Greens.

<text>Baden-Baden () is a spa town in the state of Baden-Württemberg, south-western Germany, at the north-western border of the Black Forest mountain range on the small river Oos, ten kilometres (six miles) east of the Rhine, the border with France, and forty kilometres (twenty-five miles) north-east of Strasbourg, France.

In 2021, the town became part of the transnational UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name &quot;Great Spa Towns of Europe&quot;, because of its famous spas and architecture that exemplifies the popularity of spa towns in Europe in the 18th through 20th centuries.

==Name==
The springs at Baden-Baden were known to the Romans as &#x27; (&quot;The Waters&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;Aurelia-of-the-Waters&quot;) after M. Aurelius Severus Alexander Augustus.

In modern German, &#x27; is a noun meaning &quot;bathing&quot; but Baden, the original name of the town, derives from an earlier plural form of &#x27; (&quot;bath&quot;). (Modern German uses the plural form &quot;&quot;.) As with the English placename &quot;Bath&quot;, other Badens are at hot springs throughout Central Europe. The current doubled name arose to distinguish it from the others, particularly Baden near Vienna in Austria and Baden near Zürich in Switzerland. The original Margraviate of Baden (1112-1535) split into several territories, including Baden-Baden and Baden-Durlach. The name &quot;Baden-Baden&quot; distinguished the Margraviate of Baden-Baden (1535–1771), from the Margraviate of Baden-Durlach. &quot;Baden-Baden&quot; thus means the town of Baden in the territory of Baden, whereas the name of the Margraviate of Baden-Baden meant &quot;the Margraviate of Baden with its princely seat at Baden&quot;. Baden-Baden formally got its current name in 1931. 

==Geography==
Baden-Baden lies in a valley of the Northern Black Forest in southwestern Germany. The western districts lie within the Upper Rhine Plain. The highest mountain of Baden-Baden is the Badener Höhe (), which is part of the Black Forest National Park. The old town lies on the side of a hill on the right bank of the Oos. Since the 19th century, the principal resorts have been located on the other side of the river. There are 29 natural springs in the area, varying in temperature from . The water is rich in salt and flows from artesian wells under Florentine Hill at a rate of 341 litres (90 gallons) per minute and is conveyed through pipes to the town&#x27;s baths.

==History==
Roman settlement at Baden-Baden has been dated as far back as the emperor Hadrian, but on dubious authority. The known ruins of the Roman bath were rediscovered just below the New Castle in 1847 and date to the reign of Caracalla (AD 210s), who visited the area to relieve his arthritic aches. The facilities were used by the Roman garrison in Strasbourg.

The town fell into ruin but its church was first constructed in the 7th century. By 1112, it was the seat of the Margraviate of Baden. The Lichtenthal Convent (&#x27;) was founded in 1254. The margraves initially used Hohenbaden Castle (the Old Castle, &#x27;), whose ruins still occupy the summit above the town, but they completed and moved to the New Castle (&quot;) in 1479. The Margraviate was divided in 1535, with Baden-Baden becoming the capital of the Margraviate of Baden-Baden, while the other portion became the Margraviate of Baden-Durlach. The Baden-Baden witch trials, an investigating encompassing the entire territory and resulting in hundreds of verdicts, took place in 1627-1631. Baden suffered severely during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, particularly at the hands of the French, who plundered it in 1643. They returned to occupy the city in 1688 at the onset of the Nine Years&#x27; War, burning it to the ground the next year. The margravine Sibylla rebuilt the New Castle in 1697, but the margrave Louis William removed his seat to Rastatt in 1706. The Stiftskirche was rebuilt in 1753 and houses the tombs of several of the margraves.

The town began its recovery in the late 18th century, serving as a refuge for émigrés from the French Revolution. The town was frequented during the Second Congress of Rastatt in 1797–99 and became popular after the visit of the Prussian queen in the early 19th century. She came for medicinal reasons, as the waters were recommended for gout, rheumatism, paralysis, neuralgia, skin disorders, and stones. The Ducal government subsequently subsidized the resort&#x27;s development. The town became a meeting place for the nobility and prosperous upper middle classes, who visited the hot springs and the town&#x27;s other amenities: luxury hotels, the Spielbank Casino, horse races, and the gardens of the Lichtentaler Allee. Guests included Queen Victoria, Wilhelm I, and Berlioz. The pumproom (&quot;) was completed in 1842. The Grand Duchy&#x27;s railway&#x27;s mainline reached Baden in 1845. Reaching its zenith under Napoleon III in the 1850s and &#x27;60s, Baden became &quot;Europe&#x27;s summer capital&quot;. With a population of around , the town&#x27;s size could quadruple during the tourist season, with the French, British, Russians, and Americans all well represented. (French tourism fell off following the Franco-Prussian War.)

The theater was completed in 1861 and a Greek church with a gilt dome was erected on the Michaelsberg in 1863 to serve as the tomb of the teenage son of the prince of Moldavia Mihail Sturdza after he died during a family vacation. A Russian Orthodox church was also subsequently erected. The casino was closed for a time in the 1870s.
Just before the First World War, the town was receiving visitors each year.

During the Second World War, 3.1% of the houses in Baden-Baden were completely destroyed by bombs and 125 civilians were killed. 5.8% of the houses were heavily damaged by bombs. Lichtenthal, a residential area in the southwest of the town, was hit by bombs and Saint Bonifatius Church was severely damaged on 11 March 1943. Balg, a residential area in the northeast of Baden-Baden, was hit by bombs on 17 December 1944. On 30 December 1944 one third of the buildings of Oos (i.e. about 300 houses), a residential area in the north of the town, was destroyed or heavily damaged by bombs and Saint Dionysius Church was severely damaged as well. On 2 January 1945 the railway station of Oos and various barracks on Schwarzwald Road were heavily damaged by bombs. 
After World War II, Baden-Baden became the headquarters of the French occupation forces in Germany as well as of the Südwestfunk, one of Germany&#x27;s large public broadcasting stations, which is now part of Südwestrundfunk. From 23–28 September 1981, the 11th Olympic Congress took place in Baden-Baden&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. The Festspielhaus Baden-Baden, Germany&#x27;s largest opera and concert house, opened in 1998.

CFB Baden-Soellingen, a military airfield built in the 1950s in the Upper Rhine Plain, west of downtown Baden-Baden, was converted into a civil airport in the 1990s. Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden Airport, or Baden Airpark is now the second-largest airport in Baden-Württemberg by number of passengers.

In 1981 Baden-Baden hosted the Olympic Congress, which later made the town awarded the designation Olympic town.

It is located in the Rotterdam–The Hague metropolitan area, west of the city Rotterdam, east of the town Vlaardingen and south of the city Delft. In the south, Schiedam is also connected to the village of Pernis via the Benelux tunnel.

The town is known for its historical center with canals, and for having the tallest windmills in the world.

Schiedam is also well known for the distilleries and malthouses and production of jenever, such as the internationally renowned Ketel One; in French and English, the word &quot;schiedam&quot; (usually without a capital &quot;s-&quot;) refers to the town&#x27;s jenever. This was the town&#x27;s main industry during the early Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th century, a period to which it owed its former nickname &quot;Zwart Nazareth&quot; (&quot;Black Nazareth&quot;).

The town is also known for Saint Lidwina, one of the most famous Dutch saints, whose relics are located in the town’s basilica.

== History ==

Schiedam was founded around the year 1230. The river Schie was dammed by the Lord of Wassenaer and the Amtlord Dirk Bokel of the Amt Mathenesse, this to protect the existing polderland against the seawater from the North Sea. In 1247, Lady Adelaide (Aleida) of Holland married John I, Count of Hainaut. As dowry she received from him the eastern part of the dam together with the adjacent polder. The dam attracted many trade activities because goods for and from the hinterland (Delft, and further away Leiden and Haarlem) had to be transhipped. A small town developed swiftly around the dam and its activities. In the year 1275 Schiedam received town privileges from Lady Adelaide, this in her capacity as sister of William II, the reigning Count of Holland and King of the Romans. She ordered the building of Te Riviere Castle near the Schie, which is known today as &quot;Castle Mathenesse&quot; (Dutch: &quot;Huis te Riviere&quot; or &quot;Slot Mathenesse&quot;). Remnants of a donjon, which were once part of the castle, are still visible today in the centre of Schiedam and near the town office.

As a young settlement Schiedam soon got competition from surrounding towns and cities: in 1340, Rotterdam and Delft also were allowed to establish a connection between the Schie and the Meuse. From the 15th century onwards the town flourished as a place of pilgrimage due to the devotion afforded to Saint Lidwina, one of the most famous Dutch saints who lived her life in Schiedam. The town subsequently gained significance by fishing for herring. In 1428 a great fire swept through Schiedam, destroying large parts of the then wooden town.

In 1575 the world&#x27;s first known commercial distillery started operations in Schiedam. The 18th century was Schiedam&#x27;s Golden Age, when the gin industry flourished. The standstill in drink imports from France made the boom in Schiedam&#x27;s distilleries possible. From dozens of distilleries Schiedam jenever was exported throughout the world. The gin industry gave the town its nickname &quot;Black Nazareth&quot;. This industry is now largely gone. Five windmills in the town, called &quot;De Noord&quot;, &quot;Walvisch&quot;, &quot;Drie Koornbloemen&quot;, &quot;Nieuwe Palmboom&quot; and &quot;Vrijheid&quot; − are the highest traditional-style windmills in the world because they had to stick out above the high warehouses, and many storehouses are relics of this past. In one of the former factories at the Lange Haven the National Jenever Museum operates.

On 10 August 1856, the first major train accident in the Netherlands happened near Schiedam Centrum railway station, causing 3 deaths. On 4 May 1976 the 1976 Schiedam train accident also took place near the station, which caused 24 deaths.

At the end of the 19th and throughout the 20th century, the shipbuilding industry boomed in Schiedam, with large companies like Wilton-Fijenoord and others. In 1941, the ancient municipalities Kethel en Spaland were merged with Schiedam, which made large expansions of the town possible with residential areas in the north. At the end of the 20th century, the shipbuilding industry largely disappeared and today, Schiedam is mainly a commuter-area in the Rotterdam metropolitan area.

== Geography ==
The town of Schiedam is located in the province of South Holland. It is enclosed between Rotterdam (east), Midden-Delfland (north), Vlaardingen (west) and the river Nieuwe Maas (south).

<doc id="88160" wikidata="Q16068" url="?curid=88160" title="Deutsche Mark">
<text>The Deutsche Mark (; &quot;German mark&quot;), abbreviated &quot;DM&quot; or &quot;D-Mark&quot; (), was the official currency of West Germany from 1948 until 1990 and later the unified Germany from 1990 until the adoption of the euro in 2002. In English, it was typically called the &quot;Deutschmark&quot; ( ). One Deutsche Mark was divided into 100 pfennigs.

It was first issued under Allied occupation in 1948 to replace the Reichsmark and served as the Federal Republic of Germany&#x27;s official currency from its founding the following year. On 31 December 1998, the Council of the European Union fixed the irrevocable exchange rate, effective 1 January 1999, for German mark to euros as DM 1.95583 = €1. In 1999, the Deutsche Mark was replaced by the euro; its coins and banknotes remained in circulation, defined in terms of euros, until the introduction of euro notes and coins on 1 January 2002. The Deutsche Mark ceased to be legal tender immediately upon the introduction of the euro—in contrast to the other eurozone states, where the euro and legacy currency circulated side by side for up to two months. Mark coins and banknotes continued to be accepted as valid forms of payment in Germany until 1 March 2002.

The has guaranteed that all German marks in cash form may be changed into euros indefinitely, and one may do so in person at any branch of the Bundesbank in Germany. Banknotes and coins can even be sent to the Bundesbank by mail. In 2012, it was estimated that as many as 13.2 billion marks were in circulation, with one poll from 2011 showing a narrow majority of Germans favouring the currency&#x27;s restoration (although only a minority believed this would bring any economic benefit). Polls in the early 2020s indicated only a minority of Germans supported reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark.

==History==

===Before 1871===

A mark had been the currency of Germany since its original unification in 1871. Before that time, the different German states issued a variety of different currencies, the most common being the North German thaler and the South German gulden. By 1857, both currencies were linked to the Vereinsthaler, a silver coin containing grams of pure silver. Although the German gold mark was based on gold rather than silver (at 2.79 marks per gram of fine gold), a fixed exchange rate between the Vereinsthaler and the mark of 3 marks = 1 Vereinsthaler was used for the conversion.

===1873–1948===
The first mark, known as the &quot;Goldmark&quot;, was introduced in 1873. With the outbreak of World War I, the mark was taken off the gold standard. The currency thus became known as the &quot;Papiermark&quot;, especially as high inflation, then hyperinflation occurred and the currency became exclusively made up of paper money. The &quot;Papiermark&quot; was replaced by the &quot;Rentenmark&quot; (RM) from 15 November 1923, and the &quot;Reichsmark&quot; (ℛ︁ℳ︁) in 1924.

===Early military occupation following WWII===
During the first two years of occupation the occupying powers of France, United Kingdom, United States, and the Soviet Union were not able to successfully negotiate a possible currency reform in Germany. Due to the strains between the Allies each zone was governed independently as regards monetary matters. The US occupation policy was governed by the directive JCS 1067 (in effect until July 1947), which forbade the US military governor &quot;to take any steps to strengthen German financial structure&quot;. As a consequence a separate monetary reform in the U.S. zone was not possible. Each of the Allies printed its own occupation currency.

===Currency reform of June 1948===
The Deutsche Mark was officially introduced on Sunday 20 June 1948 by Ludwig Erhard. Large amounts were exchanged for 10 ℛ︁ℳ︁ to 65pf. In addition, each person received a per capita allowance of DM 60 in two parts, the first being DM 40 and the second DM 20.

A few weeks later Erhard, acting against orders, issued an edict abolishing many economic controls which had been originally implemented by the Nazis, and which the Allies had not removed. He did this, as he often confessed, on Sunday because the offices of the American, British, and French occupation authorities were closed that day. He was sure that if he had done it when they were open, they would have countermanded the order.

The introduction of the new currency was intended to protect western Germany from a second wave of hyperinflation and to stop the rampant barter and black market trade (where cigarettes were used as currency). Although the new currency was initially only distributed in the three western occupation zones outside Berlin, the move angered the Soviet authorities, who regarded it as a threat. The Soviets promptly cut off all road, rail and canal links between the three western zones and West Berlin, starting the Berlin Blockade. In response, the U.S. and Britain launched an airlift of food and coal and distributed the new currency in West Berlin as well.

====Economics of 1948 currency reform====
Since the 1930s, prices and wages had been controlled, but money had been plentiful. That meant that people had accumulated large paper assets, and that official prices and wages did not reflect reality, as the black market dominated the economy and more than half of all transactions were taking place unofficially. The reform replaced the old money with the new Deutsche Mark at the rate of one new per ten old. This wiped out 90% of government and private debt, as well as private savings. Prices were decontrolled, and labor unions agreed to accept a 15% wage increase, despite the 25% rise in prices. The result was the prices of German export products held steady, while profits and earnings from exports soared and were poured back into the economy. The currency reforms were simultaneous with the $1.4 billion in Marshall Plan money coming in from the United States, which primarily was used for investment. In addition, the Marshall plan forced German companies, as well as those in all of Western Europe, to modernize their business practices, and take account of the wider market.

Marshall plan funding overcame bottlenecks in the surging economy caused by remaining controls (which were removed in 1949), and opened up a greatly expanded market for German exports. Overnight, consumer goods appeared in the stores, because they could be sold for higher prices. While the availability of consumer goods is seen as a giant success story by most historians of the present, the perception at the time was a different one: prices were so high that average people could not afford to shop, especially since prices were free-ranging but wages still fixed by law. Therefore, in the summer of 1948 a giant wave of strikes and demonstrations swept over West Germany, leading to an incident in Stuttgart where strikers were met by US tanks (&quot;Stuttgarter Vorfälle&quot;). Only after the wage-freeze was abandoned, Deutschmark and free-ranging prices were accepted by the population.

====Currency reform in the Soviet occupation zone====
In the Soviet occupation zone of Germany (later the German Democratic Republic), the East German mark (also named &quot;Deutsche Mark&quot; from 1948 to 1964 and colloquially referred to as the &quot;Ostmark&quot;—literally &quot;Eastmark&quot;) was introduced a few days afterwards in the form of Reichsmark and Rentenmark notes with adhesive stamps to stop the flooding in of Reichsmark and Rentenmark notes from the West. In July 1948, a completely new series of East German mark banknotes was issued.

====&quot;Bank deutscher Länder&quot; and the &quot;Deutsche Bundesbank&quot;====
Later in 1948, the &quot;Bank deutscher Länder&quot; (&quot;Bank of the German States&quot;) assumed responsibility, followed in 1957 by the . The Deutsche Mark earned a reputation as a strong store of value at times when other national currencies succumbed to periods of inflation. It became a source of national pride and an anchor for the country&#x27;s economic prosperity, particularly during the years of the &quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot; in the 1950s.

===Currency union with the Saarland===
The population in the Saar Protectorate rejected in a referendum the proposal to turn it into a &quot;European territory&quot;. Despite French pre-referendum claims that a &quot;no&quot; vote would mean that the Saar would remain a French protectorate it in fact resulted in the incorporation of the Saar into the Federal Republic of Germany on 1 January 1957. The new German member state of the Saarland maintained its currency, the Saar franc, which was in a currency union at par with the French franc. On 9 July 1959 the Deutsche Mark replaced the Saar franc at a ratio of 100 francs = DM 0.8507.

===German reunification===
The Deutsche Mark played an important role in the reunification of Germany. It was introduced as the official currency of East Germany in July 1990, replacing the East German mark (&quot;Mark der DDR&quot;), in preparation for unification on 3 October 1990. East German marks were exchanged for Deutsche Marks at a rate of 1:1 for the first M 4,000 and 2:1 for larger amounts. Before reunification, each citizen of East Germany coming to West Germany was given &quot;Begrüßungsgeld&quot; (welcome money), a per capita allowance of DM 100 in cash. The government of Germany and the Bundesbank were in major disagreement over the exchange rate between the East German mark and the German mark.

France and the United Kingdom were opposed to German reunification, and attempted to influence the Soviet Union to stop it. However, in late 1989 France extracted German commitment to the Monetary Union in return for support for German reunification.

==Stability==
The German mark had a reputation as one of the world&#x27;s most stable currencies; this was based on the monetary policy of the &quot;Bundesbank&quot;. The policy was &quot;hard&quot; in relation to the policies of certain other central banks in Europe. The &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; was in respect to the aims of inflation and political interference. This policy was the foundation of the European Central Bank&#x27;s present policy towards the euro. The German mark&#x27;s stability was greatly apparent in 1993, when speculation on the French franc and other European currencies caused a change in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. However, it should be remembered that &quot;hard&quot; is relative only if it is compared to other currencies, as in its 53-year history, the purchasing power of the German mark was reduced by over 70%.

==Coins==
The first Deutsche Mark coins were issued by the in 1948 and 1949. From 1950, the inscription (Federal Republic of Germany) appeared on the coins. These coins were issued in denominations of 1pf, 2pf, 5pf, 10pf, and 50pf. The 1pf and 2pf coins were struck in bronze clad steel (although during some years the 2pf was issued in solid bronze) while 5pf and 10pf were brass clad steel and the 50-pfennig was in cupronickel. In 1950, cupronickel DM1 coins were released, while a cupronickel DM2 and a .625 silver DM5 were released in 1951. Cupronickel replaced silver in the DM5 in 1975. The DM2 and DM5 coins have often been used for commemorative themes, though typically only the generic design for the DM5 is intended for circulation. Commemorative silver DM10 coins have also been issued which have periodically found their way into circulation. Unlike other European countries, Germany retained the use of the smallest coins (1pf and 2pf) until adoption of the euro.
The weights and dimensions of the coins can be found in an FAQ of the . Unlike other countries (such as Australia) there was no attempt or proposal suggested for the withdrawal of the 1pf and 2pf coins. Both coins were still in circulation in 2001 and supermarkets in particular still marked prices to the nearest pfennig. This penchant for accuracy continues with the euro (while Finland or the Netherlands for example, price to the nearest 5 cents) with the 1-cent coin still encountered in Germany.

There were a considerable number of commemorative silver DM 5 and DM 10 coins, which actually had the status of legal tender but were rarely seen outside of collectors&#x27; circles.
On 27 December 2000, the German government enacted a law authorizing the to issue, in 2001, a special .999 pure gold DM 1 coin commemorating the end of the German mark. The coin had the exact design and dimensions of the circulating cupro-nickel DM 1 coin, with the exception of the inscription on the reverse, which read (instead of ), as the was the issuing authority in this case. A total of one million gold DM 1 coins were minted (200,000 at each of the five mints) and were sold beginning in mid-2001 through German coin dealers on behalf of the . The issue price varied by the dealer but averaged approximately US$165.

German coins bear a mint mark, indicating where the coin was minted. D indicates Munich, F Stuttgart, G Karlsruhe and J Hamburg. Coins minted during the Second World War include the mint marks A (Berlin) and B (Vienna). The mint mark A was also used for German mark coins minted in Berlin beginning in 1990 following the reunification of Germany. These mint marks have been continued on the German euro coins.

Between 1 July 1990 (the currency union with East Germany) and 1 July 1991, East German coins in denominations up to 50 s continued to circulate as Deutsche Mark coins at their face value, owing to a temporary shortage of small coins. These coins were legal tender only in the territory of the former East Germany.

===Colloquial expressions===
In colloquial German the 10pf coin was sometimes called a (compare: groat). Likewise, (&#x27;sixer&#x27;) could refer to a coin of 5pf. Both colloquialisms refer to several pre-1871 currencies of the previously independent states (notably Prussia), where a was subdivided into 12 s, hence half a into 6. After 1871, 12 old s would be converted into 10pf of the mark, hence 10pf coins inherited the name and 5pf coins inherited the name. Both usages are only regional and may not be understood in areas where a coin did not exist before 1871. In particular, the usage of is less widespread. In northern Germany the DM 5 coin used to be also called a , whereas in Bavaria the DM 2 coin was called and this expression is now used for the €2 coin in the region.

==Banknotes==

There were four series of German mark banknotes:
* The first was issued in 1948 by the Allied military. There were denominations of DM, DM 1, DM 2, DM 5, DM 10, DM 20, DM 50 and DM 100, with two designs of DM 20 and DM 50.
* The second series (BdL) was introduced in 1948 by the &quot;Bank deutscher Länder&quot;, an institution of the western occupation government. The designs were similar to the US Dollar and French franc, as the job of designing and printing the different denominations was shared between the Bank of France and the American Bank Note Company. There were denominations of 5pf and 10pf, DM 5, DM 10, DM 20, DM 50 and DM 100 marks. The last of the banknotes (DM 5 and DM 10) were phased out by 31 July 1966.
* The third series (I/Ia BBk) was introduced in 1960 by the Bundesbank, depicting neutral symbols, paintings by the German painters, and buildings. There were denominations of DM 5, DM 10, DM 20, DM 50, DM 100, DM 500 and DM 1,000. The series ceased to be legal tender on 30 June 1995.
* The fourth (BBk III/III a) was introduced in 1990 by the Bundesbank to counter advances in forgery technology. The notes depicted German artists and scientists together with symbols and tools of their trade. This series added a DM200 denomination, to decrease the use of DM 100 banknotes, which made up 54% of all circulating banknotes, and to fill the gap between the DM 100 and DM 500 denominations. In 1997–1998, new versions of DM 50, DM 100 and DM 200 were issued with improved security elements.

The notes with a value greater than DM 200 were rarely seen. A reserve series (BBk II) was commissioned on 1 July 1960, consisting of DM 10, DM 20, DM 50 and DM 100 banknotes. 670 million BBk II banknotes in value of 25 billion marks were printed. The notes were printed between 1963 and 1974 in fear if the Eastern Bloc would start systematically counterfeiting the BBk I series of banknotes to cripple the economy, then they would quickly be replaced by emergency notes. Another reserve series for West Berlin (BBk IIa) was commissioned on 1 July 1963, consisting of DM 5, DM 10, DM 20, DM 50 and DM 100 banknotes. 115 million West Berlin banknotes were printed, total value 4 billion marks. 15 billion marks worth of the banknotes were held in Bundesbank&#x27;s custom-built underground bunker in Cochem in Rheinland-Pfalz, the rest was stored in Bundesbank&#x27;s vault in Frankfurt.

===Banknotes of the third series (BBk I/Ia)===
In 1957, with Bank deutscher Länder and the states&#x27; central banks merging to form the Bundesbank, new banknotes were being designed, as &quot;Bank deutscher Länder&quot; on the previous series was no longer correct. The previous series&#x27; notes had been made out of less durable paper and had a rather short life. While previously damaged notes could be replaced from reserve stocks, this stock was also coming to an end, necessitating a reprint.

Typical security features at the time were guilloches, a multi-level head watermark and a security thread. Note numbers that fluoresced under UV light and green, yellow, and blue. 27 fluorescent fibers embedded in the paper appeared on most banknotes; however, some specimens without these features were in circulation. Starting in 1976, banknotes were equipped with machine-readable feature - a colorless inorganic oxide mixture applied to the security thread. Banknotes featuring that were designated BBk Ia within the Bundesbank. All banknotes of the third series bore the penalty for counterfeiting and forgery on the upper right corner of the reverse, from German penal code section 146: &quot;Wer Banknoten nachmacht oder verfälscht, oder nachgemachte oder verfälschte sich verschafft und in Verkehr bringt, wird mit Zuchthaus/Freiheitsstrafe nicht unter zwei Jahren bestraft.&quot; (&quot;Who falsifies or counterfeits banknotes, or procures falsified or counterfeit banknotes and releases them into circulation, is liable to imprisonment for at least two years&quot;.

The third series banknotes entered circulation on 10 February 1961, with the DM 20 note. DM 100 and DM 50 followed next year, and DM 5 and DM 10 in 1963. High-denomination DM 1000 and DM 500 followed in 1964 and 1965, respectively.

The banknotes were printed exclusively in West Germany; in Bundesdruckerei in West Berlin and in Giesecke+Devrient in Munich. The third series banknotes ceased to be legal tender on 30 June 1995, when the fourth series notes had been in circulation for 3–5 years. There were a total of five issues of the third series, main differences being the dates, and signatures of the Presidents and Vice Presidents of Bundesbank:

===Banknotes of the fourth series===
The design of German banknotes remained unchanged during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. During this period, forgery technology made significant advances and so, in the late 1980s, the Bundesbank decided to issue a new series of Deutsche Mark banknotes. The colours for each denomination remained unchanged from the previous series but the designs underwent significant changes and a DM 200 denomination was introduced. Famous national artists and scientists were chosen to be portrayed on the new banknotes. Male and female artists were chosen in equal numbers. The buildings in the background of the notes&#x27; obverses had a close relationship to the person displayed (e.g., place of birth, place of death, place of work), as well as the second background picture (Lyra and the musician Schumann). The reverses of the notes refer to the work of the person on the obverse.

The new security features were: a windowed security thread (with the notes&#x27; denominations in microprinting), watermarks, microprinting, intaglio printing (viewing-angle dependent visibility as well as a Braille representation of the notes denomination), colour-shifting ink (on the DM 500 and DM 1000 denominations), a see-through registration device and ultraviolet-visible security features.

First to be issued were the DM 100 and DM 200 denominations on 1 October 1990 (although the banknote shows &quot;Frankfurt am Main, 2. Januar 1989&quot;). The next denomination was DM 10 on 16 April 1991, followed by DM 50 on 30 September 1991. Next was the DM 20 note on 20 March 1992 (printed on 2 August 1991). The reason for this gradual introduction was, that public should become familiar with one single denomination, before introducing a new one. The change was finished with the introduction of the DM 5, DM 500, and DM 1000 denominations on 27 October 1992. The DM 500, and DM 1000 denominations were rarely seen in circulation due to value and all were introduced in one step. With the advance of forgery technology, the Bundesbank decided to introduce additional security features on the most important denominations (DM 50, DM 100 and DM 200) as of 1996. These were a hologram foil in the center of the note&#x27;s obverse, a matted printing on the note&#x27;s right obverse, showing its denomination (like on the reverse of the new euro banknotes), and the EURion constellation on the note&#x27;s reverse. Furthermore, the colours were changed slightly to hamper counterfeiting.

==Spelling and pronunciation==
The German name of the currency is &quot;Deutsche Mark&quot; (, ); its plural form in standard German is the same as the singular. In German, the adjective &quot;deutsche&quot; (adjective for &quot;German&quot; in feminine singular nominative form) is capitalized because it is part of a proper name, while the noun &quot;Mark&quot;, like all German nouns, is always capitalized. The English loanword &quot;Deutschmark&quot; has a slightly different spelling and one syllable fewer (possibly due to the frequency of silent e in English, or due to English&#x27;s lack of adjectival endings), and a plural form in &quot;-s&quot;.

In Germany and other German speaking countries, the currency&#x27;s name was often abbreviated as &quot;D-Mark&quot; (, ) or simply &quot;Mark&quot; () with the latter term also often used in English. Like &quot;Deutsche Mark&quot;, &quot;D-Mark&quot; and &quot;Mark&quot; do not take the plural in German when used with numbers (like all names of units), the singular being used to refer to any amount of money (e.g. &quot;eine (one) Mark&quot; and &quot;dreißig (thirty) Mark&quot;). Sometimes, a very colloquial plural form of &quot;Mark&quot;, &quot;Märker&quot; was used either as hypocoristic form or to refer to a small number of D-Mark coins or bills, e.g. &quot;Gib mir mal ein paar Märker&quot; (&quot;Just give me a few marks&quot;) and &quot;Die lieben Märker wieder&quot; (&quot;The lovely money again&quot;, with an ironic undertone).

The subdivision unit is spelled &quot;Pfennig&quot; (; ), which unlike &quot;Mark&quot; does have a commonly used plural form: &quot;Pfennige&quot; (), but the singular could also be used instead with no difference in meaning. (e.g.: &quot;ein (one) Pfennig&quot;, &quot;dreißig (thirty) Pfennige&quot; or &quot;dreißig (thirty) Pfennig&quot;). The official form is singular.

<text>Andy Müller-Maguhn (born 3 October 1971) is a member of the German hacker association Chaos Computer Club (CCC). Having been a member since 1986, he was appointed as a spokesman for the club in 1990, and later served on its board until 2012. He runs a company that develops cryptophones.

In an election in Autumn 2000, he was voted in as an at-large director of ICANN, which made him jointly responsible with 18 other directors for the worldwide development of guidelines and the decision of structural questions for the Internet structure.

In 1995, Müller-Maguhn founded the &quot;Datenreisebüro&quot; (&#x27;Data Travel Agency&#x27;), based in a Berlin office since 2002.

In 2005 and 2006, Müller-Maguhn was involved on the side of the parents of the deceased hacker Boris Floricic, better known as Tron, in the case where they sought to prevent German Wikipedia from disclosing his true name, although the name had appeared in many press accounts by that point in time.

As of 2018, Müller-Maguhn runs a data center, does advocacy, and security consulting for companies and governments. His work has taken him around the world, including Moscow, where he attended a security conference organized by the Russian Ministry of Defence in 2016 and 2017, London and Brazil.

== Relationship with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks ==
In 2011, Müller-Maguhn was criticized for his role in the CCC board&#x27;s controversial decision to expel former WikiLeaks spokesman Daniel Domscheit-Berg, which was often attributed to Müller-Maguhn&#x27;s close relation to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and an ongoing conflict between Assange and Domscheit-Berg. At a general meeting in February 2012, this decision was reverted, while Müller-Maguhn was not reelected to the board.

In 2011, Müller-Maguhn&#x27;s company Bugged Planet worked with WikiLeaks on the Spy Files release. Forbes suggested that Müller-Maguhn and Bugged Planet might be WikiLeaks&#x27; source for the Spy Files.

The Mueller Report inferred that Müller-Maguhn may have assisted with transferring the DNC emails or the Podesta emails to WikiLeaks. In 2016, he delivered a USB to Assange, which he said contained personal messages for Assange, who had stopped using email. In July 2016, on the same day &quot;Guccifer 2.0&quot; sent Wikileaks encrypted files, Müller-Maguhn and Wau Holland board member Bernd Fix met with Assange for over four hours. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, a former WikiLeaks associate said that, in 2016, Müller-Maguhn and a colleague oversaw submissions to WikiLeaks server. Müller-Maguhn said he did not oversee submissions.

Müller-Maguhn was an alleged target of UC Global&#x27;s surveillance of Julian Assange in the embassy.

Müller-Maguhn is vice president for the Wau Holland Foundation and a member of the Advisory Board for the Courage Foundation.

He appeared with Julian Assange on Episode 8 and 9 of &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Cypherpunks: 1/2&quot;.

He is a contributor to Julian Assange&#x27;s 2012 book &quot;Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet&quot; along with Jacob Appelbaum and Jérémie Zimmermann.
