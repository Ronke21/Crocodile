<text>Guy Stuart Ritchie (born 10 September 1968) is an English film director, producer and screenwriter. His work includes British gangster films and the Sherlock Holmes films starring Robert Downey Jr.

Ritchie left school at the age of 15, and worked in entry-level jobs in the film industry before going on to direct television commercials. In 1995, he directed a short film, &quot;The Hard Case&quot;, followed by the crime comedy &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; (1998), his feature-length directorial debut. He gained recognition with his second film, &quot;Snatch&quot; (2000), which found critical and commercial success. Following &quot;Snatch&quot;, Ritchie directed &quot;Swept Away&quot; (2002), a critically panned box-office bomb starring Madonna, to whom Ritchie was married between 2000 and 2008. He went on to direct &quot;Revolver&quot; (2005) and &quot;RocknRolla&quot; (2008), which were less successful and received mixed reviews. In 2009 and 2011, he directed the box-office hits &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot;. The former was nominated for Academy Awards in Best Original Score and Best Art Direction.

His other directed films include &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (2015), based on the 1960s television series, &quot;King Arthur: Legend of the Sword&quot; (2017), and &quot;Aladdin&quot; (2019), Disney&#x27;s live-action adaptation of their 1992 animated film, which grossed over $1 billion worldwide, becoming one of the highest-grossing films in 2019 and the highest-grossing film of Ritchie&#x27;s career. In 2019, he returned to crime comedy with &quot;The Gentlemen&quot; (2019), which was mostly well received and a commercial success. He subsequently reteamed with Jason Statham on the action films &quot;Wrath of Man&quot; (2021) and &quot;Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre&quot; (2023). His second film of 2023, &quot;The Covenant&quot;, received generally positive reviews.

==Life and career==

=== 1968–1997: Early life and career beginnings ===
Ritchie was born in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, the second of two children of Amber (&quot;&quot; Parkinson) and Captain John Vivian Ritchie (b. 1928), former Seaforth Highlanders officer and advertising executive. He has an elder sister, and a half-brother who was born to Amber Parkinson and placed for adoption.

Both of Ritchie&#x27;s parents remarried. His father&#x27;s second marriage was to Shireen Ritchie, Baroness Ritchie of Brompton, a former model and later Conservative politician and life peer. Between 1973 and 1980, Ritchie&#x27;s mother was married to Sir Michael Leighton, 11th Baronet of Loton Park. As a divorcée, she is styled as Amber, Lady Leighton.

Ritchie is dyslexic, and attended Windlesham House School in West Sussex and Stanbridge Earls School in Hampshire. He was expelled from school at the age of 15. He has claimed that drug use was the reason for expulsion, although Ritchie&#x27;s father said he was &quot;cutting class and entertaining a girl in his room&quot;.

=== 1998–2002: Breakthrough ===
After working on a short film, &quot;The Hard Case&quot; (1995), in 1998, Ritchie met Matthew Vaughn, who had been working in Los Angeles and expressed interest in producing Ritchie&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; (1998). It took 15 months to secure financial backing. Trudie Styler served as an executive producer—she said &quot;I&#x27;ve always liked bad-boy movies&quot;.

The production of comedy heist film &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; was completed in about eight months. Starring Nick Moran, Jason Statham, Jason Flemyng and Dexter Fletcher, the film exposed them to worldwide audiences, and launched the acting career of former footballer Vinnie Jones. It was released in the United Kingdom on 28 August 1998 to critical and commercial success, with Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praising Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;brash, ebullient direction&quot; and &quot;punchy little flourishes that load this English gangster film&quot;. The feature earned $28.1 million at the worldwide box office. At the 1999 British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs), &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; was nominated for three awards: Outstanding British Film, Best Editing and Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer for Vaughn. The film won a BAFTA for Film of the Year. In response to the film&#x27;s success, Ritchie created a spin-off television series called &quot;Lock, Stock...&quot;. in 2000.

Ritchie&#x27;s next film was &quot;Snatch&quot; (2000), another crime-comedy about a group of criminals searching for a stolen diamond. Starring an ensemble cast including Benicio del Toro, Dennis Farina, Flemyng, Jones, Brad Pitt, Rade Šerbedžija and Statham. Similar to &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot;, the film depicted events from different characters&#x27; perspectives; a narrative device which he would use in later films. &quot;Snatch&quot; was released on 23 August 2000 to a commercial success at the box office, grossing more than $83 million worldwide. Mick LaSalle, writing for &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, was impressed with Ritchie&#x27;s directing and &quot;sequences that discharge with energy&quot;, but felt the writing could have been better. Film critic Roger Ebert describes Ritchie as a &quot;zany, high-energy director&quot; but felt the film&#x27;s plot &quot;doesn&#x27;t build and it doesn&#x27;t arrive anywhere&quot;.

In 2001, Ritchie directed a music video for &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot;, a song performed by Madonna, to whom Ritchie was married at the time. In the video, she commits criminal and violent acts towards men; music channels MTV and VH1 banned the video from their rotation, opting to play it only once on the release date. Ritchie directed a short film starring Madonna and Clive Owen, titled &quot;Star&quot; for season one of &quot;The Hire&quot;, a 2001 online series to promote BMW automobiles. Ritchie&#x27;s next film, starring Madonna and Adriano Giannini, was &quot;Swept Away&quot; (2002), a remake of Lina Wertmüller&#x27;s 1974 Italian film of the same name. It is a romantic comedy about a wealthy socialite who is shipwrecked on a deserted island with a Communist sailor. The film was a critical and commercial failure, with an average rating of 5% on film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Almar Haflidason of the BBC was critical of the lead actors, writing, &quot;[Madonna] has neither good comedic sense nor any warmth [...] as for Giannini, he spends the first half of the movie endlessly complaining like some old fishwife&quot;. The feature won five awards at the 2002 Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Picture, Worst Actress, Worst Screen Couple, Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Director.

In 2002, Ritchie conceived a prank show titled &quot;Swag&quot;, for Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.

=== 2003–2015: Critical disappointments and &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; ===

Ritchie&#x27;s next heist film &quot;Revolver&quot; (2005) starred Statham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore, and André Benjamin. The story is about gambler Jake Green (Statham) who is released from prison and seeks revenge on those who stole his money. Filming was completed in late 2004 and the film premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. &quot;Revolver&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on 22 September 2005, but it was critically panned and a commercial failure. Simon Guerrier of &quot;FilmFocus&quot; gave it one out of five stars, calling it, &quot;tedious, humourless, pretentious and nasty&quot;. Adrian Hennigan from the BBC wrote, &quot;the cheeky charm has been replaced by plodding pretentiousness in a film that&#x27;s illuminated by great action set-pieces and some powerful performances, but not redeemed&quot;. Ritchie responded to the criticism by stating, &quot;I don&#x27;t think anything went wrong with &quot;Revolver&quot;. By its very nature it&#x27;s an esoteric movie. It&#x27;s not designed for the masses&quot;. The film was budgeted at $27 million but earned $7.1 million at the worldwide box office. In 2007, &quot;Revolver&quot; was re-edited and released for the United States.

In 2008, Ritchie directed &quot;RocknRolla&quot;, for which he also wrote the screenplay. It stars Gerard Butler, Tom Wilkinson, Thandie Newton, Mark Strong, Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, and Toby Kebbell. &quot;RocknRolla&quot; was released on 5 September 2008 in the United Kingdom, reaching number one at the UK box office in its first week of release. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 60% rating, stating, &quot;Mixed reviews for Guy Ritchie&#x27;s return to his London-based cockney wideboy gangster movie roots, but most agree, it&#x27;s a step in the right direction following two major turkeys&quot;. In that same year, Ritchie directed a television commercial for Nike called &quot;Take It To The Next Level&quot;. The commercial includes appearances from Cristiano Ronaldo, Cesc Fàbregas, Ronaldinho, Wayne Rooney, and Ruud van Nistelrooy.

Ritchie&#x27;s next directorial effort was &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2009), starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. The film was released on 25 and 26 December 2009 in the United States and United Kingdom. It was a box-office hit, taking more than $520 million worldwide, and garnered mixed to favourable reviews from critics and general viewers. It received multiple accolades, including two Academy Award nominations for Best Original Score and Best Art Direction, and Downey won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. In 2011, Ritchie directed the sequel &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot;. It was released on 16 December and was an even greater commercial success, grossing more than $545 million worldwide. A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Ritchie for &quot;taking liberties&quot; with the characters, and wrote that both films depict &quot;a smoky, overcast Victorian world, infuses it with an air of jocular, hairy laddishness and stages a lot of fights in fussy and tiresome slow motion&quot;.

In 2012, Ritchie produced a trailer for the video game &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops II&quot;. In 2013, he directed a commercial for H&amp;M featuring David Beckham. A year later, he directed a commercial for whisky brand Haig, which also stars Beckham. He made a return to film in 2015 with &quot;The Man From U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, a remake of the 1960s spy series. Ritchie and Lionel Wigram wrote the screenplay about a CIA agent and a KGB agent who work together to stop a criminal organisation from constructing a nuclear weapon. Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer played the lead roles. Principal photography commenced in 2013 in London and Italy, with rewrites to the script during filming. It was released on 14 August 2015 by Warner Bros. to a mixed critical reception. Glenn Kenny on&quot;RogerEbert.com&quot; writes that it &quot;is only intermittently engaging and amusing, and those portions of the movie that succeed are also frustrating.&quot; However, he praised Hugh Grant&#x27;s performance which &quot;saves the movie&quot;.

=== 2016–present: &quot;Aladdin&quot; and return to crime films ===
In January 2014, Warner Bros. hired Ritchie to direct the first of six films in a franchise, fantasy adventure &quot;King Arthur: Legend of the Sword&quot; (2017) with Charlie Hunnam portraying King Arthur. The feature was released in 2D and 3D on 12 May 2017 in the United States, and a week later in the United Kingdom. Despite high expectations from the studio, it received mixed reviews and was a box-office failure, causing large financial losses for Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow Pictures, and leading to the cancellation of the subsequent sequels.

In August 2017, Ritchie received the Raindance Auteur Award for his contributions to the British film industry. Next, Ritchie directed Disney&#x27;s live-action adaptation of &quot;Aladdin&quot; (2019), based on the 1992 animated film of the same name. The plot follows Aladdin, a street urchin, as he falls in love with Princess Jasmine, befriends a Genie, and battles the wicked Jafar. Released on 24 May 2019 in the United States, the film was a commercial success despite mixed reviews; &quot;Aladdin&quot; earned more than $1 billion worldwide, becoming one of the highest-grossing films in 2019, and the 34th highest-grossing film of all-time during its theatrical run. Writing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Richard Roeper gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, praising Will Smith, Naomi Scott, and Mena Massoud&#x27;s performances. On Metacritic, &quot;Aladdin&quot; has a weighted average score of 53 out of 100 based on 50 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;, and on Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 57% based on 372 reviews with an average rating of 5.88/10.

In 2020, Ritchie returned to crime comedy with &quot;The Gentlemen&quot;. The story is about an American expat who tries to sell his marijuana business, which triggers a chain reaction response from various criminals. Released on 1 January in the United Kingdom, and a few weeks later in other countries, the film was generally well received. Anton Bitel of &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; wrote that it &quot;returns to the sense and sensibilities of his earliest features&quot;. Film critic James Berardinelli gave the film out of four stars, writing, &quot;&quot;The Gentlemen&quot; takes Ritchie back to his roots&quot; although &quot;the screenplay is too clever by half, with some of the quirkiness being awkward and intrusive.&quot; On Rotten Tomatoes, the film gained an approval rating of 74% based on 260 reviews, and earned $115 million worldwide. In October 2020, it was announced that Ritchie was developing a spin-off television series, which was eventually acquired by Netflix; the series was released on Netflix on 7 March 2024.

Ritchie next directed the action thriller &quot;Wrath of Man&quot;, a remake of the 2004 film &quot;Cash Truck&quot;, reuniting with Statham. It was released in the United States on 7 May 2021. It was initially set for theatrical release in the United Kingdom by Lionsgate UK, but was instead released straight to streaming on Amazon Prime Video on 10 December 2021.

Ritchie followed up &quot;Wrath of Man&quot; with the spy thriller &quot;Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre&quot;, again starring Statham. It was scheduled for release in cinemas on 18 March 2022, but was pulled from the schedule a month prior without an explanation; it was eventually released in the United States on 3 March 2023, by Lionsgate. Ritchie next filmed the war drama &quot;The Covenant&quot;, starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Dar Salim, Antony Starr and Emily Beecham, in February 2022 in Alicante, Spain. The film was released in the United States on 21 April 2023. In June 2022, it was announced that Ritchie had signed on to direct a live-action film adaptation of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Hercules&quot;.

In February 2021, Ritchie agreed to direct and write the World War II film &quot;The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare&quot;, based on the book by Damien Lewis, for producer Jerry Bruckheimer and Paramount Pictures. In October 2022, Henry Cavill and Eiza González were cast in the lead roles, with Paramount no longer involved. The film was released in theatres in the United States on 19 April 2024 by Lionsgate. 

In May 2023, a few weeks after production wrapped on &quot;The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare&quot;, it was announced Ritchie would next direct the film &quot;In the Grey&quot; (untitled at the time), starring Cavill, Gyllenhaal and González, set to shoot in Spain in the summer of 2023. The film concluded production in October 2023, with Lionsgate acquiring domestic distribution rights and Black Bear UK releasing in the United Kingdom. The film was set to be released in theatres in the United States on 17 January 2025, but was removed from the release schedule in November 2024 as post-production was not yet finished.

On 6 July 2023, it was announced Ritchie would executive produce the ESPN documentary series &quot;Gracie&quot;, to be directed by Chris Fuller.

On 11 January 2024, it was announced Ritchie would direct the action adventure film &quot;Fountain of Youth&quot;, for Skydance Media and Apple Studios, with Natalie Portman, John Krasinski and Domhnall Gleeson set to star and production began in February 2024.

On 28 February 2024, it was announced that Ritchie would serve as director and executive producer alongside &quot;Top Boy&quot; creator Ronan Bennett on the &quot;Ray Donovan&quot; spin-off series &quot;The Donovans&quot; for the streaming service Paramount+. By October 9, the project had been retitled &quot;The Associates&quot; and had been reworked into a standalone series, with Tom Hardy, Helen Mirren, and Pierce Brosnan in final negotiations to star in the project. On 13 May, it was announced Ritchie would write and direct the film &quot;Wife and Dog&quot;; in November, it was announced the project would star Benedict Cumberbatch, Rosamund Pike, and Anthony Hopkins, with production expected to begin in February 2025.

On 29 May 2024, it was announced that Ritchie would serve as executive producer and director on the Amazon Prime Video television series &quot;Young Sherlock&quot;, based on the &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot; series of young adult novels by Andy Lane.

== Filmmaking ==
=== Influences and style ===
Ritchie has cited Quentin Tarantino and Sergio Leone as influences on his work. However, he has stated &quot;just about every film — any good film — that&#x27;s ever been made has had an influence on me. But then how much of it, I have no idea&quot;. He has complimented several films including &quot;The Long Good Friday&quot; (1980), &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&quot; (1966), &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954) and &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; (1968). When asked about the influence of criminals Ronald and Reginald Kray, Ritchie states &quot;It&#x27;s inevitable ... everything, more or less, of the old-school villainy related back to the Krays at some point. And the Krays were a lot worse than everyone thinks they are. ... And I know what those boys were doing was a hundred times worse than what everyone thought was going on. So it&#x27;s inevitable that anything that is genuine, and old, and British will somehow have something to do with the Krays&quot;.

Ritchie&#x27;s films often incorporate memorable and &quot;colourful&quot; characters, for instance, Irish boxer Mickey O&#x27;Neil in &quot;Snatch&quot;, and crime boss &quot;Hatchet&quot; Harry in &quot;Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.&quot; In his crime films, there is also fragmented dialogue, with many characters behaving menacingly and using cockney slang. The portrayal of the British class system has also been explored. Costume designer for &quot;The Gentlemen&quot;, Michael Wilkinson, said &quot;Each character has an iconic, memorable look — a little larger than life&quot;.

Fast-paced and energetic action scenes serve as cinematic choices, as well as placing his characters in combat or violent situations. Ritchie has used fast-cutting and slow motion to build momentum in the story, and to create a high-impact viewing experience, respectively. He is also known to use interweaving stories and a non-linear narrative such as a circular plot in his films; this is found in the case of &quot;Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,&quot; &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; and &quot;Snatch&quot;.

Ritchie has said this on his creative process:

Ritchie has worked multiple times with Vinnie Jones, Jason Statham, Jason Flemyng, Alan Ford, Geoff Bell, Mark Strong, Jude Law, Eddie Marsan, Jared Harris, Charlie Hunnam, Josh Hartnett, Hugh Grant, Jake Gyllenhaal, Eiza González, Henry Golding, Cary Elwes, Bugzy Malone and Henry Cavill.

==Personal life==
Ritchie started training in Shotokan karate at age seven at the Budokwai in London, where he later achieved a black belt in both Shotokan and Judo. He also has a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Renzo Gracie.

Ritchie says that he can speak Hebrew.

On 18 May 2000, Ritchie was arrested by police for allegedly assaulting a man outside the Kensington home that he shared with American singer-songwriter Madonna. On 22 December 2000, he married Madonna at Skibo Castle in Scotland. They had son Rocco, born in 2000, and adopted a Malawian baby, David Banda, in 2006.

Madonna filed for divorce in October 2008, citing irreconcilable differences. On 15 December 2008, Madonna announced that she had agreed to a divorce settlement with Ritchie, the terms of which granted him £50–60 million, which includes the value of the couple&#x27;s London pub and Wiltshire estate. The couple issued a joint statement calling settlement reports &quot;misleading and inaccurate&quot;. At the Central Family Court in Holborn, district judge Caroline Reid pronounced the &quot;decree nisi,&quot; which dissolved the marriage within six weeks. Madonna and Ritchie reached a custody agreement for their children.

In February 2011, his London home was briefly occupied by members of the Really Free School, a squatter organisation.

In 2010, Ritchie met English model Jacqui Ainsley. They married on 30 July 2015. The couple have three children.

In July 2020, Ritchie received a six-month driving ban after he was caught by CyclingMikey using a mobile device while operating a motor vehicle.

==Other business ventures==
Ritchie owns a pub, &quot;The Lore of the Land&quot;, in London, and previously co-owned another, &quot;The Walmer Castle&quot; with David Beckham until 2022 when it was taken over by Piers Adams, a French entrepreneur. Ritchie owns a small brewing company, Gritchie Brewing Company which brews beer on his Ashcombe Estate in Wiltshire. He also owns The Wild Kitchen, a firm producing outdoor cooking equipment and tents, which launched at Chelsea Flower Show in 2021.

In October 2022 it was announced that Compton Abbas Airfield was being sold to Ritchie, who owns the neighbouring Ashcombe Estate. Ritchie took over running of the airfield in February 2023.

Ritchie became a comic writer from 2007 to 2008 with the release of the Virgin Comics series &quot;Guy Ritchie&#x27;s Gamekeeper&quot;.

<text>In geometry, a geodesic () is a curve representing in some sense the locally shortest path (arc) between two points in a surface, or more generally in a Riemannian manifold. The term also has meaning in any differentiable manifold with a connection. It is a generalization of the notion of a &quot;straight line&quot;.

The noun &quot;&quot; and the adjective &quot;&quot; come from &quot;geodesy&quot;, the science of measuring the size and shape of Earth, though many of the underlying principles can be applied to any ellipsoidal geometry. In the original sense, a geodesic was the shortest route between two points on the Earth&#x27;s surface. For a spherical Earth, it is a segment of a great circle (see also great-circle distance). The term has since been generalized to more abstract mathematical spaces; for example, in graph theory, one might consider a geodesic between two vertices/nodes of a graph.

In a Riemannian manifold or submanifold, geodesics are characterised by the property of having vanishing geodesic curvature. More generally, in the presence of an affine connection, a geodesic is defined to be a curve whose tangent vectors remain parallel if they are transported along it. Applying this to the Levi-Civita connection of a Riemannian metric recovers the previous notion.

Geodesics are of particular importance in general relativity. Timelike geodesics in general relativity describe the motion of free falling test particles.

==Introduction==
A locally shortest path between two given points in a curved space, assumed to be a Riemannian manifold, can be defined by using the equation for the length of a curve (a function &quot;f&quot; from an open interval of R to the space), and then minimizing this length between the points using the calculus of variations. This has some minor technical problems because there is an infinite-dimensional space of different ways to parameterize the shortest path. It is simpler to restrict the set of curves to those that are parameterized &quot;with constant speed&quot; 1, meaning that the distance from &quot;f&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) to &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) along the curve equals |&quot;s&quot;−&quot;t&quot;|. Equivalently, a different quantity may be used, termed the energy of the curve; minimizing the energy leads to the same equations for a geodesic (here &quot;constant velocity&quot; is a consequence of minimization). Intuitively, one can understand this second formulation by noting that an elastic band stretched between two points will contract its width, and in so doing will minimize its energy. The resulting shape of the band is a geodesic.

It is possible that several different curves between two points minimize the distance, as is the case for two diametrically opposite points on a sphere. In such a case, any of these curves is a geodesic.

A contiguous segment of a geodesic is again a geodesic.

In general, geodesics are not the same as &quot;shortest curves&quot; between two points, though the two concepts are closely related. The difference is that geodesics are only &quot;locally&quot; the shortest distance between points, and are parameterized with &quot;constant speed&quot;. Going the &quot;long way round&quot; on a great circle between two points on a sphere is a geodesic but not the shortest path between the points. The map formula_1 from the unit interval on the real number line to itself gives the shortest path between 0 and 1, but is not a geodesic because the velocity of the corresponding motion of a point is not constant.

Geodesics are commonly seen in the study of Riemannian geometry and more generally metric geometry. In general relativity, geodesics in spacetime describe the motion of point particles under the influence of gravity alone. In particular, the path taken by a falling rock, an orbiting satellite, or the shape of a planetary orbit are all geodesics in curved spacetime. More generally, the topic of sub-Riemannian geometry deals with the paths that objects may take when they are not free, and their movement is constrained in various ways.

This article presents the mathematical formalism involved in defining, finding, and proving the existence of geodesics, in the case of Riemannian manifolds. The article Levi-Civita connection discusses the more general case of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold and geodesic (general relativity) discusses the special case of general relativity in greater detail.

===Examples===
The most familiar examples are the straight lines in Euclidean geometry. On a sphere, the images of geodesics are the great circles. The shortest path from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot; on a sphere is given by the shorter arc of the great circle passing through &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are antipodal points, then there are &quot;infinitely many&quot; shortest paths between them. Geodesics on an ellipsoid behave in a more complicated way than on a sphere; in particular, they are not closed in general (see figure).

===Triangles===
A geodesic triangle is formed by the geodesics joining each pair out of three points on a given surface. On the sphere, the geodesics are great circle arcs, forming a spherical triangle.
==Metric geometry==
In metric geometry, a geodesic is a curve which is everywhere locally a distance minimizer. More precisely, a curve from an interval &quot;I&quot; of the reals to the metric space &quot;M&quot; is a geodesic if there is a constant such that for any there is a neighborhood &quot;J&quot; of &quot;t&quot; in &quot;I&quot; such that for any we have

:formula_2

This generalizes the notion of geodesic for Riemannian manifolds. However, in metric geometry the geodesic considered is often equipped with natural parameterization, i.e. in the above identity &quot;v&quot; = 1 and

:formula_3

If the last equality is satisfied for all , the geodesic is called a minimizing geodesic or shortest path.

In general, a metric space may have no geodesics, except constant curves. At the other extreme, any two points in a length metric space are joined by a minimizing sequence of rectifiable paths, although this minimizing sequence need not converge to a geodesic. The metric Hopf-Rinow theorem provides situations where a length space is automatically a geodesic space.

Common examples of geodesic metric spaces that are often not manifolds include metric graphs, (locally compact) metric polyhedral complexes, infinite-dimensional pre-Hilbert spaces, and real trees.

==Riemannian geometry==
In a Riemannian manifold formula_4 with metric tensor formula_5, the length formula_6 of a continuously differentiable curve formula_7 is defined by
:formula_8
The distance formula_9 between two points formula_10 and formula_11 of formula_4 is defined as the infimum of the length taken over all continuous, piecewise continuously differentiable curves formula_13 such that formula_14 and formula_15. In Riemannian geometry, all geodesics are locally distance-minimizing paths, but the converse is not true. In fact, only paths that are both locally distance minimizing and parameterized proportionately to arc-length are geodesics. 

Another equivalent way of defining geodesics on a Riemannian manifold, is to define them as the minima of the following action or energy functional
:formula_16
All minima of formula_17 are also minima of formula_6, but formula_6 is a bigger set since paths that are minima of formula_6 can be arbitrarily re-parameterized (without changing their length), while minima of formula_17 cannot.
For a piecewise formula_22 curve (more generally, a formula_23 curve), the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality gives
:formula_24
with equality if and only if formula_25 is equal to a constant a.e.; the path should be travelled at constant speed. It happens that minimizers of formula_26 also minimize formula_27, because they turn out to be affinely parameterized, and the inequality is an equality. The usefulness of this approach is that the problem of seeking minimizers of formula_17 is a more robust variational problem. Indeed, formula_26 is a &quot;convex function&quot; of formula_30, so that within each isotopy class of &quot;reasonable functions&quot;, one ought to expect existence, uniqueness, and regularity of minimizers. In contrast, &quot;minimizers&quot; of the functional formula_27 are generally not very regular, because arbitrary reparameterizations are allowed.

The Euler–Lagrange equations of motion for the functional formula_17 are then given in local coordinates by
:formula_33
where formula_34 are the Christoffel symbols of the metric. This is the geodesic equation, discussed below.

===Calculus of variations===

Techniques of the classical calculus of variations can be applied to examine the energy functional formula_17. The first variation of energy is defined in local coordinates by

:formula_36

The critical points of the first variation are precisely the geodesics. The second variation is defined by

:formula_37

In an appropriate sense, zeros of the second variation along a geodesic formula_30 arise along Jacobi fields. Jacobi fields are thus regarded as variations through geodesics.

By applying variational techniques from classical mechanics, one can also regard geodesics as Hamiltonian flows. They are solutions of the associated Hamilton equations, with (pseudo-)Riemannian metric taken as Hamiltonian.

==Affine geodesics==

A geodesic on a smooth manifold formula_4 with an affine connection formula_40 is defined as a curve formula_41 such that parallel transport along the curve preserves the tangent vector to the curve, so

at each point along the curve, where formula_42 is the derivative with respect to formula_43. More precisely, in order to define the covariant derivative of formula_42 it is necessary first to extend formula_42 to a continuously differentiable vector field in an open set. However, the resulting value of () is independent of the choice of extension.

Using local coordinates on formula_4, we can write the geodesic equation (using the summation convention) as
:formula_47
where formula_48 are the coordinates of the curve formula_41 and formula_50 are the Christoffel symbols of the connection formula_40. This is an ordinary differential equation for the coordinates. It has a unique solution, given an initial position and an initial velocity. Therefore, from the point of view of classical mechanics, geodesics can be thought of as trajectories of free particles in a manifold. Indeed, the equation formula_52 means that the acceleration vector of the curve has no components in the direction of the surface (and therefore it is perpendicular to the tangent plane of the surface at each point of the curve). So, the motion is completely determined by the bending of the surface. This is also the idea of general relativity where particles move on geodesics and the bending is caused by gravity.

===Existence and uniqueness===
The &quot;local existence and uniqueness theorem&quot; for geodesics states that geodesics on a smooth manifold with an affine connection exist, and are unique. More precisely:

:For any point &quot;p&quot; in &quot;M&quot; and for any vector &quot;V&quot; in &quot;TpM&quot; (the tangent space to &quot;M&quot; at &quot;p&quot;) there exists a unique geodesic formula_53 : &quot;I&quot; → &quot;M&quot; such that
::formula_54 and
::formula_55
:where &quot;I&quot; is a maximal open interval in R containing 0.

The proof of this theorem follows from the theory of ordinary differential equations, by noticing that the geodesic equation is a second-order ODE. Existence and uniqueness then follow from the Picard–Lindelöf theorem for the solutions of ODEs with prescribed initial conditions. γ depends smoothly on both &quot;p&quot; and &quot;V&quot;.

In general, &quot;I&quot; may not be all of R as for example for an open disc in R2. Any extends to all of if and only if is geodesically complete.

===Geodesic flow===
Geodesic flow is a local R-action on the tangent bundle &quot;TM&quot; of a manifold &quot;M&quot; defined in the following way

:formula_56

where &quot;t&quot; ∈ R, &quot;V&quot; ∈ &quot;TM&quot; and formula_57 denotes the geodesic with initial data formula_58. Thus, &quot;formula_59 is the exponential map of the vector &quot;tV&quot;. A closed orbit of the geodesic flow corresponds to a closed geodesic on &quot;M&quot;.

On a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, the geodesic flow is identified with a Hamiltonian flow on the cotangent bundle. The Hamiltonian is then given by the inverse of the (pseudo-)Riemannian metric, evaluated against the canonical one-form. In particular the flow preserves the (pseudo-)Riemannian metric formula_5, i.e.

: formula_61

In particular, when &quot;V&quot; is a unit vector, formula_57 remains unit speed throughout, so the geodesic flow is tangent to the unit tangent bundle. Liouville&#x27;s theorem implies invariance of a kinematic measure on the unit tangent bundle.

===Geodesic spray===

The geodesic flow defines a family of curves in the tangent bundle. The derivatives of these curves define a vector field on the total space of the tangent bundle, known as the geodesic spray.

More precisely, an affine connection gives rise to a splitting of the double tangent bundle TT&quot;M&quot; into horizontal and vertical bundles:
:formula_63
The geodesic spray is the unique horizontal vector field &quot;W&quot; satisfying
:formula_64
at each point &quot;v&quot; ∈ T&quot;M&quot;; here ∗ : TT&quot;M&quot; → T&quot;M&quot; denotes the pushforward (differential) along the projection  : T&quot;M&quot; → &quot;M&quot; associated to the tangent bundle.

More generally, the same construction allows one to construct a vector field for any Ehresmann connection on the tangent bundle. For the resulting vector field to be a spray (on the deleted tangent bundle T&quot;M&quot; \ {0}) it is enough that the connection be equivariant under positive rescalings: it need not be linear. That is, (cf. Ehresmann connection#Vector bundles and covariant derivatives) it is enough that the horizontal distribution satisfy
:formula_65
for every &quot;X&quot; ∈ T&quot;M&quot; \ {0} and λ &gt; 0. Here &quot;d&quot;(&quot;S&quot;λ) is the pushforward along the scalar homothety formula_66 A particular case of a non-linear connection arising in this manner is that associated to a Finsler manifold.

===Affine and projective geodesics===
Equation () is invariant under affine reparameterizations; that is, parameterizations of the form
:formula_67
where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are constant real numbers. Thus apart from specifying a certain class of embedded curves, the geodesic equation also determines a preferred class of parameterizations on each of the curves. Accordingly, solutions of () are called geodesics with affine parameter.

An affine connection is &quot;determined by&quot; its family of affinely parameterized geodesics, up to torsion . The torsion itself does not, in fact, affect the family of geodesics, since the geodesic equation depends only on the symmetric part of the connection. More precisely, if formula_68 are two connections such that the difference tensor
:formula_69
is skew-symmetric, then formula_40 and formula_71 have the same geodesics, with the same affine parameterizations. Furthermore, there is a unique connection having the same geodesics as formula_40, but with vanishing torsion.

Geodesics without a particular parameterization are described by a projective connection.

==Computational methods==
Efficient solvers for the minimal geodesic problem on surfaces have been proposed by Mitchell, Kimmel, Crane, and others.

== Ribbon test ==

A ribbon &quot;test&quot; is a way of finding a geodesic on a physical surface. The idea is to fit a bit of paper around a straight line (a ribbon) onto a curved surface as closely as possible without stretching or squishing the ribbon (without changing its internal geometry).

For example, when a ribbon is wound as a ring around a cone, the ribbon would not lie on the cone&#x27;s surface but stick out, so that circle is not a geodesic on the cone. If the ribbon is adjusted so that all its parts touch the cone&#x27;s surface, it would give an approximation to a geodesic.

Mathematically the ribbon test can be formulated as finding a mapping formula_73 of a neighborhood formula_74 of a line formula_75 in a plane into a surface formula_76 so that the mapping formula_77 &quot;doesn&#x27;t change the distances around formula_75 by much&quot;; that is, at the distance formula_79 from formula_80 we have formula_81 where formula_82 and formula_83 are metrics on formula_74 and formula_76.

==Examples of applications==

While geometric in nature, the idea of a shortest path is so general that it easily finds extensive use in nearly all sciences, and in some other disciplines as well.

=== Topology and geometric group theory ===

* In a surface with negative Euler characteristic, any (free) homotopy class determines a unique (closed) geodesic for a hyperbolic metric. These geodesics contribute significantly to the geometric understanding of the action of mapping classes.
* Geodesic metric spaces and length spaces behave particularly well with isometric group actions (Švarc-Milnor lemma, Hopf-Rinow theorem, Morse lemma...). They are often an adequate framework for generalizing results from Riemannian geometry to constructions that reflect the geometry of a group. For instance, Gromov-hyperbolicity can be understood in terms of geodesic triangle thinness, and CAT(0) can be stated in terms of angles between geodesics.

=== Probability, statistics and machine learning ===

* Optimal transport can be understood as the problem of finding geodesic paths in spaces of measures.
* In information geometry, divergences such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence play a role analogous to that of a Riemannian metric, allowing analogies for connections and geodesics.

=== Physics ===

* In classical mechanics, trajectories minimize an energy according to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, which can re regarded as a similar idea to geodesics. In some special cases, the two notions actually coincide.
* Relativity theory models spacetime as a Lorentzian manifold, where light follows Lorentzian geodesics.

=== Biology ===

* The study of how the nervous system optimizes muscular movement may be approached by endowing a configuration space of the body with a Riemannian metric that measures the effort, so that the problem can be stated in terms of geodesy.
* Geodesic distance is often used to measure the length of paths for signal propagation in neurons.
* The structures of geodesics in large molecules plays a role in the study of protein folds.

=== Engineering ===
Geodesics serve as the basis to calculate:
* geodesic airframes; see geodesic airframe or geodetic airframe
* geodesic structures – for example geodesic domes
* horizontal distances on or near Earth; see Earth geodesics
* mapping images on surfaces, for rendering; see UV mapping
* robot motion planning (e.g., when painting car parts); see Shortest path problem
* geodesic shortest path (GSP) correction over Poisson surface reconstruction (e.g. in digital dentistry); without GSP reconstruction often results in self-intersections within the surface

<doc id="91099" wikidata="Q831801" url="?curid=91099" title="Business continuity planning">
<text>Business continuity may be defined as &quot;the capability of an organization to continue the delivery of products or services at pre-defined acceptable levels following a disruptive incident&quot;, and business continuity planning (or business continuity and resiliency planning) is the process of creating systems of prevention and recovery to deal with potential threats to a company. In addition to prevention, the goal is to enable ongoing operations before and during execution of disaster recovery. Business continuity is the intended outcome of proper execution of both business continuity planning and disaster recovery.

Several business continuity standards have been published by various standards bodies to assist in checklisting ongoing planning tasks.

Business continuity requires a top-down approach to identify an organisation&#x27;s minimum requirements to ensure its viability as an entity. An organization&#x27;s resistance to failure is &quot;the ability ... to withstand changes in its environment and still function&quot;. Often called resilience, resistance to failure is a capability that enables organizations to either endure environmental changes without having to permanently adapt, or the organization is forced to adapt a new way of working that better suits the new environmental conditions.

==Overview==
Any event that could negatively impact operations should be included in the plan, such as supply chain interruption, loss of or damage to critical infrastructure (major machinery or computing/network resource). As such, BCP is a subset of risk management. In the U.S., government entities refer to the process as &quot;continuity of operations planning&quot; (COOP). A business continuity plan outlines a range of disaster scenarios and the steps the business will take in any particular scenario to return to regular trade. BCP&#x27;s are written ahead of time and can also include precautions to be put in place. Usually created with the input of key staff as well as stakeholders, a BCP is a set of contingencies to minimize potential harm to businesses during adverse scenarios.

===Resilience===
A 2005 analysis of how disruptions can adversely affect the operations of corporations and how investments in resilience can give a competitive advantage over entities not prepared for various contingencies extended then-common business continuity planning practices. Business organizations such as the Council on Competitiveness embraced this resilience goal.

Adapting to change in an apparently slower, more evolutionary manner - sometimes over many years or decades - has been described as being more resilient, and the term &quot;strategic resilience&quot; is now used to go beyond resisting a one-time crisis, but rather continuously anticipating and adjusting, &quot;before the case for change becomes desperately obvious&quot;.

This approach is sometimes summarized as: preparedness, protection, response and recovery.

Resilience Theory can be related to the field of Public Relations. Resilience is a communicative process that is constructed by citizens, families, media system, organizations and governments through everyday talk and mediated conversation.

The theory is based on the work of Patrice M. Buzzanell, a professor at the Brian Lamb School of Communication at Purdue University. In her 2010 article, &quot;Resilience: Talking, Resisting, and Imagining New Normalcies Into Being&quot; Buzzanell discussed the ability for organizations to thrive after having a crisis through building resistance. Buzzanell notes that there are five different processes that individuals use when trying to maintain resilience- crafting normalcy, affirming identity anchors, maintaining and using communication networks, putting alternative logics to work and downplaying negative feelings while foregrounding positive emotions.

When looking at the resilience theory, the crisis communication theory is similar, but not the same. The crisis communication theory is based on the reputation of the company, but the resilience theory is based on the process of recovery of the company. There are five main components of resilience: crafting normalcy, affirming identity anchors, maintaining and using communication networks, putting alternative logics to work, and downplaying negative feelings while foregrounding negative emotions. Each of these processes can be applicable to businesses in crisis times, making resilience an important factor for companies to focus on while training.

There are three main groups that are affected by a crisis. They are (individual), (group or organization) and (national or interorganizational). There are also two main types of resilience, which are proactive and post resilience. Proactive resilience is preparing for a crisis and creating a solid foundation for the company. Post resilience includes continuing to maintain communication and check in with employees. Proactive resilience is dealing with issues at hand before they cause a possible shift in the work environment and post resilience maintaining communication and accepting changes after an incident has happened. Resilience can be applied to any organization.
In New Zealand, the Canterbury University Resilient Organisations programme developed an assessment tool for benchmarking the Resilience of Organisations. It covers 11 categories, each having 5 to 7 questions. A &quot;Resilience Ratio&quot; summarizes this evaluation.

===Continuity===
Plans and procedures are used in business continuity planning to ensure that the critical organizational operations required to keep an organization running continue to operate during events when key dependencies of operations are disrupted. Continuity does not need to apply to every activity which the organization undertakes. For example, under ISO 22301:2019, organizations are required to define their business continuity objectives, the minimum levels of product and service operations which will be considered acceptable and the maximum tolerable period of disruption (MTPD) which can be allowed.

A major cost in planning for this is the preparation of audit compliance management documents; automation tools are available to reduce the time and cost associated with manually producing this information.

==Inventory==
Planners must have information about:
* Equipment
* Supplies and suppliers
* Locations, including other offices and backup/work area recovery (WAR) sites
* Documents and documentation, including which have off-site backup copies:
** Business documents
** Procedure documentation

==Analysis==
The analysis phase consists of:
* Impact analysis
* Threat and risks analysis
* Impact scenarios

Quantifying of loss ratios must also include &quot;dollars to defend a lawsuit.&quot; It has been estimated that a dollar spent in loss prevention can prevent &quot;seven dollars of disaster-related economic loss.&quot;

===Business impact analysis (BIA)===
A business impact analysis (BIA) differentiates critical (urgent) and non-critical (non-urgent) organization functions/activities. A function may be considered critical if dictated by law.

Each function/activity typically relies on a combination of constituent components in order to operate:

* Human resources (full-time staff, part-time staff, or contractors)
* IT systems
* Physical assets (mobile phones, laptops/workstations etc.)
* Documents (electronic or physical)

For each function, two values are assigned:
* Recovery point objective (RPO) – the acceptable latency of data that will not be recovered. For example, is it acceptable for the company to lose 2 days of data? The recovery point objective must ensure that the maximum tolerable data loss for each activity is not exceeded.
* Recovery time objective (RTO)  – the acceptable amount of time to restore the function

==== Maximum RTO ====
Maximum time constraints for how long an enterprise&#x27;s key products or services can be unavailable or undeliverable before stakeholders perceive unacceptable consequences have been named as:
* (MTPoD)
* Maximum tolerable downtime (MTD)
* Maximum tolerable outage (MTO)
* Maximum acceptable outage (MAO)

According to ISO 22301 the terms &quot;maximum acceptable outage&quot; and &quot;maximum tolerable period of disruption&quot; mean the same thing and are defined using exactly the same words. Some standards use the term &quot;maximum downtime limit&quot;.

====Consistency====
When more than one system crashes, recovery plans must balance the need for data consistency with other objectives, such as RTO and RPO.
 Recovery Consistency Objective (RCO) is the name of this goal. It applies data consistency objectives, to define a measurement for the consistency of distributed business data within interlinked systems after a disaster incident. Similar terms used in this context are &quot;Recovery Consistency Characteristics&quot; (RCC) and &quot;Recovery Object Granularity&quot; (ROG).

While RTO and RPO are absolute per-system values, RCO is expressed as a percentage that measures the deviation between actual and targeted state of business data across systems for process groups or individual business processes.

The following formula calculates RCO with &quot;n&quot; representing the number of business processes and &quot;entities&quot; representing an abstract value for business data:
formula_1

100% RCO means that post recovery, no business data deviation occurs.

===Threat and risk analysis (TRA)===
After defining recovery requirements, each potential threat may require unique recovery steps (contingency plans or playbooks). Common threats include:
The above areas can cascade: Responders can stumble. Supplies may become depleted. During the 2002–2003 SARS outbreak, some organizations compartmentalized and rotated teams to match the incubation period of the disease. They also banned in-person contact during both business and non-business hours. This increased resiliency against the threat.

===Impact scenarios===
Impact scenarios are identified and documented:
* need for medical supplies
* need for transportation options
* civilian impact of nuclear disasters
* need for business and data processing supplies

These should reflect the widest possible damage.

==Tiers of preparedness==
SHARE&#x27;s seven tiers of disaster recovery released in 1992, were updated in 2012 by IBM as an eight tier model:
* Tier 0 – No off-site data • Businesses with a Tier 0 Disaster Recovery solution have no Disaster Recovery Plan. There is no saved information, no documentation, no backup hardware, and no contingency plan. Typical recovery time: &quot;The length of recovery time in this instance is unpredictable&quot;. In fact, it may not be possible to recover at all.
*Tier 1 – Data backup with no Hot Site • Businesses that use Tier 1 Disaster Recovery solutions back up their data at an off-site facility. Depending on how often backups are made, they are prepared to accept &quot;several days to weeks of data loss&quot;, but their backups are secure off-site. However, this Tier lacks the systems on which to restore data. Pickup Truck Access Method (PTAM).
*Tier 2 – Data backup with Hot Site • Tier 2 Disaster Recovery solutions make regular backups on tape. This is combined with an off-site facility and infrastructure (known as a hot site) in which to restore systems from those tapes in the event of a disaster. This tier solution will still result in the need to recreate several hours to days worth of data, but &quot;it is less unpredictable in recovery time&quot;. Examples include: PTAM with Hot Site available, IBM Tivoli Storage Manager.
*Tier 3 – Electronic vaulting • Tier 3 solutions utilize components of Tier 2. Additionally, some mission-critical data is electronically vaulted. This electronically vaulted data is typically more current than that which is shipped via PTAM. As a result there is &quot;less data recreation or loss after a disaster occurs&quot;.
*Tier 4 – Point-in-time copies • Tier 4 solutions are used by businesses that require both greater data currency and faster recovery than users of lower tiers. Rather than relying largely on shipping tape, as is common in the lower tiers, Tier 4 solutions begin to incorporate more disk-based solutions. &quot;Several hours of data loss is still possible&quot;, but it is easier to make such point-in-time (PIT) copies with greater frequency than data that can be replicated through tape-based solutions.
*Tier 5 – Transaction integrity • Tier 5 solutions are used by businesses with a requirement for consistency of data between production and recovery data centers. There is &quot;little to no data loss&quot; in such solutions; however, the presence of this functionality is entirely dependent on the application in use.
*Tier 6 – Zero or little data loss • Tier 6 Disaster Recovery solutions &quot;maintain the highest levels of data currency&quot;. They are used by businesses with little or no tolerance for data loss and who need to restore data to applications rapidly. These solutions have no dependence on the applications to provide data consistency. 
*Tier 7 – Highly automated, business-integrated solution • Tier 7 solutions include all the major components being used for a Tier 6 solution with the additional integration of automation. This allows a Tier 7 solution to ensure consistency of data above that of which is granted by Tier 6 solutions. Additionally, recovery of the applications is automated, allowing for restoration of systems and applications much faster and more reliably than would be possible through manual Disaster Recovery procedures.

==Solution design==
Two main requirements from the impact analysis stage are:
* For IT: the minimum application and data requirements and the time in which they must be available.
* Outside IT: preservation of hard copy (such as contracts). A process plan must consider skilled staff and embedded technology.

This phase overlaps with disaster recovery planning.

The solution phase determines:
* Crisis management command structure
* Telecommunication architecture between primary and secondary work sites
* Data replication methodology between primary and secondary work sites
* Backup site with applications, data and work space

== Standards==

Within the UK, BS 25999-2:2007 and BS 25999-1:2006 were being used for business continuity management across all organizations, industries and sectors. These documents give a practical plan to deal with most eventualities—from extreme weather conditions to terrorism, IT system failure, and staff sickness.

In 2004, following crises in the preceding years, the UK government passed the Civil Contingencies Act of 2004: Businesses must have continuity planning measures to survive and continue to thrive whilst working towards keeping the incident as minimal as possible.
The Act was separated into two parts: 
Part 1: civil protection, covering roles &amp; responsibilities for local responders
Part 2: emergency powers.
In the United Kingdom, resilience is implemented locally by the Local Resilience Forum.

==Implementation and testing==
The implementation phase involves policy changes, material acquisitions, staffing and testing.

===Testing and organizational acceptance===
The 2008 book &quot;Exercising for Excellence&quot;, published by The British Standards Institution identified three types of exercises that can be employed when testing business continuity plans.
* Tabletop exercises - a small number of people concentrate on a specific aspect of a BCP. Another form involves a single representative from each of several teams. 
* Medium exercises - Several departments, teams or disciplines concentrate on multiple BCP aspects; the scope can range from a few teams from one building to multiple teams operating across dispersed locations. Pre-scripted &quot;surprises&quot; are added.
* Complex exercises - All aspects of a medium exercise remain, but for maximum realism no-notice activation, actual evacuation and actual invocation of a disaster recovery site is added.

While start and stop times are pre-agreed, the actual duration might be unknown if events are allowed to run their course.

==Maintenance==
Biannual or annual maintenance cycle maintenance of a BCP manual is broken down into three periodic activities.

* Confirmation of information in the manual, roll out to staff for awareness and specific training for critical individuals.
* Testing and verification of technical solutions established for recovery operations.
* Testing and verification of organization recovery procedures.

Issues found during the testing phase often must be reintroduced to the analysis phase.

===Information and targets===
The BCP manual must evolve with the organization, and maintain information about who has to know what:

* A series of checklists
** Job descriptions, skillsets needed, training requirements
** Documentation and document management
* Definitions of terminology to facilitate timely communication during disaster recovery,
* Distribution lists (staff, important clients, vendors/suppliers)
* Information about communication and transportation infrastructure (roads, bridges)

===Technical===
Specialized technical resources must be maintained. Checks include:
* Virus definition distribution
* Application security and service patch distribution
* Hardware operability 
* Application operability 
* Data verification
* Data application

===Testing and verification of recovery procedures===
Software and work process changes must be documented and validated, including verification that documented work process recovery tasks and supporting disaster recovery infrastructure allow staff to recover within the predetermined recovery time objective.

<text>The Michelson–Morley experiment was an attempt to measure the motion of the Earth relative to the luminiferous aether, a supposed medium permeating space that was thought to be the carrier of light waves. The experiment was performed between April and July 1887 by American physicists Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley at what is now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, and published in November of the same year.

The experiment compared the speed of light in perpendicular directions in an attempt to detect the relative motion of matter, including their laboratory, through the luminiferous aether, or &quot;aether wind&quot; as it was sometimes called. The result was negative, in that Michelson and Morley found no significant difference between the speed of light in the direction of movement through the presumed aether, and the speed at right angles. This result is generally considered to be the first strong evidence against some aether theories, as well as initiating a line of research that eventually led to special relativity, which rules out motion against an aether. Of this experiment, Albert Einstein wrote, &quot;If the Michelson–Morley experiment had not brought us into serious embarrassment, no one would have regarded the relativity theory as a (halfway) redemption.&quot;

Michelson–Morley type experiments have been repeated many times with steadily increasing sensitivity. These include experiments from 1902 to 1905, and a series of experiments in the 1920s. More recently, in 2009, optical resonator experiments confirmed the absence of any aether wind at the 10−17 level. Together with the Ives–Stilwell and Kennedy–Thorndike experiments, Michelson–Morley type experiments form one of the fundamental tests of special relativity.

== Detecting the aether ==
Physics theories of the 19th century assumed that just as surface water waves must have a supporting substance, i.e., a &quot;medium&quot;, to move across (in this case water), and audible sound requires a medium to transmit its wave motions (such as air or water), so light must also require a medium, the &quot;luminiferous aether&quot;, to transmit its wave motions. Because light can travel through a vacuum, it was assumed that even a vacuum must be filled with aether. Because the speed of light is so great, and because material bodies pass through the &quot;aether&quot; without obvious friction or drag, it was assumed to have a highly unusual combination of properties. Designing experiments to investigate these properties was a high priority of 19th-century physics.

Earth orbits around the Sun at a speed of around , or . The Earth is in motion, so two main possibilities were considered: (1) The aether is stationary and only partially dragged by Earth (proposed by Augustin-Jean Fresnel in 1818), or (2) the aether is completely dragged by Earth and thus shares its motion at Earth&#x27;s surface (proposed by Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet in 1844). In addition, James Clerk Maxwell (1865) recognized the electromagnetic nature of light and developed what are now called Maxwell&#x27;s equations, but these equations were still interpreted as describing the motion of waves through an aether, whose state of motion was unknown. Eventually, Fresnel&#x27;s idea of an (almost) stationary aether was preferred because it appeared to be confirmed by the Fizeau experiment (1851) and the aberration of star light.
According to the stationary and the partially dragged aether hypotheses, Earth and the aether are in relative motion, implying that a so-called &quot;aether wind&quot; (Fig. 2) should exist. Although it would be theoretically possible for the Earth&#x27;s motion to match that of the aether at one moment in time, it was not possible for the Earth to remain at rest with respect to the aether at all times, because of the variation in both the direction and the speed of the motion. At any given point on the Earth&#x27;s surface, the magnitude and direction of the wind would vary with time of day and season. By analyzing the return speed of light in different directions at various different times, it was thought to be possible to measure the motion of the Earth relative to the aether. The expected relative difference in the measured speed of light was quite small, given that the velocity of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun has a magnitude of about one hundredth of one percent of the speed of light.

During the mid-19th century, measurements of aether wind effects of first order, i.e., effects proportional to &quot;v&quot;/&quot;c&quot; (&quot;v&quot; being Earth&#x27;s velocity, &quot;c&quot; the speed of light) were thought to be possible, but no direct measurement of the speed of light was possible with the accuracy required. For instance, the Fizeau wheel could measure the speed of light to perhaps 5% accuracy, which was quite inadequate for measuring directly a first-order 0.01% change in the speed of light. A number of physicists therefore attempted to make measurements of indirect first-order effects not of the speed of light itself, but of variations in the speed of light (see First order aether-drift experiments). The Hoek experiment, for example, was intended to detect interferometric fringe shifts due to speed differences of oppositely propagating light waves through water at rest. The results of such experiments were all negative. This could be explained by using Fresnel&#x27;s dragging coefficient, according to which the aether and thus light are partially dragged by moving matter. Partial aether-dragging would thwart attempts to measure any first order change in the speed of light. As pointed out by Maxwell (1878), only experimental arrangements capable of measuring second order effects would have any hope of detecting aether drift, i.e., effects proportional to &quot;v&quot;2/&quot;c&quot;2. Existing experimental setups, however, were not sensitive enough to measure effects of that size.

== 1881 and 1887 experiments ==

=== Michelson experiment (1881) ===
Michelson had a solution to the problem of how to construct a device sufficiently accurate to detect aether flow. In 1877, while teaching at his alma mater, the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Michelson conducted his first known light speed experiments as a part of a classroom demonstration. In 1881, he left active U.S. Naval service while in Germany concluding his studies. In that year, Michelson used a prototype experimental device to make several more measurements.

The device he designed, later known as a Michelson interferometer, sent yellow light from a sodium flame (for alignment), or white light (for the actual observations), through a half-silvered mirror that was used to split it into two beams traveling at right angles to one another. After leaving the splitter, the beams traveled out to the ends of long arms where they were reflected back into the middle by small mirrors. They then recombined on the far side of the splitter in an eyepiece, producing a pattern of constructive and destructive interference whose transverse displacement would depend on the relative time it takes light to transit the longitudinal &quot;vs.&quot; the transverse arms. If the Earth is traveling through an aether medium, a light beam traveling parallel to the flow of that aether will take longer to reflect back and forth than would a beam traveling perpendicular to the aether, because the increase in elapsed time from traveling against the aether wind is more than the time saved by traveling with the aether wind. Michelson expected that the Earth&#x27;s motion would produce a fringe shift equal to 0.04 fringes—that is, of the separation between areas of the same intensity. He did not observe the expected shift; the greatest average deviation that he measured (in the northwest direction) was only 0.018 fringes; most of his measurements were much less. His conclusion was that Fresnel&#x27;s hypothesis of a stationary aether with partial aether dragging would have to be rejected, and thus he confirmed Stokes&#x27; hypothesis of complete aether dragging.

However, Alfred Potier (and later Hendrik Lorentz) pointed out to Michelson that he had made an error of calculation, and that the expected fringe shift should have been only 0.02 fringes. Michelson&#x27;s apparatus was subject to experimental errors far too large to say anything conclusive about the aether wind. Definitive measurement of the aether wind would require an experiment with greater accuracy and better controls than the original. Nevertheless, the prototype was successful in demonstrating that the basic method was feasible.

=== Michelson–Morley experiment (1887) ===

In 1885, Michelson began a collaboration with Edward Morley, spending considerable time and money to confirm with higher accuracy Fizeau&#x27;s 1851 experiment on Fresnel&#x27;s drag coefficient, to improve on Michelson&#x27;s 1881 experiment, and to establish the wavelength of light as a standard of length. John Brashear made the high-quality optics for the Interferometer in his Allegheny-Observatory-affiliated shop. At this time Michelson was professor of physics at the Case School of Applied Science, and Morley was professor of chemistry at Western Reserve University (WRU), which shared a campus with the Case School on the eastern edge of Cleveland. Michelson suffered a mental health crisis in September 1885, from which he recovered by October 1885. Morley ascribed this breakdown to the intense work of Michelson during the preparation of the experiments. In 1886, Michelson and Morley successfully confirmed Fresnel&#x27;s drag coefficient – this result was also considered as a confirmation of the stationary aether concept.

This result strengthened their hope of finding the aether wind. Michelson and Morley created an improved version of the Michelson experiment with more than enough accuracy to detect this hypothetical effect. The experiment was performed in several periods of concentrated observations between April and July 1887, in the basement of Adelbert Dormitory of WRU (later renamed Pierce Hall, demolished in 1962).

As shown in the diagram to the right, the light was repeatedly reflected back and forth along the arms of the interferometer, increasing the path length to . At this length, the drift would be about 0.4 fringes. To make that easily detectable, the apparatus was assembled in a closed room in the basement of the heavy stone dormitory, eliminating most thermal and vibrational effects. Vibrations were further reduced by building the apparatus on top of a large block of sandstone (Fig. 1), about a foot thick and square, which was then floated in a circular trough of mercury. They estimated that effects of about 0.01 fringe would be detectable.
Michelson and Morley and other early experimentalists using interferometric techniques in an attempt to measure the properties of the luminiferous aether, used (partially) monochromatic light only for initially setting up their equipment, always switching to white light for the actual measurements. The reason is that measurements were recorded visually. Purely monochromatic light would result in a uniform fringe pattern. Lacking modern means of environmental temperature control, experimentalists struggled with continual fringe drift even when the interferometer was set up in a basement. Because the fringes would occasionally disappear due to vibrations caused by passing horse traffic, distant thunderstorms and the like, an observer could easily &quot;get lost&quot; when the fringes returned to visibility. The advantages of white light, which produced a distinctive colored fringe pattern, far outweighed the difficulties of aligning the apparatus due to its low coherence length. As Dayton Miller wrote, &quot;White light fringes were chosen for the observations because they consist of a small group of fringes having a central, sharply defined black fringe which forms a permanent zero reference mark for all readings.&quot; Use of partially monochromatic light (yellow sodium light) during initial alignment enabled the researchers to locate the position of equal path length, more or less easily, before switching to white light.

The mercury trough allowed the device to turn with close to zero friction, so that once having given the sandstone block a single push it would slowly rotate through the entire range of possible angles to the &quot;aether wind&quot;, while measurements were continuously observed by looking through the eyepiece. The hypothesis of aether drift implies that because one of the arms would inevitably turn into the direction of the wind at the same time that another arm was turning perpendicularly to the wind, an effect should be noticeable even over a period of minutes.

The expectation was that the effect would be graphable as a sine wave with two peaks and two troughs per rotation of the device. This result could have been expected because during each full rotation, each arm would be parallel to the wind twice (facing into and away from the wind giving identical readings) and perpendicular to the wind twice. Additionally, due to the Earth&#x27;s rotation, the wind would be expected to show periodic changes in direction and magnitude during the course of a sidereal day.

Because of the motion of the Earth around the Sun, the measured data were also expected to show annual variations.

=== Most famous &quot;failed&quot; experiment ===

After all this thought and preparation, the experiment became what has been called the most famous failed experiment in history. Instead of providing insight into the properties of the aether, Michelson and Morley&#x27;s article in the &quot;American Journal of Science&quot; reported the measurement to be as small as one-fortieth of the expected displacement (Fig. 7), but &quot;since the displacement is proportional to the square of the velocity&quot; they concluded that the measured velocity was &quot;probably less than one-sixth&quot; of the expected velocity of the Earth&#x27;s motion in orbit and &quot;certainly less than one-fourth&quot;. Although this small &quot;velocity&quot; was measured, it was considered far too small to be used as evidence of speed relative to the aether, and it was understood to be within the range of an experimental error that would allow the speed to actually be zero. For instance, Michelson wrote about the &quot;decidedly negative result&quot; in a letter to Lord Rayleigh in August 1887:

From the standpoint of the then current aether models, the experimental results were conflicting. The Fizeau experiment and its 1886 repetition by Michelson and Morley apparently confirmed the stationary aether with partial aether dragging, and refuted complete aether dragging. On the other hand, the much more precise Michelson–Morley experiment (1887) apparently confirmed complete aether dragging and refuted the stationary aether. In addition, the Michelson–Morley null result was further substantiated by the null results of other second-order experiments of different kind, namely the Trouton–Noble experiment (1903) and the experiments of Rayleigh and Brace (1902–1904). These problems and their solution led to the development of the Lorentz transformation and special relativity.

After the &quot;failed&quot; experiment Michelson and Morley ceased their aether drift measurements and started to use their newly developed technique to establish the wavelength of light as a standard of length.

== Light path analysis and consequences ==
=== Observer resting in the aether ===

The beam travel time in the longitudinal direction can be derived as follows: Light is sent from the source and propagates with the speed of light formula_1 in the aether. It passes through the half-silvered mirror at the origin at formula_2. The reflecting mirror is at that moment at distance formula_3 (the length of the interferometer arm) and is moving with velocity formula_4. The beam hits the mirror at time formula_5 and thus travels the distance formula_6. At this time, the mirror has traveled the distance formula_7. Thus formula_8 and consequently the travel time formula_9. The same consideration applies to the backward journey, with the sign of formula_4 reversed, resulting in formula_11 and formula_12. The total travel time formula_13 is:

:formula_14

Michelson obtained this expression correctly in 1881, however, in transverse direction he obtained the incorrect expression

:formula_15

because he overlooked the increase in path length in the rest frame of the aether. This was corrected by Alfred Potier (1882) and Hendrik Lorentz (1886). The derivation in the transverse direction can be given as follows (analogous to the derivation of time dilation using a light clock): The beam is propagating at the speed of light formula_1 and hits the mirror at time formula_17, traveling the distance formula_18. At the same time, the mirror has traveled the distance formula_19 in the &quot;x&quot; direction. So in order to hit the mirror, the travel path of the beam is formula_3 in the &quot;y&quot; direction (assuming equal-length arms) and formula_19 in the &quot;x&quot; direction. This inclined travel path follows from the transformation from the interferometer rest frame to the aether rest frame. Therefore, the Pythagorean theorem gives the actual beam travel distance of formula_22. Thus formula_23 and consequently the travel time formula_24, which is the same for the backward journey. The total travel time formula_25 is:

:formula_26

The time difference between formula_27 and formula_28 is given by

:formula_29

To find the path difference, simply multiply by formula_30;

formula_31

The path difference is denoted by formula_32 because the beams are out of phase by a some number of wavelengths (formula_33). To visualise this, consider taking the two beam paths along the longitudinal and transverse plane, and lying them straight (an animation of this is shown at minute 11:00, The Mechanical Universe, episode 41). One path will be longer than the other, this distance is formula_32. Alternatively, consider the rearrangement of the speed of light formula formula_35 .

If the relation formula_36 is true (if the velocity of the aether is small relative to the speed of light), then the expression can be simplified using a first order binomial expansion;

formula_37

So, rewriting the above in terms of powers;

formula_38

Applying binomial simplification;

formula_39

Therefore;

formula_40

It can be seen from this derivation that aether wind manifests as a path difference. The path difference is zero only when the interferometer is aligned with or perpendicular to the aether wind, and it reaches a maximum when it is at a 45° angle. The path difference can be any fraction of the wavelength, depending on the angle and speed of the aether wind.

To prove the existence of the aether, Michelson and Morley sought to find the &quot;fringe shift&quot;. The idea was simple, the fringes of the interference pattern should shift when rotating it by 90° as the two beams have exchanged roles. To find the fringe shift, subtract the path difference in first orientation by the path difference in the second, then divide by the wavelength, formula_33, of light;

: formula_42

Note the difference between formula_32, which is some number of wavelengths, and formula_33 which is a single wavelength. As can be seen by this relation, fringe shift n is a unitless quantity.

Since &quot;L&quot; ≈ 11 meters and λ ≈ 500 nanometers, the expected fringe shift was &quot;n&quot; ≈ 0.44. The negative result led Michelson to the conclusion that there is no measurable aether drift. However, he never accepted this on a personal level, and the negative result haunted him for the rest of his life.

=== Observer comoving with the interferometer ===
If the same situation is described from the view of an observer co-moving with the interferometer, then the effect of aether wind is similar to the effect experienced by a swimmer, who tries to move with velocity formula_1 against a river flowing with velocity formula_4.

In the longitudinal direction the swimmer first moves upstream, so his velocity is diminished due to the river flow to formula_47. On his way back moving downstream, his velocity is increased to formula_48. This gives the beam travel times formula_5 and formula_50 as mentioned above.

In the transverse direction, the swimmer has to compensate for the river flow by moving at a certain angle against the flow direction, in order to sustain his exact transverse direction of motion and to reach the other side of the river at the correct location. This diminishes his speed to formula_51, and gives the beam travel time formula_17 as mentioned above.

=== Mirror reflection ===
The classical analysis predicted a relative phase shift between the longitudinal and transverse beams which in Michelson and Morley&#x27;s apparatus should have been readily measurable. What is not often appreciated (since there was no means of measuring it), is that motion through the hypothetical aether should also have caused the two beams to diverge as they emerged from the interferometer by about 10−8 radians.

For an apparatus in motion, the classical analysis requires that the beam-splitting mirror be slightly offset from an exact 45° if the longitudinal and transverse beams are to emerge from the apparatus exactly superimposed. In the relativistic analysis, Lorentz-contraction of the beam splitter in the direction of motion causes it to become more perpendicular by precisely the amount necessary to compensate for the angle discrepancy of the two beams.

=== Length contraction and Lorentz transformation ===

A first step to explaining the Michelson and Morley experiment&#x27;s null result was found in the FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction hypothesis, now simply called length contraction or Lorentz contraction, first proposed by George FitzGerald (1889) in a letter to same journal that published the Michelson-Morley paper, as &quot;almost the only hypothesis that can reconcile&quot; the apparent contradictions. It was independently also proposed by Hendrik Lorentz (1892). According to this law all objects physically contract by formula_53 along the line of motion (originally thought to be relative to the aether), formula_54 being the Lorentz factor. This hypothesis was partly motivated by Oliver Heaviside&#x27;s discovery in 1888 that electrostatic fields are contracting in the line of motion. But since there was no reason at that time to assume that binding forces in matter are of electric origin, length contraction of matter in motion with respect to the aether was considered an ad hoc hypothesis.

If length contraction of formula_3 is inserted into the above formula for formula_56, then the light propagation time in the longitudinal direction becomes equal to that in the transverse direction:

:formula_57

However, length contraction is only a special case of the more general relation, according to which the transverse length is larger than the longitudinal length by the ratio formula_58. This can be achieved in many ways. If formula_59 is the moving longitudinal length and formula_60 the moving transverse length, formula_61 being the rest lengths, then it is given:

:formula_62

formula_63 can be arbitrarily chosen, so there are infinitely many combinations to explain the Michelson–Morley null result. For instance, if formula_64 the relativistic value of length contraction of formula_59 occurs, but if formula_66 then no length contraction but an elongation of formula_60 occurs. This hypothesis was later extended by Joseph Larmor (1897), Lorentz (1904) and Henri Poincaré (1905), who developed the complete Lorentz transformation including time dilation in order to explain the Trouton–Noble experiment, the Experiments of Rayleigh and Brace, and Kaufmann&#x27;s experiments. It has the form

:formula_68

It remained to define the value of formula_63, which was shown by Lorentz (1904) to be unity. In general, Poincaré (1905) demonstrated that only formula_64 allows this transformation to form a group, so it is the only choice compatible with the principle of relativity, &quot;i.e.,&quot; making the stationary aether undetectable. Given this, length contraction and time dilation obtain their exact relativistic values.

=== Special relativity ===
Albert Einstein formulated the theory of special relativity by 1905, deriving the Lorentz transformation and thus length contraction and time dilation from the relativity postulate and the constancy of the speed of light, thus removing the &quot;ad hoc&quot; character from the contraction hypothesis. Einstein emphasized the kinematic foundation of the theory and the modification of the notion of space and time, with the stationary aether no longer playing any role in his theory. He also pointed out the group character of the transformation. Einstein was motivated by Maxwell&#x27;s theory of electromagnetism (in the form as it was given by Lorentz in 1895) and the lack of evidence for the luminiferous aether.

This allows a more elegant and intuitive explanation of the Michelson–Morley null result. In a comoving frame the null result is self-evident, since the apparatus can be considered as at rest in accordance with the relativity principle, thus the beam travel times are the same. In a frame relative to which the apparatus is moving, the same reasoning applies as described above in &quot;Length contraction and Lorentz transformation&quot;, except the word &quot;aether&quot; has to be replaced by &quot;non-comoving inertial frame&quot;. Einstein wrote in 1916:

The extent to which the null result of the Michelson–Morley experiment influenced Einstein is disputed. Alluding to some statements of Einstein, many historians argue that it played no significant role in his path to special relativity, while other statements of Einstein probably suggest that he was influenced by it. In any case, the null result of the Michelson–Morley experiment helped the notion of the constancy of the speed of light gain widespread and rapid acceptance.

It was later shown by Howard Percy Robertson (1949) and others (see Robertson–Mansouri–Sexl test theory), that it is possible to derive the Lorentz transformation entirely from the combination of three experiments. First, the Michelson–Morley experiment showed that the speed of light is independent of the &quot;orientation&quot; of the apparatus, establishing the relationship between longitudinal (β) and transverse (δ) lengths. Then in 1932, Roy Kennedy and Edward Thorndike modified the Michelson–Morley experiment by making the path lengths of the split beam unequal, with one arm being very short. The Kennedy–Thorndike experiment took place for many months as the Earth moved around the sun. Their negative result showed that the speed of light is independent of the &quot;velocity&quot; of the apparatus in different inertial frames. In addition it established that besides length changes, corresponding time changes must also occur, i.e., it established the relationship between longitudinal lengths (β) and time changes (α). So both experiments do not provide the individual values of these quantities. This uncertainty corresponds to the undefined factor formula_63 as described above. It was clear due to theoretical reasons (the group character of the Lorentz transformation as required by the relativity principle) that the individual values of length contraction and time dilation must assume their exact relativistic form. But a direct measurement of one of these quantities was still desirable to confirm the theoretical results. This was achieved by the Ives–Stilwell experiment (1938), measuring α in accordance with time dilation. Combining this value for α with the Kennedy–Thorndike null result shows that &quot;β&quot; must assume the value of relativistic length contraction. Combining &quot;β&quot; with the Michelson–Morley null result shows that &quot;δ&quot; must be zero. Therefore, the Lorentz transformation with formula_64 is an unavoidable consequence of the combination of these three experiments.

Special relativity is generally considered the solution to all negative aether drift (or isotropy of the speed of light) measurements, including the Michelson–Morley null result. Many high precision measurements have been conducted as tests of special relativity and modern searches for Lorentz violation in the photon, electron, nucleon, or neutrino sector, all of them confirming relativity.

=== Incorrect alternatives ===
As mentioned above, Michelson initially believed that his experiment would confirm Stokes&#x27; theory, according to which the aether was fully dragged in the vicinity of the earth (see Aether drag hypothesis). However, complete aether drag contradicts the observed aberration of light and was contradicted by other experiments as well. In addition, Lorentz showed in 1886 that Stokes&#x27;s attempt to explain aberration is contradictory.

Furthermore, the assumption that the aether is not carried in the vicinity, but only &quot;within&quot; matter, was very problematic as shown by the Hammar experiment (1935). Hammar directed one leg of his interferometer through a heavy metal pipe plugged with lead. If aether were dragged by mass, it was theorized that the mass of the sealed metal pipe would have been enough to cause a visible effect. Once again, no effect was seen, so aether-drag theories are considered to be disproven.

Walther Ritz&#x27;s emission theory (or ballistic theory) was also consistent with the results of the experiment, not requiring aether. The theory postulates that light has always the same velocity in respect to the source. However de Sitter noted that emitter theory predicted several optical effects that were not seen in observations of binary stars in which the light from the two stars could be measured in a spectrometer. If emission theory were correct, the light from the stars should experience unusual fringe shifting due to the velocity of the stars being added to the speed of the light, but no such effect could be seen. It was later shown by J. G. Fox that the original de Sitter experiments were flawed due to extinction, but in 1977 Brecher observed X-rays from binary star systems with similar null results. Furthermore, Filippas and Fox (1964) conducted terrestrial particle accelerator tests specifically designed to address Fox&#x27;s earlier &quot;extinction&quot; objection, the results being inconsistent with source dependence of the speed of light.

== Subsequent experiments ==

Although Michelson and Morley went on to different experiments after their first publication in 1887, both remained active in the field. Other versions of the experiment were carried out with increasing sophistication. Morley was not convinced of his own results, and went on to conduct additional experiments with Dayton Miller from 1902 to 1904. Again, the result was negative within the margins of error.

Miller worked on increasingly larger interferometers, culminating in one with a (effective) arm length that he tried at various sites, including on top of a mountain at the Mount Wilson Observatory. To avoid the possibility of the aether wind being blocked by solid walls, his mountaintop observations used a special shed with thin walls, mainly of canvas. From noisy, irregular data, he consistently extracted a small positive signal that varied with each rotation of the device, with the sidereal day, and on a yearly basis. His measurements in the 1920s amounted to approximately instead of the nearly expected from the Earth&#x27;s orbital motion alone. He remained convinced this was due to partial entrainment or aether dragging, though he did not attempt a detailed explanation. He ignored critiques demonstrating the inconsistency of his results and the refutation by the Hammar experiment. Miller&#x27;s findings were considered important at the time, and were discussed by Michelson, Lorentz and others at a meeting reported in 1928. There was general agreement that more experimentation was needed to check Miller&#x27;s results. Miller later built a non-magnetic device to eliminate magnetostriction, while Michelson built one of non-expanding Invar to eliminate any remaining thermal effects. Other experimenters from around the world increased accuracy, eliminated possible side effects, or both. So far, no one has been able to replicate Miller&#x27;s results, and modern experimental accuracies have ruled them out. Roberts (2006) has pointed out that the primitive data reduction techniques used by Miller and other early experimenters, including Michelson and Morley, were capable of &quot;creating&quot; apparent periodic signals even when none existed in the actual data. After reanalyzing Miller&#x27;s original data using modern techniques of quantitative error analysis, Roberts found Miller&#x27;s apparent signals to be statistically insignificant.

Using a special optical arrangement involving a 1/20 wave step in one mirror, Roy J. Kennedy (1926) and K.K. Illingworth (1927) (Fig. 8) converted the task of detecting fringe shifts from the relatively insensitive one of estimating their lateral displacements to the considerably more sensitive task of adjusting the light intensity on both sides of a sharp boundary for equal luminance. If they observed unequal illumination on either side of the step, such as in Fig. 8e, they would add or remove calibrated weights from the interferometer until both sides of the step were once again evenly illuminated, as in Fig. 8d. The number of weights added or removed provided a measure of the fringe shift. Different observers could detect changes as little as 1/1500 to 1/300 of a fringe. Kennedy also carried out an experiment at Mount Wilson, finding only about 1/10 the drift measured by Miller and no seasonal effects.

In 1930, Georg Joos conducted an experiment using an automated interferometer with arms forged from pressed quartz having a very low coefficient of thermal expansion, that took continuous photographic strip recordings of the fringes through dozens of revolutions of the apparatus. Displacements of 1/1000 of a fringe could be measured on the photographic plates. No periodic fringe displacements were found, placing an upper limit to the aether wind of .

In the table below, the expected values are related to the relative speed between Earth and Sun of . With respect to the speed of the solar system around the galactic center of about , or the speed of the solar system relative to the CMB rest frame of about , the null results of those experiments are even more obvious.

== Recent experiments ==

===Optical tests===
Optical tests of the isotropy of the speed of light became commonplace. New technologies, including the use of lasers and masers, have significantly improved measurement precision. (In the following table, only Essen (1955), Jaseja (1964), and Shamir/Fox (1969) are experiments of Michelson–Morley type, &quot;i.e.,&quot; comparing two perpendicular beams. The other optical experiments employed different methods.)

=== Recent optical resonator experiments ===
During the early 21st century, there has been a resurgence in interest in performing precise Michelson–Morley type experiments using lasers, masers, cryogenic optical resonators, etc. This is in large part due to predictions of quantum gravity that suggest that special relativity may be violated at scales accessible to experimental study. The first of these highly accurate experiments was conducted by Brillet &amp; Hall (1979), in which they analyzed a laser frequency stabilized to a resonance of a rotating optical Fabry–Pérot cavity. They set a limit on the anisotropy of the speed of light resulting from the Earth&#x27;s motions of Δ&quot;c&quot;/&quot;c&quot; ≈ 10−15, where Δ&quot;c&quot; is the difference between the speed of light in the &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-directions.

As of 2015, optical and microwave resonator experiments have improved this limit to Δ&quot;c&quot;/&quot;c&quot; ≈ 10−18. In some of them, the devices were rotated or remained stationary, and some were combined with the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment. In particular, Earth&#x27;s direction and velocity (ca. ) relative to the CMB rest frame are ordinarily used as references in these searches for anisotropies.


===Other tests of Lorentz invariance===
Examples of other experiments not based on the Michelson–Morley principle, i.e., non-optical isotropy tests achieving an even higher level of precision, are Clock comparison or Hughes–Drever experiments. In Drever&#x27;s 1961 experiment, 7Li nuclei in the ground state, which has total angular momentum &quot;J&quot; = 3/2, were split into four equally spaced levels by a magnetic field. Each transition between a pair of adjacent levels should emit a photon of equal frequency, resulting in a single, sharp spectral line. However, since the nuclear wave functions for different &quot;MJ&quot; have different orientations in space relative to the magnetic field, any orientation dependence, whether from an aether wind or from a dependence on the large-scale distribution of mass in space (see Mach&#x27;s principle), would perturb the energy spacings between the four levels, resulting in an anomalous broadening or splitting of the line. No such broadening was observed. Modern repeats of this kind of experiment have provided some of the most accurate confirmations of the principle of Lorentz invariance.

<text>German submarine &quot;U-862 was a [[Type IX U-boat|Type IXD2]] [[U-boat]] of [[Nazi Germany]]&#x27;s &quot;[[Kriegsmarine]]&quot; during [[World War II]]. After Germany&#x27;s surrender in May 1945, &quot;U-862&quot; put into [[Singapore]] and was taken over by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] under the name I-502&quot;.

&quot;U-862&quot; was laid down on 15 August 1942 by DeSchiMAG AG Weser of Bremen. She was commissioned on 7 October 1943 with &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Heinrich Timm in command. Timm commanded &quot;U-862&quot; for her entire career in &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and received a promotion to &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; on 1 July 1944. &quot;U-862&quot; conducted two patrols, sinking seven ships totalling .

==Design==
German Type IXD2 submarines were considerably larger than the original Type IXs. &quot;U-862&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines plus two MWM RS34.5S six-cylinder four-stroke diesel engines for cruising, producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-862&quot; was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 24 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 150 rounds, and a Flak M42 with 2575 rounds as well as two C/30 anti-aircraft guns with 8100 rounds. The boat had a complement of fifty-five.

==Service history==

===First patrol===
&quot;U-862&quot; was one of the most travelled of all U-boats. She sailed from Germany in May 1944 and eventually reached Penang, in Japanese-controlled Malaya, in September 1944. Penang was the base for the 33rd U-boat Flotilla, code-named &quot;Monsun Gruppe&quot; (&quot;Monsoon Group&quot;).

On the way there, she launched a T5/G7es &quot;Zaunkönig I&quot; acoustic homing torpedo at a tanker. The Zaunkönig came around full circle to home in on &quot;U-862&quot;. Only an emergency crash dive and staying silent saved the U-boat from her own torpedo. She also shot down an Allied Consolidated PBY Catalina aircraft H of No. 265 Squadron RAF on 20 August 1944 and then escaped an intense search for her. She sank several merchant ships in the Mozambique Channel between Africa and Madagascar.

===Second patrol===

&quot;U-862&quot; departed for her second war patrol from Batavia in the Japanese-occupied Netherlands East Indies in December 1944. She sailed down the west coast of Australia, across the Great Australian Bight, around the southern coast of Tasmania and then north towards Sydney where she sank the U.S.-registered Liberty ship on 25 December 1944. She then travelled around New Zealand and entered the port of Napier at night undetected. This has given birth to an urban legend in New Zealand, where it is said that the captain of &quot;U-862&quot; sent sailors ashore at night to steal fresh milk from a farm. This may arise from a joke made by Captain Timm to Air Vice Marshal Sir Rochford Hughes in the late 1950s. &quot;U862&quot;&#x27;s voyage to New Zealand was portrayed in a stage comedy &quot;U Boat Down Under&quot; which was written and directed by Peter Tait and performed at Downstage Theatre, Wellington from 27 July to 5 August 2006.

&quot;U-862&quot; then returned to the Indian Ocean. On 6 February 1945, about 1,520 km (820 nm) south-west of Fremantle, &quot;U-862&quot; sank the U.S.-registered Liberty ship, , which was loaded with mules bound for Burma.

&quot;U-862&quot; was also a trial boat for the FuMo 65 &quot;Hohentwiel&quot; radar system. This was cranked out of a casing on the port side of the conning tower and rose on a mast. The aerial was hand trained onto targets whilst the U-boat was on the surface. The radar had a range up to and was very effective where there was little risk from air attack on the U-boat.

===Transfer to Japan===
When Germany surrendered in May 1945, she put into Singapore and was taken over by the Imperial Japanese Navy. On 15 July 1945 she became the IJN submarine &quot;I-502&quot;. The &quot;I-502&quot; surrendered at Singapore in August 1945 and was scuttled in the Strait of Malacca at on 15 February 1946.

The German crew of &quot;U-862&quot; suffered no casualties, and some returned to Germany several years after the war. Others who were interned at Kinmel Camp, Bodelwyddan, North Wales, remained in Wales and settled in the neighbouring communities of Rhyl, Rhuddlan and Prestatyn, due to the risks of returning to the Soviet occupied areas of Germany after the war. Two of the crew are buried at the new cemetery at Rhuddlan, North Wales, on nearby plots.

<text>Julie Anne Miller (born Julie Griffin, July 12, 1956) is an American songwriter, singer, and recording artist living in Nashville, Tennessee. She married Buddy Miller in 1981. They sing and play on each other&#x27;s solo projects and have recorded several duet albums.

==Career==

===Recordings===
Julie Miller&#x27;s first professionally released recording was with the group &quot;Streetlight&quot; which consisted of Julie, Buddy Miller, and Ron Krueger. The self-titled album was released in 1983. Julie and Buddy wrote some songs for the LP, including the original version of &quot;Jesus in Your Eyes&quot; (later re-recorded for &quot;Orphans and Angels&quot;). &quot;How Could You Say No&quot; (written by Mickey Cates) was originally performed on this album and later included on Julie&#x27;s solo debut &quot;Meet Julie Miller&quot;.

A 1985 demo tape recorded by Julie listed eight songs, but contained eleven. Two of these songs were later included on &quot;Meet Julie Miller&quot;, but the remaining nine songs were not reissued. Songs on this tape include: &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need Anything Else&quot;, &quot;Mystery Love&quot; (Synth Pop Version), &quot;Love Is&quot;, &quot;I Look to You&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need&quot;, &quot;What Does it Take&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Be Ready&quot;, &quot;King of my Heart&quot; (not the same as that which appeared later on her first Myrrh release), &quot;My New Psychiatrist&quot; (Synth Pop Version with different lyrics), &quot;Debby Came Back&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Place&quot; (Synth Pop Version). Only one copy of this tape has seen circulation; it is unknown whether Julie used the tape to shop for a record label, or sold them at concerts.

Julie&#x27;s musical career initially took off after singer Sam Phillips forwarded her demo tape to friends at Myrrh Records. Myrrh signed Miller to a contract and released &quot;Meet Julie Miller&quot; (her first solo album) in 1990. This album included backing vocals from Shawn Colvin, Victoria Williams, Amy Grant, Kelly Willard and Russ Taff.

Miller&#x27;s second solo album &quot;He Walks Through Walls&quot; (1991) also included backing vocals from Colvin, Williams, Grant and Willard. Mark Heard and Reverend Dan Smith also contributed vocals. This album included the original version of the song &quot;Broken Things&quot;, which was later re-recorded. Her 1993 album &quot;Orphans and Angels&quot; included a duet with Emmylou Harris on &quot;All My Tears&quot;, which was written after the death of Mark Heard. Jazz vocalist Jimmy Scott also contributed vocals. Miller also covered Heard&#x27;s song &quot;Treasure of the Broken Land&quot;. Shawn Colvin once again contributed background vocals. The video of the song &quot;S.O.S.&quot; from this album was released to Christian TV.

Her fourth solo album &quot;Invisible Girl&quot; was released by Street Level Records. Julie covered The Williams Brothers song &quot;Can&#x27;t Cry Hard Enough&quot;. Victoria Williams, Mark Olson and the Electrics provided background vocals. In 1997, Julie Miller released &quot;Blue Pony&quot; (Hightone Records) which includes contributions from Emmylou Harris, Buddy Miller, and Valerie Carter. Her most recent solo album is &quot;Broken Things&quot; in 1999, which includes new versions of &quot;Broken Things&quot; and &quot;All My Tears&quot; as well as new songs &quot;I Know Why The River Runs,&quot; &quot;Orphan Train,&quot; &quot;Out in the Rain&quot; and &quot;I Still Cry.&quot; The song &quot;By way of Sorrow&quot; was a duet with Innocence Mission&#x27;s Karen Peris.

In 2001, the first Buddy and Julie Miller duo album &quot;Buddy &amp; Julie Miller&quot; was released in 2001. This album won the Americana Music Association award for best album in 2002. Released in 2002, &quot;Love Snuck Up&quot; was a compilation of the Millers&#x27; Hightone recordings. A Julie Miller compilation is planned, which will include tracks selected by Julie from her first four albums, which have been out of print for many years.

===Work with other artists===

In 1987 Julie contributed background vocals to the song &quot;Remember Me&quot; on Benny Hester&#x27;s album &quot;Through the Window&quot;. In 1992, Julie provided the title track for &quot;Cry of the Heart: Emily&#x27;s Eyes&quot;, an album released to bring hope to victims of child abuse. Julie mentioned after a 2002 concert in Kentucky that the song &quot;Emily&#x27;s Eyes&quot; had one line edited out of it, as there was concern regarding the &quot;implications&quot;. No further details were provided.

In 1994, Julie and Buddy Miller recorded Mark Heard&#x27;s &quot;Orphans of God&quot; which was the title track for the single CD Mark Heard Tribute album Strong Hand of Love. They also assisted Victoria Williams on her version of &quot;What Kind of Friend&quot;. Later that same year, both songs were included on the two-CD Mark Heard Tribute Orphans of God, with the song &quot;What kind of Friend&quot; expanded by nearly a full minute.

Julie&#x27;s composition, &quot;By Way of Sorrow,&quot; was an inspiration for the tone of Cameron Crowe&#x27;s movie &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; but the song was not featured in the film.

===Covers of Julie Miller songs===

<text>Steven Paul &quot;Buddy&quot; Miller (born September 6, 1952) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, recording artist and producer, currently living in Nashville, Tennessee. Miller is married to and has recorded with singer-songwriter Julie Miller.

== Early life and music career ==
Buddy was born in Fairborn, Ohio, near Dayton, and his family ended up settling in Princeton, New Jersey. His grandfather gave him the nickname &quot;Buddy.&quot;

During the late 1970s he was in a country-rock band called the Desperate Men, which played in the NNJ and New York area, including clubs like Stanhope House, Cuss From Hoe and others. In 1975, he moved to Austin, Texas and played rockabilly music in Ray Campi&#x27;s band. He auditioned for and played in the band Partners In Crime with Julie Griffin (soon to be his second wife).

In 1980, they moved to New York City, and Miller formed the Buddy Miller Band, which included singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin on vocals and guitar. He also performed with Jim Lauderdale and Larry Campbell. Each Sunday, Miller performed in Kinky Friedman&#x27;s band at the Lone Star Cafe.

Miller moved to Nashville in the 1990s, after a stint in Los Angeles. He worked on recording sessions as a guitar player and vocalist, and began producing his own records in his living room studio named Dogtown.

== Recordings ==
In 1995, Buddy along with the Sacred Cows recorded a gospel album, &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;.

His first solo recording, &quot;Your Love and Other Lies&quot;, was released in 1995. It was followed by &quot;Poison Love&quot; in 1997 and &quot;Cruel Moon&quot; in 1999.

He and his wife, Julie Miller, released &quot;Buddy &amp; Julie Miller&quot; in 2001, which won the Album of the Year Award from the Americana Music Association.

In 2002, he released &quot;Midnight and Lonesome&quot; and in 2004 he released &quot;Universal United House of Prayer&quot;.

2009 brought another Buddy and Julie duet album &quot;Written in Chalk&quot; and in 2011 Buddy collaborated with Bill Frisell, Marc Ribot, and Greg Leisz to release &quot;The Majestic Silver Strings&quot;.

While on that tour, following a performance in Baltimore on February 19, 2009, Miller suffered a heart attack. He underwent successful triple bypass surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital on February 20.

In 2010, Miller again joined Robert Plant and Patty Griffin with Plant&#x27;s Band of Joy, touring the U.S. and Europe.

For the past decade, Buddy has often been a part of the Cayamo Cruise, which sails from Miami to St. Maarten and Tortola. Each year, prominent Americana musicians are on board, and Buddy often collaborates and records with them.

Buddy frequently uses vintage Wandré electric guitars and TEO mando-guitars.

In his studio, Buddy uses a pair of Swart amplifiers: Atomic Space Tones and Atomic Space Tone Pros, and two tremolos panned in stereo at conflicting settings. Onstage, he often uses a Swart Atomic Space Tones amplifier and a Fulltone Supa-Trem2 pedal.

He mostly records using Pro Tools, but in his recording studio Buddy treasures a 1970s Trident B Range 28×24 analog recording console that previously belonged to Mark Heard.

==Life and career==

From 1976 to 1978, Madeira was a member of the Phil Keaggy Band, with Lynn Nichols, Terry Andersen and Dan Cunningham. The Ithaca, New York-based band released one album together, entitled &quot;Emerging&quot;. The band broke up in 1978 and Madeira relocated to Nashville in 1983 where he worked as a sideman and a songwriter, making solo records independently.

In 2008, Madeira joined Emmylou Harris&#x27;s band &quot;The Red Dirt Boys&quot;.

In 2012, Madeira provided the musical backdrop for Merrill Farnsworth&#x27;s theatrical piece &quot;Jezebel&#x27;s Got The Blues... and Other Works of Imagination&quot;. Madeira produced a collection of Americana musicians covering Paul McCartney songs on &quot;Let Us In: Americana&quot;, a benefit for The Women and Cancer Fund. In the same year, Madeira completed production on &quot;Mercyland: Hymns For The Rest Of Us&quot; which features Emmylou Harris, The Civil Wars, Mat Kearney, Dan Tyminski, Cindy Morgan, John Scofield, the Carolina Chocolate Drops, Buddy Miller, and Shawn Mullins, North Mississippi Allstars, Amy Stroup, and Phil Madeira.

In 2013, Madeira released &quot;PM&quot;, his first solo album in 15 years. Madeira released his first book, &quot;God on the Rocks: Distilling Religion, Savoring Faith&quot; in June 2013, published by Jericho Books. Later in 2013, Madeira and occasional production partner Lynn Nichols produced the major-label debut of Pawnshop Kings, a brother duo from Southern California. Madeira appeared with Neil Young, Sheryl Crow, Leon Russell, and Jack White on CMT&#x27;s Willie Nelson&#x27;s 80th Birthday Party, hosted by CMT network.

The year 2014 marked the release of Humming People&#x27;s &quot;City of Lost Men&quot;, produced in Norway by Madeira, leading to a long-standing relationship with the band. Madeira&#x27;s song &quot;From This Valley&quot; (co-written and recorded by The Civil Wars) won the Grammy for Best Country Performance by a Duo in 2014.

Madeira commenced work on a follow-up to his &quot;Mercyland&quot; project in the summer of 2014. &quot;Mercyland: Hymns For The Rest Of Us, Vol II&quot; was released on Mercyland Records in 2016. And in 2015, Madeira finished two solo projects, &quot;Motorcycle&quot; and &quot;Soul Of A Man&quot;. 

Madeira produced &quot;Treasure of the Broken Land: The Songs of Mark Heard&quot; featuring Red Dirt Boys, Rodney Crowell, Buddy Miller, The North Mississippi Allstars, Amy Speace, Willie Sugarcapps, and others. It was released in 2017.

In 2016, Madeira wrote the liner notes for John Scofield&#x27;s Grammy winning &quot;Country For Old Men&quot;. In 2017, Madeira produced several records for indie artists including Sammy Horner and The Sweet Sorrows, and The Mosleys. Madeira and the other members of The Red Dirt Boys joined Emmylou Harris again for a tour with John Mellencamp.

In April 2018, Madeira release the album &quot;Providence&quot; featuring Madeira on piano and vocals, Chris Donohue on upright bass, and Bryan Owings on drums. Recorded at Nashville&#x27;s Sound Emporium, the jazz/blues/Americana outing included guest guitarists Will Kimbrough, James Hollihan, and John Scofield.

In 2019, Phil Madeira released the &quot;Open Heart&quot; album, along with a single &quot;Remember Me&quot;. The single received critical acclaim from Rolling Stone who called the piece a poignant yet optimistic New Orleans jazz-inspired tribute to Madeira&#x27;s late partner.

Madeira appeared as a member of The Ascendants on their 2023 Kickstarter album along with Jimmy Abegg, Steve Hindalong, Matt Slocum and Ben Pearson.

<text>Doubling the cube, also known as the Delian problem, is an ancient geometric problem. Given the edge of a cube, the problem requires the construction of the edge of a second cube whose volume is double that of the first. As with the related problems of squaring the circle and trisecting the angle, doubling the cube is now known to be impossible to construct by using only a compass and straightedge, but even in ancient times solutions were known that employed other methods.

According to Eutocius, Archytas was the first to solve the problem of doubling the cube (the so-called Delian problem) with an ingenious geometric construction. The nonexistence of a compass-and-straightedge solution was finally proven by Pierre Wantzel in 1837.

In algebraic terms, doubling a unit cube requires the construction of a line segment of length , where ; in other words, , the cube root of two. This is because a cube of side length 1 has a volume of , and a cube of twice that volume (a volume of 2) has a side length of the cube root of 2. The impossibility of doubling the cube is therefore equivalent to the statement that formula_1 is not a constructible number. This is a consequence of the fact that the coordinates of a new point constructed by a compass and straightedge are roots of polynomials over the field generated by the coordinates of previous points, of no greater degree than a quadratic. This implies that the degree of the field extension generated by a constructible point must be a power of 2. The field extension generated by formula_1, however, is of degree 3.

==Proof of impossibility==
We begin with the unit line segment defined by points (0,0) and (1,0) in the plane. We are required to construct a line segment defined by two points separated by a distance of formula_1. It is easily shown that compass and straightedge constructions would allow such a line segment to be freely moved to touch the origin, parallel with the unit line segment - so equivalently we may consider the task of constructing a line segment from (0,0) to (formula_1, 0), which entails constructing the point (formula_1, 0).

Respectively, the tools of a compass and straightedge allow us to create circles centred on one previously defined point and passing through another, and to create lines passing through two previously defined points. Any newly defined point either arises as the result of the intersection of two such circles, as the intersection of a circle and a line, or as the intersection of two lines. An exercise of elementary analytic geometry shows that in all three cases, both the - and -coordinates of the newly defined point satisfy a polynomial of degree no higher than a quadratic, with coefficients that are additions, subtractions, multiplications, and divisions involving the coordinates of the previously defined points (and rational numbers). Restated in more abstract terminology, the new - and -coordinates have minimal polynomials of degree at most 2 over the subfield of generated by the previous coordinates. Therefore, the degree of the field extension corresponding to each new coordinate is 2 or 1.

So, given a coordinate of any constructed point, we may proceed inductively backwards through the - and -coordinates of the points in the order that they were defined until we reach the original pair of points (0,0) and (1,0). As every field extension has degree 2 or 1, and as the field extension over formula_6 of the coordinates of the original pair of points is clearly of degree 1, it follows from the tower rule that the degree of the field extension over formula_6 of any coordinate of a constructed point is a power of 2.

Now, is easily seen to be irreducible over formula_8 – any factorisation would involve a linear factor for some , and so must be a root of ; but also must divide 2 (by the rational root theorem); that is, or , and none of these are roots of . By Gauss&#x27;s Lemma, is also irreducible over formula_6, and is thus a minimal polynomial over formula_6 for formula_1. The field extension formula_12 is therefore of degree 3. But this is not a power of 2, so by the above:
*formula_1 is not the coordinate of a constructible point, so
*a line segment of formula_1 cannot be constructed with ruler and compass, and
*the cube cannot be doubled using only a ruler and a compass.

==History==
The problem owes its name to a story concerning the citizens of Delos, who consulted the oracle at Delphi in order to learn how to defeat a plague sent by Apollo. According to Plutarch, however, the citizens of Delos consulted the oracle at Delphi to find a solution for their internal political problems at the time, which had intensified relationships among the citizens. The oracle responded that they must double the size of the altar to Apollo, which was a regular cube. The answer seemed strange to the Delians, and they consulted Plato, who was able to interpret the oracle as the mathematical problem of doubling the volume of a given cube, thus explaining the oracle as the advice of Apollo for the citizens of Delos to occupy themselves with the study of geometry and mathematics in order to calm down their passions.

According to Plutarch, Plato gave the problem to Eudoxus and Archytas and Menaechmus, who solved the problem using mechanical means, earning a rebuke from Plato for not solving the problem using pure geometry. This may be why the problem is referred to in the 350s BC by the author of the pseudo-Platonic &quot;Sisyphus&quot; (388e) as still unsolved. However another version of the story (attributed to Eratosthenes by Eutocius of Ascalon) says that all three found solutions but they were too abstract to be of practical value.

A significant development in finding a solution to the problem was the discovery by Hippocrates of Chios that it is equivalent to finding two geometric mean proportionals between a line segment and another with twice the length. In modern notation, this means that given segments of lengths and , the duplication of the cube is equivalent to finding segments of lengths and so that
:formula_15

In turn, this means that
:formula_16
But Pierre Wantzel proved in 1837 that the cube root of 2 is not constructible; that is, it cannot be constructed with straightedge and compass.

==Solutions via means other than compass and straightedge==
Menaechmus&#x27; original solution involves the intersection of two conic curves. Other more complicated methods of doubling the cube involve neusis, the cissoid of Diocles, the conchoid of Nicomedes, or the Philo line. Pandrosion, a probably female mathematician of ancient Greece, found a numerically accurate approximate solution using planes in three dimensions, but was heavily criticized by Pappus of Alexandria for not providing a proper mathematical proof. Archytas solved the problem in the 4th century BC using geometric construction in three dimensions, determining a certain point as the intersection of three surfaces of revolution.

Descartes theory of geometric solution of equations uses a parabola to introduce cubic equations, in this way it is possible to set up an equation whose solution is a cube root of two. Note that the parabola itself is not constructible except by three dimensional methods.

False claims of doubling the cube with compass and straightedge abound in mathematical crank literature (pseudomathematics).

Origami may also be used to construct the cube root of two by folding paper.

===Using a marked ruler===

There is a simple neusis construction using a marked ruler for a length which is the cube root of 2 times another length.

#Mark a ruler with the given length; this will eventually be GH.
#Construct an equilateral triangle ABC with the given length as side.
#Extend AB an equal amount again to D.
#Extend the line BC forming the line CE.
#Extend the line DC forming the line CF.
#Place the marked ruler so it goes through A and one end, G, of the marked length falls on ray CF and the other end of the marked length, H, falls on ray CE. Thus GH is the given length.

Then AG is the given length times formula_1.

==In music theory==
In music theory, a natural analogue of doubling is the octave (a musical interval caused by doubling the frequency of a tone), and a natural analogue of a cube is dividing the octave into three parts, each the same interval. In this sense, the problem of doubling the cube is solved by the major third in equal temperament. This is a musical interval that is exactly one third of an octave. It multiplies the frequency of a tone by formula_18, the side length of the Delian cube.

<doc id="91111" wikidata="Q733081" url="?curid=91111" title="Angle trisection">
<text>Angle trisection is a classical problem of straightedge and compass construction of ancient Greek mathematics. It concerns construction of an angle equal to one third of a given arbitrary angle, using only two tools: an unmarked straightedge and a compass.

In 1837, Pierre Wantzel proved that the problem, as stated, is impossible to solve for arbitrary angles. However, some special angles can be trisected: for example, it is trivial to trisect a right angle.

It is possible to trisect an arbitrary angle by using tools other than straightedge and compass. For example, neusis construction, also known to ancient Greeks, involves simultaneous sliding and rotation of a marked straightedge, which cannot be achieved with the original tools. Other techniques were developed by mathematicians over the centuries.

Because it is defined in simple terms, but complex to prove unsolvable, the problem of angle trisection is a frequent subject of pseudomathematical attempts at solution by naive enthusiasts. These &quot;solutions&quot; often involve mistaken interpretations of the rules, or are simply incorrect.

==Background and problem statement==

Using only an unmarked straightedge and a compass, Greek mathematicians found means to divide a line into an arbitrary set of equal segments, to draw parallel lines, to bisect angles, to construct many polygons, and to construct squares of equal or twice the area of a given polygon.

Three problems proved elusive, specifically, trisecting the angle, doubling the cube, and squaring the circle. The problem of angle trisection reads:

Construct an angle equal to one-third of a given arbitrary angle (or divide it into three equal angles), using only two tools:
# an unmarked straightedge, and
# a compass.

== Proof of impossibility ==
Pierre Wantzel published a proof of the impossibility of classically trisecting an arbitrary angle in 1837. Wantzel&#x27;s proof, restated in modern terminology, uses the concept of field extensions, a topic now typically combined with Galois theory. However, Wantzel published these results earlier than Évariste Galois (whose work, written in 1830, was published only in 1846) and did not use the concepts introduced by Galois.

The problem of constructing an angle of a given measure is equivalent to constructing two segments such that the ratio of their length is . From a solution to one of these two problems, one may pass to a solution of the other by a compass and straightedge construction. The triple-angle formula gives an expression relating the cosines of the original angle and its trisection:  = .

It follows that, given a segment that is defined to have unit length, the problem of angle trisection is equivalent to constructing a segment whose length is the root of a cubic polynomial. This equivalence reduces the original geometric problem to a purely algebraic problem.

Every rational number is constructible. Every irrational number that is constructible in a single step from some given numbers is a root of a polynomial of degree 2 with coefficients in the field generated by these numbers. Therefore, any number that is constructible by a sequence of steps is a root of a minimal polynomial whose degree is a power of two. The angle radians (60 degrees, written 60°) is constructible. The argument below shows that it is impossible to construct a 20° angle. This implies that a 60° angle cannot be trisected, and thus that an arbitrary angle cannot be trisected.

Denote the set of rational numbers by . If 60° could be trisected, the degree of a minimal polynomial of over would be a power of two. Now let . Note that = = . Then by the triple-angle formula, and so . Thus . Define to be the polynomial .

Since is a root of , the minimal polynomial for is a factor of . Because has degree 3, if it is reducible over by then it has a rational root. By the rational root theorem, this root must be or , but none of these is a root. Therefore, is irreducible over by , and the minimal polynomial for is of degree .

So an angle of measure cannot be trisected.

== Angles which can be trisected ==
However, some angles can be trisected. For example, for any constructible angle , an angle of measure can be trivially trisected by ignoring the given angle and directly constructing an angle of measure . There are angles that are not constructible but are trisectible (despite the one-third angle itself being non-constructible). For example, is such an angle: five angles of measure combine to make an angle of measure , which is a full circle plus the desired .

For a positive integer , an angle of measure is &quot;trisectible&quot; if and only if does not divide . In contrast, is &quot;constructible&quot; if and only if is a power of or the product of a power of with the product of one or more distinct Fermat primes.

===Algebraic characterization===
Again, denote the set of rational numbers by .

Theorem: An angle of measure may be trisected if and only if is reducible over the field extension .

The proof is a relatively straightforward generalization of the proof given above that a angle is not trisectible.

===Other numbers of parts===
For any nonzero integer , an angle of measure radians can be divided into equal parts with straightedge and compass if and only if is either a power of or is a power of multiplied by the product of one or more distinct Fermat primes, none of which divides . In the case of trisection (, which is a Fermat prime), this condition becomes the above-mentioned requirement that not be divisible by .

==Other methods==
The general problem of angle trisection is solvable by using additional tools, and thus going outside of the original Greek framework of compass and straightedge.

Many incorrect methods of trisecting the general angle have been proposed. Some of these methods provide reasonable approximations; others (some of which are mentioned below) involve tools not permitted in the classical problem. The mathematician Underwood Dudley has detailed some of these failed attempts in his book &quot;The Trisectors&quot;.

===Approximation by successive bisections===
Trisection can be approximated by repetition of the compass and straightedge method for bisecting an angle. The geometric series or can be used as a basis for the bisections. An approximation to any degree of accuracy can be obtained in a finite number of steps.

===Using origami===

Trisection, like many constructions impossible by ruler and compass, can easily be accomplished by the operations of paper folding, or origami. Huzita&#x27;s axioms (types of folding operations) can construct cubic extensions (cube roots) of given lengths, whereas ruler-and-compass can construct only quadratic extensions (square roots).

===Using a linkage===

There are a number of simple linkages which can be used to make an instrument to trisect angles including Kempe&#x27;s Trisector and Sylvester&#x27;s Link Fan or Isoklinostat.

===With a right triangular ruler ===
In 1932, Ludwig Bieberbach published in &quot;Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik&quot; his work &quot;Zur Lehre von den kubischen Konstruktionen&quot;. He states therein (free translation):

:&quot;As is known ... every cubic construction can be traced back to the trisection of the angle and to the multiplication of the cube, that is, the extraction of the third root. I need only to show how these two classical tasks can be solved by means of the right angle hook.&quot;

The construction begins with drawing a circle passing through the vertex of the angle to be trisected, centered at on an edge of this angle, and having as its second intersection with the edge. A circle centered at and of the same radius intersects the line supporting the edge in and .

Now the &quot;right triangular ruler&quot; is placed on the drawing in the following manner: one leg of its right angle passes through ; the vertex of its right angle is placed at a point on the line in such a way that the second leg of the ruler is tangent at to the circle centered at . It follows that the original angle is trisected by the line , and the line perpendicular to and passing through . This line can be drawn either by using again the right triangular ruler, or by using a traditional straightedge and compass construction. With a similar construction, one can improve the location of , by using that it is the intersection of the line and its perpendicular passing through .

&quot;Proof:&quot; One has to prove the angle equalities formula_1 and formula_2 The three lines , , and are parallel. As the line segments and are equal, these three parallel lines delimit two equal segments on every other secant line, and in particular on their common perpendicular . Thus , where is the intersection of the lines and . It follows that the right triangles and are congruent, and thus that formula_3 the first desired equality. On the other hand, the triangle is isosceles, since all radiuses of a circle are equal; this implies that formula_4 One has also formula_5 since these two angles are alternate angles of a transversal to two parallel lines. This proves the second desired equality, and thus the correctness of the construction.

===With an auxiliary curve===
There are certain curves called trisectrices which, if drawn on the plane using other methods, can be used to trisect arbitrary angles. Examples include the trisectrix of Colin Maclaurin, given in Cartesian coordinates by the implicit equation
:formula_6
and the Archimedean spiral. The spiral can, in fact, be used to divide an angle into &quot;any&quot; number of equal parts.
Archimedes described how to trisect an angle using the Archimedean spiral in On Spirals around 225 BC.

===With a marked ruler===
Another means to trisect an arbitrary angle by a &quot;small&quot; step outside the Greek framework is via a ruler with two marks a set distance apart. The next construction is originally due to Archimedes, called a &quot;Neusis construction&quot;, i.e., that uses tools other than an &quot;un-marked&quot; straightedge. The diagrams we use show this construction for an acute angle, but it indeed works for any angle up to 180 degrees.

This requires three facts from geometry (at right):
# Any full set of angles on a straight line add to 180°,
# The sum of angles of any triangle is 180°, &quot;and&quot;,
# Any two equal sides of an isosceles triangle will meet the third side at the same angle.
Let be the horizontal line in the adjacent diagram. Angle (left of point ) is the subject of trisection. First, a point is drawn at an angle&#x27;s ray, one unit apart from . A circle of radius is drawn. Then, the markedness of the ruler comes into play: one mark of the ruler is placed at and the other at . While keeping the ruler (but not the mark) touching , the ruler is slid and rotated until one mark is on the circle and the other is on the line . The mark on the circle is labeled and the mark on the line is labeled . This ensures that . A radius is drawn to make it obvious that line segments , , and all have equal length. Now, triangles and are isosceles, thus (by Fact 3 above) each has two equal angles.

Hypothesis: Given is a straight line, and , , and all have equal length,

Conclusion: angle .

Proof:
# From Fact 1) above, formula_7°.
# Looking at triangle &quot;BCD&quot;, from Fact 2) formula_8°.
# From the last two equations, formula_9.
# Therefore, formula_10.

and the theorem is proved.

Again, this construction stepped outside the framework of allowed constructions by using a marked straightedge.

===With a string===
Thomas Hutcheson published an article in the &quot;Mathematics Teacher&quot; that used a string instead of a compass and straight edge. A string can be used as either a straight edge (by stretching it) or a compass (by fixing one point and identifying another), but can also wrap around a cylinder, the key to Hutcheson&#x27;s solution.

Hutcheson constructed a cylinder from the angle to be trisected by drawing an arc across the angle, completing it as a circle, and constructing from that circle a cylinder on which a, say, equilateral triangle was inscribed (a 360-degree angle divided in three). This was then &quot;mapped&quot; onto the angle to be trisected, with a simple proof of similar triangles.

===With a &quot;tomahawk&quot;===

A &quot;tomahawk&quot; is a geometric shape consisting of a semicircle and two orthogonal line segments, such that the length of the shorter segment is equal to the circle radius. Trisection is executed by leaning the end of the tomahawk&#x27;s shorter segment on one ray, the circle&#x27;s edge on the other, so that the &quot;handle&quot; (longer segment) crosses the angle&#x27;s vertex; the trisection line runs between the vertex and the center of the semicircle.

While a tomahawk is constructible with compass and straightedge, it is not generally possible to construct a tomahawk in any desired position. Thus, the above construction does not contradict the nontrisectibility of angles with ruler and compass alone.

As a tomahawk can be used as a set square, it can be also used for trisection angles by the method described in .

The tomahawk produces the same geometric effect as the paper-folding method: the distance between circle center and the tip of the shorter segment is twice the distance of the radius, which is guaranteed to contact the angle. It is also equivalent to the use of an architects L-Ruler (Carpenter&#x27;s Square).

===With interconnected compasses===

An angle can be trisected with a device that is essentially a four-pronged version of a compass, with linkages between the prongs designed to keep the three angles between adjacent prongs equal.

==Uses of angle trisection==

A cubic equation with real coefficients can be solved geometrically with compass, straightedge, and an angle trisector if and only if it has three real roots.

A regular polygon with &quot;n&quot; sides can be constructed with ruler, compass, and angle trisector if and only if formula_11 where &quot;r, s, k&quot; ≥ 0 and where the &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; are distinct primes greater than 3 of the form formula_12 (i.e. Pierpont primes greater than 3).

<text>John Mark Heard III (December 16, 1951 – August 16, 1992) was an American record producer, folk rock singer and songwriter from Macon, Georgia.

Heard released sixteen albums, and produced or performed with many artists, including: Sam Phillips (aka Leslie Phillips), Pierce Pettis, Phil Keaggy, Vigilantes of Love, Peter Buck of R.E.M. (who co-produced VOL&#x27;s album &quot;Killing Floor&quot; with Heard), The Choir, Randy Stonehill and Michael Been of The Call. Heard produced part of Olivia Newton-John&#x27;s &quot;The Rumour&quot; (1988), which also included a cover of Heard&#x27;s own &quot;Big and Strong&quot; (originally called &quot;How to Grow Up Big and Strong&quot;).

== Early life and music career ==
Heard&#x27;s first appearance on record was with his early Jesus music band Infinity+3, who released the album &quot;Setting Yesterday Free&quot; in 1970. He went solo in 1972. After graduating from the University of Georgia in 1974 with an ABJ (bachelor of arts in journalism) degree in television, Heard traveled to Switzerland to study at L&#x27;Abri under the influential evangelical Christian philosopher Francis Schaeffer. Singers Larry Norman and Randy Stonehill stumbled onto Mark one day playing his guitar. Because Norman and Stonehill expressed interest, Heard spent most of his spare time the next two months putting together a demo tape in a local studio with the help of the Pat Terry group (Pat Terry, Sonny Lallerstedt and Randy Bugg). Norman was so impressed by Heard&#x27;s abilities that he soon signed him to his record label, Solid Rock Records. In 1977, Heard and his wife Janet moved to Glendale, California. He begin working on his &quot;Appalachian Melody&quot; album for the label, but would also maintain a close relationship with the people at the L&#x27;Abri for years. In 1980, Heard recorded and released &quot;Fingerprint&quot; on a Swiss label.

In 1981, Heard began a recording contract with Chris Christian&#x27;s Home Sweet Home Records. Although Heard&#x27;s sales did not attract attention from the major Christian labels, Christian felt Mark&#x27;s music was unique, fresh and deserved to be heard. Christian funded his projects with no production oversight, which is what Heard wanted. His signing to the label was a departure from the commercial artists that Christian traditionally signed and produced on the Home Sweet Home label. Heard released five albums for the label: 1981&#x27;s &quot;Stop the Dominoes&quot;, 1982&#x27;s &quot;Victims of the Age&quot;, 1983&#x27;s &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot;, 1984&#x27;s &quot;Ashes and Light&quot; and 1985&#x27;s &quot;Mosaics&quot;. The overall experience was not one that Heard enjoyed, partly due to his personal experiences with record company executives, and partly due to compromises he felt under pressure to make himself so that his songs were more marketable to Christian audiences.

In 1984, Heard began recording in his home studio, which he dubbed &quot;Fingerprint Recorders&quot;, after the title of one of his earlier records. From that point on, his albums were largely made at home, with just a handful of friends and relatives lending a hand. In 1986, Heard decided to try something a little different and recorded the experimental Pop/Rock album for What? Records entitled &quot;Tribal Opera&quot;, under the name iDEoLA. When asked about the unusual name, Heard replied &quot;It&#x27;s not supposed to be mysterious or anything; I just put a band together and right now I happen to be the only one in it.&quot; Heard also directed a music video for the single of that album, &quot;Is It Any Wonder&quot;.

With assistance from Dan Russell and Chuck Long, Fingerprint Records and studio were born. Heard began to produce albums for a number of artists including two albums for Randy Stonehill, Jacob&#x27;s Trouble, Pierce Pettis and 1992&#x27;s Vigilantes of Love album, &quot;Killing Floor&quot;, which he co-produced with R.E.M.&#x27;s Peter Buck. Stonehill&#x27;s &quot;Until We Have Wings&quot; includes a song co-written by Heard, &quot;Faithful&quot;, although the CD liner notes credit the song to Heard&#x27;s pseudonym, &quot;Giovanni Audiori&quot;. In 1988, Heard collaborated with Randy Stonehill and other well known artists on &quot;Phil Keaggy and Sunday&#x27;s Child&quot;. In addition to writing and performing credits, he helped with the engineering.

Heard returned to recording albums of his own in the early 1990s, with &quot;Dry Bones Dance&quot;. Fans and reviewers alike hailed the new release as one of the best of his career. He followed &quot;Dry Bones Dance&quot; with &quot;Second Hand&quot; in 1991, and &quot;Satellite Sky&quot; in 1992, which would turn out to be his final release.

== Death ==
On July 4, 1992, Heard had a heart attack on stage while performing with Pierce Pettis and Kate Miner, at the Cornerstone Festival in Bushnell, IL, near Peoria. Heard finished his set and went to the hospital immediately afterwards. Two weeks after being released from the hospital, Heard went into cardiac arrest and died on August 16, 1992. Before Heard&#x27;s death, he had been included on the &quot;&quot; sampler from Windham Hill&#x27;s High Street label, and was nearly finalizing a mainstream contract with Bruce Cockburn&#x27;s label, True North Records in Canada. There was also interest from Sony&#x27;s Columbia Records label for distribution in the US.

== Tributes and influence ==
In 1993, Rich Mullins covered &quot;How to Grow Up Big and Strong&quot; on his &quot;A Liturgy, a Legacy, &amp; a Ragamuffin Band&quot;. In 1994, many artists came together to record a tribute album called &quot;Strong Hand of Love&quot;. Artists lending their talents to the project included Phil Keaggy, Randy Stonehill, Victoria Williams, Chagall Guevara, Buddy Miller, Julie Miller, Daniel Amos, The Choir and Bruce Cockburn. The project was later reissued as a double album set with additional tracks and re-titled &quot;Orphans of God&quot;. Cockburn frequently called Heard his favorite songwriter. He wrote and recorded a song dedicated to Heard for his &quot;Dart to the Heart&quot; album, &quot;Closer to the Light&quot;. Daniel Amos dedicated their album &quot;MotorCycle&quot; to Heard in 1993, and The Swirling Eddies dedicated &quot;Zoom Daddy&quot; to Heard the same year. Julie Miller also wrote a song in tribute to Heard called &quot;All My Tears&quot; which has also been recorded by Jars of Clay, Emmylou Harris (studio and live versions) and Selah with Kim Hill on &quot;Bless the Broken Road: The Duets Album&quot;.

In 2000, a group of fans gathered together to help Fingerprint Records release &quot;Mystery Mind&quot;, the first collection of previously unreleased material from the songwriter. There were plans to release a full length collection that same year, but those plans never came to fruition.

In 2002, the Cornerstone Music Festival held a songwriting contest in honor of Heard. The following year, &quot;Paste&quot; magazine released &quot;Hammers and Nails&quot;, a CD of previously unreleased recordings by Heard. An authorized biography of the same name was also released by Cornerstone Press, written by Matthew T. Dickerson.

In September 2005, the Americana Music Association held its annual Americana Music Honors &amp; Awards at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee. The Song of the Year Award was presented to Mark Heard for &quot;Worry Too Much&quot;, originally featured on &quot;Second Hand&quot;. Buddy Miller, who performed the track on &quot;Universal United House of Prayer&quot;, accepted the award on behalf of Heard. Miller also received the Album of the Year Award for &quot;Universal United House of Prayer&quot;.

In a June/July 2006 &quot;Paste&quot; magazine article (from the special collector&#x27;s issue featuring the 100 Best Living Songwriters), Heard was remembered under the heading &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;: &quot;Mark Heard&#x27;s lyrics are weighted with such a wry longing that they&#x27;ll forever reflect a fresh turbulence.&quot;

Pierce Pettis and Ralston Bowles have covered a song by Mark Heard on each of their albums released since Heard&#x27;s death.

In 2017, an 18-song retrospective, &quot;Mark Heard: Treasure of the Broken Land&quot;, was released. It focuses on Heard&#x27;s last three albums and features Rodney Crowell, Buddy Miller, Over the Rhine and others. Produced by Phil Madeira (a member of Emmylou Harris&#x27; backing band Red Dirt Boys), the album received notable attention from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, and Americana music magazine &quot;No Depression&quot;.

<text>Samuel Cornelius Phillips (January 5, 1923 – July 30, 2003) was an American disc jockey, songwriter and record producer. He was the founder of Sun Records and Sun Studio in Memphis, Tennessee, where he produced recordings by Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Howlin&#x27; Wolf. Phillips played a major role in the development of rock and roll during the 1950s, launching the career of Presley. In 1969, he sold Sun to Shelby Singleton.

Phillips was the owner and operator of radio stations in Memphis; Florence, Alabama; and Lake Worth Beach, Florida. He was also an early investor in the Holiday Inn chain of hotels and an advocate for racial equality, helping to break down racial barriers in the music industry.

==Early life==
Phillips was the youngest of eight children, born on a 200-acre farm near Florence, Alabama to Madge Ella ( Lovelace) and Charles Tucker Phillips. Sam&#x27;s parents owned their farm, though it was mortgaged. As a child, he picked cotton in the fields with his parents alongside black laborers. The experience of hearing black laborers singing in the fields left a big impression on the young Phillips. Traveling through Memphis with his family in 1939 on the way to see a preacher in Dallas, he slipped off to look at Beale Street, at the time the heart of the city&#x27;s music scene. &quot;I just fell totally in love,&quot; he later recalled.

Phillips attended the now defunct Coffee High School in Florence. He conducted the school band and had ambitions to be a criminal defense attorney. However, his father was bankrupt by the Great Depression and died in 1941, forcing Phillips to leave high school to look after his mother and aunt. To support the family he worked in a grocery store and then a funeral parlor.

In 1942, Sam, 19, met Rebecca &quot;Becky&quot; Burns, 17, his future wife, while they were both working at WLAY radio station in Sheffield, Alabama. He was an announcer and she was still in high school and had a radio segment with her sister as &#x27;The Kitchen Sisters&#x27; where they played music and sang. A January 18, 2013, article in the Alabama Chanin Journal honoring Becky quoted Sam as saying, &quot;I fell in love with Becky&#x27;s voice even before I met her.&quot; Becky described her first encounter with Sam to journalist Peter Guralnick: &quot;He had just come in out of the rain. His hair was windblown and full of raindrops. He wore sandals and a smile unlike any I had ever seen. He sat down on the piano bench and began to talk to me. I told my family that night that I had met the man I wanted to marry.&quot; They wed in 1943 and went on to have two children in a marriage that ended in 1960. Becky Phillips died in 2012, aged 87.

==The Memphis Recording Service and Sun Records==

In the 1940s, Phillips worked as a DJ and radio engineer for station WLAY (AM), in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. According to Phillips, the station&#x27;s &quot;open format&quot; (of broadcasting music by white and black musicians alike) would later inspire his work in Memphis. Beginning in 1945, he worked for four years as an announcer and sound engineer for radio station WREC, in Memphis.

On January 3, 1950, Phillips opened the Memphis Recording Service, at 706 Union Avenue in Memphis. He let amateurs record, which drew performers such as B. B. King, Junior Parker, and Howlin&#x27; Wolf, who made their first recordings there. Phillips then sold the recordings to larger labels.

Phillips recorded what the music historian Peter Guralnick considered the first rock and roll record: &quot;Rocket 88&quot;, by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats, a band led by the 19-year-old Ike Turner, who also wrote the song. The recording was released in 1951 by Chess Records in Chicago. From 1950 to 1954 Phillips recorded music by James Cotton, Rufus Thomas, Rosco Gordon, Little Milton, Bobby Blue Bland, the Prisonaires and others.

The Memphis Recording Service also served as the studio for Phillips&#x27;s own label, Sun Record Company, which he launched in 1952. Sun Records produced more rock-and-roll records than any other record label of its time during its 16-year run, producing 226 singles. Phillips recorded different styles of music, but he was interested in the blues: &quot;The blues, it got people—black and white—to think about life, how difficult, yet also how good it can be. They would sing about it; they would pray about it; they would preach about it. This is how they relieved the burden of what existed day in and day out.&quot;

In addition to musical performances, Phillips recorded events such as weddings and funerals, selling the recordings.

==Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison==
Phillips and Elvis Presley opened a new form of music. Phillips said of Presley: &quot;Elvis cut a ballad, which was just excellent. I could tell you, both Elvis and Roy Orbison could tear a ballad to pieces. But I said to myself, &#x27;You can&#x27;t do that, Sam.&#x27; If I had released a ballad I don&#x27;t think you would have heard of Elvis Presley.&quot;

Phillips stated of his goals, &quot;everyone knew that I was just a struggling cat down here trying to develop new and different artists, and get some freedom in music, and tap some resources and people that weren&#x27;t being tapped.&quot; He didn&#x27;t care about mistakes; he cared about the feel.

Phillips met Presley through the mediation of his longtime collaborator at the Memphis Recording Service, Marion Keisker, who was already a well-known Memphis radio personality. On July 18, 1953, the eighteen-year-old Presley dropped into the studio to record an acetate for his mother&#x27;s birthday; Keisker thought she heard some talent in the young truck driver&#x27;s voice, and so she turned on the tape recorder. Later, she played it for Phillips, who gradually, with Keisker&#x27;s encouragement, warmed to the idea of recording Elvis.

Presley, who recorded his version of Arthur &quot;Big Boy&quot; Crudup&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; at Phillips&#x27;s studio, became highly successful, first in Memphis, then throughout the southern United States. He auditioned for Phillips in 1954, but it was not until he sang &quot;That&#x27;s All Right (Mama)&quot; that Phillips was impressed. He brought the song to Dewey Phillips, a disc jockey at WHBQ 560, to play on his &quot;Red, Hot &amp; Blue&quot; program. For the first six months, the flip side, &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot;, Presley&#x27;s upbeat version of a Bill Monroe bluegrass song, was slightly more popular than &quot;That&#x27;s All Right (Mama)&quot;. While still not known outside the South, Presley&#x27;s singles and regional success became a drawing card for Sun Records, as singing hopefuls soon arrived from all over the region. Singers such as Sonny Burgess (&quot;My Bucket&#x27;s Got a Hole in It&quot;), Charlie Rich, Junior Parker, and Billy Lee Riley recorded for Sun with some success, and others, such as Jerry Lee Lewis, B. B. King, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, and Carl Perkins, became stars.

Phillips&#x27;s pivotal role in the early days of rock and roll was exemplified by a celebrated jam session on December 4, 1956, with what became known as the Million Dollar Quartet. Jerry Lee Lewis was playing piano for a Carl Perkins recording session at Phillips&#x27;s studio. When Elvis Presley walked in unexpectedly, Johnny Cash was called into the studio by Phillips, leading to an impromptu session featuring the four musicians. Phillips challenged the four to achieve gold record sales, offering a free Cadillac to the first, which Carl Perkins won. The contest is commemorated in a song by the Drive-By Truckers.

By the mid-1960s, Phillips rarely recorded. He built a satellite studio and opened radio stations, but the studio declined, and he sold Sun Records to Shelby Singleton in 1969. In 1977 Sam&#x27;s sons, Knox and Jerry, were working with John Prine at the Phillips Recording Studio when Sam Phillips joined them to oversee recordings that were eventually included on the album &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot;.

==WHER==
Phillips launched radio station WHER on October 29, 1955. Each of the young women who auditioned for the station assumed there would only be one female announcer position, as was the case with other stations at that time. Only a few days before the first broadcast did they learn of the all-female format. It was the first all-female radio station in the United States, as almost every position at the station was held by a woman.

==Other business interests==
Through shrewd investments, Phillips amassed a fortune. He was one of the first investors in Holiday Inn, a motel chain that was about to expand to a nationwide franchise; he became involved with the chain shortly after selling Elvis Presley&#x27;s contract to RCA, for $35,000, which he multiplied many times over the years with Holiday Inn. He also created two subsidiary recording labels, Phillips International Records and Holiday Inn Records. He also owned the Sun Studio Café in Memphis. One location was in the Mall of Memphis.

Phillips and his family founded Big River Broadcasting Corporation, which owns and operates several radio stations in the Florence, Alabama area, including WQLT-FM, WSBM, and WXFL. He also established radio station WLIZ in Lake Worth, Florida in 1959.

==Accolades==
In 1986, Phillips was part of the first group inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. He was the first non-performer inducted. In 1987, he was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame. He received a Grammy Trustees Award for lifetime achievement in 1991. In 1998, he was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, in October 2001 he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, and in 2012 he was inducted into the inaugural class of the Memphis Music Hall of Fame.

==Later years and death==
Phillips died of respiratory failure, aged 80, at St. Francis Hospital in Memphis, on July 30, 2003, only one day before the original Sun Studio was designated a National Historic Landmark. Phillips is interred in the Memorial Park Cemetery in Memphis.

<text>Philip Tyler Keaggy (born March 23, 1951) is an American acoustic and electric guitarist and vocalist who has released more than 55 albums and contributed to many more recordings in both the contemporary Christian music and mainstream markets. He is a seven-time recipient of the GMA Dove Award for Instrumental Album of the Year, and was twice nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album. He has frequently been listed as one of the world&#x27;s top-two &quot;finger-style&quot; and &quot;finger-picking&quot; guitarists by &quot;Guitar Player Magazine&quot; readers&#x27; polls, and due to his complex and virtuosic playing, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest guitarists of all time.

==Biography ==

===Early life===
Keaggy was raised Catholic in a small farmhouse in Hubbard, Ohio, with nine brothers and sisters. He went to high school at Austintown Fitch High School in Austintown, Ohio graduating in 1970. He is missing half of the middle finger on his right hand due to an accident at age four involving a water pump. Keaggy reflects on the incident:
We lived on a farm in Hubbard, Ohio which had a big water pump, and I was climbing up on it. As I was kneeling on top of the platform, it broke and the faucets came crashing down on my finger and cut it off. I can remember it very vividly—as if it happened yesterday, and I can see my dad running down the hill, rescuing me, and taking me to the hospital. I can recall having a white cast and bandage; it was gigantic! They tried to sew it on, but it didn&#x27;t take, so I grew up with nine fingers. As a young kid, I was embarrassed about it a lot, especially when I was beginning to get into guitar.
Initially, it was not the guitar that attracted Keaggy to playing music. &quot;I asked my dad for a set of drums for my tenth birthday but he came home with a Sears Silvertone guitar.&quot;

===1960s===
Keaggy was a member of a mid-1960s garage rock band called the Squires; one of their songs (&quot;Batmobile&quot;), which he co-wrote, appears on the compilation album &quot;Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 9&quot;. In 1966 he joined Volume IV, which in 1967 became New Hudson Exit. The band appeared frequently in Youngstown clubs and also released a Keaggy composition, &quot;Come With Me&quot;, as a single on the Date label. At one point, New Hudson Exit had considered Joe Walsh as its lead guitarist. Walsh later established himself as the guitarist for The James Gang before embarking on a solo career and work with the Eagles.

In 1968, Keaggy and longtime friend drummer John Sferra, along with bassist Steve Markulin, formed the band Glass Harp. The band gigged in and around the Youngstown, Ohio area and found work at school dances and clubs. The incarnation of the band recorded several demos, and released the single &quot;Where Did My World Come From?&quot; on the United Audio label in 1969.

Markulin left the group to join his cousin Joe in another successful Youngstown band, The Human Beinz. Keaggy and Sferra then recruited bass player Daniel Pecchio. Pecchio, formerly of the band The Poppy, was also a flute player, a talent which later was showcased on several Glass Harp&#x27;s songs. After recording a new set of demos and signing with new management, the band set out to polish their live act and shop for a recording deal.

A major turning point for the trio was their winning of an Ohio area&#x27;s &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot;, One of the event&#x27;s judges happened to be an associate of producer Lewis Merenstein, whom he alerted to the threesome. Merenstein was persuaded to fly down from New York to listen to the band in concert. Upon hearing Glass Harp perform, Merenstein&#x27;s enthusiastic report resulted in Decca Records signing Glass Harp to a multi-record deal.

===1970s===
Reflecting on 1970, Keaggy recalls:
...the 18th year of my life was very dark; I was into drugs by now...back in &#x27;69 I was experimenting with LSD. I had done some trips and it was terrible, I thought it might enhance my creative ability in music, but it didn&#x27;t. I once heard a tape of me playing when I was high and it was awful. I sang weird and I played badly. I thought I was doing such a great job, but it was a deception. People I was supposedly very close to, who were close to me, were turning on me. It seemed really strange...I was experiencing such fear...it was just...terrible...During these days I would take naps in the afternoon because I&#x27;d be so tired playing at night, staying up till 4 in the morning, getting up early and napping again in the afternoon. I&#x27;d wake up having nightmares...I had &quot;Peace&quot; written on my wall and I went around giving the peace sign, but I didn&#x27;t experience peace in my life. I didn&#x27;t know what peace really meant; it was just a cliché.
On Valentine&#x27;s Day in 1970, Keaggy&#x27;s mother was seriously injured in an auto accident. After her death a week later and inspired by his sister, Keaggy became a born-again Christian.

In September of the same year, Glass Harp was in New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village recording its first album &quot;Glass Harp&quot; at Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s Electric Lady Studios with Lewis Merenstein as producer. At the time of the recording, Keaggy and Sferra were nineteen years old. All three members of Glass Harp wrote the band&#x27;s songs. Keaggy sang the majority of the songs; Pecchio and Sferra also sang lead on several numbers. One song of Keaggy&#x27;s in particular, &quot;Can You See Me&quot;, reflected his newfound Christian faith, with its reference to Jesus&#x27; death. Keaggy recalls, &quot;It was recorded in New York City in about a week. Even though I had bronchitis and had to sing one verse at a time, it worked out... I was even able to get in a witness for the Lord Jesus in &quot;Can You See Me&quot; and &quot;Look in the Sky&quot;.

As a Decca Records artist, the band began to open for bands including The Kinks, Iron Butterfly, Yes, Traffic, Grand Funk Railroad and Chicago. Contrary to the tight production and song-oriented nature of Glass Harp&#x27;s studio albums, their live performances demonstrated the band&#x27;s ability to stretch out and expand the boundaries of their compositions. As a result, they are one of the pioneers of what would later be known as the jam rock genre, with songs many times reaching over 30 minutes in length with extended solo passages and group improvisation.

In 1971, Glass Harp released a follow-up album, &quot;Synergy&quot;. Again Keaggy&#x27;s Christian faith surfaced in some of the lyrics. He notes, &quot;That album was a real experience because I was able to sing &#x27;The Answer&#x27;, a song I wrote right after my conversion to Christ... with...producers and an engineer that didn&#x27;t care about Jesus, I was surprised that out of 15 songs, one of the ten that got on the album was &#x27;The Answer&#x27;. I praise Jesus for that work, because it&#x27;s just a simple song of testimony.&quot; 

The next year the band released its third album: &quot;It Makes Me Glad&quot;, which included a version of the old spiritual &quot;Do Lord&quot;. &quot;We all worked the best that we could. The group knew that it would be our last album together because I had given notice that I was going to leave... on August 8, I did. It was a really heavy thing for everybody.&quot;

After recording three albums with Glass Harp, Keaggy left the band in 1972. He said, &quot;We enjoyed playing together and we really got tight musically. But spiritually we were going different directions.&quot; In 1973 he released &quot;What a Day&quot;, his first solo album. The songs were written while Keaggy was still with Glass Harp. He performed all the instruments on the album. The title track is a staple of Keaggy&#x27;s concerts up to the present day.

Keaggy married his wife Bernadette in the summer of 1973. He took a brief hiatus from recording on his own and only toured in support of other artists like Love Song, 2nd Chapter of Acts, Paul Clark, and Nancy Honeytree. Years later, Amboy Dukes guitarist Ted Nugent was quoted as saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know what happened to that Phil Keaggy. He could have saved the world with his guitar.&quot; 

Keaggy and his wife moved to rural Freeville, New York, to participate in and become immersed in the discipleship program of Love Inn Community led by Scottish-American disc-jockey Scott Ross. Ross affiliated himself and Love Inn Community with the Shepherding Movement, which progressively took on many characteristics of an authoritarian cult. Not until Keaggy extracted himself from the group and the menial labor to which they had largely confined him, that he once again began to record significant music.

In late 1974, Keaggy played guitar on Joe Vitale&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Roller Coaster Weekend&quot; produced by The Albert Brothers. The album featured guitarists Joe Walsh and Rick Derringer. Keaggy returned to the studio in 1976 with &quot;Love Broke Thru&quot;, an album which included his version of a song which has become a classic in Christian music: &quot;Your Love Broke Through&quot;. It was written by Keith Green, Todd Fishkind, and Randy Stonehill; the song later became closely identified with Green, yet it was at Green&#x27;s insistence that Keaggy&#x27;s rendition be the first released recording. 

A longtime fan of C.S. Lewis, Keaggy also included an arranged version of the author&#x27;s poem &quot;As the Ruin Falls&quot;. The seven-minute &quot;Time&quot; is considered by some fans to be the first album-oriented rock extended-length &quot;Free Bird&quot; of contemporary Christian music. &quot;Time&quot; featured Keaggy&#x27;s innovative guitar technique of violin-like swelling, found approximately 3:54 and 5:17 in the song. The effect requires picking the string, raising and then lowering the guitar volume knob for each note in a melody. His album was listed as No. 64 in the 2001 book, &quot;CCM Presents: The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music.&quot;

During the summer of 1977 Keaggy went on an eighteen-city tour of the western United States with 2nd Chapter of Acts and &quot;A Band called David&quot;. The tour was filmed for the live triple-album &quot;How the West Was One&quot;, a collection which featured concert renditions of &quot;What a Day&quot; and &quot;Your Love Broke Through&quot;. In the same year the Phil Keaggy Band was formed. Composed of Keaggy, guitarist Lynn Nichols, keyboardist Phil Madeira, bassist Dan Cunningham, and drummer Terry Andersen, the Phil Keaggy Band released their only album in 1977, &quot;Emerging&quot;. The band was featured as Love Inn Company on an album of songs by Ted Sandquist titled &quot;Courts of the King&quot;, and as the backing band for Nedra Ross on her &quot;Full Circle&quot; album. The title track was re-recorded by Keaggy in 1981. &quot;Song in the Air&quot;., a Glass Harp compilation album was released in 1977.

In 1978, Keaggy released his first critically acclaimed instrumental album entitled &quot;The Master and the Musician&quot;. It is the best-selling album of his career. A 1989 reissue of the album included a new track, &quot;Epilogue: Amazing Grace&quot;.

===1980s===
The Keaggy family moved to Leawood, Kansas in August 1979; their first daughter, Alicia, was born there in March 1980. They left Leawood in 1983 and lived in Costa Mesa, California. Their second daughter, Olivia, was born on February 14, 1984, and their son Ian was born on June 16, 1987.

Keaggy&#x27;s record label during the early part of the decade was Sparrow Records. 1980&#x27;s &quot;Ph&#x27;lip Side&quot; features &quot;Sunday School&quot; and the gentle &quot;Little Ones&quot;, an early anthem for the pro-life/anti-abortion movement. &quot;Town to Town&quot;, was released in 1981; it is noted for what has become a concert staple &quot;Let Everything Else Go&quot;. It included his arrangement of &quot;Rise Up O Men of God&quot;. A trend was begun in which Keaggy frequently featured a hymn on his albums. In 1982, Keaggy released &quot;Play Thru Me&quot;, known for its upbeat classic, &quot;Morning Light&quot; as well as the slide-guitar instrumental workout, &quot;Happy&quot;.

In 1984, Keaggy and Randy Stonehill co-wrote and sang the duet &quot;Who Will Save the Children?&quot; for Stonehill&#x27;s album &quot;Celebrate This Heartbeat&quot;. The duet became a theme song for Compassion International, a Christian child advocacy ministry. Both artists remain avid supporters of the ministry. The next year Nissi Records released Keaggy&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;Getting Closer&quot;. Keaggy would later re-record two of the album&#x27;s songs: a rearranged version of &quot;I Will Be There&quot; appears on 1993&#x27;s &quot;Crimson and Blue&quot; while &quot;Passport&quot; received an update for the 2009 Christian Progressive Rock compilation album &quot;CPR 3&quot;.

&quot;Way Back Home&quot; was released in 1986. The album has quieter acoustic numbers including a new rendition of 1981&#x27;s &quot;Let Everything Else Go&quot; and &quot;Maker of the Universe&quot;, a ballad about the incarnation of Christ. The album also emphasized one of the prominent themes in Keaggy&#x27;s music: family. The next year Phil Keaggy released his second instrumental album, &quot;The Wind and the Wheat&quot;. The album reflects the &quot;new-age&quot; instrumental sounds of the day. &quot;The Wind and the Wheat&quot; won the guitarist his first Dove Award, an honor that he received in 1988. Also in 1988, Keaggy and Stonehill would team up with singer Margaret Becker, former Wings drummer Joe English and others as the Compassion All Star Band. The group released a subsequent live album &quot;One by One&quot;.

In 1988, Keaggy teamed up with Randy Stonehill, vocalist Russ Taff, bassist Rick Cua, Derri Daugherty, Mark Heard, Steve Taylor and other musicians to create &quot;Phil Keaggy and Sunday&#x27;s Child&quot;. Lynn Nichols, guitarist for the 1977 Keaggy Band, produced the &quot;Sunday&#x27;s Child&quot; project. The title track in particular recalls the sounds of the 1960s, and that along with an album cover which resembles the classic image of &quot;With The Beatles&quot;, has sometimes seen the Sunday&#x27;s Child album referred to as a tribute album of sorts to the 1960s. Referring to the &quot;Sunday&#x27;s Child&quot; album cover, Keaggy said,

(The idea) was the producer&#x27;s. I actually had a different cover in mind...It was...a black and white [photograph] of my daughter Olivia sitting on a guitar case, with this Gretsch anniversary model standing up behind her against this concrete wall, and she&#x27;s got a little white flower wreath in her hair. She&#x27;s about four years old, and...I just loved that cover. So when the album came out, I wasn&#x27;t really knocked out by the Beatles thing, because it didn&#x27;t look like the Beatles to me! It was my goofy face and then these three guys in the background, one of which was Lynn Nichols, the producer. And I thought, &quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t care for this.&quot; I wanted to have the other cover. I wanted it to say &quot;Phil Keaggy and Sunday&#x27;s Child,&quot; and to me, that was Olivia, being as she&#x27;s my daughter. So my nephew works in a printing place, and I created this cover that had all the same photos and information inside the CD insert, but I had him make 500 of these new covers, and we took the shrink wrap off...500 CDs, and...inserted these covers that I wanted and took them on the road and sold them, and we mailed them out through the fan club, since we didn&#x27;t have a website in those days.&quot;

About the music on the project, Keaggy says,

I feel the album, as a good collection of songs, is really listenable...I feel that folk who want to listen to an album are more interested in good songs than merely the guitar player. For &quot;Sunday&#x27;s Child&quot;, not only did we resort to using vintage guitars and amps, but I resorted back to old ways of playing. The rock leads are shorter and more precise. More to the point, feisty, and a little bit more dangerous. What you get is more incisive work. It&#x27;s something that fits the song rather than trying to create a song around a riff or guitar figure...What I think comes through this album is that sense of longing, of love, of suffering and in all of this there can be hope. Everyone has to find their way to God and I hope people will see Jesus in my life and this album as a guide along the way.&quot;
One track, &quot;I&#x27;ve Just Begun (Again)&quot;, was first written when Keaggy was 17, and was updated for the album. In addition to his own music, he recorded two Mark Heard songs for the album: &quot;I Always Do&quot; and &quot;Everything is Alright&quot;. The recordings appear again on tribute albums to Heard. One of the tribute albums, &quot;Orphans of God&quot;, was listed at No. 25 in the book, &quot;CCM Presents: The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music&quot;.

Also in 1989, Keaggy went on the road with Stonehill for a tour by The Keaggy/Stonehill Band, which included Swirling Eddie drummer David Raven and Daniel Amos bassist Tim Chandler. In the fall of 1989, the Keaggys relocated again, leaving southern California and moving to Nashville.

A few years later, Keaggy performed at former Beatle Paul McCartney&#x27;s sister-in-law&#x27;s wedding. Keaggy had met Laura Eastman, sister of Linda McCartney, while the former worked at Christian Broadcasting Network in Virginia Beach, Virginia. After the wedding, Keaggy fulfilled a lifelong dream of his while jamming with McCartney in a bedroom at the Eastman family estate which was the location of the wedding. 

===1990s===
Keaggy followed &quot;Sunday&#x27;s Child&quot; in 1990 with an all-out rock album &quot;Find Me in These Fields&quot;. The project was produced by Lynn Nichols and received a Grammy award nomination. In 1992, Keaggy released what has become a landmark acoustic instrumental album, &quot;Beyond Nature&quot;. His third instrumental project reflected a Celtic-influence and earned the guitarist his second Dove Award in the &quot;Instrumental Record&quot; category. The album&#x27;s title, &quot;Beyond Nature&quot;, was derived from a quote in C.S. Lewis&#x27; book &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;. A long-time fan of Lewis&#x27; work, Keaggy also referenced the author in several song titles (&quot;Brother Jack&quot;, &quot;Addison&#x27;s Walk&quot; and &quot;County Down&quot;).

In 1993, Keaggy worked with a group of talented musicians on a project. The recording sessions reunited Keaggy with former Glass Harp bandmate John Sferra on drums. Keaggy said, &quot;I started Crimson &amp; Blue with a two-fold purpose: To record something more aggressive and to work with John again. We recorded all the basic tracks together and most of the leads were recorded live. It&#x27;s just your basic four-piece group.&quot; The rest of the group was Phil Madeira, the former keyboardist of the 1977 Phil Keaggy Band; bassist Rick Cua, and guitarist Jimmy Abegg. Lynn Nichols produced the sessions. 

Other guest musicians included Sam Bush on mandolin, John Mark Painter (of Fleming and John), and Ashley Cleveland on backing vocals. Charlie Peacock and Steve Taylor played a prominent role in the project. The sessions resulted in the release of &quot;Crimson and Blue&quot;, a bluesy rock album geared to the Christian market which included a cover of Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;When Will I Ever Learn to Live in God&quot;. &quot;Love Divine&quot;, &quot;I Will Be Here&quot;, and &quot;Everywhere I Look&quot;; they all received substantial airplay. The album was released simultaneously in the mainstream market as &quot;Blue&quot;, with a modified track list and some reworked songs. The most significant differences are the inclusion of three different songs (a cover of Badfinger&#x27;s &quot;Baby Blue&quot;; &quot;All Our Wishes&quot;; and &quot;The Further Adventures of...&quot;) and the exclusion of five songs from &quot;Crimson and Blue&quot; (&quot;Love Divine&quot;, &quot;Reunion of Friends&quot;, &quot;Stone Eyes&quot;, &quot;I Will Be There&quot;, and &quot;Nothing But The Blood&quot;.) The song &quot;All Our Wishes&quot; is a story about Phil and Bernadette Keaggy losing a baby. The song was written, musically, in 1967 when Keaggy was in ninth grade. The band that toured in support of the album featured Madeira on Hammond B-3 organ, Sferra on drums, and Wade Jaynes (of Chagall Guevara) on bass.

In June 1994, Keaggy released a heavily revised version of his 1986 album &quot;Way Back Home&quot;. The 1994 edition featured new recordings of ten of the original album&#x27;s eleven songs, including the moving classics &quot;Maker of the Universe&quot; and &quot;Let Everything Else Go&quot;. The updated version also included four brand new tracks: &quot;It Could Have Been Me&quot;. &quot;She&#x27;s a Dancer&quot;, &quot;Father Daughter Harmony&quot;, and &quot;The 50th&quot;. Keeping with the album&#x27;s family motif, &quot;Father Daughter Harmony&quot; was a moving duet with daughter Alicia while &quot;The 50th&quot; features Keaggy&#x27;s guitar playing over excerpts from a vinyl record of his grandparents&#x27; 50th wedding anniversary in 1948.

In 1995, &quot;Time: 1970-1995&quot;., a two volume compilation project was released. The anthology has selections from throughout Keaggy&#x27;s career, including several classic instrumentals. Several unreleased tracks are featured, including a live version of &quot;Do Lord&quot; with Glass Harp, a live version of &quot;Shouts of Joy&quot; from the &quot;Crimson and Blue&quot; tour, and &quot;We&#x27;ll Meet Again&quot;, a song he wrote and recorded as a teenager. An alternate version of &quot;Time&quot; was also included as was a new solo recording of the Glass Harp song &quot;The Answer&quot;. Also in 1995, he was voted by &quot;Guitar Player&quot; Magazine readers as the No. 2 Best Acoustic Fingerstyle Guitarist.

That same year, Keaggy released what has become one of his best-selling albums, &quot;True Believer&quot;. The title track was written by producer Alan Shacklock and reached number one on the Christian radio charts. It won Shacklock the EMI Songwriter of the Year award. Shacklock&#x27;s production work on the album was a departure in style and sound for Keaggy. It proved to be Keaggy&#x27;s lone work with Shacklock. Years later, in reflecting on the album, Keaggy said that &quot;True Believer&quot; &quot;is really the most unlike me of any album I&#x27;ve ever done, in my personal opinion. It was more of a manufactured concept: &quot;We&#x27;re gonna make a pop album for you that&#x27;s going to launch you into the next ten years&quot;. I don&#x27;t know if it did. It&#x27;s an unusual album to listen to for me, but there are a couple of good songs on there, though.&quot;

The next year Keaggy released another critically acclaimed instrumental album, &quot;Acoustic Sketches&quot;. Mainly Keaggy originals, the album features a cover of &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot;; he won another Dove Award for the album. A second instrumental album, &quot;220&quot;, was released. The album, named for the 220 volt electric standard, featured a diverse mix of musical styles, ranging from blues to Celtic. The album&#x27;s final track, &quot;Ian&#x27;s Groove&quot;, marks the recording debut of Phil&#x27;s son on drums. Despite its stellar performances, as a collection of original instrumentals, the album was largely overlooked. Keaggy says, &quot;that was a very cool album that...Christians and Christian bookstores and...the marketplace ...couldn&#x27;t make the connection, because it&#x27;s electric guitar music... it kind of fell by the wayside.&quot; Also in 1996, his wife Bernadette published &quot;A Deeper Shade of Grace&quot;, a moving account of the emotional and spiritual struggles she experienced in losing their first five children via early infant death, miscarriage and stillbirth. He wrote the foreword for the book.

In January 1997, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio opened an exhibit, &quot;My Town&quot;. Because the exhibit focused on Cleveland&#x27;s rock and roll history, Glass Harp was invited to perform at the museum. The band is also currently represented in the museum&#x27;s Ohio Exhibit. &quot;On the Fly&quot; was also released in 1997, arguably his most ambitious instrumental project to date. Released through Canis Major Records, highlights are Spanish-flavored &quot;Praise Dance&quot;, the hypnotic groove &quot;Firewalker&quot;, and the six-part epic, &quot;Way of the Pilgrim&quot;. Also in 1997, he teamed up with Wes King and Out of the Grey&#x27;s Scott Dente for the mostly instrumental album &quot;Invention&quot;. The album would win a Dove Award the following year. Keaggy would then go on to sign with Word Records.

&quot;Phil Keaggy&quot;, Keaggy&#x27;s last vocal album of the decade came out in 1998. Lacking the slick production style of the previous vocal album, &quot;True Believer&quot;, &quot;Phil Keaggy&quot; was a strong return to form for Keaggy in terms of recapturing his usual organic, live sound. Several songs reflected a Beatles influence, including &quot;Days Like You&quot;, his last single to receive considerable airplay as Christian radio seemed to move towards a more youth-oriented format. He also appeared as a guest singer on the Ragamuffins&#x27; &quot;All the Way to Kingdom Come&quot;, on his friend Rich Mullins&#x27; last original work, &quot;The Jesus Record&quot; (which contained demo tracks recorded by Mullins just before his 1997 death, and renditions of those songs by the Ragamuffins and other artists).

In 1999 there was a flurry of Keaggy instrumental releases. The double album &quot;Premium Jams&quot; is a stunning collection of previously unreleased electric instrumentals dating back to the recording sessions for &quot;Crimson and Blue&quot; and &quot;220&quot;. &quot;Majesty and Wonder&quot;, a Christmas album featuring the London Festival Orchestra, includes Keaggy&#x27;s take on standards such as &quot;Oh Holy Night&quot; as well as a three-part original, &quot;Nativity Suite&quot;. &quot;Majesty and Wonder&quot; garnered him a Dove Award. He later released the four-disc collection &quot;Music to Paint By&quot;. The project was composed of &quot;Still Life&quot;, &quot;Electric Blue&quot;, &quot;Splash&quot;, and &quot;Brushstrokes&quot;.

===2000s===

&quot;Re-Emerging&quot;, Keaggy&#x27;s first album of the new millennium, came out in April 2000. The disc was a reunion of the Phil Keaggy Band; they updated their classic 1977 album, &quot;Emerging&quot;. With the exception of &quot;Gentle Eyes&quot;, &quot;Re-Emerging&quot; retained the material from the original album and also introduced four brand new tracks: &quot;My Auburn Lady&quot;, &quot;Mighty Lord&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re My Hero&quot;, and &quot;Amelia Earhart&#x27;s Last Flight&quot;.

In September of the same year, Keaggy released the instrumental album &quot;Zion&quot;. Recorded exclusively on a Zion Radicaster built by master guitarmaker Ken Hoover of Zion guitars, &quot;Zion&quot; features a mix of new songs such as &quot;Z-Blues&quot; and revamped versions of &quot;Like an Island&quot;, &quot;March of the Clouds&quot; and the Glass Harp classic &quot;Whatever Life Demands&quot;.

In October 2000, Keaggy, John Sferra and Daniel Pecchio reunited as Glass Harp for a concert in their hometown of Youngstown at a sold out Powers Auditorium. They had performed together occasionally since 1981. Conductor Isaiah Jackson and members of the Youngstown Symphony joined the band. The next year &quot;Strings Attached&quot; was released, the reunion concert live album. Although the album is largely devoted to the band&#x27;s previous work, it also includes Glass Harp&#x27;s version of several songs from Keaggy&#x27;s solo career including &quot;Tender Love&quot;, &quot;Chalice&quot;, &quot;From the Beginning&quot;, and a solo acoustic version of &quot;The True Believers&quot;.

October 2000 was also when &quot;Inseparable&quot; was released, initially available in both single and double disc format; the single disc version went out of print. The album featured &quot;Chalice&quot;, a collaboration with Glass Harp drummer Sferra as well as a cover of Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Motor of Love&quot;. In the same month, Keaggy released &quot;Lights of Madrid&quot;, an album of Spanish-flavored instrumentals which included a re-recording of &quot;Praise Dance&quot; from 1996&#x27;s &quot;On the Fly&quot;. &quot;Lights of Madrid&quot; contains a PDF with guitar tablature for the album&#x27;s music. &quot;Lights of Madrid&quot; won Keaggy a Dove Award for best instrumental album. In November 2000, he released The &quot;Uncle Duke&quot; project, a collaboration with his uncle Dave &quot;Duke&quot; Keaggy, with Phil Keaggy setting his uncle&#x27;s eclectic poetry to music.

In 2001, Phil Keaggy released the albums &quot;In the Quiet Hours&quot; and &quot;Cinemascapes&quot;. Both have selections from the 1999 four-disc project &quot;Music to Paint By&quot;. &quot;In the Quiet Hours&quot; showcased a new composition &quot;As It Is in Heaven&quot;; &quot;Cinemascapes&quot; includes three previously unreleased songs: &quot;The Road Home&quot;, &quot;Lighthouse&quot;, and &quot;For the Love&quot;. The song &quot;Spring&quot; was previously released on 2000&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Duke&quot; as &quot;Interlude&quot;. &quot;What Matters&quot;, a nine-song compilation drawing mostly from the albums &quot;Phil Keaggy&quot; and &quot;Crimson and Blue&quot; was also released in 2001. &quot;Tell Me How You Feel&quot; from &quot;Sunday&#x27;s Child&quot; is included as well as a new song &quot;What Matters&quot;. The album was exclusively produced for and released through the International Bible Society.

In 2002, &quot;Hymnsongs&quot; was released. Primarily a collection of classic hymns, the album also includes a Keaggy original composition which is centered around the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. The track, &quot;Our Daily Bread&quot; as well as the entire album, are dedicated to Todd Beamer, a Christian passenger of 9-11&#x27;s Flight 93 who was a fan of Keaggy&#x27;s music. Describing the concept of the project, Keaggy says, &quot;I&#x27;ve always loved hymns. They&#x27;re great melodies that still stand on their own, and are still sung, even after centuries have passed... those melodies are even more appreciated when you know the lyrics. The writers of the hymns were great wordsmiths; they could be so concise and so eloquent in their expression of truth... theirs is music that speaks to every generation&quot;. Yet Keaggy&#x27;s label at the time, Word Records, did not share his vision for the project and asked for it to be an instrumental album. Keaggy said, &quot;It&#x27;s the oddest thing...to me, hymns should be really sung. I had a conflict with it because, here I am, I can sing, and yet they didn&#x27;t want me to sing...I offered--I went to management about it and it was pretty much, &quot;No, don&#x27;t do that. That&#x27;s not want they want.&quot; &quot;Hymnsongs&quot; would be Keaggy&#x27;s last album with Word Records.

In the same year, Phil also participated on Randy Stonehill&#x27;s &quot;Edge of the World&quot; album, singing a duet &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Goes&quot; as well as appearing on &quot;We Were All So Young&quot; with other veteran musicians such as Larry Norman. Additionally, Bernadette Keaggy published &quot;Losing You Too Soon&quot;, an updated version of &quot;A Deeper Shade of Grace&quot;, her 1996 book on losing her first five children through early infant death, miscarriage and stillbirth.

The next year Keaggy released &quot;It&#x27;s Personal&quot;, an album in which he set poetry by Keith Moore to music. Keaggy and Moore had previously collaborated on the song &quot;A Little Bit of Light&quot; that appeared on the guitarist&#x27;s 1998 self-titled album. Also in 2003 Keaggy released &quot;Special Occasions&quot;, an eclectic collection of music focusing on birthdays, weddings and graduations. The album consisted primarily of Keaggy originals and also featured a re-recording of &quot;Here and Now&quot; from 1986&#x27;s &quot;Way Back Home&quot;, as well as covers of the Beatles tune &quot;When I&#x27;m 64&quot; and Elton John&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Discovery&quot;. That same year, Sparrow Records, Phil&#x27;s former record label (1980–1983, 1994–1997), released a 15-track compilation &quot;History Makers&quot;. It features standards such as &quot;Let Everything Else Go&quot;, &quot;Morning Light&quot;, and &quot;The True Believers&quot;. 2003 also saw the release of &quot;Hourglass&quot;, the first album of new material by Glass Harp since 1972. The album included a new recording of a rare Keaggy solo tune, &quot;What Matters&quot;, the title track of a compilation album exclusively produced for and released through the International Bible Society in 2001.

Also in 2003, guitarist Muriel Anderson released an album with Keaggy entitled &quot;Precious Gems&quot;. A collection primarily consisting of instrumental improvisations recorded in 2001 and 2003, the two also perform Keaggy&#x27;s &quot;Tennessee Morning&quot; from his 1996 album &quot;220&quot;. Guitarist Stanley Jordan appears on several songs. Portions of the album&#x27;s earnings go towards Anderson&#x27;s Music for Life Alliance fundraiser.

The following year, Glass Harp released &quot;Stark Raving Jams&quot;, a triple-disc 39-song collection of material spanning from 1970 to 2003. The collection focused primarily on live performances but also includes a few unreleased studio recordings. Like &quot;Strings Attached&quot;, this Glass Harp album includes live renditions of some Keaggy solo material.

In 2004 Keaggy guest performed with the indie band Dispatch for several songs during &quot;The Last Dispatch&quot;. Phil also released two live DVDS: &quot;Phil Keaggy in Concert: St. Charles IL&quot;, and &quot;Philly Live!&quot;

In 2005, after thirty years of being out of print, Glass Harp&#x27;s first three studio albums were reissued on CD by Music Mill Entertainment. The albums were digitally remastered and include previously unreleased bonus tracks. In July, Keaggy also released an expanded edition of &quot;Uncle Duke&quot;. First released in 2000, this new edition was entitled &quot;The Uncle Duke Project&quot; and included the original album plus a bonus disc of new songs, alternate versions and an interview with Phil and his uncle.

The next year, Keaggy released &quot;Freehand&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Acoustic Sketches&quot;. That same year Keaggy and long-time friend Randy Stonehill released &quot;Together Live!&quot; in both album and DVD format. In addition to including acoustic renditions of Keaggy and Stonehill&#x27;s solo material, the project includes versions of their previous collaborations such as &quot;Sunday&#x27;s Child&quot;, &quot;Who Will Save the Children?&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Goes&quot;. Keaggy later guest performed on two songs of Rufus Tree&#x27;s album &quot;Dying To Live&quot;.
In 2006, Keaggy release three additional instrumental albums: &quot;Jammed!&quot; was a one-disc collection of songs featured previously on 1999&#x27;s double album &quot;Premium Jams&quot;. The album also included a new rendering of &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; titled &quot;Joyphil&quot; and &quot;Prehistrobie K-18&quot;, a previously unreleased song that Phil wrote and recorded as a teenager. The acoustic instrumental album &quot;Roundabout&quot;, is another instrumental collection. The songs are either improvisation or other riffs played over loops that were recorded as part of the performance. Keaggy explains that the songs &quot;began with me messing around at my soundchecks before the audience came in. I&#x27;d typically just come from taking a nap at a hotel, so my mind would be fresh, and I&#x27;d improvise loops that would be recorded by my soundman, Brian Persall. The loops have rhythm, lead, bass, and even percussion parts along with textures created using an EBow and placing plastic between the strings, which creates koto, banjo, and steel drum-type sounds. After I returned home, I imported all of the loops into Pro Tools and edited some sections, but no overdubs were added either after the initial recording or while in the studio. If a song was too long, I might edit some measures or repeated sections to make it a little less repetitious, or maybe move some bits around.&quot;

Phil Keaggy and guitarist Mike Pachelli released an acoustic instrumental project titled &quot;Two of Us&quot;. Also in 2006 Phil released a vocal album, &quot;Dream Again&quot;. It includes his son Ian, who co-wrote, sings and plays guitar on &quot;Why&quot; while his daughter Alicia sings a duet with her father on &quot;Micah 6:8&quot;. In 2006, Glass Harp reunited for a concert to celebrate the release of their first DVD, &quot;Circa 72&quot;. The DVD is the first official release of their 1972 PBS concert, and includes rare outtakes, home movie footage, and a commentary by the band. The year also saw the release of &quot;Happy Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;, a limited edition compilation of various love songs that Phil had recorded over the years as well as four new tracks.

In April 2006 Keaggy launched a free podcast that is available through his website and iTunes. His last edition to date is from September 2008. The Podcasts feature music and commentary from Phil as well as music from some of his favorite artists.

On October 29, 2007, Keaggy was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame by P.O.D. guitarist Jason Truby. He also released &quot;Acoustic Cafe&quot;, an album, that with the exception of &quot;You Have My Heart&quot;, is a collection of covers ranging from Bob Dylan (&quot;If Not For You&quot;, &quot;Make You Feel My Love&quot;) to Cyndi Lauper (&quot;Time After Time&quot;). Many of the songs are duets, such as the Beatles&#x27; &quot;In My Life&quot; with Randy Stonehill and the Everly Brothers &quot;All I Have to Do is Dream&quot; with Jeremy Casella. Later that year Keaggy released another acoustic instrumental album: &quot;The Song Within&quot;. Recorded using a McPherson acoustic guitar, the album revamped two Keaggy classics, with &quot;What a Day&quot; being transformed as &quot;Water Day&quot; and &quot;Noah&#x27;s Song&quot; undergoing significant revision as &quot;Noah&#x27;s Shuffle&quot;.

2007 also marked the 30th anniversary of the landmark instrumental album, 1978&#x27;s &quot;The Master and the Musician&quot;. The album was re-released with a bonus disc of outtakes, alternate versions and a recent interview. Keaggy also toured in support of the album&#x27;s anniversary with a band that featured Glass Harp drummer John Sferra. The tour was chronicled on the subsequent live DVD: &quot;The Master &amp; the Musician: 30 Years Later Tour&quot;. The next year Keaggy released the album &quot;Phantasmagorical: Master and Musician 2&quot;, the sequel to his 1978 masterpiece.

In 2008, Keaggy received the Gold Level Award as the &quot;Best Spiritual / Worship Guitarist&quot;, as voted by readers of &quot;Acoustic Guitar Magazine&quot;, as well as appearing in the form of vocals and lead guitar on the Richard Cummins CD, &quot;Moments&quot;, which was nominated for &quot;Best Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year&quot; by the Canadian GMA&#x27;s, Covenant award.

In June 2009, Keaggy and Randy Stonehill released a new studio album titled &quot;Mystery Highway&quot;. In support of the album, the two musicians, along with guitarist Mike Pachelli and Glass Harp&#x27;s Daniel Pecchio and John Sferra, played several concerts as &quot;The Keaggy-Stonehill Band&quot;. The year also saw Keaggy contribute a soaring re-recorded version of &quot;Passport&quot; on the album &quot;CPR 3&quot;; a compilation of musicians from the Christian Progressive Rock (CPR) scene. The original version of &quot;Passport&quot; appeared on Keaggy&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Getting Closer&quot;. In October Keaggy released an instrumental album with pianist Jeff Johnson titled &quot;Frio Suite&quot;. After meeting each other for the first time at the beginning of the year, the two musicians stayed in touch and created the album via email, with Johnson recording in Seattle while Keaggy recorded in Nashville. December saw the release of the guitarist&#x27;s third Christmas album, &quot;Welcome Inn&quot;. Featuring mostly original compositions such as the title track, &quot;Welcome Inn&quot; also includes the classic &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&quot; and an acoustic instrumental version of &quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&quot;. The project also includes a new recording of &quot;On that Day&quot;, a song co-written with Glass Harp drummer John Sferra for Keaggy&#x27;s &quot;True Believer&quot; album in 1995.

On March 27, 2010, Glass Harp released their fourth live album: &quot;Glass Harp Live at the Beachland Ballroom 11.01.08&quot;. The ten-song project included material from Phil&#x27;s solo career: &quot;Sign Came through a Window&quot; and &quot;John the Revelator&quot;. The album is a recording of a benefit concert that Glass Harp headlined for Roots of American Music (www.rootsofamericanmusic.org), &quot;an organization dedicated to the preservation, performance and education about traditional American music in our schools.&quot;

Also in late 2010, Keaggy did some session work with former Monkees member Micky Dolenz for Dolenz&#x27;s solo album &quot;King for a Day&quot;. and he played guitar on the song &quot;Rushing Wind&quot; on Steve Clark&#x27;s album &quot;Save The Day&quot;.

In the fall of 2010, The Phil Keaggy Trio released their first album, &quot;Inter-Dimensional Traveler&quot;. The project is a collaboration with keyboardist Jack Giering and Glass Harp drummer John Sferra. and is described as &quot;being a wonderful blend of ambient jazz and funk&quot;, as well as &quot;being accredited with creating some of the tastiest jazz-funk licks to come out of Music City in a long, long time.&quot;

In addition to recording and touring regularly, Keaggy is currently working on a record with former Living Sacrifice and P.O.D. guitarist Jason Truby.

==Rumored comments by Jimi Hendrix and others==
For decades rumors have circulated which say many guitar icons have made comments regarding Phil Keaggy. The most common rumored statements are attributed to Jimi Hendrix.

On March 19, 1970, an advertisement appeared in the &quot;Mansfield News Journal&quot; for an Iron Butterfly Concert at Ashland College the next evening, with Glass Harp listed as the opening band (erroneously printed as &quot;The Grass Harp&quot;). Underneath &quot;The Grass Harp&quot;, a caption read &quot;They Jam with Jimi Hendrix&quot;. Glass Harp had not appeared anywhere with Jimi Hendrix (they were at the time still a local band to Northeast Ohio with little or no following nationally). It is not known whether or not the promoter or Glass Harp&#x27;s management at the time had the phrase put in the advertisement, but it is believed to be the first instance of any rumor regarding Hendrix in relation to Keaggy/Glass Harp.

In a February 5, 1971, feature on Glass Harp in Cleveland&#x27;s &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;, the paper&#x27;s rock music critic Jane Scott cited unnamed &quot;record people&quot; who recounted a story of Hendrix saying (in 1970) &quot;That guy (Phil Keaggy) is the upcoming guitar player in the Midwest&quot;.

In later years, rumors became stories of Hendrix appearing on various television programs where he mentioned Phil Keaggy. A common variation says that during an episode of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Johnny Carson asked Hendrix, &quot;Who is the best guitarist in the world?&quot; Hendrix is said to have answered, &quot;Phil Keaggy.&quot; Since then it has been proven to be untrue, as evidenced by the available audio from Hendrix&#x27;s (only) appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on July 10, 1969, with guest host Flip Wilson. No mention of Keaggy or Glass Harp is made.

Another version has Hendrix being asked, &quot;Jimi, how does it feel to be the world&#x27;s greatest guitar player?&quot; Hendrix supposedly replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, you&#x27;ll have to ask Phil Keaggy!&quot; The account is sometimes attributed to a magazine interview in either &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; or &quot;Guitar Player&quot;. Occasionally the story has the setting for the question being a Hendrix appearance on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, which is also untrue, as the clip from the show (in 1969) contains no mention of any other guitar players.

Other variants of the urban legend exist with Hendrix answering the question with Rory Gallagher, Terry Kath, Billy Gibbons, or John McLaughlin in place of Keaggy. Other variants have the question being answered by Eric Clapton. A more recent variant has Eddie Van Halen being asked the same question by David Letterman or Barbara Walters, usually answering “I don’t know, you’ll have to ask Randy Rhodes.”

Keaggy has continually insisted that such stories are completely unfounded, noting that &quot;it was impossible that Jimi Hendrix could ever have heard me...We...recorded our first album at Electric Lady Studios two weeks after his unfortunate death, so I just can&#x27;t imagine how he could&#x27;ve heard me. I think it&#x27;s just a rumor that someone&#x27;s kept alive, and it must be titillating enough to keep an interest there... I don&#x27;t think it was said...that&#x27;s it for that!&quot; Keaggy&#x27;s recollection of the time frame during which Glass Harp&#x27;s first album was recorded differs slightly from Glass Harp&#x27;s officially-published history (which have the recording sessions ending on September 17, 1970, just hours before Hendrix&#x27;s early-morning death in London, and not two weeks after).

In a July 2010 interview, Glass Harp bassist Daniel Pecchio commented on the ongoing Hendrix rumors saying &quot;It&#x27;s a true urban legend. I still have people coming up to me claiming to have a Dick Cavett Show tape where Hendrix says that. We never pushed that rumor, you know, but it didn&#x27;t hurt us.&quot;

==Personal life==
Phil Keaggy&#x27;s son Ian was the bass player for the band Hot Chelle Rae, which had a Top 10 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 2011. Ian left the band in 2013 to pursue a solo career.

Phil Keaggy&#x27;s nephew was married to contemporary Christian singer songwriter Cheri Keaggy.

Phil Keaggy&#x27;s sister is former American television and film actress Mary Ellen Kay, who died in 2017. Keaggy credits her for introducing him to the Christian faith, although he was raised Catholic.

<text>Bruce Douglas Cockburn ( ; born May 27, 1945) is a Canadian singer-songwriter and guitarist. His song styles range from folk to folk- and jazz-influenced rock to soundscapes accompanying spoken stories. His lyrics reflect interests in spirituality, human rights, environmental issues, and relationships, and describe his experiences in Central America and Africa.

Cockburn has written more than 350 songs on 34 albums over a career spanning five decades, of which 22 have received a Canadian gold or platinum certification as of 2018, and he has sold more than one million albums in Canada alone. In 2014, Cockburn released his memoirs, &quot;Rumours of Glory&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Cockburn was born in 1945 in Ottawa, Ontario, and spent some time at his grandfather&#x27;s farm outside of Chelsea, Quebec, but he grew up in Westboro, which was a suburb of Ottawa when he was a teenager. His father, Doug Cockburn, was a radiologist, eventually becoming head of diagnostic X-ray at the Ottawa Civic Hospital. He found his first guitar in his grandmother&#x27;s attic around 1959, adorned it with gold stars, and used it to play along to radio hits. When his first guitar teacher, Hank Sims, declared this instrument unplayable, his parents bought him a Kay archtop with flat wound strings and a DeArmond pickup.

Later he was taught piano and music theory by Peter Hall, the organist at Westboro United Church which Cockburn and his family attended. Cockburn had been listening to jazz and wanted to learn musical composition. Hall encouraged him and, along with his friend Bob Lamble, a lot of time was spent at Hall&#x27;s house listening to and discussing jazz.

Cockburn attended Nepean High School, where his 1964 yearbook photo states his desire &quot;to become a musician&quot;. After graduating, he took a boat to Europe and busked in Paris.

Cockburn attended Berklee School of Music in Boston, where his studies included jazz composition, for three semesters between 1964 and 1966. That year he dropped out and joined an Ottawa band called The Children, which lasted for about a year.

==Career==
===Early career===
In early 1967 he joined the final lineup of the Esquires. He moved to Toronto that summer to form The Flying Circus with Marty Fisher and Gordon MacBain, former Bobby Kris &amp; The Imperials members, and Neil Lillie, ex-Tripp member. The group recorded some material in late 1967 (which remains unreleased) before changing its name to Olivus in the spring of 1968, by which time Lillie (who changed his name to Neil Merryweather) had been replaced by Dennis Pendrith from Livingstone&#x27;s Journey. Olivus opened for The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream in April 1968. That summer Cockburn broke up the band with the intention of going solo, but ended up in the band 3&#x27;s a Crowd with David Wiffen, Colleen Peterson, and Richard Patterson, who had been a co-member of The Children. Cockburn left 3&#x27;s a Crowd in the spring of 1969 to pursue a solo career.

Cockburn&#x27;s first solo appearance was at the Mariposa Folk Festival in 1967, and in 1969 he was a headliner. In 1970 he released his self-titled, solo album. A single, &quot;Going to the Country&quot;, appeared on the RPM Top 50 Canadian Chart.

Cockburn&#x27;s guitar work and songwriting won him an enthusiastic following. His early work featured rural and nautical imagery and Biblical metaphors. Raised as an agnostic, early in his career he became a Christian. Many of his albums from the 1970s refer to Christian themes, which in turn inform his concerns for human rights and environmentalism. His references to Christianity include the Grail imagery of 20th-century Christian poet Charles Williams and the ideas of theologian Harvey Cox.

In 1970 Cockburn became partners with Bernie Finkelstein in the music publishing firm Golden Mountain Music. He won the Juno for Canadian Folksinger of the Year, three years in a row, 1971–73. He was nominated for Canadian Folksinger of the Year and Male Vocalist of the Year at the 1974 Juno Awards.

While Cockburn had been popular in Canada for years, he did not have a big impact in the United States until 1979, with the release of the album &quot;Dancing in the Dragon&#x27;s Jaws&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Wondering Where the Lions Are&quot;, reached No. 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US in June 1980, earning Cockburn an appearance on NBC&#x27;s TV show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Cockburn&#x27;s label, True North Records, also signed a distribution deal with Recordi Records in Italy.

===1980s and 1990s===
Through the 1980s Cockburn&#x27;s songwriting became increasingly urban, global and political as he became more involved with progressive causes. His political concerns were first hinted at on the albums: &quot;Humans&quot;, &quot;Inner City Front&quot; and &quot;The Trouble with Normal&quot;. They became more evident in 1984, with his second US radio hit, &quot;If I Had a Rocket Launcher&quot; (No. 88 in the US) from the &quot;Stealing Fire&quot; album. He had written the song a year earlier, after visiting Guatemalan refugee camps in Mexico that were attacked by Guatemalan military helicopters. His political activism continues to the present. His internationalist bent is reflected in the many world music influences in his music, including reggae and Latin music.

In 1991 Intrepid Records released &quot;Kick at the Darkness&quot;, a tribute album to Cockburn whose title comes from a phrase in his song &quot;Lovers in a Dangerous Time&quot;. It features the Barenaked Ladies&#x27; cover of that song, which became their first Top 40 hit and an element in their early success. This lyric was also referenced by U2 in their song &quot;God Part II&quot; from their album &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;. Also in 1991, three of Cockburn&#x27;s songs were listed in a Toronto Star survey among Toronto&#x27;s top songs of all time.

In the early 1990s, Cockburn teamed with T Bone Burnett for two albums, &quot;Nothing but a Burning Light&quot; and &quot;Dart to the Heart&quot;. The latter included a song, &quot;Closer to the Light&quot;, inspired by the death of songwriter Mark Heard, a close friend of Cockburn and Burnett. Cockburn frequently refers to Heard as his favourite songwriter and he was one of many artists who paid tribute to Heard on an album and video titled &quot;Strong Hand of Love&quot;.

=== 2000s===
In 2001 Cockburn performed as part of the Music Without Borders concert, a benefit for the United Nations Donor Alert Appeal, which raised funds for refugees from Afghanistan, at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.

In January 2003 Cockburn finished recording his 21st album, &quot;You&#x27;ve Never Seen Everything&quot;, which features contributions from Emmylou Harris, Jackson Browne, Sam Phillips, Sarah Harmer, Hugh Marsh, Jonell Mosser, Larry Taylor and Steven Hodges.

Some of Cockburn&#x27;s previously published material had been collected in several albums: &quot;Resume&quot;, &quot;Mummy Dust&quot;, and &quot;Waiting for a Miracle&quot;. His first greatest hits collection was &quot;Anything Anytime Anywhere: Singles 1979–2002&quot;, released in 2002.

Cockburn performed a set at the Live 8 concert in Barrie, Ontario, on July 2, 2005. &quot;Speechless&quot;, an instrumental compilation of new and previously released material, was released on October 24, 2005. His 22nd album, &quot;Life Short Call Now&quot;, was released on July 18, 2006.

Canadian senator and retired general Roméo Dallaire, who is active in humanitarian fundraising and promoting awareness, appeared on stage at the University of Victoria with Cockburn. The October 4, 2008, concert was held to aid the plight of child soldiers.

In 2009 Cockburn travelled to Afghanistan to visit his brother, Medical Officer Capt. John Cockburn, and to play a concert for Canadian troops. He performed his 1984 song &quot;If I Had a Rocket Launcher&quot; and was temporarily awarded an actual rocket launcher by the military. Cockburn has stated that, while unsure of the original Invasion of Afghanistan, he supported Canada&#x27;s role there.

Cockburn released the studio album &quot;Small Source of Comfort&quot; in 2011.

In 2018, Cockburn&#x27;s album &quot;Bone on Bone&quot;, was named Contemporary Roots Album of the Year at the Juno Awards.

==Activism==
Cockburn&#x27;s songwriting is often political, expressing concern for the environment and the welfare of indigenous peoples. &quot;Baker&#x27;s Biographical Dictionary of Musicians&quot; writes, &quot;Cockburn always risked an outspoken stand in his work, taking on issues and morality to the detriment of his popular appeal. No artist since Phil Ochs has taken such strong political stands.&quot; He has worked with relief agency Oxfam, travelling to Central America in 1983, and with the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. The song &quot;Mines of Mozambique&quot; (&quot;The Charity of Night&quot;) reflects his observations of that country during a visit in 1995. Cockburn is affiliated with the Unitarian Service Committee of Canada, twice visiting Nepal with the charity, in 1987 and 2007.

Songs on these themes include &quot;If I Had a Rocket Launcher&quot; (&quot;Stealing Fire&quot;), an angry response to the plight of refugees in Central America; &quot;Stolen Land&quot; (&quot;Waiting for a Miracle&quot;), about the land claims of British Columbia&#x27;s Haida people; and &quot;If a Tree Falls&quot; (&quot;Big Circumstance&quot;)—one of Cockburn&#x27;s best-known songs—decrying the deforestation of the Amazon.

==Documentaries and soundtracks==
Cockburn wrote and performed the theme song for the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Franklin&quot;. He composed and performed, with Hugh Marsh, the music for the National Film Board of Canada documentary feature &quot;Waterwalker&quot; (1984), directed by Bill Mason. He also composed two songs for the classic English-Canadian film &quot;Goin&#x27; Down the Road&quot; (1970), directed by Donald Shebib.

In 1998 Cockburn travelled with filmmaker Robert Lang to Mali, West Africa, where he jammed with Grammy Award-winning blues musician Ali Farka Toure and kora master Toumani Diabate. The month-long journey was documented in the film &quot;River of Sand&quot;, which won the &quot;Regard Canadien&quot; award for best documentary at the Vues d&#x27;Afrique Film Festival in Montreal. It was also invited for competition at the International Festival of Environmental Films in Paris.

In 2007 Cockburn&#x27;s music was featured in the movie adaptation of Irvine Welsh&#x27;s best-selling novel &quot;&quot;.

A documentary film, &quot;Bruce Cockburn Pacing the Cage&quot;, was released in 2013 on television and a brief theatrical showing; directed by Joel Goldberg, gave a rare look into Cockburn&#x27;s music, life and politics.

In 2018, Cockburn contributed the song &quot;3 Al Purdys&quot; to the compilation album &quot;The Al Purdy Songbook&quot;.

While on vacation in Sweden with Kitty, he experienced a personal crisis, arising from conflict in their marriage. He prayed and asked Jesus for help. In that moment, he felt Jesus in the room, just as he had at their wedding.

Cockburn married his longtime girlfriend M. J. Hannett in 2011, shortly after the birth of his second daughter, Iona.

As of 2014, Cockburn and his family reside in the San Francisco area, where Cockburn wrote his memoirs.

<doc id="91126" wikidata="Q7722633" url="?curid=91126" title="The Choir (alternative rock band)">
<text>The Choir is an atmospheric alternative rock band currently comprising Derri Daugherty on guitar and lead vocals, Steve Hindalong on drums and percussion, and Dan Michaels on saxophone and Lyricon. Long-time bass guitarist Tim Chandler died in 2018, and guitarist Marc Byrd was the fifth member of the band between 2005–2014. The Choir&#x27;s industry accolades include a GMA Dove Award for Alternative/Modern Rock Album of the Year in 1996 and a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Gospel Album at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards in 2002.

As of 2025, the band has released 21 full-length studio albums, four EPs, six live albums, one single-disc compilation album, one retrospective box set, and is still actively recording new material.

==History==
===Southern California period (1983–1993)===
The Choir was originally formed as Youth Choir in the early 1980s by Daugherty and Hindalong. Chandler, who was also the bass guitarist for Daniel Amos, introduced Hindalong to Daugherty, who was the band&#x27;s roadie and sound man. The two quickly became friends, and Youth Choir got its start within the Calvary Chapel Christian punk and alternative music scene, which also included the bands Undercover, Crumbächer, Altar Boys and 4-4-1.

The band&#x27;s first official recording was the track &quot;It&#x27;s So Wonderful,&quot; released in 1983 on the compilation album &quot;What&#x27;s Shakin&quot;&#x27;, which also included early work from Undercover, Altar Boys and The Lifters. This song was one of the few times that Daugherty wrote both lyrics and music; as the band developed, the majority of the Choir&#x27;s lyrical output would come from Hindalong. As Youth Choir, they released their debut album &quot;Voices in Shadows&quot; in 1985, with Mike Sauerbrey on bass; their first EP &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; followed a year later, when Dan Michaels joined the band.

The Choir made a high-profile move to Myrrh Records in 1986 with their next release, &quot;Diamonds and Rain&quot;. Dropping the &quot;Youth&quot; from their moniker, they would be known as the Choir from that point forward. This was followed by three more albums for Myrrh, which featured musical contributions from an array of performers, including Charlie Peacock, Mark Heard, Steve Griffith of Vector and Gene Eugene and Riki Michele from Adam Again. The Choir&#x27;s lineup also changed. Chandler was the primary bass player through the recording sessions for &quot;Chase the Kangaroo&quot;, released in 1988; however, Robin Spurs replaced him on the tour for that album, as well as the recording sessions and tour for the band&#x27;s follow-up, &quot;Wide-Eyed Wonder&quot;, in 1989. When Spurs quit the band during the recording sessions for 1990&#x27;s &quot;Circle Slide&quot;, Sauerbrey returned for the remainder of those sessions, and toured with the Choir for two more years. Chandler then rejoined the lineup for the recording of &quot;Kissers and Killers&quot;, which was later independently released in 1993. Sauerbrey would not play with the band again; Spurs would rejoin the Choir briefly in 2017, when she performed on the &quot;Wide-Eyed Wonder&quot; reunion tour.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Choir toured extensively within the United States, and was most notably the first band on stage at the inaugural Cornerstone Festival in Chicago in 1984. They also preceded Bruce Cockburn on stage at the Greenbelt Festival in England in 1986, and opened for Russ Taff on his nationwide tour in 1990. References to the band&#x27;s tour experiences would remain an ongoing source of lyrical inspiration. During their Southern California period, the Choir&#x27;s music was described by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as &quot;magical songs that combine strains of murky psychedelia with pure pop.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; praised the band for its &quot;dark poetic leanings, effects-laden guitars and strong melodic hooks.&quot; Hindalong&#x27;s lyrics became known for their vulnerability and honesty, particularly about the challenges inherent in romantic relationships and the simple joys of family life.

===Initial Nashville period (1994–2000)===
With much of the contemporary Christian music, or CCM, industry centered in Nashville, Tennessee, the band opted to make a permanent move there. Daugherty and Hindalong were both married with children, and the Christian alternative music scene in Southern California was no longer as active as it was in its mid-‘80s heyday. By contrast, the CCM industry had begun flourishing in Nashville in the early 1990s. Soon after the band&#x27;s arrival, Michaels went into artist management, becoming a successful A&amp;R man in the Christian music industry, eventually serving as the Choir&#x27;s manager as well. Daugherty and Hindalong would musically contribute to, and produce, numerous projects, including the Lost Dogs, and most notably, the &quot;City on a Hill&quot; worship music series.

The Choir&#x27;s first release after arriving in Nashville was &quot;Speckled Bird&quot;, a reworked version of 1993&#x27;s independent &quot;Kissers and Killers&quot;, with five additional songs recorded in Nashville. Their next album, &quot;Free Flying Soul&quot;, released in 1996, would bring the band their most notable industry recognition to that point, as they were awarded a GMA Dove Award for Alternative/Modern Rock Album of the Year. Five years later, the Choir received a nomination for Best Rock Gospel Album at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards for their album, &quot;Flap Your Wings&quot;, released in 2000.

===Journey to independent status (2000-present)===
Despite the belated awards attention, both Hindalong and Daugherty have gone on record numerous times over the years about the limitations of the CCM distribution model, the musical and lyrical expectations from record labels, and their rejection of the term &quot;Christian band&quot; to describe the Choir, as the band never fit the &quot;Christian music&quot; mold, according to Hindalong. &quot;You were either one of two things: you were evangelization or edification,” he explained. “You&#x27;re either edifying the Body, or getting people saved—one of these two functions. To us, music is not a means to an end. It&#x27;s not a tool. We&#x27;re not going to meet your expectations.”

Instead, the band soon realized they were primarily interested in writing music about their everyday life experience, inspired by the music of bands such as Romeo Void, the Church, and My Bloody Valentine. As a result, &quot;we couldn&#x27;t be sold,&quot; Hindalong said. &quot;Whoever promoted the show was not happy with what we did.&quot; Daugherty was more measured in his assessment. &quot;In the early days, we did have some promoters that really liked us,&quot; he clarified. &quot;They just couldn&#x27;t make any money off of us. If they can&#x27;t make a living promoting our show, then they&#x27;re not going to book us.” This led to the band traveling extensively outside of Southern California, playing anywhere they could be booked, whether a bar, a club, a high school auditorium, a coffeehouse, or a state fairground.

Even when the Choir directly addressed matters of faith in their lyrics, the band&#x27;s music rarely gained airplay on mainstream Christian radio. Instead, their music was limited to the small number of Christian radio shows that played a mix of alternative, rock and metal music for only a few hours a week, often after midnight. &quot;How would you care about radio success on a radio station that you, yourself, would not listen to?&quot; Hindalong asked. &quot;We had no chance succeeding commercially, plus we didn&#x27;t want to say what we were expected to say, at least at that point.&quot;

In an attempt to broaden the Choir&#x27;s appeal to Christian audiences, Myrrh had the band open for Russ Taff on his high-profile &quot;The Way Home&quot; tour in 1990. “It was a disaster,&quot; Hindalong said. &quot;The audience overwhelmingly hated us. You could feel the disdain, you know?&quot; Daugherty agreed, and added that, &quot;people would come out and lecture us at our merchandise booth: &#x27;We didn&#x27;t preach enough.&#x27; There would be a couple of nights where people would get up and literally take their youth group out.&quot;

Two years later, the Choir made a concerted effort to target a broader audience by recording a collection of demos that they could shop around to mainstream record labels. After a year and a half of playing clubs—including famous venues like the Troubadour in West Hollywood and CBGB in New York City—the Choir considered changing their name to Kissers and Killers. Although three labels expressed interest (I.R.S. Records, Geffen Records and Fiction Records), they ultimately passed. &quot;We really believed we had to take that chance,” Hindalong said. “Besides, I just wanted to hear my songs on the radio.&quot; Hindalong denied that the band &quot;hated Christian music and would never do it again,&quot; and added, &quot;we&#x27;re not bitter and frustrated; we&#x27;re just trying to broaden our audience.&quot;

Therefore, starting with &quot;Flap Your Wings&quot; in 2000, the band chose to release their music independently on a permanent basis, with several of these albums financed by Michaels. Although members of the Choir would continue to provide production and musical contributions to artists within the CCM industry, and the band would occasionally address Christian themes in their music, the Choir would be frequently identified as an indie rock band from that point forward.

In 2005, after Daugherty and Hindalong had worked with Byrd on a number of other musical projects following the release of &quot;Flap Your Wings&quot;, the Choir officially added Byrd to their lineup to record &quot;O How the Mighty Have Fallen&quot;. The album was also produced by Byrd, and released through Michaels&#x27; new Galaxy21 Music imprint, through which all future Choir albums would be distributed. In August of that same year, this new five-member Choir played the Broken Records Reunion, a 20th anniversary concert at Mariners Church in Irvine, California, along with 4-4-1, Altar Boys, Crumbächer, and Undercover.

====Renewed creative activity (2010)====
After a five-year recording hiatus, the Choir released two full-length studio albums in 2010. In June, the band released &quot;Burning Like the Midnight Sun&quot;, which received positive reviews. Jeff Elbel, in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, called the album &quot;a late-career triumph,&quot; and remarked that it was the band&#x27;s &quot;second exceptional album in a row, and its best since 1990&#x27;s landmark &quot;Circle Slide&quot;.&quot; In November, the band released &quot;de-plumed&quot;, which featured cellist Matt Slocum of Sixpence None the Richer. A collection of acoustic reinterpretations of one song from each of their 12 prior studio albums, it was released shortly after Daugherty and Hindalong embarked on a multi-city acoustic tour as a duo version of the band.

The Choir&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;The Loudest Sound Ever Heard&quot;, was released in May 2012. Later that year, the band toured in celebration of the 25th anniversary of &quot;Chase the Kangaroo&quot;, playing the album in its entirety, followed by a selection of tracks from &quot;Loudest Sound.&quot; For this tour, the band performed as a trio with bassist Chandler. Then in July, the full lineup of the Choir closed out the final gathering of the Cornerstone Festival, in commemoration of their inaugural 1984 performance.

====Shift to crowdfunding (2013)====
From this point forward, the Choir would use Kickstarter and PledgeMusic as their primary ways of recording and releasing new studio albums, re-releases of older studio albums, and solo work by Hindalong and Daugherty. To date, this funding process has generated three studio albums: &quot;Shadow Weaver&quot; (2014), &quot;Bloodshot&quot; (2018), and &quot;Deep Cuts&quot; (2021). Kickstarter stretch goals have contributed six additional releases: the Christmas-themed &quot;Peace, Love &amp; Light&quot; EP (2013), the live albums &quot;Live and on the Wing in Music City&quot; (2014) and &quot;The Livestream Bootleg&quot; (2015), the &quot;unplugged&quot; &quot;Kissers and Killers — The Acoustic Sessions&quot; (2018), the ambient &quot;Words Spoken and Floating on Clouds&quot; (2023), and &quot;7 + 77s = 9: Reinterpretations&quot; (2024), which features newly-recorded versions of earlier work, including a cover version performed by the 77s. Since 2013, the band has remastered and re-released &quot;Chase the Kangaroo&quot;, &quot;Kissers and Killers&quot;, &quot;Free Flying Soul&quot;, &quot;Circle Slide&quot; and &quot;Wide-Eyed Wonder&quot;, following the latter two re-releases with a short tour during which the entire album was played in its entirety. Michael Roe of the 77s filled in on bass for the &quot;Circle Slide&quot; 25th anniversary tour in 2015, while former bassist Spurs returned to the band to perform on the &quot;Wide-Eyed Wonder&quot; anniversary tour in 2017. Crowdfunding also generated Hindalong&#x27;s second solo album &quot;The Warbler&quot; in 2016, and Daugherty&#x27;s third solo release &quot;The Color of Dreams&quot; in 2018 on Lo-Fidelity Records.

====Post-Tim Chandler work (2019-present)====
Long-time bassist Chandler died on October 8, 2018. The following year, the Choir—now a threesome—began releasing non-album singles at the pace of one every other month, starting with a cover of Phil Collins&#x27; &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; and followed by &quot;Mystical World,&quot; their first original composition after Chandler&#x27;s death. In March 2021, the Choir shifted to Patreon where they continue to release new tracks exclusively for subscribers, including a 2021 re-recording of &quot;Render Love&quot; for the &quot;Electric Jesus&quot; film soundtrack. &quot;Deep Cuts&quot;, also released in 2021, was the band&#x27;s first studio album without contributions from Chandler, as bass duties were primarily helmed by session musician Chris Donohue, with two tracks featuring bassist Stephen Mason from Jars of Clay. Donohue also played with the Choir on two new tracks recorded for other projects: &quot;The First Time I Saw Eden,&quot; a cover of a Randy Stonehill song for the 2022 tribute album &quot;There&#x27;s A Rainbow Somewhere: The Songs of Randy Stonehill&quot;, and &quot;Old Man Winter,&quot; for &quot;A Mercyland Christmas&quot;, part of the multi-artist &quot;Mercyland&quot; series of albums led by Phil Madeira.

In 2024, the Choir released a significant amount of new material. In addition to the band&#x27;s monthly single releases to Patreon subscribers, they also released three new studio albums, two EPs and one live album. The first of these was the Kickstarter bonus album &quot;7 + 77s = 9: Reinterpretations&quot;, which was a result of a stretch goal for the second re-release of &quot;Chase the Kangaroo&quot;. The second studio album, &quot;Patreon Sessions&quot;, was a compilation of 12 singles from Patreon made available to non-subscribers. The third and most notable was the album &quot;Translucent&quot;, which was the Choir&#x27;s first ambient instrumental release. The two EPs included &quot;Reinterpretations&quot;, an abridged version of &quot;7 + 77s = 9: Reinterpretations&quot;, and &quot;A Brief History&quot;, featuring five tracks from a Beliefnet YouTube production in 2014. Finally, the band released &quot;Live from District Drugs&quot;, an acoustic performance originally recorded in Rock Island, Illinois in 2012. Both &quot;7 + 77s = 9: Reinterpretations&quot; and &quot;Translucent&quot; received a physical release; the remainder of their 2024 releases were digital-only.

==Other projects==
Each band member has worked on numerous projects outside the Choir.

Daugherty and Hindalong have produced and recorded several worship albums featuring other contemporary Christian music artists, including their own &quot;At the Foot of the Cross&quot; series. &quot;Volume One: Clouds, Rain, Fire&quot; was released in 1992, and the song &quot;Beautiful Scandalous Night&quot; would later be re-recorded by the Choir eight years later for their Grammy-nominated &quot;Flap Your Wings&quot; album. The follow-up, &quot;Volume Two: Seven Last Words of Christ&quot;, was released in 1995. Hindalong would later produce the aforementioned &quot;City on a Hill&quot; series of worship albums in the early 2000s. The lead song from the first album in that series, &quot;God of Wonders,&quot; written by Hindalong and future Choir guitarist Byrd, proved to be one of the most successful contemporary worship songs of the early 2000s, and the album also received a Dove Award for Special Event Album of the Year in 2001.

Daugherty, Hindalong and Michaels have all released solo works, with Daugherty also releasing an instrumental ambient project under the name &quot;Clouds Echo in Blue&quot;. Daugherty is one-half of Kerosene Halo, a duo project with 77s frontman Roe; they have released three albums to date. Since 1991, Daugherty has also been a member of the alternative rock supergroup Lost Dogs, led by Terry Scott Taylor of Daniel Amos and including the 77s&#x27; Roe and Adam Again&#x27;s Eugene; Hindalong would join the group after Eugene&#x27;s death. In 2023, Hindalong would also join with Slocum, Madeira, Jimmy Abegg and Ben Pearson to form The Ascendants and use Kickstarter to launch their debut album, &quot;The Fellowship of the Broken&quot;. The following year, Hindalong performed live with Sixpence None the Richer, providing percussion on the band&#x27;s &quot;We Are Love&quot; tour to support their &quot;Rosemary Hill&quot; EP, which Hindalong produced. Before his death in 2018, Chandler was the bass player for both Daniel Amos and that band&#x27;s side project, the Swirling Eddies, for many years, pre-dating his work with the Choir. Spurs later joined Rachel Rachel and toured with them in the early 1990s. Byrd was a member of Common Children, then later he and bandmate Andrew Thompson formed the post-rock band Hammock in 2005. Byrd has also recorded with his wife Christine Glass as Glassbyrd. Michaels has recorded saxophone for, and performed on tour with, a variety of other artists including Adam Again, Crystal Lewis and Bryan Duncan.

<doc id="91127" wikidata="Q207264" url="?curid=91127" title="Fermat number">
<text>In mathematics, a Fermat number, named after Pierre de Fermat (1607–1665), the first known to have studied them, is a positive integer of the form:formula_1 where &quot;n&quot; is a non-negative integer. The first few Fermat numbers are: 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537, 4294967297, 18446744073709551617, 340282366920938463463374607431768211457, ... .

If 2&quot;k&quot; + 1 is prime and , then &quot;k&quot; itself must be a power of 2, so is a Fermat number; such primes are called Fermat primes. , the only known Fermat primes are , , , , and .

==Basic properties==
The Fermat numbers satisfy the following recurrence relations:

:formula_2

:formula_3

for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1,

:formula_4

:formula_5

for . Each of these relations can be proved by mathematical induction. From the second equation, we can deduce Goldbach&#x27;s theorem (named after Christian Goldbach): no two Fermat numbers share a common integer factor greater than 1. To see this, suppose that and &quot;F&quot;&quot;i&quot; and &quot;F&quot;&quot;j&quot; have a common factor . Then &quot;a&quot; divides both

:formula_6

and &quot;F&quot;&quot;j&quot;; hence &quot;a&quot; divides their difference, 2. Since , this forces . This is a contradiction, because each Fermat number is clearly odd. As a corollary, we obtain another proof of the infinitude of the prime numbers: for each &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;, choose a prime factor &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;; then the sequence is an infinite sequence of distinct primes.

===Further properties===
* No Fermat prime can be expressed as the difference of two &quot;p&quot;th powers, where &quot;p&quot; is an odd prime.
* With the exception of &quot;F&quot;0 and &quot;F&quot;1, the last decimal digit of a Fermat number is 7.
* The sum of the reciprocals of all the Fermat numbers is irrational. (Solomon W. Golomb, 1963)

==Primality==
Fermat numbers and Fermat primes were first studied by Pierre de Fermat, who conjectured that all Fermat numbers are prime. Indeed, the first five Fermat numbers &quot;F&quot;0, ..., &quot;F&quot;4 are easily shown to be prime. Fermat&#x27;s conjecture was refuted by Leonhard Euler in 1732 when he showed that

:formula_7

Euler proved that every factor of &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; must have the form (later improved to by Lucas) for .

That 641 is a factor of &quot;F&quot;5 can be deduced from the equalities 641 = 27 × 5 + 1 and 641 = 24 + 54. It follows from the first equality that 27 × 5 ≡ −1 (mod 641) and therefore (raising to the fourth power) that 228 × 54 ≡ 1 (mod 641). On the other hand, the second equality implies that 54 ≡ −24 (mod 641). These congruences imply that 232 ≡ −1 (mod 641).

Fermat was probably aware of the form of the factors later proved by Euler, so it seems curious that he failed to follow through on the straightforward calculation to find the factor. One common explanation is that Fermat made a computational mistake.

There are no other known Fermat primes &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; with , but little is known about Fermat numbers for large &quot;n&quot;. In fact, each of the following is an open problem:
* Is &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; composite for all ?
* Are there infinitely many Fermat primes? (Eisenstein 1844)
* Are there infinitely many composite Fermat numbers?
* Does a Fermat number exist that is not square-free?

, it is known that &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; is composite for , although of these, complete factorizations of &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; are known only for , and there are no known prime factors for and . The largest Fermat number known to be composite is &quot;F&quot;18233954, and its prime factor was discovered in October 2020.

===Heuristic arguments===
Heuristics suggest that &quot;F&quot;4 is the last Fermat prime.

The prime number theorem implies that a random integer in a suitable interval around &quot;N&quot; is prime with probability 1/ln &quot;N&quot;. If one uses the heuristic that a Fermat number is prime with the same probability as a random integer of its size, and that &quot;F&quot;5, ..., &quot;F&quot;32 are composite, then the expected number of Fermat primes beyond &quot;F&quot;4 (or equivalently, beyond &quot;F&quot;32) should be 
:formula_8
One may interpret this number as an upper bound for the probability that a Fermat prime beyond &quot;F&quot;4 exists.

This argument is not a rigorous proof. For one thing, it assumes that Fermat numbers behave &quot;randomly&quot;, but the factors of Fermat numbers have special properties. Boklan and Conway published a more precise analysis suggesting that the probability that there is another Fermat prime is less than one in a billion.

Anders Bjorn and Hans Riesel estimated the number of square factors of Fermat numbers from &quot;F&quot;5 onward as
:formula_9
in other words, there are unlikely to be any non-squarefree Fermat numbers, and in general square factors of formula_10 are very rare for large &quot;n&quot;.

===Equivalent conditions===
Let formula_11 be the &quot;n&quot;th Fermat number. Pépin&#x27;s test states that for ,

:formula_12 is prime if and only if formula_13

The expression formula_14 can be evaluated modulo formula_12 by repeated squaring. This makes the test a fast polynomial-time algorithm. But Fermat numbers grow so rapidly that only a handful of them can be tested in a reasonable amount of time and space.

There are some tests for numbers of the form , such as factors of Fermat numbers, for primality.

:Proth&#x27;s theorem (1878). Let with odd . If there is an integer &quot;a&quot; such that
:: formula_16
:then formula_17 is prime. Conversely, if the above congruence does not hold, and in addition
:: formula_18 (See Jacobi symbol)
:then formula_17 is composite.

If , then the above Jacobi symbol is always equal to −1 for , and this special case of Proth&#x27;s theorem is known as Pépin&#x27;s test. Although Pépin&#x27;s test and Proth&#x27;s theorem have been implemented on computers to prove the compositeness of some Fermat numbers, neither test gives a specific nontrivial factor. In fact, no specific prime factors are known for and 24.

==Factorization==
Because of Fermat numbers&#x27; size, it is difficult to factorize or even to check primality. Pépin&#x27;s test gives a necessary and sufficient condition for primality of Fermat numbers, and can be implemented by modern computers. The elliptic curve method is a fast method for finding small prime divisors of numbers. Distributed computing project &quot;Fermatsearch&quot; has found some factors of Fermat numbers. Yves Gallot&#x27;s proth.exe has been used to find factors of large Fermat numbers. Édouard Lucas, improving Euler&#x27;s above-mentioned result, proved in 1878 that every factor of the Fermat number formula_12, with &quot;n&quot; at least 2, is of the form formula_21 (see Proth number), where &quot;k&quot; is a positive integer. By itself, this makes it easy to prove the primality of the known Fermat primes.

Factorizations of the first 12 Fermat numbers are:

, only &quot;F&quot;0 to &quot;F&quot;11 have been completely factored. The distributed computing project Fermat Search is searching for new factors of Fermat numbers. The set of all Fermat factors is (or, sorted, ) in OEIS.

The following factors of Fermat numbers were known before 1950 (since then, digital computers have helped find more factors):

, 371 prime factors of Fermat numbers are known, and 324 Fermat numbers are known to be composite. Several new Fermat factors are found each year.

==Pseudoprimes and Fermat numbers==
Like composite numbers of the form 2&quot;p&quot; − 1, every composite Fermat number is a strong pseudoprime to base 2. This is because all strong pseudoprimes to base 2 are also Fermat pseudoprimes – i.e.,

:formula_22

for all Fermat numbers.

In 1904, Cipolla showed that the product of at least two distinct prime or composite Fermat numbers formula_23 formula_24 will be a Fermat pseudoprime to base 2 if and only if formula_25.

==Other theorems about Fermat numbers==

 \right)^{2} \equiv 2^{1+2^{n-1}} \pmod p.&lt;/math&gt;

Since an odd power of 2 is a quadratic residue modulo &quot;p&quot;, so is 2 itself.

A Fermat number cannot be a perfect number or part of a pair of amicable numbers. 

The series of reciprocals of all prime divisors of Fermat numbers is convergent. 

If is prime and formula_26, there exists an integer &quot;m&quot; such that . The equation

holds in that case.

Let the largest prime factor of the Fermat number &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; be &quot;P&quot;(&quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;). Then,
:formula_27 

==Relationship to constructible polygons==

Carl Friedrich Gauss developed the theory of Gaussian periods in his &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; and formulated a sufficient condition for the constructibility of regular polygons. Gauss stated that this condition was also necessary, but never published a proof. Pierre Wantzel gave a full proof of necessity in 1837. The result is known as the Gauss–Wantzel theorem:

: An &quot;n&quot;-sided regular polygon can be constructed with compass and straightedge if and only if &quot;n&quot; is either a power of 2 or the product of a power of 2 and distinct Fermat primes: in other words, if and only if &quot;n&quot; is of the form or , where &quot;k&quot;, &quot;s&quot; are nonnegative integers and the &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; are distinct Fermat primes.

A positive integer &quot;n&quot; is of the above form if and only if its totient &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is a power of 2.

==Applications of Fermat numbers==
===Pseudorandom number generation===
Fermat primes are particularly useful in generating pseudo-random sequences of numbers in the range 1, ..., &quot;N&quot;, where &quot;N&quot; is a power of 2. The most common method used is to take any seed value between 1 and , where &quot;P&quot; is a Fermat prime. Now multiply this by a number &quot;A&quot;, which is greater than the square root of &quot;P&quot; and is a primitive root modulo &quot;P&quot; (i.e., it is not a quadratic residue). Then take the result modulo &quot;P&quot;. The result is the new value for the RNG.
: formula_28 (see linear congruential generator)
This is useful in computer science, since most data structures have members with 2&quot;X&quot; possible values. For example, a byte has 256 (28) possible values (0–255). Therefore, to fill a byte or bytes with random values, a random number generator that produces values 1–256 can be used, the byte taking the output value −1. Very large Fermat primes are of particular interest in data encryption for this reason. This method produces only pseudorandom values, as after repetitions, the sequence repeats. A poorly chosen multiplier can result in the sequence repeating sooner than .

==Generalized Fermat numbers==
Numbers of the form formula_29 with &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; any coprime integers, , are called generalized Fermat numbers. An odd prime &quot;p&quot; is a generalized Fermat number if and only if &quot;p&quot; is congruent to 1 (mod 4). (Here we consider only the case , so \!+ 1&lt;/math&gt;}} is not a counterexample.)

An example of a probable prime of this form is 200262144 + 119262144 (found by Kellen Shenton).

By analogy with the ordinary Fermat numbers, it is common to write generalized Fermat numbers of the form formula_30 as &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;a&quot;). In this notation, for instance, the number 100,000,001 would be written as &quot;F&quot;3(10). In the following we shall restrict ourselves to primes of this form, formula_30, such primes are called &quot;Fermat primes base &quot;a&quot;&quot;. Of course, these primes exist only if &quot;a&quot; is even.

If we require , then Landau&#x27;s fourth problem asks if there are infinitely many generalized Fermat primes &quot;Fn&quot;(&quot;a&quot;).

===Generalized Fermat primes of the form F&quot;n&quot;(&quot;a&quot;)===
Because of the ease of proving their primality, generalized Fermat primes have become in recent years a topic for research within the field of number theory. Many of the largest known primes today are generalized Fermat primes.

Generalized Fermat numbers can be prime only for even , because if is odd then every generalized Fermat number will be divisible by 2. The smallest prime number formula_32 with formula_33 is formula_34, or 3032 + 1. Besides, we can define &quot;half generalized Fermat numbers&quot; for an odd base, a half generalized Fermat number to base &quot;a&quot; (for odd &quot;a&quot;) is formula_35, and it is also to be expected that there will be only finitely many half generalized Fermat primes for each odd base.

In this list, the generalized Fermat numbers (formula_32) to an even are formula_37, for odd , they are formula_38. If is a perfect power with an odd exponent , then all generalized Fermat number can be algebraic factored, so they cannot be prime.

See for even bases up to 1000, and for odd bases. For the smallest number formula_39 such that formula_32 is prime, see .

For the smallest even base such that formula_32 is prime, see .

The generalized Fermat prime &quot;F&quot;14(71) is the largest known generalized Fermat prime in bases &quot;b&quot; ≤ 1000, it is proven prime by elliptic curve primality proving.

The smallest even base &quot;b&quot; such that &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) = &quot;b&quot;2&quot;n&quot; + 1 (for given &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, ...) is prime are

:2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 30, 102, 120, 278, 46, 824, 150, 1534, 30406, 67234, 70906, 48594, 62722, 24518, 75898, 919444, ... 

The smallest odd base &quot;b&quot; such that &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) = (&quot;b&quot;2&quot;n&quot; + 1)/2 (for given &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, ...) is prime (or probable prime) are

:3, 3, 3, 9, 3, 3, 3, 113, 331, 513, 827, 799, 3291, 5041, 71, 220221, 23891, 11559, 187503, 35963, ... 

Conversely, the smallest &quot;k&quot; such that (2&quot;n&quot;)&quot;k&quot; + 1 (for given &quot;n&quot;) is prime are

:1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, ... (The next term is unknown) (also see and )

A more elaborate theory can be used to predict the number of bases for which formula_32 will be prime for fixed formula_39. The number of generalized Fermat primes can be roughly expected to halve as formula_39 is increased by 1.

===Generalized Fermat primes of the form Fn(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)===
It is also possible to construct generalized Fermat primes of the form formula_10. As in the case where &quot;b&quot;=1, numbers of this form will always be divisible by 2 if &quot;a+b&quot; is even, but it is still possible to define generalized half-Fermat primes of this type. For the smallest prime of the form formula_46 (for odd formula_47), see also .

===Largest known generalized Fermat primes===
The following is a list of the ten largest known generalized Fermat primes. The whole top-10 is discovered by participants in the PrimeGrid project.

<doc id="91130" wikidata="Q2130817" url="?curid=91130" title="Randy Stonehill">
<text>Randall Evan Stonehill (born March 12, 1952) is an American singer and songwriter from Stockton, California, best known as one of the pioneers of contemporary Christian music. His music is primarily folk rock in the style of James Taylor, but some of his albums have focused on new wave, pop, pop rock, roots rock, and children&#x27;s music.

==Early life==
Randy Stonehill was born in Stockton, California. the son of Leonard N. Stonehill and his wife, Pauline Correia and is the younger brother of Jeffrey Dean Stonehill.

He graduated from Leigh High School, in San Jose, California, then moved to Los Angeles where he stayed with Christian rock singer, Larry Norman.

== Career ==
Stonehill&#x27;s first album, &quot;Born Twice&quot; was released in 1971, with financial help from Pat Boone. The album—one side a live performance, the other recorded in a studio—was recorded for a mere $US 800, and according to Stonehill, &quot;sounds like every penny of it.&quot;

A year later, Stonehill made his film acting debut in &quot;The Blob&quot; sequel, &quot;Beware! The Blob&quot; (also known as &quot;Son of Blob&quot;), with Cindy Williams, in which he performed the unreleased song &quot;Captain Coke&quot;. He also made a cameo appearance in the 1973 Billy Graham film &quot;Time to Run&quot;, performing his song &quot;I Love You&quot;.

In 1976, Stonehill released the Larry Norman-produced &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot;, for which Andy Johns did the engineering. This became a landmark album for the songwriter and was voted the &quot;third most important contemporary Christian album&quot; in a mid-1980s poll of Christian music critics.

In the late 1970s, Stonehill joined forces with rock band Daniel Amos for the &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Randy Tour&quot;. Daniel Amos went on to be Stonehill&#x27;s band for his next two releases, and Stonehill later provided backing vocals on a number of Daniel Amos&#x27; projects.

1983 saw Stonehill&#x27;s popular album &quot;Equator&quot; debut and go very rapidly out-of-print. The album is still widely sought-after in both vinyl and cassette form. No re-releases on CD were issued.

1984&#x27;s &quot;Celebrate This Heartbeat&quot; teamed Stonehill with longtime friend Phil Keaggy for the song &quot;Who Will Save The Children?&quot; In 1989 they formed The Keaggy/Stonehill Band with Daniel Amos bassist Tim Chandler and The Swirling Eddies&#x27; David Raven on drums. Keaggy and Stonehill also teamed up several other times, both live in concert and in the studio. They recorded and performed as Phil Keaggy and Sunday&#x27;s Child in 1988. They also joined singer Margaret Becker, drummer Joe English (former member of Paul McCartney and Wings) and several others that same year for the Compassion All Star Band&#x27;s album &quot;One by One&quot;.

==Marriages and family==
Stonehill has been married three times, to Sarah Mae Finch, Sandra Jean Warner, and Leslie Sealander, with the first two marriages ending in divorce. His second marriage produced one daughter, Heather. Finch later married Larry Norman.

<text>Tonio K. (born Vladamir Steven M. Krikorian, July 4, 1950) is an American singer/songwriter who has released eight albums. His songs have been recorded by Al Green, Aaron Neville, Burt Bacharach, Bonnie Raitt, Chicago, Wynonna Judd and Vanessa Williams, among many others. His song &quot;16 Tons of Monkeys,&quot; co-written with guitarist Steve Schiff, was featured in the 1992 Academy Award-winning short film &quot;Session Man&quot;. He worked with Bacharach and hip-hop impresario Dr. Dre on Bacharach&#x27;s &quot;At This Time,&quot; which won the Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Recording in 2005.

== Recording and performing artist ==
As a teenager, Krikorian, along with friends Alan Shapazian, Steve Olson, Nick van Maarth, and Duane Scott, formed a surf-funk/psychedelic-punk band called The Raik&#x27;s Progress, which recorded a single for Liberty Records, released in 1966. Known for their Dadaist-inspired between-song routines, one reviewer described their performance while opening for Buffalo Springfield at San Francisco&#x27;s Fillmore Auditorium as being like &quot;the Three Stooges playing strip poker with Iggy and the Stooges.&quot; A full-length album by the band, &quot;Sewer Rat Love Chant,&quot; was eventually issued on Sundazed Records in 2003.

In the early 1970s, Krikorian recorded two albums with Buddy Holly&#x27;s original band, The Crickets. The group consisted of founding members J.I. Allison and Sonny Curtis, plus Rick Grech (Blind Faith, Traffic) and Albert Lee (Heads, Hands and Feet, Eric Clapton) and the Raik&#x27;s Nick van Maarth who would later join California rock ensemble Wha-Koo. &quot;Remnants&quot; (1973) and &quot;A Long Way from Lubbock&quot; (1974) were produced by long-time Holly and Cricket cohort, Bob Montgomery. In 2004, Krikorian reunited with the Crickets for a track on their star-studded (Eric Clapton, Graham Nash, Phil Everly) album, &quot;The Crickets and Their Buddies,&quot; singing lead on the Holly classic, &quot;Not Fade Away.&quot;

In 1978, Krikorian went solo with &quot;Life in the Foodchain&quot; on Irving Azoff&#x27;s Full Moon/Epic label. Adopting the moniker Tonio K., a reference to the writings of Kafka and Thomas Mann, he was hailed as America&#x27;s answer to Britain&#x27;s Angry Young Men (Elvis Costello, Joe Jackson, Graham Parker) and the &quot;funniest serious songwriter in America.&quot; The record was produced by Rob Fraboni (The Band, Bob Dylan, Joe Cocker) and featured a supporting cast that included Earl Slick, Garth Hudson, Dick Dale and Albert Lee. It was also the first Pop/Rock record to feature the percussive sounds of an AK-47 firing live ammunition. The album debuted on L.A. radio station KROQ and garnered much critical acclaim. Steve Simels at &quot;Stereo Review&quot; proclaimed it &quot;the greatest album ever recorded&quot; which helped establish K. as an artist to watch.

K.&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Amerika&quot;, was released in 1980 via Clive Davis&#x27;s Arista Records. Filled with literary and political references, the album was hailed as &quot;Punk for academics&quot; and once again pronounced by Simels to be &quot;the greatest record ever recorded&quot; (as was every ensuing Tonio K. disc).

After a move to Capitol Records in 1982, K. recorded a five-song 12-inch EP &quot;La Bomba,&quot; a live-in-the-studio album produced by Carter (Motels, Tina Turner, Paula Cole). Recorded in the famous Capitol Studio B, it featured K.&#x27;s touring band: George “Geo” Conner (guitar), Alfredo Acosta Alwag (drums), and Enrique “Eric” Gotthelf (bass). The song &quot;Mars Needs Women&quot; also appears on this EP.

Tonio next released &quot;Romeo Unchained&quot; on What?/A&amp;M Records. Hailed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine as “the best Bob Dylan album since Dylan himself lost interest in the Pop song form,” the album landed on numerous critics’ Top 10 Albums of the Year lists. Recorded during 1985 and 1986, it was produced, variously, by Rick Neigher, Bob Rose (Julian Lennon) and T Bone Burnett (Counting Crows, Wallflowers, Robert Plant &amp; Alison Krauss). The musicians on these recordings included Neigher (on many instruments), Rose, Burnett, Peter Banks (Yes), David Mansfield, David Miner, David Raven, Tim Pierce, Tim Chandler, and Rob Watson.
&quot;Notes From The Lost Civilization,&quot; again on What?/A&amp;M, followed in 1988. It was concurrently released on the Word label, a gospel/Christian music subsidiary of A&amp;M; the Word version of the release did not include the song &quot;What Women Want&quot;(presumably for the lyric &quot; . . . they want sex, yeah that&#x27;s true&quot; although the point of the song is that women want love). Produced by Tonio K. and David Miner, with T Bone Burnett serving as Executive Producer, the all-star cast of supporting musicians included Burnett, Booker T. Jones on Hammond B-3, Jim Keltner, Raymond Pounds and Alex Acuña on drums and percussion, James Jamerson, Jr. and David Miner on bass, and Charlie Sexton and Jack Sherman on additional guitars. The video for the single, &quot;Without Love,&quot; marked Tonio&#x27;s first airplay on MTV.

&quot;Olé&quot; was Tonio K.&#x27;s final record for A&amp;M. Recorded in 1989 and 1990, it didn&#x27;t see release until 1997 on Gadfly Records. (The reasons for this are well documented in the liner notes to the CD.) It was produced by T Bone Burnett and David Miner with a core band consisting of Marc Ribot, Booker T. Jones, David Raven and Bruce Thomas (Attractions). Additional guitarists included Jack Sherman, Charlie Sexton, Rusty Anderson, Los Lobos&#x27; David Hidalgo and The Replacements&#x27; Paul Westerberg. Although &quot;Olé&quot; was K.&#x27;s last major label recording, several other compilation and live CDs have been issued (see discography below).

== Songwriter ==
Tonio K. continued as a performing singer/songwriter into the 1990s but gradually withdrew from live concerts and focused more on crafting songs with and for other artists. His biggest commercial success, &quot;Love Is,&quot; was co-written with long-time collaborator John Keller, composer Michael Caruso and recorded by Vanessa Williams and Brian McKnight. It was a #1 Pop and AC (Adult Contemporary) radio single and one of the most-played songs of 1993. K. has publicly questioned the validity of Caruso&#x27;s credit on the recording-- though without using his name-- and appears validated only by virtue of his refusing to name Caruso specifically and by not having given up any of his financial stake in the song, for which Keller apparently offered a percentage of his own to Caruso. (K. has been quoted as saying that his first choice for vocalist on the song was the famously gruff-voiced Tom Waits). He also co-wrote, with Bob Thiele, Jr. and John Shanks, the Bonnie Raitt AC hit, &quot;You.”

Tonio and close friend Charlie Sexton have written many (mostly unreleased) songs since Sexton first recorded K.&#x27;s &quot;Impressed&quot; and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Belong Here&quot; on his debut album, &quot;Pictures for Pleasure,&quot; in 1985. &quot;Graceland (Never Been To),&quot; opening track to the Quentin Tarantino-written and Tony Scott-directed movie &quot;True Romance,&quot; is one of their more notable, albeit obscure, cuts. K. was involved in writing six songs on Sexton&#x27;s Arc Angels debut on Geffen Records. He also co-wrote with Sexton for his &quot;Under the Wishing Tree&quot; release on MCA.

Tonio K. has written lyrics for both Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols and Burt Bacharach. In addition to several years of collaborating with Bacharach, Tonio co-wrote eight of the nine vocal tracks on the aforementioned Grammy-winning CD, &quot;At This Time.&quot;

Tonio K. film credits include &quot;Nobody Lives Without Love,&quot; co-written with musician/writer/producer Larry Klein (Joni Mitchell, Herbie Hancock) and featured on the multi-platinum-selling soundtrack to &quot;Batman Forever&quot;; the quasi-Disco semi-hit, &quot;I&#x27;m Supposed To Have Sex With You,&quot; from the Carl Reiner film &quot;Summer School;&quot; &quot;Stop The Clock,&quot; co-written with T Bone Burnett for the early Vince Vaughn/Joaquin Phoenix/Janeane Garofalo vehicle, &quot;Clay Pigeons&quot;; the above-mentioned &quot;Graceland&quot; from &quot;True Romance&quot;; and his song &quot;The Tuff Do What?&quot; from 1985&#x27;s movie &quot;Real Genius&quot;. 2002&#x27;s Van Wilder featuring Ryan Reynolds... song called Okay written with the band Swirl 360.

Tonio K.&#x27;s first known &quot;cover&quot; was a song called &quot;Hey John,&quot; recorded by Johnny Rivers in 1972, but never released. In addition to the cuts mentioned above, he has written with and for Brian Wilson, J.I. Allison, The Crickets, Al Green, Bette Midler, The Pointer Sisters, Tanya Tucker, Diane Schuur, Percy Sledge, Phoebe Snow, Jules Shear, The Runaways, Patty Smyth, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, and Italian superstar Richard Cocciante. Recent covers include songs by Irma Thomas (&quot;What Can I Do?&quot; co-written with Burt Bacharach) on her Rounder Records CD &quot;Simply Grand&quot; and several songs co-written with pedal steel prodigy Robert Randolph for his CD &quot;We Walk This Road&quot;, produced by T Bone Burnett.

Musician &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic called Tonio K. one of his &quot;favorite artists&quot;.

<doc id="91133" wikidata="Q846679" url="?curid=91133" title="The Karate Kid">
<text>The Karate Kid is a 1984 American martial arts drama film written by Robert Mark Kamen and directed by John G. Avildsen. It is the first installment in the &quot;Karate Kid&quot; franchise, and stars Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita, Elisabeth Shue, and William Zabka. &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; follows the story of Daniel LaRusso (Macchio), an Italian-American teenager from New Jersey who moves with his widowed mother to the Reseda neighborhood of Los Angeles. There, LaRusso encounters harassment from his new bullies, one of whom is Johnny Lawrence (Zabka), the ex-boyfriend of LaRusso&#x27;s love interest, Ali Mills (Shue). LaRusso is taught karate by a handyman and war veteran named Mr. Miyagi (Morita) to help LaRusso defend himself and compete in a karate tournament against his bullies.

Kamen was approached by Columbia Pictures to compose a film similar to Avildsen&#x27;s previous success &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976), after Columbia signed the director. Kamen drew inspiration from the real-life events of an eight-year-old Tum Pai student&#x27;s story in Hawaii when writing the film. As a result, he maintained strong opinions regarding cast, and petitioned heavily for Morita&#x27;s inclusion. Preparations for the film began immediately after the final edit of the script was complete, and casting took place between April and June 1983. Principal photography began on October 31, 1983, in Los Angeles and was completed by December 16. The film was Macchio&#x27;s second major film role, following &quot;The Outsiders&quot; (1983).

&quot;The Karate Kid&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on June 22, 1984. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised the action sequences, writing, themes, performances, and music. The film was also a commercial success, grossing over worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 1984 and Hollywood&#x27;s biggest sleeper hit of the year. The film revitalized the acting career of Morita, who was previously known mostly for comedic roles, and it earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The film subsequently launched a media franchise and is credited for popularizing karate in the United States.

==Plot==
In 1984, 17-year-old Daniel LaRusso and his mother Lucille move from Newark, New Jersey, to Reseda, Los Angeles, California. Their apartment&#x27;s handyman is an eccentric, but kind and humble Okinawan immigrant named Mr. Nariyoshi Miyagi.

At a beach party the next day, Daniel meets and befriends Ali Mills, a high school cheerleader from Encino, drawing the attention of her arrogant ex-boyfriend Johnny Lawrence, a black belt and the top student from the Cobra Kai dojo, training in an aggressive form of karate. Johnny and his Cobra Kai gang (Bobby Brown, Tommy, Jimmy, and Dutch) continually bully Daniel. On Halloween, after Daniel sprays water on Johnny with a hose as payback, Johnny and his gang pursue Daniel down the street and brutally beat him, until Mr. Miyagi intervenes and easily defeats them.

Amazed, Daniel asks Mr. Miyagi to teach him karate. He declines but agrees to accompany Daniel to Cobra Kai to resolve the conflict. They meet the sensei, John Kreese, an ex-Special Forces Vietnam veteran who callously dismisses the peace offering. Miyagi then proposes that Daniel enter the Under 18 All-Valley Karate Championships, thereby compete against Kreese’s students on equal terms, and requests that the bullying cease while he trains. Kreese agrees to the terms but warns that if Daniel does not show up for the tournament, the harassment will continue for both of them.

Daniel&#x27;s training starts with days of menial chores that seemingly only serve to make him Miyagi&#x27;s slave. When he becomes frustrated, Miyagi demonstrates that repetition of these chores have helped him to learn defensive blocks through muscle memory. Their bond develops, and Miyagi opens up to Daniel about his life, including the dual loss of his wife and son in childbirth at the Manzanar internment camp while he was serving with the 442nd Infantry Regiment during World War II in Europe, where he received the Medal of Honor.

Through Mr. Miyagi&#x27;s teaching, Daniel learns not only karate but also important life lessons such as the importance of personal balance, reflected in the principle that martial arts training is as much about training the spirit as the body. Daniel applies the life lessons Miyagi has taught him to strengthen his relationship with Ali. On Daniel&#x27;s 18th birthday, Miyagi gives Daniel a Karate gi for the tournament and one of his classic cars.

At the tournament, Daniel surprises the audience and competitors by reaching the semi-finals. Johnny advances to the finals after scoring three unanswered points against Darryl Vidal. Kreese instructs his second-best student, Bobby Brown, one of his more compassionate students and the least vicious of Daniel&#x27;s tormentors, to disable Daniel with an illegal attack to the knee. Bobby reluctantly does so, severely injuring Daniel and getting himself disqualified in the process.

Daniel is taken to the locker room, where the physician determines that he cannot continue. However, Daniel believes that if he quits, his tormentors will have gotten the best of him. As a result, Daniel convinces Miyagi to use a pain suppression technique to help him continue. As Johnny is about to be declared the winner by default, Daniel returns to fight. The match is a seesaw battle, with neither able to break through the other&#x27;s defense.

The match is halted when Daniel uses a scissor-leg technique to trip Johnny, delivering a blow to the back of his head and giving Johnny a nosebleed. Kreese directs Johnny to sweep Daniel&#x27;s injured leg – an unethical move. Johnny looks horrified at the order, but reluctantly agrees. As the match resumes and the score is tied 2–2, Johnny seizes Daniel&#x27;s leg and deals a vicious elbow, doing further damage.

Daniel, standing with difficulty, assumes the &quot;Crane&quot; stance, a technique he observed Mr. Miyagi performing on a beach. Johnny lunges toward Daniel, who jumps and executes a front kick to Johnny&#x27;s face, scoring the tournament-winning point and becoming the new champion. Johnny, having gained newfound respect for his nemesis, presents the trophy to Daniel himself, as Daniel is carried off by an enthusiastic crowd while Miyagi looks on proudly.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;The Karate Kid&quot; is a semi-autobiographical story based on the life of its screenwriter, Robert Mark Kamen. At age 17, after the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, Kamen was beaten up by a gang of bullies. He thus began to study martial arts in order to defend himself. Kamen was unhappy with his first teacher who taught martial arts as a tool for violence and revenge. So he moved on to study Okinawan Gōjū-ryū karate under a Japanese teacher who did not speak English but had been a student of Chōjun Miyagi.

As a Hollywood screenwriter, Kamen was mentored by Frank Price who told him that producer Jerry Weintraub had optioned a news article about the young child of a single mother who had earned a black belt to defend himself against the neighborhood bullies. Kamen then combined his own life story with the news article and used both to create the screenplay for &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;. Additionally, given John G. Avildsen&#x27;s involvement with both films, Sylvester Stallone often joked with Kamen that the writer had &quot;ripped off&quot; the &quot;Rocky&quot; films with &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;.

DC Comics owns a character called Karate Kid, a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes. The filmmakers received permission from DC Comics in 1984 to use the title for the film and its sequels.

===Casting===
A number of actors were considered for the part of Daniel, including Sean Penn, Robert Downey Jr., Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer, Emilio Estevez, Nicolas Cage, Anthony Edwards, C. Thomas Howell, Tom Cruise, Eric Stoltz and D.B. Sweeney. Ralph Macchio was ultimately cast on the strength of his performance as Johnny Cade in &quot;The Outsiders&quot; (1983). Macchio has stated that his performance as Johnny influenced the development of Daniel LaRusso in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;.

Macchio later commented that the character was originally named Danny Weber, but was later changed to LaRusso.

The studio originally wanted the role of Mr. Miyagi to be played by Toshiro Mifune, who had appeared in the Akira Kurosawa films &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950), &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954), and &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; (1958), but the actor did not speak English. Pat Morita later auditioned for the role but was rejected for the part due to his close association with stand-up comedy and with his character Arnold on the sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot;. Afterwards, Morita grew a beard and patterned his accent after his uncle, which led to him being cast in the role.

Crispin Glover was considered for the role of Johnny, but the studio later opted for William Zabka. After his audition, Zabka saw Macchio, who noted that Zabka scared him during his audition to the studio. When he was cast, Zabka was a wrestler with no previous training in karate. Zabka later recalled his audition, saying he was told to act out a scene from the script, while wearing a headband. He walked up to and grabbed John Avildsen, and said &quot;Watch your mouth asshole!&quot; He then exited the room and came back in, took his headband off and said that it was Johnny, not Billy. Avildsen then asked him about his age, and his height when compared to karate kid. Zabka responded, &quot;Bruce Lee was smaller than Kareem Abdul Jabbar, but he beat him&quot; in reference to &quot;Game of Death&quot;, to which Avildsen confirmed it. Avildsen was then convinced to cast Zabka for the role.

Helen Hunt and Demi Moore were also considered for the role of Ali, but Elisabeth Shue was cast based partly on a &quot;Burger King&quot; commercial that became widely popular in the early 1980s. The film marks the debut roles of both Zabka and Shue. Late in production, Valerie Harper was considered for the role of Lucille, but the studio later instated Randee Heller for the role.

===Filming===
Filming began on October 31, 1983, and wrapped on December 16.

The film&#x27;s fight choreographer for the combat scenes was Pat E. Johnson, a Tang Soo Do karate black belt who had previously been featured in Bruce Lee&#x27;s American–Hong Kong martial arts film &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973) and worked with Chuck Norris at American Tang Soo Do martial arts schools. Johnson also makes an appearance as the referee in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;. Pat Morita&#x27;s stunt double for Mr. Miyagi, Fumio Demura, is also a karate black belt who had previously worked with Bruce Lee, who learnt some nunchaku techniques from Demura.

==Soundtrack==
The musical score for &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; was composed by Bill Conti, a frequent collaborator of director John G. Avildsen since their initial pairing on &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976). The instrumental score was orchestrated by Jack Eskew and featured pan flute solos by Gheorge Zamfir. On March 12, 2007, Varèse Sarabande released all four &quot;Karate Kid&quot; scores in a 4-CD box set limited to 2,500 copies worldwide.

A soundtrack album was released in 1984 by Casablanca Records containing many of the contemporary songs featured in the film. Of particular note is Joe Esposito&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re the Best&quot;, featured during the tournament montage near the end of the first film. Originally written for &quot;Rocky III&quot; (1982), &quot;You&#x27;re the Best&quot; was rejected by Sylvester Stallone in favor of Survivor&#x27;s hit song &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot;. Coincidentally, Survivor also performed the main theme (&quot;The Moment of Truth&quot; Music &amp; Lyrics: Bill Conti, Dennis Lambert, Peter Beckett) for the movie.

Bananarama&#x27;s 1984 hit song &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; also made its U.S. debut in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; but was excluded from the film&#x27;s soundtrack album. Other songs featured in the film but left off the album include &quot;Please Answer Me&quot; performed by Broken Edge and &quot;The Ride&quot; performed by The Matches.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was a commercial success, grossing in the United States and Canada to become one of the highest-grossing films of 1984 and Hollywood&#x27;s biggest sleeper hit of the year. Following the release of &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;, &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; re-releases in 2018 and 2019 grossed a further $400,529 in the United States and Canada, bringing its domestic total to .

In the United Kingdom, the film topped the box office for two weeks and grossed £2,960,939 (). By 1989, the film had grossed worldwide. Between 2018 and 2020, the film grossed a further $400,529 in the United States and Canada, and $42,257 in the United Kingdom bringing its worldwide total to .

The film sold an estimated 27,072,000 tickets in the United States and Canada. The film also sold tickets in Spain, 1,888,845 tickets in France and Germany, and 137,217 tickets in the South Korean capital of Seoul, adding up to tickets sold in the United States, Canada, Spain, France, Germany and Seoul.

===Critical response===

On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 6.83/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Utterly predictable and wholly of its time, but warm, sincere, and difficult to resist, due in large part to Morita and Macchio&#x27;s relaxed chemistry.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

On its release, Roger Ebert called the film one of the year&#x27;s best, gave it four stars out of four, and described it as an exciting, sweet-tempered, heart-warming story with interesting friendships in the film. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also gave a positive review. &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; ranked #40 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s list of the 50 Best High School Movies.

&quot;The Karate Kid&quot; launched the career of Macchio, who would turn into a teen idol featured on the covers of magazines such as &quot;Tiger Beat&quot;. It revitalized the acting career of Morita, previously known mostly for his comedic role as Arnold on &quot;Happy Days&quot;, who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Miyagi. Morita reprised his role in three subsequent sequels, while Macchio returned for two.

Upon release of the 2010 remake, Dana Stevens wrote: &quot;The 1984 original ... may have seemed like a standard-issue inspirational sports picture at the time, but (as with another box-office hit of the same year, &quot;The Terminator&quot;), a generation of remove reveals what a well-crafted movie it actually was. Rewatched today, the original &quot;Kid&quot;, directed by &quot;Rocky&quot;″s John G. Avildsen, feels smart and fresh, with a wealth of small character details and a leisurely middle section that explores the boy&#x27;s developing respect for his teacher.&quot;

===Accolades===

American Film Institute

* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Cheers – #98

=== Home media ===
In the United Kingdom, it was watched by viewers on television in 2017, making it the year&#x27;s tenth most-watched film on UK multichannel television.

===Merchandise===
The film spawned a franchise of related items and memorabilia such as action figures, headbands, posters, T-shirts, and a video game. A novelization was made by B.B. Hiller and published in 1984. The novel had a scene that was in the rehearsal when Daniel encounters Johnny during school at lunch. Also at the end, there was a battle between Miyagi and Kreese in the parking lot after the tournament which was the original ending for the film and used as the beginning of &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot;.

In 2015, toy company Funko revived &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; action figures. Two versions of LaRusso, a version of Lawrence and a version of Miyagi were part of the line. The toys were spotted at retailers Target and Amazon.com.

===Cultural influence===
The series has been credited for popularizing karate in the United States.

The American experimental rock band Sweep the Leg Johnny derives their name from a line from the film.

The 2007 music video for the song &quot;Sweep the Leg&quot; by No More Kings stars William Zabka (who also directed the video) as a caricature of himself and features references to &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;, including cameo appearances by Zabka&#x27;s former &quot;Karate Kid&quot; co-stars.

Macchio and Zabka made a guest appearance as themselves in the &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; episode &quot;The Bro Mitzvah&quot;. In the episode, Macchio is invited to Barney Stinson&#x27;s bachelor party, leading to Barney shouting that he hates Macchio and that Johnny was the real hero of &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;. Towards the end of the episode, a clown in the party wipes off his makeup and reveals himself as Zabka.

==Sequels and adaptations==

The success of &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; spawned three more films, including two direct sequels, starting with &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot; in 1986. Picking up where the first film left off, the film sees Daniel accompany Miyagi on a trip to Okinawa, where he is reunited with loved ones and is challenged by an old adversary. Although a commercial success, it received mixed reviews. &quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot; followed in 1989, which saw Kreese seek revenge on Daniel and Miyagi with the help of new allies. It was criticized for rehashing elements of the first two films. Another sequel, &quot;The Next Karate Kid&quot; (1994), was the first in the series not to include Macchio, although Morita returned as Miyagi. It follows Hilary Swank as one of his new students. A remake of the original film, also titled &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;, was released in 2010. Set in Beijing, it starred Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith and received generally favorable reviews.

Aside from the film series, an animated series based on the film, also called &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;, aired on NBC in the fall of 1989. Consisting of thirteen episodes, the series abandoned the karate tournament motif and followed Daniel and Miyagi, voiced by Joey Dedio and Robert Ito, respectively, in an adventure/quest setting.

A sequel live-action television series, &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;, debuted in 2018. Created by Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, it stars Macchio and Zabka, who reprise their roles as LaRusso and Lawrence, respectively. Set 34 years later, &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; re-examines the &quot;Miyagi-Verse&quot; narrative from Johnny&#x27;s point of view, his decision to reopen the Cobra Kai dojo, and the rekindling of his old rivalry with Daniel. The series draws upon all of the sequels, as well as the original film. The series also pays tribute to Morita, who died in 2005. After a guest appearance in the show&#x27;s first season, Kove reprised his role as John Kreese starting in the second season, while Shue reprised her role as Ali Mills in the series&#x27; third season, and Thomas Ian Griffith as Terry Silver (from &quot;Part III&quot;) in the fourth and fifth seasons.

In January 2020, a Broadway musical adaptation of &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; was revealed to be in development. Amon Miyamoto served as the director, with an accompanying novel being written by the original film&#x27;s screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen. Drew Gasparini is the lyricist and composer of the score, while Keone and Mari Madrid choreographed the play. Kumiko Yoshii and Michael Wolk will serve as producers, with The Kinoshita Group. The cast will include Jovanni Sy as Mr. Miyagi, John Cardoza as Daniel LaRusso, Kate Baldwin as Lucille LaRusso, Alan H. Green as John Kreese, Jake Bentley Young as Johnny Lawrence, Jetta Juriansz as Ali Mills, and Luis-Pablo Garcia as Freddie Fernandez. The adaption debuted in St. Louis in June 2022.

In August 2023, it was reported that Jackie Chan would be reprising his role from the 2010 film in a new &quot;Karate Kid&quot; film. By November of the same year, Chan officially joined the cast alongside Ralph Macchio in their respective roles as Mr. Han and Daniel LaRusso. The studio announced a world-wide open casting call for an actor to star as the movie&#x27;s iteration of the titular character. Jonathan Entwistle will serve as director from a script written by Rob Lieber, where the plot will involve a teen from China moving to the east coast and beginning to study martial arts. Karen Rosenfelt will produce the film, with principal photography scheduled to commence in spring 2024. Originally scheduled to be released on June 7, 2024, the film was delayed to December 13, 2024, in part as a result of the 2023 writers and actors strikes.

==Book==
In 2022, Ralph Macchio published the memoir &quot;Waxing On: The Karate Kid and Me&quot; (Dutton), in which he reflects upon the making of and legacy of the &quot;Karate Kid&quot; films and &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;.

<text>A dying-and-rising god, life–death–rebirth deity, or resurrection deity is a supposed religious motif in which a god or goddess dies and is resurrected. Examples of gods who die and later return to life are most often cited from the religions of the ancient Near East. The traditions influenced by them include the Greco-Roman mythology.
The concept of a dying-and-rising god was first proposed in comparative mythology by James Frazer&#x27;s seminal &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; (1890). Frazer associated the motif with fertility rites surrounding the yearly cycle of vegetation. Frazer cited the examples of Osiris, Tammuz, Adonis and Attis, Zagreus, Dionysus, and Jesus.

Frazer&#x27;s interpretation of the category has been critically discussed in 20th-century scholarship, to the conclusion that many examples from the world&#x27;s mythologies included by Frazer under &quot;dying and rising&quot; should only be considered &quot;dying&quot; but not &quot;rising&quot;, and that the genuine dying-and-rising god is a characteristic feature of ancient Near Eastern mythologies and the derived mystery cults of late antiquity. &quot;Death or departure of the gods&quot; is motif A192 in Stith Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Motif-Index of Folk-Literature&quot; (1932), and &quot;resurrection of gods&quot; is motif A193.

==Overview==
The motif of a dying deity appears within the mythology of diverse cultures – perhaps because attributes of deities were derived from everyday experiences, and the ensuing conflicts often included death. These examples include Baldr in Norse mythology and the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl in Aztec mythology to the Japanese Izanami.
The methods of death vary. In Germanic mythology, for example, Baldr (whose account was likely first written down in the 12th century), is inadvertently killed by his blind brother Höðr who is tricked into shooting a mistletoe-tipped arrow at him. Baldr&#x27;s body is then set aflame on a ship as it sails out to sea. Baldr does not come back to life because not all living creatures shed tears for him, and his death then leads to the &quot;doom of the gods&quot;. 

By contrast, most variations of Quetzalcoatl&#x27;s story (first written down in the 16th century) have Quetzalcoatl tricked by Tezcatlipoca to over-drink and then burn himself to death out of remorse for his own shameful deeds. Quetzalcoatl does not resurrect and come back to life as himself, but some versions of his story have a flock of birds flying away from his ashes. In some variants, Quetzalcoatl sails away on the ocean never to return.

Hawaiian deities can die and depart the world in a number of ways. Some gods who were killed on Lanai by Lanikuala departed for the skies. In contrast, Kaili leaves the world by canoe and is never seen again. The Japanese god Izanami dies giving birth to the child Kagu-tsuchi (incarnation of fire) or Ho-Musubi (causer of fire) and Izanagi goes to Yomi, the land of gloom, to retrieve her, but she has already changed to a deteriorated state and Izanagi will not bring her back, and she pursues Izanagi, but he manages to escape.

Some traditions tie the cycle of life and death brought about by the seasons to deities which themselves undergo a cycle of death and rebirth. In effect, these gods take the form of a vegetation deity. Examples include Ishtar and Persephone, who die every year. The annual death of Ishtar when she goes underground represents the lack of growth, and her return represents the rebirth of the farming cycle. Most scholars hold that although the gods suggested in this motif die, they do not generally return in terms of rising as the same deity, although scholars such as Mettinger contend that in some cases they do.

==Development==
The term &quot;dying god&quot; is associated with the works of James Frazer, Jane Ellen Harrison, and their fellow Cambridge Ritualists. At the end of the 19th century, in their &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; and &quot;Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion&quot;, Frazer and Harrison argued that all myths are echoes of rituals, and that all rituals have as their primordial purpose the manipulation of natural phenomena.
Early in the 20th century, Gerald Massey argued that there are similarities between the Egyptian dying-and-rising god myths and Jesus, but Massey&#x27;s factual errors often render his works mistaken. For example, Massey stated that the biblical references to Herod the Great were based on the myth of &quot;Herrut&quot; the evil hydra serpent. However, the existence of Herod the Great is well established independently of Christian sources.

The Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung argued that archetypal processes such as death and resurrection were part of the &quot;trans-personal symbolism&quot; of the collective unconscious, and could be utilized in the task of psychological integration. He also proposed that the myths of the pagan gods who symbolically died and resurrected foreshadowed Christ&#x27;s literal/physical death and resurrection. The overall view of Jung regarding religious themes and stories is that they are expressions of events occurring in the unconscious of the individuals – regardless of their historicity. From the symbolic perspective, Jung sees dying and rising gods as an archetypal process resonating with the collective unconscious through which the rising god becomes the greater personality in the Jungian self. In Jung&#x27;s view, a biblical story such as the resurrection of Jesus (which he saw as a case of dying and rising) may be true or not, but that has no relevance to the psychological analysis of the process, and its impact.
The analysis of Osiris permeates the later religious psychology of Carl Jung more than any other element. In 1950 Jung wrote that those who partake in the Osiris myth festival and follow the ritual of his death and the scattering of his body to restart the vegetation cycle as a rebirth &quot;experience the permanence and continuity of life which outlasts all changes of form&quot;. Jung wrote that Osiris provided the key example of the rebirth process in that initially only the Pharaohs &quot;had an Osiris&quot; but later other Egyptians nobles acquired it and eventually it led in the concept of soul for all individuals in Christianity. Jung believed that Christianity itself derived its significance from the archetypal relationship between Osiris and Horus versus God the Father and Jesus, his son. However, Jung also postulated that the rebirth applied to Osiris (the father), and not Horus, the son.

The general applicability of the death and resurrection of Osiris to the dying-and-rising-god analogy has been criticized, on the grounds that it derived from the harvesting rituals that related the rising and receding waters of the Nile river and the farming cycle. The cutting down of barley and wheat was related to the death of Osiris, and the sprouting of shoots was thought to be based on the power of Osiris to resurrect the farmland. In general rebirth analogies based on the vegetation cycle are viewed as the weakest elements in the death-rebirth analogies.

In Greek mythology, Dionysus, the son of Zeus, was a horned child who was torn to pieces by Titans who lured him with toys, then boiled and ate him. Zeus then destroyed the Titans by thunderbolt as a result of their action against Dionysus and from the ashes humans were formed. However, Dionysus&#x27; grandmother Rhea managed to put some of his pieces back together (principally from his heart that was spared) and brought him back to life. In other Orphic tales, Zagreus is depicted as the son of Hades and Persephone, and is the god of rebirth. Scholars such as Barry Powell have suggested Dionysus as an example of resurrection.

The oldest known example of the &quot;dying god rising myth&quot; is the Sumerian myth of Inanna&#x27;s Descent to the Underworld. The Sumerian goddess Inanna travels to the Underworld to see her sister Ereshkigal. While there, she is &quot;struck down&quot; and turns into a corpse. For three days and three nights, Inanna is dead, until she is resurrected with the help of her father, Enki, who sends the two galla to bring her back. The galla serve Inanna food and water and bring her back to life.

==Scholarly criticism==

The category &quot;dying-and-rising-god&quot; was debated throughout the 20th century, and most modern scholars questioned its ubiquity in the world&#x27;s mythologies. By the end of the 20th century the scholarly consensus was that most of the gods Frazer listed as &quot;dying-and-rising&quot; only died and did not rise. Kurt Rudolph in 1986 argued that the oft-made connection between the mystery religions and the idea of dying and rising divinities is defective. Gerald O&#x27;Collins states that surface-level application of analogous symbolism is a case of parallelomania which exaggerates the importance of trifling resemblances, long abandoned by mainstream scholars. Against this view, Mettinger (2001) affirms that many of the gods of the mystery religions do indeed die, descend to the underworld, are lamented and retrieved by a woman and restored to life. However, Mettinger also disincludes Christianity from this influence.

Though the concept of a &quot;dying-and-rising god&quot; has a longer history, it was significantly advocated by Frazer&#x27;s &quot;Golden Bough&quot; (1906–1914). At first received very favourably, the idea was attacked by Roland de Vaux in 1933, and was the subject of controversial debate over the following decades. One of the leading scholars in the deconstruction of Frazer&#x27;s &quot;dying-and-rising god&quot; category was Jonathan Z. Smith, whose 1969 dissertation discusses Frazer&#x27;s &quot;Golden Bough&quot;, and who in Mircea Eliade&#x27;s 1987 &quot;Encyclopedia of religion&quot; wrote the &quot;Dying and rising gods&quot; entry, where he dismisses the category as &quot;largely a misnomer based on imaginative reconstructions and exceedingly late or highly ambiguous texts&quot;, suggesting a more detailed categorisation into &quot;dying gods&quot; and &quot;disappearing gods&quot;, arguing that before Christianity, the two categories were distinct and gods who &quot;died&quot; did not return, and those who returned never truly &quot;died&quot;.

Smith gave a more detailed account of his views specifically on the question of parallels to Christianity in &quot;Drudgery Divine&quot; (1990). Smith&#x27;s 1987 article was widely received, and during the 1990s, scholarly consensus seemed to shift towards his rejection of the concept as oversimplified, although it continued to be invoked by scholars writing about ancient Near Eastern mythology.

Beginning with an overview of the Athenian ritual of growing and withering herb gardens at the Adonis festival, in his book &quot;The Gardens of Adonis&quot; Marcel Detienne suggests that rather than being a stand-in for crops in general (and therefore the cycle of death and rebirth), these herbs (and Adonis) were part of a complex of associations in the Greek mind that centered on spices. These associations included seduction, trickery, gourmandizing, and the anxieties of childbirth. From his point of view, Adonis&#x27;s death is only one datum among the many that must be used to analyze the festival, the myth, and the god.

A main criticism charges the group of analogies with reductionism, in that it subsumes a range of disparate myths under a single category and ignores important distinctions. Detienne argues that it risks making Christianity the standard by which all religion is judged, since death and resurrection are more central to Christianity than many other faiths. Dag Øistein Endsjø, a scholar of religion, points out how a number of those often defined as dying-and-rising-deities, such as a number of figures in ancient Greek religion, actually died as ordinary mortals, only to become gods of various stature after they were resurrected from the dead. Not dying as gods, they thus defy the definition of &quot;dying-and-rising-gods&quot;.

Tryggve Mettinger supports the category of dying and rising gods, and stated in 2001 that there was a scholarly consensus that the category is inappropriate. As of 2009, the &quot;Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion&quot; summarizes the current scholarly consensus as ambiguous, with some scholars rejecting Frazer&#x27;s &quot;broad universalist category&quot; preferring to emphasize the differences between the various traditions, but others continue to view the category as applicable.

In the 2010s, Paola Corrente conducted an extensive survey of the status of the dying and rising god category. Though she agrees that much of Frazer&#x27;s specific evidence was faulty, she argues that the category as a whole is valid, though she suggests modifications to the specific criteria. Corrente specifically focuses her attention on several Near Eastern and Mesopotamian gods as examples which she argues have been largely ignored, both by Frazer (who would not have had access to most relevant texts) and his more recent critics. These examples include the goddess Inanna in Sumerian texts and Ba&#x27;al in Ugaritic texts, whose myths, Corrente argues, offer concrete examples of death and resurrection. Corrente also utilizes the example of Dionysus, whose connection to the category is more complicated, but has still been largely ignored or mischaracterized by other scholars including Frazer himself in her view.
== In popular culture ==
In the webcomic &quot;Homestuck&quot;, players of the universe-creating game Sburb can attain conditional immortality and extraordinary power by ascending to &quot;god tier&quot;, a process that requires dying on a special sacrificial bed. God tier players can be killed normally, but will return anew so long as the game does not judge their deaths &quot;heroic&quot; or &quot;just&quot;.
In the video game &quot;Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War&quot;, Razgriz is a powerful fairy tale demon who first uses its power to &quot;[rain] death upon the land&quot;, before dying and returning as a great hero. &quot;Ace Combat 5&quot; uses the tale of Razgriz as an allegory for the protagonists.

<doc id="91140" wikidata="Q269812" url="?curid=91140" title="Christina Nilsson">
<text>Christina Nilsson, Countess de Casa Miranda, also called Christine Nilsson (20 August 1843 – 22 November 1921) was a Swedish operatic dramatic coloratura soprano. Possessed of a pure and brilliant voice (B3-F6), first three then two and a half octaves trained in the bel canto technique, and noted for her graceful appearance and stage presence, she enjoyed a twenty-year career as a top-rank international singer before her 1888 retirement. A contemporary of one of the Victorian era&#x27;s most famous divas, Adelina Patti, the two were often compared by reviewers and audiences, and were sometimes believed to be rivals. Nilsson became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music in 1869.

== Biography ==
Christina Nilsson was born Christina Jonasdotter in a forester&#x27;s hut at Sjöabol (or Snugge) farm near Växjö, Småland, the youngest of seven children of the peasants Jonas Nilsson (1798 - 1871) and Stina Cajsa Månsdotter (1804 - 1870). As a young child she received a rudimentary education, attending the local village free school where she learnt to read and write. From her earliest years, she demonstrated musical talent, both singing and in playing the violin and flute, and she was taught some music basics by Sven Grankvist, the parish organist, who unsuccessfully attempted to persuade her to go to Stockholm in search of further musical training. The family was very poor, making such training out of the question, and to make extra money the young Christina would sometimes go to the local market fairs with her parents or brother to perform. At the age of eleven, she was described in the Stockholm newspaper &quot;Fäderneslandet&quot;. She was discovered at age 14 by a wealthy district judge Fredrik Tornérhjelm when she was performing at such a market in Ljungby. Tornérhjelm became her patron, enabling her to take vocal training with Mlle Adelaide Valerius, Baronne de Leuhusen in Halmstad between 1857 and 1858. The Czech composer Bedřich Smetana, who lived in Gothenburg, became her piano teacher between 1858 and 1859. Upon request from Adelaide de Leuhusen, she went to Stockholm in September 1859, where she became a student of Franz Berwald, who gave her singing and violin lessons, and taught her music theory; Hilda Thegerström, another pupil of Berwald, was engaged at the same time to give the young Christina piano lessons, while Berwald&#x27;s wife Mathilde gave her French and German language lessons.

In 1860, Nilsson gave her professional debut in concerts in Stockholm and Uppsala, receiving mixed reviews. It was then decided that she should seek further training in Paris. Adelaide de Leuhusen&#x27;s sister, the artist Bertha Valerius, was planning a trip there anyway, and would be able to act as a chaperone while Nilsson got settled in. In Paris, Nilsson initially stayed in Madame Crespy&#x27;s &quot;pension&quot;, before transferring to Clara Collinet&#x27;s school in Batignolles, where she stayed for three years. She studied for a year with Jean Jacques Masset, a retired tenor who had become a prominent voice teacher. He professed himself very pleased with Nilsson&#x27;s voice and progress. Adelaide de Leuhusen disagreed, believing Masset was too lenient and was spoiling Nilsson. She may also have been concerned his training would damage Nilsson&#x27;s voice. In the autumn of 1861, therefore, Adelaide de Leuhusen transferred Nilsson to Pierre François Wartel, who had been a student of the famous singer Adolphe Nourrit. Nilsson would study with him for three years.

This period gave her the opportunity to build relationships with the Parisian musical world. Meyerbeer, having heard her as a student, was impressed with her voice, and offered her the role of &quot;Ines&quot; in his opera &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot; as a debut. Nilsson instead accepted a contract from a Brussels-based impresario to appear in Italian operas. This came to nothing, after the impresario went bankrupt, leaving Nilsson free in 1864 to accept an offer from Caroline Miolan-Carvalho and her husband Léon Carvalho, prima donna and manager respectively of the Théâtre Lyrique, Paris. Nilsson&#x27;s operatic début that year as &quot;Violetta&quot; in Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;La Traviata&quot; at the Théâtre Lyrique was a splendid success, despite Nilsson being unknown to the public and she became a leading member of the company there until 1867, appearing alongside Miolan-Carvalho in operas such as Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Magic Flute&quot; and Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;; other roles included &quot;Henrietta&quot; in Flotow&#x27;s &quot;Martha&quot; and &quot;Donna Elvira&quot; in Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. She then made her London debut in June 1867 at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, again as &quot;Violetta&quot;, and appeared there as &quot;Marguerite&quot; in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; in the same year, Miolan-Carvalho (who had created the role of &quot;Marguerite&quot; in 1859) travelling specially to London to hear the performance. Other London performances included the title role in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; (May 1868) and &quot;Cherubino&quot; in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (June 1868).

In 1868, Nilsson transferred from the Théâtre Lyrique to the Paris Opera, where she created the role of &quot;Ophelia&quot; in Ambroise Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. This was followed in 1869 by the Paris Opera&#x27;s first production of &quot;Faust&quot;. This last created a stir in Paris. The opera was part of the Théâtre Lyrique&#x27;s repertory, restricting performances at other Parisian opera houses, and Miolan-Carvalho, the prima donna of the Théâtre Lyrique and the creator of the role of &quot;Marguerite&quot;, had monopolised the role. In 1868, however, the Théâtre Lyrique went bankrupt, the Paris Opera acquired the rights to perform &quot;Faust&quot;, and Miolan-Carvalho signed a contract to join the Paris Opera. Despite expectations that Miolan-Carvalho would sing &#x27;her&#x27; role of &quot;Marguerite&quot; in her new opera house, the role was given to Nilsson. The decision was controversial, and reviews of the time focused on the differences between the two singers. Despite mixed reviews, Nilsson would perform the role frequently across the rest of her career.

Nilsson made her debut at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in 1869 in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, and also sang the first London performance of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Further London performances between 1869 and 1874, Nilsson dividing her time between Covent Garden, Drury Lane, and Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, and singing work by artists as varied as Mozart, Meyerbeer, Ambroise Thomas, Wagner, Verdi, and Michael Balfe.

Her North American operatic debut took place in Boston in October 1871, when she once again portrayed &quot;Marguerite&quot; in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;. This was followed by her first operatic performance in New York City at the Academy of Music in 1871, singing in the first New York performance of Thomas&#x27;s Mignon. During 1871–1873 she also appeared in opera performances in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Washington DC. New roles included &quot;Zerlina&quot; in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and &quot;Leonora&quot; in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Il Trovatore&quot; both in New York.
Nilsson also made concert tours: a tour of the United States and Canada in autumn 1870 (with Maurice Strakosch as manager), with her first concert at Steinway Hall, New York, in September; and several times of Russia between 1872 and 1875. The North American tour proved extremely lucrative, reportedly netting her two hundred thousand dollars and the acclaim of the American public. After her first successful US tour Nilsson returned to England and married the French stockbroker Auguste Rouzaud (b.1837) The wedding in Westminster Abbey, London, on July 27, 1872, was boycotted by the groom&#x27;s family. The marriage lasted until February 1882 when Rouzaud died in Paris after a period of illness.

Composer Piotr Tchaikovsky heard Nilsson&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;Marguerite&quot; in &quot;Faust&quot; at her Moscow debut in November 1872, and claimed she embodied Goethe&#x27;s ideals. Her performances in Russia were well received by audiences, including the Tsar and Tsarina, who gifted her valuable jewelry (now on display at Smålands Museum in Växjö).

In 1876, Nilsson undertook a Scandinavian tour. On August 25, she portrayed &quot;Marguerite&quot; in a performance of &quot;Faust&quot; at the Royal Stora Theatre, Stockholm, and she also performed the roles of &quot;Valentine&quot; (in &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;) and &quot;Mignon&quot;. She also sang in Uppsala, Kristiania (Oslo), Gothenburg, Växjö, Malmö and Copenhagen. This was followed by a debut in January 1877 at the Hofoper in Vienna in the role of &quot;Ophelia&quot;, after which she was appointed Imperial Austro-Hungarian Court and Chamber Singer. She also performed in Budapest, Hamburg and Brussels, before returning to London for another opera season. In the autumn of 1877 she traveled again to Russia and here she was appointed Imperial Russian Chamber Singer.

Christina Nilsson made her Spanish opera debut with &quot;Marguerite&quot; in &quot;Faust&quot; at the Teatro Real in Madrid in 1879. In the summer of 1880, she presented the double roles of &quot;Margherita&quot; and &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; in Arrigo Boito&#x27;s opera Mefistofele for the first time at performances at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in London. In the autumn of 1881, she sang in Stockholm in connection with a royal wedding.

On October 22, 1883, Christina Nilsson sang the role of &quot;Marguerite&quot; in &quot;Faust&quot; at the inauguration of the Metropolitan Opera House, New York. She then appeared in a number of American and Canadian cities. Later that year, she sang for the President of the United States Chester A. Arthur at the White House. Her final appearances in the United States took place in early June 1884.

In August 1885, she began another tour of Scandinavia. After her third Stockholm concert on 23 September, she gave a performance from the balcony of the Grand Hotel in Stockholm. An estimated 50,000 people gathered to hear the world-famous soprano. A panic broke out and a large number of people died or were injured. Nilsson then continued with her tour, giving further concerts in Scandinavia, Germany, Prague, and Vienna, including her first recital in Berlin (9 November 1885).

In March 1887, Christina Nilsson married Don Angel Ramon Maria Vallejo y Miranda es, Count de Casa Miranda es (b.1832), a Spanish journalist and diplomatic official. The wedding took place in church of La Madeleine, Paris. The pair had been involved in a relationship since 1882, and Casa Miranda&#x27;s daughter Rosita had accompanied Nilsson on her 1882–1883 trip to the USA. Now she was remarried, Nilsson decided to retire, marking the occasion by giving two farewell performances at the Royal Albert Hall, London, in 1888. Now known as the Countess de Casa Miranda, Nilsson settled in France and Spain.

In 1894, Nilsson published &quot;Om röstens utbildning: Några råd till unga sångerskor&quot; (&quot;Some advice for young singers&quot;). She also composed two romances for voice and piano, with lyrics by herself, &quot;Jag hade en vän&quot; and &quot;Ophelia&#x27;s Lament&quot;.

In 1902, Nilsson became a widow for the second time. Four years later, she bought Villa Vik outside Växjö, spending her last years there. She died in Växjö in 1921, and is buried there at Tegnérkyrkogården.

Unlike Patti, Nilsson never made gramophone recordings of her voice. Though described as of moderate power, Nilsson&#x27;s voice in her prime was described as of &quot;crystalline brilliancy, resonance, and purity of tone.&quot; Perfectly even in its register, when she began singing she could reportedly span three and a half octaves, though after her first three years of stage singing this had diminished to an easy two and a half octaves stretching from a low G natural to a high D. She was particularly popular with English audiences for the &quot;crystalline ethereal quality of her voice&quot;, especially in oratorio. Comparisons to Patti were common – it was said Nilsson lacked &quot;the velvet voluptuous sweetness&quot; of Patti&#x27;s voice, and perhaps too &quot;the perfect mechanism of Patti&#x27;s vocal art&quot; – but Nilsson&#x27;s voice was said to possess a poignancy that lent itself best to pathetic characters such as &quot;Marguerite&quot; and &quot;Ophelia&quot;, and to have &quot;something strange&quot; about it, &quot;which no one could quite define&quot;. One English critic, summing up the two, concluded, &quot;When Patti sings, one fancies the notes of the lark rising to the gates of heaven, but Nilsson&#x27;s voice is a strain from the other side of the gates.&quot;

== In literature ==
She is a minor character in &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; by Edith Wharton.

She is mentioned in &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; by Leo Tolstoy.

She is widely believed to have been the inspiration for Christine Daaé, the heroine of Gaston Leroux&#x27;s novel &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. Towards the end of his life, Leroux claimed the character was based on a real opera singer &quot;whose real name I hid under that of Christine Daaé&quot;, and details of Nilsson&#x27;s early life heavily reflect details in the fictitious Christine Daaé&#x27;s history, even to the point of using ideas and language from contemporary reviews of Nilsson&#x27;s performances in &quot;Faust&quot; in 1869.

== In popular culture==
Nilsson is a minor character in the first episode of Season 2 of the television series &quot;The Gilded Age&quot;, and was played by Sarah Joy Miller.

<doc id="91141" wikidata="Q5575902" url="?curid=91141" title="Kʼawiil">
<text>Kʼawiil, in the Post-Classic codices corresponding to God K, is a Maya deity identified with power, creation, and lightning. He is characterized by a zoomorphic head, with large eyes, long, upturned snout and attenuated serpent foot. As a creator god, K&#x27;awiil usually has a torch, stone celt, or cigar coming out of his forehead that symbolizes the spark of life. One of his legs does not end in a foot but in a snake with an open mouth, from which another being can emerge. As lightning and power personified, K&#x27;awiil is often carried like an axe by rain gods or as a sceptre by Maya rulers.

==Names==
From the correspondence between Landa&#x27;s description of the New Year rituals and the depiction of these rituals in the Dresden Codex, it can be inferred that in 16th-century Yucatán, Kʼawiil was called &quot;Bolon Dzacab&quot; &#x27;Innumerable (&quot;bolon&quot; &#x27;nine, innumerable&#x27;) maternal generations&#x27;, probably a metaphor for fertility as well as the power of creation. God K&#x27;s name in the Classic period may have been the same, or similar, since the numeral &#x27;nine&#x27; is repeatedly found included in the deity&#x27;s logogram.

However, based on epigraphic considerations, the Classic Maya God K is now most often referred to as &quot;Kʼawiil&quot;. Hieroglyphically, the head of God K can substitute for the syllable &quot;kʼa&quot; in &quot;kʼawiil&quot;, a word possibly meaning &#x27;powerful one&#x27;, and attested as a generic deity title in Yucatec documents. This substitution has given rise to the idea that, inversely, the title &quot;kʼawiil&quot; as a whole should be considered a name specifically referring to God K.

==Narratives and scenes==

Lightning plays a crucial role in tales dealing with the creation of the world and its preparation for the advent of mankind. In the cosmogony of the Popol Vuh, three Lightning deities identified with the &#x27;Heart of the Sky&#x27; (among whom &quot;Huraqan&quot; &#x27;One-Leg&#x27;) create the earth out of the primordial sea, and populate it with animals. Bolon Dzacab plays an important, if not very clear role in the cosmogonical myth related in the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel, where he is identified with wrapped-up seeds. Wielding lightning, the rain gods once opened up a sacred mountain, making the maize seeds therein available to mankind. 
Kʼawiil also figures in an enigmatic Classic scene known only from ceramics (see fig.2), showing an aged ancestor or deity emerging from the serpentine foot of the lightning god, apparently to mate with a nude young woman of decidedly aristocratic allure entwined by the serpent. Not impossibly, the meaning of the scene is ritual, rather than mythological.

K&#x27;awiil also features prominently in the stucco reliefs of the Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque in Chiapas, Mexico, where rulers and nobles hold infant forms of K&#x27;awiil. This infant form of the god (unen k&#x27;awiil) was also one of the three patron deities of Palenque (GII of the so-called Palenque Triad).

==Functions==
The illustrated k&#x27;atun cycle of the Paris Codex suggests that the presentation of the head of Kʼawiil – perhaps holding the promise of &#x27;Innumerable Generations&#x27; – was part of the king&#x27;s ritual inauguration and accession to the throne. As lightning, k&#x27;awiil was also raw power and basic to creation as well as destruction. Holding k&#x27;awiil was a sign not only of the king&#x27;s abilities in war and politics but also his power to bring agricultural abundance (particularly with regard to maize and cacao seeds). Therefore, k&#x27;awiil is often depicted with a sack of grains, sometimes accompanied by the expression &quot;hun yax(al) hun kʼan(al)&quot; &#x27;abundance&#x27;.

=== K&#x27;awiil sceptre ===
Classic-period Maya artists depicted the K&#x27;awiil sceptre not as a mere stone object, but as a living, animate participant in the rituals portrayed. K‘awiil might merely represent the concept of an effigy, as the term &quot;kauil&quot; translates to &quot;idol, false god&quot; in the Poqom and Kaqchikel languages. It could symbolize a general physical representation of divinity, akin to how &quot;k&#x27;uhul&quot; embodies the &quot;invisible, inherent essence of godhood.&quot; The K‘awiil sceptre was occasionally taken by individuals outside of royalty. At Caracol Stela 5, dating to A.D. 613, Knot Ajaw is depicted with a pair of miniature figures or dwarves at his feet, each holding a K‘awiil sceptre. In its earliest form, K‘awiil was prefixed with &quot;yax&quot;, meaning &#x27;unripe&#x27; or &#x27;young.&#x27; At Yaxchilán, the K‘awiil sceptre was held on various occasions and at different times throughout the year. Yaxun Bʼalam IV is the only known ruler to have danced with the K&#x27;awiil sceptre on his day of accession.

The sceptre can also be found in Palenque and Copan. K‘awiil was a central focus in some polities, while being virtually overlooked in others. Quirigua&#x27;s dynastic founder, &quot;Tok Casper,&quot; was the first to receive the K‘awiil sceptre (&quot;cham k’awiil&quot;) in Quirigua during his accession. Although not inherently an accession statement, the K‘awiil sceptre is often utilized in this context. It later became the preferred expression used by Kʼakʼ Tiliw Chan Yopaat in Quiriguá to signify his own accession after he overthrew his overlord Uaxaclajuun Ubʼaah Kʼawiil in 738.

<text>Cryogenic was an Australian thrash metal/death metal band formed in 1992 in Wetherill Park, a suburb of Sydney, Australia.

==History==

===Early===
The band originally featured guitarist Steve Essa, bass player Anthony Henning, singer/guitarist Russell Player and drummer Chad Bartosik, who was also a member of another thrash band called Neophobia. Cryogenic&#x27;s history is linked to that of another Sydney thrash/groove metal band called Mortality, that was formed around the same time by guitarist Darren Jenkins, bass player Luke Ford and vocalist Darren Maloney. Mortality released three demos and toured with Sepultura before Jenkins was replaced by Craig Figl and original drummer Rick Fuda by Steve Pell, previously of a late-80s metal band known as Kilswitch. Mortality&#x27;s activity stalled due to a long delay in the release of their debut album &quot;Structure&quot;. While it was eventually released in early 1997, dispute about musical direction saw Mortality disband six months later.

===Demo===
Cryogenic released its first demo in 1995. However Bartosik left before the band could capitalise on its success on the local Sydney metal scene. Temporary drummer Grahame Goode from Neophobia played with the band on a key support date with Belgian thrash band Channel Zero but without a permanent drummer Cryogenic was on the verge of splitting up. Late in the year, Mortality&#x27;s ex-guitarist Jenkins joined the band as drummer, enabling them to support Fear Factory in mid-1996 before beginning work on a debut album, &quot;Suspended Animation&quot; in early 1997. At the same time, the band deliberately cultivated a following amongst the &quot;Westy&quot; headbangers of Sydney&#x27;s western suburbs. In a further link to Jenkins&#x27; former band, in the aftermath to the disbanding of Mortality, Player was then replaced by that band&#x27;s vocalist Darren Maloney, who re-recorded the album&#x27;s vocal parts just prior to release.

===Late 1990s===
Cryogenic appeared with Strapping Young Lad and then Cradle of Filth in late 1997; this began a string of tours and opening slots for the band that included a tour with Entombed and shows in South Africa, England and Germany to promote &quot;Suspended Animation&quot;. This was followed by an Australian tour with Slayer.

In November 1998 the band appeared at Metal for the Brain for the first time. They would go on to play twice more at Australia&#x27;s largest heavy metal music festival.

In 1999 Cryogenic played at the Sydney Big Day Out and late in the year released their second album, &quot;ego-noria&quot;. 2000 featured heavy touring around Australia including the Big Day Out once again. After a third Big Day Out appearance in 2001 Cryogenic went off the road for much of the year, ostensibly to work on another album. However, in October it was announced that Maloney had been replaced by Steve Simmons, formerly with Canberra nu metal band Henry&#x27;s Anger. Plans were then made for the band to relocate to the United States with tentative plans made for shows in Los Angeles. However, Simmons was injured in a car accident and was forced to leave the band.

===In The Name Of ===
The remainder of Cryogenic then based themselves in Los Angeles and re-launched itself under the name of In The Name Of after recruiting vocalist Ryan David. That band broke up in early 2005, with Jenkins returning to Australia. He now works as a producer and sound engineer. Maloney, Ford and Pell reformed Mortality in late 2005 with guitarist Andrew Lilley, a former member of Psi.Kore, Infernal Method and Atomizer. The band played a single comeback show in Sydney in August 2006, with no plans to continue further at the time. Mortality were reported to have begun writing and rehearsing once more as of mid-2007, but no new material has surfaced to date.

<text>Everton Football Club () is a professional association football club based in Liverpool, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Founded in 1878, the club was a founding member of the Football League in 1888, and was a founding member of the Premier League in 1992, one of just three clubs to have been a founding member of both leagues. Everton are one of the oldest and most successful clubs in England, having won twenty-four major trophies: nine league titles, five FA Cups, one European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and nine Charity Shields.

Everton won their first League Championship during the 1890–91 season. After winning four more League championships and two FA Cups, the club experienced a post-Second World War lull until a revival in the 1960s. A period of sustained success came in the mid-1980s, when Everton won a further two League championships, one FA Cup, and the 1985 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. The club&#x27;s most recent major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup.

Everton is the club with the second-longest continuous presence in English top-flight football, and ranks third in the all-time points rankings. As of August 2024, the club have competed in the top division for a record 122 seasons, having missed only four top-flight seasons (1930–31, 1951–52, 1952–53, and 1953–54).

The club&#x27;s traditional kit are royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks. Everton have played at their home ground Goodison Park since 1892, having moved from their original home at Anfield following a disagreement with the landowner John Houlding over their rent. The club&#x27;s supporters are colloquially known as &quot;Evertonians&quot; or &quot;Blues&quot;. Everton have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Liverpool, with whom they contest the Merseyside derby. The club was owned by Farhad Moshiri, after he bought 49.9% of the club&#x27;s shares in 2016. As of May 2023, the club&#x27;s value was $744 million. The club&#x27;s revenue and operating income for the 2022–23 season were $242 million and -$23 million respectively. In December 2024, American billionaire Dan Friedkin purchased the club.

== History ==
Everton was founded as St. Domingo&#x27;s FC in 1878 so that members of the congregation of St Domingo Methodist New Connexion Chapel in Breckfield Road North, Everton, could play sport year round – cricket was played in summer. The club&#x27;s first game was a 1–0 victory over Everton Church Club. The club was renamed Everton in November 1879 after the local area, as people outside the congregation wished to participate.

The club was a founding member of the Football League in 1888–89 and won their first League Championship title in the 1890–91 season. The 1890–91 season started in superb form with five straight victories, with Fred Geary scoring in each of the first six matches. By mid-January, Everton had completed all but one of their fixtures and were on 29 points, while Preston North End were eleven points adrift with seven games still to play. Everton than had to sit out the next two months as Preston completed their fixture list until they were only two points adrift with one match each left to play. Both teams played their final games of the season on 14 March, with Everton losing 3–2 at Burnley (Geary scored both Everton goals) and Preston going down 3–0 at Sunderland. Everton were thus able to win the Football League Championship for the first time, by a margin of two points with fourteen victories from their 22 league games. Geary had been ever-present, and was the club&#x27;s top goal-scorer with 21 goals.

Everton reached four FA Cup finals before the First World War, losing 1–0 against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Fallowfield Stadium, Manchester on 26 March 1893 and 3–2 against Aston Villa at Crystal Palace on 10 April 1897 before winning at their third attempt on 20 April 1906 against Newcastle United again at Crystal Palace. Everton then reached their second successive final on 20 April 1907, however, finished in a 2–1 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday. 1914–15 was to be the final season before league football was suspended for the duration of the First World War. Everton won their second league title, one point ahead of Oldham Athletic, with Bobby Parker finishing the season as the leagues&#x27; top scorer on 35 goals. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 interrupted the football programme while Everton were reigning champions, which was something that would again occur in 1939.

In 1925 the club signed Dixie Dean from Tranmere Rovers. In 1927–28, Dean set the record for top-flight league goals in a single season with 60 goals in 39 league games, which is a record that still stands. He helped Everton win their third League Championship that season. However, Everton were relegated to the Second Division two years later during internal turmoil at the club. The club quickly rebounded and were promoted at the first attempt, while scoring a record number of goals in the Second Division. On return to the top flight in 1931–32, Everton wasted no time in reaffirming their status and won a fourth League Championship at the first opportunity. Everton also won their second FA Cup in 1933 with a 3–0 win against Manchester City in the final. The era ended in 1938–39 with a fifth League Championship.

The outbreak of the Second World War again saw the suspension of league football, and when official competition resumed in 1946, the Everton team had been split up and paled in comparison to the pre-war team. Tommy Lawton was sold to Chelsea, Joe Mercer disagreed with the manager Theo Kelly and was sold to Arsenal, and they tried to sell T. G. Jones to Roma. Soon, only Ted Sagar was left. Under the management of the uninspired and under-financed Cliff Britton, Everton were relegated for the second time in 1950–51 and did not earn promotion until 1953–54, when they finished as the runner-up in their third season in the Second Division. The club has been a top-flight presence ever since.

Everton&#x27;s second successful era started when Harry Catterick was made manager in 1961. In 1962–63, his second season in charge, Everton won the League Championship. In 1966 the club won the FA Cup with a 3–2 win over Sheffield Wednesday. Everton again reached the final in 1968, but this time were unable to overcome West Bromwich Albion at Wembley. Two seasons later in 1969–70, Everton won the League Championship, finishing nine points clear of nearest rivals Leeds United. During this period, Everton were the first English club to achieve five consecutive years in European competitions – covering the seasons from 1961–62 to 1966–67.
However, the success did not last; the team finished fourteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth and seventh in the following seasons. Harry Catterick retired, but his successors failed to win any silverware for the remainder of the 1970s despite finishing fourth in 1974–75 under manager Billy Bingham, third in 1977–78 and fourth the following season under manager Gordon Lee. Lee was sacked in 1981.Howard Kendall took over as manager and guided Everton to their most successful era. Domestically, Everton won the FA Cup in 1984 and two League Championships in 1984–85 and 1986–87. In Europe, the club won their first, and so far only, European trophy by securing the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1985. The European success came after first beating University College Dublin, Inter Bratislava and Fortuna Sittard. Then, Everton defeated German giants Bayern Munich 3–1 in the semi-finals, despite trailing at half time (in a match voted the greatest in Goodison Park history), and recorded the same scoreline over Austrian club Rapid Vienna in the final. Having won both the League and Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1985, Everton came very close to winning a treble, but lost to Manchester United in the FA Cup final. The following season, 1985–86, Everton was the runner-up to Liverpool in both the League and the FA Cup, but did recapture the League Championship in 1986–87.

After the Heysel Stadium disaster and the subsequent ban of all English clubs from continental football, Everton lost the chance to compete for more European trophies. A large proportion of the title-winning side was broken up following the ban. Kendall himself moved to Athletic Bilbao after the 1987 title triumph and was succeeded by assistant Colin Harvey. Harvey took Everton to the 1989 FA Cup final, but lost 3–2 after extra time to Liverpool.

Everton was a founding member of the Premier League in 1992, but struggled to find the right manager. Howard Kendall had returned in 1990, but could not repeat his previous success. His successor, Mike Walker, was statistically the least successful Everton manager to date. When former Everton player Joe Royle took over in 1994, the club&#x27;s form started to improve; his first game in charge was a 2–0 victory over derby rivals Liverpool. Royle dragged Everton clear of relegation and led the club to the FA Cup for the fifth time in their history by defeating Manchester United 1–0 in the final. The cup triumph was also Everton&#x27;s passport to the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, their first European campaign in the post-Heysel era. Progress under Royle continued in 1995–96 as the team climbed to sixth place in the Premiership. A fifteenth-place finish the following season saw Royle resign towards the end of the campaign, and he was temporarily replaced by club captain Dave Watson.

Howard Kendall was appointed Everton manager for the third time in 1997, but the appointment proved unsuccessful as Everton finished seventeenth in the Premiership. The club only avoided relegation due to their superior goal difference over Bolton Wanderers. Former Rangers manager Walter Smith then took over from Kendall in the summer of 1998, but only managed three successive finishes in the bottom half of the table. The Everton board finally ran out of patience with Smith, and he was sacked in March 2002 after an FA Cup exit at Middlesbrough and with Everton in real danger of relegation. His replacement, David Moyes, guided Everton to a safe finish in fifteenth place.
In 2002–03 Everton finished seventh, which was their highest finish since 1996. It was under Moyes&#x27; management that Wayne Rooney broke into the first team before being sold to Manchester United for a club record fee of £28 million in the summer of 2004. A fourth-place finish in 2004–05 ensured that Everton qualified for the UEFA Champions League qualifying round. The team failed to make it through to the Champions League group stage and were then eliminated from the UEFA Cup. Everton qualified for the 2007–08 and 2008–09 UEFA Cup competitions, and was the runner-up in the 2009 FA Cup final. During this period, Moyes broke the club record for highest transfer fee paid on four occasions: signing James Beattie for £6 million in January 2005, Andy Johnson for £8.6 million in summer 2006, Yakubu for £11.25 million in summer 2007, and Marouane Fellaini for £15 million in September 2008.At the end of the 2012–13 season, Moyes left his position at Everton to take over at Manchester United, and was replaced by Roberto Martínez. Martínez led Everton to 5th place in the Premier League in his first season while amassing the club&#x27;s best points tally in 27 years with 72. The following season, he led Everton to the last 16 of the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League, where they were defeated by Dynamo Kyiv, whilst domestically finishing 11th in the Premier League. Everton reached the semi-finals of both the League Cup and the FA Cup in 2015–16, but were defeated in both. After a poor run of form in the Premier League, Martínez was sacked following the penultimate game of the season, with Everton lying in 12th place.

Martínez was replaced in the summer of 2016 by former Southampton manager Ronald Koeman. In his first season at the club, he qualified for the Europa League, but a poor start to the 2017–18 season left Everton in the relegation zone after nine games, and Koeman was sacked on 23 October following a 5–2 home defeat to Arsenal. Sam Allardyce succeeded him, but he resigned at the end of the season amid fan discontent at his style of play.

Marco Silva was named Everton manager in May 2018. In November that year, the club was banned from signing academy football players from their youth clubs for two years. Silva led Everton to finish 8th in his first season in charge, but after a poor start to the following season which left the team in the relegation zone, he was sacked on 5 December 2019. His last league match was a 5–2 loss to Liverpool at Anfield. Former player and first-team coach Duncan Ferguson stepped in as caretaker manager for the next three games before his replacement, Carlo Ancelotti; Ferguson stayed as assistant manager.

Ancelotti left the club in June 2021 to rejoin former club Real Madrid as manager, having led the club to a 10th-place finish in his only full season at the club. Former Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez was appointed as his replacement, subsequently becoming only the second person to manage both Liverpool and Everton. He was dismissed in January 2022 following 9 losses in his last 13 games in charge at the club, and was replaced by former Chelsea boss Frank Lampard. Lampard was later also dismissed in January 2023 after a poor run of results. Everton narrowly escaped relegation with a 1–0 win over Bournemouth in their last game of the 2022–23 Premier League under the management of new boss Sean Dyche.

On 17 November 2023, the club received a 10-point deduction with immediate effect for breaches of the Premier League&#x27;s profit and sustainability rules. The club had made losses of £124.5 million in the three years up to 2021–22, with the limit being £105 million. It was the biggest points deduction in Premier League history, surpassing the nine taken from Portsmouth in 2010. Everton submitted an appeal to the decision, arguing that the commission was biased and that the punishment was excessive and unfair. On 24 January 2024, Everton were charged with further breaches of Premier League financial rules after &quot;sustaining losses above the permitted thresholds for the assessment period ending season 2022-23&quot;.

On 9 January 2025 Dyche was relieved of his duties.

== Colours and badge ==
Everton&#x27;s traditional home colours are royal blue shirts, white shorts and white socks. However, during the first decades of their history, Everton had several different kit colours. The team originally played in white and then blue and white stripes, but as new players arriving at the club wore their old team&#x27;s shirts during matches, confusion soon ensued. It was decided that the shirts would be dyed black, both to save on expenses and to instill a more professional look. However, the kit appeared morbid, so a scarlet sash was added. When the club moved to Goodison Park in 1892, the colours were salmon pink and dark blue striped shirts with dark blue shorts. The club later switched to ruby shirts with blue trim and dark blue shorts. Royal blue jerseys with white shorts were first used in the 1901–02 season. The club played in sky blue in 1906; however, the fans protested, and the colour reverted to royal blue. Occasionally, Everton have played in lighter shades than royal blue (such as in 1930–31 and 1997–98). The home kit today is royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks. The club may also wear all blue to avoid any colour clashes.

Everton&#x27;s traditional away colours were white shirts with black shorts, but from 1968 amber shirts and royal blue shorts became common. Various editions appeared throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Black, white, grey, and yellow away shirts have also been used.
At the end of the 1937–38 season, Everton secretary Theo Kelly, who later became the club&#x27;s first manager, wanted to design a club necktie. It was agreed that the colour be blue, and Kelly was given the task of designing a crest to be featured on the necktie. He worked on it for four months until deciding on a reproduction of Everton Lock-Up, which stands in the heart of the Everton district. The Lock-Up has been linked with the Everton area since its construction in 1787. It was originally used as a bridewell to incarcerate mainly drunks and minor criminals and it still stands on Everton Brow. The Lock-Up was accompanied by two laurel wreaths on either side and, according to the College of Arms in London, Kelly chose to include the laurels as they were the sign of winners. The crest was accompanied by the club motto, &quot;Nil satis nisi optimum&quot;, meaning &quot;Nothing but the best is good enough&quot;. The ties were first worn by Kelly and the Everton chairman, Mr. E. Green, on the first day of the 1938–39 season.

The club rarely incorporated a badge of any description on their shirts. An interwoven &quot;EFC&quot; design was adopted between 1922 and 1930 before the club reverted to plain royal blue shirts until 1972 when bold &quot;EFC&quot; lettering was added. The crest designed by Kelly was first used on the team&#x27;s shirts in 1978 and has remained there ever since, while undergoing gradual change to become the version used today.

In May 2013, the club launched a new crest to improve the reproducibility of the design in print and broadcast media, particularly on a small scale. Critics suggested that it was external pressure from sports manufacturer Nike, Inc. that evoked the redesign as the number of colours had been reduced and the radial effect was removed, which made the kit more cost efficient to reproduce. The redesign was poorly received by supporters, with a poll on an Everton fan site registering a 91% negative response to the crest. A protest petition reached over 22,000 signatures before the club offered an apology and announced a new crest would be created for the 2014–15 season with an emphasis on fan consultation. Shortly afterwards, the Head of Marketing left the club. The latest crest was revealed by the club on 3 October 2013. After a consultation process with the supporters, three new crests were shortlisted. In the final vote, the new crest was chosen by almost 80% of the supporters that took part and began being used in July 2014.

=== Nickname ===
Everton&#x27;s most widely recognised nickname is &quot;The Toffees&quot; or &quot;The Toffeemen&quot;, which came about after Everton had moved to Goodison. There are several explanations for how this name came to be adopted with the best known being that there was a business in Everton village, between Everton Brow and Brow Side, named Mother Noblett&#x27;s, which was a toffee shop that sold sweets including Everton Mints (a type of humbug). It was also located opposite the lock-up on which Everton&#x27;s club crest is based. The Toffee Lady tradition, in which a girl walks around the perimeter of the pitch before the start of a game tossing free Everton Mints into the crowd, symbolises the connection. Another possible reason is that there was a house named &quot;Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House&quot; in nearby Village Street, Everton, run by Ma Bushell. The toffee house was located near the Queen&#x27;s Head hotel in which early club meetings took place.

Everton have had many other nicknames over the years. When the black kit was worn, the team were nicknamed &quot;The Black Watch&quot; after the famous army regiment. Since going blue in 1901, the team have been given the simple nickname &quot;The Blues.&quot; Everton&#x27;s attractive style of play led to Steve Bloomer calling the team &quot;scientific&quot; in 1928, which is thought to have inspired the nickname &quot;The School of Science&quot;. The battling 1995 FA Cup winning side were known collectively as &quot;The Dogs of War&quot;. In 2002, when David Moyes arrived as manager, he proclaimed Everton &quot;The People&#x27;s Club&quot;, which has been adopted as a semi-official club nickname.

== Stadiums ==

=== Early grounds ===
Everton originally played in the southeast corner of Stanley Park. The first official match took place in 1879. In 1882, a man named J. Cruitt donated land at Priory Road which became the club&#x27;s home. In 1884 Everton became tenants at Anfield, which was owned by John Orrell, a land owner who was a friend of Everton F.C. member John Houlding. Orrell lent Anfield to the club in exchange for a small rent. Houlding purchased the land from Orrell in 1885 and effectively became Everton&#x27;s landlord by charging the club rent, which increased from £100 to £240 a year by 1888 – and was still rising until Everton left the ground in 1892. The club regarded the increase in rent as unacceptable. A further dispute between Houlding and the club&#x27;s committee led to Houlding attempting to gain full control of the club by registering the company, &quot;Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd&quot;. Everton left Anfield for a new ground, Goodison Park, where the club has played ever since. Houlding attempted to take over Everton&#x27;s name, colours, fixtures and league position, but was denied by The Football Association. Instead, Houlding formed a new club, Liverpool F.C.

=== Goodison Park ===
Goodison Park, the first major football stadium to be built in England, was opened in 1892. Goodison Park has staged more top-flight football games than any other ground in the United Kingdom and was the only English club ground to host a semi-final at the 1966 FIFA World Cup. It was also the first English ground to have under-soil heating and the first to have two tiers on all sides. The church grounds of St Luke the Evangelist are adjacent to the corner of the Main Stand and the Howard Kendall Gwladys Street End.

On match days, in a tradition going back to 1962, players walk out to the tune &quot;Johnny Todd&quot;, played in the arrangement used when it was the theme song for &quot;Z-Cars&quot;. It is a traditional Liverpool children&#x27;s song collected in 1890 by Frank Kidson and tells the story of a sailor betrayed by his lover while away at sea. On two occasions in 1994, the club walked out to different songs. In August 1994, the club played 2 Unlimited&#x27;s song &quot;Get Ready For This&quot;. A month later, the club used a reworking of the Creedence Clearwater Revival classic &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot;. Both songs were met with complete disapproval by Everton fans.

===Everton Stadium ===
Talks regarding a new Everton stadium began in 1996. The original plan was for a 60,000-seat stadium, followed by a proposal for a 55,000-seat stadium at King&#x27;s Dock, which was rejected due to funding issues. In 2004, Everton entered talks with Liverpool F.C. about sharing a proposed stadium on Stanley Park, but negotiations broke down as Everton could not raise 50% of the costs.

Everton secured planning permission for the new Everton Stadium stadium in July 2021. Construction began in August 2021, with contractors Laing O&#x27;Rourke leading the project. The first phase involved infilling the dock with 500,000 cubic metres of sea-dredged sand and installing 2,500 vertical concrete piles. The stadium will have a capacity of 52,888 and is set to open for the start of the 2025–26 season, replacing Goodison Park, at an estimated cost of £760 million.

== Training grounds ==

From 1966 to 2007, Everton trained at Bellefield in the West Derby area of Liverpool. In 2007, the club moved to the Finch Farm training complex in Halewood after acquiring it the previous year. The first team squad officially moved to the complex on 9 October 2007. The training ground is now used by both the Everton men and women&#x27;s first team and the youth academy. The training ground features 10 full-size grass pitches across three slabs, one of which is a floodlit pitch along with a synthetic pitch with additional floodlights and dedicated training areas for fitness and goalkeeping training, as well as a recreated Goodison Park pitch. Within the training complex, there are changing facilities for senior players and academy players. Facilities include: fitness centre, synthetic indoor training pitch, hydrotherapy pool, spa, sauna, physiotherapy room, media centre, video lounge including video editing suite.

== Support ==
Everton has a large fanbase, with the eighth-highest average attendance in the Premier League in the 2008–09 season. The club&#x27;s supporters are colloquially known as Evertonians or Blues. The majority of Everton&#x27;s matchday support comes from the North West of England, primarily Merseyside, Cheshire, West Lancashire and parts of Western Greater Manchester along with many fans who travel from North Wales, Ireland, and Scotland. Within the city of Liverpool, support for Everton and city rivals Liverpool is not determined by geographical basis with supporters mixed across the city. Everton also has many supporters&#x27; clubs worldwide in places such as North America, Singapore, Indonesia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Thailand, India, and Australia. Paul McCartney is an Everton supporter. The official supporters club is &quot;FOREVERTON&quot;, and there are also several fanzines including &quot;When Skies are Grey&quot; and &quot;Speke from the Harbour&quot;, which are sold around Goodison Park on match days.

Everton regularly take large numbers away from home both domestically and in European fixtures. The club implements a loyalty points scheme offering the first opportunity to purchase away tickets to season ticket holders who have attended the most away matches. Everton often sell out the full allocation in away grounds, and tickets sell particularly well for North West England away matches. In October 2009, Everton took 7,000 travelling fans to Benfica, which was their largest ever away crowd in Europe since the 1985 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final.

=== Rivalries ===
Everton&#x27;s biggest rivalry is with neighbours Liverpool, against whom the club contests the Merseyside derby. The rivalry stems from an internal dispute between Everton officials and the owners of Anfield, which was then Everton&#x27;s home ground. The dispute resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park and the subsequent formation of Liverpool F.C. in 1892. Following these events, a fierce rivalry has existed between Everton and Liverpool, albeit one that is generally perceived as more respectful than many other derbies in English football. This was illustrated by a chain of red and blue scarves that were linked between the gates of both grounds across Stanley Park as a tribute to the Liverpool fans killed in the Hillsborough disaster. The derby is usually a sellout fixture and has been known as the &quot;friendly derby&quot; because both sets of fans can often be seen side by side dressed in red and blue inside both Anfield and Goodison Park. On the field, matches have tended to be extremely stormy affairs; the derby has had more red cards than any other fixture in Premier League history.

== Ownership and finances ==
Everton F.C. is a limited company with the board of directors holding a majority of the shares. The club&#x27;s most recent accounts, from May 2014, show a net total debt of £28.1 million, with a turnover of £120.5 million and a profit of £28.2 million. The club&#x27;s overdraft with Barclays Bank is secured against the Premier League&#x27;s &quot;Basic Award Fund&quot;, which is a guaranteed sum given to clubs for competing in the Premier League. Everton agreed to a long-term loan of £30 million with Bear Stearns and Prudential plc in 2002 for a duration of 25 years. The loan was a consolidation of debts at the time as well as a source of capital for new player acquisitions. Goodison Park is secured as collateral. On 27 February 2016, it was announced that Farhad Moshiri would buy a 49.9% stake in the club. On 15 September 2023, Everton announced that Miami-based 777 Partners had signed an agreement with Farhad Moshiri to acquire his full 94.1% stake in the club, pending ratification by the Premier League through the owners&#x27; and directors&#x27; test. The takeover collapsed as it did not meet its deadline of 1 June 2024. This deal collapsed on 19 July 2024 due to issues in regards to debts to 777 partners and A-Cap Holdings

On 21 June 2024, Everton announced an exclusivity agreement with the Friedkin Group, owners of Serie A club A.S. Roma. On 23 September 2024, Everton and the Friedkin Group released a joint statement that an agreement on the terms of sale had been reached pending approval from the Premier League, the Football Association and the Financial Conduct Authority. On 14 December, Friedkin officially received approval from the Premier League to acquire Everton, and five days later he officially acquired the club.

Figures taken from 2013 to 2014 accounts.

&quot;Total amount of shares owned by board members will remain at 128,781 until further clarification regarding the future of late Chairman Bill Kenwright CBE&#x27;s shares in the club.&quot;

=== Shirt sponsors and manufacturers ===
Since the 2022–23 season, the club&#x27;s primary shirt sponsor has been online betting company Stake.com, after the club announced the early termination of the previous deal with SportPesa in February 2020. Partners with Stake became a club-record sponsorship deal. Ahead of the Premier League season, the Stake.com features on the front of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s playing shirts as well as appearing on screens and media backdrops at Goodison Park and Finch Farm. The sponsorship does not extend to the club&#x27;s women&#x27;s team, who for the first time are able to sign their own shirt sponsor. Previous sponsors include Cazoo (2020–2022), SportPesa (2017–20), Chang Beer (2004–17) Hafnia (1979–85), NEC (1985–95), Danka (1995–97), one2one (1997–2002) and Kejian (2002–04). For the 2008–09 season, Everton sold junior replica jerseys without the current name or logo of their main sponsor Chang beer, which followed a recommendation from the Portman Group that alcoholic brand names be removed from kits sold to children.

Everton&#x27;s kit manufacturers from 2020-2024 were Hummel, after a previous deal with Umbro was terminated early by the club. Umbro have been the club&#x27;s kit manufacturer four times (1974–83, 1986–2000, 2004–09, and 2014–20). Other previous manufacturing firms are Le Coq Sportif (1983–86, 2009–12), Puma (2000–04) and Nike (2012–14). After Everton&#x27;s contract with Hummel ended at the end of the 2023-24 season, on June 14, 2024 the club entered a multi-year agreement with UK based kit manufacturer Castore.

The club currently has two &#x27;megastores&#x27;: one located near Goodison Park on Walton Lane named &#x27;Everton One&#x27; and one located in the Liverpool One shopping complex named &#x27;Everton Two&#x27;, which gives the second store the address &#x27;Everton Two, Liverpool One&#x27;.

=== Financial Fair Play ===
In March 2023, the Premier League referred Everton to an independent commission to investigate alleged breaches of Financial Fair Play from the 2021–2022 season. The investigation concluded in November 2023 that Everton breached Financial Fair Play regulations after reporting a loss of £371.8m over three years, where under Premier League rules, clubs are allowed to lose a maximum of £105m over three years. As a result, Everton were deducted 10 points, the heaviest punishment in Premier League history. At the time, Everton were on 14 points after 12 games, sitting 14th in the league table; the points deduction dropped Everton to 19th, in the Premier League&#x27;s relegation zone. Everton said they were &quot;both shocked and disappointed by the ruling of the Premier League&#x27;s Commission&quot; and had communicated their &quot;intention to appeal the decision to the Premier League.&quot; Liverpool MP Ian Byrne took the 10-point deduction to the House of Commons calling for the suspension of any proceedings and sanctions, describing the deduction as &quot;grossly unfair&quot;.

== In the community ==
Everton&#x27;s community department, Everton in the Community (EitC), is a charity that provides sports and other social activities for the local community including for people with disabilities. EitC represents the club in the European Multisport Club Association.

=== Relationships with other clubs ===
Everton is connected to many other sports clubs and organisations. It has links with Irish football academy Ballyoulster United in Celbridge, the Canadian Ontario Soccer Association, and the Thai Football Association (where there is a competition named the Chang-Everton Cup, competed for by local schoolboys). The club also has a football academy in the Cypriot city of Limassol and a partnership agreement with American club Pittsburgh Riverhounds.

Everton has links with Chilean team Everton de Viña del Mar, who were named after the club. On 4 August 2010, the two Evertons played each other in a friendly match at Goodison Park named the &quot;Copa Hermandad&quot; to mark the centenary of the Chilean team. The occasion was organised by the Ruleteros Society, which was founded to promote connections between the two clubs. Other Everton clubs also exist in Colonia in Uruguay, La Plata and Río Cuarto in Argentina, Elk Grove in the U.S. state of California, and Cork in Ireland. There was also a team named Everton in Trinidad and Tobago. There was an Everton club in Auckland, New Zealand from 1907 to 1915 named because of the first FA Cup win.

The club owned and operated a professional basketball team by the name of the Everton Tigers, who competed in the top-tier British Basketball League. The team was launched in the summer of 2007 as part of the club&#x27;s Community programme and played their home games at the Greenbank Sports Academy in Liverpool&#x27;s Mossley Hill suburb. The team was an amalgam of the Toxteth Tigers community youth programme, which started in 1968. The team quickly became one of the most successful in the league by winning the BBL Cup in 2009 and the play-offs in 2010. However, Everton withdrew funding before the 2010–11 season and the team was re-launched as the Mersey Tigers.

== In popular culture ==
=== Film and TV ===
Ken Loach&#x27;s 1969 television film &quot;The Golden Vision&quot; combined improvised drama with documentary footage to tell the story of a group of Everton fans for whom the main purpose of life—following the team—is interrupted by such inconveniences as work and weddings. Everton forward Alex Young, whose nickname was also the title of the film, appeared as himself.

Paul Greengrass&#x27;s 1997 television film &quot;The Fix&quot; dramatised the true story of a match-fixing scandal in which the club&#x27;s newest player Tony Kay (played by Jason Isaacs) is implicated in having helped to throw a match between his previous club Sheffield Wednesday and Ipswich Town. The majority of the story is set during Everton&#x27;s 1962–63 League Championship winning season, with manager Harry Catterick played by Colin Welland.

In the 2015 &quot;Rocky&quot; film &quot;Creed&quot;, Goodison Park serves as the venue of the climactic fight scene. Footage of the stadium and crowd during a home game against West Bromwich Albion was used for the scene. Liverpool-born boxing champion Tony Bellew, a lifelong Everton fan, plays Creed&#x27;s opponent and wore the Everton badge on his training gear and shorts.

=== Music ===
The club entered the UK singles chart on four occasions under different titles during the 1980s and 1990s, when many clubs each released a song to mark reaching the FA Cup Final. &quot;The Boys in Blue&quot;, released in 1984, peaked at No. 82. The following year, the club scored their biggest hit when &quot;Here We Go&quot; peaked at No. 14. In 1986, Everton released &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Cheering the Blues&quot;, which reached No. 83. &quot;All Together Now&quot;, a reworking of a song by Liverpool band The Farm, was released for the 1995 FA Cup final and reached No. 27. By the time the club reached the 2009 FA Cup final, the tradition had largely been abandoned by all clubs and no song was released

=== Club captains ===
Since 1888, 48 players have held the position of club captain for Everton. The club&#x27;s first captain was Nick Ross, who captained Everton during the 1888-89 season. The longest-serving captain is Peter Farrell, who was club captain for 9 years – from 1948 to 1957. Despite his long tenure, Peter Farrell never won a trophy at Everton. Kevin Ratcliffe, who captained Everton during their most successful period in history, is Everton&#x27;s most decorated captain. He won 7 trophies as captain, including 2 First Division titles, 4 Charity Shields, and 1 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. Everton&#x27;s current captain is Séamus Coleman. He has been captain since Phil Jagielka left the club in 2019.

=== Notable managers ===

The club&#x27;s current manager is David Moyes who returned for his second spell at the club taking over from Sean Dyche in January 2025. There have also been four caretaker managers, and before 1939 the team was selected by either the club secretary or by committee. The club&#x27;s longest-serving manager has been Harry Catterick, who was in charge of the team from 1961 to 1973 for 594 first team matches. The Everton manager to win the most domestic and international trophies is Howard Kendall, who won two First Division championships, the 1984 FA Cup, the 1985 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, and three FA Charity Shields.

== Records and statistics ==
Neville Southall holds the record for the most Everton appearances with 751 first-team matches between 1981 and 1997. The late centre half and former captain Brian Labone comes in second with 534 matches. The longest serving player is goalkeeper Ted Sagar, who played for 23 years between 1929 and 1953. This tenure covered both sides of the Second World War and included a total of 495 appearances. Southall also previously held the record for the most league clean sheets during a season with 15. However, this record was beaten during the 2008–09 season by American goalkeeper Tim Howard, who ended the season with 17 clean sheets. The club&#x27;s top goalscorer, with 383 goals in all competitions, is Dixie Dean; the second-highest goalscorer is Graeme Sharp with 159. Dean still holds the English national record of most goals in a season with 60.

The record attendance for an Everton home match is 78,299 against Liverpool on 18 September 1948. Remarkably, there was only one injury at this game, which occurred when Tom Fleetwood was hit on the head by a coin thrown from the crowd whilst he marched around the perimeter and played the cornet with St Edward&#x27;s Orphanage Band. Goodison Park, like all major English football grounds since the recommendations of the Taylor Report were implemented, is now an all-seater and only holds just under 40,000, meaning it is unlikely that this attendance record will ever be broken at Goodison. Everton&#x27;s record transfer paid was to Swansea City for the Icelandic midfielder Gylfi Sigurðsson for a sum of £45m in 2017. The sale of Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United the same year was for an initial sum of £75m, the largest sum Everton has received for a player and then the largest transfer between two English clubs.

Everton hold the record for the most seasons in England&#x27;s top tier (Division One/Premier League), with 119 seasons out of 123, as of completion of the 2021–22 season (the club played in Division 2 in 1930–31 and from 1951 to 1954). They are one of six teams to have played in every season of the Premier League since its inception in August 1992 – the others being Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur. Everton against Aston Villa is the most played fixture in England&#x27;s top flight. As of the 2023–24 season, the two founding members of the Football League have played a record 212 league games.

<text>Louis François Antoine Arbogast (4 October 1759 – 8 April 1803) was a French mathematician. He was born at Mutzig in Alsace and died at Strasbourg, where he was professor. He wrote on series and the derivatives known by his name: he was the first writer to separate the symbols of operation from those of quantity, introducing systematically the operator notation &quot;DF&quot; for the derivative of the function &quot;F&quot;. In 1800, he published a calculus treatise where the first known statement of what is currently known as Faà di Bruno&#x27;s formula appears, 55 years before the first published paper of Francesco Faà di Bruno on that topic.

== Biography ==
He was professor of mathematics at the Collège de Colmar and entered a mathematical competition run by the St Petersburg Academy. His entry was to bring him fame and an important place in the history of the development of the calculus. Arbogast submitted an essay to the St Petersburg Academy in which he came down firmly on the side of Euler. In fact he went much further than Euler in the type of arbitrary functions introduced by integrating partial differential equations, claiming that the functions could be discontinuous not only in the limited sense claimed by Euler, but discontinuous in a more general sense that he defined that allowed piecewise functions consisting of portions of different curves. Arbogast won the prize with his essay, and his notion of discontinuous function became important in Cauchy&#x27;s more rigorous approach to analysis.

In 1789 he submitted in Strasbourg a major report on the differential and integral calculus to the Académie des Sciences in Paris which was never published. In the Preface of a later work he described the ideas that prompted him to write the major report of 1789. Essentially he realised that there were no rigorous methods to show convergence of series. In addition to his mathematics post, he was appointed as professor of physics at the Collège Royal in Strasbourg and from April 1791 he served as its rector until October 1791 when he was appointed rector of the University of Strasbourg; in 1794 he was appointed Professor of Calculus at the École centrale des travaux publics et militarisée (soon to become École Polytechnique) but he taught at the École préparatoire.

His contributions to mathematics show him as a philosophical thinker. As well as introducing discontinuous functions, he described calculus with operational symbols. The formal algebraic manipulation of series investigated by Lagrange and Laplace in the 1770s was put in the form of operational calculus by Arbogast in 1800. He coined the term &quot;factorial&quot; for a product of a finite number of terms in arithmetic progression.

<text>Mars were an American, New York City-based no wave experimental noise rock band, formed in 1975 when China Burg (née Constance Burg; a.k.a. Lucy Hamilton) (guitar, vocals) and artist Nancy Arlen (drums) brought Mark Cunningham (bass) and vocalist Sumner Crane together to talk about music. They were joined briefly by guitarist Rudolph Grey of Red Transistor. The band played one live gig under the name China before changing it to Mars. They played a mixture of angular compositions and freeform noise music jams, featuring surrealist lyrics and non-standard drumming. All the members were said to be completely untrained in music before forming the band.

== History ==
Mars played Live about two dozen times, all in Manhattan. Their first show was at CBGB&#x27;s in January 1977; their last one was at Max&#x27;s Kansas City on December 10, 1978. Their recorded debut was the &quot;3-E&quot;/ &quot;11,000 Volts&quot; 7-inch single was recorded and mixed by Jay Dee Daugherty and Brooke Delarco under the direction of Lenny Kaye and later released by Rebel Records/ ZE Records. The group then released a single live EP in 1979 or 1980, though they had broken up in 1978. Both recordings were compiled by Lydia Lunch&#x27;s self-run label, Widowspeak Records, in 1986, as &quot;78&quot;; the songs were slightly remixed and tweaked by Jim Thirlwell (a.k.a. Foetus). It was reissued by Atavistic Records on CD in 1996 as &quot;78+&quot;.

In 1978, Mars appeared on the influential &quot;No New York&quot; compilation LP produced by Brian Eno, along with DNA, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, and James Chance and the Contortions, which helped to bring the nascent No Wave genre into the foreground. An All Music reviewer wrote of their contributions: &quot;Mars creates interesting music out of apparent chaos; the vocals are babbled and the guitars, bass and drums sound like they&#x27;re weaving in and out of the song while going in several different directions at once, yet the band is oddly compelling in its crazed, cacophonous way.&quot;

=== Post-breakup ===
In 1985, China Burg collaborated with Lunch on the album &quot;The Drowning of Lucy Hamilton.&quot;

Due to complaints about Thirlwell&#x27;s modifications on &quot;78&quot;/&quot;78+&quot;, the full studio recordings of Mars (totaling about 30 minutes) surfaced in 2003 on the Spanish labels G3G and Spookysound. Cunningham ran both Hyrax Records and Spookysound Records. (To clarify: &quot;78&quot;, &quot;78+&quot;, and &quot;Mars LP: The Complete Studio Recordings, NYC 1977–1978&quot; all feature essentially the same half-hour batch of music, but with very slight auditory differences.) After the breakup of Mars, Cunningham was part of the bizarre &quot;John Gavanti&quot; &quot;no wave opera&quot; project with Crane, Arto Lindsay, and others. He has also worked with the band Don King, and with his current outfit, Convolution. The &quot;MARS EP&quot;, on Charles Ball’s Lust/Unlust label, was recorded in December 1978 in one live session and was the last time the band played together. The songs included on the EP were: &quot;N.N. End&quot;, &quot;Scorn&quot;, &quot;Outside Africa&quot;, &quot;Monopoly&quot; and &quot;Immediate Stages of the Erotic&quot;.

Crane died of lymphoma on April 15, 2003. Arlen died on September 17, 2006, following heart surgery.

<text>Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov (, 25 April 1903 – 20 October 1987) was a Soviet mathematician who played a central role in the creation of modern probability theory. He also contributed to the mathematics of topology, intuitionistic logic, turbulence, classical mechanics, algorithmic information theory and computational complexity.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Andrey Kolmogorov was born in Tambov, about 500 kilometers southeast of Moscow, in 1903. His unmarried mother, Maria Yakovlevna Kolmogorova, died giving birth to him. Andrey was raised by two of his aunts in Tunoshna (near Yaroslavl) at the estate of his grandfather, a well-to-do nobleman.

Little is known about Andrey&#x27;s father. He was supposedly named Nikolai Matveyevich Katayev and had been an agronomist. Katayev had been exiled from Saint Petersburg to the Yaroslavl province after his participation in the revolutionary movement against the tsars. He disappeared in 1919 and was presumed to have been killed in the Russian Civil War.

Andrey Kolmogorov was educated in his aunt Vera&#x27;s village school, and his earliest literary efforts and mathematical papers were printed in the school journal &quot;The Swallow of Spring&quot;. Andrey (at the age of five) was the &quot;editor&quot; of the mathematical section of this journal. Kolmogorov&#x27;s first mathematical discovery was published in this journal: at the age of five he noticed the regularity in the sum of the series of odd numbers: formula_1 etc.

In 1910, his aunt adopted him, and they moved to Moscow, where he graduated from high school in 1920. Later that same year, Kolmogorov began to study at Moscow State University and at the same time Mendeleev Moscow Institute of Chemistry and Technology. Kolmogorov writes about this time: &quot;I arrived at Moscow University with a fair knowledge of mathematics. I knew in particular the beginning of set theory. I studied many questions in articles in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Brockhaus and Efron&quot;, filling out for myself what was presented too concisely in these articles.&quot;

Kolmogorov gained a reputation for his wide-ranging erudition. While an undergraduate student in college, he attended the seminars of the Russian historian S. V. Bakhrushin, and he published his first research paper on the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries&#x27; landholding practices in the Novgorod Republic. During the same period (1921–22), Kolmogorov worked out and proved several results in set theory and in the theory of Fourier series.

===Adulthood===
In 1922, Kolmogorov gained international recognition for constructing a Fourier series that diverges almost everywhere. Around this time, he decided to devote his life to mathematics.

In 1925, Kolmogorov graduated from Moscow State University and began to study under the supervision of Nikolai Luzin. He formed a lifelong close friendship with Pavel Alexandrov, a fellow student of Luzin; indeed, several researchers have concluded that the two friends were sexually involved, although neither acknowledged this openly. Kolmogorov (together with Aleksandr Khinchin) became interested in probability theory. Also in 1925, he published his work in intuitionistic logic, &quot;On the principle of the excluded middle,&quot; in which he proved that under a certain interpretation all statements of classical formal logic can be formulated as those of intuitionistic logic. In 1929, Kolmogorov earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree from Moscow State University. In 1929, Kolmogorov and Alexandrov during a long travel stayed about a month in an island in lake Sevan in Armenia.

In 1930, Kolmogorov went on his first long trip abroad, traveling to Göttingen and Munich and then to Paris. He had various scientific contacts in Göttingen, first with Richard Courant and his students working on limit theorems, where diffusion processes proved to be the limits of discrete random processes, then with Hermann Weyl in intuitionistic logic, and lastly with Edmund Landau in function theory. His pioneering work &quot;About the Analytical Methods of Probability Theory&quot; was published (in German) in 1931. Also in 1931, he became a professor at Moscow State University.

In 1933, Kolmogorov published his book &quot;Foundations of the Theory of Probability&quot;, laying the modern axiomatic foundations of probability theory and establishing his reputation as the world&#x27;s leading expert in this field. In 1935, Kolmogorov became the first chairman of the department of probability theory at Moscow State University. Around the same years (1936) Kolmogorov contributed to the field of ecology and generalized the Lotka–Volterra model of predator–prey systems.

During the Great Purge in 1936, Kolmogorov&#x27;s doctoral advisor Nikolai Luzin became a high-profile target of Stalin&#x27;s regime in what is now called the &quot;Luzin Affair.&quot; Kolmogorov and several other students of Luzin testified against Luzin, accusing him of plagiarism, nepotism, and other forms of misconduct; the hearings eventually concluded that he was a servant to &quot;fascistoid science&quot; and thus an enemy of the Soviet people. Luzin lost his academic positions, but curiously he was neither arrested nor expelled from the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. The question of whether Kolmogorov and others were coerced into testifying against their teacher remains a topic of considerable speculation among historians; all parties involved refused to publicly discuss the case for the rest of their lives. Soviet-Russian mathematician Semën Samsonovich Kutateladze concluded in 2013, after reviewing archival documents made available during the 1990s and other surviving testimonies, that the students of Luzin had initiated the accusations against Luzin out of personal acrimony; there was no definitive evidence that the students were coerced by the state, nor was there any definitive evidence to support their allegations of academic misconduct. Soviet historian of mathematics A.P. Yushkevich surmised that, unlike many of the other high-profile persecutions of the era, Stalin did not personally initiate the persecution of Luzin and instead eventually concluded that he was not a threat to the regime, which would explain the unusually mild punishment relative to other contemporaries.

In a 1938 paper, Kolmogorov &quot;established the basic theorems for smoothing and predicting stationary stochastic processes&quot;—a paper that had major military applications during the Cold War. In 1939, he was elected a full member (academician) of the USSR Academy of Sciences.

During World War II Kolmogorov contributed to the Soviet war effort by applying statistical theory to artillery fire, developing a scheme of stochastic distribution of barrage balloons intended to help protect Moscow from German bombers during the Battle of Moscow.

In his study of stochastic processes, especially Markov processes, Kolmogorov and the British mathematician Sydney Chapman independently developed a pivotal set of equations in the field that have been given the name of the Chapman–Kolmogorov equations.


Later, Kolmogorov focused his research on turbulence, beginning his publications in 1941. In classical mechanics, he is best known for the Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem, first presented in 1954 at the International Congress of Mathematicians. In 1957, working jointly with his student Vladimir Arnold, he solved a particular interpretation of Hilbert&#x27;s thirteenth problem. Around this time he also began to develop, and has since been considered a founder of, algorithmic complexity theory – often referred to as Kolmogorov complexity theory.

Kolmogorov married Anna Dmitrievna Egorova in 1942. He pursued a vigorous teaching routine throughout his life both at the university level and also with younger children, as he was actively involved in developing a pedagogy for gifted children in literature, music, and mathematics. At Moscow State University, Kolmogorov occupied different positions including the heads of several departments: probability, statistics, and random processes; mathematical logic. He also served as the Dean of the Moscow State University Department of Mechanics and Mathematics.

In 1971, Kolmogorov joined an oceanographic expedition aboard the research vessel &quot;Dmitri Mendeleev.&quot; He wrote a number of articles for the &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia.&quot; In his later years, he devoted much of his effort to the mathematical and philosophical relationship between probability theory in abstract and applied areas.

Kolmogorov died in Moscow in 1987 and his remains were buried in the Novodevichy cemetery.

A quotation attributed to Kolmogorov is [translated into English]: &quot;Every mathematician believes that he is ahead of the others. The reason none state this belief in public is because they are intelligent people.&quot;

Vladimir Arnold once said: &quot;Kolmogorov – Poincaré – Gauss – Euler – Newton, are only five lives separating us from the source of our science.&quot;

<text>The Treaty of Amiens (, ) temporarily ended hostilities between France, the Spanish Empire, and the United Kingdom at the end of the War of the Second Coalition. It marked the end of the French Revolutionary Wars; after a short peace it set the stage for the Napoleonic Wars. Britain gave up most of its recent conquests; France was to evacuate Naples and Egypt. Britain retained Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Trinidad.

It was signed in the Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) of Amiens on 25 March 1802 (4 Germinal X in the French Revolutionary calendar) by Joseph Bonaparte and Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis as a &quot;Definitive Treaty of Peace&quot;. The consequent peace lasted only one year (18 May 1803) and was the only period of general peace in Europe between 1793 and 1814.

Under the treaty, Britain recognised the French Republic. Together with the Treaty of Lunéville (1801), the Treaty of Amiens marked the end of the Second Coalition, which had waged war against Revolutionary France since 1798.

== National goals==
The United Kingdom wanted the peace to enable restoration of trade with continental Europe. It also wanted to end its isolation from other powers, and achieved that goal by a rapprochement with Russia that provided the momentum to negotiate the treaty with France. The peace of Amiens also mollified the antiwar Whig opposition in Parliament.

Napoleon used the interlude for major internal reforms such as the promulgation of the new legal system under the Napoleonic Code, making peace with the Vatican by the Concordat, and issuing a new constitution that gave him lifetime control. France made territorial gains in Switzerland and Italy. However, Napoleon&#x27;s goal of a North American Empire collapsed with the failure of his army in Haiti, so he gave it up and sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States.

The Democratic-Republican administration of President Thomas Jefferson used British banks to fund the Louisiana Purchase, reduced the American military budget, and partly dismantled the Hamiltonian Federalist financial program. The French West Indies as result of the treaty no longer needed to use American ships to move their products to Europe. Although the terms of the Treaty did not favour his country, British Prime Minister Henry Addington used the interlude to rebuild British strength, so that when fighting renewed in spring 1803, the Royal Navy quickly gained control of the seas. However the isolationist foreign policy of the United States, which was hostile to both Britain and France, and strongly opposed by the Federalist minority in Congress, came under heavy pressure from all sides.

==Early diplomacy==
The War of the Second Coalition started well for the coalition, with successes in Egypt, Italy and Germany. The success proved to be short-lived, however; after France&#x27;s victories at the battles of Marengo and Hohenlinden, Austria, Russia and Naples sued for peace, with Austria eventually signing the Treaty of Lunéville. Horatio Nelson&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801 halted the creation of the League of Armed Neutrality and led to a negotiated ceasefire.

The French First Consul, Napoleon Bonaparte, first made truce proposals to British foreign secretary Lord Grenville as early as 1799. Because of the hardline stance of Grenville and Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger, their distrust of Bonaparte and obvious defects in the proposals, they were rejected out of hand. However, Pitt resigned in February 1801 over domestic issues and was replaced by the more accommodating Henry Addington. At that point Britain was motivated by the danger of a war with Russia.

Addington&#x27;s foreign secretary, Robert Jenkinson, Lord Hawkesbury, immediately opened communications with Louis Guillaume Otto, the French commissary for prisoners of war in London through whom Bonaparte had made his earlier proposals. Hawkesbury stated that he wanted to open discussions on terms for a peace agreement. Otto, generally under detailed instructions from Bonaparte, engaged in negotiations with Hawkesbury in mid-1801. Unhappy with the dialogue with Otto, Hawkesbury sent diplomat Anthony Merry to Paris, who opened a second line of communications with the French foreign minister, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord. By mid-September, written negotiations had progressed to the point that Hawkesbury and Otto met to draft a preliminary agreement. On 30 September, they signed the preliminary agreement in London, which was published the next day.
The terms of the preliminary agreement required Britain to restore most of the French colonial possessions that it had captured since 1794, to evacuate Malta and to withdraw from other occupied Mediterranean ports. Malta was to be restored to the Order of St. John, whose sovereignty was to be guaranteed by one or more powers, to be determined at the final peace. France was to restore Egypt to Ottoman control, to withdraw from most of the Italian peninsula and to agree to preserve Portuguese sovereignty. Ceylon, previously a Dutch territory, was to remain with the British, and Newfoundland fishery rights were to be restored to their prewar status. Britain was also to recognise the Seven Islands Republic, established by France on the Ionian Islands that are now part of Greece. Both sides were to be allowed access to the outposts on the Cape of Good Hope. In a blow to Spain, the preliminary agreement included a secret clause in which Trinidad was to remain with Britain. Spain would finally recover the island of Menorca.

News of the signing was greeted across Europe with joy. The celebrations of peace, the pamphlets, poems, and odes proliferated in French, English, German, and other languages. Actors happily depicted the treaty at dinner theatres, vaudeville, and the legitimate stage. In Britain there were illuminations and fireworks. Peace, it was thought in Britain, would lead to the withdrawal of the income tax imposed by Pitt, a reduction of grain prices and a revival of markets.

==Final negotiations==
In November 1801, Cornwallis was sent to France with plenipotentiary powers to negotiate a final agreement. The expectation among the British populace that peace was at hand put enormous pressure on Cornwallis, something that Bonaparte realised and capitalised on. The French negotiators, Napoleon&#x27;s brother Joseph as well as Talleyrand, constantly shifted their positions, leaving Cornwallis to write, &quot;I feel it as the most unpleasant circumstance attending this unpleasant business that, after I have obtained his acquiescence on any point, I can have no confidence that it is finally settled and that he will not recede from it in our next conversation.&quot; The Batavian Republic, whose economy depended on trade that had been ruined by the war, appointed Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck, its ambassador to France, to represent it in the peace negotiations. He arrived in Amiens on 9 December. The Dutch role in the negotiations was marked by a lack of respect on the part of the French, who thought of them as a &quot;vanquished and conquered&quot; client whose present government &quot;owed them everything&quot;.

Schimmelpenninck and Cornwallis negotiated agreements on the status of Ceylon, which was to remain British; the Cape Colony, which was to be returned to the Dutch but to be open to all; and the indemnification of the deposed House of Orange-Nassau for its losses. However, Joseph did not immediately agree to their terms, presumably needing to consult with the First Consul on the matter.
In January 1802, Napoleon travelled to Lyon to accept the presidency of the Italian Republic, a nominally-independent client republic that covered northern Italy and had been established in 1797. That act violated the Treaty of Lunéville, in which Bonaparte agreed to guarantee the independence of the Italian and other client republics. He also continued to support French General Pierre Augereau&#x27;s reactionary &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 18 September 1801 in the Batavian Republic and its new constitution that was ratified by a sham election and brought the republic into closer alignment with its dominant partner.

British newspaper readers followed the events, presented in strong moralising colours. Hawkesbury wrote of Bonaparte&#x27;s action at Lyon that it was a &quot;gross breach of faith&quot; exhibiting an &quot;inclination to insult Europe&quot;. Writing from London, he informed Cornwallis that it &quot;created the greatest alarm in this country, and there are many persons who were pacifically disposed and who since this event are desirous of renewing the war.&quot;

The Spanish negotiator, Marquis José Nicolás de Azara, did not arrive in Amiens until early February 1802. After some preliminary negotiations, he proposed to Cornwallis that Britain and Spain make a separate agreement, but Cornwallis rejected that in the belief that would jeopardise the more important negotiations with France.

Pressure continued to mount on the British negotiators for a peace deal, in part because budget discussions were underway in Parliament, and the prospect of continued war was another significant factor. The principal sticking point in the late negotiations was the status of Malta. Bonaparte eventually proposed that the British were to withdraw within three months of signing, with control passed back to a recreated Order of St. John, whose sovereignty was to be guaranteed by all of the major European powers. Left unspecified in that proposal was the means by which the Order would be re-established; it had essentially dissolved upon French seizure of the island in 1798. Furthermore, none of the other powers had been consulted on the matter.
On 14 March, London, under pressure to finalise the budget, gave Cornwallis a hard deadline. He was to return to London if he could not reach an agreement within eight days. Following a five-hour negotiating session that ended at 3 a.m. on 25 March, Cornwallis and Joseph signed the final agreement. Cornwallis was unhappy with the agreement, but he also worried about &quot;the ruinous consequences of ... renewing a bloody and hopeless war.&quot;

==Terms==

The treaty, beyond confirming &quot;peace, friendship, and good understanding&quot;, called for the following:
*The restoration of prisoners and hostages.
*Britain to return the Cape Colony to the Batavian Republic.
*Britain to return most of its captured Dutch Guiana to the Batavian Republic.
*Britain to withdraw its forces from Egypt.
*Spain agreeing to British rule of Trinidad
*The Batavian Republic to cede Ceylon, previously under control of the United Provinces and the Dutch East India Company, to Britain.
*France to withdraw its forces from the Papal States and the Kingdom of Naples.
*French Guiana to have its borders defined.
*Malta, Gozo and Comino to be restored to the Knights Hospitaller and to be declared neutral.
*Gibraltar to remain under British rule.
*Menorca be returned to Spain.
*The House of Orange-Nassau to be compensated for its losses in the Netherlands.
*The Septinsular Republic was recognised by the signatory parties.

Two days after signing the treaty, all four parties signed an addendum, specifically acknowledging that the failure to use the languages of all of the signatory powers (the treaty was published in English and French) was not prejudicial and should not be viewed as setting a precedent. It also stated that the omission of any individual&#x27;s titles was unintentional and not intended to be prejudicial. The Dutch and French representatives signed a separate convention, clarifying that the Batavian Republic was not to be financially responsible for the compensation paid to the House of Orange-Nassau.

Preliminaries were signed in London on 1 October 1801. King George III proclaimed the cessation of hostilities on 12 October.

==Amiens interlude==
Upper-class British visitors flocked to Paris in the second half of 1802. William Herschel took the opportunity to confer with his colleagues at the Observatoire. In booths and temporary arcades in the courtyard of the Louvre, the third French &quot;exposition des produits français&quot; took place on 18–24 September. According to the memoirs of his private secretary, Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne, Bonaparte &quot;was, above all, delighted with the admiration the exhibition excited among the numerous foreigners who resorted to Paris during the peace.&quot;

Among the visitors was Charles James Fox, who received a personal tour from minister Jean-Antoine Chaptal. Within the Louvre, in addition to the display of recent works in the Salon of 1802, visitors could see the display of Italian paintings and Roman sculptures collected from all over Italy under the stringent terms of the Treaty of Tolentino. J. M. W. Turner was able to fill a sketchbook from what he saw. Even the four Greek Horses of St Mark from Venice, which had been furtively removed in 1797, could now be viewed in an inner courtyard. William Hazlitt arrived at Paris on 16 October 1802. The Roman sculptures did not move him, but he spent most of three months studying and copying Italian masters in the Louvre.

The English were not the only ones to profit by the halcyon lull in hostilities. From London, the Russian Semyon Vorontsov noted to a correspondent, &quot;I hear that our gentlemen are making extravagant purchases in Paris. That fool Demidov has ordered a porcelain dinner service every plate of which costs 16 gold louis.&quot;

For those who could not get there, Helmina von Chézy collected her impressions in a series of vignettes contributed to the journal &quot;Französische Miscellen&quot;, and F. W. Blagdon and John Carr were among those who brought up to date curious English readers, who had felt starved for unbiased accounts of &quot;a people under the influence [ ] of a political change, hitherto unparalleled... During a separation of ten years, we have received very little account of this extraordinary people, which could be relied on,&quot; Carr noted in his Preface.

A number of French émigrés returned to France, under the terms of relaxed restrictions upon them. French visitors also came to England. Wax artist Marie Tussaud came to London and established an exhibition similar to one she had in Paris. The balloonist André-Jacques Garnerin staged displays in London and made a balloon flight from London to Colchester in 45 minutes.

The Spanish economy, which had been badly affected by the war, began to recover with the advent of peace. Much as it had been at the start of the wars in 1793, Spain remained diplomatically caught between Britain and France, but in the period just after the signing of the Treaty of Amiens, a number of actions on the part of the French government antagonised the Spanish. France&#x27;s unwillingness to block the cession of Trinidad to Britain was one of the things that most irritated King Charles IV. Spanish economic interests were further injured when Bonaparte sold Louisiana to the United States, whose merchants competed with those of Spain. Following that sale, Charles wrote that he was prepared to throw off alliance with France: &quot;neither break with France, nor break with England.&quot;

==Breakdown==

Britain ended the uneasy truce created by the Treaty of Amiens when it declared war on France in May 1803. The British were increasingly angered by Napoleon&#x27;s re-ordering of the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Frederick Kagan argues that Britain was irritated in particular by Napoleon&#x27;s assertion of control over Switzerland. Furthermore, Britons felt insulted when Napoleon stated that their country deserved no voice in European affairs, even though King George III was an elector of the Holy Roman Empire. For its part, Russia decided that the intervention in Switzerland indicated that Napoleon was not looking toward a peaceful resolution of his differences with the other European powers. Britain was labouring under a sense of loss of control, as well as loss of markets, and was worried by Napoleon&#x27;s possible threat to its overseas colonies. Frank McLynn argues that Britain went to war in 1803 out of a &quot;mixture of economic motives and national neuroses – an irrational anxiety about Napoleon&#x27;s motives and intentions.&quot; However, in the long run Napoleon&#x27;s intentions were hostile to British national interests. Furthermore, Napoleon was not ready for war, making it seem an optimal time for Britain to try to stop him. Britain therefore seized upon the Malta issue by refusing to follow the terms of the Treaty of Amiens that required its evacuation of the island.

Schroeder says that most historians agree that Napoleon&#x27;s &quot;determination to exclude Britain from the Continent now, and bring it to its knees in the future, made war...inevitable.&quot; The British government balked at implementing certain terms of the treaty, such as evacuating their naval presence from Malta. After the initial fervour, objections to the treaty quickly grew in Britain, where it seemed to the governing class that they were making all the concessions and ratifying recent developments. Prime Minister Addington did not undertake military demobilisation, but maintained a large peacetime army of 180,000.

Actions taken by Bonaparte after the treaty was signed heightened tensions with Britain and signatories to the other treaties. He used the time of peace to consolidate power and reorganise domestic administration in France and some of its client states. His effective annexation of the Cisalpine Republic and his decision to send French troops into the Helvetic Republic (Switzerland) in October 1802, was another violation of the Treaty of Lunéville. However, Britain had not signed that treaty, and the powers that had signed it tolerated Napoleon&#x27;s actions. Tsar Alexander had just congratulated Bonaparte for withdrawing from there and other places, but the Swiss move increased the belief in his cabinet that Bonaparte was not to be trusted. Bonaparte met British protests over the action with belligerent statements, again denying Britain&#x27;s right to be formally involved in matters on the continent and pointing out that Switzerland had been occupied by French troops when the treaty was signed. He also demanded for the British government to censor the strongly anti-French British press and to expel French expatriates from British soil. Those demands were perceived in London as affronts to British sovereignty.

Bonaparte also took advantage of the loosening of the British blockade of French ports to organise and dispatch a naval expedition to regain control over revolutionary Haiti and to occupy French Louisiana. Those moves, though not in violation of the treaty, were perceived by the British as a willingness by Bonaparte to threaten them on a global stage.

Britain refused to remove troops from Egypt or Malta, as agreed upon in the treaty. Bonaparte formally protested the continuing British occupations and, in January 1803, published a report by Horace Sebastiani that included observations on the ease with which France might capture Egypt, alarming most of the European powers. In an interview in February 1803 with Lord Whitworth, Britain&#x27;s French ambassador, Bonaparte threatened war if Malta was not evacuated and implied that he could have already retaken Egypt. The exchange left Whitworth feeling he was given an ultimatum. In a public meeting with a group of diplomats the following month, Bonaparte again pressed Whitworth, implying that the British wanted war since they were not upholding their treaty obligations. The Russian ambassador, Arkadiy Ivanovich Morkov, reported the encounter back to St. Petersburg in stark terms. The implicit and explicit threats contained in the exchange may have played a role in Russia&#x27;s eventual entry into the Third Coalition. Morkov also reported rumours that Bonaparte would seize Hamburg as well as Hanover if war was renewed. Although Alexander wanted to avoid war, that news apparently forced his hand; he began collecting troops on the Baltic coast in late March. The Russian foreign minister wrote of the situation, &quot;The intention already expressed by the First Consul of striking blows against England wherever he can, and under this pretext of sending his troops into Hanover [and] Northern Germany ... entirely transforms the nature of this war as it relates to our interests and obligations.&quot;

When France moved to occupy Switzerland, the British had issued orders for their military not to return Cape Colony to the Dutch, as stipulated in the Treaty of Amiens, only to countermand them when the Swiss failed to resist. In March 1803, the British ministry received notice that Cape Colony had been reoccupied by the military, and it promptly ordered military preparations to guard against possible French retaliation for the breach of the treaty. They falsely claimed that hostile French preparations had forced them into that action and that they were engaged in serious negotiations. To cover up their deception, the ministry issued a sudden ultimatum to France, demanding an evacuation of Holland and Switzerland and British control of Malta for ten years. The exchange prompted an exodus of foreigners from France, and Bonaparte quickly sold Louisiana to the United States to prevent its capture by Britain. Bonaparte made &quot;every concession that could be considered as demanded or even imposed by the British government&quot; by offering to guarantee the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, place Malta in the hands of a neutral third party and form a convention to satisfy Britain on other issues. His rejection of a British offer involving a ten-year lease of Malta prompted the reactivation of the British blockade of the French coast. Bonaparte, who was not fully prepared to resume the war, made moves designed to show renewed preparations for an invasion of Britain. Matters reached a diplomatic crisis point when the British rejected the idea of mediation by Tsar Alexander and, on 10 May, ordered Whitworth to withdraw from Paris if the French did not accede to their demands in 36 hours. Last-minute attempts at negotiation by Talleyrand failed, and Whitworth left France on 13 May. Britain declared war on France on 18 May, thus starting the Napoleonic Wars, which would rage in Europe for the following 12 years.

Britain gave its official reasons for resuming hostilities as France&#x27;s imperialist policies in the West Indies, Italy and Switzerland.

==War==
On 17 May 1803, before the official declaration of war and without any warning, the Royal Navy captured all the French and Dutch merchant ships stationed in Britain or sailing around, seizing more than two million pounds of commodities and taking their crews as prisoners. In response to that provocation, on 22 May (2 Prairial, year XI), the First Consul ordered the arrest of all British males between the ages of 18 and 60 in France and Italy, trapping many travelling civilians. The acts were denounced as illegal by all the major powers. Bonaparte claimed in the French press that the British prisoners that he had taken amounted to 10,000, but French documents compiled in Paris a few months later show that the numbers were 1,181. It was not until the abdication of Bonaparte in 1814 that the last of the imprisoned British civilians were allowed to return home.

Addington proved an ineffective prime minister in wartime and was replaced on 10 May 1804 with William Pitt, who formed the Third Coalition. Pitt was involved in failed assassination attempts on Bonaparte&#x27;s life by Cadoudal and Pichegru.

Napoleon, now Emperor of the French, assembled armies on the coast of France to invade Great Britain, but Austria and Russia, Britain&#x27;s allies, were preparing to invade France. The French armies were christened &quot;La Grande Armée&quot; and secretly left the coast to march against Austria and Russia before those armies could combine. The Grande Armée defeated Austria at Ulm the day before the Battle of Trafalgar, and Napoleon&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Austerlitz effectively destroyed the Third Coalition. In 1806, Britain retook the Cape Colony from the Batavian Republic. Napoleon abolished the republic later that year in favour of the Kingdom of Holland, ruled by his brother Louis Bonaparte. However, in 1810, the Netherlands officially became a part of France.

<doc id="91171" wikidata="Q504818" url="?curid=91171" title="Hitler Diaries">
<text>The Hitler Diaries () were a series of sixty volumes of journals purportedly written by Adolf Hitler, but forged by Konrad Kujau between 1981 and 1983. The diaries were purchased in 1983 for 9.3 million Deutsche Marks (£2.3 million or $3.7 million) by the West German news magazine &quot;Stern&quot;, which sold serialisation rights to several news organisations. One of the publications involved was &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, who asked their independent director, the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, to authenticate the diaries; he did so, pronouncing them genuine. At the press conference to announce the publication, Trevor-Roper announced that on reflection he had changed his mind, and other historians also raised questions concerning their validity. Rigorous forensic analysis, which had not been performed previously, quickly confirmed that the diaries were fakes.

Kujau, born and raised in East Germany, had a history of petty crime and deception. In the mid-1970s he began selling Nazi memorabilia which he had smuggled from the East, but found he could raise the prices by forging additional authentication details to associate ordinary souvenirs to the Nazi leaders. He began forging paintings by Hitler and an increasing number of notes, poems and letters, until he produced his first diary in the mid-to-late 1970s. The West German journalist with &quot;Stern&quot; who &quot;discovered&quot; the diaries and was involved in their purchase was Gerd Heidemann, who had an obsession with the Nazis. When &quot;Stern&quot; started buying the diaries, Heidemann stole a significant proportion of the money.

Kujau and Heidemann spent time in prison for their parts in the fraud, and several newspaper editors lost their jobs. The story of the scandal was the basis for the films &quot;Selling Hitler&quot; (1991) for the British channel ITV, the German film &quot;Schtonk!&quot; (1992), and the television series &quot;Faking Hitler&quot; (2021).

==Background==

===Operation Seraglio===

On 20 April 1945—Adolf Hitler&#x27;s 56th birthday—Soviet troops were on the verge of taking Berlin and the Western Allies had already taken several German cities. Hitler&#x27;s private secretary, Martin Bormann, initiated Operation Seraglio, a plan to evacuate the key and favoured members of Hitler&#x27;s entourage from the Berlin bunker where they were based, the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;, to an Alpine command centre near Berchtesgaden—Hitler&#x27;s retreat in southern Germany. Ten aeroplanes flew out from Gatow airfield under the overall command of General Hans Baur, Hitler&#x27;s personal pilot. The final flight out was a Junkers Ju 352 transport plane, piloted by Major Friedrich Gundlfinger—on board were ten heavy chests under the supervision of Hitler&#x27;s personal valet, Sergeant Wilhelm Arndt. The aeroplane crashed into the Heidenholz Forest, near the Czechoslovak border.

Some of the more useful parts of Gundlfinger&#x27;s aeroplane were appropriated by locals before the police and SS cordoned off the crash site. When Baur told Hitler what had happened, the German leader expressed grief at the loss of Arndt, one of his most favoured servants, and added: &quot;I entrusted him with extremely valuable documents which would show posterity the truth of my actions!&quot; Apart from this quoted sentence, there is no indication of what was in the boxes. The last of the crash&#x27;s two survivors died in April 1980, and Bormann had died after leaving the Berlin bunker following Hitler&#x27;s suicide on 30 April 1945. In the decades following the war, the possibility of a hidden cache of private papers belonging to Hitler became, according to the journalist Robert Harris, a &quot;tantalizing state of affairs [that] was to provide the perfect scenario for forgery&quot;.
===Konrad Kujau===
Konrad Kujau was born in 1938 in Löbau, near Dresden, in what would become East Germany. His parents, a shoemaker and his wife, had both joined the Nazi Party in 1933. The boy grew up believing in the Nazi ideals and idolising Hitler; Germany&#x27;s defeat and Hitler&#x27;s suicide in 1945 did not temper his enthusiasm for the Nazi cause. He held a series of menial jobs until 1957, when a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with the theft of a microphone from the Löbau Youth Club. He fled to Stuttgart, West Germany, and soon drifted into temporary work and petty crime. After running a dance bar during the early 1960s with his girlfriend, Edith Lieblang—whom he later married—Kujau began to create a fictional background for himself. He told people that his real name was Peter Fischer, changed his date of birth by two years, and altered the story of his time in East Germany. By 1963 the bar had begun to suffer financial difficulties, and Kujau started his career as a counterfeiter, forging 27 Deutsche Marks&#x27; (DM) worth of luncheon vouchers; he was caught and sentenced to five days in prison. On his release he and his wife formed the Lieblang Cleaning Company, although it provided little income for them. In March 1968, at a routine check at Kujau&#x27;s lodgings, the police established he was living under a false identity and he was sent to Stuttgart&#x27;s Stammheim Prison.
In 1970 Kujau visited his family in East Germany and discovered that many of the locals held Nazi memorabilia, contrary to the laws of the communist government. He saw an opportunity to buy the material cheaply on the black market, and make a profit in the West, where the increasing demand among Stuttgart collectors was raising memorabilia prices up to ten times the amount he would pay. The trade was illegal in East Germany, and the export of what were deemed items of cultural heritage was banned. Among the items smuggled out of East Germany were weapons.

In 1974 Kujau rented a shop into which he placed his Nazi memorabilia; the outlet also became the venue for late-night drinking sessions with friends and fellow collectors, including Wolfgang Schulze, who lived in the US and became Kujau&#x27;s agent there. Kujau inflated the value of items in his shop by forging additional authentication details—for example a genuine First World War helmet, worth a few marks, became considerably more valuable after Kujau forged a note indicating that Hitler had worn it at Ypres in late October 1914. In addition to notes by Hitler, he produced documents supposedly handwritten by Bormann, Rudolf Hess, Heinrich Himmler, Hermann Göring and Joseph Goebbels. He forged passable imitations of his subjects&#x27; genuine handwriting, but the rest of the work was crude: Kujau used modern stationery such as Letraset to create letterheads, and he tried to make his products look suitably old by pouring tea over them. Mistakes in spelling or grammar were relatively common, particularly when he forged in English; a supposed copy of the 1938 Munich Agreement between Hitler and Neville Chamberlain read, in part:

We regard the areement signet last night and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement as symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another againe.

In the mid-to-late 1970s Kujau, an able amateur artist, turned to producing paintings which he claimed were by Hitler, who had been an amateur artist as a young man. Having found a market for his forged works, Kujau created Hitler paintings depicting subjects his buyers expressed interest in, such as cartoons, nudes and men in action—all subjects that Hitler never painted, nor would want to paint, according to Charles Hamilton, a handwriting expert and author of books on forgery. These paintings were often accompanied by small notes, purportedly from Hitler. The paintings were profitable for Kujau. To explain his access to the memorabilia he invented several sources in East Germany, including a former Nazi general, the bribable director of a museum and his own brother, whom he re-invented as a general in the East German army.

Having found success in passing off his forged notes as those of Hitler, Kujau grew more ambitious and copied, by hand, the text from both volumes of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, even though the originals had been completed by typewriter. Kujau also produced an introduction to a third volume of the work. He sold these manuscripts to one of his regular customers, Fritz Stiefel, a collector of Nazi memorabilia who accepted them and many other Kujau products as genuine. Kujau also began forging a series of war poems by Hitler, which were so amateurish that Kujau later conceded that &quot;a fourteen-year-old collector would have recognised it as a forgery&quot;.

===Gerd Heidemann===
Gerd Heidemann was born in Hamburg in 1931. During the rise of Hitler his parents remained apolitical, but Heidemann, like many other young boys, joined the Hitler Youth. After the war he trained as an electrician, and pursued an interest in photography. He began working in a photographic laboratory and became a freelance photographer for the Deutsche Presse-Agentur and Keystone news agencies, as well as some local Hamburg newspapers. He had his first work published in &quot;Stern&quot; in 1951 and four years later joined the paper as a full-time member of staff. From 1961 he covered wars and hostilities across Africa and the Middle East; he became obsessed with these conflicts and other stories on which he worked, such as the search for the identity of the German writer B. Traven. Although he was an excellent researcher—his colleagues called him , the Bloodhound—he would not know when to stop investigating, which led to other writers having to finish the stories from large quantities of notes.

In January 1973, on behalf of &quot;Stern&quot;, Heidemann photographed the &quot;Carin II&quot;, a yacht that formerly belonged to Göring. The boat was in a poor state of repair and expensive to maintain, but Heidemann took a mortgage on his Hamburg flat and purchased it. While researching the history of the yacht, Heidemann interviewed Göring&#x27;s daughter, Edda, after which the couple began an affair. Through this relationship and his ownership of the boat he was introduced to a circle of former Nazis. He began to hold parties on the &quot;Carin II&quot;, with the former SS generals Karl Wolff and Wilhelm Mohnke as the guests of honour. Wolff and Mohnke were witnesses at Heidemann&#x27;s wedding to his third wife in 1979; the couple went on honeymoon to South America accompanied by Wolff, where they met more ex-Nazis, including Walter Rauff and Klaus Barbie, who were both wanted in the West for war crimes.

The purchase of the yacht caused Heidemann financial problems, and in 1976 he agreed terms with Gruner + Jahr, &quot;Stern&quot;″s parent company, to produce a book based on the conversations he was having with the former soldiers and SS men. When the book went unwritten—the material provided by the former SS officers was not sufficiently interesting or verifiable for publication—Heidemann borrowed increasingly large sums from his employers to pay for the boat&#x27;s upkeep. In June 1978 he advertised the boat for sale, asking 1.1 million DMs; he received no offers. Mohnke recommended that Heidemann speak to Jakob Tiefenthaeler, a Nazi memorabilia collector and a former member of the SS. Tiefenthaeler was not in a position to buy the yacht, but was happy to act as an agent; his endeavours did not produce a sale. Realising Heidemann&#x27;s financial circumstances, Tiefenthaeler provided him with names of other collectors in the Stuttgart area. The journalist made a trip to the south of Germany and met Stiefel, who purchased some of Göring&#x27;s effects.

===&quot;Stern&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;===

 (German for &quot;Star&quot;), a German weekly news magazine published in Hamburg, was formed by the journalist and businessman Henri Nannen in 1948 to offer scandal, gossip and human interest stories. It was, according to the German media experts Frank Esser and Uwe Hartung, known for its investigative journalism and was politically left-of-centre. In 1981 Nannen resigned from his position of editor of the magazine, and moved to take the role of &quot;publisher&quot;. In his place &quot;Stern&quot; had three editors: Peter Koch, Rolf Gillhausen and Felix Schmidt, who were aided by others including the journal&#x27;s head of contemporary history, Thomas Walde. Manfred Fischer was CEO of Gruner + Jahr until 1981 when he was promoted to the board of Bertelsmann, their parent company; he was replaced by Gerd Schulte-Hillen. Wilfried Sorge was one of the Gruner + Jahr managers responsible for international sales.

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; is a British national broadsheet newspaper, the Sunday sister paper of &quot;The Times&quot;. In 1968, under the ownership of Lord Thomson, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; had been involved in a deal to purchase the Mussolini diaries for an agreed final purchase price of £250,000, although they had only paid out an initial amount of £60,000. These turned out to be forgeries undertaken by an Italian mother and daughter, Amalia and Rosa Panvini. In 1981 Rupert Murdoch, who owned several other papers in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, purchased Times Newspapers Ltd, which owned both &quot;The Times&quot; and its Sunday sister. Murdoch appointed Frank Giles to be the editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. The historian Hugh Trevor-Roper became an independent national director of &quot;The Times&quot; in 1974. Trevor-Roper—who was created Baron Dacre of Glanton in 1979—was a specialist on Nazi Germany, who had worked for the British Intelligence Services during and after the Second World War. At the war&#x27;s end he had undertaken an official investigation of Hitler&#x27;s death, interviewing eyewitnesses to the Führer&#x27;s last movements. In addition to the official report he filed, Trevor-Roper also published &quot;The Last Days of Hitler&quot; (1947) on the subject. He subsequently wrote about the Nazis in &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War Directives&quot; (1964) and &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Place in History&quot; (1965).

&quot;Newsweek&quot;, an American weekly news magazine, was founded in 1933. In 1982 the journalist William Broyles was appointed editor-in-chief, while the editor was Maynard Parker; that year the company had circulation figures of three million readers.

==Production and sale of the diaries==

===Production===

It is unclear when Kujau produced his first Hitler diary. Stiefel says Kujau gave him a diary on loan in 1975. Schulze puts the date as 1976, while Kujau says he began in 1978, after a month&#x27;s practice writing in the old German gothic script Hitler had used. Kujau used one of a pile of notebooks he had bought cheaply in East Berlin, and attempted to put the letters &quot;AH&quot; in gold on the front—purchasing plastic, Hong Kong-made letters from a department store, he inadvertently used &quot;FH&quot; rather than &quot;AH&quot;. He took the black ribbon from a genuine SS document and attached it to the cover using a German army wax seal. For the ink, he bought two bottles of Pelikan ink—one black, one blue—and mixed them with water so it would flow more easily from the cheap modern pen he used. Finally he sprinkled tea over the pages and bashed the diaries against his desk to give them an aged look. Kujau showed the first volume to Stiefel, who was impressed and thought it a genuine Hitler diary; Stiefel wanted to buy it, but when the forger refused, the pair agreed that the collector could have it on loan.

In June 1979 Stiefel asked a former Nazi Party archivist, August Priesack, to verify the authenticity of the diary, which he subsequently did. Priesack showed the diary to Eberhard Jäckel of the University of Stuttgart, who also thought the diary to be genuine, and wanted to edit it for publication. News of the diary&#x27;s existence soon began to filter through to collectors of Hitler memorabilia. At the end of 1979 Tiefenthaeler contacted Heidemann to say that Stiefel had shown him around his collection, which included a Hitler diary—the only one Kujau had forged to that point. According to Hamilton &quot;the discovery inflamed Heidemann almost to madness&quot;, and he aggressively pressed for what would be a journalistic scoop.

Stiefel showed Heidemann the diary in Stuttgart in January 1980, telling him it was from a plane crash in East Germany, although he refused to tell the journalist the name of his source. The collector spoke to Kujau to see if he would meet Heidemann, but the forger repeatedly refused Heidemann&#x27;s requests for nearly a year. Heidemann returned to the &quot;Stern&quot; offices and spoke to his editor, but both Koch and Nannen refused to discuss the potential story with him, telling him to work on other features. The only person who was interested was Walde, who worked with Heidemann to find the source of the diaries. Their searches for Kujau proved fruitless, so they looked into the crash. Heidemann, who had read Baur&#x27;s autobiography, knew of Gundlfinger&#x27;s flight, and made a connection between Operation Seraglio and the diary; in November 1980 the two journalists travelled to Dresden and located the graves of the flight&#x27;s crew.

In January 1981 Tiefenthaeler gave Kujau&#x27;s telephone number to Heidemann, telling the journalist to ask for &quot;Mr Fischer&quot;, one of Kujau&#x27;s aliases. During the subsequent telephone call Kujau told Heidemann that there were 27 volumes of Hitler&#x27;s diaries, the original manuscript of the unpublished third volume of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, an opera by the young Hitler called (&quot;Wayland the Smith&quot;), numerous letters and unpublished papers, and several of Hitler&#x27;s paintings—most of which were still in East Germany. Heidemann offered two million DMs for the entire collection and guaranteed secrecy until everything had been brought over the border. Although the pair did not agree to a deal, they agreed to &quot;the foundations of a deal&quot;, according to Harris; Kujau&#x27;s condition was that he would only deal directly with Heidemann, something that suited the journalist as a way of keeping other members of &quot;Stern&quot; away from the story.

Heidemann and Walde produced a prospectus for internal discussion, outlining what was available for purchase and the costs. The document, signed by Heidemann, finished with a veiled threat: &quot;If our company thinks that the risk is too great, I suggest that I should seek out a publishing company in the United States which could put up the money and ensure that we get the German publication rights.&quot; The pair did not show the prospectus to anyone at &quot;Stern&quot;, but instead presented it to Gruner + Jahr&#x27;s deputy managing director, Jan Hensmann, and Manfred Fischer; they also requested a 200,000 mark deposit from the publisher to secure the rights with Kujau. After a meeting that lasted a little over two hours, and with no recourse to an expert or historian, the deposit was authorised. As soon as the meeting ended, at about 7 pm, Heidemann travelled to Stuttgart, with the deposit money, to meet Kujau.

===Acquisition===
At that first meeting on 28 January 1981, which lasted over seven hours, Heidemann offered Kujau a deposit of only 100,000 DMs to agree the deal, which Kujau did not accept. At a second meeting the following day, the reporter revealed an additional lure he had brought with him: a uniform which he said was Göring&#x27;s. Kujau tentatively agreed to provide the diaries and told Heidemann that he would call him as soon as he could arrange to receive them from East Germany. As a sign of good faith Heidemann lent the uniform to the forger, to show alongside his collection of other uniforms from the top Nazis; for his part, Kujau gave the journalist a painting purportedly by Hitler. Both the painting and uniform were fakes.
A week later Kujau met Jäckel and Alex Kuhn in connection with the poems he had forged and sold to Stiefel. These had been published by Jäckel and Kuhn in 1980, but one historian pointed out that one of the poems could not have been produced by Hitler as it had been written by the poet Herybert Menzel. Jäckel was concerned that the poem in question had been accompanied by a letter on Nazi party stationery guaranteeing it as a genuine work by Hitler. Many of the other pieces in Stiefel&#x27;s collection were similarly verified, so doubts began to surface over these, too. Kujau claimed ignorance, saying he was only the middleman, but told them that Heidemann, a reputed journalist, had seen the crash site from which the papers originated; Jäckel advised Stiefel to have his collection forensically examined, and passed 26 suspect poems to the Hamburg district attorney for investigation. Gruner + Jahr also knew about the problems with the poems, and that the source had been Kujau, but he assured them that this source had been elsewhere in East Germany, unconnected to the diaries, and they continued with their deal.

Ten days after the meeting with Jäckel and Kuhn, Kujau had prepared three further diaries. The contents were copied from a range of books, newspapers and magazines covering Hitler&#x27;s life. Primary among them was the two-volume work by the historian Max Domarus, (&quot;Hitler: Speeches and Proclamations, 1932–45&quot;), which presents Hitler&#x27;s day-to-day activities. Many of the diary&#x27;s entries were lists of Nazi party promotions and official engagements. Although Kujau created some personal information about Hitler in the diaries, this was, in the opinion of both Harris and Hamilton, trivia. He began working to a schedule of producing three diaries a month. He later stated that he managed to produce one of the volumes in three hours; on a separate occasion he wrote three diaries in three days.

On 17 February 1981 Kujau flew to Stuttgart and gave Heidemann the three recently prepared diaries, for which Heidemann gave him 35,000 DMs. This was a great deal less than the 120,000 DMs – 40,000 DMs per diary – promised to Kujau in the first meeting, from which Heidemann would also claim a 10% commission; the reduction in funds was explained by a need to get an &quot;expert opinion&quot; on the authenticity of the diaries, and the balance was later paid. The following day the reporter delivered the diaries to Gruner + Jahr. In the subsequent meeting with Walde, Hensmann, Sorge and Fischer, Heidemann and Walde again insisted on secrecy about the project, to ensure their acquisition of all the diaries—it was agreed that not even the editors of &quot;Stern&quot; should be told of the discovery. More importantly, according to Harris, it was decided that they should not have the material examined by a forensic scientist or historian until every diary had been obtained. Fischer committed the company to the future purchases by immediately allocating one million DM to the project. The company also set up a dedicated unit to deal with the diaries in an annex to the main Gruner + Jahr offices. It was headed by Walde, and consisted of an assistant, two secretaries and Heidemann. On receipt of the diaries they were photocopied and transcribed from the gothic script into modern German. Heidemann also entered into a private contract with Gruner + Jahr, which was kept secret from the company&#x27;s legal and personnel departments. It contained a deal for him to publish books through the company at a generous royalty rate, and agreed that ten years after publication the original diaries would be given to Heidemann for research purposes, to be handed on to the West German government on his death. He was also to be given a bonus of 300,000 DMs for recovering the first eight diaries.

The delivery of the diaries continued, although there were tensions between Heidemann and Kujau, partly owing to the journalist&#x27;s &quot;domineering personality and duplicity&quot;. Because of the nature of the transactions there were no receipts provided by Heidemann to Gruner + Jahr, and the business was conducted by the company on the basis of trust. By the end of February 1981, 680,000 DMs had been paid for the diaries, only around half of which was received by Kujau. Heidemann had pocketed the rest, defrauding both his employer and the forger in the process.

Despite the self-imposed restrictions of secrecy placed on the small circle inside Gruner + Jahr, Heidemann could not resist showing one of the volumes to Mohnke, as the entry referred to the SS &quot;Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler&quot;, Mohnke&#x27;s former regiment. Heidemann read out three entries from the diaries—from 15, 17 and 18 March—which concerned visits made by Hitler to the regiment while in the Lichterfelde and Friesenstraße barracks. Mohnke informed him that the entries were inaccurate, saying that the Lichterfelde barracks were not occupied by the troops on that date, that the regimental name used in the diary was introduced much later, and that so far as he knew Hitler never visited the Friesenstraße barracks. Heidemann was unmoved by his friend&#x27;s revelations, and posited that Hitler had probably written what he was planning to do, not what he had done. Harris suggests that this showed that the journalist &quot;had long ceased operating on a rational wavelength about the diaries&quot;.

The circle of those at Gruner + Jahr who knew about the diaries grew in May 1981 when Fischer decided to look into the complicated copyright circumstances surrounding Hitler&#x27;s property. He discussed the matter with the company&#x27;s legal advisor, Andreas Ruppert, who advised speaking to Werner Maser, a historian who acted as a trustee on such matters to the Hitler family. Heidemann visited Maser in June 1981 and came to a deal that enabled the journalist and &quot;Stern&quot;, for a payment of 20,000 DMs, to retain &quot;the rights to all the discovered or purchased documents or notes in the hand of Adolf Hitler ... which have so far not yet been published&quot;.

After twelve diaries had been delivered to Gruner + Jahr, Heidemann informed his employers that the price had risen from 85,000 DMs to 100,000 DMs per diary; the reason given by Heidemann was that the East German general smuggling the diaries was now having to bribe more people. The additional money was retained by Heidemann and not passed on to Kujau. The journalist was starting to lead a profligate lifestyle on his illicit profits, including two new cars (a BMW convertible and a Porsche, for a combined total of 58,000 DMs), renting two new flats on Hamburg&#x27;s exclusive Elbchaussee and jewellery. He also spent considerable sums acquiring new Nazi memorabilia. Some were genuine, such as Wolff&#x27;s SS honour dagger; others were purchased from Kujau, including 300 forged oil paintings, drawings and sketches Kujau claimed were by Hitler. Other items, carrying notes by Kujau attesting to their authenticity, included a gun described as that used by Hitler to commit suicide, and a flag identified as the (&quot;Blood Flag&quot;), carried in Hitler&#x27;s failed Munich Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, and stained by the blood of Nazis shot by police.

The purchases of the diaries continued throughout mid to late 1981: Gruner + Jahr gave Heidemann 345,000 DMs on 29 July, and a further 220,000 DMs a week later, which brought the total up to 1.81 million DMs since the start of the year. This sum had purchased 18 diaries for the company. Schulte-Hillen, the new managing director, signed an authorisation for a further million DMs for future purchases. Just over two weeks later he signed a further authorisation for 600,000 DMs after Heidemann told him that the cost of the diaries had now risen to 200,000 DMs each; Heidemann also passed on the news that there were more than 27 diaries.

In mid-December 1982 the author and future Holocaust denier David Irving was also involved in tracking the existence of diaries written by Hitler. Priesack had previously told Irving of the existence of one of the diaries with a collector in Stuttgart. In a visit to Priesack to assess his collection of Nazi documents, Irving found out Stiefel&#x27;s phone number, from which he worked out the address; he also obtained photocopies of some of the diary pages from Priesack. Irving visited Stiefel unannounced and tried to find out the name of the source, but the collector misled him as to the origin. Irving examined Priesack&#x27;s photocopies and saw a number of problems, including spelling mistakes and the change in writing style between certain words.

==Initial testing and verification; steps towards publication==
In April 1982 Walde and Heidemann contacted Josef Henke and Klaus Oldenhage of the (German Federal Archives) and Max Frei-Sulzer, the former head of the forensic department of the Zürich police, for assistance in authenticating the diaries. They did not specifically mention the diaries, but referred generally to new material. They also did not give the forensic specialists an entire diary, but removed one page only. For comparison purposes they also provided the experts with other samples of Hitler&#x27;s writing, a handwritten draft for a telegram: this was from Heidemann&#x27;s own collection and had also been forged by Kujau. Within days Walde provided further documents for comparison—all Kujau forgeries. Walde then flew to the US and commissioned Ordway Hilton, another forensic expert. None of those involved were experts in examining Nazi documents, and Hilton could not read German. &quot;Stern&quot;″s management were too bound up in a secretive approach to be open about their source, or to provide the experts with a complete diary, which would have led to a more thorough examination of wider material. From the samples provided, the experts concluded that the handwriting was genuine. Hilton subsequently reported that &quot;there was just no question&quot; that both documents he had were written by the same person, whom he assumed to be Hitler.

The purchase of the diaries continued, and by June 1982 Gruner + Jahr possessed 35 volumes. In early 1983 the company took the decision to work towards a publication date for the diaries. To ensure wide readership and to maximise their returns, &quot;Stern&quot; issued a prospectus to potentially interested parties, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Paris Match&quot; and a syndicate of papers owned by Murdoch. &quot;Stern&quot; rented a large vault in a Swiss bank. They filled the space with Nazi memorabilia and displayed various letters and manuscripts.

The first historian to examine the diaries was Hugh Trevor-Roper, who was cautious, but impressed with the volume of documentation in front of him. As the background to the acquisition was explained to him he became less doubtful; he was falsely informed that the paper had been chemically tested and been shown to be pre-war, and he was told that &quot;Stern&quot; knew the identity of the officer who had rescued the documents from the plane and had stored them ever since. By the end of the meeting he was convinced that the diaries were genuine, and later said &quot;who, I asked myself, would forge sixty volumes when six would have served his purpose?&quot; In an article in &quot;The Times&quot; on 23 April 1983 he wrote:

I am now satisfied that the documents are authentic; that the history of their wanderings since 1945 is true; and that the standard accounts of Hitler&#x27;s writing habits, of his personality, and even, perhaps, of some public events may, in consequence, have to be revised.

The day after Trevor-Roper gave his opinion of authenticity, Rupert Murdoch and his negotiation team arrived in Zürich. A deal was provisionally agreed for $2.5 million for the US serialisation rights, with an additional $750,000 for British and Commonwealth rights. While the discussions between Murdoch and Sorge were taking place, the diaries were examined by Broyle and his &quot;Newsweek&quot; team. After lengthy negotiation Broyle was informed that the minimum price &quot;Stern&quot; would consider was $3 million; the Americans returned home, informing Hensmann that they would contact him by phone in two days. When Broyle contacted the Germans he offered the amount, subject to authentication by their chosen expert, Gerhard Weinberg. In 1952 Weinberg, a cautious and careful historian, had written the &quot;Guide to Captured German Documents&quot;, for use by the US military; the work is described by Hamilton as definitive in its scope of the subject. Weinberg travelled to Zürich and, like Trevor-Roper, was impressed and reassured by the range of items on show; he was also partly persuaded by Trevor-Roper&#x27;s endorsement of the diaries&#x27; authenticity. Weinberg commented that &quot;the notion of anyone forging hundreds, even thousands of pages of handwriting was hard to credit&quot;. He had some reservations over the material and said he &quot;would feel more comfortable if a German expert on the Third Reich who has already made his reputation had been brought in to look at the material&quot;. He also stated that &quot;There is still room—however unlikely—for suspecting that the whole thing is a hoax. An obvious motive would be money. Another would be an attempt to rehabilitate Hitler&quot;.

&quot;Newsweek&quot; verbally accepted Hensmann&#x27;s offer and he in turn informed Murdoch, giving him the option to raise his bid. Murdoch was furious, having considered the handshake agreement in Zürich final. On 15 April 1983 Murdoch, with Mark Edmiston, the president of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, met Schulte-Hillen, who, unexpectedly and without explanation, went back on all the previous verbal—and therefore, to his mind, non-binding—agreements and told them the price was now $4.25 million. Murdoch and Edmiston refused to accede to the new price and both left. The managers of &quot;Stern&quot;, with no publishing partners, backtracked on their statements and came to a second deal with Murdoch, who drove the price down, paying $800,000 for the US rights, and $400,000 for the British and Australian rights. Further deals were done in France with &quot;Paris Match&quot; for $400,000; in Spain with &quot;Grupo Zeta&quot; for $150,000; in the Netherlands for $125,000; in Norway for $50,000; and in Italy with &quot;Panorama&quot; for $50,000. &quot;Newsweek&quot; did not enter into a deal and instead based their subsequent stories on the copies of the diaries they had seen during the negotiation period.

==Released to the news media; the &quot;Stern&quot; press conference==
On 22 April 1983 a press release from &quot;Stern&quot; announced the existence of the diaries and their forthcoming publication; a press conference was announced for 25 April. On hearing the news from &quot;Stern&quot;, Jäckel stated that he was &quot;extremely sceptical&quot; about the diaries, while his fellow historian, Karl Dietrich Bracher of the University of Bonn also thought their legitimacy unlikely. Irving was receiving calls from international news companies—the BBC, &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Bild Zeitung&quot;—and he was informing them all that the diaries were fakes. The former German Chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, also said that he could not believe the diaries were genuine. The following day &quot;The Times&quot; published the news that their Sunday sister paper had the serialisation rights for the UK; the edition also carried an extensive piece by Trevor-Roper with his opinion on the authenticity and importance of the discovery. By this stage the historian had growing doubts over the diaries, which he passed on to the editor of &quot;The Times&quot;, Charles Douglas-Home. The &quot;Times&quot; editor presumed that Trevor-Roper would also contact Giles at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, while Trevor-Roper thought that Douglas-Home would do so; neither did. The Sunday paper thus remained oblivious to the growing concerns that the diaries might not be genuine.

On the evening of 23 April the presses began rolling for the following day&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. After an evening meeting of the editorial staff, Giles phoned Trevor-Roper to ask him to write a piece rebutting the criticism of the diaries. He found that the historian had made &quot;a 180-degree turn&quot; regarding the diaries&#x27; authenticity, and was now far from sure that they were real. The paper&#x27;s deputy editor, Brian MacArthur, rang Murdoch to see if they should stop the print run and re-write the affected pages. Murdoch&#x27;s reply was &quot;Fuck Dacre. Publish.&quot;

On the afternoon of the 24 April, in Hamburg for the press conference the following day, Trevor-Roper asked Heidemann for the name of his source: the journalist refused, and gave a different story of how the diaries had been acquired. Trevor-Roper was suspicious and questioned the reporter closely for over an hour. Heidemann accused the historian of acting &quot;exactly like an officer of the British army&quot; in 1945. At a subsequent dinner the historian was evasive when asked by &quot;Stern&quot; executives what he was going to say at the announcement the following day.

At the press conference both Trevor-Roper and Weinberg expressed their doubts at the authenticity, and stated that German experts needed to examine the diaries to confirm whether the works were genuine. Trevor-Roper went on to say that his doubts sprung from the lack of proof that these books were the same ones as had been on the crashed plane in 1945. He finished his statement by saying that &quot;I regret that the normal method of historical verification has been sacrificed to the perhaps necessary requirements of a journalistic scoop.&quot; The leading article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; described his public reversal as showing &quot;moral courage&quot;. Irving, who had been described in the introductory statement by Koch as a historian &quot;with no reputation to lose&quot;, stood at the microphone for questions, and asked how Hitler could have written his diary in the days following the 20 July plot, when his arm had been damaged. He denounced the diaries as forgeries, and held aloft the photocopied pages he had been given from Priesack. He asked if the ink in the diaries had been tested, but there was no response from the managers of &quot;Stern&quot;. Photographers and film crews jostled to get a better picture of Irving, and some punches were thrown by journalists while security guards moved in and forcibly removed Irving from the room, while he shouted &quot;Ink! Ink!&quot;

==Forensic analysis and the uncovering of the frauds==

With grave doubts now expressed about the authenticity of the diaries, &quot;Stern&quot; faced the possibility of legal action for disseminating Nazi propaganda. To ensure a definitive judgment on the diaries, Hagen, one of the company&#x27;s lawyers, passed three complete diaries to Henke at the for a more complete forensic examination. While the debate on the diaries&#x27; authenticity continued, &quot;Stern&quot; published its special edition on 28 April, which provided Hitler&#x27;s purported views on the flight of Hess to Scotland, and the Holocaust. The following day Heidemann again met with Kujau, and bought the last four diaries from him.

On the following Sunday, 1 May 1983, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; published further stories providing the background to the diaries, linking them more closely to the plane crash in 1945, and providing a profile of Heidemann. That day, when &quot;The Daily Express&quot; rang Irving for a further comment on the diaries, he informed them that he now believed the diaries to be genuine; &quot;The Times&quot; ran the story of Irving&#x27;s U-turn the following day. Irving explained that &quot;Stern&quot; had shown him a diary from April 1945 in which the writing sloped downwards from left to right, and the script of which got smaller along the line. At a subsequent press conference Irving explained that he had been examining the diaries of Dr Theodor Morell, Hitler&#x27;s personal doctor, in which Morell diagnosed the as having Parkinson&#x27;s disease, a symptom of which was to write in the way the text appeared in the diaries. Harris posits that further motives may also have played a part—the lack of reference to the Holocaust in the diaries may have been perceived by Irving as supporting evidence for his thesis, put forward in his book &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot;, that the Holocaust took place without Hitler&#x27;s knowledge.

The same day Hagen visited the and was told of their findings: ultraviolet light had shown a fluorescent element to the paper, which should not have been present in an old document, and that the bindings of one of the diaries included polyester which had not been made before 1953. Research in the archives also showed a number of errors. The findings were partial only, and not conclusive; more volumes were provided to aid the analysis.

When Hagen reported back to the &quot;Stern&quot; management, an emergency meeting was called and Schulte-Hillen demanded the identity of Heidemann&#x27;s source. The journalist relented, and provided the provenance of the diaries as Kujau had given it to him. Harris describes how a bunker mentality descended on the &quot;Stern&quot; management as, instead of accepting the truth of the &#x27;s findings, they searched for alternative explanations as to how post-war whitening agents could have been used in the wartime paper. The paper then released a statement defending their position which Harris judges was &quot;resonant with hollow bravado&quot;.

While Koch was touring the US, giving interviews to most of the major news channels, he met Kenneth W. Rendell, a handwriting expert in the studios of CBS, and showed him one of the volumes. Rendell&#x27;s first impression was that the diaries were forged. He later reported that &quot;everything looked wrong&quot;, including new-looking ink, poor quality paper and signatures that were &quot;terrible renditions&quot; of Hitler&#x27;s. Rendell concludes the diaries were not particularly good fakes, calling them &quot;bad forgeries but a great hoax&quot;. He states that &quot;with the exception of imitating Hitler&#x27;s habit of slanting his writing diagonally as he wrote across the page, the forger failed to observe or to imitate the most fundamental characteristics of his handwriting.&quot;

On 4 May fifteen volumes of the diaries were removed from the Swiss bank vault and distributed to various forensic scientists: four went to the and eleven went to the Swiss specialists in St Gallen. The initial results were ready on 6 May, which confirmed what the forensic experts had been telling the management of &quot;Stern&quot; for the last week: the diaries were poor forgeries, with modern components and ink that was not in common use in wartime Germany. Measurements had been taken of the evaporation of chloride in the ink which showed the diaries had been written within the previous two years. There were also factual errors, including some from Domarus&#x27;s that Kujau had copied. Before passing the news to Stern, the had already informed the government, saying it was &quot;a ministerial matter&quot;. The managers at &quot;Stern&quot; tried to release the first press statement that acknowledged the forensic findings and stated that the diaries were forged, but the official government announcement was released five minutes before &quot;Stern&quot;&#x27;s.

==Arrests and trial==
Once the government announcement appeared on television, Kujau took his wife and mistress to Austria; he introduced the latter to Edith as his cleaner. After he saw a news report a few days later, naming him as the forger, and also hearing that &quot;Stern&quot; had paid nine million DMs, he first phoned his lawyer and then the Hamburg State prosecutor, before agreeing to hand himself in at the border between Austria and West Germany the following day. When police raided his house, they found several notebooks identical to those used in the fraud. Kujau continued to use a variation of the story he had told Heidemann—that of obtaining the diaries from the East—but he was bitter that the journalist was still at liberty, and had withheld so much of &quot;Stern&quot;″s money from him. After thirteen days, on 26 May, he wrote a full confession, stating that Heidemann knew all along that the diaries were forgeries. Heidemann was arrested that evening.

Following a police investigation that lasted over a year, on 21 August 1984 the trial against Heidemann and Kujau opened in Hamburg. Both men were charged with defrauding &quot;Stern&quot; of 9.3 million DMs. Despite the seriousness of the charges facing the two men, Hamilton considers that &quot;it also appeared clear that the trial was going to be a farce, a real slapstick affair that would enrage the judge and amuse the entire world.&quot; The proceedings lasted until July 1985, when both men were sent to prison: four years and eight months for Heidemann, four years and six months for Kujau. In September one of the supporting magistrates overseeing the case was replaced after he fell asleep; three days later the court were &quot;amused&quot; to see pictures of Idi Amin&#x27;s underpants, which Heidemann had framed on his wall. At times the case &quot;denigrated into a slanging match&quot; between Kujau and Heidemann. In his summing up Judge Hans-Ulrich Schroeder said that &quot;the negligence of &quot;Stern&quot; has persuaded me to soften the sentences against the two main co-conspirators.&quot; Heidemann was found guilty of stealing 1.7 million DMs from &quot;Stern&quot;, and Kujau was found guilty of receiving 1.5 million DMs for his role in the forgeries. Despite the lengthy investigation and trial, at least five million DMs remained unaccounted for.

==Aftermath==

When Kujau was released from prison in 1987 he was suffering from throat cancer. He opened a gallery in Stuttgart and sold &quot;forgeries&quot; of Salvador Dalí and Joan Miró, all signed with his own name. Although he prospered, Kujau was later arrested for forging driving licences; he was fined the equivalent of £2,000. He died of cancer in Stuttgart in September 2000.

Heidemann was also released from prison in 1987. Five years later it was reported in the German newspaper &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; that in the 1950s he had been recruited by the Stasi, the East German secret police, to monitor the arrival of American nuclear weapons into West Germany. In 2008 he had debts exceeding €700,000, and was living on social security; his situation had not changed by 2013, and he remained bitter about his treatment.

Two of &quot;Stern&quot;″s editors, Koch and Schmidt, lost their jobs because of the scandal. Both complained strongly when told that their resignations were expected, pointing out that they had both wanted to sack Heidemann in 1981. A settlement of 3.5 million DMs (c. $1 million) was provided to each of them as part of the severance package. The staff at the magazine were angry at the approach taken by their managers, and held sit-ins to protest at the &quot;management&#x27;s bypassing traditional editorial channels and safeguards&quot;. The scandal caused a major crisis for &quot;Stern&quot; and, according to Esser and Hartung, the magazine &quot;once known for its investigative reporting, became a prime example of sensation-seeking checkbook journalism&quot;. &quot;Stern&quot;″s credibility was severely damaged and it took the magazine ten years to regain its pre-scandal status and reputation. According to the German Historical Institute, the scandal was also &quot;instrumental in discrediting the tendency toward an &#x27;unprejudiced&#x27; and euphemistic assessment of the Third Reich in West German popular culture&quot;.

At &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Murdoch moved Giles to the new position of &quot;editor emeritus&quot;. When Giles asked what the title meant, Murdoch informed him that &quot;It&#x27;s Latin, Frank; the &quot;e&quot; means you&#x27;re out and the &quot;meritus&quot; means you deserved it.&quot; Murdoch later said that &quot;circulation went up and it stayed up. We didn&#x27;t lose money or anything like that&quot;, referring to the 20,000 new readers the paper retained after the scandal broke, and the fact that &quot;Stern&quot; returned all the money paid to it by the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;. In April 2012, during the Leveson Inquiry, he acknowledged his role in publishing the diaries, and took the blame for making the decision, saying &quot;It was a massive mistake I made and I will have to live with it for the rest of my life.&quot; Trevor-Roper died in 2003. Despite a long and respected career as a historian, according to Richard Davenport-Hines, his biographer, Trevor-Roper&#x27;s role in the scandal left his reputation &quot;permanently besmirched&quot;. In January 1984 Broyles resigned as editor of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, to &quot;pursue new entrepreneurial ventures&quot;.

In 1986 the journalist Robert Harris published an account of the hoax, &quot;Selling Hitler: The Story of the Hitler Diaries&quot;. Five years later &quot;Selling Hitler&quot;, a five-episode drama-documentary series based on Harris&#x27;s book, was broadcast on the British ITV channel. It starred Jonathan Pryce as Heidemann, Alexei Sayle as Kujau, Tom Baker as Fischer, Alan Bennett as Trevor-Roper, Roger Lloyd-Pack as Irving, Richard Wilson as Nannen and Barry Humphries as Murdoch. Later that year Charles Hamilton published the second book to investigate the forgeries: &quot;The Hitler Diaries&quot;. In 1992 the story of the diaries was adapted to the big screen by Helmut Dietl, in his satirical German-language film &quot;Schtonk!&quot; The film, which starred Götz George as Heidemann and Uwe Ochsenknecht as Kujau, won three Deutscher Filmpreis awards, and nominations for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award.

In 2004 one of the diaries was sold at auction for €6,400 to an unknown buyer. &quot;Stern&quot; announced in 2013 that they would hand over the remainder to the but the transfer never took place. One of the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; journalists involved in the story, Brian MacArthur, later explained why so many experienced journalists and businessmen &quot;were so gullible&quot; about the authenticity of the diaries:

...  the discovery of the Hitler diaries offered so tempting a scoop that we all wanted to believe they were genuine. Once hoist with a deal, moreover, we had to go on believing in their authenticity until they were convincingly demonstrated as forgeries. ... The few of us who were in on the secret fed in the adrenalin: we were going to write the most stunning scoop of our careers.

In March 2023 all 62 volumes of the forged diaries were published in hard copy by the German publisher März Verlag and for free viewing on the website of Norddeutscher Rundfunk. In April the publishing house Bertelsmann, which owns the diaries, said it would give them to the German state for preservation. The Leibniz Institute for Contemporary History has been tasked with investigating the diaries&#x27; reception and why they were taken so seriously. As part of the investigation, it will examine Nannen, who died in 1996 and is now known to have had more involvement in Nazism than previously thought. The diaries will be put on public display at the German Federal Archives.

<doc id="91173" wikidata="Q179745" url="?curid=91173" title="Axial tilt">
<text>In astronomy, axial tilt, also known as obliquity, is the angle between an object&#x27;s rotational axis and its orbital axis, which is the line perpendicular to its orbital plane; equivalently, it is the angle between its equatorial plane and orbital plane. It differs from orbital inclination. 
At an obliquity of 0 degrees, the two axes point in the same direction; that is, the rotational axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane. 

The rotational axis of Earth, for example, is the imaginary line that passes through both the North Pole and South Pole, whereas the Earth&#x27;s orbital axis is the line perpendicular to the imaginary plane through which the Earth moves as it revolves around the Sun; the Earth&#x27;s obliquity or axial tilt is the angle between these two lines. 
Over the course of an orbital period, the obliquity usually does not change considerably, and the orientation of the axis remains the same relative to the background of stars. This causes one pole to be pointed more toward the Sun on one side of the orbit, and more away from the Sun on the other side—the cause of the seasons on Earth.

== Standards ==
There are two standard methods of specifying a planet&#x27;s tilt. One way is based on the planet&#x27;s &quot;north pole&quot;, defined in relation to the direction of Earth&#x27;s north pole, and the other way is based on the planet&#x27;s &quot;positive pole&quot;, defined by the right-hand rule:

* The International Astronomical Union (IAU) defines the &quot;north pole&quot; of a planet as that which lies on Earth&#x27;s north side of the invariable plane of the Solar System; under this system, Venus is tilted 3° and rotates retrograde, opposite that of most of the other planets.
* The IAU also uses the right-hand rule to define a &quot;positive pole&quot; for the purpose of determining orientation. Using this convention, Venus is tilted 177° (&quot;upside down&quot;) and rotates prograde.

== Earth ==

Earth&#x27;s orbital plane is known as the ecliptic plane, and Earth&#x27;s tilt is known to astronomers as the &quot;obliquity of the ecliptic&quot;, being the angle between the ecliptic and the celestial equator on the celestial sphere. It is denoted by the Greek letter Epsilon &quot;ε&quot;.

Earth currently has an axial tilt of about 23.44°. This value remains about the same relative to a stationary orbital plane throughout the cycles of axial precession. But the ecliptic (i.e., Earth&#x27;s orbit) moves due to planetary perturbations, and the obliquity of the ecliptic is not a fixed quantity. At present, it is decreasing at a rate of about 46.8″ per century &quot;(see details in Short term below)&quot;.

=== History ===
The ancient Greeks had good measurements of the obliquity since about 350 BCE, when Pytheas of Marseilles measured the shadow of a gnomon at the summer solstice. About 830 CE, the Caliph Al-Mamun of Baghdad directed his astronomers to measure the obliquity, and the result was used in the Arab world for many years. In 1437, Ulugh Beg determined the Earth&#x27;s axial tilt as 23°30′17″ (23.5047°).

During the Middle Ages, it was widely believed that both precession and Earth&#x27;s obliquity oscillated around a mean value, with a period of 672 years, an idea known as &quot;trepidation&quot; of the equinoxes. Perhaps the first to realize this was incorrect (during historic time) was Ibn al-Shatir in the fourteenth century and the first to realize that the obliquity is decreasing at a relatively constant rate was Fracastoro in 1538. The first accurate, modern, western observations of the obliquity were probably those of Tycho Brahe from Denmark, about 1584, although observations by several others, including al-Ma&#x27;mun, al-Tusi, Purbach, Regiomontanus, and Walther, could have provided similar information.

=== Seasons ===
Earth&#x27;s axis remains tilted in the same direction with reference to the background stars throughout a year (regardless of where it is in its orbit) – this is known as axial parallelism. This means that one pole (and the associated hemisphere of Earth) will be directed away from the Sun at one side of the orbit, and half an orbit later (half a year later) this pole will be directed towards the Sun. This is the cause of Earth&#x27;s seasons. Summer occurs in the Northern hemisphere when the north pole is directed toward and the south pole away from the Sun. Variations in Earth&#x27;s axial tilt can influence the seasons and is likely a factor in long-term climatic change &quot;(also see Milankovitch cycles)&quot;.

=== Oscillation ===

==== Short term ====
The exact angular value of the obliquity is found by observation of the motions of Earth and planets over many years. Astronomers produce new fundamental ephemerides as the accuracy of observation improves and as the understanding of the dynamics increases, and from these ephemerides various astronomical values, including the obliquity, are derived.

Annual almanacs are published listing the derived values and methods of use. Until 1983, the Astronomical Almanac&#x27;s angular value of the mean obliquity for any date was calculated based on the work of Newcomb, who analyzed positions of the planets until about 1895:

where is the obliquity and is tropical centuries from B1900.0 to the date in question.

From 1984, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory&#x27;s DE series of computer-generated ephemerides took over as the fundamental ephemeris of the Astronomical Almanac. Obliquity based on DE200, which analyzed observations from 1911 to 1979, was calculated:

where hereafter is Julian centuries from J2000.0.

JPL&#x27;s fundamental ephemerides have been continually updated. For instance, according to IAU resolution in 2006 in favor of the P03 astronomical model, the &quot;Astronomical Almanac&quot; for 2010 specifies:

These expressions for the obliquity are intended for high precision over a relatively short time span, perhaps several centuries. Jacques Laskar computed an expression to order good to 0.02″ over 1000 years and several arcseconds over 10,000 years.

where here is multiples of 10,000 Julian years from J2000.0.

These expressions are for the so-called &quot;mean&quot; obliquity, that is, the obliquity free from short-term variations. Periodic motions of the Moon and of Earth in its orbit cause much smaller (9.2 arcseconds) short-period (about 18.6 years) oscillations of the rotation axis of Earth, known as nutation, which add a periodic component to Earth&#x27;s obliquity. The &quot;true&quot; or instantaneous obliquity includes this nutation.

==== Long term ====

Using numerical methods to simulate Solar System behavior over a period of several million years, long-term changes in Earth&#x27;s orbit, and hence its obliquity, have been investigated. For the past 5 million years, Earth&#x27;s obliquity has varied between and , with a mean period of 41,040 years. This cycle is a combination of precession and the largest term in the motion of the ecliptic. For the next 1 million years, the cycle will carry the obliquity between and .

The Moon has a stabilizing effect on Earth&#x27;s obliquity. Frequency map analysis conducted in 1993 suggested that, in the absence of the Moon, the obliquity could change rapidly due to orbital resonances and chaotic behavior of the Solar System, reaching as high as 90° in as little as a few million years (&quot;also see Orbit of the Moon&quot;). However, more recent numerical simulations made in 2011 indicated that even in the absence of the Moon, Earth&#x27;s obliquity might not be quite so unstable; varying only by about 20–25°. To resolve this contradiction, diffusion rate of obliquity has been calculated, and it was found that it takes more than billions of years for Earth&#x27;s obliquity to reach near 90°. The Moon&#x27;s stabilizing effect will continue for less than two billion years. As the Moon continues to recede from Earth due to tidal acceleration, resonances may occur which will cause large oscillations of the obliquity.

== Solar System bodies ==

All four of the innermost, rocky planets of the Solar System may have had large variations of their obliquity in the past. Since obliquity is the angle between the axis of rotation and the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane, it changes as the orbital plane changes due to the influence of other planets. But the axis of rotation can also move (axial precession), due to torque exerted by the Sun on a planet&#x27;s equatorial bulge. Like Earth, all of the rocky planets show axial precession. If the precession rate were very fast the obliquity would actually remain fairly constant even as the orbital plane changes. The rate varies due to tidal dissipation and core-mantle interaction, among other things. When a planet&#x27;s precession rate approaches certain values, orbital resonances may cause large changes in obliquity. The amplitude of the contribution having one of the resonant rates is divided by the difference between the resonant rate and the precession rate, so it becomes large when the two are similar.

Mercury and Venus have most likely been stabilized by the tidal dissipation of the Sun. Earth was stabilized by the Moon, as mentioned above, but before its formation, Earth, too, could have passed through times of instability. Mars&#x27;s obliquity is quite variable over millions of years and may be in a chaotic state; it varies as much as 0° to 60° over some millions of years, depending on perturbations of the planets. Some authors dispute that Mars&#x27;s obliquity is chaotic, and show that tidal dissipation and viscous core-mantle coupling are adequate for it to have reached a fully damped state, similar to Mercury and Venus.

The occasional shifts in the axial tilt of Mars have been suggested as an explanation for the appearance and disappearance of rivers and lakes over the course of the existence of Mars. A shift could cause a burst of methane into the atmosphere, causing warming, but then the methane would be destroyed and the climate would become arid again.

The obliquities of the outer planets are considered relatively stable.

== Extrasolar planets ==
The stellar obliquity , i.e. the axial tilt of a star with respect to the orbital plane of one of its planets, has been determined for only a few systems. By 2012, 49 stars have had sky-projected spin-orbit misalignment has been observed, which serves as a lower limit to . Most of these measurements rely on the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect. Since the launch of space-based telescopes such as Kepler space telescope, it has been made possible to determine and estimate the obliquity of an extrasolar planet. The rotational flattening of the planet and the entourage of moons and/or rings, which are traceable with high-precision photometry provide access to planetary obliquity, . Many extrasolar planets have since had their obliquity determined, such as Kepler-186f and Kepler-413b.

Astrophysicists have applied tidal theories to predict the obliquity of extrasolar planets. It has been shown that the obliquities of exoplanets in the habitable zone around low-mass stars tend to be eroded in less than 109 years, which means that they would not have tilt-induced seasons as Earth has.

<text>Swans are an American experimental rock band formed in 1981 by singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Michael Gira. One of the few acts to emerge from the New York City-based no wave scene and stay intact into the next decade, Swans have become recognized for an ever-changing sound, exploring genres such as noise rock, post-punk, industrial and post-rock. Initially, their music was known for its sonic brutality and misanthropic lyrics. Following the addition of singer, songwriter and keyboardist Jarboe in 1986, Swans began to incorporate melody and intricacy into their music. Jarboe remained the band&#x27;s only constant member except Gira and semi-constant guitarist Norman Westberg until their dissolution in 1997.

In 2010, Gira re-formed the band without Jarboe, establishing a stable lineup of musicians which has toured worldwide and released four albums to critical acclaim. This iteration of the group performed its last shows in November 2017, ending the tour in support of its then most recent album &quot;The Glowing Man&quot;. Since 2019, Gira has been touring and recording with Swans as &quot;a revolving cast of contributors&quot;. The band&#x27;s latest album, &quot;Birthing&quot;, is set to release on May 30, 2025. Since 1990, all Swans records have been released through Gira&#x27;s own label, Young God Records.

== History ==
=== Early years (1982–1985) ===
==== Initial influences ====
Michael Gira has repeatedly stated he took the moniker Swans as it best described the sound he wanted. Gira&#x27;s summation of the name follows along the lines of: &quot;Swans are majestic, beautiful looking creatures. With really ugly temperaments.&quot;

The earliest known lineup of Swans comprised Gira on bass guitar and vocals, Jonathan Kane on drums, Sue Hanel on guitar, Mojo on percussion and tape loops and Thurston Moore, Dan Braun or Jonathan Tessler on the second bass guitar. Tessler also played metal percussion and tape loops in another variation of the line-up with Gira on bass, Moore on guitar, and Kane on drums. Hanel&#x27;s only recordings with the group are on the compilation &quot;Body to Body, Job to Job&quot;, but the ambiguous personnel credits do not make it clear on which songs she performed. Kane stated that &quot;Sue was the most fearsome guitarist we&#x27;d ever heard in New York. She was unbelievable.&quot;

Hanel did not stay long in the group, and by the time of their recording debut she had been replaced by Bob Pezzola. This lineup of the group also featured saxophonist Daniel Galli-Duani, who had previously played with Kane as the avant-garde duo Transmission. The debut EP, &quot;Swans&quot;, released on Labor, is markedly different from anything they would do later. However, the minimal chord structures owe more to blues, while the jazz instrumentation and awkward time signatures are evidence of Swans&#x27; roots in the no wave scene of the late 1970s, which had more or less collapsed by the release of 1984&#x27;s &quot;Cop&quot;.

==== Early style ====
Kane compares Swans to blues icon Chester Burnett, a.k.a. Howlin&#x27; Wolf. Some similarities worth noting—the music of early Swans was often based on a single riff, played repeatedly to hypnotic effect. Some of Burnett&#x27;s songs—especially the songs penned by Burnett himself—have a similar structure and quality. Their early music was typified by slow and grinding guitar noise, and pounding drums, punctuated by Gira&#x27;s morbid and violent lyrics (inspired by Jean Genet and Marquis de Sade), usually barked or shouted. Critics have described Swans&#x27; early recordings as &quot;aggressive beyond words&quot;.

Their first full-length release, &quot;Filth&quot; (1983), featured driving, choppy rhythms and abrasive drums. The whole is reminiscent of earlier no wave bands, such as Mars, and the work of Swans&#x27; contemporaries, like Sonic Youth&#x27;s &quot;Confusion Is Sex&quot; and &quot;Kill Yr Idols&quot;; but critic Ned Raggett contends that &quot;early Swans really is like little else on the planet before or since&quot;. &quot;Filth&quot; was the first album to feature guitarist Norman Westberg, who would play a vital role in much of Swans&#x27; music and would feature on every subsequent studio album apart from &quot;Love of Life&quot;.

&quot;Cop&quot; (1984) and the originally untitled &quot;Young God&quot; EP were both released in 1984 and re-released together on CD in 1992. &quot;Young God&quot; has been known by several names, usually by one of its two A-sides, such as &quot;I Crawled&quot; or, notoriously, as &quot;Raping a Slave&quot;. This release is often confused with their self-titled debut. The music continues in the same vein as &quot;Filth&quot;, and is again vaguely reminiscent of heavy metal music played in extreme slow motion. Swans were, in this era, Gira on vocals, Westberg on guitar, Harry Crosby on bass guitar and Roli Mosimann on drums. Gira&#x27;s vocals had changed slightly, becoming slowly more melodic, although the snarl still remained. Some of the songs on the EP, particularly &quot;Young God&quot; and &quot;I Crawled&quot;, have an actual vocal melody, if rudimentary, hinting at the sounds of future releases.

Godflesh frontman Justin Broadrick shared this impression of the group:

==== Live shows ====
One of the trademarks of Swans&#x27; early period was playing at painfully loud volumes during concerts, sometimes leading to police stopping shows. Gira was also notably confrontational with the audience, such as stepping on people&#x27;s fingers resting on the stage, pulling people&#x27;s hair and, notably, physically assaulting anyone caught in the crowd headbanging, something Gira detested. This lent a reputation to the name Swans which was one of the contributing factors in Gira&#x27;s retirement of the band in 1997.

Since Swans&#x27; re-formation, Gira has made a point of maintaining the intensity of their live show, stating that it is at once &quot;soul-uplifting and body-destroying&quot;. He has also sometimes turned off the air conditioning before Swans performed and compared the experience to a Native American sweat lodge.

=== Stylistic shift (1986–1988) ===
1986&#x27;s &quot;Greed&quot; was not as brutal or noisy as Swans&#x27; previous releases, while still being an extremely ominous and dark record. It also saw two new and significant musicians join the group. New bassist Algis Kizys would become a long-time, near-constant member, as would new vocalist/keyboardist Jarboe (who had joined the band a month before the release of the 1985 &quot;Time Is Money (Bastard)&quot; 12-inch, on which she had been credited simply with &quot;scream&quot;). 

&quot;Greed&quot; was followed by its &quot;twin&quot; album, &quot;Holy Money&quot;, the first to feature Jarboe contributing lead vocals (on &quot;You Need Me&quot;) Her presence began a slow thawing in the overt brutality and energy of Swans&#x27; early work, while &quot;Holy Money&quot; was also the first album by the group to incorporate acoustic elements: in particular, the eight-minute dirge &quot;Another You&quot;, which starts with a bluesy harmonica introduction. It also marks the introduction of religious themes in Swans records with the sacrificial ode &quot;A Hanging&quot;, complete with gospel-like backing vocals from Jarboe. (Jarboe would also sing lead on &quot;Blackmail&quot;, a B-side from the &quot;A Screw&quot; 12&quot;. Both tracks appeared on the original CD version of &quot;Holy Money&quot; and the &quot;Greed/Holy Money&quot; compilation, while a minimal version of the latter also appears on &quot;Children of God&quot;.) 

&quot;Children of God&quot; (1987) further expanded Jarboe&#x27;s role, acting as a foil to Michael Gira&#x27;s tales of suffering, torture and humiliation. The stories portrayed here, however, are ever the more unusual, given their juxtaposition—and admixture—with religious imagery. The intention was neither to mock nor embrace religion, but experiment with the power inherent in its messages and the hypocrisy of many of its leaders.

Some songs, such as &quot;Beautiful Child&quot;, retain the vocal style of earlier days, but many are quite tame. The almost baroque &quot;In My Garden&quot;, for example, added an extra dimension with piano (used before on &quot;Fool&quot; and &quot;Sealed in Skin&quot; to far grimmer effect) and acoustic guitar. In between the two poles, there are pieces like &quot;Sex, God, Sex&quot; (heavy metal-like bass riffs with blues and gospel-inspired singing), &quot;Blood and Honey&quot; (a murder ballad with early post-rock tendencies) and &quot;Blind Love&quot; (a lengthy song, alternating between intoned vocals and violent instrumental passages). Gira considers this to be the band&#x27;s major turning point, saying by 1986/7 Swans &quot;had run its course with the physical assault of sound that they had employed previously for the most part. I wanted to move on to other things and didn&#x27;t want to get stuck in some style, which in our case had the potential of becoming cartoonish if we&#x27;d continued in that direction.

=== Later years (1988–1997) ===
After the &quot;Children of God&quot; album, Gira professed himself tired with the band&#x27;s fearsome reputation for noise, feeling that their audience now had expectations that he had no intention of fulfilling. He made a conscious decision to tone down the band&#x27;s sound, introducing more acoustic elements and increasingly emphasizing Jarboe as a singer. The first results of this shift in direction were the two records recorded by Gira and Jarboe under the names Skin (in Europe) and World of Skin (in the US). The first, &quot;Blood, Women, Roses&quot;, featured Jarboe on lead vocals, and the second, &quot;Shame, Humility, Revenge&quot;, featured Gira on lead vocals. Both were recorded together in 1987, although &quot;Shame, Humility, Revenge&quot; was not released until 1988. These albums are full of slow, ethereal, melancholy, dirge-like songs, sounding like stripped-down acoustic versions of the &quot;Children of God&quot; songs.

The band continued this transformation with an unexpected cover of Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot;, which was released as a single in 1988 on Product Inc. in a confusing array of 7&quot; and 12&quot; inch formats. Both Gira and Jarboe sang lead vocals on different versions of the song. In later years Gira dismissed this release as a mistake, and for a long time refused to reissue his own vocal version, although Jarboe&#x27;s version was re-released much sooner. However their version of the song was a hit on US college radio in 1988, which led to the group being offered a major label deal at Uni/MCA. &quot;I&#x27;d worked so hard all my life&quot;, said Gira. &quot;At 15, I was digging ditches in the desert in Israel, and I put myself through college painting houses. I never saw any money from any of our records. So by the time I finally got that carrot dangled in front of me, it was like, &#x27;at last, I can make a living at what I love to do.&#x27;&quot;

This single was followed by &quot;The Burning World&quot; (1989), Swans&#x27; first and only major label album. Released on Uni/MCA Records, the record was produced by Bill Laswell and expanded the acoustic palette introduced on &quot;Greed&quot; and &quot;Children of God&quot;. For this album, the core line-up of Michael Gira, Jarboe and Westberg was augmented by session musicians, and the distinctive heavy guitar element of their earlier work was toned down significantly in favor of folk and world music elements. Though Swans would later explore more acoustic music with similar moods, Gira has stated that, while he admires much of Laswell&#x27;s work, his efforts with Swans were simply a mismatch. The album reportedly sold 5000 copies in the UK, one of the lowest numbers in the history of MCA Records, and was soon deleted from MCA&#x27;s catalogue.

&quot;The Burning World&quot; was the first Swans album to feature more conventional pop melodies. Gira&#x27;s lyrics still favored themes of depression, death, greed and despair, but were actually sung, rather than the chanting or shouting typical of earlier material. They even covered Steve Winwood&#x27;s popular Blind Faith hit &quot;Can&#x27;t Find My Way Home&quot;, one of two singles from the LP.

In 1990, Gira and Jarboe released the third and final World of Skin album, &quot;Ten Songs for Another World&quot;. It was less successful than the previous two Skin albums.

Gira&#x27;s disillusionment with their Uni/MCA exploits led to &quot;White Light from the Mouth of Infinity&quot; (1991), a successful blending of earlier hard rock and later pop styles. Produced by Gira, the album blended acoustic rock, blues and hypnotic guitar noise successfully, resulting in an album more complex than anything they had released in the past. This album was followed by &quot;Love of Life&quot; (recorded by Martin Bisi in 1992), the EP single &quot;Love of Life/Amnesia&quot;, taking the group even farther into experimentation, and then &quot;The Great Annihilator&quot; (1995), considered to be one of the band&#x27;s most accessible releases, possibly through being their most straightforward. The songwriting style and musical approach, however, would take a more unusual turn the following year.

==== Demise ====
With other projects occupying his time, Gira decided to end the group with one last studio album and a world tour. &quot;Soundtracks for the Blind&quot; (1996) was a two-disc album featuring Jarboe-supplied field recordings, experimental music, dark ambient soundscapes, post-industrial epics, post-rock suites and acoustic guitar. In 1998, &quot;Swans Are Dead&quot; was released, consisting of live recordings from their 1995 and 1997 tours. In an interview, Gira revealed that there is more live material that may be released in the future. He described these unreleased recordings as &quot;fairly spectacular&quot;.

=== Post-breakup and re-formation (1997–2017) ===
After dissolving Swans, Gira formed Angels of Light, continued his work with Young God Records and Jarboe continued her solo work.

In January 2010, Swans&#x27; re-formation was heralded with a new song posted on the Young God Records&#x27; MySpace, and officially confirmed by a post on the Young God Records Facebook and MySpace accounts. Gira decided to bring back Swans during an Angels of Light show five years prior. In the middle of performing the song &quot;The Provider&quot; onstage utilizing &quot;large chords that were very sustained and swaying, in this sort of slave-ship rhythm,&quot; he felt &quot;a nascent urge right then to re-form or reinvigorate Swans because I remembered how elevating and intense that experience was&quot;. To help raise money for the upcoming new Swans album, Gira released a new solo album, &quot;I Am Not Insane&quot;, via his Young God Records website. &quot;LAS Magazine&quot; posted an article entitled &quot;Kickstart My Art&quot; on alternative financing in &quot;a cash-strapped music industry, unable to rely on record label financing, [that] is positioning its own quid pro quo: fan dollars to fund projects in exchange for exclusive material and a sense of involvement&quot; that cites Swans selling out of the 1,000 signed and numbered copies of &quot;I Am Not Insane&quot; as an example of reverse financing where proceeds from one project are rolled over to finance the next.
Swans then went on a series of U.S. and European tour dates, and headlined the Supersonic Festival in Birmingham, England in October 2010. The first post-reformation Swans album, &quot;My Father Will Guide Me up a Rope to the Sky&quot;, was released on September 23, 2010, and the band simultaneously embarked on an eighteen-month world tour. The band were chosen by Portishead to perform at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror festivals that Portishead curated in July 2011 at London&#x27;s Alexandra Palace, and, in September 2011, in Asbury Park, New Jersey.

In 2012 Swans released the live album &quot;We Rose from Your Bed with the Sun in Our Head&quot;, featuring material culled from their 2010–2011 tour, in support of production and recording costs for their forthcoming record, &quot;The Seer&quot;. Initially released as a limited handmade edition of 1000 copies, &quot;We Rose...&quot; was re-released in May 2012 as a deluxe digipak.
On July 15, 2013, Gira announced a new, handmade live album in the vein of &quot;I Am Not Insane&quot; and &quot;We Rose...&quot;, titled &quot;Not Here / Not Now&quot;. The album was announced for sale on October 14, with the proceeds helping to fund the recording of the new Swans studio album with John Congleton, announced in 2014 as &quot;To Be Kind&quot;.

In 2014 the band announced that it signed with Mute Records for the world outside North America and that the band would be touring. That same year, in November, the band curated a three-day program at Le Guess Who? in Utrecht, The Netherlands, including Wire, Silver Apples, Ben Frost, Prurient and Words to the Blind, a project by Savages together with Japanese band Bo Ningen.

In 2014 both &quot;The Seer&quot; and &quot;To Be Kind&quot; were ranked on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 Albums of the Decade So Far 2010–2014.&quot; &quot;The Seer&quot; was ranked 17 and &quot;To Be Kind&quot; was ranked 85.

The band announced on July 22, 2015, that they would be recording their fourteenth studio album in September 2015, following a fundraiser album entitled &quot;The Gate&quot;, as with the three previous post-reunion studio albums. On April 5, 2016, the band announced &quot;The Glowing Man&quot; and shared a two-minute excerpt of the twenty-nine minute title track. The album was released on June 17, 2016, on Young God Records and Mute Records, and is the final Swans album released under a mostly homogeneous lineup, although Gira continues to record Swans music with &quot;a revolving cast&quot; of musicians, as of 2019.

This final incarnation of the band announced for immediate release a live album, &quot;Deliquescence&quot;, on May 17. The album, limited to 3,000 CD-only copies, contains three tracks that have previously only been played live.

=== Hiatus and new, dynamic line-ups (2018–present)===
Following a nearly year-long break from Swans, Gira announced a brief tour of new Swans material playing along the West Coast of the United States, which started in September 2018 accompanied by longtime Swans guitarist Norman Westberg with recording of a new album commencing in Berlin in February 2019. The fifteenth Swans album was preceded (and financed) by another fundraiser album of demos, &quot;What Is This?&quot;, released in March 2019. Updates between June and August 2019 confirmed that the upcoming album was fully recorded, mixed and mastered. On September 5, the album was revealed to be called &quot;Leaving Meaning&quot; and a single from the album titled &quot;It&#x27;s Coming It&#x27;s Real&quot; was released. The album itself was released on October 25. It features guitarist Christoph Hahn, percussionist Larry Mullins and bassist Yoyo Röhm as main contributors. In 2019, a documentary about the band, called &quot;Where Does a Body End?&quot; was also released by Italian-American director Marco Porsia. In March 2021, Gira announced a new Swans album with an Instagram post of a tracklist.

On January 6, 2022, Michael Gira announced on his Instagram that a new fundraiser album was available via Young God Records, called &quot;Is There Really a Mind?&quot;. The fundraiser album sold out in just nine days. Young God Records said Swans would begin recording in April 2022. On March 22, 2023, the album was revealed to be titled &quot;The Beggar&quot;, and a single from the album titled &quot;Paradise Is Mine&quot; was released. &quot;The Beggar&quot; was released on June 23, 2023.

In July 2024, Gira announced a live album, &quot;Live Rope&quot;, recorded at performances in 2023 and 2024 and intended to fund the creation of another Swans album. On November 15, 2024, Gira announced on Instagram that the album would be titled &quot;Birthing&quot;, to be mixed in Berlin that month and released in 2025, and described it as &quot;the final &quot;big sound&quot; Swans album&quot;:
&quot;Going forward (after the release of &quot;Birthing&quot; and its subsequent tours), things will be simpler and more intimate for Swans. When that time comes, I look forward to discovering a fresh path towards a new sonic terrain in which to dwell.&quot;

&quot;I Am a Tower&quot;, the first single from &quot;Birthing&quot;, was released on February 25, 2025. The album was also given a release date of May 30, 2025.

==Musical style and legacy==

Swans&#x27; music has transformed greatly over the decades, but is typically dark and &quot;apocalyptic&quot;, often focusing on themes of power, religion, sex and death, and has been most generally associated with experimental rock. According to &quot;Spin&quot;, the band demonstrates &quot;unparalleled ability to translate the absurd violence of the human condition into music that’s as intoxicating as it is intense.&quot;

Their early work, rooted in the New York City-based no wave movement which was fading out by the time of their formation in 1982, is extremely aggressive, characterized by Michael Gira as &quot;stripping down the essential elements of what we consider to be rock music&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it as &quot;a cacophonous rhythmic throb which drew on post-punk, industrial, doom metal, NYC avant minimalism and the blues; a sound which was matched by Gira&#x27;s often nihilistic, anti-natalist and existential lyrical concerns ... delivered in a stentorian and messianic manner.&quot; It was a contribution to both industrial music and noise rock and influenced the emergence of grindcore (inspiring also the use of &quot;grind&quot; in musical context) and sludge metal. Later in the 1980s, Swans&#x27; music began to incorporate more melodic and intricate elements, especially since Jarboe&#x27;s debut as a songwriter on 1987&#x27;s &quot;Children of God&quot;. While generally maintaining much dissonance, the band&#x27;s subsequent work further ventured into genres such as post-punk, gothic rock, neofolk, psychedelic rock and art rock. Their final album before breaking up, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Soundtracks for the Blind&quot;, is a double album which emphasizes atmosphere, branching into post-rock, drone and dark ambient. Since re-forming in 2010, they have continued to be associated with post-rock and drone music as well as noise rock. The double albums from the latest years, which have brought them widespread critical acclaim, often feature long songs that develop complex soundscapes.

Swans have been cited as an influence by a variety of rock and extreme metal musicians, including members of Napalm Death, Godflesh, Melvins, Neurosis, Treponem Pal, Nirvana, Tool, My Dying Bride, Isis, Weakling, Leviathan, Natural Snow Buildings, Khanate, Liturgy, Vision Eternel, Car Seat Headrest, Full of Hell, and Sprain.

<text>Valles Marineris (; Latin for &quot;Mariner Valleys&quot;, named after the Mariner 9 Mars orbiter of 1971–72 which discovered it) is a system of canyons that runs along the Martian surface east of the Tharsis region. At more than long, wide and up to deep, Valles Marineris is the largest canyon in the Solar System.

Valles Marineris is located along the equator of Mars, on the east side of the Tharsis Bulge, and stretches for nearly a quarter of the planet&#x27;s circumference. The canyon system starts in the west with Noctis Labyrinthus; proceeding to the east are Tithonium and Ius chasmata, then Melas, Candor and Ophir chasmata, then Coprates Chasma, then Ganges, Capri and Eos chasmata; finally it empties into an outflow channel region containing chaotic terrain that ends in the basin of Chryse Planitia.

It has been recently suggested that Valles Marineris is a large tectonic &quot;crack&quot; in the Martian crust. Most researchers agree that this formed as the crust thickened in the Tharsis region to the west, and was subsequently widened by erosion. Near the eastern flanks of the rift, there appear to be channels that may have been formed by water or carbon dioxide. It has also been proposed that Valles Marineris is a large channel formed by the erosion of lava flowing from the flank of Pavonis Mons.

== Formation ==

The most agreed upon theory today is that Valles Marineris was formed by rift faults, later enlarged by erosion and collapsing of the rift walls, similar to how the East African Rift was formed. The formation of Valles Marineris is thought to be closely tied with the formation of the Tharsis Bulge. The Tharsis Bulge was formed from the Noachian to Late Hesperian period of Mars, in three stages.

The first stage consisted of a combination of volcanism and isostatic uplift; soon, however, the volcanism loaded the crust to a point at which the crust could no longer support the added weight of Tharsis, leading to widespread graben formation in the elevated regions of Tharsis. The second stage consisted of more volcanism and a loss of isostatic equilibrium; the source regions of the volcanism no longer resided underneath Tharsis, creating a very large load. Finally, the crust failed to hold up Tharsis and radial fractures formed, including at Valles Marineris. The third stage mainly consisted of more volcanism and asteroid impacts. The crust, having already reached its failure point, just stayed in place and younger volcanoes formed. Tharsis volcanism involved very low viscosity magma, forming shield volcanoes similar to those of the Hawaiian Island chain, but, because there is minor or no current active plate tectonics on Mars, the hotspot activity led to very long histories of repeated volcanic eruptions at the same spots, creating some of the largest volcanoes in the solar system, including the biggest, Olympus Mons.

Landslides have left numerous deposits on the floor of Valles Marineris and contributed to widening it. Possible triggers of landslides are quakes caused by tectonic activity or impact events. Both types of events release seismic waves that accelerate the ground at and below the surface. Mars is much less tectonically active than Earth, and marsquakes are unlikely to have provided seismic waves of the required magnitude. Most sizable craters on Mars date to the Late Heavy Bombardment, 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago (the Noachian period), and are older than the landslide deposits in Valles Marineris. However, three craters (including the crater Oudemans) have been identified, on the basis of their proximity and later dates, as ones whose formation may have caused some of the landslides.


===Former formation hypotheses===
Hypotheses about the formation of Valles Marineris have changed over the years. Ideas in the 1970s were erosion by water or thermokarst activity. Thermokarst activity may have contributed, but erosion by water is a problematic mechanism because liquid water cannot exist in most current Martian surface conditions, which typically experience about 1% of Earth&#x27;s atmospheric pressure and a temperature range of to . Many scientists however agree that liquid water flowed on the Martian surface in the past, when atmospheric conditions were different. Valles Marineris may have been enlarged by flowing water at that time. Another hypothesis by McCauley in 1972 was that the canyons formed by withdrawal of subsurface magma. Around 1989, a formation hypothesis by tensional fracturing was proposed.

== Regions of Valles Marineris ==
=== Noctis Labyrinthus ===
Noctis Labyrinthus, on the western edge of the Valles Marineris Rift System, north of the Syria Planum and east of Pavonis Mons, is a jumbled terrain composed of huge blocks which are heavily fractured. It also contains canyons that run in different directions surrounding large blocks of older terrain. Most of the upper parts of the blocks are composed of younger fractured material thought to be of volcanic origin associated with the Tharsis bulge. The other tops are composed of older fractured material thought also to be volcanic in origin, but differentiated from the younger material by more ruggedness and more impact craters. The sides of the blocks are composed of undivided material thought to be basement rock. The space between the blocks is composed mainly of either rough or smooth floor material. The rough floor material tends to be in the eastern portion of the Noctis Labyrinthus and is thought to be debris from the walls or maybe eolian features covering rough topography and landslides. The smooth floor material is thought to be composed of fluvial or basaltic material and/or eolian features covering an otherwise rough and jumbled terrain. Terrains such as Noctis Labyrinthus are commonly found at the head of outflow channels, like the one explored by the Pathfinder mission and its Sojourner rover. They are interpreted to be a place of downward block faulting associated with the removal of ground fluid in catastrophic flood sequences. The fluid could be either carbon-dioxide ice and gas, water or lava. The hypothesis of lava involvement is associated with a proposal that Noctis Labyrinthus is directly connected to lava tubes on the slope of Pavonis Mons. In 2024, scientists found evidence that the hypothesized lava came from a volcano they dubbed Noctis Mons, which would be the seventh-highest mountain on Mars at , and that the eastern part of its base was home to multiple glaciers with potential for hosting life, which could make it a highly valuable candidate target for astrobiology missions. 

=== Ius and Tithonium chasmata ===

Further to the east from Oudemans, Ius and Tithonium chasmata are located parallel to each other, Ius to the south and Tithonium to the north. Ius is the wider of the two, leading to Melas Chasma. Ius has a ridge down the center of it by the name of Geryon Montes, composed of the undivided basement rock. The floor of Ius Chasma is mostly composed of pristine landslide material, not much degraded by cratering or erosion. The southern wall of Ius, and to a lesser extent the northern wall, has many short valleys stretching off roughly perpendicular to the line of the chasmas. These valleys have a stubby theater-headed leading edge very much like features seen on the Colorado Plateau near the Grand Canyon that appear from groundwater sapping. (Theater-headed means that, from above, the head of the valley is a well-defined U-shape). The valley is propagated by the continued erosion and the collapse of the wall. Tithonium Chasma is very similar to Ius, except it is lacking the sapping features on the south side and contains a small portion of material that is similar to the smooth floor features except that it appears to be an ash fall that has been eroded by the wind. Between the two canyons, the surface is composed of younger fractured material - lava flows and faults from crustal extension of the Tharsis Bulge.

=== Melas, Candor and Ophir chasmata ===

The next portion of Valles Marineris to the east are three chasmata, that from south to north are Melas, Candor and Ophir chasmata. Melas is east of Ius, Candor is east of Tithonium and Ophir appears as an oval that runs into Candor. All three chasmata are connected. The floor of Melas Chasma is about 70% younger massive material that is thought to be volcanic ash whipped up by the wind into eolian features. It also contains rough floor material from the erosion of the canyon walls. Also, in these central chasmata there is a portion of the floor that is higher than the rest of the floor, most likely left by the continued dropping of the other floor material. Around the edges of Melas is also a lot of slide material as seen in Ius and Tithonium chasmata.

The material of the floor of the canyon system between Candor and Melas chasmata is grooved. This is interpreted to be alluvial deposits and/or material that has collapsed or contracted by the removal of ice or water. There are also portions of older and younger massive floor material of volcaniclastic origin - only separated in age by crater distribution. Also there is etched massive floor material that is like the younger and older massive material except that it has wind erosion features on it. There are also a few spires of undivided material composed of the same material as the canyon walls.

=== Coprates Chasma ===
Further to the east, the canyon system runs into Coprates Chasma, which is very similar to Ius and Tithonium chasmata. Coprates differs from Ius in the eastern end which contains alluvial deposits and eolian material and like Ius, has layered deposits, although the deposits in the Coprates Chasma are much more well defined. These deposits pre-date the Valles Marineris system, suggesting erosion and sedimentary processes later cut by the Valles Marineris system. Newer data from Mars Global Surveyor suggest that the origin of this layering is either just a succession of landslides, one over another, volcanic in origin, or it may be the bottom of a basin of either liquid or solid water ice suggesting that the peripheral canyons of the Valles Marineris system could have been at one time isolated lakes formed from erosional collapse. Another possible source of the layered deposits could be wind-blown, but the diversity of the layers suggests that this material is not dominant. Note that only the upper layers are thin, while the bottom layers are very big, suggesting that the lower layers were composed of mass wasted rock and the upper layers come from another source. Some of this layering may have been transferred to the floor by landslides in which the layers are kept semi-intact, yet the layered section looks highly deformed with thickening and thinning beds that have multitudes of folds in them as seen in MOC image #8405. This complex terrain could also be just eroded sediment from an ancient Martian lake-bed and appear complex because all that we have is an aerial view like a geologic map and not enough elevation data to see if the beds are horizontal.

Near 60° W is the deepest point of the Valles Marineris system (as well as its lowest point by elevation) at below the surrounding plateau. Eastward from here there is about a 0.03 degree slope upward before reaching the outflow channels, which means that if you poured fluid into this part of the canyon, it would form a lake with a depth of before spilling over towards the northern plains.

A field of more than 100 pitted cones on the floor of Coprates Chasma has been interpreted as a set of small igneous cinder or tuff cones, with associated lava flows. Crater dating indicates they are of Middle to Late Amazonian age, about 200 to 400 million years old.

=== Eos and Ganges chasmata ===

Further to the east lie Eos and Ganges chasmata. Eos Chasma&#x27;s western floor is mainly composed of an etched massive material composed of either volcanic or eolian deposits later eroded by the Martian wind. The eastern end of the Eos chasma has a large area of streamlined bars and longitudinal striations. This is interpreted to be stream-carved plateau deposits and material transported and deposited by flowing fluid. Ganges Chasma is an offshoot chasma of Eos in a general east–west trend. The floor of Ganges is mainly composed of alluvial deposits from the canyon walls.

=== Chryse region ===
East of Eos and Ganges, Valles Marineris empties out into the Chryse region of the northern plains of Mars at an elevation only above the deepest point of Valles Marineris in Melas Chasma. The outflow regions of the northern plains are similar to the terrain seen at the Mars Pathfinder landing site. A terrestrial counterpart of these outflow channels on Earth would be the scablands of eastern Washington. The eastern Washington scablands are a result of repeated catastrophic flooding due to the build-up of an ice dam at the head of Lake Missoula in the Late Pleistocene. The ice dam would block the water for a while, but when it broke, the ice would float on top of the ensuing flood and vast areas would be stripped of topsoil and vegetation, leaving a large barren area of &#x27;teardrop&#x27; islands, longitudinal grooves and terraced margins. Many of these features are also seen in Martian outflow channels, but on a larger scale.

The outflow occurs successively through several regions of chaotic terrain, Aurorae Chaos and Hydraotes Chaos, and finally through Simud Valles and Tiu Valles into Chryse Planitia.

<text>Henry Grace à Dieu (&quot;Henry, Thanks be to God&quot;), also known as Great Harry, was an English carrack or &quot;great ship&quot; of the King&#x27;s Fleet in the 16th century, and in her day the largest warship in the world. Contemporary with &quot;Mary Rose&quot;, &quot;Henry Grace à Dieu&quot; was even larger, and served as Henry VIII&#x27;s flagship. Built by William Bond (master shipwright) under the direction of Robert Brygandine (clerk of the ships), she had a large forecastle four decks high, and a stern castle two decks high. She was long, measuring 1,000 tons burthen and having a complement of 700 men. She was ordered by Henry VIII, probably to replace &quot;Grace Dieu&quot; (later renamed &quot;Regent&quot;), which had been destroyed at the Battle of Saint-Mathieu in August 1512. At a time of naval rivalry with the Kingdom of Scotland, her size was in response to the Scottish ship &quot;Great Michael&quot;, which had herself been the largest warship when launched in 1511.

==History==
The ship was built from 1512 to 1514 at the purpose-built Gun Wharf in Old Woolwich. This wharf became the origin of Woolwich Dockyard, although in the 1540s the dockyard moved further west to an area known as &quot;The King&#x27;s Yard&quot;, where it would remain for more than 300 years. &quot;Henry Grace à Dieu&quot; was one of the first vessels to feature gunports and had twenty of the new heavy bronze cannon, allowing for a broadside. She was fitted out later in the Naval Dockyard in Erith. In all she mounted 43 heavy guns and 141 light guns.

Very early on it became apparent that the ship was top heavy. She was plagued with heavy rolling in rough seas and her poor stability adversely affected gun accuracy and general performance as a fighting platform. To correct this, she underwent a substantial remodeling in Erith in 1536 (the same year as &quot;Mary Rose&quot;), during which the height of the hull was reduced. In this new form she was 1000 tons burthen and carried 151 guns of varying size, including 21 of bronze (comprising 4 cannon, 3 demi-cannon, 4 culverins, 2 demi-culverins, 4 sakers, 2 cannon perriers and 2 falcons), her full crew was reduced to between 700 and 800. She was given an improved and innovative sailing arrangement with four masts, each divided into three sections; the forward two square rigged with mainsail, topsail and topgallants; and the aft two carrying five lateen sails between them. This allowed for easier handling of the sails and spread wind forces more evenly on the ship, resulting in better speed and maneuverability, and allowing better use of the heavy broadside. The only surviving contemporary depiction of the craft is from the Anthony Roll.

&quot;Henry Grace à Dieu&quot; saw little action. She was present at the Battle of the Solent against French forces in 1545, in which &quot;Mary Rose&quot; sank. Overall, she was used more as a diplomatic vessel, including taking Henry VIII to the summit with Francis I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520 (although smaller ships had to be used to take the King out of the harbours at Dover and Calais, as neither was deep enough to permit vessels of this draught to operate).

After the accession of Edward VI in 1547, she was renamed for him. She was accidentally destroyed at Woolwich by fire in August 1553.

<text>Turnpike Lane is a street in Haringey, north London.

==Description==

Turnpike Lane forms part of the A504 route, running roughly east–west for less than one mile.

The road is characterised by independent retailers with flats above the shops. It is also a local transport hub: Turnpike Lane Underground station and Turnpike Lane bus station are both situated near the eastern end of the street.

A small park named Ducketts Common is situated at the eastern end of the road, opposite the Underground and bus stations. It was once an area of common land where people had the right to graze their animals.

Turnpike Lane is a busy cosmopolitan shopping street and an important traffic thoroughfare. Speciality shops remain open until late at night, and there are a number of restaurants.

The name Turnpike Lane is also used to refer more generally to the area at the southern end of Wood Green High Road and its surroundings.
