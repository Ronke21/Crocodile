<text>Charles-François Gounod (; ; 17 June 181818 October 1893), usually known as Charles Gounod, was a French composer. He wrote twelve operas, of which the most popular has always been &quot;Faust&quot; (1859); his &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; (1867) also remains in the international repertory. He composed a large amount of church music, many songs, and popular short pieces including his &quot;Ave Maria&quot; (an elaboration of a Bach piece) and &quot;Funeral March of a Marionette&quot;.

Born in Paris into an artistic and musical family, Gounod was a student at the Conservatoire de Paris and won France&#x27;s most prestigious musical prize, the Prix de Rome. His studies took him to Italy, Austria and then Prussia, where he met Felix Mendelssohn, whose advocacy of the music of Bach was an early influence on him. He was deeply religious, and after his return to Paris, he briefly considered becoming a priest. He composed prolifically, writing church music, songs, orchestral music and operas.

Gounod&#x27;s career was disrupted by the Franco-Prussian War. He moved to England with his family for refuge from the Prussian advance on Paris in 1870. After peace was restored in 1871 his family returned to Paris but he remained in London, living in the house of an amateur singer, Georgina Weldon, who became the controlling figure in his life. After nearly three years he broke away from her and returned to his family in France. His absence, and the appearance of younger French composers, meant that he was no longer at the forefront of French musical life; although he remained a respected figure he was regarded as old-fashioned during his later years, and operatic success eluded him. He died at his house in Saint-Cloud, near Paris, at the age of 75.

Few of Gounod&#x27;s works remain in the regular international repertoire, but his influence on later French composers was considerable. In his music there is a strand of romantic sentiment that is continued in the operas of Jules Massenet and others; there is also a strand of classical restraint and elegance that influenced Gabriel Fauré. Claude Debussy wrote that Gounod represented the essential French sensibility of his time.

==Life and career==

===Early years===

Gounod was born on 17 June 1818 in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the second son of François-Louis Gounod (1758–1823) and his wife Victoire, &quot;née&quot; Lemachois (1780–1858). François was a painter and art teacher; Victoire was a talented pianist, who had given lessons in her early years. The elder son, Louis Urbain (1807–1850), became a successful architect. Shortly after Charles&#x27;s birth François was appointed official artist to the Duc de Berry, a member of the royal family, and the Gounods&#x27; home in Charles&#x27;s early years was at the Palace of Versailles, where they were allotted an apartment.

After François&#x27;s death in 1823, Victoire supported the family by returning to her old occupation as a piano teacher. The young Gounod attended a succession of schools in Paris, ending with the Lycée Saint-Louis. He was a capable scholar, excelling in Latin and Greek. His mother, the daughter of a magistrate, hoped Gounod would pursue a secure career as a lawyer, but his interests were in the arts: he was a talented painter and outstandingly musical. Early influences on him, in addition to his mother&#x27;s musical instruction, were operas, seen at the Théâtre-Italien: Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; and Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. Of a performance of the latter in 1835 he later recalled, &quot;I sat in one long rapture from the beginning of the opera to its close&quot;. Later in the same year he heard performances of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Pastoral&quot; and &quot;Choral&quot; symphonies, which added &quot;fresh impulse to my musical ardour&quot;.
While still at school Gounod studied music privately with Anton Reicha – who had been a friend of Beethoven and was described by a contemporary as &quot;the greatest teacher then living&quot; – and in 1836 he was admitted to the Conservatoire de Paris. There he studied composition with Fromental Halévy, Henri Berton, Jean Lesueur and Ferdinando Paer and piano with Pierre Zimmerman. His various teachers made only a moderate impression on Gounod&#x27;s musical development, but during his time at the Conservatoire he encountered Hector Berlioz. He later said that Berlioz and his music were among the greatest emotional influences of his youth. In 1838, after Lesueur&#x27;s death, some of his former students collaborated to compose a commemorative mass; the Agnus Dei was allocated to Gounod. Berlioz said of it, &quot;The Agnus, for three solo voices with chorus, by M. Gounod, the youngest of Lesueur&#x27;s pupils, is beautiful – very beautiful. Everything in it is novel and distinguished – melody, modulation, harmony. In this piece M. Gounod has given proof that we may expect everything of him&quot;.

===Prix de Rome===
In 1839, at his third attempt, Gounod won France&#x27;s most prestigious musical prize, the Prix de Rome for composition, for his cantata &quot;Fernand&quot;. In doing so he was surpassing his father: François had taken the second prize in the Prix de Rome for painting in 1783. The Prix brought the winner two years&#x27; subsidised study at the French Institute in Rome and a further year in Austria and Germany. For Gounod this not only launched his musical career, but made impressions on him both spiritually and musically that stayed with him for the rest of his life. In the view of the musicologist Timothy Flynn, the Prix, with its time in Italy, Austria and Germany, was &quot;arguably the most significant event in [Gounod&#x27;s] career&quot;. He was fortunate that the director of the institute was the painter Dominique Ingres, who had known François Gounod well and took his old friend&#x27;s son under his wing.
Among the artistic notables the composer met in Rome were the singer Pauline Viardot and the pianist Fanny Hensel, sister of Felix Mendelssohn. Viardot became of great help to Gounod in his later career, and through Hensel he got to know the music not only of her brother but also of J.S.Bach, whose music, long neglected, Mendelssohn was enthusiastically reviving. Gounod was also introduced to &quot;various masterpieces of German music which I had never heard before&quot;. While in Italy, Gounod read Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, and began sketching music for an operatic setting, which came to fruition over the next twenty years. Other music he composed during his three years&#x27; scholarship included some of his best-known songs, such as &quot;Où voulez-vous aller?&quot; (1839), &quot;Le Soir&quot; (1840–1842) and &quot;Venise&quot; (1842), and a setting of the Mass ordinary, which was performed at the church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome.

In Rome, Gounod found his strong religious impulses increased under the influence of the Dominican preacher Henri-Dominique Lacordaire and he was inspired by paintings in the city&#x27;s churches. Unlike Berlioz, who had been unimpressed by the visual arts of Rome when he was at the Institute ten years earlier, Gounod was awed by the work of Michelangelo. He also came to know and revere the sacred music of Palestrina, which he described as a musical translation of Michelangelo&#x27;s art. The music of some of his own Italian contemporaries did not appeal to him. He severely criticised operas by Donizetti, Bellini and Mercadante, composers he described as merely &quot;vines twisted around the great Rossinian trunk, without its vitality and majesty&quot; and lacking Rossini&#x27;s spontaneous melodic genius.

For the last year of his Prix de Rome scholarship, Gounod moved to Austria and Germany. At the Court Opera in Vienna he heard &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; for the first time, and his letters record his joy at living in the city where Mozart and Beethoven had worked. Count Ferdinand von Stockhammer, a leading patron of the arts in Vienna, arranged for Gounod&#x27;s setting of the Requiem Mass to be performed. It was warmly received, and its success led Stockhammer to commission a second Mass from the composer.

From Vienna, Gounod moved on to Prussia. He renewed his acquaintance with Fanny Hensel in Berlin and then went on to Leipzig to meet her brother. At their first encounter Mendelssohn greeted him, &quot;So you&#x27;re the madman my sister has told me about&quot;, but he devoted four days to entertaining the young man and gave him much encouragement. He arranged a special concert of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra so that his guest might hear the &quot;Scottish&quot; Symphony, and played him some of the works of Bach on the organ of the Thomaskirche. Reciprocating, Gounod played the Dies Irae from his Viennese Requiem, and was gratified when Mendelssohn said of one passage that it was worthy to be signed by Luigi Cherubini. Gounod commented, &quot;Words like this from such a master are a true honour and one wears them with more pride than many a ribbon&quot;.

===Rising reputation===

Gounod arrived home in Paris in May 1843. He took up a post, which his mother had helped to secure, as chapel master of the church of the Missions étrangères. For a winner of the Prix de Rome it was not a distinguished position. The organ of the church was poor, and the choir consisted of two basses, a tenor and a choirboy. To compound Gounod&#x27;s difficulties, the regular congregation was hostile to his attempts to improve the music of the church. He expressed his views to a colleague:

Despite his generally affable and compliant nature Gounod remained adamant; he gradually won his parishioners over, and served for most of the five-year term he had agreed to. During this period Gounod&#x27;s religious feelings became increasingly strong. He was reunited with a childhood friend, now a priest, Charles Gay, and for a time he himself felt drawn to holy orders. In 1847 he began to study theology and philosophy at the seminary of St Sulpice, but before long his secular side asserted itself. Doubting his capacity for celibacy, he decided not to seek ordination and continued with his career as a musician. He later recalled:
The outset of Gounod&#x27;s theatrical career was greatly helped by his reacquaintance with Pauline Viardot in Paris in 1849. Viardot, then at the peak of her fame, was able to secure for him a commission for a full-length opera. In this Gounod was exceptionally fortunate: a novice composer in the 1840s would usually, at the most, be asked to write a one-act curtain raiser. Gounod and his librettist, Émile Augier, created &quot;Sapho&quot;, drawing on Ancient Greek legend. It was intended as a departure from the three genres of opera then prevalent in Paris – Italian opera, grand opera and opéra comique. It later came to be regarded as the first of a new type, opéra lyrique, but at the time it was thought by some to be a throwback to the operas of Gluck, written sixty or seventy years earlier. After difficulties with the censor, who found the text politically suspect and too erotic, &quot;Sapho&quot; was given at the Paris Opéra at the Salle Le Peletier on 16 April 1851. It was reviewed by Berlioz in his capacity as a music critic; he found some parts &quot;extremely beautiful … the highest poetic level of drama&quot;, and others &quot;hideous, unbearable, horrible&quot;. It did not draw the public and closed after nine performances. The opera received a single performance at the Royal Opera House in London later in the same year, with Viardot again in the title role. The music received more praise than the libretto, and the performers received more than either, but &quot;The Morning Post&quot; recorded, &quot;The opera, we regret to say, was received very coldly&quot;.
In April 1851 Gounod married Anna Zimmerman, daughter of his former piano professor at the Conservatoire. The marriage led to a breach with Viardot; the Zimmermans refused to have anything to do with her, for reasons that are not clear. Gounod&#x27;s biographer Steven Huebner refers to rumours about a liaison between the singer and composer, but adds that &quot;the real story remains murky&quot;. Gounod was appointed superintendent of instruction in singing to the communal schools in the city of Paris, and from 1852 to 1860 he was director of a prominent choral society, the Orphéon de la Ville de Paris. He also frequently stood in for his elderly and often ill father-in-law, giving music lessons to private pupils. One of them, Georges Bizet, found Gounod&#x27;s teaching inspiring, praised &quot;his warm and paternal interest&quot; and remained a lifelong admirer.

Despite the brevity of &quot;Sapho&quot;″s run, the piece advanced Gounod&#x27;s reputation, and the Comédie-Française commissioned him to write incidental music for François Ponsard&#x27;s five-act verse tragedy &quot;Ulysse&quot; (1852), based on the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. The score included twelve choruses as well as orchestral interludes. It was not a successful production: Ponsard&#x27;s play was not well received, and the audience at the Comédie-Française had little interest in music. During the 1850s Gounod composed his two symphonies for full orchestra and one of his best-known religious works, the Messe solennelle en l&#x27;honneur de Sainte-Cécile. It was written for the St Cecilia&#x27;s day celebrations of 1855 at Saint-Eustache, and in Flynn&#x27;s view demonstrates Gounod&#x27;s success in &quot;blending the operatic style with church music – a task at which many of his colleagues tried and failed&quot;.

As well as church and concert music, Gounod was composing operas, beginning with &quot;La Nonne sanglante&quot; (The Bloody Nun, 1854), a melodramatic ghost story with a libretto that Berlioz had tried and failed to set, and that Auber, Meyerbeer, Verdi and others had rejected. The librettists, Eugène Scribe and Germain Delavigne, reworked the text for Gounod and the piece opened at the Opéra on 18 October 1854. The critics derided the libretto but praised the music and production; the work was doing well at the box-office until it fell victim to musical politics. The director of the Opéra, Nestor Roqueplan, was supplanted by his enemy, François-Louis Crosnier, who described &quot;La Nonne sanglante&quot; as &quot;filth&quot; and shut the production down after its eleventh performance.

===Operatic successes and failures===
In January 1856 Gounod was appointed a knight of the Legion of Honour. In June of that year he and his wife had the first of their two children, a son Jean (1856–1935). (Their daughter Jeanne (1863–1945) was born seven years later.) In 1858 Gounod composed his next opera, &quot;Le Médecin malgré lui&quot;. With a good libretto by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré, faithful to the Molière comedy on which it is based, it gained excellent reviews, but its good reception was overshadowed for Gounod by the death of his mother the day after the premiere. At the time an initial run of 100 performances was considered a success; &quot;Le Médecin malgré lui&quot; achieved that and was revived in Paris and elsewhere during the rest of the 19th century and into the 20th. In 1893 the British &quot;Musical Times&quot; praised its &quot;irresistible gaiety&quot;. Huebner comments that the opera does not deserve the relative neglect into which it has since fallen.
With Barbier and Carré, Gounod turned from French comedy to German legend for &quot;Faust&quot;. The three had worked on the piece in 1856, but it had to be shelved to avoid clashing with a rival (non-operatic) &quot;Faust&quot; at another theatre. Returning to it in 1858 Gounod completed the score, rehearsals began towards the end of the year and the opera opened at the Théâtre-Lyrique in March 1859. One critic reported that it was presented &quot;under circumstances of uncommon excitement and expectation&quot;; another praised the work but doubted if it would have enough popular appeal to be a commercial triumph. The composer later recalled that the opera &quot;did not strike the public very much at first&quot;, but after some revision and with a good deal of vigorous promotion by Gounod&#x27;s publisher, Antoine de Choudens, it became an international success. There were productions in Vienna in 1861, and in Berlin, London and New York in 1863. &quot;Faust&quot; has remained Gounod&#x27;s most popular opera and one of the staples of the operatic repertoire.

Over the next eight years Gounod composed five more operas, all with Barbier or Carré or both. &quot;Philémon et Baucis&quot; (1860) and &quot;La Colombe&quot; (The Dove, 1860) were opéras comiques based on stories by Jean de La Fontaine. The first was an attempt to take advantage of a vogue for mildly satirical comedies in mythological dress started by Jacques Offenbach with &quot;Orphée aux enfers&quot; (1858). The opera had originally been intended for the theatre at Baden-Baden, but Offenbach and his authors expanded it for its eventual first performance, in Paris at the Théâtre Lyrique. &quot;La Colombe&quot;, also written for Baden-Baden, was premiered there and later expanded for its first Paris production (1886).

After these two moderate successes, Gounod had an outright failure, &quot;La Reine de Saba&quot; (1862), a grand opera with an exotic setting. The piece was lavishly mounted, and the premiere was attended by the Emperor Napoleon III and the Empress Eugénie, but the reviews were damning and the run finished after fifteen performances. The composer, depressed by the failure, sought comfort in a long trip to Rome with his family. The city enchanted him as much as ever: in Huebner&#x27;s words &quot;renewed exposure to Rome&#x27;s close entwining of Christianity and classical culture energized him for the travails of his career back in Paris&quot;.

Gounod&#x27;s next opera was &quot;Mireille&quot; (1864), a five-act tragedy in a Provençal peasant setting. Gounod travelled to Provence to absorb the local atmosphere of the various settings of the work and to meet the author of the original story, Frédéric Mistral. Some critics have seen the piece as a forerunner of &quot;verismo&quot; opera, although one that emphasises elegance over sensationalism. The opera was not a great success at first; there were strong objections from some quarters that Gounod had given full tragic status to a mere farmer&#x27;s daughter. After some revision it became popular in France, and remained in the regular opéra comique repertoire into the 20th century.

In 1866 Gounod was elected to the Académie des Beaux-Arts and was promoted within the Legion of Honour. During the 1860s his non-operatic works included a Mass (1862), a Stabat Mater (1867), twenty shorter pieces of liturgical or other religious music, two cantatas – one religious, one secular – and a &quot;Marche pontificale&quot; for the anniversary of the coronation of Pius IX (1869), later adopted as the official anthem of the Vatican City.

Gounod&#x27;s last opera of the 1860s was &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; (1867), with a libretto that follows Shakespeare&#x27;s play fairly closely. The piece was a success from the outset, with box-office receipts boosted by the large number of visitors to Paris for the Exposition Universelle. Within a year of the premiere it was staged in major opera houses in continental Europe, Britain and the US. Other than &quot;Faust&quot; it remains the only Gounod opera to be frequently staged internationally.

===London===
After the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, Gounod moved with his family from their home in Saint-Cloud, outside Paris, first to the countryside near Dieppe and then to England. The house in Saint-Cloud was wrecked by the advancing Prussians in the build-up to the Siege of Paris. To earn a living in London, Gounod wrote music for a British publisher; in Victorian Britain there was a great demand for religious and quasi-religious drawing room ballads, and he was happy to provide them.

Gounod accepted an invitation from the organising committee of the Annual International Exhibition to write a choral piece for its grand opening at the Royal Albert Hall on 1 May 1871. As a result of its favourable reception he was appointed director of the new Royal Albert Hall Choral Society, which, with Queen Victoria&#x27;s approval, was subsequently renamed the Royal Choral Society. He also conducted orchestral concerts for the Philharmonic Society and at the Crystal Palace, St James&#x27;s Hall and other venues. Proponents of English music complained that Gounod neglected native composers in his concerts, but his own music was popular and widely praised. The music critic of &quot;The Times&quot;, J. W. Davison, rarely pleased by modern music, was not an admirer, but Henry Chorley of &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; was an enthusiastic supporter, and writers in &quot;The Musical World&quot;, &quot;The Standard&quot;, &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; and &quot;The Morning Post&quot; called Gounod a great composer.
In February 1871, Julius Benedict, the director of the Philharmonic Society, introduced Gounod to a singer and music teacher, Georgina Weldon. She quickly became a dominant influence in Gounod&#x27;s professional and personal life. There was much inconclusive conjecture about the nature of their relationship. Once peace was restored in France during 1871, Anna Gounod returned home with her mother and children, but Gounod stayed on in London, living in the Weldons&#x27; house. Weldon introduced him to competitive business practices with publishers, negotiating substantial royalties, but eventually pushed such matters too far and involved him in litigation brought by his publisher, which the composer lost.

Gounod lived in the Weldons&#x27; household for nearly three years. The French newspapers speculated about his motives for remaining in London; they speculated the more when it was suggested that he had declined the French President&#x27;s invitation to return and succeed Auber as director of the Conservatoire. In early 1874 his relations with Davison of &quot;The Times&quot;, never cordial, descended into personal hostility. The pressures on him in England and the comments about him in France brought Gounod to a state of nervous collapse, and in May 1874 his friend Gaston de Beaucourt came to London and took him back home to Paris. Weldon was furious when she discovered that Gounod had left, and she made many difficulties for him later, including holding on to manuscripts he had left at her house and publishing a tendentious and self-justifying account of their association. She later brought a lawsuit against him which effectively prevented him from coming back to Britain after May 1885.

===Later years===

The musical scene in France had altered considerably during Gounod&#x27;s absence. After the death of Berlioz in 1869, Gounod had been generally regarded as France&#x27;s leading composer. He returned to a France in which, though still well respected, he was no longer in the vanguard of French music. A rising generation, including members of the new Société Nationale de Musique such as Bizet, Emmanuel Chabrier, Gabriel Fauré and Jules Massenet, was establishing itself. He was not embittered, and was well disposed to younger composers, even when he did not enjoy their works. Of the later generation he was most impressed by Camille Saint-Saëns, seventeen years his junior, whom he is said to have dubbed &quot;the French Beethoven&quot;.

Resuming operatic composition, Gounod finished &quot;Polyeucte&quot;, on which he had been working in London, and during 1876 composed &quot;Cinq-Mars&quot;, a four-act historical drama set in the time of Cardinal Richelieu. The latter was staged first at the Opéra-Comique in April 1877, and had a mediocre run of 56 performances. &quot;Polyeucte&quot;, a religious subject close to the composer&#x27;s heart, did worse when it was given at the Opéra the following year. In the words of Gounod&#x27;s biographer James Harding, &quot;After Polyeucte had been martyred on twenty-nine occasions the box-office ruled that enough was enough. He was never resuscitated.&quot;

The last of Gounod&#x27;s operas, &quot;Le Tribut de Zamora&quot; (1881), ran for 34 nights, and in 1884 he made a revision of &quot;Sapho&quot;, which lasted for 30 performances at the Opéra. He reworked the role of Glycère, the deceitful villainess of the piece, with the image of Weldon in his mind: &quot;I dreamt of the model … who was terrifying in satanic ugliness&quot; Throughout these disappointments &quot;Faust&quot; continued to attract the public, and in November 1888 Gounod conducted the 500th performance at the Opéra.

Away from opera, Gounod wrote the large-scale &quot;Messe du Sacré-Coeur de Jésus&quot; in 1876 and ten other masses between then and 1893. His greatest popular successes in his later career were religious works, the two large oratorios &quot;La Rédemption&quot; (1882) and &quot;Mors et vita&quot; (1885), both composed for and premiered at the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival in England. The two were enthusiastically taken up by the British public and on the continent, and in their day were widely ranked with the oratorios of Handel and Mendelssohn. The Philharmonic Society in London unsuccessfully sought to commission a symphony from the composer in 1885 (the commission eventually went to Saint-Saëns); fragments of a third symphony exist from late in Gounod&#x27;s career, but are thought to date from a few years later.

Gounod lived his last years at Saint-Cloud, composing sacred music and writing his memoirs and essays. His oratorio &quot;Saint Francois d&#x27;Assise&quot; was completed in 1891. On 15 October 1893, after returning home from playing the organ for Mass at his local church, he suffered a stroke while working on a setting of the Requiem in memory of his grandson Maurice, who had died in infancy. After being in a coma for three days Gounod died on 18 October, at the age of 75.

A state funeral was held at L&#x27;église de la Madeleine, Paris, on 27 October 1893. Among the pallbearers were Ambroise Thomas, Victorien Sardou and the future French President Raymond Poincaré. Fauré conducted the music, which at Gounod&#x27;s wish was entirely vocal, with no organ or orchestral accompaniment. After the service, Gounod&#x27;s remains were taken in procession to the near Saint-Cloud, where they were interred in the family vault.

==Music==

Gounod is best known for his operas – in particular &quot;Faust&quot;. Celebrated during his lifetime, Gounod&#x27;s religious music became unfashionable in the 20th century and little of it is regularly heard. His songs, an important influence on later French composers, are less neglected, although only a few are well known. Michael Kennedy writes that Gounod&#x27;s music has &quot;considerable melodic charm and felicity, with admirable orchestration&quot;. He adds that Gounod was &quot;not really a master of the large and imposing forms, in this way perhaps being a French parallel to Sullivan&quot;. There is wide agreement among commentators that he was at his finest more often in the earlier decades of his career than later. Robert Orledge judges that in the 1850s and 1860s Gounod introduced to French opera a combination of &quot;tender, lyrical charm, consummate craftsmanship, and genuine musical characterization&quot;, but his later works tend to &quot;sentimentality and banality ... in his quest for inspired simplicity&quot;.

Cooper writes that as Gounod grew older he began to suffer from &quot;what might be described as the same &quot;cher grand maître&quot; complex as infected Hugo and Tennyson&quot;. Huebner observes that the fact that Gounod&#x27;s reputation began to wane even during his lifetime does not detract from his place among the most respected and prolific composers in France during the second half of the 19th century.

===Operas===
Gounod wrote twelve operas, in a variety of the genres then prevailing in France. &quot;Sapho&quot; (1851) was an early example of opéra lyrique, smaller-scale and more intimate than grand opera but through-composed, without the spoken dialogue of opéra comique. Berlioz wrote of it, &quot;Most of the choruses I found imposing and simple in accent; the whole third act seemed to me very beautiful ... But the quartet in the first act, the duet and trio in the second, where the passions of the principal characters break out with such force, absolutely revolted me&quot;. A more recent reviewer remarks on Gounod&#x27;s &quot;genuine talent for music-drama ... exercised in the Quartet of Act 1 where each character has an independent part, making effective counterpoint in dramatic as well as musical terms&quot;. Gounod revised the work in 1858 and again, more radically, in 1884, but it was never a success. The one fairly well known number from the score, Sapho&#x27;s &quot;O ma lyre immortelle&quot;, is a reworking of a song he had composed in 1841.

&quot;La Nonne sanglante&quot; (1854), a work on a larger scale than &quot;Sapho&quot;, suffers from a libretto that Huebner describes as an &quot;unhappy blend of historico-political grand opera and the supernatural&quot;. He observes that in the traditions of grand opera it features processions, ballets, large ensemble numbers, and &quot;a plot where the love interest is set against a more or less clearly drawn historical backdrop&quot;. Announcing a rare revival of the work in 2018, the Opéra-Comique described the score as &quot;refined, sombre, and labyrinthine&quot;. A reviewer praised its &quot;verve and imagination ... colourful and percussive music, well adapted to evoke the horror of the situations ... quite voluptuous in the arias (in a score that one can nevertheless find rather academic in parts)&quot;.

Cooper classes &quot;Le Médecin malgré lui&quot; (1858) as one of Gounod&#x27;s finest works, &quot;witty, quick-moving and full of life&quot;. In complete contrast to its predecessor, it is a three-act comedy, regarded as a masterpiece by Richard Strauss and Igor Stravinsky. Cooper says of the score that Gounod seems to have learned more from Mozart than from Rossini or Auber, and to have &quot;divined by instinct the great comic possibilities of what passed at that time for a ferociously &#x27;learned&#x27; style, namely counterpoint.&quot; The piece held its place in the repertory during the latter part of the 19th century, but by the time Sergei Diaghilev revived it in 1924 Gounod was out of fashion. In Stravinsky&#x27;s words, &quot;[Diaghilev&#x27;s] dream of a Gounod &#x27;revival&#x27; failed in the face of an indifferent and snobbish public who did not dare applaud the music of a composer not accepted by the avant-garde&quot;. For his revival Diaghilev commissioned Erik Satie to compose recitatives to replace the original spoken dialogue, and that version is sometimes used in the occasional modern productions of the piece, such as that by Laurent Pelly at the Grand Théâtre de Genève in 2016.
&quot;Faust&quot; (1859) appealed to the public not only because of its tunefulness but also for its naturalness. In contrast with grand operas by Gounod&#x27;s older contemporaries, such as Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; or Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell&quot;, Faust in its original 1859 form tells its story without spectacular ballets, opulent staging, grand orchestral effects or conventionally theatrical emotion. &quot;The charm of &quot;Faust&quot; lay in its naturalness, its simplicity, the sincerity and directness of its emotional appeal&quot; (Cooper). The authors labelled &quot;Faust&quot; &quot;a lyric drama&quot;, and some commentators find the lyrical scenes stronger than the dramatic and supernatural ones. Among the best known numbers from the piece are Marguerite&#x27;s &quot;Jewel&quot; song, the Soldiers&#x27; Chorus, Faust&#x27;s aria &quot;Salut! Demeure chaste et pure&quot; and Méphistophélès&#x27; &quot;Le Veau d&#x27;or&quot; and Sérénade. Another popular song is Valentin&#x27;s &quot;Avant de quitter ces lieux&quot;, which Gounod, rather reluctantly, wrote for the first London production, where the star baritone required an extra number. Among the popular numbers from the score is the ballet music, written when the Opéra – where a ballet interlude was mandatory – took over presentation of the work in 1869. The ballet makes full use of the Opéra&#x27;s large orchestral resources; it is now frequently omitted in live performances, particularly in productions outside France, but the ballet suite became a popular concert item, independent of the opera. The recitatives generally used instead of the original spoken dialogue were composed by Gounod in an early revision of the score.

Writing of &quot;Philémon et Baucis&quot;, Huebner comments that there is little dramatic music in the score and that most of the numbers are &quot;purely decorative accretions to the spoken dialogue&quot;. For the 1876 revival at the Opéra-Comique, which established the work in the repertory there until the Second World War, Gounod reduced it to two acts. For a revival by Diaghilev in 1924, the young Francis Poulenc composed recitatives to replace the spoken dialogue. The music critic Andrew Clements writes of &quot;La Colombe&quot; that it is not a profound work, but is &quot;well filled with the kind of ingratiating tunes that Gounod could turn out so effectively&quot;. Although &quot;La Reine de Saba&quot; was a failure, it contains three numbers that gained moderate popularity: the Queen&#x27;s big aria‚ &quot;Plus grand dans son obscurité&quot;, King Solomon&#x27;s &quot;Sous les pieds d&#x27;une femme&quot; and the tenor solo &quot;Faiblesse de la race humaine&quot;.

&quot;Mireille&quot; (1865) was a moderate success, and although it did not emulate &quot;Faust&quot; in becoming an international hit, it remained popular in France into the 20th century. The most famous number, the waltz-song &quot;O légère hirondelle&quot;, a favourite display piece for many coloratura sopranos, was written to order for the prima-donna of the Théâtre Lyrique a year after the premiere. Another popular number is Ourrias&#x27;s swaggering &quot;Si les filles d&#x27;Arles&quot; described by the critic Patrick O&#x27;Connor as an attempt by the composer to repeat the success of Méphistophélès&#x27; &quot;Veau d&#x27;or&quot; from &quot;Faust&quot;. Gounod revised the work, even giving it a happy ending, but in the 1930s Reynaldo Hahn and Henri Büsser prepared a new edition for the Opéra-Comique, restoring the work to its original tragic five acts.

Gounod&#x27;s last successful opera was &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; (1867). Gustav Kobbé wrote five decades later that the work had always been more highly regarded in France than elsewhere. He said that it had never been popular in England except as a vehicle for Adelina Patti and then Nellie Melba, and that in New York it had only featured regularly at the Metropolitan Opera when it was under the control of Maurice Grau in the late 19th-century. Some reviewers thought it inappropriate that Juliet was allotted a waltz song (&quot;Je veux vivre, dans ce rêve&quot;), but Romeo&#x27;s &quot;Ah! levè-toi, soleil&quot; was judged one of Gounod&#x27;s finest tenor arias. Although never as popular as &quot;Faust&quot;, &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; continues to hold the stage internationally. Gounod had no further success with new operas. His three attempts, &quot;Cinq-Mars&quot; (1877), &quot;Polyeucte&quot; (1878), and &quot;Le Tribut de Zamora&quot; (1881), were all taken off after brief runs, and have seldom been seen since.

===Orchestral and chamber music===

The two symphonies, in D major and E-flat major, cannot be precisely dated. The first was completed at some time before 1855 and the second by 1856. Like many other composers of the mid-19th-century Gounod found Beethoven&#x27;s shadow daunting when contemplating the composition of a symphony, and there was even a feeling among the French musical public that composers could write operas or symphonies but not both. The influence of Beethoven is apparent in Gounod&#x27;s two symphonies, and the musical scholar Roger Nichols and the composer&#x27;s biographer Gérard Condé also find a debt to Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Italian&quot; Symphony in the slow movement of the First. Gounod&#x27;s sometime pupil Bizet took the First as his model for his own Symphony in C (1855). Late in life Gounod started but did not complete a Third Symphony. A complete slow movement and much of a first movement survive. Other orchestral works include the &quot;Funeral March of a Marionette&quot; (1879), an orchestration of an 1872 solo piano piece.

The &quot;Petite Symphonie&quot; (1885), written for nine wind instruments, follows the classical, four-movement pattern, with a slow introduction to the sonata form first movement. The commentator Diether Stepphun refers to its &quot;cheerfully contemplative and gallant wit, with all the experience of human and musical maturity&quot;. Gounod&#x27;s Ave Maria gained considerable popularity. It consists of a descant superimposed over a version of the first prelude of Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;. In its original form it is for violin with piano; the words of the Hail Mary were added to the melody later.

===Religious music===
Gounod&#x27;s output of liturgical and other religious music was prolific, including 23 masses, more than 40 other Latin liturgical settings, more than 50 religious songs and part-songs, and seven cantatas or oratorios. During his lifetime his religious music was regarded in many quarters more highly than his most popular operas. Saint-Saëns wrote, &quot;When, in the far-distant future, the operas of Gounod shall have been received into the dusty sanctuary of the libraries, the Mass of St Cecilia, the &quot;Redemption&quot;, and &quot;Mors et Vita&quot;, will still endure&quot;. In the 20th century views changed considerably. In 1916, Gustave Chouquet and Adolphe Jullien wrote of &quot;a monotony and heaviness which must weary the best-disposed audience&quot;. In 1918, in a centenary tribute to Gounod, Julien Tiersot described &quot;La Rédemption&quot; and &quot;Mors et Vita&quot; as &quot;imbued with pure and elevated lyricism&quot;, but this view did not prevail. Other critics have referred to &quot;the ooze of the erotic priest&quot; and called the oratorios &quot;the height of nineteenth-century hypocritical piety&quot;.

Orledge judges the early masses as the best of Gounod&#x27;s religious music. He comments that the composer moved away from &quot;Palestrinian austerity&quot; towards &quot;a more fluid, operatic style&quot; in his &quot;Messe solennelle de Sainte Cécile&quot; (1855). He comments that in general Gounod&#x27;s work in the 1860s &quot;became more Italianate, while retaining its French attributes of precision, taste, and elegance&quot;.

===Songs===

Gounod&#x27;s songs are by far the most numerous of his compositions: he wrote more than a hundred French secular songs and thirty more in English or Italian for the British market. The songs come from every stage of his career, but most of the best are generally considered to be from the earlier years. Maurice Ravel called Gounod &quot;the true founder of the &quot;mélodie&quot; in France&quot;. The pianist and musical scholar Graham Johnson, quoting this, adds that although Berlioz might be thought to have a claim to that title, it was Gounod who brought the &quot;mélodie&quot; widespread popularity in France:

Johnson adds that Gounod brought to the &quot;mélodie&quot; &quot;those qualities of elegance, ingenuity, &quot;sensibilité&quot;, and a concern for literature which together constitute the classic qualities of French song&quot; in mélodies that display the composer&#x27;s &quot;melodic genius, his talent for creating long flowing lines (only surpassed by Fauré), and his instinct for the harmonic &quot;juste&quot;&quot;.

From his earliest period, during and just after his time as a Prix de Rome student, Gounod&#x27;s songs include some of his best, in the view of both Huebner and Johnson. Examples include &quot;Où voulez-vous aller?&quot; (words by Gautier, 1839) – which challenged comparison with Berlioz, who had already set the poem in his &quot;Les Nuits d&#x27;été&quot; – and &quot;Venice&quot; (Musset), 1842, described by Johnson as &quot;astonishingly evocative with its turbulent interludes painting that city&#x27;s ability both to intoxicate and disturb&quot;. Other early songs such as &quot;Le vallon&quot; and &quot;Le soir&quot; (both to words by Lamartine, c. 1840) demonstrate Gounod&#x27;s ability to cope with large-scale Romantic verse.

The songs of Gounod&#x27;s middle and later years are in the main judged less impressive. Johnson compares Gounod with Mendelssohn in terms of artistic decline, suggesting that their celebrity as establishment figures led them to adopt a style &quot;suitable for the pomposities of gigantic music festivals.&quot; Nevertheless, Johnson observes that some of the songs written during Gounod&#x27;s stay in England in the 1870s are excellent of their kind, such as &quot;Oh happy home&quot; (words by Edward Maitland, 1872), &quot;If thou art sleeping, maiden&quot; (Longfellow, 1872 or 1873) and &quot;The Worker&quot; (Frederic Weatherly, 1873). Gounod&#x27;s time in Britain also produced arrangements of Scottish folk songs, and settings of poetry by Wordsworth, Charles Kingsley, Thomas Hood, Byron, Shelley and Francis Palgrave.

==Legacy==
Although only a comparatively small amount of Gounod&#x27;s music endures in the regular musical repertoire, his influence on later French composers was important. In Cooper&#x27;s words, &quot;he was more than an individual composer: he was the voice of a deep and permanent strain in the French character ... [A] whole range of emotion, which had been voiceless before, had found in him its ideal expression, and his influence will perhaps never quite disappear for that reason&quot;. Cooper suggests that the two sides of Gounod&#x27;s music nature influenced later French composers as different as Fauré and Massenet, the first drawing on and refining Gounod&#x27;s classical purity and refinement, and the latter drawing on his romantic and voluptuous side (so much so that he was dubbed &quot;la fille de Gounod&quot;). Ravel&#x27;s comment on Gounod&#x27;s importance to &quot;mélodie&quot; is quoted above, and Debussy wrote, &quot;Gounod, for all his weaknesses, is essential … the art of Gounod represents a moment in French sensibility. Whether one wants to or not, that kind of thing is not forgotten&quot;.

<text>María Susana Giménez Aubert (born 29 January 1944), known as Susana Giménez (), is an Argentine TV host, actress, model and businesswoman. In 2012, she was considered the biggest celebrity in Argentine television by the media firm that publishes her eponymous magazine.

She is the host of &quot;Susana Giménez&quot;, a highly rated television variety show in Argentina, similar in format to those of Raffaella Carrà (in Italy and Spain) and Oprah Winfrey (in United States). In 1997, she was awarded with the Golden Martín Fierro Award, and in 2002 won the INTE Award for TV Hostess of the Year.
Since 2020, she lives in Uruguay.

==Early life==
Giménez was the daughter of María Luisa Sanders, of Irish descent, and Augusto Giménez Aubert, of Spanish descent. She had a hard childhood, tainted by her parents&#x27; separation. She studied in Quilmes, and graduated from La Anunciata Collegiate as a primary school teacher, a profession she never practised. Before becoming famous, for a couple of years Giménez worked as an executive secretary for a large factory.

==Career==
At 19 years old, she became a model, and made her name in a TV commercial for Cadum, a brand of French soap. Most of her subsequent film career was in adult-oriented comedies, acting opposite Alberto Olmedo, Jorge Porcel, and fellow &quot;vedette&quot; Moria Casán. Giménez has acted in over 30 films, including the cult film &quot;La Mary&quot;, and 10 plays. In 2008, Giménez launched her own magazine called &quot;Susana&quot;, published by &quot;La Nación&quot;. She is featured in the cover of every issue. She had her own fashion doll, and has endorsed two fragrances.

==Personal life==
In 1962, aged 18, she married businessman Mario Sarabayrouse. A year later she gave birth to her only daughter, Mercedes Sarabayrouse Giménez.

In 1974 she starred in &quot;La Mary&quot;, a film directed by Daniel Tinayre, where she met boxer Carlos Monzón, with whom she started a relationship that lasted two years. For 9 years she was in a relationship with actor Ricardo Darín, who was thirteen years younger. They ended up on good terms, remaining great friends. Susana would invite the actor as the first guest every year on her show.

In 1988 she married Huberto Roviralta, a polo player, whom she divorced in 1998. She had to pay ten million dollars to Roviralta as a divorce settlement.

From her daughter Mercedes, Giménez has two grandchildren, Lucía and Manuel. In private her family and friends call her &quot;Su&quot;, a practice that has been adopted by her fans.

<text>Although definitions of music vary wildly throughout the world, every known culture partakes in it, and it is thus considered a cultural universal. The origins of music remain highly contentious; commentators often relate it to the origin of language, with much disagreement surrounding whether music arose before, after or simultaneously with language. Many theories have been proposed by scholars from a wide range of disciplines, though none has achieved broad approval. Most cultures have their own mythical origins concerning the invention of music, generally rooted in their respective mythological, religious or philosophical beliefs.

The music of prehistoric cultures is first firmly dated to  BP of the Upper Paleolithic by evidence of bone flutes, though it remains unclear whether or not the actual origins lie in the earlier Middle Paleolithic period (300,000 to 50,000 BP). There is little known about prehistoric music, with traces mainly limited to some simple flutes and percussion instruments. However, such evidence indicates that music existed to some extent in prehistoric societies such as the Xia dynasty and the Indus Valley civilisation. Upon the development of writing, the music of literate civilizations—ancient music—was present in the major Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, Indian, Persian, Mesopotamian, and Middle Eastern societies. It is difficult to make many generalizations about ancient music as a whole, but from what is known it was often characterized by monophony and improvisation. In ancient song forms, the texts were closely aligned with music, and though the oldest extant musical notation survives from this period, many texts survive without their accompanying music, such as the &quot;Rigveda&quot; and the &quot;Shijing&quot; Classic of Poetry. The eventual emergence of the Silk Road and increasing contact between cultures led to the transmission and exchange of musical ideas, practices, and instruments. Such interaction led to the Tang dynasty&#x27;s music being heavily influenced by Central Asian traditions, while the Tang dynasty&#x27;s music, the Japanese &quot;gagaku&quot; and Korean court music each influenced each other.

Historically, religions have often been catalysts for music. The Vedas of Hinduism immensely influenced Indian classical music, and the Five Classics of Confucianism laid the basis for subsequent Chinese music. Following the rapid spread of Islam in the 7th century, Islamic music dominated Persia and the Arab world, and the Islamic Golden Age saw the presence of numerous important music theorists. Music written for and by the early Christian Church properly inaugurates the Western classical music tradition, which continues into medieval music where polyphony, staff notation and nascent forms of many modern instruments developed. In addition to religion or the lack thereof, a society&#x27;s music is influenced by all other aspects of its culture, including social and economic organization and experience, climate, and access to technology. Many cultures have coupled music with other art forms, such as the Chinese four arts and the medieval &quot;quadrivium&quot;. The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward musicians and composers all vary between regions and periods. Many cultures have or continue to distinguish between art music (or &#x27;classical music&#x27;), folk music, and popular music.

==Origins==

Music is regarded as a cultural universal, though definitions of it vary depending on culture and throughout history. As with many aspects of human cognition, it remains debated as to what extent the origins of music will ever be understood, with scholars often taking polarizing positions. The origin of music is often discussed alongside the origin of language, with the nature of their connection being the subject of much debate. However, before the mid-late 20th century, both topics were seldom given substantial attention by academics. Since the topic&#x27;s resurgence, the principal source of contention is divided into three perspectives: whether music began as a kind of proto-language (a result of adaptation) that led to language; if music is a spandrel (a phenotypic by-product of evolution) that was the result of language; or if music and language both derived from a common antecedent.

There is little consensus on any particular theory for the origin of music, which have included contributions from archaeologists, cognitive scientists, ethnomusicologists, evolutionary biologists, linguists, neuroscientists, paleoanthropologists, philosophers, and psychologists (developmental and social). Some of the most prominent theories are as follows:
* Music arose as an elaborate form of sexual selection, perhaps arising in mating calls. This theory, perhaps the first significant one on music&#x27;s origins, is generally credited to Charles Darwin. It first appeared in Darwin&#x27;s 1871 book &quot;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex&quot;, and has since been criticized as there is no evidence that either human sex is &quot;more musical&quot; thus no evidence of sexual dimorphism; there are currently no other examples of sexual selection that do not include considerable sexual dimorphism. Recent commentators, citing music&#x27;s use in other animals&#x27;s mating systems, have nonetheless propagated and developed Darwin&#x27;s theory; such scholars include Peter J.B. Slater, Katy Payne, Björn Merker, Geoffrey Miller and Peter Todd.
* Music arose alongside language, both of which supposedly descend from a &quot;shared precursor&quot;. The biologist Herbert Spencer was an important early proponent of this theory, as was the composer Richard Wagner, who termed the music and language&#x27;s shared ancestor as &quot;speech-music&quot;. Since the 21st-century, a number of scholars have supported this theory, particularly the archeologist Steven Mithen.
* Music arose to fulfill a practical need. Propositions include:
**To assist in organizing cohesive labor, first proposed by the economist Karl Bücher.
**To improve the ease and range of long-distance communication, first proposed by the musicologist Carl Stumpf.
**To enhance communication with the divine or otherwise supernatural, first proposed by the anthropologist Siegfried Nadel.
**To assist in &quot;coordination, cohesion and cooperation&quot;, particularly in the context of families or communities.
**To be a means for frightening off predators or enemies of some kind.
* Music had two origins, &quot;from speech (logogenic) and from emotional expression (pathogenic)&quot;, first proposed by the musicologist Curt Sachs. Reflecting on the diversity of music around the world, Sachs noted that some music confines to either a communicative or expressionistic form, suggesting that these aspects developed separately.
* Music presents sounds that are based on two primary origins: 1) the sounds heard by the fetus in the womb and 2) emotionally generated vocalizations, according to the theory of the emotional origins of music first proposed by David Teie. This theory accounts for musical elements found in all cultures, including pulse, meter, discreet single-frequency segments (notes), continuousness, and instruments that create resonance-enhanced periodic sounds. 

Many cultures have their own mythical origins on the creation of music. Specific figures are sometimes credited with inventing music, such as Jubal in Christian mythology, the legendary Shah Jamshid in Persian/Iranian mythology, the goddess Saraswati in Hinduism, and the muses in Ancient Greek mythology. Some cultures credit multiple originators of music; ancient Egyptian mythology associates it with numerous deities, including Amun, Hathor, Isis and Osiris, but especially Ihy. There are many stories relating to music&#x27;s origins in Chinese mythology, but the most prominent is that of the musician Ling Lun, who—on the orders of the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi)—invented bamboo flute by imitating the song of the mythical &quot;fenghuang&quot; birds.

==Prehistory==

In the broadest sense, prehistoric music—more commonly termed primitive music in the past—encompasses all music produced in preliterate cultures (prehistory), beginning at least 6 million years ago when humans and chimpanzees last had a common ancestor. Music first arose in the Paleolithic period, though it remains unclear as to whether this was the Middle (300,000 to 50,000 BP) or Upper Paleolithic (50,000 to 12,000 BP). The vast majority of Paleolithic instruments have been found in Europe and date to the Upper Paleolithic. It is certainly possible that singing emerged far before this time, though this is essentially impossible to confirm. The potentially oldest instrument is the Divje Babe Flute from the Divje Babe cave in Slovenia, dated to 43,000 and 82,000 and made from a young cave bear femur. Purportedly used by Neanderthals, the Divje Babe Flute has received extensive scholarly attention, and whether it is truly a musical instrument or an object formed by animals is the subject of intense debate. If the former, it would be the oldest known musical instrument and evidence of a musical culture in the Middle Paleolithic. Other than the Divje Babe Flute and three other doubtful flutes, there is virtually no surviving Middle Paleolithic musical evidence of any certainty, similar to the situation in regards to visual art. The earliest objects whose designations as musical instruments are widely accepted are bone flutes from the Swabian Jura, Germany, namely from the Geissenklösterle, Hohle Fels and Vogelherd caves. Dated to the Aurignacian (of the Upper Paleolithic) and used by Early European modern humans, from all three caves there are eight examples, four made from the wing bones of birds and four from mammoth ivory; three of these are near complete. Three flutes from the Geissenklösterle are dated as the oldest, BP.

Considering the relative complexity of flutes, it is likely earlier instruments existed, akin to objects that are common in later hunter and gatherer societies, such as rattles, shakers, and drums. The absence of other instruments from and before this time may be due to their use of weaker—and thus more biodegradable—materials, such as reeds, gourds, skins, and bark. A painting in the Cave of the Trois-Frères dating to BCE is thought to depict a shaman playing a musical bow.

Prehistoric cultures are thought to have had a wide variety of uses for music, with little unification between different societies. Music was likely of particular value when food and other basic needs were scarce. It is also probable that prehistoric cultures viewed music as intrinsically connected with nature, and may have believed its use influenced the natural world directly.

The earliest instruments found in prehistoric China are 12 &quot;gudi&quot; bone flutes in the modern-day Jiahu, Wuyang, Henan Province from BCE. The only instruments dated to the prehistoric Xia dynasty () are two &quot;qing&quot;, two small bells (one earthenware, one bronze), and a &quot;xun&quot;. Due to this extreme scarcity of surviving instruments and the general uncertainty surrounding most of the Xia, creating a musical narrative of the period is impractical. In the Indian subcontinent, the prehistoric Indus Valley civilisation (from BCE in its mature state) has archeological evidence that indicates simple rattles and vessel flutes were used, while iconographical evidence suggests early harps and drums also existed. An ideogram in the later IVC contains the earliest known depiction of an arched harp, dated sometime before 1800 BCE.

==Antiquity==
Following the advent of writing, literate civilizations are termed part of the ancient world, the first of which is Sumerian literature of Abu Salabikh (now Southern Iraq) of BCE. Though the music of Ancient societies was extremely diverse, some fundamental concepts arise prominently in virtually all of them, namely monophony, improvisation and the dominance of text in musical settings. Varying song forms were present in Ancient cultures, including China, Egypt, Greece, India, Mesopotamia, Rome, and the Middle East. The text, rhythm, and melodies of these songs were closely aligned, as was music in general, with magic, science, and religion. Complex song forms developed in later ancient societies, particularly the national festivals of China, Greece, and India. Later Ancient societies also saw increased trade and transmission of musical ideas and instruments, often shepherded by the Silk Road. For example, a tuning key for a &quot;qin&quot;-zither from 4th–5th centuries BCE China includes considerable Persian iconography. In general, not enough information exists to make many other generalizations about ancient music between cultures.

The few actual examples of ancient music notation that survive usually exist on papyrus or clay tablets. Information on musical practices, genres, and thought is mainly available through literature, visual depictions, and increasingly as the period progresses, instruments. The oldest surviving written music is the Hurrian songs from Ugarit, Syria. Of these, the oldest is the Hymn to Nikkal (hymn no. 6; h. 6), which is somewhat complete and dated to BCE. However, the Seikilos epitaph is the earliest entirely complete noted musical composition. Dated to the 2nd Century CE or later, it is an epitaph, perhaps for the wife of the unknown Seikilos.

===China===
====Shang and Zhou====

By the mid-13th century BCE, the Late Shang dynasty had developed writing, which mostly exists as divinatory inscriptions on the ritualistic oracle bones but also as bronze inscriptions. As many as 11 oracle script characters may refer to music to some extent, some of which could be iconographical representations of instruments themselves. The stone bells &quot;qing&quot; appears to have been particularly popular with the Shang ruling class, and while no surviving flutes have been dated to the Shang, oracle script evidence suggests they used ocarinas (&quot;xun&quot;), transverse flute (&quot;xiao&quot; and &quot;dizi&quot;), douple pipes, the mouthorgan (&quot;sheng&quot;), and maybe the pan flute (&quot;paixiao&quot;). Due to the advent of the bronze in 2000 BCE, the Shang used the material for bells—the &#x27; (鈴), &#x27; (鐃) and &quot;zhong&quot; (鐘)—that can be differentiated in two ways: those with or without a clapper and those struck on the inside or outside. Drums, which are not found from before the Shang, sometimes used bronze, though they were more often wooden (&quot;bangu&quot;). The aforementioned wind instruments certainly existed by the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BCE), as did the first Chinese string instruments: the &quot;qin&quot; (or &quot;guqin&quot;) and &quot;se&quot; zithers. The Zhou saw the emergence of major court ensembles and the well known Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng (after 433 BCE) contains a variety of complex and decorated instruments. Of the tomb, the by-far most notable instrument is the monumental set of 65 tuned &quot;bianzhong&quot; bells, which range five octaves requiring at least five players; they are still playable and include rare inscriptions on music.
Ancient Chinese instruments served both practical and ceremonial means. People used them to appeal to supernatural forces for survival needs, while pan flutes may have been used to attract birds while hunting, and drums were common in sacrifices and military ceremonies. Chinese music has always been closely associated with dance, literature and fine arts; many early Chinese thinkers also equated music with proper morality and governance of society. Throughout the Shang and Zhou music was a symbol of power for the Imperial court, being used in religious services as well as the celebration of ancestors and heroes. Confucius () formally designated the music concerned with ritual and ideal morality as the superior (; &quot;proper music&quot;), in opposition to (; &quot;vernacular/popular music&quot;), which included virtually all non-ceremonial music, but particularly any that was considered excessive or lascivious. During the Warring States Period when of Confucius&#x27;s lifetime, officials often ignored this distinction, preferring more lively music and using the older traditional solely for political means. Confucius and disciples such as Mencius considered this preference virtueless and saw ill of the leaders&#x27; ignorance of , a theory that held music was intrinsically connected to the universe. Thus, many aspects of Ancient Chinese music were aligned with cosmology: the 12 pitch shí-èr-lǜ system corresponded equally with certain weights and measurements; the pentatonic scale with the five ; and the eight tone classification of Chinese instruments of with the eight symbols of &quot;bagua&quot;. No actual music or texts on the performance practices of Ancient Chinese musicians survive. The Five Classics of the Zhou dynasty include musical commentary; the &quot;I Ching&quot; and &quot;Chunqiu&quot; Spring and Autumn Annals make references, while the &quot;Liji&quot; Book of Rites contains a substantial discussion (see the chapter &quot;Yue Ji&quot; Record of Music). While the &quot;Yue Jing&quot; Classic of Music is lost, the &quot;Shijing&quot; Classic of Poetry contains 160 texts to now lost songs from the Western Zhou period (1045–771).

====Qin and Han====

The Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE), established by Qin Shi Huang, lasted for only 15 years, but the purported burning of books resulted in a substantial loss of previous musical literature. The Qin saw the &quot;guzheng&quot; become a particularly popular instrument; as a more portable and louder zither, it meet the needs of an emerging popular music scene. During the Han dynasty (202 BCE – 220 CE), there were attempts to reconstruct the music of the Shang and Zhou, as it was now &quot;idealized as perfect&quot;. A Music Bureau, the , was founded or at its height by at least 120 BCE under Emperor Wu of Han, and was responsible for collecting folksongs. The purpose of this was twofold; it allowed the Imperial Court to properly understand the thoughts of the common people, and it was also an opportunity for the Imperial Court to adapt and manipulate the songs to suit propaganda and political purposes. Employing ceremonial, entertainment-oriented and military musicians, the Bureau also performed at a variety of venues, wrote new music, and set music to commissioned poetry by noted figures such as Sima Xiangru. The Han dynasty had officially adopted Confucianism as the state philosophy, and the theories became a dominant philosophy. In practice, however, many officials ignored or downplayed Confucius&#x27;s high regard for over music, preferring to engage in the more lively and informal later. By 7 BCE the Bureau employed 829 musicians; that year Emperor Ai either disbanded or downsized the department, due to financial limitations, and the Bureau&#x27;s increasingly prominent music which conflicted with Confucianism. The Han dynasty saw a preponderance of foreign musical influences from the Middle East and Central Asia: the emerging Silk Road led to the exchange of musical instruments, and allowed travelers such as Zhang Qian to relay with new musical genres and techniques. Instruments from said cultural transmission include metal trumpets and instruments similar to the modern oboe and oud lute, the latter which became the pipa. Other preexisting instruments greatly increased in popularity, such as the &quot;qing&quot;, panpipes, and particularly the &quot;qin&quot;-zither (or &quot;guqin&quot;), which was from then on the most revered instrument, associated with good character and morality.

===Greece===

Greek written history extends far back into Ancient Greece, and was a major part of ancient Greek theatre. In ancient Greece, mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons. Instruments included the most important wind instrument, the double-reed aulos, as well as the plucked string instrument, the lyre, especially the special kind called a kithara.

===India===

The principal sources on the music of ancient India are textual and iconographical; specifically, some theoretical treatises in Sanskrit survive, there are brief mentions in general literature and many sculptures of Ancient Indian musicians and their instruments exist. Ancient Sanskrit, Pali, and Prakrit literature frequently contains musical references, from the Vedas to the works of Kalidasa and the Ilango Adigal&#x27;s epic &quot;Silappatikaram&quot;. Despite this, little is known on the actual musical practices of ancient India and the information available forces a somewhat homogeneous perspective on the music of the time, even though evidence indicates that in reality, it was far more diverse.

The monumental arts treatise &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; is among the earliest and chief sources for Ancient Indian music; the music portions alone are likely from the Gupta period (4th century to 6th century CE).

===Persia and Mesopotamia===
====Up to the Achaemenid period====

In general, it is impossible to create a thorough outline of the earliest music in Persia due to a paucity of surviving records. Evidenced by BCE Elam depictions, arched harps are the first affirmation of Persian music, though it is probable that they existed well before their artistic depictions. Elamite bull lyres from have been found in Susa, while more than 40 small Oxus trumpets have been found in Bactria and Margiana, dated to the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex. The oxus trumpets seem to have had a close association with both religion and animals; a Zoroastrian myth in which Jamshid attract animals with the trumpet suggests that the Elamites used them for hunting. In many ways the earliest known musical cultures of Iran are strongly connected with those of Mesopotamia. Ancient arched harps () also exist in the latter and the scarcity of instruments makes it unclear as to which culture the harp originated. Far more bull lyres survive in Ur of Mesopotamia, notably the Bull Headed Lyre of Ur, though they are nearly identical to their contemporary Elamite counterparts. From the evidence in terracotta plaques, by the 2nd-century BCE the arched harp was displaced by the angular harps, which existed in 20-string vertical and nine-string horizontal variants. Lutes were purportedly used in Mesopotamia by at least 2300 BCE, but not until BCE do they appear in Iran, where they became the dominant string instruments of Western Iran, though the available evidence suggests its popularity was outside of the elite. The rock reliefs of Kul-e Farah show that sophisticated Persian court ensembles emerged in the 1st-century BCE, in the which the central instrument was the arched harp. The prominence of musicians in these certain rock reliefs suggests they were essential in religious ceremonies.

Like earlier periods, extremely little contemporary information on the music of the Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BCE) exists. Most knowledge on the Achaemenid musical culture comes from Greek historians. In his &quot;Histories&quot;, Herodotus noted that Achaemenid priests did not use aulos music in their ceremonies, while Xenophon reflected on his visit to Persia in the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;, mentioning the presence of many female singers at court. Athenaeus also mentions female singers when noting that 329 of them had been taken from the King of Kings Darius III by Macedonian general Parmenion. Later Persian texts assert that &quot;gōsān&quot; poet-musician minstrels were prominent and of considerable status in court.

====Parthian and Sasanian periods====
The Parthian Empire (247 BCE to 224 CE) saw an increase in textual and iconographical depictions of musical activity and instruments. 2nd century BCE Parthian &quot;rhuta&quot; (drinking horns) found in the ancient capital of Nisa include some of the most vivid depictions of musicians from the time. Pictorial evidence such as terracotta plaques show female harpists, while plaques from Babylon show panpipes, as well as string (harps, lutes and lyres) and percussion instruments (tambourines and clappers). Bronze statues from Dura-Europos depict larger panpipes and double aulos. Music was evidently used in ceremonies and celebrations; a Parthian-era stone frieze in Hatra shows a wedding where musicians are included, playing trumpets, tambourines, and a variety of flutes. Other textual and iconographical evidence indicates the continued prominence of &quot;gōsān&quot; minstrels. However, like the Achaemenid period, Greek writers continue to be a major source for information on Parthian music. Strabo recorded that the &quot;gōsān&quot; learned songs telling tales of gods and noblemen, while Plutarch similarly records the &quot;gōsān&quot; lauding Parthian heroes and mocking Roman ones. Plutarch also records, much to his bafflement, that &quot;rhoptra&quot; (large drums) were used by the Parthian army to prepare for war.
The Sasanian period (226–651 CE), however, has left ample evidence of music. This influx of Sasanian records suggests a prominent musical culture in the Empire, especially in the areas dominated by Zoroastrianism. Many Sassanian Shahanshahs were ardent supporters of music, including the founder of the empire Ardashir I and Bahram V. Khosrow II () was the most outstanding patron, his reign being regarded as a golden age of Persian music. Musicians in Khosrow&#x27;s service include Āzādvar-e Changi (or Āzād), Bamshad, the harpist Nagisa (Nakisa), Ramtin, Sarkash and Barbad, who was the most famous. These musicians were usually active as minstrels, which were performers who worked as both court poets and musicians; in the Sassanian Empire there was little distinction between poetry and music.
===Other Arab and African cultures===
The Western African Nok culture (modern-day Nigeria) existed from BCE and left a considerable amount of sculptures. Among these are depictions of music, such as a man who shakes two objects thought to be maracas. Another sculpture includes a man with his mouth opening (possibly singing) while there is also a sculpture of a man playing a drum.

==Post-classical era==
===Japanese &quot;gagaku&quot; music===

The imperial court of Japan developed &quot;gagaku&quot; ((); ) music, originating from the &quot;Gagakuryō&quot; imperial music academy established in 701 CE during the Asuka period. Though the word &quot;gagaku&quot; derives from the Chinese &quot;yayue&quot; music, the latter originally referred to Confucian ritual music, while &quot;gagaku&quot; extends to many genres, styles and instruments. In the tradition&#x27;s early history, the three main genres were &quot;wagaku&quot; (native Japanese music), &quot;sankangaku&quot; (music from the Three Kingdoms of Korea) and &quot;tōgaku&quot; (music from China&#x27;s Tang dynasty), as well as more minor genres such as &quot;toragaku&quot;, &quot;gigaku&quot;, and &quot;rin’yūgaku&quot;. Uniquely among Asian music of this time, there are numerous extant scores of &quot;gagaku&quot; music from the 8th to 11th centuries.

A major shift in &quot;gagaku&quot; music occurred in the 9th century, namely the development of a distinction between &quot;tōgaku&quot; and &quot;komagaku&quot; music. &quot;Tōgaku&quot; was a Chinese-influenced style, which combined with the &quot;rin’yūgaku&quot; tradition, referred to as &quot;Music of the Left&quot; (&quot;sahō&quot;). &quot;Komagaku&quot; was then referred to as &quot;Music of the Right&quot; (&quot;uhō&quot;), encompassing music influenced by both Korea (&quot;sankangaku&quot;) and Balhae (&quot;bokkaigaku&quot;). Though this division was prominent, it was not strict and the &quot;tōgaku&quot; and &quot;komagaku&quot; styles nonetheless interlaced and influenced each other. The long Heian period (794–1185) saw much patronage of &quot;gagaku&quot; music from the court, as it accompanied many festivals and celebrations. Numerous new genres emerged at this time, such as the &quot;saibara&quot; and &quot;rōei&quot; song forms. &quot;Gagaku&quot; ensembles consist of a wide variety of instruments and are the largest such formations in traditional Japanese music.

===Medieval Europe===

Modern scholars generally define &#x27;Medieval music&#x27; as the music of Western Europe during the Middle Ages, from approximately the 6th to 15th centuries. Music was certainly prominent in the Early Middle Ages, as attested by artistic depictions of instruments, writings about music, and other records; however, the only repertory of music which has survived from before 800 to the present day is the plainsong liturgical music of the Roman Catholic Church, the largest part of which is called Gregorian chant. Pope Gregory I, who gave his name to the musical repertory and may himself have been a composer, is usually claimed to be the originator of the musical portion of the liturgy in its present form, though the sources giving details on his contribution date from more than a hundred years after his death. Many scholars believe that his reputation has been exaggerated by legend. Most of the chant repertory was composed anonymously in the centuries between the time of Gregory and Charlemagne.

During the 9th century, several important developments took place. First, there was a major effort by the Church to unify the many chant traditions and suppress many of them in favor of the Gregorian liturgy. Second, the earliest polyphonic music was sung, a form of parallel singing known as organum. Third, and of the greatest significance for music history, notation was reinvented after a lapse of about five hundred years, though it would be several more centuries before a system of pitch and rhythm notation evolved having the precision and flexibility that modern musicians take for granted.

Several schools of polyphony flourished in the period after 1100: the St. Martial school of organum, the music of which was often characterized by a swiftly moving part over a single sustained line; the Notre Dame school of polyphony, which included the composers Léonin and Pérotin, and which produced the first music for more than two parts around 1200; the musical melting-pot of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, a pilgrimage destination and site where musicians from many traditions came together in the late Middle Ages, the music of whom survives in the Codex Calixtinus; and the English school, the music of which survives in the Worcester Fragments and the Old Hall Manuscript. Alongside these schools of sacred music a vibrant tradition of the secular song developed, as exemplified in the music of the troubadours, trouvères, and Minnesänger. Much of the later secular music of the early Renaissance evolved from the forms, ideas, and the musical aesthetic of the troubadours, courtly poets, and itinerant musicians, whose culture was largely exterminated during the Albigensian Crusade in the early 13th century.

Forms of sacred music which developed during the late 13th century included the motet, conductus, discant, and clausulae. One unusual development was the &quot;Geisslerlieder&quot;, the music of wandering bands of flagellants during two periods: the middle of the 13th century (until they were suppressed by the Church); and the period during and immediately following the Black Death, around 1350, when their activities were vividly recorded and well-documented with notated music. Their music mixed folk song styles with penitential or apocalyptic texts. The 14th century in European music history is dominated by the style of the &quot;ars nova&quot;, which by convention is grouped with the medieval era in music, even though it had much in common with early Renaissance ideals and aesthetics. Much of the surviving music of the time is secular, and tends to use the formes fixes: the ballade, the virelai, the lai, the rondeau, which correspond to poetic forms of the same names. Most pieces in these forms are for one to three voices, likely with instrumental accompaniment: famous composers include Guillaume de Machaut and Francesco Landini.

===Byzantine===
Prominent and diverse musical practices were present in the Byzantine Empire, which existed by 395 to 1453. Both sacred and secular music were commonplace, with sacred music frequently used in church services and secular music in many events including, ceremonies dramas, ballets, banquets, festivals and sports games. However, despite its popularity, secular Byzantine music was harshly criticized by the Church Fathers, particularly Jerome. Composers of sacred music, especially hymns and chants, are generally well documented throughout the history of Byzantine music. However, those before the reign of Justinian I are virtually unknown; the monks Anthimos, Auxentios and Timokles are said to have written troparia, but only the text to a single one by Auxentios survives. The first major form was the kontakion, of which Romanos the Melodist was the foremost composer. In the late 7th century the kanōn overtook the kontakion in popularity; Andrew of Crete became its first significant composer, and is traditionally credited as the genre&#x27;s originator, though modern scholars now doubt this attribution. The kañon reached its peak with the music of John of Damascus and Cosmas of Maiuma and later Theodore of Stoudios and Theophanes the Branded in the 8th and 9th centuries respectively. Composers of secular music are considerably less documented. Not until late in the empire&#x27;s history are composers known by name, with Joannes Koukouzeles, Xenos Korones and Joannes Glykys as the leading figures.

Like their Western counterparts of the same period, Byzantine composers were primarily men. Kassia is a major exception to this; she was a prolific and important composer of sticheron hymns and the only woman whose works entered the Byzantine liturgy. A few other women are known to have been composers, Thekla, Theodosia, Martha and the daughter of John Kladas (her given name is unrecorded). Only the latter has any surviving work, a single antiphon. Some Byzantine emperors are known to have been composers, such as Leo VI the Wise and Constantine VII.

==Early modern and modern periods==
===Indian classical music===

During the ancient and medieval periods, the classical music of the Indian subcontinent was a largely unified practice. By the 14th century, socio-political turmoil inaugurated by the Delhi Sultanate began to isolate Northern and Southern India, and independent traditions in each region began emerging. By the 16th-century two distinct styles had formed: the Hindustani classical music of the North and the Carnatic classical music of the South. One of the major differences between them is that the Northern Hindustani vein was considerably influenced by the Persian and Arab musical practices of the time. Carnatic music is largely devotional; the majority of the songs are addressed to the Hindu deities.

Indian classical music (marga) is monophonic and based on a single melody line or raga rhythmically organized through talas.

====Renaissance====


The beginning of the Renaissance in music is not as clearly marked as the beginning of the Renaissance in the other arts, and unlike in the other arts, it did not begin in Italy, but in northern Europe, specifically in the area currently comprising central and northern France, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The style of the Burgundian composers, as the first generation of the Franco-Flemish school is known, was at first a reaction against the excessive complexity and mannered style of the late 14th century &quot;ars subtilior&quot;, and contained clear, singable melody and balanced polyphony in all voices. The most famous composers of the Burgundian school in the mid-15th century are Guillaume Dufay, Gilles Binchois, and Antoine Busnois.

By the middle of the 15th century, composers and singers from the Low Countries and adjacent areas began to spread across Europe, especially into Italy, where they were employed by the papal chapel and the aristocratic patrons of the arts (such as the Medici, the Este, and the Sforza families). They carried their style with them: smooth polyphony which could be adapted for sacred or secular use as appropriate. Principal forms of sacred musical composition at the time were the mass, the motet, and the laude; secular forms included the chanson, the frottola, and later the madrigal.

The invention of printing had an immense influence on the dissemination of musical styles, and along with the movement of the Franco-Flemish musicians, contributed to the establishment of the first truly international style in European music since the unification of Gregorian chant under Charlemagne. Composers of the middle generation of the Franco-Flemish school included Johannes Ockeghem, who wrote music in a contrapuntally complex style, with varied texture and an elaborate use of canonical devices; Jacob Obrecht, one of the most famous composers of masses in the last decades of the 15th century; and Josquin des Prez, probably the most famous composer in Europe before Palestrina, and who during the 16th century was renowned as one of the greatest artists in any form. Music in the generation after Josquin explored increasing complexity of counterpoint; possibly the most extreme expression is in the music of Nicolas Gombert, whose contrapuntal complexities influenced early instrumental music, such as the canzona and the ricercar, ultimately culminating in Baroque fugal forms.

By the middle of the 16th century, the international style began to break down, and several highly diverse stylistic trends became evident: a trend towards simplicity in sacred music, as directed by the Counter-Reformation Council of Trent, exemplified in the music of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina; a trend towards complexity and chromaticism in the madrigal, which reached its extreme expression in the avant-garde style of the Ferrara School of Luzzaschi and the late century madrigalist Carlo Gesualdo; and the grandiose, sonorous music of the Venetian school, which used the architecture of the Basilica San Marco di Venezia to create antiphonal contrasts. The music of the Venetian school included the development of orchestration, ornamented instrumental parts, and continuo bass parts, all of which occurred within a span of several decades around 1600. Famous composers in Venice included the Gabrielis, Andrea and Giovanni, as well as Claudio Monteverdi, one of the most significant innovators at the end of the era.
Most parts of Europe had active and well-differentiated musical traditions by late in the century. In England, composers such as Thomas Tallis and William Byrd wrote sacred music in a style similar to that written on the continent, while an active group of home-grown madrigalists adapted the Italian form for English tastes: famous composers included Thomas Morley, John Wilbye and Thomas Weelkes. Spain developed instrumental and vocal styles of its own, with Tomás Luis de Victoria writing refined music similar to that of Palestrina, and numerous other composers writing for the new guitar. Germany cultivated polyphonic forms built on the Protestant chorales, which replaced the Roman Catholic Gregorian Chant as a basis for sacred music, and imported the style of the Venetian school (the appearance of which defined the start of the Baroque era there). In addition, Dutch and German composers, particularly Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, wrote enormous amounts of organ music, establishing the basis for the later Baroque organ style which culminated in the work of J.S. Bach. France developed a unique style of musical diction known as musique mesurée, used in secular chansons, with composers such as Guillaume Costeley and Claude Le Jeune prominent in the movement.

One of the most revolutionary movements in the era took place in Florence in the 1570s and 1580s, with the work of the Florentine Camerata, who ironically had a reactionary intent: dissatisfied with what they saw as contemporary musical depravities, their goal was to restore the music of the ancient Greeks. Chief among them were Vincenzo Galilei, the father of the astronomer, and Giulio Caccini. The fruits of their labors was a declamatory melodic singing style known as monody, and a corresponding staged dramatic form: a form known today as opera. The first operas, written around 1600, also define the end of the Renaissance and the beginning of the Baroque eras.

Music prior to 1600 was modal rather than tonal. Several theoretical developments late in the 16th century, such as the writings on scales on modes by Gioseffo Zarlino and Franchinus Gaffurius, led directly to the development of common practice tonality. The major and minor scales began to predominate over the old church modes, a feature which was at first most obvious at cadential points in compositions, but gradually became pervasive. Music after 1600, beginning with the tonal music of the Baroque era, is often referred to as belonging to the common practice period.

====Baroque====


The Baroque era took place from 1600 to 1750, as the Baroque artistic style flourished across Europe and, during this time, music expanded in its range and complexity. Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, polyphonic contrapuntal music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the medieval era). German, Italian, French, Dutch, Polish, Spanish, Portuguese, and English Baroque composers wrote for small ensembles including strings, brass, and woodwinds, as well as for choirs and keyboard instruments such as pipe organ, harpsichord, and clavichord. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the fugue, the invention, the sonata, and the concerto. The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era include Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, Johann Sebastian Bach, Arcangelo Corelli, François Couperin, Girolamo Frescobaldi, George Frideric Handel, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Claudio Monteverdi, Georg Philipp Telemann, Domenico Scarlatti and Antonio Vivaldi.

====Classical====


The music of the Classical period is characterized by homophonic texture, or an obvious melody with accompaniment. These new melodies tended to be almost voice-like and singable, allowing composers to actually replace singers as the focus of the music. Instrumental music therefore quickly replaced opera and other sung forms (such as oratorio) as the favorite of the musical audience and the epitome of great composition. However, opera did not disappear: during the classical period, several composers began producing operas for the general public in their native languages (previous operas were generally in Italian).

Along with the gradual displacement of the voice in favor of stronger, clearer melodies, counterpoint also typically became a decorative flourish, often used near the end of a work or for a single movement. In its stead, simple patterns, such as arpeggios and, in piano music, Alberti bass (an accompaniment with a repeated pattern typically in the left hand), were used to liven the movement of the piece without creating a confusing additional voice. The now-popular instrumental music was dominated by several well-defined forms: the sonata, the symphony, and the concerto, though none of these were specifically defined or taught at the time as they are now in music theory. All three derive from sonata form, which is both the overlying form of an entire work and the structure of a single movement. Sonata form matured during the Classical era to become the primary form of instrumental compositions throughout the 19th century.

The early Classical period was ushered in by the Mannheim School, which included such composers as Johann Stamitz, Franz Xaver Richter, Carl Stamitz, and Christian Cannabich. It exerted a profound influence on Joseph Haydn and, through him, on all subsequent European music. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was the central figure of the Classical period, and his phenomenal and varied output in all genres defines our perception of the period. Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert were transitional composers, leading into the Romantic period, with their expansion of existing genres, forms, and even functions of music.

====Romantic====

In the Romantic period, music became more expressive and emotional, expanding to encompass literature, art, and philosophy. Famous early Romantic composers include Schumann, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Bellini, Donizetti, and Berlioz. The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra, and in the role of concerts as part of urban society. Famous composers from the second half of the century include Johann Strauss II, Brahms, Liszt, Tchaikovsky, Verdi, and Wagner. Between 1890 and 1910, a third wave of composers including Grieg, Dvořák, Mahler, Richard Strauss, Puccini, and Sibelius built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex – and often much longer – musical works. A prominent mark of late 19th-century music is its nationalistic fervor, as exemplified by such figures as Dvořák, Sibelius, and Grieg. Other prominent late-century figures include Saint-Saëns, Fauré, Rachmaninoff, Franck, Debussy and Rimsky-Korsakov.

== 20th and 21st century ==


The 20th century saw a revolution in music listening as the radio gained popularity worldwide and new media and technologies were developed to record, edit and distribute music. Music performances became increasingly visual with the broadcast and recording of performances.

20th-century music brought new freedom and wide experimentation with new musical styles and forms that challenged the accepted rules of music of earlier periods. The invention of musical amplification and electronic instruments, especially the synthesizer, in the mid-20th century revolutionized classical and popular music, and accelerated the development of new forms of music.

As for classical music, two fundamental schools determined the course of the century: that of Arnold Schoenberg and that of Igor Stravinsky. However, other composers also had a notable influence. For example: Béla Bartók, Anton Webern, Dmitri Shostakovich, Olivier Messiaen, John Cage, Benjamin Britten, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Sofia Gubaidulina, Krzysztof Penderecki, Brian Ferneyhough, Kaija Saariaho.

The 20th century saw the unprecedented dissemination of popular music, that is, music with a wide appeal. The term has its roots in the music of the American Tin Pan Alley, a group of prominent musicians and publishers who began to emerge during the 1880s in New York City. Although popular music is sometimes known as &quot;pop music&quot;, the terms are not always interchangeable. Popular music refers to a variety of music genres that appeal to the tastes of a large segment of the population, whereas pop music usually refers to a specific genre &quot;within&quot; popular music. Popular music songs and pieces typically have easily singable melodies. The song structure of popular music commonly involves repetition of sections, with the verse and chorus or refrain repeating throughout the song and the bridge providing a contrasting and transitional section within a piece.

<doc id="87327" wikidata="Q221654" url="?curid=87327" title="Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle">
<text>The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is an expendable medium-lift launch vehicle designed and operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It was developed to allow India to launch its Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites into Sun-synchronous orbits, a service that was, until the advent of the PSLV in 1993, only commercially available from Russia. PSLV can also launch small size satellites into Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO).

Some notable payloads launched by PSLV include India&#x27;s first lunar probe Chandrayaan-1, India&#x27;s first interplanetary mission, Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan), India&#x27;s first space observatory, Astrosat and India&#x27;s first Solar mission, Aditya-L1.

PSLV has gained credibility as a leading provider of rideshare services for small satellites, owing to its numerous multi-satellite deployment campaigns with auxiliary payloads, usually ride-sharing along with an Indian primary payload. As of June 2022, PSLV has launched 345 foreign satellites from 36 countries. Most notable among these was the launch of PSLV-C37 on 15 February 2017, successfully deploying 104 satellites in Sun-synchronous orbit, tripling the previous record held by Russia for the highest number of satellites sent to space on a single launch, until 24 January 2021, when SpaceX launched the Transporter-1 mission on a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 143 satellites into orbit.

Payloads can be integrated in tandem configuration employing a Dual Launch Adapter. Smaller payloads are also placed on equipment deck and customized payload adapters.

== Development ==
Studies by the PSLV Planning group under S Srinivasan to develop a vehicle capable of delivering a 600 kg payload to a 550 km sun-synchronous orbit from SHAR began in 1978. Among 35 proposed configurations, four were picked; by November 1980, a vehicle configuration with two strap-ons on a core booster (S80) with 80 tonne solid propellant loading each, a liquid stage with 30 tonne propellant load (L30), and an upper stage called the Perigee-Apogee System (PAS) was being considered.

By 1981, confidence grew in remote sensing spacecraft development with the launch of Bhaskara-1, and the PSLV project objectives were upgraded to have the vehicle deliver a 1000 kg payload into a 900 km SSO. As technology transfer of Viking rocket engine firmed up, a new lighter configuration with the inclusion of a liquid powered stage was selected. Funding was approved in July 1982 for the finalized design, employing a single large S125 solid core as first stage with six 9 tonne strap-ons (S9) derived from the SLV-3 first stage, liquid fueled second stage (L33), and two solid upper stages (S7 and S2.) This configuration needed further improvement to meet the orbital injection accuracy requirements of IRS satellites, and hence, the solid terminal stage (S2) was replaced with a pressure fed liquid fueled stage (L1.8 or LUS) powered by twin engines derived from roll control engines of the first stage. Apart from increasing precision, liquid upper stage also absorbed any deviation in performance of solid third stage. The final configuration of PSLV-D1 to fly in 1993 was (6 × S9 + S125) + L37.5 + S7 + L2.

The inertial navigation systems are developed by ISRO Inertial Systems Unit (IISU) at Thiruvananthapuram. The liquid propulsion for the second and fourth stages of the PSLV as well as the Reaction control systems (RCS) are developed by the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) at Valiamala near Thiruvananthapuram, kerala. The solid propellant motors are processed at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SHAR) at Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, which also carries out launch operations. The aerodynamic characterization research was conducted at the National Aerospace Laboratories&#x27; 1.2m Trisonic Wind Tunnel Facility.

The PSLV was first launched on 20 September 1993. The first and second stages performed as expected, but an attitude control problem led to the collision of the second and third stages at separation, and the payload failed to reach orbit. After this initial setback, the PSLV successfully completed its second mission in 1994. The fourth launch of PSLV suffered a partial failure in 1997, leaving its payload in a lower than planned orbit. In November 2014, the PSLV had launched 34 times with no further failures. (Although launch 41: August 2017 PSLV-C39 was unsuccessful.)

PSLV continues to support Indian and foreign satellite launches especially for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. It has undergone several improvements with each subsequent version, especially those involving thrust, efficiency as well as weight. In November 2013, it was used to launch the Mars Orbiter Mission, India&#x27;s first interplanetary probe.

In June 2018, the Union Cabinet approved for 30 operational flights of the PSLV scheduled to take place between 2019 and 2024.

ISRO is working towards handing over the production and operation of PSLV to private industry through a joint venture. On 16 August 2019, NewSpace India Limited issued an invitation to tender for manufacturing PSLV entirely by private industries. On 5 September 2022, NewSpace India Limited signed a contract with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and Larsen &amp; Toubro led conglomerate for the production of five PSLV-XL launch vehicles after they won competitive bidding. Under this contract, they have to deliver their first PSLV-XL within 24 months and the remaining four vehicles every six months.

== Vehicle description ==
The PSLV has four stages, using solid and liquid propulsion systems alternately.

=== First stage (PS1) ===
The first stage, one of the largest solid rocket boosters in the world, carries of hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene-bound (HTPB) propellant and develops a maximum thrust of about . The diameter motor case is made of maraging steel and has an empty mass of .

Pitch and yaw control during first stage flight is provided by the Secondary Injection Thrust Vector Control (SITVC) System, which injects an aqueous solution of strontium perchlorate into the S139 exhaust divergent from a ring of 24 injection ports to produce asymmetric thrust. The solution is stored in two cylindrical aluminium tanks strapped to the core solid rocket motor and pressurised with nitrogen. Underneath these two SITVC tanks, Roll Control Thruster (RCT) modules with small bi-propellant (MMH/MON) liquid engine are also attached.

On the PSLV-G and PSLV-XL, first stage thrust is augmented by six strap-on solid boosters. Four boosters are ground-lit and the remaining two ignite 25 seconds after launch. The solid boosters carry or (for PSLV-XL configuration) propellant and produce and thrust respectively. Two strap-on boosters are equipped with SITVC for additional attitude control. The PSLV-CA uses no strap-on boosters.

First stage separation is aided by four pairs of retro-rockets installed on inter-stage (1/2L). During staging, these eight rockets help push away the spent stage away from second stage.

=== Second stage (PS2) ===
The second stage is powered by a single Vikas engine and carries of Earth store-able liquid propellantunsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) as fuel and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) as oxidiser in two tanks separated by a common bulkhead. It generates a maximum thrust of . The engine is gimbaled (±4°) in two planes to provide pitch and yaw control by two actuators, while roll control is provided by a Hot gas Reaction Control Motor (HRCM) that ejects hot gases diverted from gas generator of Vikas engine.

On inter-stage (1/2U) of PS2, there are two pairs of ullage rockets to maintain positive acceleration during PS1/PS2 staging and also two pairs of retro-rockets to help push away spent stage during PS2/PS3 staging.

Second stage also carries some quantity of water in a toroidal tank at its bottom. Water spray is used to cool hot gases from Vikas&#x27; gas generator to about 600 °C before entering turbopump. Propellant and water tanks of second stage are pressurized by Helium.

=== Third stage (PS3) ===
The third stage uses of HTPB solid propellant and produces a maximum thrust of . Its burn duration is 113.5 seconds. It has a Kevlar-polyamide fibre case and a submerged nozzle equipped with a flex-bearing-seal gimbaled nozzle with ±2° thrust vector for pitch and yaw control. Roll control is provided by the fourth stage reaction control system (RCS) during thrust phase as well as during combined-coasting phase under which burnt-out PS3 remains attached to PS4.

=== Fourth stage (PS4) ===
The fourth stage is powered by regeneratively cooled twin engines, burning monomethylhydrazine (MMH) and mixed oxides of nitrogen (MON). Each pressure fed engine generates thrust and is gimbaled (±3°) to provide pitch, yaw and roll control during powered flight. Coast phase attitude control is provided by six 50N RCS thrusters. The stage is pressurized by helium and carries to of propellant depending on the mission requirements. PS4 has three variants L1.6, L2.0 and L2.5 based on propellant tank capacity.

On PSLV-C29/TeLEOS-1 mission, the fourth stage demonstrated re-ignition capability for the first time which was used in many subsequent flights to deploy payloads in multiple orbits on a single campaign.

As a space debris mitigation measure, PSLV fourth stage gets passivated by venting pressurant and propellant vapour after achieving main mission objectives. Such passivation prevents any unintentional fragmentation or explosion due to stored internal energy.

The niobium alloy nozzle used on twin engines of fourth stage is expected to be replaced by lighter, silicon carbide coated carbon–carbon nozzle divergent. The new nozzle was hot tested at facilities of IPRC, Mahendragiri in March and April 2024. This substitution should increase payload capacity of PSLV by .

ISRO successfully completed 665-second hot test of 3D printed PS4 engine, produced by Wipro 3D through selective laser melting. A total of 19 weld joints were eliminated through this process while engine&#x27;s 14 components were reduced to one piece. It saved 60% of the production time and drastically decreased the amount of raw materials used per engine, from 565 kg to 13.7 kg of metal powder. 

==== PS4 stage as orbital platform ====

PS4 has carried hosted payloads like AAM on PSLV-C8, Rubin 9.1/Rubin 9.2 on PSLV-C14 and mRESINS on PSLV-C21. But now, PS4 is being augmented to serve as a long duration orbital platform after completion of primary mission. PS4 Orbital Platform (PS4-OP) will have its own power supply, telemetry package, data storage and attitude control for hosted payloads.

On PSLV-C37 and PSLV-C38 campaigns, as a demonstration PS4 was kept operational and monitored for over ten orbits after delivering spacecraft.

PSLV-C44 was the first campaign where PS4 functioned as independent orbital platform for short duration as there was no on-board power generation capacity. It carried KalamSAT-V2 as a fixed payload, a 1U CubeSat by Space Kidz India based on Interorbital Systems kit.

On PSLV-C45 campaign, the fourth stage had its own power generation capability as it was augmented with an array of fixed solar cells around PS4 propellant tank. The three payloads hosted on PS4-OP were the Advanced Retarding Potential Analyzer for Ionospheric Studies (ARIS 101F) by IIST, an experimental AIS payload by ISRO, and AISAT by Satellize. To function as orbital platform, fourth stage was put in spin-stabilized mode using its RCS thrusters.

On the PSLV-C53 campaign, the PS4-OP is referred to as the PSLV Orbital Experimental Module (POEM), and it hosted six payloads. POEM was the first PSLV fourth stage based orbital platform to be actively stabilised using Helium based cold gas thrusters after the primary mission and stage passivization.

==== PS4 on RLV-OREX ====
The Reusable Launch Vehicle Technology Demonstration program is an prototype spaceplane project currently being processed by ISRO. It is planned to use a GSLV, modified by replacing it&#x27;s Cryogenic Upper Stage(CUS) with the PS-4 as the RLV would not required the excess thrust created by the CUS.

=== Payload fairing ===

Payload fairing of PSLV, also referred as its &quot;Heatshield&quot; consists of a conical upper section with spherical nose-cap, a cylindrical middle section and a lower boat-tail section. Weighing , it has 3.2 meter diameter and 8.3 meter height. It has Isogrid construction and is made out of 7075 aluminum alloy with a 3 mm thick steel nose-cap. The two halves of fairing are separated using a pyrotechnic device based jettisoning system consisting of horizontal and lateral separation mechanisms. To protect the spacecraft from damage due to excessive acoustic loads during launch, the heatshield interior is lined with acoustic blankets.

== Variants ==
ISRO has envisaged a number of variants of PSLV to cater to different mission requirements. There are currently two operational versions of the PSLV — the core-alone (PSLV-CA) without strap-on motors, and the (PSLV-XL) version, with six extended length (XL) strap-on motors carrying 12 tonnes of HTPB based propellant each. These configurations provide wide variations in payload capabilities up to in LEO and in sun-synchronous orbit.

=== PSLV-G ===
The standard or &quot;Generic&quot; version of the PSLV, PSLV-G had four stages using solid and liquid propulsion systems alternately and six strap-on motors (PSOM or S9) with 9 tonne propellant loading. It had capability to launch to into sun-synchronous orbit. PSLV-C35 was the last operational launch of PSLV-G before its discontinuation.

=== PSLV-CA ===
The PSLV-CA, CA meaning &quot;Core Alone&quot;, model premiered on 23 April 2007. The CA model does not include the six strap-on boosters used by the PSLV standard variant but two SITVC tanks with Roll Control Thruster modules are still attached to the side of the first stage with addition of two cylindrical aerodynamic stabilizers. The fourth stage of the CA variant has less propellant when compared to its standard version. It currently has capability to launch to Sun-synchronous orbit.

=== PSLV-XL ===
PSLV-XL is the upgraded version of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle in its standard configuration boosted by more powerful, stretched strap-on boosters with 12 tonne propellant load. Weighing at lift-off, the vehicle uses larger strap-on motors (PSOM-XL or S12) to achieve higher payload capability. On 29 December 2005, ISRO successfully tested the improved version of strap-on booster for the PSLV. The first use of PSLV-XL was the launch of Chandrayaan-1 by PSLV-C11. The payload capability for this variant is to Sun-synchronous orbit.

=== PSLV-DL ===
PSLV-DL variant has only two strap-on boosters with 12 tonne propellant load on them. PSLV-C44 on 24 January 2019 was the first flight to use PSLV-DL variant of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. It is capable of launching to Sun-synchronous orbit.

=== PSLV-QL ===
PSLV-QL variant has four ground-lit strap-on boosters, each with 12 tonnes of propellant. PSLV-C45 on 1 April 2019 was the first flight of PSLV-QL. It has the capacity to launch to Sun-synchronous orbit.

=== PSLV-3S (concept) ===
PSLV-3S was conceived as a three-staged version of PSLV with its six strap-on boosters and second liquid stage removed. The total lift-off mass of PSLV-3S was expected to be 175 tonnes with capacity to place 500 kg in 550 km low Earth orbit.

== Launch profile ==
PSLV - XL:

* The PS1 ignites at T+0 providing 4846kN of thrust.
* Within T+1, 4 out of the 6 boosters ignite on ground, each producing 703 kN of thrust. 7658kN of total thrust is produced by the combined propulsion of the PSOMs and the PS1.
* At around T+23/26, the remaining 2 unlit boosters are air-lit bringing the rocket at its maximum thrust capacity.
* At T+1:10, the first 4 ground-lit PSOMs have depleted its propellant and now separates and falls down to the ocean. The remaining 2 PSOMs and the PS1 continue to burn.
* At T+1:35, the remaining 2 PSOMs complete its 70 seconds burn and separate, leaving the rocket in a Core Alone configuration.
* At T+1:50, the PS1 has completed its 110-second burn and it separates and the Vikas Engine inside the PS2 ignites.
* The second stage burns for around 130 seconds and around T+4 minutes, the second stages shuts off and separates.
* The third stage, which is a solid rocket booster, and burns 80 seconds and then coasts for the remainder of time and around T+8/10 minutes, it separates and the 4th stage ignites to give the rocket a final push into the orbit.
* This 4th stage burn is highly variable and depends on the mass and number of payloads and usually is around 500 seconds long. The 4th stage may shut off around T+16/18 minutes followed by the Payload Deployment.

<doc id="87328" wikidata="Q167545" url="?curid=87328" title="Happy Birthday to You">
<text>&quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot;, or simply &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;, is a song traditionally sung to celebrate a person&#x27;s birthday. According to the 1998 &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, it is the most recognized song in the English language, followed by &quot;For He&#x27;s a Jolly Good Fellow&quot;. The song&#x27;s base lyrics have been translated into at least 18 languages. The melody of &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; comes from the song &quot;Good Morning to All&quot;, which has traditionally been attributed to American sisters Patty and Mildred J. Hill in 1893, although the claim that the sisters composed the tune is disputed.

The song is in the public domain in the United States and the European Union. Warner Chappell Music had previously claimed copyright on the song in the US and collected licensing fees for its use; in 2015, the copyright claim was declared invalid and Warner Chappell agreed to pay back $14 million in licensing fees.

==History==
Patty Hill was a kindergarten principal in Louisville, Kentucky, developing teaching methods at the Little Loomhouse; her sister Mildred was a pianist and composer. The sisters used &quot;Good Morning to All&quot; as a song that young children would find easy to sing. The combination of melody and lyrics in &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; first appeared in print in 1912. None of the early appearances of the &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; lyrics included credits or copyright notices. The Summy Company registered a copyright in 1935, crediting authors Preston Ware Orem and Mrs. R. R. Forman. In 1988, Warner/Chappell Music purchased the company owning the copyright for 25 million, with the value of &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; estimated at 5 million. Warner claimed that the United States copyright would not expire until 2030 and that unauthorized public performances of the song were illegal unless royalties were paid. In February 2010, the royalty for a single use was 700. By one estimate, the song is the highest-earning single song in history. In the European Union, the copyright for the song expired on January 1, 2017.

The American copyright status of &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; began to draw more attention with the passage of the Copyright Term Extension Act in 1998. The Supreme Court upheld the Act in &quot;Eldred v. Ashcroft&quot; in 2003, and Associate Justice Stephen Breyer specifically mentioned &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; in his dissenting opinion. American law professor Robert Brauneis extensively researched the song and concluded in 2010 &quot;it is almost certainly no longer under copyright.&quot; Good Morning to You Productions sued Warner/Chappell for falsely claiming copyright to the song in 2013. In September 2015, a federal judge declared that the Warner/Chappell copyright claim was invalid, ruling that the copyright registration applied only to a specific piano arrangement of the song and not to its lyrics and melody. In 2016, Warner/Chappell settled for $14 million, and the court declared that &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; was in the public domain.

==Lyrics==

=== &quot;Happy birthday to you&quot; ===

The person whose birthday is being celebrated is filled in for &quot;[NAME]&quot;.

Since the syllable lengths and scansion of people&#x27;s names may vary, the measure that includes the [NAME] invocation is traditionally notated with a fermata to adapt the meter.

===Lyrics with melody===

===Traditional variations===

Among English-speakers, it is traditional at a birthday party for the guests celebrating the birthday to sing the song &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; to the birthday person, often when presenting a birthday cake. After the song is sung, party guests sometimes add wishes like &quot;and many more!&quot; expressing the hope that the birthday person will enjoy a long life. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and most of the Commonwealth, immediately after &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; has been sung, it is traditional for one of the guests to lead with &quot;Hip hip ...&quot; and then for all of the other guests to join in and say &quot;... hooray!&quot;. This cheer is normally given three times.

In regions of America and Canada, especially at young children&#x27;s birthdays, immediately after &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; has been sung, it is not uncommon for the singers to segue into &quot;How old are you now? How old are you now? How old are you now, how old are you now?&quot; and then count up: &quot;Are you one? Are you two? Are you ...&quot; until they reach the right age or often, instead of counting, &quot;and many more!&quot; for those who are older.

== Copyright status ==

The music and lyrics are in the public domain in the European Union and the United States. The copyright expired in the European Union on January 1, 2017. A U.S. federal court ruled in 2016 that Warner and Chappell&#x27;s copyright claim was invalid and there was no other claim to copyright.

&quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; dates from the late 19th century, when sisters Patty and Mildred J. Hill introduced the song &quot;Good Morning to All&quot; to Patty&#x27;s kindergarten class in Kentucky. They published the tune in their 1893 songbook &quot;Song Stories for the Kindergarten&quot; with Chicago publisher Clayton F. Summy. Kembrew McLeod stated that the Hill sisters likely copied the tune and lyrical idea from other popular and similar nineteenth-century songs, including Horace Waters&#x27; &quot;Happy Greetings to All&quot; from 1858, &quot;Good Night to You All&quot;, also from 1858, &quot;A Happy New Year to All&quot; from 1875, and &quot;A Happy Greeting to All&quot;, published 1885. However, U.S. law professor Robert Brauneis disputes this, noting that these earlier songs had quite different melodies.

The complete text of &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; first appeared in print as the final four lines of Edith Goodyear Alger&#x27;s poem &quot;Roy&#x27;s Birthday&quot;, published in &quot;A Primer of Work and Play&quot;, copyrighted by D. C. Heath in 1901, with no reference to the words being sung. The first book including &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; lyrics set to the tune of &quot;Good Morning to All&quot; that bears a date of publication is &quot;The Elementary Worker and His Work&quot;, from 1911, but earlier references exist to a song called &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot;, including an article from 1901 in the &quot;Inland Educator and Indiana School Journal&quot;. In 1924, Robert Coleman included &quot;Good Morning to All&quot; in a songbook with the birthday lyrics as a second verse. Coleman also published &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; in &quot;The American Hymnal&quot; in 1933. &quot;Children&#x27;s Praise and Worship&quot; published the song in 1928, edited by Byers, Byrum, and Koglin.

The Summy Company, publisher of &quot;Good Morning to All&quot;, copyrighted piano arrangements by Preston Ware Orem and a second verse by Mrs. R. R. Forman. This served as the legal basis for the claim that Summy Company legally registered the copyright for the song, as well as the later renewal of these copyrights.

Summy Company became the Summy–Birchard Company in 1957, and this became a division of Birch Tree Group Limited in 1970. Warner/Chappell Music acquired Birch Tree Group Limited in 1988 for 25 million. The company continued to insist that one could not sing the &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; lyrics for profit without paying royalties; in 2008, Warner collected about 5,000 per day (2 million per year) in royalties for the song. Warner/Chappell claimed copyright for every use in film, television, radio, and anywhere open to the public, and for any group where a substantial number of those in attendance were not family or friends of the performer. Brauneis cited problems with the song&#x27;s authorship and the notice and renewal of the copyright, and concluded: &quot;It is almost certainly no longer under copyright.&quot;

In the European Union, copyright lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years. Patty Hill died in 1946 as the last surviving author, so the copyright expired in these countries on January 1, 2017.

=== 2013 lawsuit ===
On June 13, 2013, documentary filmmaker Jennifer Nelson filed a putative class action suit in federal court for the Southern District of New York against Warner/Chappell in the name of her production company Good Morning to You Productions. She had paid 1,500 to secure the rights as part of a documentary that she was making about the song and its history. Her complaint relied heavily on Brauneis&#x27;s research, and sought the return of her money and all royalties collected by the company from other filmmakers since 2009. A week later, &quot;Rupa Marya v. Warner Chappell Music Inc&quot; was filed in the Central District of California. Five weeks later, Nelson refiled the case there, and the cases were combined. In April 2014, Warner&#x27;s motion to dismiss had been denied without prejudice, and discovery began under an agreed plan with respect to Claim One, declaratory judgment as to whether &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; was in the public domain. The court was expected to rule on the motion for summary judgment as to the merits issues on Claim One. A jury trial was requested.

Nelson&#x27;s attorneys Betsy Manifold and Mark Rifkin presented new evidence on July 28, 2015, one day before a scheduled ruling, which they argued was conclusive proof that the song was in the public domain, &quot;thus making it unnecessary for the Court to decide the scope or validity of the disputed copyrights, much less whether Patty Hill abandoned any copyright she may have had to the lyrics&quot;. They had been given access to documents previously held back from them by Warner/Chappell, which included a copy of the 15th edition of &quot;The Everyday Song Book&quot; published in 1927. The book contained &quot;Good Morning and Happy Birthday&quot;, but the copy was blurry, obscuring a line of text below the title. Manifold and Rifkin located a clearer copy of an edition published in 1922 that also contained the &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; lyrics. The previously obscured line was revealed to be the credit &quot;Special permission through courtesy of The Clayton F Summy Co.&quot; Manifold and Rifkin argued that the music and lyrics were published without a valid copyright notice as was required at the time, so &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; was in the public domain.

Warner/Chappell disputed the evidence, arguing that, unless there was &quot;necessary authorization from the copyright owner&quot;, the &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; lyrics and sheet music would still be subject to common law copyright as an unpublished work, and that it was unknown whether the &quot;special permission&quot; from the Summy Company covered &quot;Good Morning to All&quot;, &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;, or both, thus alleging that the publication in &quot;The Everyday Song Book&quot; was unauthorized. The company also argued that it was not acting in bad faith in withholding the evidence of the 1927 publication.

On September 22, 2015, federal judge George H. King ruled that the Warner/Chappell copyright claim over the lyrics was invalid. The 1935 copyright held by Warner/Chappell applied only to a specific piano arrangement of the song, not the lyrics or melody. The court held that the question of whether the 1922 and 1927 publications were authorized, thus placing the song in the public domain, presented questions of fact that would need to be resolved at trial. However, Warner/Chappell had failed to prove that it actually had ever held a copyright to the lyrics, so the court was able to grant summary judgment to the plaintiffs, thus resolving the case.

Some initial news sources characterized the decision as ruling that the song was in the public domain, but the decision did not go so far, holding only that Warner/Chappell did not prove they owned the copyright. However, as there were no other claimants to the copyright, and the copyright to the melody had long ago expired, the plaintiffs suggested that the song was &quot;de facto&quot; in the public domain. Also, the judge ruled that the song was not copyrighted by Summy Co., who had written in the song book, &quot;Special permission through courtesy of the Clayton F. Summy Co.&quot; Since there was no evidence Summy Co. had copyright on the song, the song is still considered to be in the public domain.

Before the lawsuit, Warner/Chappell had been earning $2 million a year licensing the song for commercial use, with a notable example the $5,000 paid by the filmmakers of the 1994 documentary &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; in order to safely distribute the film. On February 8, 2016, Warner/Chappell agreed to pay a settlement of $14 million to those who had licensed the song, and would allow a final judgment declaring the song to be in the public domain, with a final hearing scheduled in March 2016. On June 28, 2016, the final settlement was officially granted and the court declared that the song was in the public domain. The following week, Nelson&#x27;s short-form documentary &quot;Happy Birthday: My Campaign to Liberate the People&#x27;s Song&quot; was published online by &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

In the wake of their success, the lawyers involved in the &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; lawsuit filed similar lawsuits regarding &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; and &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;.

==Public performances==

One of the most famous performances of &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; was Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s rendition to US President John F. Kennedy in May 1962. Another notable use was by comedy pianist Victor Borge, who played the song in the styles of various composers, or would begin playing &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot;, smoothly transitioning into the song.

The Beatles recorded &quot;Happy Birthday Dear Saturday Club&quot; for the BBC&#x27;s radio programme&#x27;s fifth anniversary. This recording is included on the compilation album &quot;On Air – Live at the BBC Volume 2&quot;, released in 2013.

In the 1987 documentary &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot; about the U.S. civil rights movement, there was a birthday party scene in which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s discouragement began to lift. After its initial release, the film was unavailable for sale or broadcast for many years because of the cost of clearing many copyrights, of which &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; was one. Grants in 2005 for copyright clearances allowed PBS to rebroadcast the film.

In 2010, the Western classical music conductor Zubin Mehta conducted the orchestra to play variations of &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; in the styles of various Western classical music composers, including Wagner, Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, and in the Viennese, New Orleans and Hungarian composition styles.

<doc id="87332" wikidata="Q10729647" url="?curid=87332" title="Alf and Alfhild">
<text>According to the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, Alfhild, daughter of the Geatish king Siward, was a shieldmaiden who had her own fleet of longships with crews of young female pirates and raided along the coasts of the Baltic Sea.

As a young princess, Alfhild&#x27;s chamber was guarded by a lizard and a snake, which scared away unworthy suitors. A Danish prince named Alf, also of Geatish descent, came to Geatland and defeated the animal guards. But Alfhild, advised by her mother, fled from Alf dressed as a man, and she became a shield maiden.

Alf and his Scanian comrade, Borgar, together with their Danish sea-warriors, searched for and eventually found Alfhild and her fleet by the coast of southern Finland. After some deadly fighting aboard the ships, Alfhild&#x27;s helmet was knocked off, and she was recognised. Alf and Borgar ordered their men to stop fighting, and Alf embraced Alfhild, happy to finally have found her. She then decided to lay off her warrior clothes and follow Alf to Denmark, where they got married.

Some years later, in a war fought against a revolting Danish clan, Alf and his brothers and their father king Sigar were killed. Only Alf&#x27;s and Alfhild&#x27;s daughter Gurid had survived of the royal family. After being queen for a while, Gurid married one of Borgar&#x27;s sons, Halfdan, and they had a son named Harald, who became the new king of Denmark.

==Context==
According to the details in the saga, this would have taken place in the 5th century.

The account in Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; Gesta Danorum is the original story of Alf and Alfhild, based on one of the old folktales or songs he gathered for his work.

==In popular culture==
There are some variations to the story in later popular culture. (Other spellings: &quot;Alwilda, Alvilda, Alvild, Alvilde, Alfhilda, Avilda, Alvida, Altilda, Ælfhild&quot;).

During the 1800s, Alfhild/Alwilda was a popular subject for scrimshaw carved by members of whaling crews.

Here, under the name of Alvida, she&#x27;s figuring in a modern Dutch musical.

The story about Alf And Alfhild has also been made into Italian operas.

Italian poet Torquato Tasso writes his most famous tragedy on her story, called &quot;Il re Torrismondo&quot;, where Alvida is promised in marriage to the king of Sweden, Germondo, but falls in love with Torrismondo, so she decides to commit suicide in order not to choose between love and honor.

In 1686, &quot;&quot;L&#x27;Amazzone Corsara, ovvero L&#x27;Alvilda, regina de Goti&quot;,&quot; by Carlo Pallavicino.

In 1731, &quot;&quot;Alvilda regina de&#x27; Goti&quot;,&quot; by Antonio Vivaldi.

<doc id="87334" wikidata="Q214267" url="?curid=87334" title="Prophecy">
<text>In religion, mythology, and fiction, a prophecy is a message that has been communicated to a person (typically called a &quot;prophet&quot;) by a supernatural entity. Prophecies are a feature of many cultures and belief systems and usually contain divine will or law, or preternatural knowledge, for example of future events. They can be revealed to the prophet in various ways depending on the religion and the story, such as visions, or direct interaction with divine beings in physical form. Stories of prophetic deeds sometimes receive considerable attention and some have been known to survive for centuries through oral tradition or as religious texts.

==Etymology==
The English noun &quot;prophecy&quot;, in the sense of &quot;function of a prophet&quot; appeared from about 1225, from Old French &quot;profecie&quot; (12th century), and from &quot;prophetia&quot;, Greek &quot;propheteia&quot; &quot;gift of interpreting the will of God&quot;, from Greek &quot;prophetes&quot; (see prophet). The related meaning, &quot;thing spoken or written by a prophet&quot;, dates from 1300, while the verb &quot;to prophesy&quot; is recorded by 1377.

==Definitions==

* Maimonides suggested that &quot;prophecy is, in truth and reality, an emanation sent forth by Divine Being through the medium of the Active Intellect, in the first instance to man&#x27;s rational faculty, and then to his imaginative faculty&quot;.
* The views of Maimonides closely relate to the definition by Al-Fârâbî, who developed the theory of prophecy in Islam.
* Much of the activity of Old Testament prophets involved conditional warnings rather than immutable futures. A summary of a standard Old Testament prophetic formula might run: Repent of sin X and turn to righteousness, otherwise consequence Y will occur.
* Saint Paul emphasizes edification, exhortation and comfort in a definition of prophesying.
* The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; defines a Christian conception of prophecy as &quot;understood in its strict sense, it means the foreknowledge of future events, though it may sometimes apply to past events of which there is no memory, and to present hidden things which cannot be known by the natural light of reason&quot;.
* According to Western esotericist Rosemary Guiley, clairvoyance has been used as an adjunct to &quot;divination, prophecy, and magic&quot;.
*From a skeptical point of view, a Latin maxim exists: &quot;prophecy written after the fact&quot; (&quot;vaticinium ex eventu&quot;). The Jewish Torah already deals with the topic of the false prophet (Deuteronomy 13:2-6, 18:20-22).

==In religion==

===Baháʼí Faith===

In 1863, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, claimed to have been the promised messianic figure of all previous religions, and a Manifestation of God, a type of prophet in the Baháʼí writings that serves as intermediary between the divine and humanity and who speaks with the voice of a God. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh claimed that, while being imprisoned in the Siyah-Chal in Iran, he underwent a series of mystical experiences including having a vision of the &quot;Maid of Heaven&quot; who told him of his divine mission, and the promise of divine assistance; In Baháʼí belief, the &quot;Maid of Heaven&quot; is a representation of the divine.

===Buddhism===
The &quot;Haedong Kosung-jon&quot; (Biographies of High Monks) records that King Beopheung of Silla desired to promulgate Buddhism as the state religion. However, officials in his court opposed him. In the fourteenth year of his reign, Beopheung&#x27;s &quot;Grand Secretary&quot;, Ichadon, devised a strategy to overcome court opposition. Ichadon schemed with the king, convincing him to make a proclamation granting Buddhism official state sanction using the royal seal. Ichadon told the king to deny having made such a proclamation when the opposing officials received it and demanded an explanation. Instead, Ichadon would confess and accept the punishment of execution, for what would quickly be seen as a forgery. Ichadon prophesied to the king that at his execution a wonderful miracle would convince the opposing court faction of Buddhism&#x27;s power. 

Ichadon&#x27;s scheme went as planned, and the opposing officials took the bait. When Ichadon was executed on the 15th day of the 9th month in 527, his prophecy was fulfilled; the earth shook, the sun was darkened, beautiful flowers rained from the sky, his severed head flew to the sacred Geumgang Mountains, and milk instead of blood sprayed 100 feet in the air from his beheaded corpse. The omen was accepted by the opposing court officials as a manifestation of heaven&#x27;s approval, and Buddhism was made the state religion in 527.

===Christianity===

According to Walter Brueggemann, the task of prophetic (Christian) ministry is to nurture, nourish and evoke a consciousness and perception alternative to the consciousness and perception of the dominant culture. A recognized form of Christian prophecy is the &quot;prophetic drama&quot; which Frederick Dillistone describes as a &quot;metaphorical conjunction between present situations and future events&quot;.

==== Later Christianity ====
In his &quot;Dialogue with Trypho&quot;, Justin Martyr argued that prophets were no longer among Israel but were in the Church. &quot;The Shepherd of Hermas&quot;, written around the mid-2nd century, describes the way prophecy was being used within the church of that time. Irenaeus confirms the existence of such spiritual gifts in his &quot;Against Heresies&quot;. Although some modern commentators claim that Montanus was rejected because he claimed to be a prophet, a careful examination of history shows that the gift of prophecy was still acknowledged during the time of Montanus, and that he was controversial because of the manner in which he prophesied and the doctrines he propagated.

Prophecy and other spiritual gifts were somewhat rarely acknowledged throughout church history and there are few examples of the prophetic and certain other gifts until the Scottish Covenanters like Prophet Peden and George Wishart. From 1904 to 1906, the Azusa Street Revival occurred in Los Angeles, California and is sometimes considered the birthplace of Pentecostalism. This revival is well known for the &quot;speaking in tongues&quot; that occurred there. Some participants of the Azusa Street Revival are claimed to have prophesied. Pentecostals believe prophecy and certain other gifts are once again being given to Christians. The Charismatic Movement also accepts spiritual gifts like speaking in tongues and prophecy.

The Seventh-day Adventist Church is a denomination that traces its history to the Millerite Movement and the Great Disappointment. Seventh-day Adventists &quot;accept the biblical teaching of spiritual gifts and believe that the gift of prophecy is one of the identifying marks of the remnant church.&quot; The church also believes Ellen G. White to be a prophet and that her writings are divinely inspired.

Since 1972, the neo-Pentecostal Church of God Ministry of Jesus Christ International has expressed a belief in prophecy. The church claims this gift is manifested by one person (the prophesier) laying their hands on another person, who receives an individual message said by the prophesier. Prophesiers are believed to be used by the Holy Ghost as instruments through whom their God expresses his promises, advice and commandments. The church claims people receive messages about their future, in the form of promises given by their God and expected to be fulfilled by divine action.

==== Apostolic-Prophetic Movement ====


In the Apostolic-Prophetic Movement, a prophesy is simply a word delivered under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit that accurately communicates God&#x27;s &quot;thoughts and intention&quot;.

The Apostolic Council of Prophetic Elders was a council of prophetic elders co-convened by C. Peter Wagner and Cindy Jacobs that included: Beth Alves, Jim Gool, Chuck Pierce, Mike and Cindy Jacobs, Bart Pierces, John and Paula Sanford, Dutch Sheets, Tommy Tenny, Heckor Torres, Barbara Wentroble, Mike Bickle, Paul Cain, Emanuele Cannistraci, Bill Hamon, Kingsley Fletcher, Ernest Gentile, Jim Laffoon, James Ryle, and Gwen Shaw.

====Latter Day Saint movement====
The Latter Day Saint movement maintains that its first prophet, Joseph Smith, was visited by God and Jesus Christ in 1820. The Latter Day Saints further claims that God communicated directly with Joseph Smith on many subsequent occasions, and that following the death of Joseph Smith God has continued to speak through subsequent prophets. Joseph Smith claims to have been led by an angel to a large hill in upstate New York, where he was shown an ancient manuscript engraved on plates of gold metal. Joseph Smith claimed to have translated this manuscript into modern English under divine inspiration by the gift and power of God, and the publication of this translation are known as the Book of Mormon.

Following Smith&#x27;s murder, there was a succession crisis that resulted in a great schism. The majority of Latter-day Saints believing Brigham Young to be the next prophet and following him out to Utah, while a minority returned to Missouri with Emma Smith, believing Joseph Smith Junior&#x27;s son, Joseph Smith III, to be the next legitimate prophet (forming the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, now the Community of Christ). Since even before the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, there have been numerous separatist Latter Day Saint sects that have splintered from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. To this day, there are an unknown number of organizations within the Latter Day Saint movement, each with their own proposed prophet.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is the largest Latter Day Saint body. The current Prophet/President of the LDS Church is Russell M. Nelson. The church has, since Joseph Smith&#x27;s death on June 27, 1844, held a belief that the president of their church is also a literal prophet of God. The church also maintains that further revelations claimed to have been given through Joseph Smith are published in the Doctrine and Covenants, one of the Standard Works. Additional revelations and prophecies outside the Standard Works, such as Joseph Smith&#x27;s &quot;White Horse Prophecy&quot;, concerning a great and final war in the United States before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, can be found in other church published works.

===Islam===

The Arabic term for prophecy &quot;nubū&#x27;ah&quot; () stems from the term for prophets, &quot;nabī&quot; (; pl. &quot;anbiyāʼ&quot; from &quot;nabā&quot; &quot;tidings, announcement&quot;) who are lawbringers that Muslims believe were sent by God to every person, bringing God&#x27;s message in a language they can understand. But there is also the term &quot;rasūl&quot; ( &quot;messenger, apostle&quot;) to classify those who bring a divine revelation ( &quot;risālah&quot; &quot;message&quot;) via an angel. Knowledge of the Islamic prophets is one of the six articles of the Islamic faith, and specifically mentioned in the Quran. Along with Muhammad, many of the prophets in Judaism (such as Noah, Abraham, Moses, Aaron, Elijah, etc.) and prophets of Christianity (Adam, Zechariah the priest, John the Baptist, Jesus Christ) are mentioned by name in the Quran.

In the sense of predicting events, the Quran contains verses believed to have predicted many events years before they happened and that such prophecies are proof of the divine origin of the Qur&#x27;an. The Qur&#x27;an itself states &quot;Every ˹destined˺ matter has a ˹set˺ time to transpire. And you will soon come to know.&quot; Muslims also recognize the validity of some prophecies in other sacred texts like in the Bible; however, they believe that, unlike the Qur&#x27;an, some parts of the Bible have been corrupted over the years, and as a result, not all of the prophecies and verses in the Bible are accurate.

===Judaism===

The Hebrew term for prophet, &quot;Navi&quot; (), literally means &quot;spokesperson&quot;; a prophet speaks to the people as a mouthpiece of their God, and to their god on behalf of the people. &quot;The name &quot;prophet,&quot; from the Greek meaning &quot;forespeaker&quot; ( being used in the original local sense), is an equivalent of the Hebrew &quot;Navi&quot;, which signifies properly a delegate or mouthpiece of another.&quot;

Sigmund Mowinckel&#x27;s account of prophecy in ancient Israel distinguishes s and prophets - both in their origins and in their functions:

According to Mowinckel, the early seer and the ecstatic prophet derived from two distinctly different social and institutional backgrounds. The seer belonged to the earliest stratum of Israelite society and was related to the priest who &#x27;was not originally in the first instance a sacrificer, but as with the old Arabs, custodian of the sanctuary, oracle priest, &quot;seer&quot; and holder of the effective future-creating and future-interpreting word of power, the blessing and the curse.&#x27; [...] Ecstatic prophecy - &quot;nebiism&quot; - and temple priests were indigenous to Canaanite culture and represented elements adopted by the Israelites. With the fusion of the functions of the seer-priest with the functions of the temple-sacrificial priests and ecstatic prophets, two main groups developed: the priests occupied with cult and sacrifice [...] and the &#x27;prophets&#x27; who &#x27;continued the more &quot;pneumatic&quot; aspect of the character and work of the old &quot;seers&quot;&#x27; and &#x27;were mediums of the divinely inspired &quot;word&quot; which was &quot;whispered to&quot; them, or &quot;came to them&quot;&#x27; [...] The prophets retained, in guild fashion, the old seer relationship to the cult [...].

According to Judaism, authentic Nevuah (, &quot;Prophecy&quot;) got withdrawn from the world after the destruction of the first Jerusalem Temple. Malachi is acknowledged to have been the last authentic prophet if one accepts the opinion that Nechemyah died in Babylon before 9th Tevet 3448 (313 BCE).

The Torah contains laws concerning the &quot;false prophet&quot; (Deuteronomy 13:2-6, 18:20-22). Prophets in Islam, like Lot, for example, are false prophets according to Jewish standards.

In the Torah, prophecy often consisted of a conditioned warning by their God of the consequences should the society, specific communities, or their leaders not adhere to the Torah&#x27;s instructions in the time contemporary with the prophet&#x27;s life. Prophecies sometimes included conditioned promises of blessing for obeying their god, and returning to behaviors and laws as written in the Torah. Conditioned-warning prophecies feature in all Jewish works of the Tanakh.
Notably Maimonides (1138–1204), philosophically suggested that there once were many levels of prophecy, from the highest (such as those experienced by Moses) to the lowest (where the individuals were able to apprehend the Divine Will, but not respond or even describe this experience to others, citing for example, Shem, Eber and most notably, Noah, who, in the biblical narrative, does not issue prophetic declarations).

Maimonides, in his philosophical work &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, outlines twelve modes of prophecy from lesser to greater degree of clarity:
# Inspired actions
# Inspired words
# Allegorical dream revelations
# Auditory dream revelations
# Audiovisual dream revelations/human speaker
# Audiovisual dream revelations/angelic speaker
# Audiovisual dream revelations/Divine speaker
# Allegorical waking vision
# Auditory waking revelation
# Audiovisual waking revelation/human speaker
# Audiovisual waking revelation/angelic speaker
# Audiovisual waking revelation/Divine speaker (that refers implicitly to Moses)

The Tanakh contains prophecies from various Hebrew prophets (55 in total) who communicated messages from God to the nation of Israel, and later to the population of Judea and elsewhere. Experience of prophecy in the Torah and the rest of Tanakh was not restricted to Jews. Nor was the prophetic experience restricted to the Hebrew language.

==Native American prophecy==
There exists a problem in verifying most Native American prophecy, in that they remain primarily an oral tradition, and thus there is no way to cite references of where writings have been committed to paper. In their system, the best reference is an Elder, who acts as a repository of the accumulated wisdom of their tradition.

In another type of example, it is recorded that there are three Dogrib prophets who had claimed to have been divinely inspired to bring the message of Christianity&#x27;s God to their people. This prophecy among the Dogrib involves elements such as dances and trance-like states.

==China==
In ancient Chinese, prophetic texts are known as Chen (谶). The most famous Chinese prophecy is the Tui bei tu (推背圖).

==Nostradamus==
Esoteric prophecy has been claimed for, but not by, Michel de Nostredame (1503–1566), popularly referred to as Nostradamus, who claimed to be a converted Christian. It is known that he suffered several tragedies in his life, and was persecuted to some degree for his cryptic esoteric writings about the future, reportedly derived through a use of a crystal ball. Nostradamus was a French apothecary and reputed seer who published collections of foreknowledge of future events. He is best known for his book &quot;Les Propheties&quot; (&quot;The Prophecies&quot;), the first edition of which appeared in 1555. Since &quot;Les Propheties&quot; was published, Nostradamus has attracted an esoteric following that, along with the popularistic press, credits him with foreseeing world events. His esoteric cryptic foreseeings have in some cases been assimilated to the results of applying the alleged Bible code, as well as to other purported pseudo-prophetic works.

Most reliable academic sources maintain that the associations made between world events and Nostradamus&#x27;s quatrains are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else are so tenuous as to render them useless as evidence of any genuine predictive power. Moreover, none of the sources listed offers any evidence that anyone has ever interpreted any of Nostradamus&#x27;s pseudo-prophetic works specifically enough to allow a clear identification of any event in advance.

==Explanations==
According to skeptics, many apparently fulfilled prophecies can be explained as coincidences, possibly aided by the prophecy&#x27;s own vagueness, and others may have been invented after the fact to match the circumstances of a past event (an act termed &quot;postdiction&quot;).

Bill Whitcomb in &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Companion&quot; observes, One point to remember is that the probability of an event changes as soon as a prophecy (or divination) exists. . . . The accuracy or outcome of any prophecy is altered by the desires and attachments of the seer and those who hear the prophecy.

Many prophets make a large number of prophecies. This makes the chances of at least one prophecy being correct much higher by sheer weight of numbers.

===Psychology===
The phenomenon of prophecy is not well understood in psychology research literature. Psychiatrist and neurologist Arthur Deikman describes the phenomenon as an &quot;intuitive knowing, a type of perception that bypasses the usual sensory channels and rational intellect.&quot;

&quot;(P)rophecy can be likened to a bridge between the individual &#x27;mystical self&#x27; and the communal &#x27;mystical body&#x27;,&quot; writes religious sociologist Margaret Poloma. Prophecy seems to involve &quot;the free association that occurred through the workings of the right brain.&quot;

Psychologist Julian Jaynes proposed that this is a temporary accessing of the bicameral mind; that is, a temporary separating of functions, such that the authoritarian part of the mind seems to literally be speaking to the person as if a separate (and external) voice. Jaynes posits that the gods heard as voices in the head were and are organizations of the central nervous system. God speaking through man, according to Jaynes, is a more recent vestige of God speaking to man; the product of a more integrated higher self. When the bicameral mind speaks, there is no introspection. In earlier times, posits Jaynes, there was additionally a visual component, now lost.

Child development and consciousness author Joseph Chilton Pearce remarked that revelation typically appears in symbolic form and &quot;in a single flash of insight.&quot; He used the metaphor of lightning striking and suggests that the revelation is &quot;a result of a buildup of resonant potential.&quot; Pearce compared it to the earth asking a question and the sky answering it. Focus, he said, feeds into &quot;a unified field of like resonance (and becomes) capable of attracting and receiving the field&#x27;s answer when it does form.&quot;

Some cite aspects of cognitive psychology such as pattern forming and attention to the formation of prophecy in modern-day society as well as the declining influence of religion in daily life.

== Poetry and prophecy ==
For the ancient Greeks, prediction, prophesy, and poetry were often intertwined. Prophecies were given in verse, and a word for poet in Latin is “vates” or prophet. Both poets and oracles claimed to be inspired by forces outside themselves. In ancient China, divination is regarded as the oldest form of occult inquiry and was often expressed in verse. In contemporary Western cultures, theological revelation and poetry are typically seen as distinct and often even as opposed to each other. Yet the two still are often understood together as symbiotic in their origins, aims, and purposes.

Middle English poems of a political nature are linked with Latin and vernacular prophecies. Prophecies in this sense are predictions concerning kingdoms or peoples; and these predictions are often eschatological or apocalyptic. The prophetic tradition in English derives in from Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; (1136), otherwise called &quot;Prophecies of Merlin;&quot; this work is prelude to numerous books devoted to King Arthur. In 18th century England, prophecy as poetry is revived by William Blake who wrote: &quot;America: A Prophecy&quot; (1783) and &quot;Europe: A Prophecy&quot; (1794).

Contemporary American poetry is also rich in lyrics about prophesy, including poems entitled Prophecy by Dana Gioia and Eileen Myles. In 1962, Robert Frost published &quot;The Prophets Really Prophesy as Mystics the Commentators Merely by Statistics&quot;. Other modern poets who write on prophets or prophecy include Carl Dennis, Richard Wilbur, and Derek Walcott.

<text>Orwellian is an adjective which is used to describe a situation, an idea, or a societal condition that 20th century author George Orwell identified as being destructive to the welfare of a free and open society. It denotes an attitude and a brutal policy of draconian control by propaganda, surveillance, disinformation, denial of truth (doublethink), and manipulation of the past, including the &quot;unperson&quot;—a person whose past existence is expunged from the public record and memory, practiced by modern repressive governments. Often, this includes the circumstances depicted in his novels, particularly &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, despite the narrative depicting a society in which only governmental employees are under repressive scrutiny, but political doublespeak is criticized throughout his work, such as in &quot;Politics and the English Language&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; has said the term is &quot;the most widely used adjective derived from the name of a modern writer&quot;.

<text>In statistics, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of &quot;probabilistic classifiers&quot; which assumes that the features are conditionally independent, given the target class. The strength (naivety) of this assumption is what gives the classifier its name. These classifiers are among the simplest Bayesian network models.

Naive Bayes classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables (features/predictors) in a learning problem. Maximum-likelihood training can be done by evaluating a closed-form expression, which takes linear time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers.

In the statistics literature, naive Bayes models are known under a variety of names, including simple Bayes and independence Bayes. All these names reference the use of Bayes&#x27; theorem in the classifier&#x27;s decision rule, but naive Bayes is not (necessarily) a Bayesian method.

==Introduction==
Naive Bayes is a simple technique for constructing classifiers: models that assign class labels to problem instances, represented as vectors of feature values, where the class labels are drawn from some finite set. There is not a single algorithm for training such classifiers, but a family of algorithms based on a common principle: all naive Bayes classifiers assume that the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature, given the class variable. For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 10 cm in diameter. A naive Bayes classifier considers each of these features to contribute independently to the probability that this fruit is an apple, regardless of any possible correlations between the color, roundness, and diameter features.

In many practical applications, parameter estimation for naive Bayes models uses the method of maximum likelihood; in other words, one can work with the naive Bayes model without accepting Bayesian probability or using any Bayesian methods.

Despite their naive design and apparently oversimplified assumptions, naive Bayes classifiers have worked quite well in many complex real-world situations. In 2004, an analysis of the Bayesian classification problem showed that there are sound theoretical reasons for the apparently implausible efficacy of naive Bayes classifiers. Still, a comprehensive comparison with other classification algorithms in 2006 showed that Bayes classification is outperformed by other approaches, such as boosted trees or random forests.

An advantage of naive Bayes is that it only requires a small amount of training data to estimate the parameters necessary for classification.

== Probabilistic model ==

Abstractly, naive Bayes is a conditional probability model: it assigns probabilities formula_1 for each of the possible outcomes or &quot;classes&quot; formula_2 given a problem instance to be classified, represented by a vector formula_3 encoding some features (independent variables).

The problem with the above formulation is that if the number of features is large or if a feature can take on a large number of values, then basing such a model on probability tables is infeasible. The model must therefore be reformulated to make it more tractable. Using Bayes&#x27; theorem, the conditional probability can be decomposed as:
formula_4

In plain English, using Bayesian probability terminology, the above equation can be written as
formula_5

In practice, there is interest only in the numerator of that fraction, because the denominator does not depend on formula_6 and the values of the features formula_7 are given, so that the denominator is effectively constant.
The numerator is equivalent to the joint probability model
formula_8
which can be rewritten as follows, using the chain rule for repeated applications of the definition of conditional probability:
formula_9

Now the &quot;naive&quot; conditional independence assumptions come into play: assume that all features in formula_10 are mutually independent, conditional on the category formula_2. Under this assumption,
formula_12

Thus, the joint model can be expressed as
formula_13
where formula_14 denotes proportionality since the denominator formula_15 is omitted.

This means that under the above independence assumptions, the conditional distribution over the class variable formula_6 is:
formula_17
where the evidence formula_18 is a scaling factor dependent only on formula_19, that is, a constant if the values of the feature variables are known.

=== Constructing a classifier from the probability model ===

The discussion so far has derived the independent feature model, that is, the naive Bayes probability model. The naive Bayes classifier combines this model with a decision rule. One common rule is to pick the hypothesis that is most probable so as to minimize the probability of misclassification; this is known as the &quot;maximum &quot;a posteriori&quot;&quot; or &quot;MAP&quot; decision rule. The corresponding classifier, a Bayes classifier, is the function that assigns a class label formula_20 for some as follows:
formula_21
== Parameter estimation and event models ==

A class&#x27;s prior may be calculated by assuming equiprobable classes, i.e., formula_22, or by calculating an estimate for the class probability from the training set:
formula_23
To estimate the parameters for a feature&#x27;s distribution, one must assume a distribution or generate nonparametric models for the features from the training set.

The assumptions on distributions of features are called the &quot;event model&quot; of the naive Bayes classifier. For discrete features like the ones encountered in document classification (include spam filtering), multinomial and Bernoulli distributions are popular. These assumptions lead to two distinct models, which are often confused.

===Gaussian naive Bayes===
When dealing with continuous data, a typical assumption is that the continuous values associated with each class are distributed according to a normal (or Gaussian) distribution. For example, suppose the training data contains a continuous attribute, formula_24. The data is first segmented by the class, and then the mean and variance of formula_24 is computed in each class. Let formula_26 be the mean of the values in formula_24 associated with class formula_2, and let formula_29 be the Bessel corrected variance of the values in formula_24 associated with class formula_2. Suppose one has collected some observation value formula_32. Then, the probability &quot;density&quot; of formula_32 given a class formula_2, i.e., formula_35, can be computed by plugging formula_32 into the equation for a normal distribution parameterized by formula_26 and formula_29. Formally,
formula_39

Another common technique for handling continuous values is to use binning to discretize the feature values and obtain a new set of Bernoulli-distributed features. Some literature suggests that this is required in order to use naive Bayes, but it is not true, as the discretization may throw away discriminative information.

Sometimes the distribution of class-conditional marginal densities is far from normal. In these cases, kernel density estimation can be used for a more realistic estimate of the marginal densities of each class. This method, which was introduced by John and Langley, can boost the accuracy of the classifier considerably.

===Multinomial naive Bayes ===
With a multinomial event model, samples (feature vectors) represent the frequencies with which certain events have been generated by a multinomial formula_40 where formula_41 is the probability that event occurs (or such multinomials in the multiclass case). A feature vector formula_42 is then a histogram, with formula_7 counting the number of times event was observed in a particular instance. This is the event model typically used for document classification, with events representing the occurrence of a word in a single document (see bag of words assumption). The likelihood of observing a histogram is given by:
formula_44
where formula_45. 

The multinomial naive Bayes classifier becomes a linear classifier when expressed in log-space:
formula_46
where formula_47 and formula_48. Estimating the parameters in log space is advantageous since multiplying a large number of small values can lead to significant rounding error. Applying a log transform reduces the effect of this rounding error.

If a given class and feature value never occur together in the training data, then the frequency-based probability estimate will be zero, because the probability estimate is directly proportional to the number of occurrences of a feature&#x27;s value. This is problematic because it will wipe out all information in the other probabilities when they are multiplied. Therefore, it is often desirable to incorporate a small-sample correction, called pseudocount, in all probability estimates such that no probability is ever set to be exactly zero. This way of regularizing naive Bayes is called Laplace smoothing when the pseudocount is one, and Lidstone smoothing in the general case.

Rennie &quot;et al.&quot; discuss problems with the multinomial assumption in the context of document classification and possible ways to alleviate those problems, including the use of tf–idf weights instead of raw term frequencies and document length normalization, to produce a naive Bayes classifier that is competitive with support vector machines.

===Bernoulli naive Bayes===
In the multivariate Bernoulli event model, features are independent Boolean variables (binary variables) describing inputs. Like the multinomial model, this model is popular for document classification tasks, where binary term occurrence features are used rather than term frequencies. If formula_7 is a Boolean expressing the occurrence or absence of the &#x27;th term from the vocabulary, then the likelihood of a document given a class formula_2 is given by:
formula_51
where formula_52 is the probability of class formula_2 generating the term formula_7. This event model is especially popular for classifying short texts. It has the benefit of explicitly modelling the absence of terms. Note that a naive Bayes classifier with a Bernoulli event model is not the same as a multinomial NB classifier with frequency counts truncated to one.

===Semi-supervised parameter estimation===
Given a way to train a naive Bayes classifier from labeled data, it&#x27;s possible to construct a semi-supervised training algorithm that can learn from a combination of labeled and unlabeled data by running the supervised learning algorithm in a loop:

#Given a collection formula_55 of labeled samples and unlabeled samples , start by training a naive Bayes classifier on .
#Until convergence, do:
##Predict class probabilities formula_56 for all examples in formula_57.
##Re-train the model based on the &quot;probabilities&quot; (not the labels) predicted in the previous step.

Convergence is determined based on improvement to the model likelihood formula_58, where formula_59 denotes the parameters of the naive Bayes model.

This training algorithm is an instance of the more general expectation–maximization algorithm (EM): the prediction step inside the loop is the &quot;E&quot;-step of EM, while the re-training of naive Bayes is the &quot;M&quot;-step. The algorithm is formally justified by the assumption that the data are generated by a mixture model, and the components of this mixture model are exactly the classes of the classification problem.

== Discussion ==

Despite the fact that the far-reaching independence assumptions are often inaccurate, the naive Bayes classifier has several properties that make it surprisingly useful in practice. In particular, the decoupling of the class conditional feature distributions means that each distribution can be independently estimated as a one-dimensional distribution. This helps alleviate problems stemming from the curse of dimensionality, such as the need for data sets that scale exponentially with the number of features. While naive Bayes often fails to produce a good estimate for the correct class probabilities, this may not be a requirement for many applications. For example, the naive Bayes classifier will make the correct MAP decision rule classification so long as the correct class is predicted as more probable than any other class. This is true regardless of whether the probability estimate is slightly, or even grossly inaccurate. In this manner, the overall classifier can be robust enough to ignore serious deficiencies in its underlying naive probability model. Other reasons for the observed success of the naive Bayes classifier are discussed in the literature cited below.

===Relation to logistic regression===

In the case of discrete inputs (indicator or frequency features for discrete events), naive Bayes classifiers form a &quot;generative-discriminative&quot; pair with multinomial logistic regression classifiers: each naive Bayes classifier can be considered a way of fitting a probability model that optimizes the joint likelihood formula_60, while logistic regression fits the same probability model to optimize the conditional formula_61.

More formally, we have the following:


The link between the two can be seen by observing that the decision function for naive Bayes (in the binary case) can be rewritten as &quot;predict class formula_62 if the odds of formula_63 exceed those of formula_64&quot;. Expressing this in log-space gives:
formula_65

The left-hand side of this equation is the log-odds, or &quot;logit&quot;, the quantity predicted by the linear model that underlies logistic regression. Since naive Bayes is also a linear model for the two &quot;discrete&quot; event models, it can be reparametrised as a linear function formula_66. Obtaining the probabilities is then a matter of applying the logistic function to formula_67, or in the multiclass case, the softmax function.

Discriminative classifiers have lower asymptotic error than generative ones; however, research by Ng and Jordan has shown that in some practical cases naive Bayes can outperform logistic regression because it reaches its asymptotic error faster.

== Examples ==

===Person classification===
Problem: classify whether a given person is a male or a female based on the measured features.
The features include height, weight, and foot size. Although with NB classifier we treat them as independent, they are not in reality.

====Training====
Example training set below.

The classifier created from the training set using a Gaussian distribution assumption would be (given variances are &quot;unbiased&quot; sample variances):
The following example assumes equiprobable classes so that P(male)= P(female) = 0.5. This prior probability distribution might be based on prior knowledge of frequencies in the larger population or in the training set.

====Testing====

Below is a sample to be classified as male or female.

In order to classify the sample, one has to determine which posterior is greater, male or female. For the classification as male the posterior is given by
formula_68

For the classification as female the posterior is given by
formula_69

The evidence (also termed normalizing constant) may be calculated:
formula_70

However, given the sample, the evidence is a constant and thus scales both posteriors equally. It therefore does not affect classification and can be ignored. The probability distribution for the sex of the sample can now be determined:
formula_71
formula_72
where formula_73 and formula_74 are the parameters of normal distribution which have been previously determined from the training set. Note that a value greater than 1 is OK here – it is a probability density rather than a probability, because &quot;height&quot; is a continuous variable.

formula_75
formula_76
formula_77

formula_78
formula_79
formula_80
formula_81
formula_82

Since posterior numerator is greater in the female case, the prediction is that the sample is female.

===Document classification===
Here is a worked example of naive Bayesian classification to the document classification problem.
Consider the problem of classifying documents by their content, for example into spam and non-spam e-mails. Imagine that documents are drawn from a number of classes of documents which can be modeled as sets of words where the (independent) probability that the i-th word of a given document occurs in a document from class &quot;C&quot; can be written as
formula_83

(For this treatment, things are further simplified by assuming that words are randomly distributed in the document - that is, words are not dependent on the length of the document, position within the document with relation to other words, or other document-context.)

Then the probability that a given document &quot;D&quot; contains all of the words formula_84, given a class &quot;C&quot;, is
formula_85

The question that has to be answered is: &quot;what is the probability that a given document &quot;D&quot; belongs to a given class &quot;C&quot;?&quot; In other words, what is formula_86?

Now by definition
formula_87
and
formula_88

Bayes&#x27; theorem manipulates these into a statement of probability in terms of likelihood.
formula_89

Assume for the moment that there are only two mutually exclusive classes, &quot;S&quot; and ¬&quot;S&quot; (e.g. spam and not spam), such that every element (email) is in either one or the other;
formula_90
and
formula_91

Using the Bayesian result above, one can write:
formula_92
formula_93

Dividing one by the other gives:
formula_94

Which can be re-factored as:
formula_95

Thus, the probability ratio p(&quot;S&quot; | &quot;D&quot;) / p(¬&quot;S&quot; | &quot;D&quot;) can be expressed in terms of a series of likelihood ratios.
The actual probability p(&quot;S&quot; | &quot;D&quot;) can be easily computed from log (p(&quot;S&quot; | &quot;D&quot;) / p(¬&quot;S&quot; | &quot;D&quot;)) based on the observation that p(&quot;S&quot; | &quot;D&quot;) + p(¬&quot;S&quot; | &quot;D&quot;) = 1.

Taking the logarithm of all these ratios, one obtains:
formula_96

(This technique of &quot;log-likelihood ratios&quot; is a common technique in statistics.
In the case of two mutually exclusive alternatives (such as this example), the conversion of a log-likelihood ratio to a probability takes the form of a sigmoid curve: see logit for details.)

Finally, the document can be classified as follows. It is spam if formula_97 (i. e., formula_98), otherwise it is not spam.

<doc id="87348" wikidata="Q739675" url="?curid=87348" title="Bayamón, Puerto Rico">
<text>Bayamón (, ) is a city and municipality in Puerto Rico. Located on the northeastern coastal plain, it is bounded by Guaynabo to the east, Toa Alta and Naranjito to the west, Toa Baja and Cataño to the north, and Aguas Buenas and Comerío to the south. Part of the San Juan metropolitan area, Bayamón is spread over 11 barrios and the downtown area and administrative center of Bayamón Pueblo. With a population of 185,187 as of the 2020 census, it is the second most populated municipality in the archipelago and island after the capital of San Juan.

== Etymology and nicknames ==
Two theories exist about the origin of the name Bayamón. According to one, it was named after the local cacique, &quot;Bahamon&quot;. The other theory states the name was derived from the Taino word &quot;Bayamongo&quot;, which is the native name of the river that runs across this region, implying that Bayamón is the area around this main river, which later on became the center of the city&#x27;s development.

Bayamón is nicknamed &quot;City of the Chicharrón&quot; or &quot;Pork Rind City&quot; (&quot;Ciudad del Chicharrón&quot;) after the popular fried dish, locally known as &quot;chicharrón volao&quot;, that is often sold as street food. Other nicknames include &quot;City of Cowboys&quot; (&quot;Ciudad de Vaqueros&quot;), after the local sports team, &quot;City of the Sciences&quot; (&quot;Ciudad de las Ciencias&quot;) after the popular tourist educational attraction, and, more recently, &quot;Ciudad del Tapón&quot;, due to the high amounts of road traffic congestion there.

==History==

The Taino, the indigenous peoples who encountered European explorers and settlers, were the long-time settlers in this area. Before the foundation of the municipality, Hacienda Santa Cruz was established near the Bayamón River in 1750. The Spanish colonist Juan Ramírez de Arellano formally established Bayamón as a Spanish settlement on May 22, 1772, on a hill known as &quot;Alto del Embarcadero&quot;. The establishment of its current parish church on that same spot also dates to this year.

In 1821, Marcos Xiorro, an African slave, planned to lead a revolt against the sugarcane plantation owners and the Spanish colonial government in Puerto Rico. The slave conspiracy was revealed and suppressed, but Xiorro became a hero among the slaves. He is part of Puerto Rico&#x27;s folklore. Marco Xiorro was owned by Vicente Andino, a militia captain who owned a sugarcane plantation in Bayamón. An earthquake in 1867 caused damages in Bayamón, particularly to its parish church.

Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Bayamón was 19,940. The city grew considerably during the start of the 20th century. The area became home to numerous factories specializing in textiles, fertilizer, aluminum between 1901 and 1920. During this time the city also became home to financial institutions such as the Puerto Rico Commercial Bank (Banco Comercial de Puerto Rico), the American Colonial Bank, the First National City Bank of New York, the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Banco Popular de Puerto Rico. This developed and strengthened Bayamón&#x27;s economy and turned it into both an industrial and commercial hub. The city&#x27;s infrastructure also developed with the establishment of a bigger sewer system.

The city was also host to some of the events of the VIII Pan American Games in 1979.
Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, causing large-scale damage and destruction to infrastructure. Numerous landslides occurred in Bayamón as a result of the hurricane&#x27;s significant amount of rainfall. In Bayamón, around 300 homes were destroyed, and two people were killed by Hurricane María. Many municipal buildings, and the Goya Foods factory in Bayamón sustained significant damage.

<text>In Norse mythology, Árvakr (Old Norse &quot;early awake&quot;) and Alsviðr (&quot;very quick&quot;) are the horses which pull the sun, or Sól&#x27;s chariot, across the sky each day. It is said that the gods fixed bellows underneath the two horses&#x27; shoulders to help cool them off as they rode.

Both horses are mentioned in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and &quot;Grímnismál&quot; and their names are frequently associated with descriptions of the Sun. In Nordic mythology, gods govern the passage of days, nights, and seasons, and shape the Sun from a spark of the flame Muspelheim, but the Sun stands still without a driver. Sól is kidnapped by the gods to drive the Sun in a chariot pulled by two horses. Two large bellows (&quot;ísarnkol&quot;; cold iron) were placed under the shoulders of the two horses to protect them from the immense heat of the Sun. Sól is unable to stop driving the chariot or else Sköll will catch the Sun and devour it; the Sun is expected to be caught and devoured on the day of Ragnarök.

: “Early-waker and All-swift—they will henceforth, slender horses, pull up the sun.
: And under their shoulders the blithe Powers, the Æsir, hid cool iron.”

The myth of the Sun pulled by horses is not exclusive to Norse or Germanic religion. Many other mythologies and religions contain a solar deity or carriage of the Sun pulled by horses. In Persian and Phrygian mythology, Mithras and Attis perform this task. In Greek mythology, Apollo performs this task, although it was previously performed by Helios. The myth of Árvakr and Alsviðr is thought to have inspired English dramatist and poet James Shirley&#x27;s play &quot;The Triumph of Peace&quot; (1663).

<text>Svalinn is a legendary shield in Nordic mythology which stands in front of Sun, protecting the world from her heat. It has been suggested to be part of a continuous tradition of solar imagery dating back to the Nordic Bronze Age.
==Etymology==
 in Old Norse translates as &quot;cold&quot; or &quot;chill&quot; and is derived from the verb , meaning &quot;to cool&quot;, in turn from the adjective (&#x27;cool&#x27;), from from (&quot;to burn slowly, create a burningly cold sensation&quot;) from Proto-Indo-European: &#x27;*swel-&#x27; (&quot;to shine, warm up, burn&quot;).

==Attestations==
===Grímnismál===
In Grímnismál, Odin gives the role of Svalinn as part of his description of the cosmology:

===Nafnaþulur===
In the Nafnaþulur section of the Prose Edda, Snorri Sturluson records Svalinn in a list of shields:

===Sigrdrífumál===
In Sigrdrífumál, runes are described as being carved on a shield, identified with Svalinn, along with the horses that draw Sun&#x27;s chariot.


==Interpretation and symbolism==
The association between the sun and shields is noted both in Þórsdrápa, in which the sun is described as &#x27;the splendid sky-shield&#x27;, and in Skáldskaparmál, in which a kenning for &#x27;shield&#x27; is the &quot;sun of the ship&quot; (). This relationship between ships, shields and the sun has been suggested to originate in the Nordic Bronze Age, in which all three form part of the sun myth. Ritual shields dating to the Bronze Age have also been discovered in Scandinavia which have been noted by scholars to resemble the sun and were possibly used to represent it in a religious context. 

In the Nordic Bronze Age, the sun could be depicted as a wheel cross or a disc, as with the Trundholm sun chariot. It has been argued that the disc later ceased to be seen as a representation of the sun god herself and instead as it appears in the sky, as a round shield. By this theory, the role of the shield in preventing the world from overheating came later to explain its presence.

<text>In mathematics, the graph of a function formula_1 is the set of ordered pairs formula_2, where formula_3 In the common case where formula_4 and formula_5 are real numbers, these pairs are Cartesian coordinates of points in a plane and often form a curve.
The graphical representation of the graph of a function is also known as a &quot;plot&quot;.

In the case of functions of two variables – that is, functions whose domain consists of pairs formula_2 –, the graph usually refers to the set of ordered triples formula_7 where formula_8. This is a subset of three-dimensional space; for a continuous real-valued function of two real variables, its graph forms a surface, which can be visualized as a &quot;surface plot&quot;.

In science, engineering, technology, finance, and other areas, graphs are tools used for many purposes. In the simplest case one variable is plotted as a function of another, typically using rectangular axes; see &quot;Plot (graphics)&quot; for details.

A graph of a function is a special case of a relation. 
In the modern foundations of mathematics, and, typically, in set theory, a function is actually equal to its graph. However, it is often useful to see functions as mappings, which consist not only of the relation between input and output, but also which set is the domain, and which set is the codomain. For example, to say that a function is onto (surjective) or not the codomain should be taken into account. The graph of a function on its own does not determine the codomain. It is common to use both terms &quot;function&quot; and &quot;graph of a function&quot; since even if considered the same object, they indicate viewing it from a different perspective.
== Definition ==

Given a function formula_9 from a set (the domain) to a set (the codomain), the graph of the function is the set 
formula_10
which is a subset of the Cartesian product formula_11. In the definition of a function in terms of set theory, it is common to identify a function with its graph, although, formally, a function is formed by the triple consisting of its domain, its codomain and its graph.

== Examples ==

=== Functions of one variable ===

The graph of the function formula_12 defined by
formula_13
is the subset of the set formula_14
formula_15

From the graph, the domain formula_16 is recovered as the set of first component of each pair in the graph formula_17.
Similarly, the range can be recovered as formula_18.
The codomain formula_19, however, cannot be determined from the graph alone.

The graph of the cubic polynomial on the real line
formula_20
is
formula_21

If this set is plotted on a Cartesian plane, the result is a curve (see figure).
=== Functions of two variables ===

The graph of the trigonometric function
formula_22
is
formula_23

If this set is plotted on a three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, the result is a surface (see figure).

Oftentimes it is helpful to show with the graph, the gradient of the function and several level curves. The level curves can be mapped on the function surface or can be projected on the bottom plane. The second figure shows such a drawing of the graph of the function:
formula_24

<text>Michael Robertson (born 1967) is the founder and former CEO of MP3.com, an Internet music site. In the years following his departure from MP3.com Robertson has launched several companies, including Linspire, SIPphone, MP3tunes, and Ajax13. He is also founder of OnRad.io, a search engine for radio and DAR.fm, a website for recording audio from internet radio.

Robertson faced numerous lawsuits from major record labels due to copyright infringements from the company&#x27;s &quot;Beam-it&quot; and &quot;Instant Listening&quot; programs. MP3.com settled the majority of these lawsuits for tens of millions of dollars. The company was later acquired by Vivendi Universal for $385 million.

Robertson founded OS technology company Lindows, which later changed its name to Linspire after settling a trademark lawsuit with Microsoft. Linspire focused on creating an easy-to-use Linux-based operating system for desktops and laptops.

In 2003, Robertson founded SIPphone, which developed free VOIP software called Gizmo5. Google acquired the company in 2009. Robertson also launched MP3tunes.com in 2005, a music download service without digital rights management (DRM). MP3tunes faced a copyright infringement lawsuit by EMI and eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2012.

Robertson earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Cognitive Science from the University of California, San Diego, and currently resides in San Diego. He self-identifies as a libertarian and has been recognized for his innovative contributions to technology.

==Career==
===MP3.com===

Robertson was the founder of the original MP3.com. Despite the early success of MP3.com on Wall Street (the day of the stock IPO (ticker:MPPP), the stock rose from $28 to peak at $103), Robertson quickly led his company into a firestorm of lawsuits generated by the major record labels and music publishing concerns. The litigation sprang from Robertson&#x27;s &quot;Beam-it&quot; and &quot;Instant Listening&quot; programs. &quot;Beam-it&quot; was a functionality that allowed people to quickly load their existing CD collection into online lockers at my.mp3.com and access their private music collections online. &quot;Instant Listening&quot; allowed instant access to CDs purchased online from participating retailers. However, to launch the service Robertson essentially had to duplicate every music CD ever created. Although MP3.com purchased the CDs for their index and users had to supply their own copy as well, MP3.com violated copyright laws by failing to acquire licenses for the music that was internally duplicated by digitally storing the material on their servers.

Virtually every major record label sued MP3.com, and Robertson&#x27;s company settled the majority of the lawsuits for tens of millions of dollars. Universal Music, however, held out and took the issue to court. After the trial started, in the case of UMG v. MP3.com, MP3.com was found to have violated copyright laws and ordered to pay as much as $250 million to Universal Music Group. MP3.com paid $53.4 million to settle Universal Music&#x27;s claim. This legal outcome triggered a class action complaint charging MP3.com and certain officers, including Robertson and company directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The action was ultimately resolved under the terms of an agreement whereby the defendants, while continuing to deny all liability, paid into an escrow account $35,000,000 and agreed to issue 2.5 million shares of MP3.com common stock which MP3.com valued at the time at $5,391,000, in exchange for complete dismissals and releases of all claims with prejudice. In addition, under the stipulations, MP3.com agreed to institute certain corporate governance enhancements.

Many saw the case as simple copyright infringement on a grand, even record-breaking scale. The first line of the Court&#x27;s opinion reads: &quot;The complex marvels of cyberspatial communication may create difficult legal issues; but not in this case. Defendant&#x27;s infringement of plaintiff&#x27;s copyrights is clear,&quot; rendering such speculations moot.

MP3.com was acquired for $385 million by Vivendi Universal during a buying spree by Vivendi&#x27;s CEO Jean-Marie Messier. The acquisition was completed on August 28, 2001. After the purchase by Vivendi, Michael Robertson cashed in with an estimated $103 million. In hindsight, after Messier departed Vivendi, the new Vivendi management determined the corporate acquisitions spree to be reckless and later sold MP3.com to CNET which now manages the site. Messier&#x27;s buying spree accumulated billions of dollars in debt for his company and resulted in company shares falling to 20% of their previous value. Vivendi was compelled to sell off many other companies to scale down its debt.

===Linspire===
After leaving MP3.com, Robertson started an OS technology company, Lindows. Since Lindows created a Linux based operating system designed to compete with Microsoft&#x27;s Windows operating system, Microsoft filed trademark related lawsuits in the United States and abroad. Given that the trademarked &quot;Windows&quot; name was in some jeopardy, Microsoft paid to settle the lawsuit they initiated with a $20 million payment to Lindows and certain licenses with Lindows agreeing to change their name worldwide to Linspire.

Linspire championed an easy-to-use system for desktops and laptop computers and signed on popular retailers, both offline and online, including Walmart.com, TigerDirect, Frys and MicroCenter. Linspire was based on Debian (and later Ubuntu) with a KDE interface. Linspire was most distinguished by CNR, an early app store.

In 2008, Robertson attempted to sue Linspire&#x27;s bank, Comerica, in an attempt to get Comerica to refund severance payments which had been made to laid-off Linspire employees. Robertson alleged the severance payments were actually funds which had been embezzled by the laid-off employees. The San Diego Police Department investigated and quickly came to the conclusion that this was a simple dispute between Robertson and Linspire&#x27;s CEO at the time, Kevin Carmony, and no embezzlement or other crime had been committed. Robertson lost the lawsuit without it getting past summary judgment. Robertson then filed a civil suit against the six former employees directly, for which he was counter sued. The jury sided largely with the employees, awarding a $238,000 judgement against Robertson. A smaller judgement of $80,000 was awarded to Robertson, however, this judgement was vacated and set aside by Judge Taylor. Judge Taylor stated in his ruling, “It is plain to the court that Linspire [Robertson] was not required to act in the protection of its interests as it did. Rather, Linspire [Robertson] approached this case as a vehicle for a test of will as between Robertson and Carmony.”

In an effort to defend the names of the former employees being sued by Robertson, a website critical of Robertson called Freespire.com [that site is no longer active, it has been moved here: http://clipish.net/freespire/] was launched in February 2008. The Freespire.com site states that it is &quot;dedicated to shedding light on the REAL Michael Robertson,&quot; and discloses information and facts about Robertson. In an attempt to have the Freespire.com site taken down, Robertson had Linspire (renamed as Digital Cornerstone) file a lawsuit, claiming the site violated trademark law. In 2010, Robertson lost the lawsuit with the court saying the site did not infringe on any trademarks and was protected as free speech. Judge Judith F. Hayes stated in her ruling, &quot;...the Court finds the general purpose of the website to be a free speech forum wherein Defendant criticized the management of Plaintiff.&quot;

===SIPphone===
In 2003 Robertson founded SIPphone, which utilized the SIP telecommunication standard. In addition to selling phone adapters and routers, SIPphone developed free VOIP software to compete with Skype based on the SIP standard called Gizmo5, which is available on a variety of platforms. On November 12, 2009, Google announced that it had acquired the company and relocated the team to Mountain View to join the Google Voice team.

===MP3tunes===
In February 2005, Robertson launched MP3tunes.com, which sold downloadable music. Robertson boasted that, unlike Apple&#x27;s iTunes Music Store and most other competitors at the time, MP3tunes did not use digital rights management (DRM) technology to limit the use of songs its customers purchased. MP3tunes also provided Oboe, a digital music back-up service (later referred to by the company as a &#x27;music locker&#x27;). MP3tunes stopped selling digital music in 2008.

Like Robertson&#x27;s first online music company MP3.com, MP3tunes.com was sued for copyright infringement lawsuit by a major recording label, EMI, through its U.S. division, Capitol Records. The lawsuit resulted from a side-project website that Robertson created called Sideload.com. This site allowed people to search music hosted on various servers around the Internet and side load them to their MP3tunes music locker. The sources of these anonymous files varied. Some were legitimate MP3 files that were legal to download. Others were pirated MP3s which had been uploaded by people and indexed by search engines.

In April 2008, Robertson pleaded with the MP3tunes user group to help fund the legal defense regarding the EMI lawsuit.

The &quot;Capitol Records, Inc. v. MP3Tunes, LLC&quot; case had a mixed outcome, with the court holding that MP3tunes was generally not liable for copyright infringement by its users, but was liable in cases where takedown notices were ignored or where Robertson himself had seeded the site with unlicensed music. The decision was viewed as a victory for online storage and cloud music services, but the legal battle was very costly for the company.

MP3tunes filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on April 27, 2012. Included among the creditors were his lawyers ($1.4 million), several employees ($10,775), and even the coffee vendor ($96). The only secured creditor listed in the filing was Robertson himself, through his SKL Trust.

In March 2014, a New York jury ordered Robertson to pay roughly $41 million in damages for massive copyright infringement by MP3tunes for the works of Capitol Records, EMI and other record labels and music publishers. MP3tunes had filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012, but the jury found Robertson personally liable for the copyright infringement. The plaintiffs brought the copyright case in 2007.

===Ajax 13===
Founded in early 2006 by Robertson (CEO) and Hisham El-Emam (CTO), Ajax 13 Inc. is a software development company that provides web-based applications written using XUL. Ajax 13 offers ajaxWrite, a web-based word processor as a software as a service.

==Education and personal life==
He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Cognitive Science from the University of California, San Diego, where he studied under Donald Norman and interned at the nearby San Diego Supercomputer Center.

Robertson lives in San Diego, California. His reported wealth has varied widely, but he has been on the Forbes 400 list once and twice on the Fortune 40 under 40, most recently in 2004. In 1999, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.

In October 2012, Robertson filed a petition to legally change his name to Michael Lee Hammer, alleging he was abused during childhood by his stepfather. In Judge William Pauley&#x27;s ruling in the MP3tunes/EMI copyright trial, Pauley singled out the story Robertson told on the witness stand about this alleged abuse, stating that Roberton&#x27;s &quot;seemingly rehearsed, five-minute fable-like narrative left the jury nonplussed and Plaintiffs&#x27; counsel shell-shocked. It was a dramatic presentation. Even if true, Robertson&#x27;s decision to spin this yarn backfired on him. The jury saw it for what it was—a transparent attempt to tug at their heartstrings.&quot; The judge further observed, &quot;Jurors see through performances, and the Oscars are over for this year.&quot;

In 2010, Robertson and his wife Leslie Burcham legally separated, though it is speculated by former business partners that this move was a guise to hide assets up for grabs in one of Robertson’s many failed court cases. 

Robertson self-identifies as a libertarian.

In 2002, Robertson and his wife founded the Robertson Education Empowerment Foundation (REEF) to provide University of California, San Diego students with financial aid, under the agreement that they would contribute a percentage of their later earnings to the foundation&#x27;s funds.

<text>GEM (for Graphics Environment Manager) is a discontinued operating environment released by Digital Research in 1985. GEM is known primarily as the native graphical user interface of the Atari ST series of computers, providing a WIMP desktop. It was also available for IBM PC compatibles and shipped with some models from Amstrad. GEM is used as the core for some commercial MS-DOS programs, the most notable being Ventura Publisher. It was ported to other computers that previously lacked graphical interfaces, but never gained traction. The final retail version of GEM was released in 1988.

Digital Research later produced X/GEM for their FlexOS real-time operating system with adaptations for OS/2 Presentation Manager and the X Window System under preparation as well.

==History==
===GSX===
In late 1984, GEM started life at DRI as an outgrowth of a more general-purpose graphics library known as GSX (Graphics System Extension), written by a team led by Don Heiskell since about 1982. Lee Jay Lorenzen (at Graphic Software Systems) who had recently left Xerox PARC (the birthplace of the modern GUI) wrote much of the code. GSX was essentially a DRI-specific implementation of the GKS graphics standard proposed in the late 1970s. GSX was intended to allow DRI to write graphics programs (charting, etc.) for any of the 8-bit and 16-bit platforms CP/M-80, Concurrent CP/M, CP/M-86 and MS-DOS (NEC APC-III) would run on, a task that otherwise would have required considerable effort to port due to the large differences in graphics hardware (and concepts) between the various systems of that era.

GSX consisted of two parts: a selection of routines for common drawing operations, and the device drivers that are responsible for handling the actual output. The former was known as GDOS (Graphics Device Operating System) and the latter as GIOS (Graphics Input/Output System), a play on the division of CP/M into the machine-independent BDOS (Basic Disk Operating System) and the machine-specific BIOS (Basic Input/Output System). GDOS was a selection of routines that handled the GKS drawing, while GIOS actually used the underlying hardware to produce the output.

The DOS version of GSX supports loading drivers in the CP/M-86 CMD format. Consequently, the same driver binary may operate under both CP/M-86 and DOS.

===GEM===
====Intel versions====
The 16-bit version of GSX 1.3 evolved into one part of what would later be known as &quot;GEM&quot;, which was an effort to build a full GUI system using the earlier GSX work as its basis. Originally known as Crystal as a play on an IBM project called Glass, the name was later changed to GEM.

Under GEM, GSX became GEM VDI (Virtual Device Interface), responsible for basic graphics and drawing. VDI also added the ability to work with multiple fonts and added a selection of raster drawing commands to the formerly vector-only GKS-based drawing commands. VDI also added multiple viewports, a key addition for use with windows.

A new module, GEM AES (Application Environment Services), provided the window management and UI elements, and GEM Desktop used both libraries in combination to provide a GUI. The 8086 version of the entire system was first officially demoed at COMDEX in November 1984, following a demonstration on the 80286-based Acorn Business Computer in September 1984 where the software had been attributed to Acorn, and the system was shipped as GEM/1 on 28 February 1985.

=====GEM/1=====

GEM Desktop 1.0 was released on 28 February 1985.
GEM Desktop 1.1 was released on 10 April 1985 with support for CGA and EGA displays.
A version for the Apricot Computers F-Series, supporting 640×200 in up to 8 colors, was also available as GEM Desktop 1.2.

Digital Research also positioned Concurrent DOS 4.1 with GEM as alternative for IBM&#x27;s TopView.

DRI originally designed GEM for DOS so that it would check for and only run on IBM computers, and not PC compatibles like those from Compaq, as the company hoped to receive license fees from compatible makers. Developers reacted with what &quot;BYTE&quot; described as &quot;a small explosion&quot;; it reported that at a DRI-hosted seminar in February 1985, more than half of the attendees agreed that GEM&#x27;s incompatibility with Compaq was a serious limitation. Later that month the company removed the restriction. Applications that supported GEM included Lifetree Software&#x27;s GEM Write.

At this point, Apple Computer sued DRI in what would turn into a long dispute over the &quot;look and feel&quot; of the GEM/1 system, which was an almost direct copy of Macintosh (with some elements bearing a closer resemblance to those in the earlier Lisa, available since January 1983). This eventually led to DRI being forced to change several basic features of the system. (See also: Apple v. Digital Research.) Apple would later go on to sue other companies for similar issues, including their copyright lawsuit against Microsoft and HP.

In addition to printers the system also contained drivers for some more unusual devices such as the Polaroid Palette.

=====GEM/2=====

DRI responded with the &quot;lawsuit-friendly&quot; GEM Desktop 2.0, released on 24 March 1986, which eventually added support for VGA, sometime after its release in 1987. It allowed the display of only two fixed windows on the &quot;desktop&quot; (though other programs could do what they wished), changed the trash can icon, and removed the animations for things like opening and closing windows. It was otherwise similar to GEM/1, but also included a number of bug fixes and cosmetic improvements.

In 1988 Stewart Alsop II said that GEM was among several GUIs that &quot;have already been knocked out&quot; of the market by Apple, IBM/Microsoft, and others.

=====GEM XM=====

GEM XM with &quot;GEM Desktop 3.0&quot; was an updated version of GEM/2 in 1986/1987 for DOS (including DOS Plus) which allowed task-switching and the ability to run up to ten GEM and DOS programs at once, swapping out to expanded memory (XM) through EMS/EEMS or to disk (including RAM disks, thereby also allowing the use of extended memory). Data could be copied and pasted between applications through a clipboard with filter function (a feature later also found in TaskMAX under DR DOS 6.0). Digital Research planned to offer GEM XM as an option to GEM Draw Plus users and through OEM channels.

The GEM XM source code is now freely available under the terms of GNU General Public License.

=====GEM/3=====

The last retail release was GEM/3 Desktop, released on 3 November 1988, which had speed improvements and shipped with a number of basic applications. Commercial sales of GEM ended with GEM/3; the source code was subsequently made available to a number of DRI&#x27;s leading customers.

While GEM/2 for the PC still provided a GSX API in addition to the GEM API; GEM/3 no longer did.

=====GEM/4 for CCP Artline=====
GEM/4, released in 1990, included the ability to work with Bézier curves, a feature still not commonly found outside the PostScript world. This version was produced specifically for Artline 2, a drawing program from the German company CCP Development GmbH.

The system also included changes to the font management system, which made it incompatible with the likes of Timeworks Publisher.

Artline 1 still ran on GEM 3.1.

=====GEM/5 for GST Timeworks Publisher=====
Another version of GEM called GEM/5 was produced by GST Software Products for Timeworks&#x27; Publisher 2.1. It contained an updated look with 3D buttons, along with features such as on-the-fly font scaling. It came complete with all the standard GEM 3.1 tools. This version was produced from GEM 3.13 with only the Bézier handling taken from GEM/4.

=====ViewMAX for DR DOS=====
GEM Desktop itself was spun off in 1990 as a product known as ViewMAX which was used solely as a file management shell under DR DOS. In this form the system could not run other GEM programs. This led to a situation where a number of applications (including ViewMAX) could exist all with their own statically linked copy of the GEM system. This scenario was actually rare, as few native GEM programs were published. In 1991, ViewMAX 2 was released.

In these forms, GEM survived until DRI was purchased by Novell in June 1991 and all GEM development was cancelled.

=====X/GEM=====

Throughout this time DRI had also been working on making the GEM system capable of multitasking. This started with X/GEM based on GEM/1, but this required use of one of the multitasking CP/M-based operating systems. DRI also produced X/GEM for their FlexOS real-time operating system with adaptations for OS/2 Presentation Manager and the X Window System under preparation as well.

=====Ventura Publisher=====
Lee Lorenzen left soon after the release of GEM/1, when it became clear that DRI had no strong interest in application development. He then joined with two other former DRI employees, Don Heiskell and John Meyer, to start Ventura Software. They developed Ventura Publisher (which was later marketed by Xerox and eventually by Corel), which would go on to be a very popular desktop publishing program for some time.

====Atari versions====

Development of the production 68000 version of GEM began in September 1984, when Atari sent a team called &quot;The Monterey Group&quot; to Digital Research to begin work on porting GEM. Originally, the plan was to run GEM on top of CP/M-68K, both ostensibly ported to Motorola 68000 by DRI prior to the ST design being created. In fact, these ports were unusable and would require considerable development. Digital Research also offered GEMDOS (originally written as GEM DOS, it was also called &quot;Project Jason&quot;), a DOS-like operating system aimed to port GEM to different hardware platforms. It was available for 8086 and 68000 processors and had been adapted to the Apple Lisa 2/5 and the Motorola VME/10 development system. Atari decided in January 1985 to give up on the existing CP/M-68K code and instead port DRI GEMDOS to the Atari ST platform, referring to it as TOS.

As Atari had provided most of the development of the 68000 version, they were given full rights to continued developments without needing to reverse-license it back to DRI. As a result, the Apple-DRI lawsuit did not apply to the Atari versions of GEM, and they were allowed to keep a more Mac-like UI.

Over the next seven years, from 1985 to 1992, new versions of TOS were released with each new generation of the ST line. Updates included support for more colors and higher resolutions in the raster-side of the system, but remained generally similar to the original in terms of GKS support. In 1992, Atari released TOS 4, or MultiTOS, along with their final computer system, the Falcon030. In combination with MiNT, TOS 4 allowed full multitasking support in GEM.

====Continued development====

When Caldera bought the remaining Digital Research assets from Novell on 23 July 1996, initial plans were to revive GEM and ViewMAX technologies for a low-footprint user interface for OpenDOS in mobile applications as &quot;Caldera View&quot;, but these plans were abandoned by Caldera UK in favour of DR-WebSpyder and GROW. Caldera Thin Clients (later known as Lineo) released the source to GEM and GEM XM under the terms of GNU GPL-2.0-only in April 1999. The development of GEM for PC continues as FreeGEM and OpenGEM.

On the Atari ST platform, the original DRI sources were ported again to be used in the free and open source TOS clone EmuTOS. New implementations of the AES portions of GEM have been implemented from scratch in the form of XaAES, and MyAES, both of which are fully re-entrant and support multitasking on top of the FreeMiNT multitasking extensions to TOS.

==Description==
The &quot;full&quot; GEM system consisted of three main parts:

#GEM VDI (Virtual Device Interface)
#GEM AES (Application Environment Services)
#GEM Desktop (an application providing drag-and-drop file management)

GEM VDI was the core graphics system of the overall GEM engine. It was responsible for &quot;low level&quot; drawing in the form of &quot;draw line from here to here&quot;. VDI included a resolution and coordinate independent set of vector drawing instructions which were called from applications through a fairly simple interface. VDI also included environment information (state, or context), current color, line thickness, output device, etc.

These commands were then examined by GDOS, whose task it was to send the commands to the proper driver for actual rendering. For instance, if a particular GEM VDI environment was connected to the screen, the VDI instructions were then routed to the screen driver for drawing. Simply changing the environment to point to the printer was all that was needed (in theory) to print, dramatically reducing the developer workload (they formerly had to do printing &quot;by hand&quot; in all applications). GDOS was also responsible for loading up the drivers and any requested fonts when GEM was first loaded.

One major advantage VDI provided over the Macintosh was the way multiple devices and contexts were handled. In the Mac such information was stored in memory inside the application. This resulted in serious problems when attempting to make the Mac handle pre-emptive multitasking, as the drawing layer (QuickDraw) needed to have direct memory access into all programs. In GEM VDI however, such information was stored in the device itself, with GDOS creating &quot;virtual devices&quot; for every context – each window for instance.

GEM AES provided the window system, window manager, UI style and other GUI elements (widgets). For performance reasons, many of the GUI widgets were actually drawn using character graphics. Compared to the Macintosh, AES provided a rather spartan look and the system shipped with a single monospaced font.

AES performs its operations by calling the VDI, but in a more general sense the two parts of GEM were often completely separated in applications. Applications typically called AES commands to set up a new window, with the rest of the application using VDI calls to actually draw into that window.

GEM Desktop was an application program that used AES to provide a file manager and launcher, the traditional &quot;desktop&quot; environment that users had come to expect from the Macintosh. Unlike the Macintosh, the GEM Desktop ran on top of DOS (MS-DOS, DOS Plus or DR DOS on the PC, GEMDOS on the Atari), and as a result the actual display was cluttered with computer-like items, including path names and wildcards. In general, GEM was much more &quot;geeky&quot; than the Mac, but simply running a usable shell on DOS was a huge achievement on its own. Otherwise, GEM has its own advantages over Mac OS such as proportional sliders.

Native PC GEM applications use the file extension .APP for executables, whereas GEM desktop accessories use the file extension .ACC instead. All desktop accessories (and also a few simple applications) can be run under ViewMAX without modification.

<doc id="87366" wikidata="Q379656" url="?curid=87366" title="Saint Vincent (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines)">
<text>Saint Vincent is a volcanic island in the Caribbean. It is the largest island of the country Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and is located in the Caribbean Sea, between Saint Lucia and Grenada. It is composed of partially submerged volcanic mountains. Its largest volcano and the country&#x27;s highest peak, La Soufrière, is active, with the latest episode of volcanic activity having begun in December 2020 and intensifying in April 2021.

There were major territory wars between the indigenous population of the Black Caribs, also called the Garifuna, and Great Britain in the 18th century, before the island was ceded to the British in 1763, and again in 1783. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines gained independence from the United Kingdom on 27 October 1979, and became part of the British Commonwealth of Nations thereafter. Approximately 130,000 people currently live on the island, and the population saw significant migration to the UK in the early 1900s, and between the 1940s, and 1980s. There has also been significant migration to Canada, and other larger neighbouring Anglo-Caribbean islands. The main island consists of the capital Kingstown, with the rest of the island divided into, five main coastal strip towns of; Layou, Barrouallie, Chateaubelair, Georgetown, and Calliaqua.

==People==

The people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are formally called Vincentians; colloquially they are known as &quot;Vincies&quot; or &quot;Vincys&quot;. The majority of the island&#x27;s population is of Afro-Vincentian descent. However, a sizable portion of the population consists of Black Carib descendants, white descendants of English colonists, Portuguese descendants of indentured servants and a significant number of Indo-Vincentians, descendants of indentured workers with Indian heritage. There is also a sizable mixed-race minority (19%).

In 2012, the population of the island was approximately 130,000. The main religions are Anglican (47%), Methodist (10%), Roman Catholic (13%), other Protestant denominations such as Seventh-day Adventism and Spiritual baptism, as well as Hinduism.

Adult literacy was 88.1% in 2004. Infant mortality in 2006 was 17 per 1,000 live births and life expectancy for men stood at 69 years, 74 years for women. The active workforce in 2006 was 57,695 and unemployment in 2004 was 12%.

==History==

Before 1498, the island was called &quot;Hairouna&quot; by its indigenous inhabitants. Christopher Columbus named the island Saint Vincent, since it is said to have been discovered on 22 January, the feast day of the patron saint of Lisbon and Valencia, Vincent of Saragossa.

The Spanish conquistadors embarked on slaving expeditions in and around St. Vincent following royal sanction in 1511, driving the inhabitants to the rugged interior, but the Spanish were not able to settle the island. 
In the 1500s Columbus and the conquistadors noted there was a significantly large African population living amongst the native population, whom they assumed had come from shipwrecked slave ships or escaped from St. Lucia or Grenada to seek refuge in St. Vincent. They were called &quot;Black Caribs&quot;, but are now known as &quot;Garifuna&quot;.

The large population aggressively prevented European settlement on St. Vincent until the 18th century.

===French colony===
The first Europeans to occupy St. Vincent were the French. However, following a series of wars and peace treaties, these islands were eventually ceded to the British. While the English were the first to lay claim to St. Vincent in 1627, the French, centred on the island of Martinique, became the first Europeans to invade the island, establishing their first colony at Barrouallie on the Leeward side of St. Vincent in 1719. African slaves were forced to cultivate coffee, tobacco, indigo, corn, and sugar on plantations operated by the French colonizers. Under French dominion, Saint Vincent was known as Ile Saint Marcouf.

St. Vincent was ceded to Britain by the Treaty of Paris (1763), after which friction between the British and the natives led to the First Carib War. Upon taking control of the island in 1763, the British laid the foundations of Fort Charlotte which was completed in 1806. The island was reverted to French rule in 1779, then regained by the British under the Treaty of Versailles (1783). Between 1793 and 1796, the Black Caribs, led by their chief, Joseph Chatoyer, fought a series of battles against the British. The combat ultimately ended in a treaty, after which 5,000 Garifuna were exiled to the smaller island of Baliceaux off the coast of Bequia. Conflict between the British and the indigenous peoples continued until 1796, when General Ralph Abercromby ended a revolt fomented by the radical Victor Hugues. The British deported more than 5,000 Black Caribs to Roatán, an island off the coast of Honduras.

===British colony===

From 1763 until independence, St. Vincent passed through various stages of colonial status under the British. A representative assembly was authorized in 1776. The British abolished slavery in 1834. Like the French before them, the British made African slaves work plantations of sugar, coffee, indigo, tobacco, cotton and cocoa until full emancipation in 1838. The resulting labour shortages on the plantations attracted Portuguese immigrants, many of them of Jewish descent, in the 1840s, and East Indians in the 1860s as laborers.

After emancipation, the economy began a period of decline, with many landowners abandoning their estates and leaving the land to be cultivated by liberated slaves. Conditions remained harsh for both former slaves and immigrant agricultural workers, as depressed world sugar prices kept the economy stagnant until the turn of the 20th century. The Opobo king Jaja was exiled to St. Vincent after his 1887 arrest by the British for shipping cargoes of palm oil directly to Liverpool without the intermediation of the National African Company.

A Crown Colony government was installed in 1877, a Legislative Council created in 1925, and universal adult suffrage granted in 1951. During this period, the British made several unsuccessful attempts to affiliate St. Vincent with other Windward Islands in order to govern the region through a unified administration. The most notable was the West Indies Federation, which collapsed in 1962. Life on the island was made even harder following two eruptions of the La Soufriere volcano in 1812 and 1902 when much of the island was destroyed and many people were killed. The volcano erupted again in 1979, with no fatalities, and in 2020–2021.

==Self-rule and independence==
St. Vincent and the Grenadines was granted associate statehood status by Britain on 27 October 1969, giving it complete control over its internal affairs. Following a referendum in 1979, St. Vincent and the Grenadines became the last of the Windward Islands to gain independence, on 27 October 1979, though it remains a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. It celebrates Independence Day every year on 27 October.

==Geography==
The island of Saint Vincent is in the Lesser Antilles chain; it is long and wide and it is located west of Barbados.

It is very mountainous and heavily forested. It has a active volcano, La Soufriere, which erupted violently in 1812 and 1902. The most recent eruption was on 9 April 2021, which resulted in the evacuation of 20,000 residents.

The island has a total surface area of , or about 88% of the total country area, 19 times that of the country&#x27;s second largest island Bequia. The coastline measures about .

The climate is tropical and humid, with an average temperature of between depending on altitude. More than 95% of the beaches on the mainland have black sand, while most of the beaches in the Grenadines have white sand.

For many years, this sand was used in the building industry. During recent times, because of destruction to the coastal areas, the government has restricted the amount of sand that may be removed from beaches, as well as the specific beaches from which sand may be removed. The sand is still used in construction of metalled roads, as it blends in with the colour of the asphalt used for road construction.

===Biodiversity===
Saint Vincent is home to endemic birds including the lesser Antillean Tanager, the whistling warbler, and the Saint Vincent amazon. Some pockets of tropical rainforest are left on the volcanic hills. Two species of reptile which are native to Saint Vincent are named for the island, &quot;Chironius vincenti&quot; and &quot;Sphaerodactylus vincenti&quot;.

=== Volcanic activity ===
On 9 April 2021, the first 2021 eruption of La Soufrière occurred and another &quot;explosive event&quot; was reported two days later; eruptions were expected to continue for some time. Approximately 16,000 people were required to evacuate the area of their homes. Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves made this comment to the news media: &quot;water supplies to most of the island had been cut off and its airspace closed because of the smoke and thick plumes of volcanic ash moving through the atmosphere&quot;. An official added: &quot;we are covered in ash and strong sulphur scents pervade the air ... take the necessary precautions to remain safe and healthy&quot;. Carnival Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean International sent five ships in total, with a capacity of 7,500, to assist with the evacuation. Barbados dispatched a &quot;humanitarian assistance and disaster response&quot; mission to the island.

Additional &quot;explosive events&quot; occurred on 11 April and on 12 April. On that latter day, the volcano &quot;continued to erupt explosively&quot; and was generating &quot;pyroclastic flows&quot; that were &quot;destroying everything in its path&quot;.

==Popular culture events==
In 2002, Saint Vincent was one of the filming locations for the American adventure fantasy film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;. Filming took place from October 2002 through to March 2003, and several hundreds of the local inhabitants were hired as cast members.

== Educational institutions ==
Saint Vincent is home to a number of international accrediting medical schools:
# All Saints University School of Medicine
# Saint James School of Medicine
# Trinity School of Medicine
# American University of St. Vincent School of Medicine
In addition to the international schools, Saint Vincent is home to local educational schools.

<text>Digital Research, Inc. (DR or DRI) was a privately held American software company created by Gary Kildall to market and develop his CP/M operating system and related 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit systems like MP/M, Concurrent DOS, FlexOS, Multiuser DOS, DOS Plus, DR DOS and GEM. It was the first large software company in the microcomputer world. Digital Research was originally based in Pacific Grove, California, later in Monterey, California.

==History==
=== 1974–1979: Founding and incorporation ===
In 1972, Gary Kildall, an instructor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, began working at Intel as a consultant under the business name Microcomputer Applications Associates (MAA). By 1974, he had developed Control Program/Monitor, or CP/M, the first disk operating system for microcomputers. 

In 1974 he incorporated as Intergalactic Digital Research, with his wife handling the business side of the operation. The company soon began operating under its shortened name Digital Research. The company&#x27;s operating systems, starting with CP/M for 8080/Z80-based microcomputers, were the de facto standard of their era. Digital Research&#x27;s product suite included the original 8-bit CP/M and its various offshoots like MP/M (1979), a multi-tasking multi-user version of CP/M.

=== 1980–1990: CP/M, CP/M-86 ===

After Microsoft presented MS-DOS that was based on CP/M, Digital Research released CP/M-86, which was the first 16-bit system (1981, adapted to the IBM PC in early 1982), which was meant as direct competitor to MS-DOS. There followed the multi-tasking MP/M-86 (1981), and Concurrent CP/M (1982), a single-user version featuring virtual consoles from which applications could be launched to run concurrently. The company&#x27;s documentation had a poor reputation, with Jerry Pournelle in 1982 describing it as seemingly &quot;encrypted and translated into Swahili&quot;. and &quot;Infoworld&quot; calling its CP/M manuals incomplete, ncomprehensible, and poorly indexed.

In May 1983 Digital Research announced that it would offer PC DOS versions of all of its languages and utilities. It remained influential, with  million in 1983 sales making Digital Research the fourth-largest microcomputer software company. Admitting that it had &quot;lost&quot; the 8088 software market but hoped to succeed with the Intel 80286 and Motorola 68000, by 1984 the company formed a partnership with AT&amp;T Corporation to develop software for Unix System V and sell its own and third-party products in retail stores. Pournelle warned later that year, however, that &quot;Many people of stature seem to have left or are leaving Digital Research. DR had better get its act together.&quot;

In a parallel development Digital Research also produced a selection of programming language compilers and interpreters for their OS-supported platforms, including C, Pascal, COBOL, FORTRAN, PL/I, PL/M, CBASIC, BASIC, and Logo.

Digital Research developed CP/M-86 as an alternative to MS-DOS and it was made available through IBM in early 1982. The company later created an MS-DOS clone with advanced features called DR DOS, which pressured Microsoft to further improve its own DOS.

At the time the IBM Personal Computer was being developed, Digital Research&#x27;s CP/M was the dominant operating system of the day. In 1980, IBM asked Digital Research to supply a version of CP/M written for the Intel 8086 microprocessor as the standard operating system for the PC, which would use the code-compatible Intel 8088 chip. Digital Research, uneasy about the conditions related to making such an agreement with IBM, refused.

Microsoft seized this opportunity to supply an OS, in addition to other software (e.g., BASIC) for the new IBM PC. When the IBM PC arrived in late 1981, it came with PC DOS, an OEM version of MS-DOS, which was developed from 86-DOS, which Microsoft had acquired for this purpose. By mid-1982, MS-DOS was also marketed for use in hardware-compatible non-IBM computers. This one decision resulted in Microsoft becoming the leading name in computer software.

This story is detailed from the point of view of Microsoft and IBM in the PBS series &quot;Triumph of the Nerds&quot;, and from the point of view of Gary Kildall&#x27;s friends and coworkers in &quot;The Computer Chronicles&quot;.

The competition between MS-DOS and DR DOS is one of the more controversial chapters of microcomputer history. Microsoft offered better licensing terms to any computer manufacturer that committed to selling MS-DOS with every system they shipped, making it uneconomical for them to offer systems with another OS, since the manufacturer would still be required to pay a license fee to Microsoft for that system. This practice led to a US Department of Justice investigation, resulting in a decision in 1994 that barred Microsoft from &quot;per-processor&quot; licensing.

Successive revisions of Concurrent CP/M incorporated MS-DOS API emulation (since 1983), which gradually added more support for DOS applications and the FAT file system. These versions were named Concurrent DOS (1984), with Concurrent PC DOS (1984) being the version adapted to run on IBM compatible PCs.

In 1985, soon after the introduction of the 80286-based IBM PC/AT, Digital Research introduced a real-time system, initially called Concurrent DOS 286.

Other single-user operative systems were launched: DOS Plus (1985) and DR DOS (1988). The latter system was marketed as a direct MS-DOS/PC DOS replacement with added functionality. In order to achieve this, it gave up built-in support to run CP/M applications and was changed to use DOS-compatible internal structures. It became a successful product line in itself.

===Graphics Environment Manager (1985)===

In 1985 Digital Research also produced a microcomputer version of the GKS graphics standard (related to NAPLPS) called GSX, and later used this as the basis of their GEM GUI. Less known are their application programs, limited largely to the GSX-based DR DRAW and a small suite of GUI programs for GEM. After the development of GEM, Microsoft introduced Windows 1.0.

Digital Research (and later its successor Caldera) accused Microsoft of announcing vaporware versions of MS-DOS to suppress sales of DR DOS.

===FlexOS, Concurrent DOS XM and Concurrent DOS 386 ===

Concurrent PC DOS later evolved into the modular FlexOS (1986). This exploited the greater memory addressing capability of the new CPU to provide a more flexible multi-tasking environment. There was a small but powerful set of system APIs, each with a synchronous and an asynchronous variant. Pipes were supported, and all named resources could be aliased by setting environment variables. This system was to enjoy enduring favour in point-of-sale systems.

Other successors of Concurrent DOS were Concurrent DOS XM (1986) and the 32-bit Concurrent DOS 386 (1987).

=== 1990 and 1991: Multiuser DOS ===

In 1991 DR presented Multiuser DOS. Digital Research&#x27;s multi-user family of operating systems was sidelined with the previous single user operative systems.

In one beta release of Windows 3.1, Microsoft included hidden code (later called the AARD code) that detected DR DOS and displayed a cryptic error message. 

== 1991–2014: Acquisition by Novell ==
Digital Research was purchased by Novell for  million in 1991.

primarily for Novell to gain access to the operating system line. FlexOS, this operative system had already been adopted as the basis for the following systems:

* Siemens S5-DOS/MT, 
* IBM 4680 OS 
* 4690 OS.

==Notable employees==

Several notable employees worked at Digital Research, some of which later made important contributions to the IT industry, such as:

* Gary Kildall
* Kathryn Strutynski
* Gordon Eubanks
* Tom Rolander 
* Edward R. McCracken

== Acquisitions ==

<text>The history of Armenia covers the topics related to the history of the Republic of Armenia, as well as the Armenian people, the Armenian language, and the regions of Eurasia historically and geographically considered &quot;Armenian&quot;.

Armenia is located between Eastern Anatolia and the Armenian highlands, surrounding the Biblical mountains of Ararat. The endonym of the Armenians is &quot;hay&quot;, and the old Armenian name for the country is &quot;Hayk&#x27;&quot; (, which also means &quot;Armenians&quot; in Classical Armenian), later &quot;Hayastan&quot; (). Armenians traditionally associate this name with the legendary progenitor of the Armenian people, Hayk. The names Armenia and Armenian are exonyms, first attested in the Behistun Inscription of Darius the Great. The early Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi derived the name Armenia from Aramaneak, the eldest son of the legendary Hayk. Various theories exist about the origin of the endonym and exonyms of Armenia and Armenians (see Name of Armenia).

In the Bronze Age, several states flourished in the Armenian highlands, including the Hittite Empire (at the height of its power), Mitanni (southwestern historical Armenia), and Hayasa-Azzi (1600–1200 BC). Soon after the Hayasa-Azzi were the Nairi tribal confederation (1400–1000 BC) and the Kingdom of Urartu (1000–600 BC). Each of the aforementioned nations and tribes participated in the ethnogenesis of the Armenian people. Yerevan, the modern capital of Armenia, dates back to the 8th century BC, with the founding of the fortress of Erebuni in 782 BC by King Argishti I at the western extreme of the Ararat plain. Erebuni has been described as &quot;designed as a great administrative and religious centre, a fully royal capital.&quot;

The Iron Age kingdom of Urartu was replaced by the Orontid dynasty, which ruled Armenia first as satraps under Achaemenid Persian rule and later as independent kings. Following Persian and subsequent Macedonian rule, the Kingdom of Greater Armenia was established in 190 BC by Artaxias I, founder of the Artaxiad dynasty. The Kingdom of Armenia rose to the peak of its influence in the 1st century BC under Tigranes the Great before falling under Roman suzerainty. In the 1st century AD, a branch of the ruling Arsacid dynasty of the Parthian Empire established itself on the throne of Armenia.

In the early 4th century, Arsacid Armenia became the first state to accept Christianity as its state religion. The Armenians later fell under Byzantine, Sassanid Persian, and Islamic hegemony, but reinstated their independence with the Bagratid kingdom of Armenia in the 9th century. After the fall of the kingdom in 1045, and the subsequent Seljuk conquest of Armenia in 1064, the Armenians established a kingdom in Cilicia, which existed until its destruction in 1375.

In the early 16th century, much of Armenia came under Safavid Persian rule; however, over the centuries Western Armenia fell under Ottoman rule, while Eastern Armenia remained under Persian rule. By the 19th century, Eastern Armenia was conquered by Russia and Greater Armenia was divided between the Ottoman and Russian empires.

In the early 20th century, the Ottoman government subjected the Armenians to a genocide in which up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed and many more were dispersed throughout the world via Syria and Lebanon. In 1918, an independent Republic of Armenia was established in Eastern Armenia in the wake of the collapse of the Russian Empire. This republic fell under Soviet rule in 1920, and Armenia became a republic within the Soviet Union after its founding. In 1991, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the modern-day independent Republic of Armenia was established.

==Prehistory==
Stone tools from 325,000 years ago have been found in Armenia which indicate the presence of early humans at this time.

In the 1960s, excavations in the Yerevan 1 Cave uncovered evidence of ancient human habitation, including the remains of a 48,000-year-old heart, and a human cranial fragment and tooth of a similar age.

The Armenian Highland shows traces of settlement from the Neolithic era. Archaeological surveys in 2010 and 2011 have resulted in the discovery of the world&#x27;s earliest known leather shoe (3,500 BC), straw skirt (3,900 BC), and wine-making facility (4,000 BC) at the Areni-1 cave complex.

The Shulaveri-Shomu culture of the central Transcaucasus region is one of the earliest known prehistoric cultures in the area, carbon-dated to roughly 6000–4000 BC.

===Bronze Age===

An early Bronze-Age culture in the area is the Kura-Araxes culture, assigned to the period between c. 4000 and 2200 BC. The earliest evidence for this culture is found on the Ararat plain; thence it spread to Georgia by 3000 BC (but never reaching Colchis), proceeding westward and to the south-east into an area below the Urmia basin and Lake Van.

From 2200 BC to 1600 BC, the Trialeti-Vanadzor culture flourished in Armenia, southern Georgia, and northeastern Turkey. It has been speculated that this was an Indo-European culture. Other, possibly related, cultures were spread throughout the Armenia Highlands during this time, namely in the Aragats and Lake Sevan regions.

Early 20th-century scholars suggested that the name &quot;Armenia&quot; may have possibly been recorded for the first time on an inscription which mentions Armanî (or Armânum) together with Ibla, from territories conquered by Naram-Sin (2300 BC) identified with an Akkadian colony in the current region of Diyarbekir; however, the precise locations of both Armani and Ibla are unclear. Some modern researchers have placed Armani (Armi) in the general area of modern Samsat, and have suggested it was populated, at least partially, by an early Indo-European-speaking people. Today, the modern Assyrians (who traditionally speak Neo-Aramaic, not Akkadian) refer to the Armenians by the name Armani. It is possible that the name &quot;Armenia&quot; originates in &quot;Armini&quot;, Urartian for &quot;inhabitant of Arme&quot; or &quot;Armean country.&quot; The Arme tribe of Urartian texts may have been the Urumu, who in the 12th century BC attempted to invade Assyria from the north with their allies the Mushki and the Kaskians. The Urumu apparently settled in the vicinity of Sason, lending their name to the regions of Arme and the nearby land of Urme. Thutmose III of Egypt, in the 33rd year of his reign (1446 BC), mentioned as the people of &quot;Ermenen&quot;, claiming that in their land &quot;heaven rests upon its four pillars&quot;. Armenia is possibly connected to Mannaea, which may be identical to the region of Minni mentioned in the Bible. However, what all these attestations refer to cannot be determined with certainty, and the earliest certain attestation of the name &quot;Armenia&quot; comes from the Behistun Inscription (c. 500 BC).

The earliest form of the word &quot;Hayastan&quot;, an endonym for Armenia, might possibly be Hayasa-Azzi, a kingdom in the Armenian Highlands that was recorded in Hittite records dating from 1500 to 1200 BC.

Between 1200 and 800 BC, much of Armenia was united under a confederation of tribes, which Assyrian sources called Nairi (&quot;Land of Rivers&quot; in Assyrian&quot;).

===Iron Age===


The Kingdom of Urartu, also known as the Kingdom of Van, flourished between the 9th century BC and 585 BC&lt;ref name=&quot;Urartu/Armenia&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in the Armenian Highland. The founder of the Urartian Kingdom, Aramé, united all the principalities of the Armenian Highland and gave himself the title &quot;King of Kings&quot;, the traditional title of Urartian Kings. The Urartians established their sovereignty over all of Taron and Vaspurakan. The main rival of Urartu was the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

During the reign of Sarduri I (834–828 BC), Urartu had become a strong and organized state, and imposed taxes on neighbouring tribes. Sarduri made Tushpa (modern Van) the capital of Urartu. His son, Ishpuinis, extended the borders of the state by conquering what would later be known as the Tigranocerta area and by reaching Urmia. Menuas (810–785 BC) extended the Urartian territory up north, by spreading towards the Araratian fields. He left more than 90 inscriptions by using the Mesopotamian cuneiform writing system in the Urartian language. Argishti I of Urartu conquered Latakia from the Hittites, and reached Byblos, and Phoenicia. He built the Erebuni Fortress, located in modern-day Yerevan, in 782 BC by using 6600 prisoners of war.

In 714 BC, the Assyrians under Sargon II defeated the Urartian king Rusa I at Lake Urmia and destroyed the holy Urartian temple at Musasir. At the same time, an Indo-European tribe called the Cimmerians attacked Urartu from the north-west region and destroyed the rest of his armies. Under Ashurbanipal (669–627 BC) the boundaries of the Assyrian Empire reached as far as Armenia and the Caucasus Mountains. The Medes under Cyaxares invaded Assyria later on in 612 BC, and then took over the Urartian capital of Van towards 585 BC, effectively ending the sovereignty of Urartu. According to the Armenian tradition, the Medes helped the Armenians establish the Orontid dynasty.

==Antiquity==
===Orontid dynasty===

After the fall of Urartu around 585 BC, the Satrapy of Armenia arose, ruled by the Armenian Orontid dynasty, which governed the state in 585–190 BC. Under the Orontids, Armenia during this era was a satrapy of the Persian Empire, and after its disintegration (in 330 BC), it became an independent kingdom. During the rule of the Orontid dynasty, most Armenians adopted the Zoroastrian religion.

===Artaxiad dynasty===

The Hellenistic Seleucid Empire, controlled Syria, Armenia, and vast other eastern regions. However, after their defeat by Rome in 190 BC, the Seleucids relinquished control of any regional claim past the Taurus Mountains, limiting Seleucids to a quickly diminishing area of Syria. A Hellenistic Armenian state was founded in 190 BC. It was a Hellenistic successor state of Alexander the Great&#x27;s short-lived empire, with Artaxias becoming its first king and the founder of the Artaxiad dynasty (190 BC–AD 1). At the same time, a western portion of the kingdom split as a separate state under Zariadris, which became known as Lesser Armenia while the main kingdom acquired the name of Greater Armenia.

The new kings began a program of expansion which was to reach its zenith a century later. Their acquisitions are summarized by Strabo. Zariadris acquired Acilisene and the &quot;country around the Antitaurus&quot;, possibly the district of Muzur or west of the Euphrates. Artaxias took lands from the Medes, Iberians, and Syrians. He then had confrontations with Pontus, Seleucid Syria and Cappadocia, and was included in the treaty which followed the victory of a group of Anatolian kings over Pharnaces of Pontus in 181 BC. Pharnaces thus abandoned all of his gains in the west.

At its zenith, from 95 to 66 BC, Greater Armenia extended its rule over parts of the Caucasus and the area that is now eastern and central Turkey, north-western Iran, Israel, Syria and Lebanon, forming the second Armenian empire. For a time, Armenia was one of the most powerful states east of Rome. It eventually confronted the Roman Republic in wars, which it lost in 66 BC, but nonetheless preserved its sovereignty. Tigranes continued to rule Armenia as an ally of Rome until his death in 55 BC.

The Third Mithridatic War and defeat of the King of Pontus by Roman Pompeius resulted in the Kingdom of Armenia becoming an allied client state of Rome. Later on, in 1 AD, Armenia came under full Roman control until the establishment of the Armenian Arsacid dynasty. The Armenian people then adopted a Western political, philosophical, and religious orientation. According to Strabo, around this time everyone in Armenia spoke &quot;the same language.&quot;

===Roman Armenia===


From Pompeius&#x27; campaign Armenia was, for the next few centuries, contested between Rome and Parthia/Sassanid Persia on the other hand. Roman emperor Trajan even created a short-lived Province of Armenia between 114 and 118 AD.

Indeed, Roman supremacy was fully established by the campaigns of Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, that ended with a formal compromise: a Parthian prince of the Arsacid line would henceforth sit on the Armenian throne, but his nomination had to be approved by the Roman emperor.

Because this agreement was not respected by the Parthian Empire, in 114 Trajan from Antiochia in Syria marched on Armenia and conquered the capital Artaxata. Trajan then deposed the Armenian king Parthamasiris (imposed by the Parthians) and ordered the annexation of Armenia to the Roman Empire as a new province.
The new province reached the shores of the Caspian Sea and bordered to the north with Caucasian Iberia and Caucasian Albania, two vassal states of Rome. As a Roman province Armenia was administered by Catilius Severus of the Gens Claudia. After Trajan&#x27;s death, however, his successor Hadrian decided not to maintain the province of Armenia. In 118 AD, Hadrian gave Armenia up, and installed Parthamaspates as its &quot;vassal&quot; king.

===Arsacid dynasty===

Armenia, under its Arshakuni dynasty, which was a branch of the eponymous Arsacid dynasty of Parthia, was often a focus of contention between Rome and Parthia. The Parthians forced Armenia into submission from 37 to 47, when the Romans retook control of the kingdom.

Under Nero, the Romans fought a campaign (55–63) against the Parthian Empire, which had invaded the kingdom of Armenia, allied to the Romans. After gaining (60) and losing (62) Armenia, the Romans under Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, legate of Syria entered (63) into an agreement of Vologases I of Parthia, which confirmed Tiridates I as king of Armenia, thus founding the Arshakuni dynasty.

The Arsacid dynasty lost control of Armenia for a few years when emperor Trajan created the &quot;Roman Province of Armenia&quot;, fully included into the Roman Empire from 114 to 117 AD. His successor, Hadrian, reinstalled the Arsacid dynasty when he nominated Parthamaspates as &quot;vassal&quot; king of Armenia in 118 AD.

Another campaign was led by Emperor Lucius Verus in 162–165, after Vologases IV of Parthia had invaded Armenia and installed his chief general on its throne. To counter the Parthian threat, Verus set out for the east. His army won significant victories and retook the capital. Sohaemus, a Roman citizen of Armenian heritage, was installed as the new client king.

The Sassanid Persians occupied Armenia in 252 and held it until the Romans returned in 287. In 384 the kingdom was split between the Byzantine Empire and the Persians. Western Armenia quickly became a province of the Roman Empire under the name of Armenia Minor; Eastern Armenia remained a kingdom within Persia until 428, when the local nobility overthrew the king, and the Sassanids installed a governor in his place.

According to tradition, the Armenian Apostolic Church was established by two of Jesus&#x27; twelve apostles—Thaddaeus and Bartholomew—who preached Christianity in Armenia in the 40s–60s AD. Between 1st and 4th centuries AD, the Armenian Church was headed by patriarchs.

====Christianization====

In 301, Armenia became the first nation to adopt Christianity as a state religion, amidst the long-lasting geo-political rivalry over the region. It established a church that today exists independently of both the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches, having become so in 451 after having rejected the Council of Chalcedon. The Armenian Apostolic Church is a part of the Oriental Orthodox communion, not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox communion. The first Catholicos of the Armenian church was Saint Gregory the Illuminator. Because of his beliefs, he was persecuted by the pagan king of Armenia, and was &quot;punished&quot; by being thrown in Khor Virap, in modern-day Armenia.

He acquired the title of Illuminator, because he illuminated the spirits of Armenians by introducing Christianity to them. Before this, the dominant religion amongst the Armenians was Zoroastrianism. Scholars have suggested that Armenia adopted Christianity &quot;partly . . . in defiance&quot; of the Sassanids.

In 405–06, Armenia&#x27;s political future seemed uncertain. With the help of the king of Armenia, Mesrop Mashtots created a unique alphabet to suit the people&#x27;s needs. By doing so, he ushered in a new Golden Age and strengthened Armenian national identity.

After years of rule, the Arsacid dynasty fell in 428, with Eastern Armenia being subjugated to Persia and Western Armenia, to Rome. In the 5th century, the Sassanid Shah Yazdegerd II tried to tie his Christian Armenian subjects more closely to the Sassanid Empire by reimposing the Zoroastrian religion. The Armenians greatly resented this, and as a result, a rebellion broke out with Vartan Mamikonian as the leader of the rebels. Yazdegerd thus massed his army and sent it to Armenia, where the Battle of Avarayr took place in 451. The 66,000 Armenian rebels, mostly peasants, lost their morale when Mamikonian died in the battlefield. They were substantially outnumbered by the 180,000- to 220,000-strong Persian army of Immortals and war elephants. Despite being a military defeat, the Battle of Avarayr and the subsequent guerilla war in Armenia eventually resulted in the Treaty of Nvarsak (484), which guaranteed religious freedom to the Armenians.

===Persian Armenia===

With the partition of Armenia in 387 by the Byzantines and Sassanids, the western half became part of the Byzantines known as Byzantine Armenia, while the eastern (and much larger half) became a vassal state within the Sassanid realm.

In 428, the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia was completely abolished by the Sassanid Persians, and the territory was made a full province within Persia, known as Persian Armenia. Persian Armenia remained in Sassanid hands up to the Muslim conquest of Persia, when the invading Muslim forces annexed the Sassanid realm.

==Middle Ages==

===Arab caliphates, Byzantium and Bagratid Armenia===
In 591, the Byzantine emperor Maurice defeated the Persians and recovered much of the remaining territory of Armenia into the empire. The conquest was completed by the emperor Heraclius, himself ethnically Armenian, in 629. In 645, the Muslim Arab armies of the caliphate had attacked and conquered the country. Armenia, which once had its own rulers and was at other times under Persian and Byzantine control, passed largely into the power of the caliphs, and established the province of Arminiya.

Nonetheless, there were still parts of Armenia held within the empire, containing many Armenians. This population held tremendous power within the empire. Emperor Heraclius (610–641) was of Armenian descent, as was Emperor Philippikos Bardanes (711–713). The emperor Basil I, who took the Byzantine throne in 867, was the first of what is sometimes called the Armenian dynasty (see Macedonian dynasty), reflecting the strong effect the Armenians had on the Byzantine Empire.

Evolving as a feudal kingdom in the ninth century, Armenia experienced a brief cultural, political and economic renewal under the Bagratuni dynasty. Bagratid Armenia was eventually recognized as a sovereign kingdom by the two major powers in the region: Baghdad in 885, and Constantinople in 886. Ani, the new Armenian capital, was constructed at the kingdom&#x27;s apogee in 964.
===Sallarid dynasty===
The Iranian Sallarid dynasty conquered parts of Eastern Armenia in the second half of the 10th century.

===Seljuq Armenia===

Although the native Bagratuni dynasty was founded under favourable circumstances, the feudal system gradually weakened the country by eroding loyalty to the central government. Thus internally enfeebled, Armenia proved an easy victim for the Byzantines, who captured Ani in 1045. The Seljuk dynasty under Alp Arslan in turn took the city in 1064.

In 1071, after the defeat of the Byzantine forces by the Seljuk Turks at the Battle of Manzikert, the Turks captured the rest of Greater Armenia and much of Anatolia. So ended Christian leadership of Armenia for the next millennium with the exception of a period of the late 12th-early 13th centuries, when the Muslim power in Greater Armenia was seriously troubled by the resurgent Kingdom of Georgia. Many local nobles (&quot;nakharars&quot;) joined their efforts with the Georgians, leading to liberation of several areas in northern Armenia, which was ruled, under the authority of the Georgian crown, by the Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli, a prominent Armeno-Georgian noble family.

===Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia===
To escape death or servitude at the hands of those who had assassinated his relative Gagik II, King of Ani, an Armenian named Roupen with some of his countrymen went into the gorges of the Taurus Mountains and then into Tarsus of Cilicia. Here the Byzantine governor gave them shelter in the late 11th century. Two great dynastic families, the Rubenids and the Hethumids, ruled what became in 1199, with the coronation of Levon I, the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia and through skillful diplomacy and military alliances (explained below) maintained their political autonomy until 1375. The kingdom&#x27;s political independence relied on a vast network of castles which controlled the mountain passes and the strategic harbours. Almost all of the civilian settlements were located directly below or near these fortifications.

After the members of the first Crusade appeared in Asia Minor, the Armenians developed close ties to European Crusader States. They flourished in south-eastern Asia Minor until it was conquered by Muslim states. Count Baldwin, who with the rest of the Crusaders was passing through Asia Minor bound for Jerusalem, left the Crusader army and was adopted by Thoros of Edessa, an Armenian ruler of Greek Orthodox faith. As they were hostile towards the Seljuks and unfriendly to the Byzantines, the Armenians took kindly to the crusader count. So when Thoros was assassinated, Baldwin was made ruler of the new crusader County of Edessa. It seems that the Armenians were pleased with Baldwin&#x27;s rule and with the crusaders in general, and some number of them fought alongside the crusaders. When Antioch had been taken (1097), Constantine, the son of Roupen, received from the crusaders the title of baron.

The Third Crusade and other events elsewhere left Cilicia as the sole substantial Christian presence in the Middle East. World powers, such as Byzantium, the Holy Roman Empire, the papacy and even the Abbasid caliph competed and vied for influence over the state and each raced to be the first to recognise Leo II, Prince of Lesser Armenia, as the rightful king. As a result, he had been given a crown by both German and Byzantine emperors. Representatives from across Christendom and a number of Muslim states attended the coronation, thus highlighting the important stature that Cilicia had gained over time. The Armenian authorities was often in touch with the crusaders. No doubt the Armenians aided in some of the other crusades. Cilicia flourished greatly under Armenian rule, as it became the last remnant of medieval Armenian statehood. Cilicia acquired an Armenian identity, as the kings of Cilicia were called kings of the Armenians, not of the Cilicians.

In Lesser Armenia, Armenian culture was intertwined with both the European culture of the Crusaders and with the Hellenic culture of Cilicia. As the Catholic families extended their influence over Cilicia, the Pope wanted the Armenians to follow Catholicism. This situation divided the kingdom&#x27;s inhabitants between pro-Catholic and pro-Apostolic camps. Armenian sovereignty lasted until 1375, when the Mamelukes of Egypt profited from the unstable situation in Lesser Armenia and destroyed it.

==Early modern period==
===Persian Armenia===


Due to its strategic significance, the historical Armenian homelands of Western Armenia and Eastern Armenia were constantly fought over and passed back and forth between Safavid Persia and the Ottomans. For example, at the height of the Ottoman–Persian Wars, Yerevan changed hands fourteen times between 1513 and 1737. Greater Armenia was annexed in the early 16th century by Shah Ismail I. Following the Peace of Amasya of 1555, Western Armenia fell into the neighbouring Ottoman hands, while Eastern Armenia stayed part of Safavid Iran, until the 19th century.

In 1604, Shah Abbas I pursued a scorched-earth campaign against the Ottomans in the Ararat valley during the Ottoman–Safavid War (1603–1618). The old Armenian town of Julfa in the province of Nakhichevan was taken early in the invasion. From there Abbas&#x27; army fanned out across the Araratian plain. The Shah pursued a careful strategy, advancing and retreating as the occasion demanded, determined not to risk his enterprise in a direct confrontation with stronger enemy forces.

While laying siege to Kars, he learned of the approach of a large Ottoman army, commanded by Djghazadé Sinan Pasha. The order to withdraw was given; but to deny the enemy the potential to resupply themselves from the land, he ordered the wholesale destruction of the Armenian towns and farms on the plain. As part of this the whole population was ordered to accompany the Persian army in its withdrawal. Some 300,000 people were duly herded to the banks of the Araxes River. Those who attempted to resist the mass deportation were killed outright. The Shah had previously ordered the destruction of the only bridge, so people were forced into the waters, where a great many drowned, carried away by the currents, before reaching the opposite bank. This was only the beginning of their ordeal. One eye-witness, Father de Guyan, describes the predicament of the refugees thus:

:&quot;It was not only the winter cold that was causing torture and death to the deportees. The greatest suffering came from hunger. The provisions which the deportees had brought with them were soon consumed ... The children were crying for food or milk, none of which existed, because the women&#x27;s breasts had dried up from hunger ... Many women, hungry and exhausted, would leave their famished children on the roadside, and continue their tortuous journey. Some would go to nearby forests in search of something to eat. Usually they would not come back. Often those who died, served as food for the living.&quot;

Unable to maintain his army on the desolate plain, Sinan Pasha was forced to winter in Van. Armies sent in pursuit of the Shah in 1605 were defeated, and by 1606 Abbas had regained all of the territory lost to the Turks earlier in his reign. The scorched-earth tactic had worked, though at a terrible cost to the Armenian people. Of the 300,000 deported it is calculated that less than half survived the march to Isfahan. In the conquered territories Abbas established the Erivan Khanate, a Muslim principality under the dominion of the Safavid Empire. Armenians formed less than 20% of its population as a result of Shah Abbas I&#x27;s deportation of many of the Armenian population from the Ararat valley and the surrounding region in 1605.

An often-used policy by the Persians was the appointment of Turks as local rulers as so-called &quot;khans&quot; of their various &quot;khanates&quot;. These were counted as subordinate to the Persian Empire. Examples include: the Khanate of Erevan, Khanate of Nakhichevan and the Karabakh Khanate.

Even though Western Armenia had already once been conquered by the Ottomans following the Peace of Amasya, Greater Armenia was eventually decisively divided between the vying rivals, the Ottomans and the Safavids, in the first half of the 17th century following the Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–1639) and the resulting Treaty of Zuhab under which Eastern Armenia remained under Persian rule, and Western Armenia remained under Ottoman rule.

Persia continued to rule Eastern Armenia, which included all of the modern-day Armenian Republic, until the first half of the 19th century. By the late 18th century, Imperial Russia had started to encroach to the south into the land of its neighbours; Qajar Iran and Ottoman Turkey. In 1804, Pavel Tsitsianov invaded the Iranian town of Ganja and massacred many of its inhabitants while making the rest flee deeper within the borders of Qajar Iran. This was a declaration of war and regarded as an invasion of Iranian territory. It was the beginning of the Russo-Persian War (1804–1813). The following years were devastating for the Iranian towns in the Caucasus as well as the inhabitants of the region, as well as for the Persian army. The war eventually ended in 1813 with a Russian victory after their successful storming of Lankaran in early 1813. The Treaty of Gulistan that was signed in the same year forced Qajar Iran to irrevocably cede significant amounts of its Caucasian territories to Russia, comprising modern-day Dagestan, Georgia, and most of what is today the Republic of Azerbaijan. Karabakh was also ceded to Russia by Persia.

The Persians were severely dissatisfied with the outcome of the war which led to the ceding of so much Persian territory to the Russians. As a result, the next war between Russia and Persia was inevitable, namely the Russo-Persian War (1826–1828). However, this war ended even more disastrously, as the Russians not only occupied as far as Tabriz, the ensuing treaty that followed, namely the Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828, forced it to irrevocably cede its last remaining territories in the Caucasus, comprising all of modern-day Armenia, Nakhchivan and Iğdır Province.

By 1828, Persia had lost Eastern Armenia, which included the territory of the modern-day Armenian Republic after centuries of rule. From 1828 until 1991, Eastern Armenia would enter a Russian dominated chapter. Following Russia&#x27;s conquest of all of Qajar Iran&#x27;s Caucasian territories, many Armenian families were encouraged to settle in the newly conquered Russian territories.

===Ottoman Armenia===


Mehmed II conquered Constantinople from the Byzantines in 1453 and made it the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s capital. Mehmed and his successors used the religious systems of their subject nationalities as a method of population control, and so Ottoman Sultans invited an Armenian archbishop to establish the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Armenians of Constantinople grew in numbers, and became respected, if not full, members of Ottoman society.

The Ottoman Empire ruled in accordance to Islamic law. As such, the People of the Book (the Christians and the Jews) had to pay an extra tax to fulfil their status as dhimmi and in return were guaranteed religious autonomy. While the Armenians of Constantinople benefited from the Sultan&#x27;s support and grew to be a prospering community, the same could not be said about the ones inhabiting historic Armenia.

During times of crisis the ones in the remote regions of mountainous eastern Anatolia were mistreated by local Kurdish chiefs and feudal lords. They often also had to suffer (alongside the settled Muslim population) raids by nomadic Kurdish tribes. Armenians, like the other Ottoman Christians (though not to the same extent), had to transfer some of their healthy male children to the Sultan&#x27;s government due to the devşirme policies in place. The boys were then forced to convert to Islam (by threat of death otherwise) and educated to be fierce warriors in times of war, as well as Beys, Pashas and even Grand Viziers in times of peace.

The Armenian national liberation movement was the Armenian effort to free the historic Armenian homeland of eastern Anatolia and Transcaucasus from Russian and Ottoman domination and re-establish the independent Armenian state. The national liberation movement of the Balkan peoples and the immediate involvement of the European powers in the Eastern question had a powerful effect on the development of the national liberation ideology movement among the Armenians of the Ottoman Empire.

The Armenian national movement, besides its individual heroes, was an organized activity represented around three parties of Armenian people, Social Democrat Hunchakian Party, Armenakan and Armenian Revolutionary Federation, which ARF was the largest and most influential among the three. Those Armenians who did not support national liberation aspirations or who were neutral were called &quot;chezoks&quot;. In 1839, the situation of the Ottoman Armenians slightly improved after Abdul Mejid I carried out Tanzimat reforms in its territories. However, later Sultans, such as Abdul Hamid II stopped the reforms and carried out massacres, now known as the Hamidian massacres of 1895–96 leading to a failed Armenian attempt to assassinate him.

===Russian Armenia===

In the aftermath of the Russo-Persian War, 1826–1828, the parts of historic Armenia (also known as Eastern Armenia) under Persian control, centering on Yerevan and Lake Sevan, were incorporated into Russia after Qajar Persia&#x27;s forced ceding in 1828 per the Treaty of Turkmenchay. Under Russian rule, the area corresponding approximately to modern-day Armenian territory was called &quot;Province of Yerevan&quot;. The Armenian subjects of the Russian Empire lived in relative safety, compared to their Ottoman kin, albeit clashes with Tatars and Kurds were frequent in the early 20th century. Even though Russian Armenians benefited from the advanced Russian culture, and greater access to European thought, and broader economic initiative, they were denied equal educational and administrative opportunities like many other racial and religious minorities.

The Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828 had further stipulated the rights of the Russian tsar to resettle Persian Armenians within the newly conquered Caucasus region, which had been taken over from Iran. Following the resettlement of Persian Armenians alone in the newly conquered Russian territories, significant demographic shifts were bound to take place. The Armenian-American historian George Bournoutian gives a summary of the ethnic make-up after those events:

After the incorporation of the Erivan Khanate into the Russian Empire, Muslim majority of the area gradually changed, at first the Armenians who were left captive were encouraged to return. As a result of which an estimated 57,000 Armenian refugees from Persia returned to the territory of the Erivan Khanate after 1828, while about 35,000 Muslims (Persians, Turkic groups, Kurds, Lezgis, etc.) out of a total population of over 100,000 left the region.

==20th century==

===The Armenian genocide (1915–1921) and First World War===

In 1915, the Ottoman Empire systematically carried out the Armenian genocide. This genocide was preceded by a wave of massacres in the years 1894 to 1896, as well as another massacre in 1909 in Adana. On 24 April 1915, Ottoman authorities rounded up, arrested, and deported 235 to 270 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders from Constantinople to the region of Ankara, where the majority were murdered. The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases—the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly, and the infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian Desert. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre.

Most frequently, the exact number of deaths is estimated to have been 1.5 million, with other estimates ranging from 800,000 to 1,800,000. These events are traditionally commemorated yearly on 24 April, the Armenian Christian martyr day.

===First Republic of Armenia (1918–1920)===

Between the 4th and 19th centuries, the traditional area of Armenia was conquered and ruled by Persians, Byzantines, Arabs, Mongols, and Turks, among others. Parts of historical Armenia gained independence from the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire after the collapse of these two empires in the wake of the First World War.

====Transcaucasian Federation (1917–1918)====

During the Russian Revolution, the provinces of the Caucasus seceded and formed their own federal state called the Transcaucasian Federation. Competing national interests and war with Turkey led to the dissolution of the republic half a year later, in April 1918.

After the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the takeover of the Bolsheviks, Stepan Shaumyan was placed in charge of Russian Armenia. In September 1917, the convention in Tiflis elected the Armenian National Council, the first sovereign political body of Armenians since the collapse of Lesser Armenia in 1375. Meanwhile, both the Ittihad (Unionist) and the Nationalists moved to win the friendship of the Bolsheviks.

Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk) sent several delegations to Moscow in an attempt to win some support for his own post-Ottoman movement in what he saw as a modernised ethno-nationalist Turkey. This alliance proved disastrous for the Armenians. The signing of the Ottoman-Russian friendship treaty (1 January 1918) helped Vehib Pasha to attack the new republic. Under heavy pressure from the combined forces of the Ottoman army and the Kurdish irregulars, the Republic was forced to withdraw from Erzincan to Erzurum. In the end, the Republic had to evacuate Erzurum as well.

Further southeast, in Van, the Armenians resisted the Turkish army until April 1918, but eventually were forced to evacuate it and withdraw to Persia. Conditions deteriorated when Azerbaijani Tatars sided with the Turks and seized the Armenian&#x27;s lines of communication, thus cutting off the Armenian National Councils in Baku and Yerevan from the National Council in Tiflis. The First Republic of Armenia was established on 28 May 1918.

====Georgian–Armenian War (1918)====

During the final stages of World War I, the Armenians and Georgians had been defending against the advance of the Ottoman Empire. In June 1918, to forestall an Ottoman advance on Tiflis, the Georgian troops had occupied the Lori Province which at the time had a 75% Armenian majority.

After the Armistice of Mudros and the withdrawal of the Ottomans, the Georgian forces remained. The Georgian Menshevik parliamentarian Irakli Tsereteli suggested that the Armenians would be safer from the Turks as Georgian citizens. The Georgians offered a quadripartite conference comprising Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus to resolve the issue. The Armenians rejected this proposal. In December 1918, the Georgians were confronting a rebellion chiefly in the village of Uzunlar in the Lori region. Within days, hostilities commenced between the two republics.

The Georgian–Armenian War was a border war fought in 1918 between the Democratic Republic of Georgia and the First Republic of Armenia over the then disputed provinces of Lori and Javakheti which had been historically bi-cultural Armenian-Georgian territories, but were largely populated by Armenians in the 19th century.

====Armenian-Azerbaijan War====

A considerable degree of hostility existed between Armenia and its new neighbor to the east, the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan, stemming largely from racial, religious, cultural and societal differences. The Azeris had close ethnic and religious ties to the Turks and had provided material support for them in their drive to Baku in 1918. Although the borders of the two countries were still undefined, Azerbaijan claimed most of the territory Armenia was sitting on, demanding all or most parts of the former Russian provinces of Elizavetpol, Tiflis, Yerevan, Kars and Batum. As diplomacy failed to accomplish compromise, even with the mediation of the commanders of a British expeditionary force that had installed itself in the Caucasus, territorial clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan took place throughout 1919 and 1920, most notably in the regions of Nakhichevan, Karabakh, and Syunik (Zangezur). Repeated attempts to bring these provinces under Azerbaijani jurisdiction were met with fierce resistance by their Armenian inhabitants. In May 1919, Dro led an expeditionary unit that was successful in establishing Armenian administrative control in Nakhichevan.

=== Paris Peace Conference ===

At Paris Peace Conference in 1919 it was proposed to create large () Armenian state, including the territory of former Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia with total population of 4.3 million, 2.5 million of which would be Armenians.

====Treaty of Sèvres====

The Treaty of Sèvres was signed between the Allied and Associated Powers and Ottoman Empire at Sèvres, France, on 10 August 1920. The treaty included a clause on Armenia: it made all parties signing the treaty recognize Armenia as a free and independent state. The drawing of definite borders was, however, left to U.S. president Woodrow Wilson and the United States State Department, and was only presented to Armenia on 22 November 1920. The new borders gave Armenia access to the Black Sea and awarded large portions of the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire to the republic.

The Treaty of Sèvres was signed by the Ottoman government, but Sultan Mehmed VI never signed it and thus never came into effect. The Turkish Revolutionaries, led by Mustafa Kemal Pasha, began the Turkish National Movement which, in opposing any territorial concessions to either the Greeks or the Armenians.

====Turkish and Soviet Invasion====

On 20 September 1920, Turkish nationalist militants invaded the region of Sarikamish. In response, Armenia declared war on Turkey on 24 September and the Turkish invasion of Armenia (1920) began. In the regions of Oltu, Sarikamish, Kars, and Alexandropol (Gyumri), Armenian forces clashed with those of the Turkish armies. Mustafa Kemal Pasha had sent several delegations to Moscow in search of an alliance, where he had found a receptive response by the Soviet government, which started sending gold and weapons to the Turkish revolutionaries, which would prove disastrous for the Armenians.

Armenia gave way to communist power in late 1920. In November 1920, the Turkish revolutionaries captured Alexandropol and were poised to move in on the capital. A cease fire was concluded on 18 November. Negotiations were then carried out between Kâzım Karabekir and a peace delegation led by Alexander Khatisian in Alexandropol; although Karabekir&#x27;s terms were extremely harsh the Armenian delegation had little recourse but to agree to them. The Treaty of Alexandropol was signed on 3 December 1920, although the Armenian government had already fallen to the Soviets the day before.

As the terms of defeat were being negotiated, Bolshevik Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze invaded from Azerbaijan the First Republic of Armenia to establish a new pro-Bolshevik government in the country. The 11th Red Army began its virtually unopposed advance into Armenia on 29 November 1920 at Ijevan. The actual transfer of power took place on 2 December 1920 in Yerevan.

The Armenian leadership approved an ultimatum presented to it by the Soviet plenipotentiary Boris Legran. Armenia decided to join the Soviet sphere, while Soviet Russia agreed to protect its remaining territory from the advancing Turkish army. The Soviets also pledged to take steps to rebuild the army, protect the Armenians and to not pursue non-communist Armenians, although the final condition of this pledge was reneged when the Dashnaks were forced out of the country.

On 5 December, the Armenian Revolutionary Committee (&quot;Revkom&quot;, made up of mostly Armenians from Azerbaijan) also entered the city. Finally, on the following day, 6 December, Felix Dzerzhinsky&#x27;s Cheka entered Yerevan, thus effectively ending the existence of the Democratic Republic of Armenia. At that point what was left of Armenia was under the influence of the Bolsheviks.

Although the Bolsheviks succeeded in ousting the Turks from their positions in Armenia, they decided to establish peace with Turkey. In 1921, the Bolsheviks and the Turks signed the Treaty of Kars, in which Turkey ceded Adjara to the USSR in exchange for the Kars territory (today the Turkish provinces of Kars, Surmalu, and Ardahan). The land given to Turkey included the ancient city of Ani and Mount Ararat, the spiritual Armenian homeland. In 1922, the newly proclaimed Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, under the leadership of Alexander Miasnikyan, became part of the Soviet Union as one of three republics comprising the Transcaucasian SFSR.

===Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (1922–1991)===

The Transcaucasian SFSR was dissolved in 1936, and as a result Armenia became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union as the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. The transition to socialism was difficult for Armenia, and for most of the other republics in the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities placed Armenians under supervision. The rate of freedom of speech was considered low, even less so during secretaryship of Joseph Stalin. Any individual who was suspected of using or introducing nationalist, racist and conservative rhetoric or elements in their works were labelled traitors or propagandists, and were sent to prisons in Siberia. Even Zabel Yesayan, a writer who was fortunate enough to escape from ethnic cleansing during the Armenian genocide, was quickly exiled to Siberia after returning to Armenia from France.

Armenian SSR participated in World War II by sending hundreds of thousands of soldiers to the front line to defend the USSR. Marxist–Leninist system had several positive aspects. Armenia benefited from the Soviet economy, especially when it was at its apex. Provincial villages gradually became towns and towns gradually became cities. Peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan was reached, albeit temporarily. During this time, Armenia had a sizeable Azeri minority, mostly centred in Yerevan. Likewise, Azerbaijan had an Armenian minority, concentrated in Baku and Kirovabad.

Many Armenians still had nationalist and conservative sentiments, even though they were discouraged from expressing them publicly. On 24 April 1965, tens of thousands of Armenians flooded the streets of Yerevan to remind the world of the horrors that their parents and grandparents endured during the Armenian genocide of 1915. This was the first public demonstration of such high numbers in the USSR, which defended national interests rather than collective ones. In the late 1980s, Armenia was suffering from pollution. With Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s introduction of glasnost and perestroika, public demonstrations became more common. Thousands of Armenians demonstrated in Yerevan because of the USSR&#x27;s inability to address simple ecological concerns. Later on, with the conflict in Karabakh, the demonstrations obtained a more nationalistic flavour. Many Armenians began to demand statehood.

In 1988, the Spitak earthquake killed tens of thousands of people and destroyed multiple towns in northern Armenia, such as Leninakan (modern-day Gyumri) and Spitak. Many families were left without electricity and running water. The harsh situation caused by the earthquake and subsequent events made many residents of Armenia leave and settle in North America, Western Europe and Australia.

On 20 February 1988, interethnic fighting between the ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijanis broke out shortly after the parliament of Nagorno-Karabakh, an autonomous oblast in Azerbaijan, voted to unify the region with Armenia. The First Nagorno-Karabakh War pitted Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, backed by Armenia, against the Army of Azerbaijan.

==Independent Armenia (from 1991)==


Armenia declared its independence from the Soviet Union on 23 August 1990. Independence was confirmed by referendum on 21 September 1991. However, widespread recognition did not occur until the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union on 25 December 1991.

Armenia faced many challenges during its first years as a sovereign state. Several Armenian organizations from around the world quickly arrived to offer aid and to participate in the country&#x27;s early years. From Canada, a group of young students and volunteers under the CYMA - Canadian Youth Mission to Armenia banner arrived in Ararat Region and became the first youth organization to contribute to the newly independent Republic.

Following the Armenian victory in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, both Azerbaijan and Turkey closed their borders and imposed a blockade which they retain to this day, severely affecting the economy of the fledgling republic. In October 2009 Turkey and Armenia signed a treaty to normalize relations.

===Ter-Petrosyan presidency (1991–1998)===

Levon Ter-Petrosyan was popularly elected the first president of the newly independent Republic of Armenia on 16 October 1991 and re-elected on 22 September 1996. His re-election was marred by allegations of electoral fraud reported by the opposition and supported by many international observers. His popularity waned further as the opposition started blaming him for the economic quagmire that Armenia&#x27;s post-Soviet economy was in. He was also unpopular with one party in particular, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, which he banned and jailed on the grounds that the party had a foreign-based leadership—something which was forbidden according to the Armenian Constitution.

Ter-Petrosyan was forced to step down in February 1998 after advocating compromised settlement of the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh which many Armenians regarded as undermining their security. Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s key ministers, led by then-Prime Minister Robert Kocharyan, refused to accept a peace plan for Karabakh put forward by international mediators in September 1997. The plan, accepted by Ter-Petrosyan and Azerbaijan, called for a &quot;phased&quot; or &quot;step-by-step&quot; settlement of the conflict which would postpone an agreement on Nagorno-Karabakh&#x27;s status, the main stumbling block. That agreement was to accompany the return of most Armenian-occupied Azerbaijani territories around Nagorno-Karabakh and the lifting of the Azerbaijani and Turkish blockades of Armenia. In January 1998, Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s ministers forced Ter-Petrosyan to resign.

===Kocharyan presidency (1998–2008)===

After the resignation of his predecessor Levon Ter-Petrosyan, Robert Kocharyan was elected Armenia&#x27;s second president on 30 March 1998, defeating his main rival, Karen Demirchyan, in an early presidential election marred by irregularities and violations by both sides as reported by international electoral observers. Complaints included that Kocharyan had not been an Armenian citizen for ten years as required by the constitution. In early 1998, Kocharyan rejected the 1997 OSCE Minsk Group peace plan and initiated a new phase of Nagorno-Karabakh negotiations, where Heydar Aliyev and Kocharyan negotiated secret from their publics and senior officials. In 1999, they orally agreed to a land swap that would annex Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia in exchange for a strip of land connecting Azerbaijan and its exclave of Nakhichvan along the Iranian-Armenian border. In the fall of that year, Aliyev and Kocharyan informed the Minsk Group Co-Chairs of their plan and asked them to put it in writing.

Weeks later, several opposition leaders in the Armenian Parliament and the Prime Minister of Armenia were killed by gunmen in an episode known as the 1999 Armenian parliament shooting. Kocharyan himself negotiated with terrorists to lease the MP hostages. It is widely believed by Armenians at large that Kocharyan is responsible for the parliament shooting. Thereafter, Kocharyan informed the Minsk Group that he was not able to support the peace deal anymore.

The 2003 Armenian presidential election were held on 19 February and on 5 March 2003. No candidate received a majority in the first round of the election with the incumbent president Kocharyan winning slightly under 50% of the vote. Therefore, a second round was held and Kocharyan defeated Stepan Demirchyan with official results showed him winning just over 67% of the vote. In both rounds, electoral observers from the OSCE reported significant amounts of electoral fraud by Demirchyan&#x27;s supporters and numerous supporters of Demirchyan were arrested before the second round took place.

Demirchyan described the election as having been rigged and called on his supporters to rally against the results. Tens of thousands of Armenians protested in the days after the election against the results and called on President Kocharyan to step down. Kocharyan was sworn in for a second term in early April and the constitutional court upheld the election, while recommending that a referendum be held within a year to confirm the election result.

As president, Kocharyan continued to negotiate a peaceful resolution with Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. Talks between Aliyev and Kocharyan were held in September 2004 in Astana, Kazakhstan, on the sidelines of the CIS summit. Reportedly, one of the suggestions put forward was the withdrawal of Armenian forces from the Azeri territories adjacent to Nagorno-Karabakh, and holding referendums (plebiscites) in Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan proper regarding the future status of the region. On 10–11 February 2006, Kocharyan and Aliyev met in Rambouillet, France to discuss the fundamental principles of a settlement to the conflict, including the withdrawal of troops, formation of international peace keeping troops, and the status of Nagorno-Karabakh.

Contrary to the initial optimism, the Rambouillet talks did not produce any agreement, with key issues such as the status of Nagorno-Karabakh and whether Armenian troops would withdraw from Kalbajar still being contentious. The next session of the talks was held in March 2006 in Washington, D.C. Russian president Vladimir Putin applied pressure to both parties to settle the disputes. No progress arose from further meetings in Minsk and Moscow in November 2006.

===Sargsyan presidency (2008–2018)===

Serzh Sargsyan, then Prime Minister of Armenia and having President Kocharyan&#x27;s backing, was viewed as the strongest contender for the post of President of Armenia in the February 2008 presidential election.

Ter-Petrosyan officially announced his candidacy in the 2008 presidential election in a speech in Yerevan on 26 October 2007. He accused Kocharyan&#x27;s government of massive corruption, involving the theft of &quot;at least three to four billion dollars&quot; over the previous five years. He was critical of the government&#x27;s claims of strong economic growth and argued that Kocharyan and his Prime Minister, Serzh Sargsyan, had come to accept a solution to the problem of Nagorno-Karabakh that was effectively the same solution that he had proposed ten years earlier. A number of opposition parties have rallied behind him since his return to the political arena, including the People&#x27;s Party of Armenia, led by Stepan Demirchyan; the Armenian Republic Party, led by Aram Sargsyan; the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party; Azadakrum, led by Jirair Sefilian; the New Times Party; and the Heritage Party, led by Raffi Hovannisian.


Final results from the election, which was held on 19 February 2008, officially showed Sargsyan winning about 53% of the vote, and Ter-Petrosyan in second place with 21.5% of the vote.

Ter-Petrosyan and his supporters accused the government of rigging the election and claimed victory; beginning 20 February, he led continuous protests involving tens of thousands of his supporters in Yerevan.

On the early morning of 1 March, reportedly acting on evidence of firearms in the camp, the authorities moved in to inspect the tents set up by demonstrators. Law enforcement agents then violently dispersed the hundreds of protestors camped in. Ter-Petrosyan was placed under de facto house arrest, not being allowed to leave his home, though the authorities later denied the allegations.

A few hours later, tens of thousands of protestors or more gathered at Miyasnikyan Square to protest the government&#x27;s act. Police, overwhelmed by the sheer size of the crowd, pulled out. A state of emergency was implemented by President Kocharyan at 5 pm, allowing the army to be moved into the capital. By nightfall, a few thousand protesters had barricaded themselves using commandeered municipal buses. As a result of skirmishes with the police, ten people died, including policemen.

This was followed by mass arrests and purges of prominent members of the opposition, as well as a &quot;de facto ban&quot; on any further anti-government protests. Sargsyan was recognized as legitimate president

On 10 October 2009, the Turkish-Armenian protocols on the establishment of diplomatic relations constituted a novelty in Turkish-Armenian relations. Sargsyan accepted the proposal of studying the issue of the Armenian genocide through a commission, and recognized the current Turkish-Armenian border. In 2009–10, the Azerbaijan&#x27;s military build-up along with increasing war rhetoric and threats risked causing renewed problems in the South Caucasus.

In 2011, protests erupted in Armenia as part of the revolutionary wave sweeping through the Middle East. Protesters continue to demand an investigation into the 2008 violence, the release of political prisoners, an improvement in socioeconomic conditions, and the institution of democratic reforms. The Armenian National Congress and Heritage have been influential in organizing and leading protests.

Between 1 and 5 April 2016, there were renewed clashes between Armenian and Azerbaijani armed forces. (see 2016 Armenian–Azerbaijani clashes).

In March 2018, Sargsyan was re-elected Prime Minister, despite opposition protests. After military forces joined the protests on 23 April, Sargsyan resigned his position. Former Prime Minister Karen Karapetyan succeeded Sargsyan as acting Prime Minister.

=== Nikol Pashinyan premiership (2018–present) ===
In March 2018, Armenian parliament elected Armen Sarkissian as the new president of Armenia. The controversial constitutional reform to reduce presidential power was implemented, while the authority of the prime minister was strengthened. In May 2018, parliament elected opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan as the new prime minister. His predecessor Serzh Sargsyan resigned two weeks earlier following widespread anti-government demonstrations.

On 27 September 2020, a full-scale war erupted due to the unresolved Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Both the armed forces of Armenia and Azerbaijan reported military and civilian casualties. A ceasefire agreement was signed on 10 November, in which the occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh were handed over to Azerbaijan. Protests were held in Armenia over this and hundreds stormed the Parliament building in Yerevan. Protests continued throughout November, with demonstrations in Yerevan and other cities demanding the resignation of Pashinyan.

On 25 February 2021, The Armenian military called for Pashinyan to resign. The declaration, which Pashinyan described as a coup attempt, caused a political crisis that ended with the Chief of the General Staff of the Armenian Armed Forces Onik Gasparyan&#x27;s dismissal. On 25 April 2021, Pashinyan announced his formal resignation from his post of prime minister to allow snap parliamentary elections in June. He continued to act as interim prime minister in the leadup to the election. His party won the 2021 election, receiving more than half of all votes. Nikol Pashinyan was officially appointed Armenia&#x27;s prime minister. On 23 January 2022, Armen Sarkissian left the office, saying the constitution does not any more give the president sufficient powers to influence. On 3 March 2022, Vahagn Khachaturyan was elected as the fifth president of Armenia in the second round of parliamentary vote.

<text>In number theory, an additive function is an arithmetic function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) of the positive integer variable &quot;n&quot; such that whenever &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are coprime, the function applied to the product &quot;ab&quot; is the sum of the values of the function applied to &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;:
formula_1

== Completely additive ==
An additive function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is said to be completely additive if formula_2 holds &quot;for all&quot; positive integers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, even when they are not coprime. Totally additive is also used in this sense by analogy with totally multiplicative functions. If &quot;f&quot; is a completely additive function then &quot;f&quot;(1) = 0.

Every completely additive function is additive, but not vice versa.

== Examples ==

Examples of arithmetic functions which are completely additive are:

* The restriction of the logarithmic function to formula_3
* The multiplicity of a prime factor &quot;p&quot; in &quot;n&quot;, that is the largest exponent &quot;m&quot; for which &quot;pm&quot; divides &quot;n&quot;.
* &quot;a&quot;0(&quot;n&quot;) – the sum of primes dividing &quot;n&quot; counting multiplicity, sometimes called sopfr(&quot;n&quot;), the potency of &quot;n&quot; or the integer logarithm of &quot;n&quot; . For example:

::&quot;a&quot;0(4) = 2 + 2 = 4
::&quot;a&quot;0(20) = &quot;a&quot;0(22 · 5) = 2 + 2 + 5 = 9
::&quot;a&quot;0(27) = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9
::&quot;a&quot;0(144) = &quot;a&quot;0(24 · 32) = &quot;a&quot;0(24) + &quot;a&quot;0(32) = 8 + 6 = 14
::&quot;a&quot;0(2000) = &quot;a&quot;0(24 · 53) = &quot;a&quot;0(24) + &quot;a&quot;0(53) = 8 + 15 = 23
::&quot;a&quot;0(2003) = 2003
::&quot;a&quot;0(54,032,858,972,279) = 1240658
::&quot;a&quot;0(54,032,858,972,302) = 1780417
::&quot;a&quot;0(20,802,650,704,327,415) = 1240681

* The function Ω(&quot;n&quot;), defined as the total number of prime factors of &quot;n&quot;, counting multiple factors multiple times, sometimes called the &quot;Big Omega function&quot; . For example;

::Ω(1) = 0, since 1 has no prime factors
::Ω(4) = 2
::Ω(16) = Ω(2·2·2·2) = 4
::Ω(20) = Ω(2·2·5) = 3
::Ω(27) = Ω(3·3·3) = 3
::Ω(144) = Ω(24 · 32) = Ω(24) + Ω(32) = 4 + 2 = 6
::Ω(2000) = Ω(24 · 53) = Ω(24) + Ω(53) = 4 + 3 = 7
::Ω(2001) = 3
::Ω(2002) = 4
::Ω(2003) = 1
::Ω(54,032,858,972,279) = Ω(11 ⋅ 19932 ⋅ 1236661) = 4
::Ω(54,032,858,972,302) = Ω(2 ⋅ 72 ⋅ 149 ⋅ 2081 ⋅ 1778171) = 6 
::Ω(20,802,650,704,327,415) = Ω(5 ⋅ 7 ⋅ 112 ⋅ 19932 ⋅ 1236661) = 7.

Examples of arithmetic functions which are additive but not completely additive are:

* ω(&quot;n&quot;), defined as the total number of distinct prime factors of &quot;n&quot; . For example:

::ω(4) = 1
::ω(16) = ω(24) = 1

== Multiplicative functions ==

From any additive function formula_4 it is possible to create a related formula_5 which is a function with the property that whenever formula_6 and formula_7 are coprime then:
formula_8
One such example is formula_9 Likewise if formula_4 is completely additive, then formula_11 is completely multiplicative. More generally, we could consider the function formula_12, where formula_13 is a nonzero real constant.

== Summatory functions ==

Given an additive function formula_14, let its summatory function be defined by formula_15. The average of formula_14 is given exactly as
formula_17

The summatory functions over formula_14 can be expanded as formula_19 where
formula_20

The average of the function formula_21 is also expressed by these functions as
formula_22

There is always an absolute constant formula_23 such that for all natural numbers formula_24,
formula_25

Let
formula_26

Suppose that formula_14 is an additive function with formula_28 
such that as formula_29,
formula_30

Then formula_31 where formula_32 is the Gaussian distribution function
formula_33

Examples of this result related to the prime omega function and the numbers of prime divisors of shifted primes include the following for fixed formula_34 where the relations hold for formula_35:
formula_36 
formula_37

<text>Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham (4 September 1455 – 2 November 1483) was an English nobleman known as the namesake of Buckingham&#x27;s rebellion, a failed but significant collection of uprisings in England and parts of Wales against Richard III of England in October 1483. He was executed without trial for his role in the uprisings. Stafford is also one of the primary suspects in the disappearance (and presumed murder) of Richard&#x27;s nephews, the Princes in the Tower.

== Life ==
The only son of Humphrey Stafford, Earl of Stafford and Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Stafford, Buckingham became Earl of Stafford in 1458 upon his father&#x27;s death, and was made a ward of King Edward IV. He became the Duke of Buckingham at age 4 in 1460 following the death of his grandfather, Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham at the Battle of Northampton. In February 1466, at age 10, he was married to Katherine Woodville, youngest sister of Edward IV&#x27;s wife Elizabeth Woodville, and daughter to Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers; she was only around 8 at the time. Buckingham and his wife had five children:

* Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham (3 February 1478 – 17 May 1521)
* Elizabeth Stafford, Countess of Sussex (c. 1479 – 11 May 1532)
* Henry Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire (c. 1479 – 6 April 1523)
* Anne Stafford, Countess of Huntingdon (c. 1483 – 1544)
* Humphrey Stafford (died young)

Upon the death of Edward IV in 1483, Buckingham allied himself to the king&#x27;s younger brother the Duke of Gloucester, helping him succeed to the throne as Richard III in lieu of Edward and Elizabeth&#x27;s living sons Edward V and Richard of Shrewsbury. Becoming disaffected with Richard, Buckingham then joined with Henry Tudor and Tudor&#x27;s mother, Margaret Beaufort, leading an unsuccessful rebellion in his name. For his part, Buckingham raised a militia from his estates in Wales and the Marches, which he was to lead into England to join other rebels; but the rivers Wye and Severn were in flood and impassable, and after waiting ten days his men dispersed. Buckingham fled in disguise into Shropshire but was discovered hidden at Lacon Park near Wem, having been betrayed by a retainer, Ralph Bannister.

Buckingham was executed for treason by Richard on 2 November 1483: he was beheaded in the courtyard between the Blue Boar Inn and the Saracen&#x27;s Head Inn (both demolished in the 18th century) in Salisbury market-place. His burial place is uncertain; a tomb inside the parish church at Britford, near Salisbury, may be his.

Buckingham&#x27;s precise motivation has been called &quot;obscure&quot;; he had been treated well by Richard. The traditional naming of the rebellion after him has been labelled a misnomer, with John Morton and Reginald Bray more plausible leaders.

==The Princes in the Tower==
As Richard III&#x27;s ally, the plausibility of Buckingham as a suspect depends on the princes having already been dead by the time Stafford was executed in November 1483. It has been suggested that Buckingham had several potential motives. As a descendant of Edward III, through John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster and Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester on his father&#x27;s side, as well as through John of Gaunt through John Beaufort, son of John of Gaunt on his mother&#x27;s side, Buckingham may have hoped to accede to the throne himself in due course; alternatively, he may have been acting on behalf of a third party.

Some, notably Paul Murray Kendall, regard Buckingham as the likeliest suspect: his execution, after he had rebelled against Richard in October 1483, might signify that he and the king had fallen out; Alison Weir takes this as a sign that Richard had murdered the princes without Buckingham&#x27;s knowledge and Buckingham had been shocked by it. A contemporary Portuguese document suggests Buckingham as the guilty party, stating, ... and after the passing away of king Edward in the year of 83, another one of his brothers, the Duke of Gloucester, had in his power the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York, the young sons of the said king his brother, and turned them to the Duke of Buckingham, under whose custody the said Princes were starved to death.

A document dated some decades after the disappearance was found within the archives of the College of Arms in London in 1980; this stated that the murder &quot;be the vise of the Duke of Buckingham&quot;. This led Michael Bennett to suggest that possibly some of Richard&#x27;s prominent supporters, Buckingham and Tyrell, murdered the princes on their own initiative without waiting for Richard&#x27;s orders. Bennett noted in support of this theory: &quot;After the King&#x27;s departure Buckingham was in effective command in the capital, and it is known that when the two men met a month later there was an unholy row between them.&quot;

Buckingham is the only person to be named as responsible in a contemporary chronicle other than Richard himself. However, for two reasons he is unlikely to have acted alone. First of all, if he were guilty of acting without Richard&#x27;s orders it is extremely surprising that Richard did not lay the blame for the princes&#x27; murder on Buckingham after Buckingham was disgraced and executed, especially as Richard could potentially have cleared his own name by doing so. Secondly, it is likely he would have required Richard&#x27;s help to gain access to the princes, under close guard in the Tower of London, although Kendall argued that, as Constable of England, responsible for the Tower, he might have been exempt from this ruling.

As a result, although it is extremely possible that he was implicated in the decision to murder them, the hypothesis that Buckingham acted without Richard&#x27;s knowledge is not widely accepted by historians. While Jeremy Potter suggested that Richard would have kept silent had Buckingham been guilty because nobody would have believed Richard was not party to the crime, he further notes that &quot;Historians are agreed that Buckingham would never have dared to act without Richard&#x27;s complicity or, at least, connivance&quot;. However, Potter also hypothesised that perhaps Buckingham was fantasising about seizing the crown himself at this point and saw the murder of the princes as a first step to achieving this goal. This theory formed the basis of Sharon Penman&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Sunne in Splendour&quot;.

==In fiction==
Buckingham is among the major characters featured in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot;, which portrays him as a man openly allying with Richard III in his schemes until he is ordered to kill the Princes in the Tower. In Colley Cibber&#x27;s 1699 adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s play, he is the subject of the notable line &quot;Off with his head! So much for Buckingham!&quot;

In Sharon Kay Penman&#x27;s 1982 debut novel &quot;The Sunne in Splendour&quot;, Buckingham is depicted as the murderer of the Princes in the Tower. He is a supporting character in Philippa Gregory&#x27;s 2009 historical novel &quot;The White Queen&quot; (2009) and a central character in Susan Higginbotham&#x27;s historical fiction novel, &quot;The Stolen Crown&quot; (2010), which deals with his associations with King Edward IV and King Richard III.

Buckingham is the major character and storyteller in Isolde Martyn’s historical novel &quot;The Devil in Ermine&quot; (2013), which deals with the events of 1483. As Henry Stafford, he is the lead character in J. P. Reedman&#x27;s &quot;A Man Who Would be King&quot; (2017), which tells his story from his own first-person viewpoint, and portrays him as desiring the throne for himself.

<text>Generally Accepted Accounting Practice in the UK, or UK GAAP or GAAP (UK), is the overall body of regulation establishing how company accounts must be prepared in the United Kingdom. Company accounts must also be prepared in accordance with applicable company law (for UK companies, the Companies Act 2006; for companies in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, companies law applicable to those jurisdictions).

Generally accepted accounting practice is a statutory term in the UK Taxes Acts. The abbreviation &quot;GAAP&quot; is also accepted as an abbreviation for the term used in other jurisdictions, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or Generally Accepted Accounting Policies.

== History ==
Accounting standards derive from a number of sources. The chief standard-setter is the Accounting Standards Board (ASB), which issues standards called &quot;Financial Reporting Standards&quot; (FRS). The ASB is part of the Financial Reporting Council, an independent regulator funded by a levy on listed companies, and it replaced the Accounting Standards Committee (ASC), which was disbanded in 1990 following a number of criticisms of its work. To the extent that the ASC&#x27;s pronouncements, known as &quot;Statements of Standard Accounting Practice&quot; (SSAPs), have not been replaced by FRS, they remain in force.

== Process for setting standards==
The ASB has a formal exposure process for proposed standards. Early concepts are issued as &quot;Discussion Papers&quot;. These are released to the public and comments invited. Where a new standard is to be proposed, a &quot;Financial Reporting Exposure Draft&quot; (FRED) is released for comment. The standard in final form is only issued when comments have been incorporated or addressed. This aims to address the criticisms levelled at the ASC, whose comment process was less rigorous.

Issues that require an immediate solution are considered by the &quot;Urgent Issues Task Force&quot; (UITF). The UITF comprises a number of senior figures from industry and accounting firms. It meets as necessary to consider pressing issues and issues &quot;Abstracts&quot; which become binding immediately.

== Legislation ==
The principal legislation governing reporting in the UK is laid down in the Companies Act 2006, which incorporates the requirements of European law. The Companies Act sets out certain minimum reporting requirements for companies and, for example, requires limited companies to file their accounts with the Registrar of Companies who makes them available to the general public.

From 2005, this framework changed as a result of European law requiring that all listed European companies report under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In the UK, companies which are not listed have the option to report either under IFRS or under UK GAAP. Recently issued UK FRSs have, in any case replicated the wording of corresponding IFRS, reducing the differences between the two sets of standards significantly.

== New UK GAAP ==
A new financial reporting framework came into effect in the UK on 1 January 2015.

The UK&#x27;s Financial Reporting Council (FRC) published five standards which together form the basis of the new UK regime. The Financial Reporting Standard for Smaller Entities will continue to be available for those that qualify to use it and will remain fundamentally unaltered for the time being.

In March 2013 the FRC (now responsible for issuing accounting standards in the UK) issued FRS 102, The Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. This followed the issue of FRS 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements and FRS 101 The Reduced Disclosure Framework in November 2012. Together these standards make up what is commonly being referred to by accountants as new UK GAAP, which takes mandatory effect for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015.

FRS 102 replaces almost 3000 pages of current UK and Ireland GAAP with just over 300. The main purpose is to make reporting requirements proportionate to the size of the entity, and it also includes changes to disclosure, measurement, and recognition.

<doc id="87382" wikidata="Q4375752" url="?curid=87382" title="Human rights in the Soviet Union">
<text>[[Human rights]] in the [[Soviet Union]] were severely limited. The Soviet Union was a totalitarian state from 1927 until 1953 and a one-party state until 1990. Freedom of speech was suppressed and dissent was punished. Independent political activities were not tolerated, whether they involved participation in free labor unions, private corporations, independent churches or opposition political parties. The citizens&#x27; freedom of movement was limited both inside and outside the country.

In practice, the Soviet government significantly curbed the very powerful rule of law, civil liberties, protection of law and guarantees of property, which were considered examples of &quot;bourgeois morality&quot; by Soviet legal theorists such as Andrey Vyshinsky. The Soviet Union signed legally-binding human rights documents, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1973, but they were neither widely known or accessible to people living under Communist rule, nor were they taken seriously by the Communist authorities. Human rights activists in the Soviet Union were regularly subjected to harassment, repressions and arrests.

==Soviet concept of human rights and legal system==

According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, human rights are the &quot;basic rights and freedoms to which all humans are entitled.&quot; including the right to life and liberty, freedom of expression, and equality before the law; and social, cultural and economic rights, including the right to participate in culture, the right to food, the right to work, and the right to education.

The Soviet conception of human rights was very different from international law. According to Soviet legal theory, &quot;it is the government who is the beneficiary of human rights which are to be asserted &quot;against&quot; the individual&quot;. The Soviet state was considered as the source of human rights. Therefore, the Soviet legal system considered law an arm of politics and it also considered courts agencies of the government. Extensive extrajudicial powers were given to the Soviet secret police agencies. In practice, the Soviet government significantly curbed the rule of law, civil liberties, protection of law and guarantees of property, which were considered as examples of &quot;bourgeois morality&quot; by Soviet law theorists such as Andrey Vyshinsky.

The USSR and other countries in the Soviet Bloc had abstained from affirming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), saying that it was &quot;overly juridical&quot; and potentially infringed on national sovereignty. The Soviet Union later signed legally-binding human rights documents, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1973 (and the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), but they were neither widely known or accessible to people living under Communist rule, nor were they taken seriously by the Communist authorities. Under Joseph Stalin, the death penalty was extended to adolescents as young as 12 years old in 1935.

Sergei Kovalev recalled &quot;the famous article 125 of the Constitution which enumerated all basic civil and political rights&quot; in the Soviet Union. But when he and other prisoners attempted to use this as a legal basis for their abuse complaints, their prosecutor&#x27;s argument was that &quot;the Constitution was written not for you, but for American Negroes, so that they know how happy the lives of Soviet citizens are&quot;.

Crime was determined not as the infraction of law, instead, it was determined as any action which could threaten the Soviet state and society. For example, a desire to make a profit could be interpreted as a counter-revolutionary activity punishable by death. The liquidation and deportation of millions of peasants in 1928–31 was carried out within the terms of the Soviet Civil Code. Some Soviet legal scholars even said that &quot;criminal repression&quot; may be applied in the absence of guilt. Martin Latsis, chief of Soviet Ukraine&#x27;s secret police explained: &quot;Do not look in the file of incriminating evidence to see whether or not the accused rose up against the Soviets with arms or words. Ask him instead to which class he belongs, what is his background, his education, his profession. These are the questions that will determine the fate of the accused. That is the meaning and essence of the Red Terror.&quot;

The purpose of public trials was &quot;not to demonstrate the existence or absence of a crime – that was predetermined by the appropriate party authorities – but to provide yet another forum for political agitation and propaganda for the instruction of the citizenry (see Moscow Trials for example). Defense lawyers, who had to be party members, were required to take their client&#x27;s guilt for granted...&quot;

==Freedom of political expression==

In the 1930s and 1940s, political repression was widely practiced by the Soviet secret police services, OGPU and NKVD. An extensive network of civilian informants – either volunteers, or those forcibly recruited – was used to collect intelligence for the government and report cases of suspected dissent.

Its theoretical basis was the theory of Marxism concerning class struggle. The terms &quot;repression&quot;, &quot;terror&quot;, and other strong words were official working terms, since the dictatorship of the proletariat was supposed to suppress the resistance of other social classes, which Marxism considered antagonistic to the class of the proletariat. The legal basis of the repression was formalized into Article 58 in the code of the RSFSR and similar articles for other Soviet republics. Aggravation of class struggle under socialism was proclaimed during the Stalinist terror.

==Freedom of literary and scientific expression==

Censorship in the Soviet Union was pervasive and strictly enforced. This gave rise to Samizdat, a clandestine copying and distribution of government-suppressed literature. Art, literature, education, and science were placed under strict ideological scrutiny, since they were supposed to serve the interests of the victorious proletariat. Socialist realism is an example of such teleologically oriented art that promoted socialism and communism. All humanities and social sciences were tested for strict accordance with historical materialism.

All natural sciences were to be founded on the philosophical base of dialectical materialism. Many scientific disciplines, such as genetics, cybernetics, and comparative linguistics, were suppressed in the Soviet Union during some periods, condemned as &quot;bourgeois pseudoscience&quot;. At one point Lysenkoism, which many consider a pseudoscience, was favored in agriculture and biology. In the 1930s and 1940s, many prominent scientists were declared to be &quot;wreckers&quot; or enemies of the people and imprisoned. Some scientists worked as prisoners in &quot;Sharashkas&quot; (research and development laboratories within the Gulag labor camp system).

According to the Soviet Criminal Code, agitation or propaganda carried on for the purpose of weakening Soviet authority, or circulating materials or literature that defamed the Soviet State and social system were punishable by imprisonment for a term of 2–5 years; for a second offense, punishable for a term of 3–10 years.

==Right to vote==

According to communist ideologists, the Soviet political system was a true democracy, where workers&#x27; councils (&quot;soviets&quot;) represented the will of the working class. In particular, the Soviet Constitution of 1936 guaranteed direct universal suffrage with a secret ballot. Practice, however, departed from principle. For example, all candidates were selected by Communist Party organizations, until democratization and the March 1989 elections. Historian Robert Conquest described the Soviet electoral system as &quot;a set of phantom institutions and arrangements which put a human face on the hideous realities: a model constitution adopted in a worst period of terror and guaranteeing human rights, elections in which there was only one candidate, and in which 99 percent voted; a parliament at which no hand was ever raised in opposition or abstention.&quot;

==Economic rights==
Personal property was allowed with limitations. Real property mostly belonged to the State. Many forms of private trade with the intent of gaining profit were considered &quot;speculation&quot; () and banned as a criminal offense to be punished with fines, imprisonment, confiscation and/or corrective labor. &quot;Speculation&quot; was specifically defined in article 154 of the Penal Code of the USSR. Health, housing, education, and nutrition were formally guaranteed through the provision of full employment and economic welfare structures, but these guarantees were rarely met in practice. For instance, over five million people lacked adequate nutrition and starved to death during the Soviet famine of 1932–1933, one of several Soviet famines. The 1932–33 famine was caused primarily by Soviet-mandated collectivization, although the famine in part was also caused by natural conditions. In response to frequent shortages, massive second economy existed for all categories of goods and services.

==Freedoms of assembly and association==
Workers were not allowed to organize free unions. All existing unions were organized and controlled by the state. All political youth organizations, such as Pioneer movement and Komsomol served to enforce the policies of the Communist Party. Participation in unauthorized political organizations could result in imprisonment. Organizing in camps could bring the death penalty.

==Freedom of religion==
The Soviet Union promoted Marxist-Leninist atheism and persecuted religion. Toward that end, the Communist regime confiscated church property, ridiculed religion, harassed believers, and propagated atheism in the schools. Actions toward particular religions, however, were determined by State interests, and most organized religions were never outlawed outright.

Some actions against Orthodox priests and believers included torture; being sent to prison camps, labour camps, or mental hospitals; and execution. Many Orthodox (along with peoples of other faiths) were also subjected to psychological punishment or torture and mind control experimentation in an attempt to force them give up their religious convictions (see Punitive psychiatry in the Soviet Union).

Practicing Orthodox Christians were restricted from prominent careers and membership in communist organizations (e.g. the party and the Komsomol). Anti-religious propaganda was openly sponsored and encouraged by the government, to which the Church was not given an opportunity to publicly respond. Seminaries were closed down, and the church was restricted from publishing materials. Atheism was propagated through schools, communist organizations, and the media. Organizations such as the Society of the Godless were created.

==Freedom of movement==

Emigration and any travel abroad were not allowed without explicit permission from the government. People who were not allowed to leave the country and campaigned for their right to leave in the 1970s were known as &quot;refuseniks&quot;. In the Soviet Criminal Code, a refusal to return from abroad was treason, punishable by imprisonment for a term of 10–15 years, or by death with confiscation of property.

The passport system in the Soviet Union restricted migration of citizens within the country through the &quot;propiska&quot; (residential permit/registration system) and the use of internal passports. For a long period of Soviet history, peasants did not have internal passports, and could not move into towns without permission. Many former inmates received &quot;wolf tickets&quot; and were only allowed to live a minimum of 101 km away from city borders. Travel to closed cities and to the regions near USSR state borders was strongly restricted. An attempt to illegally escape abroad was punishable by imprisonment for 1–3 years.

== Human rights movement ==
Human rights activists in the Soviet Union were regularly subjected to harassment, repressions and arrests. In several cases, only the public profile of individual human rights campaigners such as Andrei Sakharov helped prevent a complete shutdown of the movement&#x27;s activities.

A more organized human rights movement in the USSR grew out of the current of dissent of the late 1960s and 1970s known as &quot;rights defenders (&quot;pravozashchitniki&quot;). Its most important samizdat publication, the &quot;Chronicle of Current Events&quot;, circulated its first number 
in April 1968, after the United Nations declared that it would be the International Year for Human Rights (20 years since Universal Declaration was issued), and continued for the next 15 years until closed down in 1983.

A succession of dedicated human rights groups were set up after 1968: the Action Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR went public in May 1969 with an appeal to the UN Human Rights Committee; the Committee on Human Rights in the USSR was established in 1970; and a Soviet section of Amnesty International appeared in 1973. The groups variously wrote appeals, collected signatures for petitions, and attended trials.

The eight member countries of the Warsaw Pact signed the Helsinki Final Act in August 1975. The &quot;third basket&quot; of the Final Act included extensive human rights clauses. In the years 1976–77, several &quot;Helsinki Watch Groups&quot; emerged in the USSR, to monitor the Soviet Union&#x27;s compliance with the Helsinki Final Act. The first group was the Moscow Helsinki Group, followed by groups in Ukraine, Lithuania, Georgia and Armenia. They succeeded in unifying different branches of the human rights movement. Similar initiatives began in Soviet satellite states, such as Charter 77 in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.

Over the next two years the Helsinki Groups would be harassed and threatened by the Soviet authorities and eventually forced to close down their activities, as leading activists were arrested, put on trial and imprisoned or pressured into leaving the country. By 1979, all had ceased to function.

==Perestroika and human rights==

The period from April 1985 to December 1991 witnessed dramatic change in the USSR.

In February 1987 KGB Chairman Victor Chebrikov reported to Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev that 288 people were serving sentences for offenses committed under Articles 70, 190-1 and 142 of the RSFSR Criminal Code; a third of those convicted were being held in psychiatric hospitals. Most were released during the course of the year, spurred on by the death in prison of veteran dissident Anatoly Marchenko in December 1986. Soon ethnic minorities, confessional groups and entire nations were asserting their rights, respectively, to cultural autonomy, freedom of religion and, led by the Baltic states, to national independence.

Just as glasnost did not represent &quot;freedom of speech&quot;, so attempts by activists to hold their own events and create independent associations and political movements met with disapproval and obstruction from Gorbachev and his Politburo. Early in December 1987 Shevardnadze, Yakovlev and Chebrikov reported on a proposed human rights seminar to be held in Moscow on 10–14 December 1987 with guests from abroad, and suggested ways of undermining, restricting and containing the event organised by former Soviet dissidents. The reaction to a similar proposal seven months later was much the same. As they conceded more and more of the rights over which the Communists had established their monopoly in the 1920s, events and organisations not initiated or overseen by the regime were frowned on and discouraged by the supposedly liberal authorities of the brief and ambivalent period of perestroika and official glasnost.

In the remaining two and a half years the rate of change accelerated. The Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies held its second autumnal session in 1989 during a nationwide miners&#x27; strike. One consequence was the abolition in March 1990 of Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution (1977), which had explicitly established the primacy of the Communist Party within the Soviet State, a hitherto unspoken but all-pervasive dominance of the system.

The authorities formed units of riot police OMON to deal with the mounting protests and rallies across the USSR. In Moscow, these culminated in a vast demonstration in January 1991, denouncing the actions of Gorbachev and his administration. The demonstrations in Lithuania, Tbilisi, Baku and Tajikistan have been suppressed resulting in deaths of many protesters.

<doc id="87384" wikidata="Q44344" url="?curid=87384" title="Hilary of Poitiers">
<text>Hilary of Poitiers (; ) was Bishop of Poitiers and a Doctor of the Church. He was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Hammer of the Arians&quot; () and the &quot;Athanasius of the West&quot;. His name comes from the Latin word for happy or cheerful. In addition to his important work as bishop, Hilary was married and the father of Abra of Poitiers, a nun and saint who became known for her charity.

==Early life==
Hilary was born at Poitiers either at the end of the 3rd or beginning of the 4th century A.D. His parents were pagans of distinction. He received a good education, which included a high level of Greek. He studied, later on, the Old and New Testament writings, with the result that he abandoned his Neoplatonism for Christianity, and with his wife and his daughter, traditionally known as Saint Abra of Poitiers, was baptized and received into the Church.

Arianism was becoming popular among Christians in this era and this theological position was supported by Constantine the Great. There were a series of violent battles between Trinitarians and Arians. [cite source]

In 353, the Trinitarian Christians of Arles elected Hilary as bishop as the existing bishop, Saturninus of Arles, was an Arian. At the Council of Arles, the legates of Pope Liberius refused to condemn Arianism and considered formally opposing Athanasius of Alexandria, who was a strong advocate of Trinitarianism against Arianism. Hilary still managed to secure the local excommunication, by those of the Gallican hierarchy who were his allies, of Bishop Saturninus and two of his prominent supporters, Bishops Ursacius of Singidunum and Valens of Mursa.

About the same time, Hilary wrote to Emperor Constantius II a remonstrance against the persecutions by which the Arians had sought to crush their opponents (&quot;Ad Constantium Augustum liber primus&quot;, of which the most probable date is 355). Other historians refer to this first book to Constantius as the &quot;Book Against Valens&quot;, of which only fragments are extant. His efforts did not succeed at first, for at the synod of Biterrae (Béziers), summoned by the emperor in 356 with the professed purpose of settling the longstanding dispute, an imperial rescript banished the new bishop, along with Rhodanus of Toulouse, to Phrygia, a stronghold of Arianism.

Hilary spent nearly four years in exile, although the reasons for this banishment remain obscure. The traditional explanation is that Hilary was exiled for refusing to subscribe to the condemnation of Athanasius and the Nicene faith. More recently several scholars have suggested that political opposition to Constantius and support of the usurper Claudius Silvanus may have led to Hilary&#x27;s exile.

==In exile==
While in Phrygia, however, he continued to govern his diocese, as well as writing two of the most important of his contributions to dogmatic and polemical theology: the &quot;De synodis&quot; or &quot;De fide Orientalium&quot;, an epistle addressed in 358 to the Semi-Arian bishops in Gaul, Germania and Britain, analyzing the views of the Eastern bishops on the Nicene controversy. In reviewing the professions of faith of the Oriental bishops in the Councils of Ancyra, Antioch, and Sirmium, he sought to show that sometimes the difference between certain doctrines and orthodox beliefs was rather in the words than in the ideas, which led to his counseling the bishops of the West to be more reserved in their condemnation.

The &quot;De trinitate libri XII&quot;, composed in 359 and 360, was the first successful expression in Latin of that Council&#x27;s theological subtleties originally elaborated in Greek. Although some members of Hilary&#x27;s own party thought the first had shown too great a forbearance towards the Arians, Hilary replied to their criticisms in the &quot;Apologetica ad reprehensores libri de synodis responsa&quot;.

In his classic introduction to the works of Hilary, Watson summarizes Hilary&#x27;s points:
:&quot;They were the forerunners of Antichrist ... They bear themselves not as bishops of Christ but as priests of Antichrist. This is not random abuse, but sober recognition of the fact, stated by St. John, that there are many Antichrists. For these men assume the cloak of piety, and pretend to preach the Gospel, with the one object of inducing others to deny Christ. It was the misery and folly of the day that men endeavoured to promote the cause of God by human means and the favour of the world. Hilary asks bishops, who believe in their office, whether the Apostles had secular support when by their preaching they converted the greater part of mankind ...&quot; 
:&quot;The Church seeks for secular support, and in so doing insults Christ by the implication that His support is insufficient. She in her turn holds out the threat of exile and prison. It was her endurance of these that drew men to her; now she imposes her faith by violence. She craves for favours at the hand of her communicants; once it was her consecration that she braved the threatenings of persecutors. Bishops in exile spread the Faith; now it is she that exiles bishops. She boasts that the world loves her; the world&#x27;s hatred was the evidence that she was Christ&#x27;s ... The time of Antichrist, disguised as an angel of light, has come. The true Christ is hidden from almost every mind and heart. Antichrist is now obscuring the truth that he may assert falsehood hereafter.&quot;

Hilary also attended several synods during his time in exile, including the council at Seleucia (359) which saw the triumph of the &quot;homoion&quot; party and the forbidding of all discussion of the divine substance. In 360, Hilary tried unsuccessfully to secure a personal audience with Constantius, as well as to address the council which met at Constantinople in 360. When this council ratified the decisions of Ariminum and Seleucia, Hilary responded with the bitter &quot;In Constantium&quot;, which attacked the Emperor Constantius as Antichrist and persecutor of orthodox Christians. Hilary&#x27;s urgent and repeated requests for public debates with his opponents, especially with Ursacius and Valens, proved at last so inconvenient that he was sent back to his diocese, which he appears to have reached about 361, within a very short time of the accession of Emperor Julian.

==Later life==
On returning to his diocese in 361, Hilary spent most of the first two or three years trying to persuade the local clergy that the &quot;homoion&quot; confession was merely a cover for traditional Arian subordinationism. Thus, a number of synods in Gaul condemned the creed promulgated at the Council of Ariminum (359).

In about 360 or 361, with Hilary&#x27;s encouragement, Martin, the future bishop of Tours, founded a monastery at Ligugé in his diocese.

In 364, Hilary extended his efforts once more beyond Gaul. He impeached Auxentius, bishop of Milan, a man high in the imperial favour, as heterodox. Emperor Valentinian I accordingly summoned Hilary to Milan to there maintain his charges. However, the supposed heretic gave satisfactory answers to all the questions proposed. Hilary denounced Auxentius as a hypocrite as he had been ignominiously expelled from Milan. Upon returning home, Hilary in 365, published the &quot;Contra Arianos vel Auxentium Mediolanensem liber,&quot; describing his unsuccessful efforts against Auxentius. He also, perhaps at a somewhat earlier date, published the &quot;Contra Constantium Augustum liber&quot;, accusing the deceased emperor as having been the Antichrist, a rebel against God, &quot;a tyrant whose sole object had been to make a gift to the devil of that world for which Christ had suffered.&quot;

According to Jerome, Hilary died in Poitiers in 367.

While Hilary closely followed the two great Alexandrians, Origen and Athanasius, in exegesis and Christology respectively, his work shows many traces of vigorous independent thought.

===Exegetical===
Among Hilary&#x27;s earliest writings, completed some time before his exile in 356, is his &quot;Commentarius in Evangelium Matthaei&quot;, an allegorical exegesis of the first Gospel. This is the first Latin commentary on Matthew to have survived in its entirety. Hilary&#x27;s commentary was strongly influenced by Tertullian and Cyprian, and made use of several classical writers, including Cicero, Quintilian, Pliny and the Roman historians.

Hilary&#x27;s expositions of the Psalms, &quot;Tractatus super Psalmos&quot;, largely follow Origen, and were composed some time after Hilary returned from exile in 360. Since Jerome found the work incomplete, no one knows whether Hilary originally commented on the whole Psalter. Now extant are the commentaries on Psalms 1, 2, 9, 13, 14, 51–69, 91, and 118–150.

The third surviving exegetical writing by Hilary is the &quot;Tractatus mysteriorum&quot;, preserved in a single manuscript first published in 1887.

Because Augustine cites part of the commentary on Romans as by &quot;Sanctus Hilarius&quot; it has been ascribed by various critics at different times to almost every known Hilary.

===Theological===
Hilary&#x27;s major theological work was the twelve books now known as &quot;De Trinitate&quot;. This was composed largely during his exile, though perhaps not completed until his return to Gaul in 360.

Another important work is &quot;De synodis&quot;, written early in 359 in preparation for the councils of Ariminium and Seleucia.

===Historical works and hymns===
Various writings comprise Hilary&#x27;s historical works. These include the &quot;Liber II ad Constantium imperatorem&quot;, the &quot;Liber in Constantium inperatorem&quot;, &quot;Contra Arianos vel Auxentium Mediolanensem liber&quot;, and the various documents relating to the Arian controversy in &quot;Fragmenta historica&quot;.

Some consider Hilary as the first Latin Christian hymn writer, because Jerome said Hilary produced a &quot;liber hymnorum&quot;. Three hymns are attributed to him, though none are indisputable.

==Reputation and veneration==

Hilary is the pre-eminent Latin writer of the 4th century (before Ambrose). Augustine of Hippo called him &quot;the illustrious doctor of the churches&quot;, and his works continued to be highly influential in later centuries. Venantius Fortunatus wrote a &quot;vita&quot; of Hilary by 550, but few now consider it reliable. More trustworthy are the notices in Saint Jerome (De vir. illus. 100), Sulpicius Severus (&quot;Chron.&quot; ii. 39–45) and in Hilary&#x27;s own writings. Pope Pius IX formally recognized him as a Doctor of the Church in 1851.

In the Roman calendar of saints, Hilary&#x27;s feast day is on 13 January, 14 January in the pre-1970 form of the calendar. The spring terms of the English and Irish law courts and Oxford and Dublin universities are called the Hilary term since they begin on approximately this date. Some consider Saint Hilary of Poitiers the patron saint of lawyers.

Hilary is remembered in the Anglican Communion with a lesser festival on 13 January.

===Iconography===
From his writing St. Hilary&#x27;s symbol came to be three books and a quill pen.

===Dedications===
Sulpicius Severus&#x27; &quot;Vita Sancti Martini&quot; led to a cult of Saint Hilary as well as of St. Martin of Tours which spread early to western Britain. The villages of St Hilary in Cornwall and Glamorgan and that of Llanilar in Ceredigion bear his name.

In France most dedications to Saint Hilary are styled &quot;Saint-Hilaire&quot; and lie west (and north) of the Massif Central; the cult in this region eventually extended to Canada.

In northwest Italy the church of Sant&#x27;Ilario at Casale Monferrato was dedicated to St. Hilary as early as 380.

In southern Spain the feast of San Hilario is celebrated in the village of Comares with a Mass, a procession and local Verdiales dances.

In Wales the village St Hilary has a Church allegedly dedicated to St Hilary, from which the village is named.

<text>The Atari Transputer Workstation (also known as ATW-800, or simply ATW) is a workstation class computer released by Atari Corporation in the late 1980s, based on the INMOS Transputer. It was introduced in 1987 as the Abaq, but the name was changed before sales began. Sales were almost non-existent, and the product was canceled after only a few hundred units were made.

== History ==
In 1986, Tim King left his job at MetaComCo, along with a few other employees, to start Perihelion Software in England. There they began developing a new parallel-processing operating system named &quot;HeliOS&quot;. At about the same time a colleague, Jack Lang, started Perihelion (later Perihelion Hardware) to create a new Transputer-based workstation that would run HeliOS.

While at MetaComCo, much of the Perihelion Software team had worked with both Atari Corp. and Commodore International, producing the programming language ST BASIC for the former, and AmigaDOS for the latter. The principals still had contacts with both companies. Commodore had expressed some interest in their new system, and showed demos of it on an add-on card running inside an Amiga 2000. It appears they later lost interest in it. Atari Corp. met with Perihelion and work began on what would eventually become the Atari Transputer Workstation.

The machine was first introduced at the November 1987 COMDEX with the name Abaq. Two versions were shown at the time; one was a card that connected to the Mega ST bus expansion slot, the second version was a stand-alone tower system containing a miniaturized Mega ST inside. The external card version was dropped at some point during development. It was later learned that the &quot;Abaq&quot; name was in use in Europe, so the product name was changed to ATW800. Perihelion remained the exclusive distributor in England. A first run of prototypes was released in May 1988, followed by a production run in May 1989. In total, only 350 machines were produced (depending on the source either 50 or 100 of the total were prototypes).

The team in charge of the ATW&#x27;s video system, &quot;Blossom&quot;, would later work on another Atari project, the Atari Jaguar video game console.

== Overview ==
The Atari Transputer Workstation system consists of three main parts:

# the main motherboard containing a T800-20 Transputer and 4 MB of random-access memory (RAM) (expandable to 16 MB)
# a complete miniaturized Mega ST acting as an input/output (I/O) processor with 512 KB of RAM
# the Blossom video system with 1 MB of dual-ported RAM

All of these are connected using the Transputer&#x27;s 20 Mbit/s processor links. The motherboard contains four slots for added &quot;farm cards&quot; containing four Transputers each, meaning that a fully expanded ATW contains 17 Transputers. Each runs at 20 MHz (the -20 in the name) which supplied about 10 MIPS each. The bus is available externally, allowing several ATWs to be connected into one large farm. The motherboard includes a separate slot for one of the INMOS crossbar switches to improve inter-chip networking performance.

HeliOS is Unix-like, but not Unix. It lacks memory protection, due largely to the lack of a memory management unit (MMU) on the Transputer, although a number of measures are employed to reduce the possibility of programs interfering with each other. For example, when invoking a command pipeline, each program is distributed to its own separate processor, communicating with other programs using pipes that are implemented by hardware links. Where many programs may be deployed on the same processor, these processors will not in general be shared by programs belonging to different users.

HeliOS is Unix-like enough that it ran standard Unix utilities, including the X Window System as the machine&#x27;s graphical user interface (GUI). HeliOS can run on all of the Transputers in a farm concurrently, which allows all computing tasks to be fully distributed. Powering off an ATW does not affect the overall farm, and the tasks simply move to other processors on other systems.

Blossom supports several video modes:
:mode 0: 1280 by 960 pixels, 16 colors out of a palette of 4096 (including 16 true grayscales, on a monochrome monitor)
:mode 1: 1024 by 768 pixels, 256 colors out of a palette of 16.7 million
:mode 2: 640 by 480 pixels (2 virtual screens), 256 colors out of a palette of 16.7 million
:mode 3: 512 by 480 pixels, 16.7 million colors

Blossom also includes a number of high-speed effects (128 megapixel fill rates) and blitter functionality, including the ability to apply up to four masks on a bit blit operation in a fashion similar to a modern graphics processing unit&#x27;s ability to apply several textures to a 3D object.

One oddity of the ATW is that it appears that the Blossom is responsible for the DRAM refresh, although the ATW includes such hardware internally.

The video architecture developed by Perihelion for the ATW formed the basis of a &quot;high resolution video engine&quot; expansion card envisaged for the TT030 workstation, connecting to the machine&#x27;s VMEbus and supporting direct memory access transfers to and from system RAM.

<text>Les Guignols (, &quot;The Puppets&quot;), formerly Les Guignols de l&#x27;info (, &quot;The News Puppets&quot;), was a popular satirical latex puppet show on the French television channel Canal+. The show, which ran daily, was created in 1988 and drew inspiration from the French program &quot;Le Bébête Show&quot; (1982–1995) and the British puppet satire &quot;Spitting Image&quot; (1984–1996). Using a format similar to a news broadcast, the show satirized the political world, media, celebrities, French society, and international events.

Throughout the years, it usually aired at 7:50 p.m. as a segment of other Canal+ shows, such as or &quot;Le Grand Journal.&quot; On Sunday afternoons, Canal+ aired a weekly recap called &quot;La Semaine des Guignols&quot;, featuring a back-to-back replay of the week&#x27;s episodes.

The show began in 1988 as &quot;Les Arènes de l&#x27;info&quot; (News Arenas). Initially, it did not cover current events in real-time and was less popular due to being scripted weeks in advance. However, in the 1990–91 season, the show rebranded as Les Guignols de l&#x27;Info and shifted to daily news commentary. It then enjoyed a tremendous growth in popularity with its different coverage of the first Gulf War, and quickly eclipsed its rival, &quot;Le Bébête Show&quot;.

The structure of the series stayed constant throughout the years: a headline, a few quick stories, a pre-recorded video skit, an interview with a personality, then one last story. It rarely diverged from this layout, usually only doing so to drive points across further (e.g. replacing all news with a seven-minute interview of one of the Sylvestres during the 2003 Iraq War).

==Impact on popular culture==
The &quot;Guignols&quot; have had a tremendous impact on French popular culture, in many cases introducing or popularizing phrases. For example, &quot;à l&#x27;insu de mon plein gré&quot; (&quot;without the knowledge of my own free will&quot;), repeated by Richard Virenque&#x27;s puppet, is now attributed in jest to people who hypocritically deny having willfully committed attributed acts.

The show also went far in how violently it challenged and portrayed public figures. Some sketches displayed for example Raymond Barre, a former Prime Minister in a homosexual gonzo pornographic scene, Philippe Séguin (then candidate for Paris Mayor) in sadomasochist performances, President Jacques Chirac and his team in a &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;–like destruction race to eliminate their competitors or the then-Minister of Interior Department Nicolas Sarkozy and foreign affair minister Dominique de Villepin as head of rival criminal gangs in a Sin City and in a Gangs of New York parody. 

The show also used horror movies to spoof politicians. President Jacques Chirac was represented as Leatherface chasing environmentalist politicians Antoine Waechter and Brice Lalonde in a parody of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, as Jack Torrance in a Shining parody where he was assaulting Jacques Toubon in a bathroom with a giant fountain pen after he had read the single sentence in the book he was writing, and as Ash Williams in a parody of Evil Dead where a Kandarian Demon spoke with the voice of the late president François Mitterrand. President François Hollande appeared as a Catholic priest in a parody of The Exorcist where (then presidential candidate) Lionel Jospin was possessed by a demon. The dead were raising from their grave on Election Day to cast votes for Jean Tiberi (then Paris mayor) in a parody of Night of the Living Dead. Environment Minister Ségolène Royal was shown as victimized by an electric car named Corinne in a parody of John Carpenter&#x27;s Christine. The rival program of TF1 &quot;Le Bébête Show&quot; was spoofed in a parody of &quot;Freaks&quot; in which Étienne Mougeotte (head of programming at TF1) was captured by Kermitterrand and his friends and turned into another (duck-like) puppet for trying to cancel the show due to its low ratings. 

Besides horror movies, works by Quentin Tarantino were also parodied. One controversial parody (&quot;Inglorious Cathos)&quot; showed the Pope Benedict XVI hiring (in a scene more reminiscent of The Dirty Dozen) a commando of 3 bishops (a paedophile, a Holocaust denier, a radical traditional catholic) to fight the infidels. One South Park parody, used instead of puppets cartoon characters drawn in the style of Eric Cartman (with the voice of Philippe Séguin), Kyle Broflovski (with the voice of Nicolas Sarkozy), Stan Marsh (with the voice of François Bayrou) and Kenny McCormick (with the voice of Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing). At the end of the skit, Kenny was getting killed and the other congratulated each other for doing a good thing together. The &quot;Guignols&quot; have generally displayed a left-leaning political outlook (although being tough on whoever is in power). While they generally focused on French politics, they also often riffed off of international events, a key focal point being United States foreign policy in general, including Osama bin Laden, the Iraq conflict and Saddam Hussein. These spoofs on international events were usually presented in an anti-Bush manner, portraying the fictional &quot;World Company&quot; (see below) as being the true leaders, not the president himself. They also regularly called out and mocked their own TV channel, Canal+, and its executive staff, especially during its 2002 crisis.

=== Political influence ===
The impact of political caricature in the &quot;Guignols&quot; is unclear, but some polls have shown that they have influenced voters. According to Ipsos (2002), the show had a good reach within the younger 18-32 audience segment. The popularity of Chirac&#x27;s puppet has undeniably played a role in his 1995 election as Les Guignols had become a major broadcaster of biased political opinions. The show had created an electoral slogan for Chirac (&quot;Mangez des pommes&quot;) that the candidate reused publicly during his campaign.

The French journalist Hugo Cassavetti criticized how the show evolved from a political goof for everyone to a partisan show with a political agenda, turning Canal+ into a leftist political hub. Bruno Gaccio reminded that Les Guignols &quot;aren’t real, it’s fake news-it’s just comedy&quot;, and also said &quot;if American audiences could get a brief dose of &quot;Guignol&quot; humor, their perceptions would never be the same again.&quot;

&quot;Les Guignols&quot; created mixed reactions regarding their provocative coverage of the September 11 attacks, for example when they portrayed Osama bin Laden triumphantly singing &quot;It’s Raining Planes&quot;, or by depicting George W. Bush as mentally challenged. By 2002, 3.5 million viewers watched the show everyday, including 25% of the 15-25 segment.

=== Catchphrases ===
Some catchphrases are recurrently used during the show.

* &quot;Le Monsieur te demande...&quot; (The gentleman is asking you...) loudly pronounced by the Chirac puppet when repeating the question of the interviewer to the Giscard puppet, to suggest that he is deaf or senile. 
* &quot;Putain, deux ans !&quot; (Damn, two years!) In 1993, Balladur is prime minister, while Chirac must wait two years to run for president. His puppet keeps repeating that sentence, suggesting his impatience to become president. 
* &quot;à l&#x27;insu de mon plein gré&quot; See above. Repeated by Virenque&#x27;s puppet to deny that he knew he was taking performance-enhancing drugs. 
* &quot;Oh oui, quelle humiliation !&quot; (Yes, what a great humiliation! ) Repeated by Philippe Séguin&#x27;s puppet during the run-up to the mayor election in Paris, anticipating on his defeat. 
* &quot;Tout à fait Thierry !&quot; Used by the puppet of Jean-Michel Larqué when commenting soccer matches with Thierry Roland. 
* &quot;Salut, Bonhomme.&quot; (Hello boy/lad) is used by Bernard Tapie to salute PPD. 
* &quot;Pt&#x27;it fromage qui pue.&quot; (Little stinking cheese) used by M. Sylvestre (Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s puppet) when talking of French people or when saluting PPD. 
* &quot;Excusez la tenue, je sors de la douche.&quot; (Sorry for the bathrobe, I was in the shower) Repeated by the Dominique Strauss-Kahn puppet who is always in bathrobe when doing interviews.

==Famous characters==


The characters appearing in Les &quot;Guignols&quot; are based on real personalities of the political, economic and artistic worlds; generally, anybody deemed newsworthy. The show also had a few dozen anonymous puppets at its disposal.

* PPD is a caricature of Patrick Poivre d&#x27;Arvor (who is himself nicknamed &quot;PPDA&quot;), a news anchor who was on the TF1 network until 2008. He served as the main anchor of the show since its first season. He was depicted as a rather cowardly journalist who tries to get on with the mighty and the powerful, but used irony and sarcasm to get his point across. He also sported a variety of hairstyles, in an attempt to mask his receding hairline. Despite the end of the news anchor career of the real Patrick Poivre d&#x27;Arvor, &quot;PPD&quot; wasn&#x27;t retired until the 2015 season.
*Sylvestre, Commandant Sylvestre, Cardinal Sylvestre, and many others, both named and unnamed, all with the same face and voice, were fictional characters based on the likeness of the American actor Sylvester Stallone, although when it was the actor himself who was represented, or Rambo, he had a distinct appearance and a different voice. The Sylvestres were parodies of &quot;an ugly American&quot;, of greedy multinational corporations, and the military–industrial complex. They always introduced themselves with &quot;beuuarhh&quot; (), a slurred version of &quot;&quot; (, &quot;good evening&quot;). During the first Gulf War, the &quot;Guignols&quot; introduced a character called &quot;Commandant Sylvestre&quot;. He would explain the war in broad oversimplified terms (&quot;Here&#x27;s the good guys, that&#x27;s us, and here are the ragheads, so we&#x27;ll kill everybody there...&quot;). After the gulf war, he was reintroduced as Mr. Sylvestre, an ubiquitous executive from the military-industrial complex, the corporate world, and the CIA, all mixed into the fictional mega-corporation &quot;World Company&quot;. Sylvestre was dressed in a suit and tie, with a security badge. Other Sylvestres, dressed as Cardinals, Reverends, Imams, Rabbis, and other religious leaders, were also portrayed as the Church Company, the twin sister of the World Company, specializing in &quot;the business of religion&quot;. During the 2017 season, he was the show&#x27;s main anchor. In the very last episode, he was the CEO who fired PPD and Jacques Chirac.
* Jacques Chirac, the president of France from 1995 to 2007, was depicted as a beer-guzzling, impulsive, incompetent liar, while coming off, at the same time, as relatable and well-loved. The show introduced &quot;Super Menteur&quot; (Super-Liar) during the 2002 presidential campaign, a Superman-like super hero Jacques Chirac changes into at times of need. &quot;Super Menteur&quot; is capable of uttering unbelievable lies without getting caught. Jean-Marie Le Pen publicly approved the accuracy of the puppet&#x27;s alter ego, thus instrumentalizing the &quot;Guignols&quot; to feed his base. Only one person is a better liar, &quot;Ultra menteur&quot; (Ultra-Liar), portrayed by French retired politician Charles Pasqua, who was convicted in some corruption cases. Chirac served as the show&#x27;s main anchor in its last season, in 2018.
* George W. Bush was depicted as a cretin along with his father. He shows a tendency to war and fights terrorism in his bedroom, defending himself with hand grenades (beer cans). His laptop password is &quot;connard&quot; (one of the French words for &quot;dumbass&quot;). He often appears along with one of the Sylvestres, who gets portrayed as the guy who&#x27;s really in charge. Remarkably, Bush&#x27;s character spoke in French with an American (or English, foreign) accent, whereas M. Sylvestre spoke French without any foreign accent, after the French dubbed voice of Sylvester Stallone in his films.
* Joey Starr and Doc Gynéco: The rapper Joey Starr, convicted of violence, is portrayed as a brutal individual. He is often coupled with rapper Doc Gynéco to discuss the consumption of cannabis.
* Bernard Tapie, a French businessman, is represented as a braggart, speaking in a frank, blunt and vulgar way.
*Patrick Le Lay, head of the TF1 TV channel paired with Etienne Mougeotte, head of programming at TF1. Mougeotte is regularly portrayed as a hypocrite who schedules documentaries on prostitution or sex-oriented reality TV programs and pretends doing that to inform the public, while Le Lay always reveals that the actual purpose is only to improve ratings. Le Lay has been also portrayed as the emperor in a spoof of The Empire Strikes Back and as the blind superior in a spoof of The Name of the Rose. 
* Jean Marie Le Pen, former head of the Front National far-right political party. He was sometimes represented with a pitbull&#x27;s head. After the handover to one of his daughters, Marine Le Pen, his puppet appeared rarely, sometimes as the éminence grise of Marine Le Pen, his daughter and successor, other times as a bluntly-speaking bigot she had to reel in and control in order to appear acceptable to public discourse.
* Philippe Lucas, a former trainer of the French Olympic world and European champion swimmer Laure Manaudou, was portrayed as a heavily muscled, homophobic guy who criticized most French athletes, suspecting them of physical and mental weakness. He always concluded his criticism by the catchphrase &quot;Et pis c&#x27;est tout !&quot;, an incorrect contraction of &quot;Et puis c&#x27;est tout&quot; (And that&#x27;s it).
*Bernard Laporte, a former authoritarian rugby scrum half, coach (both club teams and national team), former secretary of state, often appeared to praise the violence in rugby, which his puppet described as the &quot;valeurs de l&#x27;ovalie&quot; (the values of rugby), with many hyperboles (open fractures, neck cracking, enucleations, coma, crowbar fighting ambush).

In recent political history, the &quot;Guignols&quot; have also regularly portrayed:
*Lionel Jospin, former prime minister, as competent and honest, but boring. Other puppets nicknamed him &quot;bean up the butt&quot;. He was later depicted as disappointed by France (he passes, from time to time, to scream &quot;&quot;pays de merde !&quot;, roughly &quot;this country sucks&quot;), since the first round of the 2002 presidential election, in which he failed to get to the second round.
*Édouard Balladur former prime minister who ran for president against Chirac. In the show, Chirac&#x27;s puppet nicknames him &quot;Couille molle&quot; (soft testicle). Balladur&#x27;s puppet appeared in a spoof of Trainspotting where he is suffering from an addiction to political power. As Balladur tried to get rid of his upper class manners during his presidential campaign, his puppet was shown unshaved, with vulgar manners, calling Sarkozy &quot;Nico&quot; and drinking cheap beer. 
*Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin, a former minister of health, youth affairs and sports, then former minister of culture, was depicted as an incompetent airhead, clueless about all questions related to her ministry, welcoming questions from PPD with &quot;Ah bon !?&quot; (&quot;Oh, really!?&quot;&quot;).
*Nicolas Sarkozy, former president, was depicted as overly ambitious, populist, and short-tempered. He collected Rolex watches, and kept diverting attention to his wife, Carla Bruni. Like the real politician, he was insecure about his short height, and always wore shoes with heels to compensate. After Sarkozy came back to the French politics scene in 2014, he was portrayed as someone who claimed he had &quot;really changed&quot; regarding his short temper, but the facade often fell off to reveal someone worse than before.
*Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, former president, was seen as dogmatic and repetitive, usually seen wearing his green &quot;habit vert&quot; (ceremonial dress), as he is a member of the Académie Française. One running gag is that Giscard d&#x27;Estaing was dead, but too stubborn to admit it, or even acknowledge it.
*Ségolène Royal, the socialist party candidate for the 2007 presidential election, as constantly following opinion polls, pretending to be a woman of the people.
*François Bayrou, the centrist 2012 candidate for the presidency who has delusions of grandeur. His huge-eared puppet was constantly portrayed as childish and whiny.
*Dominique Strauss-Kahn after his arrest in 2011 was portrayed as a pervert wearing only a bathrobe with Leopard spots and calling his penis &quot;Francis&quot;. Interviewed by PPD as a consultant on economics, he was giving answers in economics jargon (such as &quot;animal spirits, tension, invisible hand, spheres full of liquidities&quot; etc...) that made no sense except as sexual double-entendre that PPD either does not understand or feigns not to understand.
*François Hollande, elected president in 2012, was depicted as an overweight and silly politician who lacked charisma.
*Nadine Morano was seen as a very scurrilous and rough politician, who unconditionally supported Nicolas Sarkozy, often alongside David Douillet, a former world champion in judo and minister of sports, who was himself depicted a very simple-minded man.
*Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who was portrayed, since the end of 2011, of controlling the entire European Union.

==Criticism==

The &quot;Guignols&quot; have been criticised for being leftist and populist, and for presenting a cynical and over-simplified version of reality and politics. The show&#x27;s authors have admitted leftist leanings. Erik Svane has accused the show of being anti-American.

After the departure of two of the original authors in the late 1990s, the show has been criticized as lacking wit and freshness and having become too overtly populist and partisan. Some critics claim that the show is in decline. The show&#x27;s treatment of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized as biased. Bruno Gaccio, prior to the French presidential election of 2007, was said to have admitted that he meant the Guignols to openly campaign against Sarkozy, but later stated that he had been misquoted.

In 1997, Peugeot sued the show for the distorted use of its brand name, but also because of how the show characterized its CEO Jacques Calvet.

François Bayrou, who was depicted as a weak childish man who could sometimes throw a tantrum, said &quot;The image, very demeaning, hurts. My puppet has nothing to do with who I really am.&quot;

==Cancellation==

Following the dismissal of the main four writers in July 2015, the channel&#x27;s new executives decided to move the show to the encrypted, non-free time slots. This decision was brought into effect the following December (the show returning months late after the executive shakeup), although the show was made available to the general public as a Dailymotion stream after being broadcast on air (&quot;La Semaine des Guignols&quot;, the weekly roundup of the show, continued to be broadcast free-to-air on Sundays). This change, as well as many other creative changes, brought about a decline of the programme, until the final episode was broadcast on June 22, 2018.

Programs of the Guignols family exchange latex moulds, and puppets representing foreign celebrities can be used as &quot;normal people&quot; in countries where those personalities are not well-known.

In September 2020, U.S. broadcaster Fox greenlit an adaptation of the series, &quot;Let&#x27;s Be Real&quot;, with plans to air a one-off special on 1 October themed around the 2020 United States presidential election. Robert Smigel (the creator and voice of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog) served as executive producer.

<text>&#x27; (singular &#x27;; literally &#x27;drawn strips&#x27;), abbreviated BDs and also referred to as Franco-Belgian comics (), are comics that are usually originally in French and created for readership in France and Belgium. These countries have a long tradition in comics, separate from that of English-language comics. Belgium is a mostly bilingual country, and comics originally in Dutch (, literally &quot;strip stories&quot;, or simply &quot;strips&quot;) are culturally a part of the world of &quot;bandes dessinées&quot;, even if the translation from French to Dutch far outweighs the other direction.

Among the most popular &quot;bandes dessinées&quot; are &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (by Hergé), &quot;Spirou and Fantasio&quot; (Franquin et al.), &quot;Gaston&quot; (Franquin), &quot;Asterix&quot; (Goscinny &amp; Uderzo), &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; (Morris &amp; Goscinny), &quot;The Smurfs&quot; (Peyo) and &quot;Spike and Suzy&quot; (Willy Vandersteen). Some highly-regarded realistically drawn and plotted &quot;bandes dessinées&quot; include &quot;Blueberry&quot; (Charlier &amp; Giraud, a.k.a. &quot;Moebius&quot;), &quot;Thorgal&quot; (van Hamme &amp; Rosiński), &quot;XIII&quot; (van Hamme &amp; Vance), and the creations of Hermann.

==Reach==
In Europe, French is spoken natively not only in France and the city state of Monaco, but also by significant portions of the population of Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland. The shared language creates an artistic and commercial market where national identity is often blurred, and one of the main rationales for the conception of the (English) &quot;Franco-Belgian comics&quot; expression itself. The potential appeal of the French-language BDs extends beyond Francophone Europe, as France in particular has strong historical and cultural ties with several Francophone overseas territories. Of these territories it is Quebec, Canada, where Franco-Belgian BDs are doing best, due – aside from the fact that it has the largest BD reading Francophone population outside Europe – to that province&#x27;s close historical and cultural ties with France from colonization, in the process heavily influencing its own native Quebec comics scene. This is in stark contrast to the English-speaking part of the country, which is culturally American comics oriented.

While the originally in Dutch written Flemish Belgian comic books, or rather comic/BD albums (see: &quot;below&quot;) are influenced by Francophone BDs, especially in the early years, they evolved into a distinctly different style, both in art and in spirit, which is why they are nowadays sub-categorized as Flemish comics, as their evolution started to take a different path from the late 1940s onward, due to cultural differences stemming from the increasing cultural self-awareness of the Flemish people. And while French-language publications are habitually translated into Dutch, Flemish publications are less commonly translated into French, for cultural reasons. Likewise, despite the shared language, Flemish BDs do not do that well in the Netherlands and vice versa, save for some notable exceptions, such as the Willy Vandersteen creation &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot; (&quot;Spike and Suzy&quot;) which is popular across the border. Concurrently, the socio-cultural idiosyncrasies contained within many Flemish BDs also means that these comics have seen far less translations into other languages than their French-language counterparts have due to their more universal appeal, and the French language&#x27;s cultural status.

Belgium is officially a trilingual country as there is a German-speaking Community of Belgium. Belgian BD home market first print releases, be it in Dutch or in French, are rarely translated into that language with German-speaking Belgians having to wait for internationally released editions for reading in their native tongue, typically those from licensed publishers stemming from neighboring Germany. Though Dutch and German both are Germanic languages, the German-speaking Community of Belgium lies within the territory of the Walloon Region, so that French is the most utilized (second) language in that area and has caused the handful of BD artists originating from there, such as Hermann and Didier Comès, to create their BDs in French. Born Dieter Hermann Comès, Comès actually &quot;Frenchified&quot; his given name to this end, whereas Hermann has dispensed with his (Germanic) family name &quot;Huppen&quot; for his BD credits, though he maintained the Germanic spelling for his first name. Due to its relative modesty, both in size and in scope, and despite the close historical and cultural ties, no German-Belgian artists are as of 2018 known to have created BDs specifically for the German comics world, when discounting commercial translations of their original Francophone creations.

A similar situation exists in France, which has several regional languages, of which Breton and Occitan are two of the more substantial ones. But while these languages are culturally recognized as regional languages, they are not official national languages, contrary to Belgium in regard to German, with similar consequences as in Belgium for BDs and their artists. Native BDs are rarely, if at all, released in these languages by the main BD publishers, whereas artists stemming from these regions, invariably create their BDs in French – like their German-Belgian counterparts forced to do so in order to gain commercial access to the main market. The situation for France&#x27;s German-speaking minority is therefore identical to its more sizable counterpart in northern neighbor Belgium in regard to BD-related matters.

==Vocabulary==
The term &quot;bandes dessinées&quot; is derived from the original description of the art form as &quot;drawn strips&quot;. It was first introduced in the 1930s, but only became popular in the 1960s, by which time the &quot;BD&quot; abbreviation was also in use for its book, or album, publications (see &quot;below&quot;).

&quot;Bandes dessinées&quot; were described as the &quot;ninth art&quot; in Francophone scholarship on the medium (&quot;le neuvième art&quot;). The &quot;ninth art&quot; designation stems from a 1964 article by in the magazine &quot;Lettres et Médecins&quot;, and was subsequently popularized in an article series about the history of comics, which appeared in weekly installments in &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine from 1964 to 1967. Written by Belgian Morris with editorial input from the below-mentioned Frenchman , the article series was in itself an example of a Franco-Belgian BD project. The publication of Francis Lacassin&#x27;s book &quot;Pour un neuvième art : la bande dessinée&quot; in 1971 further established the term.

In North America, Franco-Belgian BDs are often seen as equivalent to what are known as graphic novels — most likely a result of their deviating from the American 32-page comic book standard. In recent decades the English &quot;graphic novel&quot; expression has increasingly been adopted in Europe as well in the wake of the works of Will Eisner and Art Spiegelman, but with the specific intent to discriminate between comics intended for a younger and/or general readership, and publications which are more likely to feature mature content, literary subject matter or experimental styles. As a result, European BD scholars have retroactively identified the 1962 &quot;Barbarella&quot; comic by Jean-Claude Forest (for its theme) and the first 1967 &quot;Corto Maltese&quot; adventure &quot;Una ballata del mare salato&quot; (&quot;A Ballad of the Salt Sea&quot;) by Hugo Pratt (for both art, and story style) in particular, as the comics up for consideration as the first European &quot;graphic novels&quot;.

==History==

During the 19th century, there were many artists in Europe drawing cartoons, occasionally even utilizing sequential multi-panel narration, albeit mostly with clarifying captions and dialogue placed under the panels rather than the speech balloons commonly used today. These were humorous short works rarely longer than a single page. In the Francophonie, artists such as Gustave Doré, Nadar, Christophe and Caran d&#x27;Ache began to be involved with the medium.

===Early 1900s – 1929: Precursors===
In the early decades of the 20th century, comics were not stand-alone publications, but were published in newspapers and weekly or monthly magazines as episodes or gags. Aside from these magazines, the Catholic Church, in the form of its then powerful and influential , was creating and distributing &quot;healthy and correct&quot; magazines for children. In the early 1900s, the first popular French comics appeared. Two of the most prominent comics include &quot;Bécassine&quot; and &quot;Les Pieds Nickelés&quot;.

In the 1920s, after the end of the first world war, the French artist Alain Saint-Ogan started out as a professional cartoonist, creating the successful series &quot;Zig et Puce&quot; in 1925. Saint-Ogan was one of the first French-speaking artists to fully utilize techniques popularized and formularized in the United States, such as Speech balloons, even though the text comic format would remain the predominant native format for the next two to three decades in France, propagated as such by France&#x27;s educators. In 1920, the Abbot of Averbode in Belgium started publishing &quot;Zonneland&quot;, a magazine consisting largely of text with few illustrations, which started printing comics more often in the following years.

Even though &quot;Les Pieds Nickelés&quot;, &quot;Bécassine&quot; and &quot;Zig et Puce&quot; managed to survive the war for a little while longer, modernized in all three cases and all of them continued by artists (the most notable one being &quot;Belgian&quot; Greg for the latter in the 1960s) other than the original creators, none of them succeeded to find a readership outside France itself and are consequently remembered in their native country only.

===1929–1940: Birth of the modern Franco-Belgian comic===
One of the earliest proper Belgian comics was Hergé&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, with the story &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;, which was published in &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; in 1929. It was quite different from future versions of Tintin, the style being very naïve and simple, even childish, compared to the later stories. The early &quot;Tintin&quot; stories often featured racist and political stereotypes, which caused controversies after the war, and which Hergé later regretted. After &quot;Tintin&quot;&#x27;s early massive success, the magazine decided to release the stories in hardcover book format as well, directly after they had run their respective courses in the magazine — in the process introducing something new in the Belgian comic world: the &quot;comic album&quot;. The 1930 &quot;Tintin au pays des Soviets&quot; title is generally considered the first of its kind – even though there are three similar &quot;Zig et Puce&quot; titles from French publisher Hachette, known to predate the &quot;Tintin&quot; title by one to two years, but which failed to find an audience outside France however. The magazine continued to do so for the subsequent three stories until 1934 when the magazine, as such not particularly well-suited as book publisher, turned album publication over to Belgian specialized book publisher Casterman, who has been the &quot;Tintin&quot; album publisher ever since.

The criticisms regarding the early stories notwithstanding and even though the format still had a long way to go, &quot;Tintin&quot; is widely considered the starting point and archetype of the modern Franco-Belgian comic as currently understood, and as amply demonstrated in the vast majority of treatises and reference works written on the subject since the 1960s, and the first to find a readership outside its originating country. As such the &quot;Tintin&quot; series went on to become one of the greatest post-war successes of the Franco-Belgian comic world, having seen translations in dozens of languages, including English, as well as becoming one of the relatively few European comics to have seen a major, successful, Hollywood movie adaptation as late as 2011, nearly thirty years after the death of its creator.

A further step towards modern comic books happened in 1934 when Hungarian Paul Winkler, who had previously been distributing comics to the monthly magazines via his Opera Mundi bureau, made a deal with King Features Syndicate to create the &quot;Journal de Mickey&quot;, a weekly 8-page early &quot;comic-book&quot;. The success was immediate, and soon other publishers started publishing periodicals with American series, which enjoyed considerable popularity in both France and Belgium. This continued during the remainder of the decade, with hundreds of magazines publishing mostly imported material. The most important ones in France were &quot;Robinson&quot;, &quot;Hurrah&quot;, and the (on behalf of the a.k.a. Cœurs Vaillants et Âmes Vaillantes de France) publications &quot;Cœurs Vaillants&quot; (&quot;Valiant Hearts&quot;, 1929, for adolescent boys), &#x27; (&quot;Valiant Souls&quot;, 1937, for adolescent girls) and &#x27; (1945, for pre-adolescents), while Belgian examples included &quot;Wrill&quot; and &quot;Bravo&quot;.

&quot;Coeurs Vaillants&quot; started to publish &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; in syndication from 1930 onward, constituting one of the earliest known French-Belgian comic world cross-fertilizations, only reinforced when Abbot Courtois, editor-in-chief of &quot;Coeurs Vaillants&quot;, asked Hergé to create a series about real children with a real family as opposed to &quot;Tintin&quot;″s ambiguous age and family (and thus more in line with the Catholic norms and values on which the magazine was founded), which resulted in the 1936 comic &quot;The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko&quot;. Incidentally, as Hergé created his comics in the increasingly popular speech balloon format, it initially led to a conflict with &quot;Cœurs Vaillants&quot;, which utilized the text comic format its editors considered more appropriate from an educational point-of-view. Hergé won the argument, and speech balloon comics were henceforth featured &quot;alongside&quot; text comics in the magazine (and that of its spin-offs) until the mid-1960s, when speech balloon comics were all but abandoned by the magazine(s), the general trend notwithstanding.

In 1938, the Belgian &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine was launched. Conceived in response to the immense popularity of &quot;Journal de Mickey&quot; and the success of &quot;Tintin&quot; in &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot;, the black and white/color hybrid magazine featured predominantly comics from an American origin at the time of its launch until the war years, but there were also native comics included. These concerned &quot;Spirou&quot;, created by the Frenchman Rob-Vel (and thus another early cross-fertilization example) and who served as the mascot and namesake for the new magazine, and &quot;Tif et Tondu&quot; created by Belgian artist Fernand Dineur. Both series would survive the war and achieve considerable popularity after the war, albeit under the aegis of other artists (see below). Published in a bi-lingual country, &quot;Spirou&quot; simultaneously appeared in a Dutch-language version as well under the name &quot;Robbedoes&quot; for the Flemish market. Export to the Netherlands followed a few years later shortly after the war. The magazine was conceived and published by publisher Éditions Dupuis S.A. (as of 1989, simply: Dupuis), which was established by its founding namesake as a printing business in 1898, but changed to being a publishing house in 1922, publishing non-comic books and magazines. Since the launch of &quot;Spirou&quot; however, Dupuis has increasingly focused on comic productions and is currently, as of 2017, a comics publisher exclusively and one of the two great Belgian Franco-Belgian comic publishing houses still in existence.

As post-war exports to France (like in the Netherlands, the magazine was not available in France until 1945-46), &quot;Spirou&quot; – featuring the (early) creations of Belgian greats like Morris, Franquin and Jijé – became a significant inspiration for future French &quot;bande dessinée&quot; greats such as Jean &quot;Mœbius&quot; Giraud and Jean-Claude Mézières, eventually setting them off on their comic careers, but who were schoolboys at the time they became acquainted with the magazine.

===1940–1944: War and occupation===
When Germany invaded France and Belgium, it became close to impossible to import American comics. The occupying Nazis banned American animated movies and comics they deemed to be of a questionable character. Both were, however, already very popular before the war and the hardships of the war period only seemed to increase the demand. This created an opportunity for many young artists to start working in the comics and animation business. At first, authors like Jijé in &quot;Spirou&quot; and Edgar P. Jacobs in &quot;Bravo&quot; continued unfinished American stories of &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. Thus, by imitating the style and flow of those comics, they improved their knowledge of how to make efficient comics. Soon even those homemade versions of American comics had to stop, and the authors had to create their own heroes and stories, giving the new talents a chance to be published. Many of the most famous artists of the Franco-Belgian comics started in this period, including the Belgians André Franquin, Peyo (who started together at the small Belgian animation studio Compagnie Belge d&#x27;Animation – CBA), Willy Vandersteen, and the Frenchmen Jacques Martin and Albert Uderzo, who worked for &quot;Bravo&quot;.

===1944–1959: Post-war era Belgian supremacy===

A lot of the publishers and artists who had managed to continue working during the occupation were accused of being collaborators and were imprisoned after the liberation by the reinstated national authorities on the insistence of the former French resistance, although most were released soon afterwards without charges being pressed. For example, this happened to one of the famous magazines, &quot;Coeurs Vaillants&quot;. It was founded by Abbot Courtois (under the alias Jacques Coeur) in 1929. As he had the backing of the church, he managed to publish the magazine throughout the war, and was charged with being a collaborator. After he was forced out, his successor Pihan (as Jean Vaillant) took up the publishing, moving the magazine in a more humorous direction. Likewise, Hergé was another artist who also found himself on the receiving end of similar accusations of the former Belgian resistance. He managed to clear his name and went on to create Studio Hergé in 1950, where he acted as a sort of mentor for the assistants that it attracted. Among the people who worked there were Bob de Moor, Jacques Martin and Roger Leloup, all of whom exhibit the easily recognizable Belgian &quot;ligne claire&quot; (clean line style), often opposed to the &quot;Marcinelle school&quot;-style (named for the seat of &quot;Spirou&quot; publisher Dupuis), mostly proposed by authors from &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine such as Franquin, Peyo and Morris. In 1946, Hergé also founded the weekly &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine, which quickly gained enormous popularity, like the weekly &quot;Spirou&quot; appearing in a Dutch version under the name &quot;Kuifje&quot; for the Flemish and Dutch markets. Notable Belgian comic artists who at a later point in time achieved fame while working for &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine included among others William Vance, the aforementioned Greg, Tibet and Hermann Huppen.

&quot;Tintin&quot; magazine publisher Les Éditions du Lombard (as of 1989 simply: Le Lombard) was especially founded by Raymond Leblanc for the magazine&#x27;s launch in conjuncture with Hergé as the latter could not find a publisher due to the fact that he was at that time still under investigation for alleged collaboration. Remarkably, album publications of the creations from the early group of artists centered around Hergé was, then and now, outsourced to longstanding &quot;Tintin&quot; book publisher Casterman, while Lombard itself only started album publications for those artist who joined the magazine at a later point in time. Nonetheless, with Lombard Francophone Europe had received its first specialized comics publisher actually conceived as such. Le Lombard went on to become one of the three great Belgian publishing houses to produce comics in French (and in Dutch as well for that matter due to the bi-lingual nature of the country), alongside Dupuis and Casterman, and like them as of 2017 still in existence.

Many other magazines did not survive the war: &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; had disappeared, &quot;Le Journal de Mickey&quot; only returned in 1952. In the second half of the 1940s many new magazines appeared, although in most cases they only survived for a few weeks or months. The situation stabilized around 1950 with &quot;Spirou&quot; and the new &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine (with the team focused around Hergé) as the most influential and successful magazines for the next decade.

Yet, 1944 (both France and Belgium were liberated before war&#x27;s end) had already seen the start of the industry career of the French-Belgian Jean-Michel Charlier, in the process becoming one of its most towering figures. That year and a lawyer by trade, Charlier joined the newly formed comic syndication agency of Georges Troisfontaines, Belgium&#x27;s answer to King Features Syndicate. Originally hired as an editorial draughtsman, Troisfontaines recognized Charlier&#x27;s talent for writing and persuaded him to switch from drawing to scripting comics, something Charlier did with great success for the remainder of his life, creating close to three dozen series, several of them becoming classics of the Franco-Belgian &quot;bande dessinée&quot;. &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine became the agency&#x27;s first and foremost client, and the first post-war decade saw the infusion into the magazine with many new series from young, predominantly Belgian talents like Eddy Paape, Victor Hubinon, Mitacq, , instituting an era in which Jijé&#x27;s career truly took off with his best-known creation, the Western comic series &quot;Jerry Spring&quot;, that started its run in &quot;Spirou&quot; in March 1954. Jijé incidentally, had magazine tenure, but closely cooperated with the World Press artists before embarking on his own creation. Successful series Charlier himself created in this period were the educational short series &quot;Les Belles Histoires de l&#x27;oncle Paul&quot; (serving as proving ground in order to develop the talents and skills of young aspiring artists like Belgians Mitacq, , Hermann, Dino Attanasio and the Frenchman Jean Graton among others, several of whom switching over to industry competitor Lombard at a later point in their careers, most notably Hermann), &quot;Buck Danny&quot; (with Hubinon), &quot;La Patrouille des Castors&quot; (with Mitacq after his apprenticeship on &quot;L&#x27;oncle Paul&quot;) and &quot;Jean Valhardi&quot; (with Paape and Jijé). Aside from being a very prolific comic script writer, becoming his trademark henceforth, Charlier also became an editorial driving force and spokesperson for the agency, because of his background in law and his assertive personality. As such, he was responsible for introducing the two Frenchmen René Goscinny (who also starting out &quot;his&quot; comics career at the agency) and former &quot;Bravo&quot; artist Albert Uderzo to each other in 1951 at the in that year opened Paris, France, office of World Press, in the process creating one of Franco-Belgium&#x27;s most successful &quot;bande dessinée&quot; partnerships. One of the first comics both men created together in the employ of the agency was the in colonial French-Canada era set Western series &quot;Oumpah-pah&quot;, which was already conceived as loose gags in 1951, but failed to find a magazine publisher. Reworked into complete stories, the comic became successful in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine in the period 1958–1962 (and thus, alongside Martin&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Alix&quot;, one of the first purely French comics to appear in the Belgian magazine), effectively becoming the &quot;spiritual father&quot; of their later &quot;Asterix&quot; creation.

But it were not just the artists contracted by World Press who infused &quot;Spirou&quot; with its new elan, Dupuis itself had contracted a group of artists who were as much responsible for its success and then some as it was this group that defined the rejuvenated magazine in the post-war era. Upon war&#x27;s end three artists from the defunct animation studio CBA were hired by Dupuis as staff artists for &quot;Spirou&quot;, Eddy Paape (before he switched over to World Press), André Franquin and Maurice &quot;Morris&quot; De Bevere, and it was Morris who created in 1946 the second one of the great Franco-Belgian comic classics, &quot;Lucky Luke&quot;, which made it first appearance in the &quot;Almanach&quot; appendix issue of 7 December 1946. Franquin was passed the comic &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; by his mentor Jijé, who himself had taken over the series from original creator Rob-Vel in the war years, and it was Franquin who provided the series with its popularity, before he embarked for the magazine on his most popular creation &quot;Gaston&quot; in 1957. With the addition of artist Willy &quot;Will&quot; Maltaite, who took over the series &quot;Tif et Tondu&quot; from original creator Fernand Dineur, the group that became known as &quot;La bande des quatre&quot; (Gang of 4), consisting of Jijé, Franquin, Morris and Will, was complete and constituted the foundation of what was coined the &quot;Marcinelle school&quot;-style. However, such was the success of these artists, that the work of pre-war artists Rob-Vel and Dineur, was eclipsed by that of the younger generation, causing them to slide into oblivion. In 1952, another future great working in the Marcinelle school tradition was added to &quot;Spirou&quot;, artist Pierre &quot;Peyo&quot; Culliford upon introduction by Franquin. Peyo was actually a former colleague of Franquin at CBA, but was at the time of the demise of the animation studio not considered by Dupuis because of his young age. For &quot;Spirou&quot; Peyo continued with the series &quot;Johan et Pirlouit&quot;, which he had already started in 1947 for the Belgian newspapers &quot;La Dernière Heure&quot; and &quot;Le Soir&quot;. It was this series that in 1957 spawned another of the great Franco-Belgian comic classics, &quot;Les Schtroumpfs&quot; (&quot;The Smurfs&quot;). With both magazines firmly in place, it was the success of &quot;Spirou&quot; and &quot;Tintin&quot; that initiated what many fans &quot;and&quot; scholars consider the golden age of the (Franco-)Belgian comic. As a result, the American comics didn&#x27;t come back in as great a volume as before in both Belgium and France after the war, but in the case of France not for want of popularity, quite the contrary actually.

====The &quot;bande dessinée&quot; under siege in post-war France====
In France, a 1949 law about publications intended for the youth market was partly written by the French Communist Party, a major political force in France directly after the war (because of their highly successful and effective resistance in the war years), to actually exclude most of the American publications. The law, called &quot;&quot; (&quot;Law of July 16th 1949 on Publications Aimed at the Youth&quot;) and passed in response to the post-liberation influx of American comics, was invoked as late as 1969 to prohibit the comic magazine &quot;&quot; —which featured translated versions of Marvel Comics stories — after seven issues. The formal and official justification for the law was the legislative desire to protect the youth of France from the perfidious and corruptive influence perceived to permeate foreign comics, especially in regard to violence and sexuality, the American ones in particular (even though they were not mentioned by name in the law), and in this the French law actually foreshadowed the 1954 publication of the comic condemning treatise &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; by Fredric Wertham in the United States itself. But there was an equally important, but unofficial, reason for the law as well; American comics were doing so well in post-liberation France, that native comic magazines, particularly the Catholic ones, became threatened in their very existence, and the law therefore became concurrently a veiled market protection mechanism. An added sense of urgency was, besides the huge popularity the American magazines enjoyed among France&#x27;s youth, that the native publications had at that time a distinct disadvantage over their American counterparts as the country still experienced a serious post-war paper shortage (reflected as such in the poor paper quality, relatively low page count &quot;and&quot; lower circulation numbers of the native magazines of that era), something the higher quality American ones did not suffer from, they receiving preferential treatment under the Marshall Plan. The first targeted American comic for example, &quot;Tarzan&quot;, enjoyed a weekly circulation of 300,000 copies, twice the one &quot;Coeurs Vaillants&quot; had and dwarfing the 76,000 copy circulation of &quot;Tintin&quot;, and it was but one of the many American comics published in France in the immediate post-war era. It was the very reason for the unlikely French Catholic-Communist alliance in this regard, and a very effective one at that as American comics all but disappeared from the French comic scene for the time being, the &quot;Le Journal de Mickey&quot; excepted, which only reappeared three years later in former occupied western Europe.

It was not just American productions which were prohibited under the law, several Belgian French-language comic creations of the era also fell victim to the scrutiny of the oversight committee charged with upholding the law for varying reasons, as stipulated in its rather sweeping article 2 (presently article 3), which allowed for almost at will prohibition of comics for reasons that suited the policies of any French government in power at any given time. A famous example concerned the two Korean War volumes of the popular aviation comic series &quot;Buck Danny&quot;, created by Belgians Charlier (who as spokesperson for World Press/&quot;Spirou&quot; was actually summoned to appear in person for a board of inquiry at the French Ministry of Information to account for himself) and Hubinon, which were prohibited in 1954 as article 2 expressly forbade any mentioning of an actual, current armed conflict in a children&#x27;s publication – but also because communist members of the commission had issues with the strong anticommunist sentiment expressed in the comic according to writer Charlier. Both volumes remained prohibited in France until 1969, though French fans on holiday in Belgium, Switzerland or Luxembourg could pick up the albums unhindered over there. The law also came in handy to somewhat regulate – though not prohibiting – the availability in France of Belgian magazines like &quot;Spirou&quot; (which actually came close to prohibition however, as the Korean War stories were serialized in the magazine, but which was narrowly averted at the eleventh hour by Charlier) and &quot;Tintin&quot; in favor of the native Catholic magazines, after the conservatives had reasserted their political predominance in the country during the 1950s.

Rigorously enforced by the government oversight committee (Committee in Charge of Surveillance and Control over Publications Aimed at Children and Adolescents), particularly in the 1950s and the first half of the 1960s, the law turned out to be a stifling influence on the post-war development of the French comic world until the advent of &quot;Pilote&quot; magazine and more specifically the May 1968 social upheaval. Legally, the Commission had no punitive powers, only advisory ones, but in practice Charlier begged to differ. The all powerful Commission, shielded by the Justice Ministry (which &quot;was&quot; the punitive authority, but who took any and all Commission recommendations at face value, no questions asked), convened on a weekly basis, sifting through publications and weeding out those they felt subject to prohibition under the law, every decision they took being final, under no obligation to ever provide any formal justification whatsoever and without any possibility for appeal, which amounted to &quot;de facto&quot; state censorship according to Charlier.

Yet, it were also the communists who provided the comic scene in France with a single bright-spot; Having its origins in the communist wartime underground resistance publications, the comic magazine &quot;Vaillant&quot; (not to be confused with the two near-similarly named Fleurus publications) was launched in 1945 upon war&#x27;s end. The secular magazine provided a platform for predominantly native comic talent born between the 1920s and the 1940s, not able or willing to work for the Catholic magazines, to showcase their work. French names of note who started out their career in the magazine were among others Nikita Mandryka, Paul Gillon, Jean-Claude Forest and Marcel Gotlib, and were less beholden to what was then still the Belgian &quot;bande dessinée&quot; tradition, other native contemporaries were – in essence ranking among the first native French artists to provide the &quot;Franco&quot; element in what later would become the &quot;Franco-Belgian comics&quot; expression, with comic artist Marijac having been a trailblazer. Marijac actually started out for &quot;Coeurs Vaillants&quot; in the 1930s, but distanced himself from the magazine directly after the liberation, when he started the secular comics magazine &quot;&quot; (1944–1963), France&#x27;s first recognizable modern &quot;bande dessinée&quot; magazine. Marijac himself became a prolific figure of note in the French comic scene of the 1950s as co-editor and contributor for a series of native comic magazines other than his own &quot;Coq Hardi&quot;, and conceived in the era under the shadow of the all-present Catholic publications to fill the void left by the banned American comics such as &quot;Les Grandes Séries Internationales&quot;, &quot;Cricri Journal&quot;, &quot;Mireille&quot;, &quot;Ouest-Magazine&quot;, &quot;Nano et Nanette&quot;, &quot;Héros du Far West&quot;, &quot;Frimousse&quot;, &quot;Cocorico&quot; and &quot;Allez-France&quot;, all of which filled with work from French artists, now forgotten save Marijac himself (who was honored for his efforts at the 1979 Angoulême comics festival with its most prestigious award), along with the magazines they created their work for.

It has been observed that, unlike the Belgian publications, these mostly secular native magazines were largely left alone by the Commission de Surveillance, save for one notable exception; Pierre Mouchot, creator and editor of American inspired comic magazines in the immediate post-war era, was on recommendation of the Commission persecuted for his likewise American (and Italian) inspired comic series &quot;Big Bill le Casseur&quot; and &quot;P’tit Gars&quot;, having to appear in court no less than eight times in the period 1950 - 1954, actually winning most of his cases in the lower courts. While both he and his creations are likewise forgotten, Mouchot became the only French comics artist to be legally persecuted, &quot;and&quot; ultimately convicted by the highest court of appeal (though only receiving symbolic punishment) under article 2 of the 1949 law for real. However, the conviction &quot;did&quot; serve as an effective deterrent for other native artists – and thus firmly establishing the Commission as a force to be reckoned with, even though they had a tough time becoming so as Mouchot kept winning his lower court cases – who continued to create their comics while erring on the side of caution for the next decade. It is in this light that some of the other early French contemporary greats, such as Martin, Graton, Uderzo and his writing partner Goscinny opted to start out their careers for Belgian comic publications, neither wanting to submit themselves to the scrutiny of the Commission de Surveillance directly, nor wanting to work for either the Catholic or communist magazines for personal reasons.

The situation in Belgium was nowhere near as restrictive as it was in France. Catholics, who were the dominant factor in politics in the country as well at the time, did not have to contend with the negligible influence of the communists, contrary to their French counterparts. There was actually no need perceived for regulating measures in Belgium as American productions, contrary to France, were already supplanted in popularity by the native comics (aided by the fact that Belgium had not seen the massive influx of American comics in the same measure France had, as Belgium had been predominantly liberated by British and Canadian forces, whose soldiers did not bring along their comics in the same volume the Americans did), whereas the majority of Belgian comics artists were either Catholics themselves (or at least sympathetic to the faith) such as Jijé (whose early realistic works were deeply steeped in the faith), or had, like Hergé did, strong ties with the as &quot;healthy&quot; considered scouting movement – a significant presence in Belgian society at the time, which also explains the contemporary popularity of Charlier&#x27;s &quot;La patrouille des Castor&quot; series in Belgium, which was centered around a scouting chapter – and were thus, to use the modern expression, already &quot;politically correct&quot; in the first place, that is from the Belgian perspective at least. However, the incident Charlier had experienced with the Commission shook up the editors of &quot;Spirou&quot; and &quot;Tintin&quot;, and as France was a too important market to lose, they too henceforth chose to err on the side of caution by screening the creations of their artists before magazine publication, essentially being forced by the French to exercise self-censorship. Having already embarked on their divergent evolutionary path, Flemish comics escaped this kind of scrutiny, as they were at the time rarely, if at all, translated into French.

===1959–1974: Scale tips to France===
In 1959, the influential French weekly &quot;Pilote&quot; launched, already from the start an attempt to be a more mature alternative to &quot;Spirou&quot; and &quot;Pilote&quot;, aimed at a teenage audience, with the &quot;Asterix&quot; series as an almost instantaneous success. The audience radicalized at a faster pace than the editors, however, which had trouble keeping up. The French satire magazine &quot;Hara-Kiri&quot; was launched, also aimed at an adult audience.

In the 1960s, most of the French Catholic magazines, such as the Fleurus publications, waned in popularity, as they were &quot;re-christianized&quot; and went to a more traditional style with more text and fewer drawings. This meant that in France, magazines like &quot;Pilote&quot; and &quot;Vaillant&quot; (relaunched as &quot;Pif gadget&quot; in 1969), and &quot;Spirou&quot; and &quot;Tintin&quot; for French-speaking Belgium, gained almost the entire market and became the obvious goal for new artists from their respective countries, who took up the styles prevalent in those magazines to break into the business.

With a number of publishers in place, including Dargaud (&quot;Pilote&quot;), Le Lombard (&quot;Tintin&quot;), and Dupuis (&quot;Spirou&quot;), three of the biggest influences for over 50 years, the market for domestic comics had reached (commercial) maturity. In the following decades, magazines like &quot;Spirou&quot;, &quot;Tintin&quot;, &quot;Vaillant&quot; (relaunched as &quot;Pif Gadget&quot; in 1969), &quot;Pilote&quot;, and (the first to feature completed stories in each issue, as opposed to the episodic approach of other magazines) would dominate the market. At this time, the French creations had already gained fame throughout Europe, and many countries had started importing the comics in addition to—or as substitute for—their own productions.

===1974–1990: France becomes preeminent===

The aftermath of the May 1968 social upheaval brought many mature – as in aimed at an adult readership – BD magazines, something that had not been seen previously and virtually all of them of purely French origin, which was also indicative of France rapidly becoming the preeminent force in the (continental) European BD world, eventually usurping the position the Belgians held until then. &quot;L&#x27;Écho des Savanes&quot; (from new publisher , founded by &quot;Pilote&quot; defectors Nikita Mandryka, Claire Bretécher and Marcel Gotlib), with Gotlib&#x27;s pornography watching deities and Bretécher&#x27;s &quot;Les Frustrés&quot; (&quot;The Frustrated Ones&quot;), and &quot;Le Canard Sauvage&quot; (&quot;The Wild Duck/ Mag&quot;), an art-zine featuring music reviews and BDs, were among the earliest. Following suit was &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; (vol. 1: December 1974 – July 1987 from also new French publisher Les Humanoïdes Associés, founded by likewise &quot;Pilote&quot; defectors, Druillet, Jean-Pierre Dionnet and Mœbius) with the far-reaching science fiction and fantasy of Mœbius, Druillet, and Bilal. Its translated counterpart made an impact in America as &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;. This trend continued during the seventies, until the original &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; folded in the early eighties, living on only in the American edition, which soon had an independent development from its French-language parent. Nonetheless, it were these publications and their artists which are generally credited with the revolutionizing and emancipation of the Franco-Belgian BD world. As indicated, most of these early adult magazines were established by former &quot;Pilote&quot; BD artists, who had left the magazine to break out on their own, after they had staged a revolt in the editorial offices of Dargaud, the publisher of &quot;Pilote&quot;, during the 1968 upheaval, demanding and ultimately receiving more creative freedom from then editor-in-chief René Goscinny (see also: &quot;Jean &quot;Mœbius&quot; Giraud on his part in the uprising at Pilote&quot;&quot;).

Essentially, these new magazines along with other contemporaries of their kind, were the French counterparts of the slightly earlier American underground comix, also conceived and popularized as a result of the counterculture of the 1960s, of which the French May 1968 events were only a part. But unlike their American counterparts, the French magazines were mainstream from the start when they eventually burst onto the scene in the early 1970s, as publications of this kind could not escape the scrutiny of the Commission de Surveillance prior to 1968, as editor François Cavanna of the satirical magazine &quot;Hara-Kiri&quot; (launched in 1960) had experienced several times to his detriment, having had to reinvent his magazine on several occasions. Aside from the creative aspects, the 1960s brought in effect another kind of freedom for French BD artists as well - commercial and financial freedom. Until the revolt in the offices of &quot;Pilote&quot;, artists worked in a studio system, namely a tenured exclusive working relationship at the magazine or publisher, with artists having little to no control over both commercial and creative aspects of their creations – except for a few artists who also held editorial offices at publishing houses such as Goscinny, Charlier and Greg, the former of which incidentally, having also been a major element for the revolt at &quot;Pilote&quot;. That changed as well after 1968, when more and more artists decided to ply their trade as free-lancers, the &quot;L&#x27;Écho des Savanes&quot; founders having been early pioneers in that respect, and has as of 2017 become the predominant artist-publisher relationship. While contracts tend to be long-term for specific series at a particular publisher, they no longer prevent artists, like the below-mentioned François Bourgeon and Hermann Huppen, to create other BDs for other publishers, sometimes even suspending a series for the one in favor of a series for the other.

The advent of the new adult magazines had a profound effect on France&#x27;s hitherto most influential BD magazine &quot;Pilote&quot;. Editor-in-chief Goscinny had at first refused to implement the changes demanded by its artists during the 1968 revolt in the editorial offices, but he now found himself suddenly confronted with the magazine hemorrhaging its most promising BD talents and diminishing sales. The magazine was eventually turned into a monthly magazine, its artists who had not yet left given more creative freedoms and the Belgian influence terminated definitively with the departure of co-editor Charlier in 1972 and the last Belgian artists Hubinon and Jijé following suit a short time thereafter, transforming the magazine into a purely French one. However, while the magazine was now targeted at an older adolescent readership with stories featuring more mature themes, Goscinny stopped short of letting the magazine become a truly adult magazine. Yet, the magazine was unable to regain the dominant position it had held in the previous one-and-a-half decade, due to the flooding of the market with alternatives.

Lagging behind the French for the first time in regard to the more mature BDs, the Belgians made good on their arrear when publisher Casterman launched the magazine &quot;(À Suivre)&quot; (&quot;Wordt Vervolgd&quot; for its Dutch-language counterpart, both of which translating into English as &quot;To Be Continued&quot;) in October 1977. Until then the old venerable publisher (est. in 1780 as a printing and publishing company) had somewhat limited itself as the album publisher of Hergé&#x27;s &quot;Tintin&quot; since 1934, slightly expanded upon after the war with a couple of Hergé inspired creations by closely affiliated artists such as Jacques Martin, François Craenhals and the Danish C. &amp; V. Hansen couple. It was with the specific intent to expand beyond the somewhat limited Hergé boundaries with other, more diverse high quality work, that the publisher launched &quot;(À Suivre)&quot;, which printed BD creations by Ted Benoît, Jacques Tardi, Hugo Pratt, François Schuiten, Paul Teng and many others from French, Italian and/or Dutch origins, but relatively few from Belgian artist as there were not that many active in the adult field at that time, with Schuiten, Didier Comès – as already stated, one of the very few &quot;BD&quot; artists of German-Belgian descent, alongside Hermann Huppen – and being three of the few exceptions. It was &quot;(À Suivre)&quot; that popularized the concept of the graphic novel – in French abbreviated as &quot;Roman BD&quot;, &quot;roman&quot; being the translation for &quot;novel&quot; – as a longer, more adult, more literate and artistic BD in Europe. Unlike its Dupuis counterpart, and while their BD catalog has expanded considerably since then, Casterman has never evolved into a purely BD publisher by completely abandoning its book publishing roots, as it is currently also a prolific publisher of children&#x27;s books.

Yet, it remained French publications and French artists who would continue to dominate the field from the late-1970s onward to this day, with such (sometimes short-lived) magazines as &quot;Bananas&quot;, &quot;Virus&quot;, &quot;Mormoil&quot;, the feminist &quot;&quot;, &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;Fluide Glacial&quot;. It were in these such magazines that a younger, post-war generation of French BD artists like Yves Chaland, Édika and debuted, whereas veterans like Gotlib and Franquin found a home for their later, darker and more cynical work.

A major player in the field became French publisher and newcomer Glénat Éditions (founded in 1972, and who actually started out publishing graphic novels directly as albums before the launch of &quot;Circus&quot;) with their two main magazine publications &#x27; (1975–1989) and &#x27; (1985–1994, with emphasis on mature stories of an accurate historical nature), featuring predominantly the work of French BD talents, but who did so with a twist; Glénat targeted their magazines at a readership positioned between the adolescent readership of &quot;Pilote&quot;, &quot;Tintin&quot; and &quot;Spirou&quot; and the mature readership of such magazines as &quot;(À Suivre)&quot;, &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; and others. French BD artists of note who were nurtured into greatness in the Glénat publications were among others Mayko and Patrick Cothias, but most conspicuously François Bourgeon and André Juillard. Exemplary of the different, older target audience Glénat was aiming at, became the two finite, historical series Bourgeon created; &quot;Les Passagers du vent&quot; (1979–2009, &quot;The Passengers of the Wind&quot;, seven volumes, set in 18th-century seafaring and slave trading Europe, becoming one of the first BD series to deal realistically in considerable detail with the dark slavery chapter in human history) and &quot;Les Compagnons du crépuscule&quot; (1983–1989, &quot;Companions of the Dusk&quot;, three volumes, set in 13th-century Europe and published by Casterman incidentally). Both series made short work of any romantic notion about the two historic eras still lingering in anyone&#x27;s subconscious because of imagery imbued upon them by 1940s–1960s Hollywood movie productions or Franco-Belgian &quot;bandes dessinées&quot; as published in &quot;Coeurs Vaillants&quot;, &quot;Tintin&quot; or &quot;Spirou&quot; in the same era for that matter. Renowned for his meticulous research into the subject matter of the BD series he was creating, not seldom taking as long as it took him to create the series in question, Bourgeon depicted an historical reality devoid of any so-called &quot;heroes&quot;, only featuring common people who were as often victimized as they were heroic, living in a world which was brutally hard while living a live which was therefore all too often very short for the common man, being habitually subjugated to the will of the powerful without any recourse whatsoever to objective justice, especially the women. Bourgeon however, made his harsh message to his readership palatable by his relatively soft art style and his optimistic view regarding human resilience. No such respite was afforded the reader however with Hermann&#x27;s 11th-century epos &quot;Les Tours de Bois-Maury&quot; (1984–1994, &quot;The Towers of Bois-Maury&quot;), whose original ten-volume series was serialized in &quot;Vécu&quot; in the same era Bourgeon&#x27;s &quot;Passagers&quot; was in &quot;Circus&quot;; Not only did Hermann&#x27;s stark and uncompromising art style served to reinforce the grim atmosphere of his medieval settings, any and all redeeming optimistic commentary on human nature was also lacking in his narrative, quite the contrary actually, making his Middle Ages truly the Dark Ages where the vast majority of humanity was living short, violent lives in abject squalor, with not a single so-called &quot;hero&quot; in sight anywhere in his series. To hammer home the point, both artists had their medieval knights, around whom both narratives were centered, die violent deaths nowhere near the fulfillment of their respective quests, thereby reinforcing the futility of such endeavors. With such series driving home the point that real history is made by mere humans and not &quot;super-humans&quot;, the Franco-Belgian historical BD had come a long way since their first romanticized and/or idealized appearances in the 1940s–1970s, particularly in &quot;Tintin&quot; and &quot;Pilote&quot; as portrayed by such artists as the (&quot;Le Chevalier blanc&quot;, &quot;Harald le Viking&quot;, &quot;Lieutenant Burton&quot;), William Vance (&quot;Howard Flynn&quot;, &quot;Rodric&quot;, &quot;Ramiro&quot;), François Craenhals (&quot;Chevalier Ardent&quot;) or Victor Hubinon (&quot;Barbe Rouge&quot;), to name but a few.

====The &quot;bande dessinée&quot; becomes cultural heritage====
It was not just the BD scene these new publications and their artists changed, the perception of the medium in French society also changed radically in the 1970s–1980s, in stark contrast to the one it held in the 1940s–1950s. Recognizing that the medium-advanced France&#x27;s cultural status in the world, the cultural authorities of the nation started to aid the advancement of the medium as a bonafide art form, especially under the patronage of Minister of Culture Jack Lang, who had formulated his long-term &quot;Quinze mesures nouvelles en faveur de la Bande dessinée&quot; (&quot;15 new measures in favor of the BD&quot;) ministry policy plan in 1982, which was updated and reaffirmed by a latter-day successor of Lang in 1997. It was consequently in the 1980s–1990s era that the medium achieved its formal status in France&#x27;s &quot;Classification des arts&quot; (&quot;Classifications of the arts&quot;) as &quot;Le Neuvième Art&quot; (&quot;the 9th art&quot;), aside from becoming accepted as a mature part of French culture by Francophone society at large (in France and French-speaking Belgium it is as common to encounter grownup people reading BDs in public places, such as cafe terraces or public transportation, as it is people reading books, newspapers or magazines). Since then more than one BD artist have received &quot;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot; civilian knighthoods, and these were not restricted to French nationals alone, as Japanese artist Jiro Taniguchi has also received one in 2011 for his efforts to merge the Franco-Belgian BD with the Japanese manga format (see &quot;below&quot;).

But it is however Jean &quot;Mœbius&quot; Giraud, coined &quot;the most influential &quot;bandes dessinées&quot; artist after Hergé&quot; by several academic BD scholars, who is considered the premier French standard bearer of &quot;Le Neuvième Art&quot;, as he has received two different civilian knighthoods with a posthumous rank elevation of his Arts and Letters knighthood to boot, an unicum for a BD artist and something the &quot;de facto&quot; inventor of the Franco-Belgian BD, Hergé, has never achieved even once, not even from his own native country Belgium (presumably because of the lingering impressions left by either the criticisms regarding his early &quot;Tintin&quot; stories, the post-war collaboration allegations, or both and neither of which he had ever managed to fully free himself from in his lifetime). Exemplary of Mœbius&#x27; standing in French culture, was the high-status, high-profile «Mœbius transe forme» exposition the prestigious Parisian Fondation Cartier pour l&#x27;Art Contemporain art museum organized from 2 October 2010 – 13 March 2011. As of 2017, it stands out as one of the largest exhibitions ever dedicated to the work of an individual BD artist by an official, state-sanctioned art museum – art as in art with a capital &quot;A&quot; – alongside the 20 December 2006 - 19 February 2007 Hergé exposition in the even more prestigious Centre Georges Pompidou modern art museum (likewise located in Paris and incidentally one of President Mitterrand&#x27;s below-mentioned &quot;Great Works&quot;) on the occasion of the centenary of that artist&#x27;s birth. Giraud&#x27;s funeral services in March 2012 was attended by a representative of the French nation in the person of Minister of Culture Frédéric Mitterrand, who also spoke on behalf of the nation at the services, and who was incidentally also the nephew of former President of France François Mitterrand, who had personally awarded Giraud with his first civilian knighthood in 1985, thereby becoming one of the first BD artists to be bestowed the honor. Giraud&#x27;s death was a considerable media event in France, but ample attention was also given to his demise in press releases all around the world in even as faraway places like Indonesia (&quot;Jakarta Globe&quot;, 11 March 2012), a country not particularly known for a thriving comic culture. Yet, and despite the nation having embraced the &quot;bande dessinée&quot;, it should also be noted that both the law of 1949 and its oversight committee are as of 2017 still in existence, their legitimacy remaining as intact as it was in 1949. And while their impact and influence have significantly diminished in the wake of the events of 1968, their continued legal existence in the fringes does constitute the proverbial &quot;Sword of Damocles&quot; for the French BD world, despite artists, publishers, politicians and academics having questioned the relevance of both manifestations in a modern world in a public debate during a 1999 national conference organized on the subject by the (CNBDI), France&#x27;s largest and most important BD organization.

Belgium, where the modern Franco-Belgian BD format was conceived after all, was somewhat slower in advancing the format as a bonafide art form, but has strongly followed suit in considering the Franco-Belgian BD as a &quot;key aspect of Belgium&#x27;s cultural heritage&quot;. While the expression &quot;the 9th art&quot; has been popularized in other countries as well, Belgium and France remain as of 2017, the only countries where the medium has been accorded the formal status (when discounting the manga, which has achieved a near-similar status in native Japan), with its resultant strong backing from cultural authorities.
A visible manifestation of the latter has become the prestigious &quot;Centre belge de la Bande dessinée&quot; (Dutch: &quot;Belgisch Centrum voor het Beeldverhaal&quot;, English: &quot;Belgian Comic Strip Center&quot;) established in 1989 in the Belgian capital Brussels, and which, as one of the largest BD museum in Europe, draws in 200,000 visitors annually. The museum is housed in a state-owned 1905 building designed by architect Victor Horta in the Art Nouveau style, the same style French female artist Annie Goetzinger has employed for her BDs. Belgium possesses two other, smaller, museums dedicated to individual BD artists, the Marc Sleen Museum (est. 2009), located across the street of the Comic Center and dedicated to the work of the namesake Flemish BD creator, and, unsurprisingly, the especially built Musée Hergé (est. 2009) located in Louvain-la-Neuve, its interiors designed by Dutch BD artist Joost Swarte, who had worked in the Hergé tradition.

In France, Minister Jack Lang – who hit upon the idea after he had visited the permanent &quot;bande dessinée&quot; exhibition in the town&#x27;s art museum in 1982, incidentally inspiring his long-term fifteen points policy plan for the medium that year, which included the establishment of a national BD museum – announced in 1984 the advent of a major national &quot;bande dessinée&quot; museum as part of President Mitterrand&#x27;s grand scheme of providing the nation with major public works of a cultural nature (in France coined as &quot;Grandes Operations d&#x27;Architecture et d&#x27;Urbanisme&quot;), to be housed in the historical town of Angoulême, already the locus of France&#x27;s biggest annual BD festival since 1974. A major project in the making, involving the renovation of several ancient buildings and the designing of a new one spread over the grounds of the town&#x27;s former brewery by renowned architect Roland Castro, the museum, , only opened its doors in June 2009 (though two smaller sub-museums, eventually incorporated in the larger final one, were already open to the public as early as 1991) in the process becoming the largest BD museum in Europe. The museum is administered by the CNBDI, established in 1985 for upcoming museum, but which has since then expanded its work on behalf of the &quot;bande dessinée&quot; beyond the confines of the museum alone, as already indicated above. On 11 December 2012, one of the buildings on the museum grounds, the futuristic building finished at the end of the 1980s housing the museum and CNBDI administrations, cinema, conference rooms, library and the other facilities for comics studies, was rechristened &quot;Le Vaisseau Mœbius&quot; (English: &quot;The Vessel Mœbius&quot;), in honor of the in that year deceased BD artist. When Lang had presented his plans, he was faced with opposition from some politicians who had rather seen such a museum in the capital of France, Paris. These politicians did have a point however, as Angoulême is somewhat located off the beaten tourist track, resulting in that the museum only draws in about roughly half the visitor numbers its smaller Belgian counterpart does annually, and most of them visiting the museum during the festival season, whereas the Belgian museum draws in a steady stream of visitors all year round.

===1990–present===
A further revival and expansion came in the 1990s with several small independent publishers emerging, such as L&#x27;Association (established in 1990), Le Dernier Cri, Amok, Fréon (the latter two later merging into Frémok), and Ego comme X. Known as &quot;la nouvelle bande dessinée&quot; (similar to the North American alternative comics), these books are often more artistic, graphically and narratively, than the usual products of the big companies.

Dupuy and Berberian, Lewis Trondheim, Joann Sfar, Marjane Satrapi (&quot;Persepolis&quot;), Christophe Blain, Stéphane Blanquet, Edmond Baudoin, David B, and Emmanuel Larcenet all started their careers with these publishers, and would later gain fame with comics such as &quot;Donjon&quot; (Trondheim &amp; Sfar), &quot;Isaac the Pirate&quot; (Blain), &quot;Professeur Bell&quot; (Sfar). Léo Quievreux, a key artist in the 1990s scene, founded and ran his own publication house, Gotoproduction, which he ran along with Jean Kristau and Anne-Fred Maurer from 1991 to 2000 or 2001, and which published over 60 books.

==Formats==
Before the Second World War, comics were almost exclusively published in tabloid newspapers. Since 1945, the &quot;comic album&quot; (or &quot;comics album&quot;, in French &quot;album BD&quot; for short) format gained popularity, a book-like format about half the former size. The albums, usually colored all the way through, are almost always hardcover for the French editions and softcover for the Dutch editions—though the hardcover format has steadily gained ground from the late-1980s onward as customer option alongside the softcover format, contrary to Francophone Europe, where the hardcover format is the norm. When compared to American comic books and trade paperbacks (such as the later American graphic novel format), the European albums are rather large (roughly A4 standard). Comic albums started to receive their own individual ISBNs from the mid-1970s onward all over Europe solidifying their status as books.

Conceived as a format as currently understood in Belgium with the first &quot;Tintin&quot; albums in the early 1930s—incidentally the second reason for considering &quot;Tintin&quot; the starting point of the modern Franco-Belgian comic, besides the art style and format—albums were usually published as a collected book &quot;after&quot; a story or a convenient number of short stories had finished their run in serialized magazine (pre-)publication, usually with a one to two year lag. Since the inception of the format, it has been common for these albums to contain either 46 (for decades &quot;the&quot; standard) or, to a lesser degree, 62 pages (discounting the two disclaimer, and title pages) for print and binding technical reasons as printers traditionally printed eight double-sided pages on one sheet of print paper, though albums with a larger page count—provided the total page count is a multiple of eight—are not that uncommon, the graphic novel album publications of &quot;À Suivre&quot; publisher Casterman in particular.

It is in this field that Jean-Michel Charlier again turned out to be a seminal influence for the cultural phenomenon . As publishing co-editor of &quot;Pilote&quot;, it was he who initiated a line of comic albums, for Dargaud, collecting the stories as serialized in the magazine until then, becoming in effect Dargaud&#x27;s first comic album releases. The first July 1961 title in the series, coined &quot;La Collection Pilote&quot;, was the first adventure of &quot;Asterix&quot; from Uderzo and Goscinny, a runaway success right from the bat, followed by sixteen further titles from the magazine, with the first &quot;Blueberry&quot; adventure, &quot;Fort Navajo&quot;, becoming the last to be released in July 1965. After that, the collection was suspended and each comic hero(s) hitherto featured therein, spun off in album series of their own. In order to give these releases a more &quot;mature&quot; book-like image, the albums were from the very start executed as hardcover editions for France, while being executed in softcover by licensee Le Lombard for Charlier&#x27;s own native Belgium, somewhat reflecting the status comic albums still had in that country, as it had in other European countries. Charlier&#x27;s initiative was not entirely devoid of a healthy dose of self-interest, as over half the releases in the collection were titles form comic series he had (co-)created. While Charlier did not conceive the format as such—since Casterman already released such albums since the early 1930s (&quot;Tintin&quot;), as did Dupuis sometime thereafter with some of its releases, but certainly not all as most of its albums like the &quot;Buck Danny&quot; series were released in softcover at the time – &quot;his&quot; albums were more than favorably received however, and the collection has attained a mythical status in the world of Franco-Belgian comics, especially in France where such releases had until then been rarities at best – excepting the &quot;recuil&quot; magazine series releases, album-like hard/softcover editions, chronologically collecting several magazine issues into one volume like &quot;Coeurs Vaillants&quot;, &quot;Spirou&quot; etc. and for decades a staple in Francophone Europe (and after the War, in Dutch-Europe as well).

It was only after the runaway success of the &quot;Collection&quot; that the hardcover became the norm for album releases in France. Even though the success of the collection prompted Le Lombard to speed up its hitherto lackluster album releases, they did so initially in the predominant soft cover format until the mid-1970s like Dupuis was already doing, while maintaining the softcover format as standard for the Dutch-language editions for decades thereafter, as did Dargaud. Being a relative newcomer in the field Dargaud entered into a joint venture for the album releases with Le Lombard for nearly two decades. This meant that Dargaud album titles were released by Lombard for French-speaking Belgium (initially as soft covers in the first decade) and with a couple of years lag, for Dutch-Belgium as well (for the Netherlands and likewise with a lag, Dargaud sought out cooperation with other, local publishers for their releases), whereas Lombard album titles were released in France by Dargaud, invariably as hardcovers for their own releases, but in softcover for the first five years or so for the Lombard releases before permanently switching to hardcover, even before Lombard did for its Belgian home market. By the late 1970s, Dargaud had its own international distribution system in place, and the cooperation with Le Lombard was dissolved, that is until both were merged into a single publisher in 1992 – though maintaining their respective imprints – after they were absorbed in 1988 and 1986 respectively into the French holding company Média-Participations. Incidentally, Dupuis was in June 2004 bought by Média-Participations as well, though it has retained its separate status within the holding group because of its traditional focus on a somewhat younger readership than Dargaud/Le Lombard.

Since the mid-1980s, many comics are published directly as albums and do not appear in the magazines at all, as many comic magazines have disappeared since then for socio-economic reasons, including greats like &quot;Tintin&quot;, &quot;À Suivre&quot;, &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot;, and &quot;Pilote&quot;. The album format has also been adopted for native comics in most other European countries (the United Kingdom having until recently been one of the most manifest exceptions), as well as being maintained in foreign translations, in the process becoming the preeminent publication format of comics on the European continent, including the former Eastern Bloc after the fall of the wall in 1989. As with the Dutch-language editions, the soft cover format was initially the predominant format in which the foreign editions were released, but like the Dutch editions, the hard cover format has steadily gained ground in the other European countries as well, with Spain and Portugal having been early adopters as several volumes from &quot;La Collection Pilote&quot; were already released as such in the second half of the 1960s by local Dargaud/Lombard affiliated publishers, albeit as separate series contrary to the &quot;Collection&quot; source publication.

===Intégrales===
Since the mid-1980s, many of the popular, longer-lasting album series, and also several long out-of-print classic series, also get their own hardcover collected &quot;omnibus&quot; album editions, or &quot;intégrales&quot;, with each intégrale book generally containing two to five (sequential) titles of the series&#x27; original individual album releases, and from the mid-1990s onward increasingly including several &quot;inédits&quot; habitually – material that hasn&#x27;t been published in albums before, such as magazine covers not used for albums – as well, alongside detailed illustrated editorials providing background information on the series in question and its creator(s), predominantly written by native comics scholars of which , , and are the most prolific ones (see &quot;below&quot;). A practical reason for publishers to proceed in this manner, is the more recent fact that these older series have to some extent ran their courses in decades-long reprint runs of the individual volumes, and that it has commercially become more expedient to re-issue sold out volumes in this format, instead of continuing to reprint the individual volumes, aside from tapping into a new replacement market by targeting the nostalgia of now grown-up and more affluent readers who want to upgrade their worn-out individual copies they had bought and read as youths. Initially only released in French and, to a lesser degree, Dutch, these editions have after the late-1990s surged in popularity, becoming increasingly popular in other European countries as well in (hardcover) translation, where the &quot;intégrale&quot; format is in some cases also employed for native comics, particularly in Spain, The Netherlands and Germany, a few of them reciprocally translated into French. All of the great Franco-Belgian comic publishing houses, still in existence, are as of 2017 engaged in releasing &quot;intégrales&quot;, either by themselves, or by licensing them out to local publishers for other European countries – or both, as is the case for Dutch language editions.

==Styles==
While more recent comics can no longer be easily categorized into one art style anymore (due to the increasing blurring of the boundaries between the styles in more recent comic creations – aside from the introduction of new and/or other art styles), and the old artists who pioneered the market are retiring, there were initially three basic, distinct styles within the field prior to the mid-1970s, featured in those comics with Belgian pedigree in particular.

One of the early greats, Belgian Joseph &quot;Jijé&quot; Gilian, was noted for creating comics in all three styles, the schematic style for his early work, &quot;comic-dynamic&quot; style for his later humoristic comics, as well as creating comics in the realistic style. The latter style he acquired during World War II when he had to complete realistic comics such as Fred Harman&#x27;s &quot;Red Ryder&quot; after the occupying Germans prohibited the import of these American comics. At first influenced by the style of such American artists like Harman, Jijé developed a realistic style distinctively his own (and thus European), and which became a major source of inspiration for future French/Belgian talents aspiring a career in creating realistic comics, the first and foremost of them having been Jean Giraud. Another of these Jijé-inspired youngsters was Jean-Claude Mézières, who actually started out his famed science-fiction creation &quot;Valérian and Laureline&quot; in the &quot;comic-dynamic&quot; style, but which quickly gravitated towards the realistic style, though traces of the former remain discernible in the depictions of his aliens, which therefore constituted an early example of the mixing of the three basic art styles. Another ambiguous, even earlier, example concerned the creations of Victor Hubinon (&quot;Buck Danny&quot;, &quot;Redbeard&quot;), who created comics in his own distinct style that had the characteristics of both the realistic and schematic styles, but which can not be unambiguously be categorized as either, or at the most be categorized as an &quot;in between&quot; style.

===Realistic style===
The realistic comics are often laboriously detailed. An effort is made to make the comics look as convincing, as natural as possible, while still being drawings. No speed lines or exaggerations are used. This effect is often reinforced by the coloring, which is less even, less primary than schematic or comic-dynamic comics.
Famous examples are &quot;Jerry Spring&quot; by Jijé, &quot;Blueberry&quot; by Giraud, and &quot;Thorgal&quot; by Rosiński.

===Comic-dynamic style===
This is the almost Barksian line of Franquin and Uderzo. The humoristic comics in &quot;Pilote&quot; were almost exclusively comic-dynamic, and so were the ones in &quot;Spirou&quot; and &quot;l&#x27;Écho des savanes&quot;. These comics have very agitated drawings, often using lines of varying thickness to accent the drawings. The artists working in this style for Spirou, including Franquin, Morris, Jean Roba and Peyo, are often grouped as the Marcinelle school.

===Schematic style (&quot;ligne claire&quot; style)===
The major factor in schematic drawings is a reduction of reality to easy, clear lines. Typical is the lack of shadows, the geometrical features, and the realistic proportions. Another trait is the often &quot;slow&quot; drawings, with little to no speed-lines, and strokes that are almost completely even. It is also known as the Belgian clean line style or &quot;ligne claire&quot;. &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; is not only a very good example of this, it is currently also considered as &quot;the&quot; original template for the style as used in modern European comics. Other works in this style are the early comics of Jijé, who not only worked in the style, but also expanded upon it by adding Art Déco elements resulting in what several scholars came to consider a separate spin-off style, coined the &quot;Atom style&quot;. This Jijé specific comics style enjoyed a revival in later works from French, Flemish and Dutch artists like Yves Chaland, Ever Meulen and Joost Swarte respectively, the latter of whom incidentally, having actually coined the alternative &quot;ligne clair&quot; designation in 1977.

Even though Jijé has somewhat receded in oblivion outside his own native Belgium, he is held in high esteem by many of his peers, both those he tutored like Franquin and Moebius, and others, and his versatility was such that it solicited an accolade of high praise from fellow artist Tibet, author of &quot;Ric Hochet&quot; and &quot;Chick Bill&quot;, who has stated that &quot;If Hergé is considered as God the Father, then Jijé undoubtedly is the Godfather&quot;. After Jijé, it were predominantly French (Philippe Druillet, Jean Giraud as &quot;Mœbius&quot;, Jacques Tardi, Annie Goetzinger, Fred) and Italian (Guido Crepax, Hugo Pratt, Lorenzo Mattotti, Attilio Micheluzzi) comics artists who increasingly introduced alternative art styles – sometimes extensive innovations/modernizations/expansions of the three existing basic styles, sometimes entirely new – in the medium from the mid-1970s onward, either by creating them directly for native publications, or by becoming major influences through translations which in Francophone Europe was especially the case for the Italians.

==Foreign comics==

=== Comics from other European countries ===
Despite the large number of local publications, the French and Belgian editors release numerous adaptations of comics from all over the world. In particular these include other European publications, from countries such as, most conspicuously, Italy with Guido Crepax, Hugo Pratt and Milo Manara among many others, and to a somewhat lesser degree Spain, with Daniel Torres, and Argentina, with Alberto Breccia, Héctor Germán Oesterheld and José Antonio Muñoz. Some well-known German (Andreas, Matthias Schultheiss), Swiss (Derib, Job, , Zep, Enrico Marini) and Polish (Grzegorz Rosinski) authors work almost exclusively for the Franco-Belgian market and their publishers such as Glénat and, most conspicuously, Le Lombard. Likewise, the French naturalized Yugoslav Enki Bilal worked exclusively for French publishers Dargaud and subsequently Les Humanoïdes Associés, whereas Dutch graphic novelist Paul Teng has, after his career failed to take off in his native country, first worked for Casterman before switching to Le Lombard and subsequently to Dargaud.

=== Comics from the United States and United Kingdom===
Classic American and British comic books, those of the traditional superhero genres in particular, are not as well represented in the French and Belgian comics market, for the reasons as explored above. However, the graphic novel work of Will Eisner and Art Spiegelman (first published in French in &quot;À Suivre&quot;) is respected to such a high extent that it has actually led to the adoption of the English expression in mainland Europe as well, particularly for such mature works as published by Casterman or Les Humanoïdes Associés. Nonetheless, a few comic strips like &quot;Peanuts&quot; and &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; have had considerable success in France and Belgium. Yet, it was in the field of the graphic novels that American and British creations &quot;did&quot; attract attention from the Franco-Belgian comic world, the early ones having been Richard Corben and Bernie Wrightson, the former of which having started out in the American underground comix scene, where artists created comics with the express intent to distance themselves from the classic American comics as produced by the big studios. Both men were published in the &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; American spin-off &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; and reciprocally translated for the French mother magazine. As mentioned, &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; made a deep artistic impact on an entire young generation of English-speaking comic creators, such as Neil Gaiman and Mike Mignola, who started to create more modern, more mature comics henceforth. It were these comics that were given attention by publisher Glénat, when they established the subsidiary Comics USA in 1988. Actually starting out with (hardcover!) comic book sized publications in the classic superhero genre, but created by a young generation of artists, the classic American comic failed to make a convincing come-back and the subsidiary folded in 1991 after 48 issues. Subsequently, Glénat focused solely on its concurrent Glénat Comics imprint which concentrated on album releases of modern American graphic novels from such publishers as Image Comics, Dark Horse, and Oni Press, and as such still in existence as of 2017. Glénat was actually preceded in 1986 by Delcourt, a newcomer presently specialized in American/British graphic novels (and Japanese manga). Of the post-classic superhero era, Mike Mignola has become one of the most in French translated American comic artists. Recently, Eaglemoss Collections and DC Comics have embarked on yet another attempt to re-introduce Francophone readership to the classic American superhero genre with their DC Comics: Le Meilleur des Super-Héros collection, launched in French in 2015, following in the wake of publisher Hachette who launched their Marvel Comics: La collection the year previously in an attempt to capitalize on the break-out success of the 21st-century Marvel Comics film adaptions.

=== Comics from Japan ===
Japanese manga started to receive more attention from the early to mid-1990s onward. Recently, more manga has been translated and published, with a particular emphasis on independent authors like Jiro Taniguchi. Manga now represents more than one fourth of comics sales in France. French comics that draw inspiration from Japanese manga are called &quot;manfra&quot; (or also &quot;franga&quot;, &quot;manga français&quot; or &quot;global manga&quot;). In addition, in an attempt to unify the Franco-Belgian and Japanese schools, cartoonist Frédéric Boilet started the movement &quot;La nouvelle manga&quot;. Illustrative of the market share the manga has conquered is that Dargaud has in 1996 spun off their manga French-language publications into a specialized publisher of it own, Kana, currently co-existing alongside the already established specialist Delcourt, and since 2000 joined by specialists Pika Édition, , Kazé and Ki-oon. In 2014, Delcourt acquired the earliest known such specialist Tonkam, which had already been established in 1993.

==Conventions and journalistic professionalism==
There are many comics conventions in Belgium and France. The most famous, prestigious and largest one is the &quot;Festival international de la bande dessinée d&#x27;Angoulême&quot; (English: &quot;Angoulême International Comics Festival&quot;), an annual festival begun in 1974, in Angoulême, France, and the format has been adopted in other European countries as well, unsurprisingly perhaps considering the popularity the Franco-Belgian comics enjoy in these countries, though they are typically of a more modest size, the Italian &quot;Lucca Comics &amp; Games&quot; festival (est. 1965) excepted – though, as the name already suggest, that festival extents beyond comics alone, whereas the Angoulême festival is comics specific. During his tenure as culture minister, Jack Lang was a frequent guest of honor of the festival as part of his endeavors to advance the cultural status of the &quot;bande dessinée&quot;, and personally awarded the festival&#x27;s awards to comic artists, which included Jean Giraud in 1985 when he received the festival&#x27;s most prestigious award, the year after Lang had announced the advent of the national comics museum on the previous edition of the festival.

Typical for conventions are the expositions of original art, the signing sessions with authors, sale of small press and fanzines, an awards ceremony, and other comics related activities. Also, some artists from other counties travel to Angoulême and other festivals to show their work and meet their fans and editors. The Angoulême festival draws in over 200,000 visitors annually, including between 6,000 and 7,000 professionals and 800 journalists. Contrary to their US Comic Con counterparts, where other pop-culture media manifestations are increasingly taking precedence, movie and television productions in particular, continental European comics conventions remain to this day largely and firmly grounded in its source medium, the printed comics. US-style comic conventions are becoming popular as well though, but are invariably organized separately from the traditional &quot;bande dessinée&quot; festivals under the English denomination, and where the print materials are concerned focused on the US comic book, and Japanese manga publications.

One of the oldest Franco-Belgian comics conventions was the &quot;Convention de la B.D. de Paris&quot; (1969–2003), which was co-founded by the aforementioned Claude Moliterni. Though Moliterni was a &quot;bande dessinée&quot; writer (usually for artist Robert Gigi), he became primarily renowned as a tireless champion for the medium, in the process becoming one of France&#x27;s first serious comics scholars by launching one of the first professional and serious comics journals worldwide, &quot;&quot; (1966–1977), and writing numerous articles, reference books and, later on, (co-)launching specialized websites as well, on the subject matter. In doing so Moliterni became the European counterpart of equally renowned American – but French-born – comics scholar Maurice Horn, a contemporary with whom Moliterni had actually cooperated in the early years of their careers. Aside from this, Moliterni also became a prolific founder of comics conventions. The first one he co-founded was actually the Lucca one, experience gained on that experience put to good use for the Parisian one. Moliterni went on to co-found seven more conventions and permanent exhibitions in France and Italy, including Angoulême for which he is most renowned. His efforts for the medium gained Moliterni no less than three French civilian knighthoods.

The trailblazing journalistic – and subsequent scholastic – approach pioneered by Moliterni, which greatly aided in the acceptance of the medium as a mature part of Francophone culture, served as an inspiration for his successors, such as , Thierry Groensteen, , Numa Sadoul, as well as the already mentioned Bocque, Gaumer and Ratier, who have followed in his footsteps. With Gaumer incidentally, Moliterni revisited his 1964-1967 &quot;Spirou&quot; article series he had co-edited with Morris, which resulted in the edited and greatly enhanced reference work &quot;Dictionnaire mondial de la bande dessinée&quot; (), published in 1994 by Éditions Larousse (a renowned French encyclopedia publisher), and a work very similar to Horn&#x27;s 1976 &quot;The World Encyclopedia of Comics&quot; () which in turn greatly resembled the older &quot;Spirou&quot; article series.

Likewise, his &quot;Phénix&quot; trade journal has seen a plethora of successors following suit all over western Europe as well. Actually, the second oldest known professional European comics trade journal was the Dutch &#x27;, launched in 1968 and coinciding with the definitive breakthrough of the &quot;bande dessinée&quot; in the Netherlands, before a second Francophone comics journal (&#x27;, launched in 1969 as &quot;Schtroumpf&quot; by and in effect the founding block of his namesake publishing house) had even entered the fray. During its first couple of years of publication, &quot;Stripschrift&quot; was in effect very reliant on &quot;Phénix&quot; for content, before it managed to shake off its French roots and stand on its own, and is, contrary to its French progenitor, still being published as of 2020 and thus the oldest known professional comics journal still in existence worldwide.

==Impact and popularity==
Franco-Belgian comics have been translated in most European languages, with some of them enjoying a worldwide success. Some magazines, aside from the Dutch-language editions, have been translated in Greek, Portuguese, Italian and Spanish, while in other cases foreign magazines were filled with the best of the Franco-Belgian comics. In France and Belgium, most magazines have since then disappeared or have a largely reduced circulation for socio-economic reasons (but mostly because modern readership no longer possesses the patience to read their comics in weekly or monthly installments, instead preferring to have a story presented to them wholesale in album format), but the number of published and sold albums stays relatively high – the majority of new titles being currently directly published as albums without prior magazine serialization – with the biggest successes still on the juvenile and adolescent markets. This state of affairs has been mirrored in the other European countries as well. As a format, the Franco-Belgian comic has been near-universally adopted by native comic artists all over Europe, especially in the neighboring countries of Belgium and France (and including Italy, despite that country having had a rich and thriving comics culture of its own and with the Netherlands as an early adopter being one of the first, if not the first, to do so), solidifying the position of the Franco-Belgian comic as the preeminent force on the European comics scene, Great Britain excepted.

The greatest and most enduring success however was mainly for some series started in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s (including &quot;Lucky Luke&quot;, &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, and &quot;Asterix&quot;), and the even older &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;, while many more recent series have not made a significant commercial impact outside mainland Europe and those overseas territories historically beholden to France, despite the critical acclaim for authors like Moebius. One out-of-the-ordinary overseas exception where Franco-Belgian comics are as of 2017 still doing well turned out to be the Indian subcontinent where translations in Tamil (spoken in the south-eastern part of India, Tamil Nadu, and on the island state of Sri Lanka) published by Prakash Publishers under their own &quot;Lion/Muthu Comics&quot; imprints, have proven to be very popular, though their appeal remain somewhat limited to the classic series for an adolescent readership as conceived in the 1960s–1980s, and that more recent, more mature series have yet to make an impression in those territories.

<text>The dukedom of Lancaster is a former English peerage, created three times in the Middle Ages, which finally merged in the Crown when Henry V succeeded to the throne in 1413. Despite the extinction of the dukedom the title has continued to be used to refer to the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom in relation to the County Palatine of Lancaster and the Duchy of Lancaster, an estate held separately from the Crown Estate for the benefit of the sovereign.

==History==

There were three creations of the dukedom of Lancaster during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The first creation was on 6 March 1351 for Henry of Grosmont, 4th Earl of Lancaster, a great-grandson of Henry III; he was also 4th Earl of Leicester, 1st Earl of Derby, 1st Earl of Lincoln and Lord of Bowland. When he died in 1361 the peerage became extinct.

The second creation was on 13 November 1362, for John of Gaunt, 1st Earl of Richmond and third surviving son of King Edward III. He became Henry of Grosmont&#x27;s son-in-law through his marriage to Blanche of Lancaster, Henry&#x27;s second daughter and eventual heir. When Gaunt died on 4 February 1399 the dukedom passed to his son, Henry of Bolingbroke, 1st duke of Hereford. Later that same year Bolingbroke usurped the throne of England from Richard II, becoming Henry IV, at which point the dukedom merged in the Crown.

Henry re-created the dukedom on 10 November 1399 for his eldest son Henry of Monmouth, Prince of Wales. In 1413 Monmouth ascended the throne as King Henry V and the dukedom merged in the crown again, where it has remained ever since.

Nevertheless, the title continues to be used to refer to the monarch in relation to Lancashire and the Duchy of Lancaster, the estate associated with the former dukedom. It was customary at formal dinners in the historic county boundaries of Lancashire and in Lancastrian regiments of the armed forces for the Loyal Toast to be announced as &quot;The King, Duke of Lancaster&quot;. Traditionally in Lancashire, the national anthem was sung as &quot;God save our gracious King, long live our noble Duke&quot;, as it is each Sunday morning in the Savoy Chapel in London, a church attached to the Duchy. However, the legal basis for the sovereign to use the title has been disputed as the right to inheritance of the title only arises upon each creation, which is different than the crown&#x27;s right to the duchy&#x27;s estate after the merger. In particular, George V was given legal advice that it was “extremely unlikely” that he was the duke of Lancaster.

<doc id="87394" wikidata="Q1141484" url="?curid=87394" title="Web (programming system)">
<text>Web is a computer programming system created by Donald E. Knuth as the first implementation of what he called &quot;literate programming&quot;: the idea that one could create software as works of literature, by embedding source code inside descriptive text, rather than the reverse (as is common practice in most programming languages), in an order that is convenient for exposition to human readers, rather than in the order demanded by the compiler.

Web consists of two secondary programs: TANGLE, which produces compilable Pascal code from the source texts, and WEAVE, which produces nicely-formatted, printable documentation using TeX.

CWEB is a version of Web for the C programming language, while noweb is a separate literate programming tool, which is inspired by Web (as reflected in the name) and which is language agnostic.

The most significant programs written in Web are TeX and Metafont. Modern TeX distributions use another program Web2C to convert Web source to C.

==Philosophy==
Unlike most other documentation generators, which relegate documentation to comments, the WEB approach is to write an article to document the making of the source code. Much like TeX articles, the source is divided into sections according to documentation flow. For example, in CWEB, code sections are seamlessly intermixed in the line of argumentation.

==CWEB==

CWEB is a computer programming system created by Donald Knuth and Silvio Levy as a follow-up to Knuth&#x27;s &quot;WEB&quot; literate programming system, using the C programming language (and to a lesser extent the C++ and Java programming languages) instead of Pascal.

Like WEB, it consists of two primary programs: 

* CTANGLE, which produces compilable C code from the source texts, and
* CWEAVE, which produces nicely-formatted printable documentation using TeX.

===Features===
* Can enter manual TeX code as well as automatic.
* Make formatting of C code for pretty printing.
* Can define sections, and can contain documentation and codes, which can then be included into other sections.
* Write the header code and main C code in one file, and can reuse the same sections, and then it can be tangled into multiple files for compiling.
* Use codice_1 directive so that any warnings or errors refer to the .w source.
* Include files.
* Change files, which can be automatically merged into the code when compiling/printing.
* Produces index of identifiers and section names in the printout.

<doc id="87405" wikidata="Q724128" url="?curid=87405" title="ChatZilla">
<text>ChatZilla is an IRC client that is part of SeaMonkey. It was previously an extension for Mozilla-based browsers such as Firefox, introduced in 2000. It is cross-platform open source software which has been noted for its consistent appearance across platforms, CSS appearance customization and scripting.

==Early history==
On April 20, 1999, it was reported that Mozilla, at the time the open-source arm of AOL&#x27;s Netscape Communications division, had announced the commencement of &quot;an instant messaging and chat project with the stated goal of supporting a wide variety of chat protocols, including &quot;the venerable Internet Relay Chat&quot;. Other companies were also developing chat systems. We recognize that there&#x27;s a lot of interest in the instant messaging space,&#x27; said AOL spokesperson Catherine Corre, referring to the Mozilla project. &#x27;This is a recognition of the interest in that area. At the time, the new chat client proposal was reported as being &quot;competition&quot; to AOL&#x27;s own AOL Instant Messenger chat client, and on April 21, 1999, the announcement was rescinded &quot;pending further review by Netscape.&quot; Independently, programmer Robert Ginda developed an IRC client and submitted it to the Mozilla project, which as of September 1999 planned to introduce it with the planned release of Mozilla browser.
Named &quot;ChatZilla&quot;, the client was available in development form in May 2000 for the Netscape 6.01 browser, and Mozilla 0.8.

==Features==
ChatZilla runs on any platform on which SeaMonkey can run, including OS X, Linux, and Microsoft Windows, and provides a &quot;consistent user interface across the board.&quot; It can also be used as a standalone app using XULRunner.

It contains most general features of IRC clients, including connecting to multiple servers at once, maintaining a built-in list of standard networks, searching and sorting of available channels, chat logging, Direct Client-to-Client (&quot;DCC&quot;) chat and file transfers, and user customization of the interface.
ChatZilla includes automatic completion of nicknames with the codice_1 key, and appends a comma if the nickname is the first word on a line. It also provides completion of codice_2 with the codice_1 key, and a &quot;quick double-codice_1&quot; presents a list of available commands based on what&#x27;s been typed so far.
The text entry window can be &quot;single line&quot;, in which the Enter key sends the composed text, or &quot;multiline&quot; in which allows composing larger text sections with line breaks, and the Ctrl-Enter key combo sends the text block.
JavaScript is used for running scripts and messages are styled with CSS, which
can be controlled by the user: by selecting from the View menu, dragging a link to a codice_5 file to the message window, or with the codice_6 command. DCC is supported which allows users to transfer files and chat directly between one another. The sender of each message is shown to the left of the text as a link—clicking the link opens a private chat window to that user.

ChatZilla is included with SeaMonkey and was available for download to other Mozilla-based browsers such as Firefox as an extension. It could also be run in a tab in Firefox.

==Plugins==
ChatZilla offers many plugins, which extend the functionality in the user-experience of the add-on.

Some of these plugins include:
* TinyURL – replaces long URLs (typically those with more than 80 characters) with TinyURL links
* googleapi – searches Google and displays the top result
* cZiRATE – shares the song the user is currently listening to on iRATE Radio

==WebExtension==
The introduction of Firefox Quantum (version 57) has dropped the support of legacy add-ons that utilized XUL and XPCOM, and so has stopped ChatZilla from working inside Firefox thereafeter. Work has begun to move the code to a WebExtension.

==Reception==
Reviews of ChatZilla have varied from enthusiastic, in the case of users familiar with IRC, to unimpressed, for reviewers more accustomed to other chat client user interfaces. A 2003 review in &quot;Computers for Doctors&quot; of Mozilla 1.0, referred to IRC client applications as &quot;not very user-friendly, and the same goes for ChatZilla. You won&#x27;t find any pop-up icons, or happy little noises telling you somebody wants to chat.&quot;
In 2004, Jennifer Golbeck, writing in &quot;IRC Hacks&quot;, pointed out its cross-platform consistency, and found it &quot;quick and easy to start using&quot;, and has &quot;great support for changing the appearance of chat windows with motifs...(CSS files).&quot;

In a 2008 overview of extensions for Firefox in &quot;Linux Journal&quot;, Dan Sawyer described ChatZilla as an &quot;oldie-but-goodie&quot;, &quot;venerable&quot;, &quot;with all the trimmings&quot;, &quot;handsomely organizes chat channels, logs, has an extensive built-in list of available channels, supports DCC chats and file transfers, and has its own plugin and theming architecture.&quot; The application &quot;implements all the standards very well, and for those who prefer to keep desktop clutter to a minimum but still enjoy fighting with random strangers on IRC, ChatZilla is a must-have.&quot;

<text>Internet Small Computer Systems Interface or iSCSI ( ) is an Internet Protocol-based storage networking standard for linking data storage facilities. iSCSI provides block-level access to storage devices by carrying SCSI commands over a TCP/IP network. iSCSI facilitates data transfers over intranets and to manage storage over long distances. It can be used to transmit data over local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), or the Internet and can enable location-independent data storage and retrieval.

The protocol allows clients (called &quot;initiators&quot;) to send SCSI commands (&quot;CDBs&quot;) to storage devices (&quot;targets&quot;) on remote servers. It is a storage area network (SAN) protocol, allowing organizations to consolidate storage into storage arrays while providing clients (such as database and web servers) with the illusion of locally attached SCSI disks. It mainly competes with Fibre Channel, but unlike traditional Fibre Channel which usually requires dedicated cabling, iSCSI can be run over long distances using existing network infrastructure. iSCSI was pioneered by IBM and Cisco in 1998 and submitted as a draft standard in March 2000.

==Concepts==
In essence, iSCSI allows two hosts to negotiate and then exchange SCSI commands using Internet Protocol (IP) networks. By doing this, iSCSI takes a popular high-performance local storage bus and emulates it over a wide range of networks, creating a storage area network (SAN). Unlike some SAN protocols, iSCSI requires no dedicated cabling; it can be run over existing IP infrastructure. As a result, iSCSI is often seen as a low-cost alternative to Fibre Channel, which requires dedicated infrastructure except in its FCoE (Fibre Channel over Ethernet) form. However, the performance of an iSCSI SAN deployment can be severely degraded if not operated on a dedicated network or subnet (LAN or VLAN), due to competition for a fixed amount of bandwidth.

Although iSCSI can communicate with arbitrary types of SCSI devices, system administrators almost always use it to allow servers (such as database servers) to access disk volumes on storage arrays. iSCSI SANs often have one of two objectives:

; Storage consolidation
: Organizations move disparate storage resources from servers around their network to central locations, often in data centers; this allows for more efficiency in the allocation of storage, as the storage itself is no longer tied to a particular server. In a SAN environment, a server can be allocated a new disk volume without any changes to hardware or cabling.

; Disaster recovery
: Organizations mirror storage resources from one data center to a remote data center, which can serve as a hot / standby in the event of a prolonged outage. In particular, iSCSI SANs allow entire disk arrays to be migrated across a WAN with minimal configuration changes, in effect making storage &quot;routable&quot; in the same manner as network traffic.

===Initiator===

An &quot;initiator&quot; functions as an iSCSI client. An initiator typically serves the same purpose to a computer as a SCSI bus adapter would, except that, instead of physically cabling SCSI devices (like hard drives and tape changers), an iSCSI initiator sends SCSI commands over an IP network. An initiator falls into two broad types:

A software initiator uses code to implement iSCSI. Typically, this happens in a kernel-resident device driver that uses the existing network card (NIC) and network stack to emulate SCSI devices for a computer by speaking the iSCSI protocol. Software initiators are available for most popular operating systems and are the most common method of deploying iSCSI.

A hardware initiator uses dedicated hardware, typically in combination with firmware running on that hardware, to implement iSCSI. A hardware initiator mitigates the overhead of iSCSI and TCP processing and Ethernet interrupts, and therefore may improve the performance of servers that use iSCSI.
An iSCSI host bus adapter (more commonly, HBA) implements a hardware initiator. A typical HBA is packaged as a combination of a Gigabit (or 10 Gigabit) Ethernet network interface controller, some kind of TCP/IP offload engine (TOE) technology and a SCSI bus adapter, which is how it appears to the operating system.
An iSCSI HBA can include PCI option ROM to allow booting from an iSCSI SAN.

An &quot;iSCSI offload engine&quot;, or &quot;iSOE card&quot;, offers an alternative to a full iSCSI HBA. An iSOE &quot;offloads&quot; the iSCSI initiator operations for this particular network interface from the host processor, freeing up CPU cycles for the main host applications. iSCSI HBAs or iSOEs are used when the additional performance enhancement justifies the additional expense of using an HBA for iSCSI, rather than using a software-based iSCSI client (initiator). iSOE may be implemented with additional services such as TCP offload engine (TOE) to further reduce host server CPU usage.

===Target===

The iSCSI specification refers to a storage resource located on an iSCSI server (more generally, one of potentially many &quot;instances&quot; of iSCSI storage nodes running on that server) as a &quot;target&quot;.

An iSCSI target is often a dedicated network-connected hard disk storage device, but may also be a general-purpose computer, since as with initiators, software to provide an iSCSI target is available for most mainstream operating systems.

Common deployment scenarios for an iSCSI target include:

====Storage array====
In a data center or enterprise environment, an iSCSI target often resides in a large storage array. These arrays can be in the form of commodity hardware with free-software-based iSCSI implementations, or as commercial products such as in StorTrends, Pure Storage, HP StorageWorks, EqualLogic, Tegile Systems, Nimble storage, IBM Storwize family, Isilon, NetApp filer, Dell EMC, Kaminario, NS-series, CX4, VNX, VNXe, VMAX, Hitachi Data Systems HNAS, or Pivot3 vSTAC.

A storage array usually provides distinct iSCSI targets for numerous clients.

====Software target====
Nearly all modern mainstream server operating systems (such as BSD, Linux, Solaris or Windows Server) can provide iSCSI target functionality, either as a built-in feature or with supplemental software. Some specific-purpose operating systems implement iSCSI target support.

====Logical unit number====

In SCSI terminology, LU stands for &quot;logical unit&quot;, which is specified by a unique &quot;logical unit number&quot;. A LUN represents an individually addressable (logical) SCSI device that is part of a physical SCSI device (target). In an iSCSI environment, LUNs are essentially numbered disk drives. An initiator negotiates with a target to establish connectivity to a LUN; the result is an iSCSI connection that emulates a connection to a SCSI hard disk. Initiators treat iSCSI LUNs the same way as they would a raw SCSI or IDE hard drive; for instance, rather than mounting remote directories as would be done in NFS or CIFS environments, iSCSI systems format and directly manage filesystems on iSCSI LUNs.

In enterprise deployments, LUNs usually represent subsets of large RAID disk arrays, often allocated one per client. iSCSI imposes no rules or restrictions on multiple computers sharing individual LUNs; it leaves shared access to a single underlying filesystem as a task for the operating system.

===Network booting===
For general data storage on an already-booted computer, any type of generic network interface may be used to access iSCSI devices. However, a generic consumer-grade network interface is not able to boot a diskless computer from a remote iSCSI data source. Instead, it is commonplace for a server to load its initial operating system from a TFTP server or local boot device, and then use iSCSI for data storage once booting from the local device has finished.

A separate DHCP server may be configured to assist interfaces equipped with network boot capability to be able to boot over iSCSI. In this case, the network interface looks for a DHCP server offering a PXE or bootp boot image. This is used to kick off the iSCSI remote boot process, using the booting network interface&#x27;s MAC address to direct the computer to the correct iSCSI boot target. One can then use a software-only approach to load a small boot program which can in turn mount a remote iSCSI target as if it was a local SCSI drive and then fire the boot process from said iSCSI target. This can be achieved using an existing Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) boot ROM, which is available on many wired Ethernet adapters. The boot code can also be loaded from CD/DVD, floppy disk (or floppy disk image) and USB storage, or it can replace existing PXE boot code on adapters that can be re-flashed. The most popular free software to offer iSCSI boot support is iPXE.

Most Intel Ethernet controllers for servers support iSCSI boot.

===Addressing===
iSCSI uses TCP (typically TCP ports 860 and 3260) for the protocols itself, with higher-level names used to address the objects within the protocol.
Special names refer to both iSCSI initiators and targets. iSCSI provides three name-formats:

; iSCSI Qualified Name (IQN)
: Format: The iSCSI Qualified Name is documented in RFC 3720, with further examples of names in RFC 3721. Briefly, the fields are:

:* literal iqn (iSCSI Qualified Name)
:* date (yyyy-mm) that the naming authority took ownership of the domain
:* reversed domain name of the authority (e.g. org.alpinelinux, com.example, to.yp.cr)
:* Optional &quot;:&quot; prefixing a storage target name specified by the naming authority.

:From the RFC:
; Extended Unique Identifier (EUI)
: Format: eui.{EUI-64 bit address} (e.g. codice_1)
; T11 Network Address Authority (NAA)
: Format: naa.{NAA 64 or 128 bit identifier} (e.g. codice_2)

IQN format addresses occur most commonly. They are qualified by a date (yyyy-mm) because domain names can expire or be acquired by another entity.

The IEEE Registration authority provides EUI in accordance with the EUI-64 standard. NAA is part OUI which is provided by the IEEE Registration Authority. NAA name formats were added to iSCSI in RFC 3980, to provide compatibility with naming conventions used in Fibre Channel and Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) storage technologies.

Usually, an iSCSI participant can be defined by three or four fields: 
# Hostname or IP Address (e.g., &quot;iscsi.example.com&quot;)
# Port Number (e.g., 3260)
# iSCSI Name (e.g., the IQN &quot;iqn.2003-01.com.ibm:00.fcd0ab21.shark128&quot;)
# An optional CHAP Secret (e.g., &quot;secretsarefun&quot;)

===iSNS===

iSCSI initiators can locate appropriate storage resources using the Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) protocol. In theory, iSNS provides iSCSI SANs with the same management model as dedicated Fibre Channel SANs. In practice, administrators can satisfy many deployment goals for iSCSI without using iSNS.

==Security==
===Authentication===
iSCSI initiators and targets prove their identity to each other using CHAP, which includes a mechanism to prevent cleartext passwords from appearing on the wire. By itself, CHAP is vulnerable to dictionary attacks, spoofing, and reflection attacks. If followed carefully, the best practices for using CHAP within iSCSI reduce the surface for these attacks and mitigate the risks.

Additionally, as with all IP-based protocols, IPsec can operate at the network layer. The iSCSI negotiation protocol is designed to accommodate other authentication schemes, though interoperability issues limit their deployment.

===Logical network isolation===
To ensure that only valid initiators connect to storage arrays, administrators most commonly run iSCSI only over logically isolated backchannel networks. In this deployment architecture, only the management ports of storage arrays are exposed to the general-purpose internal network, and the iSCSI protocol itself is run over dedicated network segments or VLANs. This mitigates authentication concerns; unauthorized users are not physically provisioned for iSCSI, and thus cannot talk to storage arrays. However, it also creates a transitive trust problem, in that a single compromised host with an iSCSI disk can be used to attack storage resources for other hosts.

===Physical network isolation===

While iSCSI can be logically isolated from the general network using VLANs only, it is still no different from any other network equipment and may use any cable or port as long as there is a completed signal path between source and target. Just a single cabling mistake by a network technician can compromise the barrier of logical separation, and an accidental bridging may not be immediately detected because it does not cause network errors.

In order to further differentiate iSCSI from the regular network and prevent cabling mistakes when changing connections, administrators may implement self-defined color-coding and labeling standards, such as only using yellow-colored cables for the iSCSI connections and only blue cables for the regular network, and clearly labeling ports and switches used only for iSCSI.

While iSCSI could be implemented as just a VLAN cluster of ports on a large multi-port switch that is also used for general network usage, the administrator may instead choose to use physically separate switches dedicated to iSCSI VLANs only, to further prevent the possibility of an incorrectly connected cable plugged into the wrong port bridging the logical barrier.

===Authorization===

Because iSCSI aims to consolidate storage for many servers into a single storage array, iSCSI deployments require strategies to prevent unrelated initiators from accessing storage resources. As a pathological example, a single enterprise storage array could hold data for servers variously regulated by the Sarbanes–Oxley Act for corporate accounting, HIPAA for health benefits information, and PCI DSS for credit card processing. During an audit, storage systems must demonstrate controls to ensure that a server under one regime cannot access the storage assets of a server under another.

Typically, iSCSI storage arrays explicitly map initiators to specific target LUNs; an initiator authenticates not to the storage array, but to the specific storage asset it intends to use. However, because the target LUNs for SCSI commands are expressed both in the iSCSI negotiation protocol and in the underlying SCSI protocol, care must be taken to ensure that access control is provided consistently.

===Confidentiality and integrity===
For the most part, iSCSI operates as a cleartext protocol that provides no cryptographic protection for data in motion during SCSI transactions. As a result, an attacker who can listen in on iSCSI Ethernet traffic can:
* Reconstruct and copy the files and filesystems being transferred on the wire
* Alter the contents of files by injecting fake iSCSI frames
* Corrupt filesystems being accessed by initiators, exposing servers to software flaws in poorly tested filesystem code.

These problems do not occur only with iSCSI, but rather apply to any SAN protocol without cryptographic security. IP-based security protocols, such as IPsec, can provide standards-based cryptographic protection to this traffic.

==Implementations==
===Operating systems===
The dates in the following table denote the first appearance of a native driver in each operating system. Third-party drivers for Windows and Linux were available as early as 2001, specifically for attaching IBM&#x27;s IP Storage 200i appliance.

===Targets===
Most iSCSI targets involve disk, though iSCSI tape and medium-changer targets are popular as well. So far, physical devices have not featured native iSCSI interfaces on a component level. Instead, devices with Parallel SCSI or Fibre Channel interfaces are bridged by using iSCSI target software, external bridges, or controllers internal to the device enclosure.

Alternatively, it is possible to virtualize disk and tape targets. Rather than representing an actual physical device, an emulated virtual device is presented. The underlying implementation can deviate drastically from the presented target as is done with virtual tape library (VTL) products. VTLs use disk storage for storing data written to virtual tapes. As with actual physical devices, virtual targets are presented by using iSCSI target software, external bridges, or controllers internal to the device enclosure.

In the security products industry, some manufacturers use an iSCSI RAID as a target, with the initiator being either an IP-enabled encoder or camera.

===Converters and bridges===
Multiple systems exist that allow Fibre Channel, SCSI and SAS devices to be attached to an IP network for use via iSCSI. They can be used to allow migration from older storage technologies, access to SANs from remote servers and the linking of SANs over IP networks. An iSCSI gateway bridges IP servers to Fibre Channel SANs. The TCP connection is terminated at the gateway, which is implemented on a Fibre Channel switch or as a standalone appliance.
