<text>Traditional Chinese astronomy has a system of dividing the celestial sphere into asterisms or constellations, known as &quot;officials&quot; (Chinese &quot;xīng guān&quot;).

The Chinese asterisms are generally smaller than the constellations of Hellenistic tradition. 
The Song dynasty (13th-century) Suzhou planisphere shows a total of 283 asterisms, comprising a total of 1,565 individual stars.
The asterisms are divided into four groups, the Twenty-Eight Mansions (, &quot;Èrshíbā Xiù&quot;) along the ecliptic, and the Three Enclosures of the northern sky. 
The southern sky was added as a fifth group in the late Ming dynasty based on European star charts, comprising an additional 23 asterisms.

The Three Enclosures (, &quot;Sān Yuán&quot;) include the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, which is centered on the north celestial pole and includes those stars which could be seen year-round, while the other two straddle the celestial equator.

The Twenty-Eight Mansions form an ecliptic coordinate system used for those stars visible (from China) but not during the whole year, based on the movement of the Moon over a lunar month.

== History ==
The Chinese system developed independently from the Greco-Roman system since at least the 5th century BC, although there may have been earlier mutual influence, suggested by parallels to ancient Babylonian astronomy.

The system of twenty-eight lunar mansions is very similar (although not identical) to the Indian &quot;Nakshatra&quot; system, and it is not currently known if there was mutual influence in the history of the Chinese and Indian systems.

The oldest extant Chinese star maps date to the Tang dynasty. Notable among them are the 8th-century &quot;Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era&quot; and Dunhuang Star Chart.
It contains collections of earlier Chinese astronomers (Shi Shen, Gan De and Wu Xian) as well as of Indian astronomy (which had reached China in the early centuries AD).
Gan De was a Warring States era (5th century BC) astronomer who according to the testimony of the Dunhuang Star Chart
enumerated 810 stars in 138 asterisms. The Dunhuang Star Chart itself has 1,585 stars grouped into 257 asterisms.

The number of asterisms, or of stars grouped into asterisms, never became fixed, but remained in the same order of magnitude (for the purpose of comparison, the star catalogue compiled by Ptolemy in the 2nd century had 1,022 stars in 48 constellations).
The 13th-century Suzhou star chart has 1,565 stars in 283 asterisms, the 14th-century Korean Cheonsang Yeolcha Bunyajido has 1,467 stars in 264 asterisms, and the celestial globe made by Flemish Jesuit Ferdinand Verbiest for the Kangxi Emperor in 1673 has 1,876 stars in 282 asterisms.

The southern sky was unknown to the ancient Chinese and is consequently not included in the traditional system. With European contact in the 16th century, Xu Guangqi, an astronomer of the late Ming dynasty, introduced another 23 asterisms based on European star charts. The &quot;Southern Asterisms&quot; () are now also treated as part of the traditional Chinese system.

==Terminology==
The Chinese word for &quot;star, heavenly body&quot; is .
The character originally had a more complicated form: , a phono-semantic character () whose semantic portion, , originally depicting three twinkling stars (three instances of the &quot;sun&quot; radical ).

The modern Chinese term for &quot;constellation&quot;, referring to those as defined by the IAU system, is (). The older term () is used only in describing constellations of the traditional system. The character &#x27;s main meaning is &quot;public official&quot; (hence the English translation &quot;officials&quot; for the Chinese asterisms), it historically could also meant &quot;official&#x27;s residence&quot;.

The generic term for &quot;asterism&quot; is (, lit. &quot;group of stars&quot;).

==Three Enclosures==
The Three Enclosures are the Purple Forbidden enclosure (, &quot;Zǐ Wēi Yuán&quot;), the Supreme Palace enclosure (, &quot;Tài Wēi Yuán&quot;) and the Heavenly Market enclosure (, &quot;Tiān Shì Yuán&quot;).

The Purple Forbidden Enclosure occupies the northernmost area of the night sky. From the viewpoint of the ancient Chinese, the Purple Forbidden Enclosure lies in the middle of the sky and is circled by all the other stars.
It covers the Greek constellations Ursa Minor, Draco, Camelopardalis, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Auriga, Boötes, 
and parts of Ursa Major, Canes Venatici, Leo Minor and Hercules.

The Supreme Palace Enclosure covers the Greek constellations Virgo, Coma Berenices and Leo, 
and parts of Canes Venatici, Ursa Major and Leo Minor.

The Heavenly Market Enclosure covers the Greek constellations Serpens, Ophiuchus, Aquila and Corona Borealis, 
and parts of Hercules.

The Three Enclosures are each enclosed by two &quot;wall&quot; asterisms, designated &quot;yuán&quot; &quot;low wall, fence; enclosure&quot; (not to be confused with the lunar mansion &quot;&quot;Wall&quot; ):

*Purple Forbidden Left Wall (Cassiopeia / Cepheus / Draco)
*Purple Forbidden Right Wall (Draco / Ursa Major / Camelopardalis)
*Supreme Palace Left Wall (Virgo / Coma Berenices)
*Supreme Palace Right Wall (Leo / Virgo)
*Heavenly Market Left Wall (Hercules / Serpens / Ophiuchus / Aquila)
*Heavenly Market Right Wall (Serpens / Ophiuchus / Hercules)

==The Twenty-Eight Mansions==

The Twenty-Eight Mansions are grouped into Four Symbols, each associated with a compass direction and containing seven mansions. The names and determinative stars are:
==The Southern Asterisms==

The sky around the south celestial pole was unknown to ancient Chinese. Therefore, it was not included in the Three Enclosures and Twenty-Eight Mansions system. However, by the end of the Ming dynasty, Xu Guangqi introduced another 23 asterisms based on the knowledge of European star charts. These asterisms were since incorporated into the traditional Chinese star maps.

The asterisms are:


==Chinese star names==

Ancient Chinese astronomers designated names to the visible stars systematically, roughly more than one thousand years before Johann Bayer did it in a similar way. Basically, every star is assigned to an asterism. Then a number is given to the individual stars in this asterism. Therefore, a star is designated as &quot;Asterism name&quot; + &quot;Number&quot;. The numbering of the stars in an asterism, however, is not based on the apparent magnitude of this star, but rather its position in the asterism. The Bayer system uses this Chinese method occasionally, most notably with the stars in the Big Dipper, which are all about the same magnitude; in turn, the stars of the Big Dipper, in Chinese, are numbered in Chinese astronomy in the same order as with the Bayer designations, with Dubhe first in both cases.

For example, Altair is named in Chinese. is the name of the asterism (literally the Drum at the River). is the number designation (two). Therefore, it literally means &quot;the Second Star of the Drum at the River&quot;. (Bayer might have called Altair &quot;Beta Tympani Flumine&quot; if he had been cataloguing Chinese constellations.)

Some stars also have traditional names, often related to mythology or astrology. For example, Altair is more commonly known as or (the Star of the Cowherd) in Chinese, after the mythological story of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl.

These designations are still used in modern Chinese astronomy. All stars for which the traditional names are used in English are routinely translated by their traditional Chinese designations, rather than translations of their catalogue names.

<text>Interstate 82 (I-82) is an Interstate Highway in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States that travels through parts of Washington and Oregon. It runs from its northwestern terminus at I-90 in Ellensburg, Washington, to its southeastern terminus at I-84 in Hermiston, Oregon. The highway passes through Yakima and the Tri-Cities, and is also part of the link between Seattle and Salt Lake City, Utah. I-82 travels concurrently with U.S. Route 97 (US 97) between Ellensburg and Union Gap; US 12 from Yakima to the Tri-Cities; and US 395 from Kennewick to Umatilla, Oregon.

I-82 primarily serves the Yakima Valley agricultural region, following the Yakima and Columbia rivers southeastward to the Tri-Cities. The highway enters the valley from the north by crossing the Manastash Ridge, which separates Yakima from the Kittitas Valley. I-82 bypasses the Tri-Cities by traveling southwest around Richland and Kennewick and then turns south to cross the Columbia River on the Umatilla Bridge. Its only auxiliary route, I-182, connects the highway to Richland and Pasco in the Tri-Cities.

The I-82 corridor was originally used by several state and national highways, including the Inland Empire Highway and US 410, which were built in the early 20th century. The federal government created I-82 in late 1957 to serve military facilities in the region, replacing an earlier designation for what is now I-84. The first section of I-82 to be constructed was the easterly bypass of Yakima, which opened in 1963 and was gradually extended north to Ellensburg by 1971. The Yakima Valley section, connecting Union Gap to Prosser, was constructed between 1977 and 1982.

The routing of the highway between Prosser and I-84 was very controversial among Tri-Cities residents, who lobbied for a longer I-82 alignment to serve them. Oregon legislators and highway officials remained opposed to a routing that bypassed Umatilla, leading to several attempts at finding a compromise along the Wallula Gap or in other areas southeast of the Tri-Cities. In 1973, Oregon and Washington adopted a federal compromise to build I-82 through Umatilla and around the outskirts of the Tri-Cities with a spur route (I-182) to serve the area directly. The Tri-Cities section opened in 1986 while in Oregon, the final section of I-82 was completed in 1988. In the early 2000s, Oregon highway officials examined plans to extend I-82 farther south through eastern Oregon and towards California, but they were not considered for further study.

==Route description==

I-82 travels through a part of the Inland Northwest in a generally northwest–southeast direction along the Yakima and Columbia rivers. The four-lane divided highway forms part of the link between Seattle and the inland West, which includes Boise, Idaho and Salt Lake City, Utah. I-82 is a component of the Interstate Highway System and is also designated as an important national highway under the National Highway System. It is also listed as a Highway of Statewide Significance by the Washington state government. I-82 has one auxiliary route, I-182, a spur route that serves the Tri-Cities region. It also has two child state highways in Washington: State Route 821 (SR 821) that runs from Selah to Ellensburg, and SR 823 that runs from Yakima to Selah.

I-82 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) within their respective states. Both agencies conduct annual surveys of traffic on segments of the freeway, the results of which are expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. The most heavily trafficked and the least trafficked sections of I-82 are located in Washington; the busiest section is in downtown Yakima near SR 24, which carried a daily average of 52,000 vehicles in 2016, and the least-trafficked section is the terminus at I-90 near Ellensburg, which carried 9,100 vehicles. In 2016, ODOT&#x27;s measurements of average daily traffic ranged from a minimum of 13,700 vehicles at Powerline Road near Hermiston to a maximum of 21,700 vehicles at the Umatilla Bridge.

===Yakima Valley===

I-82 begins southeast of Ellensburg, Washington, at a trumpet interchange with I-90, the state&#x27;s major east–west freeway. I-82 travels southward in a concurrency with US 97, which continues northwest along I-90 around Ellensburg and intersects with SR 821 at Thrall on the southern edge of the Kittitas Valley. The freeway climbs the Manastash Ridge, traveling southeastward around Yakima River Canyon, where SR 821 runs as a meandering scenic byway. Here, I-82 also forms the western edge of the Yakima Firing Range, a military training and exercise facility that stretches across the plateau to the Columbia River Gorge. The freeway reaches its highest point at Vanderbilt Gap, which is above sea level and only lower than Snoqualmie Pass on I-90. From the gap, the highway crosses into Yakima County and turns southwestward as it begins its descent from the ridge.

Just north of Selah, I-82 crosses the Fred G. Redmon Bridge, a , twinned arch bridge that spans Selah Creek. At the time of its opening in 1971, the Redmon Bridge was the longest concrete-arch bridge in North America at , losing its record in 1993 to new bridges in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Franklin, Tennessee. Southwest of the bridge, the freeway passes several farms and industrial buildings before reaching an interchange with the southern end of SR 821. I-82 continues on the eastern bank of the Yakima River to the east of Selah and intersects SR 823 in Selah Gap, a narrow canyon between two arms of the Yakima Ridge. The freeway, which runs parallel to a section of SR 823 in its median, crosses the Yakima and Naches rivers at their confluence and enters Yakima.

On the southern side of the confluence, I-82 and US 97 intersect US 12, a major cross-state highway that uses White Pass to travel over the Cascade Mountains, and begins a concurrency with it. The three highways travel southward along the Yakima River, veering east of downtown Yakima and its inner neighborhoods. The freeway passes through several urban interchanges, including the western terminus of SR 24 at Nob Hill Boulevard and a hybrid dogbone–partial cloverleaf interchange at the Valley Mall. I-82 continues southward through Union Gap and splits from US 97 at the eponymous canyon, where it crosses the Yakima River with US 12.

I-82 and US 12 travel southeastward in the shadow of the Rattlesnake Hills and along the north side of the Yakima River, opposite from US 97 and the BNSF Railway&#x27;s Yakima Valley Subdivision on the Yakama Indian Reservation. The freeway follows the Central Washington Railroad and intersects several roads connecting to cities on the southern side of the river, including Wapato and Toppenish, the latter of which is connected via an interchange with SR 22 near Buena. This section of the highway also passes through the Yakima Valley agricultural region, which includes Rattlesnake Hills AVA and Yakima Valley AVA—major areas for wine and hops production, along with other crops. I-82 travels along the southern edge of Zillah and passes the historic Teapot Dome Service Station, a gas station and piece of political and novelty architecture that became a roadside attraction. Past Zillah, the freeway intersects SR 223 in Granger and SR 241 southeast of Sunnyside, bypassing both towns. I-82 continues southeastward through Grandview and toward Prosser at the edge of the Tri-Cities metropolitan area in Benton County.

===Tri-Cities and Umatilla===
I-82 and US 12 pass several wineries and tasting rooms in northern Prosser before crossing the Yakima River east of the city center. The freeway continues northeastward on the southern side of the Yakima River, running along the bottom of the Horse Heaven Hills. Near Chandler Butte, the highway turns southeastward and intersects SR 224 and SR 225 on the southern side of Benton City. I-82 continues eastward to an interchange with I-182, its sole auxiliary route, at Goose Gap near West Richland; from here, I-182 travels concurrently with US 12 into Richland and Pasco, while I-82 bypasses the Tri-Cities to the southwest, staying south of Badger Mountain. I-82 continues southeastward along the edge of the Horse Heaven Hills to an interchange with US 395 south of Kennewick, where it forms another concurrency. The Kennewick–Plymouth section of the freeway is also signed as part of the Lewis and Clark Trail, a Washington state scenic byway.

I-82 and US 395 travel southward and ascend the Horse Heaven Hills to an intersection with SR 397, a highway that provides an alternate truck route for Kennewick and Finley. The freeway continues southwestward along Bofer and Fourmile canyons, descending from the hills and passing irrigated farmland while approaching the Columbia River. Northeast of Plymouth, it intersects the eastern terminus of SR 14, a cross-state highway that follows the Columbia River westward to Vancouver, and crosses the BNSF Fallbridge Subdivision, which carries Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Empire Builder&quot; passenger trains. I-82 and US 395 cross the Columbia River west of McNary Dam on Umatilla Bridge, which consists of a unique, multiple cantilever, steel truss bridge carrying the eastbound lanes, a newer concrete segmental bridge that carries the westbound lanes, and a multi-use trail for bicyclists and pedestrians.
After crossing into Oregon, the freeway enters Umatilla and intersects US 730, which becomes briefly concurrent with US 395 after it splits from I-82. I-82, designated as the unsigned McNary Highway No. 70 under Oregon&#x27;s named highway system, continues southwestward across the Umatilla River around central Hermiston. The freeway runs along the edge of the Umatilla Chemical Depot and terminates at an interchange with I-84, which is concurrent with US 30, southwest of Hermiston; I-84 and US 30 continue westward along the Columbia River toward Portland and eastward to Pendleton and Boise, Idaho.

==History==

===Predecessor highways===
Several sections of I-82 follow railroads and wagon roads that were built in the late 19th century to connect towns in Washington Territory, generally following early Indian trails. In the 1880s, the Northern Pacific Railway constructed a railroad along the Yakima River between Ellensburg and Pasco as part of its transcontinental route to Tacoma via Stampede Pass. The section through Yakima River Canyon between Ellensburg and North Yakima (now Yakima) bypassed an early toll road constructed by settler Jacob Durr that traveled farther west via Wenas Valley and Shushuskin Canyon.

In 1909, the Washington state government appropriated funds to survey routes through the Yakima Valley as part of a potential extension of the state road system. In 1913, at the suggestion of good roads advocates, the Washington State Legislature established the Inland Empire Highway as one of the trunk routes of its state highway system and appropriated $301,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars) to construct it to modern standards. The highway incorporated several existing and planned county roads from Ellensburg to Pasco; it then continued eastward to Walla Walla and northward to Spokane and the Canadian border near Kettle Falls. The Durr toll road was bypassed by a new highway through the Yakima River Canyon that opened on September 12, 1924, and was fully paved in 1932.

The Inland Empire Highway was also incorporated into the Yellowstone Trail, a national auto trail, and the federal numbered highway system created in 1926. Under the federal system, the Ellensburg–Yakima section formed part of US 97, a north–south route through central Washington and Oregon, and the Yakima–Walla Walla portion became part of US 410, which connected Aberdeen to Lewiston, Idaho. In 1923, the Washington state government renumbered the Inland Empire Highway as State Road 3, which would carry over as Primary State Highway 3 (PSH 3) in 1937. The federal highway system was expanded in the 1930s with an extension of US 395 along US 730 from the Tri-Cities towards Pendleton, Oregon and continuing southward. A branch highway between PSH 3 and the Columbia River near Plymouth—across from Umatilla, Oregon—was added to the state highway system in 1943 as an extension of PSH 8—the North Bank Highway; it was renumbered to SR 12 in 1964 and later SR 14 in 1967. The Plymouth extension connected to the Umatilla Bridge, a toll bridge that was built downstream from the McNary Dam in 1955. US 410 itself was replaced by a western extension of US 12 that was approved in June 1967.

===Planning and early disputes===

The Ellensburg–Pendleton corridor was authorized in 1956 but was not formally added to the Interstate system until October 17, 1957. The corridor was proposed by the Department of Defense and Washington senator Warren Magnuson in part to connect military facilities in the Puget Sound region to the Hanford Site and the Umatilla Chemical Depot. Its inclusion was initially opposed by Oregon, fearing the loss of truck traffic bound for the Intermountain West through Portland. Under the initial plan approved by the Washington state government in January 1958, the highway would travel through the Yakima Valley and cross the Columbia River at Boardman, Oregon, bypassing the Tri-Cities region entirely. It was numbered &quot;Interstate 82&quot; in 1958, re-using an older designation for what would become Interstate 80N (now I-84). In 1959, the Washington State Highway Commission requested that the interstate would follow US 410 across Naches Pass to Tacoma and Aberdeen, but the proposal was quietly abandoned.

The routing of the freeway&#x27;s northwestern half was subject to disputes, namely the bypassing of the Yakima River Canyon that was favored by truckers due to its gentler grades. In 1965, state highway commissioners chose the eastern route through the Yakima Firing Center, primarily because of its cost and room to support four lanes. A land transfer for from the U.S. Army was approved by Congress in November 1967 to allow for freeway construction near the firing center. A section of the Yakima River Freeway was also planned to pass through part of the Yakama Indian Reservation but the Yakama Nation refused to allow the condemnation of belonging to its members and filed suit against the state government in 1969. The U.S. District Court and U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals both ruled in favor of the Yakamas, forcing I-82 to be rerouted across the river on non-reservation land.

I-82&#x27;s chosen route between Union Gap and Granger would pass through of the Yakima River&#x27;s flood plain, attracting criticism from the federal Environmental Protection Agency for its potential effects on the area. The Yakima County government also disliked the routing, arguing that it would destroy hundreds of acres of prime agricultural land. A later attempt by environmentalists to move the freeway farther away from the river, including a potential route along the Rattlesnake Ridge, was rejected by the state shorelines hearings board in 1978 due to its extra distance and potential effects on a rare butterfly bog.

===Tri-Cities routing dispute===
The routing of I-82&#x27;s southern half was altered several times during the planning process, which lasted until the early 1970s. Due to complications with the construction of a crossing at Blalock Island that was favored by the Port of Morrow, Oregon leaders lobbied for the interstate to cross farther east at the existing Umatilla Bridge. The Prosser–Umatilla route remained the favored alignment for both states in the early part of the process of identifying alternatives, despite growing opposition from business leaders in the Tri-Cities and Walla Walla who sought an interstate connection.

In 1962, the Washington highway commissioner ordered a new routing study for the I-82 corridor after hearing requests from legislators in the Tri-Cities area. The study produced four general corridors, including alternatives that shifted I-82 closer to the Tri-Cities, traversed the area, and continued southeastward along Lake Wallula. The states remained committed to the Umatilla crossing and formally approved the Horse Heaven routing after a two-day public hearing in October 1963. The Tri-Cities and Wallula routes were rejected, in part because of the limited supply of miles allotted by Congress to the Interstate program. Senator Magnuson and Oregon congressman Al Ullman intervened during the federal approval of the routing and called for a re-study. Magnuson later proposed a bill to add to the Interstate system, including an allotment for the Tri-Cities, but it failed to advance beyond Congressional committees for several years before quietly excluding I-82. In 1968, the federal government authorized $25 million in funding (equivalent to $ in dollars) for the addition.

The new study was funded jointly by the two states and contracted to an independent firm that completed it in September 1966. The study recommended that I-82 be routed through Pasco and follow Lake Wallula to a junction with I-80N near Pendleton, fulfilling the general goals of the project despite adding to the highway and costing another $36 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) to construct. Oregon legislators, particularly those representing the Umatilla area, remained opposed to the routing and accused Washington of trying to &quot;pick-pocket&quot; traffic bound for Oregon. The Washington State Highway Commission gave preliminary approval to the Wallula route in December 1967, with support from the regional director of the Bureau of Public Roads, but their Oregon counterpart remained opposed. Oregon governor Tom McCall met with Senator Magnuson to propose a compromise route that would serve the Tri-Cities and the Port of Umatilla, which would later form the basis of a new study begun in mid-1968.

In May 1969, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the successor to the Bureau of Public Roads, announced a new compromise proposal, routing I-82 through Umatilla and adding a spur route I-182 to serve the Tri-Cities. The Washington State Highway Commission approved the compromise in July 1969, but the Oregon delegation expressed its support of the Wallula routing after it was modified to terminate farther west near Stanfield. The FHWA approved the Wallula alignment in October 1971, but protests from environmentalists over potential harm to local wildlife areas, including the McNary National Wildlife Refuge, forced the plan to be reconsidered in early 1973.

The Oregon commission remained opposed to all options that bypassed the Umatilla Bridge, mirroring public opinion from hearings in Pendleton, while the Washington commission considered a narrowed set of options around Umatilla that were both opposed by the Tri-Cities and Walla Walla. Support for the Wallula routing from the Tri-Cities waned in late 1973, allowing for a revival of the I-182 compromise proposed by the FHWA. The Washington commission approved a compromise route along the Horse Heaven Hills connecting Kennewick to the Umatilla Bridge, along with the I-182 spur to the Tri-Cities, in October 1973 and the Oregon commission approved it that December. The Washington state government also created a new state highway, SR 143, that connected the Umatilla Bridge to Plymouth. The FHWA approved the routing decision but as late as 1978, attempts were made to propose new alignments for the freeway in Oregon.

===Construction and opening===

The first section of I-82 to open was the eastern bypass of Yakima, which was planned as an upgrade to PSH 3 in the 1950s and completed in November 1963. The bypass freeway was later extended southward to Union Gap in August 1965 and northward to Selah in August 1967. The section between Ellensburg and Yakima was funded earlier than scheduled, money being diverted from stalled freeway projects in the Seattle area, and construction began in October 1968. The $35 million freeway project (equivalent to $ in dollars) required the excavation of approximately 20 million cubic yards () of dirt and facilitated the discovery of a new geologic fault that would be monitored for seismic movement. WSDOT contractors built the longest concrete arch spans in North America on the Fred G. Redmon Bridge, which crosses Selah Creek near the city of the same name. The Ellensburg–Yakima freeway was opened on November 12, 1971, and US 97 was transferred to the new highway and the Yakima Canyon route became SR 821, a scenic highway.

Major construction in the Yakima Valley began in 1977 with the building of a $5 million section (equivalent to $ in dollars) between Zillah and Granger, and a bypass of Prosser estimated to cost $7.2 million (equivalent to $ in dollars). Freeway construction was accelerated for sections bypassing the worst stretches of US 410, including winding highways or high-traffic roads. The Zillah–Granger freeway opened in January 1979, and the Prosser bypass opened in late August the same year. I-82 was then extended westward from Prosser to Grandview in January 1981 at a cost of $19 million. A connection between the existing Yakima Freeway at Union Gap and the Zillah freeway was completed on November 24, 1981, and cost $47 million to construct (equivalent to $ in dollars). The freeway&#x27;s construction created an embankment between the Yakima River and surrounding areas, which helped to worsen major floods; it also required the digging of several gravel pits nearby, which were later converted into seven trout-stocked ponds that feed a local osprey population. The last section of the Yakima Valley Freeway to be built, running from Granger to Sunnyside and Grandview, was opened to traffic on October 29, 1982, shortly after a dedication ceremony to commemorate the Yakima Valley project.

The routing of I-82 around the Tri-Cities and to the Umatilla Bridge was approved by the Benton County government in 1972, generally following SR 14 and bypassing Kennewick to the southwest. Construction on I-82 and I-182 began in 1980, using $340 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) in newly earmarked funds from the U.S. Congress. A short, section bypassing Plymouth and preparing for the new Umatilla Bridge was opened to traffic on August 31, 1981, and cost $5 million to construct (equivalent to $ in dollars). The remaining sections on SR 14 between Plymouth and Kennewick were constructed and paved between 1983 and 1985. US 395 was re-aligned onto the new freeway in 1985, replacing an earlier alignment that traveled through Wallula, while SR 14 was truncated to Plymouth and SR 143 was eliminated. The final section of I-82 within Washington state, spanning from Kiona to an interchange south of Kennewick, was dedicated on February 23, 1986, and opened the following month. During construction of I-82, a pair of fossilized tusks belonging to a mastodon and Columbian mammoth were found by workers near Kiona and Plymouth, respectively, and were excavated by local archaeologists. The existing divided highway between Prosser and Kiona, built in 1960, was upgraded to Interstate standards in 1987 at a cost of $19.2 million (equivalent to $ in dollars).

Construction of the northbound Umatilla Bridge, located upriver from the original bridge, began in 1985. The new bridge cost $16.5 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) and was completed in October 1987 after two years of construction. The final section of I-82, extending between Umatilla and Hermiston, began construction in February 1984 and was dedicated and opened to traffic on September 20, 1988. It was also the final segment of the Interstate Highway system in Oregon, which spanned . The southbound Umatilla Bridge underwent a major $5.2 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) rehabilitation project and re-opened in July 1990. The total cost to construct I-82 was estimated in 1988 to be $317 million (equivalent to $ in dollars), of which $288 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) was spent in Washington and $29 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) was spent in Oregon.

===Later years===

I-80N was renumbered to I-84 in 1980 as part of a mandate by American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to eliminate suffixed routes and reduce traveler confusion. The designation of I-82 fell outside the standard numbering scheme for Interstates, which uses comparatively higher numbers for the northernmost east–west routes. A 1970s proposal to renumber I-82 to remain in compliance with the numbering scheme was rejected by the Washington State Department of Highways due to the cost of sign replacement and potential for public confusion.

In 1999, the Oregon Legislative Assembly passed a bill directing the Oregon Department of Transportation to study a proposal for an extension of I-82 to the California or Nevada border. The study was completed two years later and outlined three general routes that would replace existing north–south highways in eastern Oregon. The westernmost route would follow US 97 from Klamath Falls through Bend and Redmond to Biggs Junction, relying on I-84 to complete its connection with I-82. A variation of the route with a direct connection to I-82 near Hermiston would branch off at Madras and travel northeastward through a mountainous region along Route 218 and Route 207. The easternmost route would follow US 395 between the California border and Pendleton, passing through a less-densely populated region but serving Burns and John Day. The study found that a new freeway would have little effect on economic growth in eastern Oregon and congestion relief in the Willamette Valley, but would provide a suitable alternative route for long-haul travel.

Since the 1990s, the Washington state government has improved or rebuilt several interchanges on I-82, particularly in the Yakima area. In 1998, SR 823 was extended southward from Selah to northern Yakima via a new road in the median of I-82, whose bridges over the Naches and Yakima rivers were also refurbished. The Valley Mall interchange in Union Gap was rebuilt from 2009 to 2011 using a series of roundabouts and a loop ramp to replace the existing freeway ramps. In 2010, two overpasses carrying I-82 were demolished and replaced with new structures that would accommodate a future widening project. A separate proposal in the early 2010s included a third lane for I-82 in northern Yakima, but it was postponed in favor of the building of a new interchange and east–west road at the Cascade Mill development site. A proposal to add climbing lanes for trucks on the steep grades in the Manastash Ridge between Ellensburg and Yakima was made in the 2000s and remains unfunded .

I-82&#x27;s current interchange with SR 224 in Kiona was rebuilt in 2016 and will be supplemented with a new interchange serving the Red Mountain AVA. Construction of the new interchange, which was intended to divert traffic bound for the winery region and new development near West Richland, was proposed by local politicians in the early 2000s but failed to earn funding from the state. The project was postponed in September 2019 after federal officials stated that the traffic volumes would be too low to justify an interchange.

<text>The Monsanto Company () was an American agrochemical and agricultural biotechnology corporation founded in 1901 and headquartered in Creve Coeur, Missouri. Monsanto&#x27;s best-known product is Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide, developed in the 1970s. Later, the company became a major producer of genetically engineered crops. In 2018, the company ranked 199th on the Fortune 500 of the largest United States corporations by revenue.

Monsanto was one of four groups to introduce genes into plants in 1983, and was among the first to conduct field trials of genetically modified crops in 1987. It was one of the top-ten U.S. chemical companies until it divested most of its chemical businesses between 1997 and 2002, through a process of mergers and spin-offs that focused the company on biotechnology. 

Monsanto was one of the first companies to apply the biotechnology industry business model to agriculture, using techniques developed by biotech drug companies. In this business model, companies recoup R&amp;D expenses by exploiting biological patents.

Monsanto&#x27;s roles in agricultural changes, biotechnology products, lobbying of government agencies, and roots as a chemical company have resulted in controversies. The company once manufactured controversial products such as the insecticide DDT, PCBs, Agent Orange, and recombinant bovine growth hormone.

In September 2016, German chemical company Bayer announced its intent to acquire Monsanto for US$66 billion in an all-cash deal. After gaining U.S. and EU regulatory approval, the sale was completed on June 7, 2018. The name &quot;Monsanto&quot; was no longer used, but Monsanto&#x27;s previous product brand names were maintained. In June 2020, Bayer agreed to pay numerous settlements in lawsuits involving ex-Monsanto products Roundup, PCBs and Dicamba. Owing to the massive financial and reputational blows caused by ongoing litigation concerning Monsanto&#x27;s herbicide Roundup, the Bayer-Monsanto merger is considered one of the worst corporate mergers in history.

==History==
===&quot;Pre-Pharmacia&quot; Monsanto===
==== 1901 to WWII ====
In 1901, Monsanto was founded in St. Louis, Missouri, as a chemical company. The founder was John Francis Queeny, who, at age 42, was a 30‑year veteran of the nascent pharmaceutical industry. He funded the firm with his own money and capital from a soft drink distributor. He used for the company name the maiden name of his wife, Olga Méndez Monsanto, who was a scioness of the Monsanto family. 

The company&#x27;s first products were commodity food additives, such as the artificial sweetener saccharin, caffeine and vanillin.

Monsanto expanded to Europe in 1919 in a partnership with Graesser&#x27;s Chemical Works at Cefn Mawr, Wales. The venture produced vanillin, aspirin and its raw ingredient salicylic acid, and later rubber processing chemicals. 

In the 1920s, Monsanto expanded into basic industrial chemicals such as sulfuric acid and PCBs. Queeny&#x27;s son Edgar Monsanto Queeny took over the company in 1928. 

In 1926 the company founded and incorporated a town called Monsanto in Illinois (now known as Sauget). It was formed to provide minimal regulation and low taxes for Monsanto plants at a time when local jurisdictions had most of the responsibility for environmental rules. It was renamed in honor of Leo Sauget, its first village president.

In 1935, Monsanto bought the Swann Chemical Company in Anniston, Alabama, and thereby entered the business of producing PCBs.

In 1936, Monsanto acquired Thomas &amp; Hochwalt Laboratories in Dayton, Ohio, to acquire the expertise of Charles Allen Thomas and Carroll A. Hochwalt. The acquisition became Monsanto&#x27;s Central Research Department. Thomas spent the rest of his career at Monsanto, serving as President (1951–1960) and Board Chair (1960–1965). He retired in 1970. In 1943, Thomas was called to a meeting in Washington, D.C., with Leslie Groves, commander of the Manhattan Project, and James Conant, president of Harvard University and chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC). They urged Thomas to become co-director of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos with Robert Oppenheimer, but Thomas was reluctant to leave Dayton and Monsanto. He joined the NDRC, and Monsanto&#x27;s Central Research Department began to conduct related research. To that end, Monsanto operated the Dayton Project, and later Mound Laboratories, and assisted in the development of the first nuclear weapons.

==== Post-WWII ====
In 1946, Monsanto developed and marketed &quot;All&quot; laundry detergent, which it sold to Lever Brothers in 1957. In 1947, its styrene factory was destroyed in the Texas City Disaster. In 1949, Monsanto acquired American Viscose Corporation from Courtaulds. In 1954, Monsanto partnered with German chemical giant Bayer to form Mobay and market polyurethanes in the United States.

Monsanto began manufacturing DDT in 1944, along with some 15 other companies. This insecticide was used to kill malaria-transmitting mosquitoes, but it was banned in the United States in 1972 due to its harmful environmental impacts.

In 1977, Monsanto stopped producing PCBs; Congress banned PCB production two years later.

====1960s and 1970s====
In the mid‑1960s, William Standish Knowles and his team invented a way to selectively synthesize enantiomers via asymmetric hydrogenation. This was the first method for the catalytic production of pure chiral compounds. Knowles&#x27; team designed the &quot;first industrial process to chirally synthesize an important compound&quot;—L‑dopa, which is used to treat Parkinson&#x27;s disease. In 2001, Knowles and Ryōji Noyori won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In the mid-1960s, chemists at Monsanto developed the Monsanto process for making acetic acid, which until 2000 was the most widely used production method. In 1964, Monsanto chemists invented AstroTurf (initially ChemGrass).

In the 1960s and 1970s, Monsanto was a producer of Agent Orange for United States Armed Forces operations in Vietnam, and settled out of court in a lawsuit brought by veterans in 1984. In 1968, it became the first company to start mass production of (visible) light-emitting diodes (LEDs), using gallium arsenide phosphide. From 1968 to 1970, sales doubled every few months. Their products (discrete LEDs and seven-segment numeric displays) became industry standards. The primary markets then were electronic calculators, digital watches and digital clocks. Monsanto became a pioneer of optoelectronics in the 1970s.

Between 1968 and 1974, the company sponsored the PGA Tour event in Pensacola, Florida, which was renamed the Monsanto Open.

In 1974, Harvard University and Monsanto signed a 10-year research grant to support the cancer research of Judah Folkman, which became the largest such arrangement ever made; medical inventions arising from that research were the first for which Harvard allowed its faculty to submit patent application.

====1980 to 1989: Becoming an agribiotech company====
Monsanto scientists were among the first to genetically modify a plant cell, publishing their results in 1983. Five years later the company conducted the first field tests of genetically modified crops. Increasing involvement in agricultural biotechnology dates from the installment of Richard Mahoney as Monsanto&#x27;s CEO in 1983. This involvement increased under the leadership of Robert Shapiro, appointed CEO in 1995, leading ultimately to the disposition of product lines unrelated to agriculture.

In 1985, Monsanto acquired G.D. Searle &amp; Company, a life sciences company that focused on pharmaceuticals, agriculture and animal health. In 1993, its Searle division filed a patent application for Celebrex, which in 1998 became the first selective COX‑2 inhibitor to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Celebrex became a blockbuster drug and was often mentioned as a key reason for Pfizer&#x27;s acquisition of Monsanto&#x27;s pharmaceutical business in 2002.

====1990 to 1999: Moving into the seed market &amp; industry consolidation====
In 1994, Monsanto introduced a recombinant version of bovine somatotropin, brand-named Posilac. Monsanto later sold this business to Eli Lilly and Company.

In 1996, Monsanto purchased Agracetus, the biotechnology company that had generated the first transgenic cotton, soybeans, peanuts and other crops, and from which Monsanto had been licensing technology since 1991.

In 1997, Monsanto divested Solutia, a company created to carry off the responsibility for Monsanto&#x27;s PCB business and associated liabilities, along with some related organic chemical production.

Monsanto first entered the maize seed business when it purchased 40% of Dekalb in 1996; it purchased the remainder of the corporation in 1998. In 1997, the company first published an annual report citing Monsanto&#x27;s Law, a biotechnological take on Moore&#x27;s Law, indicating its future directions and exponential growth in the use of biotechnology. In the same year, Californian GMO company Calgene was acquired. In 1998, Monsanto purchased Cargill&#x27;s international seed business, which gave it access to sales and distribution facilities in 51 countries. In 2005, it finalized the purchase of Seminis Inc, a leading global vegetable and fruit seed company, for $1.4 billion. This made it the world&#x27;s largest conventional seed company.

In 1999, Monsanto sold off NutraSweet Co. In December of the same year, Monsanto agreed to merge with Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, in a deal valuing the transaction at $27 billion. The agricultural division became a wholly owned subsidiary of the &quot;new&quot; Pharmacia; Monsanto&#x27;s medical research division, which included products such as Celebrex.

====&quot;Pre-Pharmacia&quot; Monsanto overview====

===&quot;Post-Pharmacia&quot; Monsanto===
====2000 to 2009: Birth of the &quot;new&quot; Monsanto====
In 2000, Pharmacia spun off its agro-biotech subsidiary into a new company, the &quot;new Monsanto&quot;, focused on four key agricultural crops—soybeans, maize, wheat and cotton. Monsanto agreed to indemnify Pharmacia against potential liabilities from judgments against Solutia. As a result, the new Monsanto continued to be a party to numerous lawsuits over the prior Monsanto. Pharmacia was bought by Pfizer in 2003.

In 2005, Monsanto acquired Emergent Genetics and its Stoneville and NexGen cotton brands. Emergent was the third-largest U.S. cotton seed company, with about 12% of the U.S. market. Monsanto&#x27;s goal was to obtain &quot;a strategic cotton germplasm and traits platform&quot;.

Also in 2005, Monsanto purchased Seminis, the California-based world leader in vegetable seed production, for $1.4 billion. Seminis developed new vegetable varieties using advanced cross-pollination methods. Monsanto indicated that Seminis would continue with non-GM development, while not ruling out GM in the longer term.

In June 2007, Monsanto purchased Delta and Pine Land Company, a major cotton seed breeder, for $1.5 billion. As a condition for approval from the Department of Justice, Monsanto was obligated to divest its Stoneville cotton business, which it sold to Bayer, and to divest its NexGen cotton business, which it sold to Americot. Monsanto also exited the pig-breeding business by selling Monsanto Choice Genetics to Newsham Genetics LC in November, divesting itself of &quot;any and all swine-related patents, patent applications, and all other intellectual property&quot;. In 2007, Monsanto and BASF announced a long-term agreement to cooperate in the research, development, and marketing of new plant biotechnology products.

In 2008, Monsanto purchased Dutch seed company De Ruiter Seeds for €546 million, and sold its POSILAC bovine somatotropin brand and related business to Elanco Animal Health, a division of Eli Lilly &amp; Co, in August for $300 million plus &quot;additional contingent consideration&quot;.

====2010 to 2017: Further growth, Syngenta====
In 2012, Monsanto purchased for $210 million Precision Planting Inc., a company that produced computer hardware and software designed to enable farmers to increase yield and productivity through more precise planting.

Monsanto purchased San Francisco–based Climate Corp for $930 million in 2013. Climate Corp makes local weather forecasts for farmers based on data modelling and historical data; if the forecasts were wrong, the farmer was compensated.

In May 2013, a worldwide protest against Monsanto corporation, called March Against Monsanto, was held in over 400 cities. A second protest took place in May 2014.

Monsanto tried to acquire Swiss agro-biotechnology rival Syngenta for US$46.5 billion in 2015, but failed. In that year Monsanto was the world&#x27;s biggest supplier of seeds, controlling 26% of the global seed market (Du Pont was second with 21%). Monsanto was the only manufacturer of white phosphorus for military use in the US.

====&quot;Post-Pharmacia&quot; Monsanto overview====

=== Sale to Bayer ===
In September 2016, Monsanto agreed to be acquired by Bayer for US$66 billion. In an effort to receive regulatory clearance for the deal, Bayer announced the sale of significant portions of its current agriculture businesses, including its seed and herbicide businesses, to BASF.

The deal was approved by the European Union on March 21, 2018, and approved in the United States on May 29, 2018. The sale closed on June 7, 2018; Bayer announced its intent to discontinue the Monsanto name, with the combined company operating solely under the Bayer brand.

Under the terms of merger, Bayer promised to maintain Monsanto&#x27;s more than 9,000 U.S. jobs and add 3,000 new U.S. high-tech positions.

The prospective merger parties said at the time the combined agriculture business planned to spend $16 billion on research and development over the next six years and at least $8 billion on research and development in United States.

Bayer would also establish its new global Seeds &amp; Traits and North American commercial headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri.

The Bayer-Monsanto merger is widely considered to be one of the worst mergers in history, mostly due to the exposure to Roundup litigation. By 2023, Bayer&#x27;s market value had declined by over 60% since its 2016 merger, leaving the company&#x27;s overall worth at less than half of what it paid to acquire Monsanto.

==Products and associated issues==

===Current products===

====Glyphosate herbicides====
Following its 1970 introduction, Monsanto&#x27;s last commercially relevant United States patent on the herbicide glyphosate (brand name RoundUp) expired in 2000. Glyphosate has since been marketed by many agrochemical companies, in various solution strengths and with various adjuvants, under dozens of tradenames. As of 2009, glyphosate represented about 10% of Monsanto&#x27;s revenue. Roundup-related products (which include genetically modified seeds) represented about half of Monsanto&#x27;s gross margin.

====Crop seed====
As of 2015, Monsanto&#x27;s line of seed products included corn, cotton, soy and vegetable seeds.

==== Row crops ====
Many of Monsanto&#x27;s agricultural seed products are genetically modified, such as for resistance to herbicides, including glyphosate and dicamba. Monsanto calls glyphosate-tolerant seeds &quot;Roundup Ready&quot;. Monsanto&#x27;s introduction of this system (planting a glyphosate-resistant seed and then applying glyphosate once plants emerged) allowed farmers to increase yield by planting rows closer together. Without it, farmers had to plant rows far enough apart to allow the control of post-emergent weeds with mechanical tillage. Farmers widely adopted the technology—for example over 80% of maize (Mon 832), soybean (MON-Ø4Ø32-6), cotton, sugar beet and canola planted in the United States are glyphosate-tolerant. Monsanto developed a Roundup Ready genetically modified wheat (MON 71800) but ended development in 2004 due to concerns from wheat exporters about the rejection of genetically modified (GM) wheat by foreign markets.

Two patents were critical to Monsanto&#x27;s GM soybean business; one expired in 2011 and the other in 2014. The second expiration meant that glyphosate resistant soybeans became &quot;generic&quot;. The first harvest of generic glyphosate-tolerant soybeans came in 2015. Monsanto broadly licensed the patent to other seed companies that include glyphosate resistance trait in their seed products. About 150 companies have licensed the technology, including competitors Syngenta and DuPont Pioneer.

Monsanto invented and sells genetically modified seeds that make a crystalline insecticidal protein from &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot;, known as Bt. In 1995 Monsanto&#x27;s potato plants producing Bt toxin were approved by the Environmental Protection Agency, following approval by the FDA, making it the first pesticide-producing crop to be approved in the United States. Monsanto subsequently developed Bt maize (MON 802, MON 809, MON 863, MON 810), Bt soybean and Bt cotton.

Monsanto produces seed that has multiple genetic modifications, also known as &quot;stacked traits&quot;—for instance, cotton that make one or more Bt proteins and is resistant to glyphosate. One of these, created in collaboration with Dow Chemical Company, is called SmartStax. In 2011 Monsanto launched the Genuity brand for its stacked-trait products.

As of 2012, the agricultural seed lineup included &quot;Roundup Ready&quot; alfalfa, canola and sugarbeet; Bt and/or &quot;Roundup Ready&quot; cotton; sorghum hybrids; soybeans with various oil profiles, most with the &quot;Roundup Ready&quot; trait; and a wide range of wheat products, many of which incorporate the nontransgenic &quot;clearfield&quot; imazamox-tolerant trait from BASF.

In 2013 Monsanto launched the first transgenic drought tolerance trait in a line of corn hybrids branded DroughtGard. The MON 87460 trait is provided by the insertion of the cspB gene from the soil microbe &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;; it was approved by the USDA in 2011 and by China in 2013.

The &quot;Xtend Crop System&quot; includes seed genetically modified to be resistant to both glyphosate and dicamba, and a herbicide product including those two active ingredients. In December 2014, the system was approved for use in the US. In February 2016, China approved the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend system. The lack of European Union approval led many American traders to reject the use of Xtend soybeans over concerns that the new seeds would become mixed with EU-approved seeds, leading Europe to reject American soybean exports.

==== India-specific issues ====
In 2009, Monsanto scientists discovered insects that had developed resistance to the Bt Cotton planted in Gujarat. Monsanto communicated this to the Indian government and its customers, stating that &quot;Resistance is natural and expected, so measures to delay resistance are important. Among the factors that may have contributed to pink bollworm resistance to the Cry1Ac protein in Bollgard I in Gujarat are limited refuge planting and early use of unapproved Bt cotton seed, planted prior to GEAC approval of Bollgard I cotton, which may have had lower protein expression levels.&quot; The company advised farmers to switch to its second generation of Bt cotton – Bolgard II – which had two resistance genes instead of one, the widely recognised best practice to forestall, prevent, and cope with any kind of pesticide resistance. However, this advice was criticized: &quot;an internal analysis of the statement of the Ministry of Environment and Forests says it &#x27;appears that this could be a business strategy to phase out single gene events [that is, the first-generation Bollgard I product] and promote double genes [the second generation Bollgard II] which would fetch higher price.

Monsanto&#x27;s GM cotton seed was the subject of NGO agitation because of its higher cost. Indian farmers crossed GM varieties with local varieties, using plant breeding, violating their agreements with Monsanto. In 2009, high prices of Bt Cotton were blamed for forcing farmers of Jhabua district into debt when the crops died due to lack of rain.

==== Vegetables ====
In 2012 Monsanto was the world&#x27;s largest supplier of non-GE vegetable seeds by value, with sales of $800M. 95% of the research and development for vegetable seed is in conventional breeding. The company concentrates on improving flavor. According to their website they sell &quot;4,000 distinct seed varieties representing more than 20 species&quot;. Broccoli, with the brand name &quot;Beneforté&quot;, with increased amounts of glucoraphanin was introduced in 2010 following development by its Seminis subsidiary.

===Former products===

====Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)====
Until it ended production in 1977, Monsanto was the source of 99% of the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) used by U.S. industry. They were sold under brand names including Aroclor and Santotherm; the name Santotherm is still used for non-chlorinated products. PCBs are a persistent organic pollutant, and cause cancer in both animals and humans, among other health effects. PCBs were initially welcomed due to the electrical industry&#x27;s need for durable, safer (than flammable mineral oil) cooling and insulating fluid for industrial transformers and capacitors. PCBs were also commonly used as stabilizing additives in the manufacture of flexible PVC coatings for electrical wiring and in electronic components to enhance PVC heat and fire resistance. As transformer leaks occurred and toxicity problems arose near factories, their durability and toxicity became recognized as serious problems. PCB production was banned by the U.S. Congress in 1979 and by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001.

==== Agent Orange ====

Monsanto, Dow Chemical, and eight other chemical companies made Agent Orange for the U.S. Department of Defense. It was given its name from the color of the orange-striped barrels in which it was shipped, and was by far the most widely used of the so-called &quot;Rainbow Herbicides&quot;.

==== Bovine somatotropin ====
Monsanto developed and sold recombinant bovine somatotropin (also known as rBST and rBGH), a synthetic hormone that increases milk production by 11–16% when injected into cows. In October 2008, Monsanto sold this business to Eli Lilly for $300 million plus additional considerations.

The use of rBST remains controversial with respect to its effects on cows and their milk.

In some markets, milk from cows that are not treated with rBST is sold with labels indicating that it is rBST-free: this milk has proved popular with consumers. In reaction to this, in early 2008 a pro-rBST advocacy group called &quot;American Farmers for the Advancement and Conservation of Technology&quot; (AFACT), made up of dairies and originally affiliated with Monsanto, formed and began lobbying to ban such labels. AFACT stated that &quot;absence&quot; labels can be misleading and imply that milk from cows treated with rBST is inferior.

===Uncommercialized products===
Monsanto also developed notable technologies that were not ultimately commercialized.

====&quot;Terminator&quot; seeds====
Genetic use restriction technology, colloquially known as &quot;terminator technology&quot;, produces plants with sterile seeds. This trait would prevent the spread of those seeds into the wild. It also would prevent farmers from planting seeds they harvest, requiring them to purchase seed for every planting, allowing the company to enforce its licensing terms via technology. Farmers have been buying hybrid seeds for generations, instead of replanting their harvest, because second-generation hybrid seeds are inferior. Nevertheless, most seed companies contract only with farmers who agree not to plant harvested seeds.

Terminator technology has been developed by governmental labs, university researchers and companies. The technology has not been used commercially. Rumors that Monsanto and other companies intended to introduce terminator technology caused protests, for example in India.

In 1999, Monsanto pledged not to commercialize terminator technology. The Delta &amp; Pine Land Company of Mississippi intended to commercialize the technology, but D&amp;PL was acquired by Monsanto in 2007.

Monsanto &quot;Terminator seeds&quot; were never commercialized nor used in any farmer&#x27;s field anywhere in the world. The patent expired in 2015.

==== GM wheat ====

Monsanto developed several strains of genetically modified wheat, including glyphosate-resistant strains, in the 1990s. Field tests were done in the United States between 1998 and 2005. As of 2017, no genetically modified wheat had been released for commercial use.

== Legal affairs ==

Monsanto engaged in high-profile lawsuits, as both plaintiff and defendant. It defended lawsuits mostly over its products&#x27; health and environmental effects. Monsanto used the courts to enforce its patents, particularly in agricultural biotechnology, an approach similar to that of other companies in the field, such as Dupont Pioneer and Syngenta. Monsanto also became one of the most controversial large corporations in the world, over a range of issues involving its industrial and agricultural chemical products, and GM seed. In April 2018, just prior to Bayer&#x27;s acquisition, Bayer indicated that improving Monsanto&#x27;s reputation represented a major challenge. That June, Bayer announced it would drop the Monsanto name as part of a campaign to regain consumer trust.

===Argentina===
Argentina approved &quot;Roundup Ready&quot; soy in 1996. Between 1996 and 2008 soy production grew from 14 million acres to 42 million acres. The growth was driven by Argentine investors&#x27; interest in export markets. The consolidation led to a decrease in production of many staples such as milk, rice, maize, potatoes and lentils. As of 2004, about 150,000 small farmers had left the countryside; as of 2009, 50% in the Chaco region.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that a Monsanto representative had said, &quot;any problems with GM soya were to do with use of the crop as a monoculture, not because it was GM. If you grow any crop to the exclusion of any other you are bound to get problems.&quot;

In 2005 and 2006, Monsanto attempted to enforce its patents on soymeal originating in Argentina and shipped to Spain by having Spanish customs officials seize the soymeal shipments. The seizures were part of a larger attempt by Monsanto to put pressure on the Argentinian government to enforce Monsanto&#x27;s seed patents.

In 2013 environmentalist groups objected to a Monsanto corn seed conditioning facility in Malvinas Argentinas, Córdoba. Neighbours objected to the risk of environmental impact. Court rulings supported the project, but environmentalist groups organised demonstrations and opened an online petition for the subject to be decided in a popular referendum. The court rulings stipulated that while construction could continue, the facility could not begin operating until the environmental impact report required by law had been duly presented.

In 2016 Monsanto reached an agreement with Argentina&#x27;s government on soybean seed royalty payments. Monsanto agreed to give the Argentine Seed Institute (Inase) oversight over crops grown from Monsanto&#x27;s Intacta genetically modified soybean seeds. Before the agreement, Argentine farmers generally avoided royalties by using seeds from previous harvests or purchased from non-registered suppliers. Inase agreed to delegate testing to grain exchanges. About 6 million sample tests were to be conducted annually. Seeds that appear to be GMOs may be tested again using a polymerase chain reaction test.

===Brazil===
Brazil is the second largest producer of GMO soy. In 2003 GM soy was found in fields planted in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. This was a controversial decision, and in response, the Landless Workers&#x27; Movement protested by invading and occupying several Monsanto farm plots used for research, training and seed-processing. In 2005 Brazil passed a law creating a regulatory pathway for GM crops.

===China===
Monsanto was criticized by Chinese economist Larry Lang for controlling the Chinese soybean market, and for trying to do the same to Chinese corn and cotton.

===India===

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, public attention was drawn to suicides by indebted farmers following crop failures. For example, in the early 2000s, farmers in Andhra Pradesh (AP) were in economic crisis due to high-interest rates and crop failures, leading to widespread unrest and farmer suicides. Monsanto was one focus of protests with respect to the price and yields of Bt seed. In 2005, the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee, the Indian regulatory authority, released a study on field tests of certain Bt cotton strains in AP and ruled that Monsanto could not market those strains in AP because of poor yields. At about the same time, the state agriculture minister barred the company from selling Bt cotton seed, because Monsanto refused a request by the state government to provide pay about Rs 4.5 crore (about one million US$) to indebted farmers in some districts, and because the government blamed Monsanto&#x27;s seeds for crop failures. The order was later lifted.

In 2006, AP tried to convince Monsanto to reduce the price of Bt seeds. Unsatisfied, the state filed several cases against Monsanto and its Mumbai-based licensee, Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds. Research by International Food Policy Research Institute found no evidence supporting an increased suicide rate following the introduction of Bt cotton and that Bt cotton. The report stated that farmer suicides predated commercial introduction in 2002 (and unofficial introduction in 2001) and that such suicides had made up a fairly constant portion of the overall national suicide rate since 1997. The report concluded that while Bt cotton may have been a factor in specific suicides, the contribution was likely marginal compared to socio-economic factors. As of 2009, Bt cotton was planted in 87% of Indian cotton-growing land.

Critics including Vandana Shiva said that the crop failures could &quot;often be traced to&quot; Monsanto&#x27;s Bt cotton, that the seeds increased farmer indebtedness and argued that Monsanto misrepresented the profitability of their Bt Cotton, causing losses leading to debt. In 2009, Shiva wrote that Indian farmers who had previously spent as little as ₹7 (rupees) per kilogram were now paying up to ₹17,000 per kilo per year for Bt cotton. In 2012 the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the Central Cotton Research Institute (CCRI) stated that for the first time farmer suicides could be linked to a decline in the performance of Bt cotton, and advised, &quot;cotton farmers are in a deep crisis since shifting to Bt cotton. The spate of farmer suicides in 2011–12 has been particularly severe among Bt cotton farmers.&quot;

In 2004, in response to an order from the Bombay High Court the Tata Institute produced a report on farmer suicides in Maharashtra in 2005. The survey cited &quot;government apathy, the absence of a safety net for farmers, and lack of access to information related to agriculture as the chief causes for the desperate condition of farmers in the state.&quot;

Various studies identified the important factors as insufficient or risky credit systems, the difficulty of farming semi-arid regions, poor agricultural income, absence of alternative income opportunities, a downturn in the urban economy which forced non-farmers into farming and the absence of suitable counseling services. ICAR and CCRI stated that the cost of cotton cultivation had jumped as a consequence of rising pesticide costs, while total Bt cotton production in the five years from 2007 to 2012 had declined.

===United Kingdom===

Brofiscin Quarry was used as a waste site from about 1965 to 1972 and accepted waste from BP, Veolia and Monsanto. A 2005 report by Environment Agency Wales (EAW) found that the quarry contained up to 75 toxic substances, including heavy metals, Agent Orange and PCBs.

In February 2011, Monsanto agreed to help with the costs of remediation, but did not accept responsibility for the pollution. In 2011, EAW and the Rhondda Cynon Taf council announced that they had decided to place an engineered cap over the waste mass, and stated that the cost would be £1.5 million; previous estimates had been as high as £100 million.

=== United States ===

==== PCBs ====
In the late 1960s, the Monsanto plant in Sauget, Illinois, was the nation&#x27;s largest producer of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) compounds, which remained in the water along Dead Creek there. An EPA official referred to Sauget as &quot;one of the most polluted communities in the region&quot; and &quot;a soup of different chemicals&quot;.

In Anniston, Alabama, plaintiffs in a 2002 lawsuit provided documentation showing that the local Monsanto factory knowingly discharged both mercury and PCB-laden waste into local creeks for over 40 years. In 1969 Monsanto dumped 45 tons of PCBs into Snow Creek, a feeder for Choccolocco Creek, which supplies much of the area&#x27;s drinking water, and buried millions of pounds of PCB in open-pit landfills located on hillsides above the plant and surrounding neighborhoods. In August 2003, Solutia and Monsanto agreed to pay plaintiffs $700 million to settle claims by over 20,000 Anniston residents.

In June 2020, Bayer proposed paying $650 million to settle local PCB lawsuits, and $170 million to the attorneys-general of New Mexico, Washington and the District of Columbia. Monsanto was acknowledged at the time of the settlement to have ceased making PCBs in 1977, though State Impact of Pennsylvania reported that this did not stop PCBs from contaminating people many years later. State Impact of Pennsylvania stated &quot;In 1979, the EPA banned the use of PCBs, but they still exist in some products produced before 1979. They persist in the environment because they bind to sediments and soils. High exposure to PCBs can cause birth defects, developmental delays, and liver changes.&quot; On November 25, 2020, however U.S. District Judge Fernando M. Olguin rejected the proposed $650 million settlement from Bayer and allowed Monsanto-related lawsuits involving PCB to proceed.

In January 2025, Monsanto was ordered to pay $100 million to four people who say they were sickened by PCBs at a school in Monroe, Washington.

==== Polluted sites ====
As of November 2013, Monsanto was associated with nine &quot;active&quot; Superfund sites and 32 &quot;archived&quot; sites in the US, in the EPA&#x27;s Superfund database. Monsanto was sued and settled multiple times for damaging the health of its employees or residents near its Superfund sites through pollution and poisoning.

==== GM wheat ====

In 2013 a Monsanto-developed transgenic cultivar of glyphosate-resistant wheat was discovered on a farm in Oregon, growing as a weed or &quot;volunteer plant&quot;. The final Oregon field test had occurred in 2001. As of May 2013, the GMO seed source was unknown. Volunteer wheat from a former test field two miles away was tested and was not found to be glyphosate-tolerant. Monsanto faced penalties up to $1 million over potential violations of the Plant Protection Act. The discovery threatened world-leading US wheat exports, which totaled $8.1 billion in 2012. This wheat variety was rarely exported to Europe and was more likely destined for Asia. Monsanto said it had destroyed all the material it held after completing trials in 2004 and it was &quot;mystified&quot; by its appearance. On June 14, 2013, the USDA announced: &quot;As of today, USDA has neither found nor been informed of anything that would indicate that this incident amounts to more than a single isolated incident in a single field on a single farm. All information collected so far shows no indication of the presence of GE wheat in commerce.&quot; As of August 30, 2013, while the source of the GM wheat remained unknown, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan had all resumed placing orders.

==== Cancer risks of Roundup ====

Monsanto has faced controversy in the United States over claims that its herbicide products might be carcinogens. There is limited evidence that human cancer risk might increase as a result of occupational exposure to large amounts of glyphosate, as in agricultural work, but no good evidence of such a risk from home use, such as in domestic gardening. The consensus among national pesticide regulatory agencies and scientific organizations is that labeled uses of glyphosate have demonstrated no evidence of human carcinogenicity. Organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization, European Commission, Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency, and the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment have concluded that there is no evidence that glyphosate poses a carcinogenic or genotoxic risk to humans. However, one international scientific organization, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), affiliated with the WHO, has made claims of carcinogenicity in research reviews; in 2015 the IARC declared glyphosate &quot;probably carcinogenic&quot;.

As of October 30, 2019, there were 42,700 plaintiffs who said that glyphosate herbicides caused their cancer after the IARC report in 2015 linking glyphosate to cancer in humans. Monsanto denies that Roundup is carcinogenic.

In March 2017, 40 plaintiffs filed a lawsuit at the Alameda County Superior Court, a branch of the California Superior Court, asking for damages caused by the company&#x27;s glyphosate-based weed-killers, including Roundup, and demanding a jury trial. On August 10, 2018, Monsanto lost the first decided case. Dewayne Johnson, who has non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, was initially awarded $289 million in damages after a jury in San Francisco said that Monsanto had failed to adequately warn consumers of cancer risks posed by the herbicide. Pending appeal, the award was later reduced to $78.5 million. In November 2018, Monsanto appealed the judgement, asking an appellate court to consider a motion for a new trial. A verdict on the appeal was delivered in June 2020 upholding the verdict but further reducing the award to $21.5 million.

On March 27, 2019, Monsanto was found liable in a federal court for Edwin Hardeman&#x27;s non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma and ordered to pay $80 million in damages. A spokesperson for Bayer, by this time the parent company of Monsanto, said the company would appeal the verdict.

On May 13, 2019, a jury in California ordered Bayer to pay $2 billion in damages after finding that the company had failed to adequately inform consumers of the possible carcinogenicity of Roundup. On July 26, 2019, an Alameda County judge cut the settlement to $86.7 million, stating that the judgement by the jury exceeded legal precedent.

In June 2020, Monsanto acquisitor Bayer agreed to settle over a hundred thousand Roundup cancer lawsuits, agreeing to pay $8.8 to $9.6 billion to settle those claims, and $1.5 billion for any future claims. The settlement does not include three cases that have already gone to jury trials and are being appealed.

====Dicamba lawsuits====
Following a lawsuit by a peach farmer alleging that Dicamba used as a weed killer drifted in the wind from adjacent crops to destroy his peach orchards, a Missouri trial jury found in February 2020 that Monsanto and codefendant BASF were negligent in design of Dicamba and failed to warn farmers about the product, awarding $15 million for losses and $250 million in punitive damages. On February 14, 2020, the jury involved in a Missouri lawsuit involving tree damage caused by dicamba drift ruled against Bayer and its co-defendant BASF and found in favor of Bader Farms owner Bill Bader. In June 2020, Bayer agreed to a settlement of up to $400 million for all 2015–2020 crop year dicamba claims, not including the $250 million judgement which was issued to Bader. On November 25, 2020, U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh Jr. reduced the punitive damage amount in the Bader Farms case to $60 million.

=== Improper accounting for incentive rebates ===
From 2009 to 2011, Monsanto improperly accounted for incentive rebates. The actions inflated Monsanto&#x27;s reported profit by $31 million over the two years. Monsanto paid $80 million in penalties pursuant to a subsequent settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Monsanto materially misstated its consolidated earnings in response to losing market share of Roundup to generic producers. Monsanto overhauled its internal controls. Two of their top CPAs were suspended and Monsanto was required to hire, at their expense, an independent ethics/compliance consultant for two years.

===Alleged ghostwriting===

A review of glyphosate&#x27;s carcinogenic potential by four independent expert panels, with a comparison to the IARC assessment, was published in September 2016. Using emails released in August 2017 by plaintiffs&#x27; lawyers who are suing Monsanto, &quot;Bloomberg Business Week&quot; reported that &quot;Monsanto scientists were heavily involved in organizing, reviewing, and editing drafts submitted by the outside experts.&quot; A Monsanto spokesperson responded that Monsanto had provided only non-substantive cosmetic copyediting.

In 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that a 2015 article attributed to researcher and columnist Henry I. Miller had been drafted by Monsanto. According to the report, Monsanto asked Miller to write an article rebutting the findings of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and he indicated willingness to do it if he &quot;could start from a high-quality draft&quot;. Forbes later removed Miller&#x27;s blog from Forbes.com and ended their relationship.

==Government relations==

===United States===
Monsanto regularly lobbied the US government with expenses reaching $8.8 million in 2008 and $6.3 million in 2011. $2 million was spent on matters concerning &quot;Foreign Agriculture Biotechnology Laws, Regulations, and Trade&quot;. Some US diplomats in Europe at other times worked directly for Monsanto.

California&#x27;s 2012 Proposition 37 would have mandated the disclosure of genetically modified crops used in the production of California food products. Monsanto spent $8.1 million opposing passage, making it the largest contributor against the initiative. The proposition was rejected by a 53.7% majority. Labeling is not required in the US.

In 2009 Michael R. Taylor, food safety expert and former Monsanto VP for Public Policy, became a senior advisor to the FDA Commissioner.

Monsanto is a member of the Washington D.C.–based Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), the world&#x27;s largest biotechnology trade association, which provides &quot;advocacy, business development, and communications services.&quot; Between 2010 and 2011 BIO spent a total of $16.43 million on lobbying.

The Monsanto Company Citizenship Fund aka Monsanto Citizenship Fund is a political action committee that donated over $10 million to various candidates from 2003 to 2013.

As of October 2013, Monsanto and DuPont Co. continued backing an anti-labeling campaign, spending roughly $18 million. The state of Washington, along with 26 other states, made proposals in November to require GMO labeling.

====Revolving door====
In the US regulatory environment, many individuals move back and forth between positions in the public and private sectors, including at Monsanto. Critics argued that the connections between the company and the government allowed Monsanto to obtain favorable regulations at the expense of consumer safety. Supporters of the practice point to the benefits of competent and experienced individuals in both sectors and to the importance of appropriately managing potential conflicts of interest. The list of such people includes:

*Linda J. Fisher—EPA assistant administrator, then Monsanto VP from 1995 to 2000. then EPA deputy administrator.
*Michael A. Friedman, MD—FDA deputy commissioner.
*Earle H. Harbison Jr., Central Intelligence Agency Deputy Director, then President, Chief Operating Officer, and Director, from 1986 to 1993.
*Robert Holifield—chief of staff of Senate Agriculture Committee, then partner in Lincoln Policy Group.
*Mickey Kantor—US trade representative, then Monsanto board member.
*Blanche Lincoln—US Senator and chair of Agriculture Committee, then founder of lobbying firm Lincoln Policy Group
*William D. Ruckelshaus—EPA Administrator, then acting Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and then Deputy Attorney General of the United States, then EPA administrator, then Monsanto Board member.
*Donald Rumsfeld—Secretary of Defense and previous secretary of Searle, a Monsanto subsidiary, for eight years
*Michael R. Taylor—assistant to the FDA commissioner, then attorney for King &amp; Spalding, then FDA deputy commissioner for policy on food safety between 1991 and 1994. He was cleared of conflict of interest accusations. Then he became Monsanto&#x27;s VP for Public Policy, becoming Senior Advisor to the FDA Commissioner for the Obama administration.
* Clarence Thomas—Supreme Court Justice who worked as an attorney for Monsanto in the 1970s, then wrote the majority opinion in &quot;J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc.&quot; finding that &quot;newly developed plant breeds are patentable under the general utility patent laws of the United States.&quot;
*Ann Veneman—Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, and member of the board of directors of Calgene

===United Kingdom===
During the late 1990s, Monsanto lobbied to raise permitted glyphosate levels in soybeans and was successful in convincing Codex Alimentarius and both the UK and US governments to lift levels 200 times to 20 milligrams per kilogram of soya. When asked how negotiations with Monsanto were conducted, Lord Donoughue, then the Labour Party Agriculture minister in the House of Lords, stated that all information relating to the matter would be &quot;kept secret&quot;. During the 24 months prior to the 1997 British election Monsanto representatives had 22 meetings at the departments of Agriculture and the Environment. Stanley Greenberg, an election advisor to Tony Blair, later worked as a Monsanto consultant. Former Labour spokesperson David Hill, became Monsanto&#x27;s media adviser at the lobbying firm Bell Pottinger. The Labour government was challenged in Parliament about &quot;trips, facilities, gifts and other offerings of financial value provided by Monsanto to civil servants&quot;, but only acknowledged that Department of Trade and Industry had two working lunches with Monsanto. Peter Luff, then a Conservative Party MP and Chairman of the Agriculture Select Committee, received up to £10,000 a year from Bell Pottinger on behalf of Monsanto.

===European Union===
In January 2011, WikiLeaks documents suggested that US diplomats in Europe responded to a request for help from the Spanish government. One report stated, &quot;In addition, the cables show US diplomats working directly for GM companies such as Monsanto. &#x27;In response to recent urgent requests by [Spanish rural affairs ministry] state secretary Josep Puxeu and Monsanto, post requests renewed US government support of Spain&#x27;s science-based agricultural biotechnology position through high-level US government intervention.&#x27;&quot; The leaked documents showed that in 2009, when the Spanish government&#x27;s policy approving MON810 was under pressure from EU interests, Monsanto&#x27;s Director for Biotechnology for Spain and Portugal requested that the US government support Spain on the matter. The leaks indicated that Spain and the US had worked closely together to &quot;persuade the EU not to strengthen biotechnology laws&quot;. Spain was viewed as a key GMO supporter and a leading indicator of support across the continent. The leaks also revealed that in response to an attempt by France to ban MON810 in late 2007, then-US ambassador to France, Craig Roberts Stapleton, asked Washington to &quot;calibrate a targeted retaliation list that [would cause] some pain across the EU&quot;, targeting countries that did not support the use of GM crops. This activity transpired after the US, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, India, Mexico and New Zealand had brought an action against Europe via the World Trade Organization with respect to the EU&#x27;s banning of GMOs; in 2006, the WTO had ruled against the EU.

Monsanto was a member of EuropaBio, the leading biotechnology trade group in Europe. One of EuropaBio&#x27;s initiatives is &quot;Transforming Europe&#x27;s position on GM food&quot;. It found &quot;an urgent need to reshape the terms of the debate about GM in Europe&quot;. EuropaBio proposed the recruitment of high-profile &quot;ambassadors&quot; to lobby EU officials.

In September 2017 Monsanto lobbyists were banned from the European parliament after the Monsanto refused to attend a parliamentary hearing into allegations of regulatory interference.

=== Haiti ===
After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Monsanto donated $255,000 for disaster relief and 60,000 seed sacks (475 tons) of hybrid (non-GM) corn and vegetable seeds worth $4 million. However, a Catholic Relief Services (CRS) rapid assessment of seed supply and demand for the five most common food security crops found that the Haitians had enough seed and recommended that imported seeds be introduced only on a small scale. Emmanuel Prophete, head of Haiti&#x27;s Ministry of Agriculture&#x27;s Service National Semencier (SNS), stated that SNS was not opposed to the hybrid maize seeds because they at least double yields. Louise Sperling, Principal Researcher at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) told HGW that she was not opposed to hybrids, but noted that most hybrids required extra water and better soils and that most of Haiti was not appropriate for hybrids.

Activists objected that some of the seeds were coated with the fungicides Maxim or thiram. In the United States, pesticides containing thiram are banned in home garden products because most home gardeners do not have adequate protection. Activists wrote that the coated seeds were handled in a dangerous manner by the recipients.

The donated seeds were sold at a reduced price in local markets. However, farmers feared that they were being given seeds that would &quot;threaten local varieties&quot;.

== Public relations ==
Monsanto has engaged in various public relations campaigns to improve its image and public perception of some of its products. These include developing a relationship with scientist Richard Doll with respect to Agent Orange. Other campaigns include the joint funding with other biotech companies for the website GMO Answers.

=== University relationships ===
Monsanto was a major funder of science research at Washington University in St. Louis for many years. This research was highlighted by the Washington University/Monsanto Biomedical Research Agreement, which brought more than $100 million of research funding to the university. Washington University built the Monsanto Laboratory of the Life Sciences in 1965. In 2015, Monsanto gave Washington University&#x27;s Institute for School Partnership a $1.94 million grant to help better teach students in STEM fields.

==Awards==
In 2009 Monsanto was chosen as &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s company of the year. In 2010 Swiss research firm Covalence rated Monsanto least ethical of 581 multinational corporations based on their EthicalQuote reputation tracking index which &quot;aggregates thousands of positive and negative news items published by the media, companies, and stakeholders&quot;, without attempt to validate sources. The journal &quot;Science&quot; ranked Monsanto in its Top 20 Employers list between 2011 and 2014. In 2012, it described the company as &quot;innovative leader in the industry&quot;, &quot;makes changes needed&quot; and &quot;does important quality research&quot;. Monsanto executive Robert Fraley won the World Food Prize for &quot;breakthrough achievements in founding, developing, and applying modern agricultural biotechnology&quot;.

<text>Human nutrition deals with the provision of essential nutrients in food that are necessary to support human life and good health. Poor nutrition is a chronic problem often linked to poverty, food security, or a poor understanding of nutritional requirements. Malnutrition and its consequences are large contributors to deaths, physical deformities, and disabilities worldwide. Good nutrition is necessary for children to grow physically and mentally, and for normal human biological development.
== Recommended Dietary Allowances ==
The Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are scientifically determined levels of essential nutrient intake, deemed sufficient by the Food and Nutrition Board to meet the nutritional needs of nearly all healthy individuals.

The first RDAs were published in 1943, during World War II, with the aim of setting standards for optimal nutrition. The initial editions outlined daily nutrient recommendations for various age groups, reflecting the latest scientific insights at the time (NRC, 1943). The history and evolution of the RDAs have been extensively detailed by the chair of the first Committee on Recommended Dietary Allowances (Roberts, 1958). Over the years, the RDAs have been periodically updated, with the current version being the tenth edition.

Originally intended to address nutrition issues related to national defense, the RDAs now serve multiple roles, including guiding food supply planning for population groups, interpreting dietary intake data, establishing standards for food assistance programs, assessing the nutritional adequacy of food supplies, designing nutrition education initiatives, aiding in the development of new food products, and setting guidelines for food labeling. However, the data underpinning these nutrient requirement estimates are often limited.

The nutritional requirements system adopted by the United States and Canada refers to Dietary Reference Intake (DRI). The DRI is a set of nutritional guidelines developed by the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), part of the National Academies in the United States. Established in 1997, the DRI was created to expand upon the previous standards known as the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs). Unlike the RDAs, the DRI encompasses a broader range of nutritional recommendations. The DRI values are distinct from those found on food and dietary supplement labels in the U.S. and Canada, which use Reference Daily Intakes (RDIs) and Daily Values (%). These labeling standards were originally based on RDAs from 1968 but were updated in 2016.

Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) represent the nutritional standards set by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Department of Health and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for assessing and planning dietary intakes. The UK&#x27;s Department of Health introduced these guidelines in 1991 with the publication of &quot;Dietary Reference Values for Food Energy and Nutrients for the United Kingdom&quot;. This document provides recommended nutrient intakes for the UK population, offering a framework for ensuring adequate nutrition.

DRVs are categorized into three main types: Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI), which covers the nutritional needs of 95% of the population; Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), meeting the needs of 50%; and Lower Recommended Nutritional Intake (LRNI), which addresses the requirements of 5% of the population. These categories help to tailor dietary recommendations to different segments of the population, ensuring a more personalized approach to nutrition.

== Nutrients ==
The seven major classes of nutrients are carbohydrates, fats, fiber, minerals, proteins, vitamins, and water. Nutrients can be grouped as either macronutrients or micronutrients (needed in small quantities). Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are macronutrients, and provide energy. Water and fiber are macronutrients, but do not provide energy. The micronutrients are minerals and vitamins.

The macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino acids from which proteins are built, and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built), and energy. Some of the structural material can also be used to generate energy internally, and in either case it is measured in joules or kilocalories (often called &quot;Calories&quot; and written with a capital &#x27;C&#x27; to distinguish them from little &#x27;c&#x27; calories). Carbohydrates and proteins provide 17 kJ approximately (4 kcal) of energy per gram, while fats provide 37 kJ (9 kcal) per gram. However, the net energy derived from the macronutrients depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort, which vary substantially from instance to instance.

Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not provide energy, but are required for other reasons. A third class of dietary material, fiber (i.e., nondigestible material such as cellulose), seems also to be required, for both mechanical and biochemical reasons, though the exact reasons remain unclear. For all age groups, males on average need to consume higher amounts of macronutrients than females. In general, intakes increase with age until the second or third decade of life.

Some nutrients can be stored – the fat-soluble vitamins – while others are required more or less continuously. Poor health can be caused by a lack of required nutrients, or for some vitamins and minerals, too much of a required nutrient. &quot;Essential&quot; nutrients cannot be synthesized by the body, and must be obtained from food.

Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates range from simple monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose) to complex polysaccharides (starch, glycogen). Fats are triglycerides, made of assorted fatty acid monomers bound to a glycerol backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are essential in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. The fundamental components of protein are nitrogen-containing amino acids, some of which are essential in the sense that humans cannot make them internally. Some of the amino acids can be converted (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production just as ordinary glucose, in a process known as gluconeogenesis. By breaking down existing protein, some glucose can be produced internally; the remaining amino acids are discarded, primarily as urea in urine. This occurs naturally when atrophy takes place, or during periods of starvation.

The list of nutrients that people are known to require is, in the words of Marion Nestle, &quot;almost certainly incomplete&quot;.

=== Carbohydrates ===


Carbohydrates may be classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides or polysaccharides depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain. They are a diverse group of substances, with a range of chemical, physical and physiological properties. They make up a large part of foods such as rice, noodles, bread, and other grain-based products, but they are not an essential nutrient, meaning a human does not need to eat carbohydrates.

Monosaccharides contain one sugar unit, disaccharides two, and polysaccharides three or more. Monosaccharides include glucose, fructose and galactose. Disaccharides include sucrose, lactose, and maltose; purified sucrose, for instance, is used as table sugar. Polysaccharides, which include starch and glycogen, are often referred to as &#x27;complex&#x27; carbohydrates because they are typically long multiple-branched chains of sugar units.

Traditionally, simple carbohydrates were believed to be absorbed quickly, and therefore raise blood-glucose levels more rapidly than complex carbohydrates. This is inaccurate. Some simple carbohydrates (e.g., fructose) follow different metabolic pathways (e.g., fructolysis) that result in only a partial catabolism to glucose, while, in essence, many complex carbohydrates may be digested at the same rate as simple carbohydrates. The World Health Organization recommends that added sugars should represent no more than 10% of total energy intake.

The most common plant carbohydrate nutrient starch varies in its absorption. Starches have been classified as rapidly digestible starch, slowly digestible starch and resistant starch. Starches in plants are resistant to digestion (resistant starch), but cooking the starch in the presence of water can break down the starch granule and releases the glucose chains, making them more easily digestible by human digestive enzymes. Historically, food was less processed and starches were contained within the food matrix, making them less digestible. Modern food processing has shifted carbohydrate consumption from less digestible and resistant starch to much more rapidly digestible starch. For instance, the resistant starch content of a traditional African diet was 38 grams/day. The resistant starch consumption from countries with high starch intakes has been estimated to be 30-40 grams/day. In contrast, the average consumption of resistant starch in the United States was estimated to be 4.9 grams/day (range 2.8-7.9 grams of resistant starch/day).

=== Fat ===

A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several fatty acids (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a glycerol. They are typically found as triglycerides (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may be classified as saturated or unsaturated depending on the chemical structure of the fatty acids involved. Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms double-bonded, so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids. Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat with &quot;trans&quot;-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) hydrogenation. There are nine kilocalories in each gram of fat. Fatty acids such as conjugated linoleic acid, catalpic acid, eleostearic acid and punicic acid, in addition to providing energy, represent potent immune modulatory molecules.

Saturated fats (typically from animal sources) have been a staple in many world cultures for millennia. Unsaturated fats (e. g., vegetable oil) are considered healthier, while trans fats are to be avoided. Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature (such as butter or lard), while unsaturated fats are typically liquids (such as olive oil or flaxseed oil). Trans fats are very rare in nature, and have been shown to be highly detrimental to human health, but have properties useful in the food processing industry, such as rancidity resistance.

==== Essential fatty acids ====

Most fatty acids are non-essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are essential and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids—omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids—seems also important for health, although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these &quot;omega&quot; long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins, which have roles throughout the human body.

The omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly inflammatory PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g. pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 linoleic acid (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins. In industrialized societies, people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils, which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids.

The conversion rate of omega-6 DGLA to AA largely determines the production of the prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2. Omega-3 EPA prevents AA from being released from membranes, thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from pro-inflammatory PGE2 (made from AA) toward anti-inflammatory PGE1 (made from DGLA). The conversion (desaturation) of DGLA to AA is controlled by the enzyme delta-5-desaturase, which in turn is controlled by hormones such as insulin (up-regulation) and glucagon (down-regulation).

=== Fiber ===
Dietary fiber is a carbohydrate, specifically a polysaccharide, which is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals. Fiber slows down the absorption of sugar in the gut. The microbiome converts fiber into signals that stimulate gut hormones, which in turn control how quickly the stomach empties, regulate blood sugar levels, and influence feelings of hunger. Like all carbohydrates, when fiber is digested, it can produce four calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram, but in most circumstances, it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility.

The two subcategories are &quot;insoluble&quot; and &quot;soluble&quot; fiber.

;Insoluble dietary fiber
:Includes cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer that is indigestible by humans, because humans do not have the required enzymes to break it down, and the human digestive system does not harbor enough of the types of microbes that can do so.
:Includes resistant starch, an insoluble starch that resists digestion either because it is protected by a shell or food matrix (Type 1 resistant starch, RS1), maintains the natural starch granule (Type 2 resistant starch, RS2), is retrograded and partially crystallized (Type 3 resistant starch, RS3), has been chemically modified (Type 4 resistant starch, RS4) or has complexed with a lipid (Type 5 resistant starch, RS5). Natural sources of resistant starch (RS1, RS2 and RS3) are fermented by the microbes in the human digestive system to produce short-chain fatty acids which are utilized as food for the colonic cells or absorbed.

;Soluble dietary fiber
:Comprises a variety of oligosaccharides, waxes, esters, and other carbohydrates that dissolve or gelatinize in water. Many of these soluble fibers can be fermented or partially fermented by microbes in the human digestive system to produce short-chain fatty acids which are absorbed and therefore introduce some caloric content.

Whole grains, beans, and other legumes, fruits (especially plums, prunes, and figs), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. Fiber has three primary mechanisms, which in general determine their health impact: bulking, viscosity and fermentation. Fiber provides bulk to the intestinal contents, and insoluble fiber facilitates peristalsis – the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines which move contents along the digestive tract. Some soluble and insoluble fibers produce a solution of high viscosity; this is essentially a gel, which slows the movement of food through the intestines. Fermentable fibers are used as food by the microbiome, mildly increasing bulk, and producing short-chain fatty acids and other metabolites, including vitamins, hormones, and glucose. One of these metabolites, butyrate, is important as an energy source for colon cells, and may improve metabolic syndrome.

In 2016, the U.S. FDA approved a qualified health claim stating that resistant starch might reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, but with qualifying language for product labels that only limited scientific evidence exists to support this claim. The FDA requires specific labeling language, such as the guideline concerning resistant starch: &quot;High-amylose maize resistant starch may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. FDA has concluded that there is limited scientific evidence for this claim.&quot;

=== Amino acids ===

Proteins are the basis of many animal body structures (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair) and form the enzymes that control chemical reactions throughout the body. Each protein molecule is composed of amino acids which contain nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the keratin in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). Amino acids are soluble in the digestive juices within the small intestine, where they are absorbed into the blood. Once absorbed, they cannot be stored in the body, so they are either metabolized as required or excreted in the urine. Proteins consist of amino acids in different proportions. The most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its amino acid composition.

For all animals, some amino acids are &quot;essential&quot; (an animal cannot produce them internally so they must be eaten) and some are &quot;non-essential&quot; (the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds). About twenty amino acids are found in the human body, and about ten of these are essential. The synthesis of some amino acids can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions, such as prematurity in the infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress, and those are called conditionally essential.

A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for instance). A complete protein source contains all the essential amino acids; an incomplete protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids. It is possible with protein combinations of two incomplete protein sources (e.g., rice and beans) to make a complete protein source, and characteristic combinations are the basis of distinct cultural cooking traditions. However, complementary sources of protein do not need to be eaten at the same meal to be used together by the body. Excess amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called gluconeogenesis.

There is an ongoing debate about the differences in nutritional quality and adequacy of protein from vegan, vegetarian and animal sources, though many studies and institutions have found that a well-planned vegan or vegetarian diet contains enough high-quality protein to support the protein requirements of both sedentary and active people at all stages of life.

=== Water ===
Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; including urine and feces, sweating, and by water vapour in the exhaled breath. Therefore, it is necessary to adequately rehydrate to replace lost fluids.

Early recommendations for the quantity of water required for maintenance of good health suggested that six to eight glasses of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration. However, the notion that a person should consume eight glasses of water per day cannot be traced to a credible scientific source. The original water intake recommendation in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council read: &quot;An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food. Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods.&quot; More recent comparisons of well-known recommendations on fluid intake have revealed large discrepancies in the volumes of water we need to consume for good health. Therefore, to help standardize guidelines, recommendations for water consumption are included in two recent European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) documents (2010): (i) Food-based dietary guidelines and (ii) Dietary reference values for water or adequate daily intakes (ADI). These specifications were provided by calculating adequate intakes from measured intakes in populations of individuals with &quot;desirable osmolarity values of urine and desirable water volumes per energy unit consumed&quot;.

For healthful hydration, the current EFSA guidelines recommend total water intakes of 2.0 L/day for adult females and 2.5 L/day for adult males. These reference values include water from drinking water, other beverages, and from food. About 80% of our daily water requirement comes from the beverages we drink, with the remaining 20% coming from food. Water content varies depending on the type of food consumed, with fruit and vegetables containing more than cereals, for example. These values are estimated using country-specific food balance sheets published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.

The EFSA panel also determined intakes for different populations. Recommended intake volumes in the elderly are the same as for adults as despite lower energy consumption, the water requirement of this group is increased due to a reduction in renal concentrating capacity. Pregnant and breastfeeding women require additional fluids to stay hydrated. The EFSA panel proposes that pregnant women should consume the same volume of water as non-pregnant women, plus an increase in proportion to the higher energy requirement, equal to 300 mL/day. To compensate for additional fluid output, breastfeeding women require an additional 700 mL/day above the recommended intake values for non-lactating women. Dehydration and over-hydration – too little and too much water, respectively – can have harmful consequences. Drinking too much water is one of the possible causes of hyponatremia, i.e., low serum sodium.

=== Minerals ===
Dietary minerals are inorganic chemical elements required by living organisms, other than the four elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen that are present in nearly all organic molecules. Some have roles as cofactors, while others are electrolytes. The term &quot;mineral&quot; is archaic, since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet. Some are heavier than the four just mentioned – including several metals, which often occur as ions in the body. Some dietitians recommend that these be supplied from foods in which they occur naturally, or at least as complex compounds, or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources (such as calcium carbonate from ground oyster shells). Some are absorbed much more readily in the ionic forms found in such sources. On the other hand, minerals are often artificially added to the diet as supplements; the most well-known is likely iodine in iodized salt which prevents goiter.

==== Macrominerals ====
Elements with recommended dietary allowance (RDA) greater than 150 mg/day are, in alphabetical order:
*Calcium (Ca2+) is vital to the health of the muscular, circulatory, and digestive systems; is indispensable to the building of bone; and supports the synthesis and function of blood cells. For example, calcium is used to regulate the contraction of muscles, nerve conduction, and the clotting of blood. It can play this role because the Ca2+ ion forms stable coordination complexes with many organic compounds, especially proteins; it also forms compounds with a wide range of solubility, enabling the formation of the skeleton. Food sources include yogurt, milk, cheese, leafy greens, tofu, and fortified beverages.
*Chlorine as chloride ions; electrolyte; see sodium, below.
* Magnesium, required for processing ATP and related reactions (builds bone, causes strong peristalsis, increases flexibility, increases alkalinity). Approximately 50% is in bone, the remaining 50% is almost all inside body cells, with only about 1% located in extracellular fluid. Food sources include oats, buckwheat, tofu, nuts, caviar, green leafy vegetables, legumes, and chocolate.
* Phosphorus, required component of bones; essential for energy processing. Approximately 80% is found in the inorganic portion of bones and teeth. Phosphorus is a component of every cell, as well as important metabolites, including DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholipids. Also important in pH regulation. It is an important electrolyte in the form of phosphate. Food sources include cheese, egg yolk, milk, meat, fish, poultry, whole-grain cereals, and many others.
* Potassium, an electrolyte (heart and nerve function). With sodium, potassium is involved in maintaining normal water balance, osmotic equilibrium, and acid-base balance. In addition to calcium, it is important in the regulation of neuromuscular activity. Food sources include bananas, avocados, nuts, vegetables, potatoes, legumes, fish, and mushrooms.
* Sodium, a common food ingredient and electrolyte, found in most foods and manufactured consumer products, typically as sodium chloride (salt). Excessive sodium consumption can deplete calcium and magnesium. Sodium has a role in the etiology of hypertension demonstrated from studies showing that a reduction of table salt intake may reduce blood pressure.

==== Trace minerals ====
Many elements are required in smaller amounts (microgram quantities), usually because they play a catalytic role in enzymes. Some trace mineral elements (RDA &lt; 200 mg/day) are, in alphabetical order:
* Cobalt as a component of the vitamin B12 family of coenzymes
* Copper required component of many redox enzymes, including cytochrome c oxidase (see Copper in health)
* Chromium required for sugar metabolism
* Iodine required not only for the biosynthesis of thyroxin, but probably, for other important organs as breast, stomach, salivary glands, thymus etc. (see Iodine deficiency); for this reason iodine is needed in larger quantities than others in this list, and sometimes classified with the macrominerals; Nowadays it is most easily found in iodized salt, but there are also natural sources such as &quot;Kombu&quot;.
* Iron required for many enzymes, and for hemoglobin and some other proteins
* Manganese (processing of oxygen)
* Molybdenum required for xanthine oxidase and related oxidases
* Selenium required for peroxidase (antioxidant proteins)
* Zinc required for several enzymes such as carboxypeptidase, liver alcohol dehydrogenase, carbonic anhydrase

==== Ultratrace minerals ====
Ultratrace minerals are an as yet unproven aspect of human nutrition, and may be required at amounts measured in very low ranges of μg/day. Many ultratrace elements have been suggested as essential, but such claims have usually not been confirmed. Definitive evidence for efficacy comes from the characterization of a biomolecule containing the element with an identifiable and testable function. These include:
* Bromine
* Arsenic
* Nickel
* Fluorine
* Boron
* Lithium
* Strontium
* Silicon
* Vanadium

=== Vitamins ===
Except for vitamin D, vitamins are essential nutrients, necessary in the diet for good health. Vitamin D can be synthesized in the skin in the presence of UVB radiation. (Many animal species can synthesize vitamin C, but humans cannot.) Certain vitamin-like compounds that are recommended in the diet, such as carnitine, are thought useful for survival and health, but these are not &quot;essential&quot; dietary nutrients because the human body has some capacity to produce them from other compounds. Moreover, thousands of different phytochemicals have recently been discovered in food (particularly in fresh vegetables), which may have desirable properties including antioxidant activity (see below); experimental demonstration has been suggestive but inconclusive. Other essential nutrients not classed as vitamins include essential amino acids (see above), essential fatty acids (see above), and the minerals discussed in the preceding section.

Vitamin deficiencies may result in disease conditions: goiter, scurvy, osteoporosis, impaired immune system, disorders of cell metabolism, certain forms of cancer, symptoms of premature aging, and poor psychological health (including eating disorders), among many others.

Excess levels of some vitamins are also dangerous to health. The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine has established Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for seven vitamins.

== Malnutrition ==

The term malnutrition addresses 3 broad groups of conditions:
* Undernutrition, which includes wasting (low weight-for-height), stunting (low height-for-age) and underweight (low weight-for-age)
* Micronutrient-related malnutrition, which includes micronutrient deficiencies or insufficiencies (a lack of important vitamins and minerals) or micronutrient excess
* Overweight, obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers).

In developed countries, the diseases of malnutrition are most often associated with nutritional imbalances or excessive consumption; there are more people in the world who are malnourished due to excessive consumption. According to the United Nations World Health Organization, the greatest challenge in developing nations today is not starvation, but insufficient nutrition – the lack of nutrients necessary for the growth and maintenance of vital functions. The causes of malnutrition are directly linked to inadequate macronutrient consumption and disease, and are indirectly linked to factors like &quot;household food security, maternal and child care, health services, and the environment&quot;.

=== Insufficient ===
The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board sets Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for vitamins and minerals. EARs and RDAs are part of Dietary Reference Intakes. The DRI documents describe nutrient deficiency signs and symptoms.

=== Excessive ===
The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board sets Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (known as ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. ULs are set a safe fraction below amounts shown to cause health problems. ULs are part of Dietary Reference Intakes. The European Food Safety Authority also reviews the same safety questions and set its own ULs.

=== Unbalanced ===
When too much of one or more nutrients is present in the diet to the exclusion of the proper amount of other nutrients, the diet is said to be unbalanced. High calorie food ingredients such as vegetable oils, sugar and alcohol are referred to as &quot;empty calories&quot; because they displace from the diet foods that also contain protein, vitamins, minerals and fiber.

=== Illnesses caused by underconsumption and overconsumption ===
== Other substances ==
=== Alcohol (ethanol) ===
Pure ethanol provides 7 calories per gram. For distilled spirits, a standard serving in the United States is 1.5 fluid ounces, which at 40% ethanol (80 proof), would be 14 grams and 98 calories. Wine and beer contain a similar range of ethanol for servings of 5 ounces and 12 ounces, respectively, but these beverages also contain non-ethanol calories. A 5-ounce serving of wine contains 100 to 130 calories. A 12-ounce serving of beer contains 95 to 200 calories. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, based on NHANES 2013–2014 surveys, women ages 20 and up consume on average 6.8 grams/day and men consume on average 15.5 grams/day. Ignoring the non-alcohol contribution of those beverages, the average ethanol calorie contributions are 48 and 108 cal/day. Alcoholic beverages are considered empty calorie foods because other than calories, these contribute no essential nutrients.

=== Phytochemicals ===

Phytochemicals such as polyphenols are compounds produced naturally in plants (phyto means &quot;plant&quot; in Greek). In general, the term identifies compounds that are prevalent in plant foods, but are not proven to be essential for human nutrition, as of 2018. There is no conclusive evidence in humans that polyphenols or other non-nutrient compounds from plants confer health benefits, mainly because these compounds have poor bioavailability, i.e., following ingestion, they are digested into smaller metabolites with unknown functions, then are rapidly eliminated from the body.

== Intestinal microbiome ==

The intestines contain a large population of gut flora. In humans, the four dominant phyla are Bacillota, Bacteroidota, Actinomycetota, and Pseudomonadota. They are essential to digestion and are also affected by food that is consumed. Bacteria are essential for metabolizing food substrates and thereby increasing energy output, and produce a great variety of metabolites, including vitamins and short-chain fatty acids that contribute to the metabolism in a wide variety of ways. These metabolites are responsible for stimulating cell growth, repressing the growth of harmful bacteria, priming the immune system to respond only to pathogens, helping to maintain a healthy gut barrier, control gene expression by epigenetic regulation and defending against some infectious diseases.

== Global nutrition challenges ==

The challenges facing global nutrition are disease, child malnutrition, obesity, and vitamin deficiency.

=== Disease ===
The most common non-infectious diseases worldwide, that contribute most to the global mortality rate, are cardiovascular diseases, various cancers, diabetes, and chronic respiratory problems, all of which are linked to poor nutrition. Nutrition and diet are closely associated with the leading causes of death, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. Obesity and high sodium intake can contribute to ischemic heart disease, while consumption of fruits and vegetables can decrease the risk of developing cancer.

Food-borne and infectious diseases can result in malnutrition, and malnutrition exacerbates infectious disease. Poor nutrition leaves children and adults more susceptible to contracting life-threatening diseases such as diarrheal infections and respiratory infections. According to the WHO, in 2011, 6.9 million children died of infectious diseases like pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, and neonatal conditions, of which at least one third were associated with undernutrition.

=== Child malnutrition ===

According to UNICEF, in 2011, 101 million children across the globe were underweight and one in four children, 165 million, were stunted in growth. Simultaneously, there are 43 million children under five who are overweight or obese. Nearly 20 million children under five suffer from severe acute malnutrition, a life-threatening condition requiring urgent treatment. According to estimations at UNICEF, hunger will be responsible for 5.6 million deaths of children under the age of five this year. These all represent significant public health emergencies. This is because proper maternal and child nutrition has immense consequences for survival, acute and chronic disease incidence, normal growth, and economic productivity of individuals.

Childhood malnutrition is common and contributes to the global burden of disease. Childhood is a particularly important time to achieve good nutrition status, because poor nutrition has the capability to lock a child in a vicious cycle of disease susceptibility and recurring sickness, which threatens cognitive and social development. Undernutrition and bias in access to food and health services leaves children less likely to attend or perform well in school.

=== Undernutrition ===

UNICEF defines undernutrition &quot;as the outcome of insufficient food intake (hunger) and repeated infectious diseases. Undernutrition includes being underweight for one&#x27;s age, too short for one&#x27;s age (stunted growth), dangerously thin (muscle wasting), and deficient in vitamins and minerals (micronutrient malnutrition). Under nutrition causes 53% of deaths of children under five across the world. It has been estimated that undernutrition is the underlying cause for 35% of child deaths. The Maternal and Child Nutrition Study Group estimate that under nutrition, &quot;including fetal growth restriction, stunting, wasting, deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc along with suboptimum breastfeeding—is a cause of 3.1 million child deaths and infant mortality, or 45% of all child deaths in 2011&quot;.

When humans are undernourished, they no longer maintain normal bodily functions, such as growth, resistance to infection, or have insufficient drive for every everyday tasks and unsatisfactory performance in school or work. Major causes of under nutrition in young children include lack of proper breast feeding for infants and illnesses such as diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, and HIV/AIDS. According to UNICEF 146 million children across the globe, that one out of four under the age of five, are underweight. The number of underweight children has decreased since 1990, from 33 percent to 28 percent between 1990 and 2004. Underweight and stunted children are more susceptible to infection, more likely to fall behind in academics and develop non-infectious diseases, ultimately affecting their livelihood. Therefore, undernutrition can result in an accumulation of afflictions and health deficiencies which results in less productivity individually and as a community.

Many children are born with the inherent disadvantage of low birth weight, often caused by intrauterine growth restriction and poor maternal nutrition, which results in affected growth, development and health throughout the course of their lifetime. Children born at low birth weight (less than 5.5 pounds or 2.5 kg), are less likely to be healthy and are more susceptible to disease and early death. Those born at low birth weight also are likely to have a depressed immune system, which can increase their chances of heart disease and diabetes later on in life. Because 96% of low birth weight occurs in the developing world, low birth weight has been associated with childbirth in impoverished areas where the birth mother typically exhibits poor nutritional status under harsh and demanding living conditions.

Stunting and other forms of undernutrition reduces a child&#x27;s chance of survival and hinders their optimal growth and health. Stunting has demonstrated association with poor brain development, which reduces cognitive ability, academic performance and future earning potential. Important determinants of stunting include the quality and frequency of infant and child feeding, infectious disease susceptibility, and the mother&#x27;s nutrition and health status. Undernourished mothers are more likely to birth stunted children, perpetuating a cycle of undernutrition and poverty. Stunted children are more likely to develop obesity and chronic diseases upon reaching adulthood. Therefore, malnutrition resulting in stunting can further worsen the obesity epidemic, especially in low and middle income countries. This creates even new economic and social challenges for vulnerable impoverished groups.

Data on global and regional food supply shows that consumption rose from 2011 to 2012 in all regions. Diets became more diverse, with a decrease in consumption of cereals and roots and an increase in fruits, vegetables, and meat products. However, this increase masks the discrepancies between nations, where Africa, in particular, saw a decrease in food consumption over the same years. This information is derived from food balance sheets that reflect national food supplies, however, this does not necessarily reflect the distribution of micronutrients and macronutrients. Often inequality in food access leaves distribution which uneven, resulting in undernourishment for some and obesity for others.

Undernourishment, or hunger, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), is dietary intake below the minimum daily energy requirement. The amount of undernourishment is calculated utilizing the average amount of food available for consumption, the size of the population, the relative disparities in access to the food, and the minimum calories required for each individual. According to FAO, 868 million people (12% of the global population) were undernourished in 2012. This has decreased across the world since 1990, in all regions except for Africa, where undernourishment has steadily increased. However, the rates of decrease are not sufficient to meet the first Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger between 1990 and 2015. The global financial, economic, and food price crisis in 2008 drove many people to hunger, especially women and children. The spike in food prices prevented many people from escaping poverty, because the poor spend a larger proportion of their income on food and farmers are net consumers of food. High food prices cause consumers to have less purchasing power and to substitute more-nutritious foods with low-cost alternatives.

=== Adult overweight and obesity ===

Malnutrition in Industrialized nations is primarily due to non-nutritious carbohydrates sources resulting in excess caloric intake, which has contributed to the obesity epidemic affecting both developed and certain developing nations. In 2008, 35% of adults above the age of 20 years were overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2), a prevalence that has doubled worldwide between 1980 and 2008. Also 10% of men and 14% of women were obese, with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30. Rates of overweight and obesity vary across the globe, with the highest prevalence in the Americas, followed by European nations, where over 50% of the population is overweight or obese.

Obesity is more prevalent among upper-middle to high income groups compared to lower income divisions. Women are more likely than men to be obese, where the rate of obesity in women doubled from 8% to 14% between 1980 and 2008. Being overweight as a child has become an increasingly important statistic as an indicator for later development of obesity and non-infectious diseases such as cardiovascular disease. In several western European nations, the prevalence of overweight and obese children rose by 10% from 1980 to 1990, a rate that has begun to accelerate recently.

=== Vitamin and mineral malnutrition ===
Vitamins and minerals are essential to the proper functioning and maintenance of the human body. There are 20 trace elements and minerals that are essential in small quantities to body function and overall human health.

Iron deficiency is the most common inadequate nutrient worldwide, affecting approximately 2 billion people. Globally, anemia affects 1.6 billion people, and represents a public health emergency in mothers and children under five. The World Health Organization estimates that there exists 469 million women of reproductive age and approximately 600 million preschool and school-age children worldwide who are anemic. Anemia, especially iron-deficient anemia, is a critical problem for cognitive developments in children, and its presence leads to maternal deaths and poor brain and motor development in children. The development of anemia affects mothers and children more because infants and children have higher iron requirements for growth. Health consequences for iron deficiency in young children include increased perinatal mortality, delayed mental and physical development, negative behavioral consequences, reduced auditory and visual function, and impaired physical performance. The harm caused by iron deficiency during child development cannot be reversed and result in reduced academic performance, poor physical work capacity, and decreased productivity in adulthood. Mothers are also very susceptible to iron-deficient anemia because women lose iron during menstruation, and rarely supplement it in their diet. Maternal iron deficiency anemia increases the chances of maternal mortality, contributing to at least 18% of maternal deaths in low and middle income countries.

Vitamin A plays an essential role in developing the immune system in children, therefore, it is considered an essential micronutrient that can greatly affect health. However, because of the expense of testing for deficiencies, many developing nations have not been able to fully detect and address vitamin A deficiency, leaving vitamin A deficiency considered a silent hunger. According to estimates, subclinical vitamin A deficiency, characterized by low retinol levels, affects 190 million pre-school children and 19 million mothers worldwide.

The WHO estimates that 5.2 million of these children under five are affected by night blindness, which is considered clinical vitamin A deficiency. Severe vitamin A deficiency (VAD) for developing children can result in visual impairments, anemia and weakened immunity, and increase their risk of morbidity and mortality from infectious disease. This also presents a problem for women, with WHO estimating that 9.8 million women are affected by night blindness. Clinical vitamin A deficiency is particularly common among pregnant women, with prevalence rates as high as 9.8% in South-East Asia.

Estimates say that 28.5% of the global population is iodine deficient, representing 1.88 billion individuals. Although salt iodization programs have reduced the prevalence of iodine deficiency, this is still a public health concern in 32 nations. Moderate deficiencies are common in Europe and Africa, and over consumption is common in the Americas. Iodine-deficient diets can interfere with adequate thyroid hormone production, which is responsible for normal growth in the brain and nervous system. This ultimately leads to poor school performance and impaired intellectual capabilities.

=== Infant and young child feeding ===
Improvement of breast feeding practices, like early initiation and exclusive breast feeding for the first two years of life, could save the lives of 1.5 million children annually. Nutrition interventions targeted at infants aged 0–5 months first encourages early initiation of breastfeeding. Though the relationship between early initiation of breast feeding and improved health outcomes has not been formally established, a recent study in Ghana suggests a causal relationship between early initiation and reduced infection-caused neo-natal deaths. Also, experts promote exclusive breastfeeding, rather than using formula, which has shown to promote optimal growth, development, and health of infants. Exclusive breastfeeding often indicates nutritional status because infants that consume breast milk are more likely to receive all adequate nourishment and nutrients that will aid their developing body and immune system. This leaves children less likely to contract diarrheal diseases and respiratory infections.

Besides the quality and frequency of breastfeeding, the nutritional status of mothers affects infant health. When mothers do not receive proper nutrition, it threatens the wellness and potential of their children. Well-nourished women are less likely to experience risks of birth and are more likely to deliver children who will develop well physically and mentally. Maternal undernutrition increases the chances of low-birth weight, which can increase the risk of infections and asphyxia in fetuses, increasing the probability of neonatal deaths. Growth failure during intrauterine conditions, associated with improper mother nutrition, can contribute to lifelong health complications. Approximately 13 million children are born with intrauterine growth restriction annually.

=== Anorexia nervosa ===
Anorexia nervosa stands out as the psychiatric disorder with the highest mortality rate. It affects approximately 0.3% of young women and is especially common among teenage girls, with the average onset at around 15 years old. The disorder predominantly impacts females, with 80-90% of those diagnosed being women. Anorexia is the leading cause of significant weight loss in young women and is the primary reason for their admission to child and adolescent hospital services. In most cases, a clear diagnosis of weight loss driven by psychological factors can be made without resorting to a series of complex tests. Basic medical evaluations, including blood tests, electrocardiograms, and tracking the patient&#x27;s weight and measurements, not only help in identifying underlying issues but also provide a reason for the patient to return for follow-up discussions. These follow-ups can often reveal psychological challenges. When weight loss is hidden, symptoms such as depression, obsessive behaviors, infertility, or amenorrhea may be the first signs that there is cause for concern. Although relatively uncommon, eating disorders can negatively affect menstruation, fertility, and maternal and fetal well-being. Among infertile women with amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea due to eating disorders, 58% had menstrual irregularities, according to preliminary research in 1990. Recent research has shown no significant difference in fertility between women with a history of anorexia nervosa and those without, suggesting that despite experiencing high rates of menstrual irregularities, women with anorexia nervosa are still achieving pregnancy.

=== Nutrition literacy ===
The findings of the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL), conducted by the US Department of Education, provide a basis upon which to frame the nutrition literacy problem in the U.S. NAAL introduced the first-ever measure of &quot;the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions&quot; – an objective of Healthy People 2010 and of which nutrition literacy might be considered an important subset. On a scale of below basic, basic, intermediate and proficient, NAAL found 13 percent of adult Americans have proficient health literacy, 44% have intermediate literacy, 29 percent have basic literacy and 14 percent have below basic health literacy. The study found that health literacy increases with education and people living below the level of poverty have lower health literacy than those above it.

Another study examining the health and nutrition literacy status of residents of the lower Mississippi Delta found that 52 percent of participants had a high likelihood of limited literacy skills. While a precise comparison between the NAAL and Delta studies is difficult, primarily because of methodological differences, Zoellner et al. suggest that health literacy rates in the Mississippi Delta region are different from the U.S. general population and that they help establish the scope of the problem of health literacy among adults in the Delta region. For example, only 12 percent of study participants identified the MyPyramid graphic two years after it had been launched by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The study also found significant relationships between nutrition literacy and income level and nutrition literacy and educational attainment further delineating priorities for the region.

These statistics point to the complexities surrounding the lack of health/nutrition literacy and reveal the degree to which they are embedded in the social structure and interconnected with other problems. Among these problems are the lack of information about food choices, a lack of understanding of nutritional information and its application to individual circumstances, limited or difficult access to healthful foods, and a range of cultural influences and socioeconomic constraints such as low levels of education and high levels of poverty that decrease opportunities for healthful eating and living.

The links between low health literacy and poor health outcomes has been widely documented and there is evidence that some interventions to improve health literacy have produced successful results in the primary care setting. More must be done to further our understanding of nutrition literacy specific interventions in non-primary care settings in order to achieve better health outcomes.

== International food insecurity and malnutrition ==

According to UNICEF, South Asia has the highest levels of underweight children under five, followed by sub-Saharan Africans nations, with Industrialized countries and Latin nations having the lowest rates.

=== Industrialized countries ===
According to UNICEF, the Commonwealth of Independent States has the lowest rates of stunting and wasting, at 14 percent and 3 percent. The nations of Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Lithuania and Sweden have the lowest prevalence of low birthweight children in the world- at 4%. Proper prenatal nutrition is responsible for this small prevalence of low birthweight infants. However, low birthweight rates are increasing, due to the use of fertility drugs, resulting in multiple births, women bearing children at an older age, and the advancement of technology allowing more pre-term infants to survive. Industrialized nations more often face malnutrition in the form of over-nutrition from excess calories and non-nutritious carbohydrates, which has contributed greatly to the public health epidemic of obesity. Disparities, according to gender, geographic location and socio-economic position, both within and between countries, represent the biggest threat to child nutrition in industrialized countries. These disparities are a direct product of social inequalities and social inequalities are rising throughout the industrialized world, particularly in Europe.

=== North America ===

==== United States ====
In the United States, 2% of children are underweight, with under 1% stunted and 6% are wasting.

Dietitians are registered (RD) or licensed (LD) with the Commission for Dietetic Registration and the American Dietetic Association, and are only able to use the title &quot;dietitian&quot;, as described by the business and professions codes of each respective state, when they have met specific educational and experiential prerequisites and passed a national registration or licensure examination, respectively. Anyone may call themselves a nutritionist, including unqualified dietitians, as this term is unregulated. Some states, such as the State of Florida, have begun to include the title &quot;nutritionist&quot; in state licensure requirements. Most governments provide guidance on nutrition, and some also impose mandatory disclosure/labeling requirements for processed food manufacturers and restaurants to assist consumers in complying with such guidance.

Nutritional standards and recommendations are established jointly by the US Department of Agriculture and US Department of Health and Human Services. Dietary and physical activity guidelines from the USDA are presented in the concept of a plate of food which in 2011 superseded the MyPyramid food pyramid that had replaced the Food Guide Pyramid. The United States Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry is currently responsible for oversight of the USDA. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services provides a sample week-long menu which fulfills the nutritional recommendations of the government.

==== Canada ====
Canada&#x27;s Food Guide is an evidence-based education and policy tool provided by Health Canada that is designed to promote healthy eating.

=== South Asia ===
South Asia has the highest percentage and number of underweight children under five in the world, at approximately 78 million children. Patterns of stunting and wasting are similar, where 44% have not reached optimal height and 15% are wasted, rates much higher than any other regions. This region of the world has extremely high rates of underweight children. According to a 2006 UNICEF study, 46% of its child population under five is underweight. The same study indicates India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan combined account for half the globe&#x27;s underweight child population. South Asian nations have made progress towards the MDGs, considering the rate has decreased from 53% since 1990, however, a 1.7% decrease of underweight prevalence per year will not be sufficient to meet the 2015 goal. Some nations, such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have made significant improvements, all decreasing their prevalence by half in ten years. While India and Pakistan have made modest improvements, Nepal has made no significant improvement in underweight child prevalence. Other forms of undernutrition have continued to persist with high resistance to improvement, such as the prevalence of stunting and wasting, which has not changed significantly in the past 10 years. Causes of this poor nutrition include energy-insufficient diets, poor sanitation conditions, and the gender disparities in educational and social status. Girls and women face discrimination especially in nutrition status, where South Asia is the only region in the world where girls are more likely to be underweight than boys. In South Asia, 60% of children in the lowest quintile are underweight, compared to only 26% in the highest quintile, and the rate of reduction of underweight is slower amongst the poorest.

=== Eastern and Southern Africa ===
The Eastern and Southern African nations have shown no improvement since 1990 in the rate of underweight children under five. They have also made no progress in halving hunger by 2015, the most prevalent Millennium Development Goal. This is due primarily to the prevalence of famine, declined agricultural productivity, food emergencies, drought, conflict, and increased poverty. This, along with HIV/AIDS, has inhibited the nutrition development of nations such as Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Botswana has made remarkable achievements in reducing underweight prevalence, dropping 4% in 4 years, despite its place as the second leader in HIV prevalence amongst adults in the globe. South Africa, the wealthiest nation in this region, has the second-lowest proportion of underweight children at 12%, but has been steadily increasing in underweight prevalence since 1995. Almost half of Ethiopian children are underweight, and along with Nigeria, they account for almost one-third of the underweight under five in all of Sub-Saharan Africa.

=== West and Central Africa ===
West and Central Africa has the highest rate of children under five underweight in the world. Of the countries in this region, the Congo has the lowest rate at 14%, while the nations of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal and Togo are improving slowly. In Gambia, rates decreased from 26% to 17% in four years, and their coverage of vitamin A supplementation reaches 91% of vulnerable populations. This region has the next highest proportion of wasted children, with 10% of the population under five not at optimal weight. Little improvement has been made between the years of 1990 and 2004 in reducing the rates of underweight children under five, whose rate stayed approximately the same. Sierra Leone has the highest child under five mortality rate in the world, due predominantly to its extreme infant mortality rate, at 238 deaths per 1000 live births. Other contributing factors include the high rate of low birthweight children (23%) and low levels of exclusive breast feeding (4%). Anemia is prevalent in these nations, with unacceptable rates of iron deficient anemia. The nutritional status of children is further indicated by its high (10%) rate of child wasting. Wasting is a significant problem in Sahelian countries – Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger – where rates fall between 11% and 19% of under fives, affecting more than 1 million children.

In Mali, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and the Aga Khan Foundation trained women&#x27;s groups to make &quot;equinut&quot;, a healthy and nutritional version of the traditional recipe &quot;di-dèguè&quot; (comprising peanut paste, honey and millet or rice flour). The aim was to boost nutrition and livelihoods by producing a product that women could make and sell, and which would be accepted by the local community because of its local heritage.

=== Middle East and North Africa ===
Six countries in the Middle East and North Africa region are on target to meet goals for reducing underweight children by 2015, and 12 countries have prevalence rates below 10%. However, the nutrition of children in the region as a whole has degraded for the past ten years due to the increasing portion of underweight children in three populous nations – Iraq, Sudan, and Yemen. Forty six percent of all children in Yemen are underweight, a percentage that has worsened by 4% since 1990. In Yemen, 53% of children under five are stunted and 32% are born at low birth weight. Sudan has an underweight prevalence of 41%, and the highest proportion of wasted children in the region at 16%. One percent of households in Sudan consume iodized salt. Iraq has also seen an increase in child underweight since 1990. Djibouti, Jordan, the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), Oman, the Syrian Arab Republic and Tunisia are all projected to meet minimum nutrition goals, with OPT, Syrian AR, and Tunisia the fastest improving regions. This region demonstrates that undernutrition does not always improve with economic prosperity, where the United Arab Emirates, for example, despite being a wealthy nation, has similar child death rates due to malnutrition to those seen in Yemen.

=== East Asia and the Pacific ===
The East Asia and Pacific region has reached its goals on nutrition, in part due to the improvements contributed by China, the region&#x27;s most populous country. China has reduced its underweight prevalence from 19 percent to 8 percent between 1990 and 2002. China played the largest role in the world in decreasing the rate of children under five underweight between 1990 and 2004, halving the prevalence. This reduction of underweight prevalence has aided in the lowering of the under 5 mortality rate from 49 to 31 of 1000. They also have a low birthweight rate at 4%, a rate comparable to industrialized countries, and over 90% of households receive adequate iodized salts. However, large disparities exist between children in rural and urban areas, where 5 provinces in China leave 1.5 million children iodine deficient and susceptible to diseases. Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia are all projected to reach nutrition MDGs. Singapore has the lowest under five mortality rate of any nation, besides Iceland, in the world, at 3%. Cambodia has the highest rate of child mortality in the region (141 per 1,000 live births), while still its proportion of underweight children increased by 5 percent to 45% in 2000. Further nutrient indicators show that only 12 per cent of Cambodian babies are exclusively breastfed and only 14 per cent of households consume iodized salt.

=== Latin America and the Caribbean ===
This region has undergone the fastest progress in decreasing poor nutrition status of children in the world. The Latin American region has reduced underweight children prevalence by 3.8% every year between 1990 and 2004, with a current rate of 7% underweight. They also have the lowest rate of child mortality in the developing world, with only 31 per 1000 deaths, and the highest iodine consumption. Cuba has seen improvement from 9 to 4 percent underweight under 5 between 1996 and 2004. The prevalence has also decreased in the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Peru, and Chile. Chile has a rate of underweight under 5, at merely 1%. The most populous nations, Brazil and Mexico, mostly have relatively low rates of underweight under 5, with only 6% and 8%. Guatemala has the highest percentage of underweight and stunted children in the region, with rates above 45%. There are disparities amongst different populations in this region. For example, children in rural areas have twice the prevalence of underweight at 13%, compared to urban areas at 5%.

== Nutrition access disparities ==
Occurring throughout the world, lack of proper nutrition is both a consequence and cause of poverty. Impoverished individuals are less likely to have access to nutritious food and to escape from poverty than those who have healthy diets. Disparities in socioeconomic status, both between and within nations, provide the largest threat to child nutrition in industrialized nations, where social inequality is on the rise. According to UNICEF, children living in the poorest households are twice as likely to be underweight as those in the richest. Those in the lowest wealth quintile and whose mothers have the least education demonstrate the highest rates of child mortality and stunting. Throughout the developing world, socioeconomic inequality in childhood malnutrition is more severe than in upper income brackets, regardless of the general rate of malnutrition.
According to UNICEF, children in rural locations are more than twice as likely to be underweight as compared to children under five in urban areas. In Latin American/Caribbean nations, &quot;Children living in rural areas in Bolivia, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua are more than twice as likely to be underweight as children living in urban areas. That likelihood doubles to four times in Peru.&quot; Concurrently, the greatest increase in childhood obesity has been seen in the lower middle income bracket.

In the United States, the incidence of low birthweight is on the rise among all populations, but particularly among minorities.

According to UNICEF, boys and girls have almost identical rates as underweight children under age 5 across the world, except in South Asia.

== Nutrition policy ==
=== Nutrition interventions ===
Nutrition directly influences progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals of eradicating hunger and poverty through health and education. Therefore, nutrition interventions take a multi-faceted approach to improve the nutrition status of various populations. Policy and programming must target both individual behavioral changes and policy approaches to public health. While most nutrition interventions focus on delivery through the health-sector, non-health sector interventions targeting agriculture, water and sanitation, and education are important as well. Global nutrition micronutrient deficiencies often receive large-scale solution approaches by deploying large governmental and non-governmental organizations. For example, in 1990, iodine deficiency was particularly prevalent, with one in five households, or 1.7 billion people, not consuming adequate iodine, leaving them at risk to develop associated diseases. Therefore, a global campaign to iodize salt to eliminate iodine deficiency successfully boosted the rate to 69% of households in the world consuming adequate amounts of iodine.

Emergencies and crises often exacerbate undernutrition, due to the aftermath of crises that include food insecurity, poor health resources, unhealthy environments, and poor healthcare practices. Therefore, the repercussions of natural disasters and other emergencies can exponentially increase the rates of macro and micronutrient deficiencies in populations. Disaster relief interventions often take a multi-faceted public health approach. UNICEF&#x27;s programming targeting nutrition services amongst disaster settings include nutrition assessments, measles immunization, vitamin A supplementation, provision of fortified foods and micronutrient supplements, support for breastfeeding and complementary feeding for infants and young children, and therapeutic and supplementary feeding. For example, during Nigeria&#x27;s food crisis of 2005, 300,000 children received therapeutic nutrition feeding programs through the collaboration of UNICEF, the Niger government, the World Food Programme, and 24 NGOs utilizing community and facility based feeding schemes.

Interventions aimed at pregnant women, infants, and children take a behavioral and program-based approach. Behavioral intervention objectives include promoting proper breast-feeding, the immediate initiation of breastfeeding, and its continuation through 2 years and beyond. UNICEF recognizes that to promote these behaviors, healthful environments must be established conducive to promoting these behaviors, like healthy hospital environments, skilled health workers, support in the public and workplace, and removing negative influences. Finally, other interventions include provisions of adequate micro and macro nutrients such as iron, anemia, and vitamin A supplements and vitamin-fortified foods and ready-to-use products. Programs addressing micronutrient deficiencies, such as those aimed at anemia, have attempted to provide iron supplementation to pregnant and lactating women. However, because supplementation often occurs too late, these programs have had little effect. Interventions such as women&#x27;s nutrition, early and exclusive breastfeeding, appropriate complementary food and micronutrient supplementation have proven to reduce stunting and other manifestations of undernutrition. A Cochrane review of community-based maternal health packages showed that this community-based approach improved the initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth. Some programs have had adverse effects. One example is the &quot;Formula for Oil&quot; relief program in Iraq, which resulted in the replacement of breastfeeding for formula, which has negatively affected infant nutrition.

=== Implementation and delivery platforms ===
In April 2010, the World Bank and the IMF released a policy briefing entitled &quot;Scaling up Nutrition (SUN): A Framework for action&quot; that represented a partnered effort to address the Lancet&#x27;s Series on under nutrition, and the goals it set out for improving under nutrition. They emphasized the 1000 days after birth as the prime window for effective nutrition intervention, encouraging programming that was cost-effective and showed significant cognitive improvement in populations, as well as enhanced productivity and economic growth. This document was labeled the SUN framework, and was launched by the UN General Assembly in 2010 as a road map encouraging the coherence of stakeholders like governments, academia, UN system organizations and foundations in working towards reducing under nutrition. The SUN framework has initiated a transformation in global nutrition- calling for country-based nutrition programs, increasing evidence based and cost–effective interventions, and &quot;integrating nutrition within national strategies for gender equality, agriculture, food security, social protection, education, water supply, sanitation, and health care&quot;. Government often plays a role in implementing nutrition programs through policy. For instance, several East Asian nations have enacted legislation to increase iodization of salt to increase household consumption. Political commitment in the form of evidence-based effective national policies and programs, trained skilled community nutrition workers, and effective communication and advocacy can all work to decrease malnutrition. Market and industrial production can play a role as well. For example, in the Philippines, improved production and market availability of iodized salt increased household consumption. While most nutrition interventions are delivered directly through governments and health services, other sectors, such as agriculture, water and sanitation, and education, are vital for nutrition promotion as well.

== Advice and guidance ==
=== Government policies ===

Canada&#x27;s Food Guide is an example of a government-run nutrition program. Produced by Health Canada, the guide advises food quantities, provides education on balanced nutrition, and promotes physical activity in accordance with government-mandated nutrient needs. Like other nutrition programs around the world, Canada&#x27;s Food Guide divides nutrition into four main food groups: vegetables and fruit, grain products, milk and alternatives, and meat and alternatives. Unlike its American counterpart, the Canadian guide references and provides alternative to meat and dairy, which can be attributed to the growing vegan and vegetarian movements.

In the US, nutritional standards and recommendations are established jointly by the US Department of Agriculture and US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and these recommendations are published as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Dietary and physical activity guidelines from the USDA are presented in the concept of MyPlate, which superseded the food pyramid, which replaced the Four Food Groups. The Senate committee currently responsible for oversight of the USDA is the &quot;Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee&quot;. Committee hearings are often televised on C-SPAN. The U.S. HHS provides a sample week-long menu that fulfills the nutritional recommendations of the government.

=== Government programs ===
Governmental organisations have been working on nutrition literacy interventions in non-primary health care settings to address the nutrition information problem in the U.S. Some programs include:

The Family Nutrition Program (FNP) is a free nutrition education program serving low-income adults around the U.S. This program is funded by the Food Nutrition Service&#x27;s (FNS) branch of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) usually through a local state academic institution that runs the program. The FNP has developed a series of tools to help families participating in the Food Stamp Program stretch their food dollar and form healthful eating habits including nutrition education.

Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (ENFEP) is a unique program that currently operates in all 50 states and in American Samoa, Guam, Micronesia, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. It is designed to assist limited-resource audiences in acquiring the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and changed behavior necessary for nutritionally sound diets, and to contribute to their personal development and the improvement of the total family diet and nutritional well-being.

An example of a state initiative to promote nutrition literacy is Smart Bodies, a public-private partnership between the state&#x27;s largest university system and largest health insurer, Louisiana State Agricultural Center and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana Foundation. Launched in 2005, this program promotes lifelong healthful eating patterns and physically active lifestyles for children and their families. It is an interactive educational program designed to help prevent childhood obesity through classroom activities that teach children healthful eating habits and physical exercise.

=== Education ===
Nutrition is taught in schools in many countries. In England and Wales, the Personal and Social Education and Food Technology curricula include nutrition, stressing the importance of a balanced diet and teaching how to read nutrition labels on packaging. In many schools, a Nutrition class will fall within the Family and Consumer Science (FCS) or Health departments. In some American schools, students are required to take a certain number of FCS or Health related classes. Nutrition is offered at many schools, and, if it is not a class of its own, nutrition is included in other FCS or Health classes such as: Life Skills, Independent Living, Single Survival, Freshmen Connection, Health etc. In many Nutrition classes, students learn about the food groups, the food pyramid, Daily Recommended Allowances, calories, vitamins, minerals, malnutrition, physical activity, healthful food choices, portion sizes, and how to live a healthy life.

A 1985 US National Research Council report entitled &quot;Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools&quot; concluded that nutrition education in medical schools was inadequate. Only 20% of the schools surveyed taught nutrition as a separate, required course. A 2006 survey found that this number had risen to 30%. Membership by physicians in leading professional nutrition societies such as the American Society for Nutrition has generally declined from the 1990s.

=== Professional organizations ===
In the US, Registered dietitian nutritionists (RDs or RDNs) are health professionals qualified to provide safe, evidence-based dietary advice which includes a review of what is eaten, a thorough review of nutritional health, and a personalized nutritional treatment plan through dieting. They also provide preventive and therapeutic programs at work places, schools and similar institutions. Certified Clinical Nutritionists or CCNs, are trained health professionals who also offer dietary advice on the role of nutrition in chronic disease, including possible prevention or remediation by addressing nutritional deficiencies before resorting to drugs. Government regulation especially in terms of licensing, is currently less universal for the CCN than that of RD or RDN. Another advanced Nutrition Professional is a Certified Nutrition Specialist or CNS. These Board Certified Nutritionists typically specialize in obesity and chronic disease. In order to become board certified, potential CNS candidate must pass an examination, much like Registered Dieticians. This exam covers specific domains within the health sphere including; Clinical Intervention and Human Health. The National Board of Physician Nutrition Specialists offers board certification for physicians practicing nutrition medicine.

== Nutrition for special populations ==
=== Sports nutrition ===
The protein requirement for each individual differs, as do opinions about whether and to what extent physically active people require more protein. The 2005 Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), aimed at the general healthy adult population, provide for an intake of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. A review panel stating that &quot;no additional dietary protein is suggested for healthy adults undertaking resistance or endurance exercise&quot;.

The main fuel used by the body during exercise is carbohydrates, which is stored in muscle as glycogen – a form of sugar. During exercise, muscle glycogen reserves can be used up, especially when activities last longer than 90 min.

=== Maternal nutrition ===
Maternal nutrition is crucial during pregnancy and the child&#x27;s first 1,000 days of life, encompassing the period from conception to the second birthday. During the first six months, infants rely exclusively on breast milk, which remains nutritionally sufficient despite maternal nutritional challenges. However, the mother&#x27;s overall health and diet directly impact the child&#x27;s well-being. The importance of maternal nutrition is a critical influence on a child&#x27;s development during this pivotal period, as supported by recent studies. The child&#x27;s growth is divided into four key stages: (1) pregnancy, from conception to birth; (2) breastfeeding, from birth to six months; (3) the introduction of solid foods, from six to 12 months; and (4) the transition to a family diet after 12 months, with each stage requiring specific nutritional considerations for optimal development. Additionally, there is a significant connection between nutrition, overall health, and learning, with proper nutritional intake being vital for maintaining healthy body weight and supporting normal growth during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Given the rapid growth during infancy, this phase demands the highest relative energy and nutrient intake compared to other stages of development.

Proper nutrition during pregnancy plays a vital role in the development of the brain, requiring essential nutrients such as specific lipids, protein, folate, zinc, iodine, iron, and copper. Ensuring that children receive adequate nutrition during the first 1,000 days—from conception to the second birthday—significantly increases their chances of being born at a healthy weight. Additionally, it lowers the risk of various health conditions, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, while also fostering better learning abilities, fewer behavioral issues during early childhood, and improved overall health and economic stability in the long term.

=== Pediatric nutrition ===
Adequate nutrition is essential for the growth of children from infancy right through until adolescence. Some nutrients are specifically required for growth on top of nutrients required for normal body maintenance, in particular calcium and iron metabolism. Childhood dietary patterns are influenced by various factors, including feeding challenges and nutritional needs, with significant long-term consequences. During the first year, an infant&#x27;s birth weight triples, and by age five, their birth length doubles. Brain volume doubles within the first 12 months and triples by 36 months. To support this rapid growth, solid foods are introduced after six months to supplement breast milk or infant formula. As children begin to consume more table foods in their second year, they are exposed to the same diet as their caregivers, which, along with more complex food combinations, shapes their dietary habits by 24 months. Imbalances in diet during this critical period can lead to malnutrition, with the highest risk occurring around the time of weaning, typically at 12 months in the U.S. and later in the second year globally. As a child transitions from breast milk or formula, dairy milk often becomes a key nutritional source, making the quality of the diet essential for continued growth and development.

Various feeding challenges can increase the risk of malnutrition in young children. These include individual factors like food neophobia, temperament, and sensitivity to bitter tastes, as well as family-related factors such as education, income, food insecurity, and cultural norms. Young children tend to accept foods that are familiar and routine, as preferences are shaped through repeated exposure. Successful food acceptance requires caregivers to be patient, persistent, and willing to offer previously rejected foods multiple times. However, when caregivers label their child as &quot;picky&quot; or selective, they often stop offering rejected foods after just 3-5 attempts, mistakenly attributing limited food acceptance to genetics rather than learned behavior. Bribing or pressuring children to eat, along with a permissive feeding style that caters to the child&#x27;s preferences, can lead to food rejection. It&#x27;s common for young children to experience &quot;food jags&quot; (repeatedly wanting the same food) and to have shifting food preferences. While some children may exhibit a strong aversion to new foods, these reactions are usually not permanent.

To address these challenges, providing a variety of nutrient-rich foods at every meal and snack is essential, allowing children to explore and develop their preferences. The concept of &quot;responsive feeding&quot;, which involves a reciprocal relationship between the child and the caregiver during meals, is widely recommended. This approach is also supported by the U.S Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

=== Elderly nutrition ===
Malnutrition in older adults is a significant health concern, linked to increased mortality, morbidity, and physical decline, which adversely impacts daily activities and overall quality of life. This condition is common among the elderly and can also contribute to the development of geriatric syndromes. In older adults, malnutrition is typically indicated by unintentional weight loss or a low body mass index, though hidden deficiencies, such as those involving micronutrients, are often harder to detect and frequently go unnoticed, especially in community-dwelling seniors. This is generally higher among the elderly, but has different aspects in developed and undeveloped countries. In developed countries, the most common cause of malnutrition is illness, as both acute and chronic conditions can lead to or worsen nutritional deficits. As age increases the likelihood of disease, older adults are at the highest risk for nutritional challenges or malnutrition. The causes of malnutrition are complex and multifaceted, with aging processes further contributing to its development. The concerns faced with nutritional markers for the elderly are highlighted by the prevalence and determinants of malnutrition in adults over 65, encompassing factors from age-related changes to disease-related risks. The challenges in addressing, understanding, identifying, and treating malnutrition is key, noting that in some cases, targeted supplementation of macro- and micronutrients may be necessary when diet alone does not meet age-specific nutritional needs.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified healthy aging as a key priority from 2016 to 2030, developing a policy framework that advocates for action across multiple sectors. The program aims to help older adults (those aged 65 and over) maintain functional ability, ensuring their well-being and active participation in society. Older adults are the fastest-growing age group, and United Nations projections indicate that by 2050, their numbers will double those of children under five and exceed the population of adolescents aged 15 to 24. By 2050, global life expectancy, which was 72.6 years in 2019, is expected to increase by approximately five years. Maintaining good nutritional status and adequate nutrient intake is essential for health, quality of life, and overall well-being in older age, and it plays a crucial role in healthy aging as defined by the WHO.

==== Elderly Nutrition: Protein ====
While energy needs decrease with age, the demand for protein and certain nutrients actually rises to support normal bodily functions. Deficiencies in specific nutrients are also linked to cognitive decline, a common issue among older adults. Reduced daily food intake in the elderly often leads to insufficient protein consumption, contributing to sarcopenia, a condition marked by the loss of muscle mass. Approximately 30% of those aged 60 and above, and over 50% of individuals aged 80 and older, are affected by this condition. The inability to meet protein needs exacerbates health issues, including chronic muscle wasting and bone health deterioration, leading to functional decline and frailty. To mitigate this, older adults are advised to evenly distribute protein intake across meals—breakfast, lunch, and dinner. As aging diminishes the body&#x27;s ability to synthesize muscle protein, consuming adequate essential amino acids, especially leucine, is crucial. A leucine intake of at least 3 g per meal, achieved through 25-30g of high-quality protein, is necessary for effective muscle protein synthesis.

Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III indicates that the average protein intake among the elderly is 0.9g/kg of body weight per day, with half of this intake occurring at dinner. This uneven distribution can lead to sub-optimal protein synthesis and increased use of dietary amino acids for other processes like fat storage. Therefore, evenly distributing 30 g of protein throughout the day is recommended to enhance protein turnover and prevent muscle loss. Older adults, particularly those with acute or chronic illnesses, may require higher protein intake, ranging from 1.2 to 1.5g/kg per day, due to a reduced anabolic response. Some studies suggest that an intake of 1 g/kg per day is sufficient, while others recommend 1.3 to 1.73g/kg per day for better health outcomes. Research shows that muscle mass preservation is more effectively supported by animal protein, which has a higher essential amino acid content, than by plant protein. The timing of protein intake, protein source, and amino acid content are key factors in optimizing protein absorption in the elderly.

==== Elderly Nutrition: Zinc ====
Zinc is a vital micronutrient that plays a crucial role in enzymatic catabolism, immune cell function, DNA synthesis, and various micronutrient metabolisms. In the elderly, low serum zinc levels have been reported, which weakens the immune system, making them more susceptible to infections and increasing their risk of morbidity. Aging impairs T cell function, particularly due to zinc deficiency, and the reduced synthesis of metallothionein disrupts zinc balance in the gut and other tissues. This deficiency is primarily due to inadequate dietary zinc intake, compounded by factors such as poor mastication, oral health issues, medication use that interferes with absorption, and psychosocial factors that limit food intake. Additionally, epigenetic changes like DNA methylation may impair zinc transporters, leading to decreased zinc absorption as people age. Structural changes in the gut, including altered villus shape, mitochondrial changes, crypt elongation, collagen alterations, and increased cell replication time in the crypts, also significantly affect zinc absorption in the elderly.

The recommended daily allowance of zinc is 11 mg for older men and 8 mg for older women, with an upper tolerable limit of 25–40 mg per day, including both dietary and supplemental sources. However, individuals over 60 often consume less than 50% of the recommended zinc intake, which is crucial for proper body function. Data from the Third Health and Nutrition Survey in the United States revealed that only 42.5% of adults over 71 years old met adequate zinc intake levels, with many suffering from zinc deficiency. To reach the upper tolerable limit of 40 mg per day, zinc intake from both food and supplements must be considered to help normalize serum zinc levels in deficient elderly individuals. Dietary sources such as seafood, poultry, red meat, beans, fortified cereals, whole grains, nuts, and dairy products are beneficial for maintaining adequate zinc levels, though absorption is higher from animal proteins than plant-based sources.

==== Elderly Nutrition: Vitamin-B Complex ====
The Vitamin-B complex, which includes eight water-soluble vitamins, plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular function and preventing brain atrophy. Among the elderly, deficiencies in vitamins B12, B6, and folate are linked to cognitive decline and depressive symptoms.

The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for vitamin B12 is 0.9-2.4 μg/day, while the estimated average requirement in the U.S. and Canada is 0.7-2 μg/day. Elderly individuals with plasma vitamin B12 levels below 148 pmol/L are considered severely deficient, and those with levels between 148 and 221 pmol/L are marginally deficient. A deficiency in these B-vitamins, particularly B6, B12, and folate, is associated with elevated homocysteine levels, which increase the risk of alzheimer&#x27;s disease and dementia. Increased intake of these vitamins can lower homocysteine levels and reduce the risk of these conditions. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, about 6% of elderly Americans over 70 are severely deficient in vitamin B12, and more than 20% of those over 60 are mildly deficient. This deficiency is often due to insufficient food intake and malabsorption caused by degenerative digestive conditions, as indicated by elevated plasma gastrin levels in older adults. The deficiency of vitamin B6 among institutionalized elderly in Europe ranges from below 1% to 75%. B-vitamins are primarily found in animal-based foods, making deficiencies more common among those with limited animal food intake due to cultural, religious, or economic reasons. For vegetarians, fortified foods can be a viable alternative to ensure adequate vitamin B12 levels, especially when reducing laxative use to improve absorption.

==== Elderly Nutrition: Calcium &amp; Vitamin D3 ====
Aging is often marked by a decline in bone mineral density, leading to an increased risk of osteoporotic fractures and reduced mobility, especially among elderly women. Women experience greater bone loss, around 2-3% per year, particularly after menopause due to estrogen deficiency. This deficiency reduces intestinal calcium absorption, decreases calcium reabsorption by the kidneys, and increases parathyroid hormone secretion, all contributing to bone resorption. Additionally, vitamin D3 deficiency, common in older adults due to reduced skin synthesis and limited sun exposure, further disrupts calcium homeostasis by decreasing intestinal absorption of calcium. As kidney function declines with age, the conversion of vitamin D3 to its active form is impaired, exacerbating the deficiency.

Serum 25(OH)D levels below 50 nmol/L are linked to muscle weakness and reduced physical function, while levels below 25-30 nmol/L increase the risk of falls and fractures. Older adults typically consume less calcium, around 600 mg/day, which heightens their susceptibility to fractures. For optimal bone health, a calcium intake of 1000–1200 mg/day is recommended, along with 800 IU/day of vitamin D3 for those with adequate sun exposure, and up to 2000 IU/day for those with limited sun exposure or obesity. However, dietary factors like phytates, oxalates, tannins, and high sodium can impair calcium absorption and retention, underscoring the need to maintain sufficient levels of both calcium and vitamin D3 through diet or supplementation to reduce the risk of pathologic fractures.

==== Elderly Nutrition: Iron ====
Iron deficiency is prevalent among the elderly and is a significant contributor to anemia in this population. As people age, the body&#x27;s ability to balance iron storage and supply diminishes, leading to this condition. Multiple factors contribute to iron deficiency in older adults, including reduced food intake, frequent medication use, gastrointestinal malabsorption, and occult bleeding. Malabsorption can also result in excessive iron accumulation, further complicating the issue. Age-related anemia may also be linked to increased levels of hepcidin, a hormone that reduces iron absorption in the intestine, leading to low iron levels.

The recommended daily intake of iron for both men and women is 8 mg, with an upper limit of 45 mg/day. According to the World Health Organization, hemoglobin levels below 12 g/dl in women and 13 mg/dl in men indicate anemia. The NHANES III survey found that anemia affects 10.2% of women and 11% of men over 65, with prevalence increasing with age. Low iron levels not only decrease quality of life but are also associated with depression, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and muscle wasting.

Dietary components significantly influence iron absorption; tannins and polyphenols in tea and coffee inhibit it, while Vitamin C enhances it. However, the interaction between iron and vitamin C can generate free radicals, particularly in cases of iron overload. In iron deficiency, vitamin C aids absorption. Aspirin use in the elderly, often for cardiovascular disease, is linked to lower serum ferritin levels. Iron deficiency can be managed through an iron-rich diet or supplementation. Severe iron deficiency anemia may require oral iron therapy, typically with 300 mg of ferrous sulfate containing 60 mg of elemental iron. For those who do not respond to oral treatment, intravenous iron infusion or iron chelation for iron overload may be necessary.

=== Clinical nutrition ===

On admission to intensive care unit, energy and protein requirements are calculated to determine the targets of nutritional therapy. Enteral nutrition (administering nutrition using a feeding tube) is started within 24 to 48 hours of admission with feeding targets increased every week. The risk of aspiration (inhalation of fluid or food particles while drinking or eating) can be reduced by elevating the head, using prokinetic agent, and using a chlorhexidine mouthwash. Although the presence of bowel sounds and the amount of gastric residual volume aspirated after feeding can be used to monitor the functionality of the gastrointestinal tract before feeding is started; starting nutritional therapy at this stage regardless of the functional status is feasible and safe within 36 to 48 hours of admission. Parenteral nutrition (administering of nutrition intravenously) should be started when enteral nutrition is not possible or sufficient or in high-risk subjects.

Before undergoing surgery, a subject should avoid long periods of fasting. Oral feeding should be established as soon as possible after surgery. Other aspects of nutrition such as control of glucose, reduction in risk factors that causes stress-related catabolism or impairment of gastrointestinal functions, and encourage early physical activity to encourage protein synthesis and muscle functions.

== History of human nutrition ==

Early human nutrition was largely determined by the availability and palatability of foods. Humans evolved as omnivorous hunter-gatherers, though the diet of humans has varied significantly depending on location and climate. The diet in the tropics tended to depend more heavily on plant foods, while the diet at higher latitudes tended more towards animal products. Analyses of postcranial and cranial remains of humans and animals from the Neolithic, along with detailed bone-modification studies, have shown that cannibalism also occurred among prehistoric humans.

Agriculture developed at different times in different places, starting about 11,500 years ago, providing some cultures with a more abundant supply of grains (such as wheat, rice and maize) and potatoes; and originating staples such as bread, pasta dough, and tortillas. The domestication of animals provided some cultures with milk and dairy products.

In 2020, archeological research discovered a frescoed thermopolium (a fast-food counter) in an exceptional state of preservation from 79 in Pompeii, including 2,000-year-old foods available in some of the deep terra cotta jars.

=== Nutrition in antiquity ===

During classical antiquity, diets consisted of simple fresh or preserved whole foods that were either locally grown or transported from neighboring areas during times of crisis.

=== 18th century until today: food processing and nutrition ===
Since the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th century, the food processing industry has invented many technologies that both help keep foods fresh longer and alter the fresh state of food as they appear in nature. Cooling and freezing are primary technologies used to maintain freshness, whereas many more technologies have been invented to allow foods to last longer without becoming spoiled. These latter technologies include pasteurisation, autoclavation, drying, salting, and separation of various components, all of which appearing to alter the original nutritional contents of food. Pasteurisation and autoclavation (heating techniques) have no doubt improved the safety of many common foods, preventing epidemics of bacterial infection.

Modern separation techniques such as milling, centrifugation, and pressing have enabled concentration of particular components of food, yielding flour, oils, juices, and so on, and even separate fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. Inevitably, such large-scale concentration changes the nutritional content of food, saving certain nutrients while removing others. Heating techniques may also reduce the content of many heat-labile nutrients such as certain vitamins and phytochemicals, and possibly other yet-to-be-discovered substances.

Because of reduced nutritional value, processed foods are often enriched or fortified with some of the most critical nutrients (usually certain vitamins) that were lost during processing. Nonetheless, processed foods tend to have an inferior nutritional profile compared to whole, fresh foods, regarding content of both sugar and high GI starches, potassium/sodium, vitamins, fiber, and of intact, unoxidized (essential) fatty acids. In addition, processed foods often contain potentially harmful substances such as oxidized fats and trans fatty acids.

A dramatic example of the effect of food processing on a population&#x27;s health is the history of epidemics of beri-beri in people subsisting on polished rice. Removing the outer layer of rice by polishing it removes with it the essential vitamin thiamine, causing beri-beri. Another example is the development of scurvy among infants in the late 19th century in the United States. It turned out that the vast majority of those affected were being fed milk that had been heat-treated (as suggested by Pasteur) to control bacterial disease. Pasteurisation was effective against bacteria, but it destroyed the vitamin C.

== Research of nutrition and nutritional science ==
=== Antiquity: Start of scientific research on nutrition ===

Around 3000 BC the Vedic texts made mention of scientific research on nutrition. The first recorded dietary advice, carved into a Babylonian stone tablet in about 2500 BC, cautioned those with pain inside to avoid eating onions for three days. Scurvy, later found to be a vitamin C deficiency, was first described in 1500 BC in the Ebers Papyrus.

According to Walter Gratzer, the study of nutrition probably began during the 6th century BC. In China, the concept of &quot;qi&quot; developed, a spirit or &quot;wind&quot; similar to what Western Europeans later called &quot;pneuma&quot;. Food was classified into &quot;hot&quot; (for example, meats, blood, ginger, and hot spices) and &quot;cold&quot; (green vegetables) in China, India, Malaya, and Persia. &quot;Humours&quot; developed perhaps first in China alongside &quot;qi&quot;. Ho the Physician concluded that diseases are caused by deficiencies of elements (Wu Xing: fire, water, earth, wood, and metal), and he classified diseases as well as prescribed diets. About the same time in Italy, Alcmaeon of Croton (a Greek) wrote of the importance of equilibrium between what goes in and what goes out, and warned that imbalance would result in disease marked by obesity or emaciation.

Around 475 BC, Anaxagoras wrote that food is absorbed by the human body and, therefore, contains &quot;homeomerics&quot; (generative components), suggesting the existence of nutrients. Around 400 BC, Hippocrates, who recognized and was concerned with obesity, which may have been common in southern Europe at the time, said, &quot;Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food.&quot; The works that are still attributed to him, &quot;Corpus Hippocraticum&quot;, called for moderation and emphasized exercise.

Salt, pepper and other spices were prescribed for various ailments in various preparations for example mixed with vinegar. In the 2nd century BC, Cato the Elder believed that cabbage (or the urine of cabbage-eaters) could cure digestive diseases, ulcers, warts, and intoxication. Living about the turn of the millennium, Aulus Celsus, an ancient Roman doctor, believed in &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; foods (bread for example was strong, as were older animals and vegetables).

The Book of Daniel, dated to the second century BC, contains a description of a comparison in health of captured people following Jewish dietary laws versus the diet of the soldiers of the king of Babylon. (The story may be legendary rather than historical.)

=== 1st to 17th century ===
Galen was physician to gladiators in Pergamon, and in Rome, physician to Marcus Aurelius and the three emperors who succeeded him.
In use from his life in the 1st century AD until the 17th century, it was heresy to disagree with the teachings of Galen for 1500 years. Most of Galen&#x27;s teachings were gathered and enhanced in the late 11th century by Benedictine monks at the School of Salerno in &quot;Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum&quot;, which still had users in the 17th century. Galen believed in the bodily &quot;humours&quot; of Hippocrates, and he taught that &quot;pneuma&quot; is the source of life. Four elements (earth, air, fire and water) combine into &quot;complexion&quot;, which combines into states (the four temperaments: sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic). The states are made up of pairs of attributes (hot and moist, cold and moist, hot and dry, and cold and dry), which are made of four humours: blood, phlegm, green (or yellow) bile, and black bile (the bodily form of the elements). Galen thought that for a person to have gout, kidney stones, or arthritis was scandalous, which Gratzer likens to Samuel Butler&#x27;s &quot;Erehwon&quot; (1872) where sickness is a crime.

In the 1500s, Paracelsus was probably the first to criticize Galen publicly. Also in the 16th century, scientist and artist Leonardo da Vinci compared metabolism to a burning candle. Leonardo did not publish his works on this subject, but he was not afraid of thinking for himself and he definitely disagreed with Galen. Ultimately, 16th century works of Andreas Vesalius, sometimes called the father of modern human anatomy, overturned Galen&#x27;s ideas. He was followed by piercing thought amalgamated with the era&#x27;s mysticism and religion sometimes fueled by the mechanics of Newton and Galileo. Jan Baptist van Helmont, who discovered several gases such as carbon dioxide, performed the first quantitative experiment. Robert Boyle advanced chemistry. Sanctorius measured body weight. Physician Herman Boerhaave modeled the digestive process. Physiologist Albrecht von Haller worked out the difference between nerves and muscles.

=== 18th and 19th century: Lind, Lavoisier and modern science ===

Sometimes forgotten during his life, James Lind, a physician in the British navy, performed the first scientific nutrition experiment in 1747. Lind discovered that lime juice saved sailors that had been at sea for years from scurvy, a deadly and painful bleeding disorder. Between 1500 and 1800, an estimated two million sailors had died of scurvy. The discovery was ignored for forty years, but after about 1850, British sailors became known as &quot;limeys&quot; due to the carrying and consumption of limes aboard ship. The essential vitamin C within citrus fruits would not be identified by scientists until 1932.
Around 1770, Antoine Lavoisier discovered the details of metabolism, demonstrating that the oxidation of food is the source of body heat. Called the most fundamental chemical discovery of the 18th century, Lavoisier discovered the principle of conservation of mass. His ideas made the phlogiston theory of combustion obsolete.

In 1790, George Fordyce recognized calcium as necessary for the survival of fowl. In the early 19th century, the elements carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen were recognized as the primary components of food, and methods to measure their proportions were developed.

In 1816, François Magendie discovered that dogs fed only carbohydrates (sugar), fat (olive oil), and water died evidently of starvation, but dogs also fed protein survived – identifying protein as an essential dietary component. William Prout in 1827 was the first person to divide foods into carbohydrates, fat, and protein. In 1840, Justus von Liebig discovered the chemical makeup of carbohydrates (sugars), fats (fatty acids) and proteins (amino acids). During the 19th century, Jean-Baptiste Dumas and von Liebig quarrelled over their shared belief that animals get their protein directly from plants (animal and plant protein are the same and that humans do not create organic compounds). With a reputation as the leading organic chemist of his day but with no credentials in animal physiology, von Liebig grew rich making food extracts like beef bouillon and infant formula that were later found to be of questionable nutritious value.

In the early 1880s, Kanehiro Takaki observed that Japanese sailors (whose diets consisted almost entirely of white rice) developed beriberi (or endemic neuritis, a disease causing heart problems and paralysis), but British sailors and Japanese naval officers did not. Adding various types of vegetables and meats to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease. (This was not because of the increased protein as Takaki supposed, but because it introduced a few parts per million of thiamine to the diet.)).
In the 1860s, Claude Bernard discovered that body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein, showing that the energy in blood glucose can be stored as fat or as glycogen.

In 1896, Eugen Baumann observed iodine in thyroid glands. In 1897, Christiaan Eijkman worked with natives of Java, who also had beriberi. Eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed the symptoms of beriberi but remained healthy when fed unprocessed brown rice with the outer bran intact. His assistant, Gerrit Grijns correctly identified and described the anti-beriberi substance in rice. Eijkman cured the natives by feeding them brown rice, discovering that food can cure disease. Over two decades later, nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin B1, also known as thiamine.

=== Early 20th century ===

In the early 20th century, Carl von Voit and Max Rubner independently measured caloric energy expenditure in different species of animals, applying principles of physics in nutrition. In 1906, Edith G. Willcock and Frederick Hopkins showed that the amino acid tryptophan aids the well-being of mice but it did not assure their growth. In the middle of twelve years of attempts to isolate them, Hopkins said in a 1906 lecture that &quot;unsuspected dietetic factors&quot;, other than calories, protein, and minerals, are needed to prevent deficiency diseases. In 1907, Stephen M. Babcock and Edwin B. Hart started the cow feeding, single-grain experiment, which took nearly four years to complete.

In 1912 Casimir Funk coined the term vitamin to label a vital factor in the diet: from the words &quot;vital&quot; and &quot;amine&quot;, because these unknown substances preventing scurvy, beriberi, and pellagra, and were thought then to derive from ammonia. In 1913 Elmer McCollum discovered the first vitamins, fat-soluble vitamin A and water-soluble vitamin B (in 1915; later identified as a complex of several water-soluble vitamins) and named vitamin C as the then-unknown substance preventing scurvy. Lafayette Mendel (1872–1935) and Thomas Osborne (1859–1929) also performed pioneering work on vitamins A and B.

In 1919, Sir Edward Mellanby incorrectly identified rickets as a vitamin A deficiency because he could cure it in dogs with cod liver oil. In 1922, McCollum destroyed the vitamin A in cod liver oil, but found that it still cured rickets. Also in 1922, H.M. Evans and L.S. Bishop discover vitamin E as essential for rat pregnancy, originally calling it &quot;food factor X&quot; until 1925.

In 1925 Hart discovered that iron absorption requires trace amounts of copper. In 1927 Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus synthesized vitamin D, for which he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1928. In 1928 Albert Szent-Györgyi isolated ascorbic acid, and in 1932 proved that it is vitamin C by preventing scurvy. In 1935 he synthesized it, and in 1937 won a Nobel Prize for his efforts. Szent-Györgyi concurrently elucidated much of the citric acid cycle.

In the 1930s, William Cumming Rose identified essential amino acids, necessary protein components that the body cannot synthesize. In 1935 Eric Underwood and Hedley Marston independently discovered the necessity of cobalt. In 1936, Eugene Floyd DuBois showed that work and school performance are related to caloric intake. In 1938, Erhard Fernholz discovered the chemical structure of vitamin E. It was synthesised the same year by Paul Karrer.

Oxford University closed down its nutrition department after World War II because the subject seemed to have been completed between 1912 and 1944.

=== Institutionalization of nutritional science in the 1950s ===

&quot;Nutritional science&quot; as a separate, independent science discipline was institutionalized in the 1950s. At the instigation of the British physiologist John Yudkin at the University of London, the degrees Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in nutritional science were established. The first students were admitted in 1953, and in 1954 the Department of Nutrition was officially opened. In Germany, institutionalization followed in November 1956, when Hans-Diedrich Cremer was appointed to the chair for human nutrition in Giessen. Over time, seven other universities with similar institutions followed in Germany. From the 1950s to 1970s, a focus of nutritional science was on dietary fat and sugar. From the 1970s to the 1990s, attention was put on diet-related chronic diseases and supplementation.

<text>Interstate 85 (I-85) is a major Interstate Highway in the Southeastern United States. Its southern terminus is at an interchange with I-65 in Montgomery, Alabama; its northern terminus is an interchange with I-95 in Petersburg, Virginia, near Richmond. It is nominally north–south as it carries an odd number, but it is physically oriented northeast–southwest and covers a larger east–west span than north–south. While most Interstates that end in a &quot;5&quot; are cross-country, I-85 is primarily a regional route serving five southeastern states: Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.

Major metropolitan areas served by I-85 include the Greater Richmond Region in Virginia, the Research Triangle, Piedmont Triad, and Charlotte metropolitan area regions of North Carolina, Upstate South Carolina, the Atlanta metropolitan area in Georgia, and the Montgomery metropolitan area in Alabama. There are plans to extend I-85 along the US Route 80 (US 80) corridor into Mississippi. Because of its unusually diagonal nature, portions of I-85 are to the west of I-75, which puts I-85 out of the Interstate grid.

I-85 is a route that serves several major locations in the Southeastern United States, stretching from Alabama to Virginia serving major metropolitan areas such as Atlanta and Charlotte.

===Alabama===

I-85 begins as a T intersection off I-65 in Montgomery. From there, I-85 parallels US 80 until the highway nears Tuskegee. At Tuskegee, I-85 leaves US 80 and starts to parallel US 29, which the highway parallels for much of its length.

I-85 also passes near Auburn, Opelika, Valley, and Lanett before crossing the Chattahoochee River into Georgia.

I-85 is planned to be rerouted southward just east of Montgomery, where it will intersect with I-65 just south of downtown Montgomery and then have a future southern terminus at the concurrency of I-20/I-59 just northeast of Cuba. Future I-685 will be the new designation for the route of current I-85, which leads directly to I-65 in downtown Montgomery.

=== Georgia ===

In Georgia, I-85 (unsigned State Route 403 [SR 403]) bypasses West Point before coming into the LaGrange area. East of LaGrange, I-85 intersects I-185 which connects to Columbus and Fort Moore. In the Atlanta area, I-85 intersects I-20 and merges with I-75 (Downtown Connector) through the downtown area. North of Atlanta, I-985 provides a link to Gainesville before I-85 continues through northeastern Georgia and then crosses into South Carolina.

===South Carolina===

I-85 provides the major transportation route for the Upstate of South Carolina, linking together the major centers of Greenville and Spartanburg with regional centers of importance. In Spartanburg, BMW has a major manufacturing plant that can be seen from the highway. In South Carolina, I-85 bypasses Clemson and Anderson on the way to Greenville. Beginning at Anderson, I-85 widens from four to six lanes. Near Powdersville, US 29 joins I-85 and they run concurrently until they cross the Saluda River. I-85 bypasses just south of Greenville but provides two links into the city via spur routes I-185 and I-385.

I-85 also has direct exits to Greenville–Spartanburg International Airport, which serves the Greenville–Spartanburg metropolitan area. I-85 then bypasses the city of Spartanburg to the north. Its original route is now signed as I-85 Business (I-85 Bus) and was approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) on April 22, 1995. Near milemarker 70, I-85 intersects with I-26. The exits are signed as exits 70A for eastbound traffic and 70B for westbound traffic. North of Spartanburg, I-85 narrows from six lanes back to four lanes and bypasses Gaffney. Much of the terrain between Spartanburg and the North Carolina border is rural in nature but congested to the state line due to its location near Charlotte.

===North Carolina===

In North Carolina, I-85 enters a relatively rural area near Kings Mountain before entering the Gastonia and Charlotte areas. In Charlotte, I-85 bypasses Charlotte Douglas International Airport and turns northeastward just before reaching Uptown Charlotte; thus, I-85 just bypasses uptown to the north where it junctions with I-77. North of Charlotte, the highway passes near Concord, Salisbury, Lexington, and High Point before reaching Greensboro.

At Greensboro, I-85 shifts away from downtown I-85 Bus (old I-85 through town). I-85 then joins I-40 east of downtown, and the two highways are cosigned as they pass through Burlington, Graham, and Mebane then separate near Hillsborough where I-40 turns toward Chapel Hill, Cary, and Raleigh. After the split with I-40, I-85 continues to Durham, before turning northeastward through Oxford then Henderson toward Virginia.

===Virginia===

Starting from the Virginia border, the route passes South Hill and McKenney before heading into a large forest. After the forest, I-85 reaches Petersburg and ends at I-95. The highway is briefly cosigned with US 460 from a few miles west of Petersburg in Dinwiddie County to I-95. I-85 follows the same general path as US 1 (Boydton Plank Road and Jefferson Davis Highway), as the two cross several times between the North Carolina border and the northern terminus outside Petersburg.
==History==

In the northern half of I-85, the route roughly parallels an ancient Indian trading path documented since colonial times from Petersburg, Virginia, to the Catawba Indian territory.

I-85 near Petersburg once formed the southern end of the Richmond–Petersburg Turnpike, which was completed in 1958. The tolls were removed in 1992 after I-295 was completed.

Before a 2010 decision to raise the speed limit in the state to , Virginia&#x27;s portion of I-85 was also the only Interstate Highway in the state with a posted speed limit greater than . It was raised from on July 1, 2006, by the state legislature.

In 2004, I-85 was rerouted around Greensboro; and it split with I-40 east of the original departure point. I-40 ran with I-85 along the bypass to the southern/western end and I-40 continued on a new freeway alignment at exit 121 until September 2008, when it was rerouted back to its old alignment through the city. Despite its reroute around Greensboro, the overall length for I-85 in North Carolina remains the same as before.
On the evening of March 30, 2017 a massive fire collapsed a bridge on I-85 in Atlanta. As a result, I-85 was closed to traffic for approximately between its split with I-75 and the interchange with SR 400.

==Future==
An extension of I-85 has been proposed west from Montgomery to intersect I-20/I-59 just east of the Mississippi–Alabama state line, where it will connect with I-20/I-59 near Cuba, Alabama. This extension will roughly follow the route of US 80, going through or bypassing Selma and Demopolis. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approved the alignment on February 17, 2011, after AASHTO approved at its Fall 2010 meeting in Biloxi, Mississippi. Also approved was the proposal to redesignate part of existing I-85 south and east of Montgomery to be bypassed as part of the extension of I-85 as I-685. Alabama has permission to cosign this part of I-85 as I-685 until the new alignment is built. This section is also envisioned by some as part of a proposed I-14. If this extension were to be completed, I-85 and I-20 would meet each other twice.

There are plans for I-85 from Anderson County to Spartanburg County, South Carolina, to become four to five lanes in each direction including high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes).

There are also plans in Georgia for I-85 to have three lanes in each direction from the state line in Hart County to meet up with the newly expanded portions just outside of the Atlanta metropolitan area in Jackson County.

<text>Agricultural biotechnology, also known as agritech, is an area of agricultural science involving the use of scientific tools and techniques, including genetic engineering, molecular markers, molecular diagnostics, vaccines, and tissue culture, to modify living organisms: plants, animals, and microorganisms. Crop biotechnology is one aspect of agricultural biotechnology which has been greatly developed upon in recent times. Desired trait are exported from a particular species of Crop to an entirely different species. These transgene crops possess desirable characteristics in terms of flavor, color of flowers, growth rate, size of harvested products and resistance to diseases and pests.

== History ==
Farmers have manipulated plants and animals through selective breeding for decades of thousands of years in order to create desired traits. In the 20th century, a surge in technology resulted in an increase in agricultural biotechnology through the selection of traits like the increased yield, pest resistance, drought resistance, and herbicide resistance. The first food product produced through biotechnology was sold in 1990, and by 2003, 7 million farmers were utilizing biotech crops. More than 85% of these farmers were located in developing countries.

== Crop modification techniques ==

=== Traditional breeding ===
Traditional crossbreeding has been used for centuries to improve crop quality and quantity. Crossbreeding mates two sexually compatible species to create a new and special variety with the desired traits of the parents. For example, the honeycrisp apple exhibits a specific texture and flavor due to the crossbreeding of its parents. In traditional practices, pollen from one plant is placed on the female part of another, which leads to a hybrid that contains genetic information from both parent plants. Plant breeders select the plants with the traits they&#x27;re looking to pass on and continue to breed those plants. Note that crossbreeding can only be utilized within the same or closely related species.

=== Mutagenesis ===
Mutations can occur randomly in the DNA of any organism. In order to create variety within crops, scientists can randomly induce mutations within plants. Mutagenesis uses radioactivity to induce random mutations in the hopes of stumbling upon the desired trait. Scientists can use mutating chemicals such as ethyl methanesulfonate, or radioactivity to create random mutations within the DNA. Atomic gardens are used to mutate crops. A radioactive core is located in the center of a circular garden and raised out of the ground to radiate the surrounding crops, generating mutations within a certain radius. Mutagenesis through radiation was the process used to produce ruby red grapefruits.

=== Polyploidy ===
Polyploidy can be induced to modify the number of chromosomes in a crop in order to influence its fertility or size. Usually, organisms have two sets of chromosomes, otherwise known as a diploidy. However, either naturally or through the use of chemicals, that number of chromosomes can change, resulting in fertility changes or size modification within the crop. Seedless watermelons are created in this manner; a 4-set chromosome watermelon is crossed with a 2-set chromosome watermelon to create a sterile (seedless) watermelon with three sets of chromosomes.

=== Protoplast fusion ===
Protoplast fusion is the joining of cells or cell components to transfer traits between species. For example, the trait of male sterility is transferred from radishes to red cabbages by protoplast fusion. This male sterility helps plant breeders make hybrid crops.

=== RNA interference ===
RNA interference (RNAIi) is the process in which a cell&#x27;s RNA to protein mechanism is turned down or off in order to suppress genes. This method of genetic modification works by interfering with messenger RNA to stop the synthesis of proteins, effectively silencing a gene.

=== Transgenics ===
Transgenics involves the insertion of one piece of DNA into another organism&#x27;s DNA in order to introduce new genes into the original organism. This addition of genes into an organism&#x27;s genetic material creates a new variety with desired traits. The DNA must be prepared and packaged in a test tube and then inserted into the new organism. New genetic information can be inserted with gene guns/biolistics. An example of a gene gun transgenic is the rainbow papaya, which is modified with a gene that gives it resistance to the papaya ringspot virus.

=== Genome editing ===
Genome editing is the use of an enzyme system to modify the DNA directly within the cell. Genome editing is used to develop herbicide resistant canola to help farmers control weeds.

== Improved nutritional content ==
Agricultural biotechnology has been used to improve the nutritional content of a variety of crops in an effort to meet the needs of an increasing population. Genetic engineering can produce crops with a higher concentration of vitamins. For example, golden rice contains three genes that allow plants to produce compounds that are converted to vitamin A in the human body. This nutritionally improved rice is designed to combat the world&#x27;s leading cause of blindness—vitamin A deficiency. Similarly, the Banana 21 project has worked to improve the nutrition in bananas to combat micronutrient deficiencies in Uganda. By genetically modifying bananas to contain vitamin A and iron, Banana 21 has helped foster a solution to micronutrient deficiencies through the vessel of a staple food and major starch source in Africa. Additionally, crops can be engineered to reduce toxicity or to produce varieties with removed allergens.

== Genes and traits of interest for crops ==

=== Agronomic traits ===

==== Insect resistance ====

One highly sought after trait is insect resistance. This trait increases a crop&#x27;s resistance to pests and allows for a higher yield. An example of this trait are crops that are genetically engineered to make insecticidal proteins originally discovered in (&quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot;). Bacillus thuringiensis is a bacterium that produces insect repelling proteins that are non-harmful to humans. The genes responsible for this insect resistance have been isolated and introduced into many crops. Bt corn and cotton are now commonplace, and cowpeas, sunflower, soybeans, tomatoes, tobacco, walnut, sugar cane, and rice are all being studied in relation to Bt.

==== Herbicide tolerance ====

Weeds have proven to be an issue for farmers for thousands of years; they compete for soil nutrients, water, and sunlight and prove deadly to crops. Biotechnology has offered a solution in the form of herbicide tolerance. Chemical herbicides are sprayed directly on plants in order to kill weeds and therefore competition, and herbicide resistant crops have to the opportunity to flourish.

==== Disease resistance ====

Often, crops are afflicted by disease spread through insects (like aphids). Spreading disease among crop plants is incredibly difficult to control and was previously only managed by completely removing the affected crop. The field of agricultural biotechnology offers a solution through genetically engineering virus resistance. Developing GE disease-resistant crops now include cassava, maize, and sweet potato.

==== Temperature tolerance ====

Agricultural biotechnology can also provide a solution for plants in extreme temperature conditions. In order to maximize yield and prevent crop death, genes can be engineered that help to regulate cold and heat tolerance. For example, tobacco plants have been genetically modified to be more tolerant to hot and cold conditions, with genes originally found in Carica papaya. Other traits include water use efficiency, nitrogen use efficiency and salt tolerance.

=== Quality traits ===
Quality traits include increased nutritional or dietary value, improved food processing and storage, or the elimination of toxins and allergens in crop plants.

== Common GMO crops ==
Currently, only a small number of genetically modified crops are available for purchase and consumption in the United States. The USDA has approved soybeans, corn, canola, sugar beets, papaya, squash, alfalfa, cotton, apples, and potatoes. GMO apples (arctic apples) are non-browning apples and eliminate the need for anti-browning treatments, reduce food waste, and bring out flavor. The production of Bt cotton has skyrocketed in India, with 10 million hectares planted for the first time in 2011, resulting in a 50% insecticide application reduction. In 2014, Indian and Chinese farmers planted more than 15 million hectares of Bt cotton.

== Safety testing and government regulations ==
Agricultural biotechnology regulation in the US falls under three main government agencies: The Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The USDA must approve the release of any new GMOs, EPA controls the regulation of insecticide, and the FDA evaluates the safety of a particular crop sent to market. On average, it takes nearly 13 years and $130 million of research and development for a genetically modified organism to come to market. The regulation process takes up to 8 years in the United States. The safety of GMOs has become a topic of debate worldwide, but scientific articles are being conducted to test the safety of consuming GMOs in addition to the FDA&#x27;s work. In one such article, it was concluded that Bt rice did not adversely affect digestion and did not induce horizontal gene transfer.

<doc id="93830" wikidata="Q94940" url="?curid=93830" title="Interstate 87 (New York)">
<text>Interstate 87 (I-87) is a north–south Interstate Highway located entirely within the US state of New York. I-87 is the main highway that connects New York City and Montreal. The highway begins at exit 47 off I-278 in the New York City borough of the Bronx, just north of the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge. From there, the route runs northward through the Hudson Valley, the Capital District, and the easternmost part of the North Country to the Canada–United States border in the town of Champlain. At its north end, I-87 continues into Quebec as Autoroute 15 (A-15). I-87 connects with several regionally important roads: I-95 in New York City, New York State Route 17 (NY 17; future I-86) near Harriman, I-84 near Newburgh, and I-90 in Albany. The highway is not contiguous with I-87 in North Carolina.

I-87 was assigned in 1957 as part of the establishment of the Interstate Highway System. The portion of I-87 south of Albany follows two controlled-access highways that predate the Interstate Highway designation, the Major Deegan Expressway (locally known as &quot;the Deegan&quot;) in New York City and the tolled New York State Thruway from the New York City line to Albany. North of Albany, I-87 follows the Adirondack Northway, a highway built in stages between 1957 and 1967 (finished just in time to bring Americans to the World Exhibition held in Montreal that year). Early proposals for I-87 called for the route to take a more easterly course through the Hudson Valley and extreme southwestern Connecticut between New York City and Newburgh. These plans were scrapped in 1970 when I-87 was realigned onto the Thruway between Westchester County and Newburgh.

==Route description==
I-87 makes up most of the major strategic corridor between New York City, the largest metropolitan area in the US, and Montreal, the second-largest metropolitan area in Canada (formerly the largest). The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) considers the route important for commerce, as it connects with numerous highways in the region and serves approximately 80 million people in the Mid-Atlantic states, New England, and Quebec. Motorists can connect to multiple highways to travel farther south along I-95 through the Mid-Atlantic states or farther east into New England.

===South of Albany===

====Major Deegan Expressway====
I-87 and the Major Deegan Expressway begins in the Bronx at the northern approach to the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, where it connects to the Bruckner Expressway (I-278) at a directional T interchange. The route heads west from the interchange, paralleling loosely with the Harlem River through Mott Haven. After , the highway makes a turn to the north, mirroring a change in the nearby river&#x27;s course. It passes by Yankee Stadium on its way to Highbridge, where the Deegan connects to the Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95 and US Route 1 [US 1]) at the eastern approach to the Alexander Hamilton Bridge. The Deegan remains in close proximity to the Harlem River until the waterway turns westward at Kingsbridge to form the northern edge of Manhattan.


North of Kingsbridge, the expressway follows a generally northeasterly alignment, passing through the center of Van Cortlandt Park as it connects to Mosholu Parkway and Jerome Avenue. Mosholu Parkway also links the Deegan to the Henry Hudson and Saw Mill River parkways, which run parallel to the Major Deegan Expressway through the western Bronx and Manhattan. Past Jerome Avenue, the freeway gains a pair of service roads and heads north to the New York City line, where it becomes the New York State Thruway as it passes into Westchester County. The last northbound exit on the Deegan connects to McLean Avenue, located north of the city line in Yonkers. The exit 14 ramp leads to the service road in the Bronx but does not meet McLean Avenue until it crosses the county line. Southbound access to McLean Avenue is provided by Thruway exit 1 in Yonkers.

====New York State Thruway====

At the New York City–Yonkers border, I-87&#x27;s mainline continues onto the New York State Thruway and northward through Yonkers and southern Westchester County. The first few exits serve various local streets, with exit 1 serving Hall Place, exit 2 providing access to Yonkers Raceway &amp; Empire City Casino and exit 3 serving the Cross County Shopping Center. At exit 4, I-87 connects to the Cross County Parkway, an east–west parkway providing access to the Saw Mill River, Bronx River, and Hutchinson River parkways. The north–south parkways and I-95 run parallel to the Thruway through Southern Westchester. The Bronx River parkway leaves to the northeast midway through Yonkers, while the Saw Mill and Sprain Brook parkways follow the Thruway out of the city.
All three highways take generally parallel tracks to Elmsford, where I-87 directly intersects the Saw Mill River Parkway at exit 7A. Not far to the north is exit 8, a semi-directional T interchange with I-287 (the Cross Westchester Expressway). I-287 joins the Thruway here, following I-87 west across the Hudson River into Rockland County on the Tappan Zee Bridge. I-87 and I-287 remain overlapped for through the densely populated southern portion of Rockland County, meeting the Palisades Interstate Parkway and the Garden State Parkway Connector, with the latter providing access to the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey. The Thruway continues generally westward to Suffern, where I-87 and I-287 split at a large semi-directional T interchange (exit 15) only about a half mile () from the New Jersey border. At this point, I-287 heads south into New Jersey while I-87 and the Thruway turn northward into the valley of the Ramapo River.
The Thruway continues north as a six-lane tollway through the river valley toward Harriman, where it encounters the Woodbury toll gantry, the southeastern end of the main line&#x27;s major closed toll system. The barrier is located on the mainline within exit 16 (NY 17), a trumpet interchange. Along with the mainline barrier in Harriman, a toll gantry exists on the exit 16 ramp midway between the Thruway and NY 17 exit 131 (NY 32). Now a completely tolled highway, the Thruway heads northward as it narrows to four lanes, roughly paralleling the Hudson River to the river&#x27;s west as it serves the city of Newburgh, village of New Paltz, and city of Kingston, indirectly connecting to the short I-587 in the latter.

Past Kingston, the highway runs closer to the river as it parallels US 9W through the towns of Saugerties, Catskill, Coxsackie, and Ravena. Just north of Ravena, the Thruway meets the west end of the Berkshire Connector, a spur linking the Thruway mainline to the Massachusetts Turnpike to the east. The highway continues into the vicinity of Albany, where it connects to Troy via I-787 at exit 23 and intersects I-90 at exit 24. The latter of the two junctions is the busiest of the Thruway&#x27;s exits, serving an estimated 27 million vehicles a year. I-87 then widens to six lanes and runs across the capital city&#x27;s residential suburbs for to exit 24, a complex interchange with I-90. At this point, I-87 leaves the Thruway to access the nearby south end of the toll-free Adirondack Northway, also known simply as the Northway, while I-90 merges in from the east to follow the Thruway toward Buffalo and then Pennsylvania.

===Adirondack Northway===
Off the Thruway, I-87 and I-90 overlap for a half mile () along I-90&#x27;s toll-free path through the Albany area. The brief concurrency ends at exit 1 of the Adirondack Northway in Guilderland, a junction also numbered as exit 1 on I-90. The Adirondack Northway and I-87 are still separate routes that share the same path; the Northway itself actually begins not at I-87/I-90 but about south from its interchange, the Northway reaches its southern terminus at Western Ave (US 20), and then joins with I-87 for the rest of its route. I-87 turns to head north toward the Canada–United States border at Champlain while I-90 continues east toward downtown Albany and Rensselaer County. South of this point, the Northway feeds into a expressway spur known locally as Fuller Road Alternate, which links I-87 and I-90 to US 20. Fuller Road Alternate is designated as New York State Route 910F (NY 910F), an unsigned reference route, by NYSDOT. In 2004, NYSDOT ceremonially designated the entire Northway as the Adirondack Veterans Memorial Highway.

The Northway, the part of Interstate 87 (I-87) north of the New York State Thruway, was built in segments, which became I-87 as they were completed and linked to the pre-existing route. Construction began in the late 1950s on the portion of the Northway between the Thruway and NY 7 near Latham, and it was completed in 1960. 

====Albany and Saratoga counties====
I-87 heads northeast from I-90 as a six-lane freeway with three lanes in each direction. It immediately traverses the Albany Pine Bush Preserve and passes west of Rensselaer Lake before crossing CSX Transportation&#x27;s Hudson Subdivision and running parallel to Wolf Road, a business thoroughfare through the town of Colonie. Wolf Road itself begins adjacent to exit 2, a cloverleaf interchange with NY 5 (Central Avenue). Heading northbound, the ramp for exit 2E feeds directly into the intersection of NY 5 and Wolf Road, located just west of Colonie Center, one of the Capital District&#x27;s largest enclosed shopping malls. I-87 continues to run alongside Wolf Road to exit 4, a modified diamond interchange serving County Route 151 (CR 151, named Albany Shaker Road) and Albany International Airport. Wolf Road ends south of the exit; however, another section begins north of the junction, carrying NY 155 away from the airport. Prior to the Northway, there was no break in Wolf Road; in essence, exit 4 was built on top of Wolf Road&#x27;s intersection with Albany Shaker Road. I-87 and NY 155 meet at exit 5, with the latter routed along Watervliet Shaker Road.
After a brief stretch of housing tracts, I-87 connects to NY 2 and NY 7 at exit 6, a single-point urban interchange, in a commercialized part of Latham. NY 7 joins I-87 here, following the freeway for roughly to exit 7, the west end of a limited-access highway previously known locally as Alternate Route 7. While NY 7 heads east toward Troy, I-87 continues north past gradually less commercialized areas as it approaches the northern county line. The businesses ultimately give way to stretches of homes and subdivisions as the highway crosses into Saratoga County by way of the Thaddeus Kosciusko Bridge, called by locals &quot;the twin bridges&quot;, spanning the Mohawk River. The northern portion of the Northway through Colonie and Saratoga County is now a heavily traveled commuter route as a six-lane freeway. Since the highway&#x27;s construction, Saratoga County has become the fastest growing area of the Capital District, and indeed all of upstate New York.

For its first few miles in Saratoga County, I-87 runs across lightly developed parts of the towns of Halfmoon and Clifton Park. Near exit 9, however, the freeway passes through the commercial center of Clifton Park as it connects to NY 146. Clifton Park Center, one of several shopping plazas at the junction, is situated southwest of the exit. Past exit 9, the commercial development subsides as I-87 traverses another area dominated by housing tracts. Just north of the exit, the freeway passes a rest area for northbound traffic. The freeway continues on, passing to the west of the centers of Round Lake at exit 11 and Malta at exit 12. The roadway then meets US 9 at Exit 13, a cloverleaf interchange providing access to Saratoga Spa State Park and downtown Saratoga Springs. I-87 turns slightly to the northeast and begins to loosely parallel the northwestern edge of Saratoga Lake as it crosses Kayaderosseras Creek and enters Saratoga Springs.

As the route travels the east side of Saratoga Springs, it meets NY 9P at exit 14. The junction is adjacent to the regionally popular Saratoga Race Course and thus receives heavy traffic during the racing season. A southbound-only entrance ramp exists off Nelson Avenue Extension about south of exit 14, designed to handle traffic exiting the track at Saratoga Race Course and the Saratoga Casino Hotel. The highway continues around the eastern edge of Saratoga Springs to exit 15, where the relatively undeveloped areas east of I-87 are briefly replaced by Wilton&#x27;s commercial district along NY 50. As I-87 continues northeast through Wilton, it heads across significantly less developed areas, with open fields becoming the most common feature along the road. It continues into Moreau, connecting to US 9 and serving Moreau Lake State Park by way of exit 17, a once cloverleaf interchange being converted to a &quot;Parclo A2&quot; Partial cloverleaf interchange, before crossing the Hudson River and entering Warren County.

====Warren and Essex counties====

Between the bridge and exit 18, I-87 passes two rest areas, one for each direction. The road&#x27;s northward course quickly brings it to the outskirts of Glens Falls, and as such the highway heads across another swath of residential neighborhoods. Exits 18 and 19 are the main exits for the city, with the latter connecting to NY 254 near Aviation Mall, located on NY 254 just west of the route&#x27;s junction with US 9. A northwestern turn in the freeway takes I-87 past the Great Escape amusement park and lodge, both of which are accessed from exit 20 and NY 149. Past exit 20, I-87 runs across increasingly remote areas of Queensbury as the road enters Adirondack Park and heads toward Lake George. The freeway closely follows US 9 northwest to the village of Lake George, where I-87 meets NY 9N via exits 21 and 22. Route 9N veers to the northeast along the shore of Lake George as &quot;Lake Shore Drive&quot;, toward the town of Bolton Landing, a popular village on the shore of Lake George with shops and restaurants. Exit 22 is the last exit before the Northway begins traversing approximately of mostly rural areas where the exits become farther apart. Here, the Northway narrows from six to four lanes, preparing for the more rural areas and rugged terrain that follow.

North of Lake George, the Northway runs alongside US 9 to Warrensburg, a small town on the Schroon River served by exit 23. The view straight ahead on the northbound side from this interchange acts as an unofficial gateway to the Adirondacks, with tall mountains acting as a backdrop to a straight stretch of highway. While US 9 heads northwest into the Warrensburg to connect to NY 28, I-87 turns northward to follow the east bank of the Schroon River for through a deep, remote valley. The Northway reaches exit 24 while in this valley, which once again serves the town of Bolton Landing. Exit 25 serves NY 8 at a diamond interchange. The stretch away from US 9 ends at exit 26, where I-87 reconnects to US 9 in Pottersville. At this point, I-87 makes a slight turn to the northeast to follow US 9 as the latter road runs along the western shoreline of Schroon Lake. Both roads pass a handful of lakefront properties on their way into Essex County and the town of Schroon Lake, where the lake comes to an end and NY 74 begins its eastward trek to Ticonderoga at exit 28. The Schroon River resumes north of the exit, and I-87 and US 9 follow the river and its rural valley to the northeast for to the town of North Hudson.

In North Hudson, the valley becomes less pronounced as the Schroon River reaches its source near exit 30. Here, US 9 and I-87 cross paths again, with the former heading northwest toward Keene and the latter continuing northeast in a narrow valley formed by Ash Craft Brook. After , the stream reaches its source at Lincoln Pond, leaving the Northway to climb in elevation and wind its way northeastward across the surrounding mountains. It reaches slightly more level ground in Westport, where I-87 connects to NY 9N at exit 31. From here, the highway takes a generally northerly track across the Boquet River to the town of Lewis, rejoining US 9 as both roads head toward Clinton County. They split again after as US 9 veers more easterly than I-87 to serve Keeseville. The Northway, meanwhile, heads to the northwest, bypassing the village to cross the Ausable River and enter Clinton County.

====Clinton County====
Just across the county line, I-87 intersects NY 9N again at exit 34 in Keeseville, finally leaving the more rural, mountainous areas of the Adirondack Mountains and entering a more populated region. Exit 34 is the southernmost junction to feature bilingual guide signs in English and French due to the road&#x27;s proximity to Quebec. Beyond NY 9N, the Northway curves to the north, running along the west side of Keeseville before entering another rural but fairly level stretch that follows I-87 out of Adirondack Park. Now outside the park, the highway encounters more frequent pockets of development as it follows NY 22 into the town of Plattsburgh. Just inside the town line, the Northway crosses over the Salmon River and intersects NY 22 at exit 36, a junction serving nearby Plattsburgh International Airport. While NY 22 heads northeast into the city of Plattsburgh, I-87 runs north through its western suburbs, passing over the Saranac River and intersecting NY 3 at exit 37. The Northway and NY 22 meet again north of downtown at exit 38.
The section of I-87 between exits 38 and 39 crosses a marshy area surrounding Dead Creek, a stream feeding into nearby Plattsburgh Bay. Access to the bay shore is provided off to the northeast by exit 39, a modified cloverleaf interchange for NY 314. Continuing away from the junction, I-87 comes within of Lake Champlain as it follows US 9 away from Plattsburgh and northward across open, rolling fields in the towns of Beekmantown and Chazy. Outside of the hamlet of Chazy, the Northway begins to run across a series of wetlands along the west side of US 9. The marshy terrain follows I-87 into the town of Champlain, where I-87 encounters the northernmost community along its course, the village of Champlain. I-87 veers slightly westward to avoid the village, and in doing so it meets US 11 at exit 42, a diamond interchange just west of the village limits.

I-87 takes a northerly track from US 11, crossing the Chazy River and briefly entering the village limits, where it runs past a series of homes and businesses built up along nearby US 9. As both roads head north out of the village, US 9 connects to the Northway one last time (also the northern terminus of US 9) at exit 43, the last interchange on I-87 before the Canada–United States border. Past the exit, the highway doubles in width, becoming eight lanes wide as it begins to run past the customs facilities on the American side of the border. The Northway and I-87 end shortly thereafter at the Canada–United States border, where the highway continues past the Champlain–St. Bernard de Lacolle Border Crossing into Quebec as A-15 toward Montreal.

==History==

===Designation and early construction===

The origins of the Major Deegan Expressway date back to 1936 when the Regional Plan Association concluded that in order to relieve New York City&#x27;s traffic problems, a limited-access, truck-accessible expressway should be built on the west side of the Bronx. This route would connect the brand-new Triborough Bridge to the proposed New York State Thruway in Westchester County. A section of the expressway from the bridge to the Grand Concourse was completed in April 1939. The highway was adorned with Whitestone-style light posts placed every of the six-lane highway, each of which were in width. The expressway was designated as New York State Route 1B (NY 1B) ; however, the designation was removed by 1947. In 1945, public works planner Robert Moses proposed extending the highway to the proposed Thruway. Construction on the extension began in 1950, and the new route was opened in 1956. The Major Deegan Expressway is named for William Francis Deegan, who died in 1932. He was an architect, a major in the Army Corps of Engineers, and a Democratic political leader in New York City.

I-87 was assigned on August 14, 1957, as part of the establishment of the Interstate Highway System. The highway initially utilized the preexisting New York State Thruway from Albany to Newburgh and in lower Westchester County, and the Major Deegan Expressway in New York City. From Newburgh to the Elmsford area, I-87 was to follow a new highway running parallel to US 9 northward along the eastern bank of the Hudson River to Fishkill. I-87 would then have followed the proposed I-84 across the Hudson to rejoin the Thruway outside of Newburgh. After the Hudson River Expressway proposal was cancelled in the 1960s, the alignment of I-87 was shifted farther east to follow a newly completed freeway in the Route 22 corridor that started at I-287 in White Plains, then cut north through the extreme southwest corner of Connecticut before reentering New York and reaching I-84 at Brewster. I-87 then followed I-84 west to Newburgh. In 1970, the I-87 designation was shifted to the New York State Thruway between Newburgh and the Deegan Expressway; its previous alignment between Brewster and White Plains was redesignated as I-684. Meanwhile, all of the Adirondack Northway, the portion of I-87 slated to extend from Albany north to the Canada–United States border, had yet to be built. Fuller Road Alternate, the spur leading south from the Adirondack Northway to US 20, was originally intended to be part of the Southern Albany Expressway, a proposed highway which would have connected the Northway with I-787 and run parallel to the Thruway between exits 23 and 24.

 &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Interstate 87 (New York) Reference Routes.map&quot;
&lt;/mapframe&gt;
The Northway was built in segments, which became I-87 as they were completed and linked to the preexisting route. Construction began in the late 1950s on the portion of the Northway between the Thruway and NY 7 near Latham. This segment was open to traffic by 1960, by which time work had begun on two additional segments from Latham to Malta (at NY 67) and from US 9 in northern Saratoga County to US 9 and NY 149 midway between Glens Falls and Lake George village. The expressway was completed between Latham and Clifton Park (NY 146) and from US 9 south of Glens Falls to the Hudson River . The US 9–NY 149 section of the highway was finished on May 26, 1961, at a total cost of $9.5 million (equivalent to $ in ). Work on the Latham–Malta segment concluded on November 22 of that year with the opening of a $6.6-million (equivalent to $ in ) piece between NY 146 and NY 67. When the Latham–Malta segment was opened, it featured one of the few railroad grade crossings on an Interstate Highway, just south of the Thaddeus Kosciusko Bridge over the Mohawk River. This at-grade crossing was removed within a couple of years when the railroad line was cut backward and the crossing was no longer needed. Construction on the portion of highway between the two segments began . The part between NY 9P and NY 50 near Saratoga Springs was finished on July 19, 1963, and the entire NY 67–US 9 segment was completed by 1964. An extension linking NY 149 to NY 9N south of Lake George village opened in mid-1963.

By July 1963, the Northway was completed from the Canada–United States border south to exit 34 at Keeseville. Additionally, the existing Albany–Lake George section was extended slightly by May 1966 to serve the northern part of Lake George. At the time, I-87 curved around the western outskirts of the village to end at NY 9N north of the village on a highway built . In mid-1966, the state opened a $23-million (equivalent to $ in ) section of the Northway between Lake George and exit 26 at Pottersville. I-87 was reconfigured slightly near Lake George as a result: instead of heading east to NY 9N, it continued north on a parallel routing to US 9. The Northway&#x27;s former routing to NY 9N, known infrequently today as the Lake George Connector, is now NY 912Q, an unsigned reference route in length. NY 912Q has one intermediate interchange with US 9. On March 5, 1967, the Lake George–Pottersville portion of I-87 was chosen as America&#x27;s Most Scenic New Highway of 1966 by &quot;Parade&quot;. It became the second New York highway to win the award, as a stretch of NY 17 in Broome and Delaware counties was selected for the title in 1964.

===Filling the gaps===
The gap in the Northway between Pottersville and Keeseville was narrowed considerably by July 1967 with the completion of a segment from Pottersville to exit 30 at Underwood. It was closed further on July 25, 1967, with the opening of a stretch near Keeseville between exits 34 and 33. The last section of the Northway to be built, a stretch between Underwood and Keeseville (exit 33), was finished on August 31, 1967. The completion of the Northway linked New York City with Montreal by way of a direct, limited-access highway, with I-87 becoming A-15 at the Canada–United States border. The total cost to build the Adirondack Northway was $208 million (equivalent to $ in ).

Another gap in I-87 existed in downstate New York, as the plan to build I-87 along the proposed Hudson River Expressway had been scrapped by 1962. Instead, I-87 was now proposed to begin in Port Chester and follow a new routing through Purchase, Armonk, and Katonah to Brewster, where it would join I-84. The routing was modified slightly by 1968: I-87 still began in New York City, then overlapped with I-287 east to Purchase. From there, I-87 headed north along the now-open expressway to Armonk, where it ended at NY 22. Another portion of the highway, from Goldens Bridge (NY 138) to Brewster, was open as well while the part from Armonk to Katonah was under construction. This segment, as well as the part from Katonah to Goldens Bridge, was completed by 1971. On January 1, 1970, I-87 was rerouted between Elmsford and Newburgh to follow the mainline of the Thruway instead, leaving the Purchase–Brewster freeway to become I-684.

===Tappan Zee Bridge replacement===

 The original Tappan Zee Bridge, carrying the concurrency of New York State Thruway, I-87, and I-287, was a cantilever bridge built during 1952–55. The bridge was long and spanned the Hudson at its second-widest point. Before its replacement in 2017, the deteriorating structure carried an average of 138,000 vehicles per day, substantially more traffic than its designed capacity. During its first decade, the bridge carried fewer than 40,000 vehicles per day. Part of the justification for replacing the bridge stems from its construction immediately following the Korean War on a low budget of only $81 million (equivalent to $ in ). Unlike other major bridges in New York metropolitan area, the Tappan Zee was designed to last only 50 years. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) issued a report in October 2011 designating the Tappan Zee&#x27;s replacement to be a dual-span twin bridge.

Construction officially began in October 2013, with the new spans being built to the north of the existing bridge. The new bridge connects to the existing highway approaches of I-87 and I-287 on both river banks. The northbound/westbound span opened on August 25, 2017. Southbound/eastbound traffic remained on the old bridge until October 6, 2017. At that point, southbound/eastbound traffic shifted to the westbound span of the new bridge and the old bridge closed.&lt;ref name=&quot;S/E traffic shifted&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge&#x27;s eastbound span opened to traffic on September 11, 2018. Upon completion, the new Tappan Zee Bridge became one of the longest cable-stayed spans in the nation.

In June 2017, the Tappan Zee Bridge was renamed the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge. The renaming resulted in controversy from the public who wanted to keep the name to honor Tappan Indians and Dutch who previously resided in the area. In August 2019, some signs for the bridge were replaced because they did not include the governor&#x27;s middle initial in the name.

===Other developments===

In the wake of former New York Yankees player Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s death on March 8, 1999, Governor George Pataki proposed renaming the Deegan Expressway to the &quot;Joe DiMaggio Highway.&quot; However, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani favored renaming the West Side Highway for DiMaggio instead. Pataki agreed to Giuliani&#x27;s proposal one week later.

A long stretch of the Northway through the Adirondack Park had been an unserved zone for cellular telephone service. In 2007, a driver who crashed off the road was unable to summon help, prompting messages from local governments to telephone companies to add new wireless towers to address the problem and warning signs to inform travelers of the so-called &quot;dark zone&quot;. Throughout this area, roadside emergency call boxes were located approximately every on both sides of the roadway. These boxes used a two-way ultra high frequency radio network to connect directly to New York State Police dispatchers. In February 2023, the New York State police announced that the call box system was being decommissioned and would be removed complete by Fall 2023. The first of 13 new cellular phone towers along I-87 was installed in October 2008. A second cellular phone tower was completed just one month later.

Exit 6 on the Adirondack Northway was originally a diamond interchange. Construction to convert the junction into a single-point urban interchange began in mid-2008 and was completed on September 12, 2010. The total cost of the project was $41.9 million (equivalent to $ in ).

==== Albany Airport Connector ====

Until October 2019, there was no exit 3 on the Northway section of I-87, as this number was reserved for an interchange with the now-canceled I-687. A project to improve motorist access to the Albany International Airport at exit 4 took place in the late 2010s. The two old deteriorating bridges at exit 4 which had carried 102,000 vehicles a day were replaced. Once the new replacement bridges were built, the old bridges were demolished. Construction began in February 2015 and was completed on October 31, 2015.

In August 2018, plans were announced to build a new exit 3 on the Northway, providing more direct access from both directions to Albany International Airport. The project was completed by Lancaster Development and Tully Construction at a cost of $50 million, with a target completion date of mid-2020. As part of the interchange, a flyover ramp was constructed over the Northway, allowing northbound and traffic direct access to Albany Shaker Road/NY 155 near the Desmond Hotel Albany. Southbound traffic was able to both exit and enter to/from the connector.

The southbound entrance for the connector (exit 3) opened on September 27, 2019, while the southbound exit opened the next month. Traffic signals were installed at the intersection of Albany Shaker Road and the connector. The northbound exit opened in November 2019. Other changes completed as part of the project include:
* Exit 4 on I-87 northbound was changed to a right turn only onto Wolf Road.
* Exit 4 on I-87 southbound was changed to a right turn only onto Old Wolf Road.
* A new direct entrance ramp was built from exit 5 (Watervliet-Shaker Road/NY 155) to I-87 southbound.
* Turn lanes, sidewalks, and medians were added to Albany Shaker Road between the intersections with the flyover ramps and Wolf Road. A new shared use path was built along Albany Shaker Road between the intersections with the flyover ramps and Albany International Airport.
* A new noise wall along I-87 northbound was built between exits 4 and 5.

Afternoon traffic was expected to be reduced by 54 percent, and morning traffic was expected to decrease by 29 percent. During construction, the project received criticism over the fact that some of the ramps were built on sacred Indian land. Murals were supposed to be installed on the exit 3 overpass, but the murals had still not been installed after the completion of all work on exit 3 in late 2020. The murals were finally installed in early 2021.

==Exit list==
The mileposts below follow actual signage, even though the route is continuous. For the Bronx section of I-87, mile 0.00 is just north of the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge. For the Thruway section of I-87, mile 0.00 is at the Yonkers–Bronx city line. For the Northway section of I-87, mile 0.00 is just north of the overpass with I-90.











































===Northway Stub (Fuller Road Alternate)===



===Lake George Spur===


==Auxiliary routes==

The road has three current spur routes, all located along the Thruway portion of I-87. I-287 serves as a bypass around New York City, beginning at the New Jersey Turnpike in Middlesex County, New Jersey, and ending at I-95 (the New England Thruway) near the Connecticut border in Rye. I-287 and I-87 overlap for across Westchester and Rockland counties. East of the concurrency, I-287 is known as the Cross Westchester Expressway (it was originally designated as I-187 and I-487). The other two spurs, the I-587 and the I-787, link I-87 to the cities of Kingston and Albany, respectively.

Two other spurs of I-87 were planned but never constructed, with no plans to sign them in the near future. In the Hudson Valley, I-487 would have run along the Hudson River from I-87 and I-287 in Tarrytown to I-84 east of Beacon. The other spur, I-687, would have connected I-90 in Albany to I-87 near Albany International Airport in Colonie. Both routes were canceled in the 1970s as a result of public opposition. Part of what would have been I-487 is now the Croton Expressway, which is part of US 9, and part of what would have been I-687 is now the Albany Airport Connector, which provides direct access between the Northway (I-87) and Albany International Airport.

<doc id="93831" wikidata="Q905161" url="?curid=93831" title="Roundup (herbicide)">
<text>Roundup is a brand name of herbicide originally produced by Monsanto, which Bayer acquired in 2018. Prior to the late-2010s formulations, it used broad-spectrum glyphosate-based herbicides. As of 2009, sales of Roundup herbicides still represented about 10 percent of Monsanto&#x27;s revenue despite competition from Chinese producers of other glyphosate-based herbicides. The overall Roundup line of products represented about half of Monsanto&#x27;s yearly revenue in 2009. The product is marketed to consumers by Scotts Miracle-Gro Company. In the late-2010s other non-glyphosate containing herbicides were also sold under the Roundup brand.

Monsanto patented the herbicidal use of glyphosate and derivatives in 1971. Commercial sale and usage in significant quantities started in 1974. It retained exclusive rights to glyphosate in the US until its US patent expired in September 2000; in other countries the patent expired earlier. The Roundup trademark is registered with the US Patent and Trademark Office and still extant. However, glyphosate is no longer under patent, so similar products use it as an active ingredient.

The main active ingredient of Roundup is the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate. Another ingredient of Roundup is the surfactant POEA (polyethoxylated tallow amine).

Monsanto also produced seeds which grow into plants genetically engineered to be tolerant to glyphosate, which are known as &quot;Roundup Ready&quot; crops. The genes contained in these seeds are patented. Such crops allow farmers to use glyphosate as a post-emergence herbicide against most broadleaf and cereal weeds.

The health impacts of the product as well as its effects on the environment have been at the center of substantial legal and scientific controversies. In June 2020, Bayer agreed to pay $9.6 billion to settle tens of thousands of claims, mostly alleging that glyphosate-based Roundup had caused cancer.

==Composition==
Glyphosate-based formulations may contain a number of adjuvants, the identities of which may be proprietary. Surfactants are used in herbicide formulations as wetting agents, to maximize coverage and aid penetration of the herbicide(s) through plant leaves. As agricultural spray adjuvants, surfactants may be pre-mixed into commercial formulations or they may be purchased separately and mixed on-site.

Polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA) is a surfactant used in the original Roundup formulation and was commonly used in 2015. Different versions of Roundup have included different percentages of POEA. A 1997 US government report said that Roundup is 15% POEA while Roundup Pro is 14.5%. Since POEA is more toxic to fish and amphibians than glyphosate alone, POEA is not allowed in aquatic formulations.

Non-glyphosate formulations of Roundup are typically used for lawns that glyphosate would otherwise kill. Both type of products being sold under the Roundup brand name can be a source of confusion for consumers. Active ingredients for non-glyphosate formulations of Roundup can include MCPA, quinclorac, dicamba, and sulfentrazone, penoxsulam, and 2,4-D

==Acute toxicity==
The lethal dose of different glyphosate-based formulations varies, especially with respect to the surfactants used. Formulations intended for terrestrial use that include the surfactant polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA) can be more toxic than other formulations for aquatic species. Due to the variety in available formulations, including five different glyphosate salts and different combinations of inert ingredients, it is difficult to determine how much surfactants contribute to the overall toxicity of each formulation. Independent scientific reviews and regulatory agencies have repeatedly concluded that glyphosate-based herbicides do not lead to a significant risk for human or environmental health when the product label is properly followed.

===Human===
The acute oral toxicity for mammals is low, but death has been reported after deliberate overdose of concentrated Roundup. The surfactants in glyphosate formulations can increase the relative acute toxicity of the formulation. Surfactants generally do not, however, cause synergistic effects (as opposed to additive effects) that increase the acute toxicity of glyphosate within a formulation. The surfactant POEA is not considered an acute toxicity hazard, and has an oral toxicity similar to vitamin A and less toxic than aspirin. Deliberate ingestion of Roundup ranging from 85 to 200 ml (of 41% solution) has resulted in death within hours of ingestion, although it has also been ingested in quantities as large as 500 ml with only mild or moderate symptoms. Consumption of over 85 ml of concentrated product is likely to cause serious symptoms in adults, including burns due to corrosive effects as well as kidney and liver damage. More severe cases lead to &quot;respiratory distress, impaired consciousness, pulmonary edema, infiltration on chest X-ray, shock, arrhythmias, kidney failure requiring haemodialysis, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalaemia&quot; and death is often preceded by bradycardia and ventricular arrhythmias.

Skin exposure can cause irritation, and photocontact dermatitis has been occasionally reported. Severe skin burns are very rare. In a 2017 risk assessment, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) wrote: &quot;There is very limited information on skin irritation in humans. Where skin irritation has been reported, it is unclear whether it is related to glyphosate or co-formulants in glyphosate-containing herbicide formulations.&quot; The ECHA concluded that available human data was insufficient to support classification for skin corrosion or irritation.

Inhalation is a minor route of exposure, but spray mist may cause oral or nasal discomfort, an unpleasant taste in the mouth, or tingling and irritation in the throat. Eye exposure may lead to mild conjunctivitis. Superficial corneal injury is possible if irrigation is delayed or inadequate.

===Aquatic===
Glyphosate formulations with POEA, such as Roundup, are not approved for aquatic use due to aquatic organism toxicity. Due to the presence of POEA, glyphosate formulations only allowed for terrestrial use are more toxic for amphibians and fish than glyphosate alone. Terrestrial glyphosate formulations that include the surfactants POEA and MON 0818 (75% POEA) may have negative impacts on various aquatic organisms like protozoa, mussels, crustaceans, frogs and fish. Aquatic organism exposure risk to terrestrial formulations with POEA is limited to drift or temporary water pockets. While laboratory studies can show effects of glyphosate formulations on aquatic organisms, similar observations rarely occur in the field when instructions on the herbicide label are followed.

Studies in a variety of amphibians have shown the toxicity of products containing POEA to amphibian larvae. These effects include interference with gill morphology and mortality from either the loss of osmotic stability or asphyxiation. At sub-lethal concentrations, exposure to POEA or glyphosate/POEA formulations have been associated with delayed development, accelerated development, reduced size at metamorphosis, developmental malformations of the tail, mouth, eye and head, histological indications of intersex and symptoms of oxidative stress. Glyphosate-based formulations can cause oxidative stress in bullfrog tadpoles. The use of glyphosate-based pesticides are not considered the major cause of amphibian decline, the bulk of which occurred prior to widespread use of glyphosate or in pristine tropical areas with minimal glyphosate exposure.

A 2000 review of the toxicological data on Roundup concluded that &quot;for terrestrial uses of Roundup minimal acute and chronic risk was predicted for potentially exposed nontarget organisms&quot;. It also concluded that there were some risks to aquatic organisms exposed to Roundup in shallow water.

===Bees===
Roundup Ready‐To‐Use, Roundup No Glyphosate, and Roundup ProActive have all been found to cause significant mortality in bumblebees when sprayed directly on them. It has been hypothesized that this is due to surfactants in the formulations blocking the tracheal system of the bees.

==Carcinogenicity==
There is limited evidence that human cancer risk might increase as a result of occupational exposure to large amounts of glyphosate, such as agricultural work, but no good evidence of such a risk from home use, such as in domestic gardening. The consensus among national pesticide regulatory agencies and scientific organizations is that labeled uses of glyphosate have demonstrated no evidence of human carcinogenicity. Organizations such as the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues and the European Commission, Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency, and the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment have concluded that there is no evidence that glyphosate poses a carcinogenic or genotoxic risk to humans. The final assessment of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority in 2017 was that &quot;glyphosate does not pose a carcinogenic risk to humans&quot;. The EPA has evaluated the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate multiple times since 1986. In 1986, glyphosate was initially classified as Group C: &quot;Possible Human Carcinogen&quot;, but later recommended as Group D: &quot;Not Classifiable as to Human Carcinogenicity&quot; due to lack of statistical significance in previously examined rat tumor studies. In 1991, it was classified as Group E: &quot;Evidence of Non-Carcinogenicity for Humans&quot;, and in 2015 and 2017, &quot;Not Likely to be Carcinogenic to Humans&quot;.

One international scientific organization, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), classified glyphosate in Group 2A, &quot;probably carcinogenic to humans&quot; in 2015. The variation in classification between this agency and others has been attributed to &quot;use of different data sets&quot; and &quot;methodological differences in the evaluation of the available evidence&quot;. In 2017, California environmental regulators listed glyphosate as “known to the state to cause cancer.” The state&#x27;s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment made the decision based in part on the report from the IARC. State Proposition 65 requires the state office to add substances the international agency deems carcinogenic in humans or laboratory animals to a state list of cancer-causing items.

==Legal==

In the ten months following Bayer&#x27;s June 2018 acquisition of Monsanto, its stock lost 46% of its value because of investor apprehension concerning the 11,200 lawsuits filed against its subsidiary. As of 2023, around 165,000 claims have been made against Bayer, mostly alleging that Roundup had caused cancer. Bayer has settled tens of thousands of those claims and has agreed to pay billions in damages, but, as of 2023, more than 50,000 similar claims were still pending. In December 2023, Bayer won a case against a claim that Roundup had caused a man&#x27;s cancer. In a statement they said the outcome was &quot;consistent with the evidence in this case that Roundup does not cause cancer and is not responsible for the plaintiff&#x27;s illness&quot;. At that time, Bayer had previously won 10 of 15 such cases.

Most cases claiming injury from Roundup are based on a failure-to-warn theory of liability, meaning Monsanto is liable for a plaintiff&#x27;s injury because it failed to warn the plaintiff that Roundup can cause cancer. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 2021, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in early 2024, held that such state-law failure to warn claims were not preempted by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (&quot;FIFRA&quot;). In August 2024, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that FIFRA does preempt state-law failure to warn claims involving Roundup, expressly recognizing that its holding conflicts with that of the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits. This conflict among the Third, Ninth and Eleventh Circuit creates a heightened potential that the United States Supreme Court will review the Third Circuit&#x27;s decision so that the Supreme Court can resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals.

===Cancer cases===
As of October 30, 2019, there were over 42,000 plaintiffs who said that glyphosate herbicides caused their cancer. After the IARC classified glyphosate as &quot;probably carcinogenic to humans&quot; in March 2015, many state and federal lawsuits were filed in the United States. Early on, over 300 of them were consolidated into a multidistrict litigation called &quot;In re: RoundUp Products Liability&quot;.

On August 10, 2018, Dewayne Johnson, who has non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, was awarded $289 million in damages (later cut to $78 million on appeal then reduced to $21 million after another appeal) after a jury in San Francisco found that Monsanto had failed to adequately warn consumers of cancer risks posed by the herbicide. Johnson had routinely used two different glyphosate formulations in his work as a groundskeeper, RoundUp and another Monsanto product called Ranger Pro. The jury&#x27;s verdict addressed the question of whether Monsanto knowingly failed to warn consumers that RoundUp could be harmful, but not whether RoundUp causes cancer. Court documents from the case alleged the company&#x27;s efforts to influence scientific research via ghostwriting.

In January 2019, Costco decided to stop carrying Roundup or other glyphosate-based herbicides. The decision was reportedly influenced in part by the public court cases.

In March 2019, a man was awarded $80 million (later cut to $26 million on appeal) in a lawsuit claiming Roundup was a substantial factor in his cancer. U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria stated that a punitive award was appropriate because the evidence &quot;easily supported a conclusion that Monsanto was more concerned with tamping down safety inquiries and manipulating public opinion than it was with ensuring its product is safe.&quot; Chhabria stated that there was evidence on both sides as to whether glyphosate causes cancer, and that the behavior of Monsanto showed &quot;a lack of concern about the risk that its product might be carcinogenic.&quot;

On May 13, 2019, a jury in California ordered Bayer to pay a couple $2 billion in damages (later cut to $87 million on appeal) after finding that the company had failed to adequately inform consumers of the possible carcinogenicity of Roundup. On December 19, 2019, it was announced that Timothy Litzenburg, the lawyer for the RoundUp Virginia plaintiffs had been charged with extortion after offering to stop searching for more plaintiffs if he was paid a $200 million consulting fee by a manufacturer of glyphosate. Litzenburg and his partner Daniel Kincheloe pleaded guilty to the charges and they were sentenced to two and one years in prison respectively.

In June 2020, Bayer agreed to settle over a hundred thousand Roundup lawsuits, agreeing to pay $8.8 to $9.6 billion to settle those claims, and $1.5 billion for any future claims. The settlement does not include three cases that have already gone to jury trials and are being appealed. However the settlement was not allowed to cover future cases.

In the 2020s, facing billions of dollars in more claims, Beyer lobbied the U.S. Congress and state legislatures to change legal standards for pesticide labeling in an attempt to reduce its liability. , the US EPA planned to reevaluate regulations in 2026.

In 1996, Monsanto was accused of false and misleading advertising of glyphosate products, prompting a lawsuit by the New York State attorney general. Monsanto had made claims that its spray-on glyphosate based herbicides, including Roundup, were safer than table salt and &quot;practically non-toxic&quot; to mammals, birds, and fish, &quot;environmentally friendly&quot;, and &quot;biodegradable&quot;. Citing avoidance of costly litigation, Monsanto settled the case, admitting no wrongdoing, and agreeing to remove the offending advertising claims in New York State.

Environmental and consumer rights campaigners brought a case in France in 2001 accusing Monsanto of presenting Roundup as &quot;biodegradable&quot; and claiming that it &quot;left the soil clean&quot; after use; glyphosate, Roundup&#x27;s main ingredient, was classed by the European Union as &quot;dangerous for the environment&quot; and &quot;toxic for aquatic organisms&quot;. In January 2007, Monsanto was convicted of false advertising and fined 15,000 euros. The result was confirmed in 2009.

On 27 March 2020 Bayer settled claims in a proposed class action alleging that it falsely advertised that the active ingredient in Roundup Weed &amp; Grass Killer only affects plants with a $39.5 million deal that included changing the labels on its products.

In June 2023, Bayer reached a $6.9 million settlement agreement with the New York attorney general, settling false advertising allegations concerning the safety of Roundup.

===Falsification of test results ===
Some tests originally conducted on glyphosate by contractors were later found to have been fraudulent, along with tests conducted on other pesticides. Concerns were raised about toxicology tests conducted by Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories in the 1970s and Craven Laboratories was found to have fraudulently analysed samples for residues of glyphosate in 1991. Monsanto has stated that the studies have since been repeated.

===Ban in France===
In January 2019, Roundup Pro 360 was banned in France following a Lyon court ruling that regulator ANSES had not given due weight to safety concerns when they approved the product in March 2017. The ban went into effect immediately. The court&#x27;s decision cited research by the IARC, based in Lyon.

==Use with genetically modified crops==
Monsanto first developed Roundup in the 1970s. End-users initially used it in a similar way to paraquat and diquat – as a non-selective herbicide. Application of glyphosate-based herbicides to row crops resulted in problems with crop damage and kept them from being widely used for this purpose. In the United States, use of Roundup experienced rapid growth following the commercial introduction of a glyphosate-resistant soybean in 1996. &quot;Roundup Ready&quot; became Monsanto&#x27;s trademark for its patented line of crop seeds that are resistant to Roundup. Between 1990 and 1996 sales of Roundup increased around 20% per year. the product was used in over 160 countries.
Roundup is used most heavily on corn, soy, and cotton crops that have been genetically modified to withstand the chemical, but glyphosate treated approximately 5 million acres in California for crops like almond, peach, cantaloupe, onion, cherry, sweet corn, and citrus, although the product is only applied directly to certain varieties of sweet corn.

<text>Interstate 89 (I-89) is an Interstate Highway in the New England region of the United States traveling from Bow, New Hampshire, to the Canada–United States border between Highgate Springs, Vermont, and Saint-Armand, Quebec. As with all odd-numbered primary Interstates, I-89 is signed as a north–south highway. However, it follows a primarily northwest-to-southeast path. The route forms a major part of the main connection between the cities of Montreal and Boston. In Quebec, the route continues as Route 133. The eventual completion of Autoroute 35 will lead to a nonstop limited-access highway route between Boston and Montreal, following I-93 south from I-89&#x27;s terminus. The largest cities directly served by I-89 are Concord, the state capital of New Hampshire; Montpelier, the state capital of Vermont; and Burlington, Vermont. I-89 is one of three main Interstate highways whose route is located entirely within New England, along with I-91 and I-93 (both of which also have their northernmost pavement in Vermont).

I-89 connects smaller cities and rural areas within New Hampshire and Vermont, and maintains two lanes of traffic in each direction throughout the route. Unlike its neighboring Interstates, it does not intersect any even-numbered Interstates along its route. It does, however, parallel (and intersect multiple times with) portions of three US Routes: US Route 4 (US 4) from Enfield, New Hampshire, to Hartford, Vermont; US 2 from Montpelier to Colchester, Vermont; and US 7 from Burlington to the Canadian border. US 7 and US 2 overlap each other between Burlington and Colchester.

In Chittenden County, Vermont, I-189 begins at exit 13 in South Burlington. The Champlain Parkway, which will be one travel lane in each direction and have at-grade crossings, is being constructed between the current terminus of I-189 at US 7 and Burlington&#x27;s South End as a link toward downtown Burlington. I-189 is the only auxiliary route of I-89.

===New Hampshire===

I-89 runs for about in the state of New Hampshire and is the major freeway corridor through the western part of the state. Despite being signed as a north–south freeway, its first actually run east–west before shifting to the northwest. The two major population centers along I-89&#x27;s length in New Hampshire are Concord, at its southern terminus, and Lebanon, on the Vermont state line. Mileage signs along I-89 in each direction consistently list one of the two cities. Also located along I-89 in New Hampshire are the towns of Grantham, New London, and Warner.

Starting at an interchange with I-93 and New Hampshire Route 3A (NH 3A) in the town of Bow, just south of the New Hampshire capital city of Concord, the highway runs a northwest path through the Dartmouth–Lake Sunapee Region. One exit directly serves Concord (exit 2) before the highway enters the neighboring town of Hopkinton. East–west NH 11 joins I-89 at exit 11 and runs concurrently with it for about before departing at exit 12. At exit 13 in Grantham, NH 10 enters I-89, and the pair of highways form another concurrency, this one for about .

Southeast of Lebanon, signs for exit 15 display the name &quot;Montcalm&quot;, while exit 16 directs travelers to &quot;Purmort&quot;. Neither place name existed at the time of construction of the Interstate. Exits 15 and 16 were built to access portions of the town of Enfield that were otherwise cut off by the new highway. The names were chosen by Enfield&#x27;s selectpeople in 1960; the Purmorts were a prominent local family in the early history of Enfield, and Montcalm was a nearby settlement that had once had its own school and post office. While the Purmort exit does allow access to the state road network (specifically to US 4 via Eastman Hill Road), the Montcalm exit provides access to an otherwise isolated community; every public road from the exit is a dead-end, and leaving the Montcalm area by car requires getting back on I-89 at exit 15. However, a bicycle path parallels I-89 between exits 14 and 16 along the path of Old Route 10, allowing foot or bicycle access to the community.

The highway continues northwest, passing through Lebanon, in which the Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center is located. A few miles north of this point is Dartmouth College. US 4 parallels I-89 through Lebanon. Exits 17 through 20 serve the city of Lebanon and are passed in quick succession. At exit 19, northbound NH 10 separates from I-89 and joins westbound US 4 to pass through West Lebanon. The final exit in New Hampshire is exit 20, providing access to West Lebanon&#x27;s large retail district along NH 12A. Just after this interchange, the highway crosses the Connecticut River and enters Vermont, where it remains for the rest of its run northwest to the Canadian border.

===Vermont===

I-89 is one of Vermont&#x27;s most important roads, as it is the only Interstate Highway to directly serve both Vermont&#x27;s capital city (Montpelier) and largest city (Burlington). Other important cities and towns located along I-89 are Barre, Waterbury, and St. Albans. Williston, which has become Burlington&#x27;s big-box retail center (and one of the fastest-growing towns in the state) over the past decade, also has an interchange along I-89.

Crossing the Connecticut River into Vermont, I-89 continues the northwesterly direction it carried in New Hampshire. The Interstate intersects I-91 at a previously unnumbered interchange (now exit 1) immediately upon entering Vermont. Shortly afterward, another interchange with US 4 occurs. The highway begins to enter the scenic rolling hills of Vermont, turning almost due northward about from the New Hampshire state line, and continues through the high country of central Vermont. The Interstate passes through the towns of Sharon, Royalton, Bethel, Randolph, Brookfield, and Williamstown before reaching the &quot;twin cities&quot; of Barre and Montpelier in the middle of Vermont. The Interstate&#x27;s highest point was said to be in the town of Brookfield, although the sign that made the declaration was taken down in the late 1990s.

Another directional shift, again to the northwest, occurs while passing the interchange for Montpelier. For the next , I-89&#x27;s path is not so much chosen as it is logical: paralleling the Winooski River and US 2, the highway cuts through the section of the Appalachian Mountains known as the Green Mountains, and is surrounded by peaks of over : Camel&#x27;s Hump to the south and Mount Mansfield to the north. US 2 crosses the Interstate frequently, and has several interchanges with it, en route to Burlington.

I-89 was unique due to one instance of its signage. Between (Vermont) exits 9 and 10, a sign showing the distance to the next control cities in each direction was completely in metric. While there are many instances of signs being in both miles and kilometers, this was the only case of solely metric in the entire Interstate System. Both signs were replaced in 2010 and show distances in miles only. (I-19 in Arizona used to be the other &quot;only signed in metric&quot; Interstate in the US, but has been changed over in recent years as the last have been changed.) Speed limit signs have always been posted in miles per hour.
After exit 11 in Richmond, I-89 leaves the Green Mountains to enter the Champlain Valley, and a notable shift in the landscape is visible. Here, just outside Burlington, the highway turns northward once again. Also, at this turn is where the only &quot;official&quot; auxiliary highway starts, I-189. A second highway, I-289, was proposed as a beltway through Burlington&#x27;s northeastern suburbs in the 1980s; amid controversy, the highway has only been partially completed as Vermont Route 289 (VT 289), a super two roadway. It has yet to directly meet its parent.

Passing I-189 at exit 13, I-89 sees the busiest freeway interchange in the entire state, exit 14. A full cloverleaf interchange at this exit provides access to downtown Burlington, the University of Vermont, and the retail-heavy Dorset Street, via US 2. Heading north from Burlington, the landscape quickly fades from suburban development into rolling hills more characteristic of northern New England, providing a vista overlooking Lake Champlain. I-89 passes through Milton, Georgia, St. Albans, Swanton, and finally the border town of Highgate Springs. The highway ends at the Canada–United States border at the Highgate Springs–St. Armand/Philipsburg Border Crossing in Highgate Springs. Its final exit, which northbound motorists can use to reverse direction onto I-89 south without crossing the border, is exit 22—the highest exit number along the route. US 7 has its northern terminus at this interchange as well.

Although the divided highway continues about into Philipsburg, Quebec, as Route 133, this changes back to a two-lane road, through to Autoroute 35&#x27;s current southern terminus in Saint-Sébastien, some north of the United States border, and continues to Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu and Chambly before it meets Autoroute 10, which goes to Montreal. The I-89 border crossing is the only instance where an Interstate entering Quebec does not become an Autoroute upon entry. There are plans to complete the extension of Autoroute 35 from Saint-Sébastien to the border crossing at I-89&#x27;s northern terminus by 2025, creating a freeway-to-freeway connection.

==History==
===Construction===
I-89 was commissioned as part of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, meant to connect Norwalk, Connecticut, to the Canada–United States border via the US 7 corridor, which is the current northern terminus of I-89. Within three years, however, opposition to the project (particularly from Massachusetts, which desired a freeway connection from Boston to Montreal) shifted I-89 to its present alignment that connects Boston with Montreal. The first section of the highway was opened between Montpelier and Middlesex, Vermont, in November 1960, and between Middlesex and Waterbury in December 1960. The highway was subsequently opened between Waterbury and Bolton in November 1961; between South Burlington and Winooski in November 1962; between Winooski and Colchester and between Richmond and South Burlington in November 1963; between Bolton and Richmond in October 1964; in Colchester in November 1964; and between Swanton and Highgate in 1965. The Interstate was opened in most parts of New Hampshire in 1967, and the entirety of the route was opened in 1982.

===Original proposal===
I-89 was originally supposed to be a directly north–south route from I-95 in Norwalk, Connecticut, to its current northern terminus at the Canada–United States border. The route shifted after opposition came from residents and local lawmakers in interior New England who did not want an Interstate running through their countryside and towns. One major problem that was a big part in sinking the project was the fact that the highway would have to go through the Green Mountain National Forest in Vermont. Parts of the Interstate were built in Connecticut, between Norwalk and Wilton and from Brookfield to Danbury, a short bypass around Lenox, Massachusetts, and in southern Vermont between Bennington and Manchester and are currently designated as US 7. The state of Connecticut had plans to extend the Norwalk segment to meet with the Danbury segment but has instead opted to widen portions of the existing road to four lanes. There has always been talk of building the original route of I-89, as it would bring economic development to cities like Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and Bennington, Vermont, and connect parts of the interior Northeast to New York City, but nothing has ever been formally proposed since the original proposal in the 1950s.

===Other routes between Boston and Montreal===
The current route of I-89 is the main artery between Boston and Montreal, two large metropolitan areas in the US and Canada, respectively. Before I-89 was built, there was no limited-access route between the two cities. The route between the two cities is not complete, however, as Autoroute 35 in Quebec still needs to be extended south of its current terminus to connect to I-89 at the Canada–United States border. In 2019, it was announced that the highway would be complete by 2023, , grading of the right of way between the existing terminus at exit 15 to Chemin Champlain is in progress.

== Future ==
Vermont and New Hampshire are working together to reconstruct the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge over the Connecticut River. As part of construction, the deck and superstructure of the bridge would be replaced, and auxiliary lanes would be added to give more merging room for travelers entering and exiting I-89 at the exits for I-91. Construction will occur between 2020 and 2022.

The Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans) has released plans to build a diverging diamond interchange along I-89 at exit 16 (milepost exit 91; US 2/US 7) in Colchester, the first interchange of its kind in the state. Construction was expected to start in early 2023 and be completed in late 2025. However, phase I of construction began earlier than originally planned in winter 2022. Phase I work will relocate utilities, replace waterlines, and remove ledges, along with additional work on retaining walls and drainage. Working on the diverging diamond itself is expected to begin in fall 2024 once bidding and a contract let has been made. However, its completion has now been pushed back to mid-2026.

Starting in early 2024, VTrans is improving the interchange at exit 17 (milepost 97; US 2/US 7) at I-89 and the Chimney Corner intersection of US 2 and US 7 in Colchester, with corresponding roadway improvements and the replacement of the existing bridge carrying US 2 over I-89 within the project limits. In order to address safety concerns of traffic backing up onto I-89 northbound, the intersection of the northbound off-ramp and US 2 will be improved by adding a left turn lane onto US 2 eastbound to increase capacity. The southbound off-ramp will also be reconstructed to make way for a new southbound on-ramp to eliminate the left-turn conflict point for vehicles accessing I-89 southbound from US 2 westbound. In addition, the intersection of US 2 and US 7 will be reconfigured along with the widening of the roadways to accommodate additional turning lanes, all of which are key project elements in reducing queuing and delays. Construction will last for three construction seasons and, as of June 2024, is expected to be completed in mid-2026.

==Exit list==
New Hampshire uses sequential exit numbering, with the interchange with I-93 in Concord being unnumbered. In 2020, Vermont added &quot;milepoint exit&quot; numbers to existing signs, essentially marking each interchange with two exit numbers (except the I-91 interchange, which was previously unnumbered). However, the gore point exit number signs continue to show only the sequential exit numbers.

<text>Samuel Pierpont Langley (August 22, 1834 – February 27, 1906) was an American aviation pioneer, astronomer and physicist who invented the bolometer. He was the third secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and a professor of astronomy at the University of Pittsburgh, where he was the director of the Allegheny Observatory.

==Life==
Langley was born in Roxbury, Boston, on August 23, 1834.

Langley attended Boston Latin School and graduated from English High School of Boston, after which he became an assistant in the Harvard College Observatory. He then moved to a job at the United States Naval Academy, ostensibly as a professor of mathematics. However, he was actually sent there to restore the Academy&#x27;s small observatory. In 1867, he became the director of the Allegheny Observatory and a professor of astronomy at the University of Pittsburgh (then known as the Western University of Pennsylvania), a post he kept until 1891 even while he became the third Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in 1887. Langley was the founder of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. In 1875, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society. In 1888 Langley was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society. In 1898, he received the Prix Jules Janssen, the highest award of the Société astronomique de France, the French astronomical society.

==Allegheny Observatory==
Langley arrived in Pittsburgh in 1867 to become the first director of the Allegheny Observatory, after the institution had fallen into hard times and been given to the Western University of Pennsylvania. By then, the department was in disarray – equipment was broken, there was no library and the building needed repairs. Through the friendship and aid of William Thaw Sr., a Pittsburgh industrial leader, Langley was able to improve the observatory equipment and build additional apparatuses. One of the new instruments was a small transit telescope used to observe the position of the stars as they cross the celestial meridian.

He raised money for the department in large part by distributing standard time to cities and railroads. Up until then, correct time had only occasionally been sent from American observatories for public use. Clocks were manually wound in those days and time tended to be imprecise. Exact time had not been especially necessary. It was enough to know that at noon the sun was at its highest elevation for the day. That changed with the arrival of railroads, which made the lack of standard time dangerous. Trains ran by a published schedule, but scheduling was chaotic. If the timepieces of an engineer and a switch operator differed by even a minute or two, trains could be on the same track at the same time and collide.

Using astronomical observations obtained from the new telescope, Langley devised a precise time standard, including time zones, that became known as the Allegheny Time System. Initially he distributed time signals to Allegheny city businesses and the Pennsylvania Railroad. Eventually, twice a day, the Allegheny time signals gave the correct time via 4,713 miles of telegraph lines to all railroads in the US and Canada. Langley used the money from the railroads to finance the observatory. From about 1868 revenues from Allegheny Time continued to fund the observatory, until the US Naval Observatory provided the signals via taxpayer funding in 1883.

Once funding was secure, Langley devoted his time at the Observatory initially in researching the sun. He used his draftsman skills—from his first job out of high school—to produce hundreds of drawings of solar phenomena, many of which were the first the world had seen. His remarkably detailed 1873 illustration of a sun spot, observed while using the observatory&#x27;s 13-inch Fitz-Clark refractor became a classic. It is featured on page 21 of his book, &quot;The New Astronomy&quot;, and was also widely reprinted in the Americas and Europe.

In 1886, Langley received the inaugural Henry Draper Medal from the National Academy of Sciences for his contributions to solar physics. His publication in 1890 of infrared observations at the Allegheny Observatory in Pittsburgh together with Frank Washington Very along with the data he collected from his invention, the bolometer, was used by Svante Arrhenius to make the first calculations on the greenhouse effect. In 1898, Langley received the Prix Jules Janssen, the highest award of the Société astronomique de France (the French astronomical society).

==Aviation work==
Langley attempted to make a working piloted heavier-than-air aircraft. His models flew, but his two attempts at piloted flight were not successful. Langley began experimenting with rubber-band powered models and gliders in 1887. (According to one book, he was not able to reproduce Alphonse Pénaud&#x27;s time aloft with rubber power but persisted anyway.) He built a rotating arm that functioned like a wind tunnel, and made larger flying models powered by miniature steam engines. Langley realised that sustained powered flight was possible when he found that a 1 lb. brass plate suspended from the rotating arm by a spring, could be kept aloft by a spring tension of less than 1 oz.

Langley understood that aircraft need thrust to overcome drag from forward speed, observed higher aspect ratio flat plates had higher lift and lower drag, and stated in 1902 &quot;A plane of fixed size and weight would need less propulsive power the faster it flew&quot;, the counter-intuitive effect of induced drag.

He met the writer Rudyard Kipling around this time, who described one of Langley&#x27;s experiments in his autobiography:

His first success came on May 6, 1896, when his Number 5 unpiloted model weighing made two flights – and – after a catapult launch from a boat on the Potomac River. The distance was ten times longer than any previous experiment with a heavier-than-air flying machine, demonstrating that stability and sufficient lift could be achieved in such craft.

On November 11 that year his Number 6 model flew more than . In 1898, based on the success of his models, Langley received a War Department grant of $50,000 and $20,000 from the Smithsonian to develop a piloted airplane, which he called an &quot;Aerodrome&quot; (coined from Greek words roughly translated as &quot;air runner&quot;). Langley hired Charles M. Manly (1876–1927) as engineer and test pilot. When Langley received word from his friend Octave Chanute of the Wright brothers&#x27; success with their 1902 glider, he attempted to meet the Wrights, but they politely evaded his request.

While the full-scale Aerodrome was being designed and built, the internal combustion engine was contracted out to manufacturer Stephen M. Balzer (1864–1940). When he failed to produce an engine of the specified power and weight, Manly finished the design. This engine had far more power than did the engine for the Wright brothers&#x27; first airplane—50 hp compared to 12 hp. The engine, mostly the technical work of men other than Langley, was probably the project&#x27;s main contribution to aviation.
The piloted machine had wire-braced tandem wings (one behind the other). It had a Pénaud tail for pitch and yaw control but no roll control, depending instead on the dihedral angle of the wings, as did the models, for maintaining roughly level flight.

In contrast to the Wright brothers&#x27; design of a controllable airplane that could fly with assistance from a strong headwind and land on solid ground, Langley sought safety by practicing in calm air over the Potomac River. This required a catapult for launching. The craft had no landing gear, the plan being to descend into the water after demonstrating flight which if successful would entail a partial, if not total, rebuilding of the machine. Langley gave up the project after two crashes on take-off on October 7 and December 8, 1903.

In the first attempt, Langley said the wing clipped part of the catapult, leading to a plunge into the river &quot;like a handful of mortar,&quot; according to one reporter. On the second attempt the craft broke up as it left the catapult (Hallion, 2003; Nalty, 2003). Manly was recovered unhurt from the river both times. Newspapers made great sport of the failures, and some members of Congress strongly criticized the project.

On 28 May 1914, the Aerodrome was modified and flown a few hundred feet by Glenn Curtiss, as part of his attempt to fight the Wright brothers&#x27; patent, and as an effort by the Smithsonian to rescue Langley&#x27;s aeronautical reputation. Nevertheless, courts upheld the patent. However, the Curtiss flights emboldened the Smithsonian to display the Aerodrome in its museum as &quot;the first man-carrying aeroplane in the history of the world capable of sustained free flight&quot;. Fred Howard, extensively documenting the controversy, wrote: &quot;It was a lie pure and simple, but it bore the imprimatur of the venerable Smithsonian and over the years would find its way into magazines, history books, and encyclopedias, much to the annoyance of those familiar with the facts.&quot; (Howard, 1987). The Smithsonian&#x27;s action triggered a decades-long feud with the surviving Wright brother, Orville, who objected to the Institution&#x27;s claim of primacy for the Aerodrome.

Unlike the Wright brothers with their invention of three-axis control, Langley had no effective way of controlling an airplane too big to be maneuvered by the weight of the pilot&#x27;s body. So if the Aerodrome had flown stably, as the models did, Manly would have been in considerable danger when the machine descended, uncontrolled, for a landing—especially if it had wandered away from the river and over solid ground.

==Bolometer==

In 1880 Langley invented the bolometer, an instrument initially used for measuring far infrared radiation. The bolometer has enabled scientists to detect a change of temperature of less than 1/100,000 of a degree Celsius. It laid the foundation for the measurements of the amount of solar energy on the Earth. He published an 1881 paper on it, &quot;The Bolometer and Radiant Energy&quot;. He made one of the first attempts to measure the surface temperature of the Moon, and his measurement of interference of the infrared radiation by carbon dioxide in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere was used by Svante Arrhenius in 1896 to make the first calculation of how climate would change from a future doubling of carbon dioxide levels.

==Commercial time service==
Starting with his tenure at Allegheny Observatory in the Pittsburgh area in the late 1860s, Langley was a major player in the development of astronomically derived and regulated time distribution services in America through the later half of the 19th century. His work with the railroads in this area is often cited as central to the establishment of the Standard Time Zones system. His very successful and profitable time sales to the Pennsylvania Railroad stood out among the many non-government-based observatories of the day who were largely subsidizing their research by time-service sales to regional railroads and the cities they served. The United States Naval Observatory&#x27;s increasing dominance in this field threatened these regional observatories&#x27; livelihoods and Langley became a leader in efforts to preserve the viability of their commercial programs.

==Death==
Langley held himself responsible for the loss of funds after the June 1905 discovery that Smithsonian accountant William Karr was embezzling from the Institution. Langley refused his salary in the aftermath. In November he suffered a stroke. In February 1906 he moved to Aiken, South Carolina to recuperate, but had another stroke and died on February 27. He was buried in Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston.

<doc id="93842" wikidata="Q192360" url="?curid=93842" title="Autoimmunity">
<text>In immunology, autoimmunity is the system of immune responses of an organism against its own healthy cells, tissues and other normal body constituents. Any disease resulting from this type of immune response is termed an &quot;autoimmune disease&quot;. Prominent examples include celiac disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, Henoch–Schönlein purpura, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis, Graves&#x27; disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Addison&#x27;s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and multiple sclerosis. Autoimmune diseases are very often treated with steroids.

Autoimmunity means presence of antibodies or T cells that react with self-protein and is present in all individuals, even in normal health state. It causes autoimmune diseases if self-reactivity can lead to tissue damage.

==History==
In the later 19th century, it was believed that the immune system was unable to react against the body&#x27;s own tissues. Paul Ehrlich, at the turn of the 20th century, proposed the concept of &quot;horror autotoxicus&quot;. Ehrlich later adjusted his theory to recognize the possibility of autoimmune tissue attacks, but believed certain innate protection mechanisms would prevent the autoimmune response from becoming pathological.

In 1904, this theory was challenged by the discovery of a substance in the serum of patients with paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria that reacted with red blood cells. During the following decades, a number of conditions could be linked to autoimmune responses. However, the authoritative status of Ehrlich&#x27;s postulate hampered the understanding of these findings. Immunology became a biochemical rather than a clinical discipline. By the 1950s, the modern understanding of autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases started to spread.

More recently, it has become accepted that autoimmune responses are an integral part of vertebrate immune systems (sometimes termed &quot;natural autoimmunity&quot;). Autoimmunity should not be confused with alloimmunity.

== Low-level autoimmunity ==
While a high level of autoimmunity is unhealthy, a low level of autoimmunity may actually be beneficial. Taking the experience of a beneficial factor in autoimmunity further, one might hypothesize with intent to prove that autoimmunity is always a self-defense mechanism of the mammal system to survive. The system does not randomly lose the ability to distinguish between self and non-self; the attack on cells may be the consequence of cycling metabolic processes necessary to keep the blood chemistry in homeostasis.

Second, autoimmunity may have a role in allowing a rapid immune response in the early stages of an infection when the availability of foreign antigens limits the response (i.e., when there are few pathogens present). In their study, Stefanova et al. (2002) injected an anti-MHC class II antibody into mice expressing a single type of MHC Class II molecule (H-2b) to temporarily prevent CD4+ T cell-MHC interaction. Naive CD4+ T cells (those that have not encountered non-self antigens before) recovered from these mice 36 hours post-anti-MHC administration showed decreased responsiveness to the antigen pigeon cytochrome c peptide, as determined by ZAP70 phosphorylation, proliferation, and interleukin 2 production. Thus Stefanova et al. (2002) demonstrated that self-MHC recognition (which, if too strong may contribute to autoimmune disease) maintains the responsiveness of CD4+ T cells when foreign antigens are absent.

== Immunological tolerance ==
Pioneering work by Noel Rose and Ernst Witebsky in New York, and Roitt and Doniach at University College London provided clear evidence that, at least in terms of antibody-producing B cells (B lymphocytes), diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and thyrotoxicosis are associated with loss of immunological tolerance, which is the ability of an individual to ignore &quot;self&quot;, while reacting to &quot;non-self&quot;. This breakage leads to the immune system mounting an effective and specific immune response against self antigens. The exact genesis of immunological tolerance is still elusive, but several theories have been proposed since the mid-twentieth century to explain its origin.

Three hypotheses have gained widespread attention among immunologists:
* Clonal deletion theory, proposed by Burnet, according to which self-reactive lymphoid cells are destroyed during the development of the immune system in an individual. For their work Frank M. Burnet and Peter B. Medawar were awarded the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance&quot;.
* Clonal anergy theory, proposed by Nossal, in which self-reactive T- or B-cells become inactivated in the normal individual and cannot amplify the immune response.
* Idiotype network theory, proposed by Jerne, wherein a network of antibodies capable of neutralizing self-reactive antibodies exists naturally within the body.

In addition, two other theories are under intense investigation:
* Clonal ignorance theory, according to which autoreactive T cells that are not represented in the thymus will mature and migrate to the periphery, where they will not encounter the appropriate antigen because it is inaccessible tissues. Consequently, auto-reactive B cells, that escape deletion, cannot find the antigen or the specific helper T cell.
* Suppressor population or Regulatory T cell theory, wherein regulatory T-lymphocytes (commonly CD4+FoxP3+ cells, among others) function to prevent, downregulate, or limit autoaggressive immune responses in the immune system.

Tolerance can also be differentiated into &quot;central&quot; and &quot;peripheral&quot; tolerance, on whether or not the above-stated checking mechanisms operate in the central lymphoid organs (thymus and bone marrow) or the peripheral lymphoid organs (lymph node, spleen, etc., where self-reactive B-cells may be destroyed). It must be emphasised that these theories are not mutually exclusive, and evidence has been mounting suggesting that all of these mechanisms may actively contribute to vertebrate immunological tolerance.

A puzzling feature of the documented loss of tolerance seen in spontaneous human autoimmunity is that it is almost entirely restricted to the autoantibody responses produced by B lymphocytes. Loss of tolerance by T cells has been extremely hard to demonstrate, and where there is evidence for an abnormal T cell response it is usually not to the antigen recognised by autoantibodies. Thus, in rheumatoid arthritis there are autoantibodies to IgG Fc but apparently no corresponding T cell response. In systemic lupus there are autoantibodies to DNA, which cannot evoke a T cell response, and limited evidence for T cell responses implicates nucleoprotein antigens. In Celiac disease there are autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase but the T cell response is to the foreign protein gliadin. This disparity has led to the idea that human autoimmune disease is in most cases (with probable exceptions including type I diabetes) based on a loss of B cell tolerance which makes use of normal T cell responses to foreign antigens in a variety of aberrant ways.

== Immunodeficiency and autoimmunity ==
There are a large number of immunodeficiency syndromes that present clinical and laboratory characteristics of autoimmunity. The decreased ability of the immune system to clear infections in these patients may be responsible for causing autoimmunity through perpetual immune system activation.

One example is common variable immunodeficiency, in which multiple autoimmune diseases are seen, e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune thrombocytopenia and autoimmune thyroid disease.

Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, an autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency, is another example. Pancytopenia, rashes, swollen lymph nodes and enlargement of the liver and spleen are commonly seen in such individuals. Presence of multiple uncleared viral infections due to lack of perforin are thought to be responsible.

In addition to chronic and/or recurrent infections many autoimmune diseases including arthritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, scleroderma and type 1 diabetes mellitus are also seen in X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA).
Recurrent bacterial and fungal infections and chronic inflammation of the gut and lungs are seen in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) as well. CGD is a caused by decreased production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase by neutrophils.
Hypomorphic RAG mutations are seen in patients with midline granulomatous disease; an autoimmune disorder that is commonly seen in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and NK/T cell lymphomas.Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (WAS) patients also present with eczema, autoimmune manifestations, recurrent bacterial infections and lymphoma. In autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy also autoimmunity and infections coexist: organ-specific autoimmune manifestations (e.g., hypoparathyroidism and adrenocortical failure) and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.
Finally, IgA deficiency is also sometimes associated with the development of autoimmune and atopic phenomena.

== Causes ==

=== Genetic factors ===
Certain individuals are genetically susceptible to developing autoimmune diseases. This susceptibility is associated with multiple genes plus other risk factors. Genetically predisposed individuals do not always develop autoimmune diseases. Three main sets of genes are suspected in many autoimmune diseases. These genes are related to:
* Immunoglobulins
* T-cell receptors
* The major histocompatibility complexes (MHC).

The first two, which are involved in the recognition of antigens, are inherently variable and susceptible to recombination. These variations enable the immune system to respond to a very wide variety of invaders, but may also give rise to lymphocytes capable of self-reactivity.
* HLA DR2 is strongly positively correlated with systemic lupus erythematosus, narcolepsy and multiple sclerosis, and negatively correlated with DM Type 1.
* HLA DR3 is correlated strongly with Sjögren syndrome, myasthenia gravis, lupus erythematosus, and type 1 diabetes mellitus.
* HLA DR4 is correlated with the genesis of rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and pemphigus vulgaris.

Fewer correlations exist with MHC class I molecules. The most notable and consistent is the association between HLA B27 and spondyloarthropathies like ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis. Correlations may exist between polymorphisms within class II MHC promoters and autoimmune disease.

The contributions of genes outside the MHC complex remain the subject of research, in animal models of disease (Linda Wicker&#x27;s extensive genetic studies of diabetes in the NOD mouse), and in patients (Brian Kotzin&#x27;s linkage analysis of susceptibility to lupus erythematosus).

In recent studies, the gene PTPN22 has emerged as a significant factor linked to various autoimmune diseases, such as Type I diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis, Graves&#x27; disease, Addison&#x27;s disease, Myasthenia Gravis, vitiligo, systemic sclerosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis. PTPN22 is involved in regulating the activity of immune cells, and so variations in this gene can lead to dysregulation of the immune response, making individuals more susceptible to autoimmune diseases.

=== Existential Factors (a.k.a Endogenous Environmental) ===
==== Sex ====
Most autoimmune diseases are &quot;sex-related; a&quot;s a whole, women are much more likely to develop autoimmune disease than men. Being female is the single greatest risk factor for developing autoimmune disease than any other genetic or environmental risk factor yet discovered. Autoimmune conditions overrepresented in women include: lupus, primary biliary cholangitis, Graves&#x27; disease, Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis, and multiple sclerosis, among many others. A few autoimmune diseases that men are just as or more likely to develop as women include: ankylosing spondylitis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and psoriasis.

The reasons for the sex role in autoimmunity vary. Women appear to generally mount larger inflammatory responses than men when their immune systems are triggered, increasing the risk of autoimmunity. Involvement of sex steroids is indicated by that many autoimmune diseases tend to fluctuate in accordance with hormonal changes, for example: during pregnancy, in the menstrual cycle, or when using oral contraception. A history of pregnancy also appears to leave a persistent increased risk for autoimmune disease. It has been suggested that the slight, direct exchange of cells between mothers and their children during pregnancy may induce autoimmunity. This would tip the gender balance in the direction of the female.

Another theory suggests the female high tendency to get autoimmunity is due to an imbalanced X-chromosome inactivation. The X-inactivation skew theory, proposed by Princeton University&#x27;s Jeff Stewart, has recently been confirmed experimentally in scleroderma and autoimmune thyroiditis. Other complex X-linked genetic susceptibility mechanisms are proposed and under investigation.

=== Environmental factors ===

==== Infectious diseases and parasites ====
An interesting inverse relationship exists between infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases. In areas where multiple infectious diseases are endemic, autoimmune diseases are quite rarely seen. The reverse, to some extent, seems to hold true. The hygiene hypothesis attributes these correlations to the immune-manipulating strategies of pathogens. While such an observation has been variously termed as spurious and ineffective, according to some studies, parasite infection is associated with reduced activity of autoimmune disease.

The putative mechanism is that the parasite attenuates the host immune response in order to protect itself. This may provide a serendipitous benefit to a host that also has autoimmune disease. The details of parasite immune modulation are not yet known, but may include secretion of anti-inflammatory agents or interference with the host immune signaling.

A paradoxical observation has been the strong association of certain microbial organisms with autoimmune diseases.
For example, &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; and coxsackievirus B have been strongly correlated with ankylosing spondylitis and diabetes mellitus type 1, respectively. This has been explained by the tendency of the infecting organism to produce super-antigens that are capable of polyclonal activation of B-lymphocytes, and production of large amounts of antibodies of varying specificities, some of which may be self-reactive (see below).

==== Chemical agents and drugs ====
Certain chemical agents and drugs can also be associated with the genesis of autoimmune conditions, or conditions that simulate autoimmune diseases. The most striking of these is the drug-induced lupus erythematosus. Usually, withdrawal of the offending drug cures the symptoms in a patient.

Cigarette smoking is now established as a major risk factor for both incidence and severity of rheumatoid arthritis. This may relate to abnormal citrullination of proteins, since the effects of smoking correlate with the presence of antibodies to citrullinated peptides.

== Pathogenesis of autoimmunity ==
Several mechanisms are thought to be operative in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, against a backdrop of genetic predisposition and environmental modulation. It is beyond the scope of this article to discuss each of these mechanisms exhaustively, but a summary of some of the important mechanisms have been described:
* T-cell bypass – A normal immune system requires the activation of B cells by T cells before the former can undergo differentiation into plasma B-cells and subsequently produce antibodies in large quantities. This requirement of a T cell can be bypassed in rare instances, such as infection by organisms producing super-antigens, which are capable of initiating polyclonal activation of B-cells, or even of T-cells, by directly binding to the β-subunit of T-cell receptors in a non-specific fashion.
* T-cell–B-cell discordance – A normal immune response is assumed to involve B and T cell responses to the same antigen, even if we know that B cells and T cells recognise very different things: conformations on the surface of a molecule for B cells and pre-processed peptide fragments of proteins for T cells. However, there is nothing as far as we know that requires this. All that is required is that a B cell recognising antigen X endocytoses and processes a protein Y (normally =X) and presents it to a T cell. Roosnek and Lanzavecchia showed that B cells recognising IgGFc could get help from any T cell responding to an antigen co-endocytosed with IgG by the B cell as part of an immune complex. In coeliac disease it seems likely that B cells recognising tissue transglutamine are helped by T cells recognising gliadin.
* Aberrant B cell receptor-mediated feedback – A feature of human autoimmune disease is that it is largely restricted to a small group of antigens, several of which have known signaling roles in the immune response (DNA, C1q, IgGFc, Ro, Con. A receptor, Peanut agglutinin receptor(PNAR)). This fact gave rise to the idea that spontaneous autoimmunity may result when the binding of antibody to certain antigens leads to aberrant signals being fed back to parent B cells through membrane bound ligands. These ligands include B cell receptor (for antigen), IgG Fc receptors, CD21, which binds complement C3d, Toll-like receptors 9 and 7 (which can bind DNA and nucleoproteins) and PNAR. More indirect aberrant activation of B cells can also be envisaged with autoantibodies to acetyl choline receptor (on thymic myoid cells) and hormone and hormone binding proteins. Together with the concept of T-cell–B-cell discordance this idea forms the basis of the hypothesis of self-perpetuating autoreactive B cells. Autoreactive B cells in spontaneous autoimmunity are seen as surviving because of subversion both of the T cell help pathway and of the feedback signal through B cell receptor, thereby overcoming the negative signals responsible for B cell self-tolerance without necessarily requiring loss of T cell self-tolerance.
* Molecular mimicry – An exogenous antigen may share structural similarities with certain host antigens; thus, any antibody produced against this antigen (which mimics the self-antigens) can also, in theory, bind to the host antigens, and amplify the immune response. The idea of molecular mimicry arose in the context of rheumatic fever, which follows infection with Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci. Although rheumatic fever has been attributed to molecular mimicry for half a century no antigen has been formally identified (if anything too many have been proposed). Moreover, the complex tissue distribution of the disease (heart, joint, skin, basal ganglia) argues against a cardiac specific antigen. It remains entirely possible that the disease is due to e.g. an unusual interaction between immune complexes, complement components and endothelium.
* Idiotype cross-reaction – Idiotypes are antigenic epitopes found in the antigen-binding portion (Fab) of the immunoglobulin molecule. Plotz and Oldstone presented evidence that autoimmunity can arise as a result of a cross-reaction between the idiotype on an antiviral antibody and a host cell receptor for the virus in question. In this case, the host-cell receptor is envisioned as an internal image of the virus, and the anti-idiotype antibodies can react with the host cells.
* Cytokine dysregulation – Cytokines have been recently divided into two groups according to the population of cells whose functions they promote: Helper T-cells type 1 or type 2. The second category of cytokines, which include IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-β (to name a few), seem to have a role in prevention of exaggeration of pro-inflammatory immune responses.
* Dendritic cell apoptosis – immune system cells called dendritic cells present antigens to active lymphocytes. Dendritic cells that are defective in apoptosis can lead to inappropriate systemic lymphocyte activation and consequent decline in self-tolerance.
* Epitope spreading or epitope drift – when the immune reaction changes from targeting the primary epitope to also targeting other epitopes. In contrast to molecular mimicry, the other epitopes need not be structurally similar to the primary one.
* Epitope modification or Cryptic epitope exposure – this mechanism of autoimmune disease is unique in that it does not result from a defect in the hematopoietic system. Instead, disease results from the exposure of cryptic N-glycan (polysaccharide) linkages common to lower eukaryotes and prokaryotes on the glycoproteins of mammalian non-hematopoietic cells and organs This exposure of phylogenically primitive glycans activates one or more mammalian innate immune cell receptors to induce a chronic sterile inflammatory state. In the presence of chronic and inflammatory cell damage, the adaptive immune system is recruited and self–tolerance is lost with increased autoantibody production. In this form of the disease, the absence of lymphocytes can accelerate organ damage, and intravenous IgG administration can be therapeutic. Although this route to autoimmune disease may underlie various degenerative disease states, no diagnostics for this disease mechanism exist at present, and thus its role in human autoimmunity is currently unknown.

The roles of specialized immunoregulatory cell types, such as regulatory T cells, NKT cells, γδ T-cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease are under investigation.

== Classification ==
Autoimmune diseases can be broadly divided into systemic and organ-specific or localised autoimmune disorders, depending on the principal clinico-pathologic features of each disease.
* Systemic autoimmune diseases include coeliac disease, lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, and dermatomyositis. These conditions tend to be associated with autoantibodies to antigens which are not tissue specific. Thus although polymyositis is more or less tissue specific in presentation, it may be included in this group because the autoantigens are often ubiquitous t-RNA synthetases.
* Local syndromes which affect a specific organ or tissue:
** Endocrinologic: diabetes mellitus type 1, Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis, Addison&#x27;s disease
** Gastrointestinal:Pernicious anaemia
** Dermatologic: pemphigus vulgaris, vitiligo
** Haematologic: autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
** Neurological: multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, autoimmune encephalitis, gluten ataxia

Using the traditional &quot;organ specific&quot; and &quot;non-organ specific&quot; classification scheme, many diseases have been lumped together under the autoimmune disease umbrella. However, many chronic inflammatory human disorders lack the telltale associations of B and T cell driven immunopathology. In the last decade it has been firmly established that tissue &quot;inflammation against self&quot; does not necessarily rely on abnormal T and B cell responses.

This has led to the recent proposal that the spectrum of autoimmunity should be viewed along an &quot;immunological disease continuum&quot;, with classical autoimmune diseases at one extreme and diseases driven by the innate immune system at the other extreme. Within this scheme, the full spectrum of autoimmunity can be included. Many common human autoimmune diseases can be seen to have a substantial innate immune mediated immunopathology using this new scheme. This new classification scheme has implications for understanding disease mechanisms and for therapy development.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of autoimmune disorders largely rests on accurate history and physical examination of the patient, and high index of suspicion against a backdrop of certain abnormalities in routine laboratory tests (example, elevated C-reactive protein).

In several systemic disorders, serological assays which can detect specific autoantibodies can be employed. Localised disorders are best diagnosed by immunofluorescence of biopsy specimens.

Autoantibodies are used to diagnose many autoimmune diseases. The levels of autoantibodies are measured to determine the progress of the disease.

== Treatments ==

Treatments for autoimmune disease have traditionally been immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, or palliative. Managing inflammation is critical in autoimmune diseases. Non-immunological therapies, such as hormone replacement in Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis or Type 1 diabetes mellitus treat outcomes of the autoaggressive response, thus these are palliative treatments. Dietary manipulation limits the severity of celiac disease. Steroidal or NSAID treatment limits inflammatory symptoms of many diseases. IVIG is used for CIDP and GBS. Specific immunomodulatory therapies, such as the TNFα antagonists (e.g. etanercept), the B cell depleting agent rituximab, the anti-IL-6 receptor tocilizumab and the costimulation blocker abatacept have been shown to be useful in treating RA. Some of these immunotherapies may be associated with increased risk of adverse effects, such as susceptibility to infection.

Helminthic therapy is an experimental approach that involves inoculation of the patient with specific parasitic intestinal nematodes (helminths). There are currently two closely related treatments available, inoculation with either Necator americanus, commonly known as hookworms, or Trichuris Suis Ova, commonly known as Pig Whipworm Eggs.

T-cell vaccination is also being explored as a possible future therapy for autoimmune disorders.

=== Nutrition and autoimmunity ===

Vitamin D/Sunlight
:*Because most human cells and tissues have receptors for vitamin D, including T and B cells, adequate levels of vitamin D can aid in the regulation of the immune system. Vitamin D plays a role in immune function by acting on T cells and natural killer cells.  Research has demonstrated an association between low serum vitamin D and autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (commonly referred to simply as lupus).  However, since photosensitivity occurs in lupus, patients are advised to avoid sunlight which may be responsible for vitamin D deficiency seen in this disease. Polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor gene are commonly found in people with autoimmune diseases, giving one potential mechanism for vitamin D&#x27;s role in autoimmunity. There is mixed evidence on the effect of vitamin D supplementation in type 1 diabetes, lupus, and multiple sclerosis. 
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
:*Studies have shown that adequate consumption of omega-3 fatty acids counteracts the effects of arachidonic acids, which contribute to symptoms of autoimmune diseases. Human and animal trials suggest that omega-3 is an effective treatment modality for many cases of Rheumatoid Arthritis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Asthma, and Psoriasis.
:*While major depression is not necessarily an autoimmune disease, some of its physiological symptoms are inflammatory and autoimmune in nature. Omega-3 may inhibit production of interferon gamma and other cytokines which cause the physiological symptoms of depression. This may be due to the fact that an imbalance in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which have opposing effects, is instrumental in the etiology of major depression.
Probiotics/Microflora
:*Various types of bacteria and microflora present in fermented dairy products, especially &quot;Lactobacillus casei&quot;, have been shown to both stimulate immune response to tumors in mice and to regulate immune function, delaying or preventing the onset of nonobese diabetes. This is particularly true of the Shirota strain of &quot;L. casei&quot; (LcS). The LcS strain is mainly found in yogurt and similar products in Europe and Japan, and rarely elsewhere.
Antioxidants
:*It has been theorized that free radicals contribute to the onset of type-1 diabetes in infants and young children, and therefore that the risk could be reduced by high intake of antioxidant substances during pregnancy. However, a study conducted in a hospital in Finland from 1997 to 2002 concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between antioxidant intake and diabetes risk. This study involved monitoring of food intake through questionnaires, and estimated antioxidant intake on this basis, rather than by exact measurements or use of supplements.

<text>&quot;&quot; (; ) is one of the two national anthems of Denmark—the other being the royal anthem &quot;Kong Christian stod ved højen mast&quot;.

==History==
The lyrics were written in 1819 by Adam Oehlenschläger and bore the motto in (Horace: &quot;This corner of the earth smiles for me more than any other&quot;). The music was composed in 1835 by Hans Ernst Krøyer. Later, Thomas Laub and Carl Nielsen, each composed alternative melodies, but neither has gained widespread adoption, and today they are mostly unknown to the general population.

When it was first published, the national anthem had twelve verses, but later editions shortened it to the first, third, fifth, and last verses.

Denmark is one of only two countries in the world — the other being New Zealand – with two official national anthems. Officially, &quot;Kong Christian stod ved højen mast&quot; is a national and a royal anthem; it has equal status with &quot;Der er et yndigt land&quot;, the civil national anthem. On official and military occasions, &quot;Kong Christian&quot; is performed alone, or the two national anthems are played together.

==Lyrics==

In certain situations, such as sporting events, only the first verse (or stanza) and the last three lines of the fourth verse are sung.

<text>Acton () is a town in West London, England, within the London Borough of Ealing. It is west of Charing Cross.

At the 2011 census, its four wards, East Acton, Acton Central, South Acton and Southfield, had a population of 62,480, a ten-year increase of 8,791 people. North Acton, West Acton, East Acton, South Acton, Acton Green, Acton Town, Acton Vale and Acton Central are all parts of Acton.

Acton means &quot;oak farm&quot; or &quot;farm by oak trees&quot;, and is derived from the Old English &quot;āc&quot; (oak) and &quot;tūn&quot; (farm). Originally an ancient village, as London expanded, Acton was absorbed into the city. Since 1965, Acton equates to the east of the London Borough of Ealing, though some of East Acton is in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and a small portion of South Acton is in the London Borough of Hounslow.

Central Acton is synonymous with the hub of commerce and retail on the former main road between London and Oxford (the Uxbridge Road); a reminder of its history is in its inns, which in some cases date back to the late Tudor period as stopping places for travellers. Nowadays, the principal route linking London and Oxford (the A40 dual carriageway) bypasses central Acton, but passes through East Acton and North Acton.

==Toponymy==
Acton&#x27;s name derives from the Old English words &quot;āc&quot; (oak) and &quot;tūn&quot; (enclosed garden, enclosure), meaning &quot;a garden or a field enclosed by oaks&quot;. Later, in the Middle Ages &quot;tūn&quot; became a synonym for &quot;farm&quot; or &quot;farm by oak trees&quot;. For several centuries, its name bore the prefix &quot;Church&quot; (hence &quot;Chirche Acton&quot;, &quot;Churche Acton&quot;, etc.) to distinguish it from the separate hamlet of East Acton.

==History==
===Origins===

Different phases of prehistoric settlement are marked by a range of finds. It begins with a cluster of Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic flint cores, flakes and artefacts mainly to the north of Churchfield Road. Around the Mill Hill Park area, a Neolithic axe, and a group of Bronze Age Deverel-Rimbury urns and cremated bone were found, along with an Iron Age pot shard. Iron Age coins were also found near Bollo Lane. The Roman period is represented by a ditch in the same area, and a hoard north of Springfield Gardens. In the Middle Ages the northern half of the parish was heavily wooded. Oaks and elms still stood along roads and hedgerows and in private grounds in the early 20th century, but most of the woodland had been cleared by the 17th century, even on the extensive Old Oak common.

===Medieval era===
Landholders figuring in county records were resident by 1222 and houses were recorded from the late 13th century. The main settlement, Church Acton or Acton town, lay slightly west of the centre of the parish along the highway to Oxford (Uxbridge Road) at the 5-mile post out of London. By 1380 some of the tenements, such as &quot;The Tabard&quot; and &quot;The Cock&quot;, along the south side of the road, were inns. The hamlet of East Acton, mentioned in 1294, consisted of farmhouses and cottages north and south of common land known as East Acton green by 1474.

Medieval settlement was mainly around the two hamlets. At Church Acton most of the farmhouses lay along the Oxford road or Horn Lane, with only a few outlying farms. Friars Place Farm at the north end of Horn Lane and the moated site to the west, occupied until the 15th century, were early farms. East of Friars Place farm were commons: Worton or Watton Green and Rush green in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Friars Place in the 18th century, where there was some settlement by 1664. To the north-west were Acton or Old Oak wells, known by 1613. In the parish&#x27;s extreme south, a few farmhouses on the northern side of Acton common or Acton Green were mentioned as in Turnham Green until the 19th century and were linked more closely with that village than with Acton. &quot;Gregories&quot;, mentioned in 1551 as a copyhold tenement with 30 a. near Bollo Lane and the Brentford high road, probably lay in Acton.

Londoners were increasingly involved in land sales from the early 14th century but apparently did not live in Acton until the late 15th. The manor, part of Fulham, had no resident (demesne) lord, and apart from a brief period before , when a branch of the landed Somerset (Duke of Beaufort&#x27;s) family lived in Acton, there were no large resident landowners. Many of the tenements without land, including most of the inns, frequently changed hands.

===Early modern period===
The parish had 158 communicants in 1548. In 1664 it had 72 chargeable households and 59 exempt, with 6 empty houses. Six houses had 10 or more hearths, 16 had from 5 to 9, 33 had 3 or 4, 23 had 2, and 53 had 1. Acton had about 160 families resident in the mid 18th century.

By the 17th century Acton&#x27;s proximity to London had made it a summer retreat for courtiers and lawyers. Sir Richard Sutton bought the seat at East Acton known later as Manor House in 1610 and Sir Henry Garraway probably rebuilt Acton House in 1638. Sir John Trevor MP bought several Acton properties in the mid 17th century, including Berrymead/Berrymede, improving it with a lake and stream, home of George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax and his second son after him, and afterwards of the Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull, with a much-praised landscape.

Acton was lauded as &quot;blessed with very sweet air&quot; in 1706 by rector urging a friend in verse to move there. The fashion for medicinal waters brought a brief period of fame, with the exploitation of the wells at Old Oak common, when East Acton and Friars Place were said to be thronged with summer visitors, who had brought about improvement in the houses there. Although high society had left Acton by the mid 18th century, many professional and military men bought houses there, sometimes including a small park, until well into the 19th century. The break-up of the Fetherstonhaugh estate, which had had no resident owner, produced four or five small estates whose owners, professional men such as Samuel Wegg, John Winter, and Richard White, were active in parish affairs. Grand early homes included: Heathfield Lodge, West Lodge, and East Lodge by Winter c. 1800, Mill Hill House by White, and Woodlands at Acton Hill soon afterwards. Acton Green also became increasingly popular, being near Chiswick High Road (the Great West Road). Fairlawn, substantial, on west side of the green, was the home of the botanist John Lindley (1797–1865) as was the house to the north and Bedford House, another home of Lindley, and Melbourne House further east. A short row of houses had been built on the south side of the green by 1800.

In 1804, Derwentwater House was built in the grounds of Acton House by the Selby family.

===19th century development===

In 1812, twenty almshouses were built by the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths on the former Perryn estate, on land which had been left to the company by John Perryn in 1657.

There were 241 inhabited houses in 1801 and 426 by 1831. Growth took place mainly in the established residential neighbourhoods of Acton town and East Acton, but Acton Green also had acquired a cluster of cottages and houses at the bottom of Acton Lane by 1842. Acton was mostly rural in 1831. The few mansions contrasted sharply with most of the houses, which were described as &#x27;beneath mediocrity of character&#x27;. Despite an overall rise in the number of houses, poor rates had to be increased in the 1820s because of a growing number of empty dwellings.

More widespread building was planned and took place in the 1850s. As a result of its soft water sources, Acton became famous for its laundries and at the end of the 19th century there were around 170 establishments in South Acton. These laundries would serve hotels and the rich in London&#x27;s West End, leading to the nickname &quot;Soapsuds Island&quot; or &quot;Soap Sud City&quot;. At least 600 different laundries operated within South Acton, the last laundry closed in the late 1970s and is now a low redbrick block of flats.

The parish of Acton formed a local board of health in 1865 and became an urban district in 1894.

In 1895, Acton Cemetery was opened on farmland near to what is now North Acton Station.

===20th century===
The town was incorporated as the Municipal Borough of Acton in 1921. This authority combined with the municipal boroughs of Ealing and Southall to form the London Borough of Ealing, within Greater London, in 1965. An Acton Golf Club was founded in 1896, which closed in 1920 and the area was redeveloped for housing.

Acton formed an urban district and, later, municipal borough of Middlesex from 1894 to 1965. Its former area was used to form part of the London Borough of Ealing in 1965. The industries of North Acton merged with the great industrial concentrations of Park Royal and Harlesden. During the 20th century Acton was a major industrial centre employing tens of thousands of people, particularly in the motor vehicles and components industries. These included car manufacturer Renault, that built the 4CV and Dauphine, at a factory in North Acton from 1926 until 1960. Renault has remained on the site continuously since the 1920s and still has its main London showroom on the Park Royal site. Alfred Mond built a nickel carbonyl refinery here that was able to produce platinum as a by-product of the matte from Inco&#x27;s Sudbury Basin operations.

Further south Acton Vale had manufacturers including Napier &amp; Son (engines), H. Bronnley &amp; Co (Soaps), Evershed &amp; Vignoles (electrical equipment), Lucas CAV (automotive electrical), Vandervell Products (bearings), and Wilkinson Sword (swords and razors).

==Acton today==
Acton is now principally residential, with some light industry, particularly in the northeast Park Royal area, and the south near the border with Chiswick. Waitrose was founded on Acton High Street near the police station, as Waite, Rose and Taylor, with its second shop opening in Churchfield Road in 1913.

Acton has the largest housing estate in west London, the South Acton estate, with approximately 2,000 homes and 5,800 residents.

This area is currently in the Phase 2 of a major 15-year phased regeneration which includes near-total demolition of the existing residential units, and the construction of new and more numerous residential units. Since World War II, Acton has had a small but notable population of Polish immigrants. In recent years, a number of Antipodean immigrants have settled there; there are several Australian and South African pubs concentrated in a small area. The Japanese School in London has also attracted a Japanese community to West Acton. East Acton&#x27;s King Fahd Academy also attracted Arab and mainly Saudi immigrants to the area. The Somali community is concentrated around Church Road, and there are two mosques near the High Street. The Irish community has diminished somewhat in recent years, but there are still a number of Irish pubs in the area.

Acton has the starting point of the 25 kilometre Thames Tideway Tunnel (also known as the &quot;Super Sewer&quot;) at the Acton Storm Tanks in Canham Road. This will be built to avoid the discharge of sewage from Combined Sewer Overflow into the River Thames.

==Leisure==

The Mount on Acton High Street hosts a market on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Visitors can shop at stalls selling a range of produce. Acton&#x27;s library, swimming baths (built in 1904) and Town Hall are examples of tall Victorian municipal buildings that can be found along the High Street. The Swimming Baths closed in December 2011 for a three-year development project, replacing the existing pools with a 25m 8-lane pool and a smaller teaching pool. The site reopened in April 2014. An indoor climbing wall opened on the high street, housed in a building constructed in the 1920s as an Art Deco cinema. The building was later used as a bingo hall before being refurbished into a bouldering centre.

On the east end of Acton High Street is Acton Park, which features mini golf, bar and pizza restaurant operated by Putt in the Park. The southeastern bcorner of the park includes tennis courts, outdoor fitness equipment and a multi-purpose basketball and 5-a-side football court. The park also features a large children&#x27;s play area including, an adventure playground partially created from local trees felled during a storm, a pond, an art block and a skate park, run by the Ealing Skatepark Association, which opened in April 2019.

==Education==
=== Primary schools ===
There are six state-funded primary schools in Acton, Berrymede Junior School, Derwentwater Primary School, East Acton Primary School, St Vincent&#x27;s RC Primary School, West Acton Primary School, West Twyford Primary School. The Ark (charity) has opened two primary academies in Acton, Ark Priory Primary Academy in 2013 and Ark Byron Primary Academy in 2015, the latter is based in Acton Park.

===Secondary schools===
Acton has three state-funded secondary high schools, Ark Acton Academy (formerly Acton High School), Twyford Church of England High School and The Ellen Wilkinson School for Girls. Acton was once home to another independent school, Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s School for Girls before it changed its site to Elstree, the Acton site becoming the Cardinal Newman Roman Catholic High School.

===International schools===

The Japanese School in London is in Acton.

Acton has seven railway stations bearing its name, more than any other place in the United Kingdom other than London itself. Acton is also the only place in London to have stations named after all four of its cardinal points, north, south, east, and west. The widespread provision of train services reflects a long railway history, particularly associated (historically) with London Transport and the Great Western Railway. Between 1858 and 1864 there was a further station on the North London Railway, &quot;Acton Junction&quot;, where the line to Hammersmith &amp; Chiswick railway station branched off.

North Acton has a large Great Western Railway housing estate (now privately owned), and the Old Oak Common TMD railway depot is within the usual boundary, as is the London Transport Museum Depot which houses an extensive collection of historic and heritage rolling stock. Acton Main Line station has a busy freight yard (operating ballast and container trains).

===Buses===
London Buses routes 7, 70, 72, 94, 95, 207, 218, 228, 260, 266, 272, 283, 306, 427, 440, 487, E3, N7, N11, N207 and SL8 serve Acton.

===Shelved tram proposals===
Transport for London, led by then Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, proposed to build a West London Tram between Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Uxbridge town centre. It would have run along the A4020, the Uxbridge Road, through Acton, Ealing, West Ealing, Hanwell, Southall and Hayes End. This proposed scheme was highly controversial and resulted in strong differences in opinion between TfL, who supported the scheme, and local councils throughout the proposed route, who all took a &#x27;no tram&#x27; stance.

The West London Tram was finally scrapped when former Prime Minister Gordon Brown agreed that the long-awaited Crossrail would go ahead in October 2007. Acton Main Line railway station is now a station on the Elizabeth line, delivered by the Crossrail project, with 4 trains per hour in each direction.

<text>Addington is a village and area in south London, England, within the London Borough of Croydon. It is south of Spring Park, west of Coney Hall, north of New Addington and east of Forestdale and Selsdon, and is south of Charing Cross and south-east of the centre of Croydon.

==History==
In Domesday Book of 1086, the area was named &quot;Edintona&quot; and then &quot;Eddintone&quot;. The village lay within the Wallington hundred in the county of Surrey. Addington is thought to be named after Edda, a Saxon landowner. In Domesday, two manors are mentioned, linked with the names Godric and Osward.

===Addington Palace===
Addington Place, later known as Addington Farm and now called Addington Palace, dominates the village above the church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin Church and &quot;The Cricketers&quot; pub. The manor house was situated behind the church and was the residence of the Leigh family. There is an oft repeated, but false account of a royal hunting lodge, &quot;where King Henry VIII supposedly wooed Anne Boleyn, whose family owned nearby Wickham Court&quot; by West Wickham Parish Church. However, the Anne Boleyn of Wickham Court was the aunt of Queen Anne.

The Palladian Palace was built in 1780 by Barlow Trecothick, from Boston, Massachusetts in the colonial Province of Massachusetts Bay, who returned to England and became an MP and Lord Mayor of the City of London in 1770. After his death without heirs, his nephew James Ivers (later Trecothick), also of Boston, continued his uncle&#x27;s work and had the grounds laid out by Capability Brown. The estate was sold and eventually, as Croydon Palace became too inconvenient and unsanitary, the Addington house and part of the estate was bought for the Archbishops of Canterbury as a country residence. The last Archbishop to use it was Archbishop Benson. From 1954 to 1996, Addington Palace was the headquarters of the Royal School of Church Music.

===New Addington===
Around 1805 parts of the estate covering what is now New Addington were sold to John Cator of Beckenham Place, including Castle Hill Farm. Cator left this to George and Henry Sparkes in his Will in 1806, citing &quot;Addington recently acquired from ... Trecothick&quot; but the land appears as part of the Cator estates in an 1825 private Act of Parliament allowing the Cators to sell the land, as John Barwell Cator was transferring the main estate holdings to Woodbastwick in Norfolk.
In the 20th century, technological advances and population growth in the region led to many changes in the way of life for people in Addington. At the beginning of the century, Addington was in the county of Surrey, which had established urban and rural districts to provide services matched to the needs of the differing communities. The parish of Addington was transferred to Godstone Rural District on abolition of Croydon Rural District in 1915. Subsequently, Addington parish was absorbed by the County Borough of Croydon in 1925. Since 1965 the county borough has been part of the London Borough of Croydon within highly urbanized Greater London, which ended over 900 years of administration by the county of Surrey.

New Addington was developed to the south of the existing village from the 1930s onwards.

There are still several old houses and buildings in Addington and, even though there has been some fairly modern building, the village atmosphere is intact in the 21st century, despite its being in Greater London. There is a blacksmith&#x27;s forge, dating from around 1740, now mainly making ornamental ironwork.
The hunt used to meet outside the pub, &quot;The Cricketers&quot; which has reverted to its former name once again after a temporary change of name. The village co-operative store and post office is now a private house.

==St Mary the Blessed Virgin Church==

St Mary&#x27;s Church, Addington is an Anglican church in the village. It is associated with the Archbishops of Canterbury of the 19th century, who lived at nearby Addington Palace. Five successive archbishops are buried at the church: Charles Manners-Sutton (d.1828); William Howley (d.1848); John Bird Sumner (d.1862); Charles Longley (d.1868); and Archibald Campbell Tait (d.1882).

==Transport==
===Rail===
Addington Village Interchange (also known as Addington Village tram stop) connects the area with Tramlink services to West Croydon and New Addington. Addington Palace is served by Gravel Hill tram stop on the same line.

===Bus===
The interchange also provides access to bus routes run by Transport for London, which connect it with areas including Bromley, Croydon, Eltham, Hayes, New Addington, Orpington, Purley and Thornton Heath.

==Sport==

Cricket has been played in the village since at least the 18th century.

The Addington Golf Club is regarded as an important golf facility in the London area.

<text>Addiscombe is an area of south London, England, within the London Borough of Croydon. It is located south of Charing Cross, and is situated north of Coombe and Selsdon, east of Croydon town centre, south of Woodside, and west of Shirley.

==Etymology==
Addiscombe as a place name is thought to be Anglo-Saxon in origin, meaning &quot;Eadda or Æddi&#x27;s estate&quot;, from an Anglo-Saxon personal name, and the word &quot;camp&quot;, meaning an enclosed area in Old English. The same Anglo-Saxon land-owner may have given his name to Addington, around two miles to the south.

==History==
First mentioned in the 13th century, Addiscombe formed part of Croydon Manor, and was known as enclosed land belonging to Eadda. The area was a rural and heavily wooded area for much of its history. Its main industries were farming and brick-making, clay deposits at Woodside providing the raw materials for the latter. 

During the Tudor period, Addiscombe was a large country estate and the seat of the Heron family. Sir Nicholas Heron died there in 1568 and was interred at his family&#x27;s chapel at Croydon Minster.

The estate passed through several owners until 1650 when it was sold to Sir Purbeck Temple, a member of the Privy Council in the time of Charles II. After the death of Sir Purbeck in 1695 and his wife Dame Sarah Temple in 1700, the estate passed to Dame Sarah&#x27;s nephew, William Draper, who was married to the daughter of the famous diarist, John Evelyn. When Draper died in 1718, he left his estate to his son of the same name and it then passed to his nephew, Charles Clark.

===Addiscombe Place===
In 1703, Addiscombe Place was built for William Draper to Sir John Vanbrugh&#x27;s design. The house was built on a site which is now the corner of Outram Road and Mulberry Lane and became known as one of three great houses in Addiscombe, the others being &#x27;Ashburton House&#x27; and &#x27;Stroud Green House&#x27;. It replaced the Elizabethan mansion built by Thomas Heron in 1516. John Tunstall, a courtier of Anne of Denmark, bought Heron&#x27;s house and had a noted flower garden.

John Evelyn recorded in his &quot;Diary&quot;, &quot;I went to Adscomb on 11 July 1703 to see my son-in-law’s new house. It has excellent brickwork and Portland stone features, that I pronounced it good solid architecture, and one of the very best gentlemen&#x27;s houses in Surrey.&quot; Distinguished guests who stayed at the mansion include George III, William Pitt the Elder and Peter the Great of Russia. Peter the Great was reputed to have planted a cedar tree in Mulberry Lane to record his visit. 

During the 18th century Addiscombe Place was successively the home to The Lord Talbot, The Lord Grantham and lastly The Earl of Liverpool, who died there in 1808.

===Addiscombe Military Seminary===
In 1809, Emelius Ratcliffe sold Addiscombe Place to the British East India Company for £15,500, whereupon it became a military academy known as the Addiscombe Military Seminary. Cadets were trained as officers for one of the Company&#x27;s three Presidency Armies. Its counterpart, East India Company College in Hertfordshire, trained the Company&#x27;s administrators. The Indian Mutiny of 1857 led to strong criticism of the Company, and in 1858 it was nationalised by the British government. The military seminary was closed in 1861 and the remaining cadets transferred to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. 

In 1863, the seminary buildings were sold for £33,600 to developers who razed most of them to the ground. Five parallel roads were laid out on the site, to the south of the former college site – Outram, Havelock, Elgin, Clyde and Canning Roads. They were all named after individuals who were prominent in either the military or civil governance of British India namely; Sir James Outram, Bt, Sir Henry Havelock, The Earl of Elgin, The Lord Clyde and The Earl Canning. All that survives of the Seminary itself are two buildings called &#x27;Ashleigh&#x27; and &#x27;India&#x27;, on the corner of Clyde Road and Addiscombe Road, and a former gymnasium on Havelock Road, now private apartments.

===Suburban growth===

With the advent of the railways in the 1830s, Cherry Orchard Road linking Addiscombe with Croydon ceased to be a quiet rural lane and railway workers&#x27; cottages sprang up, many with the still-visible date of 1838. However it was not until 1858 and the sale of the college, that significant urbanisation occurred.

There was formerly a small chapel attached to Addiscombe Military Seminary and to this, cadets paraded each morning and evening for a service conducted by the chaplain. On Sundays, cadets went down to the Parish Church in Croydon. By 1827, it became clear that Croydon Parish Church was too far away to minister to the college needs and St James&#x27; Parish Church was built and consecrated on 31 January 1829. The population of Addiscombe at this time was about 1,000. In 1870, the church of St Paul&#x27;s (built by Edward Buckton Lamb) was opened and then rededicated in 1874 to St Mary Magdalene. The parish of Addiscombe was formed in 1879.

In the 1890s, the Ashburton Estate was gradually sold for redevelopment, and Ashburton House, which had previously hosted literary figures such as Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Thomas Carlyle and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, was demolished in 1910.

===Modern Addiscombe===
Much of the land remaining in the area after the initial Victorian-era had been infilled with smaller housing developments by the 1930s. Addiscombe railway station closed in the late 1990s and was replaced by housing. Since early 2006 several parts of Addiscombe have been in the process of extensive regeneration, notably the addition of housing to the site of the former Black Horse Pub and the demolition of former Church Halls and a small garden centre in Bingham Road allowing a new Church Hall and community complex to be built and providing luxury retirement apartments on adjoining land.

The area contains a number of parks and green spaces, notably Ashburton Park and Addiscombe Recreation Ground. The main shopping area is situated along Lower Addiscombe Road, containing a variety of shops, restaurants and pubs.

==Sport==

* Addiscombe Hockey Club, Field Hockey Club based in Addiscombe
* Addiscombe Cricket Club est. 1866
* Addiscombe Cycling Club est. 1929

==Transport==

The area is currently served by four Tramlink stations - Lebanon Road, Sandilands, Addiscombe and Blackhorse Lane. Sandilands was the site of a serious derailment in 2016 which resulted in seven deaths.

Addiscombe railway station, located around 500 metres west of Addiscombe&#x27;s main shopping parade, closed in 1997 following the withdrawal of services from Elmers End. The station building was later demolished and replaced by housing (as East India Way). Part of the trackbed between Woodside and Addiscombe railway stations is now Addiscombe Railway Park. Bingham Road station also formerly served the area; it was located roughly where Addiscombe tram stop now is, before closing in 1983. The former rail station featured in the opening scenes of the 1961 Tony Hancock film &quot;The Rebel&quot;. The nearest railway station is now East Croydon.

<text>Balham () is an area in south-west London, England, in the London Borough of Wandsworth. It has been settled since Saxon times and appears in the Domesday Book as Belgeham.

The area saw significant development after the opening of Balham railway station in 1856. During World War II, Balham Underground station suffered heavy damage from air raids, killing around 64 people. In 1974, a bomb planted by the Provisional IRA exploded near government buildings in the area.

Balham is between four south London commons. The town centre features a variety of bars, restaurants, and shops, and the area is economically and culturally diverse. The Polish, Irish, Portuguese, Somali, Pakistani, and Brazilian communities are well-represented in Balham.

Notable landmarks in the area include the Bedford, a pub venue for live music and comedy, the distinctive Art Deco-designed Du Cane Court, and the Oak Lodge School for deaf children. Balham has its own library and leisure centre and was the site of the UK&#x27;s first pedestrian diagonal X-crossing. Balham station serves as an interchange between National Rail and London Underground services.

==History==

The settlement appears in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &quot;Belgeham&quot;. Bal refers to &#x27;rounded enclosure&#x27; and ham to a homestead, village or river enclosure. It was held by Geoffrey Orlateile. Its &quot;Domesday&quot; Assets were: ploughs, of meadow. It rendered (in total): £2.
The Balham area has been settled since Saxon times. Balham Hill and Balham High Road follow the line of the Roman road Stane Street to Chichester – (now the A24 road). Balham is recorded in several maps in the 1600s as Ballam or Balham Hill or Balham Manor. The village was within the parish of Streatham. Large country retreats for the affluent classes were built there in the 18th century; however, most development occurred after the opening of Balham railway station on the line to Crystal Palace in 1856.

===Second World War air raid===

On 14 October 1940 Balham Underground station was badly damaged by air raids on London during World War II. People took shelter in the tube station during the raids. A bomb fell in the High Road and through the roof of the Underground station below, bursting water and gas mains and killing around 64 people. This particular incident was featured in &quot;Atonement&quot;, a 2001 novel by Ian McEwan. An image of the aftermath is of the bus, on route 88, which had fallen into the bomb crater. All passengers, along with the driver and conductor, had escaped from the bus before it fell. The bus was hauled out of the crater after two weeks.
===Post-war===
On the morning of 17 July 1974 a 10-pound bomb planted by the Provisional IRA in a dustbin near Irene House (a Social Security office) and St Mary &amp; St John the Divine Anglican Church exploded,
shattering a four-foot wall and 50 windows. No-one was hurt.

==Geography==
Balham is overwhelmingly in Wandsworth, with only small parts in the neighbouring Borough of Lambeth and encompasses the A24 north of Tooting Bec and the roads radiating off it. The Balham SW12 postcode includes the southern part of Clapham Park otherwise known as Clapham South and the Hyde Farm area, both east of Cavendish Road and within Lambeth (historically Clapham, except for Weir Road) as well as a small detached part of Clapham south of Nightingale Lane, and part of Battersea (the roads north of Nightingale Lane). The southern part of Balham, towards Tooting Bec, near the 1930s block of Art Deco flats called Du Cane Court and the area to the south of Wandsworth Common, comes under the SW17 postcode. The Heaver Estate lies to the south of Balham in Tooting. The Estate mainly comprises substantial houses, was built in the grounds of the old Bedford Hill House and was the work of local Victorian builder, Alfred Heaver.

Balham is situated between four south London commons: Clapham Common to the north, Wandsworth Common to the west, Tooting Graveney Common to the south, and the adjoining Tooting Bec Common to the east – the latter two historically distinct areas are referred to by both Wandsworth Council and some local people as Tooting Common.

Neighbouring areas are: Battersea, Brixton, Clapham Park, Clapham South, Streatham and Tooting.

==Economy==
Balham&#x27;s town centre has a variety of bars, restaurants and shops including major chains. There are also local services, including independent stores, coffee houses and brasseries. There are two car parks serving the vicinity, one behind the Sainsbury&#x27;s (181 spaces) and one in front of Waitrose.

==Demography==

Balham is diverse both in terms of economic and cultural demographics with an increasingly professional middle class population.

The Polish population in Balham has hugely increased since 2006, though Balham has been one of the centres of the community in London since World War II. The White Eagle Club is a thriving Polish community centre, and its traditional Saturday night dance draws people from across London. Opposite the White Eagle is The Polish Roman Catholic Church of Christ the King.

The Irish, Portuguese, Somali, Pakistani and Brazilian communities are also well represented.

==Landmarks==

*The Bedford is a pub venue for live music and comedy on Bedford Hill. Performers at the Banana Cabaret have included Stephen K Amos, Omid Djalili, Harry Hill, Eddie Izzard, Al Murray and Catherine Tate. Musicians who have played include Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith. The pub has won various awards including the Publican Music Pub of the Year 2002; the Morning Advertiser Pub of the Year 2004; and the Evening Standard Pub of the Year 2002. In 1876, the pub building (then named the Bedford Hotel) housed the coroner&#x27;s inquest into the notorious unsolved murder of Charles Bravo, a resident and lawyer who was poisoned, possibly by his wife. The Priory, where the alleged murder took place, is also a landmark noted for the specific architectural style.
*The Bedford Hill area of Balham was associated with street prostitution throughout the 1970s and &#x27;80s. A project was organised for the matter in the late 2000s and since then has no longer been an issue for residents.
*Du Cane Court was the largest block of flats in Europe built for private occupation rather than as social housing at the time. Its 676 flats range from studios up to 4-bedroom penthouses. The block has had a number of notable residents, including comedian Tommy Trinder and actress Dame Margaret Rutherford. Scenes from Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot were filmed in the building.
*Oak Lodge School is a secondary school for deaf children aged 11 to 19. It accepts pupils from all over London.
* &quot;Impressions of Balham&quot; are four cold cast bronze reliefs mounted on a high brick wall on Balham Station Road. These depict local residents and everyday scenes. They were conceived and constructed by Christine Thomas and Julia Barton and installed in 1991.
*Balham has its own library and leisure centre.
*The UK&#x27;s first pedestrian diagonal X-crossing was installed at the intersection of Balham High Road, with Balham Station Road and Chestnut Grove in 2005. This was later adopted at Oxford Circus in 2009 which was the second X-crossing in the UK.
*The world&#x27;s first &quot;intelligent&quot; pedestrian crossings have also been trialled at Balham station (including Tooting Bec).
*The prominent neon sign &quot;Roberts for Ekcovision&quot; installed by a former electrical shop in the 1950s on Bedford Hill was restored in 2022.

==&quot;Balham, Gateway to the South&quot;==
For many years Balham was held up to mockery because of the comedy sketch &quot;Balham, Gateway to the South&quot;. Written by Frank Muir and Denis Norden, with Peter Sellers as the narrator, it satirised the travelogues of the day, with their faraway exotic locations, by highlighting the supposed tourist attractions of Balham in postwar austerity Britain. The title&#x27;s origin most probably alludes to a Southern Railway poster &quot;Gateway to the Continent&quot; dating from 1928 by T D Kerr. In 1979 Micky Dolenz of the Monkees directed a short film based on the sketch with Robbie Coltrane playing multiple roles. It was released for broadcast in 1981. The mockery reduced as Balham house prices soared.

==Balham Group==

In 1932, the Balham Group, the first British Trotskyist group, was expelled from the Communist Party of Great Britain and formed the Communist League.

<text>Barnes () is a district in South West London, England, part of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It takes up the extreme north-east of the borough, and as such is the closest part of the borough to central London. It is centred west south-west of Charing Cross in a bend of the River Thames.

Its built environment includes a wide variety of convenience and arts shopping on its high street and a high proportion of 18th- and 19th-century buildings in the streets near Barnes Pond. Together they make up the Barnes Village conservation area where, along with its west riverside, pictured, most of the mid-19th-century properties are concentrated. On the east riverside is the WWT London Wetland Centre adjoining Barn Elms playing fields.

Barnes has retained woodland on the &quot;Barnes Trail&quot;, a short circular walk taking in the riverside, commercial streets and conservation area, including the Olympic Studios. The trail is marked by silver discs set in the ground and with QR-coded information on distinctive oar signs. The Thames Path National Trail provides a public promenade along the entire bend of the river which is on the Championship Course in rowing.

Barnes has two railway stations (Barnes and Barnes Bridge) and is served by bus routes towards central London and Richmond.

==Geography and transport==
Barnes is in west London, bounded to the west, north, and east by a meander in the River Thames.

=== Rail ===

==== National Rail ====
Barnes is not on the London Underground network. However, it is served directly by two National Rail stations, both of which are in London&#x27;s Travelcard Zone 3:

* Barnes railway station
* Barnes Bridge railway station

Both stations are served exclusively by trains operated by South Western Railway (SWR), with trains terminating in Central London at Waterloo via Clapham Junction. Trains from Barnes and Barnes Bridge both run eastwards, providing Barnes with a direct connection to Chiswick, Brentford and Hounslow. Barnes railway station is also served by trains running southwest towards Teddington and Kingston.

Barnes railway station saw 2,548 million passenger entries or exits in 2018. Barnes Bridge was significantly quieter, with only 0.863 million passengers beginning or ending their journey at the station.

The nearest other railway stations are at Putney and Mortlake.

==== London Underground ====
There are London Underground connections in neighbouring Hammersmith, where two stations serve four lines: the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines and the District and Piccadilly lines. From Hammersmith, there are direct connections to the City and the West End. There are also direct connections to Heathrow Airport, Ealing, the East End and Rayners Lane.

=== Road ===
Barnes has two River Thames crossings, neither of which is a working road bridge. Barnes Railway Bridge is a railway bridge with an adjacent footpath. Hammersmith Bridge is a suspension bridge to the north of Barnes, built in 1887. Since 2019, it has been closed indefinitely to all motor traffic due to structural faults. This affects residents of Barnes who previously relied on the crossing.

Many of the roads in Barnes are residential, but several arterial routes pass through the district, carrying traffic across London and South East England.

The South Circular Road (A205) passes through the southern end of Barnes. It carries traffic eastbound towards Wandsworth, Clapham, the City of London and south east London. Westbound, the road carries traffic away from Central London, either towards Richmond and the M3, or directly to the M4 and the North Circular Road (A406). Kew and Chiswick are &quot;en route&quot; to the M4. The A306 runs north–south through Barnes, carried by Castelnau and Rocks Lane. Leaving Barnes to the north, the A306 crosses Hammersmith Bridge towards Hammersmith, where traffic meets the Great West Road (A4), which links to Earl&#x27;s Court and the West End. Southbound, the A306 eventually meets the A3 towards Guildford and Portsmouth. Transport for London (TfL) manages the South Circular Road and the A306 (south of Barnes only).

Barnes High Street and Church Road carry the A3003, which runs between Barnes and nearby Mortlake.

Other roads which cross the Thames nearby are Chiswick Bridge (A316) to the west and Putney Bridge (A219) to the east.

==== Air pollution ====
The London Borough of Richmond upon Thames carries out air pollution monitoring in Barnes, both kerbside and in the London Wetlands Centre. There are several sites in Barnes which measure the concentration of nitrogen dioxide () and particulate matter PM10 in the air.

A kerbsite site along Castelnau (a main road whose traffic level has greatly reduced due to the bridge closure) recorded an annual mean concentration of at 31 μg.m−3 (micrograms per cubic metre) in 2017. The annual mean concentration of PM10 was 18 μg.m−3 at the same site in the same year. Both results show that Barnes&#x27; air is the cleanest it has been since 2011, at least. The Wetlands monitoring site recorded far lower (i.e. cleaner) results than Castelnau did in 2017, with an annual mean concentration at 21 μg.m−3, and a mean reading of 15 μg.m−3 for PM10. A monitoring site on Barnes High Street recorded more polluted air than the other, with levels at 43.0 μg.m−3 (annual mean, 2017). This site therefore failed to meet the UK National Air Quality Objective of 40 μg m−3 (annual mean) for .

=== Buses ===
Barnes is served by London Buses 33, 209, 265, 378, 419, 485, 533 and N22.

The closure of Hammersmith Bridge has severely impacted connections to Hammersmith.

=== Cycling ===
Two key cycling routes pass through Barnes:

* National Cycle Route 4 (NCR 4) – this signed cycle route from Greenwich to Fishguard, West Wales, runs mainly on shared-use paths or residential streets but, in Barnes, it follows Rocks Lane (A306) for a short distance. For cyclists in Barnes, the route provides an unbroken, albeit indirect, route towards Waterloo via Putney and Chelsea. To the west, NCR 4 passes through Roehampton, Richmond Park and Kingston upon Thames.
* London Cycle Network 37 – Many signs in Barnes still remain along this route, which is part of the discontinued London Cycle Network. The route runs eastbound towards Wandsworth, Vauxhall and the City, or westbound towards Mortlake and Richmond.

Cycles can cross the Thames in Barnes using either Hammersmith Bridge or Barnes Bridge (dismounting to use the footpath). Cycling is permitted along the shared-use path on the southern bank of the Thames between Hammersmith Bridge and Putney Bridge.

=== River Thames ===
The river follows Barnes&#x27; northern border. The Thames Path passes through Barnes, following the banks of the river.

Transport for London (TfL), in conjunction with Thames Clippers (branded as Uber Boat), run riverboat services from nearby Putney Pier to Blackfriars, weekday morning and evenings only. This connects the Barnes area to Chelsea, Battersea, Westminster, Embankment and the City. A summer river tour, operated by Thames River Boats, runs from Kew Pier to Westminster, or Richmond and Hampton Court. None of these services stops in Barnes.

Because of the closure of Hammersmith Bridge, a temporary ferry between Barnes and Hammersmith was proposed in 2021.
This plan was never implemented.

==History==

Barnes appears in &quot;Domesday Book&quot; (which was completed in 1086) as &quot;Berne&quot;. It was held by the Canons of St Paul of London when its assets were: eight hides, paying tax with Mortlake; six ploughlands, of meadow. It rendered (in total) to its feudal system overlords £7 per year.

In 1889, Barnes became part of the Municipal Borough of Barnes. In 1965, that borough was abolished and Barnes became part of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.

===Notable buildings===
The original Norman chapel of St Mary&#x27;s, Barnes&#x27; village church, was built at some point between 1100 and 1150, and was subsequently extended in the early 13th century. In 1215, immediately after confirming the sealing of Magna Carta, Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury, stopped on the river at Barnes to dedicate St Mary&#x27;s church. The church was added to in 1485 and in 1786. After a major fire in 1978 destroyed the Victorian and Edwardian additions to the building, restoration work was completed in 1984.

Some of the oldest riverside housing in London is to be found on The Terrace, a road lined with Georgian mansions which runs along the west bend of the river. Construction of these mansions began as early as 1720. Gustav Holst and Ninette de Valois lived in houses on this stretch, both of which have corresponding blue plaques. The Terrace also has an original red brick police station, built in 1891. It has been remodelled as flats but still preserves the original features.

The pink-fronted Rose House at 70 Barnes High Street, facing the area&#x27;s pond, dates to the 17th century, while Milbourne House facing the Green, the oldest in the area with parts dating to the 16th century, once belonged to Henry Fielding. The park of Barn Elms, formerly the manor house of Barnes, for long the parish&#x27;s chief property and now an open space and playing field, is home to one of the oldest and largest plane trees in London, one of the Great Trees of London.

The Grade II listed Barnes Railway Bridge, originally constructed in 1849 by Joseph Locke, dominates the view of the river from the Terrace.

Castelnau, in north Barnes and on the banks of the river, has a small church, Holy Trinity. The area between Castelnau and Lonsdale Road contains a 1930s council estate (including roads such as Nowell Road, Stillingfleet Road and Washington Road), mostly consisting of &quot;Boot houses&quot;, constructed by the Henry Boot company.

==Economy==
A 2014 survey found that Barnes had the highest proportion of independent shops of any area in Britain, at 96.6%.

==Barnes Common and the London Wetland Centre==
Barnes Common is an important open space and a local nature reserve. Its dominate the south of Barnes, providing a rural setting to the village and a wealth of habitats including acid grassland, scrub, woodland and wetland. Beverley Brook passes through part of the common before meeting the Thames at Putney.

In April 2001, Barnes Pond dramatically emptied overnight. Although a broken drain was suspected, no cause could be conclusively found. The pond was redeveloped and landscaped with funding from Richmond Council and the local community.

Barn Elms reservoirs were turned into a wetland habitat and bird sanctuary in 1995. The majority of the WWT London Wetland Centre comprises areas of standing open water, grazing marsh and reed bed. It is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest as it supports nationally important wintering populations of shoveller (&quot;Anas clypeata&quot;) and teal (&quot;Anas crecca&quot;).

==Landmarks, trails and events==
The Barnes Trail, a 2.3-mile circular walk funded by the Mayor of London and Richmond upon Thames Council, was opened in June 2013. It gained in 2014 a further QR code-marked extension, along its riverside, which equates to the Thames Path National Trail; part of this is wide, pavemented embankments with Victorian townhouses and the rest is tree-lined green space.

The site of rock musician Marc Bolan&#x27;s fatal car crash on Queen&#x27;s Ride in 1977 is now Bolan&#x27;s Rock Shrine. The memorial receives frequent visits from his fans, and in 1997 a bronze bust of Bolan was installed to mark the twentieth anniversary of his death. In 2007, the site was recognised by the English Tourist Board as a &quot;Site of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Importance&quot; in its guide &quot;England Rocks&quot;.

Olympic Studios on Church Road is an independent cinema, showing a mixture of films on general release and art films. Originally a local cinema and for many years a leading recording studio, down the decades Olympic played host to some of the greatest stars in the history of popular music.

In 1967&#x27;s Summer of Love, it was at Olympic in Barnes that the Beatles conceived the first parts and ideas of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, one of the most influential popular songs in modern history, which debuted a fortnight later in &quot;Our World&quot;, the first ever global satellite broadcast to millions worldwide.

The Rolling Stones later went on to become such frequent visitors that Mick Jagger gradually designed part of the studio&#x27;s features himself, while Jimi Hendrix also spent a significant proportion of his entire recording career in the quiet surroundings of Barnes, recording tracks for all three of his studio albums there. Led Zeppelin recorded their debut album and much other material at the studio, from the late 1960s into the mid-1970s. The Who, Queen, Pink Floyd, David Bowie, Ray Charles, Eric Clapton, Shirley Bassey, Ella Fitzgerald, Harry Nilsson, the Verve, Massive Attack, Duran Duran, Coldplay, Prince, Madonna, Adele, and Björk were among the many other visitors.

Facing the Thames, and on the main commercial street&#x27;s junction, the Bull&#x27;s Head pub was also one of the first jazz venues in Britain, and now hosts live music in an attached music room with capacity for 80 people.

The OSO Arts Centre, which opened in 2002, is a venue for art and fringe theatre, hosting numerous exhibitions and theatre productions, as well as a regular auction. The building was previously the postal sorting office, but was redeveloped into a mixture of residential and commercial space with the first residents moving there in 1999.

The area around Barnes Pond is host to several open-air and covered markets each month. Barnes Green is the site of the Barnes Fair, held each year on the second Saturday of July and organised by the Barnes Community Association (BCA), whose headquarters are at Rose House, a distinctive 17th-century pink-painted building on Barnes High Street.

In 2015, Barnes Pond became home to London&#x27;s largest dedicated children&#x27;s book event, the Barnes Children&#x27;s Literature Festival, which is now the second largest in Europe.

==Places of worship==

Barnes has seven churches, of which six are members of Churches Together in Barnes:
*Barnes Baptist Church
*Barnes Healing Church (&quot;Christian Spiritualist&quot;)
*Barnes Methodist Church
*Catholic Church of St Osmund, Barnes
*Holy Trinity Barnes (&quot;Church of England&quot;)
*St Mary&#x27;s Church, Barnes (&quot;Church of England&quot;)
*St Michael and All Angels Church, Barnes (&quot;Church of England&quot;)

==Societies==

The Barnes and Mortlake History Society, founded in 1955 by local resident Maurice Cockin as the Borough of Barnes History Society, promotes interest in the local history of Barnes, Mortlake and East Sheen. It organises a programme of lectures and other activities on historical topics and publishes a quarterly newsletter.

==Sport==
;Association football

Barnes has a place in the history of football. First, a former High Master of St Paul&#x27;s School, Richard Mulcaster, is credited with taking mob football and turning it into an organised, refereed team sport that was considered beneficial for schoolboys. St Paul&#x27;s School is currently sited on Lonsdale Road, although in Mulcaster&#x27;s time it was at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in the City of London.

Barnes was also home to Ebenezer Cobb Morley, who in 1862 was a founding member of the Football Association. In 1863, he wrote to the weekly sporting newspaper &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life&quot; proposing a governing body for football, and this led to the first meeting at the Freemasons&#x27; Tavern where the FA was created. He was the FA&#x27;s first secretary (1863–66) and at his home in Barnes he set out the first set of rules for modern football; these were adopted by the FA and subsequently spread throughout the world. As a player, he took part in the first match played according to today&#x27;s rules. Morley may be considered the father of football for his key role in establishing modern association football.
;Rugby
Barnes Rugby Football Club&#x27;s ground, known as Barn Elms, is next to the WWT London Wetlands Centre.
;Rowing
In rowing, the loop of the Thames surrounding Barnes forms part of the Championship Course used for the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race and the main national head races, the Head of the River Races, for each category of Olympic boat. Three rowing clubs are across Barnes Bridge, which can be crossed by foot and St Paul&#x27;s School boat from Barnes. A statue of Steve Fairbairn, who revolutionised technique and equipment in the sport, is by the river close to the London Wetlands Centre in the district.

==Education==
==Notable residents==
==Demography and housing==
To give an equal councillor number and electorate, the wards in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames are multi-councillor but aim to be equally sized. To achieve this, approximately half of one of the two wards covering modern Barnes also falls within the boundaries of neighbouring Mortlake.

<text>Barnsbury is an area of north London in the London Borough of Islington, within the N1 and N7 postal districts.

==History==
The name is a syncopated form of &quot;Bernersbury&quot; (1274), being so called after the Berners family: powerful medieval manorial lords who gained ownership of a large part of Islington after the Norman Conquest. The area of Barnsbury was predominantly rural until the early 19th century.

By the end of the 18th century, Barnsbury, like other parts of Islington, was regarded as an attractive part-rural suburb by the comparatively wealthy people wanting to move out of the cramped City of London and industrial Clerkenwell. The area is close to the city, and had strong local trade in its position as the first staging post for travellers making the journey from London to the north, and with considerable agricultural traffic and cattle driving to the nearby Smithfield cattle market in the city.

Barnard Park, consisting of 10 acres (4 hectares) including a large area of football pitches, was created in 1967 on an area of housing that had been bombed during World War Two, and was named after former Islington Mayor Cllr George Barnard.

Pentonville Prison (built 1842) is located within Barnsbury.

==Governance==
Since 2006, Barnsbury electoral ward has been represented by three Labour councillors.

== Notable people ==
* Gillian Anderson (born 1968), actress, activist and writer
* Tony and Cherie Blair, former Prime Minister and his wife, lived in Barnsbury with their family.
* Michael Faraday (1791–1867), chemist
* Owen Jones (born 1984), Labour activist
* Enid Marx (1902–1998) painter and designer, known for industrial textile designs for the London Transport Board and the Utility furniture Scheme.
* Ivor Moreton (1908–1984), pianist and singer, born in Barnsbury

<text>Battersea is a large district in southwest London, part of the London Borough of Wandsworth, England. It is centred southwest of Charing Cross it also extends along the south bank of the Thames Tideway. It includes the Battersea Park.

==History==

Battersea is mentioned in the few surviving Anglo-Saxon geographical accounts as and later . As with many former parishes beside tidal flood plains the lowest land was reclaimed for agriculture by draining marshland and building culverts for streams. By the side of this was the Heathwall tide mill in the north-east with a very long mill pond regularly draining and filling to the south.

The settlement appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as , a vast manor held by St Peter&#x27;s Abbey, Westminster. Its &quot;Domesday&quot; Assets were: 18 hides and 17 ploughlands of cultivated land; 7 mills worth £42 9s 8d per year, of meadow, woodland worth 50 hogs. It rendered (in total): £75 9s 8d.

The present church, which was completed in 1777, hosted the marriage of William Blake and Catherine Boucher in 1782. Benedict Arnold, his wife Peggy Shippen, and their daughter were buried in the crypt of the church.

Battersea Park, a northern rectangle by the Thames, was landscaped and founded for public use in 1858. Amenities and leisure buildings have been added to it since.

Until 1889, the parish of Battersea was part of the county of Surrey. In that year a new County of London came into being and the parish was made part of it.

===Agriculture===
Before the Industrial Revolution, much of the large parish was farmland, providing food for the City of London and surrounding population centres; and with particular specialisms, such as growing lavender on Lavender Hill (nowadays denoted by the road of the same name), asparagus (sold as &quot;Battersea Bundles&quot;) or pig breeding on Pig Hill (later the site of the Shaftesbury Park Estate). At the end of the 18th century, above of land in the parish of Battersea were occupied by some 20 market gardeners, who rented from five to near each. Villages in the wider area: Wandsworth, Earlsfield (hamlet of Garratt), Tooting, Balham – were separated by fields; in common with other suburbs the wealthy of London and the traditional manor successors built their homes in Battersea and neighbouring areas.

===Industry===

Industry in the area was concentrated to the northwest just outside the Battersea-Wandsworth boundary, at the confluence of the River Thames and the River Wandle, which gave rise to the village of Wandsworth. This was settled from the 16th century by Protestant craftsmen – Huguenots – fleeing religious persecution in Europe, who planted lavender and gardens and established a range of industries such as mills, breweries and dyeing, bleaching and calico printing. Industry developed eastwards along the bank of the Thames during the Industrial Revolution from the 1750s onwards; the Thames provided water for transport, for steam engines and for water-intensive industrial processes. Bridges erected across the Thames encouraged growth; Putney Bridge, a mile to the west, was built in 1729 and rebuilt 1882, and Battersea Bridge in the centre of the north boundary in 1771. Inland from the river, the rural agricultural community persisted.

Along the Thames, a number of large and, in their field, pre-eminent firms grew; notably the Morgan Crucible company, which survives to this day and is listed on the London Stock Exchange; Price&#x27;s Candles, which also made cycle lamp oil; oil refiner and paint manufacturer S. Bowley and Son; and Orlando Jones&#x27; Starch Factory. The 1874 Ordnance Survey map of the area shows the following factories, in order, from the site of the as yet unbuilt Wandsworth Bridge to Battersea Park: Starch manufacturer; Silk manufacturer; (St. John&#x27;s College); (St. Mary&#x27;s Church); Malt house; Corn mill; Oil and grease works (Prices Candles); Chemical works; Plumbago Crucible works (later the Morgan Crucible Company); Chemical works; Saltpetre works; Foundry. Between these were numerous wharfs for shipping.

In 1929, construction started on Battersea Power Station, being completed in 1939. From the late 18th century to comparatively recent times, Battersea was established as an industrial area with all of the issues associated with pollution and poor housing affecting it.

Industry declined and moved away from the area in the 1970s, and local government sought to address chronic post-war housing problems with large scale clearances and the establishment of planned housing. Some decades after the end of large scale local industry, resurgent demand among magnates and high income earners for parkside and riverside property close to planned Underground links has led to significant construction, Factories have been demolished and replaced with modern apartment buildings. Some of the council owned properties have been sold off and several traditional working men&#x27;s pubs have become more fashionable bistros. Battersea neighbourhoods close to the railway have some of the most deprived local authority housing in the Borough of Wandsworth, in an area which saw condemned slums after their erection in the Victoria era.

===Railway age===

Battersea was radically altered by the coming of railways. The London and Southampton Railway Company engineered their railway line from east to west through Battersea, in 1838, terminating at the original Nine Elms railway station at the north east tip of the area. Over the next 22 years five other lines were built, which continue to carry all of the trains to and from London&#x27;s Waterloo and Victoria termini. An interchange station was built in 1863 towards the north west of the area, at a junction of the railway. Taking the name of a fashionable village a mile and more away, the station was named &#x27;Clapham Junction&#x27;: a campaign to rename it &quot;Battersea Junction&quot; fizzled out as late as the early twentieth century.

During the latter decades of the nineteenth century Battersea had developed into a major town railway centre with two locomotive works at Nine Elms and Longhedge and three important motive power depots (Nine Elms, Stewarts Lane and Battersea) all in an initial pocket of north Battersea. The effect was precipitate: a population of 6,000 people in 1840 was increased to 168,000 by 1910; and save for the green spaces of Battersea Park, Clapham Common, Wandsworth Common and some smaller isolated pockets, all other farmland was built over, with, from north to south, industrial buildings and vast railway sheds and sidings (much of which remain), slum housing for workers, especially north of the main east–west railway, and gradually more genteel residential terraced housing further south.

The railway station encouraged the government to site its buildings in the area surrounding Clapham Junction, where a cluster of new civic buildings including the town hall, library, police station, court and post office was developed along Lavender Hill in the 1880s and 1890s. The Arding &amp; Hobbs department store, diagonally opposite the station, was the largest of its type at the time of its construction in 1885; and the streets near the station developed as a regional shopping district. The area was served by a vast music hallThe Grandopposite the station (nowadays serving as a nightclub and venue for smaller bands) as well as a large theatre next to the town hall (the Shakespeare Theatre, later redeveloped following bomb damage). All this building around the station shifted the focus of the area southwards, and marginalised Battersea High Street (the main street of the original village) into no more than an extension of Falcon Road.

===Social housing estates===

Battersea has a long and varied history of social housing, and the completion of the Shaftesbury Park Estate in 1877 was one of the earliest in London or the UK. Additionally, the development of the Latchmere Estate in 1903 was notable both for John Burns&#x27; involvement and for being the first estate directly built by a council&#x27;s own workforce and therefore the first true &quot;council estate&quot;. Indeed, both of these earlier estates have since been recognised as conservation areas due to their historical and architectural significance and are protected from redevelopment.

Battersea also has a large area of mid-20th century public housing estates, almost all located north of the main railway lines and spanning from Fairfield in the west to Queenstown in the east.

There are four particularly large estates. The Winstanley Estate, perhaps being the most renowned of them all, is known as being the birthplace to the garage collective So Solid Crew. Winstanley is close to Clapham Junction railway station in the northern perimeter of Battersea, and is currently being considered for comprehensive redevelopment as one of the London Mayor&#x27;s new Housing Zones. Further north towards Chelsea is the Surrey Lane Estate, and on Battersea Park Road is the Doddington and Rollo Estate. East, toward Vauxhall, is the Patmore Estate which is in close proximity to the Battersea Power Station.

Other smaller estates include: York Road (see Winstanley Estate), Ashley Crescent, Badric Court, Carey Gardens, Chatham Road, Ethelburga, Falcon Road, Gideon Road, Honeywell Road, Kambala, Peabody, Robertson Street, Savona, Somerset, Wilditch and Wynter Street.

===World War I: The Battersea Battalion===

On the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, issued his famous call to arms: &#x27;Your King and Country Need You&#x27;. But the flood of volunteers overwhelmed the ability of the Army to absorb them, and units began to be raised by local initiative rather than at regimental depots, often from men from particular localities or backgrounds who wished to serve together: these were known as &#x27;Pals battalions&#x27;. The &#x27;Pals&#x27; phenomenon quickly spread across the country, as local recruiting committees offered complete units. Encouraged by this response, Kitchener approached the 28 Metropolitan boroughs of the County of London, and the &#x27;Great Metropolitan Recruiting Campaign&#x27; went ahead in April 1915, with each mayor asked to raise a unit of local men. 

One such unit was raised on 3 June 1915 by the Mayor and Borough of Battersea as the 10th (Service) Battalion, Queen&#x27;s (Royal West Surrey Regiment) (Battersea). (Although Battersea was by then in the County of London, the Queen&#x27;s (Royal West Surrey Regiment) was still the Regular Army regiment covering South London, while the London Regiment, including the 23rd Battalion based at Clapham Junction, consisted entirely of part-time soldiers of the Territorial Force (TF).)

The Battersea Battalion served alongside Pals battalions from Lambeth (11th Queens), Bermondsey (12th East Surreys) and Lewisham (10th West Kents) in 41st Division on the Western Front, including the battles of the Somme, Messines, and Ypres, on the Italian Front, and then back in the west against the German spring offensive and in the final victorious Hundred Days Offensive. The Battersea Battalion was kept up to strength with dismounted cavalrymen from the Surrey Yeomanry (TF), based at Clapham Park. After the Armistice it took part in the Occupation of the Rhineland and was finally disbanded in 1920.

==Governance==


The tradition of local government in England was based in part of Manor, and later on the Parish. Battersea&#x27;s governance can be traced back to 693, when the manor was held by the nunnery of St. Mary at Barking Abbey. After the Norman Conquest of 1066, control of the manor passed to Westminster Abbey, ending at the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540. Battersea was one of only three of the Abbey&#x27;s demesne directly supervised by monks, rather than being let to tenants. Local control rested with an officer appointed by the abbey, variously termed a beadle, reeve or sergeant, whose responsibility it was supervise the farm servants of the manor, and to enforce and direct customary work performed by manorial tenants.

After 1540 the Crown assumed ownership of the manor, and let it on short leases to a succession of individuals, until in about 1590 it came into the hands of the St. John family of Lydiard Tregoze in Wiltshire, who later became the St John Baronets of Lydiard Tregoze and ultimately the Viscounts Bolingbroke. Bolingbrokes exercised control of the manor for some 173 years, showing varying levels of interest and competence in running the estate&#x27;s affairs, until in 1763 the disastrously dissolute Frederick St John, 2nd Viscount Bolingbroke sold the manor to help to settle his many debts. Battersea now passed into the Spencer family - John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer being related to Frederick&#x27;s wife.

The Survey of London identified the period of Frederick&#x27;s tenure with the development of the Vestry in Battersea; absent a competent lord of the manor, this local secular and ecclesiastical government took it upon itself to establish a workhouse in 1733, and met monthly from 1742.

The period of Spencer ownership of the manor saw important land ownership changes introduced to the area. The family had many estates, such as at Althorp in Northamptonshire and Wiseton in Nottinghamshire. Locally, their interests were concentrated on Wimbledon. During their tenure, large tracts of land were sold, notably around 1761, and from 1835 to 1838, leading to the development of a plurality of smaller estates, which had implications for the later development of the area.

The scope of governance throughout this period was relatively slight. Lords of the manor were responsible for church appointments and maintenance of the fabric of the church; for drainage, and for the direction of the duties of the manor&#x27;s tenants. From time to time work was done under manorial direction on the Thames foreshore; and a Spencer was responsible for the construction of first local bridge across the Thames, Battersea Bridge from 1771 to 1772. And albeit Battersea saw some slow change over the first seven centuries of the second millennium, it was not until a later period that an imperative for greater local government arose.

The vestry of Battersea continued to increase in importance from 1742, notably concerning itself with Poor Law administration and drainage. Responsibility for the latter was removed from the vestry in 1855 with the establishment of Metropolitan Boards of Work under the Metropolis Management Act 1855; a Metropolitan Board concerned itself with cross-London drainage and sewerage, whilst a local Wandsworth Metropolitan Board assumed responsibility for minor sewers and the connection of houses to sewerage systems. It was during the tenure of the Wandsworth board that much of Battersea was developed; but such was the pace of development in Battersea that by 1887 it had a population sufficient to win the case for renewed local autonomy under the Metropolis Management (Battersea and Westminster) Act of 1887. The Battersea vestry continued through to 1899, when it became the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea as a result of the London Government Act 1899.

The Metropolitan Borough of Battersea was in 1965 combined with the neighbouring Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth to form the London Borough of Wandsworth. The former Battersea Town Hall, opened in 1893, is now the Battersea Arts Centre.

In the period from 1880 onwards, Battersea was known as a centre of radical politics in the United Kingdom. John Burns founded a branch of the Social Democratic Federation, Britain&#x27;s first organised socialist political party, in the borough and after the turmoil of dock strikes affecting the populace of north Battersea, was elected to represent the borough in the newly formed London County Council. In 1892, he expanded his role, being elected to Parliament for Battersea North as one of the first Independent Labour Party members of Parliament.

Battersea&#x27;s radical reputation gave rise to the Brown Dog affair, when in 1904 the National Anti-Vivisection Society sought permission to erect a drinking fountain celebrating the life of a dog killed by vivisection. The fountain, forming a plinth for the statue of a brown dog, was installed in the Latchmere Recreation Ground, became a cause célèbre, fought over in riots and battles between medical students and the local populace until its removal in 1910.

The borough elected the first black mayor in London in 1913 when John Archer took office, and in 1922 elected the Bombay-born Communist Party member Shapurji Saklatvala as MP for Battersea; one of only two communist members of Parliament.

Battersea is currently divided into five Wandsworth wards. The Member of Parliament for the Battersea constituency since 8 June 2017 has been Labour MP Marsha de Cordova.

==Geography==
Battersea is on the curved south bank of the River Thames.

===Riverside===
Battersea&#x27;s northern limit is thus the Tideway, the Thames below Teddington. Battersea&#x27;s riverside is just over long. Immediately to the west is Wandsworth Town. To the north-east are Vauxhall and then Lambeth, including Waterloo.

===Other boundaries===
Battersea at one end of its riverside has a western corner at a point 350 metres east northeast of Wandsworth Bridge, and Battersea tapers SSE to almost a point, roughly from Battersea&#x27;s northeastern corner – but from the western corner.

===Neighbouring districts===
To the east are South Lambeth and Stockwell; to the south is Balham; to the southeast is Clapham; and to the west is Wandsworth Town, south of which is Wandsworth.

Two large neighbourhoods within the larger Battersea are:
*Clapham Junction (the central and most commercial part of Battersea),
*Nine Elms (to the north-east, east of Battersea Park)

==Crime==
Some parts of Battersea have become known for drug-dealing. The Winstanley and York Road council estates have developed a reputation for such offences and were included in a zero-tolerance &quot;drug exclusion zone&quot; in 2007.

==Demography==
, Battersea had a population of 73,345. The district was 52.2% of White British origin, as against an average for Wandsworth of 53.3%.

==Landmarks==

Within the bounds of modern Battersea are (from east to west):

*New Covent Garden Market, a major fruit and vegetable wholesale market, resited from Covent Garden in 1974. (Also considered by many to be in Nine Elms).
*Battersea Power Station, an iconic edifice designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, built between 1929 and 1939 (featured, with flying pig, on the sleeve art of Pink Floyd&#x27;s album &quot;Animals&quot;). Since 2021, the power station&#x27;s disused shell has housed a mass entertainments and commercial complex, with dedicated transport links provided by Battersea Power Station tube station, which terminates an extension of the Northern line from Kennington via Nine Elms tube station. 
*Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, formerly &quot;Battersea Dogs Home&quot; and prior to that the &quot;Temporary Home for Lost and Starving Dogs&quot;, established in Holloway in 1860 and moved to Battersea in 1871. It is the United Kingdom&#x27;s most famous refuge for stray dogs. Also the main location for ITV 1&#x27;s &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady: For the Love of Dogs&quot;
*Battersea Park, a 200-acre green space laid out by Sir James Pennethorne between 1846 and 1864 and opened in 1858, and home to a zoo and the London Peace Pagoda.

*Battersea Arts Centre, in the former Battersea Town Hall
*Northcote Road, a bustling and famous local shopping street with its own market at the centre of the so-called Nappy Valley.
*Clapham Junction railway station, by at least one measure – passenger interchanges— the busiest station in the United Kingdom and named after the neighbouring town of Clapham although it lies in the geographic heart of Battersea, SW11.
*Arding &amp; Hobbs building, completed in 1912, occupied by TK Maxx and Debenhams until the latter&#x27;s dissolution in June 2021.

==Transport==

=== National Rail ===
Battersea is served by three National Rail stations: Battersea Park, Clapham Junction, and Queenstown Road (Battersea). All three stations are in London Travelcard Zone 2.

==== Battersea Park ====
Battersea Park is served by some Southern trains.

Trains northbound terminate at London Victoria, which is the next stop along the line. Southbound, Southern&#x27;s &quot;metro&quot; services run to Clapham Junction, Wandsworth Common, and Balham. After Balham, trains head towards Croydon, Epsom, London Bridge, and Sutton, amongst other destinations.

The first station to carry the name &quot;Battersea Park&quot; was opened by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) as &quot;Battersea&quot; on 1 October 1860 and was located at the southern end of what is now Grosvenor Bridge. It closed on 1 November 1870. The LB&amp;SCR opened another station on a high-level line on 1 May 1867 called Battersea Park. Another station existed closed to the current station called Battersea Park Road railway station by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway in 1867 and closed in 1916.

==== Clapham Junction ====
The largest railway station in Battersea is Clapham Junction, to the southwest of the district. The station is a busy interchange, and it serves destinations across London, the South, and South West England. Train operators from Clapham Junction include:

* London Overground, which operates trains northbound towards Stratford, calling at major destinations such as Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, Willesden Junction, Camden Road, and Hackney Central. London Overground also runs trains eastbound towards Dalston, passing through Clapham, Denmark Hill, Peckham, Canada Water, and Whitechapel along the way.
* Southern, which principally operates northbound services towards London Victoria. Southbound services run to destinations such as Balham, Brighton, Croydon, Epsom, and Gatwick Airport (). Southern also operates a service towards Milton Keynes from East Croydon.

<text>Bayswater is an area in the City of Westminster in West London. It is a built-up district with a population density of 17,500 per square kilometre, and is located between Kensington Gardens to the south, Paddington to the north-east, and Notting Hill to the west.

Much of Bayswater was built in the 1800s, and consists of streets and garden squares lined with Victorian stucco terraces; some of which have been subdivided into flats. Other key developments include the Grade II listed 650-flat Hallfield Estate, designed by Sir Denys Lasdun, and Queensway and Westbourne Grove, its busiest high streets, with a mix of independent, boutique and chain retailers and restaurants.

Bayswater is also one of London&#x27;s most cosmopolitan areas: a diverse local population is augmented by a high concentration of hotels. In addition to the English, there are many other nationalities. Notable ethnic groups include Greeks, French, Americans, Irish, Italians, Brazilians, and Arabs, amongst others.

==Etymology==
The name Bayswater is derived from the 1380 placename &quot;Bayards Watering Place&quot;, which in Middle English meant either a watering place for horses, or the watering place that belonged to the Bayard family.

==History==
Historically, Bayswater was located to the west of London on the road from Tyburn towards Uxbridge. It was a hamlet in the seventeenth century close to the Kensington Gravel Pits. By the end of the eighteenth century Bayswater remained a small settlement, although the gradual expansion of London westward into Mayfair and Paddington brought it closer to the outskirts of the city. During the Regency era new suburbs were rapidly constructed to cope with the growing population of the city. An important early developer in Bayswater was Edward Orme who constructed Moscow Road and St. Petersburgh Place, which he named in honour of Alexander I of Russia. Both Bayswater and Tyburnia to the east developed independently of each other. Gradually over the following decades the remaining open spaces were built on and it became an urban area of affluent residential streets and garden squares.

<text>Becontree ( or ) is an area of approximately in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham. It is located east-northeast of Charing Cross and was constructed in the interwar period as the largest public housing estate in the world. The Housing Act 1919 permitted the London County Council to build housing outside the County of London and Becontree was constructed between 1921 and 1935 to cottage estate principles in the parishes of Barking, Dagenham and Ilford, then in the administrative and ceremonial county of Essex. The official completion of the estate was celebrated in 1935, by which time the estate had a population of around 100,000 people in 26,000 homes.

The building of the estate caused a huge increase in population density, which led to demands on services and reforms of local government. An additional 1,000 houses were added in later phases. The estate had no industrial and very little commercial development until the May &amp; Baker and Ford Dagenham sites opened nearby, and a shopping area was built at Heathway. The estate has formed part of Greater London since 1965, when the Barking section was combined with Dagenham, and has been within a single London borough since boundary changes caused the Ilford section to be transferred from Redbridge to Barking and Dagenham in 1994.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The estate is named after the ancient Becontree Hundred, which historically covered the area. It is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name is Old English and means &#x27;tree of a man named Beohha&#x27;. The tree would have stood on Becontree Heath, just outside the eastern boundary of the estate. The majority of the estate was in the parish of Dagenham and the whole estate is in the Dagenham post town, and the two names are used interchangeably.

===Building of the estate===
Because of the lack of available land in the County of London, the Housing Act 1919 permitted the London County Council (LCC) to build housing and act as landlord outside of its territory. On 18 June 1919 the London County Council&#x27;s Standing Committee on the Housing of the Working Classes resolved to build 29,000 dwellings to accommodate 145,000 people within 5 years, of which 24,000 were to be at Becontree. Becontree was developed between 1921 and 1935 as a large cottage estate of around 26,000 homes, intended to be &quot;homes fit for heroes&quot; for World War I veterans.

Most of the land at that time was market gardens, with occasional groups of cottages and some country lanes. It was compulsorily purchased. 4,000 houses had been completed by 1921. The early residents were able to pick rhubarb, peas and cabbages from the abandoned market gardens.

The very first houses completed, in Chittys Lane, are recognisable by a blue council plaque embedded in the wall. The construction was an enormous civil engineering project. A special railway was built especially for the building work. It connected the railway sidings at Goodmayes on the Great Eastern line and a wharf with a new 500 ft jetty, on the River Thames. Four steam cranes on the jetty could unload building material from seven barges at a time. The building of the estate took longer than anticipated. The LCC hoped to build 24,000 homes by 1924. They were only able to achieve 3,000 and the works were extended into three phases lasting until 1935.

On 13 July 1935 the official completion of the estate was celebrated with the ceremonial opening of Parsloes Park by MP Christopher Addison. However, the demand for housing meant that a further 800 homes were built in 1937. With a population of 115,652, it was the largest public housing development in the world. After the Second World War, between 1949 and 1951, 600 additional houses were built by the LCC in Dagenham in an area called Heath Park, adjacent to the estate.

Wythenshawe, in Manchester with an area of approximately , is larger but the population density is lower. At times Wythenshawe has also claimed to be the largest council housing estate in Europe. Private home ownership in the area has grown, and Wythenshawe has continued to expand.
===First tenants===
The LCC built the estate to rehouse people from London&#x27;s East End, who were displaced by slum clearance. The first residents were almost all relatively prosperous working-class families, such as factory workers and busmen. Prospective tenants were interviewed by London County Council officials in their homes to check their suitability and the size of family, their domestic standards and financial resources. The tenants came from the skilled working class in relatively secure jobs and earning slightly more than the average wage. At the time everyone marvelled at having indoor toilets and a private garden, although the sash windows were extremely draughty, there was no insulation in the attics, and during the winter months very few people could afford enough coal to heat the bedrooms. The toilet, bath tap and a tap in the kitchen over a copper boiler, which was used for both washing clothes and heating bath water, were all fed from a reservoir tank in the attic, which invariably froze on winter mornings, leaving the toilets unusable. One clause in the contract of tenancy stipulated that children born to parents living on the estate would not be housed by the LCC and when the time came for them to establish their own homes, the relevant local authority would be expected to provide housing.

Privet hedges (referred to as &quot;evergreens&quot; or &quot;evers&quot;) were planted along the pavements at the end of every front garden and during the spring and summer months a squad of gardeners were employed to keep them in regulation height. Although the estate regulations stipulated that the gardens must be maintained in order, more than a few degenerated into virtual jungles. However, to encourage the application of this rule, prizes were awarded for the best kept gardens. Initial candidates were selected by the rent collectors during their weekly rounds and a committee decided on the final prizes, which ranged from ten shillings consolation prizes up to £20 (an average week&#x27;s rent in 1953 was about £1 18/- (£1.90)) for the first prize in each ward, plus a notice placed in the centre of the lawn for the benefit of passers-by.

===Local government===
When built, the development occupied parts of the parishes of Barking, Dagenham and Ilford, with administration split between the three respective urban district councils. Barking and Ilford were established as suburbs of London and had been urban districts since 1894. Dagenham was almost entirely rural until the building of the estate, having a population of only 9,127 in 1911 and growing to 89,362 in ten years. It gained urban district status in 1926. Approximately 50% of the estate was in Dagenham, 33% in Barking and 17% in Ilford. Ilford was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1926, Barking in 1931 and Dagenham in 1938. Services such as education and libraries were provided by Essex County Council throughout the estate. However, the division of responsibilities allowed for the local councils to provide elementary education in their areas as their populations were high enough. Before the Second World War Barking and Ilford, but not Dagenham, were providing elementary education. However, Dagenham was permitted to provide its own library service. After the Second World War Dagenham also provided elementary education. During the 1920s and 1930s there was periodic discussion and review of the local government arrangements in the area, including proposals to merge the three districts, or transfer the estate to the County of London, but it was not acted on.

The area was within the Metropolitan Police District. It was considered to form part of the Greater London conurbation for census reporting and in 1957 formed part of the review area of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London. The 1960 report of the commission recommended that Barking and Dagenham should form as a single London borough and this became the London Borough of Barking in 1965 following the London Government Act 1963. Ilford became part of the new London Borough of Redbridge. Barking was renamed Barking and Dagenham in 1980. It was anticipated that the mergers of existing boroughs might produce unsatisfactory boundaries in some places and a Local Government Boundary Commission for England was established by the Local Government Act 1972 to review periodically the boundaries of Greater London and the London boroughs. The first review of boundaries in London commenced on 1 April 1987 and reported in 1992. The transfer of the Redbridge part of the estate to Barking and Dagenham had broad support. Following the review, in April 1994 an area of 90 hectares with a population of 200, was transferred from Redbridge to Barking and Dagenham, and a new ward of Becontree electing two councillors was created. The wards and councillor allocations were redrawn in 2002.

===Services===
All houses were supplied with gas by the Gas Light and Coke Company; most had gas lighting and some were fitted with electric lighting. Electricity was supplied by the County of London Electric Supply Company in Dagenham and the electricity services of Barking and Ilford municipal corporations in those sections. All gas lighting was converted to electricity in 1955. Water supply in the whole estate came from the South Essex Waterworks Company, but sewerage was split on municipal lines. In 1930 Barking and Ilford formed the Ilford and Barking Joint Sewerage Committee.

The General Post Office placed the entire estate in the Dagenham post town, including the Barking and Ilford sections, giving all residents postal addresses of &quot;Dagenham, Essex&quot;. It is perhaps for this reason that Becontree and Dagenham became synonymous. In 1927 the LCC was reluctant to agree that the Postmaster General should provide subscriber telephone lines to the estate, as it was considered incongruous for residents of a subsidised housing scheme to be able to afford such a luxury. Lines were connected from nearby exchanges until the DOMinion exchange was opened within the estate. In 1954 it had 1,337 lines, increasing to 1,620 in 1955 and by 1958 it had 2,700 lines.

The original LCC plan anticipated a civic and commercial centre around Parsloes Park. However, LCC was only a landlord in the area and had limited ability to influence commercial development and had no control over local government. The plan was not followed and Dagenham Civic Centre opened in 1937 outside the eastern boundary of the estate. The lack of a conventional town centre meant residents used the existing centres at Barking and Ilford. Small parades of shops were provided throughout the estate, such as on Gale Street and Wood Lane, but Dagenham Urban District Council tried to make up for the lack of a high street by creating a commercial centre along Heathway in 1934.

The estate was built without any provision for car parking as it was not anticipated that tenants would own cars. The plot sizes did not allow for garages to be added to homes. The LCC provided eleven garages for rent in 1937 and a further eighty in 1951. The LCC planned a tramway through the estate, filling some of the wide spaces on roads left by the special railway, but it was never built. There were no railway stations within the boundaries of the estate, with Chadwell Heath, Dagenham, Dagenham Dock and Goodmayes a short distance away. At first, trains on the Fenchurch Street–Southend line of the LMS passed through the estate without stopping, but in 1926 the LMS provided Gale Street Halt on the line. In 1932 (when the line was doubled with the addition of two electrified tracks) Gale Street Halt became Becontree station and a new station was added at Heathway. The stations were primarily served by the District Railway, which had been extended from Barking to Upminster.

Over the 15-year period of the building of the estate, the school-aged population rose rapidly to 25,000 while there were only 4 secondary schools nearby: 3 in Chadwell Heath and 1 at Becontree Heath, which meant that many children could not attend school. The first secondary school to be built was &quot;Green Lane&quot; in 1923, but it later became a primary school. It was renamed &quot;Henry Green&quot; in 1953, after the first headmaster after the secondary school opened in 1925.

Another improvement was after the 1952 smog, when the estate was declared a smokeless zone. The houses had their old fireplaces converted for use with smokeless fuel, which included fixed gas pokers in the hearths. The elderly man and his wife who lived in Mill Lane, Chadwell Heath and toured the estate in a horse-drawn cart on Saturday mornings selling logs and firewood (mostly tarred wood taken from the East End roads when they were replaced by tarmac) saw their business collapse overnight.

===Economic development===
Initially the estate had no industrial and very little commercial development planned to support the population. Residents commuted to Inner London for work, until the May &amp; Baker and Ford Dagenham sites opened nearby.

==Demography==
According to the 2011 census, White British was the largest ethnic group in Becontree ward at 51%. The second-largest was Black African, at 13%. Overall, 41.2% identified themselves as having a BAME background. In addition, the figures for Parsloes ward, which also covers parts of Becontree, were 61%, 14%, and 30.9% respectively. The median house price in 2014 in Becontree ward was £210,000, which along with the borough is one of the lowest in Greater London.

==Governance==
The estate is within the Becontree, Eastbrook, Goresbrook, Heath, Mayesbrook, Parsloes, River, Valence and Village (2010) wards - 9 of the 17 in Barking and Dagenham - see Barking and Dagenham London Borough Council.

==Culture==
East London has a long history of brass bands, and Becontree Brass Band was founded in 1981 as an amalgamation of several local bands.

The Dagenham Girl Pipers were formed in 1930 as the first female pipe band in the world and are still in existence.

==Education==

The area is served by 26 primary schools, and thirteen secondary schools of which three are free schools and one, Elutec, is a University technical college.

==Transport==
Becontree tube station is served by London Buses Routes 62 and 145. Martins Corner is also served by routes 5, 62, 145, 364, EL2, and night bus N15.

The Becontree estate itself is served by routes 62, 128, 150, 364, and 368. Chadwell Heath station to the north is served by routes 62 and 368.

The area has local bus connections towards Dagenham Heathway, Dagenham Dock, Barking, Ilford, Goodmayes, and Romford.

<doc id="93873" wikidata="Q123372" url="?curid=93873" title="Beckenham">
<text>Beckenham () is a town in Greater London, England, within the London Borough of Bromley. Prior to 1965, it was part of Kent. It is situated north of Elmers End and Eden Park, east of Penge, south of Lower Sydenham and Bellingham, and west of Bromley and Shortlands, and south-east of Charing Cross. Its population at the 2011 Census was 46,844.

Beckenham was, until the coming of the railway in 1857, a small village, with most of its land being rural and private parkland. John Barwell Cator and his family began the leasing and selling of land for the building of villas which led to a rapid increase in population, between 1850 and 1900, from 2,000 to 26,000. Housing and population growth has continued at a lesser pace since 1900.

Beckenham has areas of commerce and industry, principally around the curved network of streets featuring its high street, and is served in transport by three main railway stations — nine within the post town — plus towards its western periphery two Tramlink stations. In common with the rest of Bromley, the largest borough of London by area, Beckenham has several pockets of recreational land which are a mixture of sports grounds, fishing ponds and parks.

==Etymology==
The place-name &#x27;Beckenham&#x27; is first attested in a Saxon charter of 862 as &quot;Biohhahema mearc&quot;.
The settlement is referred to as &quot;Bacheham&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, and in the &quot;Textus Roffensis&quot; as &quot;Becceham&quot;. The name is thought to derive from &quot;Beohha&quot;&#x27;s homestead (Beohha + ham in Old English). The name of the small stream here – the River Beck – is most likely to have been named after the village.

==History==
Although early written history tells little of the area we have the entry in the Domesday Book of 1086 and various records in Court Rolls, Feet of Fines and other historical documents. Thomas Philipott recorded it in his Villare Cantianum in 1659 based on the research of his father John Philipott. Hasted wrote about it in 1778 in his History and Topography of Kent based on Philipott&#x27;s material. Others like Lysons and Ireland continued to record Beckenham Manor, Foxgrove Manor, Kelsey and Langley estates and Kent House Farm. Several other local historians updated the account based on more recent events and developments of Beckenham. Revisiting the history and collating the historical documentary evidence has revealed a more detailed early history showing how the manors and estates changed hands through families such as Rokele, Bruyn, Bardolf, Langley, Style, Kelshulle, Brograve, Raymond, Leigh, Burrell, Cator and various yeoman property owners like Kempsall, King, Batt etc. Archaeological evidence at nearby Holwood Park, where Stone Age and Bronze Age artefacts have been found, reveals some evidence of early settlers. A Roman camp was sited here, and a Roman road, the London to Lewes Way passed through the district.

By the time of the arrival of the Normans, the manor of Beckenham encompassed much of what is modern Beckenham, with other areas covered by the estates of Foxgrove Manor, Kelsey and Langley. Although William the Conqueror&#x27;s half brother, Bishop Odo, was overlord of all of Kent the manor of Beckenham was held or enfeoffed to Anschil of Rochester. The manor became divided but eventually rejoined under the St. John family until Frederick St. John, 3rd Viscount Bolingbroke sold most of the manor to John Cator the younger in 1773. The manor house and its grounds had been exchanged with Peter Burrell, Lord Gwydir in 1757. 

Beckenham remained a small village until well into the 19th century. The beginning of its growth began after 1825 when the estates of John Barwell Cator and Lord Gwydir began to be developed. if In 1760 John Cator the younger built Beckenham Place and became lord of the manor in 1773 after purchasing the manor of Beckenham from Frederick St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke. After Cator died in 1806, his heirs under his nephew John Barwell Cator became aware that an area in such relative close proximity to London was ripe for development, especially once the railway had arrived in 1857, and large villas began to be built around the new station. Wide roads and large gardens epitomised these properties, often built by developers who acquired land from the Cators. Lord Gwydir died in 1820 and his estates were split up, sold and developed. 

The manor of Foxgrove was owned by the Leigh family for some generations but purchased into the ownership of Lancelot Tolson circa 1716, his heirs divided it and it was acquired in part by John Cator and Jones Raymond. Raymond&#x27;s part passed on to the Burrells and a land exchange in 1793 made the northern parts of the manor John Cator&#x27;s and the southern parts absorbed into the Burrells Langley and Kelsey estates. What is now Beckenham Place Park is almost entirely parts of Foxgrove manor. Now it is part of the London Borough of Lewisham after boundary changes in the 1990s.

The Kelsey Estate, named from a manorial estate, Kelsies, recorded in 1479. The estate was granted to William Kelshulle in 1408. Peter Burrell the first bought Kelsey in 1688 and a house which had belonged to John Brograve was on the site. In the mid 18th Century a mansion was built overlooking the lake in Kelsey Park. This was later rebuilt, extended or altered circa 1835 to replace an earlier structure, though it was itself demolished in 1921 and the grounds turned into Kelsey Park. The only surviving buildings are the two Grade II listed lodge cottages at the entrance, which are over 200 years old.

In 1876 Beckenham Cemetery opened (originally Crystal Palace District Cemetery), located south of the town in Elmers End.

===Modern Beckenham===

Today Beckenham is an outer London suburb, though it has maintained its own identity and forms a town in its own right. It is centred on its non-pedestrianised curving high street. Further rows of shops run east from the town centre along Bromley Road, south along Croydon Road, and west along Beckenham Road around Clock House station, where the town&#x27;s library can be found. To the north lies the New Beckenham area, essentially a residential suburb of Beckenham proper.

==Governance==

The Municipal Borough of Beckenham came into being in 1935. It took over from what had been, since 1894, Beckenham Urban District Council and included parts of Hayes and West Wickham, previously part of Bromley Rural District Council. The new Borough status reflected the growth of Beckenham in less than fifty years.

Prior to 1965, Beckenham was part of the administrative county of Kent. In 1965, as part of the creation of the Greater London Council, the Borough council was disbanded and Beckenham came under control of the newly constituted London Borough of Bromley. Councillors represent various parts of the Borough of Beckenham. Beckenham Town Centre Management coordinates business interests in the town.

==Geography==

Beckenham lies west of Bromley and north-east of Croydon.

The original village of Beckenham was a cluster of development surrounded by the lands of a series of manorial estates: Beckenham, Foxgrove, Kelsey, Langley and Kent House Farm with their mansions, halls and Parks.
The parish boundary has changed over time but extended from Crystal Palace Park to Bromley and Lewisham to West Wickham.

The River Ravensbourne flows northwards at the eastern side of the town, towards its confluence with the River Thames forming an eastern boundary with Bromley. A small stream, the River Beck (sometimes referred to as the Hawkesbrook), passes through the town before joining the Ravensbourne via the Pool River further north near Catfod.

The area is part of an outcrop of London Clay which were the basis for several brickworks during the development period with areas of Harwich Formation and consists of many small hills. Several gravel pits extracted parts of the Blackheath Beds which are now included in the Harwich Formation 

==Economy==

Beckenham was the headquarters to Capita Registrars Limited who provides share registration services for more than half of the UK&#x27;s quoted companies, they have since moved from Beckenham. Proper Records, the UK&#x27;s biggest independent music distributor, was originally based in Beckenham but relocated to Surrey Quays in 2017.

==Religious sites==

The town has a number of places of worship. St. George&#x27;s Church is the principal parish church, and is in the centre of Beckenham. It was extensively rebuilt, at the end of the 19th century, but an earlier building dates back to 1100. It has a 13th-century lych gate that is thought to be one of the oldest in England. The almshouses next to the church go back to 1694. There are also three other Anglican churches in the town: All Saints Church; Holy Trinity Church; and St James at Elmers End. In addition, there are Methodist and Baptist churches; and the Roman Catholic St Edmund of Canterbury Church.

In Simon Brett&#x27;s long-running BBC Radio 4 comedy drama, &quot;No Commitments&quot; (1992–2007), Beckenham is the home of the wildly snobbish, socially aspirational and insecure sister Victoria; the town is frequently mocked by association.
Beckenham is also one of the main locations of the novel &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot; (1990), by Hanif Kureishi.

<text>Beddington is a suburban settlement in the London Borough of Sutton on the boundary with the London Borough of Croydon. Beddington is formed from a village of the same name which until early the 20th century still included land which became termed entirely as Wallington. By the 13th century, the latter was also partially known as Hakebrug, and named after a bridge on the River Wandle. The locality has a landscaped wooded park at Beddington Park – also known as Carew Manor; and a nature reserve and sewage treatment works in the centre and to the north of its area respectively. The population of Beddington according to the 2011 census is 21,044.

Beddington forms part of the Carshalton and Wallington constituency, which, since 2024, is represented in Westminster by Bobby Dean, a Liberal Democrat. Of the six councillors that Beddington elects to Sutton Council (from the wards Beddington North and Beddington South), three are Liberal Democrats and three are Independents.

==History==

The village lay in Wallington hundred and until the 19th century was in secular and ecclesiastical terms a large parish in its own right. Wallington was for centuries a manor in Beddington parish and although known as a shorthand for the area stretching from Cheam to Addington and from Chaldon to Mitcham (inclusive). Wallington superseded Beddington&#x27;s former area almost completely in the early 20th century.

The settlement appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Beddinton(e)&quot; held partly by Robert de Watevile from Richard de Tonebrige and by Miles Crispin. Its &quot;Domesday&quot; Assets were: 6 hides; 1 church, 14 ploughs, 4 mills worth £3 15s 0d, of meadow, woodland worth 10 hogs per year. It rendered: £19 10s 0d per year to its feudal system overlords. In 1901 it consisted of , of which 1,439 acres were arable land, 614 permanent grass and 45 woods. As this was before the expansion of Wallington, it extends on the south over the chalk downs at Roundshaw and northwards on to the London Clay. Lavender and medicinal herbs were grown commercially in the parish. The population in 1901 was 4,812. The parish was bounded on the north by Mitcham Common, and the three parishes of Croydon, Beddington and Mitcham met on the railway line by Beddington Lane station.

The 1911 Victoria County History documents Beddington in the period of its shrinkage.

A parish hall was built at Wallington in 1888, following its church and parish being set up in 1867 (in Beddington at the time). Holy Trinity Church school was built in 1896; the High School for girls was built in 1895 and enlarged in 1905. Thus it came about that Wallington took up most of the land of Beddington.

A static inverter plant of HVDC Kingsnorth stood here in the late 20th century.

==Beddington Mill==

The Domesday Book mentions two Mills at Beddington, and the current one is thought to have been the site of one of these. Once erroneously thought to have been owned in the late 16th century by Sir Walter Raleigh, an early 17th-century lease shows that it was in fact owned by the Carew family as a flour mill. In 1805 it was a snuff mill with a new owner, and it changed hands several times before being burnt down and replaced by the current building in 1891–1892 by Wallis &amp; Co as a flour mill and bakery.

The old – 18th-century or earlier – mill house remains to this day.

== Beddington Park ==
===Carew Manor===
Beddington Park was the former manor house of the Carew family, lost to money lenders (see George Samuel Ford) and bad debts by Charles Hallowell Hallowell Carew in the 1850s. The Domesday Book mentions two Beddington estates and these were united by Nicholas Carew to form Carew Manor in 1381. The Manor, once a medieval moated house, was home to the Royal Female Orphanage from 1866 until 1968. It now contains council offices and Carew Manor School.

In about 1591 Sir Walter Raleigh secretly, and without royal permission, married one of Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s maids of honour, Elizabeth Throckmorton of Carew Manor. Raleigh spent time in the Tower of London for this and Elizabeth was expelled from the court but the marriage appears to have been a genuine love-match and survived the imprisonment. A popular story is that when Raleigh was beheaded by James I in 1618, Elizabeth claimed his embalmed head and kept it in a bag for the rest of her life. His body was buried in St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, and after his wife&#x27;s death 29 years later, Raleigh&#x27;s head was returned to his tomb and interred at St. Margaret&#x27;s Church.

During the visit of Christian IV of Denmark to England in August 1606, the royal party visited Beddington, hosted by Sir George Carew.

The Grade I listed great hall (or banqueting hall), containing a fine hammerbeam roof, survives from the mediaeval house. In the grounds are part of the orangery built in the early 18th century around orange trees planted by Sir Francis Carew (claimed to be the first planted in England) and an early 18th-century Grade II* listed dovecote.
Archaeologists have discovered a Tudor garden including a grotto at Carew Manor, believed to have been created by Sir Francis Carew in the 16th century. Its exact location has not been disclosed in order to protect it from looting.

As well as Carew Manor, the family have given their name to a street in nearby Wallington, Carew Road.

===Carew Arms===
Arms of Carew: &quot;Or, 3 lions passant in pale sable&quot; were the arms shown on the seal of &quot;Nicholas de Carreu&quot; (c. 1255 – 1311), appended to the Barons&#x27; Letter, 1301, which he joined as &quot;Lord of Mulesford&quot; and which were blazoned for the same bearer in the Caerlaverock Poem or Roll of Arms of 1300, when he was present at the Siege of Caerlaverock Castle. From him are descended the Carew baronets of Antony and of Haccombe, the Earl of Totnes and Baron Carew.

===St Mary&#x27;s Church===

The Grade II* listed 14th-century flint parish church of St Mary&#x27;s occupies a prominent position in Beddington Park, immediately south of what is now Carew Manor School. It contains an organ screen by William Morris. The church is designated at Grade II* for the following principal reasons:
*It has substantial amounts of fabric from the 14th and 15th centuries
*It was extensively restored and provided with an extremely elaborate and interesting mid-Victorian decorative scheme.
*It has monuments and other fixtures of importance from circa 1200 to the 20th century, including the font and Carew tombs.
*The Morris and Co. organ is of special note, and the Last Judgment reredos is unusual.

<text>Bellingham ( ) is an area of south-east London, England, within the London Borough of Lewisham. It lies south of Catford, east of Sydenham and north of Beckenham, and is part of the Catford postal district (SE6).

==History==
According to author and historian Nick Barratt, there was certainly a Saxon community at Bellingham. In 10th-century Anglo-Saxon charters, the place is referred to as &quot;Beringaham&quot; and by 1198 the name had changed from starting with &#x27;Ber&#x27; to &#x27;Bel&#x27; through Norman influence. Some streets in Bellingham are named after the Saxon king Alfred the Great and his extended family: King Alfred Avenue, Elfrida Crescent and Arnulf Street.

The area was farmland for centuries, but the London County Council developed a cottage estate from 1919 to 1923 on the former Bellingham Farm, and was completed before World War II. The estate is bordered to the east and west by railway lines running south from Catford. Along the south it is bordered by Southend Lane, the A2218 main road. The River Ravensbourne runs through Bellingham, although it is either underground or part of a man-made section of the river. The Greenwich Prime Meridian passes to the east of Bellingham.

==Amenities==
Randlesdown Road serves as a mini &#x27;High Street&#x27; for Bellingham providing a local supermarket, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hair dressers, dry cleaner, off licence, news agent, fish and chip shop, The Fellowship pub and cinema, various takeaways and a gym (situated on Bellingham playing fields). It is known for being a very multicultural area.

Bellingham Green is a hexagonal public park at the centre of the estate.

==Transport==
Bellingham railway station serves the area with services to Kentish Town (London Blackfriars off peak) via Catford and to Sevenoaks via Swanley. Bellingham is served by many Transport for London buses connecting it with areas including Beckenham, Biggin Hill, Bromley, Catford, Central London, Greenwich, Shoreditch, Camberwell, Bermondsey, Deptford, Elephant &amp; Castle, Brockley, Lewisham, New Cross, Orpington, Peckham and Woolwich.

==Pre-school and primary education==
Pre-schools, nurseries and kindergartens include Kindergarten Forest Hill in Bellingham Green and Umbrella House Day Nursery. Primary schools in Bellingham include Athelney Primary School, St Augustines and Elfrida Primary School.

<text>Bermondsey ( ) is a district in southeast London, part of the London Borough of Southwark, England, southeast of Charing Cross. To the west of Bermondsey lies Southwark, to the east Rotherhithe and Deptford, to the south Walworth and Peckham, and to the north is Wapping across the River Thames. It lies within the historic county boundaries of Surrey. During the Industrial Revolution Bermondsey became a centre for manufacturing, particularly in relation to tanning. More recently it has experienced regeneration including warehouse conversions to flats and the provision of new transport links.

==History==

===Toponymy===
Bermondsey may be understood to mean &quot;Beornmund&quot;″s island; but, while &quot;Beornmund&quot; represents an Old English personal name, identifying an individual once associated with the place, the element &quot;-ey&quot; represents Old English &quot;eg&quot;, for &quot;island&quot;, &quot;piece of firm land in a fen&quot;, or simply a &quot;place by a stream or river&quot;. Thus Bermondsey need not have been an island as such in the Anglo-Saxon period, and is as likely to have been a higher, drier spot in an otherwise marshy area. Though Bermondsey&#x27;s earliest written appearance is in the Domesday Book of 1086, it also appears in a source which, though surviving only in a copy written at Peterborough Abbey in the 12th century, claiming &quot;ancient rights&quot; unproven purporting to be a transcription of a letter of Pope Constantine (708–715), in which he grants privileges to a monastery at &quot;Vermundesei&quot;, then in the hands of the abbot of Medeshamstede, as Peterborough was known at the time.

===Anglo-Saxon and Norman period===

Bermondsey appears in the Domesday Book as &quot;Bermundesy&quot; and &quot;Bermundesye&quot;, in the Hundred of Brixton within the County of Surrey. It was then held by King William, though a small part was in the hands of Robert, Count of Mortain, the king&#x27;s half brother, and younger brother of Odo of Bayeux, then earl of Kent. Its Domesday assets were recorded as including 13 hides, &#x27;a new and handsome church&#x27;, 5 ploughs, of meadow, and woodland for 5 pigs. It rendered £15 in total. It also included interests in London, in respect of which 13 burgesses paid 44d (£0.18).

The church mentioned in Domesday Book was presumably the nascent Bermondsey Abbey, which was founded as a Cluniac priory in 1082, and was dedicated to St Saviour. Monks from the abbey began the development of the area, cultivating the land and embanking the riverside. They turned an adjacent tidal inlet at the mouth of the River Neckinger into a dock, named St Saviour&#x27;s Dock after their abbey. But Bermondsey then was little more than a high street ribbon (the modern Bermondsey Street), leading from the southern bank of the Thames, at Tooley Street, up to the abbey close.

The Knights Templar also owned land here and gave their names to one of the most distinctive streets in London: Shad Thames (a corruption of &quot;St John at Thames&quot;). Other ecclesiastical properties stood nearby at Tooley Street (a corruption of &quot;St Olave&#x27;s&quot;), owned by the priors of Lewes, St Augustine&#x27;s, and Canterbury, as well as the abbot of Battle. These properties are located within the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s manor of Southwark, where wealthy citizens and clerics had their houses.

===14th century===
King Edward III built a manor house close to the Thames in Bermondsey in 1353. The excavated foundations are visible next to Bermondsey Wall East, close to the famous Angel public house.

===Early Modern period===

As it developed over the centuries, Bermondsey underwent some striking changes. After the Great Fire of London, it was settled by the well-to-do, and took on the character of a garden suburb especially along the line of Grange Road and Bermondsey Wall East as it became more urbanised. A pleasure garden was constructed during the Restoration period in the 17th century, commemorated by the Cherry Garden Pier. Samuel Pepys once visited here.

A rare surviving building from this period is St Mary Magdalen Church in Bermondsey Street, completed in 1690 (although a church has been recorded on this site from the 13th century). This church survived the 19th-century redevelopment phase and the Blitz unscathed. It is an unusual survivor for Bermondsey as buildings of this period are relative rarities in Inner London in general.

In the 18th century, the discovery of a spring from the river Neckinger in the area led to the development of Bermondsey Spa, as the area between Grange and Jamaica Roads called Spa Road commemorates. A new church was built for the growing population of the area, and named St John Horsleydown.

===Industrial era ===

It was from the Bermondsey riverside that the painter J. M. W. Turner executed his famous painting of &quot;The Fighting &quot;Temeraire&quot; Tugged to her Last Berth to be Broken Up&quot; (1839), depicting the veteran warship being towed to Rotherhithe to be scrapped.

By the mid-19th century factories sprang up, most notably Alaska chocolate, Salt, cheese and Hartley&#x27;s Jam. Parts of Bermondsey, especially along the riverside, had become notorious slums with the arrival of industrial plants, docks and immigrant housing. The area around St. Saviour&#x27;s Dock, known as Jacob&#x27;s Island, was one of the worst in London. It was immortalised in Charles Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, in which the villain, Bill Sikes, meets his end in the mud of &#x27;Folly Ditch&#x27;, in reference to Hickman&#x27;s Folly, which surrounded Jacob&#x27;s Island. Dickens provides a vivid description of what it was like:

Bermondsey vestry hall was built on Spa Road in 1881 but was severely damaged by bombing during the Blitz in 1941. It was demolished soon thereafter. The original vestry hall was extended to create the Bermondsey Town Hall in 1930. The area was extensively redeveloped during the 19th century and early 20th century with the expansion of the river trade and the arrival of the railways. London&#x27;s first passenger railway terminus was built by the London to Greenwich Railway in 1836 at London Bridge. The first section to be used was between the Spa Road Station and Deptford High Street. This local station had closed by 1915.
The industrial boom of the 19th century was an extension of Bermondsey&#x27;s manufacturing role in earlier eras. As in the East End, industries that were deemed too noisome to be carried on within the narrow confines of the City of London had been located here – one such that came to dominate central Bermondsey, away from the riverfront, was the processing and trading of leather and hides. Many of the warehouse buildings from this era survive around Bermondsey Street, Tanner Street, Morocco Street and Leathermarket Street including the huge Leather Market of 1833 and the Leather, Hide and Wool Exchange of 1878; virtually all are now residential and small work spaces or offices. Hepburn and Gale&#x27;s tannery (disused as of early 2007) on Long Lane is also a substantial surviving building of the leather trade. The Exchange building had a fine private club, effectively a gentlemen&#x27;s club for the leading merchants and manufacturers. In 1703 they had acquired a royal charter from Queen Anne to gain a monopoly of trading and training of apprentices for within of the ancient parish, similar to a City livery company, the Bermondsey tanners.

Peek, Frean and Co was established in 1857 at Dockhead, Bermondsey by James Peek and George Hender Frean. They moved to a larger plant in Clements Road in 1866, leading to the nickname &#x27;Biscuit Town&#x27; for Bermondsey, where they continued baking until the brand was discontinued in 1989.

Bermondsey, specifically Blue Anchor Lane, was also the location of the world&#x27;s first food canning business, established in 1812, by Donkin, Hall and Gamble.

===The Bermondsey battalions===

During the Napoleonic Wars volunteer units were formed for home defence, including the &#x27;Old&#x27; and &#x27;New&#x27; Bermondsey Volunteers (existing in 1799) and the Rotherhithe Volunteers in 1803. After another invasion scare, the 10th (Bermondsey) and 23rd (Rotherhithe) Surrey Rifle Volunteer Corps were formed in 1860–61. Together they became a volunteer battalion of the Queen&#x27;s (Royal West Surrey Regiment) in 1883, with its drill hall in Jamaica Road. When the Territorial Force was created in 1908 this became the 22nd Battalion, London Regiment (Queen&#x27;s). After the outbreak of World War I in 1914 it expanded to three battalions, of which the 1/22nd served on the Western Front and the 2/22nd in Palestine.

Following the success of the recruitment campaign for &#x27;Kitchener&#x27;s Army&#x27; in 1914, Lord Kitchener asked the mayors of the Metropolitan boroughs of the County of London if they could raise more &#x27;Pals battalions&#x27; drawn from their localities. Despite Bermondsey already supporting the 22nd Londons, the Mayor and Borough Council agreed to form another infantry battalion, which became the 12th (Service) Battalion, East Surrey Regiment (Bermondsey). The men wore the coat of arms of Bermondsey as their collar badge. A number of them were recruited from the &#x27;Black Hand Gang&#x27;, a notorious Bermondsey street gang of the era, and they proved so skilful at Trench raiding that &#x27;Black Hand Gang&#x27; became a nickname for the whole battalion. It served on the Western Front: when the first tanks went into action at the Battle of Flers–Courcelette on 15 September 1916, an aircraft saw the 12th East Surreys following one to attack the village and sent back the famous report: &#x27;A tank is walking down the high street of Flers with the British Army cheering behind&#x27;.

After World War I, the 12th East Surreys were disbanded and the 22nd Londons were reformed in the Territorial Army (TA). The London Regiment was abolished in 1937 and the battalion reverted to being the 6th (Bermondsey) Battalion, The Queen&#x27;s. During World War II it again formed a second battalion, and both served in the Battle of France and North Africa. The 1/6th was at the Battle of Alamein and then served with the 7th Armoured Division (the &#x27;Desert Rats&#x27;) in Italy and North West Europe, while the 2/6th were with the 56th (London) Division in Italy. In 1961 the 6th Queen&#x27;s amalgamated with the other TA battalions of the Queen&#x27;s Regiment. 

===20th century===

To the east of Tower Bridge, Bermondsey&#x27;s of riverside were lined with warehouses and wharves, of which the best known is Butler&#x27;s Wharf. They suffered severe damage in World War II bombing and became redundant in the 1960s following the collapse of the river trade. After standing derelict for some years, many of the wharves were redeveloped under the aegis of the London Docklands Development Corporation during the 1980s. They have now been converted into a mixture of residential and commercial accommodations and have become some of the most upmarket and expensive properties in London. In 1997, US President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair visited the area to dine at the Le Pont de la Tour restaurant at Butler&#x27;s Wharf.

At the same time more everyday housing was constructed in the areas north of the Old Kent Road, including several council estates.
Bermondsey was served by London&#x27;s first railway, from Spa Road railway station, as part of the London Bridge to Greenwich line, and the junction of lines from Croydon and Kent at South Bermondsey. However, reorganisation of lines and temporary closure of stations left Bermondsey&#x27;s transport links with the rest of London poorer in the late Twentieth Century. This was improved in 2000 with the opening of Bermondsey Underground station on the London Underground&#x27;s Jubilee Line Extension and the East London Line extension as part of the London Overground.

The Blue serves as the central market place for Bermondsey as a whole.

Wee Willie Harris, known as &quot;Britain&#x27;s wild man of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;, came from Bermondsey and had worked as a pudding mixer at Peek Freans. He is usually credited as the first British rock and roll player.

===Local government===

The first &#x27;Bermondsey&#x27; is that known as the location of an Anglo-Saxon monastery, and known from later charters to be the area around the post-Conquest Bermondsey Abbey and its manor, which was in turn part of the medieval parish. References in the Parliamentary Rolls describe it as &quot;in Southwark&quot;.[] A later, Victorian civil parish of Bermondsey did not include Rotherhithe or St Olave&#x27;s; this was the arrangement under the Metropolis Management Act 1855. The Southwark parishes of St Olave&#x27;s and St John&#x27;s Horsleydown (the latter a &#x27;daughter&#x27; of the former) with St Thomas&#x27;s formed a parish union (&#x27;District Board of Works&#x27;) known as &#x27;St Olave&#x27;s&#x27; from that date. This was the arrangement within the London County from 1889. In 1899 St Olave and St Thomas&#x27;s District was created as a single civil parish and the next year, following London government reorganisation, this was merged with Rotherhithe and part of Deptford to form, with Bermondsey civil parish, the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey. The Borough&#x27;s first Mayor was Samuel Bourne Bevington (1832–1907), leather producer and one of the area&#x27;s largest employers; his statue still stands in Tooley Street. This borough was incorporated into the London Borough of Southwark, in the Greater London reorganisation of 1965. For elections to the Greater London Council, Bermondsey was part of the Southwark electoral division until 1973 and then the Bermondsey electoral division until 1986.

==Governance==

Southwark London Borough Council has divided the borough into a number of community council areas. The wards of London Bridge and West Bermondsey, North Bermondsey and South Bermondsey form the Bermondsey Community Council area.

Bermondsey&#x27;s parliamentary representation has fluctuated with its population. Since at least the 13th century, it had formed part of the Surrey County seat until the 1868 Reform Act when it became part of Southwark constituency. From 1885 to 1918, a separate Bermondsey constituency existed, which included part of the older Southwark constituency. 1918 saw the seat split between two new constituencies: Rotherhithe and Bermondsey West, both of which were in place until the 1950 general election when the old Bermondsey seat was recreated.

In 1983, the area played host to a famous Bermondsey by-election in which Labour&#x27;s Peter Tatchell lost the previously safe Labour seat to the Liberal Simon Hughes on a swing of 44%, which remains the largest by-election swing in British political history. Hughes represented the area until 2015 when he was defeated by the Labour candidate Neil Coyle. At the 1983 general election that took place several months after the by-election, a new Southwark and Bermondsey constituency was created, becoming North Southwark and Bermondsey in 1997, and in 2010 Bermondsey and Old Southwark (although a small part of south east Bermondsey is transferred to Camberwell and Peckham in the 2010 changes).

==Sport==
Millwall Football Club was originally formed in 1885, in Millwall on the Isle of Dogs, East London. They retained the name, even though they moved across the river to New Cross, South East London in 1910. In 1993 they moved to their current stadium, The Den. The team has a strong local following, but has never been based in Bermondsey. The stadium lies right on the border of Southwark, but falls under the Borough of Lewisham. The nearest railway station is at South Bermondsey, which is a five-minute walk away.

==Transport==
=== Rail ===
There are several railway stations in and around Bermondsey. Bermondsey is in London Zone 2, but nearby London Bridge and Borough stations are in travelcard Zone 1. Oyster Cards can be used for travel from stations in Bermondsey to other stations in the London region.

==== London Underground ====
The Jubilee line passes through Bermondsey, calling at Bermondsey and Canada Water stations. London Bridge station on the Jubilee and Northern lines, and Borough on the Northern line are also nearby.

The Jubilee line provides a direct link from Bermondsey to Canary Wharf and Stratford in London&#x27;s East End, and to Waterloo, the West End, Baker Street and north west London towards Willesden and Stanmore. The Northern line from London Bridge links the area to Kennington, Clapham and Morden in the south west. Northbound services travel through the City of London, King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras and Camden Town, towards Edgware or High Barnet.

==== National Rail &amp; London Overground ====
The East London line, South London line and South Eastern Main Line all pass through Bermondsey, providing frequent rail connections to Central London and South East England.

London Bridge is the busiest station in the locale, and fourth busiest station in the UK, with 48.5 million passenger entries and exits in 2017–18. Services from London Bridge are provided by Southeastern, Thameslink and Southern. London Bridge connects Bermondsey directly to destinations in Central London, including Waterloo, Charing Cross, Cannon Street, Farringdon and St Pancras International. Beyond London, trains travel direct to Gatwick and Luton airports, and destinations including Bedford, Brighton, Cambridge, Dover, Peterborough and Sevenoaks.

South Bermondsey is served by Southern trains from London Bridge to South London, with direct connections to Beckenham Junction, Crystal Palace and Croydon.

Rotherhithe, Canada Water and Surrey Quays are all served by London Overground trains. These stations link Bermondsey with Dalston and Highbury &amp; Islington to the north. To the south, Bermondsey is linked directly to New Cross, West Croydon, Crystal Palace, and Clapham Junction.

Queens Road Peckham &amp; Peckham Rye stations, just south of Bermondsey, Peckham Rye is also an interchange served by London Overground, Southeastern, Thameslink and Southern, with direct trains to London Victoria station. While Queens Road Peckham station is in-between Peckham Rye and South Bermondsey stations providing London Overground and Southern services.

===Bus connections===

London Buses routes 1; 42; 47; 78; 188; 381; C10 and P12 and night routes N1; N47; N199 and N381 all serve the Bermondsey and South Bermondsey area.

=== Road ===
Several of London&#x27;s arterial routes pass through Bermondsey, including:

* the A100 (Tower Bridge Road) – the London Inner Ring Road towards the City and Tower Bridge;
* the A101 (Rotherhithe Tunnel) – to Limehouse, Canary Wharf, the A13 and destinations in Essex;
* the A2 (Great Dover Street/Old Kent Road) – to the M25, destinations in Kent and the Channel Tunnel;
* the A200 (Jamaica Road/Lower Road) – to London Bridge and Deptford;
* the A202 (New Kent Road) – the London Inner Ring Road towards Elephant &amp; Castle and the A3;
* the A2206 (Southwark Park Road);
* the A2208 (Rotherhithe New Road).

Bricklayer&#x27;s Arms is a busy road junction between the London Inner Ring Road (A100/A202) and the A2, where routes from London Bridge meet with routes towards the East End, Surrey and Kent.

The southern portal of the Rotherhithe Tunnel (A101) is in Bermondsey. The Tunnel was completed in 1908 and carries vehicle traffic from Bermondsey directly to the East End. In 2003, the Tunnel was rated the tenth most dangerous tunnel in Europe, owing in parts to its age and lack of safety features.

The London Borough of Southwark maintains most roads, particularly residential streets, but Transport for London (TfL) manages certain routes: the A100; the A101 (Rotherhithe Tunnel); the A2; the A200; the A202.

==== Air pollution ====
The local authority say that vehicle exhaust fumes are the main source of air pollution in Southwark. Roadside air pollution levels are monitored by the local authority in Bermondsey. Results from 2017 suggest that Bermondsey has some of the highest nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in the Borough. NO2 concentration was particularly high near the Rotherhithe Tunnel, along Jamaica Road and on Old Kent Road:

All the above sites failed to meet national air quality objectives.

A monitoring site on Old Kent Road registered an annual mean 22 μg/m-3 in 2017 for PM10 (particulates often found in exhaust), which meets national air quality objectives.

=== Cycling ===
Bermondsey is well connected to the London and National Cycle networks, with several signed routes passing through the area. With several routes passing through Bermondsey, cycling infrastructure is maintained by both Transport for London (TfL) and Southwark Council. Most routes run through Bermondsey in an east–west direction.

Santander Cycles bicycle sharing was extended to the area in 2020 with five new docking stations, serving the Cycleway 4 route that will connect Tower Bridge and Greenwich.
