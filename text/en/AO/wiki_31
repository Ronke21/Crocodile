<doc id="88916" wikidata="Q156291" url="?curid=88916" title="Allegheny County, Pennsylvania">
<text>Allegheny County ( ) is a county in Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 1,250,578, making it the state&#x27;s second-most populous county, after Philadelphia County. Its county seat and most populous city is Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania&#x27;s second most populous city. The county is part of the Greater Pittsburgh region of the commonwealth, and is the center of the Pittsburgh media market.

Allegheny was the first county in Pennsylvania to be given a Native American name. It was named after the Lenape word for the Allegheny River. The meaning of &quot;Allegheny&quot; is uncertain. It is usually said to mean &quot;fine river&quot;. Some historians state that the name may come from a Lenape account of an ancient mythical tribe called &quot;Allegewi&quot;, who lived along the river before being taken over by the Lenape.

==History==

Prior to European contact, this area was settled for thousands of years by succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples. During the colonial era, historic native groups known by the colonists to settle in the area included members of western nations of the Iroquois, such as the Seneca; the Lenape, who had been pushed from the East by European-American settlers; the Shawnee, who also had territory in Ohio; and the Mingo, a group made up of a variety of peoples from more eastern tribes.

European fur traders such as Peter Chartier established trading posts in the region in the early eighteenth century.

In 1749, Captain Pierre Joseph Céloron de Blainville claimed the Ohio Valley and all of western Pennsylvania for King Louis XV of France. The captain traveled along the Ohio and Allegheny rivers. He installed lead plates in the ground to mark the land for France.

Most of the towns during that era were developed along waterways, which were the primary transportation routes, as well as providing water for domestic uses. Through the eighteenth century, both the French and the British competed for control over the local rivers in this frontier territory of North America. Native American bands and tribes allied with the colonists to differing degrees, often based on their trading relationships. The British sent Major George Washington to expel the French from their posts, with no success. He also nearly drowned in the ice-filled Allegheny River while returning to camp.

The English tried again in 1754 to establish a post in the area. They sent 41 Virginians to build Fort Prince George. The French learned of the plan and sent an army to capture the fort. They resumed building it and added increased defensive fortification, renaming it as Fort Duquesne.

Given its strategic location at the Ohio, Fort Duquesne became an important focal point of the French and Indian War. The first British attempt to retake the fort, the Braddock Expedition, failed miserably. In 1758 British forces under General John Forbes recaptured the fort; he had it destroyed to prevent any use by the French. The British built a new, larger fort on the site, including a moat, and named it Fort Pitt. The historic site has been preserved as Pittsburgh&#x27;s Point State Park.

Under their colonial charters, both Pennsylvania and Virginia claimed the region that is now Allegheny County. Pennsylvania administered most of the region as part of its Westmoreland County. Virginia considered everything south of the Ohio River and east of the Allegheny River to be part of its Yohogania County, and governed it from Fort Dunmore. In addition, parts of the county were located in the proposed British colony of Vandalia and the proposed U.S. state of Westsylvania. The overlapping boundaries, multiple governments, and confused deed claims soon proved unworkable. Near the end of the American Revolutionary War, in 1780 Pennsylvania and Virginia agreed to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward. This region was assigned to Pennsylvania. From 1781 until 1788, much of what Virginia had claimed as part of Yohogania County was administered as a part of the newly created Washington County, Pennsylvania.

Allegheny County was officially created on September 24, 1788, from parts of Washington and Westmoreland counties. It was formed to respond to pressure from the increase in settlers living in the area around Pittsburgh; this was designated as the county seat in 1791. The county originally extended north to the shores of Lake Erie; it was reduced to its current borders by 1800. As population increased in the territory, other counties were organized.

In the 1790s, the United States federal government imposed a whiskey excise tax. Farmers who had depended on whiskey income refused to pay and started the so-called Whiskey Rebellion after driving off tax collector John Neville. After a series of demonstrations by farmers, President George Washington sent troops to suppress the frontier rebellion.

The area developed rapidly through the 1800s with industrialization. It became the nation&#x27;s prime steel producer by the late 19th century and Pittsburgh was nicknamed &quot;Steel Capital of the World&quot;.

In 1913, the county&#x27;s 125th anniversary was celebrated with a week-long series of events. The final day, September 27, was marked by a steamboat parade of 30 paddle wheelers. They traveled from Monongahela Wharf down the Ohio to the Davis Island Dam. The boats in line were the &quot;Steel City&quot; (formerly the Pittsburgh and Cincinnati packet &quot;Virginia&quot;), the flag ship; &quot;City of Parkersburg&quot;, &quot;Charles Brown&quot;, &quot;Alice Brown&quot;, &quot;Exporter&quot;, &quot;Sam Brown&quot;, &quot;Boaz&quot;, &quot;Raymond Horner&quot;, &quot;Swan&quot;, &quot;Sunshine&quot;, &quot;I. C. Woodward&quot;, &quot;Cruiser&quot;, &quot;Volunteer&quot;, &quot;A. R. Budd&quot;, &quot;J. C. Risher&quot;, &quot;Clyde&quot;, &quot;Rival&quot;, &quot;Voyager&quot;, &quot;Jim Brown&quot;, &quot;Rover&quot;, &quot;Charlie Clarke&quot;, &quot;Robt. J. Jenkins&quot;, &quot;Slipper&quot;, &quot;Bertha&quot;, &quot;Midland&quot; &quot;Sam Barnum&quot;, &quot;Cadet&quot;, &quot;Twilight&quot;, and &quot;Troubadour&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.9%) is water.

Four major rivers traverse Allegheny County: the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River converge at Downtown Pittsburgh to form the Ohio River. The Youghiogheny River flows into the Monongahela River at McKeesport, to the southeast. There are several islands in these courses. The rivers drain via the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico. Although the county&#x27;s industrial growth resulted in clearcutting of the area&#x27;s forests, a significant amount of woodland has regrown.

==Government and politics==

Until January 1, 2000, Allegheny County&#x27;s government was defined under Pennsylvania&#x27;s Second Class County Code. The county government was charged with all local activities, including elections, prisons, airports, public health, and city planning. All public offices were headed by elected citizens. There were three elected county commissioners.

On January 1, 2000, the Home-Rule Charter went into effect. It replaced the three elected commissioners with an elected chief officer (the County Executive), a county council with 15 members (13 elected by district, two elected county-wide), and an appointed county manager. The changes were intended to maintain a separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches while providing greater citizen control.

The county has 130 self-governing municipalities, the most in the state. (Luzerne is second with 76). The county has one Second Class City (Pittsburgh) and three Third Class Cities (Clairton, Duquesne, and McKeesport).

A 2004 study found the county would be better served by consolidating the southeastern portion of the county (which includes many small communities with modest economies) into a large municipality (&quot;Rivers City&quot;) with a combined population of approximately 250,000.

=== Government structure ===
Allegheny County has a Home Rule Charter form of government since 2000. The county has three branches: the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. The executive branch consists of the County Executive, who is elected for a four-year term and serves as the chief executive officer of the county; and the County Manager, who is appointed by the County Executive and oversees the daily operations of the county departments. The current County Executive is Sara Innamorato, a Democrat who took office in 2024. The current County Manager is William D. McKain, who was appointed by Fitzgerald in 2012 and reappointed in 2016 and 2020. The legislative branch consists of the County Council, which is composed of 15 members elected for four-year terms from 13 single-member districts and 2 At-Large representatives, currently occupied by Bethany Hallam and Sam DeMarco. The council functions as the primary legislative and policy-making body of the county. The current County Council President is Patrick Catena, a Democrat who represents District 4 and was elected by his fellow council members in 2018 and 2020. The judicial branch consists of the Court of Common Pleas, which is the general trial court of the county; and the Magisterial District Courts, which are lower courts that handle minor criminal and civil cases. The judges of these courts are elected for ten-year terms. The current President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas is Kimberly Berkeley Clark, who was elected by her fellow judges in 2018 for a five-year term.

=== Self-governing municipalities ===
Allegheny County has 130 self-governing municipalities, the most in the state. These include one city (Pittsburgh), 96 boroughs, 30 townships, and two home rule municipalities (Bethel Park and McCandless).
Each municipality has its own elected officials, such as mayor, council, commissioners, supervisors, etc., and its own local services, such as police, fire, public works, etc.
Some municipalities also have their own municipal authorities that provide services such as water, sewer, transit, etc.

=== Changes to Administrative Divisions ===
There have been several proposals to consolidate or merge some of the municipalities in Allegheny County, either with each other or with the City of Pittsburgh, to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and enhance regional cooperation. However, none of these proposals have been implemented so far. One of the most recent proposals is from Wilkinsburg, a borough that borders Pittsburgh and faces financial challenges due to declining population and tax base. In 2020, Wilkinsburg residents voted to approve a referendum to explore a merger with Pittsburgh. In 2021, a joint task force was formed to study the feasibility and impact of such a merger. The task force is expected to issue a report by June 2022. If both Wilkinsburg and Pittsburgh councils approve the merger, it would then need approval from the state legislature and governor before taking effect. Another recent proposal is from Allegheny County Economic Development (ACED), which is seeking to enter into an agreement with a consultant to carry out historic preservation compliance activities for projects funded by various federal programs. The consultant would help ACED develop a Programmatic Memorandum of Agreement (PMOA) with the Pennsylvania State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and other stakeholders to streamline the review process for projects that may affect historic properties within the county. ACED issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for this service in January 2022 and expects to select a consultant by March 2022.

===Voter Registration===













|}

 there were 952,695 registered voters in the county; a majority were Democrats. There were 526,323 registered Democrats, 274,215 registered Republicans, 111,070 registered as independents and 41,087 registered with other parties.

===Political history===
The Republican Party had been historically dominant in county-level politics in the 19th and early 20th centuries; prior to the Great Depression, Pittsburgh and Allegheny County had been majority Republican. Since the Great Depression on the state and national levels, the Democratic Party has been dominant in county-level politics. It is by far the most Democratic county in western Pennsylvania. For much of the time between the Great Depression and the turn of the millennium, it was the second-strongest Democratic bastion in Pennsylvania, behind only Philadelphia.

In 2000, Democrat Al Gore won 56% of the vote and Republican George W. Bush won 41%. In 2004, Democrat John Kerry received 57% of the vote and Republican Bush received 41%. In 2006, Democrats Governor Ed Rendell and Senator Bob Casey Jr. won 59% and 65% of the vote in Allegheny County, respectively. In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama received 57% of the vote, Republican John McCain received 41%, and each of the three state row office winners (Rob McCord for Treasurer, Jack Wagner for Auditor General, and Tom Corbett for Attorney General) also carried Allegheny. In 2016, despite Donald Trump being the first Republican to carry Pennsylvania since 1988, Hillary Clinton did slightly better than Barack Obama&#x27;s 2012 vote total while Donald Trump was the worst performing Republican in 20 years. In the 2018 Midterms, Democrats received an even higher percentage of the vote with Tom Wolf and Casey receiving approximately two thirds of the county&#x27;s vote. This is an improvement over the approximately 55% each person received in the county in their last election in 2014 and 2012 respectively. In 2020, Joe Biden improved upon Clinton&#x27;s performance, receiving the highest vote percentage for a Democrat since Michael Dukakis in 1988 and the most votes for a Democrat since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.

In the 21st century, populist turns to the GOP from nearly all of Appalachia in general and western Pennsylvania in particular have left the county as one of the few in the region that still supports the Democrats at a high level.

== Religion ==
In 2010 statistics, the largest religious group in Allegheny County was the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, with 460,672 Catholics worshipping at 179 parishes; followed by the United Methodist Church, with 44,204 Methodists in 100 congregations; the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, with 42,838 Presbyterians in 145 congregations; non-denominational Protestants, with 33,103 adherents in 85 congregations; the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, with 24,718 Lutherans in 77 congregations; the American Baptist Churches USA, with 17,148 Baptists in 42 congregations; the Assemblies of God, with 12,398 Pentecostals in 30 congregations; Reform Judaism, with 8,483 Jews in 6 congregations; the 7,780 Episcopal Church (United States), with 7,780 Episcopalians in 19 congregations; and Hinduism in the United States, with 6,700 Hindus in four temples. Altogether, 60.6% of the population was claimed as members by religious congregations, although members of historically African-American denominations were underrepresented due to incomplete information. In 2014, Allegheny County had 794 religious organizations, the 11th most out of all US counties.

==Economy==

In the late 18th century, farming played a critical role in the growth of the area. There was a surplus of grain due to transportation difficulties in linking with the eastern portion of the state. As a result, the farmers distilled the grain into whiskey, which significantly helped the farmers financially.
The area quickly became a key manufacturing area in the young nation. Coupled with deposits of iron and coal, and the easy access to waterways for barge traffic, the city quickly became one of the most important steel producing areas in the world. Based on 2007 data from the US Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh is the second (after Laredo, Texas) busiest inland port in the nation.

US steel production declined late in the 20th century, and Allegheny County&#x27;s economy began a shift to other industries. It is presently known for its hospitals, universities, and industrial centers. Despite the decline of heavy industry, Pittsburgh is home to a number of major companies and is ranked in the top ten among US cities hosting headquarters of Fortune 500 corporations, including U.S. Steel Corporation, PNC Financial Services Group, PPG Industries, and H. J. Heinz Company.

The county leads the state in number of defense contractors supplying the U.S. military.

===Former places===
Many political subdivisions of Allegheny County have come and gone through subdivision or annexation through the years. These include:
* Allegheny City – the area that is now the North Shore (or North Side) of the City of Pittsburgh, north of the Allegheny River.
* Allentown Borough – now the neighborhood of Allentown in Pittsburgh.
* Birmingham Borough – what is now Pittsburgh&#x27;s South Side.
* Brushton Borough
* Carrick Borough – now the neighborhood of Carrick. Formed out of Baldwin Township in 1904, this borough existed until it was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1927. It was named for Carrick-on-Suir, Ireland. Some of the area&#x27;s manhole covers still bear the Carrick Borough name.
* Chartier Township – existed at the time of the 1860 U.S. Federal Census.
* Collins Township – in what is now the northeast part of the City of Pittsburgh, east of Lawrenceville and north of Penn Avenue.
* Knoxville Borough
* Lawrenceville Borough

<doc id="88918" wikidata="Q184090" url="?curid=88918" title="Preston, Lancashire">
<text>Preston () is a city on the north bank of the River Ribble in Lancashire, England. The city is the administrative centre of the county of Lancashire and the wider City of Preston local government district. Preston and its surrounding district obtained city status in 2002, becoming England&#x27;s 50th city in the 50th year of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s reign. Preston had a population of 147,800 at the 2021 census the City of Preston district 156,411 in 2023 and the Preston Built-up Area 313,322. The Preston Travel To Work Area, in 2011, had a population of 420,661, compared with 354,000 in the previous census. The south bank of the Ribble is part of the Preston urban area, although it forms the South Ribble borough that is administratively separate.

Preston and its surrounding area have provided evidence of ancient Roman activity, largely in the form of a Roman road that led to a camp at Walton-le-Dale. The Angles established Preston; its name is derived from the Old English meaning &quot;priest&#x27;s settlement&quot; and in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; is recorded as &quot;Prestune&quot;. In the Middle Ages, Preston was a parish and township in the hundred of Amounderness and was granted a Guild Merchant charter in 1179, giving it the status of a market town. Textiles have been produced since the mid-13th century when locally produced wool was woven in people&#x27;s houses. Flemish weavers who settled in the area in the 14th century helped develop the industry. In the early-18th century, Edmund Calamy described Preston as &quot;a pretty town with an abundance of gentry in it, commonly called Proud Preston&quot;. Sir Richard Arkwright, inventor of the spinning frame, was born in the town. The most rapid period of growth and development coincided with the industrialisation and expansion of textile manufacturing. Preston was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution, becoming a densely populated engineering centre, with large industrial plants. The town&#x27;s textile sector fell into terminal decline from the mid-20th century and Preston has subsequently faced similar challenges to other post-industrial northern towns, including deindustrialisation, economic deprivation and housing issues.

Preston is the seat of Lancashire County Council, houses the main campus of the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) and is home to Preston North End, a founding member of the Football League and the first English football champions in 1889. In that season, the team also won the league and cup double and went unbeaten in the league. It took 115 years until another team went a full season unbeaten. After winning another league title the following year, the team has not won a championship since and their latest major trophy was the 1938 FA Cup. 

The demonym for residents of the city is &quot;Prestonian&quot;.

==Toponymy==
Preston was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as . Various other spellings occur in early documents: &quot;Prestonam&quot; (1094), &quot;Prestone&quot; (1160), &quot;Prestona&quot; (1160), &quot;Presteton&quot; (1180), and &quot;Prestun&quot; (1226). The modern spelling occurs in 1094, 1176, 1196, 1212, and 1332. The town&#x27;s name is derived from the Old English words and . The (enclosure, farmstead, village, manor, estate) of the .

==History==
===Early development===
During the Roman period, Roman roads passed close to what is now the centre of Preston. For example, the road from Luguvalium to Mamucium (now Carlisle to Manchester) crossed the River Ribble at Walton-le-Dale, southeast of the centre of Preston, and a Roman camp or station may also have been here. At Withy Trees, north of Preston, the road crossed another Roman road from Bremetennacum (the Roman fort at Ribchester) to the coast.

An explanation of the origin of the name is that the Priest&#x27;s Town refers to a priory set up by St Wilfrid near the Ribble&#x27;s lowest ford. This idea is supported by the similarity of the Paschal lamb on Preston&#x27;s crest with that on St Wilfrid&#x27;s.

When first mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book, Preston was already the most important town in Amounderness (the area of Central Lancashire between the rivers Ribble and Cocker, including The Fylde and the Forest of Bowland). When assessed for tax purposes in 1218 – 19 it was the wealthiest town in the whole county.

===Guild Merchant===

The right to hold a &quot;Guild Merchant&quot; was conferred by King Henry II upon the burgesses of Preston in a charter of 1179; the associated Preston Guild is a civic celebration held every 20 years, the last being in 2012. It is the only guild still celebrated in the UK.

Before 1328, celebrations were held at irregular intervals, but at the guild of that year it was decreed that subsequent guilds should be held every 20 years. After this, there were breaks in the pattern for various reasons, but an unbroken series were held from 1542 to 1922. A full 400-year sequence was frustrated by the cancellation of the 1942 guild due to World War II, but the cycle resumed in 1952. The expression &#x27;(Once) every Preston Guild&#x27;, meaning &#x27;very infrequently&#x27;, has passed into fairly common use, especially in Lancashire.

Guild week is always started by the opening of the Guild Court, which since the 16th century has traditionally been on the first Monday after the feast of the Beheading of John the Baptist celebrated on 29 August. As well as concerts and other exhibitions, the main events are a series of processions through the city. Numerous street parties are held in the locality.

In 1952 the emphasis was on the bright new world emerging after the war. The major event, held in the city&#x27;s Avenham Park, had every school participating, and hundreds of children, from toddlers to teenagers, demonstrated different aspects of physical education in the natural amphitheatre of the park.

The 2012 guild formally opened on 2 September with a mayoral proclamation and the return of &quot;friendship scrolls&quot; that had travelled the world. Highlights in the programme for the 2012 celebration included two concerts in Avenham Park – one by Human League and another, a &quot;Proms In The Park&quot;, featuring José Carreras, Katherine Jenkins and the Manchester Camerata.

===Pre-industrial Preston===
In the mid-12th century, Preston was in the hundred of Amounderness, in the deanery of Amounderness and the archdeaconry of Richmond. The name &quot;Amounderness&quot; is more ancient than the name of any other &quot;Wapentake&quot; or hundred in the County of Lancashire, and the fort at Tulketh, strengthened by William the Conqueror, shows that the strategic importance of the area was appreciated even then.
The location of the city, almost exactly midway between Glasgow and London, led to many confrontations with Scotland. Preston was burned by the Scots during The Great Raid of 1322 but two years later had quickly recovered. Decisive battles were also fought here, most notably during the English Civil War at the Battle of Preston (1648), and then the first Jacobite rebellion, whose invasion of England was brought to a conclusion by the defeat of the pro-Catholic and pro-monarchial Jacobite army at the Battle of Preston (1715). Letitia Elizabeth Landon alludes to this latter defeat in her poetical illustration, &quot;Preston&quot;, to an engraving of a painting by Thomas Allom, in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book 1834.
In the last great Jacobite Rising, on 27 November 1745 the Jacobite Prince of Wales and Regent, Bonnie Prince Charlie passed through Preston with his Highland Army on the way south through Chorley and Manchester to Derby intending to take London and the Crown. Preston was the first of quite a few places in England where the Prince was cheered as he rode by and where he was joined by some English volunteers for his Army. One Jacobite eyewitness noted that from Preston onwards, &quot;at every town we were received with ringing of bells, and at night we have bonfires, and illuminations&quot;. Another Jacobite eyewitness noted in a private letter from Preston on 27 November 1745: &quot;People here are beginning to join [us] very fast; we have got about sixty recruits today&quot;. From 10 to 12 December the Prince gave his retreating Army a rest in Preston on their long, last and fatal retreat from Derby through Lancaster and Carlisle to their dreadful day of destiny the following 16 April on Culloden Moor near Inverness.

===Industrial revolution===
The 19th century saw a transformation in Preston from a small market town to a much larger industrial one, as the innovations of the latter half of the previous century such as Richard Arkwright&#x27;s water frame (invented in Preston) brought cotton mills to many northern English towns. With industrialisation came examples of both oppression and enlightenment.

The town&#x27;s forward-looking spirit is typified by it being the first English town outside London to be lit by gas. The Preston Gas Company was established in 1815 by, amongst others, a Catholic priest: Rev. Joseph &quot;Daddy&quot; Dunn of the Society of Jesus. The Preston and Wigan Railway arrived in 1838, shortly afterwards renamed the North Union Railway. The Sheffield firm of Thos. W. Ward Ltd opened a ship breaking yard at Preston Dock in 1894.

The more oppressive side of industrialisation was seen during the Preston Strike of 1842 on Saturday 13 August 1842, when a group of cotton workers demonstrated against the poor conditions in the town&#x27;s mills. The Riot Act was read and armed troops corralled the demonstrators in front of the Corn Exchange on Lune Street. Shots were fired and four of the demonstrators were killed. A commemorative sculpture now stands on the spot (although the soldiers and demonstrators represented are facing the wrong way). In the 1850s, Karl Marx visited Preston and later described the town as &quot;the next St Petersburg&quot;. Charles Dickens visited Preston in January 1854 during a strike by cotton workers that had by that stage lasted for 23 weeks. It is believed that the town of &quot;Coketown&quot; in the novel &quot;Hard Times&quot; was inspired by this visit to Preston. In 1858, the Preston Power Loom Weavers&#x27; Association was founded, and by 1920 it had more than 13,000 members in the town.
The Preston Temperance Society, led by Joseph Livesey pioneered the Temperance Movement in the 19th century. Indeed, the term teetotalism is believed to have been coined at one of its meetings. The website of the University of Central Lancashire library has a great deal of information on Joseph Livesey and the Temperance Movement in Preston.

Preston was one of only a few industrial towns in Lancashire to have a functioning corporation (local council) in 1835 (its charter dating to 1685), and was reformed as a municipal borough by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. It became the County Borough of Preston under the Local Government Act 1888. In 1974, county boroughs were abolished, and it became part of the larger part of the new non-metropolitan district, the Borough of Preston, which also included Fulwood Urban District and much of Preston Rural District. The borough acquired city status in 2002.

===Preston since the early 20th century===

By 1901, nearly 120,000 people were living in Preston, now a booming industrial town.

New industries arrived in Preston during the interwar years which helped ease the pain felt through the sharp decline of the cotton industry. Electrical goods manufacturing and engineering arrived in the town, and the building sector enjoyed a boom with nearly 3,000 council houses being built between 1920 and 1939. Some 1,500 houses were built for private sale.

Despite its heavy industry, Preston endured only a handful of Luftwaffe air raids in World War II and there were no fatalities in the town, although an air crash in the Freckleton district claimed the lives of 61 people in 1944.

For some 20 years after 1948, Preston became home to a significant number of Asian and Caribbean Commonwealth immigrants, who mostly worked in the manufacturing industry. However, an economic decline hit the town once again in the 1970s, capped by the closure of the Courtaulds factory in 1979 (nearly 3,000 job losses) and the decline of the docks on the River Ribble, which finally closed in 1981. Mass unemployment was firmly back in Preston by the early 1980s, although it was now very much a national crisis due to the recession of that time.

The rehousing of families from town centre slums to new council houses continued after World War II, though it slowed down to a virtual standstill after 1975. The face of the town centre began to change in the 1960s, with old developments being bulldozed and replaced by modern developments such as the St George&#x27;s Shopping Centre, which opened in 1966, and the Fishergate Shopping Centre which was built nearly 20 years later. The remains of the Victorian town hall, designed by George Gilbert Scott and mostly destroyed by fire in 1947, were replaced by an office block (Crystal House) in 1962, and a modern-architecture Guild Hall opened in 1972, to replace the Public Hall.

The town was by-passed by Britain&#x27;s very first motorway, built and operated by engineer James Drake, which was opened by Harold Macmillan in December 1958. Within a decade, this formed part of the M6 – giving Preston a direct motorway link with Manchester and Birmingham. The late 1960s saw the completion of Ringway, a bypass around the town centre, as well as a new bus station.

On 6 April 2012 the city&#x27;s residents performed the &quot;Preston Passion&quot;, a dramatised version of the Passion of Christ, which was broadcast live by BBC One.

==Governance==

The unparished urban settlement of Preston is represented by 19 of the 22 council wards within Preston City Council which is based at Preston Town Hall on Lancaster Road. From the 2024 General Election, Preston is divided between two Westminster constituencies, namely Preston and Ribble Valley. The County Hall is located on Fishergate and is the main office for Lancashire County Council.

==Geography==

The River Ribble provides a southern border for the city. The Forest of Bowland forms a backdrop to Preston to the northeast while the Fylde lies to the west. At , Preston is approximately north west of Manchester, north east of Liverpool, and east of the coastal town Blackpool.

The current borders came into effect on 1 April 1974, when the Local Government Act 1972 merged the existing County Borough of Preston with Fulwood Urban District as an unparished area within the Borough of Preston. Preston was designated as part of the Central Lancashire new town in 1970.

===Climate===
The climate of Preston is of a temperate maritime type, with a narrow range of temperatures, similar to the rest of the British Isles. Being relatively close to the Irish sea, this is more pronounced than areas to the south and east of Preston. The official Met Office weather station is located at Moor Park, less than north of the city centre, and surrounded by built-up areas, suggesting a degree of urban warming is likely, particularly during clear and calm nights.

The absolute high recorded at the weather station was during July 2022. In a typical year the warmest day should reach and 5.9 days in total should attain a maximum temperature of or more. In October 2011, a new record October high temperature of 26.9 °C was set.

The absolute minimum is , recorded during February 1969. In a typical year the coldest night should fall to , and 40.2 nights should receive an air frost. The lowest temperature in recent years was during December 2010.

Annual rainfall totals just under 1000 mm per year, with over 1 mm of precipitation falling on 150 days. All averages refer to the period 1971–2000.

In October 2014 Preston was officially ranked &quot;the wettest city in England&quot;, and third wettest in the UK behind Cardiff and Glasgow. It was also ranked &quot;the gloomiest city in England&quot;, as it gets fewer hours of sunshine in a year than any other English city or town. However, in March 2018 the Lancashire Evening Post reported that Preston has lost its &quot;soggy city status&quot; to the neighbouring city of Lancaster.

On 10 August 1893, approximately of rain fell in Preston in 5 minutes, being a record for the most rainfall to fall in that time in the United Kingdom.

== Religion ==
One of the proposed derivations of the city&#x27;s name coming from &#x27;Priests&#x27; town&#x27;. The lamb on the city shield is a biblical image of Jesus Christ, and the same image that represented 7th-century bishop St Wilfrid, the city&#x27;s patron saint who is historically linked to the city&#x27;s establishment. The &quot;PP&quot; on the city shield stands for &quot;Princeps Pacis&quot; (Prince of Peace), another title for Christ invoking Him as protector of the city, though it is also often taken to stand for the city&#x27;s nickname &quot;Proud Preston&quot;. In fact, there were originally three letters &quot;P&quot; on the coat of arms, with one being lost over time.

The 2001 Census recorded 72% of the population of the City of Preston as Christians, 10% as having no religion, and 8% as Muslims. The Hindu and Sikh populations are smaller at 3% and 0.6% respectively, but in both cases this represents the highest percentage of any local authority area in the North West. 2% of the city&#x27;s population were born in other EU countries. Though still small in number in Preston, the Latter-day Saints maintain a large profile.

Preston has places of worship for people of a wide variety of religions, including churches of many Christian denominations. There are also places of worship for Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Latter-day Saints, Sikhs and The Salvation Army, amongst others. Preston was also home to an Ashkenazi Orthodox Jewish synagogue on Avenham Place, formed in 1882, but this closed during the mid-1980s.

Preston has a significant Muslim (Sunni Branch, particularly Hanafi school) population, the majority of which is of Gujarati Indian descent. The Muslim population is centred in the Deepdale, Riversway, Fishwick, Fulwood and Frenchwood areas. Preston has 12 mosques: five in Deepdale &amp; St George&#x27;s, one in Frenchwood, one in Riversway, two in Adelphi and three in Fishwick.

===Church denominations===

A wide range of denominations are, or have been, represented in the city including: Latin Church Catholics, Baptist, Christadelphian, Congregational, Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s Connexion, Evangelical, Methodist, Pentecostal, Presbyterian, Swedenborgian and Wesleyan Methodist. The Society of Friends meet at the Preston Friends Meeting House at 189 St George&#x27;s Road.

Preston has a strong Roman Catholic Christian history and tradition, recently noted by Archbishop Vincent Nichols in his Guild 2012 Mass Homily: &quot;The history of the Christian and Catholic faith is long and deep here in Preston.&quot; Preston lies in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lancaster and the Anglican Diocese of Blackburn. There are at least 73 churches, chapels, missions and meeting houses, as well as 15 cemeteries and burial sites, for which records exist.

Carey Baptist Church, on Pole Street, was built in 1826 for the Calvinistic Methodists of Lady Huntington. Formerly known as St Paul&#x27;s Chapel, it was purchased by the Baptists in 1855. It is a Grade II listed building. The church survives remains active in the community.

Preston was the location of the world&#x27;s first foreign mission of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (commonly known as the Mormons). As early as 1837 the first Latter-day Saint missionaries to Great Britain began preaching in Preston and, in particular, other small towns situated along the River Ribble. Preston is home to the world&#x27;s oldest continuous branch (a small congregation) of the church. An official memorial to the church pioneers may be found in the Japanese Garden in Avenham Park. In 1998 the church erected a large temple at Chorley, near Preston, described by The Telegraph newspaper as &quot;spectacular&quot;. The temple is officially known as the Preston England Temple.

===Church buildings===

St. John&#x27;s Minster, formerly the Church of St John the Evangelist and prior to the reformation; St Wilfrid&#x27;s Parish Church, is located on Church Street, in the centre of the city. From its origin, it has been the parish church of Preston. The church of St George the Martyr, located on Georges Road, was founded in 1723. One of the many large active Roman Catholic parish churches is St Thomas of Canterbury and the English Martyrs, located on Garstang Road.

St Walburge&#x27;s Church, designed by Joseph Hansom of Hansom Cab fame, has, at , the tallest spire in England on a church that is not a cathedral and the third tallest in the UK.

In July 2016, St Ignatius Church in Preston, which had been gifted by the Catholic Diocese of Lancaster to the Syro-Malabar Catholic community, was raised to the status of a cathedral by Pope Francis. It now serves as the seat of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Eparchy of Great Britain.

==Landmarks==

There are many notable buildings dotted in and around the city centre including the Miller Arcade, the Town Hall, the Harris Museum, the Minster Church of St. John the Evangelist (formerly Preston Parish Church, elevated to Minster church status in June 2003), the former Corn Exchange and Public Hall, St. Wilfrid&#x27;s Catholic Church, Fishergate Baptist Church, and many beautiful Georgian buildings on Winckley Square. Many Catholic and Anglican parish churches are also to be found throughout the city. HMP Preston is also a good example of a typical Victorian radial-design prison. Modern architecture is represented by the Guild Hall and Preston bus station, which was featured on the 2012 World Monuments Fund&#x27;s list of sites at risk due to threats of demolition, before becoming Grade II listed.

===Listed buildings===

The chimney of the Grade II listed Tulketh Mill was designed by engineer Fred Dixon of Bolton for the Tulketh Spinning Company and dates from 1905. It has its own Grade II listing, the designation record describing it as &quot;very tall, forms group with associated mill, both being very prominent landmarks to the north-west of the town&quot;.

===Monuments and public artworks===
Preston has a number of notable monuments and public artworks, including:
* Obelisk: located opposite the Cenotaph on Preston&#x27;s Market Square, the Obelisk dates back to 1782 and was originally installed for the Guild celebration of the same year.
* Peace Gardens: located on Friargate, the gardens, designed by Graham Mort, originally housed the praying hands sculpture which now resides on Fylde Road.
* Preston Martyrs&#x27; Memorial: located in front of the Corn Exchange in Lune Street, this sculpture marks the site of the Lune Street Riots which occurred during the 1842 General Strike, when troops opened fire on striking mills workers, killing four and injuring three.
* &quot;The Splash&quot;: a sculpture of Tom Finney, located in front of the Deepdale football stadium. The statue is based upon a famous photo taken of Finney in a game against Chelsea in 1956, which was named England&#x27;s Sports Photograph of the Year.
* A bronze Wallace and Gromit bench statue, with Wallace in &quot;Wrong Trousers and Gromit&quot; reading his newspaper on the bench, was erected in September 2021 at the south market hall entrance to the Covered Market to commemorate its creator Nick Park, who originated from Preston. Their archnemesis, Feathers McGraw, soon joined them when his statue was unveiled by Nick Park as part of the opening of the Animate extension in February 2025.
* Cotton Reel: designed by artist designed by Van Nong, this sculpture of a large cotton reel and needle is located in Avenham Road (between the city centre and Avenham Park) and commemorates the former Simpsons Gold Thread Works, which advanced the science of gold thread manufacture and from 1839 provided gold and silver thread for the military, royalty, cruise ships (including the Titanic), and Freemasons.
* Landscape With Trees: designed by artist Clare Bigger, this series of four metre high stainless steel pylons of stylised trees is located in Friargate in the city centre.
==Economy==
Preston has seen many changes over the course of its history in regards to its local economy, shifting from a market town to the textile industry and more recently to tertiary education and research.

The city was home to Alstom Transport&#x27;s main UK spare parts distribution centre (formerly GEC Traction Ltd) until it transferred operations to Widnes in July 2018. Matalan Retail Ltd was also founded in Preston under the name Matalan Cash and Carry. Although the head office of Matalan moved to Skelmersdale in 1998, the city still has the tax office for the company (located in Winckley Square).

Goss Graphic Systems Limited, a global supplier of printing presses based in the United States, formerly employed more than 1,000 people in Preston, but in 2007 the company moved manufacturing to the United States, China and Japan and now has around 160 employees in the city.

Unemployment in Preston rose 15% in the year up to April 2012 to a total of 3,783 claimants. However, in November 2018 Preston was named as &quot;Most improved city in UK&quot;, with unemployment down to 3.1% from 6.5% in 2014, and improvements above the national average for health, transport, the work-life balance of its residents, and for the skills among both the youth and adult populations.

===Major employers===
Preston is a major centre of the British defence aerospace industry with BAE Systems, the UK&#x27;s principal military aircraft design, development and manufacture supplier, having its Military Aircraft headquarters located in nearby Warton. The company has two of its major facilities located some miles on either side of the city. BAE Warton is located to the western side of the city whilst BAE Samlesbury is located to the east, over the M6 motorway. BAE Systems also operate large office facilities at the Portway area within the city and at The Strand office complex.

On 20 February 2006, the telecommunications retailer The Carphone Warehouse took over Tulketh Mill (formerly the home of the Littlewoods catalogue call centre) in the Ashton-on-Ribble area of the city. The building has undergone an extensive interior refurbishment and since March 2007 had been the workplace of some 800 employees. The site&#x27;s main purpose was as a call centre for the broadband and landline services provider TalkTalk as well as The Post Office and Student Loans Company. The site also housed call centres for Team Knowhow and Carphone Warehouse which are now part of Dixons Carphone. It was officially opened on 19 December 2006 by CEO Charles Dunstone and the Mayor of Preston. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, Dixons Carphone along with other tenants within Tulketh Mill, moved to a hybrid working solution (time split between working from home and working from the office), eventually moving to a permanent working from home solution and as of August 2022 Dixons Carphone no longer have any operations based in Tulketh Mill.

Due to Preston&#x27;s location as a transport hub, sitting between the M6, M55, M65, and M61 it is home to several freight and haulage companies. Haulage supplier and operator James Hall and Co who supply produce for Spar stores in the north of England have their head office – the biggest building in the city of Preston – located just off the M6 Junction 31a at Bowland View.

The Riversway area (in the Ashton-on-Ribble area of the city) is also home to the Preston Docklands, once Europe&#x27;s largest single dock basin, which has undergone redevelopment. Several office areas around the docks, along with significant residential presence. Several small businesses such as the Football League&#x27;s LFE headquarters are based in the area, together with Riversway Developments who have been responsible for some of this redevelopment.

The financial sector also has a presence in the city with a large selection of consultancies, insurance and law firms based in Winckley Square in the city centre.

The Westinghouse Electric Company (formerly BNFL) Springfields nuclear processing plant also lies to the west of the city boundary at Salwick.

Skiddle is an event ticketing operation based in Preston since 2001, which claims to be the UK&#x27;s largest what&#x27;s on the guide.

===Retail===
Retail is also a major contributor to Preston&#x27;s economy. The city&#x27;s main high streets are Fishergate and Friargate which offer shops, bars and restaurants with many more tucked away down the side streets. Two major shopping centres are located along the high streets:
*Fishergate Shopping Centre – which had a Debenhams department store (closed May 2021)
*St George&#x27;s Shopping Centre (formerly &quot;The Mall Preston&quot;) – a popular centrally located shopping mall dating from the 1960s.

Preston is also home to the historic Covered Market and Fishmarket. In 2016 these sites were redeveloped, and the old covered market now contains the new Market Hall and the Outdoor and Secondhand Markets, and the old fish market now contains the Box Market, a unique shopping space consisting of upgraded shipping containers. Market vendors sell fresh and local quality meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, and dairy products, other hot and cold food to eat in or take away, as well as brewed ales and artisan coffee. The markets are open Monday–Saturday, and on Tuesdays a car boot sale operates from the Outdoor Market.

Also in the city centre is the Miller Arcade, a specialist shopping centre in a listed building (which formerly included public baths), is situated off Fishergate near the Harris Museum.

The first KFC outlet in the UK was opened on Fishergate in 1965.

A number of large retail shopping centres can be found in Preston&#x27;s suburbs and surrounding towns, including:

*Deepdale Shopping park, on the A5085 Blackpool Road on the northern edge of the city, has over 30 major stores Free parking is provided for over 1,000 cars.

*Riversway Retail Park, located off the A583 Riversway at Ashton-on-Ribble. Free parking is provided.

*Capitol Centre Retail Park on the A6 London Way just outside the city boundary at Walton-le-Dale, in the neighbouring borough of South Ribble. The centre has over 20 major stores. Free car parking is provided along with a bus interchange.

*South Rings Business Park is located several miles outside Preston, off the A6 at Bamber Bridge, near the intersection of the M6, M65 and M61 motorways. Free car parking is provided.

===Education and research===
The University of Central Lancashire (&quot;UCLan &quot;) has become a major employer and source of economic growth not just for Preston in recent years, but for Lancashire as a whole, providing direct and indirect benefits to the local economy through employment, housing and retail.

The Regeneris Report commissioned by the Lancashire County Council in 2013/14 found that UCLan:
* contributed over £200m to the North West economy
* was one of the largest employers in Preston and supported an estimated 4,300 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) jobs in the North West through its core economic footprint and through the expenditure of students
* with 36,160 students was the largest university in Lancashire and the third-largest in the North West, with the 9th largest undergraduate population of all UK universities
* graduates add on average £24m to the North West economy per annum through increased skills and productivity

In terms of direct economic benefits, in 2013/14 UCLan:
* directly employed 3,290 staff 
* spent £15 million on suppliers based throughout Lancashire and the wider North West area
* had 18,390 full-time students residing in the North West who spent a total of £210m throughout the region, with £155m of that being spent in Lancashire.

In 2015, UCLan announced its intention to create historic and transformational change at its Preston Campus through a £200 million development programme entitled Campus Masterplan 2020. UCLan&#x27;s vision over the next five years is to create a unified, sustainable and welcoming campus which will enhance the experience for all those visiting the university. The long-term vision is to spark a major focus on regeneration and business investment in the university quarter, reinforce the university&#x27;s ties to the local community and create wider benefits for Preston and beyond.

September 2019 saw the opening of the £35 million Engineering Innovation Centre (EIC), a facility with integrated teaching and research space.


Also under development is the £57 million Student Centre and public square, which will provide a new campus reception building housing several student services, meeting rooms, office space, event venues and a rooftop garden. The new public square, provisionally known as &quot;Adelphi Square&quot;, will span over 8,400 square metres and will be constructed in front of the new student centre and opposite the EIC, on empty land that was previously the site of the Fylde Building and public land bought by UCLan from the council. The project has seen the demolition of existing housing in St Peter&#x27;s Square opposite the UCLan Library and St Peter&#x27;s Arts Centre, and redevelopment of the A583 and other nearby public roadways, including the Adelphi roundabout, which will result in revised traffic flows. Construction commenced in the third quarter of 2019 and is expected to be completed in 2021. On 30 July 2021 UCLan officially took ownership of the new Student Centre and University Square (which had provisionally been known as Adephi Square) when a ceremonial key was presented to the university&#x27;s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Graham Baldwin, by the project&#x27;s major contractor Bowmer + Kirkland. The building became operational in September 2021.

As UCLan increases in the global rankings, it continues to attract more international students, researchers and Fellows, as well as partnerships with international learning institutions. It is anticipated that further economics benefits from increased foreign investment and business opportunities should entail.

===Proposed developments===
An £800 million regeneration project known as the Tithebarn Project was also planned for Preston. The project was originally managed by property giants Grosvenor and Lendlease, Grosvenor withdrew from the project, followed a few years later by Lendlease. The project was dependent upon a number of requirements (such as the re-location of the current bus station, which would cost at least £25million, and be funded largely by the taxpayer). In November 2011, it was announced that John Lewis, who were originally intended to be the major flagship store of the Tithebarn development had also withdrawn from the project, effectively killing it. The council is now exploring more piecemeal ways of bringing in development and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn praises Preston for its &quot;inspiring innovation&quot;.

Since city status was awarded in 2002, Preston has been targeted by a number of developers. Residential developments were particularly popular with new apartments planned in and around the city centre. Many of these developments however are still struggling to find buyers for these apartments, and there are rising numbers of repossessions. Office and hotel space is also in demand and a new Central Business District is being planned as well as a number of new hotels.

===Culture and music ===
In September 2024 Moor Park in the city was the venue for &quot;Radio 2 in the Park&quot;, with guest artists including Sting, Sister Sledge, Manic Street Preachers and the Pet Shop Boys.

==Transport==
The Guild Wheel is a public footpath and cycle route, created in 2012 in celebration of the Preston Guild and officially opened in August of that year. in length, it encircles Preston, linking the city to the countryside and surrounding villages. Walking and cycling on the pathway along the banks of the Lancaster Canal is popular among the city&#x27;s residents and visitors.

The nearest airports from Preston with scheduled service are Liverpool John Lennon Airport and Manchester Airport, about south-west and south-east of the city respectively. Manchester Airport is linked by a direct rail service operated by TransPennine Express. Blackpool Airport, approximately to the west of Preston, provides facilities for private aviation and charter flights. Although not a public airport, Warton Aerodrome is an active airfield west of the city and is the airfield for the BAE Warton factory. BAE Samlesbury to the east of the town was an active aerodrome, with a gliding club, but today serves as a facility for BAE Systems and no longer supports flying activities.

In December 2020, the Lancashire County Council approved a proposal to construct a new station in Lea west of the city, to service new housing estates being built in the area. The proposed station will be located near the site of the former Lea Road station which closed in 1938. Although a timeline is yet to be established and construction yet to begin, government funding of £22.3M (along with local funding of £21.M) is conditional that it must be spent by 2023.

==== Preston Dock branch line ====
With the industrialisation of Preston in the 19th century a branch line was built in 1846 from Preston&#x27;s mail station to carry goods to and from Victoria Quay on the River Ribble. With the opening of the Albert Edward Basin and the new Preston Dock in 1892, the number and length of tracks increased and at their peak grew to over 25 miles.

With the closure of the docks in 1981 and its subsequent redevelopment, most of the tracks were removed and now only a small section remains, used by the Ribble Steam Railway (RSR) and for bitumen trains operating to and from the Total refinery at the Riversway industrial park.

A single station, Preston Riverside, is operated by the RSR for its heritage rail trips.

===Water===
====River Ribble====
The River Ribble has a length of approximately , originating near the Ribblehead Viaduct in North Yorkshire, flowing westward and passing through Preston and entering the Irish Sea at the Ribble and Alt Estuaries near Lytham, approximately to the west of the city.

The Ribble has played an important role in the history of Preston. Archaeological evidence confirms human settlement along its banks going back to neolithic times, as well as the Saxon and Roman eras. The river was already a trading port by medieval times, increasing in use and importance in conjunction with the industrialisation of Preston, until the closure of the Port of Preston in 1981.

The river suffers from an on-going issue of sedimentation, and was regularly dredged downstream of Preston while the city had an active port. Since dredging operations ceased, silt from the river is now spreading more widely over the beaches of its estuary.

====Preston Dock====

Preston Dock was a former maritime dock located on the northern bank of the River Ribble approximately west of the city centre. It was the location of the Port of Preston at the Albert Edward Basin which opened in 1892 and is connected to the river by a series of locks. The dock provided a port for shipping and ferry operations until its closure in 1981.

Records show that Preston was already a trading port by the 12th century and from around the mid-14th century ships would come up the river to unload and shelter in a natural basin known in its time as &#x27;Preston Anchorage&#x27;, where the Moor Brook joined the Ribble. In 1806 the Ribble Navigation Company was formed, and construction of the New Quays wharf (later renamed Victoria Quay) commenced a few years later further downstream along the section of the river where Marsh Lane joined Strand Road.

Sedimentation and the shallowness of the Ribble limited access to Victoria Quay to when the tide was high, and it was proposed that the river be diverted and an artificial tidal basin created whose water level could be controlled to allow 24-hour loading and unloading operations. In 1884 diversion of the Ribble began along with and the excavation of the what was to be the Albert Edward Basin along its northern bank, and in June 1892 the new Preston Dock was opened. However, the on-going issue of sedimentation required constant dredging of the Ribble and along with loss of trade to large ports around the country, the docks never returned a profit, leading to their closure in October 1981.

Redevelopment of the former docks began in 1985 and continued through to 1992. Renamed &quot;Riversway&quot;, the first of the new retail and industrial estates, along with new roads, were opened in July 1987. Development of residential housing commenced in 1989, with the new estate along the basin&#x27;s southern shore named Victoria Quay after the earlier docks.

These days, the Albert Edward basin is used only for leisure activities, is home to many waterbirds. A public marina is located on its northwestern end, and access to and from the River Ribble is provided through the basin&#x27;s original locks, operated by the Preston City Council; operating times are seasonal.

====Lancaster Canal====
The Lancaster Canal runs from Preston to Kendal in Cumbria. It was originally planned to join the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Westhoughton and while the section north to near Chorley was built, the section south from Preston was never built. Instead, a &quot;temporary&quot; bridge – which still stands today – was constructed over the Ribble near Avenham Park, and a tramway operated from 1803 to Walton Summit.

From 1820 packet boats carried passengers between Preston and Kendal, providing faster journeys than the stagecoaches of the day, and by 1833 travel time had been reduced to seven hours. From the 1930s leakage problems caused sections of the canal, now owned by the LMS Railway, around Kendal to be closed to public traffic. However, the canal remained navigable to coal traffic from Preston to the Kendal Gas Works until 1944, but in 1955 the whole canal was closed to all traffic by an Act of Parliament. Subsequently, sections of the canal were filled in, later to be re-opened as interest in the canal returned, and currently, of the canal from Preston to Tewitfield near Carnforth is open to navigation.

At Preston the canal originally terminated at a large boat basin located in the city centre between Marsh Lane and the A59 Ring Road, on the western side of Corporation Street. An aqueduct carried the canal from its current terminus on the northern side of Aqueduct Street in at Ashton-on-Ribble, past the former Maudlands railway station, paralleling the eastern side of the railway to the basin, where railway tracks, long since removed, provided access originally to Victoria Quay and later to the new Preston Dock. Following the Second World War, as many industries around Preston closed, this section of the canal became derelict and in the 1960s it was filled in and a new terminus with mooring facilities built at Ashton. The land through which the canal ran is now the campus of the University of Central Lancashire, with the Sir Tom Finney Sports Centre located over the former boat slip, and the site of the boat basin now a small retail mall with an Aldi supermarket.

Originally the canal was isolated from the River Ribble, but this changed in 2002 with the opening of the Ribble Link.

====Ribble Link====

Opened in July 2002, the Ribble Link is a navigation waterway built along a section of the Savick Brook that connects the previously isolated Lancaster Canal to the River Ribble. Featuring a series of locks, the Link allows narrowboats and other small watercraft to transit between the two waterways.

The Link is approximately in length, starting from the Lancaster Canal near Ingol and entering the Ribble (as the Savick Brook) south of Lea Gate. There are eight (8) locks in total, permitting boats up to length and in width to navigate its course.

Unlike a canal, vessels are not free to travel in either direction at any time. Traffic flow is controlled so that the Link can only be navigated in a specific direction on alternate days. The Link is only open for approximately 90 days between April and October, and is used by approximately 200 boats a year.

The Link is operated by the Canal &amp; River Trust and requires annual dredging to remain navigable.

====Proposed developments====
In 2006 the Preston City Council, in conjunction with the South Ribble Borough Council, proposed a major development estimated at £800 million to redevelop the city&#x27;s docks and large sections of the River Ribble. Known as &quot;Riverworks&quot;, the plan proposed new leisure facilities (watersports), landmark buildings, a new central park opposite Avenham Park, office and retail space, new residential developments and the re-opening of some of Preston&#x27;s old canal with new facilities for a &quot;park and boat ride&quot; scheme. The proposal met with considerable resistance from the local community (with 74% of residents objecting) and leisure and environmental groups due to the potential loss of green space, impact upon ecosystems (especially fish populations) and increased risk of flooding resulted in protests and campaigns being organised to have the project cancelled.

In December 2007 the Preston City Council pulled out of a major part of the Riversworks plan, the highly contentious Ribble Barrage, and stated the revised plan would only look at improving Preston Docklands (in particular, the on-going blue green algae problem) and extending the Lancaster Canal from its current terminus at Ashton into the city at the back of the University of Central Lancashire (near the site of the former boat basin which was filled in prior to the construction of the current campus).

A subsequent change in council&#x27;s &quot;Sustainable Community Strategy&quot;, especially in regards to &quot;Environmental&quot;, &quot;Health and Well-being&quot; and &quot;People and Communities&quot; policies and targets, resulted in a ban on development on green belt land, and along with city&#x27;s new Local Plan, the remaining (re)development proposals within the Riverworks plan were abandoned.

===Roads===

The Preston By-pass, opened 5 December 1958, became the first stretch of motorway in the UK and is now part of the M6 with a short section now forming part of the M55. It was built to ease traffic congestion caused by tourists travelling to the popular destinations of Blackpool and The Lake District. The first traffic cones were used during its construction, replacing red lantern paraffin burners.

In the 1980s, a motorway around the west of the city which would have been an extension of the M65 to the M55 was started but never finished. Originally, the M55 had no junction 2, because it was reserved for this new western bypass; however the construction of junction 2 began in 2019 and will create a link with the A583, close to the Riversway Docklands, in order to alleviate traffic on the M55 and the A6 at the Broughton Interchange to the north of Preston. The project is known as the Preston Western Distributor. The M6 between junctions 30 and 32 was widened extensively between 1993–95 to compensate. Junction 31A which has only a northbound exit and a southbound entry opened in 1997 to serve a nearby business park. Other motorways terminating close to the city are the M61 – Preston to Manchester via Chorley and Bolton,
the M65 – Preston to Colne via Blackburn, Accrington and Burnley and the M55 – Preston to Blackpool via Kirkham.

Preston has several Taxi, Private Hire and Cab Companies serving Preston and surrounding Villages, including Millers, Uber and Preston Taxis

In conjunction with car parking facilities at the bus station, local services operate to and from two park and rides located on the outskirts of the city to minimise private vehicular traffic in the city centre; one at Portway in the Riversway area, and the other off the A6 at Walton-le-Dale.
Local, regional and national bus services operate from the Preston bus station, which is located on the southeast edge of the city centre off the A59 and claimed by some residents to be the largest or second largest station in Europe.

====National and regional bus services====
The national operators National Express, Eurolines, and Megabus provide services from the bus station to and from various major cities and destination en-route across the United Kingdom.

Stagecoach provides services to the nearby towns and cities of Blackpool, Blackburn, Bolton, Liverpool, Manchester, Southport and Wigan as well as Lancaster and Morecambe under the Stagecoach in Lancaster service.

Blackburn Bus Company, part of the Transdev group, operates the 152 Hotline route to Blackburn and Burnley. An independent company, John Fishwick &amp; Sons, that provided frequent services into the city centre from Lower Penwortham, Lostock Hall, Leyland, Euxton and Chorley, ceased trading in October 2015.

====Local bus services====
Many services between Preston and the surrounding area are operated by Ribble Motor Services which became part of the Stagecoach Group, using the name Stagecoach in Lancashire. 

Preston Bus, formerly the city&#x27;s municipal bus company, operate local services within the city.

In October 2006, Preston Bus started operating two orbital bus routes.
Competition for routes and passengers resulted in a bus war between the two companies after buses were deregulated. On 23 January 2009, Preston Bus was sold to Stagecoach for over £10.4 million. Routes were changed and the services were branded Stagecoach in Preston. Following a lengthy investigation which began soon after the takeover, the Competition Commission ruled on 11 November 2009 that the action by Stagecoach had adversely affected competition in the area and ordered it to sell Preston Bus. In January 2011, Rotala announced it had agreed to take over Preston Bus.

====Bus stop displays====
Preston was one of the first cities in the UK to have displays fitted to every bus stop which aim to provide an accurate time and destination of the next bus arriving using GPS tracking. The service, initially restricted to services within the borough, was expanded to cover Fishwick&#x27;s 111 Preston to Leyland route but was discontinued in 2011, and reinstated on some routes in 2013.

===Preston North End F.C.===

Preston North End F.C. were one of the founder members of the Football League and the first team to be crowned English football champions. They play at Deepdale Football Ground which was also the original site of the National Football Museum. The museum closed in 2011 in preparation for its move to Manchester due to funding issues.

Preston were champions of the Football League in its first two seasons, but have not won it since. Their last major trophy came in 1938 when they won the FA Cup, and they have not played top division football since 1961. They are one of the few English league clubs to have been champions of all four tiers of the English professional league.

Dick, Kerr&#x27;s Ladies, one of the successful early women&#x27;s football teams in Britain, called Preston home, starting in 1917. They were one of the first ladies teams to play an international match against an overseas side when they played against a team from Paris in the spring of 1920. They played a series of matches in the north west of England, and at Stamford Bridge, London. The opening match of the tour was played at Deepdale, the home of Preston North End, in front of 25,000 spectators, a record for the ground at that time.

===UCLan Sports Arena===

<doc id="88919" wikidata="Q840825" url="?curid=88919" title="Discredited HIV/AIDS origins theories">
<text>Various fringe theories have arisen to speculate about purported alternative origins for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), with claims ranging from it being due to accidental exposure to supposedly purposeful acts. Several inquiries and investigations have been carried out as a result, and each of these theories has consequently been determined to be based on unfounded and/or false information. HIV has been shown to have evolved from or be closely related to the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in West Central Africa sometime in the early 20th century. HIV was discovered in the 1980s by the French scientist Luc Montagnier. Before the 1980s, HIV was an unknown deadly disease.
==Discredited theories==

===Smallpox vaccination theory===
In 1987 there was some consideration given to the possibility that the &quot;AIDS epidemic may have been triggered by the mass vaccination campaign which eradicated smallpox&quot;. An article in &quot;The Times&quot; suggested this, attributing to an unnamed &quot;adviser to WHO&quot; the quote &quot;I believe the smallpox vaccine theory is the explanation to the explosion of AIDS&quot;. It is now thought that the smallpox vaccine causes serious complications for people who already have impaired immune systems, and the &quot;Times&quot; article described the case of a military recruit with &quot;dormant HIV&quot; who died within months of receiving it. But no citation was provided regarding people who did not previously have HIV. Currently several professional publications describe HIV as a contraindication for the smallpox vaccine—both for an infected person and their sexual partners and household members. Some conspiracy theorists propose an expanded hypothesis in which the smallpox vaccine was deliberately contaminated with HIV.

In contrast, a research article was published in 2010 suggesting that it might have been the actual eradication of smallpox and the subsequent &quot;ending&quot; of the mass vaccination campaign that contributed to the sudden emergence of HIV. The theory was the possibility that immunization against smallpox &quot;might play a role in providing an individual with some degree of protection to subsequent HIV infection and/or disease progression.&quot; Regardless of the effects of the smallpox vaccine itself, its use in practice in Africa is one of the categories of un-sterile injections that may have contributed to the spread and mutation of the immunodeficiency viruses.

===Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) theory===

The dermatologist Alan Cantwell, in self-published books entitled &quot;AIDS and the Doctors of Death: An Inquiry into the Origin of the AIDS Epidemic&quot; (1988) and &quot;Queer Blood: The Secret AIDS Genocide Plot&quot; (1993), said that HIV is a genetically modified organism developed by U.S. Government scientists. The virus was then introduced into the population through hepatitis B (via the hepatitis B vaccine) experiments performed on gay and bisexual men between 1978 and 1981 in major U.S. cities. Cantwell claims that these experiments were directed by Wolf Szmuness, and that there was an ongoing government cover-up of the origins of the AIDS epidemic. Similar theories have been advanced by Robert B. Strecker, Matilde Krim, and Milton William Cooper.

===Oral polio vaccine (OPV) theory===

In the 1999 version of his OPV AIDS hypothesis, Edward Hooper proposed that early batches of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) grown in cultures of chimpanzee kidney cells, infected with a chimpanzee virus, were the original source of HIV-1 in Central Africa. A vial of the batch most strongly implicated by Hooper was found in storage in the UK, and analysis found no HIV/SIV sequences or chimpanzee cellular components, but did find traces of macaque mitochondria. Analysis of five samples of OPV in storage at the Wistar Institute, including one from a batch used in the Belgian Congo between 1958 and 1960, found no chimpanzee DNA. Other molecular biology and phylogenetic studies also contradict the hypothesis, and scientific consensus regards it as disproven. A 2004 article in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; described the hypothesis as &quot;refuted&quot;.

===Additional theories===
These theories generally attribute HIV&#x27;s origin to the US government or its contractors:

====Created at Fort Detrick====
Jakob Segal (1911–1995), a professor at Humboldt University in then-East Germany, proposed that HIV was engineered at a U.S. military laboratory at Fort Detrick, by splicing together two other viruses, Visna and HTLV-1. According to his theory, the new virus, created between 1977 and 1978, was tested on prison inmates who had volunteered for the experiment in exchange for early release. He further suggested that it was through these prisoners that the virus was spread to the population at large.

At the end of the Cold War, former KGB agents Vasili Mitrokhin and Oleg Gordievsky independently revealed that the Fort Detrick hypothesis was a propaganda operation devised by the KGB&#x27;s First Chief Directorate codenamed &quot;Operation Denver&quot;. This revelation was later supported by officer Günther Bohnensack of section X of East Germany&#x27;s Main Directorate for Reconnaissance.

It is known that Segal was in close contact with Russian KGB officers and Mitrokhin mentioned him as a central asset of the operation. It is not entirely clear whether Segal pursued the hypothesis independently on his own accord or whether he was simply following orders. Segal himself always denied the latter and kept pursuing the hypothesis even after the operation had been canceled and the Cold War had ended.

====Conspiracy to decrease the population====
In &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot; (1991), radio broadcaster and author Milton William Cooper (1943–2001) proposed that AIDS was the result of a conspiracy to decrease the populations of blacks, Hispanics, and homosexuals.

==Prevalence of conspiracy beliefs==
According to Phil Wilson, executive director of the Black AIDS Institute in Los Angeles, conspiracy theories are becoming a barrier to the prevention of AIDS since people start to believe that no matter what measures they take, they can still be prone to contracting this disease. A 2005 study suggests this makes them less careful when engaging in practices that put them at risk because they believe there is no point. &quot;Nearly half of the 500 African Americans surveyed said that HIV is man-made. More than one-quarter said they believed that AIDS was produced in a government laboratory, and 12 percent believed it was created and spread by the CIA ... At the same time, 75 percent said they believed medical and public health agencies are working to stop the spread of AIDS in black communities.&quot;

==Prominent endorsers of discredited theories==

=== Nation of Islam ===
The Nation of Islam endorses the view that governments and pharmaceutical companies have pursued genocidal racist policies including the creation and spread of HIV. Consequently, the group called for a boycott of U.S.-sponsored vaccination programs for children. Leonard Horowitz has been cited as influential in the boycott decision.

=== Wangari Maathai ===
The 2004 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and environmental activist Wangari Maathai was asked by a &quot;Time&quot; magazine interviewer if she stood by a previous alleged claim that &quot;AIDS is a biological weapon manufactured by the developed world to wipe out the black race&quot;. Maathai responded, &quot;I have no idea who created AIDS and whether it is a biological agent or not. But I do know things like that don&#x27;t come from the moon. ... I guess there is some truth that must not be too exposed.&quot; Maathai subsequently issued a written statement in December 2004: &quot;I neither say nor believe that the virus was developed by white people or white powers in order to destroy the African people. Such views are wicked and destructive.&quot;

=== Manto Tshabalala-Msimang ===
In 2000 South Africa&#x27;s Minister of Health Manto Tshabalala-Msimang received criticism for distributing the chapter from Cooper&#x27;s book discussing this theory to senior South African government officials. Nicoli Nattrass, a longtime critic of AIDS denialists, criticized Tshabalala-Msimang for lending legitimacy to Cooper&#x27;s theories and disseminating them in Africa.

<text>Melqart () was the tutelary god of the Phoenician city-state of Tyre and a major deity in the Phoenician and Punic pantheons. He may have been central to the founding-myths of various Phoenician colonies throughout the Mediterranean, as well as the source of several myths concerning the exploits of Heracles. Many cities were thought to be founded (in one way or another) and protected by Melqart, no doubt springing from the original Phoenician practice of building a Temple of Melqart at new colonies. Similar to Tammuz and Adonis, he symbolized an annual cycle of death and rebirth. 

Reflecting his dual role as both protector of the world and ruler of the underworld, he was often shown holding an Ankh or Flower as a symbol of life, and a fenestrated axe as a symbol of death.

As Tyrian trade, colonization and settlement expanded, Melqart became venerated in Phoenician and Punic cultures across the Mediterranean, especially its colonies of Carthage and Cádiz. During the high point of Phoenician civilization between 1000 and 500 BCE, Melqart was associated with other pantheons and often venerated accordingly. Most notably, he was identified with the Greek Heracles and the Roman Hercules from at least the sixth century BCE, and eventually became interchangeable with his Greek counterpart. 

In Cyprus, Melqart was syncretized with Eshmun and Asclepius, and also in Ibiza, as given by a dedication reciting: &quot;to his lord, Eshmun-Melqart&quot;. In Tyre, women, foreigners, and pork were not allowed in the sanctuary of Melqart&#x27;s temple.
==Etymology ==
Melqart was written in the Phoenician abjad as ( &quot;Mīlqārt&quot;). Edward Lipinski theorizes that it was derived from ( &quot;Mīlk-Qārt&quot;), which means &quot;King of the City&quot;. The name is sometimes transcribed as Melkart, Melkarth, or Melgart. In Akkadian, his name was written Milqartu.

To the Greeks and the Romans, who identified Melqart with Hercules, he was often distinguished as the .

==Cult==

Melqart was possibly the Ba‘al found in the Tanakh (the Jewish Bible, specifically in 1 Kings 16.31–10.26) whose worship was prominently introduced to Israel by King Ahab and largely eradicated by King Jehu. In 1 Kings 18.27, it is possible that there is a mocking reference to legendary Heraclean journeys made by the god and to the annual &quot;egersis&quot; (&quot;awakening&quot;) of the god:

And it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said, &quot;Cry out loud: for he is a god; either he is lost in thought, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened.&quot;

The Phoenician novelist, Heliodorus of Emesa, in his &quot;Aethiopica,&quot; refers to the dancing of sailors in honor of the Tyrian Heracles: &quot;Now they leap spiritedly into the air, now they bend their knees to the ground and revolve on them like persons possessed.&quot;

The historian Herodotus recorded (2.44):
In the wish to get the best information that I could on these matters, I made a voyage to Tyre in Phoenicia, hearing there was a temple of Heracles at that place, very highly venerated. I visited the temple, and found it richly adorned with a number of offerings, among which were two pillars, one of pure gold, the other of &quot;smaragdos&quot;, shining with great brilliance at night. In a conversation which I held with the priests, I inquired how long their temple had been built, and found by their answer that they, too, differed from the Hellenes. They said that the temple was built at the same time that the city was founded, and that the foundation of the city took place 2,300 years ago. In Tyre I remarked another temple where the same god was worshipped as the Thasian Heracles. So I went on to Thasos, where I found a temple of Heracles which had been built by the Phoenicians who colonised that island when they sailed in search of Europa. Even this was five generations earlier than the time when Heracles, son of Amphitryon, was born in Hellas. These researches show plainly that there is an ancient god Heracles; and my own opinion is that those Hellenes act most wisely who build and maintain two temples of Heracles, in the one of which the Heracles worshipped is known by the name of Olympian, and has sacrifice offered to him as an immortal, while in the other the honours paid are such as are due to a hero.

Josephus records (&quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; 8.5.3), following Menander of Ephesus the historian, concerning King Hiram I of Tyre (c. 965–935 BCE):
He also went and cut down materials of timber out of the mountain called Lebanon, for the roof of temples; and when he had pulled down the ancient temples, he both built the temple of Heracles and that of `Ashtart; and he was the first to celebrate the awakening (&quot;egersis&quot;) of Heracles in the month Peritius.

The annual celebration of the revival of Melqart&#x27;s &quot;awakening&quot; may identify Melqart as a life-death-rebirth deity.

Melqart played the central role in the Phoenician spring festival during which he died and was resurrected.

The Roman Emperor Septimius Severus was a native of Lepcis Magna in Africa, an originally Phoenician city where worship of Melqart was widespread. He is known to have constructed in Rome a temple dedicated to &quot;Liber and Hercules&quot;, and it is assumed that the Emperor, seeking to honour the god of his native city, identified Melqart with the Roman god Liber.

==Archaeological evidence==

The first occurrence of the name is in the 9th-century BCE the &quot;Ben-Hadad&quot; inscription found in 1939 north of Aleppo in today&#x27;s northern Syria; it had been erected by the son of the king of Aram &quot;for his lord Melqart, which he vowed to him and he heard his voice&quot;.

Archaeological evidence for Melqart&#x27;s cult is found earliest in Tyre and seems to have spread westward with the Phoenician colonies established by Tyre as well as eventually overshadowing the worship of Eshmun in Sidon. The name of Melqart was invoked in oaths sanctioning contracts, according to Dr. María Eugenia Aubet, thus it was customary to build a temple to Melqart, as protector of Tyrian traders, in each new Phoenician colony: at Cádiz, the temple to Melqart is as early as the earliest vestiges of Phoenician occupation. (The Greeks followed a parallel practice in respect to Heracles.) Carthage even sent a yearly tribute of 10% of the public treasury to the god in Tyre up until the Hellenistic period.

In Tyre, the high priest of Melqart ranked second only to the king. Many names in Carthage reflected this importance of Melqart, for example, the names Hamilcar and Bomilcar; but &quot;Ba‘l&quot; &quot;Lord&quot; as a name-element in Carthaginian names such as Hasdrubal and Hannibal almost certainly does not refer to Melqart but instead refers to Ba`al Hammon, chief god of Carthage, a god identified by Greeks with Cronus and by Romans with Saturn, or is simply used as a title.

Melqart protected the Punic areas of Sicily, such as Cefalù, which was known under Carthaginian rule as &quot;Cape Melqart&quot; (, ). Melqart&#x27;s head, indistinguishable from a Heracles, appeared on its coins of the 4th century BCE.

The Cippi of Melqart, found on Malta and dedicated to the god as an ex voto offering, provided the key to understanding the Phoenician language, as the inscriptions on the cippi were written in both Phoenician and Greek.

===Temple sites===
Temples to Melqart are found at at least three Phoenician/Punic sites in Spain: Cádiz, Ibiza in the Balearic Islands and Cartagena. Near Gades/Gádeira (modern Cádiz) was the westernmost temple of Tyrian Heracles, near the eastern shore of the island (Strabo 3.5.2–3). Strabo notes (3.5.5–6) that the two bronze pillars within the temple, each 8 cubits high, were widely proclaimed to be the true Pillars of Heracles by many who had visited the place and had sacrificed to Heracles there. Strabo believes the account to be fraudulent, in part noting that the inscriptions on those pillars mentioned nothing about Heracles, speaking only of the expenses incurred by the Phoenicians in their making.

Another temple to Melqart was at Ebyssus (Ibiza), in one of four Phoenician sites on the island&#x27;s south coast. In 2004 a highway crew in the Avinguda Espanya, (one of the main routes into Ibiza), uncovered a further Punic temple in the excavated roadbed. Texts found mention Melqart among other Punic gods Eshmun, Astarte and Baʻl.

Another Iberian temple to Melqart has been identified at Carthago Nova (Cartagena). The Tyrian god&#x27;s protection extended to the sacred promontory (Cape Saint Vincent) of the Iberian peninsula, the westernmost point of the known world, ground so sacred it was forbidden even to spend the night.

Another temple to Melqart was at Lixus, on the Atlantic coast of Morocco.

==Hannibal and Melqart==
Hannibal was a faithful worshiper of Melqart: the Roman historian Livy records the story that just before setting off on his march to Italy he made a pilgrimage to Gades, the most ancient seat of Phoenician worship in the west. Hannibal strengthened himself spiritually by prayer and sacrifice at the Altar of Melqart. He returned to New Carthage with his mind focused on the god and on the eve of departure to Italy he saw a strange vision which he believed was sent by Melqart.

A youth of divine beauty appeared to Hannibal in the night. The youth told Hannibal he had been sent by the supreme deity, Jupiter, to guide the son of Hamilcar to Italy. “Follow me,” said the ghostly visitor, “and see that that thou look not behind thee.” Hannibal followed the instructions of the visitor. His curiosity, however, overcame him, and as he turned his head, Hannibal saw a serpent crashing through forest and thicket causing destruction everywhere. It moved as a black tempest with claps of thunder and flashes of lightning gathered behind the serpent. When Hannibal asked the meaning of the vision the being replied, “What thou beholdest is the desolation of Italy. Follow thy star and inquire no farther into the dark counsels of heaven.”

==Graeco-Roman traditions==

It was suggested by some writers that the Phoenician Melicertes son of Ino found in Greek mythology was in origin a reflection of Melqart. Though no classical source explicitly connects the two, Ino is the daughter of Cadmus of Tyre. Lewis Farnell thought not, referring in 1916 to &quot;the accidental resemblance in sound of Melikertes and Melqart, seeing that Melqart, the bearded god, had no affinity in form or myth with the child- or boy-deity, and was moreover always identified with Herakles: nor do we know anything about Melqart that would explain the figure of Ino that is aboriginally inseparable from Melikertes.&quot;

Athenaeus (392d) summarizes a story by Eudoxus of Cnidus (c. 355 BCE) telling how Heracles the son of Zeus by Asteria (= ‘Ashtart ?) was killed by Typhon in Libya. Heracles&#x27; companion Iolaus brought a quail to the dead god (presumably a roasted quail) and its delicious scent roused Heracles back to life. This purports to explain why the Phoenicians sacrifice quails to Heracles. It seems that Melqart had a companion similar to the Hellenic Iolaus, who was himself a native of the Tyrian colony of Thebes. Sanchuniathon also makes Melqart under the name Malcarthos or Melcathros, the son of Hadad, who is normally identified with Zeus.

The &quot;Pseudo-Clementine Recognitions&quot; (10.24) speaks of the tombs of various gods, including &quot;that of Heracles at Tyre, where he was burnt with fire.&quot; The Hellenic Heracles also died on a pyre, but the event was located on Mount Oeta in Trachis. A similar tradition is recorded by Dio Chrysostom (&quot;Or.&quot; 33.47) who mentions the beautiful pyre which the Tarsians used to build for their Heracles, referring here to the Cilician god Sandon.

In Nonnus&#x27; &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; (40.366–580) the Tyrian Heracles is very much a Sun-god. However, there is a tendency in the later Hellenistic and Roman periods for almost all gods to develop solar attributes, and for almost all eastern gods to be identified with the Sun. Nonnus gives the title &quot;Astrochiton&quot; &#x27;Starclad&#x27; to Tyrian Heracles and has his Dionysus recite a hymn to this Heracles, saluting him as &quot;the son of Time, he who causes the threefold image of the Moon, the all-shining Eye of the heavens&quot;. Rain is ascribed to the shaking from his head of the waters of his bath in the eastern Ocean. His Sun-disk is praised as the cause of growth in plants. Then, in a climactic burst of syncretism, Dionysus identifies the Tyrian Heracles with Belus on the Euphrates, Ammon in Libya, Apis by the Nile, Arabian Cronus, Assyrian Zeus, Serapis, Zeus of Egypt, Cronus, Phaethon, Mithras, Delphic Apollo, &quot;Gamos&quot; &#x27;Marriage&#x27;, and &quot;Paeon&quot; &#x27;Healer&#x27;.

The Tyrian Heracles answers by appearing to Dionysus. There is red light in the fiery eyes of this shining god who clothed in a robe embroidered like the sky (presumably with various constellations). He has yellow, sparkling cheeks and a starry beard. The god reveals how he taught the primeval, earthborn inhabitants of Phoenicia how to build the first boat and instructed them to sail out to a pair of floating, rocky islands. On one of the islands there grew an olive tree with a serpent at its foot, an eagle at its summit, and which glowed in the middle with fire that burned but did not consume. Following the god&#x27;s instructions, these primeval humans sacrificed the eagle to Poseidon, Zeus, and the other gods. Thereupon the islands rooted themselves to the bottom of the sea. On these islands the city of Tyre was founded.

Gregory of Nazianzus and Cassiodorus relate how Tyrian Heracles and the nymph Tyrus were walking along the beach when Heracles&#x27; dog, who was accompanying them, devoured a murex snail and gained a beautiful purple color around its mouth. Tyrus told Heracles she would never accept him as her lover until he gave her a robe of that same colour. So Heracles gathered many murex shells, extracted the dye from them, and dyed the first garment of the colour later called Tyrian purple. The murex shell appears on the very earliest Tyrian coins and then reappears again on coins in Imperial Roman times.

From the sixth century BCE. onward in Cyprus, where there was strong Phoenician cultural influence on the western side of the island, Melqart was often depicted with Heracles&#x27; traditional symbols of a lion skin and club, although it is unclear how strongly this connection between the figures was throughout the rest of Phoenician culture.

==Attempts at a synthesis==

The paucity of evidence on Melqart has led to debate as to the nature of his cult and his place in the Phoenician pantheon. William F. Albright suggested he was a god of the underworld partly because the god Milku, who may be Melqart, is sometimes equated with the Mesopotamian god Nergal, a god of the underworld, whose name also means &#x27;King of the City&#x27;. Others take this to be coincidental, since what is known about Melqart from other sources does not suggest an underworld god, and the city in question could conceivably be Tyre. It has been suggested that Melqart began as a sea god who was later given solar attributes, or alternatively that he began as a solar god who later received the attributes of a sea god.

== Historical person ==
Herodotus said that the Temple of Melqart at Tyre had a tomb in its sanctuary, supporting the theory that involved as he was in the founding mythology of Tyre, perhaps Melqart was based on a real historical person. Other classical authors say that this supposed Tomb of Melqart was moved to southern Spain, possibly Cádiz.

In late 2021, archeologists from Seville University claimed to have located the historical Temple of Melqart of Spain, which classical authors believed to have contained the supposed Tomb of Melqart, at modern-day Sancti Petri, Cádiz.

<text>Armstrong County is a county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As of the 2020 census, the population was 65,558. The county seat is Kittanning. The county was organized on March 12, 1800, from parts of Allegheny, Westmoreland and Lycoming Counties. It was named in honor of John Armstrong, who represented Pennsylvania in the Continental Congress and served as a major general during the Revolutionary War. The county is part of the Greater Pittsburgh region of the state.

==History==
===Pre-settlement===

Little is known of the pre-Columbian history of the area that is today called Armstrong County, but the often cited starting point begins with the civilization known colloquially as the Mound Builders. 

Several 19th-20th century farmers throughout the county have unearthed artifacts from this time period, such as arrowheads. Several of the prominent earthen works characteristic of this culture have been removed for agricultural and settlement purposes. One prominent mound was located between present-day Kittanning and Ford City and was believed to have been an earthen fortification used to defend against other tribal peoples. Other mounds were found in Boggs, South Buffalo, and Washington townships. The aboriginal inhabitants were given the name &quot;Allegewi&quot; by the tribes that drove them out sometime between the 15th and 17th centuries.

Historical accounts describe the tribes that conquered the Allegewi as primarily the Lenape or &quot;Delaware&quot; tribes, along with bands of Mohawk, Oneidas, Cayugas, Onondagas, and Seneca tribes. The Lenape tribe made semi-permanent and permanent settlements in and around present-day Kittanning, and much of the area functioned as their hunting and agricultural lands. Blockhouses built by the Lenape, not unlike the early European settler dwellings, were commonly seen around Ford City, Kittanning, South Buffalo, Brady&#x27;s Bend, and Red Bank. The Lenape were the primary inhabitants of the area and were the primary points of contact for European settlers in this area at the turn of the 18th century.

===18th century===
With the arrival of European settlers also came the competing claims to the territory, primarily between the French and British empires, who were engaged in what became known as the Seven Years&#x27; War. As the global conflict between the two empires expanded into the &quot;New World,&quot; both sides attempted to court the many Native American tribes. Several tribes in the Allegheny River Valley, including the Lenni-Lenape, sided with the French during this time period, as their friendship appeared to be more advantageous to their own territorial claims against the British-friendly Iroquois Nations. 

In exchange for furs, freedom of movement in Lenape territory, and guerilla raids on British troops and settlers, the French supplied weapons and other European goods and offered military protection to the friendly tribes. This agreement and similar alliances with other tribes allowed the French to become more well dug-in along the Allegheny River, most prominently at Fort Duquesne in present-day Pittsburgh. Several military engagements in the Ohio Country, which would later become Western Pennsylvania, were part of the French and Indian War.

One of the minor battles that erupted during the French and Indian War occurred at the present site of the Armstrong County seat, Kittanning, or Kit-hane-ink, as it was referred to by the Lenape, meaning &quot;settlement by the main river.&quot; Although the Battle of Kittanning was inconsequential to the greater conflict with the French and Indian tribes, it is an integral part of Armstrong County&#x27;s history. The expedition, led by Lieutenant Colonel John Armstrong, brought about the destruction of the Lenape village of Kittanning, which had served as a staging point for attacks by Lenape (Delaware) warriors against colonists in the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania. Deep into hostile territory, the raid on Kittanning was the only major expedition carried out by Pennsylvania Provincial troops during the brutal backcountry war. It is often thought of by local historians as a type of pre-World War II Doolittle Raid.

With the surrender of George Washington at Fort Necessity in 1754 and Braddock&#x27;s defeat in 1755, the settlers on the Pennsylvania frontier were without professional military protection, and scrambled to organize a defense. The French-allied Indians who had defeated General Edward Braddock at the Monongahela River were primarily from the Great Lakes region to the north. The local Indians, mostly Lenape and Shawnee who had migrated to the area after European colonists had settled their lands to the east, had waited to see who would win the contest—they could not risk siding with the loser. With Fort Duquesne now secured, the victorious French encouraged the Lenape and Shawnee to &quot;take up the hatchet&quot; against those who had taken their land.

Beginning about October 1755, Lenape and Shawnee war parties, often with French cooperation, began raiding settlements in Pennsylvania. Although European-Americans also waged war with cruelty, they found Indian warfare particularly brutal and frightening. Notable among the Indian raiders were the Lenape war leaders Shingas and Captain Jacobs, both of whom lived at Kittanning. The colonial governments of Pennsylvania and Virginia offered rewards for their scalps. Captain Jacobs was on an expedition led by Louis Coulon de Villiers that descended on Fort Granville (near present-day Lewistown) on the morning of August 2, 1756. The attackers were held off, but the garrison commander was killed, and his second in command surrendered the garrison, including the women and children, the next morning. The commander&#x27;s brother, Lieutenant Colonel John Armstrong, immediately organized an expedition of 300 men against Kittanning in response. Early on September 8, 1756, they launched a surprise attack on the Indian village. Many of the Kittanning residents fled, but Captain Jacobs put up a defense, holing up with his wife and family inside their home. When he refused to surrender, his house and others were set on fire, touching off gunpowder that had been stored inside. Captain Jacobs was killed and scalped after jumping from his home in an attempt to escape the flames. The battle ended when the entire village was engulfed in flames.

The destruction of Kittanning was hailed as a victory in Pennsylvania, and Armstrong was known afterwards as the &quot;Hero of Kittanning&quot;. He and his men collected the &quot;scalp bounty&quot; that had been placed on Captain Jacobs. However, the victory had limitations: the attackers suffered more casualties than they inflicted, and most of the villagers escaped, taking with them almost all of the prisoners that had been held in the village. The expedition also probably aggravated the frontier war; subsequent Indian raids that autumn were fiercer than ever. The Kittanning raid revealed to the village&#x27;s inhabitants their vulnerability, and many moved to more secure areas. A peace faction led by Shingas&#x27;s brother Tamaqua soon came to the forefront. Tamaqua eventually made peace with Pennsylvania in the Treaty of Easton, which enabled the British under General John Forbes to successfully mount an expedition in 1758 that drove the French from Fort Duquesne. Reenactments of the Battle of Kittanning have become a favorite pastime of the local inhabitants of present-day Armstrong County.

John Armstrong later served as a brigadier general in the Continental Army and as a major general in the Pennsylvania Militia during the Revolutionary War. He was also a delegate to the Continental Congress for Pennsylvania. Armstrong County, formed on March 12, 1800, from parts of Allegheny, Westmoreland and Lycoming Counties was named in the general&#x27;s honor.

===19th century===
In the early 1800s, most people in Armstrong County were &quot;old stock Americans&quot; of Scotch-Irish and English ancestry, whose ancestors had settled in the area prior to the American Revolution. In the decades following the American Civil War, and in particular between 1890 and 1910, immigrants arrived in large numbers from Germany, Italy, Ireland, and Poland.

As the county seat, Kittanning became the governmental, financial, and commercial hub for the county. 

In the 1890s, Water Street (sometimes called &quot;Millionaire Row&quot;) in Kittanning boasted more millionaire residents than anywhere else in Pennsylvania. Booming industries in the county such as coal, natural gas, plate glass, brick, ceramics, and iron created a strong local economy. Gradual population decline, via economic downturns, began in the 1970s and 1980s, and while there are still many coal mines and natural gas wells in operation throughout the county, the decline of the fossil fuel industry has severely limited the economy of Kittanning . Recently, revitalization efforts have led to a beautification of Market Street in Kittanning in an effort to attract new businesses and people.

Three miles downriver from Kittanning is Ford City. Incorporated in 1887, Ford City was a company town for John Baptiste Ford&#x27;s renowned plate-glass industry, known now as Pittsburgh Plate Glass PPG Industries, a Fortune 500 Company. Eljer also operated a production facility along the river in Ford City that made ceramic toilets. The two companies employed nearly 10,000 people at the height of Armstrong County&#x27;s economy. 

In 1869, Leechburg was the first place in the United States to use natural gas for metallurgical purposes. Natural gas was found while drilling for oil, and eventually introduced into the boilers and furnaces of Siberian Iron Works.

Freeport, Leechburg, and Apollo were communities built along the Pennsylvania Canal, which passed through on the Allegheny and Kiskiminetas rivers, at the southern border of the county.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, Ford City struggled economically, but kept its economy and heritage alive through creative businesses and lively festivals. 

===21st century===
Ford City is the future site of the Armstrong campus of Butler County Community College (BC3) - consistently ranked among the best community colleges in Pennsylvania.

Armstrong County is home to the City of Parker, an incorporated third-class city, which was an oil boom town with a population rumored to be approximately 20,000 in 1873, but now is the &quot;Smallest City in America&quot; with a population of just under 800. Parker is located in the extreme northwest portion of the county.

Iron was made in the Brady&#x27;s Bend area of the county twenty years before there was a foundry in Pittsburgh doing so.

Elderton, whose name is derived from the famous resident of the area, Sara Elder, is a small community, home to the former Elderton Jr/Sr High School.

Worthington is the county&#x27;s primary agricultural hub and lies just west of Kittanning along Pennsylvania Route 422.

<text>Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. ( ; born October 20, 1971), better known by his stage name Snoop Dogg (previously Snoop Doggy Dogg), is an American rapper, record producer, and actor. Rooted in West Coast hip-hop, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time. Known for his signature drawled lyrics—which often use melodic rhyming, repetition, word play, laconic phrases, syncopation—and alliteration, his music often addresses the lifestyle and culture of the West Coast and social issues such as gun violence and
stability for the youth. His initial fame dates back to 1992 following his guest appearance on Dr. Dre&#x27;s debut solo single, &quot;Deep Cover&quot;, and later on Dre&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Chronic&quot; that same year. Snoop Dogg has since sold over 23 million albums in the United States, and 35 million albums worldwide. His accolades include an American Music Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and 17 Grammy Award nominations.

Produced entirely by Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Doggystyle&quot; (1993) was released by Death Row Records and debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Selling 806,000 copies in its first week, the album received quadruple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) the following year and spawned the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-top ten singles &quot;What&#x27;s My Name?&quot; and &quot;Gin and Juice&quot;. He was the lead performer on Death Row&#x27;s soundtrack album for the 1994 short film &quot;Murder Was the Case&quot;, wherein Snoop Dogg made his acting debut. He has since appeared in other films and popular media. His second album, &quot;Tha Doggfather&quot; (1996), debuted atop the chart and received double platinum certification.

In 1998, he parted ways with Death Row in favor of Master P&#x27;s No Limit Records, through which he saw largely continued success with his albums &quot;Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told&quot; (1998), &quot;No Limit Top Dogg&quot; (1999), and &quot;Tha Last Meal&quot; (2000). He then signed with Priority, Capitol, and EMI Records to release his sixth album &quot;Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss&quot; (2002), which was further commercially oriented. This effectively continued upon him signing with Geffen Records to release his next three albums: &quot;R&amp;G (Rhythm &amp; Gangsta): The Masterpiece&quot; (2004), &quot;Tha Blue Carpet Treatment&quot; (2006), and &quot;Ego Trippin&#x27;&quot; (2008); the former spawned the single &quot;Drop It Like It&#x27;s Hot&quot; (featuring Pharrell), which became his first to peak atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. He then returned to Priority and Capitol—upon his hiring as chairman of the former label—to release his tenth and eleventh albums, &quot;Malice &#x27;n Wonderland&quot; (2009) and &quot;Doggumentary&quot; (2011), both of which saw mild critical and commercial response.

In 2012, following a trip to Jamaica, Snoop Dogg converted to Rastafari and adopted the alias Snoop Lion, under which he released a reggae album, &quot;Reincarnated&quot; (2013), and a namesake documentary film about his Jamaican experience. His thirteenth studio album, &quot;Bush&quot; (2015), was produced entirely by frequent collaborator Pharrell. His fourteenth studio album, &quot;Coolaid&quot; was released in 2016. In 2018, Snoop Dogg became &quot;a born-again Christian&quot; and released his first gospel album, &quot;Bible of Love&quot; in March of that year. Also that year, Snoop Dogg was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2022, he acquired Death Row Records from MNRK Music Group (formerly known as eOne Music), and released his nineteenth studio album, &quot;BODR&quot; (2022)—preceded by the independently-released &quot;I Wanna Thank Me&quot; (2019) and &quot;From tha Streets 2 tha Suites&quot; (2021). On December 13, 2024, he released his twentieth studio album, &quot;Missionary&quot;. It became his highest-charting album since 2015, peaking within the top-twenty of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Early life==
Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. was born on October 20, 1971, in Long Beach, California, to Beverly Tate (1951–2021) and Vernell Varnado. Varnado, who was a Vietnam War veteran, singer, and mail carrier, left the family only three months after Snoop Dogg&#x27;s birth, and thus he was named after his stepfather, Calvin Cordozar Broadus Sr. (1948–1984). His biological father remained largely absent from his life. As a boy, his mother nicknamed him &quot;Snoopy&quot; due to his love for and likeness to the cartoon character from &quot;Peanuts&quot;. He was the second of his mother&#x27;s three sons. His mother and stepfather divorced in 1975.

Snoop Dogg was raised Baptist and began singing and playing piano at Golgotha Trinity Baptist Church when he was very young. His mother, a member of the church choir, was one of his &quot;prime musical influences&quot; growing up and introduced him to old-school R&amp;B music. In his youth, Snoop Dogg sold candy, delivered newspapers, and bagged groceries. Snoop Dogg was described as having been a dedicated student and enthusiastic churchgoer, active in choir and football.

In sixth grade, Snoop Dogg began rapping. He would frequently rap in school, as he recalled: &quot;When I rapped in the hallways at school I would draw such a big crowd that the principal would think there was a fight going on. It made me begin to realize that I had a gift. I could tell that my raps interested people and that made me interested in myself&quot;.

In his teenage years, Snoop Dogg began engaging in unlawful activities and joining gangs, despite his mother&#x27;s preventive efforts. He was a member of the Rollin&#x27; 20s Crips gang in the Eastside neighborhood of Long Beach; in 1993, however, he denied the frequent police and media reports by saying that he never joined a gang. Shortly after graduating from Long Beach Polytechnic High School in 1989, he was arrested for possession of cocaine, and for the next three years was frequently incarcerated, including at Wayside Jail. With his two cousins, Nate Dogg and Lil&#x27; ½ Dead, and friend Warren G, he recorded homemade tapes, with one titled &quot;Over the Counter&quot; attracting some label interest. The four called their group 213 after the area code of their native Long Beach at that time. One of Snoop&#x27;s early solo freestyles over &quot;Hold On&quot; by En Vogue was on a mixtape that fortuitously wound up with Dr. Dre; the influential producer was so impressed by the sample that he called Snoop Dogg to audition in 1991 for his label Death Row Records (then known as Future Shock). Former N.W.A affiliate, American rapper Tracy Lynn Curry, better known as The D.O.C., taught him to structure his lyrics and separate the themes into verses, hooks, and choruses.

==Music career==
===1991–1997: Death Row, &quot;Doggystyle,&quot; and &quot;Tha Doggfather&quot;===
When he began recording, the young rapper took the stage name Snoop Doggy Dogg. He was introduced to Dr. Dre by Warren G, who gave him Snoop Dogg&#x27;s cassette tape. Snoop Dogg then signed with Dre&#x27;s label, Future Shock Records (which later became known as Death Row Records). Dr. Dre began working with him, first on the theme song of the 1992 film &quot;Deep Cover&quot;, and then on Dr. Dre&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;The Chronic&quot;, along with the other members of his former starting group, Tha Dogg Pound. This intense exposure played a considerable part in making Snoop Dogg&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Doggystyle,&quot; the critical and commercial success that it was.
Fueling the ascendance of West Coast G-funk hip hop, the singles &quot;Who Am I (What&#x27;s My Name)?&quot; and &quot;Gin and Juice&quot; reached the top ten most-played songs in the United States, and the album stayed on the Billboard charts for several months. Gangsta rap became the center of arguments about censorship and labeling, with Snoop Dogg often used as an example of violent and misogynistic musicians. Unlike many of the harder-edged gangsta rap artists, Snoop Dogg seemed to show his softer side, according to music journalist Chuck Philips. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; music critic Touré asserted that Snoop Dogg had a relatively soft vocal delivery compared to other rappers: &quot;Snoop&#x27;s vocal style is part of what distinguishes him: where many rappers scream, figuratively and literally, he speaks softly&quot;. &quot;Doggystyle,&quot; much like &quot;The Chronic,&quot; featured a host of rappers signed to or affiliated with the Death Row label including Daz Dillinger, Kurupt, Nate Dogg, and others.

In 1993, Snoop Dogg was charged with first-degree murder for the shooting of a member of a rival gang, who was actually killed by Snoop Dogg&#x27;s bodyguard. Snoop Dogg was acquitted on February 20, 1996, and the case was finally closed in 2024. According to Snoop Dogg, after he was acquitted he did not want to continue living the &quot;gangsta&quot; lifestyle, because he felt that continuing his behavior would result in his assassination or a prison term. A short film about Snoop Dogg&#x27;s murder trial, &quot;Murder Was the Case,&quot; was released in 1994, along with an accompanying soundtrack. On July 6, 1995, Doggy Style Records, Inc., a record label founded by Snoop Dogg, was registered with the California Secretary of State as business entity number C1923139.

After his acquittal, Snoop Dogg and the mother of his son, along with their kennel of 20 pit bulls, moved into a home in the hills of Claremont, California and by August 1996 Doggy Style Records, a subsidiary of Death Row Records, signed the Gap Band&#x27;s Charlie Wilson as one of its first artists. He collaborated with fellow rap artist Tupac Shakur on the 1996 single &quot;2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted&quot;. This was one of Shakur&#x27;s last songs released while alive; he was shot on September 7, 1996, in Las Vegas, dying six days later.

By the time Snoop Dogg&#x27;s second album, &quot;Tha Doggfather,&quot; was released in November 1996, the price of appearing to be a gang member &quot;&quot;living the gangsta&quot; &quot;life&quot;&quot; had become very evident. Among the many notable hip hop industry deaths and convictions were the death of Snoop Dogg&#x27;s friend and labelmate Tupac Shakur and the racketeering indictment of Death Row co-founder Suge Knight. Dr. Dre had left Death Row earlier in 1996 because of a contract dispute, so Snoop Dogg co-produced &quot;Tha Doggfather&quot; with Daz Dillinger and DJ Pooh.

This album featured a distinct change of style from &quot;Doggystyle,&quot; and the leadoff single, &quot;Snoop&#x27;s Upside Ya Head&quot;, featured a collaboration with Charlie Wilson. The album sold reasonably well but was not as successful as its predecessor. &quot;Tha Doggfather&quot; had a somewhat softer approach to the G-funk style. Snoop Dogg was scheduled to release an EP titled &quot;Doggumentary&quot; on July 8, 1997, but the album had been canceled. Despite this, a music video was released for its projected first single, &quot;Midnight Love&quot;. Snoop Dogg realized that he was subject to an ironclad time-based contract (i.e., that Death Row practically owned anything he produced for a number of years), and refused to produce anymore tracks for Suge Knight other than the insulting &quot;Fuck Death Row&quot; until his contract expired. In an interview with Neil Strauss in 1998, Snoop Dogg said that though he had been given lavish gifts by his former label, they had withheld his royalty payments.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that after &quot;Tha Doggfather,&quot; Snoop Dogg began &quot;moving away from his gangsta roots toward a calmer lyrical aesthetic&quot;: for instance, Snoop Dogg participated in the 1997 Lollapalooza concert tour, which featured mainly alternative rock music. Troy J. Augusto of &quot;Variety&quot; noted that Snoop&#x27;s set at Lollapalooza attracted &quot;much dancing, and, strangely, even a small mosh pit&quot; in the audience.

===1998–2006: Signing with No Limit and continued success===
Snoop Dogg signed with Master P&#x27;s No Limit Records (distributed by Priority/EMI Records) in March 1998 and debuted on the label with &quot;Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told&quot; later that year. He said at the time that &quot;Snoop Dogg is universal so he can fit into any camp-especially a camp that knows how to handmake shit[;] [a]nd, No Limit hand makes material. They make material fittin&#x27; to the artist and they know what type of shit Snoop Dogg is supposed to be on. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so tight&quot;. His other albums on No Limit were &quot;No Limit Top Dogg&quot; in 1999 (selling over 1,510,000 copies) and &quot;Tha Last Meal&quot; in 2000 (selling over 2,100,000). In 1999, his autobiography, &quot;Tha Doggfather,&quot; was published.

In 2002, he released the album &quot;Paid tha Cost to Be da Bo$$,&quot; on Priority/Capitol/EMI, selling over 1,310,000 copies. The album featured the hit singles &quot;From tha Chuuuch to da Palace&quot; and &quot;Beautiful&quot;, featuring guest vocals by Pharrell. In the same year, he featured in the remix of &quot;Welcome to Atlanta&quot; by Jermaine Dupri. By this stage in his career, Snoop Dogg had left behind his &quot;gangster&quot; image and embraced a &quot;pimp&quot; image.

In June 2004, Snoop Dogg signed to Geffen Records/Star Trak Entertainment, both distributed by Interscope Records; Star Trak is headed by producer duo the Neptunes, which produced several tracks for Snoop&#x27;s 2004 release &quot;R&amp;G (Rhythm &amp; Gangsta): The Masterpiece&quot;. &quot;Drop It Like It&#x27;s Hot&quot; (featuring Pharrell), the first single released from the album, was a hit and became Snoop Dogg&#x27;s first single to reach number one. His third release was &quot;Signs&quot;, featuring Justin Timberlake and Charlie Wilson, which entered the UK chart at No. 2. This was his highest entry ever in the UK chart. The album sold 1,730,000 copies in the U.S. alone, and most of its singles were heavily played on radio and television. Snoop Dogg joined Warren G and Nate Dogg to form the group 213 and released &quot;The Hard Way&quot; in 2004. Debuting at No.4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No.1 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, it included the single &quot;Groupie Luv&quot;. Snoop Dogg appeared in the music video for Korn&#x27;s &quot;Twisted Transistor&quot; along with fellow rappers Lil Jon, Xzibit, and David Banner.

Snoop Dogg appeared on two tracks from Ice Cube&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Laugh Now, Cry Later,&quot; including &quot;Go to Church&quot;, and on several tracks on Tha Dogg Pound&#x27;s &quot;Cali Iz Active&quot; the same year. His song &quot;Real Talk&quot; was leaked on the Internet in the summer of 2006 and a video was later released on the Internet. &quot;Real Talk&quot; was dedicated to former Crips leader Stanley &quot;Tookie&quot; Williams and a diss to Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor of California. Two other singles on which Snoop Dogg made a guest performance were &quot;Keep Bouncing&quot; by Too $hort (also with will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas) and &quot;Gangsta Walk&quot; by Coolio.

Snoop&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Tha Blue Carpet Treatment&quot; debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No.5 and sold over 850,000 copies. The album and the second single &quot;That&#x27;s That Shit&quot; featuring R. Kelly were well received by critics. In the album, he collaborated in a video with E-40 and other West Coast rappers on the single &quot;Candy (Drippin&#x27; Like Water)&quot;.

===2007–2012: &quot;Ego Trippin&#x27;,&quot; &quot;Malice n Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Doggumentary&quot;===
In July 2007, Snoop Dogg made history by becoming the first artist to release a track as a ringtone before its release as a single, &quot;It&#x27;s the D.O.G&quot;. On July 7, 2007, Snoop Dogg performed at the Live Earth concert, Hamburg. Snoop Dogg ventured into singing for Bollywood with his first ever rap for an Indian movie, &quot;Singh Is Kinng&quot;; the song title is also &quot;Singh is Kinng&quot;. He appears in the movie as himself. The album featuring the song was released on June 8, 2008, on Junglee Music Records. He released his ninth studio album, &quot;Ego Trippin&#x27;&quot; (selling 400,000 copies in the U.S.), along with the first single, &quot;Sexual Eruption&quot;. The single peaked at No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 100, featuring Snoop Dogg using autotune. The album featured production from QDT (Quik-Dogg-Teddy).

Kool Moe Dee ranks Snoop Dogg at No. 33 in his book &quot;There&#x27;s a God on the Mic,&quot; and says he has &quot;an ultra-smooth, laidback delivery&quot; and &quot;flavor-filled melodic rhyming&quot;.

Snoop Dogg is known to freestyle some of his lyrics on the spot – in the book &quot;How to Rap,&quot; Lady of Rage says, &quot;When I worked with him earlier in his career, that&#x27;s how created his stuff… he would freestyle, he wasn&#x27;t a writer then, he was a freestyler&quot;, and the D.O.C. states, &quot;Snoop&#x27;s [rap] was a one take willy, but his shit was all freestyle. He hadn&#x27;t written nothing down. He just came in and started busting. The song was &#x27;Tha Shiznit&#x27;—that was all freestyle. He started busting and when we got to the break, Dre cut the machine off, did the chorus and told Snoop to come back in. He did that throughout the record. That&#x27;s when Snoop was in the zone then.&quot;

Peter Shapiro says that Snoop Dogg debuted on &quot;Deep Cover&quot; with a &quot;shockingly original flow – which sounded like a Slick Rick born in South Carolina instead of South London&quot; and adds that he &quot;showed where his style came from by covering Slick Rick&#x27;s &#x27;La Di Da Di&#x27;&quot;.

On May 21, 2004, he filed for divorce from Taylor, citing irreconcilable differences. However, the couple renewed vows on January 12, 2008.

===Religion===
Snoop Dogg was raised as a Baptist. He said his faith provided guidance, and he took it along with him everywhere he went in life. In his 1999 autobiography, he wrote, &quot;These days I look to God to get me through each day, to guide me on my path and to help others along their way. He&#x27;s taken me this far; I&#x27;ve got no reason to believe He won&#x27;t be with me for the rest of the ride&quot;.

In 2009, it was reported that Snoop Dogg was a member of the Nation of Islam. On March 1, he made an appearance at the Nation of Islam&#x27;s annual Saviours&#x27; Day holiday, where he praised minister Louis Farrakhan.

Although Snoop Dogg has donated and raised millions of dollars for charitable causes over the years, it is difficult to ascertain the full extent of Snoop&#x27;s charitable giving, as he is wary that his donations and charitable causes might be seen as publicity stunts for his own image. For example, regarding Snoop Special Stars, he said on LL Cool J&#x27;s &quot;Rock the Bells Radio&quot; that he avoided being in videos and photos at first—due to this apprehension—but he acquiesced once he saw the joy the kids and parents were getting by taking photos together. Some other known causes that he supports include Children&#x27;s Hospital Los Angeles, Mothers Against Police Brutality, Habitat for Humanity, Orca Network, Save a Life Foundation, Shriners Hospitals for Children, and The Healing Circle.

In his keynote address at the 2015 South by Southwest music festival, he blamed Los Angeles&#x27;s explosion of gang violence in the 1980s on the economic policies of Ronald Reagan, and insinuated that his administration shipped guns and drugs into the area.

He endorsed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;Watch What Happens Live&quot; in May 2015, saying: &quot;I would love to see a woman in office because I feel like we&#x27;re at that stage in life to where we need a perspective other than the male&#x27;s train of thought&quot; and &quot;[…] just to have a woman speaking from a global perspective as far as representing America, I&#x27;d love to see that. So I&#x27;ll be voting for Mrs. Clinton&quot;.

Following the deadly shooting of five police officers in Dallas on July 7, 2016, Snoop Dogg and fellow rapper the Game organized and led a peaceful march to the Los Angeles Police Department headquarters. The subsequent private meeting with the mayor Eric Garcetti and police chief Charlie Beck, and news conference was, according to Snoop Dogg, &quot;[…] to get some dialogue and the communication going […]&quot;. The march and conference were part of an initiative called &quot;Operation &quot;, serving as a police brutality protest in response to the police shooting and killing of two black men, Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, whose killing prompted nationwide protests including those that led to the Dallas killing of police officers. Snoop Dogg stated that &quot;We are tired of what is going on and it&#x27;s communication that is lacking&quot;. Reports of attendance range between 50 and 100 people.

Snoop Dogg advocates for the defunding of police departments, saying: &quot;We need to start taking that money out of their pocket and put it back into our communities where we can police ourselves&quot;.

This world that we live in, it&#x27;s so easy to get your hands on a gun. You&#x27;ve got to put some restrictions or ramifications on it. I can go outside right now and buy a gun. Easy. Just like that&quot;. Additionally, he released a song called &quot;No Guns Allowed&quot; feat. Drake and Cori B in 2013.

In 2020, Snoop Dogg endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden for President of the United States. In contrast, in 2024, he said that he had &quot;nothing but love and respect for Donald Trump&quot;.

He has been certified for medical cannabis in California to treat migraines since at least 2007. In 2023, he announced via social media that he was &quot;giving up smoke&quot; after much consideration, but later revealed that it was an ad to promote a smokeless fire pit called SoloStove.

===Animal rights===
Snoop Dogg regularly appears in real fur garments, especially large coats, for which he attracts criticism from animal welfare charities and younger audiences. In a video podcast in 2012, the rapper asked, &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t PETA throw paint on a pimp&#x27;s fur coat&quot;. In 2014, Snoop Dogg claimed to have become a vegan; however, he has since opted against a complete vegan diet. In June 2018, he performed at the Environmental Media Association (EMA) Honors Gala. While he was performing, the logo for vegan brand Beyond Meat was displayed on the screens behind him. In 2020, Snoop Dogg invested in vegan food company Original Foods, which makes Pigless Pork Rinds, which he has said are a favorite. He is an ambassador for Beyond Meat and lent his name and image as well as financial support for Beyond Meat&#x27;s Feed a Million+ campaign to provide a million frontline workers with Beyond Meat burgers.

Snoop Dogg had been temporarily living in an apartment complex in the Palms neighborhood in the West Los Angeles region, in the intersection of Vinton Avenue and Woodbine Streetthe location of the shooting. Both men were charged with murder, as Snoop Dogg was purportedly driving the vehicle from which the gun was fired. Johnnie Cochran defended them. Both Snoop Dogg and his bodyguard were acquitted on February 20, 1996. In February 2024, the case was sealed.

On April 26, 2006, Snoop Dogg and members of his entourage were arrested after being turned away from British Airways&#x27; first class lounge at Heathrow Airport in London. Snoop Dogg and his party were denied entry to the lounge due to some members flying in economy class. After being escorted outside, the group got in a fight with the police and vandalized a duty-free shop. Seven police officers were injured during the incident. After a night in jail, Snoop Dogg and the other men were released on bail the next day but he was unable to perform a scheduled concert in Johannesburg.

In September 2006, Snoop Dogg was detained at John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, by airport security after airport screeners found a collapsible police baton in his carry-on bag. Donald Etra, Snoop Dogg&#x27;s lawyer, told deputies the baton was a prop for a musical sketch.

==== 2015: Sweden arrest for illegal drug possession ====
Snoop Dogg, after performing for a concert in Uppsala, Sweden, on July 25, 2015, was pulled over and detained by Swedish police for allegedly using illegal drugs, violating a Swedish law enacted in 1988 which criminalized the recreational use of such substances – therefore making even being under the influence of any illegal/controlled substance a crime itself without possession. During the detention he was taken to the police station to perform a drug test and was released shortly afterwards. The rapid test was positive for traces of narcotics and he was potentially subject to fines depending on the results of more detailed analysis. Although final results &quot;strongly&quot; indicated drug use the charges were ultimately dropped because it could not be proven that he was in Sweden when he consumed the substances. The rapper uploaded several videos on the social networking site Instagram criticizing the police for alleged racial profiling; police spokesman Daniel Nilsson responded to the accusations, saying: &quot;we don&#x27;t work like that in Sweden&quot;. He declared in the videos, &quot;Niggas got me in the back of police car right now in Sweden, cuz&quot;, and &quot;Pulled a nigga over for nothing, taking us to the station where I&#x27;ve got to go pee in a cup for nothin&#x27;. I ain&#x27;t done nothin&#x27;. All I did was came to the country and did a concert and now I&#x27;ve got to go to the police station. For nothin&#x27;!&quot;. He announced to his Swedish fanbase that he would no longer go on tour in the country due to the incident.

==== 2005: Alleged assault of a fan and lawsuit ====
Snoop Dogg, Compton rapper Jayceon &quot;the Game&quot; Taylor and group Tha Dogg Pound, were sued for assaulting a fan on stage at a May 2005 concert at the White River Amphitheatre in Auburn, Washington. The accuser, Richard Monroe Jr., claimed he was beaten by the artists&#x27; entourage while mounting the stage. He alleged that he reacted to an &quot;open invite&quot; to come on stage. Before he could, Snoop Dogg&#x27;s bodyguards grabbed him and beat him into unconsciousness. He claimed attack by crew members; Snoop Dogg and Taylor were included in the suit for not intervening, but both parties denied ever having any involvement. The lawsuit focused on a pecuniary claim of $22 million in punitive and compensatory damages, battery, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The concerned parties appeared in court in April 2009; Snoop Dogg was cleared of the lawsuit in May.

==== 2016: Death Row bankruptcy case and compensation loss ====
In May 2016, through the Death Row Records bankruptcy case, Snoop Dogg lost $2 million.

==== Sexual assault lawsuits ====
In January 2005, Snoop Dogg was sued by a makeup artist who claimed that Snoop Dogg and several others drugged and raped her backstage at a Jimmy Kimmel Live taping in 2003. Snoop Dogg had filed an extortion lawsuit against the woman a month before she brought her case. In August 2005 the two parties settled, with the accuser stating &quot;the matter has been resolved amicably,&quot; and Snoop Dogg’s representative stating no money was exchanged.

In February 2022, a woman sued Snoop Dogg for $10 million, alleging that he sexually assaulted her in May 2013 following a concert in Anaheim, California. Only a few months after its filing, the suit was withdrawn, then reintroduced in July. In May 2023, court documents revealed that the case had been dismissed.

=== Regional or international banishments ===

==== 2006–2010: United Kingdom ====
On May 15, 2006, after his arrest on vandalism charges in London, the region&#x27;s Home Office decided that Snoop Dogg would be denied entry to the United Kingdom for the foreseeable future and his British visa was denied the following year. As of March 2010, however, Snoop Dogg was allowed back into the UK. The entire group was banned from British Airways &quot;for the foreseeable future&quot;. According to Snoop Dogg, Queen Elizabeth II overturned the ban, saying: &quot;This man has done nothing in our country. He can come.&quot;

==== 2007–2008: Australia ====
In April 2007, the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship banned Snoop Dogg from entering the country on character grounds, citing his prior criminal convictions. He had been scheduled to appear at the MTV Australia Video Music Awards on April 29, 2007. The Australian DIAC lifted the ban in September 2008 and had granted him a visa to tour Australia. The DIAC said: &quot;In making this decision, the department weighed his criminal convictions against his previous behaviour while in Australia, recent conduct – including charity work – and any likely risk to the Australian community … We took into account all relevant factors and, on balance, the department decided to grant the visa&quot;.

==== 2012–2014: Norway ====
Snoop Dogg was banned from entering Norway for two years in July 2012 after entering the country the month before in possession of 8 grams (0.3 oz) of marijuana and an undeclared 227,000 kr in cash, or about in 2022 terms.

==Awards and legacy==
&quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot;, and &quot;NME&quot; have called him a &quot;West Coast icon&quot;; and &quot;Press-Telegram&quot;, &quot;an icon of gangsta rap&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine called him &quot;The King of the West Coast&quot;. ABC News journalist Paul Donoughue, cited him among the 1990s acts that took hip-hop into the pop music charts.

Snoop Dogg popularized the use of &quot;&quot; particularly in the pop and hip-hop music industry. A type of infix, it first found popularity when used by Frankie Smith in his 1981 hit song &quot;Double Dutch Bus&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; Rob Fitzpatrick has credited his album &quot;Doggystyle&quot; for proving that rappers &quot;could reinvent themselves&quot;, expanding rap&#x27;s vocabulary, changing hip-hop fashions, and helping introduce a hip-hop genre called G-funk to a new generation. The album has been cited as an influence by rapper Kendrick Lamar, while fellow rappers ScHoolboy Q and Maxo Kream have also cited him as an influence.

<text>Bedford County is a county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As of the 2020 census, the population was 47,577. The county seat is Bedford. The county is part of the Southwest Pennsylvania region of the state.

==History==
===18th century===

According to historians in the 1930&#x27;s, &quot;in 1750, Robert MacRay, a Scots-Irish immigrant, opened the first trading post in Raystown (which is now Bedford) on the land that is now Bedford County.&quot; This information has since been proven incorrect. 

John Wray, the trader, established his trading post about two miles east of the site of Fort Bedford around 1740. The trading post, consisting of two or three buildings surrounded by a fence, was called a &#x27;town&#x27;. The word &#x27;town&#x27; was derived from the Old English &#x27;Tun&#x27;, which itself was derived from the Old German &#x27;Zaun&#x27; meaning a fence or wall. John Wray was not Robert MacRay. The historian John H. P. Adams misread the Act erecting Bedford County out of Cumberland County, on which it was noted that Robert MacRay was one of the four men chosen to &#x27;walk the boundary&#x27; and confirm the new county&#x27;s boundary line. The name &#x27;MacRay&#x27; is not a patrynomic of the name &#x27;Wray&#x27; meaning that the two are distinct family names and not associated. John H. P. Adams&#x27; mistake has been perpetuated, unfortunately. 

It should also be noted that the claim has been made that the village of Bedford was originally the village of Raystown. That is incorrect. When Henry Bouquet brought the British Army of General John Forbes into the region, there existed no village on the bluff overlooking the Juniata River, about two miles west of John Wray&#x27;s trading post. 

The early Anglo-American settlers had a difficult time dealing with raids from Native Americans. Native Americans became allied with the French in the North American theater of the war, known as the French and Indian War, of the Seven Years&#x27; War between those nations in Europe. The trading post of John Wray gave its name to the encampment made by the British Army under General john Forbes, but led in the field by Colonel Henry Bouquet. While Bouquet was having the fort constructed on the bluff overlooking the branch of the Juniata River, it was unnamed and Bouquet wrote all of his letters with some variations as from &quot;camp near Raystown&quot;. The fort, has erroneously been said to have been named &quot;Fort Raystown&quot; but it was not named anything until it was named &quot;Fort Bedford&quot; prior to December 1758.

In 1759, after the capture of Fort Duquesne in Allegheny County, on the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, English colonists built a road between the fort (which was renamed as Fort Pitt) to the newly built Fort Bedford in Raystown. The English defeated the French in the war and took over their territories in North America east of the Mississippi River. Treaties with the Indians opened more land for future peaceful settlement.

This road followed and improved on ancient Indian trails. In later years it was widened and paved as &quot;Forbes Road&quot;; it is now Route 30. When the Pennsylvania Turnpike was built, this interstate toll road became the main highway through Bedford County.

Bedford County was created on March 9, 1771, from part of Cumberland County and named in honor of Fort Bedford. The 1767 Mason–Dixon line had stabilized the southern border with Maryland. In the aftermath of the American Revolution, the population increased largely due to emigration. Within a lifetime Old Bedford County was greatly reduced from its original boundaries. Huntingdon County was created on September 20, 1787, mainly from the north part of Bedford County, plus an addition of territory on the east (Big Valley, Tuscarora Valley) from Cumberland County. Somerset County was created from part of Bedford County on April 17, 1795. Centre was created on February 13, 1800, from parts of Huntingdon, Lycoming, Mifflin, and Northumberland counties. Cambria County was created on March 26, 1804, from parts of Bedford, Huntingdon, and Somerset Counties. Blair County was created on February 26, 1846, from parts of Huntingdon and Bedford Counties. Finally Fulton County was created on April 19, 1850, from part of Bedford County, setting the county at its current boundaries.

The land was developed into lush farms with woodlands. It was developed as a trading center on the way to Pittsburgh and farther west of Pennsylvania. In 1794, President George Washington came to the county in response to the Whiskey Rebellion.

===19th century===
In the late 19th century, the Bedford Springs Hotel became an important site for wealthy vacationers. It was built near natural springs that had been important to the Native Americans for hundreds of years. During the administration of President James Buchanan, he moved much of his administration to the hotel, which became the informal summer White House. The U.S. Supreme Court met at the hotel once. It was the only time that the high court met outside of the capital.

During the late 19th century, the county had a population boom, with the number of people doubling between 1870 and 1890. Railroads constructed through the town connected the county with the mining industry. The story of the Lost Children of the Alleghenies originates from Blue Knob State Park in the county.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water. It has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;/&quot;Dfb&quot;) and average monthly temperatures in Bedford borough range from 28.1 °F in January to 72.0 °F in July. Bedford County is one of the 423 counties served by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and it is identified as part of &quot;Greater Appalachia&quot; by Colin Woodard in his book &quot;American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America&quot;.

==Geology==


Bedford County is situated along the western border of the Ridge and Valley physiographic province, which is characterized by folded and faulted sedimentary rocks of early to middle Paleozoic age. The northwestern border of the county is approximately at the Allegheny Front, a geological boundary between the Ridge and Valley Province and the Allegheny Plateau (characterized by relatively flat-lying sedimentary rocks of late Paleozoic age).

The stratigraphic record of sedimentary rocks within the county spans from the Cambrian Warrior Formation to the Pennsylvanian Conemaugh Group (in the Broad Top area). No igneous or metamorphic rocks of any kind exist within the county.

The primary mountains within the county (From west to east: Wills, Evitts, Dunning, and Tussey mountains) extend from the southern border with Maryland to the northeast into Blair County, and are held up by the Silurian Tuscarora Formation, made of quartz sandstone and conglomerate. Chestnut Ridge is a broad anticline held up by the Devonian Ridgeley Member of the Old Port Formation, also made of sandstone and conglomerate. Broad Top, located north of Breezewood, is a plateau of relatively flat-lying rocks that are stratigraphically higher, and thus younger (Mississippian and Pennsylvanian), than most of the other rocks within the county (Cambrian through Devonian). Broad Top extends into Huntingdon County to the north and Fulton County to the east.

The Raystown Branch of the Juniata River is the main drainage in the northern two-thirds of the county. The river flows to the east through the mountains within the county through several water gaps caused by a group of faults trending east–west through the central part of the county. The river then turns north and flows into Raystown Lake in Huntingdon County. The southern third of the county is drained by several tributaries of the Potomac River. Both the Potomac and Juniata rivers are part of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.

Several limestone quarries exist in Bedford County, most of which are owned and operated by New Enterprise Stone and Lime Company. Quarry locations include Ashcom, New Paris, Kilcoin, and Sproul.

Two coal fields exist within Bedford County. One is the Broad Top Field in the northeastern corner of the county, and the other is the Georges Creek Field along the southwestern border. Both fields contain bituminous coal. There are abandoned mines in both areas and acid mine drainage is an environmental problem in the Broad Top area, where several fishless streams exist as a result of the discharge from the abandoned mines.

Natural gas fields and storage areas exist in southeastern Bedford County, primarily within folded Devonian rocks south of Breezewood. Another deep gas field exists in the vicinity of Blue Knob on the border with Blair County to the north.

<text>A cataract is a cloudy area in the lens of the eye that leads to a decrease in vision of the eye. Cataracts often develop slowly and can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms may include faded colours, blurry or double vision, halos around light, trouble with bright lights, and difficulty seeing at night. This may result in trouble driving, reading, or recognizing faces. Poor vision caused by cataracts may also result in an increased risk of falling and depression. Cataracts cause 51% of all cases of blindness and 33% of visual impairment worldwide.
Cataracts are most commonly due to aging but may also occur due to trauma or radiation exposure, be present from birth, or occur following eye surgery for other problems. Risk factors include diabetes, longstanding use of corticosteroid medication, smoking tobacco, prolonged exposure to sunlight, and alcohol.In addition to these, poor nutrition, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and autoimmune diseases have been recognized in various studies as contributing to the development of cataracts. Cataract formation is primarily driven by oxidative stress, which damages lens proteins, leading to their aggregation and the accumulation of clumps of protein or yellow-brown pigment in the lens. This reduces the transmission of light to the retina at the back of the eye, impairing vision. Additionally, alterations in the lens’s metabolic processes, including imbalances in calcium and other ions, contribute to cataract development .The Diagnosis is typically by an eye examination with ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp examination being the most effective methods. During ophthalmoscopy, the pupil is dilated, and the red reflex is examined for any opacities in the lens. Slit-lamp examination provides further details on the character, location, and extent of the cataract.
Wearing sunglasses and a wide brimmed hat, eating leafy vegetables and fruits, and avoiding smoking may reduce the risk of developing cataracts, or slow the process. Early on, the symptoms may be improved with glasses. If this does not help, surgery to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial lens is the only effective treatment. Cataract surgery is not readily available in many countries, and surgery is needed only if the cataracts are causing problems and generally results in an improved quality of life.
About 20 million people worldwide are blind due to cataracts. It is the cause of approximately 5% of blindness in the United States and nearly 60% of blindness in parts of Africa and South America. Blindness from cataracts occurs in about 10 to 40 per 100,000 children in the developing world, and 1 to 4 per 100,000 children in the developed world. Cataracts become more common with age. In the United States, cataracts occur in 68% of those over the age of 80 years. Additionally they are more common in women, and less common in Hispanic and Black people.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms vary depending on the type of cataract, though considerable overlap occurs. People with nuclear sclerotic or brunescent cataracts often notice a reduction of vision. Nuclear cataracts typically cause greater impairment of distance vision than of near vision. Those with posterior subcapsular cataracts usually complain of glare as their major symptom.

The severity of cataract formation, assuming no other eye disease is present, is judged primarily by a visual acuity test. Other symptoms include frequent changes of glasses and colored halos due to hydration of lens.

Congenital cataracts can result in amblyopia if not treated in a timely manner.

== Causes ==

===Age===
Age is the most common cause of cataracts. Lens proteins denature and degrade over time, and this process is accelerated by diseases such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Environmental factors, including toxins, radiation, and ultraviolet light have cumulative effects which are worsened by the loss of protective and restorative mechanisms due to alterations in gene expression and chemical processes within the eye.

Oxidative stress associated with lipid peroxidation is an important pathogenic mechanism in cataract formation. Senile cataracts are associated with a decrease in antioxidant capacity in the lens. An increase in oxidative stress in the lens or a decrease in the ability to remove reactive oxygen species can lead to the lens becoming more opaque.

===Trauma===

Blunt trauma causes swelling, thickening, and whitening of the lens fibers. While the swelling normally resolves with time, the white color may remain. In severe blunt trauma, or in injuries that penetrate the eye, the capsule in which the lens sits can be damaged. This damage allows fluid from other parts of the eye to rapidly enter the lens leading to swelling and then whitening, obstructing light from reaching the retina at the back of the eye. Cataracts may develop in 0.7 to 8.0% of cases following electrical injuries. Blunt trauma can also result in star- (stellate) or petal-shaped cataracts.

===Radiation===
Cataracts can arise as an effect of exposure to various types of radiation. X-rays, one form of ionizing radiation, may damage the DNA of lens cells. Ultraviolet light, specifically UVB, has also been shown to cause cataracts, and some evidence indicates sunglasses worn at an early age can slow its development in later life. Microwaves, a type of nonionizing radiation, may cause harm by denaturing protective enzymes (e.g., glutathione peroxidase), by oxidizing protein thiol groups (causing protein aggregation), or by damaging lens cells via thermoelastic expansion. The protein coagulation caused by electric and heat injuries whitens the lens. This same process is what makes the clear albumen of an egg become white and opaque during cooking.

===Genetics===

The genetic component is strong in the development of cataracts, most commonly through mechanisms that protect and maintain the lens. The presence of cataracts in childhood or early life can occasionally be due to a particular syndrome. Examples of chromosome abnormalities associated with cataracts include 1q21.1 deletion syndrome, cri-du-chat syndrome, Down syndrome, Patau&#x27;s syndrome, trisomy 18 (Edward&#x27;s syndrome), and Turner&#x27;s syndrome, and in the case of neurofibromatosis type 2, juvenile cataract on one or both sides may be noted. Examples of single-gene disorder include Alport&#x27;s syndrome, Conradi&#x27;s syndrome, cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis, myotonic dystrophy, and oculocerebrorenal syndrome or Lowe syndrome.

===Skin diseases===
The skin and the lens have the same embryological origin and so can be affected by similar diseases. Those with atopic dermatitis and eczema occasionally develop shield ulcer cataracts. Ichthyosis is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with cuneiform cataracts and nuclear sclerosis. Basal-cell nevus and pemphigus have similar associations.

===Smoking and alcohol===

Cigarette smoking has been shown to increase the risk of age-related cataract and nuclear cataract. Evidence is conflicting over the effect of alcohol. Some surveys have shown a link, but others that followed people over longer terms have not.

===Inadequate vitamin C===
Low vitamin C intake and serum levels have been associated with greater cataract rates. However, use of supplements of vitamin C has not demonstrated benefit.

===Medications===
Some medications, such as systemic, topical, or inhaled corticosteroids, may increase the risk of cataract development. Corticosteroids most commonly cause posterior subcapsular cataracts. People with schizophrenia often have risk factors for lens opacities (such as diabetes, hypertension, and poor nutrition). Second-generation antipsychotic medications are unlikely to contribute to cataract formation. Miotics and triparanol may increase the risk.

===Post-operative===
Nearly every person who undergoes a vitrectomy—without ever having had cataract surgery—will experience progression of nuclear sclerosis after the operation. This may be because the native vitreous humor is different from the solutions used to replace the vitreous (vitreous substitutes), such as BSS Plus. This may also be because the native vitreous humour contains ascorbic acid which helps neutralize oxidative damage to the lens and because conventional vitreous substitutes do not contain ascorbic acid. Accordingly, for phakic patients requiring a vitrectomy it is becoming increasingly common for ophthalmologists to offer the vitrectomy combined with prophylactic cataract surgery to prevent cataract formation.

===Hyperbaric oxygen therapy===

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is the administration of 100% oxygen at pressures greater than one-atmosphere absolute pressure (1 ATA) for a therapeutic purpose. HBOT can have several side effects, including the long-term development of cataracts. This is rare and generally associated with multiple HBOT exposures over a long period. As it does not usually become symptomatic during HBOT, it may often go unrecognised and is probably under-reported. Evidence is emerging that lifetime dosage of oxygen may be a precipitating factor in the development of age-related cataracts. Nuclear cataracts have been hypothesized to be the end stage of the far better known phenomenon of hyperbaric myopic shift.

==Diagnosis==
===Classification===

Cataracts may be partial or complete, stationary or progressive, hard or soft. Histologically, the main types of age-related cataracts are nuclear sclerosis, cortical, and posterior subcapsular.

 is the most common type of cataract, and involves the central or &#x27;nuclear&#x27; part of the lens. This eventually becomes hard, or &#x27;sclerotic&#x27;, due to condensation on the lens nucleus and the deposition of brown pigment within the lens. In its advanced stages, it is called a brunescent cataract. In early stages, an increase in sclerosis may cause an increase in refractive index of the lens. This causes a myopic shift (lenticular shift) that decreases hyperopia and enables presbyopic patients to see at near without reading glasses. This is only temporary and is called second sight.

 are due to the lens cortex (outer layer) becoming opaque. They occur when changes in the fluid contained in the periphery of the lens cause fissuring. When these cataracts are viewed through an ophthalmoscope, or other magnification system, the appearance is similar to white spokes of a wheel. Symptoms often include problems with glare and light scatter at night.

 are cloudy at the back of the lens adjacent to the capsule (or bag) in which the lens sits. Because light becomes more focused toward the back of the lens, they can cause disproportionate symptoms for their size.

An immature cataract has some transparent protein, but with a mature cataract, all the lens protein is opaque. In a hypermature or Morgagnian cataract, the lens proteins have become liquid. Congenital cataract, which may be detected in adulthood, has a different classification and includes lamellar, polar, and sutural cataracts.

Cataracts can be classified by using the lens opacities classification system LOCS III. In this system, cataracts are classified based on type as nuclear, cortical, or posterior. The cataracts are further classified based on severity on a scale from 1 to 5. The LOCS III system is highly reproducible.

==Prevention==
Risk factors such as UVB exposure and smoking can be addressed. Although no means of preventing cataracts has been scientifically proven, wearing sunglasses that block ultraviolet light may slow their development. While adequate intake of vitamins A, C, and E may protect against the risk of cataracts, clinical trials have shown no benefit from supplements, although the evidence is mixed, but weakly positive, for a potential protective effect of the carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin.

==Treatment==

===Surgical===


The appropriateness of surgery depends on a person&#x27;s particular functional and visual needs and other risk factors. Cataract removal can be performed at any stage and no longer requires ripening of the lens. Surgery is usually outpatient and usually performed using local anesthesia. About 9 of 10 patients can achieve a corrected vision of 20/40 or better after surgery.

Several recent evaluations found that cataract surgery can meet expectations only when significant functional impairment due to cataracts exists before surgery. Visual function estimates such as VF-14 have been found to give more realistic estimates than visual acuity testing alone. In some developed countries, a trend to overuse cataract surgery has been noted, which may lead to disappointing results.

Phacoemulsification is the most widely used cataract surgery in the developed world. This procedure uses ultrasonic energy to emulsify the cataract lens. Phacoemulsification typically comprises six steps:
* Anaesthetic – The eye is numbed with either a subtenon injection around the eye (see: retrobulbar block) or topical anesthetic eye drops. The former also provides paralysis of the eye muscles.
* Corneal incision – Two cuts are made at the margin of the clear cornea to allow insertion of instruments into the eye.
* Capsulorhexis – A needle or small pair of forceps is used to create a circular hole in the capsule in which the lens sits.
* Phacoemulsification – A handheld ultrasonic probe is used to break up and emulsify the lens into liquid using the energy of ultrasound waves. The resulting &#x27;emulsion&#x27; is sucked away.
* Irrigation and aspiration – The cortex, which is the soft outer layer of the cataract, is aspirated or sucked away. Fluid removed is continually replaced with a saline solution to prevent collapse of the structure of the anterior chamber (the front part of the eye).
* Lens insertion – A plastic, foldable lens is inserted into the capsular bag that formerly contained the natural lens. Some surgeons also inject an antibiotic into the eye to reduce the risk of infection. The final step is to inject salt water into the corneal wounds to cause the area to swell and seal the incision.

A Cochrane review found little to no difference in visual acuity as a function of the size of incisions made for phacoemulsification in the range from ≤ 1.5 mm to 3.0 mm. Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) consists of removing the lens manually, but leaving the majority of the capsule intact. The lens is expressed through a 10- to 12-mm incision which is closed with sutures at the end of surgery. ECCE is less frequently performed than phacoemulsification, but can be useful when dealing with very hard cataracts or other situations where emulsification is problematic. Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS) has evolved from ECCE. In MSICS, the lens is removed through a self-sealing scleral tunnel wound in the sclera which, ideally, is watertight and does not require suturing. Although &quot;small&quot;, the incision is still markedly larger than the portal in phacoemulsification. This surgery is increasingly popular in the developing world where access to phacoemulsification is still limited.

Intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) is rarely performed. The lens and surrounding capsule are removed in one piece through a large incision while pressure is applied to the vitreous membrane. The surgery has a high rate of complications.

==Prognosis==

=== Postoperative care ===
The postoperative recovery period (after removing the cataract) is usually short. The patient is usually ambulatory on the day of surgery, but is advised to move cautiously and avoid straining or heavy lifting for about a month. The eye is usually patched on the day of surgery and use of an eye shield at night is often suggested for several days after surgery.

In all types of surgery, the cataractous lens is removed and replaced with an artificial lens, known as an intraocular lens, which stays in the eye permanently. Intraocular lenses are usually monofocal, correcting for either distance or near vision. Multifocal lenses may be implanted to improve near and distance vision simultaneously, but these lenses may increase the chance of unsatisfactory vision.

===Complications===

Serious complications of cataract surgery include retinal detachment and endophthalmitis. In both cases, patients notice a sudden decrease in vision. In endophthalmitis, patients often describe pain. Retinal detachment frequently presents with unilateral visual field defects, blurring of vision, flashes of light, or floating spots.

The risk of retinal detachment was estimated as about 0.4% within 5.5 years, corresponding to a 2.3-fold risk increase compared to naturally expected incidence, with older studies reporting a substantially higher risk. The incidence is increasing over time in a somewhat linear manner, and the risk increase lasts for at least 20 years after the procedure. Particular risk factors are younger age, male sex, longer axial length, and complications during surgery. In the highest risk group of patients, the incidence of pseudophakic retinal detachment may be as high as 20%.

The risk of endophthalmitis occurring after surgery is less than one in 1000.

Corneal edema and cystoid macular edema are less serious but more common, and occur because of persistent swelling at the front of the eye in corneal edema or back of the eye in cystoid macular edema. They are normally the result of excessive inflammation following surgery, and in both cases, patients may notice blurred, foggy vision. They normally improve with time and with application of anti-inflammatory drops. The risk of either occurring is around one in 100. It is unclear whether NSAIDs or corticosteroids are superior at reducing postoperative inflammation.

Posterior capsular opacification, also known as after-cataract, is a condition in which months or years after successful cataract surgery, vision deteriorates or problems with glare and light scattering recur, usually due to thickening of the back or posterior capsule surrounding the implanted lens, so-called &#x27;posterior lens capsule opacification&#x27;. Growth of natural lens cells remaining after the natural lens was removed may be the cause, and the younger the patient, the greater the chance of this occurring. Management involves cutting a small, circular area in the posterior capsule with targeted beams of energy from a laser, called capsulotomy, after the type of laser used. The laser can be aimed very accurately, and the small part of the capsule which is cut falls harmlessly to the bottom of the inside of the eye. This procedure leaves sufficient capsule to hold the lens in place, but removes enough to allow light to pass directly through to the retina. Serious side effects are rare. Posterior capsular opacification is common and occurs following up to one in four operations, but these rates are decreasing following the introduction of modern intraocular lenses together with a better understanding of the causes.

Vitreous touch syndrome is a possible complication of intracapsular cataract extraction.

==Epidemiology==

Age-related cataracts are responsible for 51% of world blindness, about 20 million people. Globally, cataracts cause moderate to severe disability in 53.8 million (2004), 52.2 million of whom are in low and middle income countries.

In many countries, surgical services are inadequate, and cataracts remain the leading cause of blindness. Even where surgical services are available, low vision associated with cataracts may still be prevalent as a result of long waits for, and barriers to, surgery, such as cost, lack of information and transportation problems.

In the United States, age-related lens changes have been reported in 42% between the ages of 52 and 64, 60% between the ages 65 and 74, and 91% between the ages of 75 and 85. Cataracts affect nearly 22 million Americans age 40 and older. By age 80, more than half of all Americans have cataracts. Direct medical costs for cataract treatment are estimated at $6.8 billion annually.

In the eastern Mediterranean region, cataracts are responsible for over 51% of blindness. Access to eye care in many countries in this region is limited. Childhood-related cataracts are responsible for 5–20% of world childhood blindness.

Vision loss due to cataracts increases the risk of dementia in the elderly population, increases the likelihood of falls and road traffic accidents, and by detrimental effects on the quality of life increases mortality.

== History ==
Cataract surgery was first described by the Ayurvedic physician, Suśruta (about 5th century BCE) in &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot; in ancient India. Most of the methods mentioned focus on hygiene. Follow-up treatments include bandaging of the eye and covering the eye with warm butter. References to cataracts and their treatment in Ancient Rome are also found in 29 AD in &quot;De Medicinae&quot;, the work of the Latin encyclopedist Aulus Cornelius Celsus. Archaeological evidence of eye surgery in the Roman era also exists.

Galen of Pergamon (ca. 2nd century CE), a prominent Greek physician, surgeon and philosopher, performed an operation similar to modern cataract surgery. Using a needle-shaped instrument, Galen attempted to remove the cataract-affected lens of the eye.

Muslim ophthalmologist Ammar Al-Mawsili, in his &quot;The Book of Choice in Ophthalmology&quot;, written &quot;circa&quot; 1000 CE, wrote of his invention of a syringe and the technique of cataract extraction while experimenting with it on a patient.

In 1468 Abiathar Crescas, a Jewish physician and astrologer of the Crown of Aragon, famously removed the cataracts of King John II of Aragon, restoring his eyesight.

===Etymology===
&quot;Cataract&quot; is derived from the Latin &#x27;, meaning &quot;waterfall&quot;, and from the Ancient Greek (&#x27;), &quot;down-rushing&quot;, from καταράσσω (&quot;katarassō&quot;) meaning &quot;to dash down&quot; (from &quot;kata&quot;-, &quot;down&quot;; &quot;arassein&quot;, &quot;to strike, dash&quot;). As rapidly running water turns white, so the term may have been used metaphorically to describe the similar appearance of mature ocular opacities. In Latin, &quot;cataracta&quot; had the alternative meaning &quot;portcullis&quot; and the name possibly passed through French to form the English meaning &quot;eye disease&quot; (early 15th century), on the notion of &quot;obstruction&quot;. Early Persian physicians called the term &quot;nazul-i-ah&quot;, or &quot;descent of the water&quot;—vulgarised into waterfall disease or cataract—believing such blindness to be caused by an outpouring of corrupt humour into the eye.

==Research==
N-Acetylcarnosine drops have been investigated as a medical treatment for cataracts. The drops are believed to work by reducing oxidation and glycation damage in the lens, particularly reducing crystallin crosslinking. Some benefit has been shown in small manufacturer-sponsored randomized controlled trials but further independent corroboration is still required.

Femtosecond laser mode-locking, used during cataract surgery, was originally used to cut accurate and predictable flaps in LASIK surgery, and has been introduced to cataract surgery. The incision at the junction of the sclera and cornea and the hole in capsule during capsulorhexis, traditionally made with a handheld blade, needle, and forceps, are dependent on skill and experience of the surgeon. Sophisticated three-dimensional images of the eyes can be used to guide lasers to make these incisions. A can also then break up the cataract as in phacoemulsification.

Stem cells have been used in a clinical trial, with results submitted in 2014 and published in March 2016, for lens regeneration in twelve children under the age of two with cataracts present at birth. The children were followed for six months, so it is unknown what the long-term results have been, and it is unknown if this procedure would work in adults.

<doc id="88935" wikidata="Q193970" url="?curid=88935" title="Casein">
<text>Casein ( , from Latin &quot;caseus&quot; &quot;cheese&quot;) is a family of related phosphoproteins (αS1, aS2, β, κ) that are commonly found in mammalian milk, comprising about 80% of the proteins in cow&#x27;s milk and between 20% and 60% of the proteins in human milk. Sheep and cow milk have a higher casein content than other types of milk with human milk having a particularly low casein content.

Casein is the primary emulsifier in milk, that is, it helps in mixing oils, fats, and water in milk.

Casein has a wide variety of uses, from being a major component of cheese, to use as a food additive. The most common form of casein is sodium caseinate (historically called nutrose), which is a very efficient emulsifier. Casein is secreted into milk from mammary cells in the form of colloidal casein micelles, a type of biomolecular condensate.

As a food source, casein supplies amino acids, carbohydrates, and two essential elements, calcium and phosphorus.

== Composition ==
Casein contains a high number of proline amino acids which hinder the formation of common secondary structural motifs of proteins. There are also no disulfide bridges. As a result, it has relatively little tertiary structure. It is relatively hydrophobic, making it poorly soluble in water. It is found in milk as a suspension of particles, called casein micelles, which show only limited resemblance with surfactant-type micelles in a sense that the hydrophilic parts reside at the surface and they are spherical. However, in sharp contrast to surfactant micelles, the interior of a casein micelle is highly hydrated. The caseins in the micelles are held together by calcium ions and hydrophobic interactions. Any of several molecular models could account for the special conformation of casein in the micelles. One of them proposes the micellar nucleus is formed by several submicelles, the periphery consisting of microvillosities of κ-casein. Another model suggests the nucleus is formed by casein-interlinked fibrils. Finally, the most recent model proposes a double link among the caseins for gelling to take place. All three models consider micelles as colloidal particles formed by casein aggregates wrapped up in soluble κ-casein molecules.

The isoelectric point of casein is 4.6. Since milk&#x27;s pH is 6.6, casein has a negative charge in milk. The purified protein is water-insoluble. While it is also insoluble in neutral salt solutions, it is readily dispersible in dilute alkalis and in salt solutions such as aqueous sodium oxalate and sodium acetate.

The enzyme trypsin can hydrolyze a phosphate-containing peptone. It is used to form a type of organic adhesive.

==Uses==

===Paint===

Casein paint is a fast-drying, water-soluble medium used by artists. Casein paint has been used since ancient Egyptian times as a form of tempera paint, and was widely used by commercial illustrators as the material of choice until the late 1960s when, with the advent of acrylic paint, casein became less popular. It is still widely used by scenic painters, although acrylic has made inroads in that field as well.

===Glue===

Casein-based glues are formulated from casein, water, and alkalis (usually a mix of hydrated lime and sodium hydroxide). Milk is skimmed to remove the fat, then the milk is soured so that the casein is precipitated as milk curd. The curd is washed (removing the whey), and then the curd is pressed to squeeze out the water (it may even be dried to a powder). The casein is mixed with alkali (usually both sodium and calcium hydroxide) to make glue. Glues made with different mixes of alkalis have different properties. Preservatives may also be added.

They were popular for woodworking, including for aircraft, as late as the de Havilland &quot;Albatross&quot; airliner in 1939.

Casein glue is also used in transformer manufacturing (specifically transformer board) due to its oil permeability.

Elmer&#x27;s Glue-All, Elmer&#x27;s School Glue and many other Borden adhesives were originally made from casein. While one reason was its non-toxic nature, a primary factor was that it was economical to use. Towards the end of the 20th century, Borden replaced casein in all of its popular adhesives with synthetics like PVA.

While largely replaced with synthetic resins, casein-based glues still have a use in certain niche applications, such as laminating fireproof doors and the labeling of bottles. Casein glues thin rapidly with increasing temperature, making it easy to apply thin films quickly to label jars and bottles on a production line.

===Food===
Several foods, creams, and toppings all contain a variety of caseinates. Sodium caseinate acts as a greater food additive for stabilizing processed foods; however, companies could opt to use calcium caseinate to increase calcium content and decrease sodium levels in their products.

The main food uses of casein are for powders requiring rapid dispersion into water, ranging from coffee creamers to instant cream soups. Mead Johnson introduced a product in the early 1920s named Casec to ease gastrointestinal disorders and infant digestive problems which were a common cause of death in children at that time.

All caseinates have very efficient emulsifying properties and widely used to make emulsions in foods.

It is believed to neutralize capsaicin, the active ingredient of chili peppers such as jalapeños, and habaneros. Milk is often consumed to decrease irritation caused by spicy foods.

====Cheesemaking====

Cheese consists of proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. It is produced by coagulation that is caused by destabilization of the casein micelle, which begins the processes of fractionation and selective concentration. Typically, the milk is acidified and then coagulated by the addition of rennet, containing a proteolytic enzyme known as rennin; traditionally obtained from the stomachs of calves, but currently produced more often from genetically modified microorganisms. The solids are then separated and pressed into final form.

Unlike many proteins, casein is not coagulated by heat. During the process of clotting, milk-clotting proteases act on the soluble portion of the caseins, κ-casein, thus originating an unstable micellar state that results in clot formation. When coagulated with chymosin, casein is sometimes called paracasein. Chymosin (EC 3.4.23.4) is an aspartic protease that specifically hydrolyzes the peptide bond in Phe105-Met106 of κ-casein, and is considered to be the most efficient protease for the cheese-making industry (Rao et al., 1998). British terminology, on the other hand, uses the term caseinogen for the uncoagulated protein and casein for the coagulated protein. As it exists in milk, it is a salt of calcium.

====Protein supplements====
An attractive property of the casein molecule is its ability to form a gel or clot in the stomach, which makes it very efficient in nutrient supply. The clot is able to provide a sustained slow release of amino acids into the blood stream, sometimes lasting for several hours. Often casein is available as &quot;hydrolyzed casein&quot;, whereby it is hydrolyzed by a protease such as trypsin. Hydrolyzed forms are noted to taste bitter and such supplements are often refused by infants and lab animals in favor of intact casein.

===Plastics and fiber===

Some of the earliest plastics were based on casein. In particular, galalith was well known for use in buttons. Fiber can be made from extruded casein. Lanital, a fabric made from casein fiber (known as Aralac in the United States), was particularly popular in Italy during the 1930s.

===Medical and dental uses===
Casein-derived compounds are used in tooth remineralization products to stabilize amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) and release the ACP onto tooth surfaces, where it can facilitate remineralization.

Casein and gluten exclusion diets are sometimes used in alternative medicine for children with autism. As of 2015 the evidence that such diets have any impact on behavior or cognitive and social functioning in autistic children was limited and weak.

=== Nanotechnological uses ===
Casein proteins have potential for use as nanomaterials due to their readily available source (milk) and their propensity to self-assemble into amyloid fibrils.

==Potential health issues and effects==

There is no good evidence that caseins in milk increase the risk of getting cancer.

===A1/A2 beta caseins in milk===
A1 and A2 beta-casein are genetic variants of the beta-casein milk protein that differ by one amino acid; a proline occurs at position 67 in the chain of amino acids that make up the A2 beta-casein, while in A1 beta-casein a histidine occurs at that position. Due to the way that beta-casein interacts with enzymes found in the digestive system, A1 and A2 are processed differently by digestive enzymes, and a seven-amino peptide, beta-casomorphin-7, (BCM-7) can be released by digestion of A1-beta-casein.

The A1 beta-casein type is the most common type found in cow&#x27;s milk in Europe (excluding Italy and France which have more A2 cows), the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.

Interest in the distinction between A1 and A2 beta-casein proteins began in the early 1990s through epidemiological research and animal studies initially conducted by scientists in New Zealand, which found correlations between the prevalence of milk with A1 beta-casein proteins and various chronic diseases. The research generated interest in the media, among some in the scientific community, and entrepreneurs. A company, A2 Corporation, was founded in New Zealand in the early 2000s to commercialize the test and market &quot;A2 Milk&quot; as premium milk that is healthier due to the lack of peptides from A1. A2 Milk even petitioned the Food Standards Australia New Zealand regulatory authority to require a health warning on ordinary milk.

Responding to public interest, the marketing of A2 milk, and the scientific evidence that had been published, an independent review published in 2005 found no discernible difference between drinking A1 or A2 milk on the risk of contracting chronic diseases. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed the scientific literature and published a review in 2009 found no identifiable relationship between chronic diseases and drinking milk with the A1 protein.

===Casein allergy ===
A small fraction of the population is allergic to casein. Casein intolerance, also known as &quot;milk protein intolerance&quot;, is experienced when the body cannot break down the proteins of casein. The prevalence of casein allergy or intolerance ranges from 0.25% to 4.9% of young children. Numbers for older children and adults are not known. A significant portion of those on the autism spectrum have an intolerance or allergy to casein protein into adulthood. This can be used by clinicians and dietitians to spot autism in those who may not present with traditional autistic traits. A diet known as casein-free, gluten free (CFGF) is commonly practiced by these individuals after discovering their intolerance or allergy.

Casein that is heat-treated has been shown to be more allergenic and harder to digest when fed to infants. Breast milk has not typically been shown to cause an allergic reaction, but should be administered to an infant with caution each time in case of adverse reaction from something the breastfeeding parent consumed that contained casein. Following a casein-free diet has been shown to improve outcomes of infants who are breastfed while allergic or intolerant to dairy protein. Human breast milk has been proven to be the best food for an infant, and should be tried first where available.

Supplementation of protease enzyme has been shown to help casein intolerant individuals digest the protein with minimal adverse reaction.

<text>The state flag of Alaska displays eight gold stars, forming the Big Dipper and Polaris, on a dark blue field. The Big Dipper is an asterism in the constellation Ursa Major, which symbolizes a bear, indigenous to Alaska. As depicted on the flag, its stars can be used as a guide by the novice to locate Polaris and determine true north.

The design was created by Benny Benson of Seward and selected from among roughly 700 entries in a 1927 contest. In 2001, a survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association placed Alaska&#x27;s flag fifth best in design quality out of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state, and U.S. territory flags ranked. It finished behind the flags of New Mexico, Texas, Quebec, and Maryland respectively.

==Design and origin==
Thirty-two years before Alaska became a state, the Alaska Department of the American Legion sponsored a territorial contest for Alaskan children from seventh grade (age 12–13) to twelfth grade (age 17–18) to design a flag for the territory. In 1927, the contest committee chose fourteen year-old orphan Benny Benson&#x27;s design to represent the future flag of the Territory of Alaska. Benson, an Alaska Native, was a resident at the Jesse Lee Home for Children in Seward. Until that time, Alaskans had flown only the U.S. flag since the territory&#x27;s purchase from Russia in 1867. Benson&#x27;s design was chosen over roughly 700 other submissions from schoolchildren territory-wide. Most other entries featured variations on the territorial seal, the midnight sun, the northern lights, polar bears, and/or gold pans. To celebrate his achievement, Benson was awarded $1,000 and an engraved watch.

Benny looked to the sky for the symbols he included in his design. Choosing the familiar constellation he looked for every night before going to sleep at the orphanage, he submitted this description with it:

The official design of the flag is outlined in the Alaska Statutes by The Alaska State Legislature, which explains the flag&#x27;s colors and symbolism, along with proper display, folding, presentation, and retirement of the flag.

==History==
===Russian-American Company Flag===

Between 1799 and 1867 Alaska was governed by the Russian-American Company (RAC), a state-sponsored commercial company initially headquartered in Irkutsk, then St. Petersburg, Russia. The flag flown by the Company&#x27;s ships and their shore establishments was Russia&#x27;s commercial flag (civil ensign). On September 28 (October 10, new style) 1806, Aleksandr I, Emperor of Russia made a notation on the design submitted to him of a new flag for the Russian-American Company; &quot;So be it&quot;, and added his cypher, thereby approving the first flag in Russia&#x27;s history to be used by an Imperial chartered company. After Imperial confirmation, the case was heard in the Senate and on October 19, 1806, was sent for execution to the main office of the Russian-American Company (RAC), and also to the Admiralty and Commerce colleges.

The new Company flag design of 1806 placed the Imperial eagle in the upper left quarter of Russia&#x27;s commercial flag. In order that the State symbol remain unobstructed and more visible the width of the white stripe was enlarged to cover roughly one half of the flag&#x27;s width. The normal width proportions of Russia&#x27;s commercial flag were equal thirds. The Imperial eagle carried a scroll that dipped into the blue stripe, also for more visibility, which read, in abbreviated form &quot;Russian American Company&#x27;s&quot;. The symbolism of the scroll beneath the Imperial eagle complements the official version of the Company&#x27;s name &quot;Under His Imperial Majesty&#x27;s Protection Russian-American Company.&quot;

The flag flew over Alaska until October 18, 1867, when all Russian and American Company holdings in Alaska were sold to the United States.

===State flag===
The Alaska Legislature adopted Benson&#x27;s design as the official flag for the Territory of Alaska on May 2, 1927. The first flag made based on Benny&#x27;s design was made of blue silk and appliquéd gold stars. It was retained as the state flag at statehood in 1959.

The flag&#x27;s symbolism is described in the state song, &quot;Alaska&#x27;s Flag.&quot;

<text>Fort Duquesne ( , ; originally called &quot;Fort Du Quesne&quot;) was a fort established by the French in 1754, at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. It was later taken over by the British, and later the Americans, and developed as Pittsburgh in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Fort Duquesne was destroyed by the French before its British conquest during the Seven Years&#x27; War, known as the French and Indian War on the North American front. The British replaced it, building Fort Pitt between 1759 and 1761. The site of both forts is now occupied by Point State Park, where the outlines of the two forts have been laid in granite slabs.

==History==
===18th century===

Fort Duquesne, built at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers which forms the Ohio River, was considered strategically important for controlling the Ohio Country, both for settlement and for trade. The English merchant William Trent had established a highly successful trading post at the forks as early as the 1740s, to do business with a number of nearby Native American villages. Both the French and the British were keen to gain advantage in the area.

As the area was within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River, the French had claimed it as theirs. They controlled New France (Quebec), the Illinois Country along the Mississippi, and La Louisiane, the ports of New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama.

In the early 1750s, the French began construction of a line of forts, starting with Fort Presque Isle on Lake Erie in present-day Erie, Pennsylvania, followed by Fort Le Boeuf, about 15 miles south in present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania, and Fort Machault, on the Allegheny River in Venango County in present-day Franklin, Pennsylvania.

Robert Dinwiddie, Lieutenant Governor of the Virginia Colony, thought these forts threatened extensive claims to the land area by Virginians (including himself) of the Ohio Company.

In late autumn 1753, Dinwiddie dispatched a young Virginia militia officer named George Washington to the area to deliver a letter to the French commander at Fort Le Boeuf, asking them to leave. Washington was also to assess French strength and intentions. After reaching Fort Le Boeuf in December, Washington was politely rebuffed by the French.

Following Washington&#x27;s return to Mount Vernon in January 1754, Dinwiddie sent Virginians to build Fort Prince George at the Forks of the Ohio. Work began on the fort on February 17. By April 18, a much larger French force of five hundred under the command of Claude-Pierre Pécaudy de Contrecœur arrived at the forks, forcing the small British garrison to surrender. The French knocked down the tiny British fort and built Fort Duquesne, named in honor of Marquis Duquesne, the governor-general of New France. The fort was built on the same model as the French Fort Frontenac on Lake Ontario.

Washington, who was lieutenant colonel in the newly created Virginia Regiment, set out on April 2, 1754, with a small force to build a road to, and then defend, Fort Prince George. Washington was at Wills Creek in north central Maryland when he received news of the fort&#x27;s surrender. On May 28, Washington encountered a Canadian scouting party near a place now known as Jumonville Glen (several miles east of present-day Uniontown). Washington attacked the French Canadians, killing 10 in the early morning hours, and took 21 prisoners, of whom many were ritually killed by the Native American allies of the British. On May 31, Washington replaced Colonel Joshua Fry as commander of the Virginia Regiment after Colonel Fry died en route to Wills Creek.

The Battle of Jumonville Glen is widely considered the formal start of the French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War.

Washington ordered construction of Fort Necessity at a large clearing known as the Great Meadows. On 3 July 1754, the counterattacking French and Canadians forced Washington to surrender Fort Necessity. After disarming them, they released Washington and his men to return home.

Although Fort Duquesne&#x27;s location at the forks looked strong on a map—controlling the confluence of three rivers—the reality was rather different. The site was low, swampy, and prone to flooding. In addition, the position was dominated by highlands across the Monongahela River, which would allow an enemy to bombard the fort with ease. Pécaudy de Contrecœur was preparing to abandon the fort in the face of Braddock&#x27;s advance in 1755. He was able to retain it due to the advancing British force being annihilated (see below). When the Forbes expedition approached in 1758, the French had initial success in the Battle of Fort Duquesne against the English vanguard, but were forced to abandon the fort in the face of the much superior size of Forbes&#x27; main force.

The French held the fort successfully early in the war, turning back the expedition led by General Edward Braddock during the 1755 Battle of the Monongahela. George Washington served as one of General Braddock&#x27;s aides. A smaller attack by James Grant in September 1758 was repulsed with heavy losses.

Two months later, on November 25, 1758, the Forbes Expedition under the Scotsman General John Forbes took possession Fort Duquesne after the French destroyed and abandoned the site.

==Present-day site==
Fort Duquesne was built at the point of land of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers, where they form the Ohio River. Since the late 20th century, this area of Downtown Pittsburgh has been preserved as Point State Park. The park includes a brick outline of the fort&#x27;s walls, as well as outlines to mark the later Fort Pitt.

In May 2007, Thomas Kutys, an archaeologist with A.D. Marble &amp; Company, a Cultural Resource Management firm based in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, discovered a stone and brick drain on the Fort Duquesne site. It is thought to have drained one of the fort&#x27;s many buildings. Due to its depth in the ground, this drain may be all of the fort that has survived. The entire northern half of the former fort site was disrupted and destroyed by the heavy industrial development of the area during the 19th century.

==Commemoration==

On November 25, 1958, the 200th anniversary of the capture of Fort Duquesne, the U.S. Post Office issued a 4-cent Fort Duquesne bicentennial commemorative stamp. It was first released for sale at the post office in Pittsburgh. The design was reproduced from a composite drawing, using various figures taken from an etching by T.B. Smith and a painting portraying the British occupation of the site as the Fort Duquesne blockhouse burns in the background.

Colonel Washington is depicted on horseback in the center, while General Forbes, who was debilitated by intestinal disease, is shown lying on a stretcher. The stamp also depicts Colonel Henry Bouquet, who was second in command to the ailing Forbes, and other figures who represent the Virginia militia and provincial army.

==In media==
Fort Duquesne is the subject of, or referenced, in:
*In 1873, Fort Duquesne is the subject of &quot;Old Fort Duquesne&quot;, a historical novel by Charles McKnight, which retells the role of Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War.
*In 2012, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed III&quot; features Fort Duquesne long after the British rebuilt it. It is one of the main forts in the game that Connor has to conquer to reclaim it for the Continental Army.
*In November 2016, Fort Duquesne appeared in Episode Seven of the first season of the NBC television series &quot;Timeless&quot;.
*In 2020, &quot;Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition&quot; features Fort Duquesne being captured by the French in the beginning of the French and Indian War.

<text>Fort Prince George (sometimes referred to as Trent&#x27;s Fort) was an incomplete fort on what is now the site of Pittsburgh, at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. The plan to occupy the strategic forks was formed by Virginia Lieutenant Governor Robert Dinwiddie, on the advice of Major George Washington, whom Dinwiddie had sent on a mission to warn French commanders they were on English territory in late 1753, and who had made a military assessment and a map of the site. The fort was still under construction when it was discovered by the French, who sent troops to capture it. The French then constructed Fort Duquesne on the site.

== Background ==

In 1749 the British Crown awarded the Ohio Company a grant of 500,000 acres in the Ohio Country between the Monongahela and the Kanawha Rivers, provided that the company would settle 100 families within seven years. The Ohio Company was also required to construct a fort and provide a garrison to protect the settlement at their own expense. The Treaty of Logstown was intended to open up land for settlement so that the Ohio Company could meet the seven-year deadline, and to obtain explicit permission to construct a fort.

On 29 May 1751, at a council meeting at Logstown between George Croghan, Andrew Montour and representatives of the Six Nations, Croghan reported the following statement from Iroquois speaker Toanahiso:
:&quot;We expect that you our Brothers will build a Strong House on the River Ohio, that if we should be obliged to engage in a war that we should have a Place to secure our Wives and Children...Now, Brothers, we will take two months to consider and choose out a place fit for that Purpose, and then we will send You word. We hope Brothers that as soon as you receive our Message you will order such a House to be built. Brothers: that you may consider well the necessity of building such a Place of Security to strengthen our arms, and that this, our first request of that kind may have a good effect on your minds.&quot;

Governor Hamilton used this statement as evidence to the Pennsylvania Provincial Council that they should pay for the construction of a fort at a site selected by the sachems at Logstown, arguing that unless the fort were built, the English might lose not only Indian support, but control over the fur trade in Ohio. However, the Provincial Council decided not to provide funding for a fort, arguing that fair dealings and occasional presents would hold the Indians as allies. At the Treaty of Logstown in June 1752, Tanacharison agreed to the construction of a fort upriver from Logstown, and Virginia&#x27;s Ohio Company began construction of a road from Will&#x27;s Creek to the Monongahela River where they built a storehouse at the mouth of Redstone Creek. At a meeting in Winchester, Virginia in September 1753, Native American leaders expressed willingness to cooperate with the British and repeated their request that a fort be built on the Ohio. The following summer, the Ohio Company obtained permission from the Six Nations to build Fort Prince George.

=== Washington&#x27;s journey ===

Governor Dinwiddie decided to warn the French that they were occupying British-claimed land. He assigned the 21-year-old Major George Washington to carry the message to French commander Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre at Fort Le Boeuf. Washington left Williamsburg, Virginia on October 31, 1753. On his way to Logstown to meet with Native American allies, he stopped at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, noting that &quot;I spent some Time in viewing the Rivers, and the Land in the Fork, which I think extremely well situated for a Fort, as it has the absolute Command of both Rivers.&quot; Washington met with the French commander, who refused to acknowledge that the British had any claim over land in the Ohio Country. On January 6 1754, near Will&#x27;s Creek, while Washington was on his way back to Williamsburg, he met &quot;17 horses loaded with Materials and stores for a fort at the Forks of the Ohio.&quot; These supplies were intended for Fort Prince George.

=== Trent&#x27;s orders ===

On January 26, Governor Dinwiddie issued a captain&#x27;s commission in the Virginia militia to fur trader William Trent, with orders to raise one hundred men who would &quot;keep possession of his Majesty&#x27;s land on the Ohio, and waters thereof, and to dislodge and drive away, and...to kill and destroy, or take prisoners, all and every person and persons whatsoever, not subjects of the King of Great Britain, who now are, or shall hereafter come to settle, and take possession of any lands on the said Ohio.&quot; A second letter informed Trent that he should proceed to the Ohio River to assist in the building of a fort there and defend it against any French actions. George Washington was ordered to raise an additional one hundred men to garrison the fort.

== Construction ==

According to the 1756 deposition of Ensign Edward Ward, on February 17 Trent met Christopher Gist and Seneca leader Tanacharison and his followers, at the Forks of the Ohio. After clearing the ground, Tanacharison &quot;laid the first log and said that the fort belonged to the English &amp; them and whoever offered to prevent the building of it, they, the Indians, would make war against them.&quot; Construction was initiated by 33 Virginia militia, with 8 fur traders and trappers recruited by Trent with the assistance of his friend, Indian trader John Fraser, to whom Trent gave a lieutenant&#x27;s commission. Trent accepted on condition that he be permitted to remain at his plantation, where he was engaged in fur trading, and come to the fort only once a week or whenever necessary. Within 10 days they had &quot;finished a Store House, and a large quantity of timber hew&#x27;d, boards saw&#x27;d, and shingles made.&quot; The fort was referred to as &quot;Trent&#x27;s Fort,&quot; and the title of Fort Prince George, (named for the crown prince and later King George III), was not attached to the fort until September 1754, when Governor Dinwiddie proposed it in a letter to his London superiors.

== Capture ==

On March 4 1754, a French detachment under Michel Maray de La Chauvignerie discovered the fort under construction. Chauvignerie immediately reported to Claude-Pierre Pécaudy de Contrecœur at Venango, that &quot;The scouts...took notice [of] an advanced house almost made, which is to serve as a Magazine, but because of the distance they could not know in what manner they were constructing their fort, since it was still only marked out.&quot; Governor-General Duquesne wrote immediately to Contrecœur: &quot;From the letter from Sieur La Chauvignerie of March 11, it appears that the English are planning to settle at the mouth of [the Allegheny River], since there is already a storehouse built there. You must hasten, Sir, to interrupt and even destroy their work from the start, because their consolidation would lead us to a siege...which it would
be wise to avoid, considering the bad state of the finances of the King.&quot;

At that point, only a storehouse had been built, as Trent&#x27;s men were still clearing the land and preparing stakes for the palisade. They had been subsisting on flour and corn they brought with them, along with meat traded to them by Native Americans from Logstown, but their supplies were running low. They were anticipating the arrival of now Lieutenant Colonel Washington and his troops, but on March 17, Trent decided to travel to Wills Creek to obtain more supplies, leaving Ensign Edward Ward in command, as Lieutenant Fraser was at his own plantation at Turtle Creek, tending to personal business. 

On April 13, Ensign Ward received word that a French military force was descending the Allegheny and would arrive within days. Alarmed, he went to inform Lieutenant Fraser, but there was nothing they could do except abandon the fort, in violation of their orders. Fraser refused to return to the fort, leaving Ward to confront the French. Ward returned to the construction site and had his men erect a stockade wall around the storehouse, completing it on April 16. Ward was determined to &quot;hold out to the last extremity before it should be said that the English had retreated like cowards before the French forces appeared&quot; as that &quot;would give the Indians a very indifferent opinion of the English ever after.&quot; In his deposition of June 30, 1756, Ensign Ward reported that &quot;there was no Fort but a few Palisades he ordered to be cut and put up four days before the French came down.&quot;

In April, a force of more than 600 men under the command of Captain Contrecœur traveled in pirogues and batteaux down the Allegheny River from Venango, landing at Shannopin&#x27;s Town. On April 18 the French Commander sent Captain Francois Le Mercier, two drummers and an interpreter to present Ensign Ward with a summons stating that the French Army intended to lay siege to the fort, and commanded Ward to &quot;retreat peaceably with your troops&quot; and &quot;not to return.&quot; Ward and his men were given one hour to leave. Ward, on advice from Tanacharison, who was present, requested that the French wait until Ward&#x27;s commanding officer, Captain Trent, returned, but Contrecœur refused. Ward then asked if the British might wait until the following day to leave, and Contrecœur agreed. He then invited Ward to dine with him, and Ward accepted. At dinner, Ward politely refused to discuss military or political matters, and declined Contrecœur&#x27;s offer to buy Ward&#x27;s carpentry tools.

According to Ward, &quot;the French entered, but behaved with great civility [and] said it might be their fate ere long to surrender it again so they would set [us] a good example. They however immediately went to work removing some of the logs as they complained the fort was not to their liking, and by break of day next morning 50 men went off with axes to hew logs to enlarge it.&quot; Tanacharison &quot;stormed greatly at the
French and told them it was he Order&#x27;d that Fort and laid the first Log of it himself, but the French paid no Regard to what he said.&quot; The British withdrew, and the French destroyed the partially built fort in order to construct their own.

== Aftermath ==

Captain Trent&#x27;s men marched to Washington&#x27;s camp at Wills Creek. They were mostly Indian traders and Trent&#x27;s employees, but still considered themselves militia and therefore not under Washington&#x27;s command. Washington ordered them to wait for the Governor&#x27;s instructions, but the men ignored this and disbanded. 

Tanacharison wrote immediately to Washington, stating that he was &quot;ready to fight them as you are yourselves...if you do not come to our aid soon, it is all over with us, and I think that we shall never be able to meet together again.&quot; Washington regarded the capture of Trent&#x27;s Fort as an act of war, and prepared to advance, writing on April 20 to Governor Dinwiddie to request artillery. Counting on Tanacharison to support him with Native American warriors, he prepared to attack French troops in what would become the first battle of the French and Indian War, the Battle of Jumonville Glen.

On May 1, Governor Dinwiddie, unaware that the fort had been captured, wrote to Governor Horatio Sharpe of Maryland that &quot;The Plan of the Fort is not yet Drawn, as the Ground is not fix&#x27;d on being left with discretional Power to the Engineer.&quot; When Ensign Ward returned from Williamsburg, he brought letters dated May 4, expressing anger with Trent and Fraser to Colonel Joshua Fry: &quot;I am advis’d that Capt. Trent, and his Lieut., Fraser have been long absent from their duty...Which Conduct &amp; Behaviour I require &amp; expect You will enquire into at a Court Martial, &amp; give Sentence accordingly.&quot; Lieutenant Fraser was almost court-martialed at Williamsburg for desertion, but he was released after Washington reminded Governor Dinwiddie that Fraser had accepted his lieutenant&#x27;s commission with reservations. He later served as Chief of Scouts in General Edward Braddock&#x27;s army, Adjutant of Virginia Forces, and Captain of guides in the army of Brigadier-General John Forbes.

The French erected Fort Duquesne after seizing Fort Prince George, and maintained control of traffic on the Ohio River until November, 1758. This had a devastating impact on British trade with Native Americans in the Ohio Country, leading many to side with the French at the beginning of the French and Indian War.

Fort Prince George was the first of five forts to be built to control the strategic &quot;Forks of the Ohio&quot;. Following the capture of Fort Duquesne in the 1758 Forbes Expedition, the British built Fort Pitt. Mercer&#x27;s Fort was a temporary British fort built to defend against a French counterattack while Fort Pitt was being constructed. The final fort in what is now downtown Pittsburgh was an American post called Fort Lafayette, built in 1792 and located farther up the Allegheny River.

== Memorialization ==

A historical marker commemorating Fort Prince George was placed in Point State Park in downtown Pittsburgh on May 8, 1959. A diorama depicting the fort&#x27;s surrender to the French can be seen at the Fort Pitt Museum in Pittsburgh.

<text>Palm is a now discontinued line of personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobile phones developed by California-based Palm, Inc., originally called Palm Computing, Inc. Palm devices are often remembered as &quot;the first wildly popular handheld computers,&quot; responsible for ushering in the smartphone era.

The first Palm device, the PalmPilot 1000, was released in 1996 and proved to be popular. It led a growing market for portable computing devices where previous attempts such as Apple&#x27;s Newton failed or others like Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s 200LX only serving a niche target market.

Most of Palm&#x27;s PDAs and mobile phones ran the in-house Palm OS software, which was later also licensed to other OEMs. A few devices ran on Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Mobile. In 2009 Palm OS&#x27;s successor webOS was released, first shipping with the Palm Pre. In 2011 Hewlett-Packard discontinued the Palm brand and started releasing new devices under the HP brand, but discontinued its hardware later that same year.

In 2018, a start-up backed by TCL Corporation (owner of the Palm brand) released a new device simply called Palm, although in essence it bears no relation to the original Palm devices.

== History ==
===Initial development===

Pilot was the name of the first generation of personal digital assistants manufactured by Palm Computing in 1996 (by then a division of U.S. Robotics).

The inventors of the Pilot were Jeff Hawkins, Donna Dubinsky, and Ed Colligan, who founded Palm Computing in 1992. The original purpose of this company was to create handwriting recognition software, named PalmPrint, and personal information management (PIM) software, named PalmOrganizer for the PEN/GEOS based Zoomer devices. Their research convinced them, however, they could create better hardware as well. Before starting development of the Pilot, Hawkins said he carried a block of wood, the size of the potential Pilot, in his pocket for a week. Palm was widely perceived to have benefited from the notable, if ill-fated, earlier attempts to create a popular handheld computing platform by Go Corporation, Tandy, and Apple Computer (Newton).

=== PalmPilot1000 and 5000 (1996) ===
The prototype for the first Palm Connected Organizer was called &quot;Palm Taxi&quot;. In 1996 Palm released its first generation PDA, the PalmPilot 1000 and 5000. After the out-of-court settlement in 1998 of a trademark infringement lawsuit brought by the Pilot Pen Corporation, the company no longer used that name, instead referring to its handheld devices as Palm Connected Organizers or more commonly as &quot;Palms&quot;.

The first Palms, the Pilot 1000 and Pilot 5000, had no infrared port, backlight, or flash memory, but did have a serial communications port. Their RAM size was 128 kB and 512 kB respectively, and they used version 1 of Palm OS. Later, it became possible to upgrade the Pilot 1000 or 5000&#x27;s internals to up to 1 MB of internal RAM. This was done with the purchase of an upgrade module sold by Palm, and the replacement of some internal hardware components. Originally, it was conceived that all Palm PDAs were to be hardware-upgradable to an extent, but ultimately, this capability gave way to external memory slots and firmware-upgradable flash memory after the Palm III series.

=== Subsequent generations (1998-2000) ===

The next couple of Palms, the PalmPilot Personal and PalmPilot Professional, had backlit screens, but no infrared port or flash memory. Their RAM size was 512 kB and 1024 kB respectively. They used version 2 of the Palm OS.

Palm III, and all the following Palms, did not have the word &quot;Pilot&quot; in their name due to the previously mentioned trademark dispute. The Palm III had an IR port, backlight, and flash memory. The latter allowed the user to upgrade Palm OS, or, with some external applications, to store programs or data in flash memory. It ran on two standard AAA batteries. It was able to retain enough energy for 10–15 minutes to prevent data loss during battery replacement. It had 2 megabytes of memory, large at the time, and used Palm OS 3. (Palm also produced an upgrade card for the Pilot series, which made them functionally equivalent to a Palm III.)

Meanwhile, with Palm Computing now a subsidiary of 3Com, the founders felt they had insufficient control over the development of the Palm product. As a result, they left 3Com and founded Handspring in June 1998. When they left Palm, Hawkins secured a license for the Palm OS for Handspring, and the company became the first Palm OS licensee. Handspring went on to produce the Handspring Visor, a clone of the Palm handhelds that included a hardware expansion slot (early Palm devices also had a hardware expansion slot, however this was for device upgrade purposes, not peripherals) and used slightly modified software.

The next versions of Palm used Palm OS 3.1. These included Palm IIIx with 4 Megabytes of memory, Palm IIIe without flash memory or hardware expansion slot (and available for lower price), Palm V with 2 Megabytes of memory, and, Palm Vx with 8 Megabytes of memory.

Palm VII had wireless connection to some Internet services, but this connection worked only within the United States. It used Palm OS 3.2.

Palm IIIc was the first Palm handheld with a color screen. It used Palm OS 3.5, which provided extensive tools for writing color applications. Some of these newer handhelds, for example Palm V, used internal rechargeable batteries. Later, this feature became standard for all Palms.

Palm handhelds up to 2002 contained Motorola DragonBall processors, part of the Motorola 68000 family. Starting with the Palm Tungsten, the platform transitioned to the ARM architecture with Texas Instruments, Samsung, and Intel as suppliers. As ARM had previously been used in the Apple Newton series, the platform had significant investment in mobile and low-power applications.

===Tungsten, Treo and others (2000-2009)===

By 2000, Palm had some 74 percent market share, however it was now losing relevance following the launch of Microsoft&#x27;s Pocket PC platform. In 2001 it was losing ground to Pocket PCs such as Compaq&#x27;s iPAQ (which all ran on ARM processors) but also to Handspring devices.

Palm Computing was spun off into its own company (called Palm Incorporated) in 2000. Handspring later merged with Palm to form palmOne in 2003 when Palm Inc. split into companies based upon selling hardware (palmOne) and the software (PalmSource). In 2005, palmOne acquired the full rights to the Palm name by purchasing the shared rights PalmSource owned and changed names back to Palm again. PalmSource was acquired by ACCESS Systems in 2005, which subsequently sold the Palm OS source code back to Palm, Inc. in December 2006.

Palm handhelds continued to advance, including the ability to access computer hard drives via USB cables, and began to merge with smartphones. The &quot;Treo 700w&quot; was one of the later offerings that combined a Palm handheld with mobile phone, e-mail, MMS, and instant messaging (SMS) technology. It was also the first Palm-branded device to use Microsoft software (Windows Mobile) instead of its own Palm OS. It became widely expected that Palm handhelds as a PDA-only device would disappear as multifunction handhelds like the Treo 650 declined in price. Multifunction handhelds generally include a wider range of abilities traditionally found in separate devices, for example: an MP3 player, mobile phone, camera, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The Treo 650+ was a series of smartphones that included a camera, mp3 player, Bluetooth, and a mobile phone. The Zire 71 and 72 series also had these additional features. In 2007, Palm released the Palm Centro, a smartphone running Palm OS. Different in overall appearance from the Treo, it was most notably thinner. The Centro was a somewhat successful smartphone, combining many features with a decreased price. Palm later released the Palm Treo 500v, a device similar to the Centro, which ran Windows Mobile 6.0.

===webOS and discontinuation of Palm (2009-2011)===

Palm&#x27;s focus following the Zire and Tungsten PDA lines shifted exclusively to smartphones, where the Palm OS operating system as used on the Treos was becoming dated with both the Palm OS and the Window Mobile versions making minor impact in market share when compared to those of RIM (BlackBerry) and Apple (iPhone). In order to try to change this trend, Palm had been working on a new web-based operating system (webOS), which was an embedded Linux operating system that hosts a custom user interface built on standard web browser technology and offered genuine multi-tasking capabilities through a card based concept where each application ran as a card and the use of gestures to navigate between cards and perform actions. This platform won much respect from its peers (including praise from Steve Jobs the cofounder of Apple) but was compromised by some of the shortcuts taken in the hardware for the initial webOS, and indeed Palm&#x27;s final device offerings, the Palm Pre, and Palm Pixi.

Palm released improved versions of both the Pre and Pixi as the Pre Plus and Pixi Plus, which contained improved memory capacity or processor updates but did not significantly address some of the limitations of the hardware (e.g. the screen, and CPU) in comparison to other smartphones on the market at the time.

With the acquisition of Palm by HP, the next device to market was the Pre2, which did address the screen and processor issues. This was followed in 2011 by the HP Veer and the HP Pre3, the former being a compact design (the world&#x27;s smallest smartphone not much bigger than a credit card on release) and the latter showing the hardware potential to compete in the demanding smartphone market, that had expanded to include Google&#x27;s Android, before Leo Apotheker, then HP CEO, abruptly pulled the plug on webOS in August 2011, which caused a dip in HP share value. Apotheker was ousted from Hewlett-Packard later in the year, due in part to criticisms behind his handling of webOS. His successor, Meg Whitman, reaffirmed HP&#x27;s decision to discontinue the sale and production of webOS hardware devices; Palm&#x27;s legacy was later maintained by Whitman&#x27;s decision to support webOS on the software side by taking steps toward open-sourcing webOS and opening it to hardware partners.

===After 2011===
In January 2015, TCL Corporation announced that it had acquired the rights to the Palm, but not Palm OS. A new Palm device was unveiled in 2018. Functionally a cross between a smartphone and a wearable, the Android-based device is designed to serve as a smaller, simplified companion to a larger smartphone. All new Palm-branded products are designed by a San Francisco startup company backed by its spokesman, TCL and NBA star Stephen Curry. Palm is categorized an &quot;ultra-mobile&quot; and is about the size of credit card (1.99&quot; x 3.80&quot; x 0.29&quot;). It weighs about 2.5 ounces. The new device was announced as being exclusive to Verizon Wireless, only available as an add-on to an existing device plan. It was later updated to allow use as a standalone device.

<doc id="88947" wikidata="Q468776" url="?curid=88947" title="Charango">
<text>The charango is a small Andean stringed instrument of the lute family, from the Quechua and Aymara populations in the territory of the Altiplano in post-Colonial times, after European stringed instruments were introduced by the Spanish during colonization. The instrument is widespread throughout the Andean regions of Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, northern Chile and northwestern Argentina, where it is a popular musical instrument that exists in many variant forms.

About long, the charango was traditionally made with the shell from the back of an armadillo (called &quot;quirquincho&quot; or &quot;mulita&quot; in South American Spanish), but it can also be made of wood, which some believe to be a better resonator. Wood is more commonly used in modern instruments. Charangos for children may also be made from calabash. Many contemporary charangos are now made with different types of wood. It typically has ten strings in five courses of two strings each, but many other variations exist.

The charango was primarily played in traditional Andean music. A charango player is called a &quot;charanguista&quot;.

==History==

When the Spanish conquistadors came to South America, they brought the vihuela (an ancestor of the classical guitar) with them. It is not clear whether the charango is a direct descendant of a particular Spanish stringed instrument; it may have evolved from the vihuela, bandurria (mandolin), or the lute. Ernesto Cavour, Bolivian charanguista, composer, and consulting music historian for many museums around the world, has noted characteristics of the charango in various vihuelas and guitars of the 16th century, and maintains the charango is the direct descendant of the vihuela.

There are many stories of how the charango came to be made with its distinctive diminutive soundbox of armadillo. One story says that the native musicians liked the sound the vihuela made, but lacked the technology to shape the wood in that manner. Another story says that the Spaniards prohibited natives from practicing their ancestral music, and that the charango was a successful attempt to make a lute that could be easily hidden under a garment such as a poncho.

There is no clear evidence that points to a specific location or moment in time for the birth of the charango but there are a number of theories being debated. One of those is that it is believed the charango came into its present form in the early 18th century in the city of Potosí in the Royal Audiencia of Charcas part of the Viceroyalty of Peru (in what is present-day Bolivia), probably from Amerindian contact with Spanish settlers. Cavour presents evidence from Bolivian murals and sculptures as early as 1744, in, for example, the Church of San Lorenzo of the city of Potos (Potosí), the facade of which depicts two mermaids playing what he believes to be charangos.

Another two theories that are being researched are that the Charango originally came to Potosí from the Ayacucho region in colonial Peru as a result of migration within the Quechua populations. This suggests that the charango originated in the territory of what is now Peru via cultural exchange and then spread to the rest of the Andean area. This theory has not been proven either.

Because the modern states of Peru and Bolivia had not yet been established at the time, it is difficult to trace the charango&#x27;s origin to a specific country, and the issue remains highly debated among nationalists from both countries.

One Bolivian musician has posited a third theory which is that the Charango was created as a variant of the timple canario from the Canary islands. More research however is required.

The first published historic information on the charango may be that gathered by Vega, going back to 1814, when a cleric from Tupiza documented that &quot;the Indians used with much enthusiasm the guitarrillos mui fuis... around here in the Andes of Bolivia they called them Charangos&quot;. Turino mentions that he found carved sirens representing playing charangos in some Colonial churches in the highlands of Bolivia. One of the churches to which Turino refers may well be that mentioned by Cavour; construction on the San Lorenzo edifice began in 1547 and wasn&#x27;t completed until 1744.

According to Eduardo Carrasco of Quilapayún, in the first week after the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;etat, the military organized a meeting with folk musicians where it was explained that the traditional instruments charango and quena were now banned.

===Etymology===
The origin of the term &quot;charango&quot; is not entirely clear. One source suggests that the instrument took its name from its players, who were called &quot;charangeros&quot;, meaning &quot;someone of questionable character and low morals&quot;. Another traces the term to the alteration of a Spanish term, &quot;charanga&quot;, which could refer to either a type of military music played on wind instruments, or an out-of-tune orchestra. Charanguista Alfredo Coca, offers yet a third theory: asserting that &quot;charango&quot; comes from a Spanish corruption of the Quechua word “Chajwaku”, which means joy, noisy, boisterous, referring directly to the sound of the charango. As support for this he points to the common practice of the Conquistadors appropriating local terminology.

Charanguista Ernesto Cavour disagrees, and tends to support the second origin, maintaining that the word “charango” comes from a mispronunciation of the Spanish word “charanga”, meaning &quot;brass band&quot; (a reasonable corollary to &#x27;military music played on wind instruments&#x27;).

One of the most complete contemporary statements on the origin of the term &quot;charango&quot; appears in the introduction to Duran and Pedrotti&#x27;s, &quot;Charango Method&quot;, ostensibly the first complete, bilingual charango method to be published:

:&quot;Charango&quot; in an Ibero-American colonial term that refers to a series of Spanish-American cultural concepts related to &quot;noise&quot; and rustically constructed objects. The term &quot;charanga&quot;, for example, was often used to refer to a small instrumental band. &quot;Charanguero&quot;, meanwhile, denoted something rough or rustic. In his book &quot;El charango, su vida, costumbres y desaventuras&quot;, Ernesto Cavour has collected a large amount of information regarding the etymology of the word &quot;charango&quot;. As this author related:
:::&quot;In the rural areas of Andean Bolivia, the instrument is not only known by the name &quot;charango&quot;, but by many others as well, including: mediana, guitarrilla, thalachi, quirqui, p&#x27;alta, khonkhota, aiquileno, guitarron, anzaldeno, etc. ...&quot;
:An Uruguan publication from 1823 uses the term &quot;changango&quot; as a synonym for the Argentine &quot;charango&quot;, and claims the same word was used during the eighteenth century to refer to old and poorly constructed guitars:
:::&quot;...In Argentina they speak of the Charango, a guitar with five doubled strings and a body made from the shell of an Armadillo. Nevertheless, the small Spanish-American guitar has been known by the name changango for more than one hundred years. In a footnote to his correspondence with Paulino Lucero regarding the Great War, Hilario Ascasubi explains this situation with indisputable clarity: &quot;Changango: an old, poorly made guitar&quot;.
:::(Excerpt from the newspaper &quot;El Domador&quot;, Montecivideo, 19 March 1823).
:Julio Mendivil engages in a similarly detailed discussion of this issue in his article &quot;La construccion de la historia: el charango en la memoria colectiva mestiza ayacuchana&quot;, Musicology Institut/University of Colonia.&quot;

==Construction==

Traditionally a charango was made with a dried armadillo shell for the back and wood for the soundbox top, neck etc. While still common, this is no longer the norm: rather they are now typically made of wood, with the bowled back merely imitating the shape of the armadillo shell. Unlike most wooden lutes, the body and neck are typically made of a single block of wood, carved into shape. The charango&#x27;s ten strings require quite a large headstock, often approaching or even exceeding the size of its diminutive sound box. Aside from these visual distinctions, it resembles something between a bowl-backed mandolin and a small ukulele.

The overall length of a typical charango is about , with a string scale length of about . The number of frets ranges from five to eighteen. The most common form of the instrument has ten strings of nylon, gut, or (less commonly) metal. (Variant forms of the charango may have anywhere from four to fifteen strings, in various combinations of single, double, or triple courses.) The body generally has a narrowed &quot;waist&quot;, reminiscent of the guitar family, and not the pear-shape of the lute. There are many minor variations in the shape of the body and soundboard (top), and many different kinds of wood are used, although, like guitars, the preferred tone woods for the top come from the cedar or spruce families. Old instruments had friction-style tuning pegs (similar to those used on violins), but today a classical guitar style peghead with geared &quot;machine&quot; tuners is the norm, though these are occasionally positioned perpendicular to the headstock. Most instruments include some degree of ornamentation, which may range from simple purfling inlays around the perimeter of the top, to elaborately carved headstocks, and whole scenes engraved, carved, or burned into the back of the body. Strap buttons are sometimes added, as are position marker dots on the fingerboard.

Variations may include a separate glued-on neck, a two-piece top plate of contrasting woods, old-style friction tuning pegs in palisander or ebony, guitar-style box construction, or even a hollowed-out neck. The size, shape, and number of soundholes is highly variable and may be a single round or oval hole, dual crescents, or even multiple holes of varying arrangement. Another variant is a neck with two holes bored 3/4 of the way through, parallel to the fretboard and close to the headstock (an innovation said to color the instrument&#x27;s tone).

More recently solid-body electric and hollow-body acoustic-electric charangos have become available. The solid-body instruments are built very much as miniature electric guitars, whereas the acoustic-electrics are usually a standard acoustic charango with the addition of a contact microphone or piezoelectric pickup to run the output of the instrument through an amplifier.

In his book &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot;, Che Guevara described a charango he saw near Temuco, Chile, in 1952. It was &quot;made with three or four wires some two meters in length stretched tightly across tins fixed to a board. The musician uses a kind of metal knuckle duster with which he plucks the wires producing a sound like a toy guitar.&quot;

==Tuning==
The basic charango has five pairs (or courses) of strings, typically tuned GCEAE. This tuning, disregarding octaves, is similar to the typical C-tuning of the ukulele or the Venezuelan cuatro, with the addition of a second E-course. Unlike most other stringed instruments, all ten strings are tuned inside one octave. The five courses are pitched as follows (from 5th to 1st course): G4 G4 - C5 C5 - E5 E4 - A4 A4 -E5 E5. Some &quot;charanguistas&quot; use &quot;octave&quot; strings on other pairs in addition to the middle course. Note that the lowest pitch is the &quot;E&quot; string in the middle (3rd) course, preceded by the higher pitched &quot;g&quot; (5th) course and &quot;c&quot; (4th) course, and followed by still higher pitched &quot;a&quot; (2nd) course and &quot;e&quot; (1st) courses. This tuning pattern is known as a re-entrant pattern because the pitches of the strings do not rise steadily from one string or course to the next, but progress from high to low and then back to high pitch again.

The ramifications of the charango tuning are that there is a very narrow tonal range in most chords, often with many pitch duplications, which produces a surprisingly powerful sound from the small instrument. Seventh and ninth chords shimmer more than on a guitar due to the close harmonies. In terms of melody playing, the &quot;charanguista&quot; can create a harp-like sound with close intervals ringing out (i.e., like a piano with the sustain pedal engaged). With the close pitch spacing across strings (intervals like 2nds), a simple alternating finger-style pattern in the right hand can produce very rapid chromatic and diatonic runs with only minimal movement of the left hand on the fingerboard. This makes the charango an extremely agile melodic instrument, especially when compared to instruments traditionally played with a flat pick.

As with any stringed instrument, tunings for the charango may vary, but the &quot;standardized&quot; tunings most commonly used (for the 10-stringed, five-course version) are:

G#m7 and Gm7 tunings are achieved by tuning a semitone or a full step down, respectively. Em7 is achieved by tuning down by a perfect fourth.

==Types==
There are metal string, nylon/gut string, and mixed-string charangos. Some metal-stringed versions have all strings at the same gauge. There are also solid-body electric charangos.

There are many types of charango. In many cases the variant is named for the town or region in which it originated, or in which it is most frequently seen, &quot;e.g.&quot;, the &quot;Charango Ayquileño&quot; of Ayquile, Bolivia. The number of strings on these variant instruments ranges from four to 20, and courses may be single, double, triple, or quadruple strung. (The standard charango has 10 strings in five courses of two strings each.)

Some types of charango are:

* Walaycho (also &quot;hualaycho&quot;, &quot;maulincho&quot;, or &quot; kalampiador&quot;): a smaller relative, with a scale typically around long. It has ten strings, which may be of metal, nylon, or nylon fishing line, arranged in five courses of two strings each. Despite the short scale, the headstock must still accommodate ten tuners, which increases the total length of the instrument by nearly a third — ca. is typical. Usually tuned a &quot;fifth higher&quot; (sometimes a fourth higher) than the charango, strings in the third (center) course may be either in unison or in octaves.
* Charangón: (also &quot;charangone&quot;) a larger relative, in effect, a tenor charango. About long by wide with a scale. It was invented by Mauro Nuñez. Tunings vary, with the most common being a &quot;fourth lower&quot; than the charango (Argentine tuning) or a &quot;fifth lower&quot; (Bolivian tuning). It is occasionally tuned an octave lower than the charango, but such lower pitches are more usually reserved for the ronroco.
* Ronroco (also &quot;ronrroco&quot;): a still larger relative, essentially a baritone or bass charango, about long with a scale. It is a charangón named Ronroco by Gonzalo Hermosa, of the group Los Kjarkas from Cochabamba, Bolivia, in the 1980s. Ten nylon strings are arranged in five double courses. As with the &quot;charangón&quot; tunings vary, and depending on region and use the ronroco may be tuned a &quot;fourth lower&quot; than the charango (Argentine tuning); a &quot;fifth lower&quot; (Bolivia; Chile); or an octave lower (&quot;Bolivian tuning&quot;). The octave lower tuning is better acoustically supported by the larger body of the ronroco, and is more common on this instrument than on the charangón. The strings of the third (center) course are tuned an octave apart; strings in the other courses are usually tuned in unisons, though occasionally the fourth or fifth courses (or both) may be tuned in octaves. When courses four and five are doubled at the &quot;lower&quot; octave the ronroco is essentially no longer in reentrant tuning.
* Chillador: The name chillador can refer either to two related types of charango. The first is a standardly-tuned charango but with a body built from bent sides and a flat back like a (smaller) guitar, The second is a type that has a flat back and is usually steel-strung. It exists in both 10- and 12-string forms. When strung with ten strings in five courses it is tuned the same as a charango. With 12 strings, courses two and four are triple-strung, and the (re-entrant) tuning is more like that of a charangone or ronroco in Argentine tuning.
* The Hatun Charango or &quot;grand charango&quot; is an extended-range charango developed in Peru in the modern era. It has either seven or eight strings, all set in single string courses except for the third course, which is double-strung. It is tuned (A3) • D4 • G4 • C5 • E5 E4 • A4 • E5

Other, less common members of the charango family include:
* Ayacucho: A small guitar-style charango (flat back) usually made of plywood, with six strings in five courses, strung 1-1-2-1-1. Smaller than the charango, but not as small as the walyacho, it is tuned like the charango, with the strings of the doubled course in octaves.
* Bajo charango: A large bass instrument, more guitar-like than charango-like, it was invented by luthier Mauro Nunez in the region of Cochabamba. It is about long, with a scale of , and the large resonating body is usually made of plywood. Six strings in five courses (1-1-2-1-1-) are typically tuned: B • E • B • G • D, with the third (center) course in octaves. It sounds two octaves lower than the charango, and is written as a transposing instrument, with parts notated a 4th higher than they actually sound.
* Charango mediano or &quot;mediana&quot; (&quot;medium&quot; charango): a rural instrument that varies widely in size: from , with scales ranging from . It has ten strings in five courses, and is usually tuned an octave below the charango.
* Khonkhota (also &quot;jitarron&quot; or &quot;pomputu&quot;): A rustic instrument of the rural regions of Cochabamba, Oruro, and Potosí. Its soundbox is made of plywood, and it has only five frets. The total length is , with a scale. It has eight strings in five courses (2-2-1-1-2); the doubled courses are all unison doublings. Tunings vary, with a common choice being E-A-D-B-C.
* Moquegua: Charango with 20 strings arranged in five courses of four strings each. Tuning is like the standard charango with the third (central) course using octave doublings.
* Pampeno (also &quot;Arequipeño&quot;): Another rustic, guitar-style, plywood charango used in the Arequipa region of Peru. It&#x27;s 15 metal strings, triple strung in Five courses, are tuned: C# - F# - C# - A - E, with the third (middle) course in octaves.
* Shrieker: An instrument from the South of the Peru similar to the walaycho, made of wood or armadillo. Typically less than long, it differs from the walaycho in having 12 strings, usually metal, in five courses; the second and fourth courses are triple-strung. Tuning is the same as for the walyacho.
* Sonko: A large heart-shaped instrument with 13 (and sometimes more) strings. It is a fairly recent development, first designed in the 1970s, by Gerardo Yañez. It has not yet acquired a standard tuning.
* Vallegrandino: Named for the town of its origin, Vallegrande, Bolivia, this charango is about long, with a scale of , and has six strings in four courses: 1 - 2 -2 -1. Tuning is A-E-C-G.

As one of the most popular stringed instruments in regions along the Andes, countless other regional variations of the charango exist, for example:
Several hybrids of charango with other instruments have also been made, for example: &quot;charanquena&quot; (charango and quena); &quot;charansicu&quot; (charango and zampoña); and &quot;charango charanguita&quot; (charango and guitar).

==Names==
The charango is known by different names in various regions of the Andes. A few include:
*&quot;Mulita&quot; y &quot;tatu&quot; (in Argentina)
*&quot;Kirkinchu&quot; (sometimes &quot;quirquinchu&quot;) and &quot;kirki&quot; (in Bolivia and Peru)
*&quot;Quinquela&quot; (in Bolivia)

There are also many dialect variants of these terms.

<text>Vendée () is a department in the Pays de la Loire region in Western France, on the Atlantic coast. In 2019, it had a population of 685,442. Its prefecture is La Roche-sur-Yon.

==History==
The area today called the Vendée was originally known as the &quot;Bas-Poitou&quot; and is part of the former province of Poitou.

In the southeast corner, the village of Nieul-sur-l&#x27;Autise is believed to be the birthplace of Eleanor of Aquitaine (1122–1204). Eleanor&#x27;s son, Richard the Lionheart often had his base in Talmont. The Hundred Years&#x27; War (1337–1453) turned much of the Vendée into a battleground.

Since the Vendée held a considerable number of influential Protestants, including control by Jeanne d&#x27;Albret mother of Henry IV of France, the region was greatly affected by the French Wars of Religion which broke out in 1562 and continued until 1598. In April of that year King Henri IV issued the Edict of Nantes and the Wars came to an end. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 caused many Huguenots to flee from the Vendée. In the void, the region became rigorously Catholic due to the influence of a preacher and Marian missionary Louis de Montfort who radically changed the spirituality of the region. Many attribute the effect of his preaching to prepare the Vendeans for their revolt against the French Revolution.

The Vendeans revolted against the Revolutionary government in 1793. They resented the harsh oppression imposed on the Catholic Church by the provisions of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy act (1790) and broke into open revolt after the Revolutionary government&#x27;s imposition of military conscription. A massacre of Republicans at Machecoul in March was followed by guerrilla warfare, led at the outset by peasants who were chosen in each locale, and cost more than 240,000 lives before it ended in 1796 (190,000 Vendeans who were republicans or royalists and 50,000 non-Vendean republican soldiers; according to the Jacques Hussenet and Centre Vendéen de Recherche Historique&#x27;s book &quot;Détruisez la Vendée&quot;). 

The Revolt in the Vendée must not be confused with the revolt of the Chouans, which took place at the same time in Maine and Brittany. The revolt was led by able officers, mostly aristocrats with some commoners. England provided funds and weapons but various plans for military support were thwarted or cancelled, such as the ill-fated 1795 Quiberon Expedition. In 1804, Napoleon I chose La Roche-sur-Yon to be the capital of the department. At the time, most of La Roche had been eradicated in the Vendée Revolt (1793–96); the renamed Napoléonville was laid out and a fresh population of soldiers and civil servants was brought in. Napoléonville had a square-grid street network and was designed to accommodate 15,000 people.

In 1815, when Napoleon escaped exile on Elba for his Hundred Days, the Vendée refused to recognise him and stayed loyal to King Louis XVIII. General Lamarque led 10,000 men into the Vendée to pacify the region. A failed rebellion in the Vendée in 1832 in support of Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile, duchess de Berry, the former King Charles X&#x27;s widowed daughter-in-law, was an unsuccessful attempt to restore the Legitimist Bourbon dynasty during the reign of the Orléanist monarch, King Louis Philippe of the French (1830–1848).

In 1850, English author Anthony Trollope published his book &quot;La Vendée&quot;, detailing the history of the region and the war. In the preface he pays tribute to Madame de la Rochejaquelein, on whose memoirs of the war he based his story.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Vendée&quot; is taken from the river Vendée which runs through the southeastern part of the department. The river is attested as &quot;Fluvium Vendre&quot; in the 10th century, and as &quot;Flumen Vendee&quot; and &quot;Vendeia&quot; by the 11th century. According to Pierre-Henri Billy, the name ultimately derives from the Celtic toponym &quot;*vindo-&quot; meaning white or brilliant in a sacred context (as in the Modern Welsh &quot;gwyn/wyn&quot;). The name likely originates in Proto-Celtic or Gaulish, but may also have originated in the Gallo or Old Breton languages.

==Geography==
Vendée&#x27;s highest point is Puy-Crapaud (295 m).

The department is crossed by four rivers: the Sèvre Nantaise ( long), the Vendée (), the Lay () and the Sèvre Niortaise ().

==Demographics==

Vendée&#x27;s inhabitants are referred to as &quot;Vendeans&quot; (French &quot;Vendéens&quot; ).
===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is La Roche-sur-Yon, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 7 communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants. The 10 most populous communes are:

==Higher education==

The main University of this department is the Catholic Institute of Higher Studies - ICES in La Roche-sur-Yon. The main goal of this institute is to achieve academic excellence through an enhancement of the Christian and human dimension in seven areas of study. Founded in 1989, Catholic Institute of Higher Studies - ICES has pioneered a new concept in higher education, that of the &quot;University School&quot;: halfway between the French Grande École and the traditional state university.

==Economy==
The primary factors of the Vendéen economy are:

*Tourism
*Agriculture
*Food Processing
*Light/Medium Industry

The Vendée has been cited as the most economically dynamic department in France by L&#x27;Express magazine in a 2006 survey. Its economy is characterised by a low rate of unemployment (around 7% in late 2006 compared to more than 9% nationally) and a very high proportion of small and medium-sized businesses (one business for every 14 inhabitants).

===Tourism===

The coast of the Vendée extends over of mostly sandy beaches. Tourists from overseas and locally frequent them. Some resorts include Les Sables-d&#x27;Olonne, La Tranche-sur-Mer and Saint-Jean-de-Monts. Some beaches are certified for the FEE Blue Flag for cleanliness.

With more than of sandy beaches edged with dunes and pine woods. There are several nude beaches including just south of La Faute sur Mer on the Pointe d&#x27;Arçay. The department also has churches and abbeys, museums, and—for nature lovers—thousands of marked footpaths, a signposted bicycle route running along the coastal mudflats, and marshes that attract unusual birds. There is fishing in the Vendée&#x27;s rivers and lakes.

Inland, the chief attractions include the Marais Poitevin (an area of marshlands famed for wildlife), the forested area around the village of Mervent and the rolling countryside of the Bocage. In the north of the department, the historical theme park Puy du Fou attracts more than 1.45 million of visitors per year.
===Agriculture===

Agriculture remains a significant source of employment in the Vendée. Among departments, it has the second highest level of revenue from agriculture in France. The major arable crops grown are maize, colza, wheat and sunflowers. Meat and dairy production also feature, as does the offshore farming of shellfish (oysters and mussels). Poultry from Challans is highly regarded nationwide as is lamb produced from the salt marshes in the North of the Vendée.

Demonstrating its support for the agricultural sector, the Conseil Général of the Vendée has a stated policy to promote the construction of irrigation reservoirs to reduce dependence on ground water during key summer growing seasons.

===Food processing and manufacturing===

The Vendée is home to a number of food processing firms. A manufacturer of ready-meals and charcuterie employs the majority of its workforce (some 3000 people) at local plants. Other employers include bakeries and biscuit producers.

The department also has some speciality products, including brioche (&quot;Label Rouge&quot;) and a raw cured ham (&quot;Jambon de Vendée&quot;) similar in flavour to bacon.

Wine is also produced in the area around the communes of Vix, Brem, Pissotte and Mareuil-sur-Lay, and is marketed under the &quot;Fiefs Vendéens&quot; designation. Production quality has improved markedly over recent years, and, having already achieved the classification Vin Délimité de Qualité Supérieure (VDQS), the wines are on their way towards A.O.C status (Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée).

===Industry===

Much of the manufacturing industry in the Vendée reflects its status as a major tourist destination. Mobile homes are manufactured at plants in Luçon and the building of motor and sail yachts takes place at locations all over the department. The service sector too is strongly inclined towards tourism with campsites, restaurants and other tourism businesses being important sources of revenue and employment.

== Culture ==
The War in the Vendée is the subject of &quot;Ninety-Three&quot; (&quot;Quatrevingt-treize&quot;), the last novel by the French writer Victor Hugo, an episode in &quot;Mr. Midshipman Hornblower&quot; and also the backdrop of &quot;Les Chouans&quot; by Balzac.

In the writings of Karl Marx regarding revolutionary struggles in various countries, he uses the term &quot;a Vendée&quot; as meaning &quot;a focus of persistent counter-revolutionary activities&quot;. Vladimir Lenin, when speaking about Cossacks as potential counter-revolutionary opposition, identified them as &quot;Russian Vendée&quot;.

===Cuisine===

*&quot;Jambon-mogettes&quot; (ham and white beans) is the most famous Vendean dish.
*The department is the largest brioche producer in France, with the &quot;Brioche de Vendée&quot; made in the Bocage.
*In the Plain of Luçon, préfou is a garlic bread that can be served as an aperitif.
*In the marshland of the North-West, the &quot;poultry of Challans&quot;, especially duck, is well known in the gastronomic world.
*The department has several small vineyards, around Brem-sur-Mer, Mareuil-sur-Lay-Dissais, Vix, and Pissotte.

==Government==

In the Vendée, 31 members, elected through universal suffrage, govern the affairs of the department, with 26 members on the right-wing and 5 members on the left-wing.

The Prefect represents the French State in the department.

==Politics==
The president of the Departmental Council is Alain Lebœuf, elected in July 2021. Previous Presidents were Bruno Retailleau and Philippe de Villiers.

<doc id="88961" wikidata="Q170348" url="?curid=88961" title="Paul Wittgenstein">
<text>Paul Wittgenstein (November 5, 1887March 3, 1961) was an Austrian-American concert pianist notable for commissioning new piano concerti for the left hand alone, after his right arm was amputated during World War I. He devised novel techniques, including pedal and hand-movement combinations, that allowed him to play chords previously thought impossible for a five-fingered pianist.

He was an older brother of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.

==Early life==
Wittgenstein was born in Vienna, the fourth son and seventh of the eight children (excluding a daughter who died at birth) of industrialist Karl Wittgenstein and Leopoldine Maria Josefa Kalmus. He was raised as a Catholic; three of his grandparents had converted from Judaism as adults. Only his paternal grandmother had no Jewish lineage. His brother Ludwig was born two years later. The household was frequently visited by prominent cultural figures, among them the composers Johannes Brahms, Gustav Mahler, Josef Labor, and Richard Strauss, with whom the young Paul played duets. His grandmother, Fanny Wittgenstein, was a first cousin of the violinist Joseph Joachim, whom she adopted and took to Leipzig to study with Felix Mendelssohn.

Wittgenstein studied with Malvine Brée and later with the Polish virtuoso Theodor Leschetizky. He made his public début in 1913, attracting favorable reviews. The next year, World War I broke out, and he was called up for military service. He was shot in the elbow and captured by the Russians during the Battle of Galicia, and his right arm had to be amputated.

==New career as a left-handed pianist==

During his recovery in a prisoner-of-war camp in Omsk in Siberia, Wittgenstein resolved to continue his career using only his left hand. Through the Danish Ambassador, he wrote to his old teacher Josef Labor, who was blind, asking for a concerto for the left hand. Labor responded quickly, saying he had already started work on a piece. After the war, Wittgenstein studied intensely, arranging pieces for the left hand alone and learning Labor&#x27;s new composition. He began to perform again. Many reviews were qualified with comments that he played very well for a man with one arm, but he persevered.

He then approached more famous composers, asking them to write material for him to perform. Benjamin Britten, Paul Hindemith, Alexandre Tansman, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Sergei Prokofiev, Karl Weigl, Franz Schmidt, Sergei Bortkiewicz, and Richard Strauss all produced pieces for him. Maurice Ravel wrote his Piano Concerto for the Left Hand, which became more famous than any of the other compositions Wittgenstein inspired. But when Wittgenstein made changes to the score for the première, Ravel was incensed, and the two never reconciled.

Wittgenstein did not perform every piece he commissioned. He told Prokofiev that he did not understand his 4th Piano Concerto but would someday play it; he never did. He later said, &quot;Even a concerto Prokofiev has written for me I have not yet played because the inner logic of the work is not clear to me, and, of course I can&#x27;t play it until it is.&quot; He rejected outright Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Piano Music with Orchestra&quot; Op. 29; he hid the score in his study, and it was not discovered until after his widow&#x27;s death in 2002 (by which time Hindemith had been dead for 39 years). He could take this approach because he inserted into his contracts with composers the stipulation that he held the unique performing rights on a composition during his lifetime. As he told Siegfried Rapp on June 5, 1950:

(Rapp premiered Prokofiev&#x27;s 4th Piano Concerto in 1956, five years before Wittgenstein&#x27;s death.)

Many of the pieces Wittgenstein commissioned are still performed today by two-armed pianists; in particular, the Austrian pianist Friedrich Wührer, claiming the composer&#x27;s sanction but apparently over Wittgenstein&#x27;s objections, created two-hand arrangements of Schmidt&#x27;s Wittgenstein-inspired left-hand works. Pianists born after Wittgenstein who lost the use of their right hands, such as Leon Fleisher (although he eventually recovered his right hand&#x27;s abilities) and João Carlos Martins, also played works composed for him.

Wittgenstein&#x27;s posthumous reputation is mixed. In &quot;The House of Wittgenstein: A Family at War&quot;, Alexander Waugh writes that between 1928 and 1934, Wittgenstein was &quot;a world-class pianist of outstanding technical ability and sensitivity&quot; but that his playing grew increasingly &quot;harsh and ham-fisted&quot;. Orchestras and conductors that had invited him once seldom sought to rebook him. His tendency to alter and rewrite, without authorization, the works he commissioned has also contributed to his controversial status.

== Nazi persecution and emigration ==
The Wittgenstein family converted to Christianity three generations before Paul&#x27;s birth on the paternal side and two generations before on the maternal side, but they were of mainly Jewish descent, and under the Nuremberg laws they were classed as Jews. After the rise of the Nazi Party and the annexation of Austria, Paul tried to persuade his sisters Hermine and Helene (aged 69 and 64 at the time) to leave Vienna, but they demurred: they were attached to their homes there, and could not believe such a distinguished family as theirs was in real danger. Ludwig had already been living in England for some years, and Margaret (Gretl) was married to an American. Paul, who was no longer permitted to perform in public under the Nazis, moved to the U.S. in 1938. From there, he and Gretl, with some assistance from Ludwig (who acquired British nationality in 1939), managed to use family finances (mostly held abroad) and legal connections to attain non-Jewish status for their sisters.

The family&#x27;s financial portfolio consisted of properties and other assets in Germany and occupied lands with a total value of about $6 billion, possibly the largest private fortune in Europe. Essentially all family assets were surrendered to the Nazis in return for protection afforded the two sisters under exceptional interpretations of racial laws, allowing them to continue to live in their family palace in Vienna.

==Personal life==
Wittgenstein&#x27;s wife, Hilde, had been his pupil; they had two children before their marriage, the first conceived after the first piano lesson, when Hilde was 18 and Paul 47. Because Hilde was not Jewish, Paul was open to charges of &quot;racial defilement&quot;; in 1938 he fled to New York. In 1940, he spent seven months in Cuba, attempting to secure permanent visas for Hilde and himself, and they married in a Catholic ceremony in Havana on 20 August 1940. When his wife and children arrived in the U.S. in 1941, he set them up in a house on Long Island, which he visited at weekends from his apartment on Riverside Drive. Wittgenstein became a U.S. citizen in 1946 and spent the rest of his life in the U.S., where he did much teaching as well as playing. He died in New York City in 1961 and was buried on Long Island, but later disinterred and reburied in Pinegrove Cemetery, South Sterling, Pike County, Pennsylvania, where his widow had moved.

==Art collector==
Wittgenstein collected works by artists of the Vienna Secession, especially Gustav Klimt. He owned several works by Rudolf von Alt. He also had a large collection of music and musical instruments.

==In popular culture==
John Barchilon wrote a novel, &quot;The Crown Prince&quot;, based on Wittgenstein&#x27;s life.

An episode of the long-running American television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;Morale Victory&quot;, featured James Stephens as a drafted concert pianist with debilitating nerve damage in his right hand after being wounded in combat. Charles Winchester (David Ogden Stiers) provides him with the music for Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for the Left Hand&quot;, tells him Wittgenstein&#x27;s story, and encourages him not to abandon his musical gift.

Wittgenstein appears as a character in Derek Jarman&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;Wittgenstein&quot;, about his brother Ludwig.

Wittgenstein is referenced extensively in the latter half of Brian Evenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Last Days&quot;.

Wittgenstein&#x27;s life is the basis for the song &quot;Wittgenstein&#x27;s Arm&quot; on Neil Halstead&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Palindrome Hunches&quot;.

William Boyd&#x27;s short story &quot;Transfigured Night&quot; (found in the collections &quot;The Dream Lover&quot; and &quot;The Destiny of Natalie &#x27;X&quot;&#x27;) features Wittgenstein.

<doc id="88983" wikidata="Q250354" url="?curid=88983" title="Prune belly syndrome">
<text>Prune belly syndrome (PBS) is a rare, genetic birth defect affecting about 1 in 40,000 births. About 97% of those affected are male. Prune belly syndrome is a congenital disorder of the urinary system, characterized by a triad of symptoms. The syndrome is named for the mass of wrinkled skin that is often (but not always) present on the abdomen of those with the disorder.

==Signs and symptoms==
Prune-belly triad consists of signs such as:
* A partial or complete lack of abdominal wall muscles. There may be wrinkly folds of skin covering the abdomen.
* Cryptorchidism (undescended testicles) in males
* Urinary tract abnormality such as unusually large ureters, distended bladder, accumulation and backflow of urine from the bladder to the ureters and the kidneys (vesicoureteral reflux)

Other signs include:
* Frequent urinary tract infections due to the inability to properly expel urine
* Ventricular septal defect
* Malrotation of the gut
* Club foot 
* Later in life, a common symptom is post-ejaculatory discomfort. Most likely a bladder spasm, it lasts about two hours.
* Musculoskeletal abnormalities include pectus excavatum, scoliosis, and congenital joint dislocations including the hip. Diagnosis of prune belly syndrome necessitates a thorough orthopaedic evaluation because of the high prevalence of associated musculoskeletal abnormalities.
* Pulmonary hypoplasia, pneumonia, and atelectasis involving lung lobes

===Complications===
Prune belly syndrome can result in distention and enlargement of internal organs such as the bladder and intestines. Surgery is often required but will not return the organs to a normal size. Bladder reductions have shown that the bladder will again stretch to its previous size due to lack of muscle. Complications may also arise from enlarged/malformed kidneys, which may result in kidney failure and the child&#x27;s going on dialysis or requiring a kidney transplant. Many individuals with prune belly syndrome have good physical and mental health, despite all the concerns. With proper treatment, however, a longer, healthier life is possible.

==Diagnosis==
Prune belly syndrome can be diagnosed via ultrasound while a child is still in-utero. Urinary tract dilation, bladder outlet obstruction, distended bladder wall and an abnormally large abdominal cavity with deficient abdominal wall musculature are key indicators, as the abdomen swells with the pressure of accumulated urine.

In young children, frequent urinary tract infections often herald prune belly syndrome, as they are normally uncommon. If a problem is suspected, doctors can perform blood tests to check renal function. Another study that may suggest the syndrome is a voiding cystourethrogram.

PBS is far more common in males. Autosomal recessive inheritance has been suggested in some cases. A homozygous mutation in the muscarinic cholinergic receptor-3 gene (&quot;CHRM3&quot;) on chromosome 1q43 was reported in one family.

==Treatment==
The type of treatment, like that of most disorders, depends on the severity of the symptoms. One option is to perform a &quot;vesicostomy&quot;, which allows the bladder to drain through a small hole in the abdomen, thus helping to prevent urinary tract infections. Similarly, consistent self-catheterization, often several times per day, can be an effective approach to preventing infections. A more drastic procedure is a surgical &quot;remodeling&quot; of the abdominal wall and urinary tract. Boys often need to undergo an orchiopexy to move the testes to their proper place in the scrotum.

<doc id="88988" wikidata="Q468433" url="?curid=88988" title="Anosmia">
<text>Anosmia, also known as smell blindness, is the lack of ability to detect one or more smells. Anosmia may be temporary or permanent. It differs from hyposmia, which is a decreased sensitivity to some or all smells.

Anosmia can be categorized into acquired anosmia and congenital anosmia. Acquired anosmia develops later in life due to various causes, such as upper respiratory infections, head trauma, or neurodegenerative diseases. In contrast, congenital anosmia is present from birth and is typically caused by genetic factors or developmental abnormalities of the olfactory system. While acquired anosmia may have potential treatments depending on the underlying cause, such as medications or surgery, congenital anosmia currently has no known cure, and management focuses on safety precautions and coping strategies.

Anosmia can be due to a number of factors, including inflammation of the nasal mucosa, blockage of nasal passages, or destruction of temporal lobular tissue. Anosmia stemming from sinus inflammation is due to chronic mucosal changes in the lining of the paranasal sinus and in the middle and superior turbinates.

When anosmia is caused by inflammatory changes in the nasal passageways, it is treated simply by reducing inflammation. It can be caused by chronic meningitis and neurosyphilis that would increase intracranial pressure over a long period of time, and, in some cases, by ciliopathy, including ciliopathy due to primary ciliary dyskinesia.

The term derives from the Neo-Latin &quot;anosmia&quot;, based on Ancient Greek ἀν- (&quot;an&quot;-) + ὀσμή (&quot;osmḗ&quot; &#x27;smell&#x27;; another related term, hyperosmia, refers to an increased ability to smell). Some people may be anosmic for one particular odor, a condition known as &quot;specific anosmia&quot;. The absence of the sense of smell from birth is known as congenital anosmia.

In the United States, 3% of people aged over 40 are affected by anosmia.

Anosmia is a common symptom of COVID-19 and can persist as long COVID.

==Definition==
Anosmia is the inability to smell. It may be partial or total, and can be specific to certain smells. Reduced sensitivity to some or all smells is hyposmia.

==Signs and symptoms==
Anosmia can have a number of harmful effects. People with sudden onset anosmia may find food less appetizing, though congenital anosmics rarely complain about this, and none report a loss in weight. Loss of smell can also be dangerous because it hinders the detection of gas leaks, fire, and spoiled food. Misconceptions of anosmia as trivial can make it more difficult for a patient to receive the same types of medical aid as someone who has lost other senses, such as hearing or sight.

Many experience one sided loss of smell, often as a result of minor head trauma. This type of anosmia is normally only detected if both of the nostrils are tested separately. Using this method of testing each nostril separately will often show a reduced or even completely absent sense of smell in either one nostril or both, something which is often not revealed if both nostrils are simultaneously tested.

Losing an established and sentimental smell memory (e.g. the smell of grass, of the grandparents&#x27; attic, of a particular book, of loved ones, or of oneself) has been known to cause feelings of depression.

Loss of the ability to smell may lead to the loss of libido, but this usually does not apply to those with olfactory dysfunction at birth.

Often people who have loss of smell at birth report that they pretended to be able to smell as children because they thought that smelling was something that older/mature people could do, or did not understand the concept of smelling but did not want to appear different from others. When children get older, they often realize and report to their parents that they do not actually possess a sense of smell, often to the surprise of their parents.

==Causes==
A temporary loss of smell can be caused by a blocked nose or infection. In contrast, a permanent loss of smell may be caused by death of olfactory receptor neurons in the nose or by brain injury in which there is damage to the olfactory nerve or damage to brain areas that process smell (see olfactory system). The lack of the sense of smell at birth, usually due to genetic factors, is referred to as &quot;congenital anosmia.&quot; Family members of the patient with congenital anosmia are often found with similar histories; this suggests that the anosmia may follow an autosomal dominant pattern. Anosmia may very occasionally be an early sign of a degenerative brain disease such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Another specific cause of permanent loss could be from damage to olfactory receptor neurons because of use of certain types of nasal spray; i.e., those that cause vasoconstriction of the nasal microcirculation. To avoid such damage and the subsequent risk of loss of smell, vasoconstricting nasal sprays should be used only when absolutely necessary and then for only a short amount of time. Non-vasoconstricting sprays, such as those used to treat allergy-related congestion, are safe to use for prescribed periods of time. Anosmia can also be caused by nasal polyps. These polyps are found in people with allergies, histories of sinusitis, and family history. Individuals with cystic fibrosis often develop nasal polyps.

Amiodarone is a drug used in the treatment of arrhythmias of the heart. A clinical study demonstrated that the use of this drug induced anosmia in some patients. Although rare, there was a case in which a 66-year-old male was treated with amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia. After the use of the drug he began experiencing olfactory disturbance, however after decreasing the dosage of amiodarone, the severity of the anosmia decreased accordingly, suggesting a relationship between use of amiodarone to the development of anosmia.

=== COVID-19-related anosmia ===
Chemosensory disturbances, including loss of smell or taste, are the predominant neurological symptom of COVID-19. As many as 80% of COVID-19 patients exhibit some change in chemesthesis, including smell. Loss of smell has also been found to be more predictive of COVID-19 than all other symptoms, including fever, cough, or fatigue, based on a survey of 2 million participants in the UK and US. Google searches for &quot;smell&quot;, &quot;loss of smell&quot;, &quot;anosmia&quot;, and other similar terms increased since the early months of the pandemic, and strongly correlated with increases in daily cases and deaths. Research into the mechanisms underlying these symptoms is currently ongoing.

Many countries list anosmia as an official COVID-19 symptom, and some have developed &quot;smell tests&quot; as potential screening tools.

In 2020, the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research, a collaborative research organization of international smell and taste researchers, formed to investigate loss of smell and related chemosensory symptoms.

==== Decision-making in COVID-19 patients ====
Studies have indicated that patients who presented with anosmia during the acute phase of COVID-19 are more likely to develop changes in decision-making, exhibiting more impulsive responses, which are associated with functional and structural brain changes.

=== Possible causes ===
==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis begins with a detailed history, including possible related injuries, such as upper respiratory infections or head injury. The examination may involve nasal endoscopy for obstructive factors such as polyps or swelling. A nervous system examination is performed to see if the cranial nerves are affected. On occasion, after head traumas, there are people who have unilateral anosmia. The sense of smell should be tested individually in each nostril.

Many cases of congenital anosmia remain unreported and undiagnosed. Since the disorder is present from birth the individual may have little or no understanding of the sense of smell, hence is unaware of the deficit. It may also lead to reduction of appetite.

==Treatment==
Though anosmia caused by brain damage cannot be treated, anosmia caused by inflammatory changes in the mucosa may be treated with glucocorticoids. Reduction of inflammation through the use of oral glucocorticoids such as prednisone, followed by long term topical glucocorticoid nasal spray, would easily and safely treat the anosmia. A prednisone regimen is adjusted based on the degree of the thickness of mucosa, the discharge of oedema and the presence or absence of nasal polyps. However, the treatment is not permanent and may have to be repeated after a short while. Together with medication, pressure of the upper area of the nose must be mitigated through aeration and drainage.

Anosmia caused by a nasal polyp may be treated by steroidal treatment or removal of the polyp.

Although very early in development, gene therapy has restored a sense of smell in mice with congenital anosmia when caused by ciliopathy. In this case, a genetic condition had affected cilia in their bodies which normally enabled them to detect air-borne chemicals, and an adenovirus was used to implant a working version of the IFT88 gene into defective cells in the nose, which restored the cilia and allowed a sense of smell.

==Epidemiology==
In the United States, 3% of people aged over 40 are affected by anosmia.

In 2012, smell was assessed in persons aged 40 years and older with rates of anosmia/severe hyposmia of 0.3% at age 40–49 rising to 14.1% at age 80+. Rates of hyposmia were much higher: 3.7% at age 40–49 and 25.9% at 80+.

<text>Interstate 26 (I-26) is a main route of the Interstate Highway System in the Southeastern United States. Nominally east–west, as indicated by its even number, I-26 runs from the junction of US Route 11W (US 11W) and US 23 in Kingsport, Tennessee, generally southeastward to US 17 in Charleston, South Carolina. The portion from Mars Hill, North Carolina, east (compass south) to I-240 in Asheville, North Carolina, has signs indicating FUTURE I-26, because the highway does not yet meet all of the Interstate Highway standards.

Northward from Kingsport, US 23 continues to Portsmouth, Ohio, as Corridor B of the Appalachian Development Highway System, and beyond to Columbus, Ohio, as Corridor C. In conjunction with the Columbus–Toledo corridor in Ohio formed by I-75, US 23, and State Route 15 (SR 15), I-26 forms part of a mostly high-speed four-or-more-lane highway from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Coast at Charleston, South Carolina.

==Route description==

I-26 is a diagonal Interstate Highway, which runs northwest–southeast. The extension north of Asheville is mostly north–south. Where I-26 crosses the French Broad River in Asheville at the Jeffrey Bowen Bridge (previously known as the Smoky Park Bridge), the highway runs in opposite directions from its designations. (I-26 westbound actually goes east. I-26 runs concurrently with I-240, so that I-240 eastbound and I-26 westbound are the same route.) When the extension was made in 2003, the exit numbers in North Carolina were increased by 31 to reflect the new mileage. The part that it shares with I-240 is signed as both I-240 and I-26 but follows the I-240 exit numbering pattern.

I-26 has signs with an extra FUTURE sign above (and in the same style as) the EAST and WEST signs from Asheville north to Mars Hill, North Carolina, because the older US 23 freeway does not yet meet all of the Interstate Highway standards. The road shoulders remain substandard or nonexistent along short sections of the route. A rebuild and relocation is also planned in Asheville to avoid some tight interchanges.

===Tennessee===
The exit numbers in Tennessee were formerly numbered backward—increasing from east (physically south) to west (physically north)—because this highway was formerly signed north–south as US 23 (and I-181). Although this is consistent with the south-to-north numbering conventions, this exit numbering was changed on all 284 signs along I-26 to be consistent with the rest of the east-to-west-numbered highway in March 2007. The remaining I-181 signs north of I-81 were also replaced with I-26 signs at that time.

For its entire length in Tennessee, I-26 shares the route with US 23. The route is named the James H. Quillen Parkway, after Jimmy Quillen, a past member of the US House of Representatives for Tennessee.

In Tennessee, US 23 runs south from the Virginia state line for to Kingsport. I-26 begins at the junction of US 23 with US 11W (which is locally named Stone Drive) northwest of the city. After about , I-26 crosses the South Fork Holston River before swinging around to a generally southeast path through Sullivan County. It reaches its major interchange with I-81 at exit 8A, southwest of Colonial Heights.

Shortly after entering Washington County, it reaches the northwest part of Johnson City and also serves as a local transit route as it makes its way around the north and eastern parts of the city. It begins to travel through more obviously mountainous terrain before turning to travel in a south direction. Entering Carter County briefly, it passes exit 27 before entering the Cherokee National Forest and Unicoi County. From this point, it passes through part of the Blue Ridge Mountains, first the Unaka Range and, later, as it passes Erwin, between exits 34 and 40, the Bald Mountains. It meets the Nolichucky River just after milemarker 38 and travels along its southeast bank before crossing it immediately before exit 40.

The remainder of I-26 in Tennessee passes through a sparsely populated area, at elevations of above , before reaching the North Carolina state line.

===North Carolina===
As I-26 crosses the Bald Mountains after crossing the North Carolina–Tennessee state line, it travels through a relatively high-elevation rural area. At Sam&#x27;s Gap, its reaches its highest elevation of . At Buckner Gap, I-26 reaches in elevation. For on each side of the state line, its elevation is at least .

It enters first the Walnut and Bald mountains of the Appalachian Mountains, passing through the Pisgah and Cherokee national forests as it does so, and then the Blue Ridge Mountains. Future I-26, which is not signed I-26 because it does not yet meet all interstate standards, then passes through Mars Hill and Weaverville. After coming into Asheville from the north, I-26 merges with I-240 and the two share the highway for , crossing French Broad River in the process. The two highways then have a major interchange with I-40, where I-240 ends and US 23 splits off to the east. I-26 leaves Asheville toward the south.

The land flattens substantially after entering the French Broad River drainage basin from Arden, Fletcher, and Hendersonville to Flat Rock in Henderson County. Then it crosses the Eastern Continental Divide at an elevation of , and it passes over the highest bridge in North Carolina, the Peter Guice Memorial Bridge, above the Green River between Flat Rock and Saluda. I-26 heads down a six-percent grade for the next through Howard Gap, into Polk County, and intersects with US 74, a limited-access freeway near Columbus, at an elevation of around . Afterward, I-26 exits the state and heads about to Spartanburg, South Carolina, exiting the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

I-26 has been deemed a scenic highway in North Carolina between its interchange with US 19/US 23 N (exit 9) and the North Carolina–Tennessee border. At Sam&#x27;s Gap, the Appalachian Trail crosses under I-26. In addition, northbound travelers are able to see the Blue Ridge Parkway.

===South Carolina===
I-26 enters South Carolina just northeast of Landrum, traveling southeast. The first major city along its route is Spartanburg, where it intersects I-85. Traveling through the Sumter National Forest, it connects with Newberry before entering the Columbia metropolitan area, where it connects to the southern terminus of I-77 in Cayce. 

I-26 continues southeast to Orangeburg County where it intersects with I-95. Between Cayce and Orangeburg, the highway goes up and down a few very long hills averaging about . After I-95, the highway travels southeast over flat plains with little urbanization past Summerville until it reaches its eastern terminus in Charleston.

I-26 is deemed a hurricane evacuation route in South Carolina. During hurricane evacuation, lane reversal on I-26 will occur between its junctions with I-526 in Charleston and I-77 in Columbia. This is to aid travelers leaving the Charleston area. Lane reversal on I-26 has been used, such as during evacuations for Hurricane Florence in September 2018.

==History==
Funding for I-26 in South Carolina was provided by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. The first section of I-26 was built in South Carolina between Columbia and Charleston. Construction started in 1957 and ended in 1969 with an portion opening on September 7, 1960. By late 1960, I-26 was complete from Spartanburg to Columbia, and, in February 1969, I-26&#x27;s construction from the South Carolina–North Carolina border to Columbia was completed at a cost of $118 million (equivalent to $ in ).

The first section of I-26 in North Carolina consisted of of the Interstate near Hendersonville, which opened in January 1967. I-26 between the South Carolina–North Carolina border and Asheville was completed in 1976 at a cost of $54.1 million (equivalent to $ in ).

The planning for an extension of I-26 from Asheville to I-81 near Kingsport started in 1987 to accommodate truckers traveling toward I-81 that were banned on US 19 and US 23. I-26 from Mars Hill, North Carolina, to the North Carolina–Tennessee border opened in August 2003 at a cost of $230 million (equivalent to $ in ). Also, in 2003, the full extension of I-26 from the North Carolina–Tennessee border to I-81 was completed and opened.

===Interstate 181===
Interstate 181 (I-181) was established in December 1985 as an Interstate designation of US 23, which was already built to Interstate standards in the 1970s. In Tennessee, I-181 traversed from US 321/State Route 67 (SR 67), in Johnson City, to US 11W/SR 1, in Kingsport, totaling . US 23 continued on both directions as Interstate grade to the Virginia line to the north and south to Erwin; by 1992, US 23 was upgraded to Interstate grade south to Sam&#x27;s Gap at the North Carolina line. All exit numbers were based on US 23 mileage. On August 5, 2003, after completion of a section in North Carolina, I-26 was extended west into Tennessee, replacing I-181 from Johnson City to I-81; north of I-81, I-181 continued into Kingsport.

The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) initially ruled against an extension of I-26 (as the number) along the remainder of I-181 to Kingsport since that would give a main route Interstate Highway (I-26) a so-called &quot;stub end&quot;, not connecting to any other Interstate Highway, an international border, or a seacoast. In 2005, the numerical extension was enacted by the effect of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), being signed into law on August 10. In March 2007, I-181 was officially decommissioned, as all signs and exit numbers were changed over to I-26&#x27;s designation.

==Future==
The I-26 Connector in Asheville will relocate Interstate 26 across the French Broad River, convert Patton Avenue along Bowen Bridges to local traffic and reroute I-240 along I-26 further north. The final contract for the main section, awarded to Archer–Wright Joint Venture, totalled $1.15 billion, the largest contract in the state&#x27;s history. The design was selected May 15, 2024.

<text>Interstate 27 (I-27) is an Interstate Highway, entirely in the US state of Texas, running north from Lubbock to I-40 in Amarillo. These two cities are the only control cities on I-27; other cities and towns served by I-27 include (from south to north) New Deal, Abernathy, Hale Center, Plainview, Kress, Tulia, Happy, and Canyon. In Amarillo, I-27 is commonly known as the Canyon Expressway (or Canyon E-Way), although it is also called Canyon Drive on its access roads. I-27 was officially designated the Marshall Formby Memorial Highway after former attorney and State Senator Marshall Formby in 2005. The entire length of I-27 replaced US Highway 87 (US 87) for through traffic. An extension of I-27 north to Raton, New Mexico, and south to Laredo, Texas, was approved in 2022.

==Route description==

I-27 parallels the BNSF Railway&#x27;s Plainview Subdivision, which splits from its Chicago–Southern California Transcon line at Canyon and runs south to Lubbock. A large amount of the alignment is on former US 87, but several portions through built-up areas have been bypassed, as well as two longer areas where US 87 still follows the old road.

The Interstate officially begins north of County Road 7500, at the beginning of access control on the four-lane US 87 freeway, at the very southern edge of Lubbock&#x27;s city limits. Mile 0 is currently posted near 77th Street, about five blocks south of Loop 289. Exit numbering begins just to the south, with exit 1 at the 82nd Street interchange; the freeway becomes six lanes at its north end. With the extension being approved on September 3, 2024, by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Texas Transportation Commission on September 26, 2024, both mile markers and exit munbers are planned to be eventually updated to take it into account. The Loop 289 interchange is a cloverleaf between the oneway frontage roads of each highway, and with direct ramps from I-27 south to Loop 289 west (exit 1A) and Loop 289 east to I-27 north. US 84 (Avenue Q and Slaton Highway) crosses I-27 at a three-level diamond interchange, with an extra approach from the northeast carrying Avenue A into the junction. Exit 1B connects I-27 south to US 84 and the Loop 289 frontage roads, while all traffic from US 87 north to US 84, Avenue A, or Loop 289 must use exit 1 for 82nd Street.

The six-lane cross section that began at exit 1 remains through Lubbock. Major junctions in that city include US 62/State Highway 114 (SH 11, 19th Street; exit 3) and US 82 (Marsha Sharp Freeway; exit 4). Between these two interchanges, the frontage roads temporarily end as I-27 crosses over a rail line. Spur 326 (Avenue Q) merges with I-27 at exit 6A, and exit 6B is a split diamond interchange with Loop 289. The outer lanes leave at Farm to Market Road 2641 (FM 2641, Regis Street; exit 8), reducing I-27 to two lanes in each direction as it passes Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport and leaves the city.
I-27 crosses over the Plainview Sub for the first time north of FM 1294 (Drew Street, exit 11), and another short gap exists in the frontage roads there. North of the overpass, the frontage roads are two-way; I-27 then passes through New Deal, bypassing the central part of the town to the west. Old US 87 between exits 13 and 15 is now Loop 461; at exit 15, I-27 begins to parallel the rail line, just to its west. Along this part of the highway, and other similar portions, slip ramps still connect the mainlanes with the frontage roads, but intersecting roads pass over all four roadways and the railroad on a long bridge; a pair of two-way roadways connects the frontage roads to the crossroad, with the one on the east crossing the railroad at-grade.

As it approaches Abernathy, I-27 curves west away from the Plainview Sub. The old main road through the city, between exits 20 and 22, is now Loop 369; I-27 passes through 1.5 blocks to the east. Despite I-27&#x27;s location north of Abernathy, west of the rail line, all interchanges between Abernathy and Hale Center, except the one at FM 54 (exit 24), use the same configuration where the intersecting road crosses over all roadways. Approaching Hale Center, I-27 curves northeast as it splits from FM 1424 (exit 36) at a simple diamond interchange. The freeway passes through the city one block east of the old road, now Business I-27-T (Bus. I-27-T), which is accessed at exits 36 and 38. As it leaves Hale Center, I-27 turns to the northeast, following the northwest side of the rail line.

The next two interchanges along the railroad between Hale Center and Plainview use the same style, in which the crossroad goes over everything. Bus. I-27-U splits at exit 45, a modified Y interchange, to pass through Plainview, and I-27 travels west of that city on a bypass. The two outer interchanges on this bypass, FM 3466 (exit 48) and Quincy Street (exit 51), are handled in the same way as the interchanges along the railroad, but the other two, US 70 (exit 49) and SH 194 (exit 50), are standard diamonds. Between exits 49 and 50 is another overpass over the frontage roads—24th Street—with no separate slip ramps. Bus. I-27-U ends at a trumpet interchange (exit 53) north of Plainview, where I-27 again begins to parallel the Plainview Sub to the west. Both interchanges between this one and the first split with US 87 (exit 61), a modified Y interchange south of Kress, continue the pattern with the crossroad bridging over everything.

After it leaves US 87, I-27 is no longer next to the rail line, but it continues to handle interchanges as it does alongside the line, except at SH 86 (exit 74), a standard diamond interchange that serves Tulia. US 87 rejoins the freeway at a modified diamond interchange (exit 77) north of Tulia, at which I-27 crosses to the east side of the Plainview Sub before paralleling it to that side. After several of the typical interchanges adjacent to the railroad, US 87 splits again at a modified Y interchange (exit 88) south of Happy. Except for the northernmost one, all the interchanges on the bypass of Happy and Canyon are diamond interchanges; there is a break in the frontage road north of FM 3331 (exit 108), where I-27 crosses the Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River. Exits 109 (Country Club Road) and 110 (US 87 south, US 60 west) are integrated, with some access to one road provided via the other.
I-27 is overlapped by US 60 and US 87 from exit 110 north of Canyon to the end of the Interstate in Amarillo; here, the frontage roads are one-way. Several near the south end are handled by bridging the intersecting road over all roadways, but, once I-27 crosses Loop 335 (exit 116), almost all interchanges are diamond interchanges. At exit 119A, which marks the south end of the six-lane cross section in Amarillo, Hillside Road passes under both the mainlanes and the frontage roads, with two ramps providing partial access. Other connections with Hillside Road are made via Western Street (exit 119B), which crosses the frontage roads at grade. The end of I-27 at I-40 (exit 123B) is a fully directional turbine interchange; US 287 also passes through, using I-40 to the east and US 60/US 87 to the north. Four lanes continue beyond I-40 and are joined by several from the I-40 ramps, making the northernmost portion of the Canyon Expressway five lanes in each direction. Several blocks beyond I-40, the highway ends at a split into two one-way pairs. Northbound traffic feeds onto Fillmore Street (US 87 north) and Buchanan Street (US 60 east and US 287 north), while southbound traffic approaches on Taylor Street (US 287 south) and Pierce Street (US 60 west and US 87 south). The rightmost of the five northbound lanes is barrier-separated from the rest, forcing traffic exiting I-40 west onto Buchanan Street. Through the I-40 interchange and the split, the frontage roads are discontinuous.

==History==

The roadway between Lubbock and Amarillo was part of the Puget Sound to Gulf Highway (SH 9), one of the original state highways defined in 1917. In 1926, it became part of US 385, which was absorbed into US 87 in 1935. The SH 9 overlap was dropped in the 1939 renumbering. Paving began in 1929 near Plainview and was almost complete by 1940, with only about south of Canyon still bituminous surfaced until later that decade. The Canyon Expressway, a freeway upgrade of US 87 (also US 60 there) between Canyon and Amarillo, was built in the late 1950s and early 1960s. This highway, with a design speed of , included frontage roads along its entire length and ended in each city with a Y interchange: the split of US 60 and US 87 in Canyon, and a split between the two oneway pairs of Taylor and Fillmore streets and Pierce and Buchanan streets in Amarillo. The Dumas Expressway, a freeway upgrade of US 87 north from Amarillo, opened several years later, feeding into the same one-way pairs.

Four-laning of US 87 from Canyon to Lubbock was completed in the late 1960s, with the last section to be widened lying between Abernathy and Lubbock. While this was built as a surface divided highway south of Canyon, short sections of freeway were built through New Deal, Abernathy, and Hale Center, and interchanges were built at US 70 and SH 194 on the new bypass of Plainview and at SH 86 (toward the west) south of Tulia. The original two-lane road, where bypassed, became Loop 461 (in New Deal in 1968; marked as Bus. US 87-G), Loop 369 (in Abernathy in 1962), a local street (in Hale Center), and Loop 445 (in Plainview in 1967; marked as Bus. US 87-G).

I-27 was not part of the original Interstate Highway System chosen in the 1950s; the spur from I-40 to Lubbock was authorized with the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968, which added to the system. George H. Mahon, member of the US House of Representatives from 1935 to 1979 and chair of the House Committee on Appropriations after 1964, helped secure funding for the road. Texas officially designated the highway in early 1969, originally running from US 62 near downtown Lubbock to I-40 in Amarillo; the definition was extended south through Lubbock to the south side of the loop in early 1976. The existing freeway sections, including the Canyon Expressway, were absorbed into I-27 despite not being built to Interstate standards. New construction began in 1975, from Lubbock north to New Deal, and most of the freeway was completed in the 1980s. Two long sections of US 87 were bypassed: Happy to Canyon on December 5, 1986, and Kress to Tulia soon after; I-27 was complete north of Lubbock by 1988. Most of the Happy–Canyon bypass was built along the two-lane FM 1541, which now ends at exit 103 southeast of Canyon.

The final section of I-27 to be built was through Lubbock, inside Loop 289; this was built in the early 1990s and completed on September 3, 1992. On that day, a ceremony at the 34th Street overpass opened the road from 19th Street (US 62) to 54th Street, completing Texas&#x27;s portion of the Interstate Highway System. At its south end, the new I-27 connected to an existing freeway upgrade of US 87, built about 1970, to a traffic circle at US 84 (just north of Loop 289). The old route of US 87 through Lubbock became Bus. US 87-G upon completion of I-27. Two business loops of I-27 have been designated: through Plainview (former Loop 445) in early 1991 and through Hale Center (formerly a local street) in 2002.

The completion of I-27, costing a total of $453.4 million (equivalent to $ in ), encouraged growth along the highway: toward the northside of Lubbock and the southwest in Amarillo. Many other areas of Lubbock, however, have not seen this growth. Plainview, the largest city between Lubbock and Amarillo, has the only significant retail cluster outside the two terminal cities and has attracted several industries.

On September 5, 2024, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approved a southern extension of I-27 from its previous terminus at Loop 289 to north of County Road 7500, the new limit for access control on the US 87 freeway north of that point. The Texas Transportation Commission would later also approve the extension at their meeting on September 26, 2024.

==Future==

In 1995, a study of a southern extension of I-27 to I-10 found that a full freeway extension would not be economically feasible, instead recommending limited upgrades to the three corridors studied: SH 349 via Midland and Odessa to east of Fort Stockton, US 87 via Big Spring to Sonora or Junction, and US 84 via Sweetwater to Sonora or Junction. Of the three corridors, the Sweetwater route came the closest to warranting a freeway. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, passed in 1998, designated I-27 as part of the Ports to Plains Corridor, a High Priority Corridor from Mexico at Laredo to Denver. This corridor crosses I-20 at Big Spring and Midland (via a split) and I-10 at Sonora. The part of the Ports-to-Plains Corridor within Texas was a proposed Trans-Texas Corridor. Some parts of this plan have I-14 possibly ending where I-27 will cross I-20. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) recommends studying I-27 extension again. I-27 is planned to be extended from Loop 289 to FM 1585 (Loop 88).

On June 10, 2019, Governor Greg Abbott signed Texas House Bill 1079, which authorizes a comprehensive study to extend I-27 north of Amarillo and south of Lubbock to Laredo. The proposed route south of Lubbock would have the Interstate go to Lamesa, then split with one route going toward Midland and the other traveling to Big Spring. The two routes would then merge near Sterling City, travel through San Angelo and Del Rio, travel near the border until Eagle Pass, turn east to Carrizo Springs, then travel south to Laredo.

In June 2024, it was announced that I-27 would potentially run along the Heartland Expressway and the Theodore Roosevelt Expressway through Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Montana. It also forms part of the Great Plains International Trade Corridor, continuing north to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Currently, no Interstates connect to Saskatchewan.

===Numbering===
On March 15, 2022, the 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed by President Joe Biden that added the extension of I-27 north to Raton, New Mexico, and south to Laredo to the Interstate Highway System. A bill introduced in March 2023 would explicitly designate the extension as I-27 with two auxiliary routes numbered I-227 and I-327. I-227 is proposed to be routed via SH 158 from Sterling City to Midland and SH 349 from Midland to Lamesa; I-327 would utilize US 287 from Dumas to the Oklahoma state line. It would also formally name the Interstate the Ports-to-Plains Corridor. The bill was introduced by legislators from both Texas and New Mexico. On August 1, 2023, the legislation passed through the U.S. Senate with some slight modifications; I-227 was redesignated as I-27W with I-27 between Sterling City and Lamesa redesignated as I-27E and I-327 was redesignated as I-27N. The act was passed again by the Senate in March 2024 after some changes were made in the U.S. House of Representatives in December 2023.

<text>Interstate 29 (I-29) is an Interstate Highway in the Midwestern United States. I-29 runs from Kansas City, Missouri, at a junction with I-35 and I-70, to the Canada–US border near Pembina, North Dakota, where it connects with Manitoba Provincial Trunk Highway 75 (PTH 75), which continues on to Winnipeg. The road follows the course of three major rivers, all of which form the borders of US states. The southern portion of I-29 closely parallels the Missouri River from Kansas City northward to Sioux City, Iowa, where it crosses and then parallels the Big Sioux River. For the northern third of the highway, it closely follows the Red River of the North. The major cities that I-29 connects to includes (from south to north) Council Bluffs, Iowa; Sioux City, Iowa; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Fargo, North Dakota; and Grand Forks, North Dakota. I-29 also serves as a road connection between the four largest public universities in the Dakotas: the University of North Dakota, North Dakota State University, the University of South Dakota, and South Dakota State University.

===Missouri===

Near its southern terminus, I-29 is concurrent with I-35 and U.S. Route 71 (US 71). The Interstate diverts from US 71 just north of St. Joseph and follows a sparsely populated corridor along the Missouri River to Council Bluffs. During the design phase there was an alternative sending the route further along US 71 through the bigger towns of Maryville, Missouri, and Clarinda, Iowa. During the Great Flood of 1993, the Missouri River flooded this section and traffic was rerouted to US 71 through Maryville and Clarinda. I-29 was closed again for about two months during the 2011 Missouri River Flood.

Almost all of I-29 in Missouri is in an area called the Platte Purchase that was not originally part of Missouri when it entered the Union.

===Iowa===
I-29 begins in Iowa near Hamburg. It goes northwest to an interchange with Iowa Highway 2 (Iowa 2), then goes north until Council Bluffs. It appears to briefly runs concurrent with I-80, but I-29 actually runs outside I-80 until the two separate less than east of Omaha, Nebraska, to follow the Missouri River north, winding its way along the western and northern edges of Council Bluffs. North of Council Bluffs, I-29 intersects I-680 at exit 61. At exit 71, I-880 begins, while I-29 continues on a northwesterly path toward Sioux City. At Sioux City, I-129 spurs off of I-29 to go west toward South Sioux City, Nebraska. After continuing toward downtown Sioux City on a northerly route, I-29 turns west and enters South Dakota.

All of I-29 through Iowa is part of the Lewis and Clark Trail.

===South Dakota===

I-29 enters South Dakota at North Sioux City by crossing over the Big Sioux River. It runs northwest until its interchange with Highway 50 (SD 50) near Vermillion, where it turns north. The highway alignment is due north until just before Sioux Falls. In the Sioux Falls area, I-29 serves the western part of Sioux Falls while I-229 spurs off and serves eastern Sioux Falls. In northwestern Sioux Falls, I-29 meets I-90. After that, it continues north past Brookings and an intersection with US 14. At the intersection with SD 28, I-29 turns northwest toward Watertown. After Watertown, the highway continues north and passes an intersection with US 12 before continuing into North Dakota.

===North Dakota===

I-29 enters North Dakota from the south near Hankinson. At Fargo, it meets I-94/US 52 and continues north along the Red River toward Grand Forks. At its northern terminus, I-29 enters Canada and becomes PTH 75 in Manitoba, which leads to Winnipeg.

==History==
===Interstate 31===
The portion from Fargo, North Dakota, to the Canada–US border was originally considered for designation as Interstate 31 (I-31) in 1957 for present-day I-29. No freeway was initially planned south of Fargo. However, it was subsequently decided in 1958 to connect I-29 and I-31 between Sioux Falls and Fargo. The entire freeway was then built and numbered as I-29.

===Interstate 49===
Residents of Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana began campaigning in the 1960s to extend I-29 via the US 71 corridor from Kansas City, Missouri, to New Orleans, Louisiana. The campaign would create a limited access highway from New Orleans to Canada and on to Winnipeg. That extension came to be called I-49, which was not part of the 1957 master plan. It was assigned a separate number instead of I-29 to conform with the numbering rules for Interstate Highways (increasing from west to east for north–south routes), as it would lie east of I-35 and west of I-55. When I-49 is complete, the goal of the association will have been accomplished, with only a brief gap (served by other Interstates or US 71).

=== 2019 closures ===

In March and April 2019, as a result of the 2019 Midwestern US floods, I-29 was closed in both directions for approximately between St. Joseph and Council Bluffs. Much of this section of I-29, including at the Missouri–Iowa border, runs over or through a large floodplain for the Missouri and Platte rivers. As such, multiple elevated sections of the highway collapsed and other sections were submerged or washed out by floodwaters. This was the largest closure of an Interstate Highway in terms of distance in the history of the Interstate Highway System. A signed detour was not officially designated in most areas, as the roads that would be used as detours are mostly rural farm roads that were also submerged by flooding. However, along I-80 in Iowa, traffic from I-80 in Iowa was officially detoured via I-35 from Des Moines, Iowa, to Kansas City, Missouri. US 75, paralleling I-29 on the other side of the Missouri River, was also closed in large sections due to flooding.

By May 2019, the vast majority of I-29 had been repaired and reopened, with the exception of around Council Bluffs where the highway ran concurrent with I-680 (now the portion of I-29 between I-680 and I-880). However, throughout the remainder of the spring and summer, and even early fall, more rainfall and flooding resulted in sections of I-29 being closed again, including on the recently repaired sections. At a few times, the entire section between St. Joseph and Council Bluffs was completely shut down, although this was rare after May 2019.

As of October 2019, all of I-29 is open to traffic in both directions, although some Missouri River bridges and local farm roads remain closed due to flooding.

<doc id="89008" wikidata="Q261719" url="?curid=89008" title="Theory of multiple intelligences">
<text>The theory of multiple intelligences (MI) posits that human intelligence is not a single general ability but comprises various distinct modalities, such as linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, and spatial intelligences. Introduced in his book &quot;Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences&quot; (1983), this framework has significantly influenced educational practices by encouraging the development of diverse teaching strategies that cater to different student strengths.

Despite its educational impact, MI has faced criticism from the psychological and scientific communities. A primary point of contention is Gardner&#x27;s use of the term &quot;intelligences&quot; to describe these modalities. Critics argue that labeling these abilities as separate intelligences expands the definition of intelligence beyond its traditional scope, leading to debates over its scientific validity.

The crux of the debate lies in terminology and interpretation rather than an outright conflict with scientific principles. While empirical research often supports a general intelligence factor (g-factor), Gardner contends that his model offers a more nuanced understanding of human cognitive abilities. This difference in defining and interpreting &quot;intelligence&quot; has fueled ongoing discussions about the theory&#x27;s scientific robustness.

In educational contexts, many practitioners find the MI framework valuable for promoting inclusive and varied instructional methods. By acknowledging multiple ways students can excel, educators can tailor their approaches to foster a more engaging and effective learning environment. Thus, while debates persist regarding its scientific classification, the practical applications of MI in education continue to be recognized.

==Separation criteria==
Beginning in the late 1970s, using a pragmatic definition, Howard Gardner surveyed several disciplines and cultures around the world to determine skills and abilities essential to human development and culture building. He subjected candidate abilities to evaluation using eight criteria that must be substantively met to warrant their identification as an &quot;intelligence&quot;. Furthermore, the intelligences need to be relatively autonomous from each other, and composed of subsets of skills that are highly correlated and coherently organized. 

In 1983, the field of cognitive neuroscience was embryonic but Gardner was one of the early psychological theorists to describe direct links between brain systems and intelligence. Likewise the field of educational neuroscience was yet to be conceived. Since &quot;Frames of Mind&quot; was published (1983) the terms cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience have become standard in the field with extensive libraries of scholarly and scientific papers and textbooks. Thus it is essential to examine neuroscience evidence as it pertains to MI validity.

Gardner defined intelligence as &quot;a biopsychological potential to process information that can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture.&quot;

This definition is unique for several reasons that account for MI theory&#x27;s broad appeal to educators as well as its rejection by mainstream psychologists who are rooted in the traditional conception of intelligence as an abstract, logical capacity. A fundamental element for each intelligence is a framework of clearly defined levels of skill, complexity and accomplishment. One model that fits with the MI framework is Bloom’s taxonomy where each intelligence can be delineated along different levels, ranging from basic knowledge up to their highest levels of analysis / synthesis.

MI is also unique because it gives full appreciation for the impact and interactions - via symbol systems - between the individual’s cognitions and their particular culture. As Gardner states, 
Unlike traditional practices beginning in the 19th century, MI theory is not built on the statistical analyses of psychometric test data searching for factors that account for academic achievement. Instead, Gardner employs a multi-disciplinary, cross-cultural methodology to evaluate which human capacities fit into a comprehensive model of intelligence. Eight criteria accounting for advances in neuroscience and the influence of cultural factors are used to qualify a capacity as an intelligence. These criteria are drawn from a more extensive database than what was acceptable and available to researchers in the late 19th and 20th centuries. Evidence is gathered from a variety of disciplines including psychology, neurology, biology, sociology, and anthropology as well as the arts and humanities. If a candidate faculty meets this set of criteria reasonably well then it can qualify as an intelligence. If it does not, then it is set aside or reconceptualized.
=== Criteria for each type of intelligence ===

The eight criteria can be grouped into four general categories: 
# biology (neuroscience and evolution)
# analysis (core operations and symbol systems)
# psychology (skill development, individual differences)
# psychometrics (psychological experiments and test evidence) 

The criteria briefly described are:
* potential for brain isolation by brain damage
* place in evolutionary history
* presence of core operations
* susceptibility to encoding (symbolic expression)
* a distinct developmental progression
* the existence of savants, prodigies and other exceptional people
* support from experimental psychology
* support from psychometric findings

This scientific method resembles the process used by astronomers to determine which celestial bodies to classify as a planet versus dwarf planet, star, comet, etc.

==Forms of intelligences==
In &quot;Frames of Mind&quot; and its sequels, Howard Gardner describes eight intelligences that can be expressed in everyday life in a variety of ways referred to as domains, skills, competencies, or talents. Like describing a multi-layer cake, the complexity depends upon how you slice the cake. One model integrates the eight intelligences with Sternberg&#x27;s triarchic theory, so each intelligence is actively expressed in three ways: (1) creative, (2) academic / analytical and (3) practical thinking. In this analogy each of the eight cake layers are divided into three segments with different expressions sharing a central core. Exemplar professions and adult roles requiring specific intelligences are described along with their core skills and potential deficits. Several references to exemplar neuroscientific studies are also provided for each of the eight intelligences. Furthermore, some have suggested that the &#x27;intelligences&#x27; refer to talents, personality, or ability rather than a distinct form of intelligence.

The two intelligences that are most associated with the traditional I.Q. or general intelligence are the &quot;linguistic&quot; and &quot;logical-mathematical&quot; intelligences. Some intelligence models and tests also include &quot;visual-spatial&quot; intelligence as a third element.

===Musical ===
This area of intelligence includes sensitivity to the sounds, rhythms, pitch, and tones of music. People with musical intelligence normally may be able to sing, play musical instruments, or compose music. They have high sensitivity to pitch, meter, melody and timbre. Musical intelligence includes cognitive elements that contribute to a person’s success and quality of life. There is a strong relationship between music and emotions as evidenced in both popular and classical music spheres. Neuroscience investigators continue to investigate the interaction between music and cognitive performances. Music is deeply rooted in human evolutionary history (Paleolithic bone flute) and culture (every country on Earth has a national anthem&#x27;) and our personal lives (all important life events are associated with particular types of music (e.g., birthday, wedding songs, funeral dirges, etc.).

Deficits in musical processing and abilities include congenital amusia, tone deafness, musical hallucinations, musical anhedonia, acquired music agnosia, and arrhythmia (beat deafness).

Professions requiring essential musical skills include vocalist, instrumentalist, lyricist, dancer, sound engineer and composer. Musical intelligence is combined with kinesthetic to produce instrumentalists, dancers and, combined with a linguistic intelligence, for music critics and lyricists. Music combined with interpersonal intelligence is required for success as a music therapist or teacher.

=== Visual-spatial ===
This area deals with spatial awareness / judgment and the ability to visualize with the mind&#x27;s eye. It is composed of two main dimensions: A) mental visualization and B) perception of the physical world (spatial arrangements and objects). It includes both practical problem-solving as well as artistic creations. Spatial ability is one of the three factors beneath &quot;g&quot; (general intelligence) in the hierarchical model of intelligence. Many I.Q. tests include a measure of spatial problem-solving skills, e.g., block design and mental rotation of objects.

Visual-spatial intelligence can be expressed in both practical (e.g., drafting and building) or artistic (e.g., fine art, crafts, floral arrangements) ways. Or they can be combined in fields such as architecture, industrial design, landscape design, and fashion design. Visual-spatial processing is often combined with the kinesthetic intelligence and referred to as eye-hand or visual-motor integration for tasks such as hitting a baseball (see Babe Ruth example for Kinesthetic), sewing, golf or skiing.

Professions that emphasize skill with visual-spatial processing include carpentry, engineering, designers, pilots, firefighters, surgeons, commercial and fine arts and crafts. Spatial intelligence combined with linguistic is required for success as an art critic or textbook graphic designer. Spatial artistic skills combined with naturalist sensitivity produce a pet groomer or clothing designer, costumer.

=== Linguistic ===
The core linguistic ability is sensitivity to words and their meanings. People with high verbal-linguistic intelligence display a facility with expressive language and verbal comprehension. They are typically good at reading, writing, telling stories, rhetoric and memorizing words along with dates. Verbal ability is one of the most &quot;g&quot;-loaded abilities. Linguistic (academic aspect) intelligence is measured with the Verbal Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV).

Deficits in linguistic abilities include expressive and receptive aphasia, agraphia, specific language impairment, written language disorder and word recognition deficit (dyslexia).

Linguistic ability can be expressed according to Triarchic theory in three main ways: analytical-academic (reading, writing, definitions); practical (verbal or written directions, explanations, narration); and creative (story telling, poetry, lyrics, imaginative word play, science fiction).

Professions that require linguistic skills include teaching, sales, management, counselors, leaders, childcare, journalists, academics and politicians (debating and creating support for particular sets of values). Linguistic intelligence combines with all other intelligences to facilitate communication either via the spoken or written word. It is frequently highly correlated with the interpersonal intelligence to facilitate social interactions for education, business and human relations. Successful sports coaches combine three intelligences: kinesthetic, interpersonal and linguistic. Corporate managers require skills in the interpersonal, linguistic and logical-mathematical intelligences.

=== Logical-mathematical ===
This area has to do with logic, abstractions, reasoning, calculations, strategic and critical thinking. This intelligence includes the capacity to understand underlying principles of some kind of causal system. Logical reasoning is closely linked to fluid intelligence as well as to general intelligence (&quot;g&quot; factor).  This capacity is most often associated with convergent problem-solving but it also includes divergent thinking associated with “problem-finding”.

This intelligence is most closely associated with the cognitive development theory described by Jean Piaget (1983). The four main types of logical-mathematical intelligence include logical reasoning, calculations, practical thinking (common sense) and discovery.

Deficits in logical-mathematical thinking include acalculia, dyscalculia, mild cognitive impairment, dementia and intellectual disability.

Some critics believe that the logical and mathematics domains should be separate entities. However, Gardner argues that they both spring from the same source—abstractions taken from real world elements, e.g., logic from words and calculations from the manipulation from objects. This is not dissimilar from the relationship between musical intelligence and vocal or instrumental skills where they are very different expressions springing from a shared musical source. 

Professions most closely associated with this intelligence include accounting, bookkeeping, banking, finance, engineering and the sciences. Logic-mathematical skills combine with all the other intelligences to facilitate complex problem solving and creation such as environmental engineering and scientists (naturalist); symphonies (music); public sculptures (visual-spatial) and choreography/ movement analysis (kinesthetic).

===Bodily-kinesthetic===
The core elements of the bodily-kinesthetic intelligence are control of one&#x27;s bodily movements and fine motor control to handle objects skillfully. Gardner elaborates to say that this also includes a sense of timing, a clear sense of the goal of a physical action, along with the ability to train responses. Kinesthetic ability can be displayed in goal-directed activities (athletics, handcrafts, etc.) as well as in more expressive movements (drama, dance, mime and gestures). Expressive movements can be for either concepts or feelings. For example, saluting, shaking hands or facial expressions can convey both ideas and emotions. Two major kinesthetic categories are gross and fine motor skills.

Deficits in kinesthetic ability are described as proprioception disorders affecting body awareness, coordination, balance, dexterity and motor control.

Gardner believes that careers that suit those with high bodily-kinesthetic intelligence include: athletes, dancers, musicians, actors, craftspeople, builders, technicians, and firefighters. Although these careers can be duplicated through virtual simulation, they will not produce the actual physical learning that is needed in this intelligence.  

Often people with high physical intelligence combined with visual motion acuity will have excellent hand-eye coordination and be very agile; they are precise and accurate in movement (surgeons) and can express themselves using their body (actors and dancers). Gardner referred to the idea of natural skill and innate kinesthetic intelligence within his discussion of the autobiographical story of Babe Ruth – a legendary baseball player who, at 15, felt that he had been &#x27;born&#x27; on the pitcher&#x27;s mound. Seeing the pitched ball and coordinating one’s swing to meet it over the plate requires highly developed visual-motor integration. Each sport requires its own distinctive combination of specific skills associated with the kinesthetic and visual-spatial intelligences.
==== Physical ability ====

Physical intelligence, also known as bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, is any intelligence derived through physical and practiced learning such as sports, dance, or craftsmanship. It may refer to the ability to use one&#x27;s hands to create, to express oneself with one&#x27;s body, a reliance on tactile mechanisms and movement, and accuracy in controlling body movement. An individual with high physical intelligence is someone who is adept at using their physical body to solve problems and express ideas and emotions. The ability to control the physical body and the mind-body connection is part of a much broader range of human potential as set out in Gardner&#x27;s theory of multiple intelligences.

==== Characteristics ====
Exhibiting well developed bodily kinesthetic intelligence will be reflected in a person&#x27;s movements and how they use their physical body. Often people with high physical intelligence will have excellent hand-eye coordination and be very agile; they are precise and accurate in movement and can express themselves using their body. Gardner referred to the idea of natural skill and innate physical intelligence within his discussion of the autobiographical story of Babe Ruth – a legendary baseball player who, at 15, felt that he has been &#x27;born&#x27; on the pitcher&#x27;s mound. Individuals with a high body-kinesthetic, or physical intelligence, are likely to be successful in physical careers, including athletes, dancers, musicians, police officers, and soldiers.

=== Interpersonal ===
In MI theory, individuals who have high interpersonal intelligence are characterized by their sensitivity to others&#x27; moods, feelings, temperaments, motivations, and their ability to cooperate or to lead a group. According to Thomas Armstrong in &quot;How Are Kids Smart: Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom&quot;, &quot;Interpersonal intelligence is often misunderstood with being extroverted or liking other people”. Those with high interpersonal intelligence communicate effectively and empathize easily with others, and may be either leaders or followers. They often enjoy discussion and debate.&quot; They have insightful understanding of other peoples’ point of view. Daniel Goleman based his concept of emotional intelligence in part on the feeling aspects of the intrapersonal and interpersonal intelligences.  Interpersonal skill can be displayed in either one-on-one and group interactions.

Deficits in interpersonal understanding are described as ego centrism, narcissism, socio-pathology, Asperger’s Syndrome and autism.

Gardner believes that careers that suit those with high interpersonal intelligence include leaders, politicians, managers, teachers, clergy, counselors, social workers and sales persons. Mother Teresa, Martin Luther King and Lyndon Johnson are cited as historical leaders with exceptional interpersonal intelligence. Interpersonal combined with intrapersonal management are required for successful leaders, psychologists, life coaches and conflict negotiators. And obviously, team sports require specific combinations of the interpersonal and kinesthetic intelligences while individual sports emphasize the kinesthetic and intrapersonal intelligences (i.e., Tiger Woods and gymnasts).

In theory, individuals who have high interpersonal intelligence are characterized by their sensitivity to others&#x27; moods, feelings, temperaments, motivations, and their ability to cooperate to work as part of a group. According to Gardner in &quot;How Are Kids Smart: Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom&quot;, &quot;Inter- and Intra- personal intelligence is often misunderstood with being extroverted or liking other people&quot;. &quot;Those with high interpersonal intelligence communicate effectively and empathize easily with others, and may be either leaders or followers. They often enjoy discussion and debate.&quot; Gardner has equated this with emotional intelligence of Goleman.

=== Intrapersonal ===
This refers to having a deep and accurate understanding of the self; what one&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses are, what makes one unique, being able to predict and manage one&#x27;s own reactions, emotions and behaviors. Activities associated with this intelligence include introspection and self-reflection. Intrapersonal skills can be categorized in at least four areas: metacognition, awareness of thoughts, management of feelings and emotions, behavior, self-management, decision-making and judgment.

Deficits in intrapersonal understanding are described as anosognosia, depersonalization, dissociation and self-dysregulation (ADHD).

Leaders and people in high stress occupations need well developed intrapersonal skills, e.g., pilots, police and firefighters, entrepreneurs, middle managers, first responders and health care providers. Mahatma Gandhi, Jesus and Martin Luther King Jr. are all noted for their strong self-awareness. Deficits in intrapersonal understanding may be correlated with ADHD, substance abuse and emotional disturbances (mid-life crisis, etc.).

Intrapersonal intelligence may be correlated with concepts such as self-confidence, introspection and self-efficacy but it should not be confused with personality styles/preferences such as narcissism, self-esteem, introversion or shyness. High level performance in many demanding professions and roles requires exceptional intrapersonal intelligence: Olympic athletes, professional golfers, stage performers, CEOs, crisis managers.

=== Naturalistic ===
Not part of Gardner&#x27;s original seven, naturalistic intelligence was proposed by him in 1995. &quot;If I were to rewrite &quot;Frames of Mind&quot; today, I would probably add an eighth intelligence – the intelligence of the naturalist. It seems to me that the individual who is readily able to recognize flora and fauna, to make other consequential distinctions in the natural world, and to use this ability productively (in hunting, in farming, in biological science) is exercising an important intelligence and one that is not adequately encompassed in the current list.&quot; This area has to do with nurturing and relating information to one&#x27;s natural surroundings. Examples include classifying natural forms such as animal and plant species and rocks and mountain types. Essential cognitive skills include pattern recognition, taxonomy and empathy for living beings. Nature deficit disorder describes a recent hypothesis that mental health is negatively impacted by a lack of attention to and understanding of nature, e.g., nature deficit disorder. This ability was clearly of value in our evolutionary past as hunters, gatherers, and farmers; it continues to be central in such roles as botanist or chef.

This sort of ecological receptiveness is deeply rooted in a &quot;sensitive, ethical, and holistic understanding&quot; of the world and its complexities – including the role of humanity within the greater ecosphere.

This ability was clearly of value in our evolutionary past as hunters, gatherers, and farmers and it continues to be central in such roles as botanist, chef, animal care, veterinarians, ecological scientists and botanists. 

=== Proposed additional intelligences ===
From the beginning Howard Gardner has stated that there may be more intelligences beyond the original six identified in 1983. That is why the naturalist was added to the list in 1999. Several other human capacities were rejected because they do not meet enough of the criteria including personality characteristics such as humor, sexuality and extroversion.

=== Pedagogical and digital ===
In January 2016, Gardner mentioned in an interview with Big Think that he was considering adding the teaching–pedagogical intelligence &quot;which allows us to be able to teach successfully to other people&quot;. In the same interview, he explicitly refused some other suggested intelligences like humour, cooking and sexual intelligence. Professor Nan B. Adams argues that based on Gardner&#x27;s definition of multiple intelligences, digital intelligence – a meta-intelligence composed of many other identified intelligences and stemmed from human interactions with digital computers – now exists.

== Use in education ==
Within his &quot;Theory of Multiple Intelligences&quot;, Gardner stated that our &quot;educational system is heavily biased towards linguistic modes of intersection and assessment and, to a somewhat lesser degree, toward logical quantities modes as well&quot;. His work went on to shape educational pedagogy and influence relevant policy and legislation across the world; with particular reference to how teachers must assess students&#x27; progress to establish the most effective teaching methods for the individual learner. Gardner&#x27;s research into the field of learning regarding bodily kinesthetic intelligence has resulted in the use of activities that require physical movement and exertion, with students exhibiting a high level of physical intelligence reporting to benefit from &#x27;learning through movement&#x27; in the classroom environment.

Although the distinction between intelligences has been set out in great detail, Gardner opposes the idea of labelling learners to a specific intelligence. Gardner maintains that his theory should &quot;empower learners&quot;, not restrict them to one modality of learning. According to Gardner, an intelligence is &quot;a biopsychological potential to process information that can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture&quot;. According to a 2006 study, each of the domains proposed by Gardner involves a blend of the general &quot;g&quot; factor, cognitive abilities other than &quot;g&quot;, and, in some cases, non-cognitive abilities or personality characteristics.

Gardner defines an intelligence as &quot;bio-psychological potential to process information that can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture&quot;. According to Gardner, there are more ways to do this than just through logical and linguistic intelligence. Gardner believes that the purpose of schooling &quot;should be to develop intelligences and to help people reach vocational and avocational goals that are appropriate to their particular spectrum of intelligences. People who are helped to do so, [he] believe[s], feel more engaged and competent and therefore more inclined to serve society in a constructive way.&quot;

Gardner contends that Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests focus mostly on logical and linguistic intelligence. Upon doing well on these tests, the chances of attending a prestigious college or university increase, which in turn creates contributing members of society. While many students function well in this environment, there are those who do not. Gardner&#x27;s theory argues that students will be better served by a broader vision of education, wherein teachers use different methodologies, exercises and activities to reach all students, not just those who excel at linguistic and logical intelligence. It challenges educators to find &quot;ways that will work for this student learning this topic&quot;.

James Traub&#x27;s article in &quot;The New Republic&quot; notes that Gardner&#x27;s system has not been accepted by most academics in intelligence or teaching. Gardner states that &quot;while Multiple Intelligences theory is consistent with much empirical evidence, it has not been subjected to strong experimental tests ... Within the area of education, the applications of the theory are currently being examined in many projects. Our hunches will have to be revised many times in light of actual classroom experience.&quot;

Jerome Bruner agreed with Gardner that the intelligences were &quot;useful fictions&quot;, and went on to state that &quot;his approach is so far beyond the data-crunching of mental testers that it deserves to be cheered.&quot;

George Miller, a prominent cognitive psychologist, wrote in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; that Gardner&#x27;s argument consisted of &quot;hunch and opinion&quot; and Charles Murray and Richard J. Herrnstein in &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; (1994) called Gardner&#x27;s theory &quot;uniquely devoid of psychometric or other quantitative evidence&quot;.

=== Distinction to learning styles===
The notion of learning styles is problematic, and their educational use is suspect. Gardner has regularly explained the distinction between Theory of multiple intelligences and various learning style models. A big problem is that there are more than 80 different learning styles models so it is difficult to know which model is being referred to when making a comparison or planning instruction. A key difference is that learning styles typically refer to sensory modalities, preferences, personality characteristics, attitudes, and interests while the multiple intelligences are cognitive abilities with defined levels of skill. It is easy to see why they are confused given the popularity of VAK (Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic) and Introversion, Extroversion models. Their names sound alike and they share sensory systems (vision, hearing, physicality) but the eight intelligences are much more than the senses or personal preferences.

While learning style theories are fundamentally different from the eight intelligences, there is a model proposed by Richard Strong and others that integrates a person’s preference with the eight intelligences to produce a descriptive tapestry of a person’s intellectual dispositions. The four styles are Mastery, Understanding, Interpersonal, and Self-Expressive. For the visual-spatial intelligence expressed artistically, a person may have a distinct pattern of preferences for realistic imagery (Mastery), conceptual art (Understanding), portraiture (Interpersonal) or abstract expression (Self-Expressive). This model has not been tested empirically.

=== Talents and aptitudes ===
Intelligences not typically associated with academic achievement have been traditionally delegated to the status of talents or aptitudes—e.g., musical, visual-spatial, kinesthetic and naturalist. Gardner takes issue with this hierarchy because it lowers the importance of these “non-academic” intelligences and devalues their contribution to human thought, individual development and culture. Gardner is fine with calling them all talents (or aptitudes) (including logical-mathematical and linguistic) so long as they are seen to be of equal value.

In spite of its lack of general acceptance in the psychological community, Gardner&#x27;s theory has been adopted by many schools, where it is often conflated with learning styles, and hundreds of books have been written about its applications in education. Some of the applications of Gardner&#x27;s theory have been described as &quot;simplistic&quot; and Gardner himself has said he is &quot;uneasy&quot; with the way his theory has been used in schools. Gardner has denied that multiple intelligences are learning styles and agrees that the idea of learning styles is incoherent and lacking in empirical evidence. Gardner summarizes his approach with three recommendations for educators: individualize the teaching style (to suit the most effective method for each student), pluralize the teaching (teach important materials in multiple ways), and avoid the term &quot;styles&quot; as being confusing.

== Criticism ==
Gardner argues that there is a wide range of cognitive abilities, but that there are only very weak correlations among them. For example, the theory postulates that a child who learns to multiply easily is not necessarily more intelligent than a child who has more difficulty on this task. The child who takes more time to master multiplication may best learn to multiply through a different approach, may excel in a field outside mathematics, or may be looking at and understanding the multiplication process at a fundamentally deeper level.

Intelligence tests and psychometrics have generally found high correlations between different aspects of intelligence, rather than the low correlations which Gardner&#x27;s theory predicts, supporting the prevailing theory of general intelligence rather than multiple intelligences (MI). The theory has been criticized by mainstream psychology for its lack of empirical evidence, and its dependence on subjective judgement.

=== Definition of intelligence ===
A major criticism of the theory is that it is &quot;ad hoc&quot;: that Gardner is not expanding the definition of the word &quot;intelligence&quot;, but rather denies the existence of intelligence as traditionally understood, and instead uses the word &quot;intelligence&quot; where other people have traditionally used words like &quot;ability&quot; and &quot;aptitude&quot;. This practice has been criticized by Robert J. Sternberg, Michael Eysenck, and Sandra Scarr. White (2006) points out that Gardner&#x27;s selection and application of criteria for his &quot;intelligences&quot; is subjective and arbitrary, and that a different researcher would likely have come up with different criteria.

Defenders of MI theory argue that the traditional definition of intelligence is too narrow, and thus a broader definition more accurately reflects the differing ways in which humans think and learn.

Some criticisms arise from the fact that Gardner has not provided a test of his multiple intelligences. He originally defined it as the ability to solve problems that have value in at least one culture, or as something that a student is interested in. He then added a disclaimer that he has no fixed definition, and his classification is more of an artistic judgment than fact:

Generally, linguistic and logical-mathematical abilities are called intelligence, but artistic, musical, athletic, etc. abilities are not. Gardner argues this causes the former to be needlessly aggrandized. Certain critics are wary of this widening of the definition, saying that it ignores &quot;the connotation of intelligence ... [which] has always connoted the kind of thinking skills that makes one successful in school.&quot;

Gardner writes &quot;I balk at the unwarranted assumption that certain human abilities can be arbitrarily singled out as intelligence while others cannot.&quot; Critics hold that given this statement, any interest or ability can be redefined as &quot;intelligence&quot;. Thus, studying intelligence becomes difficult, because it diffuses into the broader concept of ability or talent. Gardner&#x27;s addition of the naturalistic intelligence and conceptions of the existential and moral intelligence are seen as the fruits of this diffusion. Defenders of the MI theory would argue that this is simply a recognition of the broad scope of inherent mental abilities and that such an exhaustive scope by nature defies a one-dimensional classification such as an IQ value.

The theory and definitions have been critiqued by Perry D. Klein as being so unclear as to be tautologous and thus unfalsifiable. Having a high musical ability means being good at music while at the same time being good at music is explained by having high musical ability.

Henri Wallon argues that &quot;We can not distinguish intelligence from its operations&quot;. Yves Richez distinguishes 10 Natural Operating Modes (&quot;Modes Opératoires Naturels – MoON&quot;). Richez&#x27;s studies are premised on a gap between Chinese thought and Western thought. In China, the notion of &quot;being&quot; (self) and the notion of &quot;intelligence&quot; do not exist. These are claimed to be Graeco-Roman inventions derived from Plato. Instead of intelligence, Chinese refers to &quot;operating modes&quot;, which is why Yves Richez does not speak of &quot;intelligence&quot; but of &quot;natural operating modes&quot; (&quot;MoON&quot;).

=== Validity ===
Critics argue that MI cannot be taken seriously as a scientific theory of intelligence for a number of reasons, the most common are given below:

* It is not &quot;scientific&quot; as in a body of knowledge acquired by performing replicated experiments in the laboratory.
* There is conceptual confusion for determining exactly what intelligence is and what it isn’t, e.g., MI conflates personality, talent and learning styles with intelligence. MI does not value reasoning and academic skills.
* There are no empirical, experimental studies using psychometrics to establish validity. The proposed intelligences are not proven to be sufficiently independent to warrant separate identification.
* There is no evidence for educational efficacy and its use may undermine school effectiveness.

=== Neo-Piagetian criticism ===
Andreas Demetriou suggests that theories which overemphasize the autonomy of the domains are as simplistic as the theories that overemphasize the role of general intelligence and ignore the domains. He agrees with Gardner that there are indeed domains of intelligence that are relevantly autonomous of each other. Some of the domains, such as verbal, spatial, mathematical, and social intelligence are identified by most lines of research in psychology. In Demetriou&#x27;s theory, one of the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development, Gardner is criticized for underestimating the effects exerted on the various domains of intelligences by the various subprocesses that define overall processing efficiency, such as speed of processing, executive functions, working memory, and meta-cognitive processes underlying self-awareness and self-regulation. All of these processes are integral components of general intelligence that regulate the functioning and development of different domains of intelligence.

The domains are to a large extent expressions of the condition of the general processes, and may vary because of their constitutional differences but also differences in individual preferences and inclinations. Their functioning both channels and influences the operation of the general processes. Thus, one cannot satisfactorily specify the intelligence of an individual or design effective intervention programs unless both the general processes and the domains of interest are evaluated.

=== Human adaptation to multiple environments ===
The premise of the multiple intelligences hypothesis, that human intelligence is a collection of specialist abilities, have been criticized for not being able to explain human adaptation to most if not all environments in the world. In this context, humans are contrasted to social insects that indeed have a distributed &quot;intelligence&quot; of specialists, and such insects may spread to climates resembling that of their origin but the same species never adapt to a wide range of climates from tropical to temperate by building different types of nests and learning what is edible and what is poisonous. While some such as the leafcutter ant grow fungi on leaves, they do not cultivate different species in different environments with different farming techniques as human agriculture does. It is therefore argued that human adaptability stems from a general ability to falsify hypotheses and make more generally accurate predictions and adapt behavior thereafter, and not a set of specialized abilities which would only work under specific environmental conditions.

=== IQ tests ===
Gardner argues that IQ tests only measure linguistic and logical-mathematical abilities. He argues the importance of assessing in an &quot;intelligence-fair&quot; manner. While traditional paper-and-pen examinations favor linguistic and logical skills, there is a need for intelligence-fair measures that value the distinct modalities of thinking and learning that uniquely define each intelligence.

Psychologist Alan S. Kaufman points out that IQ tests have measured spatial abilities for 70 years. Modern IQ tests are greatly influenced by the Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory which incorporates a general intelligence but also many more narrow abilities. While IQ tests do give an overall IQ score, they now also give scores for many more narrow abilities.

=== Lack of empirical evidence ===
Many of Gardner&#x27;s &quot;intelligences&quot; correlate with the &quot;g&quot; factor, supporting the idea of a single dominant type of intelligence. Each of the domains proposed by Gardner involved a blend of &quot;g&quot;, of cognitive abilities other than &quot;g&quot;, and, in some cases, of non-cognitive abilities or of personality characteristics.

The Johnson O&#x27;Connor Research Foundation has tested hundreds of thousands of people to determine their &quot;aptitudes&quot; (&quot;intelligences&quot;), such as manual dexterity, musical ability, spatial visualization, and memory for numbers. There is correlation of these aptitudes with the &quot;g&quot; factor, but not all are strongly correlated; correlation between the &quot;g&quot; factor and &quot;inductive speed&quot; (&quot;quickness in seeing relationships among separate facts, ideas, or observations&quot;) is only 0.5, considered a moderate correlation.

Linda Gottfredson (2006) has argued that thousands of studies support the importance of intelligence quotient (IQ) in predicting school and job performance, and numerous other life outcomes. In contrast, empirical support for non-&quot;g&quot; intelligences is either lacking or very poor. She argued that despite this, the ideas of multiple non-&quot;g&quot; intelligences are very attractive to many due to the suggestion that everyone can be smart in some way.

A critical review of MI theory argues that there is little empirical evidence to support it:

The same review presents evidence to demonstrate that cognitive neuroscience research does not support the theory of multiple intelligences:

<text>Interstate 83 (I-83) is an Interstate Highway located in the states of Maryland and Pennsylvania in the Eastern United States. Its southern terminus is at a signalized intersection with Fayette Street in Baltimore, Maryland; its northern terminus is at I-81 near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. I-83 runs from Downtown Baltimore north to I-695 near the northern suburb of Timonium on the Jones Falls Expressway before forming a concurrency with I-695. After splitting from I-695, the route follows the Baltimore–Harrisburg Expressway north to the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania. Upon crossing the state line, I-83 becomes the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States Memorial Highway and continues north through York toward the Harrisburg area. The route runs along the southern and eastern portion of the Capital Beltway that encircles Harrisburg before reaching its northern terminus.

Most of the route south of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, is a direct replacement of U.S. Route 111 (US 111), a former spur of US 11.

====Jones Falls Expressway====

The Jones Falls Expressway (JFX) is a freeway that carries I-83 from Downtown Baltimore to the northern suburbs. It is the area&#x27;s true north–south artery because I-95 runs from southwest to northeast through the southern edge of the city. Its southern terminus is at Fayette Street, and its northern terminus is at Maryland Route 25 (MD 25), just north of the Baltimore Beltway (I-695). Inside Baltimore, the road is maintained not by the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA), which controls most freeways in the state, but by the city&#x27;s department of transportation.

The freeway begins at an at-grade, four-way intersection between the JFX, Fayette Street, and President Street, located in close proximity to the Phoenix Shot Tower. President Street continues south along the eastern edge of the central business district (CBD) to terminate at a traffic circle in Inner Harbor East. Fayette Street serves as an access route into the downtown area.

Passing beneath the Orleans Street Viaduct (US 40), the JFX runs north, passing near the Washington Monument. Between exits 3 and 4, there is a 90-degree turn that sometimes requires motorists to slow down just before entering it, with an advisory speed posted at . The curve is located between the Guilford Avenue and Preston Street overpasses. Within the curve, the southbound JFX interchanges with MD 2, with an exit to St. Paul Street and an entrance from Charles Street (MD 139).
Having passed this curve, the JFX begins to parallel MD 25, going under the Howard Street Bridge and interchanging with Maryland Avenue and North Avenue (US 1/US 40 Truck) before continuing north past Druid Lake, forming the northeastern boundary of Druid Hill Park. Running northwest out of the city center, the JFX is paralleled by its namesake river, the Jones Falls, on one side, and the Maryland Transit Administration&#x27;s Baltimore Light RailLink line on the other. Closer to downtown, the light rail line peels off in a different direction, while the falls flows directly underneath the elevated freeway.

After interchanging with Cold Spring Lane and Northern Parkway (between which lies Cylburn Arboretum), the JFX exits Baltimore, entering Baltimore County. Passing close to Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital, Mount Saint Agnes College, and Jones Falls Park, the route skirts the edge of Lake Roland before interchanging with Ruxton Road just south of I-695 (Baltimore Beltway).

At the beltway, I-83 leaves the JFX and joins I-695 for a distance of , where it separates from the latter route to continue onward into northern Maryland. Meanwhile, the JFX continues for another in a four-lane divided format before terminating at an at-grade intersection with MD 25 (Falls Road). I-83 and I-695 split off at the southern terminus of the Baltimore–Harrisburg Expressway, and I-695 continues its eastward trek toward Towson and Parkville.

====Baltimore–Harrisburg Expressway====

After separating from the beltway, I-83 is now known as the Baltimore–Harrisburg Expressway. Running due north away from the beltway, the route parallels MD 45 (York Road), the former route of US 111. Passing to the west of Timonium and Cockeysville, I-83 leaves the suburban belt around Baltimore and enters rural Baltimore County just north of Hunt Valley at Shawan Road. I-83 and MD 45 continue to parallel one another through the northern portion of the county, with MD 45 crossing over I-83 once, at an interchange. This segment of I-83 has several sections with higher than usual gradients.

The only major settlement encountered by I-83 along this stretch is Monkton, reached via MD 137. To the west of I-83, MD 137 connects with the northern terminus of MD 25, I-83&#x27;s former companion to the south.

The Interstate eventually crosses the Mason–Dixon line into York County, Pennsylvania, north of Baltimore, mere feet from a partial interchange with Freeland Road and parallel with MD 45; the latter route becomes the Susquehanna Trail when it reaches Pennsylvania.
===Pennsylvania===

Throughout Pennsylvania, I-83 is named the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States Memorial Highway. I-83 enters Pennsylvania, crossing the Mason–Dixon line and passing to the east of Shrewsbury as it runs due north toward York. The route bypasses the boroughs of Loganville and Jacobus before entering the city of York.

I-83 has a business route through downtown York, known as I-83 Business (I-83 Bus.). The business route follows the former path of US 111, while I-83 turns northeast and then north again to bypass the urban area. Near Pennsylvania Route 462 (PA 462), the Lincoln Highway, the Interstate turns west for a short distance, then north again to an interchange with US 30. Beyond US 30, I-83 resumes its straight path, running due north out of York and passing to the west of Emigsville.

North of PA 297, I-83 is known as the Susquehanna Expressway. It maintains this name as it passes to the south and west of Valley Green, continuing north toward Harrisburg. South of Harrisburg, I-83 has an interchange with I-76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike). North of I-76, I-83 continues due north, passing through New Cumberland, before an interchange with the eastern terminus of PA 581 in Lemoyne.

After the interchange with PA 581, I-83 is known as the Capital Beltway. The highway turns due east and crosses the Susquehanna River over the John Harris Bridge, south of Downtown Harrisburg, passing south of Paxtang before encountering I-283 and US 322 at the Eisenhower Interchange. Within the interchange, I-83 exits from itself, with each direction of traffic following a one-lane ramp; facing east, I-83&#x27;s former lanes become US 322, while, facing north, I-283&#x27;s lanes become I-83. The interchanges includes ramps to local roads as well. From this point northbound to exit 51, traffic is often congested during daylight hours. I-83 and westbound US 322 continue north toward US 22 and I-81, I-283 goes due south toward the turnpike and PA 283&#x27;s western terminus, and eastbound US 322 goes due east toward Hershey.

Beyond this interchange, I-83 and US 322 run due north through the eastern suburbs of Harrisburg, interchanging with US 22 northeast of the CBD in Colonial Park, before I-83 terminates at a three-way semidirectional interchange with I-81. From here, US 322 continues west along I-81 south.

==History==
===Pennsylvania===

I-83 was one of the first Interstate Highways built in Pennsylvania. Much of its routing through the state follows a freeway bypass of the since decommissioned US 111. The route received the I-83 designation in 1960. The first section built (opened 1954) runs from PA 392 in Newberry Township north to PA 114 in Fairview Township. The entire highway was completed in 1971 with the massive Eisenhower Interchange in Harrisburg.

From 2012 to 2015, the I-83/PA 581 interchange outside of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was modified. Formerly, I-83 was reduced to one lane going northbound through the interchange, resulting in frequent traffic jams during peak travel times. The northbound part of the highway was widened, one bridge was replaced, and several exits in the vicinity were reconfigured. A second project started in 2016, with work to be completed from its northern terminus at I-81 to just past the Union Deposit Road interchange. The project, completed in 2022, reconstructed two interchanges and associated overpasses, as well as widened adjacent sections of the highway to six throughlanes.

The interchange with PA 851 near Shrewsbury was reconstructed into a diverging diamond interchange, which opened to traffic on June 28, 2021.

In York, Pennsylvania, a reconstruction of the Mt. Rose Avenue (PA 124) interchange took place from 2015 to 2022 in anticipation of a future widening of I-83 around the east and north sides of the city. Also, studies are being done north of town to help ease traffic in a section heavily traveled by trucks.

On October 23, 2023, work began on a project that will reconstruct the section of I-83 in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, from the John Harris Bridge over the Susquehanna River to the Eisenhower Interchange with I-283 and US 322. The project will be split into two contracts, with the project widening and reconstructing I-83 and rebuilding interchanges. As part of this project, a new interchange will be built with PA 230 (Cameron Street) while the 13th Street interchange will be closed. Construction on both contracts is expected to be finished in 2028.

===Jones Falls Expressway===
The first Interstate to be built in Baltimore was the JFX; the Greater Baltimore Committee pushed to enact legislation from the Baltimore City Council in 1955. It was the first to be constructed due to community opposition to the other planned freeways within the city. The JFX follows the path of the Jones Falls River, a natural corridor that divided the city into eastern and western segments. By the early 1960s, the JFX was completed as far as Guilford Avenue, within the city limits. It was completed as far as Pleasant Street in the downtown area by 1983, but the remaining to I-95 were canceled in September 1982. To compensate for the loss of the remainder of the JFX, the portion in situ was extended to Fayette Street by 1987, and the Jones Falls Boulevard project substantially rebuilt of President Street, across from the JFX at Fayette Street, to allow the traffic to and from the Interstate to be collected and distributed from the surrounding city streets. By 1990, the project was completed.

Due to community opposition to the other freeway plans being produced by city officials, the JFX was the very first limited-access highway to be completed within the city of Baltimore and remained so for several years. Originally, the JFX was to continue through the Southeast Baltimore neighborhoods of Fell&#x27;s Point and Canton to a junction with the then-planned I-95, but opposition from residents of those neighborhoods successfully blocked that proposal. As a result, I-83 became the first Maryland road in the Interstate Highway System.

====Planning====

As part of the planning for an east–west route through Baltimore, the alignment of the JFX underwent various modifications. Under the original plan for freeways in Baltimore, the 1962 &quot;Baltimore 10-D Interstate System&quot;, the JFX would have junctioned I-70N (which became I-70 in 1975) and I-95, which were planned to follow an east–west route through the southern edge of the CBD, near the southeastern edge of the CBD. The JFX would end at roughly the same location where it currently does. As a result of community opposition to other portions of the 10-D System, the 1969 &quot;Baltimore 3-A Interstate and Boulevard System&quot; was adopted by the city. In this plan, the JFX would continue south along its present alignment then turn east and pass through the Fell&#x27;s Point neighborhood on a six-lane elevated viaduct, before continuing east along Boston Street to junction I-95 (which was also rerouted to its current alignment) north of the Fort McHenry Tunnel. In the mid-1970s, this plan was modified due to fears that the viaduct would result in destruction of the Fell&#x27;s Point area, which contains many historic properties. Under the modification, I-83 would continue south and descend into a six-lane underwater tunnel beneath the Inner Harbor, then turn east under the harbor, pass to the south of Fell&#x27;s Point, return to the surface in the Canton area and continue to I-95.

Under this plan, I-83 was expected to act mostly as a northerly spur to and from the CBD and as an easterly spur to and from the CBD; through traffic was expected to be a small proportion of the total amount making use of the route. I-83&#x27;s terminus at I-95 would have been a full three-way freeway-to-freeway interchange, with a full complement of ramps provided for access to and from Boston and O&#x27;Donnell streets. When construction began on I-95 through East Baltimore in the mid-1970s, a short six-lane section was built within the vicinity of the planned I-83 interchange. This was done in anticipation of I-83 connecting the CBD to I-95, the rest of which carries at least eight lanes of traffic throughout the city.

====Truncation====

By 1963, the JFX was completed as far south as Guilford Avenue and, by the mid-1970s, was extended to Monument Street. By 1983, the route extended all the way to Pleasant Street, with a dead-end bridge stub indicating plans to continue south along the 3-A alignment to I-95.

In September 1982, however, the segment of the JFX between Pleasant Street and I-95, a distance of , was officially withdrawn from the Interstate Highway System. Robert Douglas, then the chief of the Interstate Division for Baltimore City (IDBC), stated at the time that the very high financial costs of the I-83 extension (estimated at $609 million in the early 1980s [equivalent to $ in ], and likely to reach $1 billion [equivalent to $ in ] with inflation taken into account) led to the cancelation of the segment. As a result, the JFX was truncated at Fayette Street, ending at an at-grade intersection.

To make up for the loss of the I-83 segment, the Jones Falls Boulevard project substantially rebuilt approximately of President Street between I-83 and the downtown area to provide the capacity to absorb traffic to and from the Interstate; the project was completed by 1987. Other roadways in the canceled I-83 corridor also benefited from major reconstruction and rehabilitation. The federal funding planned to be used for the I-83 extension was instead cross-transferred to other highway projects; routes that may have benefited include I-97, I-195, I-370, and the upgrade of a portion of the John Hanson Highway to I-595.

==Future==

As Congress worked toward reauthorization of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act, the Greater Lynchburg Chamber of Commerce and other groups in Virginia wanted I-83 extended southward to provide bypasses for Charlottesville, Lynchburg, and Danville, and to link those cities to Greensboro, North Carolina. By June 1991, Robert LaLone, director of programs for the Lynchburg Chamber, admitted that an Interstate was unlikely, but upgrading US 29, with bypasses included, is more likely.

The possibility of extending I-83 (rather than I-99) north to Rochester, New York, was discussed at the October 2002 I-99 Task Force meeting. Part of the proposed route on US 11/US 15, however, has since been rebuilt as a four-lane surface road that does not meet Interstate standards. Expensive additional reconstruction, including new interchanges, service roads, and realignments, would be necessary. The farthest north that I-83 could be extended currently would be Benvenue, Pennsylvania, on a bridge over the Susquehanna River, where a recently built freeway section of US 22/US 322 (Dauphin Bypass) downgrades to an undivided four-lane road. Recently, however, the Central Susquehanna Valley Thruway, a freeway project along the proposed corridor near Shamokin Dam, Pennsylvania, has been approved and is under construction as of 2016, with the first section opening in 2022.

In 2005, Walter Sondheim, a prominent Baltimore city planner unveiled a proposal to tear down the elevated portion of the JFX that leads into downtown. In the JFX&#x27;s place, President Street would be extended north to Eager Street, where the elevated section ends. City officials have since offered tentative support for the idea, though it is unlikely that any action will be taken until about 2020, when the current elevated structure will need an overhaul if it is to remain in use. If the downtown JFX were demolished, Baltimore would join San Francisco, Boston, and Milwaukee to become among the large U.S. cities that have removed some of their downtown elevated freeways. On May 17, 2009, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; revealed a plan by Rummel, Klepper &amp; Kahl LLP, to tear down of the JFX to create an urban boulevard that would help connect downtown to the east side of the city and the Johns Hopkins Hospital.

==Exit list==
Exit numbers in Pennsylvania were changed in April 2001 from sequence-based to distance-based.






















==Auxiliary routes==
I-83 has one auxiliary route: I-283, a connector from I-83 south to I-76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) and PA 283 southeast of Harrisburg.

==Business route==

Interstate 83 Business (I-83 Bus.) is a short business loop in York, Pennsylvania. It begins at a semidirectional T interchange with I-83 south of York, continuing north as a freeway for before the freeway ends at a partial interchange with South George Street, with a southbound exit and northbound entrance. The route continues north along George Street through downtown York, intersecting PA 74/PA 462 before leaving the city and intersecting US 30. Here, PA 181 begins and runs north concurrent with I-83 Bus. for a short distance before I-83 Bus. ends at an interchange with I-83. PA 181 continues north past the northern terminus of I-83 Bus.

From its designation in 1961 until the designation of I-376 Bus. in 2009, I-83 Bus. was the only business route of an Interstate Highway in Pennsylvania.

<text>Járnsaxa (; Old Norse: , (&quot;iron dagger&quot;) is a jötunn in Norse mythology. In Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, she is portrayed as Thor&#x27;s lover and as the mother of Magni, a child with supernatural powers.

== Name ==
The Old Norse name &quot;Járnsaxa&quot; has been translated as &#x27;iron dagger&#x27;, or &#x27;armed-with-an-iron-sword&#x27;.

== Attestations ==
In &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;, Járnsaxa is named as one of the Nine Mothers of Heimdallr.

In &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Thor&#x27;s wife the goddess Sif is either herself called &quot;Járnsaxa&quot; or called by a kenning meaning &quot;the rival of Járnsaxa&quot;, throwing confusion on whether Sif is or is not distinct from Járnsaxa the mother of Magni. At the end of the story, Odin argues that Thor did wrong to offer the splendid horse Gullfaxi to Magni, the son of a giantess, rather than to himself, the father of Thor.

<text>Interstate H-2 (H-2, named the Veterans Memorial Freeway) is an intrastate Interstate Highway located on the island of Oʻahu in the U.S. state of Hawaii. The north–south freeway connects H-1 in Pearl City to Mililani and Wahiawa, where it terminates at Route 99 near Schofield Barracks. 

The Interstate System was expanded to Hawaii in 1960 along several corridors, with H-2 assigned to the north–south connection between the Honolulu area and Wahiawa. Construction began in 1971, and the first section opened to traffic on October 3, 1974. The rest of H-2 was completed on February 21, 1977.

==Route description==
H-2 begins at the Waiawa Interchange with H-1 in Pearl City, adjacent to Leeward Community College on the north side of Pearl Harbor. The eight-lane freeway travels north through the residential Waipio neighborhood and intersects Ka Uka Boulevard near several retailers and warehouses. H-2 then turns northeast and follows the Pānakauahi Gulch as it skirts the foothills of the Koʻolau Range, passing a solar farm and undeveloped land. The freeway turns northwest to cross Kipapa Gulch and bisects a residential neighborhood in the city of Mililani, where it intersects Meheula Parkway. The freeway narrows to four lanes as it approaches Wahiawa and turns north to travel around Wheeler Army Airfield. H-2 terminates after an interchange with Route 99, which continues west on Wilikina Drive to Schofield Barracks.

The freeway is maintained by the Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT) and is designated as part of the National Highway System, a network of economically and militarily strategic highways in the U.S. H-2 has a set of high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes between the Waiawa Interchange and Mililani that are active during peak periods on weekdays. Traffic volumes on the highway, measured in terms of annual average daily traffic, ranged in 2020 from a minimum of 36,900 vehicles at its northern terminus to a maximum of 87,900 vehicles at H-1. TheBus, a city-wide bus system, operates several express routes on H-2 between Downtown Honolulu and Wahiawa.

==History==

===Planning and funding===

A set of Interstate Highways on O‘ahu were approved for funding by the U.S. Congress in 1960, a year after Hawaii was admitted as a state. The corridors would connect Honolulu to Naval Air Station Barbers Point to the west, Schofield Barracks to the northwest, Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay to the northeast, and Diamond Head to the southeast. The Bureau of Public Roads (now the Federal Highway Administration) approved &quot;Interstate H-2&quot; as the designation for the Schofield Barracks corridor on August 29, 1960.

The freeway would be built parallel to a section of the Kamehameha Highway, which opened in 1921 to connect Honolulu to the North Shore and the windward side of the island. A set of three general routing options were presented at a public hearing in October 1962, all to be at least four lanes wide except for a section around Wheeler Army Airfield. The easternmost option, with an estimated cost of $29.2 million (equivalent to $ in ) was chosen by officials following feedback from the hearing. Construction of H-2 was scheduled to begin in 1967, but federal funding cuts deferred several Interstate projects on O‘ahu, including the Waiawa Interchange and Kipapa section of H-2.

Following the partial restoration of federal funding, HDOT opened bids in November 1967 on construction of the Waiawa Interchange with H-1. The remainder of H-2 remained indefinitely deferred, along with funding for H-3. The federal government allocated $51 million (equivalent to $ in ) for the entire H-2 project in October 1968, allowing for bidding on other construction contracts to open. The original embankment design of crossings for the Kipapa and Waikakalaua streams near Mililani was later replaced in 1971 with bridges to reduce costs and potential erosion issues. H-2 was described as &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s forgotten freeway&quot; by local newspapers, as its planning was generally uncontroversial compared to other projects, such as H-3, and did not attract the attention of anti-highway activists.

===Construction and later projects===

Construction on the southernmost section of H-2 began in early 1971 with work on the Waiawa Interchange. By June 1973, grading of the Pearl City–Kipapa section of the freeway was nearly complete and contracts for paving and interchange construction were prepared to be released. The remaining projects for H-2, with the exception of the Kipapa Gulch bridge, were contracted by August and under construction by the end of the year. Work on the Waikakalaua Gulch bridge near Mililani began in December 1973, while the Kipapa Gulch bridge began the following year using a cantilevered truss system. Construction on a section of the freeway near Wheeler Army Airfield unearthed the ruins of the Cabrini Chapel, a small church built by Italian prisoners of war housed at Sand Island from 1944 to 1945.

The southernmost section of the freeway, traveling from the Waiawa Interchange with H-1 to the Mililani Cemetery, was completed in early 1974. It was opened to traffic on October 3, 1974, after a temporary road through the cemetery was finished, connecting H-2 to the Kamehameha Highway near the Mililani Town development. Part of the freeway&#x27;s northern terminus at the Wahiawa Interchange opened in October 1975 to allow traffic to bypass a congested left turn on the Kamehameha Highway. The final section of the freeway, including the Kipapa Gulch bridge, opened to traffic on February 21, 1977, after a delay while awaiting delivery of a transformer to control its lights. The entirety of H-2 cost an estimated $43 million (equivalent to $ in ) to construct. The freeway&#x27;s HOV lanes also opened at the same time, having been added to replace an earlier plan for exclusive bus lanes, but were eliminated in January 1979 due to low use.

Construction of the freeway allowed for residential development in the Waipio Valley and around Mililani, which had been designed in conjunction with H-2 in the late 1960s. A pair of sites along the highway were also considered in the 1970s for the second Oʻahu campus of the University of Hawaiʻi, which was ultimately located at Kapolei. A new interchange with Ka Uka Boulevard was opened in July 1989 to serve new development in Waipio. The Mililani Mauka development opened in the 1990s after development closer to the freeway was approved. The Meheula Parkway interchange was rebuilt in 1993 to accommodate expected traffic and H-2 was widened to readd the HOV lanes, which opened in December 1994.

H-2 was designated as the Veterans Memorial Freeway in 2002 by the state government.

<text>Tiw, in Uru (a pre-Incan people) mythology is a protector of mines, lakes, and rivers. It is closely related to the Aymara deity of &quot;Anchanchu&quot;, a terrible demon which haunts caves, rivers, and other isolated places.

It was traditionally honored with the diablada.

<text>Eva Marie Cassidy (February 2, 1963 – November 2, 1996) was an American singer and musician known for her interpretations of jazz, folk, and blues music, sung with a powerful, emotive soprano voice. In 1992, she released her first album, &quot;The Other Side&quot;, a set of duets with go-go musician Chuck Brown, followed by the 1996 live solo album titled &quot;Live at Blues Alley&quot;. Although she had been honored by the Washington Area Music Association, she was virtually unknown outside her native Washington, D.C., at the time of her death from melanoma at the age of 33 in 1996.

Two years after her death, Cassidy&#x27;s music was brought to the attention of British audiences, when her versions of &quot;Fields of Gold&quot; and &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; were played by Mike Harding and Terry Wogan on BBC Radio 2. Following the overwhelming response, a camcorder recording of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, taken at Blues Alley in Washington by her friend Bryan McCulley, was shown on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops 2&quot;. Shortly afterwards, the compilation album &quot;Songbird&quot; climbed to the top of the UK Albums Chart, almost three years after its initial release. The chart success in the United Kingdom and Ireland led to increased recognition of Cassidy worldwide. Her posthumously released recordings, including three number-one albums and one number-one single in the UK, have sold more than ten million copies. Her music has also charted within the top 10 in Australia, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.

In total, nine posthumous albums have been released. The most recent, &quot;I Can Only Be Me&quot;, a collaboration with the London Symphony Orchestra, was released in 2023 and charted at number 9 on the UK album chart.

==Early life==
Born on February 2, 1963, at the Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C., Cassidy grew up in Oxon Hill, Maryland, and later Bowie, Maryland. She was the third of four children. Her father, Hugh Cassidy, is a teacher, sculptor, musician, former army medic, and world champion powerlifter of Irish and Scottish descent, while her mother, Barbara (&quot;née&quot; Kratzer), is a German horticulturist from Bad Kreuznach. From an early age, Cassidy displayed an interest in art and music. When she was nine, her father began teaching her to play the guitar, and she began to play and sing at family gatherings.

At age 11, Cassidy began singing and playing guitar in a Washington-area band called Easy Street. The band performed in a variety of styles at weddings, corporate parties, and pubs. Due to her shyness, she struggled with performing in front of strangers. While a student at Bowie High School, she sang with a local band called Stonehenge. During the summer of 1983, Cassidy sang and played guitar six days a week at the theme park Wild World. Her younger brother Dan, a fiddler, was also a member of this working band. She enrolled in art classes at Prince George&#x27;s Community College but dropped out after finding them unhelpful.

Throughout the 1980s, Cassidy worked with several other bands, including the techno-pop band Characters Without Names. During this period, she also worked as a propagator at a plant nursery and as a furniture painter. In her free time, she explored other artistic expressions including painting, sculpting, and jewelry design.

==Music career==
In 1986, Cassidy was asked by Stonehenge guitarist and high school friend, David Lourim, to lend her voice to his music project, Method Actor. This brought her to Black Pond Studios, where she met recording engineer and bassist Chris Biondo. Biondo helped her find work as a session singer and later introduced her to Al Dale, who would become her manager. She sang back-ups for various acts, from go-go rhythm and blues band Experience Unlimited to rapper E-40. Biondo and Cassidy, who were in a romantic relationship for a time, formed the five-piece &quot;Eva Cassidy Band&quot; with Lenny Williams, Keith Grimes, and Raice McLeod in 1990. They began to perform frequently in the Washington area.
In 1992, Biondo played a tape of Cassidy&#x27;s voice for Chuck Brown, the &quot;Godfather of go-go&quot;. It resulted in the duet album &quot;The Other Side&quot; featuring performances of classic songs such as &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;God Bless the Child&quot;, and what would later become Cassidy&#x27;s signature song, &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;. The album was released and distributed in 1992 by Liaison Records, the label that also released Brown&#x27;s go-go albums. Brown originally intended to record an additional duet with Cassidy for his next solo album, but this was postponed due to ongoing negotiations between Dale and other labels for a solo deal. Cassidy&#x27;s unwillingness to narrow her stylistic focus to one genre hindered her chances of securing a deal. After talks broke down, the two decided to record their own duet album. As a duo, they performed at the Columbia Arts Festival and opened for acts like Al Green and The Neville Brothers.
In 1993, Cassidy was honored by the Washington Area Music Association with a Wammie award for the &quot;Vocalist Jazz/Traditional&quot; category. The next year she was invited to perform at the event and chose to sing &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;. &quot;The Washington Times&quot; review of the event called her performance &quot;a show-stopper&quot;. She took home two Wammies that night, again for &quot;Vocalist Jazz/Traditional&quot; and also for &quot;Roots Rock/Traditional R&amp;B&quot;. For a brief period that year, Cassidy signed a deal with Blue Note Records to pair up with pop-jazz band Pieces of a Dream to release an album and tour the country. She sang two tracks on a mainly instrumental album. It was a musically unsatisfying experience for her.

After having a potential contract with Apollo Records collapse when the label went bankrupt, Biondo and Dale decided that she should release her own live album. On January 2–3, 1996, the material for &quot;Live at Blues Alley&quot; was recorded at Blues Alley in Washington, D.C. Due to a technical glitch on the first night of recording, only the second night&#x27;s recording was usable, with 12 songs released on the resulting album. (The complete set of 31 songs recorded that night was eventually released 20 years later as &quot;Nightbird&quot; in 2015.) Unhappy with the way she sounded due to a cold, she was reluctant to release the album. She eventually relented, on the condition that the studio track &quot;Oh, Had I a Golden Thread&quot;, Cassidy&#x27;s favorite song, would be included in the release, and that they start working on a follow-up studio album. Her apprehension appeared unfounded as local reviewers and the public responded positively. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; commented that &quot;she could sing anything — folk, blues, pop, jazz, R&amp;B, gospel — and make it sound like it was the only music that mattered.&quot; The subsequent studio album she worked on was released posthumously as &quot;Eva by Heart&quot; in 1997. In the liner notes of &quot;Eva by Heart&quot;, music critic Joel E. Siegel described Cassidy as &quot;one of the greatest voices of her generation.&quot;

==Personal life==
Cassidy had a relationship with Chris Biondo, but this had ended before her cancer diagnosis.

==Illness and death==
In 1993, Cassidy had a malignant mole removed from her back. Three years later, during a promotional event for the &quot;Live at Blues Alley&quot; album in July 1996, Cassidy noticed an ache in her hips, which she attributed to stiffness from painting murals while perched atop a stepladder. The pain persisted and X-rays revealed a fracture. Further tests found that the cancer had spread (metastasized) to her bones, causing the fracture, as well as issues inside her lungs. Her doctors estimated she had three to five months to live. Cassidy opted for aggressive treatment, but her health deteriorated rapidly. 

On September 17, 1996, at a benefit concert for her at The Bayou, she made her final public appearance, closing the set with &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; in front of an audience of family, friends, and fans. Additional chemotherapy was ineffective, and Cassidy died of melanoma on November 2, 1996, at her family&#x27;s home in Bowie, Maryland. In accordance with her wishes, her body was cremated and the ashes were scattered on the lake shores of St. Mary&#x27;s River Watershed Park, a nature reserve near Callaway, Maryland.

==Posthumous recognition==
After Cassidy&#x27;s death, local folk singer Grace Griffith introduced the Blues Alley recording to Bill Straw from her label, Blix Street Records. Straw approached the Cassidy family to put together a new album. In 1998, a compilation of tracks from Cassidy&#x27;s three released recordings was assembled into the CD &quot;Songbird&quot;. This CD lingered in relative obscurity for two years until being given airplay by BBC Radio 2, firstly by Paul Jones then by Mike Harding but most famously by Terry Wogan on his wide-reaching show &quot;Wake Up to Wogan&quot;, following recommendation by his producer Paul Walters. The album sold more than 100,000 copies in the following months. &quot;The New York Times&quot; spoke of her &quot;silken soprano voice with a wide and seemingly effortless range, unerring pitch and a gift for phrasing that at times was heart-stoppingly eloquent.&quot;

Before Christmas of 2000, BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops 2&quot; aired a video of Cassidy performing &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, which resulted in &quot;Songbird&quot; climbing steadily up the UK charts over the next few weeks. Just as ITV&#x27;s &quot;Tonight with Trevor McDonald&quot; aired a feature on Cassidy, the album topped the chart. Shot at Blues Alley by a friend with a camcorder the same night the album was recorded, the video became the most requested video ever shown on &quot;Top Of The Pops 2&quot;. Alexis Petridis in &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;There&#x27;s an undeniable emotional appeal in hearing an artist who you know died in obscurity singing a song about hope and a mystical world beyond everyday life&quot;.

Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton were among her new-found fans. Jazz critic Ted Gioia writes, &quot;you might be tempted to write off the &#x27;Cassidy sensation&#x27; ... as a response to the sad story of the singer&#x27;s abbreviated life rather than as a measure of her artistry. But don&#x27;t be mistaken, Cassidy was a huge talent, whose obscurity during her lifetime was almost as much a tragedy as her early death.&quot; &quot;Songbird&quot; has since achieved significant chart success in Europe. It is certified six times platinum in the UK with 1,840,000 copies sold. Although still relatively unknown in the US at that time, the album would eventually be certified gold there as well.
In May 2001, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot; in the US broadcast a well-received short documentary about Cassidy, a labor of love from &quot;Nightline&quot; correspondent Dave Marash who was a fan of her music. Over the weekend, all five of Cassidy&#x27;s albums occupied Amazon.com&#x27;s best sellers list top spots. The &quot;Nightline&quot; episode has since been rebroadcast three times due to popular demand and producer Leroy Sievers has said that it is &quot;probably the most popular Nightline ever&quot;. In December, a nine-minute segment on NPR resulted in a similar sales surge, with five of the top seven spots going to Cassidy. In Britain a rebroadcast of &quot;Tonight with Trevor McDonald&quot; bumped up sales.

Since &quot;Songbird&quot;, several other CDs with original material have been released: &quot;Time After Time&quot; (2000), &quot;Imagine&quot; (2002) and &quot;American Tune&quot; (2003). 

Cassidy&#x27;s cover of &quot;Time After Time&quot; was featured on the 2003 soundtrack CD of the popular superhero television series Smallville. 

Together with word of mouth and internet fan sites, online commerce has played a large role in Cassidy&#x27;s success. This point was further affirmed when in 2005, Amazon.com released a list of its top 25 best-selling musicians, which placed Cassidy in fifth position, behind the Beatles, U2, Norah Jones and Diana Krall.

In 2008, another new album, &quot;Somewhere&quot;, was released. Unlike previous albums, which consisted solely of cover songs, this release contained two original songs co-written by Cassidy. An acoustic album, &quot;Simply Eva&quot;, was released in January 2011.

In March 2023, the album &quot;I Can Only Be Me&quot; was released, which featured new orchestrations by the London Symphony Orchestra. The album debuted at number 9 on the UK Official Albums Chart. In an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, Cassidy&#x27;s former bandmate and arranger Chris Biondo shared, &quot;Eva had a fantasy of one day having a full orchestra back her up [...] to her, that was the greatest place you could be musically.&quot; Audio restoration technology developed by filmmaker Peter Jackson was used to strip Cassidy&#x27;s voice from her original recordings, with the orchestrations being produced in 2021.

==Unofficial releases==
A collection of previously unreleased studio recordings from 1987 to 1991, was released in 2000 as &quot;No Boundaries&quot;. This release was not endorsed by the Cassidy family and was released under a different label. An AllMusic review of the album stated that even &quot;a gifted vocalist like Eva Cassidy can only do so much with bad material&quot;.

In 2002, the self-titled 1988 album by the band Method Actor, which featured Cassidy, was re-released by the band&#x27;s guitarist and producer David Lourim with Cassidy&#x27;s name displayed prominently on the cover. The Cassidy family and Blix Street Records filed a lawsuit against Lourim, claiming that Cassidy&#x27;s name was used in a misleading fashion and that Blix Street has exclusive rights to her recordings. Lourim had Cassidy&#x27;s written permission to release the album, and eventually the cover was changed to look like the original LP album while already released copies were affixed with a sticker indicating that they are not solo Eva Cassidy albums.

A bootleg recording that has been in circulation is called &quot;Live at Pearl&#x27;s&quot;. It was recorded at Pearl&#x27;s Restaurant in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1994. Copies of the recording were circulated among friends and family after her death. Some of the songs on the recording are also on &quot;Imagine&quot; and &quot;American Tune&quot;. Another recording from the early &#x27;90s, featuring Mick Fleetwood on drums and recorded at his restaurant (named Fleetwood&#x27;s) in Alexandria, Virginia, was in the possession of writer/musician Niki Lee, the former wife of pianist Lenny Williams, 1988–1996. Lee discovered it in her garage and attempted to sell it on eBay in 2008 for 250,000 pounds (around US$491,249 at that time; ~$659,650 in 2022 terms). She asserts that she converted the dollars to pounds incorrectly and was lambasted by Cassidy fans for her mistake. Lee decided to sell the recording to a private buyer as the copyright holder, Blix Street Records, refused to release recordings owned by Cassidy&#x27;s friends, which is still the case as of 2024. Blix Street threatens lawsuits to anyone who tries to release previously unreleased tracks. 

To mark the 20th anniversary of the Blues Alley concert, Blix Street Records released &quot;Nightbird&quot;, a 32-track double CD album, in November 2015. &quot;Nightbird&quot; comprises the complete Blues Alley concert recordings, including eight previously unreleased songs, from the night of January 3, 1996. The European version of the CD package also includes a DVD including 12 video performances from the Blues Alley concert. &quot;Nightbird&quot; was also released as a four-LP vinyl package worldwide.

==Legacy==
In 2001, &quot;Songbird: Eva Cassidy: Her Story By Those Who Knew Her&quot;, a book on the life and work of Cassidy based on interviews with close family and associates, was released in the UK. A US edition published by Gotham Books was released in late 2003 and includes two additional chapters on her influences and success in the US. Her life story has also been adapted into a musical and also a Broadway piece for cancer benefit.

A number of filmmakers have proposed films based on Cassidy&#x27;s life and have worked with her family to greater or lesser degrees, but to date none of these projects have progressed past the early development stages. In late 2007, AIR Productions acquired the rights to produce a film based on Cassidy&#x27;s life, being produced by Amy Redford (daughter of actor/director Robert Redford), Irwin Shapiro and Rick Singer. In an interview a year earlier, Cassidy&#x27;s parents suggested Kirsten Dunst and Emily Watson as possible actresses who could play their daughter.

<text>One of the most common ways for chess historians to trace when the board game chess entered a country is to look at the literature of that country. Although due to the names associated with chess sometimes being used for more than one game (for instance Xiang-qi in China and Tables in England), the only certain reference to chess is often several hundred years later than uncertain earlier references. The following list contains the earliest references to chess or chess-like games.

==Byzantium==

a. 923 – at-Tabari&#x27;s Kitab akhbar ar-rusul wal-muluk
(note the work is an Arabic work, no early Greek works are known)

==China==

79 BC – 8 BC – lifetime of Liu Xiang 劉 向, who wrote &quot;Shuo yuan&quot;, a compilation of early Confucian anecdotes: &quot;Do you still feel like playing xiangqi and dancing?&quot;. The rules of the game are not described in this text, so the ambiguity regarding which game it refers to is unresolved. &quot;Xiangqi&quot;, apart from being the name of the chess variant played in China, has also been the name of two other unrelated games, and there is no scholarly consensus about it being a precursor to Chaturanga.

c. 900 AD – Huan Kwai Lu (&quot;Book of Marvels&quot;)
Describes the rules of xiangqi.

==England==

c. 1180 – Alexander Neckam&#x27;s De Natura Rerum
(note that it is thought that Neckam may have learnt of chess in Italy, not in England)

==France==

a. 1127 – A song of Guilhem IX Count of Poitiers and Duke of Aquitaine.

==Germany==

c. 1070 – Ruodlieb (IV 184–188) thought to be written by a monk near Tegernsee.

==India==
c. 500 AD – Subandhu&#x27;s Vasavadatta
:&quot;The time of the rains played its game with frogs for chessmen which yellow and green in color, as if mottled by lac, leapt up on the black field squares.&quot;

c. 625 – Banabhatta&#x27;s Harsha Charitha
:&quot;Under this monarch, only the bees quarreled to collect the dew;  the only feet cut off were those of measurements, and only from Ashtâpada one could learn how to draw up a Chaturanga, there were no cutting off the four limbs of condemned criminals...&quot;

c. 1030 – Al-Biruni&#x27;s India describes the game of chaturaji.

1148 – Kalhana&#x27;s Rajatarangini (translated by MA Stein, 1900)
:&quot;The King, though he had taken two kings (Lothana and Vigraharaja) was helpless and perplexed about the attack on the remaining one, just as a player of chess (who has taken two Kings and is perplexed about taking a third).&quot;
:(Note: This refers to the game of chaturaji.)

==Italy==
c. 1061 or 1062 – Letter from Petrus Damiani (Cardinal Bishop of Ostia) to the Pope-elect Alexander II and the Archdeacon Hildebrand. This letter is dated by the reference to Alexander as &quot;Pope-elect&quot;.

==Persia==

c. 600 – Karnamak-i-Artakhshatr-i-Papakan
:&quot;Artakhshir did this, and by God&#x27;s help he became doughtier and more skilled than them all in ball-play, in horsemanship, in chess, in hunting and in all other accomplishments.&quot;
(It is fairly certain chess is meant due to the word shatranj being used).

==Russia==

13th century – Kormchaya Kniga, a set of church laws.

==Spain==

c. 1007 or 1008 – will of Ermengol I (Count of Urgell)
:&quot;I order you, my executors, to give . . . these my chessmen to the convent of St. Giles, for the work of the church.&quot;

==Sumatra==

c. 1620 – Sejarah Malayu
: &quot;Now this Tan Bahra was a very skillful chessplayer, and one that was unequalled at the game in that age, and he played at chess with the men of Malacca.&quot;

==Switzerland==

c. 997 – &quot;Versus de scachis&quot; in manuscript 319 at Stiftsbibliothek Einsiedeln: A didactic poem written in Medieval Latin where the first reference to chess in a European text can be found, as well as the first mention of a checkerboard and a queen.

<doc id="89023" wikidata="Q340072" url="?curid=89023" title="Interstate H-3">
<text>Interstate H-3 (H-3) is an Interstate Highway located entirely within the US state of Hawaii on the island of Oʻahu. H-3 is also known as the John A. Burns Freeway, after the second governor of Hawaii. It crosses the Koʻolau Range along several viaducts and through the Tetsuo Harano Tunnels as well as the much smaller Hospital Rock Tunnels.

Despite the number, signage is that of an east–west highway. Its western terminus is at an interchange with H-1 at Halawa near Pearl Harbor. Its eastern end is at the main gate of Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH). This route satisfies the national defense purpose of connecting MCBH with the US Navy port at Pearl Harbor off H-1.

Orders for the freeway were granted in 1960, followed by planning stages. Construction, amid enormous community protest, was begun in the late 1980s, although the road did not open until December 12, 1997. Environmental complaints and legal challenges halted construction at many points. Construction resumed during the late 1980s after a move by US Senator Daniel Inouye, who, in 1986, had the freeway exempted from most environmental laws as a rider on a Department of Defense budget bill.

H-3 was the most expensive Interstate Highway ever built, on a cost-per-mile basis. Its final cost was $1.3 billion (equivalent to $ in ), or approximately $80 million per mile (/km; equivalent to $ per mile [/km] in ).

==Route description==
H-3 begins northwest of Downtown Honolulu at the Halawa Interchange with H-1 and auxiliary route H-201. The interchange is adjacent to Aloha Stadium and northeast of Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam, which includes Pearl Harbor National Memorial. H-3 has direct access to H-1, which continues south to Daniel K. Inouye International Airport and west toward Pearl City, and an onramp from the Aloha Stadium parking lot. The freeway travels east along Hālawa Stream and parallel to H-201, which it intersects near Salt Lake. H-3 then turns northeast and heads toward Koʻolau Range by following Hālawa Valley.

The freeway then runs on Windward Viaducts through Hālawa Valley for about until it reaches the Tetsuo Harano Tunnels through Koʻolau Range. Once on the eastern end of the tunnel, the freeway follows a viaduct built along the side of Haʻikū Valley until the Kaneohe Interchange with Route 63 (Likelike Highway) which leads into the town of Kāneʻohe. The freeway then continues past the Kaneohe Interchange to the Halekou Interchange with Route 83 (Kamehameha Highway) and from there to the Kauila interchange with Route 65 (Mokapu Saddle Road) and the Mokapu Interchange serving Kaneohe Bay Drive. After the Mokapu Interchange, H-3 spans a causeway between Kāneʻohe Bay and Nuʻupia Pond and ends at the main gate of MCBH.

==History==
A set of Interstate Highways on Oʻahu were approved for funding by the US Congress in 1960, a year after Hawaii was admitted as a state. A corridor connecting the Honolulu area to Kāneʻohe was included in the plan and was designated as &quot;Interstate H-3&quot; by the Bureau of Public Roads (now the Federal Highway Administration) on August 29, 1960.

Since its inception, the H-3 freeway has been mired in controversy. The original route was not set to be in current Hālawa Valley, but rather, the nearest major valley due east, in the Moanalua ahupuaʻa. The Damon family hurried to create the Moanalua Gardens Foundation in 1970 to join the forces of all political and cultural groups who opposed the freeway&#x27;s construction through their tract of land. The foundation&#x27;s pinnacle no-build argument was the need to remove a significant historical stone containing ancient petroglyphs, Pohaku ka Luahine, which, to this day, stands intact along the Moanalua valley trail. Success came their way as this freeway route was dropped, but H-3 would merely be rerouted.
Kānaka Maoli (Native Hawaiian) cultural practitioners continue to call for the highway&#x27;s removal since it runs through an area of extreme cultural significance. The Bishop Museum, which did the historical and archeological research, has published extensive reports that generally ascribe lower cultural significance to these sites relative to other sites in Hawaii. Many contend that the freeway is &quot;cursed&quot; due to its destruction of religious sites and is therefore harmful even to those who traverse it. 

Ongoing environmental concerns include weed encroachment, light pollution, asbestos pollution, water and streamlife problems, and a host of other concerns; among these are the ongoing decline of native owls called pueo and other native birds. For example, the Oʻahu ʻalauahio (&quot;Paroreomyza maculata&quot;), whose last known home was Halawa, has had no sightings since H-3 construction was completed.

Some longtime residents of Koʻolaupoko and other East Shore communities continue to object to the freeway&#x27;s developmental impacts on their communities. Among their primary fears are urbanization on the scale of Honolulu via the freeway, which has the potential to bring heavy traffic and growth into their traditionally quiet neighborhoods, as well as affecting the value of their homes in the relatively rural (until recently) communities.

Conversely, this road is considered an engineering wonder by its admirers. It is often compared to various cinematic landscapes in &quot;Star Wars&quot; and other movies, and it does sometimes reduce travel time for cross-island commuters, which has allowed for increased real estate development and prices in windward Oʻahu.

One anecdote relates to the elevated section passing through Haʻikū Valley. In this valley, the viaduct passed beneath the antenna of a US Coast Guard radio transmission facility. It was thought that the energy field from the antenna could interfere with heart pacemakers—a potential detriment to drivers and passengers on the roadway. A giant metal cage was designed to surround the roadway through the valley. Before H-3 was opened, the US Coast Guard closed their transmitting facility, obviating the need for the cage. Although the full cage was never built, buried within the roadway was the bottom of the cage. HDOT decided to not construct this steel mesh prior to opening of the freeway.

In September 2020, a section of the H-3 freeway (the Tetsuo Harano Tunnel) was closed for two days to serve as a COVID-19 surge testing site for up to 10,000 people. The freeway was selected to allow for long queuing lanes leading up to testing stations at the Kaneohe and Halawa tunnel portals.

<text>Ussé is a castle in the Indre-et-Loire &quot;département&quot;, in France. The stronghold at the edge of the Chinon forest overlooking the Indre Valley was first fortified in the eleventh century by the Norman &quot;seigneur&quot; of Ussé, Gueldin de Saumur, who surrounded the fort with a palisade on a high terrace. The site passed to the Comte de Blois, who rebuilt it in stone.

In the fifteenth century, the ruined castle of Ussé was purchased by Jean V de Bueil, a captain-general of Charles VII who became seigneur of Ussé in 1431 and began rebuilding it in the 1440s; his son Antoine de Bueil married in 1462 Jeanne de Valois, the biological daughter of Charles VII and Agnès Sorel, who brought as dowry 40000 golden écus. Antoine was heavily in debt and in 1455, sold the château to Jacques d’Espinay, son of a chamberlain to the Duke of Brittany and himself chamberlain to the king; Espinay built the chapel, completed by his son Charles in 1612, in which the Flamboyant Gothic style is mixed with new Renaissance motifs, and began the process of rebuilding the fifteenth-century château that resulted in the sixteenth-seventeenth century aspect of the structure to be seen today. 

In the seventeenth century Louis I de Valentinay, comptroller of the royal household, demolished the north range of buildings in order to open the interior court to the views over the parterre terrace, to a design ascribed to André Le Nôtre. Valentinay&#x27;s son-in-law was the military engineer Vauban, who visited Ussé on numerous occasions.

Charles Perrault, author of the versions of several of the most famous fairy tales known today, often visited the castle and was a guest there. He had the castle of Ussé in mind when writing &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;.

Later, the castle passed to the Rohan. In 1802 Ussé was purchased by the duc de Duras; as early as March 1813, low-key meetings were held at Ussé among a group of Bourbon loyalists, who met to sound out the possibilities of a Bourbon Restoration: such men as Trémouille, duc de Fitzjames, the prince de Polignac, Ferrand, Montmorency and the duc de Rochefoucault attended. Here later François-René de Chateaubriand worked on his &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;Outre-Tombe&quot; as the guest of duchesse Claire de Duras.

In 1885 the comtesse de la Rochejaquelein bequeathed Ussé to her great-nephew, the comte de Blacas. Today the château belongs to his descendant Casimir de Blacas d&#x27; Aulps the 7th Duke of Blacas.

Famed for its picturesque aspect, Ussé was the subject of a French railroad poster issued by the Chemin de Fer de Paris à Orléans in the 1920s and was one of several that inspired Walt Disney in the creation of many of the Disney Castles.

Ussé was classified as a &quot;monument historique&quot; in 1931 by the French Ministry of Culture.

<doc id="89028" wikidata="Q94704" url="?curid=89028" title="Dievturība">
<text>Dievturība is a contemporary continuation of the ethnic religion of the Latvians from what it was before Christianization in the 13th century. Adherents call themselves Dievturi (singular: Dievturis), literally &quot;Dievs&#x27; keepers&quot;, &quot;people who live in harmony with Dievs&quot;. Dievturība is mainly rooted in Latvian folklore, folk songs and Latvian mythology.

Dievturība was systematized in 1925 by Ernests Brastiņš and Kārlis Bregžis. It was forcibly suppressed by Soviets in 1940, but lived on in émigré communities and was re-registered in Latvia in 1990. In 2016, a social media survey found that 20% of Latvians identified their religious affiliation as &quot;Latvian religion.&quot; Of those 20%, 81% who declared themselves “dievturis”, 1% “Dievs, Laima, Māra – folk religion”, 9% “latviskā dzīvesziņa (‘Latvian worldview’)”, 6% “a Latvian”, 2% “Latvian ancient belief”, 1% “officially Lutheran but heart-wise Dievturis”).

Dievturība primarily exists in Latvia but there are also congregations of adherents in the United States, including the Dievsēta, a property in rural Wisconsin where Dievturi holidays and celebrations take place.

==History==
===The era of Ernests Brastiņš===

Dievturība&#x27;s cultural inheritance can be traced to the New Latvians () movement, which began to collect folklore during the First Latvian National Awakening in the 19th century, and fought for Latvian independence during World War I. The Dievturība movement was initiated in 1925 when Ernests Brastiņš and Kārlis Bregžis published a manifesto, &quot;Latviešu dievturības atjaunojums&quot; (). In 1926 they founded the organisation &quot;Latvju dievtur̦u draudze&quot; (). The two had different ideas about the movement: Bregžis favoured an intimate practice, limited to the family or a small community, whereas Brastiņš was in favour of political involvement, wanted to attract large numbers of people, was an effective organiser and public speaker and was not shy about making categorical statements. Bregžis had signed the registration document for the original organisation, and Brastiņš registered his own parallel organisation already in 1927. After 1929, Dievturība largely became associated with Brastiņš&#x27; name.
Bregžis&#x27; organisation ceased to exist in the early 1930s, but Brastiņš&#x27; &quot;Latvijas Dievturu sadraudze&quot; continued to operate, even when it was forced to re-register as a secular organisation in 1935. Brastiņš (1892–1942) thus became the primary force in the early development of Dievturība. He was an artist, an amateur historian, a folklorist and an archaeologist. He documented many ancient Latvian structures and wrote the &quot;Index of Mythological Notions of Latvian Dainas&quot;. His &quot;Dievtur̦u cerokslis&quot; (, 1932) became the main inspirational text of Dievturība. Other important ideological leaders in the interwar period were Arvīds Brastiņš, a sculptor and brother of Ernests, and Alfrēds Goba, a literature historian and critic.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the movement attracted several public figures from the cultural sphere, such as the painter Jēkabs Bīne, the writers Voldemārs Dambergs, Viktors Eglītis and Juris Kosa, and the composers and Artūrs Salaks. It failed to attain any widespread popular following, but through the presence of artists and intellectuals, it managed to produce a substantial amount of material on the interpretation of folklore. From 1933 to 1940, the &quot;Latvijas Dievturu sadraudze&quot; published the magazine &quot;Labietis&quot; (&quot;The nobleman&quot;). Norvilis, Salaks and the composer and conductor Valdemārs Ozoliņš established a small music scene, focused on &quot;kokles&quot;, &quot;trīdeksnis&quot; and choral music. They arranged folk songs for celebrations and composed original music inspired by the movement&#x27;s principles.

===Suppression and émigré activities===

With the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940, the movement was suppressed and scattered. Ernests Brastiņš was deported to a Soviet labour camp in 1941 and executed in 1942, and other leaders were deported to Siberia or emigrated to the West.

During the Soviet era, the movement primarily lived on in small groups within the Latvian émigré communities. In addition to some early activity in Germany and Sweden, the most defining Dievturi activity during this period took place in the United States, where Arvīds Brastiņš in 1947 established himself as the movement&#x27;s Grand Leader (&quot;dižvadonis&quot;), a position he held until his death in 1984. The journal &quot;Labietis&quot; was relaunched in 1955 in Lincoln, Nebraska, the movement was incorporated in 1971 as the Latvian Church Dievturi based in Illinois, and a church complex, named Dievsēta (), was built in Wisconsin beginning in 1977. The exile movement was not always explicitly religious and worked more generally to sustain and promote Latvian culture among the emigrant communities. After Arvīds Brastiņš, the exile church was led by Jānis Palieps (1985–1990), Marģers Grīns (1990–1995), Juris Kᶅaviņš (1995–2000) and Palieps again (2000–?).

In the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic, some outer signs and symbols from the movement continued to appear at weddings and funerals of people associated with or interested in the movement. In 1983, there were reports of a Soviet crackdown on Dievturība, as there were people in the Latvian dissident milieu who were interested in the religion, such as the activist Ints Cālītis and the poet . The approach of the Soviet authorities was to accuse those associated with Dievturība of Nazi activities.

===Revival===

Works to revive the movement in Latvia began in 1986 as part of an emerging new interest in Latvian history and folklore. The main driving force at this stage was the ceramist Eduards Detlavs (1919–1992). Dievturība was officially re-registered as a religious organization on 18 April 1990, under the name &quot;&quot; (abbreviated LDS). After Detlavs&#x27; death in 1992, the LDS was led by Marģers Grīns from the exile Dievturi church until 1995, then by Jānis Brikmanis until 1998, and after that by Romāns Pussars.

In the 1990s, Dievturība in Latvia became strongly influenced by returning members of the émigré movement. These generally favoured a strict adherence to the writings of Ernests Brastiņš, which sometimes was in conflict with the interests of younger neopagans, and some of the people who had been interested in the movement in the 1980s left. The movement was nevertheless able to renew its activities and become a part of the European cultural neopagan current. At the beginning of the 2000s, there were 16 active groups in Latvia. Most of them were gathered under the LDS but some were independent. Among the points of disagreement within the movement are to what extent the material from the interwar era should be followed, and what the relationship should be between Dievturība and Christianity, with some adherents arguing that the two can be combined.

The Svēte Shrine as the main sacred site in Southern Latvia since 2001 holds Dievturi rituals in Jelgava. The Lokstene Shrine of Dievturi was inaugurated on May 6, 2017 and is operated by the LDS. It was financed by the entrepreneur Dagnis Čākurs and is located on a small island in the Daugava river, close to the town Pļaviņas.

As of 2018, the LDS consisted of a board and eight local groups. The total number of organized Dievturi was approximated to between 600 and 800 people. The Grand Leader of the LDS was Andrejs Broks. The honorary chairman and president of the council was the artist Valdis Celms, who also has had an impact on Baltic spiritual communities with his books &#x27; (, 2008) and &#x27; (, 2016).

Since 2023, the Latvijas Dievturu sadraudze has been developing the Dievturi Dictionary (&quot;Dievturu vārdnīca&quot;), an open access online resource for students and scholars focusing on Dievturība and Latvian traditional culture and religious studies.

==Beliefs==

Dievturība is primarily rooted in Latvian folklore, folk songs and Latvian mythology. The main god is Dievs, who unifies spirit and matter, as well as other dualities such as father and mother or good and bad. Other deities are either aspects of Dievs or other types of non-deified spirits. The goddess Māra represents Dievs&#x27; material aspect. Laima is an aspect of Dievs, and connected to causality, fire and fortune.

By necessity, modern Dievturība differs from the historical Latvian religion. For example, there is no evidence that the Latvian pagans recognized a trinity of deities; in Dievturība, Dievs, Māra and Laima are a triune godhead. In Dievturi theology, several triumvirates of deities and concepts are recognized.

Humans are believed to be naturally good due to the will of Dievs. The human is also understood as threefold, and consists of &#x27; – physical body, &#x27; – ancestral spirit, and &#x27; – soul. After death, the physical body is destroyed, the astral body enters the &#x27; (world of shadows) and gradually disappears, and the soul is eternal and unifies with Dievs.

The end of autumn and the start of winter is accepted as the time of remembrance of dead ancestors. In the dark time of autumn, people gave food for their dead relatives due to the &quot;dying of nature&quot; or as a thanks gesture for a good harvest during the summer.

Former President of Latvia Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga wrote that “the ancient Latvian did not think of himself as lord and ruler over nature, nor superior to nature, but rather he considered himself to be an inseparable ingredient of nature.”

<doc id="89029" wikidata="Q731887" url="?curid=89029" title="Analogy of the Sun">
<text>The analogy of the Sun (or simile of the Sun or metaphor of the Sun) is found in the sixth book of &quot;The Republic&quot; (507b–509c), written by the Greek philosopher Plato as a dialogue between his brother Glaucon and Socrates, and narrated by the latter. Upon being urged by Glaucon to define goodness, a cautious Socrates professes himself incapable of doing so. Instead he draws an analogy and offers to talk about &quot;the child of goodness&quot; (). Socrates reveals this &quot;child of goodness&quot; to be the Sun, proposing that just as the Sun illuminates, bestowing the ability to see and be seen by the eye, with its light, so the idea of goodness illumines the intelligible with truth. While the analogy sets forth both epistemological and ontological theories, it is debated whether these are most authentic to the teaching of Socrates or its later interpretations by Plato. 

==Analysis==
Plato&#x27;s use of such an analogy can be interpreted for many different reasons in philosophy. For example, Plato uses them to illustrate and help illuminate his arguments. In the Analogy of the Sun, Socrates compares the &quot;Good&quot; with the Sun. Plato might be using the image of the Sun to help bring life to his arguments or to make the argument more clearly understood. David Hume once wrote, &quot;All our reasonings concerning matters of fact are founded on a species of Analogy.&quot;

Plato makes the claim that &quot;sight and the visible realm are deficient.&quot; He argues that for the other senses to be used all that is needed is the sense itself and that which can be sensed by it (e.g., to taste sweetness, one needs the sense of taste and that which can be tasted as sweet), but &quot;even if a person&#x27;s eyes are capable of sight, and he&#x27;s trying to use it, and what he&#x27;s trying to look at is coloured, the sight will see nothing and the colours will remain unseen, surely, unless there is also present an extra third thing which is made specifically for this purpose.&quot; The third thing Plato is talking about is light. Through this analogy he equates that which gives us natural light, the Sun, as the source of goodness in this world.

In other words, Plato is saying that the true nature of reality cannot be comprehended by the ordinary senses. Thus, we should make use of the mind rather than the sensory organs to better understand the higher truths of the universe. The mind, much like sight, requires a &quot;third thing&quot; to function properly, and that third thing is Plato&#x27;s idea of goodness. He likens a mind without goodness to sight without light; one cannot operate at peak efficiency without the other.

Having made these claims, Socrates asks Glaucon, &quot;...which of the gods in heaven can you put down as cause and master of this, whose light makes our sight see so beautifully and the things to be seen?&quot; (508a) Glaucon responds that both he and all others would answer that this is the sun. Analogously, Socrates says, as the sun illuminates the visible with light so the idea of goodness illuminates the intelligible with truth, which in turn makes it possible for people to have knowledge. Also, as the eye&#x27;s ability to see is made possible by the light of the Sun so the soul&#x27;s ability to know is made possible by the truth of goodness.

The allusion to &quot;...that which becomes and perishes...&quot; relates to all of that which is perceived by the bodily senses. The bodily senses make it clear that all visible things are subject to change, which Socrates categorizes into either the change of becoming or the change of perishing. Socrates argues that the bodily senses can only bring us to opinions, conveying an underlying assumption that true knowledge is of that which is not subject to change.

Instead, Socrates continues, knowledge is to be found in &quot;... that region in which truth and real being brightly shine...&quot; (508d) This is the intelligible illuminated by the highest idea, that of goodness. Since truth and being find their source in this highest idea, only the souls that are illumined by this source can be said to possess knowledge, whereas those souls which turn away are &quot;...mingled with darkness...&quot;. This subject is later vividly illustrated in the Allegory of the Cave (514a–520a), where prisoners bound in a dark cave since childhood are examples of these souls turned away from illumination.

Socrates continues by explaining that though light and sight both resemble the Sun neither can identify themselves with the Sun. Just as the Sun is rated higher than both light and sight, so is goodness rated more highly than knowledge and truth. It is goodness which allows us to know the truth and makes it possible to have knowledge. Hence goodness is more valuable than truth and knowledge as it holds a higher place. Through this analogy, Socrates helped Glaucon come to the realization that Goodness is of inestimable value, being both the source of knowledge and truth, as well as more valuable and unattainable than both.

Socrates also makes it clear that the Sun cannot be looked at, so it cannot be known from sense perception alone. Even today, humans still use all kinds of mathematical models, the physics of electromagnetic measurements, deductions, and logic to further know and understand the real sun as a fascinating being. The actual being is always far beyond our words, our thoughts, and our measurements. We truly can never fully look at and know the entire Sun, by the empirical method. 

Plato further equates the Sun to the ultimate form of goodness by calling them both sources of &quot;generation&quot;. The sunlight not only makes objects visible but is necessary for their growth and nourishment, similarly to how goodness not only makes it possible for things to be known, but also allows for things to be.

Socrates&#x27; main concern was that he did not want his followers to place Goodness, Knowledge, and Truth all on the same level. You can achieve Goodness from Truth and Knowledge, but just because you have Truth and Knowledge that does not mean you have Goodness. Plato writes:


Ultimately, the Good itself is the whole point. The Good (the sun) provides the very foundation on which all other truth rests. Plato uses the image of the Sun to help define the true meaning of the Good. The Good &quot;sheds light&quot; on knowledge so that our minds can see true reality. Without the Good, we would only be able to see with our physical eyes and not the &quot;mind&#x27;s eye&quot;. The sun bequeaths its light so that we may see the world around us. If the source of light did not exist we would be in the dark and incapable of learning and understanding the true realities that surround us.

Incidentally, the metaphor of the Sun exemplifies a traditional interrelation between metaphysics and epistemology: interpretations of fundamental existence create—and are created by—ways of knowing. It also neatly sums up two views for which Plato is recognized: his rationalism and his realism (about universals).

Socrates, using the Simile of the Sun as a foundation, continues with the Analogy of the Divided Line (509d–513e) after which follows the Allegory of the Cave (514a–520a). In relation to the other metaphors, the intelligible method can help one to understand the Good, symbolized by the Sun. The divided line gives the details of the four stage process of moving from opinions, or shadows, all the way up to mathematics, logic, deduction, and the dialectical method. The Good can be defined as the right relation between all that exists, from humans, nature, to the First Cause.

<text>Loir-et-Cher (, ) is a department in the Centre-Val de Loire region of France. Its name is originated from two rivers which cross it, the Loir in its northern part and the Cher in its southern part. Its prefecture is Blois. The INSEE and La Poste gave it the number 41. It had a population of 329,470 in 2019.

==History==

The department of Loir-et-Cher covers a territory which had a substantial population during the prehistoric period. However it was not until the Middle Ages that local inhabitants built various castles and other fortifications to enable them to withstand a series of invasions of Normans, Burgundians, the English and others.

The economy is quite flourishing: there are shops in the valley, and agriculture is prominent in the region of the Beauce and the Perche to the Sologne which were prosperous until the 17th century. However, politically, the region remained quartered between the neighboring earldoms and duchies. In 1397, the House of Orleans became the possession of the Comté of Blois. In 1497, Louis d’Orleans (23rd count hereditary of Blois) was crowned with the name of Louis XII. This marked the beginning of the importance of Blois and of the Blaisois in the politic life of the French, especially under the last Valois. During that period, kings and financiers competed to build castles and elegant abodes which now form an important part of the French national heritage. (Chambord, Blois, Cheverny and so on.)

After that, there were religious wars which were extremely ferocious under Charles IX&#x27;s reign.
In 1576 and 1588, the General Estates convened in Blois.
L’Orléanais, le Berry, la Touraine, le Perche et le Maine occupied le Loir-et-Cher and its provinces in 1790.
The Loir-et-Cher&#x27;s birth as a department was very difficult and laborious.
On 29 September 1789, the constitution&#x27;s advisory board made a report in which he wanted to attribute one of the 80 departments to Blois. However, some cities and canton capitals disagreed, such as Tours and Orleans. Inside of the department, Montrichard turns to Amboise and Tours, Saint-Aignan wants to turn to the Berry and Salbris to Vierzon.

Finally, Orleans gave Blois an important part of the Sologne except Beaugency and Tours didn&#x27;t give Amboise.
The department was founded 4 March 1790, in accordance with the law of 22 December 1789. It is constituted of some old provinces of the Orleanais and of the Touraine along with a Berry&#x27;s plot (left bank of the Selles en Berry&#x27;s Cher which becomes Selles sur Cher, to Saint-Aignan). 
The department&#x27;s constriction in its centre and the maximum stretching out in its surface area beyond the Loir on the North and the Cher on the South is due to these tribulations.
After the victory of the Coalises during the Waterloo&#x27;s battle (18 June 1815), the Prussian&#x27;s troops occupied the department from June 1815 to November 1818. ( to learn more about it, go on to &quot;France’s occupation at the end of the First Empire&quot;)

The poet Pierre de Ronsard, the inventor Denis Papin, and the historian Augustin Thierry come from here. Other well-known people are also associated with this department, such as François the First, Gaston d’Orleans, the Marshall Maunoury, and the abbot Gregoire (Bishop of Blois, elected at the Constituante). In the artistic domain, there is the compositor Antoine Boesset (1587–1643), musician in the Louis XII de France&#x27;s court, who was the head of the Music of the King&#x27;s Bedroom from 1623 to 1643.

The Loir-et-Cher&#x27;s department is a part of the Centre Region. It is adjacent of these departments : the Eure-et-Loir, the Loiret, the Cher, the Indre, the Indre-et-Loire and the Sarthe.
Due to its surface area of 6 343 km2, it is the 31st largest department in the nation. It has a privileged geographical situation because it is in the center of the Centre region and near the Paris basin.
An axe lively and dynamic, brings Blois closer (the department&#x27;s administrative center) to both the urban conglomerations near it: Orleans and Tours.
Located on the boundaries of the Perche, the Beauce, the Sologne and the Touraine, it finds its territorial identity in the diversity of its geography and its landscapes. Cut in its middle by the Loire, it shows an image of balance and diversity.

In 1989, American-based animators Andreas Deja, Glen Keane, and Tom Sito, and draftsmen Jean Gillmore, Thom Enriquez, and Hans Bacher launched an expedition to the chateau to do their research for the animated adaptation of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.

==Geography==
Loir-et-Cher is a part of the modern region of Centre-Val de Loire. Adjacent departments are Eure-et-Loir to the north, Loiret to the north-east, Cher to the south-east, Indre to the south, Indre-et-Loire to the south-west, and Sarthe to the west.

The department comprises 6,314 km2, which makes it the 31st largest of the French departments in terms of area. The line of the river Loire traverses the land, ensuring easy communication between its own capital, Blois, and the vibrant cultural and commercial centres of Tours to the west and the fringes of the Seine-Paris basin at Orléans to the east.

Its main rivers are the Loire, on which its prefecture (capital) Blois is situated, the Loir and the Cher.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Blois, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 6 communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants:

==Demographics==
The inhabitants of the department are called the &quot;Loir-et-Chériens&quot;.

==Politics==

The president of the Departmental Council is Philippe Gouet (UDI), elected in July 2021.
