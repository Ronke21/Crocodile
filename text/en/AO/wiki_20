<text>Le Bébête Show (, &quot;The Beastie Show&quot;) was a French satirical puppet show created by Stéphane Collaro
that aired on TF1 from 1982 to 1995.

==History==
The show was introduced in Stéphane Collaro&#x27;s Collaroshow on channel TF1, in 1982, before becoming a daily broadcast. Major French political figures were designed by artists: Alain Duverne, Jacques Loup, Jean-Yves Grall... representing as characters similar to those of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, with, for instance, François Mitterrand portrayed as a frog named Kermitterrand (and naming himself God), a reference to Kermit the Frog. Most characters were voiced by Jean Roucas, who also acted as the show&#x27;s host.

Although some French politicians expressed appreciation for their caricatures, some have greeted them with less enthusiasm. Jean-Marie Le Pen sued the show, as he disliked being represented as the vampire &quot;Pencassine&quot;, shown wearing a traditional girl&#x27;s costume from Brittany – a reference to &quot;Bécassine&quot;, a 1910s classic French comic character, and to Le Pen&#x27;s origins in Brittany, while retaining his vampire fangs. Édith Cresson expressed great displeasure at her own puppet: she was depicted as an air-headed panther, submissive to the sexual whims of &quot;Kermitterrand&quot;.

The series&#x27; popularity and ratings began to decline in the 1990s, due to growing competition from &quot;Les Guignols de l&#x27;info&quot; on Canal+. After Roucas&#x27; departure in 1994, Collaro revamped the puppets, but this proved unsuccessful, as the show was now seen as an imitation of &quot;Les Guignols&quot;. It was eventually canceled in 1995.

==Characters==
*François Mitterrand: Kermitterrand, as Kermit the Frog
*Georges Marchais: Marchy la cochonne as Miss Piggy
*Raymond Barre: Barzzie as Fozzie Bear.
*Jacques Chirac: Black Jack as Sam the Eagle.
*Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and Gaston Defferre: Valéry and Gaston as Statler and Waldorf.
*Ronald Reagan: Ronnie le Cuisinier as Swedish Chef
Eventually, Muppet Show references became less evident, with the introduction of new characters unrelated to the Jim Henson show: Jean-Marie Le Pen as Pencassine, a vampire version of Bécassine, Jack Lang as a goat, Édith Cresson as a panther, Jacques Chaban-Delmas as a duck, Charles Pasqua as a walrus, André Lajoinie as a dimwitted dog, Michel Rocard as a crow, Laurent Fabius as a squirrel, Édouard Balladur as a pelican, Arlette Laguiller as a weasel, etc...

After Gaston Defferre died, Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing complained about remaining the only character to be represented as a human (and a grumpy old man, at that). He was then changed into a marabou stork, but complained again, so he became a monkey (Ouistiti Giscard des Singes).

<text>Straw marquetry is a craft very similar to that of wood marquetry, except that straw replaces the wood veneer. It is thought to have first been practised in the East; examples were brought to England in the 17th century.

To mimic the varying shades of wood veneer, wheat or oat straw has to be split, then soaked in cold, warm, or hot water. The strips are then ironed, and there will be a variety of tones from pale gold to deepest dark brown.

There are accounts of nuns in France and Switzerland making a variety of items using straw marquetry.

The most famous straw marquetry was practised by prisoners of war from the Napoleonic wars. Dartmoor and other prisons had been built for them; the prison most famous for straw marquetry was Norman Cross, Huntingdon.

Easter eggs are decorated with straw applique, especially in Eastern European countries. Geometric shapes, stars and flower motifs are the most common themes. There is a slight difference in the way the straw is prepared, however; for marquetry, the straws are soaked, split and ironed; for egg decoration the straw is not ironed.

<text>Marquetry (also spelled as marqueterie; from the French &quot;marqueter&quot;, to variegate) is the art and craft of applying pieces of veneer to a structure to form decorative patterns or designs. The technique may be applied to case furniture or even seat furniture, to decorative small objects with smooth, veneerable surfaces or to freestanding pictorial panels appreciated in their own right.

Marquetry differs from the more ancient craft of inlay, or intarsia, in which a solid body of one material is cut out to receive sections of another to form the surface pattern. The word derives from a Middle French word meaning &quot;inlaid work&quot;.

== Materials ==
The veneers used are primarily woods, but may include bone, ivory, turtle-shell (conventionally called &quot;tortoiseshell&quot;), mother-of-pearl, pewter, brass or fine metals. Marquetry using colored straw was a specialty of some European spa resorts from the end of the 18th century. Many exotic woods as well as common varieties can be employed, from the near-white of boxwood to the near-black of ebony; colors not found in nature can be achieved by applying dye to a veneer that retains stains well, such as sycamore.
The French cabinet maker André-Charles Boulle (1642–1732) specialized in furniture using metal and either wood or tortoiseshell together, the latter acting as the background.

The simplest kind of marquetry uses only two sheets of veneer, which are temporarily glued together and cut with a fine saw, producing two contrasting panels of identical design, (in French called &quot;partie&quot; and &quot;contre-partie&quot;, &quot;part&quot; and &quot;counterpart&quot;).

Marquetry as a modern craft most commonly uses knife-cut veneers. However, the knife-cutting technique usually requires a lot of time. For that reason, many marquetarians have switched to fret or scroll saw techniques. Other requirements are a pattern of some kind, some brown gummed tape (this kind of tape is used because as its moistened glue dries the tape shrinks, pulling the veneer pieces closer together), PVA glue and a base-board with balancing veneers on the alternate face to compensate stresses. Finishing the piece will require fine abrasive paper, always backed by a sanding block. Choices of sealers and finishes that can be applied include ordinary varnish, special varnishes, polyurethane (either oil or water based), wax, and French polish.

Sand shading is a process used to make a picture appear to be more three-dimensional. A piece of veneer to be incorporated into a picture is partially submerged in hot sand for a few seconds.

Another shading process is engraving fine lines into a picture and filling them with a mixture of India ink and shellac.

== History ==
Furniture inlaid with precious woods, metals, glass and stones is known from the ancient world and Roman examples have been recovered from the first century sites of Pompeii and Herculaneum demonstrating that the technique was highly advanced. The revival of the technique of veneered marquetry had its inspiration in 16th century Florence and at Naples ultimately from classical inspiration. Marquetry elaborated upon Florentine techniques of inlaying solid marble slabs with designs formed of fitted marbles, jaspers and semi-precious stones. This work, called &quot;opere di commessi&quot;, has medieval parallels in Central Italian &quot;Cosmati&quot;-work of inlaid marble floors, altars and columns. The technique is known in English as pietra dura, for the &quot;hardstones&quot; used: onyx, jasper, cornelian, lapis lazuli and colored marbles. In Florence, the Chapel of the Medici at San Lorenzo is completely covered in a colored marble facing using this demanding jig-sawn technique.
Techniques of wood marquetry were developed in Antwerp and other Flemish centers of luxury cabinet-making during the early 16th century. The craft was imported full-blown to France after the mid-seventeenth century, to create furniture of unprecedented luxury being made at the royal manufactory of the Gobelins, charged with providing furnishings to decorate Versailles and the other royal residences of Louis XIV. Early masters of French marquetry were the Fleming Pierre Gole and his son-in-law, André-Charles Boulle, who founded a dynasty of royal and Parisian cabinet-makers (&quot;ébénistes&quot;) and gave his name to a technique of marquetry employing &quot;tortoiseshell&quot; and brass with pewter in arabesque or intricately foliate designs. &quot;Boulle&quot; marquetry dropped out of favor in the 1720s, but was revived in the 1780s. In the decades between, carefully matched quarter-sawn veneers sawn from the same piece of timber were arranged symmetrically on case pieces and contrasted with gilt-bronze mounts. Floral marquetry came into favor in Parisian furniture in the 1750s, employed by cabinet-makers like Bernard II van Risamburgh, Jean-Pierre Latz and Simon-François Oeben. The most famous royal French furniture veneered with marquetry are the pieces delivered by Jean Henri Riesener in the 1770s and 1780s. The &quot;Bureau du Roi&quot; was the most famous amongst these famous masterpieces.

Marquetry was not ordinarily a feature of furniture made outside large urban centers. Nevertheless, marquetry was introduced into London furniture at the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the product of immigrant Dutch &#x27;inlayers&#x27;, whose craft traditions owed a lot to Antwerp. Panels of elaborately scrolling &quot;seaweed&quot; marquetry of box or holly contrasting with walnut appeared on table tops, cabinets, and long-case clocks. At the end of the 17th century, a new influx of French Huguenot craftsmen went to London, but marquetry in England had little appeal in the anti-French, more Chinese-inspired high-style English furniture (mis-called &#x27;Queen Anne&#x27;) after &quot;ca&quot; 1720. Marquetry was revived as a vehicle of Neoclassicism and a &#x27;French taste&#x27; in London furniture, starting in the late 1760s. Cabinet-makers associated with London-made marquetry furniture, 1765–1790, include Thomas Chippendale and less familiar names, like John Linnell, the French craftsman Pierre Langlois, and the firm of William Ince and John Mayhew.
Although marquetry is a technique separate from inlay, English marquetry-makers were called &quot;inlayers&quot; throughout the 18th century. In Paris, before 1789, makers of veneered or marquetry furniture (&quot;ébénistes&quot;) belonged to a separate guild from chair-makers and other furniture craftsmen working in solid wood (&quot;menuisiers&quot;).

Tiling patterning has been more highly developed in the Islamic world than anywhere else, and many extraordinary examples of inlay work have come from Middle Eastern countries such as Lebanon and Iran. 

At Tonbridge and Royal Tunbridge Wells, England, souvenir &quot;Tunbridge wares&quot;—small boxes and the like—made from the mid-18th century onwards, were veneered with panels of minute wood mosaics, usually geometric, but which could include complicated subjects like landscapes. They were made by laboriously assembling and gluing thin strips and shaped rods, which then could be sliced crossways to provide numerous mosaic panels all of the same design.

Marquetry was a feature of some centers of German cabinet-making from c. 1710. The craft and artistry of David Roentgen, Neuwied, (and later at Paris as well) was unsurpassed, even in Paris, by any 18th-century marquetry craftsman.

Marquetry was not a mainstream fashion in 18th-century Italy, but the neoclassical marquetry of Giuseppe Maggiolini, made in Milan at the end of the century is notable.

The classic illustrated description of 18th century marquetry-making was contributed by Roubo to the &quot;Encyclopédie des Arts et Métiers,&quot; 1770.

== New techniques ==

During the 1980s Georges Vriz developed a technique called technique VRIZ, layering two veneer layers on top of each other and sanding through the top one, to the point of fiber transparency. This has been used mainly in France, by professionals and marquetry students of the École Boulle. With its technique, Georges Vriz promoted a resurgence of the marquetry he called RENAISSANCE. He launched the contemporary marquetry. In the US the technique has been used at the American School of French Marquetry by one of the teachers, artist Patrice Lejeune. The school staff is also proposing a new name for it: &quot;Given that &#x27;piercing&#x27; is an unfortunate mistake in the veneering world, we chose to use the word &quot;Fusion&quot; instead, by which term the artist expresses his intention of sanding through the veneer as a decorative, textural effect, not as a mistake.&quot;

Cutting-edge tech has also been applied to marquetry. Among these is laser cutting, where the design is drawn or imported as a CAD or vector file and each piece is cut separately; each different species of wood-and thickness-may need a specific adjustment of the beam power; the offset will determine the gap between the pieces. In some cases, the beam will leave a dark edge due to the high heat required by the process.

<text>Haute-Marne (; English: Upper Marne) is a department in the Grand Est region of Northeastern France. Named after the river Marne, its prefecture is Chaumont. In 2019, it had a population of 172,512.

==History==
Haute-Marne is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on March 4, 1790. It was created from parts of the former provinces of Champagne, Burgundy, Lorraine and Franche-Comté.

In March 1814 the departmental prefecture, Chaumont, was the unwitting witness to the end of the First Empire. On 1 March, Prussia, Russia, the United Kingdom and Austria signed an accord forbidding any individual peace deal with Napoleon I, and to fight until his final defeat.

During World War II, Haute-Marne was partitioned under German occupation. The canal which runs from the Marne to the Saône served as a border, dividing the department into east and west. The east was a &quot;reserved zone&quot;, intended for the creation of a new German (Ripuarian) state, whereas to the west would be the traditional &quot;occupied zone&quot;. Haute-Marne was finally liberated by the Allies, in the form of the division of General Leclerc, between August and September 1944.
==Geography==
Haute-Marne is part of the region of Grand Est and is surrounded by the departments of Meuse, Vosges, Haute-Saône, Côte-d&#x27;Or, Aube, and Marne.

The highest mountain is Haut-du-Sac, in the Langres Plateau, in the southwest of the department, which rises to a height of . The lowest points at are found on the plains of Perthois and Der.

The department is named after the river Marne, whose source is near Langres. This river covers within the department. The department is to the east of the Parisian basin, and is characterised by a concentric sequence of cliff faces of varying geological origin, oriented northeast–southwest.
===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Saint-Dizier; the prefecture Chaumont is the second-most populous. As of 2019, there are 5 communes with more than 3,000 inhabitants:

==Tourism==
The Haute-Marne department is not a famous department but this peaceful territory has numerous interesting places to visit. Indeed, the department was one of the most powerful in French history thanks to metallurgy economy and was a land of confrontations along history.

Thus, among other examples, the French Wars of Religion (from 1562 to 1598) began with the Massacre of Vassy in the north of the Haute-Marne department. Following this event, open military conflicts across France Kingdom began. The Edict of Nantes is the consequence of this period.

The fortified town of Langres, famous for Denis Diderot author of the Encyclopédie, the Renaissance castle of Joinville, the Lake Der-Chantecoq (one of the biggest artificial lake in Europe), the Chateau de Cirey where Voltaire lived for a while with Émilie du Châtelet and the village of Colombey-les-Deux-Églises where Charles De Gaulle lived until his death are all major attractions.

Haute-Marne is also well known for some famous French great men and women as:
*Louise Michel
*Camille Flammarion and his brother Ernest Flammarion
*Goncourt brothers most famous all around the world with the Prix Goncourt, literature prize given by the académie Goncourt for &quot;the best and most imaginative prose work of the year&quot;
*Albin Michel

==Politics==
Charles de Gaulle was a longtime resident of the department, in Colombey-les-Deux-Églises, and died there on 9 November 1970, at the age of 79.

The president of the Departmental Council is Nicolas Lacroix, elected in 2017.

<doc id="87690" wikidata="Q3325926" url="?curid=87690" title="Harrier (bird)">
<text>A harrier is a member of the genus Circus in Accipitridae, a family of birds of prey. Harriers characteristically hunt by flying low over open ground, feeding on small mammals, reptiles, or birds. The young of the species are sometimes referred to as ring-tail harriers. They are distinctive with long wings, a long narrow tail, the slow and low flight over grasslands and skull peculiarities. The harriers are thought to have diversified with the expansion of grasslands and the emergence of grasses about 6 to 8 million years ago during the Late Miocene and Pliocene.

==Taxonomy==

The genus &quot;Circus&quot; was introduced by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799. The type species was subsequently designated as the western marsh harrier. Most harriers are placed in this genus. The word &quot;Circus&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek &quot;κρέξ&quot; (&quot;kréx)&quot; referring to a long legged bird, and is possibly ultimately derived from an onomatopoeia. The name &quot;harrier&quot; is thought to have been derived either from Harrier (dog), or by a corruption of &quot;&quot;, or directly from &quot;&quot;.

The genera &quot;Circus&quot; has in the past been placed in the subfamily Circinae but molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that such a grouping is polyphyletic for Accipitrinae. The harrier-hawks in the genus &quot;Polyboroides&quot; are not closely related and are placed in their own subfamily Polyboroidinae

===Ring-tails===
&quot;Ring-tail&quot; is an informal term used by birders for the juveniles and females of several harrier species when seen in the field and not identifiable to an exact species. Ring-tail harriers include the juveniles and females of Montagu&#x27;s harrier (&quot;Circus pygargus&quot;), hen harrier (&quot;Circus cyaneus&quot;), and pallid harrier (&quot;Circus macrourus&quot;).
==Species==
The genus contains 16 species:












===Fossils===
* Eyles&#x27;s harrier, &quot;Circus eylesi&quot; (prehistoric)
* Wood harrier, &quot;Circus dossenus&quot; (prehistoric)

<doc id="87691" wikidata="Q25510" url="?curid=87691" title="Accipitridae">
<text>The Accipitridae () is one of the four families within the order Accipitriformes, and is a family of small to large birds of prey with strongly hooked bills and variable morphology based on diet. They feed on a range of prey items from insects to medium-sized mammals, with a number feeding on carrion and a few feeding on fruit. The Accipitridae have a cosmopolitan distribution, being found on all the world&#x27;s continents (except Antarctica) and a number of oceanic island groups. Some species are migratory. The family contains 256 species which are divided into 12 subfamilies and 75 genera.

Many well-known birds such as hawks, eagles, kites, harriers and Old World vultures are included in this group. The osprey is usually placed in a separate family (Pandionidae), as is the secretary bird (Sagittariidae), and the New World vultures are also usually now regarded as a separate family or order. Karyotype data indicate the accipitrids analysed are indeed a distinct monophyletic group.

== Systematics and phylogeny ==
In the past the accipitrids have been variously divided into some five to ten subfamilies. Most share a very similar morphology, but many of these groups contain taxa that are more aberrant. These were placed in their respective position more for lack of better evidence than anything else. The phylogenetic layout of the accipitrids was historically a matter of dispute. Molecular studies have removed the phylogenetic uncertainty for most of the species.

The accipitrids are recognizable by a peculiar rearrangement of their chromosomes. Apart from this, morphology and mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence data give a confusing picture of these birds&#x27; inter-relationships. The hawks, kites, eagles and Old World vultures as presently assigned in all likelihood do not form monophyletic groups.

The genus level cladogram of the Accipiridae shown below is based on a densely sampled molecular phylogenetic study of the Accipitridae by Therese Catanach and collaborators that was published in 2024. The number of species in each genus is based on the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).
=== Taxonomy ===
The family contains 256 species that are divided in 12 subfamilies and 75 genera.
=== Fossil record ===
As with most other birds of prey, the fossil record of this group is fairly complete from the latter Eocene onwards (c.35 mya), with modern genera being well documented since the Early Oligocene, or around 30 mya.
* &quot;Milvoides&quot; (Late Eocene of England)
* &quot;Aquilavus&quot; (Late Eocene/Early Oligocene – Early Miocene of France)
* &quot;Palaeocircus&quot; (Late Eocene/Early Oligocene of France)
* &quot;Aviraptor&quot; (Early Oligocene of Poland)
* &quot;Palaeastur&quot; (Agate Fossil Beds, Early Miocene of Sioux County, US)
* &quot;Pengana&quot; (Early Miocene of Riversleigh, Australia)
* &quot;Promilio&quot; (Agate Fossil Beds Early Miocene of Sioux County, US)
* &quot;Proictinia&quot; (Early – Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of C and SE US)
* &quot;Neophrontops&quot; (Early/Middle Miocene – Late Pleistocene) – formerly in &quot;Neophron&quot;
* &quot;Mioaegypius&quot; (Xiacaowan Middle Miocene of Sihong, China)
* &quot;Apatosagittarius&quot; (Late Miocene of Nebraska, US)
* &quot;Gansugyps&quot; (Liushu Late Miocene of China)
* &quot;Palaeoborus&quot; (Miocene)
* &quot;Qiluornis&quot; (Miocene of Shandong, China)
* &quot;Garganoaetus&quot; (Early Pliocene of Gargano Peninsula, Italy)
* &quot;Dynatoaetus&quot; (Pliocene – Pleistocene of South Australia, Australia)
* &quot;Amplibuteo&quot; (Late Pliocene of Peru – Late Pleistocene of southern North America and Cuba) – may belong to extant genus &quot;Harpyhaliaetus&quot;
* &quot;Neogyps&quot;
* &quot;Palaeohierax&quot; – includes &quot;&quot;Aquila&quot; gervaisii&quot;

Accipitrids are known since Early Eocene times, or about from 50 mya onwards, but these early remains are too fragmentary and/or basal to properly assign a place in the phylogeny. Likewise, molecular methods are of limited value in determining evolutionary relationships of and within the accipitrids. The group may have originated on either side of the Atlantic, which during that time was only 60–80% its present width. As evidenced by fossils like &quot;Pengana&quot;, some 25 mya, accipitrids in all likelihood rapidly acquired a global distribution, initially probably extending even to Antarctica.

Specimen AMNH FR 2941, a left coracoid from the Late Eocene Irdin Manha Formation of Chimney Butte (Inner Mongolia), was initially assessed as a basal mid-sized buteonine; it is today considered to be more likely to belong in the Gruiformes genus &quot;Eogrus&quot;. The Early Oligocene genus &quot;Cruschedula&quot; was formerly thought to belong to Spheniscidae, however reexamination of the holotype in 1943 resulted in the genus being placed in Accipitridae. Further examination in 1980 resulted in placement as Aves &quot;incertae sedis&quot;.

== Morphology ==
The Accipitridae are a diverse family with a great deal of variation in size and shape. They range in size from the tiny pearl kite (&quot;Gampsonyx swainsonii&quot;) and little sparrowhawk (&quot;Accipiter minullus&quot;), both of which are 23 cm (9 in) in length and weigh about 85 g (3 oz), to the cinereous vulture (&quot;Aegypius monachus&quot;), which measures up to 120 cm (47 in) and weighs up to 14 kg (31 lbs). Wingspan can vary from in the little sparrowhawk to more than in the cinereous and Himalayan vultures (&quot;Gyps himalayensis&quot;). In these extreme species, wing chord length can range from and culmen length from . Until the 14th century, even these huge vultures were surpassed by the extinct Haast&#x27;s eagle (Hieraaetus &quot;moorei&quot;) of New Zealand, which is estimated to have measured up to 140 cm (55 in) and to have weighed in the largest females. In terms of body mass, the Accipitridae are the most diverse family of birds and may also be in terms of some aspects of linear size diversity, although lag behind the true parrots and pheasant family in length diversity. Most accipitrids exhibit sexual dimorphism in size, although, unusually for birds, it is the females that are larger than the males. This sexual difference in size is most pronounced in active species that hunt birds, such as the &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks, in which the size difference averages 25–50%. In a majority of species, such as generalist hunters and rodent-, reptile-, fish-, and insect-hunting specialists, the dimorphism is less, usually between a 5% to 30% size difference. In the carrion-eating Old World vultures and snail eating kites, the difference is largely non-existent, though sometimes the female may average slightly heavier.

The beaks of accipitrids are strong and hooked (sometimes very hooked, as in the hook-billed kite or snail kite). In some species, there is a notch or &#x27;tooth&#x27; in the upper mandible. In all accipitrids, the base of the upper mandible is covered by a fleshy membrane called the cere, which is usually yellow in colour. The tarsi of different species vary by diet; those of bird-hunting species, such as sparrowhawks, are long and thin, whilst species that hunt large mammals have much thicker, stronger tarsi, and the tarsi of the snake-eagles have thick scales to protect from bites.

The plumage of the Accipitridae can be striking, but rarely utilises bright colours; most birds use combinations of white, grey, buff, brown and black. Overall they tend to be paler below, which helps them seem less conspicuous when seen from below. There is seldom sexual dimorphism in plumage, when it occurs the males are brighter or the females resemble juveniles. In many species juveniles have a distinctly different plumage. Some accipitrids mimic the plumage patterns of other hawks and eagles. Resembling a less dangerous species may fool prey; resembling a more dangerous species may reduce mobbing by other birds. Several species of accipitrid have crests used in signalling, and even species without crests can raise the feathers of the crown when alarmed or excited. In contrast most of the Old World vultures possess bare heads without feathers; this is thought to prevent soiling on the feathers and aid in thermoregulation.

The senses of the Accipitridae are adapted to hunting (or scavenging), and in particular their vision is exceptional, with some large accipitrids such as the wedge-tailed eagle and Old World vultures having over twice the visual acuity of a typical human. Large eyes with two foveae provide binocular vision and a &quot;hawk eye&quot; for movement and distance judging. In addition the Accipitridae have the largest pectens of any birds. The eyes are tube shaped and cannot move much in their sockets. In addition to excellent vision many species have excellent hearing, but unlike in owls sight is generally the principal sense used for hunting. Hearing may be used to locate prey hidden in vegetation, but sight is still used to catch the prey. Although they rely primarily on vision, Accipitridae do have functioning olfactory systems, which they make use of in a variety of contexts.

== Diet and behavior ==


Accipitrids are predominantly predators and most species actively hunt for their prey. Prey is usually captured and killed in the powerful talons of the raptor and then carried off to be torn apart with a hooked bill for eating or feeding to nestlings. A majority of accipitrids are opportunistic predators that will take any prey that they can kill. However, most have a preference for a certain type of prey, which in harriers and the numerous buteonine hawks (including more than 30 species in the genus &quot;Buteo&quot;) tends towards small mammals such as rodents.

Among the raptors that mainly favor small mammals, harriers generally hunt by hovering over openings until they detect their prey and descend upon them. Due to the specificity of their hunting style, prey preferences, and habitat preferences, usually only one harrier species tends to be found per region.

Buteonine hawks usually watch for prey from a perch but most species will also readily hunt on the wing, including from a high soar. Many buteonines are amongst the most generalized feeders, often feeding on any active small animal they find, and will generally eat whatever diurnal rodent or lagomorph is most locally common. Some buteonines, however, are more specialized, such as certain species in the genus &quot;Buteogallus&quot;, which have evolved to specialize in feeding on crabs. Larger &quot;Buteogallus&quot;, namely the solitary eagles, and &quot;Geranoaetus&quot; are much larger than other buteonines and seem to have become avian apex predators of specific habitat niches—for example, savanna, cloud forest and páramo in South America—and are thus honorary &quot;eagles&quot;.

In &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks (the most species-rich accipitrid genus with nearly 50 extant species), prey is mainly other birds. &quot;Accipiter&quot;s are in general forest- and thicket-dwelling species. &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks usually ambush birds in dense vegetation, a dangerous hunting method that requires great agility. Many smaller tropical species of &quot;Accipiter&quot; eat nearly equal portions of insects and reptiles and amphibians as they do of birds while some of the larger species have become more generalized and may feed extensively on rodents and lagomorphs, as well as other various non-avian animals.

Most accipitrids will supplement their diet with non-putrid carrion, but none are specialized for this as well as the 14–16 species of vultures, which have evolved very large bodies (which leave them equipped to fill their crop with carrion); weaker, less specialized feet than other accipitrids; large wingspans to spend long periods of time in flight over openings scanning for carcasses; and complex social behavior in order to establish a mixed species hierarchy at carrion. The New World vultures have attained several similar characteristics, but only through convergent evolution, and are seemingly not directly related to Old World vultures and other accipitrids. The lammergeier (&quot;Gypaetus barbatus&quot;) is an aberrant cousin of the Old World vultures that has maintained strong feet that it uses to carry and drop large bones in order to crack them open to feed on bone marrow, their primary food, a technique they also sometimes use for live prey items, like tortoises.

A few species may opportunistically feed on fruit. In one species, the palm-nut vulture (&quot;Gypohierax angolensis&quot;) (possibly not closely related to other &quot;vultures&quot;), it may form more than half of the diet. Most accipitrids will not eat plant material.

Insects are taken exclusively by around 12 species, in great numbers by 44 additional species, and opportunistically by a great many others. The diet of the honey-buzzards includes not only the adults and young of social insects such as wasps and bees, but the honey and combs from their nests.

The snail kite (&quot;Rostrhamus sociabilis&quot;), slender-billed kite (&quot;Helicolestes hamatus&quot;) and hook-billed kites (&quot;Chondrohierax uncinatus&quot;) are specialists in consuming snails, which usually constitute 50–95% of their diet. Other &quot;kites&quot;—a loose assemblance of smallish raptors, many of which are strong, buoyant fliers—are divided into two groups. One, exclusively in the Old World, the milvine or &quot;large&quot; kites, are often quite common, very generalized and often weakly predaceous feeders whereas the other kites, known as elanine or &quot;small&quot; kites and cosmopolitan in distribution, are supremely aerial, active hunters that generally alternate their primary food between insects and small mammals. One species allied with the latter kite group, the bat hawk (&quot;Macheiramphus alcinus&quot;), has come to specialize in hunting bats.

&quot;Eagles&quot; are several raptors that are not necessarily closely related, but can be broadly defined by large body size (larger than other raptors, excluding vultures) and the taking of typically larger prey, including mid-sized mammals and larger birds. The most diverse group of eagles is the &quot;booted eagles&quot;, a variable group of about 38 species defined by their feathering covering their legs (shared by only a couple of buteonine species).

Most accipitrids usually hunt prey smaller than themselves. However, many accipitrids of almost all sizes have been recorded as capturing and then flying with prey of equal weight or even slightly heavier than themselves in their talons, a feat that requires great strength. Occasionally, an eagle or other raptor that kills prey considerably heavier than itself (too heavy for the raptor to carry and fly with) will then have to leave prey at the site of the kill and later return repeatedly to feed or dismember and bring to a perch or nest piece by piece. This has the advantage of providing a surplus of food but has the disadvantage of potentially attracting scavengers or other predators which can steal the kill or even attack the feeding accipitrid. Using this method, accipitrids such as the golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), wedge-tailed eagle (&quot;Aquila audax&quot;), martial eagle (&quot;Polemaetus bellicosus&quot;) and crowned eagle (&quot;Stephanoaetus coronatus&quot;) have successfully hunted ungulates, such as deer and antelope, and other large animals (kangaroos and emus in the wedge-tailed) weighing more than 30 kg (66 lb), 7–8 times their own mass. More typical prey for these powerful booted eagle species weigh between .

The &quot;Haliaeetus&quot; eagles and the osprey (&quot;Pandion haliaetus&quot;) mainly prefer to prey on fish, which comprising more than 90% of food for the osprey and some fish eagles. These large acciptrids may supplement their diets with aquatic animals other than fish, especially sea eagles, which also hunt large numbers of water birds and are expert kleptoparasites.

Reptiles and amphibians are hunted by almost all variety of acciptrids when the opportunity arises and may be favored over other prey by some eagles, i.e. &quot;Spizaetus&quot; hawk-eagles and the &quot;eagles&quot; in &quot;Buteogallus&quot;, and several species of buteonine hawks found in the tropics. Bazas and forest hawks in the genus &quot;Accipiter&quot; may take reptiles from trees whilst other species may hunt them on the ground. Snakes are the primary prey of the snake-eagles (&quot;Circaetus&quot;) and serpent-eagles (&quot;Spilornis&quot; and &quot;Dryotriorchis&quot;). The mammal-hunting, huge and endangered Philippine eagle (&quot;Pithecophaga jefferyi&quot;) is most closely related to the snake-eagles. Another striking aberration of the snake-eagle lineage is the bateleur (&quot;Terathopius ecaudatus&quot;), which has evolved unusually bright plumage in adults, with a huge red cere, red feet, bright yellow bill, and boldly contrasting grey-and-white markings over black plumage. The bateleur feeds extensively on carrion and almost any other feeding opportunity that presents itself.

== Reproductive biology and populations ==
In terms of their reproductive biology and socio-sexual behavior, accipitrids share many characteristics with other extant groups of birds that appear not be directly related, but all of which have evolved to become active predators of other warm-blooded creatures. Some of the characteristics shared with these other groups, including falcons, owls, skuas and shrikes, are sexual dimorphism in size, with the female typically larger than the male; extreme devotion of breeding pairs to each other or to a dedicated nesting site; strict and often ferocious territorial behavior; and, on hatching, occasional competition amongst nestlings, including regular siblicide in several species.

Before the onset of the nesting season, adult accipitrids often devote a majority of their time to excluding other members of their own species and even of other species from their nesting territories. In several species, this occurs by territorial display flights over the border of their breeding ranges. In several forest dwelling varieties, however, vocalizations are used to establish territories. Due to the density of the habitat, display flights are apparently impractical.

While a single devoted breeding pair is considered typical, research has revealed that in varied accipitrids, multiple birds engaging in nesting behavior is more commonly than previously thought. Some harriers have evolved to become polygynous, with a single smaller male breeding with and then helping multiple females raise young. The most extreme known species of accipitrid in terms of sociality is the Harris&#x27;s hawks (&quot;Parabuteo unicinctus&quot;), which up to seven fully-grown birds may hunt, nest and brood cooperatively, with the extra birds typically being prior years&#x27; offspring of the breeding pair.

Unlike the other two larger groups of raptorial birds, the owls and most falcons, accipitrids typically build their own nest. Nest sites are typically in relatively secure places, such as the crook of a large tree or an ample cliff ledge, and can vary in elevation from the flat ground of prairies or steppe to near the peaks of the tallest mountains. Accipitrids will readily return to use a nest site repeatedly, which has resulted in several of the largest bird&#x27;s nests known, as a single nest may see decades of use, with more material added each breeding season. The single largest known tree nest known for any animal, belonging to a bald eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;), was found to be deep and across, and to weigh . Some species, especially eagles, will build multiple nests for use in alternating years. Although they usually use nests they build themselves, accipitrids sometimes use abandoned nests build by other animals or pirate nests from other birds, typically other types of accipitrid.

Compared to most other types of birds, the stretch from egg-laying to independence in young birds is prolonged. In accipitrids, the breeding season ranges from about two to three months to roughly a year and a half, the latter in some of the larger tropical eagles. Species inhabiting temperate ranges as a rule have shorter breeding seasons due to the shorter stretches of warm weather that facilitates ready capture of prey.

Usually from 2 to 6 eggs are laid in accipitrids, a relatively small clutch, and some species may lay only one egg. In almost all accipitrids, eggs are laid at intervals rather than all at once and in some larger species the intervals can be several days. This results in one of the hatchlings being larger and more advanced in development than its siblings. The benefits of siblicide, which is at least occasionally recorded in many species and almost always occurs in some, such as tropical members of the booted eagle group, is that the smaller siblings are a kind of insurance policy that if the oldest, strongest nestling dies, one of the smaller siblings may take its place. In most species that have displayed siblicide, times of food plenty may result in two or more the nestlings being successfully raised to fledging.

In most accipitrids, the smaller males typically obtain food both for the incubating and brooding female and the nestlings. Males, however, occasionally take a shift incubating or even more sporadically brooding the nestlings, which allows the female to hunt. Most accipitrids feed their nestlings strips of meat or whole prey items, but most vultures feed their nestlings via regurgitation.

Fledging often takes considerable effort for young birds and may take several weeks as opposed to days in many other types of birds. Once independent of their parents, young accipitrids often most wander for considerable stretches of time, ranging from 1 to 5 years, before they attain maturity. Most accipitrids have distinct plumages in their immature stage, which presumably serves as a visual cue to others of their species and may allow them to avoid territorial fights. Shortly after attaining mature plumages, pairs form, with a male typically displaying, often in flight but sometimes vocally, to win over a female. Many accipitrids breed with the same mate for several years or for life, although this is not the case for all species and, if a mate dies, the widowed bird will typically try to find another mate the next breeding season.

<doc id="87696" wikidata="Q1589289" url="?curid=87696" title="Parliament Hill">
<text>Parliament Hill (), colloquially known as The Hill, is an area of Crown land on the southern bank of the Ottawa River that houses the Parliament of Canada in downtown Ottawa, Ontario. It accommodates a suite of Gothic revival buildings whose architectural elements were chosen to evoke the history of parliamentary democracy. Parliament Hill attracts approximately three million visitors each year. The Parliamentary Protective Service is responsible for law enforcement on Parliament Hill and in the parliamentary precinct, while the National Capital Commission is responsible for maintaining the area of the grounds.

Development of the area, which in the 18th and early 19th centuries was the site of a military base, into a governmental precinct began in 1859 after Queen Victoria chose Ottawa as the capital of the Province of Canada. Following several extensions to the Parliament and departmental buildings, and a fire in 1916 that destroyed the Centre Block, Parliament Hill took on its present form with the completion of the Peace Tower in 1927. In 1976, the Parliament Buildings and the grounds of Parliament Hill were designated as National Historic Sites of Canada. Since 2002, an extensive $3 billion renovation-and-rehabilitation project has been underway throughout the precinct&#x27;s buildings that is expected to be completed after 2028.

==History==
===Early use===
Parliament Hill is a limestone outcrop with a gently sloping top that was originally covered in a primeval forest of beech and hemlock. For hundreds of years, the hill was a landmark on the Ottawa River for First Nations people and later for European traders, adventurers, and industrialists, marking their journeys to the interior of the continent. After the founding of Ottawa, which was then called Bytown, the builders of the Rideau Canal sited a military base on the hill, naming it Barrack Hill. A large fortress was planned for the site following the War of 1812 and the Upper Canada rebellion but the threat of an American invasion subsided and the project was scrapped.

===Selection as a parliamentary precinct===
In 1858, Queen Victoria selected Ottawa as the capital of the Province of Canada. Barrack Hill was chosen as the site of the new parliament buildings for its prominence over the town and the river, and because the Crown already owned it. On 7 May 1859, the Department of Public Works issued a call for design proposals for the new parliament buildings on Barrack Hill, for which 298 drawings were submitted. The number of entries was reduced to three but the panel of judges could not decide whose design should win the contest. Governor General Sir Edmund Walker Head was approached to break the stalemate, and the winners were announced on 29 August 1859.

Contracts to build the Centre Block and departmental buildings were separately awarded. The first was awarded to the team of Thomas Fuller and Chilion Jones, with their Victorian High Gothic scheme of a formal, symmetrical front facing a quadrangle and a more rustic, picturesque back facing the escarpment and bluffs overlooking the Ottawa River. The team of Thomas Stent and Augustus Laver won the prize for the second category, which included the subsequent East and West Blocks structures. These proposals were selected for their sophisticated use of Gothic architecture, which was thought to remind people of parliamentary democracy&#x27;s old European history, and would contradict the republican neoclassical style of architecture used in Washington, D.C. It was also thought that it would be better suited to the rugged surroundings of still wilderness in northern North America, while being stately. $300,000 was allocated for the main building and $120,000 more for each of the several departmental buildings.

===Construction and early use===
Ground was broken on 20 December 1859 and the first stones were laid on 16 April the following year. Prince Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (later King ), laid the cornerstone of the Centre Block on 1 September. Construction of Parliament Hill became the largest construction project undertaken in North America to that date. Workers hit bedrock sooner than expected, necessitating blasting to complete the foundations, which the architects had altered to sit deeper than originally planned. By early 1861, the Canadian Department of Public Works reported over $1.4million had been spent on the venture, leading to the closure of the site in September and the covering of the unfinished structures with tarpaulins until 1863, when construction resumed following a commission of inquiry.

The site was still incomplete when three of the British North American colonies—now the provinces Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick—entered Confederation in 1867, and Ottawa remained the capital of the new country. Within four years, Manitoba, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, and the North-West Territories—now Alberta, Saskatchewan, Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut—were added and, along with the associated bureaucracy, the first three required representation be added in Parliament. The offices of Parliament spread to buildings beyond Parliament Hill.

The British military allocated a nine-pounder naval cannon to Ottawa&#x27;s British army garrison in 1854. The newly created government of the Dominion of Canada purchased the cannon in 1869 and fired it on Parliament Hill as the Noonday Gun, which was colloquially known as &quot;Old Chum&quot;, for many years.

By 1876, the structures of Parliament Hill, and the surrounding fence and gates, were completed. The grounds were designed with the help of architects Thomas Scott and Calvert Vaux. Following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, in late September that year, Prince George, Duke of Cornwall (later King George V)—Queen Victoria&#x27;s grandson—dedicated a large statue that stands on the hill in the late Queen&#x27;s honour.

===Fire, incidents, and renovations===

On 3 February 1916, a fire destroyed the Centre Block. Despite the ongoing war, Governor General Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, re-laid the original cornerstone on 1 September 1916, exactly fifty-six years after his brother the future King Edward VII had first set it. Eleven years later, the rebuilt Centre Block was completed and a new, freestanding bell tower was dedicated as the Peace Tower in commemoration of the Canadians who had died during the First World War.

Parliament Hill has hosted several significant events in Canadian history, including the first visit of the reigning Canadian sovereign King George VI and his consort Queen Elizabeth to his Parliament in 1939. A huge celebration on 8 May 1945 marked Victory in Europe Day, and the first raising of the country&#x27;s new national flag took place on 15 February 1965. Queen Elizabeth II revisited Parliament Hill on 17 April 1982 for the issuing of a royal proclamation of the enactment of the Constitution Act that year.

In April 1989, armed man Charles Yacoub hijacked a Greyhound Lines bus with eleven passengers on board that was travelling to New York City from Montreal, and drove it onto the lawn in front of the Centre Block. A six-hour standoff with police ensued; three shots were fired but there were no injuries.

On 14 September 2001, 100,000 people gathered on the main lawn to honour the victims of the September 11 attacks on the United States that year. Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee was commemorated with the installation of a specially tinted window in the Centre Block on 7 February 2012, one day after Accession Day.

On 22 October 2014, shooting incidents occurred around Parliament Hill. After fatally shooting a Canadian Army soldier stationed as a ceremonial guard at the National War Memorial, a gunman entered the Centre Block of the parliament buildings. There, the shooter engaged in a firefight with Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons Kevin Vickers and members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The incident ended when the shooter was killed by Vickers and RCMP Constable Curtis Barrett. Following the incidents, the Parliamentary Protective Service was created to integrate the House of Commons and Senate security forces with RCMP patrols of the grounds.

Since 2002, an extensive $3 billion renovation-and-rehabilitation project has been underway throughout the precinct&#x27;s buildings to bring the Parliament buildings to modern safety standards and to address their deteriorated state; work is not expected to be complete until after 2028. The West Block was completed in November 2018 before the House of Commons moved there and renovations on the Senate of Canada Building concluded in 2019 to accommodate the Senate while the Centre Block and East Block undergo renovations. Work on the Sir John A. Macdonald Building was completed in 2015 and work on the Wellington Building was completed in 2016. An architectural competition is being held for designs pertaining to the city block south of Wellington Street and a new Visitors Welcome Centre is being built.

==Grounds and name==
The area, which the National Capital Commission maintains, is named by the &quot;Parliament of Canada Act&quot; as &quot;Parliament Hill&quot; and is defined as resting between the Ottawa River to the north, the Rideau Canal and the Colonel By Valley to the east, Wellington Street to the south, and a service road called Kent Street near the Supreme Court to the west. A Victorian, high-gothic, wrought iron fence demarcates the south front of the property. The fence, which is named the Wellington Wall, has its centre on an axis with the Peace Tower to the north and the formal entrance to Parliament Hill the Queen&#x27;s Gates, which Ives &amp; Co. of Montreal forged. Approximately three million visitors come to the hill every year.

The hill&#x27;s main outdoor area is the formal forecourt, which is formed by the arrangement of the Parliament and departmental buildings on the site. This expanse is the site of major celebrations, demonstrations, and traditional shows such as the annual Canada Day celebrations and the Changing of the Guard. To the sides of the buildings are statues, memorials, and at the northwest corner a gazebo called the Summer Pavilion, which is a 1995 reconstruction of an earlier gazebo named Summer House. Summer House was built for the Speaker of the House of Commons in 1877 by Thomas Seaton Scott and demolished in 1956. Summer Pavilion now serves as the National Police Memorial. Beyond the edges of these landscaped areas, the escarpment remains in its natural state. At its base runs part of the Trans-Canada Trail, the portion between the West Block and the Supreme Court building being named the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Trail, in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of Elizabeth&#x27;s accession to the Canadian throne.

In 1976, the Parliament Buildings and the grounds of Parliament Hill were each designated as National Historic Sites of Canada due to their importance as the physical embodiment of the Canadian government and as the focal point of national celebrations.

The &quot;Parliament of Canada Act&quot; prohibits anyone naming any other area or establishment within the National Capital Region &quot;Parliament Hill&quot;, and forbids the production of merchandise bearing that name. Any violation of this law is punishable on summary conviction.

===Parliament Buildings===

The Parliament Buildings are three edifices arranged around three sides of Parliament Hill&#x27;s central lawn. The speakers of each chamber of the legislature oversee the use and administration of the spaces within each building. The Centre Block has the Senate and Commons chambers, and is fronted by the Peace Tower on the south facade, and the Library of Parliament lies at the building&#x27;s rear. The East Block contains ministers&#x27; and senators&#x27; offices, meeting rooms, and other administrative spaces. The West Block is serving as the temporary seat of the House of Commons. The buildings&#x27; unifying architectural style is Gothic Revival.

===Monuments and statues===
More than 20 bronze statues in the grounds commemorate important figures in Canada&#x27;s history. Most are arranged in the gardens behind the three parliamentary buildings and one stands outside the main fence.


A number of other monuments are distributed across the hill, marking historical moments or acting as memorials for larger groups of people.

===Surrounding area===
Though Parliament Hill remains the heart of the parliamentary precinct, expansion beyond the bounded area began in the 1880s with the construction of the Langevin Block across Wellington Street. After private interests purchased land to the east across the canal to build the Château Laurier hotel, growth of the parliamentary infrastructure moved westward along Wellington Street with the erection in the 1930s of the Confederation and Justice Buildings on the north side, and further construction to the south. By the 1970s, the Crown began purchasing other structures or leasing space in the downtown civic area of Ottawa. In 1973, the Crown expropriated the entire block between Wellington and Sparks Streets, intending to construct a south block for Parliament Hill but the government dropped this proposal and instead constructed more office space in Hull, Quebec. In 2021, this idea was revisited, and the Ministry of Public Services announced an architectural design competition for the block.

<doc id="87701" wikidata="Q22314" url="?curid=87701" title="Cargo cult">
<text>Cargo cults were diverse spiritual and political movements that arose among indigenous Melanesians following Western colonisation of the region in the late 19th century. Typically (but not universally) cargo cults included: charismatic prophet figures foretelling an imminent cataclysm and/or a coming utopia for followers—a worldview known as millenarianism; predictions by these prophets of the return of dead ancestors bringing an abundance of food and goods (the &quot;cargo&quot;), typically including a bounty of Western goods or money, often under the belief that ancestral spirits were responsible for their creation; and the instruction by these prophets to followers to appease &quot;ancestral spirits or other powerful beings&quot; to fulfill the prophecy and receive the cargo by either reviving ancestral traditions or adopting new rituals, such as ecstatic dancing or imitating the actions of colonists and military personnel, like flag-raising, marching and/or drilling. Anthropologists have described cargo cults as rooted in pre-existing aspects of Melanesian society, as a reaction to colonial oppression and inequality disrupting traditional village life, or both.

Groups labeled as cargo cults were subject to a considerable number of anthropological publications from the late 1940s to the 1960s. After Melanesian countries gained political independence, few new groups matching the term have emerged since the 1970s, with some surviving cargo cult groups transitioning into indigenous churches and political movements. The term has largely fallen out of favour and is now seldom used among anthropologists, though its use as a metaphor (in the sense of engaging in ritual action to obtain material goods) is widespread outside of anthropology in popular commentary and critique, based on stereotypes of cargo cultists as &quot;primitive and confused people who use irrational means to pursue rational ends&quot;. Recent scholarship on cargo cults has challenged the suitability of the term for the movements associated with it, with recent anthropological sources arguing that the term is born of colonialism and prejudice and does not accurately convey the diversity or nature of the movements within the label, though some anthropologists continue to see the term as having some descriptive value, despite the &quot;heterogeneous, uncertain, and confusing ethnographic reality&quot;.

== Origin of the term and definitions ==
The term &quot;cargo cult&quot; first appeared in print in the November 1945 issue of &quot;Pacific Islands Monthly&quot;, in an entry written by Norris Mervyn Bird, an ‘old Territories resident’, who expressed concern regarding the effects of World War II, the teachings of Christian missionaries and the increasing liberalisation of colonial authorities in Melanesia would have on local islanders.

Previous similar phenomena, first documented in the late 19th century, had been labelled with the term &quot;Vailala Madness&quot;, to which the term &quot;cargo cult&quot; was then retroactively applied. Bird took the term from derogatory descriptions used by planters and businessmen in the Australian Territory of Papua. From this issue, the term became used in anthropology following the publications of Australian anthropologists Lucy Mair and H. Ian Hogbin in the late 1940s and early 1950s.&quot;&quot;

Peter Worsley defined cargo cults as follows in his 1957 book &quot;The Trumpet Shall Sound&quot;; this description became the standard definition of the term:

In 1964, Peter Lawrence described the term as follows: &quot;A cargo &quot;belief&quot; (myth) described how European goods were invented by a cargo deity and indicated how men could get them from him via their ancestors by following a cargo prophet or leader. Cargo &quot;ritual&quot; was any religious activity designed to produce goods in this way and assumed to have been taught [to] the leader [of the cargo cult] by the deity. ... A cargo &quot;cult&quot; [was] a complex of ritual activity associated with a particular cargo myth&quot;.

In 2010 Australian anthropologist Martha Macintyre gave the following elements as what she considered characteristic of cargo cults:

Anthropologist Lamont Lindstrom has written that some anthropologists consider the term to be a &quot;false category&quot; because it &quot;bundles together diverse and particular uprisings, disturbances, and movements that may have little in common&quot;. Lindstrom also writes that &quot;anthropologists and journalists borrowed the term to label almost any sort of organised, village-based social movement with religious and political aspirations&quot;, and that their usage of the term &quot;could encompass a variety of forms of social unrest that ethnographers elsewhere tagged millenarian, messianic, nativistic, vitalistic, revivalistic, or culture-contact or adjustment movements&quot;. Lindstrom writes that while many anthropologists suggest that &quot;cargo&quot; often signified literal material goods, it could also reflect desires for &quot;moral salvation, existential respect, or proto-nationalistic, anti-colonial desire for political autonomy&quot;.

== Causes, beliefs, and practices ==

Characteristic elements of most cargo cults include the synthesis of indigenous and foreign elements in the belief system, the expectation of help from ancestors, the presence of charismatic leaders, and strong belief in the appearance of an abundance of goods.

The indigenous societies of Melanesia were typically characterized by a &quot;big man&quot; political system in which individuals gained prestige through gift exchanges. The more wealth a man could distribute, the more people who were in his debt, and the greater his renown. Faced, through colonialism, with foreigners with a seemingly unending supply of goods for exchange, indigenous Melanesians experienced &quot;value dominance&quot;. That is, they were dominated by others in terms of their own (not the foreign) value system. Many Melanesians found the concept of money incomprehensible, and many cargo cult movements ordered followers to abandon colonial money by either dumping it into the sea or spending it rapidly, with the prophets promising that it would be replaced by new money and they would be freed from their debts.

Many cargo cults existed in opposition to colonial rule, often linked to burdens placed on villagers by colonial authorities, such as head taxes. Many cargo cult movements sought to revive ancestral traditions (often in the face of their suppression by missionaries or colonial authorities) such as kava drinking, and/or adopt new rituals such as ecstatic dancing or actions imitative of colonial practices, like flag-raising and marching. Cargo cults often served to unite previously opposing groups. In some movements, the leaders engaged in authoritarian behaviour in order to uphold the new social order, with a particular focus on the issues of sorcery and sexual activity. In some movements sexual morality was relaxed, ignoring the pre-existing customs regarding exogamy and incest, while in other movements, strict celibacy policies were implemented.

Since the modern manufacturing process was largely unknown to them, members, leaders, and prophets of the cults often maintained that the manufactured goods of the non-native culture had been created by spiritual means, such as through their deities and ancestors, or that an ancestor had learned how to manufacture the goods. These leaders claimed that the goods were intended for the local indigenous people, but the foreigners had unfairly gained control of these objects through malice or mistake. Thus, a characteristic feature of cargo cults was the belief that spiritual agents would, at some future time, give much valuable cargo and desirable manufactured products to the cult members. The goods promised by prophets and the means by which they would arrive both changed with the times, across eras of Western colonization. The earliest known cults foretold their ancestors with the goods would arrive on a canoe, then by sail, then by steamship, and the goods could be matches, steel, or calico fabric. After World War II, the goods could be shoes, canned meat, knives, rifles, or ammunition, and they would arrive by armored ship or plane.

== Examples ==
=== First occurrences ===
Discussions of cargo cults usually begin with a series of movements that occurred in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. The earliest recorded movement that has been described as a &quot;cargo cult&quot; was the Tuka Movement that began in Fiji in 1885 at the height of the colonial era&#x27;s plantation-style economy. The movement began with a promised return to a golden age of ancestral potency. Minor alterations to priestly practices were undertaken to update them and attempt to recover some kind of ancestral efficacy. Colonial authorities saw the leader of the movement, Tuka, as a troublemaker, and he was exiled, although their attempts to stop him returning proved fruitless.

Cargo cults occurred periodically in many parts of the island of New Guinea, including the Taro Cult in northern Papua New Guinea and the Vailala Madness that arose from 1919 to 1922. The last was documented by Francis Edgar Williams, one of the first anthropologists to conduct fieldwork in Papua New Guinea. Less dramatic cargo cults have appeared in western New Guinea as well, including the Asmat and Dani areas.

=== Pacific cults of World War II ===

The most widely known period of cargo cult activity occurred among the Melanesian islanders in the years during and after World War II. A small population of indigenous peoples observed, often directly in front of their dwellings, the largest war ever fought by technologically advanced nations. Japanese forces used their foreknowledge of local cargo cult beliefs, intentionally misrepresenting themselves as the ancestors of the Melanesians and distributing goods freely in order to acquire compliance and labor. Later the Allied forces arrived in the islands and did this as well.

The vast amounts of military equipment and supplies that both sides airdropped (or airlifted to airstrips) to troops on these islands meant drastic changes to the lifestyle of the islanders, many of whom had never seen outsiders before. Manufactured clothing, medicine, canned food, tents, weapons and other goods arrived in vast quantities for the soldiers, who often shared some of it with the islanders who were their guides and hosts. This was true of the Japanese Army as well, at least initially before relations deteriorated in most regions.

In the late 1930s, the John Frum movement emerged on Tanna in Vanuatu. This tradition urged islanders to resume dancing and kava drinking (which had been suppressed by missionaries) and to maintain historic traditions. The movement predicted American assistance, which as foretold arrived in 1942. The movements rituals were influenced by Christianity, and also included similar elements to other cargo cults like &quot;marching and drilling, flags and poles, and flowers&quot;.&quot;&quot; The John Frum movement has come to be described as the &quot;archetypal&quot; cargo cult.

=== Postwar developments ===
With the end of the war, the military abandoned the airbases and stopped dropping cargo. In response, charismatic individuals developed cults among remote Melanesian populations that promised to bestow on their followers deliveries of food, arms, Jeeps, etc. The cult leaders explained that the cargo would be gifts from their own ancestors, or other sources, as had occurred with the outsider armies.

In attempts to get cargo to fall by parachute or land in planes or ships again, islanders imitated the same practices they had seen the military personnel use. Cult behaviors usually involved mimicking the day-to-day activities and dress styles of US soldiers, such as performing parade ground drills with wooden or salvaged rifles. The islanders carved headphones from wood and wore them while sitting in fabricated control towers. They waved the landing signals while standing on the runways. They lit signal fires and torches to light up runways and lighthouses.

In a form of sympathetic magic, many built life-size replicas of airplanes out of straw and cut new military-style landing strips out of the jungle, hoping to attract more airplanes. The cult members thought that the foreigners had some special connection to the deities and ancestors of the natives, who were the only beings powerful enough to produce such riches.

Cargo cults were typically created by individual leaders, or big men in the Melanesian culture. The leaders typically held cult rituals well away from established towns and colonial authorities, thus making reliable information about these practices very difficult to acquire.

== Current status ==
Some cargo cults are still active. These include:
* The John Frum cult on Tanna Island (Vanuatu)
* The Tom Navy cult on Tanna Island (Vanuatu)
* The Prince Philip Movement on the island of Tanna, which worships Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh
* The Turaga movement based on Pentecost island (Vanuatu)
* Yali&#x27;s cargo cult on Papua New Guinea (Madang region)
* The Paliau movement on Papua New Guinea (Manus Island)
* The Peli association on Papua New Guinea
* The Pomio Kivung on Papua New Guinea

Classification of groups as cargo cults was sometimes controversial. For example, in 1962 the separatist Hahalis Welfare Society on Buka Island was classed by Australian authorities as a cargo cult, but this was denied by its leaders Francis Hagai and John Teosin. As of 1993, Lamont Lindstrom reports that many Melanesian political movements &quot;must take care to deny explicitly&quot; any connection with cargo cults.

== Theoretical explanations ==
Anthropologist Anthony F. C. Wallace conceptualized the &quot;Tuka movement&quot; as a revitalization movement. Peter Worsley&#x27;s analysis of cargo cults placed the emphasis on the economic and political causes of these popular movements. He viewed them as &quot;proto-national&quot; movements by indigenous peoples seeking to resist colonial interventions. He observed a general trend away from millenarianism towards secular political organization through political parties and cooperatives.

Theodore Schwartz was the first to emphasize that both Melanesians and Europeans place great value on the demonstration of wealth. &quot;The two cultures, broadly speaking, met on the common ground of materialistic, competitive striving for prestige through entrepreneurial achievement of wealth.&quot; Melanesians felt &quot;relative deprivation&quot; in their standard of living, and thus came to focus on cargo as an essential expression of their personhood and agency.

Peter Lawrence was able to add greater historical depth to the study of cargo cults, and observed the striking continuity in the indigenous value systems from pre-cult times to the time of his study. Kenelm Burridge, in contrast, placed more emphasis on cultural change, and on the use of memories of myths to comprehend new realities, including the &quot;secret&quot; of European material possessions. His emphasis on cultural change follows from Worsley&#x27;s argument on the effects of capitalism; Burridge points out these movements were more common in coastal areas which faced greater intrusions from European colonizers.

Cargo cults often develop during a combination of crises. Under conditions of social stress, such a movement may form under the leadership of a charismatic figure. This leader may have a &quot;vision&quot; (or &quot;myth-dream&quot;) of the future, often linked to an ancestral efficacy (&quot;mana&quot;) thought to be recoverable by a return to traditional morality. This leader may characterize the present state as a dismantling of the old social order, meaning that social hierarchy and ego boundaries have been broken down.

Contact with colonizing groups brought about a considerable transformation in the way indigenous peoples of Melanesia have thought about other societies. Early theories of cargo cults began from the assumption that practitioners simply failed to understand technology, colonization, or capitalist reform; in this model, cargo cults are a misunderstanding of the systems involved in resource distribution, and an attempt to acquire such goods in the wake of interrupted trade. However, many of these practitioners actually focus on the importance of sustaining and creating new &quot;social&quot; relationships, with material relations being secondary.

Since the late twentieth century, alternative theories have arisen. For example, some scholars, such as Kaplan and Lindstrom, focus on Europeans&#x27; characterization of these movements as a fascination with manufactured goods and what such a focus says about consumerism. Others point to the need to see each movement as reflecting a particularized historical context, even eschewing the term &quot;cargo cult&quot; for them unless there is an attempt to elicit an exchange relationship from Europeans.

=== Discourse on cargo cults ===
According to Ton Otto, the most forceful criticism of the term &quot;cargo cult&quot; comes from Nancy McDowell, who argues that cargo cults don&#x27;t really exist as a distinct phenomenon, but rather reflect a general bias in some observers to view change as sudden and complete rather than gradual and evolutionary. Otto disagrees, arguing that McDowell overly focused on just one aspect of the term (the perception of change), and that the term remains a valuable analytical and comparative tool because it encapsulates a range of features that, when combined, allow for useful comparisons of social movements that frequently shared similar characteristics, even if not all features were present in every case.

Otto also summarizes Lamont Lindstrom&#x27;s analysis and examination of &quot;cargoism&quot;, the discourse of Western scholarship about cargo cults. Lindstrom&#x27;s analysis is concerned with Western fascination with the phenomenon in both academic and popular writing. In his opinion, the term &quot;cargo cult&quot; is deeply problematic because of its pejorative connotation of backwardness, since it imputes a goal (cargo) obtained through the wrong means (cult); the actual goal is not so much obtaining material goods as creating and renewing social relationships under threat. Martha Kaplan thus argues in favor of erasing the term altogether, though Otto argues the term remains useful. The term &quot;cargo cult&quot; is increasingly avoided in the field of anthropology for failing to represent the complexity of Melanesian beliefs.

In the late 1990s, religious scholar Andreas Grünschloß applied the term &quot;cargoism&quot; to adherents of UFO religions regarding their millenarian beliefs about the arrival of intelligent aliens on technologically advanced spacecrafts on planet Earth, in comparison to the Melanesian islanders&#x27;s faith in the return of John Frum carrying the cargo with him on the islands.

== As a metaphor ==
The term &quot;cargo cult&quot; is widely used negatively as a metaphor outside anthropology. Usage often relates to the ideas of desire (particularly for wealth and material goods) and relatedly consumerism and capitalism, ritual action and the expectation of rational results from irrational means, though the term has been used as a general pejorative for &quot;almost anything that some critic depreciates&quot;.

<doc id="87710" wikidata="Q2707153" url="?curid=87710" title="Dolby noise-reduction system">
<text>A Dolby noise-reduction system, or Dolby NR, is one of a series of noise reduction systems developed by Dolby Laboratories for use in analog audio tape recording. The first was &quot;Dolby A&quot;, a professional broadband noise reduction system for recording studios that was first demonstrated in 1965, but the best-known is &quot;Dolby B&quot; (introduced in 1968), a sliding band system for the consumer market, which helped make high fidelity practical on cassette tapes, which used a relatively noisy tape size and speed. It is common on high-fidelity stereo tape players and recorders to the present day, although Dolby has as of 2016 ceased licensing the technology for new cassette decks. Of the noise reduction systems, &quot;Dolby A&quot; and &quot;Dolby SR&quot; were developed for professional use. &quot;Dolby B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;S&quot; were designed for the consumer market. Aside from Dolby HX, all the Dolby variants work by companding: compressing the dynamic range of the sound during recording, and expanding it during playback.

== Process ==
When recording a signal on magnetic tape, there is a low level of noise in the background which sounds like hissing. One solution to this issue is to use low-noise tape, which records more signal, and less noise. Other solutions are to run the tape at a higher speed or use a wider tape. Cassette tapes were originally designed to trade off fidelity for the convenience of recording voice by using a very narrow tape running at a very slow speed of housed in a simple plastic shell when or tape speeds were for high fidelity, and was of lower fidelity. As a result of their narrow tracks and slow speed, cassettes make tape hiss a very severe problem.

Dolby noise reduction is a form of dynamic pre-emphasis employed during recording, plus a form of dynamic de-emphasis used during playback, which work in tandem to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The signal-to-noise ratio is simply how large the music signal is compared to the low level of tape noise with no signal. When the music is loud, the low background hiss level is not noticeable, but when the music is soft or in silence, most or all of what can be heard is the noise. If the recording level is adjusted so that the music is always loud, then the low-level noise would not be audible.

One cannot simply increase the volume of the recording to achieve this end; tapes have a maximum volume they can record, so already-loud sounds will become distorted. The idea is to increase the volume of the recording only when the original material is not already loud, and then reduce the volume by the same amount on playback so that the signal returns to the original volume levels. When the volume is reduced on playback, the noise level is reduced by the same amount. This basic concept, increasing the volume to overwhelm inherent noise, is known as pre-emphasis, and is found in a number of products.

On top of this basic concept, Dolby noise reduction systems add another improvement. This takes into account the fact that tape noise is largely heard at frequencies above 1,000 Hz. It is the lower-frequency sounds that are often loud, like drum beats, so by only applying the companding to certain frequencies, the total amount of distortion of the original signal can be reduced and focused only on the problematic frequencies. The differences in the various Dolby products are largely evident in the precise set of frequencies that they use and the amount of modification of the original signal volume that is applied to each of the frequency bands.

Within each band, the amount of pre-emphasis applied depends on the original signal volume. For instance, in Dolby B, a low-level signal will be boosted by 10 dB, while signals at the &quot;Dolby Level&quot;, +3 VU, receive no signal modification at all. Between the two limits, a varying level of pre-emphasis is applied. On playback, the opposite process is applied (de-emphasis), based on the relative signal component above 1 kHz. Thus, as this portion of the signal decreases in amplitude, the higher frequencies are progressively increasingly attenuated, which also reduces in level the constant background noise on the tape when and where it would be most noticeable.

The two processes (pre- and de-emphasis) are intended to cancel each other out as far as the actual recorded program material is concerned. During playback, only de-emphasis is applied to the incoming off-tape signal and noise. After playback de-emphasis is complete, the apparent noise in the output signal is reduced, and this process should not produce any other effect noticeable to the listener other than reduced background noise. However, playback without noise reduction produces a noticeably brighter sound.

The correct calibration of the recording and playback circuitry is critical in order to ensure faithful reproduction of the original program content. The calibration can easily be upset by poor-quality tape, dirty or misaligned recording/playback heads, or using inappropriate bias levels/frequency for the tape formulation, as well as tape speed when recording or duplicating. This can manifest itself as muffled-sounding playback, or &quot;breathing&quot; of the noise level as the volume level of the signal varies.

On some high-end consumer equipment, a Dolby calibration control is included. For recording, a reference tone at Dolby Level may be recorded for accurate playback level calibration on another transport. At playback, the same recorded tone should produce the identical output, as indicated by a Dolby logo marking at approximately +3 VU on the VU meter(s). In consumer equipment, Dolby Level is defined as 200 nWb/m, and calibration tapes were available to assist with the task of correct level setting. For accurate off-the-tape monitoring during recording on 3-head tape decks, both processes must be employed at once, and circuitry provided to accomplish this is marketed under the &quot;Double Dolby&quot; label.

== Dolby A ==
Dolby A-type noise reduction was the Dolby company&#x27;s first noise reduction system, presented in 1965. It was intended for use in professional recording studios, where it became commonplace, gaining widespread acceptance at the same time that multitrack recording became standard. The input signal is split into frequency bands by four filters with 12 dB per octave slopes, with cutoff frequencies (3 dB down points) as follows: low-pass at 80 Hz; band-pass from 80 Hz to 3 kHz; a high-pass from 3 kHz; and another high-pass at 9 kHz. (The stacking of contributions from the two high-pass bands allows greater noise reduction in the upper frequencies.) The compander circuit has a threshold of −40 dB, with a ratio of 2:1 for a compression/expansion of 10 dB. This provides about 10 dB of noise reduction increasing to a possible 15 dB at 15 kHz, according to articles written by Ray Dolby and published by the Audio Engineering Society (October 1967) and Audio (June/July 1968).

As with the Dolby B-type system, correct matching of the compression and expansion processes is important. The calibration of the expansion (decoding) unit for magnetic tape uses a flux level of 185 nWb/m, which is the level used on industry calibration tapes such as those from Ampex; this is set to 0 VU on the tape recorder playback and to Dolby Level on the noise reduction unit. In the record (compression or encoding) mode, a characteristic tone (Dolby Tone) generated inside the noise reduction unit is set to 0 VU on the tape recorder and to 185 nWb/m on the tape.

The Dolby A-type system also saw some use as the method of noise reduction in optical sound for motion pictures. In 2004, Dolby A-type noise reduction was inducted into the TECnology Hall of Fame, an honor given to &quot;products and innovations that have had an enduring impact on the development of audio technology.&quot;

== Dolby B ==


Dolby B-type noise reduction was developed after Dolby A, and it was introduced in 1968. It consisted of a single sliding band system providing about 9 dB of noise reduction (A-weighted), primarily for use with cassette tapes. It was much simpler than Dolby A and therefore much less expensive to implement in consumer products. Dolby B recordings are acceptable when played back on equipment that does not possess a Dolby B decoder, such as many inexpensive portable and car cassette players. Without the de-emphasis effect of the decoder, the sound will be perceived as brighter as high frequencies are emphasized, which can be used to offset &quot;dull&quot; high-frequency response in inexpensive equipment. However, Dolby B provides less effective noise reduction than Dolby A, generally by an amount of more than 3 dB.

The Dolby B system is effective from approximately 1 kHz upwards; the noise reduction that is provided is 3 dB at 600 Hz, 6 dB at 1.2 kHz, 8 dB at 2.4 kHz, and 10 dB at 5 kHz. The width of the noise reduction band is variable, as it is designed to be responsive to both the amplitude and the frequency distribution of the signal. It is thus possible to obtain significant amounts of noise reduction down to quite low frequencies without causing audible modulation of the noise by the signal (&quot;breathing&quot;).

From the mid-1970s, Dolby B became standard on commercially pre-recorded music cassettes even though some low-end equipment lacked decoding circuitry, although it allows for acceptable playback on such equipment. Most pre-recorded cassettes use this variant. VHS video recorders used Dolby B on linear stereo audio tracks.
Prior to the introduction of later consumer variants (Dolby C being the first), cassette hardware supporting Dolby B and cassettes encoded with it would be labeled simply &quot;Dolby System,&quot; &quot;Dolby NR&quot;, or wordlessly with the Dolby symbol. This continued in some record labels and hardware manufacturers even after Dolby C had been introduced, during the period when the new standard was relatively little-known.

JVC&#x27;s system, used in place of Dolby B on earlier JVC cassette decks, is considered compatible with Dolby B. JVC eventually abandoned the ANRS standard in favor of official Dolby B support; some JVC decks exist whose noise-reduction toggles have a combined &quot;ANRS / Dolby B&quot; setting.

===Dolby FM===

In the early 1970s, some expected Dolby NR to become normal in FM radio broadcasts and some tuners and amplifiers were manufactured with decoding circuitry; there were also some tape recorders with a Dolby B &quot;pass-through&quot; mode. In 1971 WFMT started to transmit programs with Dolby NR, and soon some 17 stations broadcast with noise reduction, but by 1974 it was already on the decline. Dolby FM was based on Dolby B, but used a modified 25 μs pre-emphasis time constant and a frequency-selective companding arrangement to reduce noise.

A similar system named High Com FM was evaluated in Germany between July 1979 and December 1981 by IRT, and field-trialed up to 1984. It was based on the Telefunken High Com broadband compander system, but never introduced commercially in FM broadcasting. Another competing system was FMX, which was based on CX.

===RMS===

A fully Dolby B-compatible compander was developed and used on many tape recorders in the former German Democratic Republic in the 1980s. It was called RMS (from , English: &quot;Noise reduction system&quot;).

==Dolby C==


The Dolby C-type noise reduction system was developed in 1980. It provides about 15 dB noise reduction (A-weighted) in the 2 kHz to 8 kHz region where the ear is highly sensitive and most tape hiss is concentrated. Its noise reduction effect results from the dual-level (consisting of a high-level stage and a low-level stage) staggered action arrangement of series-connected compressors and expanders, with an extension to lower frequencies than with Dolby B. As in Dolby B, a &quot;sliding band&quot; technique (operating frequency varies with signal level) helps to suppress undesirable &quot;breathing&quot;, which is often a problem with other noise reduction techniques.

As a result of the extra signal processing, Dolby C-type recordings will sound distorted when played back on equipment that does not have the required Dolby C decoding circuitry. Some of this harshness can be mitigated by using Dolby B on playback, which serves to reduce the strength of the high frequencies.

With Dolby C-type processing, noise reduction begins two octaves lower in frequency in an attempt to maintain a psychoacoustically-uniform noise floor. In the region above 8 kHz, where the ear is less sensitive to noise, special spectral-skewing and anti-saturation networks come into play. These circuits prevent cross modulation of low frequencies with high frequencies, suppress tape saturation when large signal transients are present, and increase the effective headroom of the cassette tape system. As a result, recordings are cleaner and crisper with a much improved high-frequency response that the cassette medium heretofore lacked. With a good quality tape, the Dolby C response could be flat to 20 kHz at the 0 dB recording level, a previously unattainable result. An A-weighted signal-to-noise ratio of 72 dB (re 3% THD at 400 Hz) with no unwanted &quot;breathing&quot; effects, even on difficult-to-record passages, was possible.

Dolby C first appeared on higher-end cassette decks in the 1980s. The first commercially available cassette deck with Dolby C was the NAD 6150C, which came onto the market around 1981. Dolby C was also used on professional video equipment for the audio tracks of the Betacam and Umatic SP videocassette formats. In Japan, the first cassette deck with Dolby C was the AD-FF5 from Aiwa. Cassette decks with Dolby C also included Dolby B for backward compatibility, and were usually labeled as having &quot;Dolby B-C NR&quot;.

==Dolby SR==

The Dolby SR (Spectral Recording) system, introduced in 1986, was the company&#x27;s second professional noise reduction system. It is a much more aggressive noise reduction approach than Dolby A. It attempts to maximize the recorded signal at all times using a complex series of filters that change according to the input signal. As a result, Dolby SR is much more expensive to implement than Dolby B or C, but Dolby SR is capable of providing up to 25 dB of noise reduction in the high-frequency range. It is only found on professional recording equipment.

In the motion picture industry, as far as it concerns distribution prints of movies, the Dolby A and SR markings refer to Dolby Surround which is not just a method of noise reduction, but more importantly encodes two additional audio channels on the standard optical soundtrack, giving left, center, right, and surround.

SR prints are fairly well backward compatible with old Dolby A equipment. The Dolby SR-D marking refers to both analog Dolby SR and digital Dolby Digital soundtracks on one print.

==Dolby S==

Dolby S was introduced in 1989. It was intended that Dolby S would become standard on commercial pre-recorded music cassettes in much the same way that Dolby B had in the 1970s, but it came to market when the Compact Cassette was being replaced by the compact disc as the dominant mass market music format. Dolby Labs claimed that most members of the general public could not differentiate between the sound of a CD and a Dolby S encoded cassette. Dolby S mostly appeared on high-end audio equipment and was never widely used, although it did filter down to several mid-tier models manufactured during the mid to late 1990s.

Dolby S is much more resistant to playback problems caused by noise from the tape transport mechanism than Dolby C. Likewise, Dolby S was also claimed to have playback compatibility with Dolby B in that a Dolby S recording could be played back on older Dolby B equipment with some benefit being realized. It is basically a cut-down version of Dolby SR optimized specifically for cassette recording, and uses many of the same noise reduction techniques. Dolby S is capable of 10 dB of noise reduction at low frequencies and up to 24 dB of noise reduction at high frequencies.

As with Dolby C, it is not &quot;just&quot; a noise reduction system. It employs the same anti-saturation and spectral skewing techniques as those used by Dolby C, reducing the effects of tape saturation and allowing for improved high frequency performance at high recording levels.
==Dolby HX/HX-Pro==

Magnetic tape is inherently non-linear in nature due to hysteresis of the magnetic material. If an analog signal were recorded directly onto magnetic tape, its reproduction would be extremely distorted due to this non-linearity. To overcome this, a high-frequency signal, known as bias, is mixed in with the recorded signal, which &quot;pushes&quot; the envelope of the signal into the linear region. If the audio signal contains strong high-frequency content (in particular from percussion instruments such as hi-hat cymbals), this adds to the constant bias causing magnetic saturation on the tape. Dynamic, or adaptive, biasing automatically reduces the bias signal in the presence of strong high-frequency signals, making it possible to record at a higher signal level.

The original Dolby HX, where &quot;HX&quot; stands for &quot;Headroom eXtension&quot;, was invented in 1979 by Kenneth Gundry of Dolby Laboratories, and was rejected by the industry for its inherent flaws. Bang &amp; Olufsen continued work in the same direction, which resulted in a 1981 patent (EP 0046410) by Jørgen Selmer Jensen. Bang &amp; Olufsen immediately licensed HX-Pro to Dolby Laboratories, stipulating a priority period of several years for use in consumer products, to protect their own Beocord 9000 cassette tape deck. By the middle of the 1980s the Bang &amp; Olufsen system, marketed through Dolby Laboratories, became an industry standard under the name of Dolby HX Pro.

HX-Pro only applies during the recording process. The improved signal-to-noise ratio is available no matter which tape deck the tape is played back on, and therefore HX-Pro is not a noise-reduction system in the same way as Dolby A, B, C, and S, although it does help to improve noise reduction encode/decode tracking accuracy by reducing tape non-linearity. Some record companies issued HX-Pro pre-recorded cassette tapes during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

==Today==
The widespread proliferation of digital audio in professional and consumer applications (e.g., compact discs, music download, music streaming) has made analog audio production less prevalent and therefore changed Dolby&#x27;s focus on Dolby Vision, but Dolby&#x27;s analog noise reduction systems are still widely used in niche analog production environments.

<text>That Was the Week That Was, informally TWTWTW or TW3, is a satirical television comedy programme that aired on BBC Television in 1962 and 1963. It was devised, produced, and directed by Ned Sherrin and Jack (aka John) Duncan, and presented by David Frost.

The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s, as it broke ground in comedy by lampooning political figures. TW3 was broadcast from Saturday, 24 November 1962 to late December 1963. An American version under the same title aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.

==Cast and writers==
Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang, David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song – &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot; – sung by Martin to Ron Grainer&#x27;s theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested in one episode with stand-up comedy.

Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Robin Grove-White, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.

==Programme==

The programme opened with a song (&quot;That was the week that was, It&#x27;s over, let it go ...&quot;) sung by Millicent Martin, backed by the resident Dave Lee house band, including guitarist Cedric West. The opening song featured new lyrics each week referring to the news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Some other targets included the monarchy, the British Empire, nuclear deterrence, advertising, public relations and propaganda, capital punishment, sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include the 12 January 1963 &quot;consumers&#x27; guide to religion&quot;, which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a &quot;Which?&quot; magazine report and led to the Church of England being described a &#x27;best buy&#x27;.

The programme was not party political but did not treat all issues with what the producers considered to be a false level of impartiality and balance; one example of this is the issue of racism and &quot;the evils of apartheid&quot;, following the view of BBC Director-General Sir Hugh Greene that the BBC should not be bound by its charter to be impartial on issues of racism, which Greene and the producers of &quot;TW3&quot; viewed as &quot;quite simply wrong&quot;. Following the 1963 murder of 35-year-old white postal worker William Lewis Moore in Alabama, who was on a protest march against segregation in the American South, &quot;TW3&quot; Millicent Martin dressed as Uncle Sam sang a parody of &quot;I Wanna Go Back to Mississippi&quot; (&quot;... where the Mississippi mud/kinda mingles with the blood/of the niggers who are hanging from the branches of the tree ...&quot;) accompanied by minstrel singers in blackface (&quot;... we hate all the darkies and the Catholics and the Jews / Where we welcome any man / Who is white and strong and belongs to the Ku Klux Klan&quot;), thus parodying &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot;, which was then being shown on the BBC despite accusations of racism over its use of blackface.

On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called &quot;Little J. D. Watson&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;d have thought he&#x27;d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn&#x27;t it&quot;. The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover the structure of DNA; much younger than the others.

&quot;TW3&quot; was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of &quot;The Third Man&quot; television series after the end of &quot;TW3&quot;. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, at the end of each episode Frost read out a brief summary of the plot of the episode of &quot;The Third Man&quot; that was due to follow the show, spoiling its twists, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of Greene.

Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark &quot;But seriously, he&#x27;s doing a grand job&quot;. At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: &quot;That &quot;was&quot; the week, that was.&quot; At the end of the final programme he announced: &quot;That &quot;was&quot; &quot;‘That Was The Week That Was’&quot; …that was.&quot;

===Kennedy tribute===
&quot;TW3&quot; produced a shortened 20-minute programme with no satire for the edition on Saturday, 23 November 1963, the day after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. It featured a contribution from Dame Sybil Thorndike and Millicent Martin performing the tribute song &quot;In the Summer of His Years&quot; by Herbert Kretzmer. This was screened on NBC the following day, and the soundtrack was released by Decca Records. A clip featuring Roy Kinnear was shown in the David L. Wolper documentary film &quot;Four Days in November&quot; and on the History Channel 2009 documentary &quot;JFK: 3 Shots that Changed America&quot;. BBC presenter Richard Dimbleby broadcast the president&#x27;s funeral from Washington, and he said that the programme was a good expression of the sorrow felt in Britain.

==Reception==
Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was initially supportive of the programme, chastising Postmaster General Reginald Bevins for threatening to &quot;do something about it&quot;. However, the BBC received many complaints from organisations and establishment figures. Lord Aldington, vice-chairman of the Conservative Party, wrote to BBC director-general Hugh Greene that Frost had a hatred of the prime minister which &quot;he finds impossible to control&quot;. The programme also attracted complaints from the Boy Scout Association about an item questioning the sexuality of its founder Lord Baden-Powell, and from the government of Cyprus which claimed that a joke about their ruler Archbishop Makarios was a &quot;gross violation of internationally accepted ethics&quot;.

Historians have identified &quot;TW3&quot; as breaking ground in comedy and broadcasting. Graham McCann said that it challenged the &quot;convention that television should not acknowledge that it is television; the show made no attempt to hide its cameras, allowed the microphone boom to intrude, and often revealed other nuts and bolts of studio technology.&quot; This was unusual in the 1960s and gave the programme a modern feel. &quot;TW3&quot; also flouted conventions by adopting &quot;a relaxed attitude to its running time&quot;, and &quot;it seemed to last just as long as it wanted&quot;.

The programme was taken off the air at short notice in December 1963 with the explanation that &quot;1964 is a General Election year&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;TW3&quot; was broadcast live, but it was normally recorded for legal reasons; only the pilot episode was not recorded. A compilation of material was shown on BBC Four to celebrate the 40th anniversary. The series placed 29th in the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes in 2000.

==Alternative versions==
=== US versions ===
An American version was on NBC from 10 November 1963 to May 1965. The pilot featured Henry Fonda and Henry Morgan, with Mike Nichols and Elaine May as guests, and supporting performers including Gene Hackman. The recurring cast included Frost, Morgan, Buck Henry, Tom Bosley,&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube/NBC/TWTWTW&quot;&gt;
*
&lt;/ref&gt; and Alan Alda, with Nancy Ames singing an opening news-satire-song and Stanley Grover and Ames performing solos and duets. Regularly contributing writers included Gloria Steinem, William F. Brown, Tom Lehrer, and Calvin Trillin. Norman Paris was the musical director. The announcer was Jerry Damon. A running gag was a mock feud with Jack Paar, whose own program followed &quot;TW3&quot; on the NBC Friday schedule; Paar repeatedly referred to &quot;TW3&quot; as &quot;Henry Morgan&#x27;s Amateur Hour&quot;.

Of 50 episodes, only a few survive in video form, yet audio episodes survive on acetate disc. The first-season black-and-white episodes were preserved on kinescope film; the surviving colour episodes of the second and final season were recorded in the then-standard two-inch colour quadruplex videotape format. The Paley Center has copies of some seven episodes, including the hour-long pilot. Also, scripts of all shows survive, both in the NBC Collection at the Library of Congress and in the papers of executive producer Leland Hayward at the New York Public Library. Amateur audio recordings of all or nearly all episodes also survive, and an hour-long recording, &quot;That Was That Was The Week That Was,&quot; a compilation of bits from various shows, was issued on LP and, in 1992, reissued on CD. After the series&#x27; cancellation, Lehrer, who did not appear on the show, recorded a collection of his songs used on the show on &quot;That Was The Year That Was&quot;, released by Reprise Records in September 1965.

ABC aired a &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot; special on 21 April 1985, hosted by David Frost and Anne Bancroft and featuring future &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast members Jan Hooks and A. Whitney Brown and puppetry from &quot;Spitting Image&quot;.

=== Other international versions ===

A Canadian show, &quot;This Hour Has Seven Days&quot;, aired from 1964 to 1966 on CBC. Although partially inspired by &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot;, the Canadian show mixed satirical aspects with more serious journalism. It proved controversial and was cancelled after two seasons amid allegations of political interference. &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;, created by Newfoundland comic Mary Walsh, has been running since 1992 although the two are not related.

An Australian show, &quot;The Mavis Bramston Show&quot;, aired from 1964 to 1968 on the Seven Network. It grew out of the recent local theatrical tradition of topical satirical revue—most notably the popular revues staged at Sydney&#x27;s Phillip Street Theatre in the 1950s and 1960s—but it was also strongly influenced by the British satire boom and especially &quot;TW3&quot; and &quot;Not Only... But Also&quot;.

The New Zealand show &quot;A Week Of It&quot; ran from 1977 to 1979, hosted by Ken Ellis, and featuring comedians David McPhail, Peter Rowley and Chris McVeigh and comedian/musicians Jon Gadsby and Annie Whittle. The series lampooned news and politics and featured songs, usually by McPhail and Gadsby, who continued with their own show, &quot;McPhail and Gadsby&quot; in similar vein.

A Dutch version, &quot;Zo is het toevallig ook nog &#x27;s een keer&quot; (&quot;It Just So Happens Once Again&quot;), aired from November 1963 to 1966. It became controversial after the fourth edition, which included a parody of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer (&quot;Give us this day our daily television&quot;). Angry viewers directed their protests especially against the most popular cast member: Mies Bouwman. After receiving several threats to her life she decided to quit the show. The show was praised as well: in 1966 it received the Gouden Televizier-ring, a prestigious audience award—though it turned out afterward that the election was rigged.

An Indian version titled &quot;The Week That Wasn&#x27;t&quot; was launched and hosted by Cyrus Broacha.

In 2004, ABC News revived the iconic TW3 theme song as a closing segment on its weekly magazine program, Primetime Live. Several two-minute episodes aired, but never caught on with the audience.

==Parodies==
Cleveland, Ohio, local personality Ghoulardi (played by Ernie Anderson), host of WJW-TV&#x27;s &quot;Shock Theater&quot; in the 1960s, ran clips of local celebrities and politicians and satirised them in a &quot;Shock Theater&quot; segment entitled &quot;That Was Weak Wasn&#x27;t It?&quot;

Beginning in 2006, 1812 Productions, an all comedy theatre company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has annually performed a stage show called &quot;This Is the Week That Is&quot;. The variety show style play is written by its small cast with a script that changes nightly over several weeks of performances, and includes improvised comedy, musical parodies, and a versatile cast of performers. The show focuses on politics and news from the preceding year, often taking on local Philadelphia stories as well. In 2019, a documentary, &quot;In the Field; Conceiving Satire: The Making of This Is The Week That Is&quot;, about the creation of the long-running show was commissioned by the American Theatre Wing and nominated for a Mid-Atlantic Emmy Award for Arts Program/Special.

<doc id="87716" wikidata="Q5589389" url="?curid=87716" title="Government of the Cayman Islands">
<text>The Cayman Islands is a parliamentary representative democratic dependency. As a British Overseas Territories, Charles III is the head of state. The Premier of the Cayman Islands is the head of government. Executive power is exercised by the government, legislative power is vested in both the government and the Parliament of the Cayman Islands. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.

The Cayman Islands&#x27; physical isolation under early British colonial rule allowed the development of an indigenous set of administrative and legal traditions which were codified into a constitution in 1959. A constitution, which devolved some authority from the United Kingdom to the Cayman Islands Government, was passed by referendum on 20 May 2009. Subsequently, the islands have become largely self-governing.

The Cayman Islands Government is aided by a tradition of restrained civil governance from the United Kingdom.

==Executive branch==
The Cabinet is appointed by the governor on advice of the premier.
The British Crown appoints a governor, who is recruited from the UK Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office and serves as the British representative, including his role as the direct representative of the monarch of the United Kingdom. Daily administration of the islands is conducted by the Cabinet.

The Deputy Governor, and the Attorney General are appointed by the Governor. Responsibility for defence and foreign affairs resides with the United Kingdom; however, the Deputy Governor handles the Portfolio of the Civil Service, and the Cayman Islands Government may negotiate certain bilateral matters directly with foreign governments.

The Governor can exercise complete executive authority through reserve powers afforded to HMG in the Constitution. However, he must consult with the Premier prior to using such powers and must do so in the interest of the Cayman Islands (so long as it doesn&#x27;t prejudice British interests). He must give royal assent to all legislation, which allows him the power to strike down any law the legislature may see fit for the country. In modern times, the Governor usually allows the country to be run by the Cabinet, and the civil service to be run by the Deputy Governor, who is also the Acting Governor when the Governor is not able to discharge his usual duties for one reason or another. The Governor of the Cayman Islands is Jane Owen and the Deputy Governor is the Honourable Franz Manderson.

List of Ministers:

* Premier of the Cayman Islands and Minister for Sustainability and Climate Resiliency: Hon. Gurney Wayne Panton
* Deputy Premier of the Cayman Islands and Minister for Finance, Economic Development and Labour: Hon. Christopher Saunders
* Minister of Education, District Administration, Lands and Survey: Hon. Juliana O&#x27;Connor-Connolly
* Minister for Tourism and Transport: Hon. Kenneth V. Bryan
* Minister for Home Affairs, Youth, Sports, Culture and Heritage: Hon. Bernie Bush
* Minister for Planning, Agriculture, Housing, and Infrastructure: Hon. Johanny Ebanks
* Minister for Financial Services, Commerce, Investment, Innovation and Social Development: Hon. Andre Ebanks
* Minister for Health and Wellness: Hon. Sabrina Turner

==Legislative branch==
The unicameral Parliament of the Cayman Islands is presided over by an independent speaker. The Parliament has 19 elected members. Elections are held at the discretion of the Governor at least every 4 years. Members of the Parliament may introduce bills which, if passed, are then approved, returned, or disallowed by the Governor. The UK Government also reserves the right to disallow bills approved by the Governor. The Premier is limited to two consecutive terms, after which the individual who was Premier for two terms must sit out a term before being constitutionally eligible to be Premier again.
The Premier is Wayne Panton of the PACT coalition government since 21 April 2021.

==Judicial branch==
The four-tiered judicial system is based on English common law, colonial and local statutes. The Cayman Islands Court of Appeal is the highest court on the Islands, but a final appeal may be heard by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council sitting in London.

The Grand Court, ranking below the Cayman Islands Court of Appeal, was first created in 1877 as a court of special limited jurisdiction by statute. It was established in its present form by the Grand Court Law of 1975, and became a constitutional court in 1984. It is a superior court of record of first instance, having unlimited jurisdiction in both criminal and civil matters, except when it sits as an appellate court from the lower courts or other tribunals. Grand Court judges sit either alone, or with a jury of either seven or, for murder and money laundering trials, 12.

It consists of three divisions:

* Admiralty Division – deals with maritime law
* Family Division – deals with family law, as well as marriage and children
* Financial Services Division

The Grand Court is headed by the Chief Justice of the Cayman Islands, who is appointed by the Governor on advice from the Judicial Service Commission. The current Chief Justice is The Honourable Margaret Ramsay-Hale.

The Financial Services Division of the Grand Court was created in 2009, and is a specialized commercial court track dealing with complex commercial and financial matters.

===List of Chief Judges of the modern Grand Court===
==Administrative divisions==
Districts:
George Town, Bodden Town, West Bay, North Side, East End, Sister Islands (Cayman Brac and Little Cayman)

==International organisation participation==
Caricom (associate), CDB, Interpol (subbureau), IOC, United Kingdom Overseas Territories Association (UKOTA), Association of the Overseas Countries and Territories of the European Union (OCTA)

==History==
From 2002 to 2005 the Government of the Cayman Islands sent some delinquent youth to Tranquility Bay, a privately operated World Wide Association of Specialty Programs and Schools facility in Jamaica. The government funded the students as they were located in the centre.

<doc id="87729" wikidata="Q846981" url="?curid=87729" title="Váli">
<text>In Norse mythology, Váli (Old Norse) or Boe or Bous (Latin) is a god and the son of the god Odin and Rindr (who is either a goddess herself or a human princess, depending on the sources). Váli has numerous brothers including Thor, Baldr, and Víðarr. He was born for the sole purpose of avenging Baldr, and does this by killing Höðr, who was an unwitting participant, and binding Loki with the entrails of his son Narfi. Váli grew to full adulthood within one day of his birth, and slew Höðr before going on to Loki. He is prophesied to survive Ragnarök.

== Attestations ==
===Icelandic sources===
The Váli myth is referred to in &quot;Baldrs draumar&quot;:

:Rindr will bear Váli
:in western halls;
:that son of Óðinn
:will kill when one night old – 
:he will not wash hand,
:nor comb head,
:before he bears to the pyre
:Baldr&#x27;s adversary.
: — translation by Ursula Dronke

In &quot;Völuspá&quot;:

:There formed from that stem,
:which was slender-seeming,
:a shaft of anguish, perilous:
:Hǫðr started shooting.
:A brother of Baldr
:was born quickly:
:he started – Óðinn&#x27;s son – 
:slaying, at one night old.

He was thought of as a great archer and a courageous fighter on the battlefield. The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; (&quot;Gylfaginning&quot;) describes him:

:One is called Ali or Váli, son of Odin and Rindr: He is daring in fights, and a most fortunate marksman.

In stanza 51 of &quot;Vafthrúdnismál&quot;, Vafþrúðnir states that he will survive Ragnarök, along with his brother Víðarr and the sons of Thor, Móði and Magni:
:&quot;In the gods&#x27; home Vithar | and Vali shall dwell,
:When the fires of Surt have sunk;
:Mothi and Magni | shall Mjollnir have
:When Vingnir falls in fight.&quot;

===&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;===
&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; by Saxo Grammaticus is a euhemerised account of the history of the kings of Denmark, but draws on other mythological stories and presents them in a historical context (i.e. presenting gods as human figures from the past). In this story, after the death of Balder at the hands of Hother (the human king of Denmark and Sweden), Odin (a human sorcerer who was believed to be a god) enchants Rinda (a human princess of the Ruthenians) and fathers Boe or Bous on her. This crime leads Odin to be exiled by the other gods for nearly 10 years. When he returns, he seeks out Boe and encourages him to take revenge on Hother. Hother, foreseeing that he will die in the battle, passes the kingship on to his son Rorik. Hother meets Boe in battle and is killed, but Boe also dies of his wounds a day later. The Ruthenian army held a funeral for him and buried him in a barrow.

== Parentage ==
Early mistranslation or confusion has led to a single mention of a Váli who is a son of Loki: &quot;Þá váru teknir synir Loka, Váli ok Nari eða Narfi&quot; from the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, translated as &quot;Then were taken Loki&#x27;s sons, Váli and Nari&quot;. We find the original of the only reference to Váli as &quot;the son of Loki&quot;, while even the same text refers to Baldr&#x27;s death being avenged by his brother (in &quot;Völuspá&quot; 33) as well as Váli being the Son of Odin in &quot;Völuspá&quot; 51, which is repeated in &quot;Baldr&#x27;s draumar&quot;.

In the late period &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; we also see that Odin is said to have a son with Rinda that will avenge his other son, Baldr&#x27;s, death – though in this case the name of this new son is Boe rather than Váli. In all these tales Odin goes out immediately – either through seduction, deception, or force – to sire this son.

Similarly where each of these documents ascribe Váli the role of Loki&#x27;s son we see only in the postscript or translation notes that this transformation was a punishment when in fact the gift of wolf&#x27;s strength and rage is well attested as being granted by Odin to warriors known as &quot;ulfhednar&quot;, which would make his son Váli a Berserker and a possible origin for the &quot;ulfhednar&quot; legend.

Finally we see a different description in Hauksbók. In this version of &quot;Völuspá&quot;, stanza 34 begins: &quot;Þá kná Vála | vígbǫnd snúa&quot;, usually amended to the nominative &quot;Váli&quot; in order to provide a subject for the verb; Ursula Dronke translates it as &quot;Then did Váli | slaughter bonds twist&quot; which presumably refers to Váli, son of Óðinn, who was begotten to avenge Baldr&#x27;s death, and thus it is likely that he bound Loki, while it is highly improbable that it refers to a Váli, son of Loki, who is attested nowhere but one line of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;.

<doc id="87731" wikidata="Q191352" url="?curid=87731" title="Portishead (band)">
<text>Portishead ( ) are an English electronic band formed in 1991 in Bristol. The band comprises Beth Gibbons (vocals), Geoff Barrow (multiple instruments, production), and Adrian Utley (guitar). Dave McDonald, an audio engineer who helped produce their first two albums, is sometimes regarded as the fourth member.

Portishead&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Dummy&quot; (1994), fused hip-hop production with an atmospheric style reminiscent of spy film soundtracks and yearning vocals from Gibbons. It was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, becoming a landmark album in the emerging trip-hop genre. However, the band disliked being associated with the term. Their two other studio albums, &quot;Portishead&quot; (1997) and &quot;Third&quot; (2008), received similar acclaim. Portishead have also released the live album &quot;Roseland NYC Live&quot; (1998).

== History ==
=== Formation and &quot;Dummy&quot; (1991–1995)===
Geoff Barrow and Beth Gibbons formed the band after meeting during a coffee break at an Enterprise Allowance course in Bristol in February 1991. Taking their name from the nearby town of Portishead, they soon recorded &quot;It Could Be Sweet&quot;, their first song for their debut album. They then met Adrian Utley while they were recording at the Coach House Studios in Bristol, and Utley heard the first song Barrow and Gibbons had recorded, and began to exchange ideas on music. The resulting first album by Portishead, &quot;Dummy&quot;, was released in 1994. The cover features a still from the band&#x27;s own short film &quot;To Kill a Dead Man&quot;. At this time, Portishead was a duo of Barrow and Gibbons. Adrian Utley (who co-produced the album, performed on nine of the songs, and co-wrote eight) became an official band member shortly after its release.

Despite the band&#x27;s aversion to press coverage, the album was successful in both Europe and the United States (where it sold more than 150,000 copies even before the band toured there). &quot;Dummy&quot; was positively described by the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; as &quot;musique noire for a movie not yet made&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised its music as &quot;Gothic hip-hop&quot;. &quot;Dummy&quot; spawned three singles: &quot;Numb&quot;, &quot;Sour Times&quot;, and &quot;Glory Box&quot;, and won the Mercury Music Prize in 1995. The success of the album saw the band nominated for Best British Newcomer at the 1995 Brit Awards. &quot;Dummy&quot; was ranked number 419 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album is often considered one of the greatest trip hop albums to date and is a milestone in the definition of the genre.

=== &quot;Portishead&quot; and hiatus (1996–2004) ===
After their initial success, Portishead took a break from the spotlight and touring until their second album, &quot;Portishead&quot;, was released in 1997. The album&#x27;s sound differed from &quot;Dummy&quot;, characterised as &quot;grainy and harsher&quot;, with increased use of live instrumentation and less reliance on sampling. Three singles, &quot;All Mine&quot;, &quot;Over&quot; and &quot;Only You&quot; were released, the first one achieving a Top 10 placing in the UK.

In 1997, the band performed a one-off show with strings at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City; primarily featuring recordings from the show, the live album, &quot;Roseland NYC Live&quot;, includes orchestral arrangements of the group&#x27;s songs and was released in 1998. In 1999, Portishead recorded the song &quot;Motherless Child&quot; with Tom Jones for his album &quot;Reload&quot;. A DVD of Portishead&#x27;s Roseland Ballroom performance, with substantial extra material including many early musical videos, was released in 2002. For the next few years, the band members concentrated on solo projects and other pursuits.

=== &quot;Third&quot; (2005–2008) ===
In February 2005, the band appeared live for the first time in seven years at the Tsunami Benefit Concert in Bristol. Around that time, Barrow revealed that the band was in the process of writing its third album. In August 2006, the band posted two new tracks on its MySpace page (called &quot;Key Bored 299 03&quot; and &quot;Greek Jam&quot;), described by Barrow as &quot;doodles&quot;. Around the same time, Portishead covered Serge Gainsbourg&#x27;s &quot;Un Jour Comme un Autre (Requiem for Anna)&quot; on the tribute album &quot;Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited&quot;.

On 2 October 2007, Portishead stated that the new album &quot;Third&quot; had been mixed and was nearly complete, and was due for release in early April 2008. The release was later pushed to 28 April. On 8 and 9 December 2007, the band curated the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in Minehead, England. The festival featured their first full live sets in nearly 10 years. They premiered five tracks from the new album: &quot;Silence&quot;, &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;The Rip&quot;, &quot;We Carry On&quot;, and &quot;Machine Gun&quot;. On 21 January 2008, a European tour to support the album was announced, together with a headline spot at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on 26 April 2008, their only U.S. date on the tour.

&quot;Third&quot; was made available on Last.fm the week before release, attracting 327,000 listeners in just under 24 hours. It was the first time Last.fm had made an album available before its official release date. The album was released on 29 April 2008 to coincide with the band&#x27;s appearance at Coachella. On 18 May 2008, Barrow expressed Portishead&#x27;s enthusiasm for recording new material on their website&#x27;s blog, stating that he &quot;can&#x27;t wait to write some new tunes&quot;.

=== Later work (2009–present) ===
On 28 September 2009, Barrow announced &quot;big plans&quot; for a new project with a new angle, hinting that an album could arrive as soon as late 2010. Whilst the album had yet to materialise, on 9 December 2009, the band released the song &quot;Chase the Tear&quot; for Human Rights Day to raise money for Amnesty International UK. Additionally, on 3 December 2008, Universal Music Japan reissued the albums &quot;Dummy&quot; and &quot;Portishead&quot; in limited edition on SHM-CD.

During Summer 2011, Portishead performed at a number of festivals in Europe, including, Pohoda Festival, Exit Festival, Benicàssim Festival in Spain, Rock Werchter, Paleo Festival, Roskilde Festival, the Hurricane/Southside Festivals in Germany, and the Super Bock Super Rock music festival. The band also headlined and curated the line-up for two All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties music festivals entitled &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror&quot;, in London at Alexandra Palace on 23 and 24 July. The second took place in Asbury Park, New Jersey, from 30 September – 2 October. Barrow stated that he realised a &quot;boyhood fantasy&quot; when Chuck D of Public Enemy joined the band onstage at the &quot;ATP I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror&quot; festival curated by Portishead in Asbury Park, NJ in October 2011. He contributed his verse from the Public Enemy song &quot;Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos&quot; over Portishead&#x27;s single &quot;Machine Gun&quot;. Portishead then visited several cities in North America, including New York, Montreal, Toronto, Chicago, Mexico City, Los Angeles, Berkeley, Seattle, Vancouver, and Denver during October. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; hailed the concert and noted: &quot;horror-movie accents—Gothic organ, guitar lines thick with menacing reverb, spooky theremin—ensured a certain darkness&quot;. They finished their tour with a jaunt to Australia and New Zealand. Barrow stated in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview that he would begin work on his portion of the album in January 2012, jokingly pointing out that it could be another decade before a new album is released.

In 2013, the band headlined the Other Stage at the Glastonbury Music festival and embarked on a European tour. In summer 2014, they played several concerts around Europe. 2015 saw Portishead continue to perform live, playing festivals such as fib (Benicassim, Spain), Latitude (Southwold, Suffolk, UK), and the Montreux Jazz Festival (Montreux, Switzerland). Additionally, Portishead produced a cover of ABBA&#x27;s song &quot;SOS&quot; for the soundtrack to the movie &quot;High-Rise&quot; which had a Gala screening at the London Film Festival on 9 October 2015. In 2016, the band won an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. On 22 June 2016, Portishead released a video for &quot;SOS&quot; that recontextualized the song in the wake of the then-recent murder of member of parliament Jo Cox and the Brexit vote.

On 2 May 2022, Portishead performed for the first time in seven years at O2 Academy Bristol. Organized by War Child UK, the concert benefited refugees and children affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Lead singer Beth Gibbons would also appear on rapper Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s song &quot;Mother I Sober&quot; from the album &quot;Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers&quot;, released on 13 May. In 2023, Portishead reissued &quot;Roseland NYC Live.&quot; The new tracklist includes previously omitted songs and restores other tracks which had been replaced with alternate versions on the 1998 album. Gibbons released her debut solo album, &quot;Lives Outgrown&quot;, in 2024.

==Style and influences==
Portishead&#x27;s music was influenced by a wide range of singers and composers. Gibbons&#x27;s voice has been compared to singer Billie Holiday. Utley mentioned the spaghetti western guitar composed by Ennio Morricone; he said that &quot;[Morricone&#x27;s] &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; is the sort of soundtrack that I love&quot;.

<doc id="87732" wikidata="Q6595198" url="?curid=87732" title="List of Puerto Ricans">
<text>This is a list of notable people from Puerto Rico which includes people who were born in Puerto Rico (Borinquen) and people who are of full or partial Puerto Rican descent. Puerto Rican citizens are included, as the government of Puerto Rico has been issuing &quot;Certificates of Puerto Rican Citizenship&quot; to anyone born in Puerto Rico or to anyone born outside of Puerto Rico with at least one parent who was born in Puerto Rico since 2007. Also included in the list are some long-term continental American and other residents or immigrants of other ethnic heritages who have made Puerto Rico their home and consider themselves to be Puerto Ricans.

The list is divided into categories and, in some cases, sub-categories, which best describe the field for which the subject is most noted. Some categories such as &quot;Actors, actresses, comedians and directors&quot; are relative since a subject who is a comedian may also be an actor or director. In some cases a subject may be notable in more than one field, such as Luis A. Ferré, who is notable both as a former governor and as an industrialist. However, the custom is to place the subject&#x27;s name under the category for which the subject is most noted.

<text>In Norse mythology, Þrúðgelmir (; Old Norse &quot;Strength Yeller&quot;) is a jötunn, the son of the primordial Aurgelmir (who Snorri Sturluson in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; identifies with Ymir), and the father of Bergelmir. Þrúðgelmir had one brother and one sister, who were elder than he was. Þrúðgelmir&#x27;s name is sometimes anglicized as Thrudgelmir. He may have been the born from Ymir&#x27;s legs.

==Attestations==
Þrúðgelmir appears in the poem &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot; from the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. When Odin (speaking under the assumed name Gagnrad) asks who was the eldest of the Æsir or of the in bygone days, Vafþrúðnir answers:

:&quot;Uncountable winters before the earth was made,
:then Bergelmir was born,
:Thrudgelmir was his father,
:and Aurgelmir his grandfather.&quot;
::—&quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot; 

According to Rudolf Simek, Þrúðgelmir is identical to the six-headed son that was begotten by Aurgelmir&#x27;s feet (&quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, ), but the fact that (apart from the &quot;þulur&quot;) he is mentioned in only one source led John Lindow to suggest that he might have been invented by the poet. Additionally, the identification of one with the other cannot be established with certainty since, according to stanza 33, Aurgelmir had more than one direct male offspring:

:&quot;They said that under the frost-giant&#x27;s arms
:a girl and boy grew together;
:one foot with the other, of the wise giant,
:begot a six-headed son.&quot;

Þrúðgelmir was drowned in his father&#x27;s blood.

<text>Coming Up for Air is the seventh book and fourth novel by the English writer George Orwell, published in June 1939 by Victor Gollancz. It was written between 1938 and 1939 while Orwell spent time recuperating from illness in French Morocco, mainly in Marrakesh. He delivered the completed manuscript to Victor Gollancz upon his return to London in March 1939.

The story follows George Bowling, a 45-year-old husband, father, and insurance salesman, who foresees World War II and attempts to recapture idyllic childhood innocence and escape his dreary life by returning to Lower Binfield, his birthplace. The novel is comical and pessimistic, with its views that speculative builders, commercialism, and capitalism are killing the best of rural England, and that his country is facing the sinister appearance of new, external national threats.

==Background==
As a child, Orwell lived at Shiplake and Henley in the Thames Valley. His father, Richard Walmesley Blair, was a civil servant in British India, and he lived a genteel life with his mother and two sisters, though spending much of the year at boarding school at Eastbourne and later at Eton in Britain. He particularly enjoyed fishing and shooting rabbits with a neighbouring family.

In 1937 Orwell spent some months fighting in the Spanish Civil War. He was wounded in the throat in May 1937, by a Nationalist sniper at Huesca.

Orwell was severely ill in 1938 and was advised to spend the winter in a warm climate. The novelist L. H. Myers anonymously gave £300 to enable this and Orwell went with his wife to North Africa where he stayed, in French Morocco, mainly in Marrakesh, from September 1938 to March 1939. (Orwell never learned the source of the money and he accepted it only on condition that it be considered a loan. He repaid the loan, eight years later, when he began making money from the success of &quot;Animal Farm&quot;.) Orwell wrote &quot;Coming Up for Air&quot; while he was in North Africa and left the manuscript at his agent&#x27;s office within a few hours of arriving back in England on 30 March 1939. It was submitted to Victor Gollancz, who had an option on Orwell&#x27;s next three novels, in spite of the &#x27;cold treatment which [Orwell] had been given when &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot; was rejected.&#x27; In fact Orwell heard in April 1939 that Gollancz had reservations about the book, and was delaying a decision to accept it. The descriptions in the novel of a character who lectures at a meeting of Gollancz&#x27;s Left Book Club, and of the meeting itself, were such that Gollancz &#x27;could not have helped being offended by them.&#x27; Nevertheless, the publisher did bring out the novel without demanding major changes and it was published on 12 June 1939. It was the last Orwell novel to bear the Gollancz imprint.

==Plot summary==
The book&#x27;s themes are nostalgia, the folly of trying to go back and recapture past glories, and the easy way the dreams and aspirations of one&#x27;s youth can be smothered by the humdrum routine of work, marriage, and getting old. It is written in the first person, with George Bowling, the forty-five-year-old protagonist, who reveals his life and experiences while undertaking a trip back to his boyhood home as an adult.

At the book&#x27;s opening, Bowling has a day off work to go to London to collect a new set of false teeth. A news poster about the contemporary King Zog of Albania sets off thoughts of a biblical character Og, King of Bashan, whom he recalls from Sunday church as a child. Along with &#x27;some sound in the traffic or the smell of horse dung or something,&#x27; these thoughts trigger Bowling&#x27;s memory of his childhood as the son of an unambitious seed merchant in &quot;Lower Binfield&quot; near the River Thames. Bowling relates his life history, dwelling on how a lucky break during the First World War landed him a comfortable job away from any action and provided contacts that helped him become a successful salesman.

Bowling is wondering what to do with a modest sum of money that he has won on a horserace and which he has concealed from his wife and family. Much later (part III), he and his wife attend a Left Book Club meeting where he is horrified by the hate shown by the anti-fascist speaker and bemused by the Marxist ramblings of the communists who have participated in the meeting. Fed up with this, he seeks his friend Old Porteous, the retired schoolmaster. He usually enjoys Porteous&#x27; company, but on this occasion, his dry, dead classics make Bowling even more depressed.

Bowling decides to use the money on a &#x27;trip down memory lane&#x27; to revisit the places of his childhood. He recalls a pond with giant fish, which he had missed the chance to try and catch thirty years previously. He, therefore, plans to return to Lower Binfield, but when he arrives, he finds the place unrecognizable. Eventually, he locates the old pub where he is to stay, finding it much changed. His home has become a tea shop. Only the church and vicar appear the same, but he is shocked when he discovers an old girlfriend, for she has been so ravaged by the time that she is almost unrecognizable and utterly devoid of the qualities he once had adored. She fails to recognize him at all. Bowling remembers the slow and painful decline of his father&#x27;s seed business – resulting from the nearby establishment of corporate competition. This painful memory seems to have sensitized him to – and given him a repugnance for – what he sees as the marching ravages of &quot;Progress.&quot; The final disappointment is that the estate where he used to fish has been built over, and the secluded and once-hidden pond that contained the huge carp he constantly intended to take on with his fishing rod but never got around to has become a rubbish dump. The social and material changes experienced by Bowling since childhood make his past seem distant. The concept of &quot;you can&#x27;t go home again&quot; hangs heavily over Bowling&#x27;s journey as he realizes that many of his old haunts are gone or considerably changed from his younger years.

Throughout the adventure, he receives reminders of impending war, and the threat of bombs becomes real when one lands accidentally on the town.

==Characters==
* George Bowling is a fat, married, middle-aged (45 years old) insurance salesman, with &#x27;two kids and a house in the suburbs&#x27;.
Orwell&#x27;s brother-in-law, Humphry Dakin, the husband of Orwell&#x27;s elder sister Marjorie, a &#x27;short, stout, loquacious&#x27; man, thought that Bowling might be a portrait of him. He had known Blair (Orwell) since they were youngsters, when the Blairs lived at Henley-on-Thames and later when they lived at Southwold where he married Marjorie.
* Joe Bowling is George&#x27;s elder brother. He was not intellectual, and, according to George &#x27;therefore he had a slight proficiency in mechanics&#x27;. He never did any sizeable amount of work and worked for his dad as an &#x27;errand boy&#x27;. One day when George was younger, Joe stole all the money from the shop till. He was said to have always wanted to emigrate to America, and was never mentioned again.
* Uncle Ezekiel is a shop owner with quite liberal beliefs, being a &#x27;little Englander&#x27;. He kept an assortment of caged birds inside his shop as decoration.
* Hilda Bowling, his wife, belongs to the poverty-stricken officer class of an Anglo-Indian family who after marriage has settled-down into a depressed lifeless middle-aged frump. 39 years old, &#x27;very thin and rather wizened, with a perpetual brooding, worried look in her eyes.&#x27;
* Old Porteous, a retired public-school master whose whole life has been lived in an atmosphere of Latin, Greek, and cricket.
* Elsie, George&#x27;s ex-partner; they met in the vicar&#x27;s reading circle, and she was said to be &#x27;deeply feminine&#x27;. They stayed together &#x27;living in sin&#x27; until George enlisted. Shortly afterwards he loses contact with her. Upon his 1939 return to Lower Binfield, George sees her and remarks that &#x27;the milky white skin was gone...&#x27; and that she was now a cylinder with lumps sticking out. She also now speaks with a strong cockney accent and married a shop owner, also named George.

==Style==
In their 1972 study of Orwell, &quot;The Unknown Orwell&quot;, the writers Peter Stansky and William Abrahams described the novel as &quot;Wellsian&quot;. Whilst at his prep school in Sussex (1911–1916), Wells had been a favourite author of Eric Blair/Orwell. As with other writers he had read while at St Cyprian&#x27;s Prep school, – Kipling, Wodehouse, Swift, Shaw, Thackeray – his loyalty was virtually unwavering. What he valued in Wells was not the later polemicist, but the novelist whose evocation of certain aspects of life in England before World War I recalled to Orwell comparable experiences of his own. He and Connolly would leave the school grounds and set out across the Downs to Beachy Head, or far along the plunging leafy roads that led deep into the Sussex countryside, to villages that might have figured in a Wells novel: Eastdean and Westdean and Jevington. They would pause in each, and buy penny sweets and various fizzy drinks. This was the plain, decent, bread-and-sunlit world that Orwell recalled so nostalgically the further it retreated from him; eventually he would write [a] Wellsian [novel of this kind], in &quot;Coming Up For Air.&quot;&quot;

The writer Michael Levenson remarked upon the influence at this period in Orwell&#x27;s life, of Henry Miller, and Miller&#x27;s attitude to what was happening in the world. Miller sees what is happening, but is &quot;Inside the Whale&quot;, he &quot;feels no impulse to alter or control the process that he is undergoing. He has performed the essential Jonah act of allowing himself to be swallowed, remaining passive, &quot;accepting&quot; – even when this means accepting &quot;concentration camps, rubber truncheons, Hitler, Stalin, bombs, aeroplanes.&quot; &quot;George Bowling is Orwell&#x27;s Jonah, and &quot;Coming Up For Air&quot; is in significant respects a contribution to the &#x27;school of Miller&#x27;. Hemmed in on every side ̶ by job, home, history – Bowling neither comprehends the political world nor tries to change it. He merely wants to rediscover the grounds of happiness. In its central movement, &quot;Coming Up For Air&quot; is an unembarrassedly affirmative recovery of early-century innocence:boyhood, family life and country rambling in the town of Lower Binfield. Fishing in &quot;Coming Up For Air&quot; is what sex was in &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;. &#x27;Fishing&#x27;, as Bowling puts it, &#x27;is the opposite of war&#x27;.

==Critical responses==
The novel sold three thousand copies, a thousand of which represented a second printing and thus bettered &quot;the dismal response in the bookshops which had met the publication of &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;.&quot; The reviews were among the best that Orwell had received for a novel. Margery Allingham, in &quot;Time and Tide&quot;, wrote that her only regret &quot;is that the story was written in the first person. This device, although it has the important virtue of making the narrative clear and easy to read, tends to falsify the character slightly since [Bowling&#x27;s] uncanny perception where his own feelings are concerned makes him a little less of the ordinary mortal which his behaviour would show him to be.&quot; A recent biographer, Michael Shelden, praised the &quot;many passages of lyrical beauty, not unbecoming a novelist who once aspired to be a poet. The one serious defect in the novel is Orwell&#x27;s attempt to &quot;be&quot; the voice of his narrator-protagonist. He does not make a convincing middle-aged, overweight, suburban-dwelling, low-brow insurance salesman, and the book is at its best when Orwell is &#x27;out-of-character&#x27;, speaking in a voice which is recognisably his rather than an imitation of &#x27;Fatty&#x27; Bowling&#x27;s.&quot;

The writers Peter Stansky and William Abrahams, in their 1972 &quot;The Unknown Orwell&quot;, noted: &quot;Eric Blair looked back unforgivingly on the world before 1914 – it was that world that had sent him to his prep school – while George Orwell could believe it was superior to what came after it, and looked back to it nostalgically in &quot;Coming Up for Air&quot;.&quot; The writer John Wain thought the book was &quot;not a success in novelistic terms&quot;, but saw &quot;vitality in its hinterland.&quot; He considered the novel &quot;a bleaker work than &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot;; in &quot;Aspidistra&quot; everybody fears the sack, hankers for more money and security, cringes to the boss. But only to the boss at work, the economic boss. When Bowling thinks of the future, he fears not only the ever-present financial insecurity, the endless work, work, work with the gutter only a few steps away; he fears also the new breed of tyrants, the leader and his strong-arm boys.&quot; And Wain noted the third region of Bowling&#x27;s nightmare – &quot;what we have since learnt to call &#x27;the environment&#x27;.&quot; He places &quot;Coming Up For Air&quot; alongside Orwell&#x27;s 1946 essay &quot;Some Thoughts on the Common Toad&quot; where he had written that, &quot;retaining one&#x27;s childhood love of such things as trees, fishes, butterflies and – toads, one makes a peaceful and decent future a little more probable&quot;. &quot;What makes &quot;Coming Up For Air&quot; so peculiarly bitter to the taste is that, in addition to calling up the twin spectres of totalitarianism and workless poverty, it also declares the impossibility of &#x27;retaining one&#x27;s childhood love of such things as trees, fishes, butterflies&#x27; – because it postulates a world in which these things are simply not there any more.&quot;

<text>Bergelmir ( ; Old Norse: ) is a jötunn in Norse mythology.

== Name ==
The Old Norse name &quot;Bergelmir&quot; has been variously translated as &#x27;bear-yeller&#x27;, &#x27;mountain-yeller&#x27;, or &#x27;bare-yeller&#x27;. According to linguist Jan de Vries, the name should be read as &quot;ber-gelmir&quot; (&#x27;who roars like a bear&#x27;) rather than &quot;berg-gelmir&quot; (&#x27;who roars in the mountains&#x27;).

== Attestations ==
In &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot; (The Lay of Vafþrúðnir), Bergelmir is portrayed as the son of Þrúðgelmir and the grandson of the first Aurgelmir (Ymir). When Odin asks Vafthrúdnir who is the oldest among the æsir and the jötnar, the wise responds that:

In the same poem, Odin then asks Vafthrúdnir about the monstrous birth of the offspring of Aurgelmir, and Vafthrúdnir responds:
In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; (The Beguiling of Gylfi), while the blood of Ymir (Aurgelmir) is flooding the earth after the sons of Borr (Odin, Vili, and Vé) have killed him, Bergelmir is likewise pictured as escaping on a &quot;lúðr&quot; with his wife to re-found the frost- race.

Based upon Snorri&#x27;s account, the Old Norse word &quot;lúðr&quot; might have referred to a &#x27;coffin&#x27;, a &#x27;cradle&#x27;, a &#x27;chest&#x27;, or some wooden part of a mill.

==Theories==
Robert D. Fulk notes that Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot; account &quot;conflicts with the poetic version, as the [&quot;Prose Edda&quot;] presents a Noah-like figure, while the latter has Bergelmir laid (&quot;lagiðr&quot;) in the &quot;lúðr&quot;, implying he is an infant, as in the Scyld story. But Snorri does add the crucial element not made in the explicit verses, that the &quot;lúðr&quot; is to serve as a floating vessel.&quot;

Fulk continues that &quot;the key word here is &quot;lúðr&quot;, which ought to refer to a flour-bin. To be precise, the object is a box or wooden trough, perhaps on legs, in which the stones of a hand-mill sit [...]. It is true that most glossators assume some meaning other than &#x27;flour-bin&#x27; in &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot; and &quot;Snorra edda&quot; [an alternate name for the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;], suggesting instead something in the range of &#x27;coffin (or cradle), chest, ark (i.e. boat)&#x27;.&quot; Fulk details that &quot;the interpretation of &#x27;ark&#x27; derives solely from the passage in &quot;Snorra Edda&quot;, because of Bergelmir&#x27;s resemblance to Noah, and the fact that [Old Icelandic] &quot;ǫrk&quot; [...] can refer to both Noah&#x27;s ark and a chest or a sarcophagus.&quot;

<text>The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon (also called the Korthals Griffon and the Griffon d&#x27;arrêt à poil dur Korthals in France and Quebec) is a breed of dog used in hunting as a gundog. It is sometimes considered to be Dutch in ancestry, due to the nationality of the breed founder, Eduard Karel Korthals. History records the progression of the development of the breed through Biebesheim am Rhein, Germany where the founder established the Ipenwoud kennel and the breed type was established and then into France where it is now recognized. Others consider the Griffon to be a German breed because Korthals&#x27; kennel, Ipenwoud, was located in Biebesheim am Rhein, Germany. It was there for over twenty years that Korthals dedicated his life to the development and perfection of the Korthals Griffon.

The breed is still relatively rare in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom despite long recognition by their respective national kennel clubs, as well as the FCI (Federation Cynologique Internationale). The Korthals Griffon is particularly adapted for hunting in thick undergrowth and around water, where its harsh coat is excellent protection. The griffon is used primarily as a hunting dog for upland game birds as well as waterfowl.

== Appearance ==
The Korthals Griffon is a strong medium-sized dog (20-22&quot; for females, 22-24&quot; for males) and 35-50 pounds for females and 50-70 pounds for males with a harsh, wiry outer coat and a softer under coat. The coat is preferably steel gray with brown markings. Other acceptable colors: chestnut brown, white and brown, roan, and white and orange. All brown, all white or white and orange are less desirable. A black coat disqualifies. 
The griffon has a large and long head, with large rounded eyes covered with eyebrows and complemented with a beard. The nose is always brown. The neck is long and body well proportioned and muscular. Depending on the country, the tail may be docked.

== Health and temperament ==
Korthals Griffons are known as intelligent with softer temperaments but with a willingness to please. They do not adapt well to harsh training methods. Most Griffons do not take well to living their lives in kennels. Regular exercise and training is highly recommended. They are extremely people oriented and prefer to be somewhere in the vicinity of their owners. The breed organizations recommend purchasing from breeders providing health clearances on written contracts on their guarantees. Recent research had discovered the infusion of another breed into the Griffon worldwide. This has caused a split in most countries between those individuals wishing to retain the genuine Korthals Griffon with the clubs recognizing all breedings including the outcross hybrids.

== Shedding ==
Contrary to some publications, the Griffon is &quot;not&quot; non-shedding. However, it does shed considerably less than many other breeds. All dogs shed, and it is the dog&#x27;s dander and saliva that trigger most allergic reactions. Allergists do recognize that at times a particular allergy patient will be able to tolerate a particular dog (and many Griff owners consider these dogs hypoallergenic), but it may be that &quot;the luck of the few with their pets cannot be stretched to fit all allergic people and entire breeds of dogs.&quot; Allergists &quot;think there really are differences in protein production between dogs that may help one patient and not another&quot;, meaning that some allergic people may not have allergic reactions to a specific dog.

== History ==

Eduard Karel Korthals is credited with the breed around 1873. Korthals&#x27; dream was to create the ideal versatile gun dog; one with extreme resiliency, vigor, and devotion to its master. The dog would also have to work close to its master, and be open to training.
Korthals&#x27; breeding line began in 1874 with &quot;Mouche&quot;, who would be used as its foundation bitch, as well as five other dogs described as &quot;Griffons&quot;: Janus, Satan, Banco, Hector, and Junon. He interbred the dogs carefully until offspring were produced that resembled his idea of an ultimate hunting dog. In any event, the resulting offspring (Moustache I, Lina, and Querida) are referred to as the &quot;Korthals Patriarchs&quot; because they are the Griffon&#x27;s direct ancestors. In 1888 the first &quot;griffon club&quot; was formed as an international organization with local clubs in Bavaria &quot;Southern German Griffon Clue&quot; in 1895, in Belgium the &quot;Royal Belgium Griffon Club&quot; (1895) in France &quot;French Wirehaired Griffon Club (1901) soon followed.

The American Kennel Club&#x27;s first registered Korthals Griffons (called Wirehaired Pointing Griffon in the USA) was &quot;Zolette&quot;, who was entered into the stud book in 1887. However, the Griffon was still relatively unknown, and she was registered as a &quot;Russian Setter (Griffon)&quot; for her presumed Russian heritage. It was not until 1916, twenty-nine years later, that the breed was officially recognized as the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon in the United States. In that same year, sixteen Griffons appeared in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, one of the most prestigious shows in the country. Since then, the breed has grown in popularity as not only a show dog but also a versatile gun dog, Korthals&#x27; original intention for the breed. For the most part, the breed still resembles his original intentions: a medium size, harsh coat, good degree of trainability, and resilient on the field and in the ring.

<text>His Majesty&#x27;s Government of the Virgin Islands (usually simply referred to as the Government of the Virgin Islands) is the democratically elected government of the British Overseas Territory of the British Virgin Islands. It is regulated by the Constitution of the British Virgin Islands.

The Government is led by the Premier, who selects all the remaining Ministers of Government. The Premier and the other Ministers belong to the supreme decision-making committee, known as the Cabinet. The Government Ministers are all members of House of Assembly, and are accountable to it. The Government is dependent upon the House to make primary legislation. King Charles III (represented by a Governor of the British Virgin Islands) is the head of state. The monarch (acting through the Governor) selects as Premier the leader of the political party most likely to command a majority in the House of Assembly.

Elections in the British Virgin Islands are held approximately every four years, with a unicameral House of Assembly of 13 members (11 members elected by popular vote, plus the Speaker appointed by the House and the Attorney General).

The current Premier is Natalio Wheatley who is a member of the ruling Virgin Islands Party, and the current Governor is John Rankin.

==Executive Government==

Although ultimate executive authority rests with the British monarch exercising his powers through the Governor, the Territory is internally self-governing, and in practice Ministerial Government is exercised on a day-to-day basis by the Premier through Cabinet (although the Governor also sits in Cabinet). The British Virgin Islands operates under the Westminster system, and the Ministers and Cabinet are appointed from amongst the members of the Legislature and are not independently elected to executive office.

The principal Ministries of Government are:
* Minister of Finance and Tourism (presently the Premier, Andrew Fahie)
* Minister for Natural Resources, Labour &amp; Immigration (presently the Deputy Premier, Vincent Wheatley)
* Minister for Education, Culture, Agriculture, Fisheries, Sports &amp; Youth Affairs (presently Hon. Natalio Wheatley)
* Minister for Transportation, Works &amp; Utilities (presently Hon. Kye Rymer)
* Minister for Health and Social Development (presently Hon. Carvin Malone)

===External relations===

As a British Overseas Territory, the majority of the external relationships of the British Virgin Islands Government are conducted on its behalf by the United Kingdom through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. However the Constitution provides that this power is delegated to Premier and Ministers of Government in relation to certain specific areas:
# the Caribbean Community, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, the Association of Caribbean States, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, or any other Caribbean regional organisation or institution;
# other Caribbean regional affairs relating specifically to issues that are of interest to or affect the British Virgin Islands;
# the relationship between the British Virgin Islands and the United States Virgin Islands in matters of mutual interest;
# tourism and tourism-related matters;
# taxation and the regulation of finance and financial services; and
# European Union matters directly affecting the interests of the Territory.

However, there are a number of restrictions imposed by the Constitution upon the exercise by Ministers of that delegated power, including the need for separate authority from the Secretary of State to conclude any treaty or other international agreement, and the requirement to keep the Governor &quot;fully informed&quot; of relevant activities and to provide on request all papers and information relating to such matters.

In turn the British Government has indicated in a letter of entrustment that will consult fully with the British Virgin Islands in relation to matters which are reserved to the United Kingdom Government, including defence, internal security and civil aviation.

===Public Finances===
Public finances are administered through the Ministry of Finance. In the British Virgin Islands it is common for the Premier to also be the Minister for Finance. Public finance is regulation by the Public Finance Management Act, 2004.

On 23 April 2012 the Government of the British Virgin Islands signed protocols for effective financial management with the Governor and the British Minister for the Overseas Territories. The protocols contain a number of wide-ranging provisions agreeing on certain parameters for financial and risk management, making commitments to financial transparency, and includes various limitations on the Government of the British Virgin Islands in relation to borrowing.

The protocols provide that all capital projects undertaken by the Government shall comply with applicable protocols for: (i) appraisal of business case and cost-benefit analysis, (ii) transparency for tendering and procurement, (iii) contract management, and (iv) evaluation process.

The protocols also include certain hard limits in relation to Governmental borrowing. Under the protocols:
# outstanding public debt must remain less than 80% of recurrent revenue;
# debt service (i.e. interest payments) must remain less than 10% of recurrent revenue; and
# liquid assets must be retained in an amount of not less than 25% of recurrent expenditure.

As at 2014 public debt in the British Virgin Islands is approximately US$111 million, which is approximately 36.6% of recurrent revenues. In recent years problems have arisen because of repeated unbudgeted expenditure by Ministerial departments; the problem became sufficiently acute that in 2016 the Territory&#x27;s Financial Secretary wrote an open letter to all Ministers warning them against such practices.

==Legislature==
The British Virgin Islands legislature is the House of Assembly. Prior to the adoption of the new constitution in 2007 the legislature was called the Legislative Council. General elections are conducted every four years (unless the House is dissolved earlier, either as a result of a vote of no confidence or otherwise).

The House consists of 11 elected two members, and two appointed &quot;ex-officio&quot; non-voting members (the Speaker and the Attorney General). The 11 elected members consist of 9 candidates who are elected to represent Territorial districts, and 4 candidates who are elected on a Territory-wide basis. Government is formed by the leader of the party who can most readily command a majority in the House. Although in recent times parties have tended to win absolute majorities, during the early days of democratic elections in the British Virgin Islands, coalition governments were commonly formed between parties and independent candidates. Politicians in the British Virgin Islands also frequently cross the floor to change parties in order to create absolute majorities.

==Judiciary==
The judiciary of British Virgin Islands is based on the judiciary of the United Kingdom. The Territory is a member state of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court. Judges in the British Virgin Islands are appointed by the Judicial and Legal Services Commission of the Supreme Court rather than elected. By convention judges are always appointed to sit outside of the member state where they are originally from.

The courts are organised at four levels, including the provision for final appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London. The four levels of courts are:
* Magistrates Court (dealing with summary criminal matters and minor civil matters)
* High Court (dealing with criminal trials on indictment and with unlimited jurisdiction in civil matters)
* Court of Appeal 
* Privy Council

The British Virgin Islands is a common law jurisdiction, although British Virgin Islands law and procedure differs to a great degree from English law because of local statutes, orders and civil procedure rules. However, in certain instances British Virgin Islands law provides that in default of any local provision, English law or procedure shall apply.

Beyla is mentioned in stanzas 55, 66, and the prose introduction to the Poetic Edda poem &quot;Lokasenna&quot;. Since this is the only mention of Beyla, scholars have turned to the etymology of Beyla&#x27;s name for additional information about her. However, the meaning of her name is unclear and her name has been proposed as related to &quot;cow,&quot; &quot;bean,&quot; or &quot;bee.&quot;

==&quot;Lokasenna&quot;==
In the prose introduction to &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, Beyla and Byggvir are cited as attending In stanza 55 of &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, after his verses with Sif, Loki accuses Beyla of being filthy but the reason for this is unclear.

<doc id="87770" wikidata="Q148643" url="?curid=87770" title="Oedipus Rex">
<text>Oedipus Rex, also known by its Greek title, Oedipus Tyrannus (, ), or Oedipus the King, is an Athenian tragedy by Sophocles. While some scholars have argued that the play was first performed , this is highly uncertain. Originally, to the ancient Greeks, the title was simply &quot;Oedipus&quot; (), as it is referred to by Aristotle in the &quot;Poetics&quot;. It is thought to have been renamed &quot;Oedipus Tyrannus&quot; to distinguish it from &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;, a later play by Sophocles. In antiquity, the term &quot;tyrant&quot; referred to a ruler with no legitimate claim to rule, but it did not necessarily have a negative connotation.

Of Sophocles&#x27; three Theban plays that have survived, and that deal with the story of Oedipus, &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; was the second to be written, following &quot;Antigone&quot; by about a dozen years. However, in terms of the chronology of events described by the plays, it comes first, followed by &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot; and then &quot;Antigone&quot;.

Prior to the start of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, Oedipus has become the king of Thebes while unwittingly fulfilling a prophecy that he would kill his father, Laius (the previous king), and marry his mother, Jocasta (whom Oedipus took as his queen after solving the riddle of the Sphinx). The action of Sophocles&#x27;s play concerns Oedipus&#x27;s search for the murderer of Laius in order to end a plague ravaging Thebes, unaware that the killer he is looking for is none other than himself. At the end of the play, after the truth finally comes to light, Jocasta hangs herself while Oedipus, horrified at his patricide and incest, proceeds to gouge out his own eyes in despair.

In his &quot;Poetics&quot;, Aristotle refers several times to the play in order to exemplify aspects of the genre.

==Context==
===Curse upon Laius===
The misfortunes of Thebes are believed to be the result of a curse laid upon Laius for the time he had violated the sacred laws of hospitality (Greek: &quot;xenia&quot;).

In his youth, Laius was taken in as a guest by Pelops, king of Elis, where he would become tutor to the king&#x27;s youngest son, Chrysippus, in chariot racing.
Apollo, the protector of youth and boys, cursed him for kidnapping and raping Chrysippus.

=== Birth of Oedipus ===
When Laius&#x27; son is born, he consults an oracle as to his fortune. To his horror, the oracle reveals that Laius &quot;is doomed to perish by the hand of his own son.&quot; Laius binds the infant&#x27;s feet together with a pin and orders Jocasta to kill him. Unable to do so to her own son, Jocasta orders a servant to expose the infant on a mountaintop. The servant, moved by pity, gives the child to a shepherd, who unbinds the infant&#x27;s ankles, and names him Oedipus, &quot;swollen foot&quot;. The shepherd brings the infant to Corinth, and presents him to the childless king Polybus, who raises Oedipus as his own son.

===Oedipus and the Oracle===
As he grows to manhood, Oedipus hears a rumour that he is not truly the son of Polybus and his wife, Merope. He asks the Delphic Oracle who his parents really are. The Oracle seems to ignore this question, telling him instead that he is destined to &quot;mate with [his] own mother, and shed/With [his] own hands the blood of [his] own sire.&quot; Desperate to avoid this terrible fate, Oedipus, who still believes that Polybus and Merope are his true parents, leaves Corinth for the city of Thebes.

===Fulfilling prophecy===
====The old man====
On the road to Thebes, Oedipus encounters an old man and his servants. The two begin to quarrel over whose chariot has the right of way. While the old man moves to strike the insolent youth with his scepter, Oedipus throws the man down from his chariot, killing him. Thus, the prophecy in which Oedipus slays his own father is fulfilled, as the old man—as Oedipus discovers later—was Laius, king of Thebes and true father to Oedipus.

====Riddle of the Sphinx====
Arriving at Thebes, a city in turmoil, Oedipus encounters the Sphinx, a legendary beast with the head and breasts of a woman, the body of a lioness, and the wings of an eagle. The Sphinx, perched on a hill, was devouring Thebans and travelers one by one if they could not solve her riddle.

The precise riddle asked by the Sphinx varied in early traditions, and is not explicitly stated in &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, as the event precedes the play. However, according to the most widely regarded version of the riddle, the Sphinx asks &quot;what is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three in the evening?&quot; Oedipus, blessed with great intelligence, answers correctly: &quot;man&quot; (Greek: ), who crawls on all fours as an infant; walks upright in maturity; and leans on a stick in old age.

Bested by the prince, the Sphinx throws herself from a cliff, thereby ending the curse. Oedipus&#x27; reward for freeing Thebes from the Sphinx is kingship to the city and the hand of its dowager queen, Jocasta. None, at that point, realize that Jocasta is Oedipus&#x27; true mother. Thus, unbeknownst to either character, the remaining prophecy has been fulfilled.

==Plot==
Oedipus, King of Thebes, sends his brother-in-law, Creon, to ask the advice of the oracle at Delphi, concerning a plague ravaging Thebes. Creon returns to report that the plague is the result of religious pollution, since the murderer of their former king, Laius, has never been caught. Oedipus vows to find the murderer and curses him for causing the plague.

Oedipus summons the blind prophet Tiresias for help. Tiresias admits to knowing the answers to Oedipus&#x27; questions, but he refuses to speak, instead telling Oedipus to abandon his search. Angered by the seer&#x27;s reply, Oedipus accuses him of complicity in Laius&#x27; murder. The offended Tiresias then reveals to the king that &quot;you yourself are the criminal you seek&quot;. Oedipus does not understand how this could be, and supposes that Creon must have paid Tiresias to accuse him. The two argue vehemently, as Oedipus mocks Tiresias&#x27; lack of sight, and Tiresias retorts that Oedipus himself is blind. Eventually, the prophet leaves, muttering darkly that when the murderer is discovered, he shall be a native of Thebes, brother and father to his own children, and son and husband to his own mother.

Creon arrives to face Oedipus&#x27;s accusations. The King demands that Creon be executed; however, the chorus persuades him to let Creon live. Jocasta, wife of first Laius and then Oedipus, enters and attempts to comfort Oedipus, telling him he should take no notice of prophets. As proof, she recounts an incident in which she and Laius received an oracle which never came true. The prophecy stated that Laius would be killed by his own son; instead, Laius was killed by bandits, at a fork in the road (τριπλαῖς ἁμαξιτοῖς, triplais amaxitois).

The mention of the place causes Oedipus to pause and ask for more details. Jocasta specifies the branch to Daulis on the way to Delphi. Recalling Tiresias&#x27; words, he asks Jocasta to describe Laius. The king then sends for a shepherd, the only surviving witness of the attack to be brought from his fields to the palace.
Confused, Jocasta asks Oedipus what the matter is, and he tells her. Many years ago, at a banquet in Corinth, a man drunkenly accused Oedipus of not being his father&#x27;s son. Oedipus went to Delphi and asked the oracle about his parentage. Instead of answering his question directly, the oracle prophesied that he would one day murder his father and sleep with his mother. Upon hearing this, Oedipus resolved never to return to Corinth. In his travels, he came to the very crossroads where Laius had been killed, and encountered a carriage that attempted to drive him off the road. An argument ensued, and Oedipus killed the travelers—including a man who matched Jocasta&#x27;s description of Laius. However, Oedipus holds out hope that he was not Laius&#x27; killer, because Laius was said to have been murdered by &quot;several&quot; robbers. If the shepherd confirms that Laius was attacked by many men, then Oedipus will be in the clear.

A man arrives from Corinth with the message that Polybus, who raised Oedipus as his son, has died. To the surprise of the messenger, Oedipus is overjoyed, because he can no longer kill his father, thus disproving half of the oracle&#x27;s prophecy. However, he still fears that he might somehow commit incest with his mother. Eager to set the king&#x27;s mind at ease, the messenger tells him not to worry, because Merope is not his real mother.

The messenger explains that years earlier, while tending his flock on Mount Cithaeron, a shepherd from the household of Laius brought him an infant that he was instructed to dispose of. The messenger had then given the child to Polybus, who raised him. Oedipus asks the chorus if anyone knows the identity of the other shepherd, or where he might be now. They respond that he is the same shepherd who witnessed the murder of Laius, and whom Oedipus had already sent for. Jocasta, realizing the truth, desperately begs Oedipus to stop asking questions. When Oedipus refuses, the queen runs into the palace.

When the shepherd arrives, Oedipus questions him, but he begs to be allowed to leave without answering further. However, Oedipus presses him, finally threatening him with torture or execution. It emerges that the child he gave away was Laius&#x27; own son. In fear of a prophecy that the child would kill his father, Jocasta gave her son to the shepherd in order to be exposed upon the mountainside.

Everything is at last revealed, and Oedipus curses himself and fate before leaving the stage. The chorus laments how even a great man can be felled by fate, and following this, a servant exits the palace to speak of what has happened inside. Jocasta has hanged herself in her bedchamber. Entering the palace in anguish, Oedipus called on his servants to bring him a sword, that he might slay Jocasta with his own hand. But upon discovering the lifeless queen, Oedipus took her down, and removing the long gold pins from her dress, he gouged out his own eyes in despair.
The blinded king now exits the palace, and begs to be exiled. Creon enters, saying that Oedipus shall be taken into the house until oracles can be consulted regarding what is best to be done. Oedipus&#x27;s two daughters (and half-sisters), Antigone and Ismene, are sent out and Oedipus laments their having been born to such a cursed family. He begs Creon to watch over them, in hopes that they will live where there is opportunity for them, and to have a better life than their father. Creon agrees, before sending Oedipus back into the palace.

On an empty stage, the chorus repeats the common Greek maxim that &quot;no man should be considered fortunate until he is dead.&quot;

==Relationship with mythic tradition==
The two cities of Troy and Thebes were the major focus of Greek epic poetry. The events surrounding the Trojan War were chronicled in the Epic Cycle, of which much remains, and those about Thebes in the Theban Cycle, which have been lost. The Theban Cycle recounted the sequence of tragedies that befell the house of Laius, of which the story of Oedipus is a part.

Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; (XI.271ff.) contains the earliest account of the Oedipus myth when Odysseus encounters Jocasta (named Epicaste) in the underworld. Homer briefly summarises the story of Oedipus, including the incest, patricide, and Jocasta&#x27;s subsequent suicide. However, in the Homeric version, Oedipus remains King of Thebes after the revelation and neither blinds himself, nor is sent into exile. In particular, it is said that the gods made the matter of his paternity known, whilst in &quot;Oedipus the King&quot;, Oedipus very much discovers the truth himself.

In 467 BC, Sophocles&#x27;s fellow tragedian Aeschylus won first prize at the City Dionysia with a trilogy about the House of Laius, comprising &quot;Laius&quot;, &quot;Oedipus&quot; and &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot; (the only play which survives). Since he did not write connected trilogies as Aeschylus did, &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; focuses on the titular character while hinting at the larger myth obliquely, which was already known to the audience in Athens at the time.

==Reception==

The trilogy containing &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; took second prize in the City Dionysia at its original performance. Aeschylus&#x27;s nephew Philocles took first prize at that competition. However, in his &quot;Poetics&quot;, Aristotle considered &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; to be the tragedy which best matched his prescription for how drama should be made.

Many modern critics agree with Aristotle on the quality of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, even if they don&#x27;t always agree on the reasons. For example, Richard Claverhouse Jebb claimed that &quot;The &quot;Oedipus Tyrannus&quot; is in one sense the masterpiece of Attic tragedy. No other shows an equal degree of art in the development of the plot; and this excellence depends on the powerful and subtle drawing of the characters.&quot; Cedric Whitman noted that &quot;the &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; passes almost universally for the greatest extant Greek play...&quot; Whitman himself regarded the play as &quot;the fullest expression of this conception of tragedy,&quot; that is the conception of tragedy as a &quot;revelation of the evil lot of man,&quot; where a man may have &quot;all the equipment for glory and honor&quot; but still have &quot;the greatest effort to do good&quot; end in &quot;the evil of an unbearable self for which one is not responsible.&quot; Edith Hall referred to &quot;Oedipus the King&quot; as &quot;this definitive tragedy&quot; and notes that &quot;the magisterial subtlety of Sophocles&#x27; characterization thus lend credibility to the breathtaking coincidences,&quot; and notes the irony that &quot;Oedipus can only fulfill his exceptional god-ordained destiny because Oedipus is a preeminently capable and intelligent human being.&quot; H. D. F. Kitto said about &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; that &quot;it is true to say that the perfection of its form implies a world order,&quot; although Kitto notes that whether or not that world order &quot;is beneficent, Sophocles does not say.&quot;

The science revolution attributed to Thales began gaining political force, and this play offered a warning to the new thinkers. Kitto interprets the play as Sophocles&#x27; retort to the sophists, by dramatizing a situation in which humans face undeserved suffering through no fault of their own, but despite the apparent randomness of the events, the fact that they have been prophesied by the gods implies that the events are not random, despite the reasons being beyond human comprehension. Through the play, according to Kitto, Sophocles declares &quot;that it is wrong, in the face of the incomprehensible and unmoral, to deny the moral laws and accept chaos. What is right is to recognize facts and not delude ourselves. The universe is a unity; if, sometimes, we can see neither rhyme nor reason in it we should not suppose it is random. There is so much that we cannot know and cannot control that we should not think and behave as if we do know and can control.&quot;

&quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; is widely regarded as one of the greatest plays, stories, and tragedies ever written. In 2015, when &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s theatre critic Michael Billington, selected what he thinks are the 101 greatest plays ever written, &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; was placed second, just after &quot;The Persians&quot;.

==Themes, irony and motifs==
===Fate, free will, or tragic flaw===

Fate is a motif that often occurs in Greek writing, tragedies in particular. Likewise, where the attempt to avoid an oracle is the very thing that enables it to happen is common to many Greek myths. For example, similarities to Oedipus can be seen in the myth of Perseus&#x27; birth.

Two oracles in particular dominate the plot of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;. Jocasta relates the prophecy that was told to Laius before the birth of Oedipus (lines 711–4):

The oracle told to Laius tells only of the patricide, whereas the incest is missing. Prompted by Jocasta&#x27;s recollection, Oedipus reveals the prophecy which caused him to leave Corinth (lines 791–3):

The implication of Laius&#x27;s oracle is ambiguous. One interpretation considers that the presentation of Laius&#x27;s oracle in this play differs from that found in Aeschylus&#x27;s Oedipus trilogy produced in 467 BC. Smith (2005) argues that &quot;Sophocles had the option of making the oracle to Laius conditional (&quot;if&quot; Laius has a son, that son will kill him) or unconditional (Laius &quot;will&quot; have a son who will kill him). Both Aeschylus and Euripides write plays in which the oracle is conditional; Sophocles...chooses to make Laius&#x27;s oracle unconditional and thus removes culpability for his sins from Oedipus, for he could not have done other than what he did, no matter what action he took.&quot;

This interpretation is supported by Jocasta&#x27;s repetition of the oracle at lines 854–55: &quot;Loxias declared that the king should be killed by/ his own son.&quot; In Greek, Jocasta uses the verb &quot;chrênai&quot;: &quot;to be fated, necessary.&quot; This iteration of the oracle seems to suggest that it was unconditional and inevitable.

Other scholars have nonetheless argued that Sophocles follows tradition in making Laius&#x27;s oracle conditional, and thus avoidable. They point to Jocasta&#x27;s initial disclosure of the oracle at lines 711–14. In Greek, the oracle cautions: &quot;&quot; The two verbs in boldface indicate what is called a &quot;future more vivid&quot; condition: &quot;if&quot; a child is born to Laius, his fate to be killed by that child &quot;will&quot; overtake him.

Whatever the meaning of Laius&#x27;s oracle, the one delivered to Oedipus is clearly unconditional. Given the modern conception of fate and fatalism, readers of the play have a tendency to view Oedipus as a mere puppet controlled by greater forces; a man crushed by the gods and fate for no good reason. This, however, is not an entirely accurate reading. While it is a mythological truism that oracles exist to be fulfilled, oracles do not cause the events that lead up to the outcome. In his landmark essay &quot;On Misunderstanding the &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;&quot;, E.R. Dodds draws upon Bernard Knox&#x27;s comparison with Jesus&#x27; prophecy at the Last Supper that Peter would deny him three times. Jesus &quot;knows&quot; that Peter will do this, but readers would in no way suggest that Peter was a puppet of fate being &quot;forced&quot; to deny Christ. Free will and predestination are by no means mutually exclusive, and such is the case with Oedipus.

The oracle delivered to Oedipus is what is often called a &quot;self-fulfilling prophecy,&quot; whereby a prophecy itself sets in motion events that conclude with its own fulfilment. This, however, is not to say that Oedipus is a victim of fate and has no free will. The oracle inspires a series of specific choices, freely made by Oedipus, which lead him to kill his father and marry his mother. Oedipus &quot;chooses&quot; not to return to Corinth after hearing the oracle, just as he chooses to head toward Thebes, to kill Laius, and to take Jocasta specifically as his wife. In response to the plague at Thebes, he &quot;chooses&quot; to send Creon to the Oracle for advice and then to follow that advice, initiating the investigation into Laius&#x27; murder. None of these choices are predetermined.
Another characteristic of oracles in myth is that they are almost always misunderstood by those who hear them; hence Oedipus misunderstanding the significance of the Delphic Oracle. He visits Delphi to find out who his real parents are and assumes that the Oracle refuses to answer that question, offering instead an unrelated prophecy which forecasts patricide and incest. Oedipus&#x27; assumption is incorrect: the Oracle does, in a way, answer his question. On closer analysis, the oracle contains essential information which Oedipus seems to neglect. The wording of the Oracle: &quot;I was doomed to be murderer of the father that begot me&quot; refers to Oedipus&#x27; real, biological father. Likewise the mother with polluted children is defined as the biological one. The wording of the drunken guest on the other hand: &quot;you are not your father&#x27;s son&quot; defines Polybus as only a foster father to Oedipus. The two wordings support each other and point to the &quot;two sets of parents&quot; alternative. Thus the question of two sets of parents, biological and foster, is raised. Oedipus&#x27; reaction to the Oracle is irrational: he states he did not get any answer and he flees in a direction away from Corinth, showing that he firmly believed at the time that Polybus and Merope are his real parents.

The scene with the drunken guest constitutes the end of Oedipus&#x27; childhood. He can no longer ignore a feeling of uncertainty about his parentage. However, after consulting the Oracle this uncertainty disappears, strangely enough, and is replaced by a totally unjustified certainty that he is the son of Merope and Polybus. We have said that this irrational behaviour—his &quot;hamartia&quot;, as Aristotle puts it—is due to the repression of a whole series of thoughts in his consciousness, in fact everything that referred to his earlier doubts about his parentage.

===State control===

The exploration of the theme of state control in &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; is paralleled by the examination of the conflict between the individual and the state in &quot;Antigone&quot;. The dilemma that Oedipus faces here is similar to that of the tyrannical Creon: each man has, as king, made a decision that his subjects question or disobey; and each king misconstrues both his own role as a sovereign and the role of the rebel. When informed by the blind prophet Tiresias that religious forces are against him, each king claims that the priest has been corrupted. It is here, however, that their similarities come to an end: while Creon sees the havoc he has wreaked and tries to amend his mistakes, Oedipus refuses to listen to anyone. (The above text comes almost directly from David Grene&#x27;s introduction to &quot;Sophocles I&quot;, University of Chicago Press, 1954.)

=== Irony ===

Sophocles uses dramatic irony to present the downfall of Oedipus. At the beginning of the story, Oedipus is portrayed as &quot;self-confident, intelligent and strong willed.&quot; By the end, it is within these traits that he finds his demise.

One of the most significant instances of irony in this tragedy is when Tiresias hints to Oedipus what he has done; that he has slain his own father and married his own mother (lines 457–60):

The audience knows the truth and what would be the fate of Oedipus. Oedipus, on the other hand, chooses to deny the reality that has confronted him. He ignores the word of Tiresias and continues on his journey to find the supposed killer. His search for a murderer is yet another instance of irony. Oedipus, determined to find the one responsible for King Laius&#x27; death, announces to his people (lines 247–53):

This is ironic as Oedipus is, as he discovers, the slayer of Laius, and the curse he wishes upon the killer, he has actually wished upon himself. Glassberg (2017) explains that “Oedipus has clearly missed the mark. He is unaware that he is the one polluting agent he seeks to punish. He has inadequate knowledge...”

=== Sight and blindness ===
Literal and metaphorical references to eyesight appear throughout &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;. Clear vision serves as a metaphor for insight and knowledge, yet the clear-eyed Oedipus is blind to the truth about his origins and inadvertent crimes. The prophet Tiresias, on the other hand, although literally blind, &quot;sees&quot; the truth and relays what is revealed to him. Only after Oedipus gouges out his own eyes, physically blinding himself, does he gain prophetic ability, as exhibited in &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;. It is deliberately ironic that the &quot;seer&quot; can &quot;see&quot; better than Oedipus, despite being blind. Tiresias, in anger, expresses such (lines 495–500):

=== Tyranny ===
Oedipus switches back and forth calling Laius a tyrant (lines 128–129) and a king (lines 254–256) throughout the duration of the play. This is done as a way to make Laius his equal in terms of ruling. Laius was a legitimate king, whereas Oedipus had no legitimate claim to rule. Oedipus&#x27;s claims of calling Laius a tyrant hint at his own insecurities of being a tyrant.The tyranny brought down the way it was, what

&quot;troubles&quot; could keep you from looking into it?

For even if a god weren&#x27;t forcing this on you

you shouldn&#x27;t leave it festering so, and this

the case of a noble man, your murdered king.

==Sigmund Freud==
Sigmund Freud wrote a notable passage in &quot;Interpretation of Dreams&quot; regarding the destiny of Oedipus, as well as the Oedipus complex. He analyzes why this play, &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, written in Ancient Greece, is so effective even to a modern audience:

&quot;His destiny moves us only because it might have been ours — because the oracle laid the same curse upon us before our birth as upon him. It is the fate of all of us, perhaps, to direct our first sexual impulse towards our mother and our first hatred and our first murderous wish against our father. Our dreams convince us that this is so.&quot;

Freud goes on to indicate, however, that the “primordial urges and fears” that are his concern are not found primarily in the play by Sophocles, but exist in the myth the play is based on. He refers to &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; as a “further modification of the legend,” one that originates in a “misconceived secondary revision of the material, which has sought to exploit it for theological purposes.”

In her article, &quot;Oedipal Textuality: Reading Freud&#x27;s Reading of Oedipus,&quot; Cynthia Chase explains Oedipus Rex as a story of psychoanalysis in relation to the riddles in the story and Oedipus trying to uncover his truth. 
===Parsifal===

The &quot;Parsifal&quot; story is the &quot;reverse&quot; of the &quot;Oedipus&quot; myth (cf., Claude Lévi-Strauss).

==Adaptations==
===Film adaptations===

The first English-language adaption, &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; (1957), was directed by Tyrone Guthrie and starred Douglas Campbell as Oedipus. In this version, the entire play is performed by the cast in masks (Greek: &quot;prosopon&quot;), as actors did in ancient Greek theatre.

The second English-language film version, &quot;Oedipus the King&quot; (1968), was directed by Philip Saville and filmed in Greece. Unlike Guthrie&#x27;s film, this version shows the actors&#x27; faces, as well as boasting an all-star cast, including Christopher Plummer as Oedipus; Lilli Palmer as Jocasta; Orson Welles as Tiresias; Richard Johnson as Creon; Roger Livesey as the Shepherd; and Donald Sutherland as the Leading Member of the Chorus. Sutherland&#x27;s voice, however, was dubbed by another actor. The film went a step further than the play by actually showing, in flashback, the murder of Laius (portrayed by Friedrich Ledebur). It also shows Oedipus and Jocasta in bed together, making love. Though released in 1968, this film was not seen in Europe or the US until the 1970s and 1980s after legal release and distribution rights were granted to video and television.

In Italy, Pier Paolo Pasolini directed &quot;Edipo Re&quot; (1967), a modern interpretation of the play.

Toshio Matsumoto&#x27;s film, &quot;Funeral Parade of Roses&quot; (1969), is a loose adaptation of the play and an important work of the Japanese New Wave.

In Colombia, writer Gabriel García Márquez adapted the story in &quot;Edipo Alcalde&quot;, bringing it to the real-world situation of Colombia at the time.

The Nigerian film &quot;The Gods are STILL not to Blame&quot; (2012) was produced by Funke Fayoyin, premiering at Silverbird Galleria in Lagos.

Park Chan-wook&#x27;s South Korean film, &quot;Oldboy&quot; (2003), was inspired by the play while making several notable changes to allow it to work in a modern South-Korean setting. The film even alters the iconic twist, causing many American critics to overlook the connection. It received widespread acclaim, and is seen in South Korea as the definitive adaptation.

===Stage adaptations===

The composer Igor Stravinsky wrote the opera-oratorio &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, which premiered in 1927 at the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt, Paris. It is scored for orchestra, speaker, soloists, and male chorus. The libretto, based on Sophocles&#x27;s tragedy, was written by Jean Cocteau in French and then translated by Abbé Jean Daniélou into Latin. The narration, however, is performed in the language of the audience. The work was written towards the beginning of Stravinsky&#x27;s neoclassical period and is considered one of the finest works from this phase of the composer&#x27;s career. He had considered setting the language of the work in Ancient Greek, but decided ultimately on Latin, as &quot;a medium not dead but turned to stone.&quot;

Nigerian writer Ola Rotimi adapted &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; into a 1968 play and novel, titling it &quot;The Gods Are Not to Blame&quot;. In 2012, the play was further adapted by Otun Rasheed, under the title &quot;The Gods Are STILL Not to Blame&quot;.

Dancer and choreographer Martha Graham adapted &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; into a short ballet entitled &quot;Night Journey&quot;, premiering in 1947. In this adaptation, the action focuses not on Oedipus, but upon Jocasta, reflecting on her strange destiny.

Composer Wolfgang Rihm used the play as a basis for his 1987 opera &quot;Oedipus&quot;, also writing the libretto in German which includes related texts by Friedrich Nietzsche and Heiner Müller. It premiered at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, directed by Götz Friedrich in a performance broadcast live.

===TV/radio adaptations===
Don Taylor&#x27;s 1986 translation/adaptation of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; using the English title &quot;Oedipus the King&quot; formed part of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Theban Plays&quot; trilogy. It starred Michael Pennington as Oedipus, with Claire Bloom as Jocasta, John Gielgud as Tiresias, and John Shrapnel as Creon. The actors performed in modern dress.

In 1977, CBS Radio Mystery Theater broadcast a version of the story called &quot;So Shall Ye Reap,&quot; set in 1851 in what was then the U.S. Territory of New Mexico.

In 1987, Brazilian TV Globo broadcast the soap opera Mandala a loose adaptation set in Brazil modern times starring Vera Fischer as Jocasta.

In 2017, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a production of Anthony Burgess&#x27; translation of the play with Christopher Eccleston as Oedipus and Fiona Shaw as Tiresias/Second Elder. John Shrapnel, who starred as Creon in the 1986 BBC television version, played the First Elder.

Other television portrayals of Oedipus include that of Christopher Plummer (1957), Ian Holm (1972), and Patrick Stewart (1977).

===Parodies===
Peter Schickele parodies both the story of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; and the music of Stravinsky&#x27;s opera-oratorio of the same name in &quot;Oedipus Tex&quot;, a Western-themed oratorio purportedly written by P.D.Q. Bach. It was released in 1990 on the album &quot;Oedipus Tex and Other Choral Calamities&quot;.

Chrysanthos Mentis Bostantzoglou makes a parody of the tragedy in his comedy &quot;Medea&quot; (1993).

In episode ten of the second season of the Australian satirical comedy show &quot;CNNNN,&quot; a short animation in the style of a Disney movie trailer, complete with jaunty music provided by Andrew Hansen, parodies &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;. Apart from being advertised as &quot;fun for the whole family,&quot; the parody is also mentioned at other times during that same episode, such as in a satirical advertisement in which orphans are offered a free &quot;&quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; ashes urn&quot; as a promotional offer after losing a relative.
John Barth&#x27;s novel &quot;Giles Goat-Boy&quot; contains a forty-page parody of the full text of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; called &quot;Taliped Decanus&quot;.

Tom Lehrer wrote and performed a comedic song based upon &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; in 1959.

Bo Burnham references Oedipus in songs &quot;Words Words Words&quot; and &quot;Rant&quot;, both part of his album, &quot;Words Words Words&quot;.

<text>NewsRadio is an American television sitcom that aired on NBC from March 21, 1995, to May 4, 1999, focusing on the work lives of the staff of a New York City AM news radio station. It had an ensemble cast featuring Dave Foley, Stephen Root, Andy Dick, Maura Tierney, Vicki Lewis, Joe Rogan, Khandi Alexander, and Phil Hartman in his final regular role before his death in 1998; Jon Lovitz joined the show after Hartman&#x27;s death.

The series was created by executive producer Paul Simms and was filmed in front of a studio audience at CBS Studio Center and Sunset Gower Studios. The theme song was composed by Mike Post, who also scored the pilot. 

==Overview==
The series is set at WNYX, a fictional AM broadcasting all-news radio station in New York City, populated by an eccentric station owner and staff. The show begins with the arrival of new news director Dave Nelson (Dave Foley). While Dave turns out to be more experienced than his youthful appearance suggests, he never fully gains control of his co-workers.

The scripts and ensemble cast combined physical humor and visual gags with quick-witted dialogue and farcical storylines. Plots often involved satirical takes on historical events, news stories, and pop culture references. The third and fourth season finales took the surrealism to the extreme, setting the characters in outer space and aboard the &quot;Titanic&quot;, respectively.

&quot;NewsRadio&quot; debuted on March 21, 1995. It took over the time slot from &quot;Something Wilder&quot;.

There are a total of 97 episodes. Reruns continued in syndication for several years before disappearing in most markets. However, the show has aired on A&amp;E, Nick at Nite, and TBS network in the United States, and DTour and the Comedy Network in Canada. In the United States, the show occasionally airs as a filler on WGN America and runs regularly on Reelz, Antenna TV, and Rewind TV. For several years starting in July 2007, the program was syndicated through The Program Exchange.

==Episodes==

==Characters==

===Main===
* Dave Nelson (Dave Foley) is WNYX&#x27;s news director, described as a &quot;Midwesterner out of place in New York and pointedly young for such a responsible job&quot;. He was raised in Wisconsin, although he was born in Canada. Dave has a number of talents that the other staff members consider embarrassing, including tap dancing, acting work in high school, participation in an all-male a cappella group, knife throwing, and ventriloquism. He also has a very friendly, formal, and easy-going personality, which contrasts with the more lively personalities of the other characters and the farcical situations that occur on the show. He frequently has phone conversations with his mother and keeps a picture of her in his desk. He has an overwhelming coffee addiction, as well as a strong passion for television and classic sitcoms, particularly &quot;Green Acres&quot; and &quot;Mister Ed&quot;. Dave has an inexplicable &quot;obsession&quot;, as Lisa calls it, with the America song &quot;A Horse with No Name&quot;. 
* Jimmy James (Stephen Root) is the station&#x27;s extroverted, playful billionaire owner. His name comes from the Beastie Boys song &quot;Jimmy James&quot;. Despite owning a vast corporate empire, he seems to enjoy micromanaging WNYX. He acts as a father figure toward his employees, often helping them learn life lessons. Recurring gags associated with Mr. James include his search for a wife (for which he keeps an extensive list of potential &quot;wife candidates&quot;), his infatuation with Dave&#x27;s mother, his inability to act, his rivalries with other wealthy entrepreneurs (such as Ted Turner and Bill Gates), and his considerable inside knowledge of conspiracies and government cover-ups; he claims to have been Deep Throat and is at one point suspected to have been the infamous aircraft hijacker D. B. Cooper. In the show&#x27;s series finale, Mr. James &quot;retires&quot; to New Hampshire, where he buys a news radio station and newspaper, taking most of the WNYX staff with him.
* Matthew Brock (Andy Dick) is a news reporter. Superficially clumsy, naive, and immature, he is the butt of many physical jokes on the show; he is often seen tripping, falling, flying over furniture, or handling electronics that explode or catch fire. Matthew idolizes Bill, who bullies him in return. Later in the series, he displays an affinity for science fiction and fantasy media. Matthew holds a degree in dentistry — and appears to be a very competent dental practitioner — but prefers radio journalism, despite the fact he is very often shown to be truly inept at it. He develops a crush on Lisa. He initially dislikes Max, seeing him as an interloper who is trying to take Bill&#x27;s place, and believes himself to be Bill&#x27;s rightful successor, but eventually grows to like him.
* Lisa Miller (Maura Tierney), with whom Dave has an intermittent relationship, serves as reporter, on-air personality, producer, and news director briefly in the series. An obsessive overachiever, Lisa can instantly perform complex mathematical calculations and keeps a detailed life-plan. She frequently brags about her SAT scores and retakes the exam well out of college. Also, she gets turned on if she yells too much. Lisa was born in Boston, living there until the age of seven when her family moved to Connecticut. She represses a working-class Boston accent, which results in her having a sibilant &quot;S&quot; while speaking. During the first two seasons of the show, she is in regular contact with her ex-boyfriend Stuart, with the suggestion that they might still be in love. In season five, she marries Jimmy&#x27;s archenemy Johnny Johnson (played by Patrick Warburton).
* Beth (Vicki Lewis) is Dave&#x27;s secretary. She wears ridiculous, often midriff-baring outfits, has bright red hair, and chews gum. Her salary is often the subject of jokes; characters frequently point out that she &quot;earns next to nothing&quot;. Her first name comes from the Kiss song &quot;Beth&quot;, and she claims that she does not have a last name. In the third season DVD commentary, the writers revealed they had planned to have Jimmy adopt Beth as his daughter, but felt there was never a right time for it.
* Joe Garrelli (Joe Rogan) is the station&#x27;s street-smart electrician and handyman. He is notorious for his seemingly nonchalant approach to his profession. Believing that consumer products are &quot;rip-offs&quot;, he is known to personally craft his own supplies (such as homemade duct tape) and gadgets for others around the office (among many a stun gun, a white noise machine and a two-way radio). He also espouses various conspiracy theories, particularly with regard to the government&#x27;s suppression of information about extraterrestrial life. Throughout the series, he displays an infatuation with Catherine Duke. On several occasions, the other employees at the station speculate that Joe might have been the Unabomber. The character of Joe was originally named Rick, and was played by Greg Lee in the pilot episode. Ray Romano was originally cast to play Joe, but was replaced because his style of verbal comedy did not mesh well with the fast-paced wit of the rest of the cast.
* Catherine Duke (Khandi Alexander) is the second of WNYX&#x27;s news anchors. She is often bitter rivals with co-anchor Bill McNeal; according to Bill, this is partly due to an office affair they had years earlier. When she was younger she worked with her uncle and learned how to perform and identify numerous scams, such as Three-card Monte. She is well known for slapping her co-workers in the event words do not express her contempt for a certain situation. Catherine is noted for being direct with people, though she is willing to use her charms to get her way. Catherine leaves the station to take a job in London during the fourth season. She makes a brief appearance in the fifth-season premiere for Bill&#x27;s funeral. The role of Catherine was played by Ella Joyce in the pilot episode.

* Evelyn William &quot;Bill&quot; McNeal (Phil Hartman) is a news co-anchor for WNYX. Loud, arrogant, and free-spirited, Bill is frequently a thorn in the news director&#x27;s side. Bill was the breakout character. His relationships are often unorthodox or contentious. He often displays jarring gaps in knowledge. Another running joke in the show has Bill describing painful stories with an air of cheerful nostalgia, often wistfully saying, &quot;good times, good times&quot;. Bill occasionally shows flashes of concern and wisdom for his co-workers, whom he perceives as friends. Hartman&#x27;s death during the production hiatus after the fourth season is addressed in the first episode of the fifth season, where his character is revealed to have died of a sudden heart attack. An issue of &quot;Radio Ink&quot; magazine displaying Hartman on its cover was subsequently displayed in Dave&#x27;s office as a tribute to the actor and character following his death. Bill is shown reading from said issue in the season four episode “Who’s the Boss?”
* Max Louis (Jon Lovitz) is Bill McNeal&#x27;s replacement in season five. He is socially awkward, neurotic and terrible at his job. Max has a penchant for redheads, and Beth in particular, but she quickly ends up despising him. He says that Max Louis is not his true identity, because he uses a different persona every time he gets a new job. Max gets the job at WNYX because he is an old colleague of Bill&#x27;s, a plot point that reflects the real-life fact that Jon Lovitz took the role in &quot;NewsRadio&quot; out of friendship with Phil Hartman. When asked why he joined &quot;NewsRadio&quot;, Lovitz stated that show creator Paul Simms told Lovitz, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what to tell you. You&#x27;re his friend. It feels right. Everybody in the cast wants you.&quot; Lovitz first appeared on &quot;Our Fiftieth Episode&quot; when Bill meets him in a mental ward going by the name Fred. Fred later admits he is really an air traffic controller who periodically and voluntarily &quot;flips out&quot; and goes into the mental ward for a vacation from making decisions. Lovitz returned a second time in the fourth season opener &quot;Jumper&quot;. In the episode, Lovitz plays Mike Johnson, a disgruntled former employee who has been fired and is threatening to commit suicide by jumping from the ledge outside Dave&#x27;s office.

=== Recurring ===
The only recurring character to appear in more than one production season is that of Jimmy&#x27;s lawyer, Roger, played initially by Norm Macdonald, and later by &quot;NewsRadio&quot; writer Drake Sather, who did a vocal impersonation of Norm Macdonald.

Several other actors appeared in multiple seasons playing different characters, notably Lovitz, David Cross, Toby Huss, Brian Posehn, David Anthony Higgins, Dave Allen, Wallace Langham, and Bob Odenkirk.

Tone Lōc and Toby Huss played security guards Lorenzo and Junior in two episodes in season 2. The characters were based on the security guards at the studio where &quot;NewsRadio&quot; was shot. During the last season, Patrick Warburton had a recurring role as Johnny Johnson, Jimmy&#x27;s nemesis and Lisa&#x27;s love interest (and eventual husband).

Lauren Graham had a four-episode run as Andrea, a manipulative efficiency expert who shakes up the office (firing Matthew, demoting Dave, and promoting Lisa). She is sometimes referred to as &quot;Planbee&quot; after Matthew misunderstands her being Jimmy&#x27;s &quot;Plan B&quot; for the office. In a season 4 episode commentary track, Tierney gives the hiring of Graham as a possible explanation for Alexander&#x27;s departure, which contradicts the idea that Alexander intended to leave before Graham appeared on the show (In Dave Foley&#x27;s appearance on Joe Rogan&#x27;s podcast, they talked about Alexander leaving because she was not given enough lines). All of the changes introduced during Graham&#x27;s time on the show would be restored by mid-season to the way things were before her arrival.

Brad Rowe had a four-episode run as Walt the intern, Jimmy&#x27;s nephew who has a crush on Lisa, which causes more worry for Dave.

==Home media==
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released all five seasons of &quot;NewsRadio&quot; on DVD in Region 1 between 2005 and 2007. Each set includes multiple audio commentaries with creator Paul Simms, the writers and actors. The DVD sets also include special features such as gag reels and other featurettes.

On August 27, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to various television series from the Sony Pictures library, including &quot;NewsRadio&quot;. They subsequently re-released the first two seasons on DVD on April 1, 2014.

On May 19, 2015, Mill Creek Entertainment re-released &quot;NewsRadio – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

==Nielsen ratings==
Ratings were inconsistent, and the show never placed higher than 26th. During its run, &quot;NewsRadio&quot;″s time slot changed eleven times.

On its first two broadcasts, the show received a 20 share, improving on its lead-in (&quot;Wings&quot;) by a percentage point, and beating its competitors (&quot;Under One Roof&quot; and &quot;Thunder Alley&quot;) in its share of the 18- to 49-year-old audience.

<doc id="87776" wikidata="Q4945056" url="?curid=87776" title="Borghild">
<text>In Norse mythology, Borghild was the first wife of Sigmund. They had two sons, Hamund and Helgi.

== &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; ==
Sinfjötli (Borghild&#x27;s step-son) &quot;saw a lovely woman and strongly desired to have her. The brother of Borghild, the wife of King Sigmund, had also asked for her hand.&quot;. Sinfjötli killed the brother in a contest to win the maiden&#x27;s hand, and Sinfjötli won. He became very famous. When he came home, he told his father Sigmund what had happened. Sigmund then told Borghild, and Borghild wanted Sinfjötli to leave the kingdom for killing her brother. Sigmund defended Sinfjötli, but offered to pay Borghild compensation. This was a generous offer, similar to Hrafnkel&#x27;s offer to Thorbjorn for the death of Einar in &quot;Hrafnkels saga&quot;. Borghild, however, was not placated by this and said &quot;You shall decide, sir, as is fitting.&quot;.

Borghild then arranged a funeral feast for her brother, and she served the drink.

Serving the drink was characteristic of the shieldmaiden in the stories about Valhalla. She tells Sinfjötli to drink, but he says it is poisoned, and Sigmund takes it instead. Borghild makes fun of Sinfjötli saying, &quot;Why should other men drink ale for you?&quot;. She then orders him to drink a second time, but Sinfjötli won&#x27;t and Sigmund drinks it again. Borghild dares him a third time, saying that he should &quot;drain it, if he had the heart of a Volsung.&quot;. Sigmund is drunk at this point and isn&#x27;t thinking clearly, so he also bids Sinfjötli to drink. Sinfjötli drank it and died. Sigmund was furious that his wife killed his son, so he drove Borghild out of the kingdom. Borghild died shortly after that.
Borghild&#x27;s poison worked on Sinfjötli and not Sigmund because of the Volsung blood. According to legend, the Volsung family descended from Odin, and were therefore part god. Sigmund had more god-like blood in him than Sinfjötli, so Sigmund could withstand the poison, and Sinfjötli could not.

<text>MP/M (Multi-Programming Monitor Control Program) is a discontinued multi-user version of the CP/M operating system, created by Digital Research developer Tom Rolander in 1979. It allowed multiple users to connect to a single computer, each using a separate terminal.

MP/M was a fairly advanced operating system for its era, at least on microcomputers. It included a priority-scheduled multitasking kernel (before such a name was used, the kernel was referred to as the &quot;nucleus&quot;) with memory protection, concurrent input/output (XIOS) and support for spooling and queueing. It also allowed for each user to run multiple programs, and switch between them.

==MP/M platforms==
===MP/M-80===

The 8-bit system required a 8080 (or Z80) CPU and a minimum of 32 KB of RAM to run, but this left little memory for user applications. In order to support reasonable setups, MP/M allowed for memory to be switched in and out of the machine&#x27;s &quot;real memory&quot; area. So for instance a program might be loaded into a &quot;bank&quot; of RAM that was not addressable by the CPU, and when it was time for the program to run that bank of RAM would be &quot;switched&quot; to appear in low memory (typically the lower 32 or 48 KB) and thus become visible to the OS. This technique, known as bank switching was subsequently added to the single user version of CP/M with version 3.0.

One of the primary uses of MP/M, perhaps to the surprise of DRI, was as a &quot;power user&quot; version of CP/M for a single user. The ability to run several programs at the same time and address large amounts of memory made the system worth the extra price.

MP/M II 2.0 added file sharing capabilities in 1981, MP/M II 2.1 came with extended file locking in January 1982.

Versions:
* MP/M 1.0 (1979)
* MP/M 1.1 (January 1980)
* MP/M II 2.0 (July 1981, added: file sharing)
* MP/M II 2.1 (January 1982, added: extended file locking)

===MP/M-86===

Like CP/M, MP/M was eventually ported to the 16-bit Intel 8086, and appeared as MP/M-86 2.0 in September 1981. Main developers of the system include Francis &quot;Frank&quot; R. Holsworth, later a director of marketing at Digital Research. Known revisions of MP/M-86 2.0 were dated 25 September 1981 and 5 October 1981. There also was an MP/M-86 2.1 dated 20 July 1982.

MP/M-86 2.1 absorbed some of the technology of CP/M-86 1.1 (BDOS 2.2) to become Concurrent CP/M-86 3.0 (BDOS 3.0) in late 1982, which also added support for &quot;virtual screens&quot;. Kathryn Strutynski, the project manager for CP/M-86, continued as project manager for Concurrent CP/M-86. In December 1983, a DOS emulator named PC-MODE became available as an optional module for Concurrent CP/M-86 3.1 (BDOS 3.1), shipping on 21 February 1984, and the system was further developed into the MS-DOS compatible Concurrent DOS (BDOS 3.1 and higher). This in turn continued to evolve into FlexOS and Multiuser DOS and as such is still in use in some industrial applications.

Concurrent CP/M is often abbreviated CCP/M.

===MP/M 8-16===

MP/M 8-16 (sometimes also referred to as &quot;MP/M-8/16&quot;) was CompuPro&#x27;s name for a combination of the multi-user 16-bit MP/M-86 to perform single-user, single-stream CP/M functions, along with multi-user, multi-tasking 8-bit MP/M operations running on the multi-processor . Later on, this system was also able to run Concurrent DOS 3.1.
===MP/M-286===

In 1982, Digital Research announced plans to develop MP/M-286 to take advantage of the 16-bit Intel 80286&#x27;s new memory management and protection features to run existing MP/M-86 and CP/M-86 applications. This was apparently never published &quot;as is&quot;, but was further developed into Concurrent CP/M-286, which seems to have formed the basis for the later Concurrent DOS 286 in 1985 and FlexOS 286 in 1986.
==Commands==

==CP/NET, CP/NOS, MP/NET and MP/NOS ==
In the early 1980s Digital Research also developed networking software named CP/NET used to connect an MP/M server with multiple CP/NET clients (named requesters) running CP/M. It was originally developed by Tom Rolander.

MP/NET was an MP/M system with networking allowing the MP/M system to function as both requester and server with CP/M requesters.

The CP/NET clients could also be run in a diskless configuration with the system stored in ROM, then named CP/NOS (with NOS for Network Operating System). Similar, MP/NOS contained MP/M without local disk facilities. Like CP/NOS, MP/NOS performed the disk functions through the network.

The system allowed to share files and printers and send electronic messages.

* NIOS – Network I/O System
* SNIOS – Slave Network I/O System
* NDOS – Network Disk Operating System

CP/NET existed in versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 in versions for 8080 and Z80 processors. CP/NET-86 for 8086 was available as well.

Later incarnations were DR Net and FlexNet.

==Legacy==
Caldera permitted the redistribution and modification of all original Digital Research files, including source code, related to the CP/M and MP/M families through Tim Olmstead&#x27;s &quot;The Unofficial CP/M Web site&quot; since 1997. After Olmstead&#x27;s death on 12 September 2001, the free distribution license was refreshed and expanded by Lineo, who had meanwhile become the owner of those Digital Research assets, on 19 October 2001.

<doc id="87784" wikidata="Q177564" url="?curid=87784" title="Pico de gallo">
<text>Pico de gallo (, ), also called salsa fresca (&#x27;fresh sauce&#x27;), salsa bandera (&#x27;flag sauce&#x27;), and salsa cruda (&#x27;raw sauce&#x27;), is a type of salsa commonly used in Mexican cuisine. It is traditionally made from chopped tomato, onion, and serrano peppers (jalapeños or habaneros may be used as alternatives), with salt, lime juice, and cilantro.

&quot;Pico de gallo&quot; can be used in much the same way as Mexican liquid salsas. Because it contains less liquid, it also can be used as a main ingredient in dishes such as tacos and fajitas.

The tomato-based variety is widely known as salsa picada (&#x27;minced/chopped sauce&#x27;). In Mexico it is normally called salsa mexicana (&#x27;Mexican sauce&#x27;). Because the colors of the red tomato, white onion, and green chili and cilantro are reminiscent of the colors of the Mexican flag, it is also called salsa bandera (&#x27;flag sauce&#x27;).

In many regions of Mexico the term &quot;pico de gallo&quot; describes any of a variety of salads (including fruit salads), salsa, or fillings made with tomato, tomatillo, avocado, orange, jícama, cucumber, papaya, or mild chilis. The ingredients are tossed in lime juice and optionally with either hot sauce or chamoy, then sprinkled with a salty chili powder.

==Etymology==
Many native residents of the Sonoran Mexico region explain that the salsa is thus named because the serrano pepper resembles a rooster&#x27;s beak in shape.

According to food writer Sharon Tyler Herbst, &quot;pico de gallo&quot; (&quot;rooster&#x27;s beak&quot;) is named thus because originally people ate it by pinching pieces between the thumb and forefinger.

In their book &quot;Authentic Mexican: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico&quot;, Rick Bayless and Deann Groen speculate that the name might allude to the bird-feed–like texture and appearance of the mince.

<text>In Mexico and Central America, a corn tortilla or just tortilla (, ) is a type of thin, unleavened flatbread, made from hominy, that is the whole kernels of maize treated with alkali to improve their nutrition in a process called nixtamalization. A simple dough made of ground hominy, salt and water is then formed into flat discs and cooked on a very hot surface, generally an iron griddle called a comal.

A similar flatbread from South America, called an &quot;arepa&quot; (made with ground maize, not hominy, and typically much thicker than tortillas), predates the arrival of Europeans to America, and was called &quot;tortilla&quot; by the Spanish from its resemblance to traditional Spanish round, unleavened cakes and omelettes. The Aztecs and other Nahuatl-speakers call tortillas tlaxcalli (). The successful conquest of the Aztec empire by the Spanish and the subsequent colonial empire ruled from the former Aztec capital have ensured that this variation become the prototypical tortilla for much of the Spanish-speaking world.

Maize kernels naturally occur in many colors, depending on cultivar: from pale white, to yellow, to red and bluish purple. Likewise, corn meal and the tortillas made from it may be similarly colored. White and yellow tortillas are by far the most common, however. In Mexico, there are three colors of maize dough for making tortillas: white maize, yellow maize and blue maize (also referred to as black maize). Tortilla is a common food in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.

==Etymology==
&quot;Tortilla&quot;, from Spanish &quot;torta&quot;, cake, plus the diminutive &quot;-illa&quot;, literally means &quot;little cake&quot;. Nahuatl &quot;tlaxcalli&quot; is derived from the verb &quot;(i)xca&quot; &quot;to bake&quot; with the help of the prefix &quot;tla&quot;- and two common suffixes -&quot;l&quot;- and -&quot;li&quot; (&lt;-&quot;tli&quot;), that is &quot;something baked&quot;.

&quot;Tortilla&quot; in Iberian Spanish also means omelette. As such, this corn flour flatbread tortilla is not to be confused with the Spanish omelette or any other egg-based one.

==History==

The corn tortilla was first developed in Mexico, during prehistoric times. It has since become a staple carbohydrate in North American and Mesoamerican cultures. It predates its derivative, the wheat flour tortilla (&quot;tortilla de harina&quot; or &quot;tortilla de trigo&quot;), in all such cultures. This is because old world wheat was neither known nor grown in the Americas prior to European colonization.

In Aztec times two or three corn tortillas would be eaten with each meal, either plain or dipped in mole or a chili pepper and water sauce. Tortillas were also sold at Aztec marketplaces filled with turkey meat, turkey eggs, beans, honey, squash, prickly pears and various preparations of chili pepper.

Analogous staple carbohydrates in New World cultures, all made from hominy and serving a similar nutritional function, include the &quot;sope&quot;, the &quot;totopo&quot;, the &quot;gordita&quot;, the &quot;tlacoyo&quot; of Mexico, and the &quot;pupusa&quot; of Central America. The &quot;arepa&quot; of northern South America, though similar, is made with ground maize, not hominy, and does not offer the same nutrition profile as foods whose maize has been processed with alkali.

The &quot;tamal&quot; (or tamale) of Mexico is also made from &quot;nixtamal&quot; (the Nahuatl word for hominy is the source of the term &#x27;nixtamalization&#x27;), but is much thicker and a dish unto itself, usually including other ingredients and flavors.

==Mexico==
Maize has been a staple food for thousands of years. It is the most-planted crop in the Mexican region. The country grows more than 42 distinct maize cultivars, each of which has several varieties. These varieties are estimated to number more than 3,000 by the International Center for the Improvement of Maize and Wheat (CIMMYT). The characteristics of each variety depend upon soil conditions, humidity, altitude, and its means of cultivation. Some of the earliest evidence of maize cultivation suggests that its original domestication was in fact simultaneous in several places.

Maize is the basis of most Mexican cuisine, with some exception in the culinary traditions of northern Mexico, where wheat is taking the place of maize as the cereal base. In Mexico, the primary use of maize is the tortilla, but it is also a principal ingredient in other foods including tamales and atole. The maize used for tortillas can be ripe and dry, but it is also consumed fresh and mature (maize), or soft and fresh (&quot;xilote&quot;).

Tortillas are consumed daily. Factory-made tortillas are widely sold, although they can easily be made at home. Tortilla production starts in the early morning as lunch is the main meal of the day for most people. In Mexico, lunch is eaten between 1:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. (1330 to 1530). Some supermarkets and grocery stores sell freshly made tortillas throughout the day.

Mexican and, more generally, Latin American dishes made with maize tortillas include:

* Chalupas
* Chilaquiles
* Enchiladas
* Enfrijoladas
* Entomatadas
* Gorditas
* Pan de cazón
* Pastel azteca
* Peneques
* Quesadillas
* Sincronizadas
* Sopes
* Tacos
* Tacos dorados
* Tlayudas
* Totopos – Tortilla chips
* Tortilla soup
* Tostadas

==Preparation==
A tortilla is made by curing maize in limewater in the nixtamalization process, which causes the skin of the corn kernels to peel off (the waste material is typically fed to poultry), then grinding and cooking it, kneading it into a dough called &quot;masa nixtamalera&quot;, pressing it flat into thin patties using a rolling pin, tortilla press or by hand, and cooking it on a very hot &quot;comal&quot; (originally a flat terra cotta griddle, now usually made of light sheet-metal instead). The process, called nixtamalization, was developed indigenously by pre-Columbian cultures and predates European contact by many centuries, if not millennia. Soaking the maize in limewater is important because it makes available the B vitamin niacin and the amino acid tryptophan. When maize was brought to Europe, Africa and Asia from the New World, this crucial step was often omitted. Those whose diet consisted mostly of corn meal often became sick — because of the lack of niacin and tryptophan — with the deficiency disease pellagra, which was common in Spain, Northern Italy, and the southern United States.

In Mexico, particularly in the towns and cities, corn tortillas are often made nowadays by machine and are very thin and uniform, but in many places in the country, they are still made by hand, even when the &quot;nixtamal&quot; is ground into masa by machine. Corn tortillas are customarily served and eaten warm; when cool, they often become rubbery or grainy as the cooked starches stale. The largest tortilla producer in the world is the Mexican company Gruma, headquartered in Monterrey.

Traditionally throughout Mesoamerica from pre-Hispanic times into the mid-20th century, the &quot;masa&quot; was prepared by women using a &quot;mano&quot; (a cylinder-shaped stone like a rolling pin) and &quot;metate&quot; (a stone base with a slightly concave top for holding the corn). This method is still used in some places in Mexico and Central America.

The wheat flour tortilla was an innovation after wheat was brought to the New World from Spain while this region was the colony of New Spain. It is made with an unleavened, water-based dough, pressed and cooked like corn tortillas. These tortillas are very similar to the unleavened bread popular in Arab, eastern Mediterranean and southern Asian countries, though thinner and smaller in diameter. In China the &quot;laobing&quot; (烙餅), a thick circular &quot;pancake&quot;, is similar to the tortilla. The Indian &quot;roti&quot;, which is made essentially from wheat flour, is another example.

Tortillas vary in size from about 6 to over 30 cm (2.4 to over 12 in), depending on the region of the country and the dish for which it is intended. Among tortilla variants (without being, strictly speaking, tortillas) there are &quot;pupusas&quot;, &quot;pishtones&quot;, &quot;gorditas&quot;, &quot;sopes&quot;, and &quot;tlacoyos&quot;. They are smaller, thicker versions to which beans, &quot;chicharrón&quot;, &quot;nopales&quot; or other ingredients have been added. They are customarily cooked on a greased pan.

In Nicaragua, a type of tortillas called &quot;güirilas&quot; are also consumed. They are made from young white corn. &quot;Güirilas&quot; are thick, sweet and filling. They are eaten alone, with cuajada and cream, meat, or accompanying a dish. In Argentina, Bolivia and southern Chile, the size of the tortillas is smaller. They are generally saltier, made from wheat or corn flour, and roasted in the ashes of a traditional adobe oven. This kind of tortilla is called &quot;sopaipilla&quot; (not to be confused with a puffy frybread of the same name common in the United States). In Chile and Argentina, it may also be sweetened after being cooked by boiling in sugar water.

In commercial production and even in some larger restaurants, automatic machines make tortillas from dough. A tortilla seller is, in or .
==Nutrition==

An uncooked corn tortilla made with nixtamalized corn at 46% hydration and depending on corn variety used and variations, consists of 45% carbohydrates, 3% fat, and 6% protein (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, a raw corn tortilla supplies 218 calories and is a rich source (20% or higher of the Daily Value, DV) of phosphorus (45% DV) and magnesium (20% DV). It is a moderate source (10-19% DV) of vitamin B6, niacin, manganese, and zinc (table).

==Uses==
Corn tortillas are the basis of many traditional Mexican dishes, such as tacos, tostadas, enchiladas, flautas, quesadillas, &quot;chilaquiles&quot;, and tortilla soup. Warmed corn tortillas are also often served as an accompaniment to stews, soups, grilled meats and other dishes, as bread might be served in other cuisines. By contrast, wheat flour tortillas are often used for burritos and quesadillas, particularly in the United States. Corn tortillas may also be deep fried to make crisp tortilla chips. These are often salted, and can be eaten alone or accompanied with various salsas and dips such as guacamole. Tortilla chips are a key ingredient in nachos.

<text>Joseph-Louis Lagrange (born Giuseppe Luigi Lagrangia or Giuseppe Ludovico De la Grange Tournier; 25 January 1736 – 10 April 1813), also reported as Giuseppe Luigi Lagrange or Lagrangia, was an Italian mathematician, physicist and astronomer, later naturalizedFrench. He made significant contributions to the fields of analysis, number theory, and both classical and celestial mechanics.

In 1766, on the recommendation of Leonhard Euler and d&#x27;Alembert, Lagrange succeeded Euler as the director of mathematics at the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, Prussia, where he stayed for over twenty years, producing many volumes of work and winning several prizes of the French Academy of Sciences. Lagrange&#x27;s treatise on analytical mechanics (&quot;Mécanique analytique&quot;, 4. ed., 2 vols. Paris: Gauthier-Villars et fils, 1788–89), which was written in Berlin and first published in 1788, offered the most comprehensive treatment of classical mechanics since Isaac Newton and formed a basis for the development of mathematical physics in the nineteenth century.

In 1787, at age 51, he moved from Berlin to Paris and became a member of the French Academy of Sciences. He remained in France until the end of his life. He was instrumental in the decimalisation process in Revolutionary France, became the first professor of analysis at the École Polytechnique upon its opening in 1794, was a founding member of the Bureau des Longitudes, and became Senator in 1799.

==Scientific contribution==
Lagrange was one of the creators of the calculus of variations, deriving the Euler–Lagrange equations for extrema of functionals. He extended the method to include possible constraints, arriving at the method of Lagrange multipliers. Lagrange invented the method of solving differential equations known as variation of parameters, applied differential calculus to the theory of probabilities and worked on solutions for algebraic equations. He proved that every natural number is a sum of four squares. His treatise &quot;Theorie des fonctions analytiques&quot; laid some of the foundations of group theory, anticipating Galois. In calculus, Lagrange developed a novel approach to interpolation and Taylor&#x27;s theorem. He studied the three-body problem for the Earth, Sun and Moon (1764) and the movement of Jupiter&#x27;s satellites (1766), and in 1772 found the special-case solutions to this problem that yield what are now known as Lagrangian points. Lagrange is best known for transforming Newtonian mechanics into a branch of analysis, Lagrangian mechanics. He presented the mechanical &quot;principles&quot; as simple results of the variational calculus.

==Biography==

=== Early years ===
Firstborn of eleven children as &quot;Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia&quot;, Lagrange was of Italian and French descent. His paternal great-grandfather was a French captain of cavalry, whose family originated from the French region of Tours. After serving under Louis XIV, he had entered the service of Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy, and married a Conti from the noble Roman family. Lagrange&#x27;s father, Giuseppe Francesco Lodovico, was a doctor in Law at the University of Torino, while his mother was the only child of a rich doctor of Cambiano, in the countryside of Turin. He was raised as a Roman Catholic (but later on became an agnostic).

His father, who had charge of the King&#x27;s military chest and was Treasurer of the Office of Public Works and Fortifications in Turin, should have maintained a good social position and wealth, but before his son grew up he had lost most of his property in speculations. A career as a lawyer was planned out for Lagrange by his father, and certainly Lagrange seems to have accepted this willingly. He studied at the University of Turin and his favourite subject was classical Latin. At first, he had no great enthusiasm for mathematics, finding Greek geometry rather dull.

It was not until he was seventeen that he showed any taste for mathematics – his interest in the subject being first excited by a paper by Edmond Halley from 1693
which he came across by accident. Alone and unaided he threw himself into mathematical studies; at the end of a year&#x27;s incessant toil he was already an accomplished mathematician. Charles Emmanuel III appointed Lagrange to serve as the &quot;Sostituto del Maestro di Matematica&quot; (mathematics assistant professor) at the Royal Military Academy of the Theory and Practice of Artillery in 1755, where he taught courses in calculus and mechanics to support the Piedmontese army&#x27;s early adoption of the ballistics theories of Benjamin Robins and Leonhard Euler. In that capacity, Lagrange was the first to teach calculus in an engineering school. According to Alessandro Papacino D&#x27;Antoni, the academy&#x27;s military commander and famous artillery theorist, Lagrange unfortunately proved to be a problematic professor with his oblivious teaching style, abstract reasoning, and impatience with artillery and fortification-engineering applications. In this academy one of his students was François Daviet.

==== Variational calculus ====
Lagrange is one of the founders of the calculus of variations. Starting in 1754, he worked on the problem of the tautochrone, discovering a method of maximizing and minimizing functionals in a way similar to finding extrema of functions. Lagrange wrote several letters to Leonhard Euler between 1754 and 1756 describing his results. He outlined his &quot;δ-algorithm&quot;, leading to the Euler–Lagrange equations of variational calculus and considerably simplifying Euler&#x27;s earlier analysis. Lagrange also applied his ideas to problems of classical mechanics, generalising the results of Euler and Maupertuis.

Euler was very impressed with Lagrange&#x27;s results. It has been stated that &quot;with characteristic courtesy he withheld a paper he had previously written, which covered some of the same ground, in order that the young Italian might have time to complete his work, and claim the undisputed invention of the new calculus&quot;; however, this chivalric view has been disputed. Lagrange published his method in two memoirs of the Turin Society in 1762 and 1773.

==== &quot;Miscellanea Taurinensia&quot; ====
In 1758, with the aid of his pupils (mainly with Daviet), Lagrange established a society, which was subsequently incorporated as the Turin Academy of Sciences, and most of his early writings are to be found in the five volumes of its transactions, usually known as the &quot;Miscellanea Taurinensia&quot;. Many of these are elaborate papers. The first volume contains a paper on the theory of the propagation of sound; in this he indicates a mistake made by Newton, obtains the general differential equation for the motion, and integrates it for motion in a straight line. This volume also contains the complete solution of the problem of a string vibrating transversely; in this paper, he points out a lack of generality in the solutions previously given by Brook Taylor, D&#x27;Alembert, and Euler, and arrives at the conclusion that the form of the curve at any time &quot;t&quot; is given by the equation formula_1. The article concludes with a masterly discussion of echoes, beats, and compound sounds. Other articles in this volume are on recurring series, probabilities, and the calculus of variations.

The second volume contains a long paper embodying the results of several papers in the first volume on the theory and notation of the calculus of variations, and he illustrates its use by deducing the principle of least action, and by solutions of various problems in dynamics.

The third volume includes the solution of several dynamical problems by means of the calculus of variations; some papers on the integral calculus; a solution of a Fermat&#x27;s problem: given an integer which is not a perfect square, to find a number such that is a perfect square; and the general differential equations of motion for three bodies moving under their mutual attractions.

The next work he produced was in 1764 on the libration of the Moon, and an explanation as to why the same face was always turned to the earth, a problem which he treated by the aid of virtual work. His solution is especially interesting as containing the germ of the idea of generalised equations of motion, equations which he first formally proved in 1780.

=== Berlin ===
Already by 1756, Euler and Maupertuis, seeing Lagrange&#x27;s mathematical talent, tried to persuade Lagrange to come to Berlin, but he shyly refused the offer. In 1765, d&#x27;Alembert interceded on Lagrange&#x27;s behalf with Frederick of Prussia and by letter, asked him to leave Turin for a considerably more prestigious position in Berlin. He again turned down the offer, responding that
: &quot;It seems to me that Berlin would not be at all suitable for me while M.Euler is there&quot;.

In 1766, after Euler left Berlin for Saint Petersburg, Frederick himself wrote to Lagrange expressing the wish of &quot;the greatest king in Europe&quot; to have &quot;the greatest mathematician in Europe&quot; resident at his court. Lagrange was finally persuaded. He spent the next twenty years in Prussia, where he produced a long series of papers published in the Berlin and Turin transactions, and composed his monumental work, the &quot;Mécanique analytique&quot;. In 1767, he married his cousin Vittoria Conti.

Lagrange was a favourite of the king, who frequently lectured him on the advantages of perfect regularity of life. The lesson was accepted, and Lagrange studied his mind and body as though they were machines, and experimented to find the exact amount of work which he could do before exhaustion. Every night he set himself a definite task for the next day, and on completing any branch of a subject he wrote a short analysis to see what points in the demonstrations or the subject-matter were capable of improvement. He carefully planned his papers before writing them, usually without a single erasure or correction.

Nonetheless, during his years in Berlin, Lagrange&#x27;s health was rather poor, and that of his wife Vittoria was even worse. She died in 1783 after years of illness and Lagrange was very depressed. In 1786, Frederick II died, and the climate of Berlin became difficult for Lagrange.

=== Paris ===
In 1786, following Frederick&#x27;s death, Lagrange received similar invitations from states including Spain and Naples, and he accepted the offer of Louis XVI to move to Paris. In France he was received with every mark of distinction and special apartments in the Louvre were prepared for his reception, and he became a member of the French Academy of Sciences, which later became part of the Institut de France (1795). At the beginning of his residence in Paris, he was seized with an attack of melancholy, and even the printed copy of his &quot;Mécanique&quot; on which he had worked for a quarter of a century lay for more than two years unopened on his desk. Curiosity as to the results of the French Revolution first stirred him out of his lethargy, a curiosity which soon turned to alarm as the revolution developed.

It was about the same time, 1792, that the unaccountable sadness of his life and his timidity moved the compassion of 24-year-old Renée-Françoise-Adélaïde Le Monnier, daughter of his friend, the astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier. She insisted on marrying him and proved a devoted wife to whom he became warmly attached.

In September 1793, the Reign of Terror began. Under the intervention of Antoine Lavoisier, who himself was by then already thrown out of the academy along with many other scholars, Lagrange was specifically exempted by name in the decree of October 1793 that ordered all foreigners to leave France. On 4 May 1794, Lavoisier and 27 other tax farmers were arrested and sentenced to death and guillotined on the afternoon after the trial. Lagrange said on the death of Lavoisier:

: &quot;It took only a moment to cause this head to fall and a hundred years will not suffice to produce its like.&quot;

Though Lagrange had been preparing to escape from France while there was yet time, he was never in any danger; different revolutionary governments (and at a later time, Napoleon) gave him honours and distinctions. This luckiness or safety may to some extent be due to his life attitude he expressed many years before: &quot;I believe that, in general, one of the first principles of every wise man is to conform strictly to the laws of the country in which he is living, even when they are unreasonable&quot;. A striking testimony to the respect in which he was held was shown in 1796 when the French commissary in Italy was ordered to attend in the full state on Lagrange&#x27;s father and tender the congratulations of the republic on the achievements of his son, who &quot;had done honour to all mankind by his genius, and whom it was the special glory of Piedmont to have produced&quot;. It may be added that Napoleon, when he attained power, warmly encouraged scientific studies in France, and was a liberal benefactor of them. Appointed senator in 1799, he was the first signer of the Sénatus-consulte which in 1802 annexed his fatherland Piedmont to France. He acquired French citizenship in consequence. The French claimed he was a French mathematician, but the Italians continued to claim him as Italian.&quot;

==== Units of measurement ====
Lagrange was involved in the development of the metric system of measurement in the 1790s. He was offered the presidency of the Commission for the reform of weights and measures (&quot;la Commission des Poids et Mesures&quot;) when he was preparing to escape. After Lavoisier&#x27;s death in 1794, it was largely Lagrange who influenced the choice of the metre and kilogram units with decimal subdivision, by the commission of 1799. Lagrange was also one of the founding members of the Bureau des Longitudes in 1795.

==== École Normale ====
In 1795, Lagrange was appointed to a mathematical chair at the newly established École Normale, which enjoyed only a short existence of four months. His lectures there were elementary; they contain nothing of any mathematical importance, though they do provide a brief historical insight into his reason for proposing undecimal or Base 11 as the base number for the reformed system of weights and measures. The lectures were published because the professors had to &quot;pledge themselves to the representatives of the people and to each other neither to read nor to repeat from memory&quot; [&quot;Les professeurs aux Écoles Normales ont pris, avec les Représentants du Peuple, et entr&#x27;eux l&#x27;engagement de ne point lire ou débiter de mémoire des discours écrits&quot;]. The discourses were ordered and taken down in shorthand to enable the deputies to see how the professors acquitted themselves. It was also thought the published lectures would interest a significant portion of the citizenry [&quot;Quoique des feuilles sténographiques soient essentiellement destinées aux élèves de l&#x27;École Normale, on doit prévoir quיelles seront lues par une grande partie de la Nation&quot;].

==== École Polytechnique ====
In 1794, Lagrange was appointed professor of the École Polytechnique; and his lectures there, described by mathematicians who had the good fortune to be able to attend them, were almost perfect both in form and matter. Beginning with the merest elements, he led his hearers on until, almost unknown to themselves, they were themselves extending the bounds of the subject: above all he impressed on his pupils the advantage of always using general methods expressed in a symmetrical notation.

However, Lagrange does not seem to have been a successful teacher. Fourier, who attended his lectures in 1795, wrote:
:his voice is very feeble, at least in that he does not become heated; he has a very marked Italian accent and pronounces the &quot;s&quot; like &quot;z&quot; [...] The students, of whom the majority are incapable of appreciating him, give him little welcome, but the &quot;professeurs&quot; make amends for it.

==== Late years ====

In 1810, Lagrange started a thorough revision of the &quot;Mécanique analytique&quot;, but he was able to complete only about two-thirds of it before his death in Paris in 1813, in 128 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. Napoleon honoured him with the Grand Croix of the Ordre Impérial de la Réunion just two days before he died. He was buried that same year in the Panthéon in Paris. The inscription on his tomb reads in translation:JOSEPH LOUIS LAGRANGE. Senator. Count of the Empire. Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour. Grand Cross of the Imperial Order of the Reunion. Member of the Institute and the Bureau of Longitude. Born in Turin on 25 January 1736. Died in Paris on 10 April 1813.

==Work in Berlin==
Lagrange was extremely active scientifically during the twenty years he spent in Berlin. Not only did he produce his &quot;Mécanique analytique&quot;, but he contributed between one and two hundred papers to the Academy of Turin, the Berlin Academy, and the French Academy. Some of these are really treatises, and all without exception are of a high order of excellence. Except for a short time when he was ill he produced on average about one paper a month. Of these, note the following as amongst the most important.

First, his contributions to the fourth and fifth volumes, 1766–1773, of the &quot;Miscellanea Taurinensia&quot;; of which the most important was the one in 1771, in which he discussed how numerous astronomical observations should be combined so as to give the most probable result. And later, his contributions to the first two volumes, 1784–1785, of the transactions of the Turin Academy; to the first of which he contributed a paper on the pressure exerted by fluids in motion, and to the second an article on integration by infinite series, and the kind of problems for which it is suitable.

Most of the papers sent to Paris were on astronomical questions, and among these, including his paper on the Jovian system in 1766, his essay on the problem of three bodies in 1772, his work on the secular equation of the Moon in 1773, and his treatise on cometary perturbations in 1778. These were all written on subjects proposed by the Académie française, and in each case, the prize was awarded to him.

===Lagrangian mechanics===

Between 1772 and 1788, Lagrange re-formulated Classical/Newtonian mechanics to simplify formulas and ease calculations. These mechanics are called Lagrangian mechanics.

===Algebra===
The greater number of his papers during this time were, however, contributed to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. Several of them deal with questions in algebra.

*His discussion of representations of integers by quadratic forms (1769) and by more general algebraic forms (1770).
*His tract on the Theory of Elimination, 1770.
*Lagrange&#x27;s theorem that the order of a subgroup H of a group G must divide the order of G.
*His papers of 1770 and 1771 on the general process for solving an algebraic equation of any degree via the &quot;Lagrange resolvents&quot;. This method fails to give a general formula for solutions of an equation of degree five and higher because the auxiliary equation involved has a higher degree than the original one. The significance of this method is that it exhibits the already known formulas for solving equations of second, third, and fourth degrees as manifestations of a single principle, and was foundational in Galois theory. The complete solution of a binomial equation (namely an equation of the form formula_2 ± formula_3) is also treated in these papers.
*In 1773, Lagrange considered a functional determinant of order 3, a special case of a Jacobian. He also proved the expression for the volume of a tetrahedron with one of the vertices at the origin as the one-sixth of the absolute value of the determinant formed by the coordinates of the other three vertices.

===Number theory===
Several of his early papers also deal with questions of number theory.

*Lagrange (1766–1769) was the first European to prove that Pell&#x27;s equation has a nontrivial solution in the integers for any non-square natural number .
*He proved the theorem, stated by Bachet without justification, that every positive integer is the sum of four squares, 1770.
*He proved Wilson&#x27;s theorem that (for any integer ): is a prime if and only if is a multiple of , 1771.
*His papers of 1773, 1775, and 1777 gave demonstrations of several results enunciated by Fermat, and not previously proved.
*His Recherches d&#x27;Arithmétique of 1775 developed a general theory of binary quadratic forms to handle the general problem of when an integer is representable by the form .
*He made contributions to the theory of continued fractions.

===Other mathematical work===
There are also numerous articles on various points of analytical geometry. In two of them, written rather later, in 1792 and 1793, he reduced the equations of the quadrics (or conicoids) to their canonical forms.

During the years from 1772 to 1785, he contributed a long series of papers which created the science of partial differential equations. A large part of these results was collected in the second edition of Euler&#x27;s integral calculus which was published in 1794.

===Astronomy===
Lastly, there are numerous papers on problems in astronomy. Of these the most important are the following:

*Attempting to solve the general three-body problem, with the consequent discovery of the two constant-pattern solutions, collinear and equilateral, 1772. Those solutions were later seen to explain what are now known as the Lagrangian points. 
*On the attraction of ellipsoids, 1773: this is founded on Maclaurin&#x27;s work.
*On the secular equation of the Moon, 1773; also noticeable for the earliest introduction of the idea of the potential. The potential of a body at any point is the sum of the mass of every element of the body when divided by its distance from the point. Lagrange showed that if the potential of a body at an external point were known, the attraction in any direction could be at once found. The theory of the potential was elaborated in a paper sent to Berlin in 1777.
*On the motion of the nodes of a planet&#x27;s orbit, 1774.
*On the stability of the planetary orbits, 1776.
*Two papers in which the method of determining the orbit of a comet from three observations is completely worked out, 1778 and 1783: this has not indeed proved practically available, but his system of calculating the perturbations by means of mechanical quadratures has formed the basis of most subsequent researches on the subject.
*His determination of the secular and periodic variations of the elements of the planets, 1781–1784: the upper limits assigned for these agree closely with those obtained later by Le Verrier, and Lagrange proceeded as far as the knowledge then possessed of the masses of the planets permitted.
*Three papers on the method of interpolation, 1783, 1792 and 1793: the part of finite differences dealing therewith is now in the same stage as that in which Lagrange left it.

===Fundamental treatise===
Over and above these various papers he composed his fundamental treatise, the &quot;Mécanique analytique&quot;.

In this book, he lays down the law of virtual work, and from that one fundamental principle, by the aid of the calculus of variations, deduces the whole of mechanics, both of solids and fluids.

The object of the book is to show that the subject is implicitly included in a single principle, and to give general formulae from which any particular result can be obtained. The method of generalised co-ordinates by which he obtained this result is perhaps the most brilliant result of his analysis. Instead of following the motion of each individual part of a material system, as D&#x27;Alembert and Euler had done, he showed that, if we determine its configuration by a sufficient number of variables &quot;x&quot;, called generalized coordinates, whose number is the same as that of the degrees of freedom possessed by the system, then the kinetic and potential energies of the system can be expressed in terms of those variables, and the differential equations of motion thence deduced by simple differentiation. For example, in dynamics of a rigid system he replaces the consideration of the particular problem by the general equation, which is now usually written in the form

:formula_4
where &quot;T&quot; represents the kinetic energy and &quot;V&quot; represents the potential energy of the system.
He then presented what we now know as the method of Lagrange multipliers—though this is not the first time that method was published—as a means to solve this equation.
Amongst other minor theorems here given it may suffice to mention the proposition that the kinetic energy imparted by the given impulses to a material system under given constraints is a maximum, and the principle of least action. All the analysis is so elegant that Sir William Rowan Hamilton said the work could be described only as a scientific poem. Lagrange remarked that mechanics was really a branch of pure mathematics analogous to a geometry of four dimensions, namely, the time and the three coordinates of the point in space; and it is said that he prided himself that from the beginning to the end of the work there was not a single diagram. At first no printer could be found who would publish the book; but Legendre at last persuaded a Paris firm to undertake it, and it was issued under the supervision of Laplace, Cousin, Legendre (editor) and Condorcet in 1788.

==Work in France==
=== Differential calculus and calculus of variations ===

Lagrange&#x27;s lectures on the differential calculus at École Polytechnique form the basis of his treatise &quot;Théorie des fonctions analytiques&quot;, which was published in 1797. This work is the extension of an idea contained in a paper he had sent to the Berlin papers in 1772, and its object is to substitute for the differential calculus a group of theorems based on the development of algebraic functions in series, relying in particular on the principle of the generality of algebra.

A somewhat similar method had been previously used by John Landen in the &quot;Residual Analysis&quot;, published in London in 1758. Lagrange believed that he could thus get rid of those difficulties, connected with the use of infinitely large and infinitely small quantities, to which philosophers objected in the usual treatment of the differential calculus. The book is divided into three parts: of these, the first treats of the general theory of functions, and gives an algebraic proof of Taylor&#x27;s theorem, the validity of which is, however, open to question; the second deals with applications to geometry; and the third with applications to mechanics.

Another treatise on the same lines was his &quot;Leçons sur le calcul des fonctions&quot;, issued in 1804, with the second edition in 1806. It is in this book that Lagrange formulated his celebrated method of Lagrange multipliers, in the context of problems of variational calculus with integral constraints. These works devoted to differential calculus and calculus of variations may be considered as the starting point for the researches of Cauchy, Jacobi, and Weierstrass.

===Infinitesimals===
At a later period Lagrange fully embraced the use of infinitesimals in preference to founding the differential calculus on the study of algebraic forms; and in the preface to the second edition of the &quot;Mécanique Analytique&quot;, which was issued in 1811, he justifies the employment of infinitesimals, and concludes by saying that:

: &quot;When we have grasped the spirit of the infinitesimal method, and have verified the exactness of its results either by the geometrical method of prime and ultimate ratios, or by the analytical method of derived functions, we may employ infinitely small quantities as a sure and valuable means of shortening and simplifying our proofs.&quot;

===Number theory===
His &quot;Résolution des équations numériques&quot;, published in 1798, was also the fruit of his lectures at École Polytechnique. There he gives the method of approximating the real roots of an equation by means of continued fractions, and enunciates several other theorems. In a note at the end, he shows how Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, that is

: formula_5

where &quot;p&quot; is a prime and &quot;a&quot; is prime to &quot;p&quot;, may be applied to give the complete algebraic solution of any binomial equation. He also here explains how the equation whose roots are the squares of the differences of the roots of the original equation may be used so as to give considerable information as to the position and nature of those roots.

===Celestial mechanics===
A theory of the planetary motions had formed the subject of some of the most remarkable of Lagrange&#x27;s Berlin papers. In 1806 the subject was reopened by Poisson, who, in a paper read before the French Academy, showed that Lagrange&#x27;s formulae led to certain limits for the stability of the orbits. Lagrange, who was present, now discussed the whole subject afresh, and in a letter communicated to the academy in 1808 explained how, by the variation of arbitrary constants, the periodical and secular inequalities of any system of mutually interacting bodies could be determined.

==Prizes and distinctions==
Euler proposed Lagrange for election to the Berlin Academy and he was elected on 2 September 1756. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1790, a Fellow of the Royal Society and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1806. In 1808, Napoleon made Lagrange a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour and a Count of the Empire. He was awarded the Grand Croix of the Ordre Impérial de la Réunion in 1813, a week before his death in Paris, and was buried in the Panthéon, a mausoleum dedicated to the most honoured French people.

Lagrange was awarded the 1764 prize of the French Academy of Sciences for his memoir on the libration of the Moon. In 1766 the academy proposed a problem of the motion of the satellites of Jupiter, and the prize again was awarded to Lagrange. He also shared or won the prizes of 1772, 1774, and 1778.

Lagrange is one of the 72 prominent French scientists who were commemorated on plaques at the first stage of the Eiffel Tower when it first opened. &quot;Rue Lagrange&quot; in the 5th Arrondissement in Paris is named after him. In Turin, the street where the house of his birth still stands is named &quot;via Lagrange&quot;. The lunar crater Lagrange and the asteroid 1006 Lagrangea also bear his name.

<text>Wilhelm Heinrich Immanuel Bleek (8 March 1827 – 17 August 1875) was a German linguist. His work included &quot;A Comparative Grammar of South African Languages&quot; and his great project jointly executed with Lucy Lloyd: The Bleek and Lloyd Archive of ǀxam and !kun texts. A short form of this eventually reached press with &quot;Specimens of Bushman Folklore&quot;, which Laurens van der Post drew on heavily.

==Biography==

Wilhelm Heinrich Immanuel Bleek was born in Berlin on 8 March 1827. He was the eldest son of Friedrich Bleek, Professor of Theology at Berlin University and then at the University of Bonn, and Augusta Charlotte Marianne Henriette Sethe. He graduated from the University of Bonn in 1851 with a doctorate in linguistics, after a period in Berlin where he went to study Hebrew and where he first became interested in African languages. Bleek&#x27;s thesis featured an attempt to link North African and Khoikhoi (or what were then called Hottentot) languages – the thinking at the time being that all African languages were connected. After graduating in Bonn, Bleek returned to Berlin and worked with a zoologist, Dr Wilhelm K H Peters, editing vocabularies of East African languages. His interest in African languages was further developed during 1852 and 1853 by learning Egyptian Arabic from Professor Karl Richard Lepsius, whom he met in Berlin in 1852.

Bleek was appointed official linguist to Dr William Balfour Baikie&#x27;s Niger Tshadda Expedition in 1854. Ill-health (a tropical fever) forced his return to England where he met George Grey and John William Colenso, the Anglican Bishop of Natal, who invited Bleek to join him in Natal in 1855 to help compile a Zulu grammar. After completing Colenso&#x27;s project, Bleek travelled to Cape Town in 1856 to become Sir George Grey&#x27;s official interpreter as well as to catalogue his private library. Grey had philological interests and was Bleek&#x27;s patron during his time as Governor of the Cape. The two had a good professional and personal relationship based on an admiration that appears to have been mutual. Bleek was widely respected as a philologist, particularly in the Cape. While working for Grey he continued with his philological research and contributed to various publications during the late 1850s. Bleek requested examples of African literature from missionaries and travellers, such as the Revd W Kronlein who provided Bleek with Namaqua texts in 1861.

In 1859 Bleek briefly returned to Europe in an effort to improve his poor health but returned to the Cape and his research soon after. In 1861 Bleek met his future wife, Jemima Lloyd, at the boarding house where he lived in Cape Town (run by a Mrs Roesch), while she was waiting for a passage to England, and they developed a relationship through correspondence. She returned to Cape Town from England the following year.

Bleek married Jemima Lloyd on 22 November 1862. The Bleeks first lived at The Hill in Mowbray but moved in 1875 to Charlton House. Jemima&#x27;s sister, Lucy Lloyd, joined the household, became his colleague, and carried on his work after his death.

When Grey was appointed Governor of New Zealand, he presented his collection to the National Library of South Africa on condition that Bleek be its curator, a position he occupied from 1862 until his death in 1875. In addition to this work, Bleek supported himself and his family by writing regularly for &quot;Het Volksblad&quot; throughout the 1860s and publishing the first part of his &quot;A Comparative Grammar of South African Languages&quot; in London in 1862. The second part was also published in London in 1869 with the first chapter appearing in manuscript form in Cape Town in 1865. Unfortunately, much of Bleek&#x27;s working life in the Cape, like that of his sister-in-law after him, was characterised by extreme financial hardship which made his research even more difficult to continue with.

===San people (Bushmen)===

Bleek&#x27;s first contact with San people (Bushmen) was with prisoners at Robben Island and the Cape Town Gaol and House of Correction, in 1857. He conducted interviews with a few of these prisoners, which he used in later publications. These people all came from the Burgersdorp and Colesberg regions and spoke variations of one similar-sounding &quot;Bushman&quot; language. Bleek was particularly keen to learn more about this &quot;Bushman&quot; language and compare it to examples of &quot;Bushman&quot; vocabulary and language earlier noted by Hinrich Lichtenstein and obtained from missionaries at the turn of the 19th century.

In 1863 resident magistrate Louis Anthing introduced the first ǀXam-speakers to Bleek. He brought three men to Cape Town from the Kenhardt district to stand trial for attacks on farmers (the prosecution was eventually waived by the Attorney General). In 1866 two San prisoners from the Achterveldt near Calvinia were transferred from the Breakwater prison to the Cape Town prison, making it easier for Bleek to meet them. With their help, Bleek compiled a list of words and sentences and an alphabetical vocabulary. Most of these words and sentences were provided by Adam Kleinhardt (see Bleek I-1, UCT A1.4.1).

In 1870 Bleek and Lloyd, by now working together on the project to learn &quot;Bushman&quot; language and record personal narratives and folklore, became aware of the presence of a group of 28 ǀXam prisoners (San from the central interior of southern Africa) at the Breakwater Convict Station and received permission to relocate one prisoner to their home in Mowbray so as to learn his language. The prison chaplain, Revd Fisk, was in charge of the selection of this individual – a young man named |a!kunta. But because of his youth, |a!kunta was unfamiliar with much of his people&#x27;s folklore and an older man named ||kabbo was then permitted to accompany him. ||kabbo became Bleek and Lloyd&#x27;s first real teacher, a title by which he later regarded himself. Over time, members of ||kabbo&#x27;s family and other families lived with Bleek and Lloyd in Mowbray, and were interviewed by them. Amongst the people interviewed by Bleek was !Kweiten-ta-Ken. Many of the |Xam-speakers interviewed by Bleek and Lloyd were related to one another. Bleek and Lloyd learned and wrote down their language, first as lists of words and phrases and then as stories and narratives about their lives, history, folklore and remembered beliefs and customs.

Bleek, along with Lloyd, made an effort to record as much anthropological and ethnographic information as possible. This included genealogies, places of origin, and the customs and daily life of the informants. Photographs and measurements (some as specified by Thomas Huxley&#x27;s global ethnographic project, see Godby 1996) were also taken of all their informants in accordance with the norms of scientific research of the time in those fields. More intimate and personal painted portraits were also commissioned of some of the Xam teachers.

Although Bleek and Lloyd interviewed other individuals during 1875 and 1876 (Lloyd doing this alone after Bleek&#x27;s death), most of their time was spent interviewing only six individual |Xam contributors. Bleek wrote a series of reports on the language and the literature and folklore of the |xam-speakers he interviewed, which he sent to the Cape Secretary for Native Affairs. This was first in an attempt to gain funding to continue with his studies and then also to make Her Majesty&#x27;s Colonial Government aware of the need to preserve San folklore as an important part of the nation&#x27;s heritage and traditions. In this endeavour Bleek must surely have been influenced by Louis Anthing.

===Death===

Bleek died in Mowbray on 17 August 1875, aged 48, and was buried in Wynberg Anglican cemetery in Cape Town along with his two infant children, who had died before him. His all-important work recording the |Xam language and literature was continued and expanded by Lucy Lloyd, fully supported by his wife Jemima. In his obituary in the South African Mail of 25 August 1875, he was lauded in the following terms: &#x27;As a comparative philologist he stood in the foremost rank, and as an investigator and authority on the South African languages, he was without peer.

<text>In classical antiquity, the cornucopia (; ), also called the horn of plenty, was a symbol of abundance and nourishment, commonly a large horn-shaped container overflowing with produce, flowers, or nuts. In Greek, it was called the &quot;horn of Amalthea&quot; (), after Amalthea, a nurse of Zeus, who is often part of stories of the horn&#x27;s origin.

Baskets or panniers of this form were traditionally used in western Asia and Europe to hold and carry newly harvested food products. The horn-shaped basket would be worn on the back or slung around the torso, leaving the harvester&#x27;s hands free for picking.

==In Greek/Roman mythology==

Mythology offers multiple explanations of the origin of the cornucopia. One of the best-known involves the birth and nurturance of the infant Zeus, who had to be hidden from his devouring father Cronus. In a cave on Mount Ida on the island of Crete, baby Zeus was cared for and protected by a number of divine attendants, including the goat Amalthea (&quot;Nourishing Goddess&quot;), who fed him with her milk. The suckling future king of the gods had unusual abilities and strength, and in playing with his nursemaid accidentally broke off one of her horns, which then had the divine power to provide unending nourishment, as the foster mother had to the god.

In another myth, the cornucopia was created when Heracles (Roman Hercules) wrestled with the river god Achelous and ripped off one of his horns; river gods were sometimes depicted as horned. This version is represented in the &quot;Achelous and Hercules&quot; mural painting by the American Regionalist artist Thomas Hart Benton.

The cornucopia became the attribute of several Greek and Roman deities, particularly those associated with the harvest, prosperity, or spiritual abundance, such as personifications of Earth (Gaia or Terra); the child Plutus, god of riches and son of the grain goddess Demeter; the nymph Maia; and Fortuna, the goddess of luck, who had the power to grant prosperity. In Roman Imperial cult, abstract Roman deities who fostered peace &quot;(pax Romana)&quot; and prosperity were also depicted with a cornucopia, including Abundantia, &quot;Abundance&quot; personified, and Annona, goddess of the grain supply to the city of Rome. Hades, the classical ruler of the underworld in the mystery religions, was a giver of agricultural, mineral and spiritual wealth, and in art often holds a cornucopia.&#x27;

== Modern depictions ==

In modern depictions, the cornucopia is typically a hollow, horn-shaped wicker basket filled with various kinds of festive fruit and vegetables. In most of North America, the cornucopia has come to be associated with Thanksgiving and the harvest. Cornucopia is also the name of the annual November Food and Wine celebration in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. Two cornucopias are seen in the flag and state seal of Idaho. The Great Seal of North Carolina depicts Liberty standing and Plenty holding a cornucopia. The coats of arms of Colombia, Panama, Peru, Venezuela, Victoria, Australia and Kharkiv, Ukraine, also feature the cornucopia, symbolizing prosperity.

Cornucopia motifs appear in some modern literature, such as Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Wintersmith&quot; and Suzanne Collins&#x27;s &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;.

The horn of plenty is used for body art and at Thanksgiving, as it is a symbol of fertility, fortune and abundance.

<doc id="87812" wikidata="Q33368" url="?curid=87812" title="Luganda">
<text>Ganda or Luganda ( ; ) is a Bantu language spoken in the African Great Lakes region. It is one of the major languages in Uganda and is spoken by more than 5.56 million Baganda and other people principally in central Uganda, including the country&#x27;s capital, Kampala. Typologically, it is an agglutinative, tonal language with subject–verb–object word order and nominative–accusative morphosyntactic alignment.

With at least 5.6 million first-language speakers in the Buganda region and 5.4 million second language speakers fluent elsewhere in different regions especially in major urban areas like Mbale, Tororo, Jinja, Gulu, Mbarara, Hoima, Kasese etc. Luganda is Uganda&#x27;s de facto language of national identity as it is the most widely spoken Ugandan language used mostly in trade in urban areas. The language is also the most-spoken unofficial language in Rwanda&#x27;s capital Kigali. As a second language, it follows English and precedes Swahili in Uganda.

Lusoga, the language spoken in Busoga to the east of Buganda, is very closely related to Luganda. The two languages are almost mutually intelligible, and have an estimated lexical similarity of between 82% and 86%.
== History ==
Luganda, a Bantu language, shares its roots with other Bantu languages spoken in the African Great Lakes region. Its specific origins remain a subject of scholarly debate, but it&#x27;s generally accepted that it evolved from Proto-Bantu, the ancestral language of all Bantu languages.
During the 18th -19th century, due to interaction with foreign communities, Luganda borrowed a number of loan words from the incoming peoples (Arab traders, missionaries and colonialists), mostly for things that were inexistent in the land, such as a number of words from Arabic like chai from Arabic shay (tea), ddiini (religion), ssala (prayer), and from English, for example ssaati (shirt) or emotoka (car). 

== Phonology ==
A notable feature of Luganda phonology is its geminate consonants and distinctions between long and short vowels. Speakers generally consider consonantal gemination and vowel lengthening to be two manifestations of the same effect, which they call simply &quot;doubling&quot; or &quot;stressing&quot;.

Luganda is also a tonal language; the change in the pitch of a syllable can change the meaning of a word. For example, the word means &#x27;king&#x27; if all three syllables are given the same pitch. If the first syllable is high then the meaning changes to &#x27;the little one catches&#x27; (third person singular present tense Class VI - of - &#x27;to catch&#x27;). This feature makes Luganda a difficult language for speakers of non-tonal languages to learn. A non-native speaker has to learn the variations of pitch by prolonged listening.

Unlike some other Bantu languages, there is no tendency in Luganda for penultimate vowels to become long; in fact they are very frequently short, as in the city name Kampala , pronounced , in which the second vowel is short in Luganda.

=== Vowels ===

All five vowels have two forms: long and short. The distinction is phonemic but can occur only in certain positions. After two consonants, the latter being a semivowel, all vowels are long. The quality of a vowel is not affected by its length.

Long vowels in Luganda are very long, more than twice the length of a short vowel. A vowel before a prenasalised consonant, as in &#x27;Buganda&#x27; is also lengthened, although it is not as long as a long vowel; laboratory measurements show that the vowel + nasal takes the same length of time to say as a long vowel. Before a geminate, all vowels are short. A segment such as , where a short vowel is followed by a geminate consonant, is very slightly shorter than or .

=== Consonants ===
The table below gives the consonant set of Luganda, grouping voiceless and voiced consonants together in a cell where appropriate, in that order.

Apart from , all these consonants can be geminated, even at the start of a word: &#x27;two&#x27;, &quot;&quot; &#x27;cold&#x27;. The approximants and are geminated as and : &#x27;country&#x27;; &#x27;cricket&#x27;—from the roots - and - respectively, with the singular noun prefix - that doubles the following consonant.

Historically, geminated consonants appear to have arisen when a very close between two consonants dropped out; for example - from *- &#x27;run&#x27;.

Apart from , and , all consonants can also be prenasalised (prefixed with a nasal stop). This consonant will be , , or according to the place of articulation of the consonant which follows, and belongs to the same syllable as that consonant.

The liquid becomes when geminated or prenasalised. For example, &#x27;I see&#x27; (from the root - with the subject prefix -); &#x27;leaf&#x27; (from the root - with the singular noun prefix -, which doubles the following consonant).

A consonant cannot be both geminated and prenasalised. When morphological processes require this, the gemination is dropped and the syllable is inserted, which can then be prenasalised. For example, when the prefix - is added to the adjective - &#x27;black&#x27; the result is .

The nasals , , and can be syllabic at the start of a word: (or ) &#x27;monkey&#x27;, &#x27;I give&#x27;, or &#x27;I explain&#x27;. Note that this last example can be analysed in two ways, reflecting the fact that there is no distinction between prenasalisation and gemination when applied to nasal stops.

===Tone===
Luganda is a tonal language, with three tones: high (), low () and falling (). There are, however, no syllables in Luganda with rising tone , since these automatically become .

There are various types of tones: (a) lexical tones, which are always present in a word, e.g. &#x27;city&#x27;; (b) phrasal tones, which are automatically added to a word in certain contexts, but which are absent in other contexts (e.g. or &#x27;book&#x27;); (c) plateaux tones, where the pitch remains high between two lexical tones, e.g. &#x27;it is in Uganda&#x27;; (d) grammatical tones, which are associated with certain tenses or uses of the verb; (e) boundary tones, which affect the last syllable of a word or phrase and can indicate such things as interrogation.

According to one analysis, tones are carried on morae. In Luganda, a short vowel has one mora and a long vowel has two morae. A geminate or prenasalised consonant has one mora. A consonant + semivowel (e.g. or ) also has one mora. A vowel followed by a prenasalised consonant has two morae &quot;including&quot; the one belonging to the prenasalised consonant. The initial vowel of words like &#x27;book&#x27; is considered to have one mora, even though such vowels are often pronounced long. No syllable can have more than two morae.

Falling tones can be heard in syllables which have two morae, e.g. those with a long vowel ( &#x27;to cry&#x27;), those with a short vowel followed by a geminate consonant ( &#x27;to throb&#x27;), those with a vowel followed by a prenasalised consonant ( &#x27;Baganda people&#x27;), and those following a consonant plus semivowel ( &#x27;to fall sick&#x27;). They can also be heard on final vowels, e.g. &#x27;country&#x27;.

Words in Luganda commonly belong to one of three patterns (other patterns are less common): (a) without lexical tone, e.g. &#x27;book&#x27;; (b) with one high lexical tone, e.g. &#x27;city&#x27;; (c) with two high lexical tones, e.g. which link together to make HHH, i.e. or . At the end of a sentence, a final lexical tone becomes a falling tone, i.e. [Kámpálâ], but in other contexts, e.g. when the word is used as the subject of a sentence, it remains high: &#x27;Kampala is a city&#x27;.

Although words like are theoretically toneless, they are generally subject to a tone-raising rule whereby all but the first mora automatically acquire a high tone. Thus &#x27;book&#x27; is usually pronounced and &#x27;school&#x27; is pronounced (where the long consonant counts as the first mora). These tones automatically added to toneless words are called &#x27;phrasal tones&#x27;. The tone-raising rule also applies to the toneless syllables at the end of words like &#x27;hospital&#x27; and &#x27;we are going&#x27;, provided that there is at least one low-toned mora after the lexical tone. When this happens, the high tones which follow the low tone are slightly lower than the one which precedes it.

However, there are certain contexts, such as when a toneless word is used as the subject of a sentence or before a numeral, when this tone-raising rule does not apply: &#x27;Masindi is a city&#x27;; &#x27;ten books&#x27;.

In a sentence, the lexical tones (that is, the high tones of individual words) tend to fall gradually in a series of steps from high to low. For example, in the sentence &#x27;it is the chief city in Uganda&#x27;, the lexical high tones of the syllables , and stand out and gradually descend in pitch, the toneless syllables in between being lower. This phenomenon is called &#x27;downdrift&#x27;.

However, there are certain types of phrase, notably those in the form &#x27;noun + of + noun&#x27;, or &#x27;verb + location&#x27;, where downdrift does not occur, and instead all the syllables in between the two lexical high tones link together into a &#x27;tonal plateau&#x27;, in which all the vowels have tones of equal height, for example &#x27;in the south of Uganda&#x27; or &#x27;it is in Uganda&#x27;. Plateauing also occurs within a word, as in (see above).

A plateau cannot be formed between a lexical tone and a following phrasal tone; so in the sentence &#x27;it is in Bunyoro&#x27; there is downdrift, since the tones of are phrasal. But a phrasal tone can and frequently does form a plateau with a following lexical tone or phrasal tone. So in &#x27;people in Uganda&#x27;, there is a plateau from the phrasal tone of to the lexical tone of , and in &#x27;we are going into the street&#x27;, there is a plateau from the phrasal tone of to the phrasal tone of . Again there are certain exceptions; for example, there is no plateau before the words &#x27;this&#x27; or &#x27;all&#x27;: &#x27;this person&#x27;, &#x27;all the people&#x27;.

Prefixes sometimes change the tones in a word. For example, &#x27;they are Baganda&#x27; has LHHL, but adding the initial vowel gives &#x27;Baganda people&#x27; with a falling tone on &quot;ga&quot; and phrasal tone on the final syllable.

Different verb tenses have different tonal patterns. The tones of verbs are made more complicated by the fact that some verbs have a high lexical tone on the first syllable of the root, while others do not, and also by the fact that the sequence HH generally becomes HL by a rule called Meeussen&#x27;s rule. Thus means &#x27;he reads&#x27;, but when the toneless prefix &#x27;he/she&#x27; is replaced by the high-toned prefix &#x27;they&#x27;, instead of it becomes &#x27;they read&#x27;. The tones of verbs in relative clauses and in negative sentences differ from those in ordinary positive sentences and the addition of an object-marker such as &#x27;him&#x27; adds further complications.

In addition to lexical tones, phrasal tones, and the tonal patterns of tenses, there are also intonational tones in Luganda, for example, tones of questions. One rather unexpected phenomenon for English speakers is that if a yes–no question ends in a toneless word, instead of a rise, there is a sharp drop in pitch, e.g. &#x27;is this a road?&#x27;.

=== Phonotactics ===
Syllables can take any of the following forms:
* V (only as the first syllable of a word)
* CV
* GV
* NCV
* CSV
* GSV
* NCSV
where V = vowel, C = single consonant (including nasals and semivowels but excluding geminates), G = geminate consonant, N = nasal stop, S = semivowel

These forms are subject to certain phonotactic restrictions:
* Two vowels may not appear adjacent to one another. When morphological or grammatical rules cause two vowels to meet, the first vowel is elided or reduced to a semivowel and the second is lengthened if possible.
* A vowel following a consonant–semivowel combination (except ) is always long, except at the end of a word. After a vowel can be either long or short. At the end of a word, all vowels are pronounced short.
* A vowel followed by a nasal–plosive combination is always long.
* A vowel followed by a geminate is always short. This rule takes precedence over all the above rules.
* The velar plosives and may not appear before the vowel or the semivowel . In this position they become the corresponding postalveolar affricates and respectively.
* The consonants , and cannot be geminated or prenasalised.
* A consonant cannot be both geminated and prenasalised.

The net effect of this is that all Luganda words follow the general pattern of alternating consonant clusters and vowels, beginning with either but always ending in a vowel:
* (V)XVXV...XV
where V = vowel, X = consonant cluster, (V) = optional vowel

This is reflected in the syllabification rule that in writing, words are always hyphenated after a vowel (when breaking a word over two lines). For example, &#x27;My car has arrived&#x27; would be split into syllables as .

=== Variant pronunciations ===
The palatal plosives and may be realised with some affrication — either as and or as postalveolars and respectively.

In speech, word-final vowels are often elided in these conditioning environments:
* Word-final can be silent after , , or 
* Word-final can be silent after , , or 

For example, &#x27;black&#x27; may be pronounced or . Similarly &#x27;why&#x27; may be pronounced , or .

Long vowels before prenasalised fricatives (that is, before , , or ) may be nasalised, and the nasal is then often elided. Additionally, when not elided (for example phrase-initially), the usually becomes a labiodental in , . For example:
* &#x27;I&#x27;m dying&#x27; is pronounced 
* &#x27;seven&#x27; may be pronounced , , or 
* &#x27;don&#x27;t ask me&#x27; may be pronounced , or 

The liquid has two allophones and , conditioned by the preceding vowel. It is usually realised as a tap or flap after a front unrounded vowel (&quot;i.e.&quot; after , , or ), and as a lateral approximant elsewhere. However, there is considerable variation in this, and using one allophone instead of the other causes no ambiguity. So &#x27;why&#x27; may also be pronounced , , &quot;etc&quot;.

=== Alternative analysis ===
Treating the geminate and prenasalised consonants as separate phonemes yields the expanded consonant set below:
This simplifies the phonotactic rules so that all syllables are of one of three forms:
* V (only as the first syllable of a word)
* CV
* CSV
where V = vowel, C = consonant (including geminate and prenasalised consonants), N = nasal stop, S = semivowel (&quot;i.e.&quot; either or ).

Vowel length is then only distinctive before simple consonants (&quot;i.e.&quot; simple plosives, simple fricatives, simple nasals, approximants and liquids)—not before geminate or nasalised consonants or at the end of a word.

== Orthography ==

Luganda spelling, which has been standardized since 1947, uses a Latin alphabet, augmented with one new letter and a digraph , which is treated as a single letter. It has a very high sound-to-letter correspondence: one letter usually represents one sound and vice versa.

The distinction between simple and geminate consonants is always represented explicitly: simple consonants are written single, and geminates are written double. The distinction between long and short vowels is always made clear from the spelling but not always explicitly: short vowels are always written single; long vowels are written double only if their length cannot be inferred from the context. Stress and tones are not represented in the spelling.

The following phonemes are always represented with the same letter or combination of letters:
* Short vowels (always spelt , , , , )
* All consonants apart from , and 
* The palatals and , when followed by a short vowel (always spelt , ), except when the short vowel is itself followed by a geminate consonant, or when the vowel is 

The following phonemes can be represented with two letters or combinations of letters, with the alternation predictable from the context:
* Long vowels (spelt , , , , where short vowels are impossible; , , , , elsewhere)
* The liquid (spelt after or ; elsewhere)

The following phonemes can be represented with two letters or combinations of letters, with unpredictable alternation between the two:
* The palatals and , when followed by a long vowel, or by a short vowel and a geminate consonant, or by an sound ( or ) (spelt with , , with , , or, before , with , ).

It is therefore possible to predict the pronunciation of any word (with the exception of stress and tones) from the spelling. It is also usually possible to predict the spelling of a word from the pronunciation. The only words where this is not possible are those that include one of the affricate–vowel combinations discussed above.

Note, however, that some proper names are not spelled as they are pronounced. For example, is pronounced as though written and is pronounced .

=== Vowels ===

The five vowels in Luganda are spelt with the same letters as in many other languages (for example Spanish):
* 
* 

As mentioned above, the distinction between long and short vowels is phonemic and is therefore represented in the alphabet. Long vowels are written as double (when length cannot be inferred from the context) and short vowels are written single. For example:

* &#x27;four (&quot;e.g.&quot; people)&#x27; vs &#x27;children&#x27;
* &#x27;dance&#x27; vs &#x27;overcharge&#x27;
* &#x27;mingle&#x27; vs &#x27;walk slowly&#x27;
* &#x27;do&#x27; vs &#x27;(to) weed&#x27;
* &#x27;send&#x27; vs &#x27;(to) name&#x27;

In certain contexts, phonotactic constraints mean that a vowel must be long, and in these cases it is not written double:
* A vowel followed by a prenasalised consonant
* A vowel that comes after a consonant–semivowel combination—apart from which can be thought of as a geminated &quot;w&quot;, and which can be thought of as a geminated &quot;y&quot; (although the latter is less common as this combination is more often spelt &quot;jj&quot;)

For example:
* &#x27;metal&#x27;
* &#x27;I go&#x27;
But
* &#x27;court house&#x27;
* &#x27;customs office&#x27;

Vowels at the start or end of the word are not written double, even if they are long. The only exception to this (apart from all-vowel interjections such as and ) is &#x27;yes&#x27;.

=== Consonants ===
With the exception of , each consonant sound in Luganda corresponds to a single letter. The combination is treated as a single letter and therefore does not have any effect on vowel length (see the previous subsection).

The following letters are pronounced approximately as in English:
* (sometimes softened to )
* &quot;d&quot; 
* (&quot;&quot; and &quot; are pronounced with the lips slightly pouted&quot;)
* 
* 
* 
* (&quot;&quot; differs from the English &#x27;w&#x27; being much softer&quot;)
* 

A few letters have unusual values:
* 
* 

The letters and represent the same sound in Luganda——but the orthography requires after or , and elsewhere:
* &#x27;she&#x27;s waiting&#x27;
* (or ) &#x27;she&#x27;s waiting for it&#x27;

There are also two letters whose pronunciation depends on the following letter:
* is pronounced (or ) before or , elsewhere
* is pronounced (or ) before or , elsewhere
Compare this to the pronunciation of and in many Romance languages. As in the Romance languages the &#x27;softening letter&#x27; (in Italian , in French , in Luganda ) is not itself pronounced, although in Luganda it does have the effect of lengthening the following vowel (see the previous subsection).

Finally the sounds and are spelt before another consonant with the same place of articulation (in other words, before other palatals and velars respectively) rather than and :
* The combinations and are spelt 
* The combination is spelt (the diaeresis shows that the is a separate letter rather than part of the digraph, and the is spelt before as in the above rule; in practice this combination is very rare)
* is spelt before or (but not before another )
* is spelt before or , or before a soft or 

=== Alphabet ===

The standard Luganda alphabet is composed of twenty-four letters:
* 18 consonants: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 
* 5 vowels: , , , , 
* 2 semi-vowels: , 

Since the last consonant does not appear on standard typewriters or computer keyboards, it is often replaced by the combination &#x27; (including the apostrophe). In some non-standard orthographies, the apostrophe is not used, which can lead to confusion with the letter combination , which is different from .

In addition, the letter combination is treated as a unique consonant. When the letters and appear next to each other, they are written as , with the diaeresis mark to distinguish this combination from .

Other letters (, , ) are not used in the alphabet, but are often used to write loanwords from other languages. Most such loanwords have standardised spellings consistent with Luganda orthography (and therefore not using these letters), but these spelling are not often used, particularly for English words.

The full alphabet, including both standard Luganda letters and those used only for loanwords, is as follows:
* Aa, 
* Bb, 
* Cc, 
* Dd, 
* Ee, 
* Ff, 
* Gg, 
* (Hh, )
* Ii, 
* Jj, 
* Kk, 
* Ll, 
* Mm, 
* Nn, 
* (NY Ny ny, or ) 
* Ŋŋ, 
* Oo, 
* Pp, 
* (Qq )
* Rr, 
* Ss, 
* Tt, 
* Uu, 
* Vv, 
* Ww, 
* (Xx )
* Yy, 
* Zz, 

== Grammar ==
Like most Bantu languages, Luganda&#x27;s grammar can be said to be &quot;noun-centric&quot;, as most words in a sentence agree with a noun. Agreement is by gender and number and is indicated with prefixes attached to the start of word stems.
The following parts of speech agree with nouns in class and number:
* adjective
* verb (for subject and object roles)
* pronoun
* possessive

===Noun classes===
NB: In the study of Bantu languages the term &quot;noun class&quot; is often used to refer to what is called gender in comparative linguistics and in the study of certain other languages. Hereafter, both terms may be used.

There is some disagreement as to how to count Luganda&#x27;s noun classes. Some authorities count singular and plural forms as two separate noun classes, but others treat the singular-plural pairs as genders. By the former method, there are 17 classes, and by the latter there are 10 since there are two pairs of classes with identical plurals and one class with no singular-plural distinction. The latter method is consistent with the study of non-Bantu languages. Applying the method to Luganda gives ten noun classes, nine of which have separate singular and plural forms. This is the usual way to discuss Luganda but not when discussing Bantu languages, generally. In addition, Luganda has four locative classes, , , , and .

The following table shows how the ten traditional classes of Luganda map onto the Proto-Bantu noun classes:

As the table shows, Proto-Bantu&#x27;s polyplural classes (6 and 10) are treated as separate in this article.

As is the case with most languages, the distribution of nouns among the classes is essentially arbitrary, but there are some loose patterns:
* Class I contains mainly people, although some inanimate nouns can be found in this class: &#x27;man&#x27;, &#x27;coffee&#x27;
* Class II contains all sorts of nouns but most of the concrete nouns in Class II are long or cylindrical. Most trees fall into this class: &#x27;tree&#x27;
* Class III also contains many different types of concepts but most animals fall into this class: &#x27;dog&#x27;
* Class IV contains inanimate objects and is the class used for the impersonal &#x27;it&#x27;: &#x27;book&#x27;
* Class V contains mainly (but not exclusively) large things and liquids, and can also be used to create augmentatives: &#x27;breast&#x27;, &#x27;giant&#x27; (from &#x27;person&#x27;)
* Class VI contains mainly small things and can be used to create diminutives, adjectival abstract nouns and (in the plural) negative verbal nouns and countries: &#x27;puppy&#x27; (from &#x27;dog&#x27;), &#x27;laziness&#x27; (from &#x27;lazy&#x27;), &#x27;inaction, not to do&#x27; (from &#x27;to do, act&#x27;), &#x27;Britain, England&#x27; (from &#x27;British, English person&#x27;)
* Class VII contains many different things including the names of most languages: &#x27;Ganda language&#x27;, &#x27;English language&#x27; (from &#x27;European, white person&#x27;)
* Class VIII is rarely used but can be used to create pejorative forms: &#x27;mutt&#x27; (from &#x27;dog&#x27;)
* Class IX is mainly used for infinitives or affirmative verbal nouns: &#x27;action, to do&#x27; (from the verb &#x27;do, act&#x27;)
* Class X, which has no singular–plural distinction, is used for mass nouns, usually in the sense of &#x27;a drop&#x27; or &#x27;precious little&#x27;: &#x27;drop of water&#x27; (from &#x27;water&#x27;), &#x27;sleep&#x27;

The class that a noun belongs to can usually be determined by its prefix:
* Class I: singular , plural 
* Class II: singular , plural 
* Class III: singular , plural 
* Class IV: singular , plural 
* Class V: singular , , plural 
* Class VI: singular , plural 
* Class VII: singular , plural 
* Class VIII: singular , plural 
* Class IX: singular , plural 
* Class X: 

There are a few cases where prefixes overlap: the singulars of Classes I and II (both beginning with ); the singular of Class III and plurals of Classes III and VII (all beginning with ); and the plurals of Classes V and IX (both ). Genuine ambiguity, however, is rare, since even where the noun prefixes are the same, the other prefixes are often different. For example, there can be no confusion between (Class I) &#x27;person&#x27; and (Class II) &#x27;seat&#x27; in the sentences &#x27;The person is here&#x27; and &#x27;The seat is here&#x27; because the verb prefixes (Class I) and (Class II) are different, even if the noun prefixes are the same. The same is true with the singular and plural of Class III: &#x27;The dog is eating&#x27; vs &#x27;The dogs are eating&#x27; (compare English &quot;The sheep is eating&quot; vs &quot;The sheep are eating&quot; where the noun is invariant but the verb distinguishes singular from plural).

In fact, the plurals of Classes III and VII, and those of Classes V and IX, are identical in all their prefixes (noun, verb, adjective &quot;etc.&quot;).

Class V uses its noun prefixes somewhat differently from the other classes. The singular noun prefix, , is often reduced to with an accompanying doubling of the stem&#x27;s initial consonant. This happens when the stem begins with a single plosive, or a single nasal stop followed by a long vowel, a nasal stop and then a plosive (called a &quot;nasalised stem&quot;). For example:
* &#x27;egg&#x27;; plural (from stem )
* &#x27;country&#x27;; plural (from nasalised stem —the becomes when doubled)
* &#x27;cricket&#x27;; plural (from nasalised stem —the becomes when doubled)

Other stems use the full prefix:
* &#x27;name&#x27;; plural (from stem )
* &#x27;eye&#x27;; plural (from stem )
* &#x27;battery&#x27;; plural (from stem )

There are also some nouns that have no prefix. Their genders must simply be learnt by rote:
* Class I: &#x27;gentleman, sir&#x27;, &#x27;madam&#x27;, &#x27;god&#x27;, &#x27;king&#x27;, (or &#x27;) &#x27;tea&#x27;, &#x27;coffee&#x27;
* Class III: &#x27;cat&#x27;, &#x27;gomesi (traditional East African women&#x27;s formal dress)&#x27;

Adjectives, verbs, certain adverbs, the possessive and a few special forms of conjunctions are inflected to agree with nouns in Luganda.

=== Nouns ===
Nouns are inflected for number and state.

Number is indicated by replacing the singular prefix with the plural prefix. For example, &#x27;man&#x27;, &#x27;men&#x27;; &#x27;comb&#x27;, &#x27;combs&#x27;. All word classes agree with nouns in number and class.

State is similar to case but applies to verbs and other parts of speech as well as nouns, pronouns and adjectives. There are two states in Luganda, which may be called the base state and the topic state. The base state is unmarked and the topic state is indicated by the presence of the initial vowel.

The topic state is used for nouns in the following conditions:
* Subject of a sentence
* Object of an affirmative verb (other than the verb &#x27;to be&#x27;)

The base state is used for the following conditions:
* Object of a negative verb
* Object of a preposition
* Noun predicate (whether or not there is an explicit copula or verb &#x27;to be&#x27;)

=== Pronouns ===
Luganda has a closed set of pronouns.

==== Personal Pronouns ====
Luganda can have self-standing/independent personal pronouns and pronouns that are prefixed to the verb stem.

===== Self-Standing Pronouns =====
These include , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
* &#x27;I,me&#x27;
* &#x27;you&#x27;
* &#x27;he/she,him/her&#x27;
* &#x27;we,us&#x27;
* &#x27;you&#x27;
* &#x27;they,them&#x27;

Note that the sex/gender of referents is not distinguished so one has to be very careful how one translates Luganda pronouns into languages like English. For instance &quot;Ye musawo&quot; can be translated as &quot;She is a doctor&quot; or as &quot;He is a doctor&quot;.

=== Adjectives ===
As in other Niger–Congo languages (as well as most Indo-European and Afro-Asiatic languages), adjectives must agree in gender and number with the noun they qualify. For example:
* &#x27;beautiful girl&#x27; (Class I, singular)
* &#x27;beautiful girls&#x27; (Class I, plural)
* &#x27;beautiful tree&#x27; (Class II, singular)
* &#x27;beautiful trees&#x27; (Class II, plural)
* &#x27;beautiful/good car(s)&#x27; (Class V, singular/plural)
In these examples the adjective changes its prefix according to the gender (Class I or II) and number (singular or plural) of the noun it is qualifying (compare Italian , , , ). In some cases the prefix causes the initial of the stem to change to or .

Attributive adjectives agree in state with the noun they qualify, but predicative adjectives never take the initial vowel. Similarly, the subject relative is formed by adding the initial vowel to the verb (because a main verb is a predicate).

=== Adverbs ===
True adverbs in the grammatical sense are far rarer in Luganda than in, say, English, being mostly translated by other parts of speech—for example adjectives or particles.
When the adverb is qualifying a verb, it is usually translated by an adjective, which then agrees with the subject of the verb. For example:
* &#x27;She slanders me badly&#x27;
* &#x27;They slander me badly&#x27;
Here, &#x27;badly&#x27; is translated with the adjective &#x27;bad, ugly&#x27;, which is declined to agree with the subject.

Other concepts can be translated by invariant particles. for example the intensifying particle is attached to an adjective or verb to mean &#x27;very&#x27;, &#x27;a lot&#x27;. For example: &#x27;Lukwago drinks a lot&#x27;.

There are also two groups of true adverb in Luganda, both of which agree with the verbal subject or qualified noun (not just in gender and number but also in person), but which are inflected differently. The first group is conjugated in the same way as verbs and contains only a few words: &#x27;how&#x27;, &#x27;like this&#x27;, &#x27;like that&#x27;:
* &#x27;I speak like this&#x27;
* &#x27;Muslims pray like this&#x27;
* &#x27;The monkey eats like this&#x27;
* &#x27;Monkeys eat like this&#x27;
The adverb &#x27;like this&#x27; (the last word in each of the above sentences) is conjugated as a verb to agree with the subject of the sentence in gender, number and person.

The second group takes a different set of prefixes, based on the pronouns. Adverbs in this group include &#x27;all&#x27; (or, with the singular, &#x27;any&#x27;), &#x27;only&#x27;, , &#x27;both&#x27; and &#x27;all three&#x27;:
* &#x27;I work alone&#x27;
* &#x27;Only I work&#x27;
* &#x27;Only you work&#x27;
* &#x27;Only I will buy the car&#x27;
* &#x27;I will only buy the car&#x27;
Note how, in the last two examples, the adverb agrees with whichever antecedent it is qualifying — either the implicit &#x27;I&#x27; or the explicit &#x27;the car&#x27;.

Note also, in the first two examples, how the placement of before or after the verb makes the difference between &#x27;only&#x27; (when the adverb qualifies and agrees with the subject—the implicit &#x27;I&#x27;) and &#x27;alone&#x27; (when it qualifies the verb &#x27;I work&#x27; but agrees with the subject).

=== Possessive ===
The possessive in Luganda is indicated with a different particle for each singular and plural noun class (according to the possessed noun). An alternative way of thinking about the Luganda possessive is as a single word whose initial consonant cluster is altered to agree with the possessed noun in class and number.

Depending on the possessed noun, the possessive takes one of the following forms:
* Singular , plural (Class I)
* Singular , plural (Class II)
* Singular , plural (Class III)
* Singular , plural (Class IV)
* Singular , plural (Class V)
* Singular , plural (Class VI)
* Singular , plural (Class VII)
* Singular , plural (Class VIII)
* Singular , plural (Class IX)
* (Class X)

If the possessor is a personal pronoun, the separate possessive form is not used. Instead, the following personal possessives are used:
* &#x27;my&#x27;, &#x27;your (singular possessor)&#x27;, &#x27;his, her&#x27;; &#x27;our&#x27;, &#x27;your (plural possessor)&#x27;, &#x27;their&#x27; (Class I, singular possessed noun)
* &#x27;my&#x27;, &#x27;your (singular possessor)&#x27;, &#x27;his, her&#x27;; &#x27;our&#x27;, &#x27;your (plural possessor)&#x27;, &#x27;their&#x27; (Class I, plural possessed noun)
* &#x27;my&#x27;, &#x27;your (singular possessor)&#x27;, &#x27;his, her&#x27;; &#x27;our&#x27;, &#x27;your (plural possessor)&#x27;, &#x27;their&#x27; (Class II, singular possessed noun)
* &#x27;my&#x27;, &#x27;your (singular possessor)&#x27;, &#x27;his, her&#x27;; &#x27;our&#x27;, &#x27;your (plural possessor)&#x27; &#x27;their&#x27; (Class II, plural possessed noun)
* &#x27;my&#x27;, &#x27;your&#x27;, &quot;etc.&quot; (Class III, singular possessed noun)
* &quot;Etc.&quot;

There are also a few nouns that take special forms when used with a possessive:
* &#x27;my father&#x27;, &#x27;your (singular) father&#x27;, &#x27;his/her father&#x27;

=== Verbs ===

====Subjects====
As in other Bantu languages, every verb must also agree with its subject in gender and number (as opposed to number only as in Indo-European languages). For example:
* &#x27;the man is drinking&#x27; (Class I, singular)
* &#x27;the men are drinking&#x27; (Class I, plural)
* &#x27;the goat is drinking&#x27; (Class III, singular)
* &#x27;the goats are drinking&#x27; (Class III, plural)
* &#x27;the baby/infant is drinking&#x27; (Class VI, singular)
* &#x27;the babies/infants are drinking&#x27; (Class VI, plural)
Here, the verb changes its prefix according to the gender and number of its subject.

Note, in the third and fourth examples, how the verb agrees with the number of the noun even when the noun does not explicitly reflect the number distinction.

The subject prefixes for the personal pronouns are:
* First person: singular &#x27;I&#x27;, plural &#x27;we&#x27;
* Second person: singular &#x27;you (singular)&#x27;, &#x27;you (plural)&#x27;
* Third person: singular &#x27;he, she&#x27;, &#x27;they (Class I)&#x27;

For impersonal pronouns the subject prefixes are:
* Class I: singular , plural (&quot;i.e.&quot; the third person prefixes shown directly above)
* Class II: singular , plural 
* Class III: singular , plural 
* Class IV: singular , plural 
* Class V: singular , plural 
* Class VI: singular , plural 
* Class VII: singular , plural 
* Class VIII: singular , plural 
* Class IX: singular , plural 
* Class X: 

====Objects====
When the verb governs one or more objects, there is also an agreement between the object prefixes and the gender and number of their antecedents:
* &#x27;I drink it (&quot;e.g.&quot; coffee)&#x27; ( &#x27;coffee&#x27;, Class I singular)
* &#x27;I drink it (&quot;e.g.&quot; water)&#x27; ( &#x27;water&#x27;, Class IX plural)

As with the subject prefix, the third person prefixes also agree with their antecedents in person. The personal object prefixes are:
* First person: singular &#x27;me&#x27;, plural &#x27;us&#x27;
* Second person: singular &#x27;you (singular)&#x27;, &#x27;you (plural)&#x27;
* Third person: singular &#x27;him, her&#x27;, &#x27;them (Class I)&#x27;

For the impersonal third person the object prefixes are:
* Class I: singular , plural (&quot;i.e.&quot; the third person prefixes shown directly above)
* Class II: singular , plural 
* Class III: singular , plural 
* Class IV: singular , plural 
* Class V: singular , plural 
* Class VI: singular , plural 
* Class VII: singular , plural 
* Class VIII: singular , plural 
* Class IX: singular , plural 
* Class X: 

Note the similarity between each subject prefix and the corresponding object prefix: they are the same in all cases except Class I and the singular of Class III. Note also the correspondence between the object prefixes and the noun prefixes (see Nouns above): when every in the noun prefix is replaced by a in the object prefix, the only differences are in Classes I and III.

The direct object prefix is usually inserted directly after the subject prefix:
* &#x27;I have eaten it&#x27; ( subject &#x27;I&#x27; + object &#x27;it&#x27; + verb &#x27;ate&#x27;)

The indirect object prefix comes after the direct object:
* &#x27;I have given it to him&#x27; ( subject &#x27;I&#x27; + object &#x27;it&#x27; + object &#x27;(to) him&#x27; + verb &#x27;gave&#x27;)

==== Negative ====
The negative is usually formed by prefixing or to the subject prefix, or, in the case of the first person singular, replacing the prefix with . This results in the following set of personal subject prefixes:
* First person: singular &#x27;I&#x27;, plural &#x27;we&#x27;
* Second person: singular &#x27;you (singular)&#x27;, &#x27;you (plural)&#x27;
* Third person: singular &#x27;he, she&#x27;, &#x27;they (Class I)&#x27;

The negative impersonal subject prefixes are:
* Class I: singular , plural (&quot;i.e.&quot; the third person prefixes shown directly above)
* Class II: singular , plural 
* Class III: singular , plural 
* Class IV: singular , plural 
* Class V: singular , plural 
* Class VI: singular , plural 
* Class VII: singular , plural 
* Class VIII: singular , plural 
* Class IX: singular , plural 
* Class X: 

When used with object relatives or the narrative tense (see below), the negative is formed with the prefix , which is inserted after the subject and object affixes:
* &#x27;The person whom I saw&#x27;
* &#x27;The person whom I didn&#x27;t see&#x27;

====Modified stems====
To form some tenses, a special form of the verb stem, called the &#x27;modified form&#x27;, is used. This is formed by making various changes to the final syllable of the stem, usually involving either changing the final syllable to one of the following suffixes:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 

The modified form of verb stems is the only real source of irregularity in Luganda&#x27;s verbal system. Monosyllabic verbs, in particular, have unpredictable modified forms:
* &#x27;to be&#x27; 
* &#x27;to die&#x27; 
* &#x27;to deny, forbid&#x27; 
* &#x27;to end&#x27; (intransitive) 
* &#x27;to remove&#x27; or 
* &#x27;to cook&#x27; (intransitive) 
* &#x27;to fall&#x27; 
* &#x27;to come&#x27; 
* &#x27;to go down, come down&#x27; 
* &#x27;to catch&#x27; 
* &#x27;to delay&#x27; 
* &#x27;to eat&#x27; 
* &#x27;to find out, realise&#x27; 
* &#x27;to drink&#x27; 
* &#x27;to release&#x27; 
* &#x27;to put&#x27; 
* &#x27;to kill&#x27; 
* &#x27;to take&#x27; 
* &#x27;to be afraid&#x27; 
* &#x27;to come from&#x27; 
* &#x27;to give&#x27; 
* &#x27;to call&#x27; 
* &#x27;to pass&#x27; 

==== Tense and mood ====
Tense–aspect–mood in Luganda is explicitly marked on the verb, as it is in most other Bantu languages.

=====Present tense=====

The present tense is formed by simply adding the subject prefixes to the stem. The negative is formed in the same way but with the negative subject prefixes (this is the usual way of forming the negative in Luganda).
The present perfect is just the subject prefix plus the modified stem:
* &#x27;I have done&#x27;
* &#x27;you have done&#x27;
* &#x27;he, she has done&#x27;
* &#x27;we have done&#x27;
* &#x27;you (plural) have done&#x27;
* &#x27;they (class I) have done&#x27;

The present perfect in Luganda is sometimes slightly weaker in its past meaning than in English. It is often used with intransitive verbs with the sense of being in the state of having done something. For example, means &#x27;my husband has arrived&#x27; (using the present perfect form of the verb &#x27;to come&#x27;); usually means &#x27;I&#x27;m off&#x27; rather than &#x27;I have gone&#x27;. But to say &quot;I have done&quot; in Muganda would usually use one of the past tenses or &#x27;I did&#x27; because is a transitive verb.

The present perfect is also used to show physical attitude. For example, using the verb &#x27;to sit down&#x27;: (present tense) means &#x27;I am in the process of sitting myself down&#x27;; to say &#x27;I&#x27;m sitting down&#x27; in the usual sense of &#x27;I&#x27;m seated&#x27; in standard English, a Muganda would use the present perfect: (as in certain non-standard varieties of British English).

=====Past tenses=====
The near past is formed by inserting the prefix before the modified form of the stem. This prefix, being a vowel, has the effect of changing the form of the subject prefixes:
* &#x27;I did&#x27;
* &#x27;you did&#x27;
* &#x27;he, she did&#x27;
* &#x27;we did&#x27;
* &#x27;you (plural) did&#x27;
* &#x27;they (class I) did&#x27;

The near past tense is used for events that have happened in the past 18 hours. The negative is formed in the usual way.

The far past is formed with the same prefix as the near past, but using the simple form of the stem:
* &#x27;I did&#x27;
* &#x27;you did&#x27;
* &#x27;he, she did&#x27;
* &#x27;we did&#x27;
* &#x27;you (plural) did&#x27;
* &#x27;they (class I) did&#x27;

The far past tense is used for events that happened more than 18 hours ago, and can also be used as a weak pluperfect. This is the tense that is used in novels and storytelling.

=====Future tenses=====
The near future is used when describing things that are going to happen within the next 18 hours. It is formed with the prefix on the simple form of the stem:
* &#x27;I shall do&#x27;
* &#x27;you will do&#x27;
* &#x27;he, she will do&#x27;
* &#x27;we shall do&#x27;
* &#x27;you (plural) will do&#x27;
* &#x27;they (class I) will do&#x27;
* &#x27;they (class III) will do&#x27;
* &#x27;they (class III) will do&#x27;
In the second person singular and the singular of Class III, the prefix becomes and in harmony with the subject prefix.

The negative form of this tense is formed by changing the final of the stem to an and using vowel-lengthened negative subject prefixes; no tense prefix is used:
* &#x27;I shan&#x27;t do&#x27;
* &#x27;you won&#x27;t do&#x27;
* &#x27;he, she won&#x27;t do&#x27;
* &#x27;we shan&#x27;t do&#x27;
* &#x27;you (plural) won&#x27;t do&#x27;
* &#x27;they (class I) won&#x27;t do&#x27;
* &#x27;it (class II) won&#x27;t do&#x27;
* &#x27;they (class II) won&#x27;t do&#x27;
* &#x27;he, she, it (class III) won&#x27;t do&#x27;
* &#x27;they (class III) won&#x27;t do&#x27;

The far future is used for events that will take place more than 18 hours in the future. It is formed with the prefix on the simple form of the stem:
* &#x27;I shall do&#x27;
* &#x27;you will do&#x27;
* &#x27;he, she will do&#x27;
* &#x27;we shall do&#x27;
* &#x27;you (plural) will do&#x27;
* &#x27;they (class I) will do&#x27;

Note how the of the tense prefix becomes a after the of the first person singular subject prefix.

=====Other=====
The conditional mood is formed with the prefix and the modified form of the stem:
* &#x27;I would do&#x27;
* &#x27;you would do&#x27;
* &#x27;he, she would do&#x27;
* &#x27;we would do&#x27;
* &#x27;you (plural) would do&#x27;
* &#x27;they (class I) would do&#x27;

The subjunctive is formed by changing the final of the stem to an :
* &#x27;I may do&#x27;
* &#x27;you may do&#x27;
* &#x27;he, she may do&#x27;
* &#x27;we may do&#x27;
* &#x27;you may do&#x27;
* &#x27;they may do&#x27;

The negative is formed either with the auxiliary verb (&#x27;to fail&#x27;) plus the infinitive:
* &#x27;I may not do&#x27;
* &#x27;you may not do&#x27;
* &#x27;he, she may not do&#x27;
* &#x27;we may not do&#x27;
* &#x27;you may not do&#x27;
* &#x27;they may not do&#x27;

or using the same forms as the negative of the near future:
* &#x27;I may not do&#x27;
* &#x27;you may not do&#x27;
* &#x27;he, she may not do&#x27;
* &#x27;we may not do&#x27;
* &#x27;you may not do&#x27;
* &#x27;they may not do&#x27;

Luganda has some special tenses not found in many other languages. The &#x27;still&#x27; tense is used to say that something is still happening. It is formed with the prefix :
* &#x27;I&#x27;m still doing&#x27;
* &#x27;you&#x27;re still doing&#x27;
* &#x27;he, she is still doing&#x27;
* &#x27;we&#x27;re still doing&#x27;
* &#x27;you&#x27;re still doing&#x27;
* &#x27;they&#x27;re still doing&#x27;

In the negative it means &#x27;no longer&#x27;:
* &#x27;I&#x27;m no longer doing&#x27;
* &#x27;you&#x27;re no longer doing&#x27;
* &#x27;he, she is no longer doing&#x27;
* &#x27;we&#x27;re no longer doing&#x27;
* &#x27;you&#x27;re no longer doing&#x27;
* &#x27;they&#x27;re no longer doing&#x27;

With intransitive verbs, especially verbs of physical attitude (see Present Perfect above), the prefix can also be used with the modified verb stem to give a sense of &#x27;still being in a state&#x27;. For example, means &#x27;I&#x27;m still seated&#x27;.

The &#x27;so far&#x27; tense is used when talking about what has happened so far, with the implication that more is to come. It is formed with the prefix :
* &#x27;I have so far done&#x27;
* &#x27;you have so far done&#x27;
* &#x27;he, she has so far done&#x27;
* &#x27;we have so far done&#x27;
* &#x27;you have so far done&#x27;
* &#x27;they have so far done&#x27;

This tense is found only in the affirmative.

The &#x27;not yet&#x27; tense, on the other hand, is found only in the negative. It is used to talk about things that have not happened yet (but which may well happen in the future), and is formed with the prefix :
* &#x27;I haven&#x27;t yet done&#x27;
* &#x27;you haven&#x27;t yet done&#x27;
* &#x27;he, she hasn&#x27;t yet done&#x27;
* &#x27;we haven&#x27;t yet done&#x27;
* &#x27;you haven&#x27;t yet done&#x27;
* &#x27;they haven&#x27;t yet done&#x27;

When describing a series of events that happen (or will or did happen) sequentially, the narrative form is used for all but the first verb in the sentence. It is formed by the particle (or before a vowel) followed by the present tense:
* &#x27;I went and made a phone call&#x27;
* &#x27;I&#x27;ll go and make a phone call&#x27;

The narrative can be used with any tense, as long as the events it describes are in immediate sequence. The negative is formed with the prefix placed immediately after the object prefixes (or after the subject prefix if no object prefixes are used):
* &#x27;I didn&#x27;t go and did not make a phone call&#x27;
* &#x27;I won&#x27;t go and will not make a phone call&#x27;
* &#x27;I haven&#x27;t gone to make it yet&#x27;

Compare this with the negative construction used with the object relatives.

==== Auxiliary verbs ====
Other tenses can be formed periphrastically, with the use of auxiliary verbs. Some of Luganda&#x27;s auxiliary verbs can also be used as main verbs; some are always auxiliaries:
* &#x27;to be&#x27;: used with an optional with another finite verb to form compound tenses
* &#x27;to come&#x27;: forms a future tense when used with the infinitive of the main verb
* or (only used as an auxiliary): appears with another finite verb, usually translated &#x27;and then&#x27; or (in the subjunctive) &#x27;so that&#x27;
* &#x27;to finish&#x27;: used with the infinitive to denote completed action, or with the stem of the main verb prefixed with to mean &#x27;whether one wants to or not&#x27;
* (only used as an auxiliary): used with the infinitive of the main verb to mean (in the present tense) &#x27;to tend to&#x27; or (in the near future) &#x27;about to&#x27;
* &#x27;to come from&#x27;: followed by the main verb in the infinitive, means &#x27;just been&#x27;
* &#x27;to fail&#x27;: used with the infinitive to form negatives

==== Derivational affixes ====
The meaning of a verb can be altered in an almost unlimited number of ways by means of modifications to the verb stem. There are only a handful of core derivational modifications, but these can be added to the verb stem in virtually any combination, resulting in hundreds of possible compound modifications.

The passive is produced by replacing the final with or /:
* &#x27;to see&#x27; → &#x27;to be seen&#x27;

The reflexive is created by adding the prefix to the verb stem (equivalent to replacing the prefix of the infinitive with ):
* &#x27;to kill&#x27; → &#x27;to kill oneself&#x27;

Many verbs are used only in their reflexive form:
* &#x27;to sleep&#x27; (simple form * is not used)
* &#x27;to need&#x27; (simple form * is not used)

Reduplication is formed by doubling the stem, and generally adds the sense of repetition or intensity:
* &#x27;to strike&#x27; → &#x27;to batter&#x27;

The applied, or prepositional, modification, allows the verb to take an extra object and gives it the meaning &#x27;to do for or with (someone or something)&#x27;. It is formed with the suffix inserted before the final of the verb:
* &#x27;to work&#x27; → &#x27;to work for (an employer)&#x27;
* &#x27;to sleep&#x27; → &#x27;to sleep on (&quot;e.g.&quot; a piece of furniture)&#x27;

Adding the applied suffix twice gives the &#x27;augmentative applied&#x27; modification, which has an alternative applied sense, usually further removed from the original sense than the simple applied modification:
* &#x27;to work&#x27; → &#x27;to utilise, employ&#x27;

The causative is formed with various changes applied to the end of the verb, usually involving the final changing to , or . It gives a verb the sense of &#x27;to cause to do&#x27;, and can also make an intransitive verb transitive:
* &#x27;to see&#x27; → &#x27;to show&#x27; (more commonly &quot;okulaga&quot;, a different verb, is used).
* &#x27;to become&#x27; → &#x27;to turn (something or someone) into (something else)&#x27;

Applying two causative modifications results in the &#x27;second causative&#x27;:
* &#x27;to see&#x27; → &#x27;to show&#x27; → &#x27;to cause to show&#x27;

The neuter modification, also known as the stative, is similar to the &#x27;-able&#x27; suffix in English, except that the result is a verb meaning &#x27;to be &quot;x&quot;-able&#x27; rather than an adjective meaning ″&quot;x&quot;-able&#x27;. It is formed by inserting the suffix / before the verb&#x27;s final :
* &#x27;to do&#x27; → &#x27;to be possible&#x27;
* &#x27;to eat&#x27; → &#x27;to be edible&#x27;

The intransitive conversive modification reverses the meaning of an intransitive verb and leaves it intransitive, or reverses the meaning of a transitive verb and makes it intransitive, similar to English&#x27;s &#x27;un-&#x27; prefix. It is formed with the prefix inserted before the verb&#x27;s final :
* &#x27;to pay a visit&#x27; → &#x27;to end one&#x27;s visit, to depart&#x27;

The transitive conversive is similar to the intransitive conversive except that it results in a transitive verb. In other words, it reverses the meaning of an intransitive verb and makes it transitive, or reverses the meaning of a transitive verb and leaves it transitive. It is formed with the suffix :
* &#x27;to do&#x27; → &#x27;to undo&#x27;
* &#x27;to plant&#x27; → &#x27;to uproot&#x27;
* &#x27;to pay a visit&#x27; → &#x27;to send off&#x27;

Two conversive suffixes create the augmentative conversive modification:
* &#x27;to deceive&#x27; → &#x27;to disabuse, set straight&#x27;

The reciprocal modification is formed with the suffix or (or less commonly ):
* &#x27;to see&#x27; → &#x27;to see one another&#x27;
* &#x27;to kill&#x27; → &#x27;to kill each other&#x27;

The progressive is formed with the suffix . It is used with finite verbs to give the sense of continuousness:
* &#x27;I&#x27;ll look after him&#x27; → &#x27;I&#x27;ll always look after him&#x27;
* &#x27;don&#x27;t whinge&#x27; → &#x27;never whinge&#x27;
* &#x27;don&#x27;t steal&#x27; → &#x27;thou shalt not steal&#x27;

This is not really a modification but a clitic, so it is always applied &#x27;after&#x27; any grammatical inflexions.

====Combinations of modifications ====
More than one modification can be made to a single stem:
* &#x27;to be undo-able (&quot;i.e.&quot; reversible)&#x27; — conversive neuter: → → 
* &#x27;to transplant&#x27; — conversive applied causative: → → → 
* &#x27;to look around oneself, be distracted&#x27; — reduplicative reciprocal: → → 
* &#x27;to distract&#x27; — reduplicative reciprocal causative: → → → 
* &#x27;to pretend to sleep&#x27; — reflexive augmentative applied causative → → (applied) → (augmentative applied) → 

There are some restrictions that apply to the combinations in which these modifications can be made. For example, the &#x27;applied&#x27; modification cannot be made to a causative stem; any causative modifications must first be removed, the applied modification made and the causative modifications then reapplied. And since the reflexive is formed with a prefix rather than a suffix, it is impossible to distinguish between, for example, reflexive causative and causative reflexive.

== Numbers ==
The Luganda system of cardinal numbers is quite complicated. The numbers &#x27;one&#x27; to &#x27;five&#x27; are specialised numerical adjectives that agree with the noun they qualify. The words for &#x27;six&#x27; to &#x27;ten&#x27; are numerical nouns that do not agree with the qualified noun.

&#x27;Twenty&#x27; to &#x27;fifty&#x27; are expressed as multiples of ten using the cardinal numbers for &#x27;two&#x27; to &#x27;five&#x27; with the plural of &#x27;ten&#x27;. &#x27;Sixty&#x27; to &#x27;one hundred&#x27; are numerical nouns in their own right, derived from the same roots as the nouns for &#x27;six&#x27; to &#x27;ten&#x27; but with different class prefixes.

In a similar pattern, &#x27;two hundred&#x27; to &#x27;five hundred&#x27; are expressed as multiples of a hundred using the cardinal numbers with the plural of &#x27;hundred&#x27;. Then &#x27;six hundred&#x27; to &#x27;one thousand&#x27; are nouns, again derived from the same roots as &#x27;six&#x27; to &#x27;ten&#x27;. The pattern repeats up to &#x27;ten thousand&#x27;, then standard nouns are used for &#x27;ten thousand&#x27;, &#x27;one hundred thousand&#x27; and &#x27;one million&#x27;.

The words used for this system are:

Numerical adjectives (declined to agree with the qualified noun):
* (, , , , ...) &#x27;one&#x27;
* (, , ...) &#x27;two&#x27;
* (, , ...) &#x27;three&#x27;
* (, , ...) &#x27;four&#x27;
* (, , ...) &#x27;five&#x27;
Numerical nouns:
* &#x27;Six&#x27; to &#x27;ten&#x27; (Classes II and V)
** &#x27;six&#x27; (Class II)
** &#x27;seven&#x27;
** &#x27;eight&#x27;
** &#x27;nine&#x27;
** &#x27;ten&#x27;; plural (Class V)
* &#x27;Sixty&#x27; to &#x27;one hundred&#x27; (Classes III and IV)
** &#x27;sixty&#x27; (Class III)
** &#x27;seventy&#x27;
** &#x27;eighty&#x27; (Class IV)
** &#x27;ninety&#x27;
** &#x27;one hundred&#x27;; plural 
* &#x27;Six hundred&#x27; to &#x27;one thousand&#x27; (Class VII)
** &#x27;six hundred&#x27;
** &#x27;seven hundred&#x27;
** &#x27;eight hundred&#x27;
** &#x27;nine hundred&#x27;
** &#x27;one thousand&#x27;; plural 
* &#x27;Six thousand&#x27; to &#x27;ten thousand&#x27; (Class VI)
** &#x27;six thousand&#x27;
** &#x27;seven thousand&#x27;
** &#x27;eight thousand&#x27;
** &#x27;nine thousand&#x27;
** (archaic) &#x27;ten thousand&#x27;; plural 
Standard nouns:
* &#x27;ten thousand&#x27;; plural (Class II)
* &#x27;one hundred thousand&#x27;; plural (Class VI)
* &#x27;one million&#x27;; plural (Class VI)
* &#x27;one billion&#x27; (1,000,000,000); plural (Class VI)
* &#x27;one trillion&#x27; (1,000,000,000,000); plural 
* &#x27;one quintillion&#x27; (1,000,000,000,000,000,000); plural (Class VI)
* &#x27;one septillion&#x27; (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000); plural (Class VI)

Digits are specified from left to right, combined with (following ) and (following any other word). For example:
* 12 (10 + 2)
* 22 (10 × 2 + 2)
* 65 (60 + 5)
* 122 (100 + 10 × 2 + 2)
* 222 (100 × 2 + 10 × 2 + 2)
* 1,222 (1,000 + 100 × 2 + 10 × 2 + 2)
* 1,024 (1,000 + 10 × 2 + 4)
* 2,222 (1,000 × 2 + 100 × 2 + 10 × 2 + 2)
* 2,500 (1,000 × 2 + 100 × 5)
* 7,500 (7,000 + 100 × 5)
* 7,600 (7,000 + 600)
* 9,999 (9,000 + 900 + 90 + 9)
* 999,000 
* 1,000,000 (1,000,000)
* 3,000,000 (1,000,000 × 3)
* 10,000,000 (1,000,000 × 10)
* 122,000,122 (1,000,000 * (100 + 10 × 2 + 2) + 100 + 10 × 2 + 2)

The numerical adjectives agree with the qualified noun:
* &#x27;one car&#x27; (Class III)
* &#x27;one woman&#x27; (Class I)
* &#x27;five cars&#x27;
* &#x27;five women&#x27;
but
* &#x27;a hundred cars&#x27;
* &#x27;a hundred women&#x27;
and
* &#x27;eleven men&#x27; (Class I)
* &#x27;eleven cattle&#x27; (Class III)

The forms , , , and are used when counting (as well as when qualifying nouns of classes III and VII).

However, a complication arises from the agreement of numerical adjectives with the powers of ten. Since the words for &#x27;ten&#x27;, &#x27;hundred&#x27;, &#x27;thousand&#x27; and so on belong to different classes, each power of ten can be inferred from the form of the adjective qualifying it, so the plural forms of the powers of ten ( &#x27;tens&#x27;, &#x27;hundreds&#x27;, &#x27;tens of thousands&#x27; — but not &#x27;thousands&#x27;) are usually omitted, as long as this does not result in ambiguity.

For example:
* 40 → 
* 22 → 
* 222 → 
* 1,024 → 
* 2,222 → 
* 2,500 → 
* 7,500 → 
* 122,000,122 → 

Note that:
* &#x27;40 batteries&#x27; cannot be shortened to because this means &quot;four batteries&quot;, and &#x27;40 dogs&#x27; cannot be shortened to because is the form of used with , so this actually means &#x27;four dogs&#x27;.
* &#x27;thousands&#x27; is also not usually omitted because the form the numerical adjectives take when qualifying it is the same as the counting form, so 3,000 will always be rendered .

<doc id="87828" wikidata="Q2863441" url="?curid=87828" title="Thundarr the Barbarian">
<text>Thundarr the Barbarian is an American Saturday morning animated series, created by Steve Gerber (of Howard the Duck fame) and produced by Ruby-Spears Productions. The series ran for two seasons on ABC from October 4, 1980, to October 31, 1981, and was rerun on NBC in 1983.

==Plot==
&quot;Thundarr the Barbarian&quot; is set in a future (c. 3994) post-apocalyptic wasteland of Earth divided into kingdoms and territories, the majority of which are ruled by wizards, and whose ruins typically feature recognizable geographical features from the United States, such as New York City, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Seattle, the Badlands, Mount Rushmore, Denver, Atlanta, Boston, San Antonio and its Alamo, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Cape Canaveral, and the Grand Canyon. Other episodes with recognizable settings are set outside the United States, and include Mexico and London. Another notable feature of this future Earth is that the Moon was broken in two pieces. The shattered moon and the ruins of the former human civilization were caused by the passage of a runaway planet between the Earth and the Moon in 1994, which, from scenes shown in the opening sequence, caused radical changes in the Earth&#x27;s climate and geography. However, by the time period in which the series is set, the Earth and Moon seem to have settled into a new physical balance. Earth is reborn with a world of &quot;savagery, super-science, and sorcery&quot; far more chaotic than &quot;Old Earth&quot; (the show&#x27;s name for the pre-apocalyptic world).

The hero Thundarr (voiced by Robert Ridgely), a muscular warrior, and companions Princess Ariel, a formidable young sorceress, and Ookla the Mok, a mighty lion-like biped, travel the world on horseback, fighting injustice. Their main adversaries are evil wizards who combine magical spells with reanimating technologies from the pre-catastrophe world. Some of these malevolent wizards enlist the service of certain mutant species to do their bidding.

Other enemies include The Brotherhood of Night (a group of werewolves who could transform others into werewolves by their touch), the cosmic Stalker from The Stars (a predatory, malevolent cosmic vampire), and various other mutants. Intelligent humanoid-animal races include the rat-like Groundlings, the crocodile-like Carocs, and talking hawk-like and pig-like mutants. New animals that existed include fire-shooting whales, a giant green snake with a grizzly bear&#x27;s head, and mutated dragonflies and rabbits.

Thundarr&#x27;s weapon is the Sunsword that projects a blade-like beam of energy when activated, and can be deactivated so that it is only a hilt. The Sunsword&#x27;s energy blade can deflect other energy attacks as well as magical ones, can cut through nearly anything, and can disrupt magical spells and effects. The Sunsword is magically linked to Thundarr and as such, only he can use it; however, this link can be disrupted.

==Characters==
The series&#x27; narrator was Dick Tufeld.

* Thundarr (voiced by Robert Ridgely) is the main protagonist of the series. He is a barbarian who was once a slave to Sabian until he was freed by Princess Ariel and given the Sunsword which he uses as a weapon in his fight against evil wizards and other villains. Thundarr was known for frequently uttering such pronouncements as &quot;Demon dogs!&quot;, &quot;Lords of Light!&quot;, &quot;Ariel, Ookla, Ride!&quot;, and his war-cry &quot;Aaaaa-HEE!&quot;. Thundarr, along with his friend Ookla, are largely unknowledgeable about the world so they rely on Ariel&#x27;s guidance, but Thundarr is respectful of knowledge which is gained.
* Ookla the Mok (voiced by Henry Corden) is a member of the Mok species, a leonine humanoid with fangs and yellow eyes. In &quot;Thundarr the Barbarian&quot;″s backstory, Ookla and Thundarr were enslaved in the court of the wizard Sabian until Sabian&#x27;s stepdaughter Princess Ariel helped them escape. As a Mok, Ookla has great strength, he usually fights by ripping up a nearby sapling or ripping up a piece of wreckage and clubbing his enemies with it. On a few occasions, he uses a longbow that fires a type of paralyzing arrow. However, he is also the most likely of the heroes to charge right into an enemy attack and he is also easily enraged by unusual nuisances or threats. Moks dwell in their own territory, ruled by a king; they fear and hate water. While they prefer to face perilous odds on land rather than travel by water, in extreme cases, they can be persuaded to fight on water. While Ariel generally understands Ookla, Thundaar is more knowledgeable about Ookla, probably because they became friends and they also worked together during the time when they were enslaved. Whereas Thundarr and Ariel ride horses for transportation (his is white; hers is brown), Ookla&#x27;s steed is another quadrupedal species which is called an equort.
* Princess Ariel (voiced by Nellie Bellflower) is a powerful sorceress. Not much was revealed about her past before she met Thundarr except that she was the stepdaughter of an evil wizard named Sabian. She learned of Earth&#x27;s history from his library, and thus is considered the &quot;academic&quot; of the group. In the episode &quot;Battle of The Barbarians&quot;, it is revealed that Thundarr was once a slave of the evil wizard Sabian before being freed by Princess Ariel. It was never revealed exactly where she was a princess. Her most common feats of sorcery involved creating light constructs such as archways and bridges, exploding spheres and levitating weights to summoning nets, shields, or bridges over chasms. She can also produce powerful energy blasts, blinding light and magically reanimate machines. When her wrists are bound together, she cannot work her magic, and is vulnerable to capture. At times, she shows romantic feelings for Thundarr; but he never outwardly returns them, although it&#x27;s clear that he cares greatly for her and he also considers her an important team member. Ariel&#x27;s attire consists of knee-high boots, wrist bracelets, and an open-backed, leg-baring cyan (with yellow trim) costume which resembles a bathing suit.

==Production==
The series was the creation of comic book writer Steve Gerber. Gerber and friend Martin Pasko were having dinner in the Westwood area one night during the time Gerber was developing the series. Gerber commented to Pasko that he had not yet decided upon a name for the wookiee-like character the network insisted be added to the series, over Gerber&#x27;s objections. As the two walked past the gate to the UCLA campus, Pasko quipped, &quot;Why not call him Oo-clah?&quot; Pasko later became one of several screenwriters also known for their work in comics, such as Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway, to contribute to the show. After writing several scripts, singly and in collaboration with Gerber, Pasko became a story editor on the second season. Other writers included Buzz Dixon and Mark Jones.

Comic book writer-artist Jack Kirby worked on the production design for the show. The main characters were designed by fellow comic book writer-artist Alex Toth. Toth, however, was unavailable to continue working on the show, so most of the wizards and other villains and secondary characters that appear on the show were designed by Kirby. He was brought onto the show at the recommendation of Gerber and Mark Evanier.

Twenty-one half-hour episodes were produced by Ruby-Spears Productions, an animation house formed by former Hanna-Barbera head writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, and aired from October 1980 to October 1981 on the ABC network. Despite decent ratings, the show was cancelled, as Paramount wanted to make room in the programming schedule for &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley in the Army&quot;. Reruns of &quot;Thundarr&quot; appeared on NBC&#x27;s Saturday morning lineup in 1983.

==Episodes==

===Season 1 (1980)===
All episodes of season 1 were directed by Rudy Larriva and produced by Jerry Eisenberg.

===Season 2 (1981)===
All episodes of season 2 were directed by Rudy Larriva and John Kimball, with animation supervision by Milt Gray &amp; Bill Reed.

==Home media releases==
The debut episode of &quot;Thundarr the Barbarian&quot; was released on DVD as part of Warner Home Video&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Morning Cartoons: 1980s&quot; compilation series. The DVD set, containing episodes of ten other shows, was released on May 4, 2010. It is now available for online download through Amazon.com.

On September 28, 2010, Warner Archive released &quot;Thundarr the Barbarian: The Complete Series&quot; to DVD in region 1 as part of their Hanna–Barbera Classics Collection. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Warner&#x27;s online store and Amazon.com. The DVD set is branded as part of the Hanna-Barbera Classics Collection as &quot;Thundarr&quot; and the other 1978–1991 Ruby-Spears programs were sold to Turner Broadcasting in 1991 alongside Hanna-Barbera by Great American Broadcasting. On April 6, 2021, Warner Archive also released &quot;Thundarr the Barbarian: The Complete Series&quot; on Blu-ray. Unlike the DVD release, the Blu-ray release restored the Ruby-Spears Productions logo, but the Filmways logo was still removed for the first season (due to being copyrighted by Hanna-Barbera).

==Influence==
In a November 2017 interview with &quot;Revolver&quot;, Morbid Angel guitarist Trey Azagthoth stated that the band&#x27;s new album, &quot;Kingdoms Disdained&quot;, is based on &quot;Thundarr the Barbarian&quot;, 

There is also a filk band from Buffalo, New York called Ookla the Mok. The series was referenced and was involved in the plot of the third-season episode &quot;One Watson, One Holmes&quot; of the CBS television series &quot;Elementary&quot;. In &quot;Fairlady&quot; #3, by Brian Schirmer and Claudia Balboni, the characters Dunkarr, the Barbarian, Ari and Oosk were inspired by the main characters in the series.

==Merchandise==

===Toys===
Action figures of the three main characters were released by Toynami in 2003. A board game was released by Milton Bradley Company in 1982.

===Comics and books===
A Sunday strip illustrated by Jack Kirby was planned, but the project was canceled. In 1982, a coloring book was published by Golden Books. According to Mark Evanier, Whitman Comics had a Thundarr comic book project with scripts by John David Warner and art by Winslow Mortimer.

In July 2024, it was announced Dynamite Entertainment picked up the license to do a Thundarr comic.

<text>Shalmaneser I (𒁹𒀭𒁲𒈠𒉡𒊕 md&quot;sál-ma-nu-SAG&quot; &quot;Salmanu-ašared&quot;; 1273–1244 BC or 1265–1235 BC) was a king of Assyria during the Middle Assyrian Empire. He was the son and successor of Adad-nirari I.
==Reign==
Year 1: According to his annals, discovered at Assur, in his first year he conquered eight countries in the northwest and destroyed the fortress of Arinnu, the dust of which he brought to Assur.

Year 2: In his second year he defeated Shattuara, king of Hanilgalbat (Mitanni), and his Hittite and Ahlamu allies. He incorporated the remains of the Mittanni kingdom as part of one of the Assyrian provinces. Shalmaneser I also claimed to have blinded 14,400 enemy prisoners in one eye. He was one of the first Assyrian kings who was known to deport his defeated enemies to various lands rather than simply slaughtering them all.

He conquered the whole country from Taidu to Irridu, from Mount Kashiar to Eluhat, and from the fortresses of Sudu and Harranu to Carchemish on the Euphrates. He built palaces at Assur and Nineveh, restored the &quot;world-temple&quot; at Assur (Ehursagkurkurra), and founded the city of Kalhu (the biblical Calah/Nimrud). He was succeeded by his son Tukulti-Ninurta I.

Annual limmu officials beginning with the year of accession of Šulmanu-ašared. The list is partly derived from Freydank and McIntyre. The exact order of the earliest limmus is conjectural but the ordering from Šerriya onwards is essentially fixed.
